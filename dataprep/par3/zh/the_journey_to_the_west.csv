飞萤光散影，过雁字排云。正直三更候，应该访道真。你看他从旧路径至后门外，只见那门儿半开半掩。悟空喜道：“老师父果然注意与我传道，故此开着门也。”即曳步近前，侧身进得门里，只走到祖师寝榻之下。见祖师蜷局身躯，朝里睡着了。悟空不敢惊动，即跪在榻前。那祖师不多时觉来，舒开两足，口中自吟道：,"Flying fluorescent light scattered shadows, passing the geese and arranging the clouds. In the third watch of integrity, we should visit Daozhen. You see him walking from the old path to the back door, which is half open. Wukong happily said: ""Teacher and father really pay attention to preaching with me, so the door is open."" Then he stepped forward, walked sideways into the door, and only walked to the bed of the patriarch. Seeing the Patriarch curled up, he fell asleep inside. Wukong didn't dare to be disturbed, so he knelt before the couch. The Patriarch woke up after a while, stretched out his feet, and chanted to himself:","Darting fireflies dispersed the gloom. Wild geese spread word columns through the clouds. Precisely it was the third-watch hour— Time to seek the Way whole and true. You see him following the familiar path back to the rear entrance, where he discovered that the door was, indeed, ajar. Wukong said happily, “The reverend master truly intended to give me instruction. That’s why the door was left open.” He reached the door in a few large strides and entered sideways. Walking up to the Patriarch’s bed, he found him asleep with his body curled up, facing the wall. Wukong dared not disturb him; instead, he knelt before his bed. After a little while, the Patriarch awoke. Stretching his legs, he recited to himself:","The Monkey King thought this was only the Master’s private hint for him to come and see him at the third watch that night, and he would tell him the secret. At the third watch the Monkey King went in and found his Master’s door half open. He went in and waked him. On waking the Master chanted:","Guided by a clear moon and the darting glow of fireflies, he made his way to the back door into Subodhi’s room, which he discovered was open. “So I was right!” he congratulated himself. He slipped in and kneeled by Subodhi’s bed, where the master was curled up asleep, facing the wall. Soon, Subodhi awoke, stretched his legs, and murmured a poem:","Fireflies scattered their lights And a line of geese was stretched across the clouds. It was exactly the third watch, The right time to ask about the Way. Watch the Monkey King as he follows the old path to the back door, which he found to be ajar. “The Patriarch has left the door open, so he really intends to teach me the Way,” he exclaimed in delight. He tiptoed toward, went in sideways through the door, and walked over to the Patriarch's bed, where he saw the Patriarch sleeping curled up, facing the inside of the room. Not daring to disturb him, Sun Wukong knelt in front of the bed. Before long the Patriarch woke up, stretched out both his legs, and mumbled to himself:"
“悟空，这教怎么说？”行者道：“菩萨，我悟空有一句话儿，叫做将计就计，不知菩萨可肯依我？”菩萨道：“你说。”行者说道：,"""Wukong, what does this teaching say?"" The practitioner said: ""Bodhisattva, I have a saying in Wukong, it's called a plan, I don't know if the Bodhisattva is willing to rely on me?"" The bodhisattva said: ""You say."" The practitioner said:","“What are you saying, Wukong?” said the Bodhisattva. “Bodhisattva,” said Pilgrim, “I, Wukong, have a saying: plot should be met with plot. I don’t know whether you will listen to me or not.” “Speak up!” said the Bodhisattva. “Look, Bodhisattva!” said Pilgrim.",,"asked Monkey. The goblin described the process, finishing with the all-important outcome: “In one and three-quarter hours, the monkey will be slime.” Secretly shaken, Monkey smiled genially. “May I see?”","“What do you mean?” the Bodhisattva asked. “I have a saying,” he replied, “that goes 'beat him at his own game'. Are you willing to let me do things my way?” “Tell me about it,” the Bodhisattva said."
“汝来何干？”揭谛道：“唐僧在蛇盘山鹰愁陡涧失了马，急得孙大圣进退两难。及问本处土神，说是菩萨送在那里的孽龙吞了，那大圣着小神来告请菩萨降这孽龙，还他马匹。”菩萨闻言道：“这厮本是西海敖闰之子。他为纵火烧了殿上明珠，他父告他忤逆，天庭上犯了死罪，是我亲见玉帝，讨他下来，教他与唐僧做个脚力。他怎么反吃了唐僧的马？这等说，等我去来。”那菩萨降莲台，径离仙洞，与揭谛驾着祥光，过了南海而来。有诗为证，诗曰：佛说蜜多三藏经，菩萨扬善满长城。摩诃妙语通天地，般若真言救鬼灵。致使金蝉重脱壳，故令玄奘再修行。只因路阻鹰愁涧，龙子归真化马形。那菩萨与揭谛，不多时到了蛇盘山。却在那半空里留住祥云，低头观看。只见孙行者正在涧边叫骂。菩萨着揭谛唤他来。那揭谛按落云头，不经由三藏，直至涧边，对行者道：“菩萨来也。”行者闻得，急纵云跳到空中，对他大叫道：“你这个七佛之师，慈悲的教主！你怎么生方法儿害我！”菩萨道：“我把你这个大胆的马流，村愚的赤尻！我倒再三尽意，度得个取经人来，叮咛教他救你性命，你怎么不来谢我活命之恩，反来与我嚷闹？”行者道：“你弄得我好哩！你既放我出来，让我逍遥自在耍子便了，你前日在海上迎着我，伤了我几句，教我来尽心竭力，伏侍唐僧便罢了；你怎么送他一顶花帽，哄我戴在头上受苦？把这个箍子长在老孙头上，又教他念一卷甚么紧箍儿咒，着那老和尚念了又念，教我这头上疼了又疼，这不是你害我也？”菩萨笑道：“你这猴子！你不遵教令，不受正果，若不如此拘系你，你又诳上欺天，知甚好歹！再似从前撞出祸来，有谁收管？须是得这个魔头，你才肯入我瑜伽之门路哩！”行者道：“这桩事，作做是我的魔头罢，你怎么又把那有罪的孽龙，送在此处成精，教他吃了我师父的马匹？此又是纵放歹人为恶，太不善也！”菩萨道：“那条龙，是我亲奏玉帝，讨他在此，专为求经人做个脚力。你想那东土来的凡马，怎历得这万水千山？怎到得那灵山佛地？须是得这个龙马，方才去得。”行者道：“象他这般惧怕老孙，潜躲不出，如之奈何？”菩萨叫揭谛道：“你去涧边叫一声‘敖闰龙王玉龙三太子，你出来，有南海菩萨在此。’他就出来了。”那揭谛果去涧边叫了两遍。那小龙翻波跳浪，跳出水来，变作一个人象，踏了云头，到空中对菩萨礼拜道：“向蒙菩萨解脱活命之恩，在此久等，更不闻取经人的音信。”菩萨指着行者道：“这不是取经人的大徒弟？”小龙见了道：“菩萨，这是我的对头。我昨日腹中饥馁，果然吃了他的马匹。他倚着有些力量，将我斗得力怯而回，又骂得我闭门不敢出来，他更不曾提着一个取经的字样。”行者道：,"""What are you doing here?"" Jie Di said: ""Tang Seng lost his horse in the Yingchou steep stream of Shepan Mountain, and was so anxious that Sun Dasheng was in a dilemma. When he asked the local god of the earth, he said that the evil dragon sent there by the Bodhisattva swallowed it. The holy god came to sue the Bodhisattva to bring down the evil dragon and return his horse."" The Bodhisattva heard the words and said, ""This fellow was originally the son of Aorun in the West Sea. He set fire to the pearl in the temple, and his father accused him of disobedience, and he committed a crime in the heavenly court. For the death penalty, I personally saw the Jade Emperor, begged him to come down, and taught him to do a foot-strike with Tang Seng. Why did he eat Tang Seng's horse? Wait for me to come."" Yu Jie Di rode auspicious light and came across the South China Sea. There is a poem as proof, the poem says: The Buddha taught the Mito Tripitaka Sutra, and the Bodhisattva raised the Great Wall of goodness. Maha's witty words reach heaven and earth, and Prajna mantras save ghosts and spirits. This caused Jin Chan to shed its shell again, so Xuanzang was ordered to practice again. Just because the road blocked the eagle's sorrow, the dragon son returned to the truth and turned into the shape of a horse. That Bodhisattva and Jieti came to Snake Pan Mountain in a short time. But he kept Xiangyun in the mid-air and looked down. I saw Sun Xingzhe yelling by the stream. The Bodhisattva called him to come. Najati pressed the cloud head down, did not pass through the Three Treasures, went to the edge of the stream, and said to the practitioner, ""The Bodhisattva is here."" The practitioner heard this, and jumped into the air in a hurry, shouting to him, ""You teacher of the seven Buddhas, Compassionate leader! How could you harm me!"" The Bodhisattva said, ""I will take you, the daring Ma Liu, the ignorant Akashiri of the village! I have tried my best to save a sutra and teach him to save you. Life, why don't you come to thank me for my life, but instead make trouble with me?"" The traveler said, ""You made me so good! Since you let me out and let me play at ease, you greeted me at sea the day before yesterday. If you hurt me and hurt me a few words, teach me to do my best and serve Tang Monk. How can you give him a flower hat and coax me to wear it on my head to suffer? He recited a scroll of some kind of mantra, and he recited and recited it again and again for the old monk, and taught me that my head hurts and hurts. Isn't that why you hurt me?"" The Bodhisattva smiled and said, ""You monkey! You don't obey the teaching orders. If you don't restrict you in this way, you will lie and deceive the sky again, and you will not know the good or the bad! If there is a misfortune in the past, who will take care of it? Only if you have this devil, you will be willing to join my yoga. The doorway!"" The traveler said: ""This matter is my devil, why did you send that sinful dragon here to become a spirit and teach him to eat my master's horse? This is again. It is too unkind to let bad people do evil!"" The Bodhisattva said, ""I personally played the Jade Emperor, and asked him to be here for the sake of those who seek scriptures. You think about the mortal horses from the East, How did you get to this thousand waters and thousands of mountains? How did you get to Naling Mountain and Buddha Land? You have to get this dragon and horse before you go there."" The traveler said, ""I am so afraid of the old grandson as he is, and I can't hide it. What can I do?"" The Bodhisattva called Jie Di said: ""Go to the stream and call 'Aorun Dragon King Yulong Third Prince, come out, there is Nanhai Bodhisattva here.' He came out."" Najie Diguo went to the stream and called twice. The little dragon jumped over the waves, jumped out of the water, turned into a human elephant, stepped on the head of the cloud, and went into the air to pay homage to the Bodhisattva and said, ""I have been blessed by the Bodhisattva for liberation and life. The Bodhisattva pointed at the traveler and said, ""Isn't this the great apprentice of the person who took the scriptures?"" Xiaolong saw it and said, ""Bodhisattva, this is my opponent. I was hungry yesterday, and I ate his horse. He leaned on some strength. , he fought me back with cowardice, and he scolded me so that I did not dare to come out, and he never mentioned a word of learning from the scriptures."" The traveler said:","The Bodhisattva said, “What have you come for?” “The Tang Monk lost his horse at the Eagle Grief Stream of the Serpent Coil Mountain,” said the Guardian, “and the Great Sage Sun was placed in a terrible dilemma. He questioned the local deities, who claimed that a dragon sent by the Bodhisattva to that stream had eaten it. The Great Sage, therefore, sent me to request the Bodhisattva to go and subdue that cursed dragon, so that he might get back his horse.” Hearing this, the Bodhisattva said, “That creature was originally the son of Aorun of the Western Ocean. Because in his carelessness he set fire to the palace and destroyed the luminous pearls hanging there, his father accused him of subversion, and he was condemned to die by the Heavenly Tribunal. It was I who personally sought pardon from the Jade Emperor for him, so that he might serve as a means of transportation for the Tang Monk. I can’t understand how he could swallow the monk’s horse instead. But if that’s what happened, I’ll have to get over there myself.” The Bodhisattva left her lotus platform and went out of the divine cave. Mounting the auspicious luminosity with the Guardian, she crossed the South Sea. We have a testimonial poem that says: Buddha proclaimed the Tripitaka Supreme Which the Goddess declared throughout Chang’an: Those great, wondrous truths could reach Heaven and Earth; Those wise, true words could save the spirits damned. They caused Gold Cicada to cast again his shell. They moved Xuanzang to mend his ways anew. By blocking his path at Eagle Grief Stream, A dragon-prince in horse-form returns to the Real. The Bodhisattva and the Guardian soon arrived at the Serpent Coil Mountain. They stopped the hallowed clouds in midair and saw Pilgrim Sun down below, shouting abuses at the bank of the stream. The Bodhisattva asked the Guardian to fetch him. Lowering his clouds, the Guardian went past Tripitaka and headed straight for the edge of the stream, saying to Pilgrim, “The Bodhisattva has arrived.” When Pilgrim heard this, he jumped quickly into the air and yelled at her: “You, so-called Teacher of the Seven Buddhas and the Founder of the Faith of Mercy! Why did you have to use your tricks to harm me?” “You impudent stableman, ignorant red-buttocks!” said the Bodhisattva. “I went to considerable effort to find a scripture pilgrim, whom I carefully instructed to save your life. Instead of thanking me, you are finding fault with me!” “You saved me all right!” said Pilgrim. “If you truly wanted to deliver me, you should have allowed me to have a little fun with no strings attached. When you met me the other day above the ocean, you could have chastened me with a few words, telling me to serve the Tang Monk with diligence, and that would have been enough. Why did you have to give him a flower cap, and have him deceive me into wearing it so that I would suffer? Now the fillet has taken root on old Monkey’s head. And you even taught him this so-called ‘Tight-Fillet Spell,’ which he recites again and again, causing endless pain in my head! You haven’t harmed me, indeed!” The Bodhisattva laughed and said, “O, Monkey! You are neither attentive to admonition nor willing to seek the fruit of truth. If you are not restrained like this, you’ll probably mock the authority of Heaven again without regard for good or ill. If you create troubles as you did before, who will be able to control you? It’s only through this bit of adversity that you will be willing to enter our gate of Yoga.” “All right,” said Pilgrim, “I’ll consider the matter my hard luck. But why did you take that condemned dragon and send him here so that he could become a spirit and swallow my master’s horse? It’s your fault, you know, if you allow an evildoer to perpetrate his villainies some more!” “I went personally to plead with the Jade Emperor,” said the Bodhisattva, “to have the dragon stationed here so that he could serve as a means of transportation for the scripture pilgrim. Those mortal horses from the Land of the East, do you think that they could walk through ten thousand waters and a thousand hills? How could they possibly hope to reach the Spirit Mountain, the land of Buddha? Only a dragon-horse could make that journey!” “But right now he’s so terribly afraid of me,” said Pilgrim, “that he refuses to come out of his hiding place. What can we do?” The Bodhisattva said to the Guardian, “Go to the edge of the stream and say, ‘Come out, Third Prince Jade Dragon of the Dragon King Aorun. The Bodhisattva from South Sea is here.’ He’ll come out then.” The Guardian went at once to the edge of the stream and called out twice. Churning the waters and leaping across the waves, the little dragon appeared and changed at once into the form of a man. He stepped on the clouds and rose up into the air; saluting the Bodhisattva, he said, “I thank the Bodhisattva again for saving my life. I’ve waited here a long time, but I’ve heard no news of the scripture pilgrim.” Pointing to Pilgrim, the Bodhisattva said, “Isn’t he the eldest disciple of the scripture pilgrim?” When he saw him, the little dragon said, “Bodhisattva, he’s my adversary. I was hungry yesterday and ate his horse. We fought over that, but he took advantage of his superior strength and defeated me; in fact, he so abused me that I dared not show myself again. But he has never mentioned a word about scripture seeking.” “You didn’t bother to ask my name,” said Pilgrim.","The Great Immortal smiled and said, “You, holy monk, have only arrived this year. I was misled by Guanyin, who informed me ten years ago, that she had received Buddha’s command to go to the East and find a man, who should come to India and fetch the Sacred Scriptures. I therefore expected you would have arrived in two or three years. I have been waiting for you every year, but have never received any news till now.” The Master put his palms together and said, “Many thanks for all your kind thoughts.” Then the four pilgrims, their horse and baggage, were taken into the mansion, and each of the disciples was introduced to the Great Immortal. Tea and refreshments were ordered for them, and a young monk was ordered to prepare a fragrant bath for the pilgrims, before they ascended the Spiritual Mountain. When your work is done, then cleanse yourself, Train your spirit in harmony with nature, Then you may disregard all troubles. By seeking the three refuges, and the eight commandments, you begin a new life. When the demons are conquered, then you reach the land of Buddha. When struggles cease, you can join the happy few, All impurity is washed away And you attain the original perfection and incorruptibility. When the pilgrims had finished their bath, it was evening, and they rested in the Taoist mansion. Next morning the Master changed his clothes, put on his beautiful cassock, and his miter, and took in his hand the silver staff. He then entered the hall, and there made obeisance to the Great Immortal, who said, “Let me show you the way.” Sun said, “I know the way. We must not trouble you.” The Great Immortal replied, “You might know the way through the air, but you have never trodden this way on foot. Your Master has not yet traveled by the clouds, and therefore you should follow the road.” Sun said, “What you say is true, kindly show us the way. My Master desires with all his heart to see Buddha. Have no doubt about that.” The Great Immortal smiled, took the hand of the Master and led him on, burning sandalwood incense. “By this way one does not go outside the mansion gate, but through the central hall and out at the back gate.” The Great Immortal pointed to the Spiritual Mountain, and said, “Your Reverence, half way up the sky you see beautiful light of all colors shining forth in a thousand rays. That is the top of the Spiritual Mountain, where Buddha dwells.” At this sight the Master was going to worship. But Sun laughed and said, “Master, you have not yet arrived at the place of worship. The place to dismount and worship is still some distance off. If you begin to kowtow now, you will have too many obeisances to make.” The Great Immortal then said, “Holy monk and you three disciples, the Great Sage, the Celestial Fairy Chieftain, and the Celestial Chief of Pages have now arrived at the Blessed Land and can see the Spiritual Mountain. I shall now return.” The Master bade him farewell. The Great Sage led the other pilgrims, and they ascended gradually. Not more than two miles distant, they saw a stream of living water rolling down with high waves. It was about three miles wide, with no sign of roads anywhere leading to it. The Master was surprised and said to Sun Wukong, “The Great Immortal must have shown us the wrong way by mistake. This water is so wide and strong, and I see no ferry boats, how can we get across it?” Sun smiled and said, “No, the Great Immortal made no mistake. Do you not see there is a great bridge? We must cross the river by that bridge.” When the Master and his disciples came near it, there was a tablet on the bridge with these words “Cloud Ferry.” It was a single tree across the river. From afar it was like a beam across the sky, Near by, it seemed a rotten broken tree trunk. It was narrow and slippery and dizzy to cross, By this the gods trod over the brilliant clouds.","“Mercy! Mercy!” he pleaded, rolling about in agony. “I’ve tried turning you to the good,” fumed Tripitaka, “yet you persist in beating people to death.” “But she was a monster.” “Absurd! You see monsters everywhere. You’re incorrigibly wicked. Be gone!” “All right, all right,” Monkey said. “Just one thing before I go, though.” “He wants his share of the luggage,” Pigsy sniped. “Fob him off with an old hat or shirt.” “Keep your snout out of it!” shouted Monkey, hopping up and down in a fury. “I haven’t known a moment’s covetousness since I swore my Buddhist oath of poverty. I don’t want anything to do with the rotten luggage.” “So what is it, then?” asked Tripitaka. “Five centuries ago, I was the overlord of seventy-two cave monsters and forty-seven thousand lesser fiends. I cut quite a figure, with my purple-gold crown, my ocher robe, my jade belt, my cloud-hopping shoes, and my staff. But now that I’ve got this gold hoop stuck on my head, I’m embarrassed to face my old associates. As one last act of kindness, could you remove the hoop and put it on someone else’s head?” “But Guanyin taught me only the Tight Hoop Spell; she never mentioned any Loose Hoop Spell.” “In that case,” said Monkey, sighing, “you’d better keep me with you.” So Tripitaka decided to forgive him one more time. “But this time, no more violence.” “Absolutely!” Monkey assured Tripitaka, helping him back onto the horse and leading the way forward. Back to the fiend, now, who had somehow escaped Monkey’s second strike and was still hovering overhead, exclaiming at Monkey’s acumen. “Those monks are moving westward fast and will be out of my power in another forty miles. If another monster succeeds in capturing them where I failed, I’ll be a laughingstock. Let’s have one more go at them.” She descended to another dip in the mountain out of sight of the travelers and this time disguised herself as an old man, with long white hair and a beard, chanting a sutra as he walked toward Tripitaka and the others. “How pious the west is!” Tripitaka rejoiced at the sight of him. “I wouldn’t celebrate if I were you,” Pigsy warned him. “He’s coming after us because Monkey killed his daughter and his wife. You’ll be executed, I’ll be conscripted into the army, and Sandy will be condemned to hard labor. Of course, Monkey will slip away through some magic trick or other, leaving us to take the blame.” “Stop scaring Tripitaka, idiot,” Monkey told him. “Leave this to me.” Concealing his staff, he walked up to the monster. “Where are you going, sir? And why are you reciting sutras?” Here the monster miscalculated: she thought she’d finally fooled Monkey. Out she came with her subterfuge: “This is my ancestral home. I have spent my life doing good works and feeding mendicant monks, and reading and reciting the sutras. I sent my daughter to deliver food to my son-in-law in the fields this morning, but I fear she was waylaid by a tiger. My wife, who went out looking for her, has not returned either. I came to look for them both. If they are dead, I must gather their bones for burial in the family grave.” Our hero laughed mirthlessly. “You’ve picked the wrong monkey to monkey with today, fiend!” He now mulled his options: To smash or not to smash, he pondered. That is the question. If I don’t smash her, she’ll carry on with her tricks. If I do smash her, Master will recite that headache sutra again. Then again, if I don’t smash her she’ll find a chance to capture Master and then I’ll have to rescue him, with no end of trouble to myself . . . . Hmmm, best to smash her. I’ll find a way to talk Tripitaka around.","“What have you come for?” the Bodhisattva asked. “The Tang Priest,” the Revealer replied, “has lost his horse in the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge, and the Great Sage Sun Wukong is desperate, because they can neither go forward nor back. When the Great Sage asked the local deity he was told that the evil dragon you sent to the ravine, Bodhisattva, had swallowed it, so he has sent me to ask you to subdue this dragon and make it give back the horse.” “That wretched creature was the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea, whom his father reported for disobedience when he burned the palace jewels. The heavenly court condemned him to death for it, but I went myself to see the Jade Emperor and asked him to send the dragon down to serve the Tang Priest as a beast of burden. Whatever made it actually eat the Tang Priest's horse? I'd better go and look into it.” The Bodhisattva descended from her lotus throne, left her magic cave, and crossed the Southern Sea, travelling on propitious light with the Revealer. There is a poem about it that goes: Honey is in the Buddha's words that fill Three Stores of scripture, The Bodhisattva's goodness is longer than the Great Wall. The wonderful words of the Mahayana fill Heaven and Earth, The truth of the prajna rescues ghosts and souls. It even made the Golden Cicada shed his cocoon once more, And ordered Xuanzang to continue cultivating his conduct. Because the road was difficult at the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge, The dragon's son returned to the truth and changed into a horse. The Bodhisattva and the Revealer reached the Coiled Snake Mountain before long, and stopping their cloud in mid-air they looked down and saw Brother Monkey cursing and shouting at the edge of the ravine. When the Bodhisattva told him to call Monkey over, the Revealer brought his cloud to land at the edge of the ravine. Instead of going to see Sanzang first, he said to Monkey, “The Bodhisattva's here.” Monkey leapt straight into the air on his cloud and shouted at her at the top of his voice, “Teacher of the Seven Buddhas, merciful head of our religion, why did you think up this way of hurting me?” “I'll get you, you outrageous baboon, you red-bottomed ape,” she replied. “I was at my wit's end two or three times over how to fetch that pilgrim, and I told him to save your life. But far from coming to thank me for saving you, you now have the effrontery to bawl at me.” “You've been very good to me, I must say,” retorted Monkey. “If you'd let me out to roam around enjoying myself as I pleased, that would have been fine. I was all right when you met me above the sea the other day, spoke a few unkind words, and told me to do all I could to help the Tang Priest. But why did you give him that hat he tricked me into wearing to torture me with? Why did you make this band grow into my head? Why did you teach him that Band-tightening Spell? Why did you make that old monk recite it over and over again so that my head ached and ached? You must be wanting to do me in.” The Bodhisattva smiled. “You monkey. You don't obey the commands of the faith, and you won't accept the true reward, so if you weren't under control like this you might rebel against Heaven again or get up to any kind of evil. If you got yourself into trouble as you did before, who would look after you? Without this monstrous head, you'd never be willing to enter our Yogacatin faith.” “Very well then,” Monkey replied, “let's call this object my monstrous head. But why did you send that criminal and evil dragon to become a monster here and eat my master's horse? Letting evil creatures out to run amuck like that is a bad deed.” “I personally asked the Jade Emperor to put the dragon here as a mount for the pilgrim,” said the Bodhisattva. “Do you think an ordinary horse would be able to cross the thousands of mountains and rivers to reach the Buddha-land on the Vulture Peak? Only a dragon horse will be able to do it.” “But he's so afraid of me that he's skulking down there and won't come out, so what's to be done?” Monkey asked. The Bodhisattva told the Revealer to go to the edge of the ravine and shout, “Come out, Prince Jade Dragon, son of the Dragon King Ao Run, to see the Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea,” after which the offspring would emerge. The Revealer went to the edge of the gorge and shouted this twice, immediately the young dragon leapt up through the waves, took human form, stepped on a cloud, and greeted the Bodhisattva in mid-air. “In my gratitude to you, Bodhisattva, for saving my life, I have been waiting here for a long time, but I have had no news yet of the pilgrim who is going to fetch the scriptures.” The Bodhisattva pointed to Brother Monkey and said, “Isn't he the pilgrim's great disciple?” “He's my enemy,” the young dragon replied when he looked at him. “I ate his horse yesterday because I was starving, so he used some powers of his to fight me till I returned exhausted and terrified, then swore at me so that I had to shut myself in, too frightened to come out. He never said a word about anyone fetching scriptures.” “You never asked me my name, so how could I have told you?”"
第九回,the ninth,TEN,His master had a daughter twenty years of age.,Xuanzang was sent to the Temple of Immense Blessings to continue his religious studies.,Chapter 10
八戒道：“哥啊，不要说打，打就是以力欺人。我晓得你的尊性高傲，你是定不肯挑；但师父骑的马，那般高大肥盛，只驮着老和尚一个，教他带几件儿，也是弟兄之情。”行者道：“你说他是马哩！他不是凡马，本是西海龙王敖闰之子，唤名龙马三太子。,"Bajie said: ""Brother, don't say beating, beating is to deceive others by force. I know your dignity and arrogance, you will definitely not choose; but the horse that Master rides is so tall and fat, only the old monk is on the back. One, teach him to bring a few pieces, which is also a brotherhood."" The walker said: ""You said he is Ma Li! He is not a fanma, but he was originally the son of Aorun, the Dragon King of the West Sea, and was called the Third Prince of Longma.","“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “don’t mention whipping, for that only means taking advantage of others by brute force. I realize that you have a proud and haughty nature, and you are not about to pole the luggage. But look how fat and strong the horse is that Master is riding: he’s only carrying one old monk. Make him take a few pieces of luggage, for the sake of fraternal sentiment!” “So you think he’s a horse!” said Pilgrim. “He’s no earthly horse, for he is originally the son of Aorun, the Dragon King of the Western Ocean.",,"Lingji urged him. “Jade-Cloud is that way, to the northwest.” After an instant’s cloud-somersaulting, Monkey was back at Iron-Fan’s door, banging on it with his staff. “Open up! Monkey wants the fan!”","“Don't threaten me with a beating, brother,” said Pig, “that would be bullying. I know that you're too high and mighty to carry the luggage, but the master's horse is a big, sturdy animal to be carrying only one old monk. I'd be very happy if it could carry a few pieces of luggage.” “Do you think he's a horse?” Monkey asked. “He's no ordinary horse. He was the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea, and his name is Prince Dragon-horse."
不要错怪了人。”清风道：“你虽不曾吃，还有手下人要偷吃的哩。”三藏道：“这等也说得是，你且莫嚷，等我问他们看。果若是偷了，教他赔你。”明月道：“赔呀！就有钱那里去买？”三藏道：“纵有钱没处买呵，常言道，仁义值千金。教他陪你个礼，便罢了。也还不知是他不是他哩。”明月道：“怎的不是他？他那里分不均，还在那里嚷哩。”三藏叫声：“徒弟，且都来。”沙僧听见道：“不好了！决撒了！老师父叫我们，小道童胡厮骂，不是旧话儿走了风，却是甚的？”行者道：“活羞杀人！这个不过是饮食之类。若说出来，就是我们偷嘴了，只是莫认。”八戒道：“正是，正是，昧了罢。”他三人只得出了厨房，走上殿去。咦！毕竟不知怎么与他抵赖，且听下回分解。,"Don't blame people. ""Qingfeng said: ""Although you have never eaten, there are still people who want to steal it. ""Sanzang said:"" This is also true, you don't shout, wait until I ask them to see. If it is stolen, teach him to compensate you. ""Mingyue said:"" Compensate! Do you have the money to buy it? ""Sanzang said: ""Even if you have money, there is nowhere to buy it, as the saying goes, benevolence and righteousness are worth a thousand dollars. Teach him to accompany you a courtesy, that's all. I don't even know if it's him or not. ""Mingyue said:"" Why not him? He was unevenly divided, and he was still there. Sanzang shouted: ""Apprentice, come here."" ""Sha Monk heard: ""Not good!"" It's over! The teacher and the father called us, and the little Daotong scolded us. It's not that the old saying goes away, but what is it? ""Walker said:"" Shame to kill! It's just food and so on. If we say it, we are stealing our mouths, but don't admit it. ""Bajie said: ""It is, it is, it is ignorant. ""The three of them only got out of the kitchen and walked up to the palace. Hey! After all, I don't know how to deny him, let's hear the breakdown next time.","Don’t blame the wrong person.” “You might not have eaten them,” said Clear Breeze, “but your followers wanted to steal them and eat them.” “Perhaps you are right,” said Tripitaka, “but there’s no need for you to shout. Let me ask them. If they have stolen them, I will ask them to repay you.” “Repay!” said Bright Moon. “You couldn’t buy these fruits even if you had the money!” “If they can’t buy them with money,” said Tripitaka, “they can at least offer you an apology, for as the proverb says, ‘Righteousness is worth a thousand pieces of gold.’ That should be sufficient. Moreover, we are still not sure whether it is my disciples who took your fruits.” “What do you mean, not sure?” said Bright Moon. “They were arguing among themselves, saying something about the portions not being equally divided.” “Disciples,” cried Tripitaka, “come, all of you.” When Sha Monk heard this, he said, “It’s terrible! We’ve been discovered! Old master is calling us, and the Daoist lads are making all this racket. They must have found out!” “It is extremely embarrassing!” said Pilgrim. “This is just a matter of food and drink. But if we say so, that means we are stealing for our mouths! Let’s not admit it.” “Yes! Yes!” said Eight Rules. “Let’s deny it!” The three of them had no choice, however, but to leave the kitchen for the main hall. Alas, we do not know how they would be able to deny the charges; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.",,"To one side a golden lock—some fifteen inches long—was suspended over a tiny flame, which was barely singeing the lock’s very substantial key. “What does all this mean?” Monkey asked. “After the prefect’s transgression against Heaven,” the preceptors explained, “the Jade Emperor ruled that there will be no rain until the chicken has pecked all the rice, the dog has lapped up all the noodles, and the flame has burned through the lock.” Even Monkey paled at the size of the tasks and exited the hall, too crestfallen to press the Jade Emperor again. “Take heart,” the preceptors comforted him. “Virtue will overcome these challenges and melt Heaven’s anger.” Monkey cloud-traveled back to India to confront the prefect. “You are the cause of your people’s suffering! Three years ago you fed offerings to Heaven to your dogs. What were you thinking?” The prefect instantly kneeled before him. “It’s true. That day, I’d had an argument with my wife—she started it—and in a fury I smashed the offerings to the floor and let the dogs eat them up. I’ve felt terrible about it ever since. And now Heaven is punishing my people for it!” “The Jade Emperor has established three monuments to your crime,” Monkey told him, evoking the two starchy mountains—and their lethargic consumers—and the lock, all of which needed to be vanquished before rain would return. Pigsy’s eyes lit up, for this was his favorite kind of impossible challenge. “Leave it to me— I’ll polish off the rice and noodles in a single sitting, smash the lock, and there’s your rain!” “No, Pigsy,” Monkey chided him.","What do you mean by making so unjust an accusation?” “Although you didn't eat any,” said Pure Wind, “those underlings of yours stole and ate some.” “Even if they did, you shouldn't shout like that. Wait till I've questioned them. If they stole some, I'll see that they make it up to you.” “Make it up?” said Bright Moon. “They are things that money can't buy.” “Well then,” said Sanzang, “if money won't buy them, 'decent behavior is worth a thousand pieces of gold,' as the saying goes. I'll make them apologize to you, and that will be that. Besides, we still don't know whether they did it.” “Of course they did,” retorted Bright Moon. “They're still quarrelling in there because they were divided unfairly.” “Come here, disciples,” called Sanzang. “We've had it,” said Friar Sand when he heard Sanzang calling. “The game's up. Our master is calling us and the young Taoists are swearing and cursing. The cat must be out of the bag.” “How disgraceful,” said Monkey, “all that fuss about some food. But if we confess it, they'll say it was stealing food; the best thing is not to admit it at all.” “Quite right, quite right, we'll cover it up,” said Pig, and three of them went from the kitchen to the hall. If you don't know how they denied it, listen to the explanation in the next installment."
这泾河龙王也不回水府，只在空中，等到子时前后，收了云头，敛了雾角，径来皇宫门首。此时唐王正梦出宫门之外，步月花阴，忽然龙王变作人相，上前跪拜。口叫“陛下，救我！救我！”,"This Jinghe Dragon King did not return to the water house, but was only in the air. After waiting around Zi Shi, he closed the cloud head and the fog horns, and walked straight to the gate of the palace. At this time, Tang Wang was dreaming outside the palace gate, walking in the shadow of the moon and flowers, and suddenly the Dragon King changed into a human figure and stepped forward to kneel and worship. ""Your Majesty, save me! Save me!""","Our Dragon King of the Jing River did not even return to his water home; he waited in the air until it was about the hour of the Rat,26 when he descended from the clouds and mists and came to the gate of the palace. At this time the Tang emperor was just having a dream about taking a walk outside the palace in the moonlight, beneath the shades of flowers. The Dragon suddenly assumed the form of a human being and went up to him. Kneeling, he cried out, “Your Majesty, save me, save me!”","Every season of the eight abounds with fresh dainties, Every night we rest in warm embrace. How much better than to travel in search of Amitabha! The Master replied, “Yes, that is true, but our life has also its advantages.” The vows a monk makes are uncommon. They give up their gracious homes,","The dragon king tearfully hovered over Chang’an until midnight, then came to land near the gate of the palace just in time to encounter the emperor as a mirage—for Taizong was dreaming at that very moment that he was taking a moonlight walk outside the palace. The dragon king kneeled before him. “Save me, Your Majesty!","The Dragon King of the River Jing did not return to his watery palace but stayed in the sky until the small hours of the morning, when he put away his cloud and his mist horn, and went straight to the gate of the Imperial Palace. At this very moment the Tang Emperor dreamt that he went out of the palace gate to stroll among the flowers in the moonlight. The dragon king at once took human form, went up to him and knelt and bowed before him, crying, “Save me, Your Majesty, save me.” “Who are you, that we should save you?” asked Taizong."
小姐道：“吾闻妇人从一而终。痛夫已被贼人所杀，岂可靦颜从贼？止因遗腹在身，只得忍耻偷生。今幸儿已长大，又见老父提兵报仇，为女儿者，有何面目相见！惟有一死以报丈夫耳！”,"The lady said: ""I heard that the woman died from the beginning. The husband has been killed by the thief, how can you be shy and follow the thief? Only because of the posthumous body, I have to endure the shame of stealing my life. Now that the fortunate son has grown up, I see the old father mentioning it again. Soldiers take revenge for their daughters, what face will they see! Only one death to avenge her husband's ear!""","“I have heard,” said the lady, “that a woman follows her spouse to the grave. My husband was murdered by this bandit, causing me dreadful grief. How could I yield so shamefully to the thief? The child I was carrying—that was my sole lease on life that helped me bear my humiliation! Now that my son is grown and my old father has led troops to avenge our wrong, I who am the daughter have little face left for my reunion. I can only die to repay my husband!”","The Monkey said, “Let me show my Master’s robe.” The Master whispered to the Monkey that it was dangerous to excite their cupidity by showing it. At the sight of the robe, brilliant with all the colors of the rainbow, the abbot was bent on stealing it. One monk, named Great Knowledge, said, “The travelers are now asleep. They are only two, let us all arm ourselves, and kill them, and the precious cassock will be the abbot’s.” Another monk, named the Great Schemer, said, “That is not a good plan, for it will mean some difficulty.","“A widow should join her husband in death,” she sorrowed. “After my husband was murdered, I had to yield to his murderer. Only thoughts of my child kept me alive. But now that my son is grown and my father has taken revenge on this murderer, how can I face my family? I must die, for my husband’s sake.” “None of this was your fault,” reasoned her father.","“They say that a woman should only have one husband in her life,” she said to them. “I was bitterly grieved at the death of my husband at that brigand's hands, and could not bear the disgrace of marrying his murderer; but as I was carrying my husband's child I had to swallow the shame of staying alive. Now, thank goodness, my son has grown up and my father has brought an army to avenge my husband but how could I have the face to see you. The only way I can make up for it to my husband is to kill myself.”"
猴王参访仙道，无缘得遇。在于南赡部洲，串长城，游小县，不觉八九年馀。忽行至西洋大海，他想着海外必有神仙。独自个依前作筏，又飘过西海，直至西牛贺洲地界。登岸偏访多时，忽见一座高山秀丽，林麓幽深。他也不怕狼虫，不惧虎豹，登山顶上观看。果是好山：,"The Monkey King visited Xiandao, but was not lucky enough to meet him. It lies in Nanshabuzhou, strung along the Great Wall, and traveled to small counties for more than eight or nine years. Suddenly walking to the western ocean, he thought that there must be immortals overseas. He made a raft by himself, and floated across the West Sea to the boundary of Xiniu Hezhou. After visiting the shore for a long time, I suddenly saw a beautiful mountain and a deep forest. He is also not afraid of wolves, tigers and leopards, and watched from the top of the mountain. Fruit is a good mountain:","The Monkey King searched diligently for the way of immortality, but he had no chance of meeting it. Going through big cities and visiting small towns, he unwittingly spent eight or nine years on the South Jambūdvīpa Continent before he suddenly came upon the Great Western Ocean. He thought that there would certainly be immortals living beyond the ocean; so, having built himself a raft like the previous one, he once again drifted across the Western Ocean until he reached the West Aparagodānīya Continent. After landing, he searched for a long time, when all at once he came upon a tall and beautiful mountain with thick forests at its base. Since he was afraid neither of wolves and lizards nor of tigers and leopards, he went straight to the top to look around. It was indeed a magnificent mountain: A thousand peaks stand like rows of spears,","None desiring to repent. The Monkey King, having no luck in his search for the way of the Immortals, and having spent eight or nine years in vain, suddenly came to the great Western Ocean, where he thought beyond the sea must be the home of the Immortals. Then he got on a raft as before, and sailed as far as the borders of the Western continent, where he landed and searched for a long time. Suddenly he saw a high mountain most beautiful, covered with forest and jungle. Fearing no wolves, snakes, tigers, or leopards, he went straight to the mountaintop.","Monkey remained determined to seek the formula for eternal life, while the humans who surrounded him sought only money and fame, without a thought for their own mortality; no one cared what became of him. Eventually, Monkey came to the Western Ocean. Still in search of immortals, he built himself another raft and floated across to the western continent. In time, he approached a beautiful, jagged mountain, thickly forested at its base and luxuriant with flowers, grasses, mosses, bamboo, and pines—an ideal hermit’s refuge.","Although he asked about the way of the Immortals, the Monkey King was unable to meet one. He spent eight or nine years in the Southern Jambu Continent, going through its great walls and visiting its little counties. When he found that he had reached the Great Western Ocean he thought that there must be Sages and Immortals on the other side of it, so he made himself another raft like the last one, and floated across the Western Ocean until he came to the Western Continent of Cattle-gift. He went ashore and made extensive and lengthy enquiries until one day he came upon a high and beautiful mountain, thickly forested on its lower slopes. Not fearing wolves, and undaunted by tigers or leopards, he climbed to the summit to see the view. It was indeed a fine mountain:"
炮云起处荡乾坤，黑雾阴霾大地昏。江海波翻鱼蟹怕，山林树折虎狼奔。,"Clouds of cannons swirled everywhere, and the earth was darkened with black fog and haze. Jiang Haibo is afraid of turning over fish and crabs, and the mountains and trees are broken and wolves run.","It was truly terrifying: Thick clouds in vast formation moved o’er the world; Black fog and dusky vapor darkened the Earth; Waves churned in seas and rivers, affrighting fishes and crabs; Boughs broke in mountain forests, wolves and tigers taking flight.","He pronounced an incantation and drew in his breath, and then blew it out. Then there arose a tremendous cyclone blowing sand and stones, and the people of Aolai were so terrified that they shut their doors, as none dare stay outside.","Making a sign and reciting a spell, he inhaled deeply, then blew out a gale that scoured the city with a sandstorm. Rulers and subjects fled inside their houses and bolted their doors shut.",Where the thunderclouds rise the elements are in chaos; Black fogs thick with dust cloak the earth in darkness.

怪物闻言，连声喏喏，收了宝杖，让木吒揪了去见观音。纳头下拜，告道：“菩萨，恕我之罪，待我诉告。我不是妖邪，我是灵霄殿下侍銮舆的卷帘大将。只因在蟋桃会上，失手打碎了玻璃盏，玉帝把我打了八百，贬下界来，变得这般模样；又教七日一次，将飞剑来穿我胸胁百余下方回，故此这般苦恼。没奈何，饥寒难忍，三二日间，出波涛寻一个行人食用。不期今日无知，冲撞了大慈菩萨。”菩萨道：“你在天有罪，既贬下来，今又这等伤生，正所谓罪上加罪。我今领了佛旨．上东上寻取经人。你何不入我门来，皈依善果，跟那取经人做个徒弟，上西天拜佛求经？我教飞剑不来穿你。那时节功成免罪，复你本职，心下如何？”,"Hearing the words, the monster kept shouting, took the treasure staff, and let Mu Zha grab it and go to see Guanyin. Natou bowed down and said: ""Bodhisattva, forgive my sins and wait for me to tell you. I am not a demon, I am the general of the roller blinds serving Luanyu under His Royal Highness Lingxiao. It was only because I accidentally broke the glass at the Cricket Fair. Zhan, the Jade Emperor beat me eight hundred times and demoted me to the realm, so I became like this; he taught me once every seven days to pierce the flying sword through my chest and back more than a hundred times, so I was so distressed. Forbearance, in three or two days, I went out of the waves to find a pedestrian to eat. Unexpectedly today, I was ignorant and collided with the Great Merciful Bodhisattva."" The Bodhisattva said: ""You have sins in the sky. Sin. I have received the decree of the Buddha now. Go to the east to seek the scriptures. Why don't you come to my door, take refuge in the good fruit, become a disciple with the scriptures, and go to the west to worship the Buddha to seek scriptures? I teach Feijian not to penetrate you. At that time, Jiedong was exonerated and returned to your job, how do you feel?""","When the monster heard these words, he apologized repeatedly. Putting away his staff, he allowed Mokṣa to grasp him by the collar and lead him away. He lowered his head and bowed low to Guanyin, saying, “Bodhisattva, please forgive me and let me submit my explanation. I am no monster; rather, I am the Curtain-Raising General who waits upon the phoenix chariot of the Jade Emperor at the Divine Mists Hall. Because I carelessly broke a crystal cup at one of the Festivals of Immortal Peaches, the Jade Emperor gave me eight hundred lashes, banished me to the Region Below, and changed me into my present shape. Every seventh day he sends a flying sword to stab my breast and side more than a hundred times before it leaves me. Hence my present wretchedness! Moreover, the hunger and cold are unbearable, and I am driven every few days to come out of the waves and find a traveler for food. I certainly did not expect that my ignorance would today lead me to offend the great, merciful Bodhisattva.” “Because of your sin in Heaven,” said the Bodhisattva, “you were banished. Yet the taking of life in your present manner surely is adding sin to sin. By the decree of Buddha, I am on my way to the Land of the East to find a scripture pilgrim. Why don’t you come into my fold, take refuge in good works, and follow the scripture pilgrim as his disciple when he goes to the Western Heaven to ask Buddha for the scriptures? I’ll order the flying sword to stop piercing you. At the time when you achieve merit, your sin will be expiated and you will be restored to your former position. How do you feel about that?”","In this dilemma, when none of his Ministers or Doctors could heal or save him, Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, came with her jar of water and sprig of willow and made the Dragon King’s head grow on his body again, and the emperor was no more haunted. But the emperor’s illness grew worse, and when he was on the verge of death, the Minister of Justice sent a letter to a friend of his, Judge Cui, through whose influence the emperor might return and resume his duties on earth again. A hundred years run like a stream, And all our affairs float on top of it. Yesterday we were as beautiful as peach blossoms, Today we are snowflakes floating by. Like fighting ants our struggles are but dreams. Listen to the bird’s call to repentance. From of old life can be prolonged. Those who seek not self are perfected by Heaven. It is said that the spirit of Taizong mysteriously passed in front of the Five Phoenix Gate, where a host of horsemen invited the emperor to go out for a hunting expedition. Taizong was delighted and went with them.","Hearing this, the fiend could not apologize enough. Putting away his staff, he allowed Hui’an to apprehend him and take him over to Guanyin. “Forgive me,” he begged, bowing. “I was once the General of Curtain-Drawing in the Hall of Divine Mists. Because I carelessly broke a crystal cup one Peach Festival, the Jade Emperor punished me with eight hundred lashes, banished me to earth, and changed me into my present form. Every seventh day, he sends a flying sword to pierce my torso over a hundred times. It wears a person out. That’s why I’m a little highly strung. And the cold and hunger are so unbearable that every couple of days, I have to come out to eat a passerby. Fancy meeting you in a place like this!” “You were banished here,” Guanyin replied, “because of the crime you committed in Heaven. And now you’re just making things worse by eating people. Look, the Buddha’s sent me to the Land of the East to find a pilgrim to seek scriptures from the Western Heaven. Why don’t you join the mission—become the pilgrim’s disciple on his journey to the west? I’ll have a word with the flying sword to leave you alone. If you complete the pilgrimage, you’ll atone for your crime and can go back to your old job in Heaven. What do you say?”","When the ogre heard this he chanted “na-a-aw” several times to show his respect, withdrew his pole and let Moksa seize it. Then he bowed to Guanyin and said, “Forgive me, Bodhisattva, and listen to what I have to tell you. I am not a demon, but the Curtain Raising General who used to stand in attendance by the imperial chariot in the Hall of Miraculous Mist. Just because I accidentally smashed a crystal dish at a Peach Banquet the Jade Emperor had me given eight hundred strokes of the rod, exiled me to the lower world, and made me look like this. And on top of it all every seven days he sends a flying sword here to stab my chest over a hundred times before it goes back again. It's agony. I get so unbearably cold and hungry that I have to emerge from the waves every two or three days to devour a traveler. I never thought that in my ignorance I would insult the merciful Bodhisattva today.” “You were exiled here for a crime against Heaven, but now you are deepening your guilt by harming living beings. I am now going to the East on the Buddha's orders to find the man who will fetch the scriptures. Why don't you become one of us and ensure yourself good retribution in future by accompanying the pilgrim as a disciple and ascending to the Western Heaven to pay homage to the Buddha and seek the scriptures? I will see to it that the flying sword stops coming to pierce you, and when you are successful you will be forgiven your crimes and your old job will be given back to you. What do you think of that?”"
这行者，须臾间看见唐僧在路旁闷坐。他上前道：“师父！,"This traveler saw Tang Seng sitting sullenly by the roadside. He stepped forward and said, ""Master!","They finished speaking and each went on his way. In a moment, our Pilgrim saw the Tang Monk sitting dejectedly at the side of the road. He approached him and said, “Master, why are you not on the road?","Sun returned from heaven, and told the Prefect that repentance was necessary before Heaven would grant pardon. Then the Prefect and people vowed to repent, to repair to the temples, recite prayers, and worship Buddha with the monks.","Tripitaka asked the next morning. “Same as yesterday,” Monkey pronounced.","A moment later Monkey saw the Tang Priest sitting gloomily beside the path. He went up to him and said, “Why aren't you travelling, master?"
这去寻着袈裟，万事皆休；但恐找寻不着，我那徒弟性子有些不好，汝等性命不知如何，恐一人不能脱也。”众僧闻得此言，一个个提心吊胆，告天许愿，只要寻得袈裟，各全性命不题。,"I went to look for the cassock, and everything was over; but I feared that I could not find it. My apprentice is a little bit bad, and I don’t know what your life will be, and I fear that one will not be able to escape. ""When the monks heard this, they were all worried, and they made a wish to the heaven.","Let’s hope that he’ll find the cassock, and everything will be all right. But if not, I would fear for your lives; for that disciple of mine has a bad temper, and I’m afraid that none of you will escape him.” When the monks heard this, they were all panic-stricken; they pleaded with Heaven for the cassock to be found so that their lives would be preserved, but we shall say no more about them for the moment. We were telling you about the Great Sage Sun.",,"“Time for action. You two, take these boys into the city and throw them from a great height onto the ground in front of the throne. Tell anyone who asks that they’re Yellow-Robe’s sons.","If my disciple finds the cassock our troubles will all come to an end; but if he doesn't find it, he has rather a nasty temper and I'm afraid that none of you will escape with your lives.” When they heard this warning, the monks' hearts were in their mouths, and they implored Heaven to let him find the cassock and spare their lives."
行者却弄神通，摇身一变，变得就如那女子一般，独自个坐在房里等那妖精。不多时，一阵风来，真个是走石飞砂。好风：起初时微微荡荡，向后来渺渺茫茫。微微荡荡乾坤大，渺渺茫茫无阻碍。凋花折柳胜揌麻，倒树摧林如拔菜。翻江搅海鬼神愁，裂石崩山天地怪。衔花糜鹿失来踪，摘果猿猴迷在外。七层铁塔侵佛头，八面幢幡伤宝盖。金梁玉柱起根摇，房上瓦飞如燕块。举棹梢公许愿心，开船忙把猪羊赛。当坊土地弃祠堂，四海龙王朝上拜。海边撞损夜叉船，长城刮倒半边塞。那阵狂风过处，只见半空里来了一个妖精，果然生得丑陋：黑脸短毛，长喙大耳，穿一领青不青、蓝不蓝的梭布直裰，系一条花布手巾。行者暗笑道：“原来是这个买卖！”好行者，却不迎他，也不问他，且睡在床上推病，口里哼哼喷喷的不绝。那怪不识真假，走进房，一把搂住，就要亲嘴。行者暗笑道：“真个要来弄老孙哩！”即使个拿法，托着那怪的长嘴，叫做个小跌。漫头一料，扑的掼下床来。那怪爬起来，扶着床边道：“姐姐，你怎么今日有些怪我？想是我来得迟了？”行者道：“不怪！不怪！”那妖道：,"The walker, however, got magical powers and changed his body, becoming like that woman, sitting alone in the room waiting for the goblin. Not long after, a gust of wind came, and it was really like flying sand. Good wind: Slightly swaying at the beginning, and then indistinct. Slightly swaying across the universe, vague and unobstructed. Withered flowers and willows are better than hemp, and fallen trees and forests are like pulling vegetables. Overturning the river stirs the sea, ghosts and gods worry, cracking rocks and collapsing mountains are strange. The moose deer with the flower head disappeared, and the fruit-picking monkey was lost. The seven-story iron tower invaded the Buddha's head, and the eight-sided banners damaged the treasure cover. The golden beams and jade pillars start to shake, and the roof tiles fly like swallow blocks. Raising the heart of Shao Shao Gong's wish, he was busy racing pigs and sheep on the boat. When the land of Fangfang abandoned the ancestral hall, the dragon dynasty from all over the world came to worship. The seaside collided and damaged the Yaksha ship, and the Great Wall knocked down half of the fortress. As the gust of wind passed by, I saw a goblin in the air, and it was really ugly: black face with short hair, long beak and big ears, wearing a collar of green or blue cloth straight, and tied with a floral cloth handkerchief. The walker secretly smiled and said, ""It turned out to be this business!"" The good walker, however, did not welcome him or ask him any questions, and slept on the bed to push back his illness, humming incessantly. He didn't know the truth, he walked into the room, hugged him, and kissed him. The walker laughed secretly and said, ""He's really going to get the old grandson!"" After thinking about it, he fluttered out of bed. The monster got up, supported the bed and said, ""Sister, why are you blaming me today? I think I'm late?"" Walker said, ""No! No!"" The demon said:","Exercising his magic might, Pilgrim shook his body and changed at once into the form of that girl, sitting all by herself to wait for the monster. In a little while, a gust of wind swept by, kicking up dust and stones. What a wind! At first it was a breeze gentle and light. Thereafter it became gusty and strong. A light, gentle breeze that could fill the world! A strong, gusty wind that nothing else could stop! Flowers and willow snapped like shaken hemp; Trees and plants were felled like uprooted crops. It stirred up streams and seas, cowing ghosts and gods. It fractured rocks and mountains, awing Heaven and Earth. Flower-nibbling deer lost their homeward trail. Fruit-picking monkeys all were gone astray. The seven-tiered pagoda crashed on Buddha’s head. Flags on eight sides damaged the temple’s top. Gold beams and jade pillars were rooted up. Like flocks of swallow flew the roofing tiles. The boatman lifted his oars to make a vow, Eager to have his livestock sacrificed. The local spirit abandoned his shrine. Dragon kings from four seas made humble bows. At sea the ship of yakṣa ran aground, While half of Great Wall’s rampart was blown down. When the violent gust of wind had gone by, there appeared in midair a monster who was ugly indeed. With his black face covered with short, stubby hair, his long snout and huge ears, he wore a cotton shirt that was neither quite green nor quite blue. A sort of spotted cotton handkerchief was tied round his head. Said Pilgrim, smiling to himself, “So, I have to do business with a thing like this!” Dear Pilgrim! He neither greeted the monster, nor did he speak to him; he lay on the bed instead and pretended to be sick, moaning all the time. Unable to tell the true from the false, the monster walked into the room and, grabbing his “spouse,” he at once demanded a kiss. “He really wants to sport with old Monkey!” said Pilgrim, smiling to himself. Using a holding trick, he caught the long snout of that monster and gave it a sudden, violent twist, sending him crashing to the floor with a loud thud. Picking himself up, the monster supported himself on the side of the bed and said, “Sister, how is it that you seem somewhat annoyed with me today? Because I’m late, perhaps?” “I’m not annoyed!” said Pilgrim.",,"Awaiting Pigsy’s return in a nearby forest, Monkey sneezed. “A bad omen,” he fretted to Sandy. “I fear Pigsy has taken a wrong turn. I’m going to the cave to investigate.” The sentries rushed at him as he approached; too weak to fight, Monkey changed himself into a piece of gold cloth and fluttered down by the side of the road. Thinking that Monkey had dropped it in flight, one of the goblins picked it up and brought it back inside the cave, where Monkey could hear Pigsy raging from inside the leather bag. Just as he was trying to devise a rescue plan, Monkey overheard Red Boy sending six goblins out to deliver an invitation to his father, Monkey’s old comrade King Bull Demon, to partake with him of the life-prolonging Tripitaka. Smelling an opportunity, Monkey turned into a fly and buzzed after them out of the cave. Monkey soon overtook the emissaries and, ten miles ahead of them, transformed himself into the exact likeness of his former friend Bull Demon, then waited in a fold of the mountain, pretending to be on a hunting expedition. “How kind,” cooed the specious Bull Demon on intercepting the goblins and learning of their purpose, and the seven of them returned to Red Boy’s cave, where Monkey was treated to a full ceremonial welcome. “Be careful with this Tripitaka,” he warned Red Boy, after sitting down. “I understand that his disciple is the famous Monkey who rebelled against Heaven. Back in the day, he saw off one hundred thousand celestial soldiers.” “Big deal,” dismissed Red Boy. “I already burned him to a frazzle.” “Don’t underestimate his powers of transformation, though.” “I’d spot him the moment he stepped through my door.” “But what if he becomes a fly, mosquito, flea, or bee?” “He wouldn’t dare!” gloated Red Boy. Bull Demon now changed the subject.","Monkey then used some of his magic powers to turn himself into the likeness of the girl with a shake of his body. Then he sat down in the room to wait for the evil spirit. Before long there was a marvellous wind that sent stones and dust flying: At first it was a gentle breeze, That gradually became a tremendous gale. When it was a gentle breeze, it filled Heaven and Earth; When it grew, nothing could withstand it. It stripped off flowers and snapped willows like stalks of hemp, Uprooting forests as if it were picking vegetables. It threw rivers and seas into turmoil, to the fury of gods and devils, Splitting rocks and mountains as Heaven and Earth watched in horror. The flower-eating deer lost their way, The fruit-plucking monkeys did not know where they were. Seven-storied iron pagodas fell on the Buddha's head, The streamers in the temple fell on the jeweled canopy. Golden beams and pillars of jade were shaken from their roots, Tiles flew from the roof like swallows. As the boatman raised his oar he made a vow, Quickly sacrificing a pig and a goat as he pushed off. The guardian god of the city ward abandoned his shrine, The Dragon Kings of the Four Seas bowed to Heaven. The yaksha demons' boats were wrecked on the coast, And half the length of the Great Wall was blown down. As this gale wind passed, an evil spirit appeared in mid-air. He was certainly ugly with his dark face, stubbly hair, long nose, and big ears. He wore a cotton tunic that was somewhere between black and blue, and round his waist was a patterned cotton cloth. “So that's what he's like,” thought Monkey with a secret smile, and without greeting him or asking him anything he lay down on the bed, breathing heavily and pretending to be ill. Not knowing who this really was, the monster came straight in, put his arms around him and was going to kiss him. Monkey laughed to himself again as he thought, “So he really wants to screw me.” Then he thrust his hand up under the monster's long nose to throw him off balance. The monster fell off the bed. As the monster pulled himself up he leaned on the edge of the bed and said, “Darling, why are you so angry with me today? Is it because I'm late?” “I'm not angry,” Monkey replied, “not angry at all.”"
大圣得胜，收了毫毛，急转身回洞，早又见铁板桥头，四个健将，领众叩迎那大圣，哽哽咽咽大哭三声，又唏唏哈哈大笑三声。大圣道：“汝等见了我，又哭又笑，何也？”四健将道：“今早帅众将与天王交战，把七十二洞妖王与独角鬼王，尽被众神捉了，我等逃生，故此该哭。这见大圣得胜回来，未曾伤损，故此该笑。”大圣道：“胜负乃兵家之常。古人云：‘杀人一万，自损三千。’况捉了去的头目乃是虎、豹、狼虫、獾獐、狐骆之类，我同类者未伤一个，何须烦恼？他虽被我使个分身法杀退，他还要安营在我山脚下。我等且紧紧防守，饱食一顿，安心睡觉，养养精神。天明看我使个大神通，拿这些天将，与众报仇。”四将与众猴将椰酒吃了几碗，安心睡觉不题。,"The great sage was victorious, withdrew his hair, turned around and went back to the cave. Early on, he saw the iron-panel bridge head, four strong generals, leading the crowd to kowtow to the great sage, choked up and cried three times, and laughed three times. The great sage said, ""Why are you crying and laughing when you see me?"" The four strong generals said, ""This morning, the handsome generals fought against the heavenly king, and the seventy-two cave demon king and the one-horned ghost king were all overwhelmed by the gods. If you are caught, I will wait for my escape, so I should cry. Seeing that the great sage has come back victorious and has not been injured, so we should laugh."" Qian.' Besides, the leaders caught were tigers, leopards, wolves, badgers, deer, foxes, and the like. I didn't hurt a single one of my kind, so why bother? Although he was killed by my clone method, he still wanted to Set up camp at the foot of my mountain. I will wait and defend tightly, eat a full meal, sleep peacefully, and nourish my spirit. Tianming will see me using a great supernatural power to take these heavenly generals and avenge the crowd."" The four generals and all the monkey generals After eating a few bowls of wine, I can sleep peacefully.","In triumph the Great Sage collected back his hairs and hurried back to his cave. Soon, at the head of the sheet iron bridge, he was met by the four mighty commanders leading the rest of the monkeys. As they kowtowed to receive him they cried three times, sobbing aloud, and then they laughed three times, hee-heeing and ho-hoing. The Great Sage said, “Why do you all laugh and cry when you see me?” “When we fought with the Deva Kings this morning,” said the four mighty commanders, “the monster kings of seventy-two caves and the One-Horn Demon King were all taken captive by the gods. We were the only ones who managed to escape alive, and that is why we cried. Now we see that the Great Sage has returned unharmed and triumphant, and so we laugh as well.” “Victory and defeat,” said the Great Sage, “are the common experiences of a soldier. The ancient proverb says, You may kill ten thousand of your enemies, But you will lose three thousand of your allies! Moreover, those chieftains who have been captured are tigers and leopards, wolves and insects, badgers and foxes, and the like. Not a single member of our own kind has been hurt. Why then should we be disconsolate? Although our adversaries have been beaten back by my magic of body division, they are still encamped at the foot of our mountain. Let us be most vigilant, therefore, in our defense. Have a good meal, rest well, and conserve your energy. When morning comes, watch me perform a great magic and capture some of these generals from Heaven, so that our comrades may be avenged.” The four mighty commanders drank a few bowls of coconut wine with the host of monkeys and went to sleep peacefully. We shall speak no more of them.","When the Great Sage had gained the victory, he called back the scattered hair and returned to his cave. Then were seen on the iron bridge the four generals leading their followers to welcome the Great Sage. They groaned three times in sorrow and tears, then three times they broke forth into cheers and laughter. The Great Sage said, “Why do you come and greet me both weeping and laughing?” The generals said, “Thinking of the battle this morning, when our seventy-two generals and commander-in-chief were all taken by the celestial hosts and we only escaped alive, we could not but weep, but now seeing our Great Sage return after his victory without a scratch on him, we are filled with laughter.” The Sage replied, “Victory and failure are common things among soldiers, why should you be in distress? Only let us be on our guard, let us have something to eat, then we can sleep and be refreshed. In the morning I will show you a great miracle. I will take these celestial hosts and have my revenge on them.” Then all the monkeys retired to sleep.","The victorious Monkey retrieved his hairs, rushed back into the cave, and delivered a philosophical speech to his troops, whose morale had been battered by the capture of the monstrous monarchs. “Victory and defeat are the lot of all armies. To kill ten thousand enemies, you may have to sacrifice three thousand of your own. On the bright side, our losses were all tigers, leopards, wolves, snakes, and badgers. We monkeys are safe and sound. Stay strong! My body division magic has temporarily beaten our enemies back, but they are still camped at the bottom of our mountain. We must eat, sleep, and be vigilant. When morning comes, I will avenge our comrades by capturing Heaven’s generals with a fantastic magic trick.” And after a few bowls of coconut wine, all the monkeys fell asleep.","After winning this victory the Great Sage put back his hair and hurried back to the cave, where the four Stalwart Generals at once led the monkeys out to kowtow at the head of the iron bridge to welcome him back. They sobbed three times and then laughed three times. “Why are you laughing and crying at the sight of me?” the Great Sage asked. “When we led all the commanders into battle against the heavenly kings this morning,” replied the Stalwart Generals, “the seventy-two kings of the monsters and the One-horned Demon King were all captured by the gods, and we had to flee for our lives. That is why we cried. We laughed because you, Great Sage, have come back victorious and unharmed.” To this the Great Sage replied, “Victory and defeat are all the soldier's lot. As the ancients said, 'To kill ten thousand of the enemy you must lose three thousand of your own.' Anyhow, the officers of ours who were captured were all tigers, leopards, wolves, badgers, river-deer, foxes, and raccoon-dogs. Not one of our own kind was even wounded, so there's no need for us to be bothered about it. But although I forced the enemy to withdraw by dividing up my body through magic, they're still encamped at the foot of our mountain, so we'll have to remain on our guard. Meanwhile we must eat a good meal and get a good night's sleep to build up our energy. Tomorrow morning I'll use powerful magic to capture those heavenly generals and avenge our people.” After the four Stalwart Generals and the other monkey commanders had drunk several cups of coconut toddy, they went to bed with their worries calmed."
都来总是精气神，谨固牢藏休漏泄。,"You are always in good spirits, and you will keep leaking.","All power resides in the semen, breath, and spirit; Store these securely lest there be a leak. Lest there be a leak!","Obey my words, and Truth you’ll find.","After memorizing the magic formula and kowtowing fulsome thanks to Subodhi, he returned quietly to his own bed as the sun rose.","They all come from essence, vapour, and spirit, Must be stored away securely, and never be divulged."
太宗云：“你是何人？朕当救你。”龙王云：“陛下是真龙，臣是业龙。臣因犯了天条，该陛下贤臣人曹官魏征处斩，故来拜求，望陛下救我一救！”太宗曰：“既是魏征处斩，朕可以救你。你放心前去。”龙王欢喜，叩谢而去。,"Taizong said: ""Who are you? I should save you."" The Dragon King said: ""Your Majesty is a real dragon, and this minister is a yelong. Because this minister has violated the laws of heaven, the noble minister of His Majesty, Cao Guan Wei Zheng, will be executed, so he has come to pray. , I hope Your Majesty will save me!"" Taizong said, ""Since Wei Zheng is beheading, I can save you. You can go forward with confidence."" The Dragon King rejoiced and thanked him and left.","“Who are you?” asked Taizong. “We would be glad to save you.” “Your Majesty is the true dragon,” said the Dragon King, “but I am an accursed one. Because I have disobeyed the decree of Heaven, I am to be executed by a worthy subject of Your Majesty, the human judge Wei Zheng. I have therefore come here to plead with you to save me.” “If Wei Zheng is to be the executioner,” said Taizong, “we can certainly save you. You may leave and not worry.” The Dragon King was delighted and left after expressing his gratitude.","They do not speak of this world’s good, They speak of another marriage, When work is finished, they remove to Heaven, That is their soul’s eternal home. This is better than to enjoy one’s self below, Which ends in mortifying rottenness Truly when one follows the right way, one must be careful, One must put away the desires of the flesh and be true. The next morning dawned, and it was found that fairies had indeed tempted them, and that Zhu, the Keeper of the Eight Commandments, had succumbed. His repentance was in great sorrow and shame.","“Save me, Your Majesty! Having broken Heavenly law, I am due to be executed tomorrow by your prime minister.” “Of course I will intervene on your behalf with Wei Zheng,” the imperial mirage promised. “Don’t give it a moment’s further thought.” And the dragon king gratefully retreated.","“Who are you, that we should save you?” asked Taizong. “Your Majesty is a true dragon,” replied the dragon king, “and I am a wicked dragon. As I have offended against the laws of Heaven, I am due to be beheaded by Your Majesty's illustrious minister Wei Zheng, the official in charge of personnel, so I have come to beg you to save me.” “If you are supposed to be beheaded by Wei Zheng, we can save you, so set your mind at rest and go along now,” said the Tang Emperor. The dragon king, who was extremely happy, kowtowed in thanks and went away."
铁棒赛飞龙，神锋如舞凤，左挡右攻，前迎后映。这阵上梅山六弟助威风，那阵上马流四将传军令。摇旗擂鼓各齐心，呐喊筛锣都助兴。,"Iron clubs compete with flying dragons, and the divine front is like a dancing phoenix, blocking left and right attacking, front and back. In this battle, the sixth younger brother of Meishan came to cheer, and in that battle, the four generals of Ma Liu passed military orders. Waving the flag and beating the drums together, shouting and sifting the gongs all added to the fun.","The iron rod seemed a flying dragon, And the lance divine a dancing phoenix: Left and right they struck, Attacking both front and back. The Plum Mountain Six Brothers’ awesome presence filled one side, While the four generals, like Ma and Liu, took command on the other. All worked as one to wave flags and roll drums; All helped the fight by cheers while beating the gong.","Then the Divine Kinsman roused himself terribly, shook himself and cried out, “Change!” and he was so changed that he was a hundred thousand feet high and he held in his hand a trident with sharpest points, each as strong as the peak of a mountain.","Dodging the blow, Monkey returned the compliment with his own staff. This murderously close duel raged through three hundred clashes; deputies on both sides waved banners and beat drums.","The iron staff raced with the flying dragons, The divine cudgel seemed like a dancing phoenix. Parrying to the left, thrusting to the right, Advancing to meet a blow, flashing behind. The brothers of Plum Hill add to one side's might, While the other has the four Stalwart Generals to transmit orders. As the flags wave and the drums roll each side is as one; Battle-cries and gongs raise everyone's morale."
却说那大圣已至灌江口，摇身一变，变作二郎爷爷的模样，按下云头，径入庙里。鬼判不能相认，一个个磕头迎接。他坐中间，点查香火：见李虎拜还的三牲，张龙许下的保福，赵甲求子的文书，钱丙告病的良愿。正看处，有人报：“又一个爷爷来了。”众鬼判急急观看，无不惊心。真君却道：“有个甚么齐天大圣，才来这里否？”众鬼判道：“不曾见甚么大圣，只有一个爷爷在里面查点哩。”真君撞进门，大圣见了，现出本相道：“郎君不消嚷，庙宇已姓孙了。”这真君即举三尖两刃神锋，劈脸就砍。那猴王使个身法，让过神锋，掣出那绣花针儿，幌一幌，碗来粗细，赶到前，对面相还。两个嚷嚷闹闹，打出庙门，半雾半云，且行且战，复打到花果山，慌得那四大天王等众，提防愈紧。这康、张太尉等迎着真君，合力努力，把那美猴王围绕不题。,"However, he said that the great sage had reached the mouth of Guanjiang, changed his body, changed into the appearance of Erlang's grandfather, pressed the cloud head, and entered the temple. The ghosts couldn't recognize each other, and they kowtowed to them one by one. He sat in the middle and counted the incense: seeing the three sacrifices that Li Hubai paid back, the blessing promised by Zhang Long, the document that Zhao Jia asked for a son, and the good wishes of Qian Bing to report illness. Just looking at the place, someone reported: ""Another grandfather is here."" The ghosts watched anxiously, and they were all startled. However, the true monarch said, ""Is there a great sage Equaling the Sky that came here?"" The ghosts said, ""I have never seen any great sage, but only a grandfather checked it out."" The true monarch slammed into the door. Now, he showed his true nature: ""Lang-jun doesn't need to shout, the temple's surname is Sun."" This real monarch raised three sharp and two-edged divine sharp edges, and chopped his face. The Monkey King made a move, passed Shen Feng, took out the embroidery needle, made a look, the thickness of the bowl, rushed to the front, and returned it to the opposite side. The two made a fuss and fought outside the temple gate. It was half fog and half cloud. This Kang, Taiwei Zhang and others faced the real monarch and worked together to surround the beautiful monkey king.","With a shake of his body, he changed into the form of Holy Father Erlang. Lowering the direction of his cloud, he went straight into the temple, and the demon magistrates could not tell that he was not the real Erlang. Every one of them, in fact, kowtowed to receive him. He sat down in the middle and began to examine the various offerings; the three kinds of sacrificial meat brought by Li Hu, the votive offering of Zhang Long, the petition for a son by Zhao Jia, and the request for healing by Qian Bing. As he was looking at these, someone made the report, “Another Holy Father has arrived!” The various demon magistrates went quickly to look and were terror-stricken, one and all. The Immortal Master asked, “Did a so-called Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, come here?” “We haven’t seen any Great Sage,” said the demon magistrates. “But another Holy Father is in there examining the offerings.” The Immortal Master crashed through the door; seeing him, the Great Sage revealed his true form and said, “There’s no need for the little boy to strive anymore! Sun is now the name of this temple!” The Immortal Master lifted his divine lance of three points and two blades and struck, but the Monkey King with agile body was quick to move out of the way. He whipped out that embroidery needle of his, and with one wave caused it to take on the thickness of a rice bowl. Rushing forward, he engaged Erlang face to face. Starting at the door of the temple, the two combatants fought all the way back to the Flower-Fruit Mountain, treading on clouds and mists and shouting insults at each other. The Four Devarājas and their followers were so startled by their appearance that they stood guard with even greater vigilance, while the grand marshals joined the Immortal Master to surround the Handsome Monkey King.","But after the Great Sage had got there, he changed himself into the form of the Divine Kinsman himself, came down from the clouds and entered a temple. As no one could distinguish the fraud, all came and kowtowed, and he in their midst surveyed the burning of incense, and then read the written prayers and heard Li Hu paying his vows of three animals for sacrifice, Zhang Long offering thanksgiving for blessings received, Zhao Jia begging for a son, and Jian Bing begging to be relieved of his duties on account of ill health. As this performance was going on, there came a man to announce that an old man had come. All quickly turned round to see and were greatly frightened at his demeanor. The Divine Kinsman, for he was the old man, said, “Has the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven come here?” They replied, “No, we have not seen the Great Sage, but there is an old man inside burning incense.” The Divine Kinsman rushed inside. The Great Sage at sight of him appeared in his true form and said, “Do not make any disturbance, Prince, the temple belongs to the Sun family.” The Divine Kinsman raised his trident, with its double edged blades, rushed on him to cut him down, but the Monkey King evaded his thrust, took out his embroidery needle from his ear and when it grew as large in circumference as an arm or a leg, rushed to meet him and there was a fierce struggle between them. They got out of the temple and fought in the air as they went, until they reached the Mountain Garden, where they terrified the Four Great Guardians of Heaven and their followers, who were surrounding the place. The Four Governors and the Two Commanders-in-chief came to meet the Divine Kinsman and with all their might tried to surround the Great Sage. Then the Chief, having called the six brethren and their soldiers together to take the Monkey King, returned to Heaven to report.","As soon as he reached the Guan, Monkey changed himself into an exact likeness of Erlang, received the obeisances of Erlang’s subordinates, and set to officiating in his nemesis’s own temple. Not long after, however, the real Erlang arrived, and his officials rushed out to see the doppelgänger. “Has a so-named Great Sage Equal to Heaven been here?” Erlang wanted to know. “No, no one of that name. But there is another version of you inside.” After the real Erlang charged at his impersonator, Monkey took his true form. “Welcome to the Temple of Monkey!” Erlang struck at Monkey’s face with his tri-pointed lance, but Monkey dodged, and the two of them jousted their way back to Flower-Fruit Mountain. Back in Heaven, the Jade Emperor and his court were wondering why they had heard no news of Monkey for some while.","The Great Sage had already arrived there, changed himself into the likeness of the god Erlang with a shake of his body, put away his cloud, and gone into the temple. The demon judges did not realize who he really was, so they all kowtowed to welcome him. He took his seat in the middle of the temple, and inspected the offerings: the beef, mutton and pork presented by one Li Hu, the ex-voto promised by a Zhang Long, the letter from a Zhao Jia asking for a son, and one Qian Bing's prayer for recovery from illness. As he was looking round it was announced that another Lord Erlang had arrived. All the demon judges hurried to look, and they were all astonished. The True Lord Erlang asked, “Has a so-called Great Sage Equaling Heaven been here?” “We haven't seen any Great Sages,” they replied, “only another god who's looking around inside.” The True Lord rushed in through the gates, and as soon as the Great Sage saw him he reverted to his own appearance and said, “There's no point in shouting, sir. This temple's mine now.” The True Lord raised his double-bladed trident and swung at the Monkey King's head, but the Monkey King dodged the blow by magic, took his embroidery needle, shook it till it was as thick as a bowl, and rushed forward to meet the attack. Shouting and yelling, they fought their way out through the gates, and went on fighting through the mists and clouds all the way back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. The Four Heavenly Kings and all their soldiers were so alarmed that they kept an even tighter guard. Marshals Kang and Zhang and the others came to meet the True Lord, and combined their efforts to surround the Handsome Monkey King. But of this no more for now."
那宫主忽的翻身，叫：“丈夫慢行，等我一等！”太宗道：“御妹，是我等在此。”宫主抬头睁眼观看道：“你是谁人，敢来扯我？”,"The palace lord suddenly turned over and called, ""Husband slow down, wait for me!"" Taizong said: ""Yu Mei, I am waiting here."" Trick me?""","Our princess suddenly turned over and cried, “Husband, walk slowly! Wait for me!” “Sister,” said Taizong, “we are all here.” Lifting her head and opening her eyes to look around, the princess said, “Who are you that you dare touch me?”","The Master thought awhile and then said, “Oh disciple, when shall we see Buddha face to face?”",The “princess” rolled over and opened her eyes. “Who are you? Get your hands off me!”,"All of a sudden the princess sat up and called out, “Don't go so fast, husband. Wait for me.” “Sister, we're waiting for you here,” said the Emperor. The princess lifted her head, opened her eyes, and looked at him. “Who are you?” she asked. “How dare you put your hands on us?”"
玉皇即便怒生嗔，却令掌朝左辅相：卸冠脱甲摘官衔，将身推在杀场上。多亏赤脚大天仙，越班启奏将吾放。饶死回生不典刑，遭贬流沙东岸上。饱时困卧此山中，饿去翻波寻食饷。樵子逢吾命不存，渔翁见我身皆丧。来来往往吃人多，翻翻复复伤生瘴。你敢行凶到我门，今日肚皮有所望。莫言粗糙不堪尝，拿住消停剁鲊酱！”八戒闻言大怒，骂道：“你这泼物，全没一些儿眼色！我老猪还掐出水沫儿来哩，你怎敢说我粗糙，要剁鲊酱！看起来，你把我认做个老走硝哩。休得无礼！吃你祖宗这一钯！”那怪见钯来，使一个凤点头躲过。两个在水中打出水面，各人踏浪登波。这一场赌斗，比前不同，你看那：卷帘将，天蓬帅，各显神通真可爱。那个降妖宝杖着头轮，这个九齿钉钯随手快。跃浪振山川，推波昏世界。凶如太岁撞幛幡，恶似丧门掀宝盖。这一个赤心凛凛保唐僧，那一个犯罪滔滔为水怪。,"Even though the Jade Emperor was angry, he ordered his palm towards the left assistant: he took off his crown, took off his armor, took off his official rank, and pushed his body on the killing field. Thanks to the great god of bare feet, Yueban Qisheng released me. Rao back to life without punishment, was banished to the east bank of quicksand. When he is full, he sleeps in this mountain, and when he is hungry, he goes through the waves in search of food and salaries. When the woodcutter meets my life, my life is lost, and the fisherman sees me dead. They come and go to eat a lot of people, and they turn over and over again, and they will suffer from miasmas. If you dare to kill me, there is hope in your belly today. Mo Yan is rough and unpalatable, hold on and chop the scallop sauce! When Bajie heard this, he was furious and scolded, ""You bastard, you don't even wink at all!"" My old pig is still squeezing water, how dare you say that I am rough and want to chop scallop sauce! It looks like you think of me as an old nerd. Rest is rude! Eat this palladium of your ancestors! ""That strange palladium came, so one of the phoenixes nodded to dodge. The two hit the surface in the water, each riding on the waves. This game is different than before. Look at it: the rolling shutter general, the canopy is handsome, They show their supernatural powers so cute. That demon-destroying treasure stick has a head wheel, and this nine-toothed nail palladium is quick and easy. It jumps the waves and shakes the mountains and rivers, and pushes the waves to faint the world. Chi-heartedly protect Tang Seng, that one crime surging as a water monster.","Hands clasped, he faced his counsel on the left. Stripped of my hat, my armor, and my rank, I had my whole body pushed to the block. Only the Great Immortal, Naked Feet, Came from the ranks and begged to have me freed. Pardoned from death and with my sentence stayed, I was sent to the shores of Flowing-Sand. Sated, I lie wearily in the stream; Famished, I churn the waves to find my feed. The woodsman sees me and his life is gone; The fishers face me and they soon perish. From first to last I’ve eaten many men; Over and over I took human lives. Since you dare to work violence at my door, My stomach this day has its fondest hopes! Don’t say you’re too coarse to be eaten now. I’ll catch you, and look, that’s my minced meat sauce!” Infuriated by what he heard, Eight Rules shouted, “You brazen thing! You haven’t the slightest perception! Old Hog is tempting enough to make people’s mouths water, and you dare say that I’m coarse, that I’m to be chopped up for a chopped meat sauce! Come to think of it, you would like to consider me a piece of tough old bacon! Watch your manners and swallow this rake of your ancestor!” When the monster saw the rake coming, he used the style of “the phoenix nodding its head” to dodge the blow. The two of them thus fought to the surface of the water, each one treading the waters and waves. This conflict was somewhat different from the one before. Look at The Curtain-Raising Captain, The Marshal of Heavenly Reeds: Each showing most nicely his magic might. This one waved above his head the fiend-routing staff: That one moved the rake as swiftly as his hand. The vaulting waves rocked hills and streams; The surging tide the cosmos dimmed. Savage like Jupiter wielding banners and flags! Fierce like Hell’s envoy upsetting sacred tops! This one guarded the Tang Monk devotedly; That one, a water fiend, perpetrated his crimes.",,"“We can decide what to do in the morning.” Back inside the cave, the female fiend shook off thoughts of battle and went back to smiling pleasantly. “Make sure the front and back doors are locked,” she ordered her maids, appointing two as sentries to prevent Monkey from sneaking in again. “Light some candles and incense in the bedroom for a bit of ambience,” she told some other servants. “Tonight, Tripitaka and I are going to make beautiful love.” When Tripitaka was delivered to her, she enveloped him in her arms. Dumb with horror, Tripitaka’s instinct was to refuse her, but he worried she might kill him for it. Shaking like jelly, then, he followed her into the fragrant bedroom. By this point, he was too horrified even to hear the fiend’s sweet nothings. The demon began to disrobe, revealing a soft, scented body; Tripitaka wrapped his robe all the more tightly around himself. “I’ll be the courtesan to your emperor,” simpered the fiend. “No, thank you,” he responded. Back and forth they went deep into the night, with Tripitaka staunchly resisting the fiend’s advances. Around midnight, she finally lost her temper, trussed her beloved up like a chicken, ordered her servants to dump him in the corridor, blew out the candles, and shut down the cave for the night. Soon enough, day broke and Monkey got up and stretched. “My headache’s gone,” he rejoiced. “There’s just a little itch left.” “Shall we ask her to give you another tap?” Pigsy teased. “Get lost!” Monkey spat at him. “On the general subject of heads,” continued Pigsy, still in humorous mode, “Master must have let his hair down last night.”","The Jade Emperor in his terrible fury Put his hands together and fumed to the vice-premier. My hat and armour were removed, and I was stripped of office, Then marched to the place of execution. Then, to my good fortune, the great Bare-foot Immortal Stepped forward to ask for my reprieve. Death was commuted; I was allowed to live In exile on the East bank of the Flowing Sands River. When well-fed I sleep in the river waters; When hungry I burst through the waves in search of food. If a woodcutter meets me his life is finished— No fisherman sees me and survives. In one way and another I've eaten many a man, Cloaked as I am in an aura of death. As you've dared to come to make trouble at my gates My belly has something to look forward to today. No matter if you're coarse and don't taste good, When I've caught you I can cut you up for salted mince.” Pig was extremely angry to hear this, and he replied, “You're completely blind, wretch. I can catch bubbles in my fingers, so how dare you say that I'm so coarse you'll cut me up for salted mince? So you take me to be a very well-cured side of ham! Don't be impudent—take a dose of this rake.” When the monster saw the rake coming at him he did a “phoenix nod” to avoid it. The two of them fought their way up to the surface of the water, where each of them trod on the waves as they struggled in a combat that was even fiercer than their previous one. The Curtain-lifting General, And Marshal Tian Peng; Each gave a splendid show of magic powers. The ogre-quelling staff wheels around the head, The nine-pronged rake is swift in the hand. As they leap on the waves, they shake hills and rivers, Darkening the world as they push the waters aside, As terrible as the Disaster Star striking banners and pendants, As frightening as lifting the canopy off the Death Star. One was the loyal defender of the Tang Priest, The other, a criminal, was an ogre of the waters."

他却牵了马，挑了担，出山凹，行上路口。此时渐渐黄昏，只听得那路南山坡下，有犬吠之声。二人停身观看，乃是一家庄院，影影的有灯火光明。他两个也不管有路无路，漫草而行，直至那家门首，但见：紫芝翳翳，白石苍苍。紫芝翳翳多青草，白石苍苍半绿苔。数点小萤光灼灼，一林野树密排排。香兰馥郁，嫩竹新栽。清泉流曲涧，古柏倚深崖。地僻更无游客到，门前惟有野花开。他两个不敢擅入，只得叫一声：“开门，开门！”,"However, he led the horse, carried the burden, went out of the mountain valley, and walked to the intersection. At this time, it was gradually dusk, and only the sound of dogs barking could be heard under the south slope of the road. The two stopped to watch, it was a mansion, and the shadows were brightly lit. The two of them didn't care whether there was a way or not, and they walked along the grass until they reached the head of the house, but they saw: the purple zhi shading, the white stone green. The purple zhi nebula is full of green grass, and the white stone is green and half-green moss. A few small fluorescent lights are burning, and a forest is densely packed with wild trees. The pandan is fragrant, and the tender bamboo is newly planted. Clear springs flow and meanders, and ancient cypresses lean on deep cliffs. There are no tourists in the remote area, and only wild flowers bloom in front of the door. The two of them did not dare to enter without authorization, so they could only shout, ""Open the door, open the door!""","Leading the horse and carrying up the luggage, they left the fold of the mountain and went up the road. Dusk was setting in, and as they walked, they heard the sound of barking dogs toward the south of the mountain slope. Stopping to look, they saw a small cottage with flickering lamplights. Not bothering to look for a path, the two of them walked through the grass and arrived at the door of that household. They saw Dark clumps of purplish fungi; Greyish piles of white stones; Dark clumps of purplish fungi with much green grass; Greyish piles of white stones half grown with moss: A few specks of fireflies, their faint light aglow; A forest of wild woods stand in dense rows; Orchids ever fragrant; Bamboos newly planted; A clear stream flows a winding course; Old cedars lean o’er a deep cliff. A secluded place where no travelers come: Only wild flowers bloom before the door. Not daring to enter without permission, they both called out: “Open the door! Open the door!”",,"Not long into his cloud-somersault, Monkey encountered an exceptionally lovely mountain, dappled with brooks and canyons, carpeted in emerald-green forest and inhabited by wild geese, deer, and monkeys. As he took in the scene, he spotted a rather handsome building on the shaded side of the mountain. It looked like a perfect retreat for a recluse: a thatched house approached by a bridge over a stream. In a moment, Monkey was at the gate; just inside, an elderly Taoist sat cross-legged on an expanse of green grass. Monkey set his porcelain bowl down and approached to make inquiries. “What brings you to our humble temple?” the Taoist asked. “I am a poor monk sent by the Tang empire to fetch scriptures from the west. Because my master mistakenly drank from the Mother-and-Child River, he is in terrible labor pain and due to give birth at any moment. I understand that his only hope is to drink water from Abortion Spring, which is located within your temple.","Leading the horse and carrying the baggage, they came out of the hollow and went along the path. The dusk was gradually deepening when they heard dogs barking under a hill to the South of the path. They stopped to look and saw a farmhouse with a lamp shining brightly in its window. The pair of them stopped bothering to look for the path and cut straight through the grass to the gate. They saw Dark magic fungus, Greeny white rocks. The magic fungus was dark among the many herbs, The white rocks were green with moss. Some tiny fireflies made dots of light Against the dense ranks of the forest trees. Heavy was the fragrance of the orchid, And the tender bamboo had been newly cut. A pure spring flowed along a winding bed, An ancient cypress hung over a cliff. No travelers came to this remote spot, And only wild flowers bloomed before the gate. As they did not want to march straight in, the two of them shouted, “Open up, open up.”"
“师父，那路旁树下坐的是唐僧。”大仙道：“我已见了。你两个回去安排下绳索，等我自家拿他。”清风先回不题。,"""Master, the Tang monk is sitting under the tree by the road."" Daxian said: ""I have seen it. You two go back and arrange the ropes, and wait for me to get him at home."" Qingfeng answered the question first.","“Master,” said one of the lads, “that’s the Tang Monk sitting beneath a tree by the road.” “I see him,” said the Great Immortal. “You two go back and prepare the ropes. Let me capture them by myself.”",,"“Use your magic to catch up with Tripitaka. Get the wordless scriptures off him so that he comes back for the written versions. Hurry!” The librarian swept out of the monastery complex on a gale that scattered the complex’s apes, cranes, and phoenixes, and snapped pines and bamboos. As this fragrant wind churned around Tripitaka, he assumed it was just an auspicious omen from the Buddha.","“Master,” said one of the Immortal boys, “there's the Tang Priest, sitting under a tree by the side of the road.” “Yes, I'd seen him myself,” the Great Immortal replied. “You two go back and get some ropes ready, and I'll catch him myself.” Pure Wind and Bright Moon went back."
清风道：“我会，你说将来。”明月道：“果子原是三十个。师父开园，分吃了两个，还有二十八个；适才打两个与唐僧吃，还有二十六个；如今止剩得二十二个，却不少了四个？不消讲，不消讲，定是那伙恶人偷了，我们只骂唐僧去来。”两个出了园门，径来殿上，指着唐僧，秃前秃后，秽语污言不绝口的乱骂；贼头鼠脑，臭短臊长，没好气的胡嚷。唐僧听不过道：“仙童啊，你闹的是甚么？消停些儿，有话慢说不妨，不要胡说散道的。”清风说：“你的耳聋？我是蛮话，你不省得？你偷吃了人参果，怎么不容我说。”唐僧道：“人参果怎么模样？”明月道：“才拿来与你吃，你说象孩童的不是？”唐僧道：“阿弥陀佛！那东西一见，我就心惊胆战，还敢偷他吃哩！就是害了馋痞，也不敢干这贼事。,"Qingfeng said: ""I will, you said in the future."" Mingyue said: ""There were thirty fruits. Master opened the garden, and he ate two, and there were twenty-eight; Sixteen; now there are only twenty-two left, but there are no less than four? No need to say, no need to say, it must be those wicked people who stole it, and we only scold Tang Seng for coming."" When he came to the hall, he pointed at the Tang monk, who was bald and bald, and cursed with foul language. Tang Seng couldn't hear it and said: ""Xiantong, what are you making a fuss about? Calm down a little bit, talk slowly, don't talk nonsense."" Qingfeng said: ""Your deafness? You stole the ginseng fruit, why can't you tell me."" Tang Seng said: ""What does the ginseng fruit look like?"" Mingyue said: ""I brought it to eat with you, do you think it looks like a child?"" Tang Seng said: ""Amitabha! , I was frightened, and I dared to steal him to eat! Even if it hurt the glutton, I would not dare to do this thief.","“I do,” said Clear Breeze, “give me the figures!” “There were originally thirty fruits,” said Bright Moon. “When Master opened the garden to the public, he divided two of them for all of us, so that twenty-eight fruits were left. Just now we knocked down two more for the Tang Monk, leaving twenty-six behind. Now we have only twenty-two left. Doesn’t that mean that four are missing? No need for further explanation; they must have been stolen by that bunch of rogues. Let’s go and chide the Tang Monk.” The two of them went out of the garden gate and came directly back to the main hall. Pointing their fingers at the Tang Monk, they berated him with all kinds of foul and abusive language, accusing him of being a larcenous baldhead and a thievish rat. They went on like this for a long time, until finally the Tang Monk could not endure it any longer. “Divine lads,” he said, “why are you making all this fuss? Be quiet a moment. If you have something to say, say it slowly, but don’t use such nonsensical language.” “Are you deaf?” asked Clear Breeze. “Am I speaking in a barbarian tongue that you can’t understand? You stole and ate our ginseng fruits. Do you now forbid me to say so?” “What is a ginseng fruit like?” asked the Tang Monk. “Like an infant,” said Bright Moon, “as you said when we brought two of them for you to eat just now.” “Amitābha Buddha!” exclaimed the Tang Monk. “I only had to take one look at that thing and I trembled all over! You think I would dare steal one and eat it? Even if I had a case of bulimia, I would not dare indulge in such thievery.",,"asked the Four Heavenly Preceptors, barring his way. Monkey explained his mission—to request rain for Phoenix-Immortal. The preceptors glanced perfunctorily down at their gold tablets, then back up at Monkey. “Heaven says no.” “Let me see the Jade Emperor,” Monkey insisted. “I’ll talk him around.” Sighing at the boldness of the creature, the preceptors showed him in. “While on a tour of Heaven and Earth three years ago,” pronounced the Jade Emperor, “we saw the prefect knock over a table of offerings and feed them to his dogs while uttering obscenities. As punishment, we created three impossible challenges in the Hall Draped with Fragrance—take Monkey to see them. Only when these have been completed will we grant the prefect rain; otherwise, he should put up and shut up.” The four preceptors led Monkey into the hall in question, where he found a hundred-foot rice pyramid and a two-hundred-foot noodle mountain. A chicken no bigger than a human fist pecked at the rice with very little commitment, while a Pekinese lapped lackadaisically at the noodles.","Tell me the figures.” “There were originally thirty manfruits,” said Bright Moon. “When our master opened the garden two were divided up and eaten, which left twenty-eight. Just now we knocked two down to give the Tang Priest, which left twenty-six. But there are only twenty-two now, which means that we're four short. It goes without saying that those bad men must have stolen them. Let's go and tell that Tang Priest what we think of him.” The two of them went from the garden to the front hall, where they pointed at Sanzang and poured the most filthy and stinking abuse on him, calling him “baldy” this and “baldy” that. It was more than Sanzang could stand, so he said, “What are you making all this fuss about, Immortal boys? Please stop. I wouldn't mind you being a bit offhand with me, but you can't talk in this outrageous way.” “Are you deaf?” Pure Wind asked. “We're not talking a foreign language, and you can understand us perfectly well. You've stolen our manfruit, and you've no right to forbid us to mention it.” “What does manfruit look like?” Sanzang asked. “It's what we offered you just now and you said looked like babies.” “Amitabha Buddha!” Sanzang exclaimed. “I shook with terror at the very sight of them—I couldn't possibly steal one. Even if I were being racked by the most terrible greed, I could never commit the crime of eating one of those."

Called A Nuo and Kasyapa, put away the offerings one by one, and headed to the Jade Emperor for a thank-you banquet. Everyone is drunk. I saw an inspector coming to report: ""The great sage is sticking out his head."" The Buddha said: ""It's okay, it's okay."" There was only one post in his sleeve, with six golden characters on it: ""Om, ah, ah, ah. , [mouth fan], hum"". Hand it to Nuo and ask to stick it on the top of the mountain. The Venerable received the post immediately, took out the Heavenly Gate, went to the top of the Five Elements Mountain, and stuck it tightly on a square stone. The mountain is rooted and seamed, and you can use the breath of your breath to climb out of it, and you can shake it. A Nuo reported back: ""The post has been posted.""","Tathāgata again thanked him and asked Ānanda and Kāśyapa to put away the gifts one by one before approaching the Jade Emperor to express his gratitude for the banquet. By now, everyone was somewhat tipsy. A Spirit Minister of Inspection then arrived to make the report, “The Great Sage is sticking out his head!” “No need to worry,” said the Buddhist Patriarch. He took from his sleeve a tag on which were written in gold letters the words Oṁ maṇi padme hūṁ. Handing it over to Ānanda, he told him to stick it on the top of the mountain. This deva received the tag, took it out of the Heaven Gate, and stuck it tightly on a square piece of rock at the top of the Mountain of Five Phases. The mountain immediately struck root and grew together at the seams, though there was enough space for breathing and for the prisoner’s hands to crawl out and move around a bit. Ānanda then returned to report, “The tag is tightly attached.”","Buddha thanked him, and called Ananda and Kasyapa to collect together all the offerings, after which he went up to the Jade Emperor and thanked him for the banquet. After this the police superintendent reported that the Great Sage had put out his head from under the mountain. The Buddha said, “That doesn’t matter.” Then he pulled out from his sleeve a piece of paper on which was written a few golden characters, om mani padme hum, which he gave to Ananda, and told him to place it on the top of the mountain. Ananda then went out through the Gate of Heaven and, reaching the top of the Five Element Mountain, made the paper fast on a square rock. That mountain had a hole with a hinge that moved with beats of breathing. This he took away without moving the body. Then Ananda returned and reported what he had done.","There were divine dancing girls, there were zithers, there were gifts (including two pears and an auspicious purple fungus), and many, many toasts. They were all blind drunk when an imperial inspector arrived to report that Monkey’s head was sticking out from underneath the mountain. “No matter,” said the Buddha. He fished out of his sleeve a plaque on which was inscribed in gold the Buddhist mantra om mani padme hum and told one of his disciples to fix it to a piece of rock on the top of the Five-Phases Mountain. The mountain immediately struck deep root, leaving just enough room for Monkey to breathe and move his paws about a bit. The Buddha and his disciples now bid farewell to the Jade Emperor and his gods.","Truly provides all the long life and blessings one could hope. The Buddha thanked him too, and telling Ananda and Kasyapa to collect together all the offerings he went over to the Jade Emperor to thank him for the banquet. When all the guests were thoroughly drunk the Miraculous Patrolling Officer reported that the Great Sage had poked his head out. “It doesn't matter,” the Buddha said, producing from his sleeve a strip of paper on which were written the golden words Om mani padme hum. He gave this piece of paper to Ananda and told him to stick it on the summit of the mountains. The Venerable Ananda took it through the gates of Heaven and pasted it firmly to a square boulder on the top of the Five Elements Mountain. When this was done the mountain sank roots and joined up all its seams. The Monkey King was still able to breathe and he could still stick his hands out and move them. Ananda went back to Heaven and reported that he had pasted the paper in place."

We suspect that the Great Sage has eaten them all. While we were looking for peaches, he suddenly popped up out of nowhere and threatened to beat us. He also wanted to know who had been invited to the banquet. When we didn’t mention his name, he immobilized us all. We’ve no idea where he went next.”","The story returns to the seven fairies, who were only able to free themselves a whole day after Sun Wukong had immobilized them with his magic. They picked up their baskets and went back to report to the Queen Mother that they were late because the Great Sage Equaling Heaven had held them there by magic. “How many peaches did you pick?” the Queen Mother asked. “Two baskets of little ones and three baskets of medium ones.

Bravo!” “Make me a banner immediately,” he ordered the four mighty commanders, “and inscribe on it in large letters, ‘The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven.’ Erect a pole to hang it on. From now on, address me only as the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, and the title Great King will no longer be permitted. The Monster Kings of the various caves will also be informed so that it will be known to all.” Of this we shall speak no further.","Whilst they were drinking wine together, there came in a man, who said, “Great King, at our gate there are two one horned kings, who wish to see you.” The Monkey King said, “Let them come in.” The two kings outside straightened their clothes, entered the cave, kowtowed and said, “We have long heard of the Great King who is in search of worthy officials, but we had no opportunity of meeting him before. Now we have heard that the Great King has been given a post in heaven. He must be pleased, and have come back with honors. So we have come to present him with a yellow robe as a token of congratulation. If he will kindly accept it, please let him use it as he does his horses and dogs.” The Monkey King was very pleased, put on the yellow robe and appointed the demon kings as viceroys under him. Having thanked him for his favor, the demon kings said, “You were in heaven a long time, what rank did you occupy there?” The Monkey King replied, “The Jade Emperor did not respect me, and simply appointed me to look after some horses.” The demon kings said, “Since you, Great King, have marvelous magic powers, how did you submit to merely looking after horses? If you had called yourself the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven, there would have been nothing you could not have done.” The Monkey King was delighted beyond measure on hearing this, and could not refrain from repeating, “Good, Good, Good!” several times. He ordered his four generals to make him a banner on which was to be written in large letters, “The Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven.” He put up a tall flagstaff and hoisted the banner, and cried, “Henceforth never again call me the Great King, but the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven. Report this to all the demon chiefs, so that they may know.” The day after the Monkey King had left his post in heaven, when the court was about to assemble, the Master of Ceremonies brought in the two assistant grooms instead of the Horse Master. They knelt before the throne and said, “We beg to say that the new Horse Master, not satisfied with the low position assigned to him, has left Heaven altogether.”","In the middle of the banquet, two visitors were announced: a pair of rhinoceros-horned demon kings. As soon as Monkey had them shown in, they rushed up to prostrate themselves. “Having heard about your Heavenly appointment and that you’d returned covered in glory, we wish to congratulate you with this red and yellow robe and to offer our faithful service.” Monkey happily slipped on the robe, accepted the adulation of the entire banqueting hall, and appointed the demon kings his frontline commanders. “Just as a matter of interest, what post did Heaven give you?” the new arrivals asked. “That crummy Jade Emperor made me his groom,” grumbled Monkey. “What?” The demon kings seemed astonished. “How could an omnipotent magic monkey be made to look after horses? You are the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!” Monkey thought this was the best thing ever. “Quick as you can,” he ordered his generals, “make me a flag saying ‘The Great Sage Equal to Heaven’ and mount it on a bamboo pole. No more of this ‘Great King’ rubbish. And tell my brothers the monstrous monarchs, too.” * * * • • •","As they were drinking someone came in to report, “Your Majesty, there are two Single-horned Devil Kings outside who want to see you.” “Ask them in,” said the Monkey King, and the two formally-dressed devil kings hurried into the cave and prostrated themselves. “Why have you come to see me?” asked the Handsome Monkey King; and they replied, “We have long heard that Your Majesty is looking for men of talent, but we were unable to see you before. Now that Your Majesty has been given heavenly office and come back in triumph, we would like to offer you this yellow robe as a token of our congratulations. We also hope that you will not reject us although we are low and worthless, but will accept our humble services.” An exultant Monkey King put on the yellow robe and his happy subjects bowed to him in order of precedence. The two devil kings were appointed Commanders of the Van, and when they had thanked the Monkey King for this they asked, “What office did Your Majesty hold while you were all that time in Heaven?” “The Jade Emperor has no respect for talent,” replied the Monkey King. “He made me something called 'Protector of the Horses.'” “Your Majesty has such miraculous powers: you should never have been feeding his horses for him. You should have been made a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' shouldn't you?” The Monkey King was beside himself with delight at this suggestion, and he kept saying how splendid it was. “Get me a banner made at once with the words 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven' in big letters on it, and put up a pole to hang it from,” he ordered his four Stalwart Generals. “From now on I am to be called 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' not 'Your Majesty' or 'King'. Pass this order on to all the other kings of the monsters.” We will leave him at this point."
寿星又到。见玉帝礼毕，又见如来，申谢道：“始闻那妖猴被老君引至兜率宫煅炼，以为必致平安，不期他又反出。干如来善伏此怪，设宴奉谢，故此闻风而来。更无他物可献，特具紫芝瑶草，碧藕金丹奉上。”诗曰：,"The birthday star is here again. After seeing the Jade Emperor's ceremony and seeing the Tathagata again, Shen Xie said: ""I first heard that the demon monkey was led by Lao Jun to the Tusita Palace for training, thinking it would bring peace, but unexpectedly he came out again. A banquet was held to give thanks, so I heard the wind and came here. There is nothing else to offer, especially the purple zhi Yao grass, and the green lotus and golden elixir."" The poem said:","His name: Star of Long Life from South Pole. After the Star of Long Life arrived and greeted the Jade Emperor, he also went up to thank Tathāgata, saying, “When I first heard that the baneful monkey was being led by Laozi to the Tushita Palace to be refined by alchemical fire, I thought peace was surely secured. I never suspected that he could still escape, and it was fortunate that Tathāgata in his goodness had subdued this monster. When I got word of the thanksgiving banquet, I came at once. I have no other gifts to present to you but these purple agaric, jasper plant, jade-green lotus root, and golden elixir.” The poem says:","After paying his respects, he was told to go and see Lord Buddha, to whom he said, “When we first heard that the Monkey Demon had been taken by the Ancient of Days to the Polar Star Mansion and had his dross burnt there, we thought all trouble was at an end and little expected it would break forth again. Happily Lord Buddha has come and seized this monster, and to celebrate the conquest this banquet has been arranged. Therefore we have come, but we have nothing to offer but some purple fungus of immortality, some jade grass, and some Immortal Pills.” The years of the Buddha are as countless as the sand of the Ganges.","There were divine dancing girls, there were zithers, there were gifts (including two pears and an auspicious purple fungus), and many, many toasts.","The Star of Longevity had arrived. When he had made his greetings to the Jade Emperor and the Buddha he made a speech of thanks. “When I heard that the monkey fiend had been taken by the Lord Lao Zi to his Tushita palace to be refined I thought that this was bound to restore peace,” he said, “and I never expected he would rebel again. Happily the demon was quelled by the Tathagata, and so when I heard that this feast was being given to thank him I came at once. As I have nothing else to offer I have brought with me purple magic mushrooms, jasper herbs, greenish jade lotus-root, and golden pills of immortality: these I humbly present.” The poem says"

菩萨闻言，即命惠岸行者道：“你可快下天宫，到花果山，打探军情如何。如遇相敌，可就相助一功，务必的实回话。”惠岸行者整整衣裙，执一条铁棍，架云离阙，径至山前。见那天罗地网，密密层层，各营门提铃喝号，将那山围绕的水泄不通。惠岸立住，叫：“把营门的天丁，烦你传报。我乃李天王二太子木叉，南海观音大徒弟惠岸，特来打探军情。”那营里五岳神兵，即传入辕门之内。早有虚日鼠、昴日鸡、星日马、房日兔，将言传到中军帐下。李天王发下令旗，教开天罗地网，放他进来。此时东方才亮。惠岸随旗进入，见四大天王与李天王下拜。拜讫，李天王道：“孩儿，你自那厢来者？”惠岸道：“愚男随菩萨赴蟠桃会，菩萨见胜会荒凉，瑶池寂寞，引众仙并愚男去见玉帝。玉帝备言父王等下界收伏妖猴，一日不见回报，胜负未知，菩萨因命愚男到此打听虚实。”李天王道：“昨日到此安营下寨，着九曜星挑战；被这厮大弄神通，九曜星俱败走而回。后我等亲自提兵，那厮也排开阵势。我等十万天兵，与他混战至晚，他使个分身法战退。及收兵查勘时，止捉得些狼虫虎豹之类，不曾捉得他半个妖猴。今日还未出战。”,"When the Bodhisattva heard the words, he ordered the Hui'an walker to say, ""You can go down to the Heavenly Palace and go to Huaguo Mountain to inquire about the military situation. If you encounter an enemy, you can help each other, and be sure to answer the truth."" , holding an iron rod, frame the cloud from the queer, and walk to the front of the mountain. Seeing that day, the nets were densely packed, and the bells and horns were raised at the gates of each camp to prevent the water surrounding the mountain from leaking. Hui'an stood there and called out, ""Tian Ding of the camp, please report it. I am Mu Cha, the second prince of Li Tianwang, and Hui'an, the disciple of Guanyin of the South China Sea. I'm here to inquire about the military situation."" Enter into the gate. There have long been the virtual sun mouse, the subaru chicken, the star sun horse, and the room sun rabbit, who will spread the word to the central army. Li Tianwang issued an order flag, taught him to open a net, and let him in. At this time, the east is bright. Hui'an entered with the flag and saw the Four Heavenly Kings and Li Heavenly King bowing down. After paying homage, Li Tianwang said, ""Son, who are you from?"" Hui'an said, ""The foolish man followed the Bodhisattva to the Pantao Meeting, the Bodhisattva saw the victory and the meeting was desolate, and the Jade Lake was lonely, so he led the immortals and foolish men to the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor prepared to say that his father, the king, and the others would capture the demon monkeys in the lower realms, but there will be no return in one day, and the outcome is unknown. The Bodhisattva ordered the foolish man to come here to inquire about the truth."" Li Tianwang said: ""I came here yesterday to set up camp and challenge with the Nine Lights Star; After being manipulated by this guy, Jiu Yao Xing was defeated and returned. Later, I waited to raise troops in person, and that guy also lined up. I waited for 100,000 heavenly soldiers to fight with him until the night, and he used a clone method to fight back. When the troops were withdrawing to investigate, they only caught some wolves, tigers, leopards, etc., but never caught half of his demon monkeys. I haven't played yet today.""","When the Bodhisattva heard this, she said to Disciple Hui’an, “You must leave Heaven at once, go down to the Flower-Fruit Mountain, and inquire into the military situation. If the enemy is engaged, you can lend your assistance; in any event, you must bring back a factual report.” The Disciple Hui’an straightened out his attire and mounted the cloud to leave the palace, an iron rod in his hand. When he arrived at the mountain, he found layers of cosmic net drawn tightly and sentries at every gate holding bells and shouting passwords. The encirclement of the mountain was indeed watertight! Hui’an stood still and called out, “Heavenly sentinels, may I trouble you to announce my arrival? I am Prince Mokṣa, second son of Devarāja Li, and I am also Hui’an, senior disciple of Guanyin of South Sea. I have come to inquire about the military situation.” The divine soldiers of the Five Mountains at once reported this beyond the gate. The constellations Aquarius, Pleiades, Hydra, and Scorpio then conveyed the message to the central tent. Devarāja Li issued a directorial flag, which ordered the cosmic nets to be opened and entrance permitted for the visitor. Day was just dawning in the east as Hui’an followed the flag inside and prostrated himself before the Four Great Devarājas and Devarāja Li. After he had finished his greetings, Devarāja Li said, “My child, where have you come from?” “Your untutored son,” said Hui’an, “accompanied the Bodhisattva to attend the Festival of Immortal Peaches. Seeing that the festival was desolate and the Jasper Pool laid waste, the Bodhisattva led the various deities and your untutored son to have an audience with the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor spoke at length about Father and King’s expedition to the Region Below to subdue the baneful monkey. Since no report has returned for a whole day and neither victory nor defeat has been ascertained, the Bodhisattva ordered your untutored son to come here to find out how things stand.” “We came here yesterday to set up the encampment,” said Devarāja Li, “and the Nine Luminaries were sent to provoke battle. But this fellow made a grand display of his magical powers, and the Nine Luminaries all returned defeated. After that, I led the troops personally to confront him, and the fellow also brought his forces into formation. Our hundred thousand celestial soldiers fought with him until evening, when he retreated from the battle by using the magic of body division. When we recalled the troops and made our investigation, we found that we had captured some wolves, crawling creatures, tigers, leopards, and the like. But we did not even catch half a monkey monster! And today we have not yet gone into battle.”","When Guanyin heard this, she ordered Hui Yan to leave Heaven at once and go down to the Mountain Garden and enquire about the battle, and added, “If the two parties should be about equal in strength, you must give a helping hand to the celestial hosts and return quickly with the tidings.” Hui Yan straightened his clothes and, taking an iron staff in his hand, mounted a cloud and went straight to the mountain, which he saw covered with soldiers, regiment upon regiment. Then he called upon the gatekeeper of the camp to announce his arrival, saying, “I am Guanyin’s chief disciple, Hui Yan, the son of Guardian King Li, sent to enquire how the battle goes on.” Guardian King Li invited him to enter. When Hui Yan saw the Four Guardians of Heaven and Guardian King Li, he fell on his knees and paid his respects. The king asked, “My son, where do you come from?” He replied, “I came with Guanyin to attend the Peach Banquet, but when we arrived and saw everything in disorder, Guanyin led all the guests to see the Jade Emperor. He told us how he had sent a host to subjugate the monkey demons, but had not received any tidings as to the progress of the war, consequently Guanyin sent me down here to make enquiries and report.” Guardian King Li then told him all about the previous day’s battle.","Guanyin now told Hui’an—who also happened to be the second son of King Li, the heavenly general—to go to Flower-Fruit Mountain. “Help out on the battlefield, if they need it. Then come back and tell us exactly what’s going on.” Approaching by cloud as dawn broke, Hui’an found the mountain thickly shrouded in overlapping nets, guarded by sentries shouting passwords at one another. “It’s Hui’an, second prince of King Li, Guanyin’s senior disciple,” he told them. “I’ve been sent to inquire about the state of play here.” Once the message had been passed on to the king, the sentries were ordered to open the net and admit Hui’an, who immediately went to kowtow before his father and the other commanders. “What are you doing here, my boy?” asked King Li. Hui’an explained his mission: “Since no one in Heaven had heard anything about the campaign for a while, the Bodhisattva dispatched your stupid, unworthy son to bring news.” King Li recounted the events of the previous day and explained that although they had captured some wolves, snakes, tigers, leopards, and badgers, all the monkeys were still at large. At this moment, a sentry appeared. “The Great Sage is outside the camp with an army of feral monkeys, all baying for a fight.” The heavenly kings immediately set to discussing battle formations.","When the Bodhisattva heard this she said to Huian the Novice, “Hurry down from Heaven to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and find out about the military situation. If you meet with any opposition you may do your bit to help, but the important thing is to bring an accurate report back.” Huian the Novice straightened his robes, took his iron staff, left the palace by cloud, and went straight to the mountain. He saw that with the layer upon layer of heaven-and-earth nets, and the men holding bells and shouting passwords at the gates of the camp, the cordon round the mountain was watertight. Huian stopped and called, “Heavenly soldiers at the gates of the camp, I would trouble you to report that I, Moksa, the second son of Heavenly King Li, also known as Huian, the senior disciple of Guanyin of the Southern Sea, have come to ask about the military situation.” Then the divine soldiers of the Five Mountains inside the camp went in through the gates of the headquarters, where the Rat, the Cock, the Horse and the Hare stars reported the news to the commander of the central corps. Heavenly King Li sent a flag of command with the order that the heaven-and-earth nets were to be opened to let Huian in. The East was just beginning to grow light as Huian followed the flag in and bowed to Heavenly King Li and the four other heavenly kings. “Where have you come from, my son?” asked Heavenly King Li. “Your stupid son accompanied the Bodhisattva to the Peach Banquet, and when she found the banquet deserted and nobody at the Jade Pool, she took me and the other Immortals to see the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor told her that you, father, and the other kings had gone down to the lower world to capture this monkey fiend. As the Jade Emperor has received no news all day on the outcome of the battle, the Bodhisattva sent me here to find out what has happened.” “We arrived here and encamped yesterday,” Heavenly King Li replied, “then sent the Nine Bright Shiners to challenge the enemy to battle, but that wretch used such tremendous magic powers that the Nine Bright Shiners all came back defeated. Then we led out own soldiers into action, and the wretch also drew up his line of battle. Our hundred thousand heavenly soldiers fought an indecisive engagements with him till dusk when he used a spell to divide up his body and force us back. When we withdrew our forces and held an investigation, we found that we had only captured wolves, tigers, leopards, and so on, and had not even taken half a monkey fiend. We have not yet given battle today.”"
“既不怪我，怎么就丢我这一跌？”行者道：“你怎么就这等样小家子，就搂我亲嘴？我因今日有些不自在，若每常好时，便起来开门等你了。你可脱了衣服睡是。”那怪不解其意，真个就去脱衣。行者跳起来，坐在净桶上。那怪依旧复来床上摸一把，摸不着人，叫道：“姐姐，你往那里去了？请脱衣服睡罢。”行者道：,"""If you don't blame me, why did you just throw me down?"" The walker said, ""Why are you such a little guy, hugging me and kissing me? Because I'm a little uncomfortable today, if I always get better, I would get up and open the door and wait. You. You can take off your clothes and go to bed."" That's weird, so the real one went to undress. The walker jumped up and sat on the clean bucket. The monster still came back to touch the bed, but couldn't touch anyone, and shouted, ""Sister, where are you going? Please take off your clothes and sleep."" The walker said:","“If not,” said that monster, “why did you give me such a fall?” “How can you be so boorish,” said Pilgrim, “grabbing me like that and wanting to kiss me? I don’t feel very well today; under normal conditions I would have been up waiting for you and would have opened the door myself. You may take off your clothes and go to sleep.” The fiend did not suspect anything and took off his clothes. Pilgrim jumped up and sat on the chamber pot, while the fiend climbed into bed. Groping around, he could not feel anyone and called out, “Sister, where have you gone? Please take off your clothes and go to sleep.” “You go to sleep first,” said Pilgrim, “for I have to wait until I’ve dropped my load.”",,"“About dinner. Good of you to invite me to share the monk with you, but I can’t today. Now that I’m getting older, your mother’s always after me to be a better demon. So I’ve decided to keep vegetarian four days in every month. I’ll be back to meat tomorrow. Let’s reconvene then.” Curious, thought Red Boy. My father’s never said no to a juicy human in a thousand years. And how could being a vegetarian a few days a month possibly atone for all the evil he has committed? Leaving Bull Demon for a moment, Red Boy went to quiz the goblins he had sent to fetch his father. “Where did you find him?” “On the side of the road.” “You mean you didn’t pick him up from his house? I fear, then, that we have an impostor.","“If you're not angry with me, why did you make me fall over?” “You should have been more thoughtful and not tried hugging me and kissing me. I'm not feeling very well today. If I'd been my usual self I'd have been waiting for you at the door. Take your clothes off and come to bed.” Not realizing what he was up to, the monster undressed. Monkey jumped out of bed and sat on the pot as the monster went back to bed and groped around without finding the girl. “Where've you gone, darling?” he asked."
料应必遇知音者，说破源流万法通。也是他运至时来，自登木筏之后，连日东南风紧，将他送到西北岸前，乃是南赡部洲地界。持篙试水，偶得浅水，弃了筏子，跳上岸来，只见海边有人捕鱼、打雁、挖蛤、淘盐。他走近前，弄个把戏，妆个□【上左“齿”右“可”，下“女”】虎，吓得那些人丢筐弃网，四散奔跑。将那跑不动的拿住一个，剥了他衣裳，也学人穿在身上，摇摇摆摆，穿州过府，在市尘中，学人礼，学人话。朝餐夜宿，一心里访问佛仙神圣之道，觅个长生不老之方。见世人都是为名为利之徒，更无一个为身命者。正是那：,"It is expected that there will be a bosom friend, saying that there is no way to break the source. It was also when he arrived. Since boarding the raft, the southeast wind has been tight for several days, and he was sent to the northwest bank, which is the boundary of Nanzhubuzhou. Holding a pole to test the water, I found shallow water occasionally, abandoned the raft, and jumped ashore, only to see people fishing, hunting wild geese, digging clams, and panning for salt by the sea. He approached, played a trick, made up a tiger [top left ""teeth"" right ""ke"", bottom ""female""] tiger, frightened those people to throw baskets and nets and run in all directions. He grabbed the one who couldn't run, stripped him of his clothes, and wore it on his body like others, swaying, crossing the state and passing the government, and learning people's etiquette and language in the dust of the city. Dinner and overnight stay, wholeheartedly visit the sacred way of the Buddha and immortals, and find a way of immortality. Seeing that people in the world are all for the sake of fame, and none of them are for their own lives. Exactly that:","He’d meet, I think, a true, discerning friend: The source disclosed, all dharma will be known. It was indeed his fortune that, after he boarded the wooden raft, a strong southeast wind (which lasted for days) sent him to the northwestern coast, the border of the South Jambūdvīpa Continent. He took the pole to test the water, and, finding it shallow one day, he abandoned the raft and jumped ashore. On the beach there were people fishing, hunting wild geese, digging clams, and draining salt. He approached them and, making a weird face and some strange antics, he scared them into dropping their baskets and nets and scattering in all directions. One of them could not run and was caught by the Monkey King, who stripped him of his clothes and put them on himself, aping the way humans wore them. With a swagger he walked through counties and prefectures, imitating human speech and human manners in the marketplaces. He rested by night and dined in the morning, but he was bent on finding the way of the Buddhas, immortals, and holy sages, on discovering the formula for eternal youth. He saw, however, that the people of the world were all seekers after profit and fame; there was not one who showed concern for his appointed end. This is their condition:","He went on the raft alone and punted with all his might and was carried out by the tide to the open sea. There day after day he was carried by the Southeast wind to the borders of the Southern Continent. Then he abandoned his raft and went ashore. There on the beach he saw some men fishing, others gathering cockles, others evaporating salt. He went up to them and took the form and motions of a tiger, and so frightened the people that they ran away in all directions, leaving behind their baskets and their nets. Finding one who was unable to run away, he stripped him of his clothes, and put them on as men did, and walked with dignity across the country. When he got to the town, he learnt men’s manners and their language, took his meals by day and slept at night. He searched with all his powers for the place where the Immortals lived. He found all men were in search of fame or riches, and none sought for everlasting life. Ever seeking fame and wealth,","He was in luck, for a strong southeasterly wind blew him directly to the northwest coast of the southern continent. When his bamboo pole told him he was in shallow water, he abandoned the raft for the shoreline, where he encountered humans hunting for fish, wild geese, and clams and dredging salt. He ran at them, making strange faces, and they dropped their baskets and nets and scattered in terror. The monkey king grabbed the slowest of them and stripped him of his clothes. After dressing in them, Monkey made a tour of the continent’s towns and cities, studying human manners and speech. Eight or nine years passed. Monkey remained determined to seek the formula for eternal life, while the humans who surrounded him sought only money and fame, without a thought for their own mortality; no one cared what became of him.","He is bound to find a kindred spirit, To explain the origins and the laws of nature. He had chosen just the right time for his journey. After he boarded his raft the Southeasterly wind blew hard for days on end and bore him to the Northwestern shore of the Southern Continent. Testing the depth of the water with his pole he found that it was shallow, so he abandoned the raft and jumped ashore. He saw humans by the coast, fishing, hunting geese, gathering clams, and extracting salt. He went up to them, leaping around and making faces, which so scared them that they dropped their baskets and nets and fled in all directions as fast as they could. The Monkey King grabbed one of them who was a poor runner, stripped him of his clothes, and dressed himself in them like a human. He swaggered through the provinces and prefectures, learning human behavior and human speech in the market places. Whether he was eating his breakfast or going to bed at nigh he was always asking about Buddhas, Immortals and Sages, and seeking the secret of eternal youth. He observed that the people of the world were too concerned with fame and fortune to be interested in their fates."
正走处，不觉天晚。三藏道：“徒弟，如今天色又晚，却往那里安歇？”行者道：“师父说话差了，出家人餐风宿水，卧月眠霜，随处是家。又问那里安歇，何也？”猪八戒道：“哥啊，你只知道你走路轻省，那里管别人累坠？自过了流沙河，这一向爬山过岭，身挑着重担，老大难挨也！须是寻个人家，一则化些茶饭，二则养养精神，才是个道理。”行者道：“呆子，你这般言语，似有报怨之心。还象在高老庄，倚懒不求福的自在，恐不能也。,"I was walking, I didn't realize it was getting late. Sanzang said: ""Apprentice, it's so late today, but where do you go to rest?"" The traveler said: ""Master's words are bad, monks eat and sleep in water, lie in the moon and sleep in frost, and they are everywhere at home. Asking where to rest, why? Zhu Bajie said: ""Brother, you only know that you walk lightly, and where do you care about others falling? Since crossing the Liusha River, this has always been climbing mountains and mountains, carrying heavy burdens, and the boss is hard to bear! It must be looking for a home, One is to make some tea and rice, and the other is to nurture the spirit, which is the truth."" The traveler said: ""Idiot, you seem to have the heart of retribution for your words. It is also like being in Gao Lao Zhuang, where you are lazy and don't seek happiness. Can't either.","As they journeyed, it was getting late again. “Disciples,” said Tripitaka, “it’s getting late. Where shall we go to spend the night?” “Master,” said Pilgrim, “what you said is not quite right. Those who have left home dine on the winds and rest beside the waters; they sleep beneath the moon and lie on the frost; in short, any place can be their home. Why ask where we should spend the night?” “Elder Brother,” said Zhu Eight Rules, “all you seem to care about is making progress on the journey, and you’ve no concern for the burdens of others. Since crossing the Flowing-Sand River, we have been doing nothing but scaling mountains and peaks, and hauling this heavy load is becoming rather hard on me. Wouldn’t it be much more reasonable to look for a house where we can ask for some tea and rice, and try to regain our strength?” “Idiot,” said Pilgrim, “your words sound as if you begrudge this whole enterprise. If you think that you are still back in the Gao Village, where you can enjoy the comfort that comes to you without your exerting yourself, then you won’t make it!",,"“Where are you going?” asked Monkey. “What about the fan?” “It’s not for lending!” retorted Iron-Fan. Monkey now produced his staff and the two of them did their best to kill each other, like the affectionate in-laws they were. As night fell, however, Iron-Fan realized that Monkey would ultimately get the better of her in a straight fight, so she shook her Palm-Leaf Fan at him: a gust of freezing wind blew him away and she returned victoriously to her cave. Monkey drifted all through the night—like a leaf in a cyclone—until he finally managed to cling to the summit of a mountain as day broke. After catching his breath, he discovered he’d been blown as far as the Lesser Sumeru Mountain, a sacred Buddhist peak. “What a woman!” Monkey sighed in admiration. “Now, how do I get back on course?” Remembering that the mountain was home to a Bodhisattva with substantial magic powers, one Lingji, he followed the sound of bells to present himself at Lingji’s temple. “Well done, Monkey!” Lingji congratulated him, hopping off his throne. “Back with the scriptures already?” “Not exactly,” replied Monkey. “Then what are you doing here? This isn’t on the road to the west.” Monkey explained his latest imbroglio, this time with Princess Iron-Fan. “. . .","Spread out like dots across the distant sky. As they were travelling along one day, evening drew in, and Sanzang said, “Where are we going to sleep, disciples, now that it's getting late?” “That's not the right thing to say, master,” said Monkey. “We monks are supposed to eat the wind and drink the rain, and sleep under the moon and in the frost. Our home is wherever we are. So why ask where we're going to sleep?” “You may think that you've had an easy journey,” said Pig, “but you don't give a damn about other people being tired. Ever since we crossed the Flowing Sands River we've been going over mountain ranges, and this heavy load has fairly worn me out. We've got to find a house where we can beg some tea and food and have a good rest—it's only fair.” “It sounds to me, idiot, as though you're having regrets,” said Monkey. “I'm afraid you can't have such an easy life now as you did back in Gao Village."
那怪闻言笑道：“你原来是那闹天宫的弼马温么？”行者最恼的是人叫他弼马温，听见这一声，心中大怒，骂道：“你这贼怪！偷了袈裟不还，倒伤老爷！不要走！看棍！”那黑汉侧身躲过，绰长枪，劈手来迎。两家这场好杀：如意棒，黑缨枪，二人洞口逞刚强。分心劈脸刺，着臂照头伤。这个横丢阴棍手，那个直拈急三枪。白虎爬山来探爪，黄龙卧道转身忙。喷彩雾，吐毫光，两个妖仙不可量：一个是修正齐天圣，一个是成精黑大王。这场山里相争处，只为袈裟各不良。那怪与行者斗了十数回合，不分胜负。渐渐红日当午，那黑汉举枪架住铁棒道：“孙行者，我两个且收兵，等我进了膳来，再与你赌斗。”行者道：,"The strange heard the words and said with a smile: ""Are you originally the Bi Ma Wen who haunted the Heavenly Palace?"" The traveler was most annoyed when people called him Bi Ma Wen. Hearing this, he was furious and cursed: ""You thief! If you stole the cassock and don't return it, you will hurt the master! Don't go! Look at the stick!"" The black man dodged sideways, with a long spear, and he opened his hand to greet him. The two are good to kill: Ruyi sticks, black tassel spears, and the two of them are brave. Distracted, stabbed in the face, stabbed in the arm and hurt the head. This one threw a slut, and that one shot three times in a hurry. The white tiger climbed the mountain to explore its claws, and Huanglong turned around and was busy. Spraying colorful mist and spitting out light, two immortals are immeasurable: one is the revisionist Monkey King, and the other is the black king. This fight in the mountains is only because of the bad robes. The monster and the walker fought for more than ten rounds, and there was no winner or loser. Gradually, when the sun became red, the black man raised his gun and held the iron rod and said: ""Sun Xingzhe, I will withdraw the two soldiers. When I have lunch, I will gamble with you again."" Xingzhe said:","When the monster heard these words, he laughed and said, “So you are the BanHorsePlague who disturbed the Celestial Palace?” What most annoyed Pilgrim was when people called him BanHorsePlague. The moment he heard that name, he lost his temper. “You monstrous rogue!” he shouted. “You would not return the cassock you stole, and yet you dare insult this holy monk. Don’t run away! Watch this rod!” The swarthy fellow jumped aside to dodge the blow; wielding his long lance, he went forward to meet his opponent. That was some battle between the two of them: The compliant rod, The black-tasseled lance. Two men display their power before the cave: Stabbing at the heart and face; Striking at the head and arm. This one proves handy with a death-dealing rod; That one tilts the lance for swift, triple jabs. The “white tiger climbing the mountain” extends his paws; The “yellow dragon lying on the road”9 turns his back. With colored mists flying And bright flashes of light, Two monster-gods’ strength is yet to be tried. One’s the truth-seeking, Equal-to-Heaven Sage; One’s the Great Black King who’s now a spirit. Why wage this battle in the mountain still? The cassock, for which each would aim to kill! That monster fought with Pilgrim for more than ten rounds until about noon, but the battle was a draw. Using his lance to halt the rod for a moment, the swarthy fellow said, “Pilgrim Sun, let us put away our weapons for the time being. Let me have some lunch first, and then I’ll wage a further contest with you.” “Accursed beast!” said Pilgrim.",,"“Don’t tease him,” Pigsy urged. “Undo the spell.” “You’re the favorite,” Monkey replied. “You undo it. Anyway, didn’t I say I’d go back to Flower-Fruit after defeating the monster?” Sandy now kneeled before him. “If we had the power to rescue Tripitaka, why would we have needed to fetch you back?” “All right, all right.” Monkey chanted a spell, spat a mouthful of water over the tiger, and Tripitaka reappeared before them. Master and Monkey were joyfully reunited. “I owe you my life!” Tripitaka exclaimed. “When we return to China, I’ll tell the Tang emperor that you are my best and favorite disciple.” “Don’t mention it!” Monkey shrugged, laughing. “Just don’t give me any more headaches, all right?” And after a lavish feast at the court of Precious Image, the four pilgrims set off again for the west. Chapter Twenty-Two","On hearing this the fiend laughed and said, “So you're the Protector of the Horses who wrecked Heaven, are you?” Monkey, who got angrier at being addressed by this title than at anything else, was furious. “You vicious monster. You steal the cassock and refuse to give it back, and on top of that you insult your lord and master. Just hold it, and see how you like my club.” The dark fellow dodged the blow and then riposted with his spear. The pair of them fought a fine battle. An As-You-Will cudgel, A black-tasseled spear, And two men showing their toughness at the mouth of a cave. One stabs at heart and face, The other tries for arm and head. This one strikes cunning sideswipes with a club, That one brandishes his spear in three swift movements. The white tiger climbs the mountain to sink in his claws; The yellow dragon lying on the road turns round fast. Snorting out coloured mists, Disgorging rays of light, The two immortal fiends are hard to choose between: One is the Sage Equaling Heaven who has cultivated the truth; The other is the Great Black King become a spirit. On this battlefield in the mountains The pair of them fight for the cassock. The fiend fought some ten inconclusive rounds with Monkey, and as the sun was now rising steadily towards the zenith, the dark fellow raised his halberd to block the iron cudgel and said, “Brother Monkey, let's lay down our arms. I'll come back and fight you again after I've eaten.” “You accursed beast,” Monkey replied, “how can you call yourself a real man?"
“你再念念看。”三藏真个又念，行者真个又痛，只教：“莫念！莫念！念动我就痛了！这是怎么说？”三藏道：“你今番可听我教诲了？”行者道：“听教了！”“你再可无礼了？”行者道：“不敢了！”他口里虽然答应，心上还怀不善，把那针儿幌一幌，碗来粗细，望唐僧就欲下手，慌得长老口中又念了两三遍，这猴子跌倒在地，丢了铁棒，不能举手，只教：“师父！我晓得了！再莫念！再莫念！”三藏道：“你怎么欺心，就敢打我？”行者道：“我不曾敢打，我问师父，你这法儿是谁教你的？”三藏道：“是适间一个老母传授我的。”行者大怒道：“不消讲了！这个老母，坐定是那个观世音！他怎么那等害我！等我上南海打他去！”三藏道：,"""Look at it again."" Sanzang really recites it again and again, and the practitioner is really painful, and only teaches: ""Mo Nian! Don't Nian! I feel pain when I think about it! How do you say this?"" Sanzang said: ""You this time Have you listened to my teaching?"" The walker said: ""Listen to the teaching!"" ""Are you rude anymore?"" The walker said, ""Don't dare!"" Although he promised in his mouth, he still had bad intentions in his heart, so he put the needle As soon as he made a guise, the thickness of the bowl came, and the monk wanted to start, but the elder was so flustered that he recited it two or three times. The monkey fell to the ground, lost the iron rod, and could not raise his hand, he only taught: ""Master! I understand! Don't read it again! Don't read it again!"" Sanzang said: ""How dare you deceive your heart and dare to hit me?"" The walker said: ""I never dared to hit me, I ask Master, who taught you this method?"" Sanzang said : ""It was taught to me by an old mother at the right time."" The traveler said angrily: ""No need to talk about it! This old mother, sit down to be that Guanyin! How can he harm me like that! Wait for me to go to the South China Sea to beat him!"" Sanzang said:","Tripitaka accordingly began to recite, and the Pilgrim immediately started to hurt. “Stop! Stop!” he cried. “I hurt the moment you begin to recite. How do you explain that?” “Will you listen now to my instructions?” asked Tripitaka. “Yes, I will,” replied Pilgrim. “And never be unruly again?” “I dare not,” said Pilgrim. Although he said that with his mouth, Pilgrim’s mind was still devising evil. One wave of the needle and it had the thickness of a rice bowl ; he aimed it at the Tang Monk and was about to slam it down on him. The priest was so startled that he went through the recitation two or three more times. Falling to the ground, the monkey threw away the iron rod and could not even raise his hands. “Master,” he said, “I’ve learned my lesson! Stop! Please stop!” “How dare you be so reckless,” said Tripitaka, “that you should want to strike me?” “I wouldn’t dare strike you,” said Pilgrim, “but let me ask you something. Who taught you this magic?” “It was an old woman,” said Tripitaka, “who imparted it to me a few moments ago.” Growing very angry, Pilgrim said, “You needn’t say anything more! The old woman had to be that Guanshiyin! Why did she want me to suffer like this? I’m going to South Sea to beat her up!” “If she had taught me this magic,” said Tripitaka, “she had to know it even before I did.","They were pressed to stay over the Lantern Festival on the 15th. The pilgrims had lost their reckoning of days and months and were glad to start afresh. The lanterns were very brilliant with silk gauze and horn, and were to burn for three nights only. Only the best quality of oil was provided and the expense was enormous, amounting to 48,000 taels. Buddha was to appear the last night, and on his appearance all the lamps would go out before the brightness of Buddha himself, and all the people would disappear in honor of his presence. But the Master, having come all the way from China to see Buddha, determined he would stay and see Buddha there and then. Sun looked on, and declared it was all a false deception. At this moment, a great wind arose and carried away all the oil, and the Master was whirled away to the Blue Dragon mountain, where demons had lived in a cave for 1,000 years. When the pilgrims discovered where their Master was hidden, they attacked the demons, demanding the Master’s liberty, and fought a hundred and fifty pitched battles, but were not successful. They returned to the temple, and related their failure to the monks. After consultation, they decided to go again and attack the demons in the night, lest it should be too late if they waited till the morning. The disciples hastened to save their Master. Sun changed himself into a fly and having got in, found his Master, and unbound him whilst all the demons were asleep. But on their way out, owing to some accident, all were aroused and the Master was retaken, and again bound. Zhu Bajie and Sha the Monk were also taken and bound. In this extremity, Sun decided to go to Heaven and seek celestial soldiers to help him. First he went back to the temple, and told the monks what had befallen him and that he was going to Heaven to ask for help. At this they were astonished, and asked.","“Shout ‘Sandy’ and he’ll come out. Get him to surrender to Tripitaka, then arrange that skull necklace he’s wearing around this gourd, which will transform into a boat of enlightenment to carry them over the river.” Hui’an and Monkey cloud-traveled back to the river. As soon as he saw them, Pigsy began to thank Hui’an over-effusively for introducing him to Guanyin a few years back. “No time for that,” Monkey interrupted. “Let’s get this creature out of the river.” After Monkey had quickly explained to his two traveling companions that the fiend was Tripitaka’s third and final disciple, Hui’an took up position on a cloud above the river. “Sandy!” he called. “The pilgrim is waiting for you.” On hearing his religious name, the terrified fiend lurking on the riverbed knew that the messenger had to be from Guanyin. Rushing to the surface, he smiled and bowed at Hui’an, who passed on the instructions about the boat and pointed out Tripitaka on the riverbank. Sandy shuddered when he spotted Pigsy standing nearby. “That rude creature has been terrorizing me since yesterday. Why didn’t he tell me he was part of the scripture pilgrimage? And that monkey tried to kill me three times. I’m not going anywhere near them.” “There’s nothing to be afraid of,” Hui’an reassured him. “Those are your fellow disciples, all recruited by Guanyin. Look, I’ll make the introductions.” Finally agreeing to put away his staff, Sandy clambered onto the riverbank and kneeled before Tripitaka.","“Say it again and see what happens,” said Monkey, and when Sanzang did as he asked, Monkey's head ached again. “Stop, stop,” he shouted, “the moment you started reciting it my head ached. Why did you do it?” “Will you accept my instruction now?” Sanzang asked. “Yes,” Monkey replied. “Will you misbehave again in future?” “I certainly won't,” said Monkey. Although he had made this verbal promise, he was still nurturing evil thoughts, and he shook his needle in the wind till it was as thick as a ricebowl. He turned on the Tang Priest, and was on the point of finishing him off when the terrified Sanzang recited the spell two or three more times. The monkey dropped his cudgel and fell to the ground, unable to raise his arm, “Master,” he shouted, “I've seen the light. Stop saying the spell, please stop.” “How could you have the perfidy to try to kill me?” asked Sanzang. “I'd never have dared,” said Brother Monkey, adding, “who taught you that spell, master?” “An old lady I met just now,” replied Sanzang. Monkey exploded with rage. “Tell me no more,” he said, “I'm sure and certain the old woman was that Guanyin. How could she do this to me? Just you wait. I'm going to the Southern Sea to kill her.” “As she taught me this spell,” Sanzang replied, “she's bound to know it herself."
一点灵光彻太虚，那条拄杖亦如之：或长或短随人用，横竖横排任卷舒。,"A little bit of spiritual light is too empty, so is the cane: it can be long or short according to the person, and it can be rolled and stretched horizontally, vertically and horizontally.","A spirit beam filling the supreme void— That’s how the rod behaves accordingly. It lengthens or shortens as one would wish; Upright or prone, it grows or shrinks at will.","Lasts long or short as man wills to spend it,","Taking his magic staff out of his ear, Monkey turned it into a cudgel and went on such a rampage that the Nine Luminaries and Four Heavenly Kings preferred to stay at home and pretend they couldn’t hear anything.","A single point of magic light can fill the whole of space; Likewise that staff of his: Longer or shorter, depending on his needs, Upright or horizontal, it can shrink or grow."
“你这个猴子，还是这等放泼！他又不曾偷你袈裟，又不与你相识，又无甚冤仇，你怎么就将他打死？”行者道：“菩萨，你认他不得。他是那黑熊精的朋友。他昨日和一个白衣秀士，都在芳草坡前坐讲。后日是黑精的生日，请他们来庆佛衣会。今日他先来拜寿，明日来庆佛衣会，所以我认得，定是今日替那妖去上寿。”菩萨说：“既是这等说来，也罢。”行者才去把那道人提起来看，却是一只苍狼。旁边那个盘儿底下却有字，刻道：凌虚子制。行者见了，笑道：“造化！造化！”老孙也是便益，菩萨也是省力。这怪叫做不打自招，那怪教他今日了劣。”菩萨说道：,"""You monkey, you're still so rude! He never stole your cassock, he didn't know you, and he didn't have any grudges, so why did you kill him?"" The walker said, ""Bodhisattva, you can't recognize him. He is a friend of the black bear spirit. Yesterday, he and a white-robed scholar sat in front of Fangcao Slope and gave a talk. The day after tomorrow is the black spirit's birthday, so I invite them to celebrate the Buddha's Clothing. Yes, so I recognize that it must be today to celebrate the birthday of the demon."" The Bodhisattva said, ""It's okay to say that."" The practitioner went to bring the Taoist person to look at it, but it was a wolf. There is a word under the plate next to it, engraved: Ling Xuzi system. When the practitioner saw it, he smiled and said, ""Good luck! Good luck!"" The old grandson was also beneficial, and the Bodhisattva was also labor-saving. This weirdness is called not trying to recruit oneself, and that weirdness taught him to be bad today. ""The Buddha said:","Completely stunned, the Bodhisattva said, “Monkey, you are still so reckless! He didn’t steal your cassock; he neither knew nor wronged you. Why did you kill him with one blow?” “Bodhisattva,” said Pilgrim, “you may not recognize him, but he is a friend of the Black Bear Spirit. Yesterday he was having a conversation with a white-robed scholar on the grass meadow. Since they were invited to the cave of the Black Bear Spirit, who was going to give a Festival of the Buddha Robe to celebrate his birthday, this Daoist said that he would first go to celebrate his friend’s birthday today and then attend the festival tomorrow. That’s how I recognized him. He must have been on his way to celebrate the monster’s birthday.” “If that’s how it is, all right,” said the Bodhisattva. Pilgrim then went to pick up the Daoist and discovered that he was a gray wolf. The tray, which had fallen to one side, had an inscription on the bottom: “Made by Master Transcending Void.” When Pilgrim saw this, he laughed and said, “What luck! What luck! Old Monkey will benefit; the Bodhisattva will save some energy. This monster may be said to have made a confession without torture, while the other monster may be destined to perish today.” “What are you saying, Wukong?” said the Bodhisattva.",,"Me!” squeaked Cunning Devil and Wily Worm. “And where were you going just now, my little ones?” Monkey asked. “Our great kings Golden Horn and Silver Horn have ordered us to capture Monkey,” Cunning Devil replied. “Tripitaka’s disciple?” Monkey smoothly interpolated. “That mannerless ape has crossed me one too many times. I’ll lend a hand.” “No need,” said the imp. “Our king has already pinned the monkey down. All we’ve got to do is bottle him up in these two treasures of ours.” “How do they work?”","“Are you still as wild as this, you ape?” the shocked Bodhisattva asked. “He didn't steal your cassock, you didn't even know him, and he was no enemy of yours. Why kill him?” “You may not know him, Bodhisattva,” Monkey replied, “but he was a friend of the Black Bear Spirit. Yesterday they and a white-clad scholar were sitting talking in front of the grassy mountainside. Today is the Black Spirit's birthday, and tomorrow he was coming to the 'Buddha's Robe Banquet'. That's why I recognized him. I'm sure that he was coming to greet that monster on his birthday.” “If that's the way it is, very well then,” said the Bodhisattva. Monkey then went to lift up the Taoist to take a look at him, and he saw that he had been a grey wolf. There was an inscription under the glass salver that lay beside him. It read, “Made by Master Emptiness-reached” . Brother Monkey laughed and sand, “What luck, what luck. This helps me and will save you trouble too, Bodhisattva. This monster has confessed of his own free will, and the other monster there can be finished off today.” “What do you mean?”"

有诗为证，诗曰：祥光霭霭凝金象，万道缤纷实可夸。普济世人垂悯恤，遍观法界现金莲。今来多为传经意，此去原无落点瑕。,"There is a poem to prove it, the poem says: Xiangguang mist condenses golden elephants, and the colorfulness of all paths can be boasted. Puji people in the world are sympathetic and look at the lotus in the Dharma realm. Today, it is mostly to pass on the meaning of the scriptures, and there are no flaws in the original.","We have a testimonial poem: Auspicious light surrounds the golden form: What maze of colors so worthy of praise! She shows great mercy to succor mankind, To reveal gold lotus as she scans the world.

She saves all men, giving of her pity, Surveying the whole universe and revealing the golden lotus. Many shall now preach the scriptures' meaning, Nor shall there be any flaw therein."
“师父，鞍辔奉上。”三藏见了，欢喜领受，教行者拿了，背上马看，可相称否。行者走上前，一件件的取起看了，果然是些好物。有诗为证，诗曰：雕鞍彩晃柬银星，宝凳光飞金线明。衬屉几层绒苫迭，牵疆三股紫丝绳。辔头皮札团花粲，云扇描金舞兽形。环嚼叩成磨炼铁，两垂蘸水结毛缨。行者心中暗喜，将鞍辔背在马上，就似量着做的一般。三藏拜谢那老，那老慌忙搀起道：“惶恐！惶恐！何劳致谢？”那老者也不再留，请三藏上马。那长老出得门来，攀鞍上马，行者担着行李。那老儿复袖中取出一条鞭儿来，却是皮丁儿寸札的香藤柄子，虎筋丝穿结的梢儿，在路旁拱手奉上道：“圣僧，我还有一条挽手儿，一发送了你罢。”那三藏在马上接了道：“多承布施！多承布施！”正打问讯，却早不见了那老儿，及回看那里社祠，是一片光地。只听得半空中有人言语道：“圣僧，多简慢你。我是落伽山山神土地，蒙菩萨差送鞍辔与汝等的。汝等可努力西行，却莫一时怠慢。”慌得个三藏滚鞍下马，望空礼拜道：“弟子肉眼凡胎，不识尊神尊面，望乞恕罪。烦转达菩萨，深蒙恩佑。”你看他只管朝天磕头，也不计其数，路旁边活活的笑倒个孙大圣，孜孜的喜坏个美猴王，上前来扯住唐僧道：“师父，你起来罢，他已去得远了，听不见你祷祝，看不见你磕头。只管拜怎的？”长老道：,"""Master, give me the saddle and bridle."" Sanzang saw it and accepted it with joy. The instructor took it and mounted it on his horse to see if it was worth it. The walker stepped forward and picked up one by one to look at it, and it turned out to be some good things. There is a poem as proof, the poem says: The carved saddle is colorful and the silver star of Cambodia is shining, and the bench is bright and golden. The lining drawer is lined with several layers of velvet thatch, pulling three strands of purple silk rope. The head of the bridle is covered with flowers, and the cloud fan depicts the shape of a golden dancing beast. The ring is chewed and knocked into honed iron, and the two hangs are dipped in water to form tassels. The walker was secretly delighted, and put the saddle and bridle on the horse, as if he were doing it according to the measure. Sanzang thanked the old man, and the old man hurriedly said, ""Frightened! Frightened! Why bother to thank you?"" The old man no longer stayed, and asked Sanzang to mount. The elder was able to go out, mount the horse in the saddle, and the traveller with his luggage. The old man took out a whip from his sleeve, but it was Pi Ding'er's fragrant vine handle, the tip of which was tied with tiger tendons, and he handed it over by the roadside and said, ""Holy monk, I still have a whip. Hand, as soon as I send it to you."" The Sanzang immediately took it and said, ""Give a lot! Give a lot!"" Just as he was making an inquiries, the old man had long since disappeared, and when he looked back at the shrine there, it was full of light. land. I could only hear someone in the air saying, ""Holy monk, please be gentle. I am from the land of the gods of Mount Luoga, and I was sent by the Bodhisattva to send saddles and bridles to you. You can try your best to travel west, but don't be neglected for a while."" A Sanzang got off his horse, looked at the sky, and said: ""This disciple is mortal, but he doesn't know the face of the gods. He begs for forgiveness. Please pass on to the Bodhisattva, and I am deeply blessed."" On the side of the road, Dasheng Sun was laughing alive, and the beautiful Monkey King was diligently pleased and displeased. He stepped forward and grabbed Tang Seng and said, ""Master, get up, he has gone far away, he can't hear your prayers, and he can't see you kowtow. Just worship what?"" the elder said:","He set them down in the corridor, saying, “Master, I am presenting you with this harness.” When Tripitaka saw it, he accepted it with delight and asked Pilgrim to try the saddle on the horse. Going forward, Pilgrim took up the accoutrements and examined them piece by piece. They were indeed some magnificent articles, for which we have a testimonial poem. The poem says: The carved saddle shines with studs of silver stars. The precious seat glows with bright threads of gold. The pads are stacks of fine-spun woolen quilts. The reins are three bands of purple cords of silk. The bridle’s leather straps are shaped like flowers. The flaps have gold-etched forms of dancing beasts. The rings and bit are made of finest steel. Waterproof tassels dangle on both sides. Secretly pleased, Pilgrim put the saddle on the back of the horse, and it seemed to have been made to measure. Tripitaka bowed to thank the old man, who hastily raised him up, saying, “It’s nothing! What do you need to thank me for?” The old man did not ask them to stay any longer; instead, he urged Tripitaka to mount. The priest came out of the gate and climbed into the saddle, while Pilgrim followed, hauling the luggage. The old man then took a whip out from his sleeve, with a handle of rattan wrapped in strips of leather, and the strap knitted with cords made of tiger ligaments. He stood by the side of the road and presented it with hands uplifted, saying, “Holy Monk, I have a whip here that I may as well give you.” Tripitaka accepted it on his horse, saying, “Thanks for your donation! Thanks for your donation!” Even as he was saying this, the old man vanished. The priest turned around to look at the Lishe Shrine, but it had become just a piece of level ground. From the sky came a voice saying, “Holy Monk, I’m sorry not to have given you a better reception! I am the local spirit of Potalaka Mountain, who was sent by the Bodhisattva to present you with the harness. You two must journey to the West with all diligence. Do not be slothful in any moment.” Tripitaka was so startled that he fell off his horse and bowed toward the sky, saying, “Your disciple is of fleshly eyes and mortal stock, and he does not recognize the holy visage of the deity. Please forgive me. I beseech you to convey my gratitude to the Bodhisattva.” Look at him! All he could do was to kowtow toward the sky without bothering to count how many times! By the side of the road the Great Sage Sun reeled with laughter, the Handsome Monkey King broke up with hilarity. He came up and tugged at his master, saying, “Master, get up! He is long gone! He can’t hear you, nor can he see your kowtowing. Why keep up this adoration?”","Now I have three kinds of sacred books by which men can be delivered from their troubles and by which an end can be put to their sins. The three kinds of sacred books are the dharma, which deals with the laws of Heaven, the sastras, which deal with the laws of earth, and the third are the sutras, which deal with they ways to save lost souls. In all, they number 35 works and 15,144 books, and are all sacred in that they show men how to be upright and good. All the knowledge of the four great continents, of the heavens, and the earth, of the races of men, of birds, and beasts, of flowers, of forestry and manufactures are complete in them. Since you have come a long distance, I must give you a complete set to carry back. But your people are ignorant and gross, calumniating the true scriptures and not understanding the deep meaning of our teachings. Call my two chief disciples, Ananda and Kasyapa. Let them lead these four travelers, first to the dining hall to dine, and then to the Library, and from each of the 35 works select a few to take back with them to circulate in the East.” Ananda and Kasyapa led them below, where they saw strange precious things in thousands. Gifts were provided for each of the pilgrims, and a vegetable banquet spread before them. All was of the very best, the choicest food, the most delicate tea, the finest fruit of all kinds, different from anything on earth among men. The Master and disciples raised the dishes to their heads in thanks for Buddha’s grace and then enjoyed them. Truly, their reigns golden light as bright as day, All kinds of nameless sweet incense, The eye meets a thousand trees in the beautiful palace, And the sweetest music charms the ear beyond all earthly strains, There the saints never grow old, Once partaking of celestial food, they live forever. All the sorrows of life are past, And now eternal glory and joy are attained. It was great bliss to Zhu Bajie and Sha the Monk to be at Buddha’s palace, and enjoy to their hearts’ content the banquet of immortals, who had cast off their mortal coils of bones and flesh and blood. Ananda and Kasyapa honored their guests with their presence. When their meal was over, the pilgrims were led to the Sacred Library, where books were stored in cupboards and boxes all with red labels of their names. After the four had seen the list of books, Ananda and Kasyapa said, if they were going to pay for the volumes, they would be given them at once. The Master replied that he had not been prepared to pay, as he understood the Scriptures were to be presented to them. The two smiled and said, “If we give away our Scriptures for nothing, we shall die of starvation.”","Pigsy bolted up. “What time is it?” “Time to get up! Tripitaka says we should forget about food and just find somewhere to sleep.” A bleary Pigsy made his way back into the forest with Sandy. There, of course, they discovered that Tripitaka had disappeared. “It’s all your fault for not coming back sooner with something to eat,” complained Sandy. “I’ll bet you a basket of scriptures Tripitaka’s been kidnapped by a monster.” “A monster in a forest?” scoffed Pigsy. “Ridiculous. He must have gone sightseeing. We’ll find him soon enough.” The two of them scooped up the luggage and the horse, and made their way out of the woods in search of Tripitaka. It just so happened that Tripitaka was not yet destined to be dinner, for the two disciples soon spotted the pagoda’s golden light. “Scrumptious news!” exclaimed Pigsy. “Tripitaka is doubtless inside that pagoda right now, stuffing his face. Let’s go before Tripitaka finishes it all off!” “We don’t know what sort of a place this is,” cautioned Sandy. “Let’s do a little reconnaissance first.” Approaching, they discovered over the front door an inscribed slab of white jade. “‘Residence of Lord Yellow-Robe, Cave of the Tidal Moon, Casserole Mountain,’” read Sandy. “This is no temple. This is the den of a monster. If Tripitaka’s inside . . .” “Don’t worry!” said Pigsy. “You see to the horse and the luggage, and I’ll find out what’s what. Open up!” he bellowed, lifting his rake above his head. The goblin on sentry duty ran to report to the monster king: “Two monks at the door. One with big ears and a snout, the other with the most miserable face I’ve ever seen.” “Aha!” chortled the monster. “As expected, our main course’s disciples—also known as starter and dessert. Let’s give them a warm welcome.","As he put it all down in front of the verandah he said, “Master, I humbly offer this saddle and bridle.” When Sanzang saw them he accepted them with delight. Then he told Monkey to put them on the horse to see if they fitted him. Monkey went over and picked them up to look at them one by one: they were all fine pieces. There are some verses to prove it that go The well-carved saddle shines with silver stars The jeweled stirrups gleam with golden light. Several layers of saddle-pads are made from wool, The lead-rope is plaited from purple silk. The reins are inlaid with flashing flowers, The blinkers have dancing animals outlined in gold. The bit is made of tempered steel, And woollen tassels hang from either end. Monkey, who was secretly very pleased, put the saddle and bridle on the horse and found that they fitted as if they had been made to measure. Sanzang knelt and bowed to the old man in thanks, at which the old man rushed forward and said, “No, no, how could I allow you to thank me?” The old man did not try to keep them a moment longer, and bade Sanzang mount the horse. When he was out of the gate Sanzang climbed into the saddle, while Monkey carried the luggage. The old man then produced a whip from his sleeve and offered it to Sanzang as he stood beside the road. Its handle was of rattan bound with leather, and its thong of tiger sinew bound at the end with silk. “Holy monk,” he said, “I would also like to give you this as you leave.” As Sanzang took it sitting on horseback, he thanked the old man for his generosity. As Sanzang was on the point of clasping his hands together to take his leave of him, the old man disappeared, and on turning round to look at the temple, the monk could see nothing but a stretch of empty land. He heard a voice saying in the sky, “Holy monk, we have been very abrupt with you. We are the mountain god and the local deity of Potaraka Island, and we were sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin to give you the saddle and bridle. You two are now to make for the West as fast as you can, and not to slacken your pace for a moment.” Sanzang tumbled out of the saddle in a panic, and worshipped the heavens, saying, “My eyes of flesh and my mortal body prevented me from recognizing you, noble gods; forgive me, I beg you. Please convey my gratitude to the Bodhisattva for her mercy.” Look at him, kowtowing to the sky more often than you could count. The Great Sage Sun Wukong, the Handsome Monkey King, was standing by the path overcome with laughter and beside himself with amusement. He went over and tugged at the Tang Priest. “Master,” he said, “get up."

语言虽利便，身体莫能那。正是五百年前孙大圣，今朝难满脱天罗。,"Although the language is convenient, the body cannot. It was Sun Dasheng 500 years ago, and it is difficult to get rid of Tianluo today.","Luckily, his eyes could still roll about, And the apish tongue, articulate. Though in speech he had great ease, His body he could not move. He was the Great Sage Sun of five hundred years ago. Today his ordeal ends, he leaves Heaven’s net.","From his companions he learnt that they lived in the Lion and Camel Cave, with ten thousand small demons in attendance. The three chiefs, having learnt that the Chinese pilgrim was approaching, under the escort of the terrible Sun, had decided to unite in watching and attacking them.",Well-fed pigs and chickens dozed in pens and coops; cows milled peacefully about. “How about asking to spend a night there before we go on?”,"Although his tongue was nimble, He couldn't move his body.

众仙领命。大仙与明月、清风纵起祥光，来赶三藏，顷刻间就有千里之遥。大仙在云端里向西观看，不见唐僧；及转头向东看时，倒多赶了九百余里。原来那长老一夜马不停蹄，只行了一百二十里路，大仙的云头一纵，赶过了九百余里。仙童道：,"Immortals take orders. Daxian and Mingyue and Qingfeng brought auspicious light to catch Sanzang, and they were thousands of miles away in an instant. Daxian looked westward in the clouds, but saw no Tang Seng; and when he turned his head to look eastward, he had driven more than 900 miles. It turned out that the elder went non-stop all night and only traveled one hundred and twenty miles, while Daxian's cloud head swung forward and drove more than nine hundred miles. Fairy said:","The various immortals took this instruction, while the Great Immortal mounted the auspicious luminosity with Clear Breeze and Bright Moon to give chase to Tripitaka. In a moment they had covered a thousand miles, but when the Great Immortal looked toward the West at the tip of the cloud, he could not see the Tang Monk anywhere. When he turned around and stared eastward instead, he found that he had overtaken the pilgrims by some nine hundred miles, for that elder, even with his horse galloping nonstop all night, had managed to travel only one hundred and twenty miles. Reversing the direction of his cloud, the Great Immortal made the trip back in an instant.",,"Controlling their irritation—and Monkey—Pigsy and Sandy loaded the horse with scrolls, then piled the rest onto carrying poles. The pilgrims kowtowed their thanks to the Buddha, then set off back down the mountain. Back in the Pavilion of Treasures, the Buddha of the Archive had heard and seen everything, including the fact that those two attendants had given the pilgrims the wordless versions of the scripture scrolls. Most Chinese priests, he thought, smiling, are so benighted that they won’t understand the value of the wordless scriptures, and all the effort of the pilgrimage will be wasted. He called the duty librarian over.","The other Immortals did as they were told while the Great Immortal, Bright Moon and Pure Wind pursued Sanzang on a beam of auspicious light. It took them but an instant to cover three hundred miles. The Great Immortal stood on the edge of the clouds and gazed to the West, but he did not see Sanzang; then he turned round to look East and saw that he had left Sanzang over two hundred and fifty miles behind. Even riding all night that venerable gentleman had covered only forty miles, which was why the Great Immortal's cloud had overshot him by a great distance."
判官道：“不差。阴司里是这般，有去路，无来路。如今送陛下自转轮藏出身，一则请陛下游观地府，一则教陛下转托超生。”,"The judge said: ""It's not bad. It's like this in the underworld, there is a way to go, but there is no way to come. Now I send Your Majesty to hide his origins in a revolving wheel. One is to invite His Majesty to visit the underworld, and the other is to teach His Majesty to transfer to the supernatural.""","He asked the judge, “Are we going on the wrong way?” “No,” said the judge, “for this is how it is in the Region of Darkness: there is away for you to come, but there is no way out. Now we must send Your Majesty off from the region of the Wheel of Transmigration, so that you can make a tour of Hell as well as be sent on your way to reincarnation.”","Sun now transformed himself into two false demons. One he placed, instead of himself, in the lasso bound to a pillar, and as the other, he reported to the second demon chief that Sun was struggling hard, and suggested that a stronger rope be used lest the other should break. Then by the change, Sun obtained possession of the magic rope again. After that, by a similar trick, he obtained the magic gourd and vase back.",“Are you sure this is right?” the emperor asked Cui Jue.,"he asked the judge, who replied, “No. In the underworld you can only go; you can never come back. We are now taking Your Majesty out through the Revolving Prayer-wheel; thus you will be able to tour the underworld on your way back to life.”"
“感得太保天恩，搭救出虎狼丛里，就是饿死，也强如喂虎。”伯钦的母亲闻说，叫道：“孩儿不要与长老闲讲，我自有素物，可以管待。”伯钦道：“素物何来？”母亲道：“你莫管我，我自有素的。”叫媳妇将小锅取下，着火烧了油腻，刷了又刷，洗了又洗，却仍安在灶上。先烧半锅滚水别用，却又将些山地榆叶子，着水煎作茶汤，然后将些黄粱粟米，煮起饭来，又把些干菜煮熟，盛了两碗，拿出来铺在桌上。老母对着三藏道：“长老请斋，这是老身与儿妇，亲自动手整理的些极洁极净的茶饭。”三藏下来谢了，方才上坐。那伯钦另设一处，铺排些没盐没酱的老虎肉、香獐肉、蟒蛇肉、狐狸肉、兔肉，点剁鹿肉干巴，满盘满碗的，陪着三藏吃斋。方坐下，心欲举著，只见三藏合掌诵经，唬得个伯钦不敢动著，急起身立在旁边。三藏念不数句，却教“请斋”。伯钦道：“你是个念短头经的和尚？”三藏道：“此非是经，乃是一卷揭斋之咒。”伯钦道：“你们出家人，偏有许多计较，吃饭便也念诵念诵。”,"""I feel so blessed to be rescued from the tigers and wolves. Even if I starve to death, it is better than feeding the tigers."" Bo Qin's mother heard this and called out, ""Don't talk to the elders, I have my own things and can take care of them. Wait."" Bo Qin asked, ""Where did the ingredients come from?"" The mother said, ""Don't worry about me, I have my own."" He asked his daughter-in-law to take off the small pot, set it on fire, and it was greasy, brushed and washed, and washed Washed again, but still on the stove. First, boil half a pot of boiling water and don't use it, but then simmer some elm leaves in water to make tea soup, then cook some yellow sorghum and corn, cook some dried vegetables, put them in two bowls, and spread them out on the on the table. The old mother said to Sanzang: ""Elder, please fast. This is some very clean tea and rice that the old man and his wife and children have arranged by themselves."" Sanzang came down and thanked him before sitting up. Naboqin set up another place, laying out some tiger meat, fragrant deer meat, python meat, fox meat, rabbit meat without salt and no sauce, and ordering dried venison meat. Fang sat down and wanted to lift his heart, but when he saw Sanzang clasping his palms together and chanting the scriptures, Boqin was so frightened that he didn't dare to move, so he got up in a hurry and stood beside him. Sanzang didn't recite a few sentences, but he taught ""please fast"". Boqin said: ""Are you a monk who recites the short-headed sutra?"" Sanzang said: ""This is not a sutra, but a scroll of mantras for breaking the fast."" Boqin said: ""You monks, you have a lot of cares, and you don't even have to eat. chant chant.""","“I am indebted to the Heavenly kindness of the Guardian,” said Tripitaka, “for saving me from the packs of tigers and wolves. Starving to death is better than being food for a tiger.” When Boqin’s mother heard this, she cried, “Son, stop such idle talk with the elder. Let me prepare a vegetarian dish to serve him.” “Where would you get such a dish?” said Boqin. “Never mind. I’ll fix it,” said his mother. She asked her daughter-in-law to take down a small cooking pan and heat it until much of the grease had burned off. They washed and scrubbed the pan again and again and then put it back on the stove and boiled some water in it. Taking some elm leaves from the mountain, they made soup with it, after which they cooked some rice with yellow millet mixed with Indian corn. They also prepared two bowls of dried vegetables and brought it all out to the table. “Elder,” the aged mother said to Tripitaka, “please have some. This is the cleanest and purest food that my daughter-in-law and I have ever prepared.” Tripitaka left his seat to thank her before sitting down again. Boqin removed himself to another place; dishes and bowls full of unsauced and unsalted tiger meat, musk deer meat, serpent meat, fox flesh, rabbit, and strips of cured venison were set before him. To keep Tripitaka company, he sat down and was about to pick up his chopsticks when he saw Tripitaka fold his hands and begin to recite something. Startled, Boqin dared not touch his chopsticks; he jumped up instead and stood to one side. Having uttered no more than a few phrases, Tripitaka said to him, “Please eat.” “You are a priest who likes to recite short scriptures,” said Boqin. “That was not scripture,” said Tripitaka, “only a prayer to be said before meals.” “You people who leave your families,” said Boqin, “are particular about everything! Even for a meal you have to mumble something!”","All things serve them and they enjoy themselves forever, They no longer believe in the dreams of earth. They have cleansed themselves from all the dust of time. THE PILGRIMS TRAVELED ON. Having arrived in the Land of Vermillion, the pilgrims presented the king with the imperial edict from the Emperor of China, in which he described his experiences in hell, how after three days he had been allowed to return to earth, and how, in order to commemorate the event, he had sent the Master in search of the Scriptures, which could save those who were suffering in hell. Now the king of the Land of Vermillion was himself very ill, and had not been able to give audience for some time, therefore he was much interested in this story of the Emperor of China. He issued a proclamation that very day authorizing any able doctors to come and prescribe for him, adding that the one who could cure him would be rewarded with a share in his kingdom. At the sight of this proclamation, Sun decided to have some fun out of it. He offered to cure the king. But when he appeared, the sight of his face, and the manner of his speech, so terrified the king that he fell into a swoon, and the attendants were afraid to let him see the king again. But Sun said that it was not at all necessary for him to see the king again. “If you tie a silk thread to his wrist, I can at the other end find out his disease and prescribe for him.” So a string attached to the king’s palm, and the disease diagnosed by Sun the doctor at a distance. The king admitted that his illness was a grief for the loss of his wife, whom an evil spirit had carried away. Sun at once mounted the clouds to find and attack the evil spirit. To pacify a nation, first attend to the king’s illness. To obtain true religion, one must put away the love of evil. Sun, accompanied by the king, went forth in search of the evil spirit who had imprisoned the king’s wife.","“Who are you and why are you persecuting me?” “Never mind that. Just give me back my horse and I’ll let you be!” Monkey demanded. “It’s a bit late for that—I’m digesting it.” “In that case, it’s an eye for an eye.” After a few more rounds of battle, the dragon—who was, after all, a rather small specimen—escaped by turning into a water snake and vanishing into the grassy undergrowth. Monkey was so enraged by this disappearing trick that smoke poured out of his seven apertures. Reciting a spell, he summoned the local earth and mountain spirits, who promptly kneeled before him. “Show me your shanks and I’ll give you each five blows of my staff to vent my feelings.” “Forgive us for not organizing a welcome party,” they wailed obsequiously. “We’d no idea you’d been released from Five-Phases Mountain.” “All right, I’ll let you off then,” conceded Monkey. “But tell me where that fiendish dragon came from and why he ate my master’s horse.” The spirits were nonplussed.","“Thanks to your great kindness, High Warden, I was saved from the packs of tigers and wolves. Even if I were to starve to death, it would be better than providing a meal for tigers.” Liu Boqin's mother, who had been listening to their conversation, said, “Don't talk nonsense, son. I've got some vegetarian things that we can offer to him.” “Where did you get them from?” Liu Boqin asked, to which mother replied, “Never you mind how, but I've got them.” She told her daughter-in-law to take down the little cooking-pot, burn the fat out of it, scrub it and wash it several times over, then put it back on the stove. Then they half filled it with boiling water that they threw away. Next she poured boiling water on mountain-elm leaves to make tea, boiled up some millet, and cooked some dried vegetables. This was then all put into two bowls and set on the table. Then the old woman said to Sanzang, “Please eat, venerable monk. This is completely pure tea and food that I and my daughter-in-law have prepared.” Sanzang thanked them and sat down in the seat of honour. Another place was laid for Liu Boqin, where were set out bowls and dishes full of the meat of tiger, roebuck, snake, fox, and hare, as well as dried venison, all cooked without salt or sauce, which he was going to eat while Sanzang had his vegetarian meal. He had just sat down and was on the point of picking up his chopsticks when he noticed Sanzang put his hands together to recite some scripture, which so alarmed him that instead of picking up his chopsticks he stood beside him. When Sanzang had recited a few lines he urged Boqin to eat. “Are you a short-sutra monk then?” Boqin asked. “That wasn't a sutra, it was a grace before eating.” “You get up to all sorts of tricks. Fancy reciting sutras at mealtimes,” was Boqin's comment."
休惊了他。”遂上前将御手扶起头来，叫道：“御妹苏醒苏醒。”,"Hugh startled him. Then he stepped forward and lifted Yu's head up with his hands, and shouted, ""My sister is awake and awake. ""","“Don’t startle her!” He went forward and lifted her head with the royal hand, crying out, “Wake up, royal sister!”","If you cannot suppress these, how do you expect to attain enlightenment?” The Master thought awhile and then said, “Oh disciple, when shall we see Buddha face to face?”","“You’ll startle her.” Lifting her head, he called out to wake her.","“Don't wail,” the Tang Emperor said, “don't wail; it might alarm her.” Then he raised her head with his own hand and said, “Wake up, sister, wake up.”"
及至二层门里，只见那里面急急忙忙，走出两个小童儿来。看他怎生打扮：骨清神爽容颜丽，顶结丫髻短发鬅。道服自然襟绕雾，羽衣偏是袖飘风。环绦紧束龙头结，芒履轻缠蚕口绒。丰采异常非俗辈，正是那清风明月二仙童。那童子控背躬身，出来迎接道：“老师父，失迎，请坐。”长老欢喜，遂与二童子上了正殿观看。原来是向南的五间大殿，都是上明下暗的雕花格子。那仙童推开格子，请唐僧入殿，只见那壁中间挂着五彩装成的“天地”二大字，设一张朱红雕漆的香几，几上有一副黄金炉瓶，炉边有方便整香。,"When I got to the second-floor door, I saw that there was a hurry, and two children came out. Let's see how he dresses up: his bones are pure and fresh, his face is beautiful, and his hair is tied in a bun and short hair. The Taoist robes are naturally foggy, and the feather robes tend to have sleeves fluttering in the wind. The ring sash is tightly tied to the faucet, and the awning is lightly wrapped around the silkworm's mouth. Fengcai is unusually non-vulgar, it is the two fairy boys of the breeze and bright moon. The boy bowed his back and came out to greet him, ""Teacher, I'm sorry, please take a seat."" The elder rejoiced and went up to the main hall with the second boy to watch. It turned out to be the five halls facing the south, all of which are carved lattices with bright upper and lower dark. The fairy boy pushed aside the grid and invited Tang Seng to enter the temple, only to see the two characters ""Heaven and Earth"" in multicolored decorations hanging in the middle of the wall, a vermilion carved incense table with a pair of gold stoves on the table, and there is a convenience by the stove. Whole fragrance.","When they passed through the second gate, they were met by two young lads who were hurrying out. Look how they appear: Healthy in bone and spirit with visage fair, On their heads were short bundled tufts of hair. Their Daoist gowns, free falling, seemed wrapped in mists; Their feathered robes, more quaint, for the wind-blown sleeves. Dragon-heads had their sashes knotted tight; Silk cords laced lightly their sandals of straw. Such uncommon looks were of no worldly-born; They were Clear Breeze and Bright Moon, two lads divine. The two young lads came out to meet them, bowing and saying, “Old Master, forgive us for not coming to meet you. Please take a seat.” Delighted, the elder followed the two lads to the main hall to look around. There were altogether five huge chambers facing south, separated by floor-length windows that had carved panes and were translucent at the top and solid at the bottom. Pushing open one of these, the two immortal lads invited the Tang Monk into the central chamber, with a panel hanging on the middle wall on which two large characters—“Heaven, Earth”—were embroidered in five colors. Beneath the panel was a cinnabar-red lacquered incense table, on which there was an urn of yellow gold. Conveniently placed beside the urn were several sticks of incense.",,"“Meditation gets you nothing but a sore bottom. Your precious nirvana still leaves you a rotting corpse. Taoism’s your method if you want to live forever. We collect herbs, dance, clap, and generally milk the energies of heaven and earth, the sun and the moon, yin and yang, fire and water. Taoism is the greatest.” “Taoism is the greatest!” the king and his courtiers echoed, to Tripitaka’s obvious discomfort. His religious preferences notwithstanding, the king still ordered his catering department to prepare a vegetarian banquet for the pilgrims before they resumed their journey westward.","As they went through the second gate they saw two boys come scurrying out. This is what they looked like: Pure bones, lively spirits, pretty faces, And hair tied in childish tufts. Their Taoist robes naturally wreathed in mist, The sleeves of their feather clothes were floating in the wind. Their jade belts were tied with dragon-head knots, Their grass sandals lightly fastened with silk. In their elegance they were unlike common mortals— The Taoist boys Pure Wind and Bright Moon. The two boys bowed and came out to greet them. “We are sorry we did not welcome you properly, venerable master,” they said. “Please sit down.” Sanzang was delighted, and he accompanied the two boys up to the main hall of the temple, which faced South. There was a patterned lattice window that let through the light on top of the door that the boys pushed open. They asked the Tang Priest to come in, and he saw two huge words executed in many colours hanging on the wall—Heaven and Earth. There was an incense table of red carved lacquer on which stood a pair of golden censers and a supply of incense. Sanzang went over to the table and put a pinch of incense in the censers with his left hand while performing triple reverences."
李天王与哪吒叩头谢辞，径至本宫，点起三军，帅众头目，着巨灵神为先锋，鱼肚将掠后，药叉将催兵。一霎时出南天门外，径来到花果山。选平阳处安了营寨，传令教巨灵神挑战。巨灵神得令，结束整齐，轮着宣花斧，到了水帘洞外。只见小洞门外，许多妖魔，都是些狼虫虎豹之类，丫丫叉叉，轮枪舞剑，在那里跳斗咆哮。这巨灵神喝道：“那业畜！快早去报与弼马温知道，吾乃上天大将，奉玉帝旨意，到此收伏；教他早早出来受降，免致汝等皆伤残也。”那些怪，奔奔波波，传报洞中道：“祸事了！祸事了！”猴王问：“有甚祸事？”众妖道：“门外有一员天将，口称大圣官衔，道：奉玉帝圣旨，来此收伏；教早早出去受降，免伤我等性命。”猴王听说，教：“取我披挂来！”就戴上紫金冠，贯上黄金甲，登上步云鞋，手执如意金箍棒，领众出门，摆开阵势。这巨灵神睁睛观看，真好猴王：,"Li Tianwang and Nezha kowtowed and said their thanks, went straight to the palace, and started the three armies. In an instant, he walked out of Nantianmen and came to Huaguo Mountain. He chose to set up a camp in Pingyang, and challenged the giant spirits to teach them. The giant spirit received the order, and the end was neat, and took the Xuanhua axe to the outside of the Water Curtain Cave. I saw outside the door of the small cave, many demons, all of which were wolves, tigers and leopards. The giant spirit god shouted: ""That animal! Hurry up and report to Bi Ma Wen that I know that I am a general of the heavens, and I am here to subdue at the will of the Jade Emperor; teach him to come out early to accept the surrender, so as not to cause all of you to be disabled. ""Those monsters, running around, reported to the cave, ""A disaster! A disaster!"" The Monkey King asked, ""What's wrong?"" The demons said, ""There is a heavenly general outside the door, who is called the Great Sage. : According to the imperial decree of the Jade Emperor, come here to take shelter; teach him to go out early to accept the surrender, so as not to hurt our lives."" The Monkey King heard that, and taught: ""Take me and put it on!"" Cloud shoes, holding a wishful golden cudgel in hand, led the crowd out and set up the battle. This giant spirit opened his eyes to watch, what a good monkey king:","Devarāja Li and Naṭa kowtowed to take leave and went back to their own mansion. After reviewing the troops and their captains and lieutenants, they appointed Mighty-Spirit God to be Vanward Commander, the Fish-Belly General to bring up the rear, and the General of the Yakṣas to urge the troops on. In a moment they left by the South Heaven Gate and went straight to the Flower-Fruit Mountain. A level piece of land was selected for encampment, and the order was then given to the Mighty-Spirit God to provoke battle. Having received his order and having buckled and knotted his armor properly, the Mighty-Spirit God grasped his spreading-flower ax and came to the Water-Curtain Cave. There in front of the cave he saw a great mob of monsters, all of them wolves, insects, tigers, leopards, and the like; they were all jumping and growling, brandishing their swords and waving their spears. “Damnable beasts!” shouted the Mighty-Spirit God. “Hurry and tell the BanHorsePlague that I, a great general from Heaven, have by the authorization of the Jade Emperor come to subdue him. Tell him to come out quickly and surrender, lest all of you be annihilated!” Running pell-mell into the cave, those monsters shouted the report, “Disaster! Disaster!” “What sort of disaster?” asked the Monkey King. “There’s a celestial warrior outside,” said the monsters, “who claims the title of an imperial envoy. He says he came by the holy decree of the Jade Emperor to subdue you, and he orders you to go out quickly and surrender, lest we lose our lives.” Hearing this, the Monkey King commanded, “Get my battle dress!” He quickly donned his red gold cap, pulled on his yellow gold cuirass, slipped on his cloud-treading shoes, and seized the compliant golden-hooped rod. He led the crowd outside and set them up in battle formation. The Mighty-Spirit God opened wide his eyes and stared at this magnificent Monkey King:","The Ruler was glad and appointed Li the Guardian King and his third son, to the command of the expedition. The expedition was ordered to start for earth forthwith. After this the two commanders returned to their respective palaces, and divided the forces into three armies, and the Great Victorious Spirit led the vanguard. All the forces at once left the South Gate of Heaven and arrived at the Mountain Garden, where they encamped, ready for battle. When they reached the Waterfall Cave, they saw innumerable demons drilling with spears and swords as if in battle. The Great Victorious Spirit cried out, “You wild animals, go and announce to the Horse Master that I am a great commander sent to subdue this place. Tell him to come out at once and surrender, lest you all be destroyed.” The demons flew into the cave and cried, “Woe to us! Woe to us! Outside our entrance is one of the commanders from Heaven, who styles himself a holy official, and says he has come by the order of the Jade Emperor to subdue this place, and calls on you to come out at once and surrender, lest we all be destroyed.” The Monkey King on hearing this, merely said, “Bring me my coat of mail.”","The Heavenly King Li Jing and his third son, Prince Nezha, immediately stepped forward. “Your talentless subjects volunteer for this task.” Gratified, the emperor appointed King Li his Monster-Quashing Marshal and ordered father and son to enlist an army to descend to the realm below. The two immortals turned their palace into the campaign headquarters, where they appointed a god named Mighty-Spirit to direct the frontline operations, General Fish-Belly to bring up the rear, and the Commander of Sprites to maintain troop morale. The force passed out of the South Gate and headed straight for Flower-Fruit Mountain, where the immortals selected a flat stretch of terrain to make camp and told Mighty-Spirit to formally declare war. After buckling on his armor and taking up his Ax of Virtue, Mighty-Spirit approached Water-Curtain Cave, in front of which he could see crowds of horrors—wolves, snakes, tigers, leopards, and the like—leaping, roaring, and waving swords and spears. “Damnable beasts!” bellowed Mighty-Spirit. “Tell that stable hand of yours that the Great General of Highest Heaven has come, on the orders of the Jade Emperor, to subdue him. If he does not surrender instantly, we will annihilate the lot of you.” “Oh, calamity!” wailed Monkey’s creatures, scurrying back inside the cave. “Whatever’s wrong?” asked Monkey. His subjects repeated the gist of Mighty-Spirit’s announcement. “Bring me my fighting clothes!” he demanded. Pulling on his purple-gold helmet, his golden armor, and his cloud shoes, he seized his golden-hooped staff and led his troops out of the cave, where he positioned them for battle.","He told them to take their forces down to the lower world at once. Heavenly King Li and Nezha kowtowed, took their leave, went straight back to their own palace, and assembled their troops, commanders and officers. They put the Mighty Miracle God in charge of the vanguard, and General Fishbelly in command of the rear, while General Yaksa was made adjutant. Within an instant they were outside the Southern Gate of Heaven, and they went straight to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. They chose a piece of level and open ground on which to construct a fortified camp, and ordered the Mighty Miracle God to issue the challenge to battle. On receiving this order the Mighty Miracle God tied on his armour firmly and went to the Water Curtain Cave, holding his flower-spreading battle-axe. When he got there he saw huge numbers of devils—wolves, tigers and leopards—wielding spears, brandishing swords, leaping around, fighting each other, and making a great noise outside the little entrance to the cave. “Accursed beasts,” shouted the Mighty Miracle God, “tell the Protector of the Horses at once that I am a heavenly general come on the orders of the Jade Emperor to subdue him. If you make him come out and surrender immediately it will save the lot of you from being wiped out.” The devils went rushing into the cave and reported, “Disaster, disaster.” “What disaster?” the Monkey King asked. “There's a heavenly general outside who says he's come on the orders of the Jade Emperor to subdue you. If you go out and surrender immediately, he says he'll spare our lives.” “Fetch me my armour,” said the Monkey King. He then donned his golden helmet, tied on his golden armour, put on his cloud-walking shoes, and took his As-You-Will gold-banded cudgel in his hand. He led his troops out of the cave and drew them up in battle array. The Mighty Miracle God gazed wide-eyed at the excellent Monkey King:"
却说那仙童骂彀多时，清风道：“明月，这些和尚也受得气哩，我们就象骂鸡一般，骂了这半会，通没个招声，想必他不曾偷吃。倘或树高叶密，数得不明，不要诳骂了他！我和你再去查查。”明月道：“也说得是。”他两个果又到园中，只见那树倒枒开，果无叶落，唬得清风脚软跌根头，明月腰酥打骸垢。那两个魂飞魄散，有诗为证，诗曰：三藏西临万寿山，悟空断送草还丹。枒开叶落仙根露，明月清风心胆寒。他两个倒在尘埃，语言颠倒，只叫：“怎的好！怎的好！害了我五庄观里的丹头，断绝我仙家的苗裔！师父来家，我两个怎的回话？”明月道：“师兄莫嚷，我们且整了衣冠，莫要惊张了这几个和尚。这个没有别人，定是那个毛脸雷公嘴的那厮，他来出神弄法，坏了我们的宝贝。若是与他分说，那厮毕竟抵赖，定要与他相争，争起来，就要交手相打，你想我们两个，怎么敌得过他四个？且不如去哄他一哄，只说果子不少，我们错数了，转与他陪个不是。他们的饭已熟了，等他吃饭时，再贴他些儿小菜。他一家拿着一个碗，你却站在门左，我却站在门右，扑的把门关倒，把锁锁住，将这几层门都锁了，不要放他，待师父来家，凭他怎的处置。他又是师父的故人，饶了他，也是师父的人情；不饶他，我们也拿住个贼在，庶几可以免我等之罪。”清风闻言道：“有理！有理！”,"However, he said that the fairy boy had been scolding for a long time, and Qingfeng said: ""Mingyue, these monks are also very angry. We are like scolding chickens. Ye Mi, the number is unknown, don't scold him! I'll go check with you again."" Mingyue said, ""That's right."" The two fruits went to the garden again, and they saw that the tree fell open, With no leaves falling, Qingfeng's feet fell softly, and Mingyue's waist was smashed with dirt. The two souls are scattered, and there is a poem as proof, the poem says: Sanzang is in the west of Longevity Mountain, and Wukong gave up the grass and returned to the elixir. The leaves open and the root dew falls, the bright moon and the breeze are chilling. The two of them fell into the dust, their language was reversed, and they only called: ""How good! How good! I killed the Dantou in Wuzhuang Temple, and cut off the seedlings of my fairy family! When the master comes home, how can I answer the two of you? Mingyue said: ""Senior brother, don't shout, let's straighten our clothes, don't startle these monks. This one has no one else, it must be the guy with the hairy face and Lei Gongzui. My precious treasure. If we talk to him, that guy will deny it after all, and we must fight with him. If we fight, we will fight each other. How can you think of the two of us, how can we beat the four of them? Why don't you coax him? Coax, I just said that there are a lot of fruits. We counted them wrong, so let's go with him. Their rice is already cooked, and when he eats, we will post some dishes for him. His family has a bowl, but you are standing there. On the left side of the door, I stood on the right side of the door, slammed the door down, locked the lock, locked the doors on several floors, don't let him, wait for the master to come home, how can he deal with him. He is master's again The old man, forgiving him is also a favor of the master; if we don’t forgive him, we will also catch a thief, and the commoners can save us from the crime.” Qingfeng heard the words: “It’s reasonable! It’s reasonable!”","We now tell you about the two immortal lads, who ranted at the pilgrims for a long time. Clear Breeze said, “Bright Moon, these monks do take our reproach quite well. We have been upbraiding them as if they were chickens all this time, but not once have they even attempted to answer us. Could it be that they really did not steal the fruits? With the tree so tall and the leaves so dense, we could have made a mistake in our tallying, and we might have chided them unjustly. We should go and investigate further.” “You are right,” said Bright Moon, and the two of them accordingly went back to the garden. But what they saw was only a tree on the ground with broken boughs and fallen leaves, without so much as a single fruit on it. Clear Breeze was so aghast that his legs gave way and he fell to the ground; Bright Moon shook so violently that he could hardly stand up. Both of them were scared out of their wits! We have, as testimony, this poem: Tripitaka went westward to the Long Life Mount; Wukong cut down the grass of reverted cinnabar. Boughs broken and leaves fallen, the divine root exposed: Clear Breeze and Bright Moon were horrified! The two of them lay on the ground, hardly able to speak coherently. They could only blurt out, “What shall we do? What shall we do? The magic root of our Five Villages Abbey is severed! The seed of this divine house of ours is cut off! When our master returns, what shall we tell him?” Then Bright Moon said, “Elder Brother, stop hollering! Let’s pull ourselves together and not alarm those monks. There’s no one else here; it has to be that fellow with a hairy face and a thundergod beak who used magic unseen to ruin our treasure. If we try to talk to him, he will probably deny it, and further argument may well lead to actual combat. In the event of a fight, how do you suppose the two of us could stand up to the four of them? It would be better if we deceived them now by saying that the fruits were not missing, and that since we made a mistake in our counting, we were offering them our own apology. Their rice is almost cooked. When they eat, we shall even present them with a few side dishes. When each of them is holding a bowl, you stand on the left of the door and I’ll stand on the right, and we’ll slam the door shut together. We’ll lock it and all the other doors of this Abbey too, so that they will not be able to escape. We can then wait for Master to return and let him do with them what he wills. Since the Tang Monk is an old acquaintance of Master, he might decide to forgive them, and that would be his act of kindness. Should he decide not to, however, we have at least managed to catch the thieves, for which we ourselves might be forgiven.” When he heard these words, Clear Breeze said, “You are right! You are right!”",,"The clouds parted to reveal the silver-bearded dragon king, the beaked thunder god, the jade-faced Cloud-Boy, and the bouffant-eyebrowed Earl of Wind. After the deities had received the adulation of the crowds below for a couple of hours, Monkey dismissed them all back to Heaven: “Thanks for coming. I’ll make sure these mortals keep up the worship. In return, be certain to give them rain every ten days. Don’t forget—if you want those sacrifices!” The gods scattered and Monkey returned to earth. “Our work’s done here,” Monkey told Tripitaka. “Time to pack up and move on.” The people of the prefecture tried to shower the pilgrims with money and gifts—all of which were declined. A huge farewell party—with banners, streamers, and drums—gathered to send the pilgrims off; the locals followed them for about thirty miles before regretfully letting them go. After watching the pilgrims disappear into the horizon, they tearfully returned to their homes. “Well,” Tripitaka said to Monkey as they walked along, “this time you’ve really outdone yourself in compassion. What you did there was even more impressive than in Bhikku.” “At Bhikku,” Sandy chimed in, “you saved 1,111 little boys. But in Phoenix-Immortal, you saved hundreds and thousands of people from starvation. Hurrah for Monkey’s merciful magic!” “Oh, yes, good show, Monkey,” snarked Pigsy. “So how about showing my feet some mercy? You’re always treading on my toes. Or making sure I’m the one who gets tied up and scrubbed for the steamer so that you can play the hero. Or you could at least have let us stay in Phoenix-Immortal for a few months, so that I could get a square meal or two under my belt. I’m wasting away here. But no—Monkey had to hurry us out of there.” “Do you ever think about anything except your stomach?” snapped Tripitaka. “Get a move on, and don’t talk back!”","A long time later, when the two Taoist boys felt that they had railed at them for long enough, Pure Wind said to Bright Moon, “These monks will take anything we say. We've sworn at them as if we were swearing at chickens, but they haven't admitted anything. I don't think they can have stolen any, after all. The tree is so tall and the foliage is so dense that we may well have miscounted, and if we have, we shouldn't be cursing them so wildly. Let's go and check the number again.” Bright Moon agreed, and the pair of them went back to the garden. When they saw that the tree was down with its branches bent out, the leaves fallen, and the fruit gone, they were horror-struck. Pure Wind's knees turned soft and he collapsed, while Bright Moon trembled and shook. Both of them passed out, and there is a verse to describe them: When Sanzang came to the Mountain of Infinite Longevity, Monkey finished the Grass-returning Cinnabar. The branches were splayed out, the leaves fallen, and the tree down. Bright Moon and Pure Wind's hearts both turned to ice. The two of them lay in the dirt mumbling deliriously and saying, “What are we to do, what are we to do? The elixir of our Wuzhuang Temple has been destroyed and our community of Immortals is finished. Whatever are we going to say to the master when he comes back?” “Stop moaning, brother,” said Bright Moon. “We must tidy ourselves up and not let those monks know anything's wrong. That hairy-faced sod who looks like a thunder god must have done it. He must have used magic to destroy our treasure. But it's useless to argue with him as he'll deny everything, and if we start a quarrel with him and fighting breaks out, we two haven't a chance against the four of them. We'll have to fool them and say that no fruit is missing. We'll pretend we counted wrong before, and apologize to them. Their rice is cooked, and we can give them a few side dishes to eat with it. The moment they've each got a bowl of food you and I will stand on either side of the door, slam it shut, and lock it. After that we can lock all the gates, then they won't be able to get away. When our master comes back he can decide what to do with them. That old monk is a friend of his, so our master may want to forgive him as a favour. And if he doesn't feel forgiving, we've got the criminals under arrest and may possibly not get into trouble ourselves.” “Absolutely right,” said Pure Wind."
却说那唐朝驾下有徐茂功、秦叔宝、胡敬德、段志贤、马三宝、程咬金、高士廉、虞世南、房玄龄、杜如晦、萧瑀、傅奕、张道源、张士衡、王珪等两班文武，俱保着那东宫太子与皇后、嫔妃、宫娥、侍长，都在那白虎殿上举哀，一壁厢议传哀诏，要晓谕天下，欲扶太子登基。时有魏征在旁道：“列位且住，不可！不可！假若惊动州县，恐生不测。且再按候一日，我主必还魂也。”,"However, it was said that the Tang Dynasty had Xu Maogong, Qin Shubao, Hu Jingde, Duan Zhixian, Ma Sanbao, Cheng Yaojin, Gao Shilian, Yu Shinan, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xiao Yu, Fu Yi, Zhang Daoyuan, Zhang Shiheng, Wang Gui and other two classes of civil and martial arts. The prince of the East Palace, the queen, the concubines, the palace maids, and the waiters all raised their mourning on the White Tiger Hall, and a side room discussed the edict of mourning, to tell the world, and to help the prince ascend to the throne. Wei Zheng was at the side and said: ""Let's stay here, no! No! If the prefectures and counties are disturbed, I may be unpredictable. If you wait for another day, my lord will surely come back to life.""","We shall now tell you about those who served before the Throne in the Tang dynasty. Xu Mougong, Qin Shubao, Hu Jingde, Duan Zhixian, Ma Sanbao, Cheng Yaojin, Gao Shilian, Li Shiji, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xiao Yu, Fu Yi, Zhang Daoyuan, Zhang Shiheng, and Wang Guei constituted the two groups of civil and military officials. They gathered with the crown prince of the Eastern Palace, the queen, the ladies of the court, and the chief steward in the Hall of the White Tiger for the imperial mourning. At the same time, they discussed issuing the obituary proclamation for the whole empire and crowning the prince as emperor. From one side of the hall, Wei Zheng stepped forward and said, “All of you, please refrain from doing anything hasty. If you alarm the various districts and cities, you may bring about something undesirable and unexpected. Let’s wait here for another day, for our lord will surely come back to life.”","This he refused to do, but Sun gave him twenty blows with a heavy rod, and at last he carried the corpse to the temple. When the Master saw the corpse, with all the appearance of a live man, he wept to think of the usurper taking possession of the country. Zhu laughed at him, “Master, he does not belong to your family! Why should you be so distressed?” The Master replied, “The true Buddhist is always full of pity.","• In the palace at Chang’an, meanwhile, a crowd of officials and the palace women were gathered around the coffin of the emperor, discussing when to crown the prince emperor. “I wouldn’t do anything too hasty if I were you,” advised Wei Zheng. “News of the emperor’s death will destabilize the empire. And anyway, I’m sure His Majesty will return to life in a day or so.","The civil and military officials of the Tang court, Xu Maogong, Qin Shubao, Yuchi Jingde, Duan Zhixian, Ma Sanbao, Cheng Yaojin, Gao Shilian, Li Shiji, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xiao Yu, Fu Yi, Zhang Daoyuan, Zhang Shiheng, Wang Gui and the others, as well as the empresses, imperial consorts and concubines, and pages were all in the White Tiger Hall. They were discussing whether to issue an edict of mourning to inform the world so that the heir could be put on the throne. Wei Zheng was saying, “Gentlemen, stop this discussion. We must not do that. If the country is alarmed, anything might happen. If we wait for another day our master is bound to come back to life.”"
那童子出得门来，高叫道：“甚么人在此搔扰？”猴王扑的跳下树来，上前躬身道：“仙童，我是个访道学仙之弟子，更不敢在此搔扰。”仙童笑道：“你是个访道的么？”猴王道：“是。”童子道：“我家师父，正才下榻，登坛讲道。还未说出原由，就教我出来开门。说：‘外面有个修行的来了，可去接待接待。’想必就是你了？”猴王笑道：“是我，是我。”童子道：“你跟我进来。”,"The boy came out of the door and shouted, ""Who is bothering you here?"" The Monkey King jumped down from the tree, stepped forward and bowed: ""Xiantong, I am a disciple who visits Taoism and learns immortals, and I don't dare to I'm disturbing you here."" Xiantong smiled and said, ""Are you a visiting Taoist?"" The monkey king said, ""Yes."" The boy said, ""My master is just staying here and giving a sermon on the altar. Before he can tell the reason, he will teach him. I came out to open the door and said, 'There is a cultivator from outside, you can go to the reception.' It must be you?"" The Monkey King smiled and said, ""It's me, it's me."" The boy said, ""Come in with me.""","He feared no havoc by the seasons wrought. After coming through the door, the boy shouted, “Who is causing disturbance here?” With a bound the Monkey King leaped down from the tree, and went up to him bowing. “Immortal boy,” he said, “I am a seeker of the way of immortality. I would never dare cause any disturbance.” With a chuckle, the immortal youth asked, “Are you a seeker of the Way?” “I am indeed,” answered the Monkey King. “My master at the house,” the boy said, “has just left his couch to give a lecture on the platform. Before even announcing his theme, however, he told me to go out and open the door, saying, ‘There is someone outside who wants to practice austerities. You may go and receive him.’ It must be you, I suppose.” The Monkey King said, smiling, “It is I, most assuredly!” “Follow me in then,” said the boy.","Out of it came an Immortal Student who cried out, “Who is making a noise here?” The Monkey King dropped down from the tree, went up to him respectfully and said, “I am in search of Truth and Immortality, and therefore of all places I would not make a noise here.” The Immortal Student smiled “and said, “Are you a Seeker after Truth?” The king replied, “I am.” The Immortal Student said, “My teacher has just gone up and mounted the platform to preach, and without giving me the reason why, he told me to come and open the door as a Truth Seeker had come, and I was to welcome him. I suppose it is you.” The Monkey King smiled and said, “Yes, I am the one, I am the one.” The Immortal Student said, “Follow me inside.”","“I didn’t mean to disturb you. I’m here to learn the secret of eternal life.” “You seek the Way, you say?” The young man smiled. “Our master just told me to look outside the front door for a new student.” “That would be me!” exclaimed Monkey. “Come on, then,” the young man said, ushering him inside.","When this boy had come out he shouted, “Who's making that row out here?” The Monkey King scampered down the tree, went up to him, and said with a bow, “Immortal child, I am a disciple who has come to ask about the Way and study under the Immortal. The last thing I'd do would be to make a row here?” The boy laughed. “So you've come to ask about the Way, have you?” “Yes,” the Monkey King replied. “Our master has just got up,” the boy said, “and has now mounted the dais to expound the Way. Before he had started to explain about origins he told me to open the door. He said, 'There is someone outside who wants to cultivate his conduct. Go and welcome him.' I suppose he must have meant you.” “Yes, he meant me,” the Monkey King said with a smile. “Come with me,” the boy said."
次日，依旧排营。悟空会集群猴，计有四万七千馀口。早惊动满山怪兽，都是些狼、虫、虎、豹麂、獐、麂、狐、狸、獾、□【左“反犬”右“各”】、狮、象、狻猊、猩猩、熊、鹿、野豕、山牛、羚羊、青兕、狡儿、神獒……各样妖王，共有七十二洞，都来参拜猴王为尊。每年献贡，四时点卯。也有随班操备的，也有随节征粮的，齐齐整整，把一座花果山造得似铁桶金城，各路妖王，又有进金鼓，进彩旗，进盔甲的，纷纷攘攘，日逐家习舞兴师。,"The next day, still lined up. Wukong will swarm monkeys, with a total population of more than 47,000. Early alarmed the mountain monsters, all of which are wolves, insects, tigers, leopard muntjacs, deer, muntjacs, foxes, raccoons, badgers, □ [left ""anti-dog"" right ""each""], lions, elephants, scorpions, orangutans, Bears, deer, wild hogs, mountain cattle, antelopes, green scorpions, cunning children, god mastiffs... All kinds of demon kings, with a total of 72 caves, all come to pay homage to the monkey king. Contribution every year, four o'clock in the morning. There are also those who train with the squad, and some who collect grain at the festival. They are neatly built, and a mountain of flowers and fruits is built like a golden city of iron barrels. There are various demon kings, and some people who enter the golden drums, the colorful flags, and the armor are crowded. , Every day from home to learn dance and Xingshi.","The following day, they marched in formation as usual. Assembling the monkeys, Wukong found that there were forty-seven thousand of them. This assembly greatly impressed all the wild beasts of the mountain—wolves, insects, tigers, leopards, mouse deer, fallow deer, river deer, foxes, wild cats, badgers, lions, elephants, apes, bears, antelopes, boars, muskoxen, chamois, green one-horn buffaloes, wild hares, and giant mastiffs. Led by the various demon kings of no fewer than seventy-two caves, they all came to pay homage to the Monkey King. Henceforth they brought annual tributes and answered the roll call made every season. Some of them joined in the maneuvers; others supplied provisions in accordance with their rank. In an orderly fashion, they made the entire Flower-Fruit Mountain as strong as an iron bucket or a city of metal. The various demon kings also presented metal drums, colored banners, and helmets. The hurly-burly of marching and drilling went on day after day.","Next day they were called to drill as usual, and their king numbered them and found them to be over 47,000. This frightened all the beasts of the mountain. The elf chiefs of the 72 caves on the mountain came to do homage to the Monkey King, and brought their yearly tribute. They were drilled every season, and all paid their taxes regularly, till the Mountain Garden became an iron city, where they drilled daily for military purposes.","The next day, after their usual marching drill, Monkey summoned them together and made a roll call of forty-seven thousand monkey soldiers. The size of this army awed the mountain’s many wild beasts: its wolves, snakes, tigers, leopards, mouse-deer, roe deer, river deer, foxes, badgers, lions, elephants, bears, antelope, wild boar, mountain oxen, gazelles, and green rhinoceroses. Every demon king from the mountain’s seventy-two caves came to pay homage to the monkey king. Each year they presented tribute—golden drums, colorful flags, helmets—and answered Monkey’s summons. Some provided military service; others supplies. Together, they turned Flower-Fruit Mountain into a fortress of formidable military discipline. One day, though, Monkey had a thought. “While you are all very quick now with all kinds of weapons, I’m finding this cutlass of mine very cumbersome.”","The next day they paraded as usual. Sun Wukong assembled all the monkey host, and they numbered over forty-seven thousand. This had alarmed all the strange beasts of the mountain—wolves, monsters, tigers, leopards, deer, muntjacs, river-deer, foxes, wild cats, badgers, raccoons, lions, elephants, horses, orangutans, bears, stags, wild boar, mountain cattle, antelopes, rhinoceroses, little dogs, huge dogs. The kings of various kinds of monsters, seventy-two in all, all came to pay homage to the Monkey King. They offered tribute every year and attended court in each of the four seasons. They also took part in drill and paid their seasonal grain levies. Everything was so orderly that the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit was as secure as an iron bucket or a wall of bronze. The kings of the monsters sent gongs, drums, coloured flags, helmets, and armour in great abundance, and every day there were military exercises."
“这取经的勾当，原是观音菩萨；及脱解我等，也是观音菩萨。,"""The act of taking the scriptures was originally Guanyin Bodhisattva;","Pilgrim said, “This business of seeking scriptures originated from the Bodhisattva Guanyin; the one who delivered us from our ordeals was also the Bodhisattva Guanyin.",,Time flew like an arrow; the seasons passed back and forth like a weaver’s shuttle.,"“This whole business of fetching the scriptures was started by the Bodhisattva Guanyin, and it was she who converted us."
冤有冤家，债有债主。要索命不干我们事，都是广谋与老和尚定计害你的，莫问我们讨命。”行者咄的一声道：“我把你这些该死的畜生！那个问你讨甚么命！只拿袈裟来还我走路！”其间有两个胆量大的和尚道：“老爷，你们在禅堂里已烧死了，如今又来讨袈裟，端的还是人是鬼？”行者笑道：“这伙孽畜！那里有甚么火来？你去前面看看禅堂，再来说话！”众僧们爬起来往前观看，那禅堂外面的门窗槅扇，更不曾燎灼了半分。众人悚惧，才认得三藏是位神僧，行者是尊护法，一齐上前叩头道：,"Injustice has enemies, and debts have creditors. If you ask for your life if you don't do our work, it's all about the plan and the old monk who plan to kill you, don't ask us to ask for your life. ""The walker said in a loud voice: ""I'll take you damned beasts!"" What are you asking for your life! Just take the cassock and pay me back for walking! In the meantime, two daring monks said: ""Master, you have been burned to death in the meditation hall, and now you have come to ask for cassocks, are you still a ghost?"" ""Walker laughed:"" This group of evil beasts! What's on fire there? You go to the front to see the meditation hall, and then talk! All the monks got up and looked forward. The doors, windows and fans outside the meditation hall were not even half burned. Everyone was terrified, and then they recognized that Sanzang was a monk, and the practitioner was the guardian of the Dharma. They all stepped forward and kowtowed:","Just as a wrong implies an enemy, so a debt has its proper creditor! If you seek vengeance, please understand that we had nothing to do with this. It was the old monk who plotted with Big Plan against you. Don’t make us pay for your lives!” “You damnable beasts!” cried Pilgrim angrily. “Who wants you to pay with your lives? Just give me back the cassock and we’ll be going.” Two of the monks who were less timid said to him, “Father, you were supposed to be burned to death in the Chan hall, and yet now you come to demand the cassock. Are you indeed a man, or are you a ghost?” “This bunch of accursed creatures!” said Pilgrim, laughing. “Where was the fire? Go to the front and look at the Chan hall. Then you can come back and talk.” The monks got up and went to the front to look; not even half an inch of the door, the window, or the screen outside the Chan hall was scorched. One and all were awestruck and became convinced that Tripitaka was a divine monk, and Pilgrim a celestial guardian. They all went forward to kowtow to them, saying, “We have eyes but no pupils, and therefore we did not recognize True Men descending to Earth.",,"“He’ll have gotten over all that,” the horse reasoned. “Don’t tell him that Tripitaka’s in danger—just that Master’s missing him. When we’ve lured him back with flattery and he sees what’s going on, he’ll want to save the day. Go! Go now!” Still nursing a sinking feeling, Pigsy cloud-traveled east. Luck was on his side: the winds were favorable, and Pigsy simply stuck out his enormous ears and sped across the ocean. Landing on Flower-Fruit at sunrise, he heard a voice in a nearby valley. Approaching, he saw that it was Monkey addressing a host of twelve hundred monkeys, all of whom were busy kowtowing. Impressed but also nervous about encountering Monkey again, Pigsy tried to go undercover by creeping into the kowtowing throng. Monkey spotted the intruder instantly and ordered his swarm of monkeys to drag him up to the front. “Who are you? Where’s your name card?” The embarrassed Pigsy now looked Monkey full in the face.","The monks all fell to their knees and kowtowed, saying, “Masters, wrongs are always avenged, and debts always have to be paid. If you want lives, it's nothing to do with us; It was the old monk and Broad Plans who cooked up the plot to kill you. Please don't punish us.” Monkey snorted with anger and roared, “I'll get you, you damned animals. Who asked for anyone's life? Just bring out that cassock and we'll be on our way.” Two brave men from among the monks said, “Masters, you were burnt to death in the meditation hall, and now you come back to ask for the cassock. Are you men or ghosts?” “You cattle,” sneered Monkey, “there wasn't any fire. Go and look at the meditation hall and then we'll see what you have to say.” The monks rose to their feet, and when they went forward to look, they saw that there was not even the slightest trace of scorching on the door and the window-frames. The monks, now struck with fear, realized that Sanzang was a divine priest, and Monkey a guardian god. They all kowtowed to the pair of them and said, “Our eyes are blind."
那妇人道：“我是丁亥年三月初三日酉时生。故夫比我年大三岁，我今年四十五岁。大女儿名真真，今年二十岁；次女名爱爱，今年十八岁；三小女名怜怜，今年十六岁，俱不曾许配人家。虽是小妇人丑陋，却幸小女俱有几分颜色，女工针指，无所不会。因是先夫无子，即把他们当儿子看养，小时也曾教他读些儒书，也都晓得些吟诗作对。虽然居住山庄，也不是那十分粗俗之类，料想也配得过列位长老，若肯放开怀抱，长发留头，与舍下做个家长，穿绫着锦，胜强如那瓦钵缁衣，雪鞋云笠！”,"The woman said: ""I was born on the third day of the third month of the third month of the Ding Hai year. So my husband is three years older than me, and I am forty-five years old. The eldest daughter's name is Zhenzhen, and she is twenty years old this year; the second daughter's name is Ai'ai, ten years old this year. Eight years old; three little girls named Lianlian, 16 years old this year, all of them have never been married. Although the little women are ugly, but fortunately the little girls have a bit of color, and the female workers can know everything. Because her husband has no children , even if they were raised as sons, I taught him to read some Confucian books when he was young, and he knew how to recite poetry. Although he lived in a villa, he was not that vulgar, and he was expected to be worthy of the elders. Let go of your arms, keep your long hair and head, and be a parent with the house, wear silk and brocade, and be as strong as Nawa bowls and robes, and snow shoes and cloud hats!""","The woman said, “I was born in the hour of the Cock, on the third day of the third month, in the year Dinghai. As my deceased husband was three years my senior, I am now forty-five years old. My eldest daughter, named Zhenzhen, is twenty; my second daughter, Aiai, is eighteen; and my youngest daughter, Lianlian, is sixteen.2 None of them has been betrothed to anyone. Though I am rather homely, my daughters fortunately are rather good-looking. Moreover, each of them is well trained in needlework and the feminine arts. And because we had no son, my late husband brought them up as if they were boys, teaching them some of the Confucian classics when they were young as well as the art of writing verse and couplets. So, although they reside in a mountain home, they are not vulgar or uncouth persons; they would make suitable matches, I dare say, for all of you. If you elders can put away your inhibitions and let your hair grow again, you can at once become masters of this household. Are not the silk and brocade that you will wear infinitely better than the porcelain almsbowl and black robes, the straw sandals and grass hats?”",,"“How are we going to put this fire out so we can carry on to the west?” “You’re the one who set this fire burning, you know,” the spirit pointed out. “Poppycock! When did I go around starting fires?” “Let me explain,” replied the spirit. “This mountain did not exist until five hundred years ago, when you made all that trouble in Heaven and Laozi had to smelt you inside his Brazier of Eight Trigrams. When he opened it, you kicked over the brazier, dislodging a few burning bricks that fell onto this very spot and became Flame Mountain. I was the shift worker attending the brazier, and on grounds of professional negligence, Laozi banished me here, where I became the local spirit.","“I was born at the hour you of the third day of the third month of the year dinghai, ”she continued. “My late husband was three years older than me, and I am now forty-four. My eldest daughter, Zhenzhen, is nineteen; my second, Aiai is seventeen; and Lianlian, the youngest, is fifteen. None of them have been betrothed. Although I am rather ugly myself, the girls are all quite good-looking, and they have all the feminine accomplishments. As my late husband had no sons, he gave them a boy's education, teaching them to read the Confucian classics from an early age and training them to recite poems and make couplets. Although they live in this mountain farmhouse you couldn't consider them boorish, and I think that they would be good partners for all you reverend gentlemen. If you are willing to broaden your outlook and let your hair grow, you could be head of the family and wear silks and brocades. Wouldn't that be far better than your earthenware begging-bowl, rough clothes, straw sandals, and rain-hats?”"
只见那班部中，忽跳出一个通背猿猴，厉声高叫道：“大王若是这般远虑，真所谓道心开发也！如今五虫之内，惟有三等名色，不伏阎王老子所管。”猴王道：“你知那三等人？”猿猴道：“乃是佛与仙与神圣三者，躲过轮回，不生不灭，与天地山川齐寿。”猴王道：“此三者居于何所？”猿猴道：“他只在阎浮世界之中，古洞仙山之内。”猴王闻之，满心欢喜，道：“我明日就辞汝等下山，云游海角，远涉天涯，务必访此三者，学一个不老长生，常躲过阎君之难。”噫！这句话，顿教跳出轮回网，致使齐天大圣成。众猴鼓掌称扬，都道：“善哉！善哉！我等明日越岭登山，广寻些果品，大设筵宴送大王也。”,"I saw a monkey with an open back suddenly jumped out of that group, and shouted in a loud voice: ""If Your Majesty is so far-sighted, it is really called the development of Taoism! Today, among the five insects, there are only third-class names and forms, which are not under the control of Laozi, the king of hell. ""The Monkey King said, ""Do you know those three classes?"" The Monkey King said: ""It is the Buddha, the Immortal and the Holy, who escape from reincarnation, are neither born nor perish, and live with the heaven, the earth, the mountains and rivers."" The Monkey King said: ""These three Where does he live?"" The monkey said, ""He is only in the world of Jambu, in the ancient cave and fairy mountain."" The Monkey King heard this, and was full of joy, and said, ""Tomorrow I will leave you to go down the mountain, travel around the sea, and travel far and wide. Visit these three, learn an immortal immortal, and often avoid the difficulties of Yan Jun."" Hey! With these words, Dunjia jumped out of the reincarnation net, resulting in the achievement of the Monkey King. All the monkeys applauded and praised, all said: ""Good job! Good job! I'll wait for tomorrow to climb the mountain, look for some fruits, and set up a feast for the king.""","From among the ranks a bareback monkey suddenly leaped forth and cried aloud, “ If the Great King is so farsighted, it may well indicate the sprouting of his religious inclination. There are, among the five major divisions of all living creatures,13 only three species that are not subject to Yama, King of the Underworld.” The Monkey King said, “Do you know who they are?” The monkey said, “They are the Buddhas, the immortals, and the holy sages; these three alone can avoid the Wheel of Transmigration as well as the process of birth and destruction, and live as long as Heaven and Earth, the mountains and the streams.” “Where do they live?” asked the Monkey King. The monkey said, “They do not live beyond the world of the Jambūdvīpa, for they dwell within ancient caves on immortal mountains.” When the Monkey King heard this, he was filled with delight, saying, “Tomorrow I shall take leave of you all and go down the mountain. Even if I have to wander with the clouds to the corners of the sea or journey to the distant edges of Heaven, I intend to find these three kinds of people. I will learn from them how to be young forever and escape the calamity inflicted by King Yama.” Lo, this utterance at once led him To leap free of the Transmigration Net, And be the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven. All the monkeys clapped their hands in acclamation, saying, “Wonderful! Wonderful! Tomorrow we shall scour the mountain ranges to gather plenty of fruits, so that we may send the Great King off with a great banquet.”","At this there jumped from among them a strong one, and cried out with a loud voice, “Oh King, this sorrow of yours is an opportunity to gain Life Eternal. Of all the wonders of the world, three are greatest: the Buddhas, the Taoist Immortals, and the Confucian Sages. These have reached beyond transmigration and will never be reborn to die again, but will endure as long as Heaven and Earth. The king asked, “Where do they live?” The Monkey said, “In the world after death, in the ancient depths of the Eternal Mountain.” On hearing this the king was much pleased and said, “Tomorrow I leave you and go down the mountain and take a flight to a corner of the sea far on the horizon, and find out these three wonders, so that I may never get old, but live for ever and escape the hand of death. This is a happy thought. It is the sudden conversion spoken of in the Buddhist religion, whereby a man can escape the net of reincarnation by transmigration, and become a great saint as lasting as Heaven itself.” At this all the monkeys rejoiced and clapped their hands, saying, “Good, very good! Tomorrow we also go across the mountain in search of fresh fruit to provide a big banquet for our great king.”","While the monkey masses—instantly fearful—buried their faces in their hands and mewled piteously, a long-armed ape jumped out of the crowd: “Our great king’s new sense of mortality suggests the beginnings of a religious calling. Only three types of creature can escape King Yama and his wheel of life and death: Buddhas, immortals, and holy sages.” “Where are they to be found?” asked the monkey king. “In ancient caves on divine mountains.” “I leave immediately,” declared the monkey king. “Even if my quest takes me to the very end of the world, I will return with the secret of eternal life.” All the monkeys applauded wildly. “Marvelous! First, though, we will gather fruits from far away for a huge send-off feast.”","Suddenly a gibbon jumped out from their ranks and shrieked in a piercing voice, “If Your Majesty is thinking so far ahead, this is the beginning of enlightenment. Now of the Five Creatures, there are only three that do not come under the jurisdiction of the King of Hell.” “Do you know which they are?” asked the Monkey King. “Yes,” the ape replied. “They are the Buddhas, the Immortals and the Sages. They are free from the Wheel of Reincarnation. They are not born and they do not die. They are as eternal as Heaven and Earth, as the mountains and the rivers.” “Where do they live?” the Monkey King asked. “Only in the human world,” the ape replied, “in ancient caves on magic mountains.” The Monkey King was delighted to hear this. “I shall leave you all tomorrow,” he said, “and go down the mountain. If I have to, I'll roam the corners of the oceans and go to the edge of the sky to find these three kinds of beings and discover the secret of eternal youth that will keep us out of the clutches of the King of Hell for ever.” Goodness! Because of these words he was to learn how to be free from the Wheel of Reincarnation and become the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. All the monkeys clapped with approval and said, “Great! Great! Tomorrow we'll climb all over the mountain and get lots of fruit to give Your Majesty a really big banquet to send you off.”"
那妇人见了他三众，更加欣喜，以礼邀入厅房，一一相见礼毕，请各叙坐看茶。那屏风后，忽有一个丫髻垂丝的女童，托着黄金盘、白玉盏，香茶喷暖气，异果散幽香。那人绰彩袖，春笋纤长；擎玉盏，传茶上奉。对他们一一拜了。茶毕，又吩咐办斋。三藏启手道：“老菩萨，高姓？贵地是甚地名？”妇人道：“此间乃西牛贺洲之地。小妇人娘家姓贾，夫家姓莫。幼年不幸，公姑早亡，与丈夫守承祖业，有家资万贯，良田千顷。夫妻们命里无子，止生了三个女孩儿，前年大不幸，又丧了丈夫，小妇居孀，今岁服满。空遗下田产家业，再无个眷族亲人，只是我娘女们承领。欲嫁他人，又难舍家业。适承长老下降，想是师徒四众。小妇娘女四人，意欲坐山招夫，四位恰好，不知尊意肯否如何。”三藏闻言，推聋妆哑，瞑目宁心，寂然不答。那妇人道：“舍下有水田三百余顷，旱田三百余顷，山场果木三百余顷；黄水牛有一千余只，况骡马成群，猪羊无数。东南西北，庄堡草场，共有六七十处。家下有八九年用不着的米谷，十来年穿不着的绫罗；一生有使不着的金银，胜强似那锦帐藏春，说甚么金钗两行。你师徒们若肯回心转意，招赘在寒家，自自在在，享用荣华，却不强如往西劳碌？”那三藏也只是如痴如蠢，默默无言。,"The woman was even more delighted when she saw the three of them, and invited them into the hall with a courtesy invitation. Behind the screen, suddenly there was a girl with a bun hanging silk, holding a golden plate, a white jade cup, fragrant tea, and the fragrance of different fruits. The man had colorful sleeves and slender bamboo shoots; he held a jade cup and served tea. I bowed to them one by one. After the tea was over, he ordered the fasting. Sanzang raised his hand and said: ""Old Bodhisattva, Gao surname? What is the name of your land?"" The woman said, ""This place is the land of Xiniu Hezhou. The little woman's maiden name is Jia, her husband's surname is Mo. Unfortunate in her childhood, her father-in-law and aunt died early. Keeping the ancestral business with her husband, they have a wealth of wealth and a thousand hectares of fertile land. The husband and wife have no children, and only three girls were born. I have left the fields and family business, and there is no family or relatives, but my mother and daughter took it. I want to marry others, but it is difficult to give up the family business. It is suitable for the elders to descend. Sitting on the mountain to recruit husbands, the four are just right, I don’t know how respectful you will be.” Sanzang heard the words, pushed the deaf makeup and dumbfounded, rested his eyes and calmed his heart, and did not answer. The woman said: ""There are more than 300 hectares of paddy fields, more than 300 hectares of dry fields, and more than 300 hectares of fruit trees in the mountain farms; there are more than 1,000 yellow buffaloes, mules and horses, and countless pigs and sheep. There are 60 or 70 places in total. There are rice grains that will not be used in 1989, Lingluo that will not be worn in ten years, and gold and silver that cannot be used in life. Shengqiang is like a brocade tent hiding spring, what do you mean by gold and hairpins. Your teacher If the disciples are willing to change their minds, be recruited to the Han family, be at ease, and enjoy the glory, but it is not as good as going west to work?"" The Sanzang was also just dumbfounded and silent.","When the woman saw the three of them, she became even more amiable and invited them with great politeness into the main hall. After they had exchanged greetings one after the other, the pilgrims were told to be seated for tea to be served. From behind the screen a young maid with two tufts of flowing locks appeared, holding a golden tray with several white-jade cups. There were Fragrant tea wafting warm air, Strange fruits spreading fine aroma. That lady rolled up her colorful sleeves and revealed long, delicate fingers like the stalks of spring onions; holding high the jade cups, she passed the tea to each one of them, bowing as she made the presentation. After the tea, she gave instructions for vegetarian food to be prepared. “Old Bodhisattva,” said Tripitaka bowing, “what is your noble surname? And what is the name of your esteemed region?” The woman said, “This belongs to the West Aparagodānīya Continent. My maiden surname is Jia (Unreal), and the surname of my husband’s family is Mo (Nonexisting). Unfortunately, my in-laws died prematurely, and my husband and I inherited our ancestral fortune, which amounted to more than ten thousand taels of silver and over fifteen thousand acres of prime land. It was fated, however, that we should have no son, having given birth only to three daughters. The year before last, it was my great misfortune to lose my husband also, and I was left a widow. This year my mourning period is completed, but we have no other relatives beside mother and daughters to inherit our vast property and land. I would have liked to marry again, but I find it difficult to give up such wealth. We are delighted, therefore, that the four of you have arrived, for we four, mother and daughters, would like very much to ask you to become our spouses. I do not know what you will think of this proposal.” When Tripitaka heard these words, he turned deaf and dumb; shutting his eyes to quiet his mind, he fell silent and gave no reply. The woman said, “We own over three hundred acres of paddies, over four hundred and sixty acres of dried fields, and over four hundred and sixty acres of orchards and forests. We have over a thousand head of yellow water buffalo, herds of mules and horses, countless pigs and sheep. In all four quarters, there are over seventy barns and haystacks. In this household there is grain enough to feed you for more than eight or nine years, silk that you could not wear out in a decade, gold and silver that you might spend for a lifetime. What could be more delightful than our silk sheets and curtains, which can render spring eternal? Not to mention those who wear golden hairpins standing in rows! If all of you, master and disciples, are willing to change your minds and enter the family of your wives, you will be most comfortable, having all these riches to enjoy. Will that not be better than the toil of the journey to the West?” Like a mute and stupid person, Tripitaka refused to utter a word.",,"When the rain has cooled the ground, we can cross the mountain.” He fanned it once, but the flames raged even more fiercely. He fanned it a second time, and the blaze intensified a hundredfold. He waved it a third time, and the flames shot up as high as the eye could see. Although Monkey fled as fast as he could, the hair on his thighs was still singed to oblivion. “Run away!” he cried. The party of pilgrims fled some twenty miles eastward before Monkey started to rage at what had happened. “How did she trick me? If I’d run any slower, I’d have lost all my fur.” While Tripitaka wept inconsolably, Pigsy amused himself by provoking Monkey. “Aren’t you supposed to be immune to flames?” “Idiot!” Monkey lashed back. “Because I wasn’t expecting the fire, I didn’t have time to do the fire-repellent spell.” “Have a bite to eat, Monkey.” A voice suddenly broke into their argument. “You’ll feel better.” Turning, the four of them saw an old man, caped and capped and leaning on a cane with a dragon’s head. Following him was a demon with the beak of a hawk and the cheeks of a fish, carrying on his head a copper pot containing steamed cakes and yellow millet. “Allow me to introduce myself,” the old man said, bowing. “I am the spirit of Flame Mountain. I thought you could use some refreshments.” “Do you think we’re interested in food at a time like this?” barked Monkey.","When she saw the three others she was more pleased than ever, and she invited them into the main room. When all the introductions had been made, she asked them to sit down and have some tea. A servant girl with her hair in plaits came in through the door leading to the back of the house; she was carrying a golden tray on which were set white jade cups of steaming hot tea as well as exotic fruits that smelt delicious. Her sleeves were wide, and with her fingers as slender as bamboo shoots in spring she handed each of them a jade bowl and bowed. When the tea had been drunk, the mistress ordered a meatless meal to be prepared. “What is your name, venerable Bodhisattva?” asked Sanzang, spreading out his hands. “And what is this place called?” “This is the Western Continent of Cattle-gift, or Godaniya,” she replied. “My maiden name is Jia and my husband's name was Mo. In my childhood I had the misfortune of losing both my parents, and I married to continue the ancestral enterprise. Our family is worth ten thousand strings of cash, and we own fifteen thousand acres of good arable land. We were not fated to be given sons, and we only had three daughters. The year before last I suffered the great misfortune of losing my husband. I have remained a widow, and this year I have come out of mourning. There are no other relations to inherit the family estate besides myself and my daughters. I would like to remarry, but not at the price of abandoning the estate. Now that you have come here, venerable sir, with your three disciples, I think it should be you. I and my three daughters want to marry while staying at home, and you four gentlemen would suit us nicely. I wonder if you would be prepared to consent.” Sanzang sat there pretending to be deaf and dumb, with his eyes shut and his mind kept calm. He made no reply. “We have over four thousand acres each of irrigated land, dry land, and orchards on hillsides,” she continued, “as well as over a thousand head of oxen and water buffalo, herds of mules and horses, and more pigs and sheep than you could count. There are sixty or seventy farm buildings and barns. We have more grain in the house than we could eat in eight or nine years, and more than enough silk to clothe us for a decade—to say nothing of more gold and silver than you could spend in a lifetime. You'll be even better off than those ancients who 'stored spring behind brocade curtains' and kept girls whose 'hair was heavy with golden pins'. If you and your disciples are prepared to change your minds and live in this house as our husbands, you can enjoy wealth and ease. Wouldn't that be better than a difficult journey to the West?” Sanzang sat there silent, as if he were an imbecile."
棒架长枪声响亮，枪迎铁棒放光辉。悟空变化人间少，妖怪神通世上稀。这个要把佛衣来庆寿，那个不得袈裟肯善归？这番苦战难分手，就是活佛临凡也解不得围。他两个从洞口打上山头，自山头杀在云外，吐雾喷风，飞砂走石，只斗到红日沉西，不分胜败。那怪道：“姓孙的，你且住了手。今日天晚，不好相持。你去，你去！待明早来，与你定个死活。”行者叫道：“儿子莫走！要战便象个战的，不可以天晚相推。”看他没头没脸的，只情使棍子打来，这黑汉又化阵清风，转回本洞，紧闭石门不出。,"The sound of the long guns from the stick racks was loud, and the guns were shining brightly against the iron rods. There are few changes in the world of Wukong, and the magical powers of monsters are rare in the world. This one wants to celebrate the birthday with a Buddhist robe, and that one is willing to return with good deeds without a cassock? After this hard battle, it was difficult to break up, even if the living Buddha came to the world, he could not solve the siege. The two of them hit the top of the mountain from the entrance of the cave, and from the top of the mountain, they were killed outside the clouds, spitting mist, blowing wind, flying sand and moving stones. The strange said: ""The surnamed Sun, you stop. It's not easy to hold on to the stalemate tonight. You go, you go! Come tomorrow morning, and you will have a life and death."" The walker shouted: ""Son, don't leave! It's like a war, and you can't push each other every night."" Seeing that he was faceless, he just wanted to hit him with a stick, and the black man turned into a breeze, turned back to the cave, and closed the stone door.","The rod checked the lance, their noise resounding; The lance met the rod, causing sparks to fly. The changes of Wukong, all unknown to men; The monster’s magic skills, so rare on earth. This one wanted for his birthday fete a Buddha robe. Would that one with no cassock go home in peace? The bitter fight this time seemed without end. Even a live Buddha descending could not break them up! From the entrance of the cave the two of them fought up to the peak of the mountain, and from the peak of the mountain they fought their way up to the clouds. Belching wind and fog, kicking up sand and rocks, they fought until the red sun sank toward the west, but neither of them could gain the upper hand. The monster said, “Hey, Sun! Stop for a moment! It’s getting too late to fight any more. Go away! Come back tomorrow morning, and we’ll decide your fate.” “Don’t run away, my son,” cried Pilgrim. “If you want to fight, act like a fighter! Don’t give me the excuse that it’s getting late.” With his rod, he rained blows indiscriminately on his opponent’s head and face, but the swarthy fellow changed once more into a clear breeze and went back to his cave. Tightly bolting his stone doors, he refused to come out.",,"“He’s still one of the pilgrims. Let’s soak him in the pool at the back of the cave, peel off his hide and bristles, then salt and sun-dry him. He’ll slip down nicely with a cup of wine on a rainy day.” The goblins tossed Pigsy into the pool and left him to pickle. Back on the mountainside, the other pilgrims had gotten tired of waiting for Pigsy to return and so set off after him. Silver Horn now returned to the hunt and spied on the pilgrims’ progress from a mountaintop, devising a cunning plan to get Tripitaka away from the ever-victorious Monkey. He transformed himself into an elderly Taoist—white hair, yellow shoes, silk-sashed gown—with a broken, bleeding leg and hid in the bushes ahead of the pilgrims. “Save me, oh, save me!” he cried, crawling out of the roadside vegetation as they approached. “Where are you from, sir?” Tripitaka asked. “And what has happened to your leg?” “I am a priest in a temple to the west of this mountain,” explained the “Taoist.”","The club blocked the lengthy halberd with resounding clangs; The halberd gleamed as it parried the iron club. Sun Wukong's transformations were rare on earth; Few could rival the foul fiend's magic. One wanted to take the robe to bring himself long life; One had to have the cassock to return with honour. This bitter struggle was not to be broken up; Even a Living Buddha could not have resolved it. From the mouth of the cave the pair of them fought to the top of the mountain, and from the top of the mountain they battled their way beyond the clouds. They breathed out wind and mist, set sand and stones flying, and struggled till the red sun set in the West, but the contest was still undecided. Then the monster said, “Stop for the moment, Monkey. It's too late to go on fighting tonight. Go away, go away. Come back tomorrow, and we'll see which of us is to live and which to die.” “Don't go, my child,” Monkey shouted back. “If you want to fight, fight properly. Don't use the time of day as an excuse to get out of it.” With that he struck wildly at the dark fellow, who changed himself into a puff of wind, went back to his cave, and fastened the stone gates tightly shut."

If you are afraid of disasters, you must pass them on; Wukong kowtowed: ""I only hope that Master will forgive my sins!"" The Patriarch said: ""I don't blame you either, but just you go."" Wukong heard this, his eyes filled with tears and said, ""Where did Master teach me to go?"" The patriarch said: ""Where you came from, go there."" Wukong suddenly woke up and said, ""I came from the Huaguoshan Water Curtain Cave in the Aolai Kingdom of Dongsheng Shenzhou."" The patriarch said: ""Go back quickly, all the If your life is here, it is absolutely impossible!"" Wukong accepted the guilt, ""Respected Master, I have been away from home for 20 years. Although I look back on the old children and grandchildren, I don't dare to go to the ancestors without repaying the kindness of Master."" Said: ""What kind of grace is there? You just don't cause trouble and don't lead me!""","With not the least likeness to the impish monkey, It’s all frost-tried and snow-tested branches. When the multitude saw this, they clapped their hands and roared with laughter, everyone crying, “Marvelous monkey! Marvelous monkey!” They did not realize that all this uproar had disturbed the Patriarch, who came running out of the door, dragging his staff. “Who is creating this bedlam here?” he demanded. At his voice the pupils immediately collected themselves, set their clothes in order, and came forward. Wukong also changed back into his true form, and, slipping into the crowd, he said, “For your information, Reverend Master, we are having fellowship and discussion here. There is no one from outside causing any disturbance.” “You were all yelling and screaming,” said the Patriarch angrily, “and were behaving in a manner totally unbecoming to those practicing cultivation. Don’t you know that those in the cultivation of Dao resist Opening their mouths lest they waste their breath and spirit, Or moving their tongues lest they provoke arguments? Why are you all laughing noisily here?” “We dare not conceal this from the master,” the crowd said. “Just now we were having fun with Wukong, who was giving us a performance of transformation. We told him to change into a pine tree, and he did indeed become a pine tree! Your pupils were all applauding him and our voices disturbed the reverend teacher. We beg his forgiveness.” “Go away, all of you,” the Patriarch said. “You, Wukong, come over here! I ask you what sort of exhibition were you putting on, changing into a pine tree? This ability you now possess, is it just for showing off to people? Suppose you saw someone with this ability. Wouldn’t you ask him at once how he acquired it? So when others see that you are in possession of it, they’ll come begging. If you’re afraid to refuse them, you will give away the secret; if you don’t, they may hurt you. You are actually placing your life in grave jeopardy.” “I beseech the master to forgive me,” Wukong said, kowtowing. “I won’t condemn you,” said the Patriarch, “but you must leave this place.” When Wukong heard this, tears fell from his eyes. “Where am I to go, Teacher?” he asked. “From wherever you came,” the Patriarch said, “you should go back there.” “I came from the East Pūrvavideha Continent,” Wukong said, his memory jolted by the Patriarch, “from the Water-Curtain Cave of the Flower-Fruit Mountain in the Aolai Country.” “Go back there quickly and save your life,” the Patriarch said. “You cannot possibly remain here!” “Allow me to inform my esteemed teacher,” said Wukong, properly penitent, “I have been away from home for twenty years, and I certainly long to see my subjects and followers of bygone days again. But I keep thinking that my master’s profound kindness to me has not yet been repaid. I, therefore, dare not leave.” “There’s nothing to be repaid,” said the Patriarch. “See that you don’t get into trouble and involve me: that’s all I ask.”","Showing monkey traces none, Only hoarfrost on each branch. At the sight the students clapped their hands and cried in great admiration. The Master hearing the commotion, came out and asked what the matter was. When he heard he said, “You pledged yourself not to divulge the secret, and now you play with great things before the unworthy. If you do not divulge the secret to the others, they will kill you.” The Seeker of Secrets wept and begged his pardon. But the Master said, “I cannot keep you any longer, you must go, for your life is in danger.” The Seeker of Secrets said, “What shall I do?” “Go back whence you came,” was the stern reply, “and never tell anyone that you are my disciple, or I will flay you alive.”","Monkey made the magic sign, recited the spell, and became a pine tree: tall, straight, and elegant, without the slightest simian semblance. The disciples laughed and clapped. “Marvelous monkey!” The hullabaloo roused Subodhi, who hurried out with his staff. “Who’s making all this racket?” The disciples immediately hushed themselves while Monkey resumed his original form. “We were just chatting, Master.” “You should be ashamed of yourselves!” roared Subodhi. “Those seeking the Way should not open their mouths so freely, for fear of scattering their vital forces or causing arguments through loose talk. What were you shouting and laughing about, anyway?” “Monkey was entertaining us with a transformation,” the disciples confessed. “We asked him to turn into a pine tree and our cheering disturbed you, Master. Please forgive us.” “Go away, all of you. Except you, Sun Wukong: come here!” Once the others had scattered, a proper scolding began. “What do you think you’re doing, turning into a pine tree? Why did you show them what you can do? If you saw someone with exceptional powers, wouldn’t you want them, too? Sooner or later, your fellow disciples will ask you for the magic. If you’re weak enough not to refuse them, you’ll spill the secret. If you don’t tell them, they might force it out of you. You are no longer safe here.” “Please forgive me!” begged Monkey, kowtowing. “No hard feelings. But you must leave.” Monkey’s eyes filled with tears. “Where are you sending me?” “You must go back to where you came from. You won’t last long here.” Monkey was overcome with regret. “I have been away from home for twenty years. Though I yearn to see my former subjects again, I hate to leave you before I have repaid your kindness to me.” “Forget it,” said the Patriarch. “Just don’t drag me into any of your messes.”","Not in the least like a demon monkey, Every inch a tree that withstands frost and snow. When the students saw it they clapped their hands and chuckled aloud, saying, “Good old monkey, good old monkey.” They did not realize that the row they were making had disturbed the Patriarch, who rushed out through the door, dragging his stick behind him. “Who's making a row out here?” he asked. The students hurriedly pulled themselves together, straightened their clothes and went over to him. Sun Wukong, who had now resumed his real appearance, said from the forest, “Master, we were holding a discussion here, and there were no outsiders making a din.” “Yelling and shouting like that,” the Patriarch angrily roared, “is no way for those cultivating their conduct to behave. If you are cultivating your conduct, the subtle vapours escape when you open your mouth, and when you wag your tongue, trouble starts. What was all the laughing and shouting about” “Just now Sun Wukong did a transformation for fun. We told him to turn himself into a pine tree, and he did. We all praised and applauded him, which was why we disturbed you with the noise, master. We beg you to forgive us.” The Patriarch sent them all away except for Sun Wukong, to whom he said, “Come here. Is that a way to use your spirit? To change into a pine tree? Is this a skill you should be showing off in front of people? If you saw somebody else doing that, wouldn't you ask him to teach you? If other people see you doing it, they're bound to ask you to teach them, and if you want to keep out of trouble you'll have to do so; otherwise they may do you harm, and then your life will be in danger.” Sun Wukong kowtowed and said, “Please forgive me, master.” “I shan't punish you,” the Patriarch replied, “but you'll have to go.” Sun Wukong's eyes filled with tears. “Master, where am I to go?” “Go back to where you came from.” Sun Wukong had a sudden awakening, and he said, “I came from the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body.” “If you hurry back there,” the Patriarch replied, “you will be able to preserve your life. If you stay here it will be absolutely impossible to do so.” Sun Wukong accepted his punishment. “Yes, master,” he said. “I've been away from home for twenty years and I do miss the old days and my children and grandchildren. But when I remember that I have not yet repaid your enormous generosity to me, I can't bring myself to go.” “What sort of kindness would you be doing me if you stayed? I'll be happy enough if you keep me out of any disasters you cause.”"
众怪闻言大喜。即安排酒果接风，将椰酒满斟一石碗奉上，大圣喝了一口，即咨牙咧嘴道：“不好吃！不好吃！”崩、巴二将道：“大圣在天宫，吃了仙酒、仙肴，是以椰酒不甚美口。常言道：‘美不美，乡中水。’”大圣道：“你们就是‘亲不亲，故乡人。’我今早在瑶池中受用时，见那长廊之下，有许多瓶罐，都是那玉液琼浆。你们都不曾尝着。待我再去偷他几瓶回来，你们各饮半杯，一个个也长生不老。”众猴欢喜不胜。大圣即出洞门，又翻一筋斗，使个隐身法，径至蟠桃会上。进瑶池宫阙，只见那几个造酒、盘糟、运水、烧火的，还鼾睡未醒。他将大的从左右胁下挟了两个，两手提了两个，即拨转云头回来，会众猴在于洞中，就做个“仙酒会”，各饮了几杯，快乐不题。,"The monsters were overjoyed. That is, they arranged wine and fruit to catch the wind, poured coconut wine into a stone bowl and served it. The Great Sage took a sip and grinned, ""It's not delicious! It's not delicious!"" The two generals Beng and Ba said, ""The Great Sage is in the Heavenly Palace. , I have eaten fairy wine and fairy food, so coconut wine is not very delicious. As the saying goes: 'Beautiful or not, the water in the countryside.'"" The Great Sage said: ""You are 'Kind or not, hometown people.' I am now As early as when I used it in the Jade Pond, I saw that there were many bottles and jars under the corridor, all of which were the jade liquid nectar. You have never tasted it. When I go to steal a few more bottles from him, you will drink half a cup each, one by one. Also immortal."" The monkeys were overjoyed. The Great Sage went out of the cave door, turned somersaults, used a stealth technique, and went straight to the Pantao meeting. Entering the Yaochi Palace Que, I saw the few people who made wine, dished grains, transported water, and burned fire, still snoring and not awake. He took two of the big ones under his left and right flanks, and two in his hands. He turned the cloud head and came back. The monkeys in the congregation were in the cave, and they had a ""fairy wine party"".","The various monsters were delighted by these words, and they prepared a banquet of fruits and wine to welcome him. A stone bowl was filled with coconut wine and presented to the Great Sage, who took a mouthful and then exclaimed with a grimace, “It tastes awful! Just awful!” “The Great Sage,” said Beng and Ba, the two commanders, “has grown accustomed to tasting divine wine and food in Heaven. Small wonder that coconut wine now seems hardly delectable. But the proverb says, ‘Tasty or not, it’s water from home!’” “And all of you are, ‘related or not, people from home’!” said the Great Sage. “When I was enjoying myself this morning at the Jasper Pool, I saw many jars and jugs in the corridor full of the juices of jade, which you have never savored. Let me go back and steal a few bottles to bring down here. Just drink half a cup, and each one of you will live long without growing old.” The various monkeys could not contain their delight. The Great Sage immediately left the cave and, with one somersault, went directly back to the Festival of Immortal Peaches, again using the magic of body concealment. As he entered the doorway of the Palace of the Jasper Pool, he saw that the wine makers, the grain mashers, the water carriers, and the fire tenders were still asleep and snoring. He took two large bottles, one under each arm, and carried two more in his hands. Reversing the direction of his cloud, he returned to the monkeys in the cave. They held their own Festival of Immortal Wine, with each one drinking a few cups, which incident we shall relate no further.","On hearing this, all the little monkey demons greatly rejoiced and prepared refreshments in honor of his return, and gave him a bowl of coconut wine. He lasted it; then made a wry face and said, “It is not good, not good at all. This morning I enjoyed myself in the Celestial Lake Palace, where on the side of the dining hall was abundance of a delicious carnation sauce, which you have never seen. When I go there again I will take a few jars and bring them home to you so that you may taste it and each become immortal.” All the monkeys rejoiced beyond measure. The Great Sage then went out of the cave, jumped and made himself invisible and made straight for the Peach Banquet Hall. When he got there he found all the wine servers still asleep, so he took up two jars, one under the right arm and the other under the left, and two others, one in each hand, and, mounting a cloud, he returned to the cave and served the monkeys with the wine of the Immortals, which greatly delighted all.","Elated by this update, Monkey’s monstrous audience assembled fruits and wine for a welcome-home banquet. After filling a stone bowl with coconut wine, they proffered it respectfully to Monkey. The Great Sage took a gulp and grimaced. “That is disgusting!” “Coconut wine, it’s true, bears no comparison to the food and wine of the immortals,” replied two of his generals. “But as they say: east, west, home’s best. This is the local brew.” “I spotted many more jars of that scrumptious wine at the Queen Mother’s place this morning,” said Monkey. “Give me a moment and I’ll filch another few bottles. After half a cup, you’ll all become immortals.” While the monkeys practically effervesced with anticipation, the Great Sage bounced out of the cave and again under cover of invisibility somersaulted back to the Festival of Immortal Peaches, where he found the winemakers still snoring soundly. Tucking two large bottles under each armpit and taking another few in each hand, he spun his cloud around and returned to Water-Curtain Cave, where thanks to the wine of immortality, a thoroughly good time was had by all. * * * • • • Back to the ladies-in-waiting now.","All the fiends were delighted with what they heard, and they laid on liquor and fruit with which to welcome him back. They filled a stone bowl with coconut toddy and handed it to him, but when he tasted it the Great Sage grimaced and said, “It's awful, it's awful.” Two of his Stalwart Generals, Beng and Ba, explained, “You don't find coconut toddy very tasty because you have drunk immortal liquor and eaten immortal food in the heavenly palace, Great Sage. But as the saying goes, 'Sweet or not, it's water from home.'” To this the Great Sage replied, “And all of you, whether related to me or not, are from my home. When I was enjoying myself beside the Jade Pool today I saw jars and jars of jade liquor under a portico there. As none of you have ever tasted it I'll go and pinch you a few jars; then you can each have a little drink, and live for ever.” All the monkeys were beside themselves with glee. The Great Sage then went out of the cave, turned a somersault, made himself invisible, and went straight to the Peach Banquet. As he went through the gates of the Jade Pool he saw that the men who made the wine, stirred the lees, carried the water, and looked after the fire were still snoring away. He tucked two big jars of wine under his arms, took two more in his hands, then turned his cloud round and went back to have a feast of immortal wine with the monkey masses in the cave. They all drank several cups and were very happy, but we will not go into this."
唐王道：“朕骑着马，正行至渭水河边，见双头鱼戏，被朱太尉欺心，将朕推下马来，跌落河中，几乎渰死。”魏征道：“陛下鬼气尚未解。”急着太医院进安神定魄汤药，又安排粥膳。连服一二次，方才反本还原，知得人事。一计唐王死去，已三昼夜，复回阳间为君。诗曰：万古江山几变更，历来数代败和成。周秦汉晋多奇事，谁似唐王死复生？当日天色已晚，众臣请王归寝，各各散讫。次早，脱却孝衣，换了彩服，一个个红袍乌帽，一个个紫绶金章，在那朝门外等候宣召。,"King Tang said: ""I was riding a horse and was walking to the Weishui River. When I saw the double-headed fish show, I was deceived by Taiwei Zhu and pushed me off the horse and fell into the river. I almost died."" Solution."" In a hurry, the Taiyuan Hospital entered the Anshen Dingpo decoction, and arranged a porridge meal. Even after serving it once or twice, it was only then that the original was restored, and the personnel was known. As soon as the Tang king died, it had been three days and nights, and he returned to the world as king. The poem says: The ancient world has changed a few times, and there have always been several generations of failures and successes. Zhou, Qin, Han, Jin and more strange things, who seems to be the Tang king resurrected from the dead? It was getting late that day, and all the ministers invited the king to go to bed, and all of them scattered. The next morning, he took off his filial robes and changed into colorful clothes, all with red robes and black hats, all with purple ribbons and gold medals, and waited outside the facing door to be called.","“I was riding a horse,” the Tang emperor said, “when we came near the Wei River where two fishes were playing. That deceitful Grand Marshal Zhu pushed me off my horse into the river, and I was almost drowned.” “His Majesty is still not entirely free from the influences of the dead,” said Wei Zheng. He quickly ordered from the imperial dispensary medicinal broth designed to calm his spirit and fortify his soul. They also prepared some rice gruel, and only after taking such nourishments once or twice did he become his old self again, fully regaining his living senses. A quick calculation revealed that the Tang emperor had been dead for three days and nights and then returned to life to rule again. We have thus a testimonial poem: From ancient times how oft the world has changed! History is full of kingdoms that rise and fall. Countless were the wonders of Zhou, Han, and Jin. Which could match King Tang’s from death to life recall? By then it was dusk; the various ministers withdrew after they had seen the emperor retire. The next day, they took off their mourning garb and changed into their court attire: everyone had on his red robe and black cap, his purple sash and gold medal, waiting outside the gate to be summoned to court.","The Master said: And how can you do that?” “I will ascend to Heaven, to the Ancient of Days, and beg for the Pill of Immortality, that restores the soul nine times from death.” He did so, and returned with the Pill, and the dead king was made alive again. In the West there is a secret by which to find the truth, Gold and straw and copper are tried by fire, The devout spirit is inspired with spiritual vision, The babe regrets it has no gift but a swollen body,","“The Minister of Defense in Hell just now pushed me into a river while I was watching two golden carp,” he explained. Wei Zheng quickly ordered some medicinal broth and rice porridge. A couple of portions later, the emperor—after three days and nights of being dead—felt quite himself again. The next day the courtiers swapped their mourning clothes for their usual red, black, purple, and gold court outfits, and listened admiringly to the emperor—magnificent in a dark yellow robe—recount his time in the underworld.","“We were riding along the banks of the River Wei and watching to fishes playing when that deceitful Marshal Zhu pushed us off the horse and made us fall into the river, where we all but drowned.” “Your Majesty still has something of the ghost about you,” said Wei Zheng, and he ordered the Imperial Medical Academy to send medicinal potions to settle the spirit and calm the soul at once; he also sent for some thin gruel. After one or two doses of the medicine the Emperor returned to normal and regained full consciousness. The Tang Emperor had been dead for three days and nights before returning to rule the world of the living once more. There is a poem to prove it: Since ancient times there have been changes of power; Dynasties have always waxed and waned. What deed of the kings of old could compare With the Emperor of Tang returning to life? As it was evening by then the ministers asked the Emperor to go to bed, and they all dispersed. The next day they all took off their mourning garments and put colorful clothes back on. Wearing red robes and black hats, and with their golden seals of office hanging from purple ribbons at their waists, they stood outside the gates of the court awaiting the summons."
次日，丞相入朝，启奏唐王曰：“今有臣婿状元陈光蕊，带领家小江州赴任，被稍水刘洪打死，占女为妻，假冒臣婿，为官多年，事属异变。乞陛下立发人马，剿除贼寇。”唐王见奏大怒，就发御林军六万，着殷丞相督兵前去。丞相领旨出朝，即往教场内点了兵，径往江州进发。晓行夜宿，星落鸟飞，不觉已到江州。殷丞相兵马，俱在北岸下了营寨。星夜令金牌下户唤到江州同知、州判二人，丞相对他说知此事，叫他提兵相助，一同过江而去。天尚未明，就把刘洪衙门围了。刘洪正在梦中，听得火炮一响，金鼓齐鸣，众兵杀进私衙，刘洪措手不及，早被擒住。丞相传下军令，将刘洪一干人犯，绑赴法场，令众军俱在城外安营去了。,"The next day, the prime minister entered the court and played the king of Tang, saying: ""Today there is a minister-in-law, the champion Chen Guangrui, who led his family to Xiaojiangzhou to take office. Mutation. I beg Your Majesty to send troops to exterminate the bandits."" Seeing the anger, the King of Tang sent the Imperial Forest Army of 60,000 troops to go with Prime Minister Yin to supervise the troops. The Prime Minister led the decree to go out to the court, and immediately ordered soldiers in the teaching field, and set off for Jiangzhou. Xiaoxing stayed overnight, the stars fell and the birds flew, and I didn't realize that I had arrived in Jiangzhou. Prime Minister Yin's troops and horses all set up camp on the north bank. Xingye ordered the gold medal under the household to call Jiangzhou Tongzhi and the state judge. The prime minister told him about the matter and asked him to help him and cross the river together. Before dawn, Liu Hongyamen was surrounded. Liu Hong was in a dream when he heard the sound of artillery, the sound of golden drums, and all the soldiers rushed into the private ya, Liu Hong was caught off guard and was captured long ago. According to legend, the prime minister issued a military order to kidnap Liu Hong to the court, and ordered all the troops to camp outside the city.","The next day, the chief minister went into court to present his memorial to the Tang emperor, which read: The son-in-law of your subject, the zhuangyuan Chen Guangrui, was proceeding to his post at Jiangzhou with members of his family. He was beaten to death by the boatman Liu Hong, who then took our daughter by force to be his wife. He pretended to be the son-in-law of your subject and usurped his post for many years. This is indeed a shocking and tragic incident. I beg Your Majesty to dispatch horses and men at once to exterminate the bandits. The Tang emperor saw the memorial and became exceedingly angry. He immediately called up sixty thousand imperial soldiers and ordered the chief minister Yin to lead them forth. The chief minister took the decree and left the court to make the roll call for the troops at the barracks. They proceeded immediately toward Jiangzhou, journeying by day and resting by night, and they soon reached the place. Horses and men pitched camps on the north shore, and that very night, the chief minister summoned with golden tablets7 the Subprefect and County Judge of Jiangzhou to his camp. He explained to the two of them the reason for the expedition and asked for their military assistance. They then crossed the river and, before the sky was light, had the mansion of Liu Hong completely surrounded. Liu Hong was still in his dreams when at the shot of a single cannon and the unisonous roll of drums, the soldiers broke into the private quarters of the mansion. Liu Hong was seized before he could offer any resistance. The chief minister had him and the rest of the prisoners bound and taken to the field of execution, while the rest of the soldiers pitched camp outside the city.","Sun was angry with the Master for not letting him go. Then a voice from the sky was heard to say, “We are the Guardians of the Five Regions and the Four Directions, all here to protect you.” So Sun left the Master in their charge and went to fight the dragon who had just eaten the Master’s horse. He fought bravely, but the wild dragon could not be subdued. They had no choice but to ask Guanyin for help. Guanyin appeared, accused the dragon of disobedience, reminding him of their agreement. He said he had never been told that this particular monk was the Master he was supposed to carry to the West. So Guanyin turned him into a white horse to carry the Master, and they started on their journey again. A Dragon Transformed Into a Horse. In the evening they saw what appeared to be a temple and the Master was pleased to see it, hoping to rest there.","As soon as the emperor learned what had happened, he called up sixty thousand soldiers, who marched to Jiangzhou under Yin Kaishan’s command. After obtaining the cooperation of the local forces, the imperial troops surrounded the governor’s house before daybreak, broke in, and apprehended Liu Hong before he could get out of bed.","The minister went to court the next day and wrote in a memorial to the Tang Emperor: “Your subject's son-in-law, the top graduate Chen Guangrui, was murdered by the boatman Liu Hong while going with his family to take up his office in Jiangzhou, and my daughter was forced to become his wife. This Liu Hong has usurped office for many years by masquerading as my son-in-law. This constitutes treason. I beg Your Majesty to dispatch horse and foot at once to destroy this rebellious brigand.” The Tang Emperor was so angry when he read this that he ordered Minister Yin to set off at the head of sixty thousand men of the Imperial Guard. The minister left the court with the decree and went to the parade ground to muster the soldiers before setting out for Jiangzhou. By setting out at dawn every day and not stopping till night, they traveled as fast as a shooting star or a flying bird, and before they realized it they had reached Jiangzhou, where Minister Yin's army camped on the Northern bank. That night he sent a messenger with a gold-inscribed tablet to summon the deputy prefect and district judge of Jiangzhou. Minister Tin explained the situation to them and told them to call out their troops to help him. They crossed the river together, and surrounded Liu Hong's yamen before dawn. Liu Hong, who was still in his dreams, heard the sound of cannon and the beating of drums and gongs; when the soldiers rushed his residence he was helpless and soon captured. The minister ordered that Liu Hong and his gang should be tied up and taken to the execution ground, while the army was to encamp outside the city walls."
你看这猴王，分开水道，径回铁板桥头，撺将上去，只见四个老猴，领着众猴：都在桥边等待。忽然见悟空跳出波外，身上更无一点水湿，金灿灿的，走上桥来。唬得众猴一齐跪下道：“大王，好华彩耶！好华彩耶！”悟空满面春风，高登宝座，将铁棒竖在当中。那些猴不知好歹，都来拿那宝贝，却便似蜻蜓撼铁树，分毫也不能禁动。一个个咬指伸舌道：“爷爷呀！这般重，亏你怎的拿来也！”悟空近前，舒开手，一把挝起，对众笑道：“物各有主。这宝贝镇于海藏中，也不知几千百年，可可的今岁放光。龙王只认做是块黑铁，又唤做天河镇底神珍。那厮每都扛不动，请我亲去拿之。那时此宝有二丈多长，斗来粗细；被我挝他一把，意思嫌大，他就少了许多；再教小些，他又小了许多；再教小些，他又小了许多；急对天光看处，上有一行字，乃‘如意金箍棒，一万三千五百斤。’你都站开，等我再叫他变一变看。”他将那宝贝颠在手中，叫：“小！小！小！”即时就小做一个绣花针儿相似，可以塞在耳朵里面藏下。众猴骇然，叫道：“大王！还拿出来耍耍！”猴王真个去耳朵里拿出，托放掌上叫：“大！大！大！”即又大做斗来粗细，二丈长短。他弄到欢喜处，跳上桥，走出洞外，将宝贝攥在手中，使一个法天像地的神通，把腰一躬，叫声“长！”他就长的高万丈，头如泰山，腰如峻岭，眼如闪电，口似血盆，牙如剑戟；手中那棒，上抵三十三天，下至十八层地狱，把些虎豹狼虫，满山群怪，七十二洞妖王，都唬得磕头拜礼，战兢兢魄散魂飞。霎时收了法像，将宝贝还变做个绣花针儿，藏在耳内，复归洞府。慌得那各洞妖王，都来参贺。,"Look at this Monkey King, splitting the waterway, heading back to the head of the iron-panel bridge, and rushing up, there are four old monkeys leading the monkeys: they are all waiting by the bridge. Suddenly, Wukong jumped out of the wave, and his body was not wet at all, and he walked onto the bridge. Frightened, all the monkeys knelt down and said, ""Your Majesty, what a gorgeous color! What a gorgeous color!"" Those monkeys didn't know what to do, they all came to get the treasure, but they were like dragonflies shaking the iron tree, and they couldn't stop it. One by one biting their fingers and sticking out their tongues, they said, ""Grandpa! It's so heavy, how could you bring it!"" Wukong approached, stretched out his hands, raised his hands, and smiled at the crowd, ""Everything has its own owner. This treasure. Town in the sea, I don’t know how many thousands of years, Coco is shining this year. The Dragon King only recognizes it as a piece of black iron, and he calls it the treasure of Tianhe Town. That guy can’t carry it, please go and get it in person At that time, this treasure was more than 20 feet long, and it was as thick as a fight; if I gave him a hand, it was too big, and he lost a lot; if I taught it a little bit, it was a lot smaller; Much smaller; anxious to look at Tianguang, there is a line of words on it, it is 'Ruyi gold hoop, 13,500 catties.' You all stand away, wait for me to ask him to change it."" He put the The baby was in his hand and shouted, ""Small! Small! Small!"" Immediately, it was similar to making an embroidery needle, which could be stuffed in the ear and hidden. The monkeys were horrified and shouted: ""Your Majesty! You're even taking it out and playing with it!"" The Monkey King took it out of his ears, put it on his palm, and called out, ""Big! Big! Big!"" . When he got to the place of joy, he jumped on the bridge, walked out of the cave, held the treasure in his hand, used a magical power like the heavens and the earth, bowed his waist, and shouted ""Long!"" His waist is like a mountain, his eyes are like lightning, his mouth is like a blood basin, and his teeth are like swords and halberds; the stick in his hand reaches up to thirty-three days, down to the eighteenth hell, and fills the mountains with monsters. The demon kings of the seventy-two caves were so bluffed that they kowtowed and saluted, trembling and flying away. Immediately, he received the dharma image, turned the baby into an embroidery needle, hid it in his ear, and returned to the cave. In a panic, the demon kings of the caves all came to congratulate him.","Look at that Monkey King! He opened up the waterway and went straight back to the head of the sheet iron bridge. The four old monkeys were leading the other monkeys and waiting beside the bridge. They suddenly beheld Wukong leaping out of the waves: there was not a drop of water on his body as he walked onto the bridge, all radiant and golden. The various monkeys were so astonished that they all knelt down, crying, “ Great King, what marvels! What marvels!” Beaming broadly, Wukong ascended his high throne and set up the iron rod right in the center. Not knowing any better, the monkeys all came and tried to pick the treasure up. It was rather like a dragonfly attempting to shake an ironwood tree: they could not budge it an inch! Biting their fingers and sticking out their tongues, every one of them said, “O Father, it’s so heavy! How did you ever manage to bring it here?” Wukong walked up to the rod, stretched forth his hands, and picked it up. Laughing, he said to them, “Everything has its owner. This treasure has presided in the ocean treasury for who knows how many thousands of years, and it just happened to glow recently. The Dragon King only recognized it as a piece of black iron, though it is also said to be the divine rarity which fixed the bottom of the Heavenly River. All those fellows together could not lift or move it, and they asked me to take it myself. At first, this treasure was more than twenty feet long and as thick as a barrel. After I struck it once and expressed my feeling that it was too large, it grew smaller. I wanted it smaller still, and again it grew smaller. For a third time I commanded it, and it grew smaller still! When I looked at it in the light, it had on it the inscription, ‘The Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod. Weight: thirteen thousand five hundred pounds.’ Stand aside, all of you. Let me ask it to go through some more transformations.” He held the treasure in his hands and called out, “Smaller, smaller, smaller!” and at once it shrank to the size of a tiny embroidery needle, small enough to be hidden inside the ear. Awestruck, the monkeys cried, “Great King! Take it out and play with it some more.” The Monkey King took it out from his ear and placed it on his palm. “Bigger, bigger, bigger!” he shouted, and again it grew to the thickness of a barrel and more than twenty feet long. He became so delighted playing with it that he jumped onto the bridge and walked out of the cave. Grasping the treasure in his hands, he began to perform the magic of cosmic imitation. Bending over, he cried, “Grow!” and at once grew to be ten thousand feet tall, with a head like the Tai Mountain and a chest like a rugged peak, eyes like lightning and a mouth like a blood bowl, and teeth like swords and halberds. The rod in his hands was of such a size that its top reached the thirty-third Heaven and its bottom the eighteenth layer of Hell. Tigers, leopards, wolves, and crawling creatures, all the monsters of the mountain and the demon kings of the seventy-two caves, were so terrified that they kowtowed and paid homage to the Monkey King in fear and trembling. Presently he revoked his magical appearance and changed the treasure back into a tiny embroidery needle stored in his ear. He returned to the cave dwelling, but the demon kings of the various caves were still frightened, and they continued to come to pay their respects.","The four Sea Kings were greatly displeased at this and discussed how they might memorialize about the matter. But the Monkey King looked for his waterway in order to get back to the top of the iron bridge in his cave. All the monkeys were there gathered, waiting for him. Suddenly their king jumped out of the water, with not a drop of water left on him, and landed on the iron bridge. At the sight all the monkeys were greatly frightened, and fell on their knees saying, “Great King, how beautifully dressed you are.” The Monkey King was mightily pleased and ascended a high throne. He took the iron beam and made it stand on end in their midst. The monkeys were all full of wonder and came round to feel that precious beam, but their strength was like that of flies, and they could not move it the least bit. They all put out their tongues and cried, “Aiyah! Aiyah! It is terribly heavy. How did you manage to bring it? Such a tremendous weight!” The Seeker of Secrets came up, took it in his hand, and smiled at them. “Everything has a master, so has this precious beam. It has been lying in the storehouse of the sea, who knows for how many thousands of years. But just when I was there, it emitted light in all directions, and the Dragon King thought it only a bit of black iron. But it was called the Pearl of the River of Heaven. None of the people there could move it, so they asked me to go and take it. At that time this precious beam was more than twenty feet long, and stouter than a bushel measure. When I looked at it, I thought it was too big, then suddenly it became less. I thought it still too big, and again it became much less. On it are engraved a few words, “As You Like It.” All of you stand back and I will command it to change, so that you can see what it will do in my hand. When I say ‘Small, Small, Small,’ instantly it becomes the size of an embroidery needle, so that I can hide it in my ear.” And so it was. All the monkeys were greatly astonished and said, “Oh Great King, show us how you handle it.” The Monkey King took it from his ear, put it on the palm of his hand and cried, “Big, Big, Big.” Instantly it became as a bushel measure in thickness and twenty feet long. He took it in his hand with great joy, jumped outside the cave with it, and then exercised his own magic on it. He doubled up his back and cried out, “High, High, High.” In an instant he was 100,000 feet tall, and his head was as high as the peak of Mount Tai. His loins were as great as mountain ridges, his eyes like lightning, his mouth like a bucket of blood, his teeth like sharp spears. He then took the magic lance in his hand, which reached up to the 33rd heaven and down to the 18 hells, frightening the 72 demon kings in hell, so that they all kowtowed to him in fear and trembling. In the twinkling of an eye, he took the precious lance, changed it by magic to the size of an embroidery needle, and hid it in his ear, and then returned to his cave. After this, all the demon kings came to pay homage to him.","Parting the waters again, Monkey swept back onto the iron bridge, where his subjects were eagerly awaiting his return. When they saw their king suddenly leap out of the waves, perfectly dry and in his glittering new costume, they kneeled in awe. Monkey sat triumphantly on his throne with the iron staff propped up before him. Not knowing any better, his monkeys crowded around, anxious to try it themselves. Like dragonflies trying to shake a tree, they couldn’t move it even a fraction of an inch. “How did Your Majesty carry it all the way here?” they chattered in wonder. “Every object has its master,” said Monkey, smiling and picking it up. “For thousands of years, this piece of iron lay in the ocean treasury fixing the depth of the Heavenly River until, a few days ago, it began giving off light. It has a name—the Obedient Golden-Hooped Staff—and it does whatever I say. When I first laid eyes on it, it was fifty feet long and as thick as a barrel, but it shrank as soon as I told it to. Stand to one side, while I tell it to transform. Smaller!” In an instant, the staff had shrunk to the size of an embroidery needle, which Monkey tucked inside his ear. “More magic!” bayed the amazed monkeys. Their king placed the staff on the palm of his hand: “Bigger!” he shouted. It immediately became a twenty-foot pillar that was a couple of feet in diameter. Monkey now tried a touch of cosmic imitation. Bounding out of the cave, he cried “Grow!” and promptly shot up to one hundred thousand feet tall. His head resembled the craggy summit of Mount Tai, with flashing eyes and a butcher’s-bowl mouth full of razor teeth. His staff reached up to the thirty-third story of Heaven, and down to the eighteenth level of Hell. Tigers, leopards, wolves, snakes, and the demon kings of the seventy-two caves all emerged to kowtow in terror. A moment later, Monkey undid the magic, shrank the staff down to the size of a needle, tucked it inside his ear again, and sashayed back inside the cave.","Watch the Monkey King as he parts the waters and goes straight back to the iron bridge, where the four senior apes can be seen waiting for him at the head of the monkey host. Sun Wukong suddenly leapt out of the waves without a drop of water on him and gleaming with gold. As he came across the bridge the monkeys were so astonished that they fell to their knees and said, “How splendid you look, Your Majesty, how splendid.” Sun Wukong, his face lit up with youthful vigor, climbed up to his throne, thrust his cudgel into the ground in their midst. The foolish monkeys all tried to grab this treasure, but it was as futile as a dragonfly trying to shake an iron tree : they were unable to move it in the slightest. Biting their fingers and sticking out their tongues they said, “Grandpa, it's so heavy, how can you possibly lift it?” Sun Wukong went over, lifted it with one hand, and laughed as he said to them, “Everything has its rightful owner. This little treasure has been lying in the sea treasury for goodness knows how many thousands of years, but it just happened to start shining this year. The Dragon King thought it was just a piece of ordinary iron, and said it was the miraculous treasure that holds the bed of the Milky Way in place. None of his men could move it, so he had to ask me to go and fetch it myself. It was more than twenty feet long then, and as thick as a peck-measure. When I picked it up I felt that it was too big, and it shrank till it was several times as small. I told it to get even smaller, and it did that too; then I told it to get smaller still, and it got many times smaller again. I hurried out into the light of day to look at it, and I saw that there was an inscription on it that read 'AS-YOU-WILL GOLD-BANDED CUDGEL: WEIGHT 13,500 POUNDS'. Stand aside, and I'll make it change again.” Holding his treasure in his hand he said, “Shrink, shrink, shrink,” and it became as small as an embroidery needle, tiny enough to be hidden in his ear. “Your Majesty,” the monkeys cried out in astonishment, “bring it out and play with it again.” So the Monkey King brought it out of his ear again, laid it on the palm of his hand, and said, “Grow, grow, grow.” It became as thick as a peck again and twenty feet long. Now that he was really enjoying himself he bounded over the bridge and went out of the cave. Clasping his treasure he used some of his heaven and earth magic, bowed, and shouted, “Grow.” He became a hundred thousand feet tall; his head was as big as a mountain, his waist like a range of hills, his eyes flashed like lightning, his mouth seemed to be a bowl of blood, and his teeth were as swords and halberds; the cudgel in his hands reached up to the Thirty-third Heaven and down to the Eighteenth Hell. The tigers, leopards and wolves, the beasts of the mountain, and the seventy-two monster kings all kowtowed and bowed in terror, trembling so much that they went out of their minds. A moment later he reverted to his proper size, turned his treasure into an embroidery needle, hid it in his ear, and went back to the cave. The panic-stricken kings of the monsters all came to offer their congratulations."

三众进西路途，有个月平稳。行过了乌斯藏界，猛抬头见一座高山。三藏停鞭勒马道：“悟空、悟能、前面山高，须索仔细，仔细。”八戒道：“没事。这山唤做浮屠山，山中有一个乌巢禅师，在此修行，老猪也曾会他。”三藏道：“他有些甚么勾当？”,"On the way to the west of the three groups, it was stable for a month. After walking through the Wusi-Tibet world, I suddenly looked up and saw a high mountain. Sanzang stopped the whip and reined in his horse and said, ""Wukong, Wuneng, and the mountains in front of you are high, so you must be careful with your cables."" Meet him."" Sanzang said, ""What is he doing?""","The three of them proceeded toward the West, and for about a month it was an uneventful journey. When they crossed the boundary of Qoco, they looked up and saw a tall mountain. Tripitaka reined in his horse and said, “Wukong, Wuneng, there’s a tall mountain ahead. We must approach it with care.” “It’s nothing!” said Eight Rules. “This mountain is called the Pagoda Mountain and a Crow’s Nest Chan Master lives there, practicing austerities. Old Hog has met him before.” “What’s his business?” said Tripitaka.",,"“Where are the witnesses to our murdering those disciples, destroying the cart, or releasing the prisoners? Even if we did murder them—which we didn’t—only two of us should pay with our lives. And as we’re strangers in the city, how would we find their temple, at night, and with full bladders? How do they know it was us? How do we know it wasn’t you?","When the full moon of contemplation is reached, you will be pure. After travelling peacefully Westwards for a month, the three of them left the territory of Stubet and saw a mountain soaring up above their heads. Sanzang stopped whipping his horse on, reined him in, and said, “Monkey, Monkey, that's a high mountain in front of us, so please go and reconnoiter it.” “No need,” said Pig. “It's called Pagoda Mountain, and there's a Rook's Nest Hermit who cultivates his conduct on it. I've met him.” “What does he do?” Sanzang asked."
那行者闻言，心中恼怒，掣铁棒不容分说，望大仙劈头就打。大仙侧身躲过，踏祥光，径到空中。行者也腾云，急赶上去。大仙在半空现了本相，你看他怎生打扮：头戴紫金冠，无忧鹤氅穿。,"When the traveler heard this, he was annoyed in his heart. Daxian dodged sideways, stepped on the auspicious light, and walked into the air. The traveler also soared into the clouds, rushing to catch up. Daxian showed his true appearance in mid-air, look at how he dressed: wearing a purple-gold crown and a worry-free crane cloak.","When Pilgrim heard this, he grew angry and whipped out his iron rod; without waiting for further discussion, he struck at the head of the Great Immortal. Stepping aside to dodge the blow, the Great Immortal trod on the auspicious luminosity and rose into the air, closely followed by Pilgrim, who also mounted the clouds. The Great Immortal changed back into his true form in midair, and this was how he appeared: He wore a cap of purple gold, And a carefree gown trimmed with crane’s down.",,"“I knew perfectly well that those two would ask for a token of your esteem. You don’t get something for nothing, you know—and certainly not scriptures of salvation. Not so long ago, a number of our priests recited scriptures to a human family to protect them from danger and help their dead escape Hell. But they asked for only three pecks and three pints of rice in payment.","Monkey flared up at this, and with no further discussion he struck at the Great Immortal's head with his cudgel. The Great Immortal twisted away from the blow and went straight up into the sky on a beam of light, closely pursued by Monkey on a cloud. In mid-air the Great Immortal reverted to his true appearance, and this is what he looked like: A golden crown on his head, A No-worries cloak of crane's down on his body."

“你要见他怎的？”那怪道：“我本是观世音菩萨劝善，受了他的戒行，这里持斋把素，教我跟随那取经人往西天拜佛求经，将功折罪，还得正果。教我等他，这几年不闻消息。今日既是你与他做了徒弟，何不早说取经之事，只倚凶强，上门打我？”行者道：“你莫诡诈欺心软我，欲为脱身之计。果然是要保护唐僧，略无虚假，你可朝天发誓，我才带你去见我师父。”那怪扑的跪下，望空似捣碓的一般，只管磕头道：“阿弥陀佛，南无佛，我若不是真心实意，还教我犯了天条，劈尸万段！”行者见他赌咒发愿，道：“既然如此，你点把火来烧了你这住处，我方带你去。”那怪真个搬些芦苇荆棘，点着一把火，将那云栈洞烧得象个破瓦窑，对行者道：我今已无挂碍了，你却引我去罢。”行者道：“你把钉钯与我拿着。”那怪就把钯递与行者。行者又拔了一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变做一条三股麻绳，走过来，把手背绑剪了。那怪真个倒背着手，凭他怎么绑缚。却又揪着耳朵，拉着他，叫：“快走！快走！”那怪道：“轻着些儿！你的手重，揪得我耳根子疼。”行者道：“轻不成，顾你不得！常言道，善猪恶拿。只等见了我师父，果有真心，方才放你。”他两个半云半雾的，径转高家庄来。有诗为证：金性刚强能克木，心猿降得木龙归。金从木顺皆为一，木恋金仁总发挥。一主一宾无间隔，三交三合有玄微。性情并喜贞元聚，同证西方话不违。,"""Why do you want to see him?"" The strange said: ""I was originally Guanshiyin Bodhisattva persuading good deeds, and I received his precepts, and here I am fasting and practicing vegetarianism. I still have to be Zhengguo. Teach me to wait for him, and I haven’t heard any news for a few years. Since you and him are apprentices today, why didn’t you talk about learning from the scriptures earlier, and just rely on the fierce and strong, come and beat me at the door?” Walker said: “Don’t be deceitful and deceitful. Soft-hearted, I want to try to escape. It really is to protect Tang Seng, there is no falsehood, you can swear to the sky, and I will take you to see my master."" The strange knelt down, looking at the sky like a troublemaker, just kowtow Said: ""Amitabha Buddha, Namo Buddha, if I wasn't sincere, I would have taught me to break the Heavenly Law and chop up my corpse into ten thousand pieces!"" The practitioner saw him making a vow and said, ""If that's the case, you light a fire and burn your body. I'll take you there."" The monster took some reeds and thorns, lit a fire, and burned the Yunzhan Cave like a broken tile kiln, and said to the traveler: ""I'm no longer in the way, but you lead me there. The walker said: ""You take the palladium with me."" The monster handed the palladium to the walker. The walker plucked out another vellus hair, blew a fairy breath, and called, ""Change!"" It turned into a three-strand hemp rope, walked over, tied the back of his hand and cut it off. That monster really had his hands behind his back, depending on how he tied it. But he grabbed his ears, pulled him, and shouted, ""Come on! go! ""That strange said:"" Take it easy! Your hands are so heavy that it hurts my ears. The walker said: ""If you can't be light, don't take care of you!"" As the saying goes, good pigs take evil. I will only let you go after seeing my master and if you have sincerity. ""The two of them, half cloudy and half foggy, went straight to Gaojiazhuang. There is a poem to prove it: The golden nature is strong and can overcome the wood, and the heart of the ape descends to the wood dragon. Play. One host and one guest have no gaps, and the three intercourse and three together have mysterious and subtle. The temperament is also like Zhenyuan gathering, and it does not violate the Western dialect.","“Why do you want to see him?” asked Pilgrim. The monster said, “I was a convert of the Bodhisattva Guanshiyin, who commanded me to keep a vegetarian diet here and to wait for the scripture pilgrim. I was to follow him to the Western Heaven to seek scriptures from the Buddha, so that I might atone for my sins with my merit and regain the fruits of Truth. I have been waiting for a number of years without receiving any further news. Since you have been made his disciple, why didn’t you mention the search for scriptures in the first place? Why did you have to unleash your violence and attack me right at my own door?” “Don’t try to soften me with deception,” said Pilgrim, “thinking that you can escape that way. If you are truly sincere about accompanying the Tang Monk, you must face Heaven and swear that you are telling the truth. Then I’ll take you to see my master.” At once the monster knelt down and kowtowed as rapidly as if he were pounding rice with his head. “Amitābha,” he cried, “Namo Buddha! If I am not speaking the truth in all sincerity, let me be punished as one who has offended Heaven—let me be hewn to pieces!” Hearing him swear such an oath, Pilgrim said, “ All right! You light a fire and burn up this place of yours; then I’ll take you with me.” The monster accordingly dragged in bunches of rushweed and thorns and lighted the fire; the Cloudy Paths Cave soon looked like a derelict potter’s kiln. “I have no other attachment,” he said to Pilgrim. “You can take me away.” “Give me your muckrake and let me hold it,” said Pilgrim, and our monster at once handed it over. Yanking out a piece of hair, Pilgrim blew onto it and cried, “Change!” It changed into a three-ply hemp rope with which he prepared to tie up the monster’s hands. Putting his arms behind his back, the monster did nothing to stop himself from being bound. Then Pilgrim took hold of his ear and dragged him along, crying, “Hurry! Hurry!” “Gently, please!” pleaded the monster. “You are holding me so roughly, and my ear is hurting!” “I can’t be any gentler,” said Pilgrim, “for I can’t worry about you now. As the saying goes, ‘The nicer the pig, the nastier the grip!’ After you have seen my master and proved your worth, I’ll let you go.” Rising up to a distance halfway between cloud and fog, they headed straight for the Gao Family Village. We have a poem as a testimony:19 Strong is metal’s nature to vanquish wood: Mind Monkey has the Wood Dragon subdued. With metal and wood both obedient as one, All their love and virtue will grow and show. One guest and one host20 there’s nothing between; Three matings, three unions—there’s great mystery!21 Nature and feelings gladly fused as Last and First:22 Both will surely be enlightened in the West.",,"“Wait until they’ve gone.” “But when will that be?” “Leave that to me,” said Monkey. Making a magic twist of his fingers, Monkey muttered a spell. When he exhaled, a mini cyclone hit the temple, blowing out all the lights. Tiger-Strength promptly dissolved the assembly, telling everyone to reconvene in the morning. The moment the Taoists had scattered, our three pilgrims dashed into the main hall, where Pigsy immediately stuffed one of the cakes into his mouth. “Where are your manners?” scolded Monkey, rapping Pigsy’s trotter with his staff. “We should eat sitting down. How about over there?” Monkey pointed out a dais on which statues of the Taoist Trinity—the Three Pure Ones: the Jade Pure One, the Supreme Pure One, and Monkey’s old friend Laozi—rested. “Make way for Pigsy!” shouted Pigsy, shoving Laozi onto the floor with his snout. Monkey and Sandy barged the other statues off the platform, and the three of them each transformed into the effigy they had just displaced. “But where to hide the evidence?” Monkey wondered. “Judging by the terrible smell, I suspect behind that door over there is a Bureau of Rice Reincarnation. Stash the real statues in there, would you?” Pigsy swung the statues over his shoulder and kicked open the door specified by Monkey, where he found an enormous latrine. “That Monkey truly is a master of language,” Pigsy noted with a chuckle. “Bureau of Rice Reincarnation indeed! At ease, gentlemen,” he addressed the statues. “You’ve been sitting up there for so long, you probably need the toilet. Enjoy the sewage, Pure Ones!” He then hurled them into the latrine so hard that the splash back soaked his clothes. “Success?” asked Monkey as Pigsy returned. “Apart from my freshly fragranced robe.” “Pile in,” said Monkey, giggling, “though it looks like we won’t make a clean getaway now.” Pigsy and Sandy sat down and filled their faces with enormous steamed buns, dumplings, cakes, fritters, and steamed pastries, while Monkey—who was not overly fond of cooked food—nibbled on a few pieces of fruit, just to be sociable. Soon enough, all the food was gone; the three disciples chatted and digested a while on top of the dais. As bad luck would have it, though, a young Taoist in the temple’s eastern dormitory chose that moment to remember that he had left his handbell in the hall and that he would get in trouble with the Taoist elders if he lost it. Dashing back, he managed to locate the bell and was about to leave when he heard the sound of someone breathing.","“What do you want to see him for?” Monkey asked. “Guanyin converted me and told me to obey the monastic rules and eat vegetarian food here till I could go with that pilgrim, the one who's going to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. I'll be able to make up for my sins through this good deed, and win a good reward. I've been waiting for him for years, but there's been no news of him till now. If you're a disciple of his, why didn't you say something about fetching the scriptures before, instead of making this vicious attack on me in my own home?” “This had better not be a trick to soften me up and make me let you get away,” said Monkey. “If you really want to protect the Tang Priest and you aren't trying to kid me, then you'd better make a vow to Heaven, and I'll take you to meet my master.” The monster fell to his knees with a thud, and kowtowed to the sky so often that he looked like a rice pestle. “Amitabha Buddha,” he cried out, “if I'm not completely sincere, cut me up into ten thousand bits for breaking the laws of Heaven.” After hearing him swear this oath, Monkey said, “Very well then, now light a brand and burn this place of yours out. If you do that, I'll take you.” The monster piled up some reeds and brambles, lit a brand, and set the Cloud Pathway Cave on fire; it burned as well as a brick kiln that has got out of control. “I've no second thoughts,” he said, “so please take me to see him.” “Give me that rake of yours,” Monkey ordered, and the monster obediently handed it over. Monkey then plucked out a hair, blew on it with magic breath, and shouted, “Change!” It turned into three lengths of hempen rope, with which he bound the monster's hands behind his back; the monster docilely put his hands there and let Monkey tie him up. Then Monkey seized him by the ear and led him off with the words, “Quick march.” “Take it easy,” the monster pleaded. “You're pulling so hard you're hurting my ear.” “Can't be done,” Monkey replied. “Can't show you any favours. As the old saying has it, 'even a good pig must be handled roughly.' Wait until you've seen my master. If you really are sincere, you'll be released then.” The two of them went back through cloud and mist to Gao Village, and there is a poem to prove it: The Golden Vajra is stronger than Wood, The Mind Ape could bring the Wooden Dragon to submission. When Metal obeyed and Wood was tamed they were at one; When Wood was loving and Metal kind they worked together. One host and one guest with nothing to keep them apart, With the three in harmony they had a mysterious power. Nature and feelings both rejoiced as they joined in the Supreme Principle; They both promised without reservation to go to the West."
他兄弟三众，各举神兵，一齐攻打，那大仙只把蝇帚儿演架。那里有半个时辰，他将袍袖一展，依然将四僧一马并行李，一袖笼去，返云头，又到观里。众仙接着，仙师坐于殿上，却又在袖儿里一个个搬出，将唐僧绑在阶下矮槐树上，八戒、沙僧各绑在两边树上。将行者捆倒，行者道：“想是调问哩。”不一时，捆绑停当，教把长头布取十匹来。行者笑道：“八戒！这先生好意思，拿出布来与我们做中袖哩！减省些儿，做个一口中罢了。”那小仙将家机布搬将出来。大仙道：“把唐三藏、猪八戒、沙和尚都使布裹了！”众仙一齐上前裹了。行者笑道：“好！,"The three brothers of his group, each with a magic weapon, attacked together, and the great immortal only played the fly broom. For half an hour there, he unfolded the sleeves of his robes, still carrying the four monks and one horse with their luggage, went away with their sleeves, returned to Yuntou, and went to the temple again. The immortals followed, and the immortal master sat on the hall, but he moved out one by one in his sleeves, and tied Tang Seng to the dwarf locust tree under the steps, and Bajie and Sha Seng were tied to the trees on both sides. He tied the walker down, and the walker said, ""I think it's a question."" After a while, the binding stopped, and he was taught to take ten pieces of long-headed cloth. The walker said with a smile, ""Bajie! This gentleman is so embarrassed, he took out the cloth and made it with us to make a middle sleeve! Save a little bit and make a mouthful."" Daxian said: ""Tang Sanzang, Zhu Bajie, and Monk Sha are all wrapped in cloth!"" All the immortals stepped forward and wrapped them together. The walker smiled and said, ""Okay!","The three brothers all raised their divine weapons and attacked the immortal together, but the Great Immortal had only the fly brush with which to meet his adversaries. The battle, however, had not lasted for half an hour when the Great Immortal spread open his sleeve and with one scoop, recaptured the four monks, the horse, and their luggage. Reversing the direction of his cloud, he went back to his Abbey, where he was greeted by the other immortals. The Master Immortal took a seat in the main hall and again took out the pilgrims one by one from his sleeve. The Tang Monk was bound to a short locust tree in the courtyard, while Sha Monk and Eight Rules were fastened to two other trees, one on each side. Pilgrim, however, was tightly bound but left on the ground. “I suppose,” thought Pilgrim to himself, “they are going to interrogate me.” After the immortals had finished tying up the captives, they were told to bring out ten large bales of cloth. “Eight Rules,” said Pilgrim with a laugh, “this gentleman must have the good intention of making us some clothes! He might as well be more economical and just cut us a few monks’ bells!”4 After the little immortals had brought out the homespun cloth, the Great Immortal said, “Wrap up Tripitaka Tang, Zhu Eight Rules, and Sha Monk entirely in the cloth.” The little immortals obeyed and wrapped the three of them completely. “Fine!",,"“Guanyin told us it was 108,000 miles. I did not record the distance as I went along, but I know we traveled through fourteen winters and fourteen summers. Every day, we crossed mountains, forests, and fast, wide rivers. We passed through many kingdoms, whose rulers stamped and signed our travel papers.” Tripitaka asked his disciples to present their documents to the emperor, who studied the seals of the faraway kingdoms through which the pilgrims had traveled: Precious Image, Cart-Slow, Western Liang, Bhikku, and many others. Filing the documents away, the emperor led Tripitaka by the hand to the banquet. “How are your disciples’ table manners?” Tripitaka tried to answer diplomatically: “They all started out as fiends in the wilderness. Some imperial forbearance might be necessary.” The emperor just smiled.","The three of them went for him with their magic weapons, but the Great Immortal kept them at bay with his fly-whisk. After about an hour he opened wide his sleeve and caught up master, disciples, horse, and baggage in it once more. Then he turned his cloud around and went back to his temple, where all the Immortals greeted him. After taking his seat in the hall he took them out of his sleeve one by one. He had the Tang Priest tied to a stunted locust tree at the foot of the steps, with Pig and Friar Sand tied to trees next to him. Monkey was tied up upside-down, which made him think that he was going to be tortured and interrogated. When Monkey was tightly bound, the Great Immortal sent for ten long turban-cloths. “What a kind gentleman, Pig,” said Monkey, “he's sent for some cloth to make sleeves for us—with a bit less he could have made us cassocks.” The junior Immortals fetched home-woven cloth, and on being told by the Great Immortal to wrap up Pig and Friar Sand with it, they came forward to do so. “Excellent,” said Monkey, “excellent—you're being encoffined alive.”"
十王出在森罗宝殿，控背躬身迎迓太宗。太宗谦下，不敢前行，十王道：“陛下是阳间人王，我等是阴间鬼王，分所当然，何须过让？”太宗道：“朕得罪麾下，岂敢论阴阳人鬼之道？”逊之不已。太宗前行，径入森罗殿上，与十王礼毕，分宾主坐定。,"The ten kings came out of the Senluo Palace, and bowed their backs to welcome Taizong. Taizong humbled himself and did not dare to move forward. The ten kings said: ""Your Majesty is the king of men in the world, and we are the kings of ghosts in the underworld. It's natural to divide things, so why should we make concessions?"" Taizong said: ""If I offend your subordinates, how dare you talk about the ways of ghosts and ghosts? ""Extremely inferior. Taizong walked forward, entered the Senluo Hall, and after the ceremony with the ten kings, the guests and the host were seated.","Coming out of the Treasure Hall of Darkness, they bowed to receive Taizong, who, feigning modesty, declined to lead the way. The Ten Kings said, “Your Majesty is the emperor of men in the World of Light, whereas we are but the kings of spirits in the World of Darkness. Such are indeed our appointed stations, so why should you defer to us?” “I’m afraid that I have offended all of you,” said Taizong, “ so how can I dare to speak of observing the etiquette of ghosts and men, of Light and Darkness?” Only after much protestation did Taizong proceed into the Hall of Darkness. After he had greeted the Ten Kings properly, they sat down according to the places assigned to hosts and guests.","He sprang up, brandishing his spear at the spirits and local gods, and they at once apologized and kowtowed, saying that the demons insisted on their serving them daily. On hearing that the gods had to serve the demons, the Monkey was astonished and cried out in agony, “Oh High Heaven! Since you have created me, how is it that you have also created these demons?” Whilst talking thus, Sun saw some light approaching and asked, “What is that?” The spirits who served the demons said, “This light comes from the demons’ magic treasures which shine like lamps. We are afraid they are brought out to catch you.” Then Sun said, “Now we shall have some sport.","As Taizong took this all in, the Ten Kings of the Underworld—with a tinkling of jade girdles and wafting of infernal incense—swished out to bow to their guest. “Your Majesty is the emperor of all men in the World of Light, while we are merely the kings of ghosts in the World of Darkness. After you—we insist.” “No, no—after you,” countered Taizong. Eventually, after much demurring, he accompanied the kings into their reception hall, and all took their designated seats.","They came out of the Senluo Palace and bowed to Taizong in greeting. Taizong felt too humble to go forward. “Your Majesty is a monarch in the world of light, but we are only kings in the world of darkness. It is therefore only right that we should do this, so why this excessive modesty?” “We have offended against Your Majesties,” replied Taizong, “so how can we venture to talk in terms of light and darkness, or men and ghosts?” After much yielding Taizong went into the Senluo Palace, and when they had finished bowing to each other they sat down as hosts and guest."

“且收胜会，待我差人取得大乘经来，再秉丹诚，重修善果。”众官无不遵依。当时在寺中问曰：“谁肯领朕旨意，上西天拜佛求经？”问不了，旁边闪过法师，帝前施礼道：“贫僧不才，愿效犬马之劳，与陛下求取真经，祈保我王江山永固。”唐王大喜，上前将御手扶起道：“法师果能尽此忠贤，不怕程途遥远，跋涉山川，朕情愿与你拜为兄弟。”玄奘顿首谢恩。唐王果是十分贤德，就去那寺里佛前，与玄奘拜了四拜，口称“御弟圣僧”。玄奘感谢不尽道：“陛下，贫僧有何德何能，敢蒙天恩眷顾如此？我这一去，定要捐躯努力，直至西天。如不到西天，不得真经，即死也不敢回国，永堕沉沦地狱。”随在佛前拈香，以此为誓。唐王甚喜，即命回銮，待选良利日辰，发牒出行，遂此驾回各散。,"""Let's end the victory meeting, wait until I send someone to obtain the Mahayana Sutra, and then I will be honest and re-cultivate the good fruits."" All the officials obeyed. At that time, I asked in the temple, ""Who is willing to follow my will and go to the west to worship Buddha and seek scriptures?"" I couldn't ask, but a Dharma master flashed by, and the emperor saluted and said: ""The poor monk is not talented, I would like to do the hard work of dogs and horses, and seek truth with Your Majesty. The scriptures, pray to keep my king Jiangshan forever."" Tang Wang was overjoyed, and he stepped forward and lifted his hand up and said: ""The Master can do this loyal and virtuous, not afraid of the long journey, trekking mountains and rivers, I would rather worship you as a brother."" Xuan Zang thanked him. Tang Wangguo was very virtuous, so he went to the temple in front of the Buddha, and worshipped Xuanzang four times, and he was called ""the royal brother and holy monk"". Xuanzang thanked him endlessly and said, ""Your Majesty, what kind of virtue and ability does a poor monk have, and dare to be favored by the heavens like this? When I go, I must sacrifice my life and work hard until I reach the Western Heaven. If you dare to go back to your country, you will fall into hell forever."" He sipped incense in front of the Buddha, taking this as an oath. Tang Wang was very happy, so he ordered him to return to Luang, waiting for a good day to be selected, and issued an ultimatum to go out, so he drove back to the various places.","We shall then renew our sincere effort to cultivate the fruits of virtue.” Not one of the officials disagreed with the emperor, who then asked in the temple, “Who is willing to accept our commission to seek scriptures from Buddha in the Western Heaven?” Hardly had he finished speaking when the Master of the Law stepped from the side and saluted him, saying, “Though your poor monk has no talents, he is ready to perform the service of a dog and a horse. I shall seek these true scriptures on behalf of Your Majesty, that the empire of our king may be firm and everlasting.” Highly pleased, the Tang emperor went forward to raise up the monk with his royal hands, saying, “If the Master is willing to express his loyalty this way, undaunted by the great distance or by the journey over mountains and streams, we are willing to become bond brothers with you.” Xuanzang touched his forehead to the ground to express his gratitude. Being indeed a righteous man, the Tang emperor went at once before Buddha’s image in the temple and bowed to Xuanzang four times, addressing him as “our brother and holy monk.” Deeply moved, Xuanzang said, “Your Majesty, what ability and what virtue does your poor monk possess that he should merit such affection from your Heavenly Grace? I shall not spare myself in this journey, but I shall proceed with all diligence until I reach the Western Heaven. If I do not attain my goal, or the true scriptures, I shall not return to our land even if I have to die. I would rather fall into eternal perdition in Hell.” He thereupon lifted the incense before Buddha and made that his vow. Highly pleased, the Tang emperor ordered his carriage back to the palace to wait for the auspicious day and hour, when official documents could be issued for the journey to begin. And so the Throne withdrew as everyone dispersed.","The pilgrim was to be accompanied by his chief disciple, the Sun the Seeker of Emptiness, Zhu the Seeker of Strength, and Sha the Seeker of Purity. And so on and so on. On hearing this Sha the Monk could not wait any longer, but cried out, “Brother Sun, the Master has lost his felt bag and the emperor’s edict, and now I see you have them. Do not heed the Master’s behavior towards you. Come back and let us continue our journey for the Sacred Scriptures. But if you are unwilling to return, I beg of you a thousand times to let me have the bag with the emperor’s edict.” The false Sun laughed coldly and said, “Having read this edict, I will myself go to the West for the Sacred Scriptures and acquire merit and make a name for myself that shall never be forgotten.” Sha the Monk replied, “That is impossible! It was never said that a monkey was to procure the Scriptures. If the Master does not go with you, Buddha will not give you the Scriptures.” The impostor answered, “But I have provided myself with a duplicate Master.”","“Deepest thanks.” Tripitaka bowed to him. Boqin returned the bow and they went their separate ways. Tripitaka and his new, still naked disciple set off across the Mountain of Two Frontiers. Soon enough, yet another tiger presented itself, snarling and swishing its tail. Tripitaka—on horseback—cowered; Monkey, by contrast, was delighted: “ Don’t worry, Master. He’s just here to deliver some clothes.” He pulled the needle-shaped iron out of his ear: with one wave, it became a thick cudgel. “Time to give my precious a little exercise, after five hundred years’ rest.” He strode up to the tiger. “Where do you think you’re going?” While the tiger crouched, as if mesmerized, Monkey with one blow smashed its brains and teeth into a gory porridge. Tripitaka rolled off his horse in terror at Monkey’s deadly speed.","If anyone is willing to go for them, His reward will be a golden body.” When he had read these lines Taizong issued an order to the assembly of monks: “Suspend this service until we have sent someone to fetch the scriptures of the Great Vehicle, and then you shall once more strive sincerely to achieve good retribution.” The monks all obeyed his instructions. The Emperor then asked those present in the monastery, “Who is willing to accept our commission to go to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and fetch the scriptures?” Before he had finished his question, the Master of the Law came forward, bowed low in greeting, and said, “Although I am lacking in ability, I would like to offer my humble efforts to fetch the true scriptures for Your Majesty and thus ensure the eternal security of your empire.” The Tang Emperor, who was overjoyed to hear this, went forward to raise him to his feet. “Master,” he said, “if you are prepared to exert your loyalty and wisdom to the full, not fearing the length of the journey or the rivers and mountains you will have to cross, I shall make you my own sworn brother.” Xuanzang kowtowed to thank him. As the Tang Emperor was indeed a man of wisdom and virtue he went to a place before the Buddha in the monastery where he bowed to Xuanzang four times, calling him “younger brother” and “holy monk.” Xuanzang thanked him effusively. “Your Majesty,” he said, “I have no virtue or talent that fits me for the sacred honour of being treated as your kinsman. On this journey I shall give my all and go straight to the Western Heaven. If I fail to reach there or to obtain the true scriptures, then I shall not return to this country even in death, and shall fall for eternity into Hell.” He burned incense in front of the Buddha to mark this vow. The happy Emperor ordered his chariot to take him back to the palace; later on an auspicious day would be chosen on which Xuanzang would be given a passport and set out. With that he returned and everyone dispersed."
“罢了！对头又来了！”行者道：“师父，且把善字儿包起，让我们使些凶恶，一发结果了他，脱身去罢。”唐僧闻言，战战兢兢，未曾答应，沙僧掣宝杖，八戒举钉钯，大圣使铁棒，一齐上前，把大仙围住在空中，乱打乱筑。这场恶斗，有诗为证，诗曰：悟空不识镇元仙，与世同君妙更玄。三件神兵施猛烈，一根塵尾自飘然。左遮右挡随来往，后架前迎任转旋。夜去朝来难脱体，淹留何日到西天！,"""Forget it! The enemy is here again!"" The traveler said: ""Master, wrap up the good words, let us make some vicious, one shot and kill him, get out."" Tang Seng heard the words, trembling, did not agree, Sha The monks held the treasured staff, the Bajie held up the nails and the palladium, and the great sage's iron rods all stepped forward, surrounded the great immortals in the air, and smashed the buildings. This fierce battle is evidenced by a poem. The poem says: Wukong does not know Zhenyuanxian, and he is more mysterious with the world. The three divine weapons were violently applied, and a dust tail floated freely. The left and right blocks follow the traffic, and the front of the rear frame welcomes and rotates. It's hard to get rid of the body at night and in the morning, when will you stay in the western sky!","Our foe is here again!” “Master,” said Pilgrim, “let’s pack up that little word ‘Kindness’ for the moment. Allow us to indulge in a little violence and finish him off so that we can make our escape.” When the Tang Monk heard these words, he trembled all over, hardly able to reply. Without even waiting for his answer, however, Sha Monk lifted his precious staff, Eight Rules brought out his muck-rake, and the Great Sage wielded his iron rod. They all rushed forward to surround the Great Immortal in midair and began to strike at him furiously. For this vicious battle, we have the following poem as testimony: Wukong knew not that Zhenyuan Immortal— Lord, Equal to Earth—was wondrous and strange. Though three weapons divine showed forth their might, One yak’s-tail flew up with natural ease To parry the thrusts on the left and right, To block the blows struck at the front and back. Night passed, day came, still they could not escape! How long would it take them to reach the West?",,"“His protection was invaluable on the journey.” Next came Pigsy, once a committed fiend from Tibet, subsequently converted by Guanyin and subdued by Monkey. “He carried the luggage and helped us cross rivers.” Then Sandy, who repented of his cannibalistic ways at the River of Flowing Sand. Finally, Tripitaka explained that—although it looked identical—the horse was not the one the emperor had originally given him. “When we tried to cross the Brook of Eagle’s Sorrow on Serpent’s Coil Mountain, your horse was eaten by this horse. Except at the time, this horse was the princeling son of the Dragon King of the Western Ocean. He would have been executed for setting fire to some pearls but for the intervention of Guanyin, who changed him into a horse identical to the one he had eaten. He carried me over the most treacherous, precipitous terrain, and brought the scriptures back to Chang’an.” Taking all this in stride, Taizong asked how long the journey to the west was.","“We're done for,” exclaimed Pig, “our enemy's come back.” “Put all your piety away for now, master,” said Monkey, “while we finish him off once and for all with a bit of evil; then we'll be able to escape.” The Tang Priest shivered and shook on hearing this, and before he could answer, the three disciples rushed forward, Friar Sand wielding his staff, Pig with his rake held high, and the Great Sage Monkey brandishing his iron cudgel. They surrounded the Great Immortal in mid-air and struck wildly at him. There are some verses about this terrible fight: Monkey did not know that the Immortal Zhen Yuan, The Conjoint Lord of the Age, had even deeper powers. While the three magic weapons fiercely whirled, His deer-tail fly-whisk gently waved. Parrying to left and right, he moved to and fro, Blocking blows from front and back he let them rush around. When night gave way to dawn they still were locked in combat. If they tarried here they would never reach the Western Heaven."
“我们已商议了，着那个姓猪的招赘门下。”八戒道：“兄弟，不要栽我，还从众计较。”行者道：“还计较甚么？你已是在后门首说合的停停当当，娘都叫了，又有甚么计较？师父做个男亲家，这婆儿做个女亲家，等老孙做个保亲，沙僧做个媒人。也不必看通书，今朝是个天恩上吉日，你来拜了师父，进去做了女婿罢。”八戒道：“弄不成！弄不成！那里好干这个勾当！”行者道：,"""We've already discussed, and we're going to be under that surnamed pig.""

Let’s discuss the matter further.” “What’s there to discuss?” said Pilgrim. “You have already made all the arrangements with her at the back door, and even call her ‘Mama.’ What’s there to discuss anymore? Master can be the in-law for the groom while this woman here will give away the bride; old Monkey will be the witness, and Sha Monk the go-between. There’s no need even to consult the almanac, for today happens to be the most auspicious and lucky day. You come here and bow to Master, and then you can go inside and become her son-in-law.” “Nothing doing! Nothing doing!” said Eight Rules. “How can I engage in this kind of business?” “Idiot!” said Pilgrim.",,"In no time at all, the two were chatting pleasantly over tea. “It’s been too long,” offered “Bull Demon.” “Indeed!” returned Iron-Fan. “You’ve been so wrapped up in your new consort that you seem to have completely forgotten about me. What brings you here today?” “How could I forget you? It’s just that after moving in with Princess Jade-Face, I’ve been run ragged by one thing after another: my friends’ problems, running another household. But I’m here to warn you about something. I just heard that Monkey is plotting to get your fan from you so that he can cross Flame Mountain. I still haven’t forgiven him for what he did to our son. Tell me the moment he shows up here so that I can chop him into ten thousand pieces.” Iron-Fan now summarized her two encounters with Monkey, all the way up to her capitulation over his stomach calisthenics. “What?” exploded her fake husband. “Monkey already has the fan?” “Don’t worry!” Iron-Fan smirked. “I fobbed him off with a fake.”","“We've already made up our minds that Mr. Pig is to be your son-in-law,” Friar Sand replied. “Don't pick on me, brother,” said Pig, “we should discuss this together.” “No need to,” said Monkey. “You've already fixed everything up at the back door and called her 'mother,' so there's nothing to discuss. Our master can represent the groom's family, this lady is the bride's family, I can be best man, and Friar Sand can be the matchmaker. There's no need to bother with the usual exchange of letters, and today is a most auspicious one full of heavenly grace, so bow to the master and go in to be her son-in-law.” “Impossible,” said Pig, “impossible. I couldn't do a thing like that.” “Stop trying to cover up, blockhead,” said Monkey."

Before his departure, Master Zhenyuan gave instructions to the two young lads, saying, “I cannot refuse the invitation of the Great Honorable Divine, and I’m leaving for the Miluo Palace to attend a lecture. You two must be watchful, for an old friend of mine will be passing by here any day. Don’t fail to treat him kindly: you may, in fact, strike down from the tree two of the ginseng fruits for him to eat as a token of our past friendship.” “Who is this friend of yours, Master?” asked one of the lads. “Tell us, so that we may take good care of him.” “He is a holy monk serving the Great Tang Emperor in the land of the East,” said the Great Immortal, “and his religious name is Tripitaka. He is now on his way to the Western Heaven to acquire scriptures from Buddha.” “According to Confucius,” said one of the lads, laughing, “‘One does not take counsel with those who follow a different Way. ’7 We belong to the Mysterious Fold of the Great Monad. Why should we associate with a Buddhist monk?” “You should know,” said the Great Immortal, “that that monk happens to be the incarnate Gold Cicada, the second disciple of Tathāgata, the Aged Sage of the West. Five hundred years ago, I became acquainted with him during the Feast of the Ullambana Bowl, when he presented me tea with his own hands as the various sons of Buddha paid me their respect. That’s why I consider him an old friend.” When the two immortal lads heard these words, they accepted them as the instruction of their master.",,"Their only outlet for protest is satire—renaming this place the City of Young Sons. You mustn’t mention any of this when you go to court tomorrow to have your travel documents checked.” The stationmaster retired for the night, but Tripitaka was left distraught with horror at the king’s debauchery and cruelty. “Don’t cry over other people’s coffins,” the pragmatic Pigsy advised him. “Ministers and sons should die if their kings and fathers ask it. It’s none of our business if he wants to kill his own subjects. Let’s get some sleep.” “Where’s your compassion?” asked Tripitaka. “This deluded king is planning to eat human hearts to prolong his own life.” “Let’s raise the matter with the king tomorrow at court,” ventured Sandy, “and size up this Taoist at the same time.” “Sandy’s right,” agreed Monkey. “Try to sleep now, and tomorrow I’ll go with you to court. If the Taoist is just a foolish priest who believes that medicines can make you live forever, I will put him right. If he turns out to be a demon, I will destroy him to teach the king a lesson. Either way, I won’t allow the king to kill any of those boys. I’m going to whisk them to a safe place outside the city this very night.” “Wonderful, Monkey!” exclaimed Tripitaka. “But please go now—there’s not a moment to lose!” After reminding Pigsy and Sandy to take care of Tripitaka, Monkey soared into the air and made a magic sign that summoned the pilgrimage’s guardian deities, along with the city god, the local god, the god of the land, and a handful of other immortal administrators. “What’s the emergency?” they asked, bowing and yawning. “It’s the middle of the night.” “We have just learned about Bhikku’s cruel king,” Monkey explained. “He has been duped by a demon who has told him that eating the hearts of little boys will prolong his own life.","Pure Wind was 1,320 years old, and Bright Moon had just turned 1,200.

An old friend of mine will be coming this way before long, and you must entertain him very well indeed. You can pick two manfruits for him as a token of our old friendship.” “Who is this old friend of yours, master?” the boys asked. “Please tell us who he is so that we can entertain him properly.” “He is a priest sent by the Tang Emperor in the East,” the Great Immortal replied, “and he is known as Sanzang. He is the monk going to worship the Buddha and ask for the scriptures in the Western Heaven.” “Confucius said, 'Don't have anything to do with people of a different way,'“ replied the boys with smiles. “Ours is the esoteric sect of the Great Monad, so why ever are you friends with that Buddhist monk?” “You are not aware,” the Great Immortal replied, “that he is a reincarnation of the Golden Cicada, the second disciple of the Tathagata Buddha, that ancient sage of the West.

The Bodhisattva said: ""Since there are good fruits, I will give you a Dharma name. ""The Great Sage said:"" I have a name, called Sun Wukong.

You shall keep the teachings and hold the rosary to enter our gate of Buddha, so that you may again cultivate the fruits of righteousness. Will you do that?” “I’m willing, I’m willing,” said the Great Sage repeatedly. “If you are indeed seeking the fruits of virtue,” said the Bodhisattva, “let me give you a religious name.” “I have one already,” said the Great Sage, “and I’m called Sun Wukong.” “There were two persons before you who came into our faith,” said the delighted Bodhisattva, “and their names, too, are built on the word ‘Wu.’ Your name will agree with theirs perfectly, and that is splendid indeed.

Down a steep precipice crouched daughters in law, who did not get along with their mothers in law. They were being bitten by serpents, and devoured by dogs as powerful as brass and iron. These were punished forever on this Bridge of Despair. As they were talking, they found that those who had come to meet them on the bridge had already gone back. The emperor was alarmed, for the Judge and the Executioner, whom he followed, had already crossing the dreadful river, which was the boundary. Before them was the city where lived the spirits of those who had died unjustly. He heard them shouting from one to the other, “Li Shiming has come! Li Shiming has come!” Li Shiming was Taizong’s original name. On hearing all this shouting, the emperor, trembling with fear, saw a company of deformed ghosts with broken backs and arms, with feet but no heads, who stopped him and cried out, “Restore our lives! Restore our lives!” At this the emperor was so terrified that he wished to hide himself. He called out to Judge Cui, “Save me, save me!” The Judge said, “These ghosts are the innocent souls of those who suffered wrongly with the sixty four rebels, and the innocent souls of those who suffered wrongly with the seventy-two robbers; they are without any redress, and cannot be reborn on earth, as they have no money for traveling expenses.","Guanyin thawed on hearing this. “If you really mean it, I’ll send my pilgrim from the east to rescue you.

You’ll make quite a trio. Well, no time for chitchat. I must be off.”","“The sacred scriptures say,” she replied, '“If one's words are good, they will meet with a response from even a thousand miles away; if they are bad, they will be opposed from the same distance.' If this is your state of mind, then wait while I go to the East to find the man who will fetch the scriptures; I'll tell him to rescue you. You can be his disciple, observe and uphold the faith, enter our Buddha's religion, and cultivate good retribution for yourself in the future. What do you say to that?” “I'll go, I'll go,” the Great Sage repeated over and over again. “As you have reformed,” she said, “I'll give you a Buddhist name.” “I've already got a name. It's Sun Wukong.” The Bodhisattva, very pleased, said, “I made two converts earlier, and their names both contained Wu ('Awakened'). There's no need to give you any further instructions, so I'll be off.” The Great Sage, now aware of his own Buddha-nature, was converted to the Buddha's religion; and the Bodhisattva devotedly continued her search for a saintly monk."

Sun said to the king, “I have another matter to inform your majesty. This mountain is called Centipede Mountain, and they say that many people suffer annually from these pests.

He uttered the magic word om, thus calling out the local tutelary god and the god of the mountain, who both knelt before him and reported their arrival. “Put out your ankles,” Monkey said, “while I give you five strokes each of my cudgel to work off my temper.” The two gods kowtowed and pleaded pitifully, “We beg the Great Sage to allow us petty gods to report.” “What have you got to say?” Monkey asked. “We didn't know when you emerged after your long sufferings, Great Sage,” they said, “which is why we didn't come to meet you. We beg to be forgiven.”"
如来即辞了玉帝众神，与二尊者出天门之外，又发一个慈悲心，念动真言咒语，将五行山召一尊土地神祗，会同五方揭谛，居住此山监押。但他饥时，与他铁丸子吃；渴时，与他溶化的铜汁饮。待他灾愆满日，自有人救他。正是：,"The Tathagata immediately resigned from the Jade Emperor and the gods, and went out with the two venerables outside the gate of heaven. He sent out a compassionate heart, recited mantras and mantras, and summoned a god of the earth from the Five Elements Mountain. But when he is hungry, he eats with his iron balls; when he is thirsty, he drinks with his molten copper juice. When he is full of calamities, someone will save him. Exactly:","Tathāgata then took leave of the Jade Emperor and the deities, and went with the two devas out of the Heaven Gate. Moved by compassion, he recited a divine spell and called together a local spirit and the Fearless Guards of Five Quarters to stand watch over the Five-Phases Mountain. They were told to feed the prisoner with iron pellets when he was hungry and to give him melted copper to drink when he was thirsty. When the time of his chastisement was fulfilled, they were told, someone would be coming to deliver him. So it is that","Buddha then took leave of the Jade Emperor and all the gods. As he, with his two disciples, passed through the Gate of Heaven, they pronounced a blessing. Guanyin called one of the local gods and some Tartar soldiers of the surrounding regions to guard the mountain. “When the Monkey is hungry, give him an iron pill; when he is thirsty, give him some copper syrup, and when the days of his punishment are ended, there will come someone to deliver him.”","The Buddha and his disciples now bid farewell to the Jade Emperor and his gods. Compassionate as ever, the Buddha, before returning to the west, appointed some protective spirits to guard the Five-Phases Mountain. When the prisoner was hungry, he explained, they should feed him iron pellets; when he was thirsty, he was to be given molten copper.","The Buddha then took his leave of the Jade Emperor and all the other deities. When he and his two disciples had gone out through the gates of Heaven his merciful heart moved him to chant a spell ordering a local tutelary god and the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions to live on the mountain and keep guard over him. When he was hungry they were to feed him iron pellets, and when he was thirsty they were to give him molten copper to drink. When the time of his punishment was over, someone would come and rescue him. Indeed:"
唐僧上前，以左手拈香注炉，三匝礼拜，拜毕回头道：“仙童，你五庄观真是西方仙界，何不供养三清、四帝、罗天诸宰，只将天地二字侍奉香火？”童子笑道：“不瞒老师说，这两个字，上头的，礼上还当；下边的，还受不得我们的香火。是家师父谄佞出来的。”三藏道：“何为谄佞？”童子道：“三清是家师的朋友，四帝是家师的故人，九曜是家师的晚辈，元辰是家师的下宾。”那行者闻言，就笑得打跌，八戒道：“哥啊，你笑怎的？”行者道：“只讲老孙会捣鬼，原来这道童会捆风！”三藏道：“令师何在？”童子道：“家师元始天尊降简请到上清天弥罗宫听讲混元道果去了，不在家。”行者闻言，忍不住喝了一声道：“这个臊道童！人也不认得，你在那个面前捣鬼，扯甚么空心架子！那弥罗宫有谁是太乙天仙？请你这泼牛蹄子去讲甚么！”三藏见他发怒，恐怕那童子回言，斗起祸来，便道：“悟空，且休争竞，我们既进来就出去，显得没了方情。常言道，鹭鸶不吃鹭鸶肉。,"The Tang monk stepped forward, poured incense into the furnace with his left hand, made three salutations, turned his head and said, ""Xiantong, your Five Village Views are really the Western fairyland, why don't you make offerings to the three sages, the four emperors, and Luotian, and only serve the two characters of heaven and earth. Incense?"" The boy smiled and said, ""Tell the teacher to say, these two words, the upper part is worthy of the ceremony; the lower part, can't stand our incense. It is the master who flattered it out."" Sanzang said: ""Why? For flattery?"" The boy said, ""Sanqing is a friend of the teacher, the four emperors are the old friend of the teacher, Jiu Yao is the junior of the teacher, and Yuan Chen is the servant of the teacher."" The traveler laughed when he heard the words. Falling down, Bajie said, ""Brother, why are you laughing?"" The walker said, ""It's just that the old grandson can play tricks, so it turns out that this Taoist boy can bind the wind!"" Sanzang said: ""Where is the master?"" The boy said: ""My family Shi Yuanshi Tianzun sent a brief request to the Shangqing Tianmiruo Palace to listen to the Hunyuan Daoguo, and he was not at home."" Hearing the words, the practitioner couldn't help but snorted: ""This shameful Dao boy! People don't recognize you, you Playing tricks in front of that, what a hollow frame! Who is the Taiyi Heavenly Immortal in the Miluo Palace? Please talk about it!"" Seeing him angry, Sanzang was afraid that the boy would reply, and he would start a fight, and said: ""Wukong, let's not compete, we go out as soon as we come in, it seems that there is no love. As the saying goes, egrets don't eat egrets meat.","The Tang Monk went forward and with his left hand, took up some incense to put into the urn. He then prostrated himself three times before the table, after which he turned around and said, “Immortal lads, your Five Villages Abbey is in truth a godly region of the West. But why is it that you do not worship the Three Pure Ones, the Thearchs of Four Quarters, or the many Lords of High Heaven? Why is it that you merely put up these two words of Heaven and Earth to receive the oblation of fire and incense?” Smiling, one of the lads said, “To tell you the truth, Master, putting these two words up is an act of flattery on the part of our teacher, for of these two words, the one on top,8 may deserve our reverence, but the one below is hardly worthy of our fire and incense.” “What do you mean by an act of flattery?” asked Tripitaka. The lad replied, “The Three Pure Ones are friends of our teacher; the Four Thearchs, his old acquaintances; the Nine Luminaries, his junior colleagues; and the God of the New Year, his unwanted guest!” When Pilgrim heard this remark, he laughed so hard that he could barely stand up. “Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “why are you laughing?” “Talk about the shenanigans of old Monkey!” said Pilgrim. “Just listen to the flimflam of this Daoist kid!” “Where is your honorable teacher?” asked Tripitaka. “Our teacher,” said the lad, “had been invited by the Honorable Divine of the Origin to attend a lecture on ‘The Daoist Fruit of the Chaotic Origin’ at the Miluo Palace in the Heaven of Highest Clarity. He’s not home.” No longer able to restrain himself after hearing these words, Pilgrim shouted: “You stinking young Daoists! You can’t even recognize people! Whom are you trying to hoodwink? What kind of taradiddle is this? Who is that Heavenly Immortal in the Miluo Palace who wanted to invite this wild bull shank of yours? And what sort of lecture is he going to give?” When Tripitaka saw how aroused Pilgrim was, he feared that the lads might give some reply that would lead to real trouble. So he said, “Wukong, stop being quarrelsome. If we leave this place the moment after we arrive, it is hardly a friendly gesture. The proverb says, ‘The egrets do not devour the egret’s flesh.’",,"Tripitaka was about to leave the palace when Monkey, now perched on his ear, buzzed: “That Taoist is a demon who has entrapped the king. Go back to the posthouse; I’ll stick around to find out more.” While Tripitaka obediently returned to their lodgings, Monkey roosted on a kingfisher screen. The Commander of the Five Garrisons stepped forward to make a report. “Last night, sire, a cold wind blew away the coops containing the boys. All have vanished without a trace.” “Heaven is plotting to destroy me!” the frightened, angry king told the Taoist. “I’ve been on the brink of death all these months, and just as we were ready to gouge out these little boys’ hearts for your divine prescription at midday today, they’ve disappeared.” “Calm down, Your Majesty,” the Taoist said, smiling. “Heaven has just gifted you eternal life.” “What?” asked the confused king. “As soon as I walked in, I spotted an ingredient much more effective than the hearts of 1,111 little boys. Those hearts would enable you to live only to a thousand; the new supplement I have in mind will sustain you for ten thousand years.” “What?” repeated the king, even more confused. “That Buddhist monk, I saw immediately, has devoted himself to his faith for at least ten incarnations. He has conserved his masculine essence, his yang, all this time and is therefore ten thousand times more purely powerful than those little boys. If you wash down my medicine with a broth made from his heart, I guarantee you will live for ten millennia.” The doltish king instantly believed him. “Why didn’t you say so earlier?","Then he turned round to the boys and said, “This temple is a home of Immortals in the Western Continent, so why don't you worship the Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors, and all the ministers of Heaven? Why do you burn incense to the two words 'Heaven' and 'Earth?'” “To be frank with you, venerable teacher,” the boys replied with smiles, “it's quite right to worship the top word, 'Heaven,' but the bottom one, 'Earth,' gets no incense from us. Our teacher only put them up to ingratiate himself.” “How does he ingratiate himself?” Sanzang asked. “The Three Pure Ones and the Four Emperors are our teacher's friends,” the boys replied, “the Nine Bright Shiners are his juniors, and the Constellations are his underlings.” When Monkey heard this he collapsed with laughter, and Pig asked him, “What are you laughing at?” “They say that I get up to no good, but these Taoist boys really tell whoppers.” “Where is your teacher?” Sanzang asked them. “He had an invitation from the Original Celestial Jade Pure One and has gone to the Palace in the Heaven of Supreme Purity to hear a lecture on the Product of Undifferentiated Unity, so he's not at home.” At this Monkey could not help roaring, “Stinking Taoist boys, you don't know who you're talking to. You play your dirty tricks in front of our faces and pretend to be oh-so-innocent. What Heavenly Immortal of the Great Monad lives in the Miluo Palace? Who invited your cow's hoof of a master to a lecture?” Sanzang was worried that now he had lost his temper the boys would answer back and spark off a disastrous fight, so he said, “Don't quarrel with them, Wukong. We'll be going in a minute, so we obviously need have nothing to do with them. Besides, as the saying goes, 'egrets don't eat egret flesh'."
“鬼来了！鬼来了！”三藏近前搀住叫道：“老施主，休怕。他是我贫僧的徒弟，不是鬼怪。”老者抬头，见了三藏的面貌清奇，方然立定，问道：“你是那寺里来的和尚，带这恶人上我门来？”,"""The ghost is here! The ghost is here!"" Sanzang stepped forward and shouted, ""Don't be afraid, old donor. He is my poor monk's apprentice, not a ghost."" , and asked, ""Are you a monk from that temple, and brought this wicked person to my door?""","He began to shout, “A ghost! A ghost!” and other such foolish words. Tripitaka drew near and took hold of him, saying, “Old Patron, don’t be afraid. He is my disciple, not a ghost.” Only when he looked up and saw the handsome features of Tripitaka did the old man stand still. “Which temple are you from,” he asked, “and why are you bringing such a nasty character to my door?”","“Which one does the king require?” The Taoist wizard replied, “Your black heart.” With this Sun cut himself open before the astonished gathering, and his insides tumbled out in heaps before them. The Taoist wizard said, “This Buddhist monk is full of all kinds of black arts.""","after, is it? thought Monkey, who treated the demon to one of his holds: a deft twist to the snout sent him crashing to the ground. Dusting himself off, the monster now stood more circumspectly at the side of the bed. “You seem miffed with me today, my love.","“A devil.... A devil,” he muttered deliriously. Sanzang went up to support him, saying, “Don't be afraid, aged benefactor. He's no devil, he's my disciple.”"
王母闻言，即去见玉帝，备陈前事。说不了，又见那造酒的一班人，同仙官等来奏：“不知甚么人，搅乱了‘蟠桃大会’，偷吃了玉液琼浆，其八珍百味，亦俱偷吃了。”又有四个大天师来奏上：“太上道祖来了。”玉帝即同王母出迎。老君朝礼毕，道：“老道宫中，炼了些‘九转金丹’，伺候陛下做‘丹元大会’，不期被贼偷去，特启陛下知之。”玉帝见奏，悚惧。少时，又有齐天府仙吏叩头道：“孙大圣不守执事，自昨日出游，至今未转，更不知去向。”玉帝又添疑思。只见那赤脚大仙又俯囟上奏道：“臣蒙王母诏昨日赴会，偶遇齐天大圣，对臣言万岁有旨，着他邀臣等先赴通明殿演礼，方去赴会。臣依他言语，即返至通明殿外，不见万岁龙车凤辇，又急来此俟候。”玉帝越发大惊道：“这厮假传旨意，赚哄贤卿，快着纠察灵官缉访这厮踪迹！”,"When the Queen Mother heard the words, she went to see the Jade Emperor to prepare for the previous affairs. Unable to say, I saw a group of people who made wine, together with the immortal officials and others, came to play: ""I don't know who, disturbed the 'Pan Tao Conference', and stole the jade juice nectar, and also ate all the eight treasures and hundreds of flavors."" Four more great heavenly masters came to play: ""Tai Shang Daozu is here."" The Jade Emperor went out with the Queen Mother to greet him. Laojun finished his court ceremony and said, ""In the Laodao Palace, I made some 'Jizhuan Jindan', and I served your Majesty to do the 'Dan Yuan Conference', but it was stolen by a thief. fear. When I was young, another immortal official of Qitian Mansion kowtowed and said: ""Sun Dasheng is not a deacon. He traveled yesterday, and he has not turned around since yesterday, let alone where he is going."" The Jade Emperor added doubts. I saw the barefooted immortal bowing down and playing on the fontanelle: ""I was ordered by the Queen Mother to attend the meeting yesterday, and I met the Great Sage Equaling Heaven by chance. According to his words, the minister immediately returned to the outside of the Tongming Palace, but the long-lived dragon, chariot and phoenix were not seen, and he came here in a hurry."" The Jade Emperor was even more shocked and said: ""This fellow falsely preached his will, earning money and coaxing Xianqing, and hurrying to picket. The spirit officer is looking for traces of this fellow!""","When the Queen Mother heard these words, she went immediately to the Jade Emperor and presented him with a full account of what had taken place. Before she finished speaking, the group of wine makers together with the various divine officials also came to report: “Someone unknown to us has vandalized the Festival of Immortal Peaches. The juice of jade, the eight dainties, and the hundred delicacies have all been stolen or eaten up.” Four royal preceptors then came up to announce, “The Supreme Patriarch of Dao has arrived.” The Jade Emperor went out with the Queen Mother to greet him. Having paid his respects to them, Laozi said, “There are, in the house of this old Daoist, some finished Golden Elixir of Nine Turns,14 which are reserved for the use of Your Majesty during the next Grand Festival of Cinnabar. Strange to say, they have been stolen by some thief, and I have come specifically to make this known to Your Majesty.” This report stunned the Jade Emperor. Presently the officials from the Equal to Heaven Residence came to announce, kowtowing, “The Great Sage Sun has not been discharging his duties of late. He went out yesterday and still has not yet returned. Moreover, we do not know where he went.” These words gave the Jade Emperor added anxiety. Next came the Great Immortal of Naked Feet, who prostrated himself and said, “Yesterday, in response to the Queen Mother’s invitation, your subject was on his way to attend the festival when he met by chance the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven. The Sage said to your subject that Your Majesty had ordered him to send your subject first to the Hall of Perfect Light for a rehearsal of ceremonies before attending the banquet. Your subject followed his direction and duly went to the hall. But I did not see the dragon chariot and the phoenix carriage of Your Majesty, and therefore hastened to come here to wait upon you.” More astounded than ever, the Jade Emperor said, “This fellow now falsifies imperial decrees and deceives my worthy ministers! Let the Divine Minister of Detection quickly locate his whereabouts!”","The Queen of Heaven, on hearing this, went to the Jade Emperor and told him everything. Just as she had finished, the wine servers and the officials came and reported that some one, whom they did not know, had secretly drunk all the fine wine, and eaten all the dishes. Then the four great generals announced that the Ancient of Days had arrived. The Jade Emperor and the Queen of Heaven went out to meet him. After having saluted them, he said, “I had prepared five gourds of Immortal Pills to present to you at your great banquet. Unfortunately a thief came and stole them, so I have come to explain.” The Jade Emperor, on hearing this, was alarmed. Shortly after, there came a messenger from the Palace of the Equal of Heaven, who kowtowed and said, “Sun, the Great Sage, is neglecting his duties. He went out yesterday and has not come back, and we do not know where he has gone.” The Jade Emperor was still more alarmed. Then the bare footed Taoist said, “Having received the Queen of Heaven’s invitation to the banquet, I met the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven, who told me that the Jade Emperor had ordered us to go to the Dongming Hall, to learn our proper places before proceeding to the Banquet Hall. So I turned round and went to the Dongming Hall, but I did not see Your Majesty there, so I hastened and came here.” The Jade Emperor was greatly alarmed and said, “This was a false order, deceiving my guests. Make haste and call the police superintendent, and make enquiries about where he has gone.”","The Queen Mother immediately went to inform the Jade Emperor. But before she could complete her report, the crowd of winemakers turned up to file their own complaint. “An unidentified individual has sabotaged the Festival of Immortal Peaches by drinking the jade wine and eating the hundred delicacies.” Finally, in marched Laozi, who got quickly to the point: “Person or persons unknown have stolen the top-quality elixir I was smelting for your Majesty’s personal use.” While the Jade Emperor reeled at this catalog of theft, the departmental aides from Monkey’s mansion turned up. “The Great Sage hasn’t been seen since yesterday. We’ve no idea where he is.” Just as the emperor was putting two and two together, the Barefoot Immortal prostrated himself before the throne. “I ran into the Great Sage Equal to Heaven yesterday while on my way to the Queen Mother’s festival. He told me that the Jade Emperor had ordered all the guests to attend a rehearsal in the Hall of Perfect Brightness, but no one was there when I turned up.” The Jade Emperor’s astonishment grew further. “This fellow falsifies my decrees and deceives my ministers. Tell the Spirit of Public Security to get to the bottom of this.”","On hearing this the Queen Mother went to see the Jade Emperor and gave him a full account of what had happened. Before she had finished, the liquor-makers arrived with their immortal officials to report that an unknown person had thrown the Grand Peach Banquet into confusion and stolen the jade liquor as well as the precious delicacies of a hundred flavors. Then came Four Heavenly Teachers to announce that the Supreme Patriarch of the Way, Lao Zi, had arrived. The Jade Emperor went out with the Queen Mother to meet him, and after doing obeisance Lao Zi said, “I had refined some Golden Pills of the Nine Transformations in my palace for a Feast of Elixir Pills with Your Majesty, but a thief has stolen them. This is what I have come to report to Your Majesty.” This news made the Jade Emperor tremble with fear. Not long afterwards the immortal administrators from the Equaling Heaven Residence came to kowtow and report: “The Great Sage Sun Wukong abandoned his post and went wandering off yesterday. He has not come back yet and we do not know where he has gone.” The Jade Emperor, now more suspicious than ever, then saw the Bare-Foot Immortal bow his head to the ground. “Your subject was going to the banquet on a summons from the Queen Mother,” he reported, “when I happened to meet the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. He told me, O Lord of Ten Thousand Years, that you had issued a decree ordering him to tell all the rest of us to go to the Hall of Universal Brightness for a ceremony before going to the banquet. Your subject went back to the Hall of Universal Brightness as he had told me to, but as I did not see the Imperial Dragon and Phoenix Chariot outside I hurried here to await orders.” “This wretch has the impudence to invent fraudulent decrees and deceive eminent ministers,” exclaimed the Jade Emperor with anger and astonishment. “The Miraculous Investigator is to find out at once what he has been up to.”"
正讲处，只见有一个巡山的小妖来报道：“大王！祸事了！,"At the speaking place, I saw a little demon patrolling the mountains to report: ""Your Majesty! It's a disaster!","As they were speaking, one of the little demons out on patrol came back to report: “Great King, disaster!",,"“All right, it’s a snout! What of it?”","As they were talking, a junior goblin came in from patrolling the mountain to announce, “Your Majesty, a terrible thing's happened."
伯钦把三口儿的梦话，对三藏陈诉一遍，三藏也喜。早供给了素斋，又具白银一两为谢。三藏分文不受。一家儿又恳恳拜央，三藏毕竟分文未受，但道：“是你肯发慈悲送我一程，足感至爱。”伯钦与母妻无奈，急做了些粗面烧饼干粮，叫伯钦远送，三藏欢喜收纳。太保领了母命，又唤两三个家僮，各带捕猎的器械，同上大路，看不尽那山中野景，岭上风光。行经半日，只见对面处，有一座大山，真个是高接青霄，崔巍险峻。三藏不一时，到了边前。那太保登此山如行平地。正走到半山之中，伯钦回身，立于路下道：“长老，你自前进，我却告回。”三藏闻言，滚鞍下马道：“千万敢劳太保再送一程！”伯钦道：“长老不知，此山唤做两界山，东半边属我大唐所管，西半边乃是鞑靼的地界。那厢狼虎，不伏我降，我却也不能过界，你自去罢。”三藏心惊，轮开手，牵衣执袂，滴泪难分。正在那叮咛拜别之际，只听得山脚下叫喊如雷道：“我师父来也！我师父来也！”唬得个三藏痴呆，伯钦打挣。毕竟不知是甚人叫喊，且听下回分解。,"Boqin told Sanzang about the three mouthfuls' sleep talk, and Sanzang was also happy. I had already provided vegetarian food, and I had a tael of silver as my thanks. Three Tibetan pennies are not accepted. The family prayed earnestly to Yang, and Sanzang did not receive a cent after all, but said, ""You are willing to give me a ride with mercy. I feel very much loved."" Bo Qin and his mother and wife had no choice but to make some thick noodles and biscuits in a hurry. , asked Bo Qin to send it away, and Sanzang happily accepted it. Taibao took his mother's life, and then called two or three children, each with hunting equipment, to go up the road, unable to see the wild scenery in the mountains and the scenery on the mountains. After walking for half a day, I saw a big mountain on the opposite side. After a while, Sanzang came to the front. That Taibao climbed this mountain as if walking on the ground. Halfway through the mountain, Bo Qin turned around and stood at the foot of the road and said, ""Elder, you advance on your own, but I will tell you back."" Sanzang got off his saddle after hearing this, and said, ""Don't be afraid to ask the Taibao for another ride!"" Bo Qin said: ""The elders do not know, this mountain is called Liangjie Mountain, the eastern half is under the control of my Great Tang, and the western half is the territory of the Tartars. The wolf and tiger will not surrender to me, but I will not be able to cross the border. You go."" Sanzang was startled, and he opened his hands, holding his clothes and robes, tears were indistinguishable. Just as he was saying goodbye, he heard thunderous shouts from the foot of the mountain: ""My master is here! My master is here!"" He was so stunned that Sanzang became demented, and Bo Qin beat him. After all, I don't know who is shouting, let's listen to the decomposition next time.","Boqin gave a thorough account of the dream that the three of them had, and Tripitaka was also very pleased. A vegetarian meal was again served, and a tael of silver was presented as a token of their gratitude. Tripitaka refused to accept so much as a penny, though the whole family begged him earnestly. He only said, “If, in compassion, you can escort me on the first part of my way, I shall ever be grateful for such kindness.” Boqin and his mother and wife had little alternative but hastily to prepare some biscuits from unrefined flour, which Tripitaka was glad to accept. Boqin was told to escort him as far as possible. Obeying his mother’s bidding, the Guardian also ordered several houseboys to join them, each bringing hunting equipment and weapons. They walked to the main road, and there seemed to be no end to the scenic splendor of the mountains and peaks. When they had traveled for half a day, they came upon a huge mountain so tall and rugged that it truly seemed to touch the blue sky. In a little while the whole company reached the foot of the mountain, and the Guardian began to ascend it as if he were walking on level ground. Halfway up, Boqin turned around and stood still at the side of the road, saying, “Elder, please go on yourself. I must now take leave of you and turn back.” When Tripitaka heard these words, he rolled down from his saddle and said, “I beg you to escort me a little further.” “You do not realize, Elder,” said Boqin, “that this mountain is called the Mountain of Two Frontiers; the eastern half belongs to our Great Tang domain, but the western half is the territory of the Tartars. The tigers and wolves over there are not my subjects, nor should I cross the border. You must proceed by yourself.” Tripitaka became fearful; he stretched out his hands and clutched at the sleeves of the hunter, tears pouring from his eyes. It was at this tender moment of farewell that there came from beneath the mountain a thunderous voice crying, “My master has come! My master has come!” Tripitaka was dumbfounded, and Boqin trembled. We do not know who was crying; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.","Having learnt who he was, they ordered some food for him, but it was all human flesh boiled or fried. At the sight, the Master said he was a vegetarian. If he ate any of this meat he would never reach Paradise. He begged to be excused and rose to go. But the women would not let him go. They surrounded and bound him, thinking he would be a fine banquet for them the next day. Then seven of the women went out to bathe in a pool. Meanwhile Sun, in search of his Master, found them bathing and would have killed them, only he thought it was not right to kill women. So he changed himself into an eagle and carried away their clothes to his nest. This so frightened the women, that they crouched in the pool, and none dared come out. But Zhu Bajie, coming also in search of his Master, found the women bathing. He changed himself into a fish which the women tried to catch, chasing him hither and thither through the pool. Then Zhu Bajie came out of the pool and appeared in his true form, and threatened the women for having bound his Master. In their fright the women fled out of the pool into a pavilion, round which they spun spiders’ threads so thickly that Zhu Bajie became entangled and fell. Then they escaped to their cave and put on some clothes. When Zhu Bajie was able to disentangle himself from the webs, he saw Sun Wukong and Sha the Monk approach. When they heard what had happened, they feared the women might do some mischief to the Master, so they made for the cave to rescue him. But on the way, they were beset by the seven dwarf sons of the seven women, who transformed themselves into a swarm of dragonflies, bees, and other insects. Then Sun pulled out some hairs and, changing them into seven different swarms of flying insects, destroyed the hostile swarm, and the ground was covered a foot deep with the dead bodies. Then the pilgrims reached the cave, and found it deserted by the women. They unbound the Master, making him promise never to beg for food again.","That was a touch of adversity too far.” “I personally intervened with the Jade Emperor to have this dragon wait for you here to carry the scripture pilgrim west. Do you really think an ordinary Chinese horse can carry you all the way to the Buddha’s Soul Mountain?” “Well, we’ve not gotten off on the right foot and he’s too scared to come out. So what do I do now?” “Stand on the bank,” Guanyin instructed Monkey, “and shout: ‘Come out, Third Prince Jade Dragon, son of Aorun. Guanyin’s here to see you.’ That should do the trick.” After two such summonses, the little dragon leaped out of the water onto a cloud. “Thank you for saving my life,” he said, bowing to Guanyin. “But I’m still waiting for that pilgrim of yours to show up.” “Why, this is his senior disciple.” Guanyin gestured toward Monkey. “Him? But he’s my sworn enemy. Just because I got hungry and ate his horse yesterday, he’s been making my life hell. He never said a word about scriptures.”","Boqin told him about what the three of them had been told in their dreams, and Sanzang was happy too. Then they gave him his breakfast and an ounce of silver as an expression of their thanks, but he would not take a single penny of it, although the whole family begged and beseeched him to do so. “If in your mercy you could escort me for the next stage of my journey I would be deeply touched,” he said. All that Boqin, his mother, and his wife could do then was to prepare some scones of coarse wheaten flour as his provisions, and make sure that Boqin escorted him a long way. Sanzang gladly accepted the food. On his mother's orders the high warden told two or three servants to bring hunting gear as they set off together along the road. They saw no end of wild mountain scenery. When they had been travelling for some time they saw a mountain in front of them, a high and precipitous one that towered right up to the azure sky. Before long they had reached its base. The high warden climbed it as if he were walking on level ground, and when they were half-way over it he turned round, stood beside the path and said, “Venerable monk, I must ask you to take yourself on from here. I have to go back.” On hearing this Sanzang tumbled out of his saddle to say, “Please, please, take me another stage, High Warden.” “You don't seem to know that this is called Double Boundary Mountain,” said the high warden. The Eastern part belongs to our Great Tang, but the Western parts is Tatar territory. The tigers and wolves on that side are not subject to my control, which is why I can't cross the boundary. You mast go on by yourself. The monk was so alarmed to hear this that he waved his arms around and grabbed hold of the hunter's clothes and sleeves, weeping and refusing to let him go. When at last Sanzang was bowing repeatedly to the hunter to take his leave, a shout like thunder came from under the mountain: “My master's come, my master's come.” Sanzang stood frozen with fear at the sound of it, and Boqin had to hold him up. If you don't know who it was who shouted, listen to the explanation in the next installment."
只见那从者绑得痛切悲啼，那黑汉道：“此三者何来？”魔王道：“自送上门来者。”处士笑云：“可能待客否？”魔王道：“奉承！奉承！”山君道：“不可尽用，食其二，留其一可也。”魔王领诺，即呼左左，将二从者剖腹剜心，剁碎其尸，将首级与心肝奉献二客，将四肢自食，其余骨肉，分给各妖。只听得啯啅之声，真似虎啖羊羔，霎时食尽。把一个长老，几乎唬死。这才是初出长安第一场苦难。,"Seeing that the servant was tied and crying bitterly, the black man said: ""Where did these three come from?"" The devil said: ""The one who sent it to the door."" Flattery! Flattery!"" Shanjun said: ""You can't use it up, eat two of them, and keep one of them."" The demon king led the promise, and called Zuo Zuo, cut open the belly of the two servants to gouge out their hearts, chopped up their corpses, and chopped up their heads. Dedicating two guests with the heart and liver, the four limbs are eaten by themselves, and the rest of the flesh and bones are distributed to the demons. I can only hear the sound of chirping, it is like a tiger eating a lamb, and it is eaten up in an instant. Almost bluffed an elder to death. This was the first hardship when I first came out of Chang'an.","Meanwhile, one of Tripitaka’s attendants was bound so tightly that he began to moan pitifully. “How did these three get here?” asked the swarthy fellow. “They practically presented themselves at the door!” said the Monster King. “Can they be used for the guests’ dinner?” asked the Hermit, laughing. “By all means!” said the Monster King. “Let’s not finish them all up,” said the Mountain Lord. “We’ll dine on two of them and leave one over.” The Monster King agreed. He called his subordinates at once to have the attendants eviscerated and their carcasses carved up; their heads, hearts, and livers were to be presented to the guests, the limbs to the host, and the remaining portions of flesh and bone to the rest of the ogres. The moment the order was given, the ogres pounced on the attendants like tigers preying on sheep: munching and crunching, they devoured them in no time at all. The priest nearly died of fear, for this, you see, was his first bitter ordeal since his departure from Chang’an.","He then put the Magic Fan in his mouth and fought with his two swords. He was a match for Sun in all his magic arts, but Sun, being helped by Zhu Bajie and the local gods whom the Master had sent, proved himself stronger. The demon changed himself many times into a number of birds, but for each of these Sun was able to change himself into a swifter and stronger one. Then the demon changed himself into many beasts, such as tigers, leopards, bears, elephants, and an ox 10,000 feet long, then laughed and said to Sun, “What can you do to me now?” Sun took his steel club and cried out “Grow!” and suddenly he grew to be 100,000 feet high, with eyes like the sun and moon. They fought till the heavens and the earth shook with their onslaughts. When one’s virtue is one foot high, the Demon’s arts are ten thousand feet high in order to overcome virtue. If the flames of passions are to be put out, we must get the Magic Fan to cool our desires. When the will is not supreme, one must seek the help of the Supreme,","As you’ve a disciple, I’ll pass them on to you.” “Thank you, but I don’t think he’s coming back.” “Which way did he go?” the old woman asked. “Eastward, I think.” “I’m heading in that direction myself. I’ll catch up with him and tell him to return. I also happen to know a useful little rhyme: True Words for Controlling the Mind, which I sometimes shorten to the Tight Hoop Spell. Memorize it secretly and don’t tell it to another soul. Get him to put on the shirt and cap.","Sanzang's two attendants meanwhile were howling pitifully in their bonds. “How did those three get here?” asked the dark fellow. “They delivered themselves to the front door,” the demon king replied. “Will you be serving them to your friends?” asked the Hermit with a smile. “I should be honoured to,” answered the demon king. “We won't need them all,” remarked the Mountain Lord. “We could eat two and keep the third.” With a “na-a-aw” of obedience the demon king told his servants to cut open the two attendants, scoop their hearts out, and chop their bodies into mince. He presented the heads, hearts, and livers to his two guests, eating the limbs himself and dividing the rest of the flesh and bones among the fiends. All that could be heard was a crunching and a munching that sounded just like tigers devouring lambs, and in a few moments it had all been eaten up. Sanzang was almost dead with fright, yet this was only his first tribulation, coming so soon after leaving Chang'an."
富贵功名，前缘分定，为人切莫欺心。正大光明，忠良善果弥深。,"Wealth, honor, fame, predestined relationship, do not deceive people. Upright and bright, loyal and good fruit deep.","Beneath the Five Phases Mountain, Mind Monkey is still.1 Fame and fortune, All predestined; One must ever shun a guileful heart. Rectitude and truth, The fruits of virtue grow both long and deep.","WHEN THE GREAT SAGE WAS ESCORTED by the heavenly host to the new demon terrace, he was slung to a beam, but neither knife nor hatchet nor sword had touched his body.","The Heavenly executioners tied Monkey to the Demon-Defeating Pillar on top of the Demon Execution Block. There, they chopped him with a knife, minced him with a hatchet, stabbed him with a spear, and slashed him with a sword—all without the slightest effect.","Wealth and honour, glory and fame, Are predetermined by fate: No one should act against conscience to covet any of them. Far-going and deep Are the good results of true enlightenment and loyalty."
至次早，行者起来道：“师父，那庙祝老儿，昨晚许我们鞍辔，问他要，不要饶他。”说未了，只见那老儿，果擎着一副鞍辔、衬屉缰笼之类，凡马上一切用的，无不全备，放在廊下道：,"The next morning, the traveler got up and said, ""Master, the old man from the temple wished us a saddle and bridle last night, and asked him if he wanted to spare him."" After speaking, the old man was seen holding a saddle and bridle. Lining drawers, reins, etc., everything that is used immediately, all are fully prepared, and they are placed under the corridor and said:","Next morning, Pilgrim arose and said, “Master, that old caretaker promised last night to give us the harness. Ask him for it. Don’t spare him.” He had hardly finished speaking when the old man came in with a saddle, together with pads, reins, and the like. Not a single item needed for riding a horse was lacking.","Then they will suffer much from horny creatures in payment of their sins. Their flesh will feed men. They are lost forever into the lowest hell without hope of deliverance, on account of their wickedness. Although they have had Confucius in their continent, who established the teaching of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and knowledge, and have had a succession of rulers, who have imposed the punishments of banishment, of strangulation, and of beheading, they are still foolish.","Parting the grass with his staff, whom should he discover but his revered elder disciple sleep-babbling. “You idiot!” Sandy yanked hard on one of Pigsy’s large ears. “You’re meant to be begging food for Tripitaka, not napping your head off.”","When Monkey got up the next morning he said, “Master, that old sacristan promised us the saddle and bridle last night. You must insist and not let him off.” Before the words were out of his mouth, the old man appeared with the saddle and bridle in his hands, as well as saddle-cloth, saddle-pad, reins, muzzle and all the other trappings for a horse. Nothing was missing."
“你两人怎生捉得妖精？如何方救得我？”行者将那请灵吉降妖的事情，陈了一遍，师父谢之不尽。他兄弟们把洞中素物，安排些茶饭吃了，方才出门，找大路向西而去。毕竟不知向后如何，且听下回分解。,"""How did the two of you catch the goblin? How can you save me?"" The walker explained the matter of asking Lingji to subdue the demon, and the master thanked him endlessly. His brothers took the food in the cave and arranged some tea and rice to eat, and just then went out and found the road to the west. After all, I don't know how to go backwards, let's listen to the next decomposition.","Then they went to the garden in the back to rescue their master, who, after coming out, asked, “How did you two manage to catch the monster so that you could rescue me?” Pilgrim gave a thorough account of how he went to seek the Bodhisattva’s help to subdue the monster, and the master thanked him profusely. Then the two brothers found some vegetarian food in the cave, which they prepared along with some tea and rice. After eating, they left and again found the road to the West. We do not know what took place hereafter; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.",,"“Live a little, why not?” Wiping his tears away, Tripitaka did his best to smile and stepped into the carriage, which set off back to the east wing of the palace, where the royal couple was greeted by a choir of pipes and strings, two lines of beautiful palace women, and a sumptuous banquet. The queen toasted her guests with a jade cupful of wine; Monkey threw Tripitaka a look, to signify that he should return the compliment. The ceremonials completed, the music stopped and Pigsy welcomed the banquet into his stomach: corn, steamed bread, cakes, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, cabbage, seaweed, turnips, and yams, all washed down with half a dozen cups of wine. “More food, more wine, quickly!”","When he was outside he asked, “How did you two capture that evil spirit? How did you manage to rescue me?” Monkey told him all about how Lingji had subdued the fined, and Sanzang expressed his gratitude at great length while the two prepared a meal from the meatless food that there was in the cave. Then they left the cave and looked for the main path West once more. If you don't know what happened later, listen to the explanation in the next installment."
那个伤心难忍辱。钯来杖架逞英雄，水滚流沙能恶毒。气昂昂，劳碌碌，多因三藏朝西域。钉钯老大凶，宝杖十分熟。这个揪住要往岸上拖，那个抓来就将水里沃。声如霹雳动鱼龙，云暗天昏神鬼伏。这一场，来来往往，斗经三十回合，不见强弱。八戒又使个佯输计，拖了钯走。那怪随后又赶来，拥波捉浪，赶至崖边。八戒骂道：“我把你这个泼怪！你上来！这高处，脚踏实地好打！”那妖骂道：“你这厮哄我上去，又教那帮手来哩。你下来，还在水里相斗。”原来那妖乖了，再不肯上岸，只在河沿与八戒闹吵。,"That sadness is unbearable. Palladium comes to the rod to be a hero, and water and quicksand can be vicious. Excited and toiled, mostly because of the Three Tibetans heading towards the Western Regions. The boss of Nail Palladium is fierce, and the staff is very familiar. This one will be dragged to the shore, and the other will be fertile. The sound is like a thunderbolt moving a fish and dragon, and the clouds are dark and the sky is faint. In this battle, it came and went, after 30 rounds of fighting, no strength or weakness was seen. Bajie made another feint and dragged Palladium away. The monster came later, caught the waves, and rushed to the edge of the cliff. Bajie scolded: ""I'll throw you a monster! Come up! It's easy to fight in this high place!"" The monster scolded: ""You coax me up, and teach the helpers to come. You come down, and you're still here. Fight in the water."" It turned out that the demon was obedient and refused to go ashore again, only arguing with Bajie on the riverside.","That one found unbearable his pain. Rake and staff went back and forth to show their might; The water rotted like poison in Flowing-Sand. They huffed and puffed! They worked and toiled! All because Tripitaka would face the West. The muckrake so ferocious! The staff so nimbly used! This one made a grab to pull him up the shore; That one sought to seize and drown him in the stream. They roared like thunder, stirring dragon and fish. Gods and ghosts cowered as the Heavens grew dim. This time they fought back and forth for thirty rounds, and neither one proved to be the stronger. Again Eight Rules pretended to be defeated and fled, dragging his rake. Kicking up the waves, the monster gave chase and they reached the edge of the river. “Wretch!” cried Eight Rules. “Come up here! We can fight better on solid ground up here.” “You are just trying to trick me into going up there,” scolded the monster, “so that you can bring out your assistant. You come down here, and we can fight in the water.” The monster, you see, had become wise; he refused to go up to the bank and remained near the edge of the water to argue with Eight Rules.",,"Monkey grinned. “Nothing wrong with you, is there?” asked Orionis. “I was stung yesterday. Though the pain’s gone, my scalp’s still a bit itchy. I’m worried it might flare up when the weather turns damp.” Orionis performed the same service on Monkey, and the itch disappeared. Fully recovered, Pigsy now turned ferocious. “Let’s go and settle that hussy’s hash.” “Good idea,” agreed the star god. “You two draw her out of the cave, and I’ll finish her off.” Monkey and Pigsy bounded back up the mountain. In no time at all, and shouting filthy abuse all the while, Pigsy had cleared the rocks piled up at the entrance to the cave. The little fiends announced the bad news to their mistress just as she was about to untie Tripitaka to feed him some tea and rice. She charged at Pigsy and Monkey with her trident; guessing that she might be about to deploy her sting a third time, the two pilgrims fled—with the fiend in hot pursuit—down the side of the mountain where Orionis stood waiting in his true form: a seven-foot, double-combed rooster.","As the staff parried the rake's blows, they showed their prowess; Each was most vicious as the Flowing Sands River rolled. Towering rage, Strenuous efforts, All because Sanzang wanted to go West. The rake was thoroughly murderous, The staff was wielded with experience. Pig grabbed his enemy, trying to drag him ashore, While the other in torn tried to pull Pig under water. The thunderous noise disturbed fish and dragons; Gods and ghosts lay low as the sky was darkened. The battle went on for thirty rounds, but neither emerged victorious. Pig feigned defeat once again, and fled trailing his rake behind him. The ogre charged through the waves after him as far as the bank, when Pig shouted at him, “I'll get you, you damned ogre. Come up on this higher ground where we can fight with dry land under our feet.” “You're trying to lure me up there, damn you,” the monster replied, “for your mate to come and get me. Come back and fight in the water.” The fiend, who had more sense than to go up the bank again, stood at the river's edge, shouting it out with Pig."
却说那五十个败残的小妖，拿着些破旗破鼓，撞入洞里，报道：“大王，虎先锋战不过那毛脸和尚，被他赶下东山坡去了。”老妖闻说，十分烦恼，正低头不语，默思计策，又有把前门的小妖道：“大王，虎先锋被那毛脸和尚打杀了，拖在门口骂战哩。”那老妖闻言，愈加烦恼道：“这厮却也无知！我倒不曾吃他师父，他转打杀我家先锋，可恨！可恨！”叫：“取披挂来。我也只闻得讲甚么孙行者，等我出去，看是个甚么九头八尾的和尚，拿他进来，与我虎先锋对命。”众小妖急急抬出披挂。老妖结束齐整，绰一杆三股钢叉，帅群妖跳出本洞。那大圣停立门外，见那怪走将出来，着实骁勇。看他怎生打扮，但见：金盔晃日，金甲凝光。盔上缨飘山雉尾，罗袍罩甲淡鹅黄。勒甲绦盘龙耀彩，护心镜绕眼辉煌。鹿皮靴，槐花染色；锦围裙，柳叶绒妆。手持三股钢叉利，不亚当年显圣郎。,"But he said that the fifty defeated little demons, with some broken flags and drums, crashed into the hole and reported: ""Your Majesty, the tiger pioneer couldn't defeat the Mao-faced monk, and he was driven down the east hill by him."" Wen said, very annoyed, he was bowing his head silently, pondering a plan, and then the little demon who held the front door said: ""Your Majesty, Tiger Pioneer was beaten to death by that hairy-faced monk, dragged to the door to scold and fight."" That old demon heard Yan, became more annoyed and said: ""This fellow is ignorant! I have never eaten his master, he turned to kill my pioneer, hateful! Hateful!"" He shouted: ""Take the robe. I only heard about Sun Xingzhe, etc. I'll go out and see what kind of monk with nine heads and eight tails it is, bring him in and fight against my tiger pioneer."" The little demons hurriedly took off their cloaks. The old demon finished neatly, with a three-strand steel fork, and the handsome group of demons jumped out of the hole. The great sage stopped outside the door and saw that the monster was about to come out. He was really brave. See how he dresses up, but see: the golden helmet shines in the sun, and the golden armor condenses. The tail of the pheasant floats on the helmet, and the robe is pale yellow. The armor and sash are covered with dazzling colors, and the goggles around the eyes are brilliant. Moccasin boots, dyed with locust flowers; brocade apron, willow velvet makeup. Holding a three-strand steel fork, he will not be the saint of the year.","We shall now tell about those fifty defeated little demons, who rushed into the cave carrying their broken drums and torn banners. “Great King,” they cried, “the Tiger Vanguard was no match for the hairy-faced monk. That monk chased him down the eastern slope until the Vanguard disappeared.” When the old monster heard this, he was terribly upset. As he bowed his head in silent deliberation, another little demon who stood guard at the door came to report, “Great King, the Tiger Vanguard was beaten to death by the hairy-faced monk and dragged up to our door to provoke battle.” Hearing this, the old monster became even angrier. “This fellow does not know when to stop!” he said. “I have not eaten his master, but he has killed our Vanguard instead. How insolent!” Whereupon he bellowed, “Bring me my armor. I have heard only rumors about this Pilgrim Sun, and I’m going out there to find out what sort of monk he really is. Even if he has nine heads and eight tails, I’m going to take him in here to pay for the life of my Tiger Vanguard!” The little demons quickly brought out the armor. After having been properly buckled and laced, the old monster took a steel trident and leaped out of the cave, leading the rest of the demons. Standing in front of the door, the Great Sage watched the monster emerge with a truly aggressive appearance. Look how he is attired. You see Gold helmet reflecting the sun; Gold cuirass gleaming with light. A pheasant-tail tassel flies from the helmet; A light yellow silk robe topped by the cuirass, Tied with a dragonlike sash of brilliant hues. His breastplate emits eye-dazzling light. His boots of suede Are dyed by locust flowers. His embroidered kilt Is decked with willow leaves. Holding a sharp trident in his hands, He seems almost the Erlang2 Boy of old!",,"As bad luck would have it, the travelers presently came to another river, though fortunately this one was a good deal narrower than the previous one. Tripitaka spotted some distance away a few thatched huts beneath the shade of some jade-green weeping willows. “Surely there’ll be a boat over there,” speculated Monkey. Pigsy decided to take the initiative. “Hey!” he hollered. “Boat needed! Over here!” Out from beneath one of the willows creaked a brightly painted paddleboat. As it approached the stretch of bank where the pilgrims were standing, Tripitaka realized it was being rowed by an old woman dressed in black silk shoes, a patched coat, and a grubby skirt. “Hop on,” she told the pilgrims. “Are you in charge of this boat?” Monkey asked. “Where’s the ferryman?” The woman merely smiled and pulled out the gangplank. Sandy carried the luggage on, Monkey helped Tripitaka embark, and Pigsy led the horse into the boat, taking up the plank after everyone was in. The woman then rowed the boat quickly across the river.","The fifty petty devils fled routed into the cave, their banners and drums smashed, to report, “Your Majesty, the Tiger of the Vanguard is no match for the hairy-faced monk, who chased him down the mountain.” The old fiend was very angry at the news, and he sat silent with his head bowed as he thought over what to do. Then the petty demons from the gate came in to announce, “Your Majesty, the hairy-faced monk has killed the Tiger of the Vanguard and dragged his body to the gates, where he's insulting us to provoke us to fight.” The old fiend was angrier than ever when he heard this, and he said, “This wretch doesn't know what he's doing, killing my Commander of the Vanguard although I haven't eaten his master. Hateful beast. Bring my armour. I've heard of this Brother Monkey, and now I think I'll go out to have a look at this nine-headed, eight-tailed monk. I'll capture him to avenge my Tiger of the Vanguard.” The junior devils brought the armour as fast as they could, and when the old fiend had put it all on properly, he took his steel trident and led his devilish host out of the cave. He was full of martial dignity as he came out, and you can see how he was equipped: His golden helmet shone in the sun, And light was reflected from his golden armour. A pheasant's tail floated above his helmet, And the thin silk robe over his armour was pale goose-yellow. The belt that girded his armour was dragon-brilliant; His shining breastplate dazzled the eye. His deerskin boots Were the color of locust-tree blossom; His brocade kilt Was patterned with willow leaves. With a sharp steel trident in his hand, He was no less awesome than the Little Sage Erlang."
收来成一担，行歌市上，易米三升。更无些子争竞，时价平平，不会机谋巧算，没荣辱，恬淡延生。相逢处，非仙即道，静坐讲黄庭。”美猴王听得此言，满心欢喜道：“神仙原来藏在这里！”急忙跳入里面，仔细再看，乃是一个樵子，在那里举斧砍柴。但看他打扮非常：,"Harvested into a load, Xingge market, Yimi three liters. There is no competition, the price is flat, there is no clever calculation, there is no honor or disgrace, and the life is peaceful. Wherever they meet, if they are not immortals, they will be the Tao. When the Monkey King heard this, he was full of joy and said, ""The immortals are hiding here! ""I hurriedly jumped into it and looked carefully, it was a woodcutter, who was chopping wood with an axe. But he was dressed very well:","When I gather enough to make a load, I stroll singing through the marketplace And trade it for three pints of rice, With nary the slightest bickering Over a price so modest. Plots and schemes I do not know; Without vainglory or attaint My life’s prolonged in simplicity. Those I meet, If not immortals, would be Daoists, Seated quietly to expound the Yellow Court. When the Handsome Monkey King heard this, he was filled with delight, saying, “So the immortals are hiding in this place.” He leaped at once into the forest. Looking again carefully, he found a woodcutter chopping firewood with his ax. The man he saw was very strangely attired.","A bundle make of all my lot, Then sing away on road to mart. I buy my pints of daily rice, And then, why grudge I have no more? My price is fair, my price is fair. Why should I worry to increase My fame or shame? Quite calm I live,","I trade my load for wine and rice, and never haggle over the price. Living without ambition or conceit, only immortals and Taoists will I meet. “At last!” the monkey king rejoiced to himself. Skipping through the forest, he came face-to-face with a woodcutter busy at work, dressed in a large conical hat made of young bamboo, a cotton-gauze tunic with a silk sash, and straw sandals.","When I've gathered a basketful I walk down to the market with a song, And trade it for three pints of rice. Nobody else competes with me, So prices are stable. I don't speculate or try sharp practice, Couldn't care less what people think of me, Calmly lengthening my days. The people I meet Are Taoists and Immortals, Sitting quietly and expounding the Yellow Court.” The Monkey King was overjoyed to hear this, and he said with glee, “So this is where the Immortals have been hiding.” He bounded deeper into the woods for a closer look and saw that the singer was a woodcutter cutting firewood. He was wearing the most unusual clothes:"
这猴王拽开步，跳到涧边，使出那翻江搅海的神通，把一条鹰愁陡涧彻底澄清的水，搅得似那九曲黄河泛涨的波。那孽龙在于深涧中，坐卧宁，心中思想道：“这才是福无双降，祸不单行。我才脱了天条死难，不上一年，在此随缘度日，又撞着这般个泼魔，他来害我！”你看他越思越恼，受不得屈气，咬着牙，跳将出去，骂道：“你是那里来的泼魔，这等欺我！”行者道：“你莫管我那里不那里，你只还了马，我就饶你性命！”那龙道：“你的马是我吞下肚去，如何吐得出来！不还你，便待怎的！”行者道“不还马时看棍！只打杀你，偿了我马的性命便罢！”他两个又在那山崖下苦斗。斗不数合，小龙委实难搪，将身一幌，变作一条水蛇儿，钻入草科中去了。,"The Monkey King pulled away, jumped to the edge of the stream, and used the supernatural power of turning the river and the sea, stirring the water that was completely clear in the eagle's steep brook to be like the swollen waves of the nine-curved Yellow River. The evil dragon lies in the deep stream, sitting and lying peacefully, thinking in his heart: ""This is the only way for blessings to come unparalleled, and misfortunes to come singly. I just got rid of the heavens and died. Splash Demon, he is here to harm me!"" You see, the more he thought about it, the more annoyed he became, unable to bear his anger, he gritted his teeth, jumped out, and scolded, ""You are the Splash Demon from there, you are bullying me!"" ""You don't care where I am or not, you only return the horse, and I will spare your life!"" Na Long said: ""I swallowed your horse, how can I spit it out! Yes!"" The traveler said, ""Look at the stick when you don't return the horse! Just kill you and pay my horse's life!"" The two of them fought hard under the cliff again. The fight is too close, and the little dragon is really hard to persevere. It turns into a water snake and burrows into the grass family.","With great leaps, our Monkey King bounded right to the edge of the stream. Using his magic of overturning seas and rivers, he transformed the clear, limpid water of the Eagle Grief Stream into the muddy currents of the Yellow River during high tide. The cursed dragon in the depth of the stream could neither sit nor lie still for a single moment. He thought to himself: “Just as ‘Blessing never repeats itself, so misfortune never comes singly!’ It has been barely a year since I escaped execution by Heaven and came to bide my time here, but now I have to run into this wretched monster who is trying to do me harm.” Look at him! The more he thought about the matter, the more irritated he became. Unable to bear it any longer, he gritted his teeth and leaped out of the water, crying, “What kind of monster are you, and where do you come from, that you want to oppress me like this?” “Never mind where I come from,” said Pilgrim. “Just return the horse, and I’ll spare your life.” “I’ve swallowed your horse into my stomach,” said the dragon, “so how am I to throw it up? What are you going to do if I can’t return it to you?” Pilgrim said, “If you don’t give back the horse, just watch for this rod. Only when your life becomes a payment for my horse will there be an end to this matter!” The two of them again waged a bitter struggle below the mountain ridge. After a few rounds, however, the little dragon just could not hold out any longer; shaking his body, he changed himself into a tiny water snake and wriggled into the marshes.","She said she feared to see the frightful faces of his disciples. And so it was arranged that they should go before daylight. The Master was greatly alarmed at this. But Sun, plucking a hair, made a false Sun and let that one proceed with the other two disciples, whilst he himself remained to watch over his Master. At night he flew, as a bee, to his Master’s side, “Do not be alarmed, I am with you!” When the princess appeared the next day for her marriage, Sun at once recognised her as a witch, and attacked her in the midst of the court. She in turn appeared in her true form, threw away all her royal garments and jewels, and took up a club, and fought with Sun in the air. She fled away, and he followed her, till she disappeared in a cave. But he found her in one of the caves and fought her again, and was pressing her hard, when the Minister of the Yin Star appeared, and begged Sun to spare her life for his sake. He then related the story of the true princess. She had been a rabbit fairy in one of the Heavenly Mansions twenty years before, and had boxed the ears of one of her companions. After this, to save herself from revenge, she decided to go down to earth, and entered the womb of a queen. The insulted fairy had never forgotten her treatment, and a year before had carried her enemy off in the wind, and taken her place in the palace.","And if I ate that rice of yours, wouldn’t your husband scold you?” The girl laid it on even thicker. “When it comes to piety, my parents are mere dabblers compared with my husband. He’s forever building bridges, repairing roads, and caring for the old and needy. When he hears that I gave his rice to a Buddhist monk, he’ll love me more than ever.” Still, Tripitaka wouldn’t touch the rice—to Pigsy’s exasperation. Ditherer! Pigsy thought furiously, pouting. A ready-to-eat meal with its own delectable delivery service, and he won’t touch it. If we wait much longer, that monkey will come back and we’ll have to divide it among the four of us. Just as Pigsy was about to bury his snout in the pot, Monkey somersaulted back to the group, the alms bowl filled with freshly picked peaches, and instantly recognized the girl for the monster she was. He put the bowl down and was about to smash her hard on the head when Tripitaka pulled him back, appalled. “This woman’s a fiend in disguise,” Monkey explained. “She’s come to trick you.” “Nonsense!” objected Tripitaka. “She’s our benefactor—she’s brought us food.”","and then we'll see who comes out on top.” The Monkey King leapt to the edge of the ravine, and used a magical way of throwing rivers and seas into turmoil to make the clear waters at the bottom of the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge as turbulent as the waves of the Yellow River in spate. The evil dragon's peace was disturbed as he lurked in the depths of the waters, and he thought, “How true it is that blessings never come in pairs and troubles never come singly. Although I've been accepting my fate here for less than a year since I escaped the death penalty for breaking the laws of Heaven, I would have to run into this murderous devil.” The more he thought about it, the angrier he felt, and unable to bear the humiliation a moment longer he jumped out of the stream cursing, “Where are you from, you bloody devil, coming here to push me around?” “Never you mind where I'm from,” Monkey replied. “I'll only spare your life if you give back that horse.” “That horse of yours is in my stomach, and I can't sick it up again, can I? I'm not giving it back, so what about it?” “If you won't give it back, then take this! I'm only killing you to make you pay for the horse's life.” The two of them began another bitter struggle under the mountain, and before many rounds were up the little dragon could hold out no longer. With a shake of his body he turned himself into a water-snake and slithered into the undergrowth."
那院主献了茶，又安排斋供。天光尚早，三藏称谢未毕，只见那后面有两个小童，搀着一个老僧出来。看他怎生打扮：头上戴一顶毗卢方帽，猫睛石的宝顶光辉；身上穿一领锦绒褊衫，翡翠毛的金边晃亮。一对僧鞋攒八宝，一根拄杖嵌云星。满面皱痕，好似骊山老母；一双昏眼，却如东海龙君。口不关风因齿落，腰驼背屈为筋挛。众僧道：“师祖来了。”三藏躬身施礼迎接道：“老院主，弟子拜揖。”那老僧还了礼，又各叙坐。老僧道：,"The head of the house offered tea and arranged for fast offerings. It was still early in the sky, and Sanzang had not finished thanking him, but there were two little boys behind him, who came out with an old monk. Let's see how he dresses up: he wears a Pilu square hat on his head, the top of the cat's eye stone is brilliant; he wears a brocade velvet shirt on his body, and the golden edge of the emerald hair shines brightly. A pair of monk shoes hold the Eight Treasures, and a cane is embedded with cloud stars. The face is full of wrinkles, like an old mother Lishan; a pair of dizzy eyes, but like a dragon in the East China Sea. When the mouth is not closed, the wind is due to the teeth falling, and the hunchback and dorsiflexion are tendon spasms. All the monks said, ""The master is here."" Sanzang bowed and greeted him, ""Old master of the house, the disciples bow."" The old monk returned the salute and sat down again. The old monk said:","After serving tea, the abbot prepared a vegetarian meal, although it was still rather early for dinner. Tripitaka had not finished thanking him when an old monk emerged from the rear, supported by two boys. Look how he was attired: He wore on his head a Vairocana hat Topped by a precious, shining cat’s-eye stone; He wore on his body a brocaded woolen frock, Piped brilliantly in gold and kingfisher feathers. A pair of monk shoes on which Eight Treasures were set, And a priestly staff encased with starry gems. His face full of wrinkles, He looked like the Old Witch of Li Mountain; His eyes were dim-sighted, Though he seemed a Dragon King of the Eastern Ocean. Wind stabbed his mouth for his teeth had fallen, And palsy had made crooked his aged back. The various monks made the announcement: “The Patriarch is here.” Tripitaka bowed to receive him, saying, “Old Abbot, your disciple bows to you.” The old monk returned the gesture, and they were both seated.",,"I won’t be so easy on you a second time!” Enormously relieved, Pigsy and Sandy gathered up the horse and luggage, scurried to the back of the cave, scooped Tripitaka onto the horse, and ran away as fast as they could. Proceeding along a main road, the two disciples bickered relentlessly, each blaming the other for the Yellow-Robe catastrophe, with Tripitaka trying to keep the peace. After two hundred and ninety-nine ill-tempered miles, the beautiful city-state of Precious Image rose up before them, its formidable walls set amid high, forested mountains and neatly farmed fields. Music—chimes, drums, pipes, and flutes—floated up from its many towers and palaces. The city’s thoroughfares teemed with chariots and vigorous, well-dressed youths. The scene more than compared with the finest cities of China; Tripitaka’s heart almost burst with homesickness. After lodging his disciples, horse, and luggage in a posthouse, Tripitaka made his way to court and requested an audience with the king, for the purposes of having their travel documents stamped. Delighted by the news of a visitor from an empire as great as the Tang, the king immediately summoned Tripitaka into his presence. “Exquisite!” the courtiers exclaimed at Tripitaka’s elaborate rituals of homage to the king.","The abbot gave them tea and arranged for food to be brought, and after the meal it was still early. As Sanzang was expressing his thanks, two servant boys appeared behind them supporting an aged monk. This is what he looked like: A Vairocana miter on his head Topped with a gleaming cat's-eye jewel. On his body a gown of brocade, Edged with gold-mounted kingfisher feathers. A pair of monkish shoes studded with the Eight Treasures, A walking stick inlaid with Clouds and stars. A face covered with wrinkles, Like the Old Goddess of Mount Li; A pair of purblind eyes, Like the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea. His mouth can't keep out the wind as his teeth have gone; His back is bent because his muscles are stiff. “The Patriarch has come,” the monks all said. Sanzang bowed low to him in greeting and said, “Your disciple pays his respects, venerable abbot.” The aged monk returned his greeting and they both sat down."
“他说我和你做了夫妻，你是他门下一个女婿，全没些儿礼体。,"""He said that I was married to you, and that you were his son-in-law, so there was no manners at all.","Pilgrim said, “They said that since we have become husband and wife, you are in fact a son-in-law in their family but one who is completely without manners.",,“Attacking their own fathers!”,"“They said that since we married and you became their resident son-in-law, all respectability has gone by the board."

Calling brothers and brothers to invite shipmates, and friends to gather together with friends. The orders to guess boxing are frequently handed over, and the words of the demolition of cards are passed on. Cooked shrimp and boiled crabs are happy, fried duck and chicken are prosperous every day. The Fool's Wife's love for sencha is scattered, and the Shan's wife makes meals calmly. Xiaolai raises his stick to scour the light waves, and the sun rises too much to carry firewood. Catch the live carp with minnows after the rain, and cut down withered pine with an axe before the wind. Hidden from the world makeup is stupid, incognito is deaf. ""Zhang Shao said: ""Brother Li, I just started the sentence first. Now that I come to my brother, I will also start a couplet first, and my younger brother should continue it."" """" Fengyue pretends to be a wild man in the mountains, and the rivers and lakes are proud of the old Yu Ding. Leisure and dashing, with no tongue in sight, hi peace. On the moonlit night, the body sleeps in the thatched hut, and when the sky is dizzy, the body is lightly covered. Forgetting to meet Songmei friends, I am willing to meet Ou Lumeng. Fame and fortune have no plans in mind, and there is no sound in the ears of fighting. Have a sip of mashed wine at any time, and spend three meals a day with wild vegetable soup. Two bundles of firewood are for work, and a fishing line is for living. Silently calling the child to sharpen the steel axe, and quietly calling for the Han'er to mend the old one. When spring arrives, I like to see willow green, and Shi Rong likes to see dilu green. Hsinchu is cultivated in summer, and tender lings are picked in the cool of June. Shuangjiang chicken fat is slaughtered every day, and Chongyang crabs are cooked in time. In winter, the sun is still sleeping, counting nine days without steaming.","I sing and freely pour on my heart’s desire; In songs and sighs there’s none to restrain me. I call fellow boatmen to come as brothers; With friends we join the codgers of the wilds. We make rules, play games, and exchange the cups; We break words, remake them, when we pass the mugs. Cooked shrimps, boiled crabs are my daily feasts; I’m daily fed by smoked fowls and fried ducks. My unlettered wife makes tea languidly; My mountain wife cooks rice most leisurely. When dawn comes, I lift my staff to stir the waves; At sunrise I pole my wood to cross big roads. I don coir coat after rain to catch live carps; Wind-blown I wield my ax to cut dried pines. Hiding tracks to flee the world, I’m like a fool; Blotting name and surname, I play deaf and dumb. Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, just now I presumed to take the lead and began with the first line of the poem. Why don’t you begin this time and I shall follow you.” A rustic who feigns to be romantic; An oldie taking pride in streams and lakes. My lot is leisure, I seek laxity and ease. Shunning talk and gossip, I love my peace. In moonlit nights I sleep in safe straw huts; When sky dims I’m draped with light coir cape. I befriend with ardor both pines and plums; I’m pleased to mingle with egrets and gulls. My mind has no plans for fortune or fame; My ears are deaf to the din of spear and drum. At any time I’d pour my fragrant wine; My day’s three meals are soups of leafy greens. My living rests on two bundles of wood; My trade is my pole fit with hooks and lines. I call our young son to sharpen my ax; I tell my small rogue he should mend our nets. Spring comes, I love to watch the willows green; Warm days gladden the sight of rushes and reeds. To flee summer’s heat I plant new bamboos; I pick young lotus to cool myself in June. When Frost Descends the fatted fowls are slain; By Double Ninth11 I’d cook the roe-filled crabs. I sleep deep in winter though the sun is high; When the sky’s tall and hazy, I’d not fry!","And to the tree of nature. Recognize no traitor as friend, Follow no artificial rules Lest you be deceived. Strike hard with your fist, But without malice. The apparent method is not real, The light of sun and of moon, Wherein lies their difference? Having traveled on, they came to a village where they sought lodgings, but the people were greatly frightened at the sight of Zhu Bajie with his long snout and flapping ears. So Sun advised him to hide his snout in his bosom and fasten his ears, to prevent them flapping. Food was served them, and the Master asked a blessing. Zhu Bajie ate ravenously. The host’s name was Wang and he said, “Before you there is a great mountain 800 li to cross. You should be well armed, as the mountain is full of robbers and demons.” They started West again, but had not gone far when a terrible storm arose, which blew the Master from his horse, and a tiger came rushing on him. Zhu Bajie took his nine pronged spear and said, “Come on, I will soon finish you.”","One would praise seagulls and crabs; the other craggy peaks and mountain tea. Finally, the mountain lover, one Li Ding, made a more practical point about life on the river.","Singing and musing to myself I'm as wild as I care to be; Long songs, long sighs, I can let myself be crazy. I invite my brothers and cousins and fellow boatmen; Leading my friends by the hand I meet the old man of the wilds. As we play guess-fingers the cups fly fast; When we make riddles the goblets slowly circulate. Saute or boiled crab is a delight every morning; Plenty of fried duck and chicken cooked in ashes every day. As my simple wife brews tea, my spirits are untrammelled; While my mountain spouse cooks supper, my mind is at ease. At the coming of dawn I wash my stick in the ripples; When the sun rises I carry firewood across the road. After the rain I put on my cloak to catch live carp; I wield my axe before the wind to fell a withered pine. I cover my tracks and hide from the world, acting the imbecile; I change my name and pretend to be deaf and dumb. “Brother Li,” said Zhang Shao. “I unfairly took the first lines just now, so now it's your turn to compose the first lines while I follow you.” Thus they continued: The man of the mountains acting mad under wind and moon; The haughty and unwanted dotard of the river. With his share of idleness, and able to be quite free; No sound from his voice as he revels in his peace. On moonlit nights he sleeps secure in a cottage of thatch; He lightly covers himself at dusk with clothes of reed. His passion spent, he befriends the pine and the plum; He is happy to be the companion of cormorant and gull. Fame and profit count for nothing in his mind; His ears have never heard the clash of arms. One is always pouring out fresh rice-wine, The other has wild vegetable soup with every meal. One makes a living with two bundles of firewood; The other supports himself with rod and line. One idly tells his innocent son to sharpen the axe of steel; The other quietly bids his slow-witted child to mend the nets. In spring one likes to see the willows turning green; When the seasons change the other enjoys the rushes' blue. Avoiding the summer heat, one trims the new bamboo; The other gathers water-chestnuts on cool July evenings. When frost begins, plump chickens are killed each day; In mid-autumn the crabs are at their best and always in the pot. When the sun rises in winter, the one is still asleep; The other keeps cool in the dog days of summer."

大天尊宣众文武仙卿，问曰：“这妖猴是几年生育，何代出生，却就这般有道？”一言未已，班中闪出千里眼、顺风耳道：“这猴乃三百年前天产石猴。当时不以为然，不知这几年在何方修炼成仙，降龙伏虎，强销死籍也。”玉帝道：“那路神将下界收伏？”言未已，班中闪出太白长庚星，俯首启奏道：“上圣三界中，凡有九窍者，皆可修仙。奈此猴乃天地育成之体，日月孕就之身，他也顶天履地，服露餐霞；今既修成仙道，有降龙伏虎之能，与人何以异哉？臣启陛下，可念生化之慈恩，降一道招安圣旨，把他宣来上届，授他一个大小官职，与他籍名在箓，拘束此间，若受天命，后再升赏；若违天命，就此擒拿。一则不动众劳师，二则收仙有道也。”玉帝闻言甚喜，道：“依卿所奏。”即着文曲星官修诏，着太白金星招安。,"The Great Heavenly Venerate declared to the congregation of civil and military immortals, and asked, ""How many years did this demon monkey give birth, and what generation was born, but it is so wise?"" Three hundred years ago, natural stone monkeys were born. At that time, I didn’t think so. I don’t know where I have cultivated and become immortals in the past few years. He came out of the Taibai Changgeng Star, bowed his head and said: ""In the Three Realms of the Supreme Sage, anyone with nine orifices can cultivate immortals. However, this monkey is a body bred by heaven and earth, and a body conceived by the sun and the moon. Lu Shanxia; now that you have cultivated the way of immortality, and have the ability to subdue dragons and tigers, how can you be different from others? Your Majesty, Chen Qi, can recite the kindness of life and change, and send down an imperial edict to announce him to the previous session, grant him a large or small official position, and share with him. The name of the family is in the husk, and it is bound here. If you are ordered by heaven, you will be rewarded later; if you violate the order of heaven, you will be captured here. One will not move the teachers, and the other will accept the immortals."" The Jade Emperor was very happy when he heard this, and said: "" According to Qing's performance."" That is to say, Wenqu Xingguan Xiu Zhao, Taibaijinxing Zhao'an.","The Great Heavenly Deva called together his various immortal subjects, both civil and military, and asked, “When was this baneful monkey born, and in which generation did he begin his career? How is it that he has become so powerfully accomplished in the Way?” Scarcely had he finished speaking when, from the ranks, Thousand-Mile Eye and Fair-Wind Ear stepped forward. “This monkey,” they said, “is the Heaven-born stone monkey of three hundred years ago. At that time he did not seem to amount to much, and we do not know where he acquired the knowledge of self-cultivation these last few years and became an immortal. Now he knows how to subdue dragons and tame tigers,9 and thus he is able to annul by force the Register of Death.” “Which one of you divine generals,” asked the Jade Emperor, “wishes to go down there to subdue him?” Scarcely had he finished speaking when the Long-Life Spirit of the Planet Venus came forward from the ranks and prostrated himself. “Highest and Holiest,” he said, “within the three regions, all creatures endowed with the nine apertures can, through exercise, become immortals. It is not surprising that this monkey, with a body nurtured by Heaven and Earth, a frame born of the sun and moon, should achieve immortality, seeing that his head points to Heaven and his feet walk on Earth, and that he feeds on the dew and the mist. Now that he has the power to subdue dragons and tame tigers, how is he different from a human being? Your subject therefore makes so bold as to ask Your Majesty to remember the compassionate grace of Creation and issue a decree of pacification. Let him be summoned to the Upper Region and given some kind of official duties. His name will be recorded in the Register and we can control him here. If he is receptive to the Heavenly decree, he will be rewarded and promoted hereafter; but if he is disobedient to your command, we shall arrest him forthwith. Such an action will spare us a military expedition in the first place, and, in the second, permit us to receive into our midst another immortal in an orderly manner.” The Jade Emperor was highly pleased with this statement, and he said, “We shall follow the counsel of our minister.” He then ordered the Star Spirit of Songs and Letters to compose the decree, and delegated the Gold Star of Venus to be the viceroy of peace.","The Jade Emperor then asked all the civil and military ministers of heaven when this monkey monster was born and in what age he appeared, for there must have been some reason for his appearance. One of the ministers in the company replied, “This monkey was born 300 years ago. Nature gave birth to a stone monkey. At that time there was no special notice taken of him. But we do not know how he discovered during these years the way to become an Immortal, able to subdue dragons and demons and to take the Register of Life and Death by force.” The Jade Emperor said, “Let the gods of that region go down and subdue him.” Before he had finished his commands, the Minister of Venus appeared, bowed down, and said, “Your Majesty, all who have complete mental powers in the three realms may become Immortals if they practice the art. This monkey is a product of Nature, begotten by the sun and moon. Since he has now become indestructible and can subdue dragons and demons, perhaps he can be reasoned with like a human. Your minister suggests that you be merciful, and issue an edict to call him to a peaceful audience. Let him come to the upper world, and confer on him some official position to look after something. If he is loyal, then let him have a rise. If he is disloyal, then arrest him. In this way you will not need to trouble many legions to go after him.” The Jade Emperor was very pleased with this idea, and according to his minister’s suggestion ordered the God of Literature to prepare an edict, and the Minister of Venus to carry it to the Monkey King.","His Celestial Majesty now questioned his officials about this infamous monkey. “When was he born, and when did he start making trouble like this? How has he become so powerful?” “This creature,” related Thousand-Mile Eye and Follow-the-Wind Ear, “began life some three hundred years ago as a stone monkey born of Heaven. After a perfectly ordinary start in life, he somehow learned the Way of Immortality and is now able to terrorize dragons and tigers and bully the Underworld into deleting him from their ledgers of death.” “So which,” responded the Jade Emperor, “of my divine generals will descend to earth to capture him?” “Majesty,” the Spirit of Longevity from Venus ventured, “given that this monkey is a child of heaven and earth, of the sun and the moon, that he walks on two feet, and has attained immortality, I propose that we treat him as we would a human. I humbly suggest you offer him an amnesty, summon him to Heaven and give him a government job. Once he’s inside the system, he’ll have to behave. If he accepts, we can bamboozle him with sinecures; if he refuses, we can apprehend him. In any case, such a strategy will save us a military campaign and bring an unruly immortal to heel.” “Excellent!” rejoiced the Jade Emperor, ordering a nearby constellation to scribble out the amnesty and appointing the Gold Star of Venus as his peace envoy.","His Celestial Majesty then asked all his civil and military officials, “When was this monkey demon born? What is his origin, that he should have such powers?” Before he had finished speaking, Thousand-mile Eye and Wind-accompanying Ear came forward from the ranks of officials and said, “This demon monkey is the stone monkey who was born of heaven three hundred years ago. At the time nobody paid any attention to him, and we do not know where he refined himself and became an Immortal in recent years, so that he has been able to make the tigers and dragons submit to him and to strike his name off the register of the dead.” “Which divine general shall be sent down to capture him?” asked the Jade Emperor, and before he had finished speaking the Great White Planet stepped forward, bowed down, and submitted, “All beings in the upper worlds that have nine apertures can become Immortals. This monkey has a body that was created by Heaven and Earth and conceived by the sun and moon. His head touches they sky and his feet stand on the earth; he drinks the dew and eats the mist. How does he differ from humans, if he has succeeded in cultivating the way of immortality and can subdue dragons and tigers? I beg Your Majesty to remember your life-giving mercy and hand down a sage edict of amnesty and enlistment, summoning him to this upper world and inscribing his name on the list of officeholders, thus keeping him here under control. If he obeys Your Majesty's heavenly commands, he can later be promoted; and if he disobeys, he can be arrested. This will both avoid military operations and be a way of winning over an Immortal.” The Jade Emperor, delighted with the suggestion, ordered that it should be put into effect. He told the Wenqu Star Officer to compose the edict, and commanded the Great White planet to persuade the monkey to accept the amnesty."
正观看间，忽闻得林深之处，有人言语，急忙趋步，穿入林中，侧耳而听，原来是歌唱之声。歌曰：,"While I was watching, I suddenly heard someone speaking in the deep forest. They hurriedly walked into the forest and turned their ears to listen. It turned out to be the sound of singing. The song says:","As he was looking about, he suddenly heard the sound of a man speaking deep within the woods. Hurriedly he dashed into the forest and cocked his ear to listen. It was someone singing, and the song went thus:","While looking about, he heard a sound far in the forest like the voice of man. He at once plunged into the forest and listened. It was a man singing, and the song he sang was this:","When he reached the top, he suddenly heard a human voice singing deep within a copse of trees. I sleep till dawn then wander the wood,","As he was looking at the view the Monkey King heard a human voice coming from the depths of the forest.

“祸事了！祸事了！”龙王问：“有甚祸事？”夜叉道：“臣巡水去到河边，只听得两个渔樵攀话。相别时，言语甚是利害。那渔翁说：长安城里西门街上，有个卖卦先生，算得最准。他每日送他鲤鱼一尾，他就袖传一课，教他百下百着。若依此等算准，却不将水族尽情打了？何以壮观水府，何以跃浪翻波辅助大王威力？”龙王甚怒，急提了剑就要上长安城，诛灭这卖卦的。旁边闪过龙子龙孙、虾臣蟹士、鲥军师鳜少卿鲤太宰，一齐启奏道：,"""It's a disaster! It's a disaster!"" asked the Dragon King, ""What's wrong?"" Yaksha said, ""My minister went to the river while patrolling the water, and only heard two fishing woodcutters talking. When we parted, words were very beneficial. Said: On Ximen Street in Chang'an City, there was a man selling hexagrams, and he was the most accurate. He gave him a carp every day, and he taught him a hundred lessons. Why don't you fight the Shui clan to your heart's content? Why is the water mansion spectacular, and how can you jump over the waves to help the king's power?"" The Dragon King was so angry that he was about to go to Chang'an City with his sword, and kill the swindler. The dragon son Longsun, the shrimp minister and the crab warrior, and the shad strategist Mandarin Shaoqing and Li Dazai flashed by, and they all said:","Disaster!” “What sort of disaster?” asked the Dragon King. “Your subject,” said the yakṣa, “was patrolling the river and overheard a conversation between a woodman and a fisherman. Before they parted, they said something terrible. According to the fisherman, there is a fortune teller on West Gate Street in the city of Chang’an who is most accurate in his calculations. Every day the fisherman gives him a carp, and he then consults the sticks in his sleeve, with the result that the fisherman has not missed once in a hundred times when he casts his line! If such accurate calculations continue, will not all our water kin be exterminated? Where will you find any more inhabitants for the watery region who will toss and leap in the waves to enhance the majesty of the Great King?” The Dragon King became so angry that he wanted to take the sword and go at once up to Chang’an to slay the fortune teller. But his dragon sons and grandsons, the shrimp and crab ministers, the samli counselor, the perch Subdirector of the Minor Court, and the carp President of the Board of Civil Office all came from the side and said to him, “Let the Great King restrain his anger.","It is so terrible that rocks are split by it, And men will perish rather than give it up. The Monkey got a plaster for his eyes, from his host, and the two disciples went to sleep. On waking they found no town at all, all had vanished. But there were some papers, hanging on the branches of the trees, on which was written: The dwellers in this village were not ordinary men, They defend the Truth with heavenly cures, They clear the sight with marvelous medicine. Strive to oppose falsehood, do not tarry near it! The Monkey said to Zhu Bajie, “Stay here and look after the horse and baggage.","“Catastrophe!” the sentry reported breathlessly to the local dragon king. “I overheard a fisherman saying there’s a fortune-teller in Chang’an who tells him exactly where to fish. If he carries on at this rate, all our relatives will soon be exterminated.” The dragon king was all for charging into Chang’an and killing the fortune-teller. But his family and ministers—a miscellany of shrimp, crab, shad, mandarin fish, and carp—counseled restraint.","“What disaster?” asked the dragon king, and the yaksha replied, “Your subject was patrolling in the water by the river's edge when I heard a fisherman and a woodcutter talking. Just when they were parting they sounded very dangerous. The fisherman said that there is a soothsayer on West Gate Street in Chang'an city whose predictions are very accurate. The fisherman gives him a golden carp every day, and he hands the fisherman a slip saying that he'll catch fish at every attempt. If his calculations are so accurate, won't all we water folk be wiped out? Shall we fortify the water palace, or shall we make some leaping waves to strengthen Your Majesty's prestige?” The dragon king seized his sword in a great rage, intending to go straight to Chang'an city and destroy this fortune-teller, but then his dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp officials, crab soldiers, shad generals, mandarin-fish ministers, and carp premier submitted a joint memorial that read: “We beg Your Majesty not to act in anger."
大圣驾着云，念声咒语，摇身一变，就变做赤脚大仙模样，前奔瑶池。不多时，直至宝阁，按住云头，轻轻移步，走入里面。只见那里：,"The Great Sage rode on the cloud, chanted incantations, and transformed himself into the appearance of a barefooted great immortal, before rushing to Yaochi. After a while, until the treasure pavilion, hold down the cloud head, gently move, and walk inside. I saw there:","Treading the cloud, the Great Sage recited a spell and, with one shake of his body, changed into the form of the Great Immortal of Naked Feet. It did not take him very long before he reached the treasure chamber. He stopped his cloud and walked softly inside. There he found","The Great Sage mounted a cloud and repeated an incantation to change his body. He was at once changed into the likeness of the bare footed Taoist, and directing his course to the celestial lake, soon got to the Banquet Hall, and finally entered inside.

Monkey now chanted another spell to transform himself into an exact likeness of Barefoot, landed next to the Palace of the Jade Pool, and entered with a catlike tread. The palace’s ornamented interior was heavy with the most marvelous fragrances.","As the Great Sage rode his cloud he said a spell, shook himself, took the form of the Bare-foot Immortal, and hurried to the Jade Pool. He reached the pavilion there a moment later, stopped his cloud, and went quietly inside. He saw"
轮起棒照头一下，慌得那黑汉化风而逃，道人驾云而走，只把个白衣秀士，一棒打死，拖将过来看处，却是一条白花蛇怪。索性提起来，捽做五七断，径入深山，找寻那个黑汉。转过尖峰，抹过峻岭，又见那壁陡崖前，耸出一座洞府，但见那：烟霞渺渺，松柏森森。烟霞渺渺采盈门，松柏森森青绕户。桥踏枯槎木，峰巅绕薛萝。鸟衔红蕊来云壑，鹿践芳丛上石台。那门前时催花发，风送花香。临堤绿柳转黄鹂，傍岸夭桃翻粉蝶。虽然旷野不堪夸，却赛蓬莱山下景。,"Turning the stick to take a look at the head, the black Chinese fled in panic, and the Taoist drove away, only to kill a white-clothed scholar with one stick, and dragged him over to look at the place, but it was a white-flowered basilisk. He simply mentioned it, made five or seven cuts, and headed into the deep mountains to find the black man. Turning around the peaks, wiping over the steep mountains, I saw a cave towering out in front of the cliff, but I saw that: the misty haze, the pine trees and cypresses. The misty haze looms over the door, and the pine trees and cypresses are green around the house. The bridge steps on withered wood, and the peak surrounds Xue Luo. The bird takes the red core to the cloud gully, and the deer Jianfang goes up to the stone platform. In front of the door, flowers are urged, and the wind sends the fragrance of flowers. The green willows on the embankment turn into orioles, and the peaches on the banks turn into pink butterflies. Although the wilderness is unbearable, the scenery of Sai Penglai Mountain is down.","In panic, the swarthy fellow fled by riding the wind, and the Daoist escaped by mounting the clouds. The white-robed scholar, however, was killed by one stroke of the rod, and he turned out to be the spirit of a white-spotted snake when Pilgrim pulled his body over for closer examination. He picked up the corpse again and broke it into several pieces before proceeding deep into the mountain to look for the swarthy fellow. Passing pointed peaks and rugged ridges, he found himself in front of a hanging cliff with a cave dwelling below it. You see Mist and smoke abundant, Cypress and pine umbrageous. Mist and smoke abundant, their hues surround the door; Cypress and pine umbrageous, their green entwines the gate. Flat, dried wood supports a bridge. Wisterias coil round the ridge. Birds carrying red petals reach the cloudy gorge. And deer tread on florets to comb the rocky flats. Before that door The flowers bloom with the season As the wind wafts their fragrance. Atop the dyke-shading willows orioles sing; O’er the bank’s sweet peaches butterflies flit. This rustic spot, though no cause for much praise, Still rivals the3 beauty of Mount Penglai.2",,"“Cheer up,” said Monkey. “Pigsy also told me that you saved Tripitaka and sent him off with a letter to your parents. How about I defeat the monster and take you back to Precious Image? You can marry someone more appropriate and look after your parents in their old age.” “But you’re just a stringy little shrimp,” objected the princess. “What chance do you stand against the likes of Yellow-Robe?” Monkey laughed at her doubts. “‘A urine bubble is large but weightless; a steelyard is small but weighs a thousand pounds.’","The dark fellow turned into a wind to flee in terror, and the Taoist rode off on a cloud; so Monkey was only able to slay the white-robed scholar with a blow from the club. When he dragged the body over to look at it, he saw that it was a white-patterned snake spirit. In his anger he picked the corpse up and tore it to pieces, then went into the recesses of the mountain in search of the dark fellow. Rounding a sharp pinnacle and traversing a dizzy precipice, he saw a cave palace in the cliff: Thick, misty clouds, Dense with cypress and pine. The thick and misty clouds fill the gates with color; The dense stands of cypress and pine surround the door with green. For a bridge there is a dried-out log, And wild fig coils around the mountain peaks. Birds carry red petals to the cloud-filled valley; Deer tread on scented bushes as they climb the stone tower. Before the gates the season brings out flowers, As the wind wafts their fragrance. Around the willows on the dike the golden orioles wheel; Butterflies flit among the peach-trees on the bank. This ordinary scene can yet compete With lesser views in Fairyland."
路过此间，权为一歇。”大仙佯讶道：“长老东来，可曾在荒山经过？”长老道：“不知仙宫是何宝山？”大仙道：“万寿山五庄观，便是贫道栖止处。”行者闻言，他心中有物的人，忙答道：“不曾！不曾！我们是打上路来的。”那大仙指定笑道：“我把你这个泼猴！你瞒谁哩？你倒在我观里，把我人参果树打倒，你连夜走在此间，还不招认，遮饰甚么？不要走！趁早去还我树来！”,"Passing by here, the right to take a break. Daxian pretended to be surprised: ""The elders came from the east, have you ever passed by the barren mountains?"" ""The elder said: ""I don't know where the fairy palace is He Baoshan?"" Daxian said: ""Wu Zhuang View of Longevity Mountain is the place where the poor road lives. When the traveler heard the words, the person who had something in his heart quickly replied: ""Never! Never! We're on our way. ""The big immortal designated with a smile: ""I will throw you a monkey!"" Who are you hiding from? You fell in my view, knocked down my ginseng fruit tree, and you walked here all night without confessing, what are you covering up? do not go! Return my tree as soon as possible! ""","Feigning surprise, the Great Immortal said, “When you came from the East, did you pass through my humble mountain abode?” “Which precious mountain is the abode of the venerable immortal?” asked the elder. The Great Immortal said, “The Five Villages Abbey in the Long Life Mountain is where I reside.” The moment he heard this, Pilgrim, having something very much on his mind, replied, “No! No! We came by another route up there.” Pointing a finger firmly at him, the Great Immortal said with a laugh, “Brazen ape! Who are you trying to fool? You struck down my ginseng fruit tree in my Abbey, and then you fled here in the night. You dare deny this? Why try to cover up? Don’t run away! Go quickly and bring back another tree for me!”",,"Monkey opened another; again, a perfect blank. They unrolled every single one; all were blank. “How can I take these back to the emperor?” Tripitaka wondered. “He would have my head for the insult.” “Just because we didn’t have any presents for those attendants,” Monkey deduced, “they’ve given us blank scrolls. Let’s go straight back to the Buddha and accuse them of extortion and fraud—twice the fun.” The four of them slogged back up the mountain. They soon found themselves at the temple gates again. “Exchange or return?” the laughing attendants asked, ushering the four of them back into the Great Hero Hall, where Monkey proceeded to tear into the Buddha. “Do you have any idea what we’ve been through the past fourteen years? And then your servants demanded a bribe and, when we refused, conned us with blank scrolls. I demand satisfaction!” “Calm down,” the Buddha said with a chuckle.","“I have been sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,” Sanzang said, “and I'm taking a rest along the way.” “You must have crossed my desolate mountain if you have come from the East.” “May I ask, Immortal sir, which mountain is yours?” “My humble abode is the Wuzhuang Temple on the Mountain of Infinite Longevity.” “We didn't come that way,” said Monkey, who realized what was happening. “We've only just started out.” The Great Immortal pointed at him and laughed. “I'll show you, you damned ape. Who do you think you're fooling? I know that you knocked our manfruit tree down and came here during the night. You had better confess: you won't get away with concealing anything. Stay where you are, and give me back that tree at once.”"
那行者跳在空中，用手搭凉篷而看，他也心惊道：“师父啊，真个是难，真个是难！这条河若论老孙去呵，只消把腰儿扭一扭，就过去了；若师父，诚千分难渡，万载难行。”三藏道：“我这里一望无边，端的有多少宽阔？”行者道：“径过有八百里远近。”,"The walker jumped in the air and looked at the awning with his hands. He was also shocked and said, ""Master, it's really difficult, it's really difficult! If this river is an old grandson, you only need to twist your waist. If you twist it, it will pass; if it is Master, it is very difficult to cross, and it will be difficult for ten thousand years."" Sanzang said: ""I can see the boundless here, how wide is the end?"" The traveler said: ""The path is 800 miles away.""","Pilgrim leaped into the air and peered into the distance, shading his eyes with his hand. Even he became somewhat frightened and said, “Master, it’s truly hard! Truly hard! If old Monkey wishes to cross this river, he need only make one twist of his body and he will reach the other shore. But for you, Master, it’s a thousand times more difficult, for you can’t traverse it even in ten thousand years!” “I can’t even see the other shore from here,” said Tripitaka. “Really, how wide is it?” “It’s just about eight hundred miles wide,” said Pilgrim.",,"Please stamp my disciples’ papers and send them on their way while it is still light.” Leading Tripitaka by the hand, the queen dismissed the banquet and proceeded to the throne room, where she stamped the documents with her own seal, signed her name, and passed them back to Monkey. She then tried to press upon the three disciples gold, silver, and brocade for their journey. Monkey refused them all, for Buddhist mendicants were not permitted such riches. “Take six pints of rice at least,” she suggested instead. This Pigsy instantly accepted: “It’ll do me for one meal.” “I would like to see them off personally,” Tripitaka now told the queen, “as I have some advice for them about their journey to the west.”","Monkey sprang into the sky, shaded his eyes with his hand, and looked. “Master,” he said with horror, “we're in big trouble here. I can cross a river like this with a twist of my waist, but I'm afraid you'll never be able to cross it in ten thousand years.” “How wide is it, then?” Sanzang asked. “I can't see the other bank from here.” “About three hundred miles,” Monkey replied."
禅师道：“远哩！远哩！只是路多虎豹难行。”三藏殷勤致意，再回：“路途果有多远？”禅师道：“路途虽远，终须有到之日，却只是魔瘴难消。我有《多心经》一卷，凡五十四句，共计二百七十字。若遇魔瘴之处，但念此经，自无伤害。”三藏拜伏于地恳求，那禅师遂口诵传之。经云《摩诃般若波罗蜜多心经》：观自在菩萨，行深般若波罗蜜多，时照见五蕴皆空，度一切苦厄。舍利子，色不异空，空不异色；色即是空，空即是色。受想行识，亦复如是。舍利子，是诸法空相，不生不灭，不垢不净，不增不减。是故空中无色，无受想行识，无眼耳鼻舌身意，无色声香味触法，无眼界，乃至无意识界，无无明，亦无无明尽，乃至无老死，亦无老死尽。无苦寂灭道，无智亦无得。以无所得故，菩提萨。,"The Zen master said: ""It's a long way! It's a long way! It's just that there are too many tigers and leopards to travel."" Sanzang paid his respects attentively, and then returned: ""How far is the road?"" It’s just that the miasma is hard to get rid of. I have a volume of the “Many Heart Sutra”, with fifty-four sentences, a total of 270 crosses. If you encounter a miasma, but recite this sutra, it will be harmless.” Sanzang bowed to the ground and pleaded. , the Zen master then recited it. The sutra goes ""Maha Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra"": Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, who practices deep Prajna Paramita, sees that the five aggregates are empty, and saves all suffering. Sariputra, form is not different from emptiness, and emptiness is not different from form; form is emptiness, and emptiness is form. Want to know that line, same is the case. Shariputra, the emptiness of all dharmas is neither born nor perished, neither defiled nor pure, neither increasing nor decreasing. Therefore, the sky has no form, no feeling, thought, action, consciousness, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, form, sound, scent, touch, Dharma, vision, and even the realm of unconsciousness. . There is no suffering and cessation, no wisdom and no gain. Because there is nothing to gain, Bodhisattva.","“It’s very far away! Very far away!” said the Chan Master. “What’s more, the road is a difficult one, filled with tigers and leopards.” With great earnestness, Tripitaka asked again, “Just how far is it?” “Though it may be very far,” answered the Chan Master, “you will arrive there one day. But all those māra hindrances along the way are hard to dispel. I have a Heart Sūtra here in this scroll; it has fifty-four sentences containing two hundred and seventy characters. When you meet these māra hindrances, recite the sūtra and you will not suffer any injury or harm.” Tripitaka prostrated himself on the ground and begged to receive it, whereupon the Chan Master imparted the sūtra by reciting it orally. The sūtra said: HEART SŪTRA OF THE GREAT PERFECTION OF WISDOM When the Bodhisattva Guanzizai26 was moving in the deep course of the Perfection of Wisdom, she saw that the five heaps27 were but emptiness, and she transcended all sufferings. Śārīputra, form is no different from emptiness, emptiness no different from form; form is emptiness, and emptiness is form. Of sensations, perceptions, volition, and consciousness, the same is also true. Śārīputra, it is thus that all dharmas are but empty appearances, neither produced nor destroyed, neither defiled nor pure, neither increasing nor decreasing. This is why in emptiness there are no forms and no sensations, perceptions, volition, or consciousness; no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or object of mind. There is no realm of sight [and so forth], until we reach the realm of no mind-consciousness; there is no ignorance, nor is there extinction of ignorance [and so forth], until we reach the stage where there is no old age and death, nor is there the extinction of old age and death; there is no suffering, annihilation, or way; there is no cognition or attainment. Because there is nothing to be attained, the mind of the Bodhisattva, by virtue of reliance upon the Perfection of Wisdom, has no hindrances: no hindrances, and therefore, no terror or fear; he is far removed from error and delusion, and finally reaches Nirvāṇa.",,"“Looking forward to it,” said Monkey, smiling. Tiger-Strength now climbed to the top of the altar—some thirty feet high—followed by Tripitaka and his disciples. The altar fluttered with banners bearing the names of constellations. A gold tablet engraved with the names of the thunder gods was propped up against a brazier filled with billowing incense and flanked by candles. A large supporting staff of Taoist priests struck pillars and wrote screeds. Holding a sword, Tiger-Strength chanted a spell, burned a charm, and banged his ritual tablet. A breeze instantly started up. “Not good!” worried Pigsy. Monkey shushed him. “You two, look after Tripitaka. I’ll take care of this.” He plucked out a hair, blew magic breath onto it, and turned it into a phony Monkey standing next to Tripitaka. The real Monkey soared into the air. “Who’s in charge of the wind up here?” he yelled.","“Far away,” the other replied, “far away. The journey is a long one and there are many tigers and leopards along the way. It will be difficult.” “How far is it?” asked Sanzang with great interest. “Although the journey is a long one,” the hermit replied, “you are bound to get there in the end. But there will be evil influences that you'll find hard to dispel. I have a Heart Sutra, a total of 270 words in 54 sentences, and if you recite it when you encounter evil influences you will come to no harm.” Sanzang prostrated himself on the ground and begged the hermit to tell him it, and the hermit recited it to him. It went: When the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was meditating on the profound prajna-paramita, he perceived that all the five aggregates are void and empty, and he was thereupon freed from all sufferings and calamities. Sariputra, matter is not different from voidness and voidness is not different from matter: matter is voidness and voidness is matter. Such is also the case with sensation, perception, discrimination and consciousness. Sariputra, all these things are void in nature, having neither beginning nor end, being neither pure nor impure, and having neither increase nor decrease. Therefore, in voidness there is not matter, no sensation, no perception, no discrimination and no consciousness; there is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body and no mind; there is no sight, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch and no mental process; there is no category of eye nor is there a category of consciousness; no ignorance nor the cessation of ignorance; no old age and death, nor the cessation of old age and death; there is no suffering, no causes of suffering, no cessation of suffering, and no way leading go the cessation of suffering; and there is no wisdom, nor anything to be gained. As nothing is to be gained, a Bodhisattva depending on prajna-paramita becomes free in his mind, and as he is free in his mind he has no fear and is rid of dreamlike thoughts of unreality and enjoys ultimate Nirvana."
只因纵火烧了殿上明珠，被他父亲告了忤逆，身犯天条，多亏观音菩萨救了他的性命，他在那鹰愁陡涧，久等师父，又幸得菩萨亲临，却将他退鳞去角，摘了项下珠，才变做这匹马，愿驮师父往西天拜佛。这个都是各人的功果，你莫攀他。”那沙僧闻言道：“哥哥，真个是龙么？”行者道：“是龙。”八戒道：“哥啊，我闻得古人云，龙能喷云暧雾，播土扬沙。有巴山捎岭的手段，有翻江搅海的神通。怎么他今日这等慢慢而走？”行者道：“你要他快走，我教他快走个儿你看。”好大圣，把金箍棒揝一揝，万道彩云生。那马看见拿棒，恐怕打来，慌得四只蹄疾如飞电，飕的跑将去了。那师父手软勒不住，尽他劣性，奔上山崖，才大达辿步走。师父喘息始定，抬头远见一簇松阴，内有几间房舍，着实轩昂，但见：门垂翠柏，宅近青山。几株松冉冉，数茎竹斑斑。,"He was sued by his father for disobedience because he set fire to the bright pearl in the hall, and he was in violation of heaven. After retreating the scales and horns, and picking the bead under the neck, it became this horse, and I wish to carry the master to the west to worship the Buddha. This is the result of everyone's work, you don't want to rely on him. ""The sand monk heard the words and said: ""Brother, is this really a dragon?"" ""Walker said: ""It's a dragon. ""Bajie said: ""Brother, I heard the ancients say that dragons can spray clouds and mist, sow soil and sand. It has the means of bridging mountains in Bashan, and the supernatural power of turning the river and stirring the sea. Why is he walking so slowly today? ""Walker said: ""You want him to go quickly, I will teach him to walk quickly, you see."" ""Good sage, take the golden hoop stick, and thousands of colorful clouds will grow. When the horse sees the stick, he is afraid to call, and his four hooves are as fast as lightning, and he will run away. The master can't restrain his hands. Staying there, he tried his best to run up the cliff, and only then did Da Yi walk. The master was still breathing, looked up and saw a cluster of pine trees in the distance. There are several houses inside, which are really majestic, but you can see: the door is full of green cypresses, and the house is close to the green hills. A few pine trees, and a few bamboo stems are spotted.","Because he set fire to the palace and destroyed some of its pearls, his father charged him with disobedience and he was condemned by Heaven. He was fortunate to have the Bodhisattva Guanyin save his life, and he was placed in the Eagle Grief Stream to await Master’s arrival. At the appropriate time, the Bodhisattva also appeared personally to take off his scales and horns and to remove the pearls around his neck. It was then that he changed into this horse to carry Master to worship Buddha in the Western Heaven. This is a matter of achieving merit for each one of us individually, and you shouldn’t bother him.” When Sha Monk heard these words, he asked, “Elder Brother, is he really a dragon?” “Yes,” replied Pilgrim. Eight Rules said, “Elder Brother, I have heard an ancient saying that a dragon can breathe out clouds and mists, kick up dust and dirt, and he even has the ability to leap over mountains and peaks, the divine power to stir up rivers and seas. How is it that he is walking so slowly at the moment?” “You want him to move swiftly?” said Pilgrim. “I’ll make him do that. Look!” Dear Great Sage! He shook his golden-hooped rod once, and there were ten thousand shafts of colorful lights! When that horse saw the rod, he was so afraid that he might be struck by it that he moved his four legs like lightning and darted away. As his hands were weak, the master could not restrain the horse from this display of its mean nature. The horse ran all the way up a mountain cliff before slowing down to a trot. The master finally caught his breath, and that was when he discovered in the distance several stately buildings beneath some pine trees. He saw Doors draped by hanging cedars: Houses beside a green hill; Pine trees fresh and straight. And some poles of mottled bamboo.",,"This monkey must be quite something, thought a fearful Iron-Fan. How can he be back so soon after I fanned him? This time, I’ll fan him two or three times—that’ll send him packing for good. She stomped out of the cave again. “Still got that death wish, I see,” she greeted her adversary. “Play fair,” Monkey said, smiling back. “Lend me the fan so we can get past that mountain. You’ll have it back straight after.” She answered by charging at him again. Realizing after a few minutes that the fight wasn’t going her way, Iron-Fan fanned him once more, but this time Monkey was completely unmovable. “Technical issue?” he inquired, with a grin. Panicking, Iron-Fan ran back inside the cave and locked the door. Popping the wind-stilling elixir into his mouth, Monkey transformed into a tiny cricket and squeezed in through a crack in the door. Inside, Iron-Fan was shouting for tea.","Because he burnt the palace pearls his father reported on him as an offender against the Heavenly Code. Luckily for him, his life saved by the Bodhisattva Guanyin, and he waited a long time for the master in the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge. He was honoured by another visit from the Bodhisattva, who took off his scales and horns, removed the pearls from under his neck, and turned him into this horse, which has sworn to carry the master to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha. This is a matter of him winning merit for himself, so you'd better leave him alone.” “Is he really a dragon?” asked Friar Sand when he heard this. “Yes,” Monkey replied. “I've heard an old saying,” Pig remarked, “that dragons can breathe out clouds, make the dust and sand fly, pull mountain ranges up by their roots, and turn oceans upside down. How is it that he's moving so slowly now?” “If you want to see him go fast,” Monkey replied, “I'll make him go fast for you.” The splendid Great Sage gripped his iron cudgel, and countless luminous clouds sprang from it. When the horse saw him grab the cudgel he thought he was going to be hit with it, and in his terror he shot off at the speed of lightning. Sanzang was too weak to rein him in as the equine dashed up the mountainside for all his evil nature was worth before he slackened his pace. When Sanzang began to get his breath back, he looked up and saw some fine houses in the shade of a bamboo grove: Cypresses were bending over the gates Of the houses near the blue mountain. There were several spreading pines And some molded bamboo."
东连沙碛，两抵诸番；南达乌戈，北通鞑靼。径过有八百里遥．上下有千万里远。水流一似地翻身，浪滚却如山耸背。洋洋浩浩，漠漠茫茫，十里遥闻万丈洪。仙槎难到此，莲叶莫能浮。衰草斜阳流曲浦，黄云影日暗长堤。那里得客商来往？何曾有渔叟依栖？平沙无雁落，远岸有猿啼。只是红蓼花絮知景色，白苹香细任依依。,"To the east is Shaqi, and two arrive at Zhufan; to the south is Ugo, and to the north is the Tatar. It is eight hundred miles away. There are thousands of miles up and down. The water turned over like a stream, but the waves rolled like a mountain. The ocean is vast, the desert is vast, and the flood is heard from ten miles away. It is difficult for Xiancha to come here, and the lotus leaves cannot float. Decline grass and the setting sun flows in Qupu, the yellow cloud shadows the sun and the long embankment. Where are there businessmen? When was there a fisherman who lived there? There are no geese falling on the flat sand, and there are apes crowing on the far shore. Only the tidbits of the red Polygonum know the scenery, and the white Pingxiang is delicate.","In the east it touches the sandy coast; In the west it joins the barbaric states; In the south it reaches even Wuyi;25 In the north it comes near the Tartars. Its width is eight hundred miles, And its length must measure many thousand more. The water flows as if Earth is heaving its frame. The current rises like a mountain rearing its back. Outspread and immense; Vast and interminable. The sound of its towering billows reaches distant ears. The raft of a god cannot come here, Nor can a leaf of the lotus stay afloat. Lifeless grass in the twilight drifts along the crooked banks. Yellow clouds conceal the sun to darken the long dikes. Where can one find the traffic of merchants? Has there been ever a shelter for fishermen? On the flat sand no wild geese descend; From distant shores comes the crying of apes. Only the red smartweed flowers know this scene, Basking in the white duckweed’s fragile scent.","The Dragon King restored the soul into the body of the husband, who became first Secretary of State, while Xuanzang became abbot at the Hongfu Temple in Chang’an. 9 The Emperor Goes to Hell A FISHERMAN AND A WOODSMAN in Chang’an were loud in praises of a certain fortune teller, who always advised the fisherman where to cast his net, with the result that his net was full of fish. One of the water spirits, overhearing their words, carried the news to the Dragon King, crying that all the fish in the waters would soon be caught, because of the fortuneteller. The Dragon King became very angry, and visited the fortuneteller, and asked him about the weather. The fortuneteller predicted a heavy fall of rain the following day. The Dragon King said, “If you are right about your promised rain, and it comes exactly, I will give you fifty taels; but if you are wrong, then I will smash your house and sign board, and you shall leave the city, so that the people shall not be deceived any more.” After the bargain was agreed to, the Dragon King went back to the deep. After relating the matter to his followers, they said, “It is only you, the Dragon King, who knows when rain shall come. How dare this false prophet know?” Before these words were finished, they heard that a dispatch had been brought for the Dragon King from the Jade Emperor, and they saw a yellow robed official bearing an edict, which said, “I command the Dragon King to ensure that tomorrow there shall be heavy rain all over Chang’an.”","“How will our pilgrim, a weak mortal, cross this vast river?” Guanyin wondered. Just as the Bodhisattva was pondering the desolate immensity of the river, a hideous monster leaped out of the waves.","Joining up with the deserts to the East, Reaching the foreign kingdoms in the West, Wuge in the South The Tatars in the North. It was about three hundred miles across, And three million miles long. As the waters flowed it was like the earth turning over, The waves were like rearing mountains. Broad and boundless, Vast and mighty: From three miles' distance the mighty flood is heard. Immortals' rafts do not reach here, Lotus leaves cannot float on it. The sun slants through withered plants and bathes the crooked shore; Brown clouds block its light and darken the long bank. How could merchants pass this way? Has a fisherman ever moored here?

After this he found his mother, his father’s mother and his mother’s father, who after hearing all about the rascality of the boatman, memorialized the Throne, and was authorized to take 60,000 soldiers to surround the false official. Finally the scattered Chen family was reunited.","“How will our pilgrim, a weak mortal, cross this vast river?”","“Disciple,” said the Bodhisattva, “this will be hard to cross for the man who will come to fetch the scriptures, as he will be of impure bone and mortal flesh.

This great sage can't be seen all the time, and suddenly I can smell the aroma of wine; I turn my head and see under the corridor on the right wall, there are a few immortal officials who make wine, a wrestler who makes a mess, and a few Taoists who lead the water. The boy who burned the fire, washed the urn and brushed the urn there, has created the jade liquid nectar, fragrant mash and fine wine. The Great Sage couldn't stop his mouth drooling, so he was going to eat, but those people were all here. He got a magical power, plucked out a few hairs, threw them into his mouth, chewed them, sprayed them out, chanted a spell, called ""Change!"", and turned into a few sleepy bugs, running on everyone's faces. Look at that group of people, with their hands soft and their heads lowered, their brows closed and their eyes closed, they all went to sleep after losing the deacon. However, the Great Sage took some delicacies and exotic delicacies, walked into the corridor, put the jar next to the urn, let go of the amount, and drank heavily. After eating for a long time, the tincture became drunk. He thought to himself: ""Not good! Not good! After a while, I invite guests, but don't blame me? If you hold it for a while, how can you live? It's better to go back to the mansion and sleep early.""","Everything was laid out in an orderly fashion, but no deity had yet arrived for the feast. Our Great Sage could not make an end of staring at the scene when he suddenly felt the overpowering aroma of wine. Turning his head, he saw, in the long corridor to the right, several wine-making divine officials and grain-mashing stewards. They were giving directions to the few Daoists charged with carrying water and the boys who took care of the fire in washing out the barrels and scrubbing the jugs. For they had already finished making the wine, rich and mellow as the juices of jade. The Great Sage could not prevent the saliva from dripping out of the corner of his mouth, and he wanted to have a taste at once, except that the people were all standing there. He therefore resorted to magic. Plucking a few hairs, he threw them into his mouth and chewed them to pieces before spitting them out. He recited a spell and cried “Change!” They changed into many sleep-inducing insects, which landed on the people’s faces. Look at them, how their hands grow weak, their heads droop, and their eyelids sink down. They dropped their activities, and all fell sound asleep. The Great Sage then took some of the rare delicacies and choicest dainties and ran into the corridor. Standing beside the jars and leaning on the barrels, he abandoned himself to drinking. After feasting for a long time, he became thoroughly drunk, but he turned this over in his mind, “Bad! Bad! In a little while, when the invited guests arrive, won’t they be indignant with me? What will happen to me once I’m caught? I’d better go back home now and sleep it off!”","All were arranged in perfect order, but as yet no guests had arrived. The Great Sage noted everything. Suddenly he smelt some wine, turned round quickly and saw several jars of carnation sauce and sweet fermented spirits under cover of the right partition, so that his mouth watered and he wanted to taste it. But those that served the wine were all in attendance. He therefore used his magic, plucked a few hairs, put them in his mouth and chewed them small and pronounced an incantation saying, “Change!,” and the bits of hair were all changed into sleeping insects which flew on the men’s faces and soon their hands were limp and their heads heavy and all fell into a deep sleep. The Great Sage then tasted those fine dishes, went to the right partition where the wine jars were, opened them and drank till he became tipsy. Then he said to himself, “This will never do, for the guests will soon arrive and I shall not be surprised if they arrest me. What shall I do? It is better that I should return to my home and have a sleep.”","No guests had arrived yet. Just as the Great Sage was busy goggling at the scene before him, he suddenly smelled exquisitely aromatic wine. Spotting in a corridor leading off the main hall some immortal stewards distilling some alcoholic ambrosia, the Great Sage felt his monkey mouth begin to water uncontrollably; he simply had to have some. But how to get past the brewery staff? Magic was the answer, as usual. He pulled out a few of his hairs, chewed them into pieces, spat them out, recited a spell, and changed them into a swarm of nap-inducing insects. The instant they crawled over the stewards’ faces, the servants crumpled to the ground and nodded off. After guzzling the choicest items from the table, Monkey skipped into the corridor and glugged to his heart’s content. Although now as drunk as a skunk, he remained lucid enough to reflect upon his actions. “Not good! Not good at all! Once the guests arrive, they’ll lay into me for spoiling their banquet. Best to go home and sleep it off.”","Everything was neatly set out, but no Immortals had yet arrived. The Great Sage had not finished looking when he smelt wine; and as he whirled round he saw under a portico to the right several immortal officials in charge of brewing liquor with some workmen who stirred the lees, a number of novices who carried water and some boys who looked after the fires. They were washing the vats and scrubbing the pots, having made jade liquor and a fragrant fermentation of the lees. The Great Sage could not stop himself from drooling, and he longed to drink some, but unfortunately all those people were there. So he performed a spell by pulling several hairs from his body, chewing them up, spitting them up, saying the magic words, and shouting “Change”; whereupon the hairs turned into sleep insects, which flew into the faces of all the liquor-makers. Watch them as their hands go limp , their heads droop, their eyes close, and they drop their symbols of office and all fall asleep. Whereupon the Great Sage grabbed the rare delicacies and exotic foods, then went under the portico and drank from the vats and pots until he was completely drunk. Only then did he think, “This won't do at all. When the guests come for the banquet they'll be furious with me, and I'll be for it if I'm caught. I'd better get back to the Residence as soon as I can and sleep it off.”"
三藏坐在上面，好便似雷惊的孩子，雨淋的虾蟆，只是呆呆挣挣，翻白眼儿打仰。那八戒闻得这般富贵，这般美色，他却心痒难挠，坐在那椅子上，一似针戳屁股，左扭右扭的，忍耐不住，走上前，扯了师父一把道：“师父！这娘子告诵你话，你怎么佯佯不睬？好道也做个理会是。”那师父猛抬头，咄的一声，喝退了八戒道：“你这个孽畜！我们是个出家人，岂以富贵动心，美色留意，成得个甚么道理！”那妇人笑道：“可怜！可怜！出家人有何好处？”三藏道：“女菩萨，你在家人，却有何好处？”那妇人道：“长老请坐，等我把在家人好处说与你听。怎见得？有诗为证，诗曰：春裁方胜着新罗，夏换轻纱赏绿荷；秋有新蒭香糯酒，冬来暖阁醉颜酡。四时受用般般有，八节珍羞件件多；衬锦铺绫花烛夜，强如行脚礼弥陀。”三藏道：“女菩萨，你在家人享荣华，受富贵，有可穿，有可吃，儿女团圆，果然是好。但不知我出家的人，也有一段好处。怎见得？有诗为证，诗曰：出家立志本非常，推倒从前恩爱堂。外物不生闲口舌，身中自有好阴阳。,"Sanzang sat on it, like a child in thunder, a prawn drenched in the rain, just staring blankly and rolling his eyes. That Bajie smelled so rich, so beautiful, but his heart was itching. He sat on the chair, poking his butt like a needle, twisting from side to side. One said: ""Master! This lady is telling you, why do you pretend not to pay attention? If you have a good way, you should pay attention to it."" The master raised his head sharply, slammed it, and backed Bajie: ""You wicked beast. We are monks, how can we be tempted by wealth and honor, and pay attention to beauty, what is the truth!"" The woman smiled and said: ""Poor! Poor! What is the benefit of being a monk?"" Sanzang said: ""Female Bodhisattva, you are in your family, but What's the benefit?"" The woman said, ""Please sit down, elder, and wait for me to tell you about the benefits of my family. How can I see it? There is a poem as proof, the poem says: The spring judge is better than Silla, and the summer changes the veil to appreciate the green. Lotus; in autumn, there is new glutinous wine, and in winter, when you come to warm the pavilion, you will be drunk. It is used in the four seasons, and there are many precious and shameful pieces in the eight festivals; lining the brocade shop with silk flowers and candles at night, it is better than bowing to Amitabha."" Sanzang said: ""Female Bodhisattva, it is really good for your family to enjoy glory, receive wealth, have something to wear, have something to eat, and your children are reunited. But I don’t know if I am a monk, there is also a benefit. How can I see it? There is a poem to prove it, the poem says: Become a monk and aspire This is very, tearing down the former conjugal love hall. There is no idle talk about foreign things, and there is a good yin and yang in the body.","Sitting aloft in the seat of honor, Tripitaka was like a child struck by lightning, a frog smitten by rain. With eyes bulging and rolling upward, he could barely keep himself from keeling over in his chair. But Eight Rules, hearing of such wealth and such beauty, could hardly quell the unbearable itch in his heart! Sitting on his chair, he kept turning and twisting as if a needle were pricking him in the ass. Finally he could restrain himself no longer. Walking forward, he tugged at his master, saying, “Master! How can you completely ignore what the lady has been saying to you? You must try to pay some attention.” Jerking back his head, the priest gave such a hostile shout that Eight Rules backed away hurriedly. “You cursed beast!” he bellowed. “We are people who have left home. How can we possibly allow ourselves anymore to be moved by riches and tempted by beauty?” Giggling, the woman said, “Oh dear, dear! Tell me, what’s so good about those who leave home?” “Lady Bodhisattva,” said Tripitaka, “tell me what is so good about those of you who remain at home?” “Please take a seat, elder,” said the woman, “and let me tell you the benefits in the life of those of us who remain at home. If you ask what they are, this poem will make them abundantly clear. When spring fashions appear I wear new silk; Pleased to watch summer lilies I change to lace. Autumn brings fragrant rice-wine newly brewed. In winter’s heated rooms my face glows with wine. I may enjoy the fruits of all four climes And every dainty of eight seasons, too. The silk sheets and quilts of the bridal eve Best the mendicant’s life of Buddhist chants.” Tripitaka said, “Lady Bodhisattva, you who remain in the home can enjoy riches and glory; you have things to eat, clothes to wear, and children by your side. That is undeniably a good life, but you do not know that there are some benefits in the life of those of us who have left home. If you ask what they are, this poem will make them abundantly clear. The will to leave home is no common thing: You must tear down the old stronghold of love! No cares without, tongue and mouth are at peace; Your body within has good yin and yang.",,"You need the princess’s fan to extinguish the fire.” “Isn’t this it?” asked Monkey, picking it up from the side of the road, where he had left it. “It only made the blaze stronger.” “Ah.” The spirit smiled. “She duped you with a fake. If you want the real one, you’ll have to seek out King Bull Demon.” “Why?” asked Monkey, only half persuaded by the spirit’s account of the mountain’s origins. “King Bull Demon is Princess Iron-Fan’s husband. Some while ago, however, he left her and currently resides in Cloud-Scraper Cave on Thunder-Hoard Mountain. The cave’s former master, a fox king, passed away at the ripe old age of ten thousand, leaving behind a daughter called Princess Jade-Face and an extraordinary fortune with no one to look after it. Two years ago, Jade-Face learned how powerful King Bull Demon was and offered him all of her fortune as dowry if he agreed to become her consort. So the king abandoned Iron-Fan and hasn’t been back to visit her since. You’ll only get ahold of that fan with his help. If you succeed, you’ll not only extinguish the fire, enabling the pilgrimage to proceed, but also solve the region’s appalling climate problems. And I’ll be pardoned and allowed to return to work for Laozi in Heaven. Win-win-win.” “So where is this Thunder-Hoard Mountain?” Monkey asked. “About three thousand miles due south of here.” Telling Pigsy and Sandy to look after Tripitaka, and the spirit to keep them all company, Monkey disappeared with a whoosh. In less than an hour, Monkey landed on yet another spectacularly lovely mountain.","Sanzang sat in the place of honour as still as a child terrified by thunder or a toad soaked in a rainstorm. He seemed to be in a trance as he leant back with his eyes turned up towards the sky. Pig, however, felt an itch in his mind that was hard to scratch when he heard about all this wealth and beauty. He fidgeted on his chair as if needles were being stuck into his backside, and finally could bear it no longer. He went up to his master, tugged at his clothes, and said, “Master, why are you paying no attention to what the lady is saying? You really ought to take some notice.” Sanzang glared at him angrily, made a furious noise, and shouted at him to go away. “Evil beast,” he said, “We are men of religion. It's disgraceful to allow yourself to be moved by the thought of wealth, honour or sex.” “Poor, poor things,” said the woman with a smile. “What good can there be in being men of religion?” “What good can there be in being of the world, Bodhisattva?” Sanzang replied. “Please sit down, reverend sir, while I tell you about the advantages of being in the world,” she said. “There is a poem to describe them that goes: In spring we cut out linked diamond patterns and wear new silk; In summer we change to light gauze and admire the lotus; In autumn comes meat and delicious rice-wine, In winter the house is warm, and our faces are red with drink. We have all that's needed in the four seasons, The treasures and delicacies of the whole year. Brocade clothes, silken sheets and a wedding night Are better than plodding along and worshipping Maitreya.” “Bodhisattva,” said Sanzang, “it is, of course, very good to enjoy wealth and honour with plenty of food and clothes and a family. But what you don't realize is that the religious life has advantages, which are described in this poem: It is no light matter to decide to enter religion: You have to demolish the love and gratitude you felt before. Externals are created no longer, and your mouth is tightly shut. Negative and positive exist within your body. When all has been achieved, you face the golden gates;"
却说长安城外泾河岸边，有两个贤人：一个是渔翁，名唤张稍；一个是樵子，名唤李定。他两个是不登科的进士，能识字的山人。一日，在长安城里，卖了肩上柴，货了篮中鲤，同入酒馆之中，吃了半酣，各携一瓶，顺泾河岸边，徐步而回。张稍道：,"But it was said that there were two wise men on the banks of the Jing River outside Chang'an City: one was a fisherman named Zhang Shao, and the other was a Qiaozi named Li Ding. The two of them were jinshi who did not enter the examination, and mountain men who could read. One day, in the city of Chang'an, he sold firewood on his shoulders and bought carp in the basket. They went into the tavern together, ate half-heartedly, each brought a bottle, and walked back along the bank of the Jing River. Zhang Shao said:","We tell you now about two worthies who lived on the banks of the river Jing outside the city of Chang’an: a fisherman by the name of Zhang Shao and a woodman by the name of Li Ding.1 The two of them were scholars who had passed no official examination, mountain folks who knew how to read. One day in the city of Chang’an, after they had sold the wood on the one’s back and the carp in the other’s basket, they went into a small inn and drank until they were slightly tipsy. Each carrying a bottle, they followed the bank of the Jing River and walked slowly back. “Brother Li,” said Zhang Shao, “in my opinion those who strive for fame will lose their lives on account of fame; those who live in quest of fortune will perish because of riches; those who have titles sleep embracing a tiger; and those who receive official favors walk with snakes in their sleeves.","Zhu the Pig. On his return there was a fierce quarrel between the two, and the pig-like husband ran out of the house in a thousand flames, followed by Sun, who mounted the clouds, and followed him saying, “Where do you go? If you go to heaven, I will follow you. If you go to hell, you cannot escape me there.","We travel now to another riverbank, this time near Chang’an, to eavesdrop on an exchange between two friends—a local fisherman and a woodcutter who lived in the mountains nearby.","One was an old fisherman called Zhang Shao and the other was a woodcutter called Li Ding. They were both advanced scholars who had never taken the official examination, lettered men of the mountains. One day, when Li Ding had sold his load of firewood and Zhang Shao had sold his basketful of carp in Chang'an city, they went into a tavern, drank till they were half tipsy, and strolled slowly home along the banks of the Jing, each holding a bottle in his hand."
却早过了三年，祖师复登宝座，与众说法。谈的是公案比语，论的是外像包皮。忽问：“悟空何在？”悟空近前跪下：“弟子有。”祖师道：“你这一向修些什么道来？”悟空道：“弟子近来法性颇通，根源亦渐坚固矣。”祖师道：“你既通法性，会得根源，已注神体，却只是防备着‘三灾利害’。”悟空听说，沉吟良久道：“师父之言谬矣。我常闻道高德隆，与天同寿，水火既济，百病不生，却怎么有个三灾利害？”祖师道：“此乃非常之道：夺天地之造化，侵日月之玄机；丹成之后，鬼神难容。虽驻颜益寿，但到了五百年后，天降雷灾打你，须要见性明心，预先躲避。躲得过，寿与天齐，躲不过，就此绝命。再五百年后，天降火灾烧你。这火不是天火，亦不是凡火，唤做‘阴火’。自本身涌泉穴下烧起，直透泥垣宫，五脏成灰，四肢皆朽，把千年苦行，俱为虚幻。再五百年，又降风灾吹你。这风不是东南西北风，不是和薰金朔风，亦不是花柳松竹风，唤做‘赑风’。自囟门中吹入六腑，过丹田，穿九窍，骨肉消疏，其身自解。所以都要躲过。”悟空闻说，毛骨悚然，叩头礼拜道：“万老爷垂悯，传与躲避三灾之法，到底不敢忘恩。”祖师道：“此亦无难，只是你比他人不同，故传不得。”悟空道：“我也头圆顶天，足方履地，一般有九窍四肢，五脏六腑，何以比人不同？”祖师道：“你虽然像人，却比人少腮。”原来那猴子孤拐面，凹脸尖嘴。悟空伸手一摸，笑道：“师父没成算！我虽少腮，却比人多这个素袋，亦可准折过也。”祖师说：“也罢，你要学那一般？有一般天罡数，该三十六般变化，有一般地煞数，该七十二般变化。”悟空道：“弟子愿多里捞摸，学一个地煞变化罢。”祖师道：“既如此，上前来，传与你口诀。”遂附耳低言，不知说了些甚么妙法。这猴王也是一窍通时百窍通，当时习了口诀，自修自炼，将七十二般变化，都学成了。,"But three years later, the patriarch returned to the throne and spoke to the public. We are talking about koan bilingualism, and we are talking about the appearance of a foreskin. Suddenly he asked, ""Where is Wukong?"" Wukong knelt down and said, ""Disciple has it."" Patriarch said, ""What kind of Dao have you been cultivating?"" Wukong said, ""Disciple's dharma nature is quite familiar recently, and the roots have become stronger."" The Patriarch said: ""Since you have mastered the nature of the Dharma, you will gain the root, and you have already paid attention to the divine body, but you are only guarding against the 'three disasters'."" When Wukong heard it, he pondered for a long time and said, ""The words of the master are wrong. I often hear about Gao Delong, The same longevity as the sky, water and fire are both beneficial, and all diseases will not arise, but how can there be three disasters and benefits?” The Patriarch said: “This is the extraordinary way: to seize the creation of heaven and earth, to invade the mystery of the sun and the moon; Rong. Although your face will prolong your life, but after 500 years, when a thunderstorm strikes you, you need to see your nature and clear your mind, and avoid it in advance. , A fire from the sky will burn you. This fire is not a fire from the sky, nor is it an ordinary fire. It is called 'yin fire'. It burns from its own Yongquan acupoint and penetrates the mud palace. , all of them are illusory. In another five hundred years, the wind will blow you again. This wind is not the southeast, northwest wind, nor the wind of Hexun Jinshuo, nor the wind of flowers, willows, pine and bamboo. Dantian, through the nine orifices, the flesh and bones disappear, and the body is self-resolved. Therefore, it must be avoided."" Wukong heard that, his hair was horrified, and he kowtowed and said: ""Master Wan is sympathetic, and preached the method of avoiding the three disasters, and dare not be ungrateful. The Patriarch said: ""There is no difficulty in this, but you are different from others, so you can't pass it on."" Wukong said: ""I also have a round head in the sky, and my feet on the ground. Generally, I have nine apertures, four limbs, and five internal organs. How can I compare to a human being? Different?"" The Patriarch said, ""Although you look like a human, you have less cheeks than a human."" It turned out that the monkey had a solitary face with a concave face and a pointed mouth. Wukong stretched out his hand to touch it, smiled and said, ""Master didn't make it! Although I have less cheeks, I have more than a person with this simple bag, and I can also pass it."" The ancestor said: ""Well, do you want to learn that ordinary? There are ordinary Tiangangs. Numbers should change like thirty-six, there are general earth evil numbers, and there should be seventy-two changes."" Wukong said: ""This disciple is willing to dig a lot and learn the transformation of one earth evil."" The Patriarch said: ""If that is the case, come forward. , I will pass on your formula."" Then he whispered in his ear, not knowing what magic tricks he said. This Monkey King is also one-know-how, all-time-hundred-knowing, at that time, he learned the formula, self-training and self-cultivation, and he has learned all seventy-two changes.","Three years went by swiftly, and the Patriarch again mounted his throne to lecture to the multitude. He discussed the scholastic deliberations and parables, and he discoursed on the integument of external conduct. Suddenly he asked, “Where’s Wukong?” Wukong drew near and knelt down. “Your pupil’s here,” he said. “What sort of art have you been practicing lately?” the Patriarch asked. “Recently,” Wukong said, “your pupil has begun to apprehend the nature of all things and my foundational knowledge has become firmly established.” “If you have penetrated to the dharma nature to apprehend the origin,” said the Patriarch, “you have, in fact, entered into the divine substance. You need, however, to guard against the danger of three calamities.” When Wukong heard this, he thought for a long time and said, “The words of the master must be erroneous. I have frequently heard that when one is learned in the Way and excels in virtue, he will enjoy the same age as Heaven; fire and water cannot harm him and every kind of disease will vanish. How can there be this danger of three calamities?” “What you have learned,” said the Patriarch, “is no ordinary magic: you have stolen the creative powers of Heaven and Earth and invaded the dark mysteries of the sun and moon. Your success in perfecting the elixir is something that the gods and the demons cannot countenance. Though your appearance will be preserved and your age lengthened, after five hundred years Heaven will send down the calamity of thunder to strike you. Hence you must be intelligent and wise enough to avoid it ahead of time. If you can escape it, your age will indeed equal that of Heaven; if not, your life will thus be finished. After another five hundred years Heaven will send down the calamity of fire to burn you. That fire is neither natural nor common fire; its name is the Fire of Yin, and it arises from within the soles of your feet to reach even the cavity of your heart, reducing your entrails to ashes and your limbs to utter ruin. The arduous labor of a millennium will then have been made completely superfluous. After another five hundred years the calamity of wind will be sent to blow at you. It is not the wind from the north, south, east, or west; nor is it one of the winds of four seasons; nor is it the wind of flowers, willows, pines, and bamboos. It is called the Mighty Wind, and it enters from the top of the skull into the body, passes through the midriff, and penetrates the nine apertures.12 The bones and the flesh will be dissolved and the body itself will disintegrate. You must therefore avoid all three calamities.” When Wukong heard this, his hairs stood on end, and, kowtowing reverently, he said, “I beg the master to be merciful and impart to me the method to avoid the three calamities. To the very end, I shall never forget your gracious favor.” The Patriarch said, “It is not, in fact, difficult, except that I cannot teach you because you are somewhat different from other people.” “I have a round head pointing to Heaven,” said Wukong, “and square feet walking on Earth. Similarly, I have nine apertures and four limbs, entrails and cavities. In what way am I different from other people?” The Patriarch said, “Though you resemble a man, you have much less jowl.” The monkey, you see, has an angular face with hollow cheeks and a pointed mouth. Stretching his hand to feel himself, Wukong laughed and said, “The master does not know how to balance matters! Though I have much less jowl than human beings, I have my pouch, which may certainly be considered a compensation.” “Very well, then,” said the Patriarch, “what method of escape would you like to learn? There is the Art of the Heavenly Ladle, which numbers thirty-six transformations, and there is the Art of the Earthly Multitude, which numbers seventy-two transformations.” Wukong said, “Your pupil is always eager to catch more fishes, so I’ll learn the Art of the Earthly Multitude.” “In that case,” said the Patriarch, “come up here, and I’ll pass on the oral formulas to you.” He then whispered something into his ear, though we do not know what sort of wondrous secrets he spoke of. But this Monkey King was someone who, knowing one thing, could understand a hundred! He immediately learned the oral formulas and, after working at them and practicing them himself, he mastered all seventy-two transformations.","The Seeker of Secrets, having learnt the three secrets of Immortality: mind and spirit and abstinence from sex, memorized these carefully, and went on studying alone for three years more. Then the Master again mounted the platform and preached on the Parable of the Great Judgment. Suddenly he asked, “Where is the Seeker of Secrets?” The Monkey King came forward, knelt and said, “I am here.” The Master asked, “What have you been learning all this time?” “Your disciple has mastered the study of the spiritual nature.” The Master said, “Then you know the origin of things. But you must be careful of three great dangers.” The Seeker of Secrets, after pondering over this for a long time said, “I have constantly heard it said that when one has found Truth and Virtue, then one becomes an Immortal and no sickness can befall him; how then do you speak of dangers to be avoided?” The Master said, “What I teach you is not an ordinary doctrine, for it controls the forces of Heaven and Earth and the secrets of the sun, moon, and stars. When one has arrived at this stage, then one is superior to the evil spirits and the ordinary gods. Still after a time there will come a thunderclap to try your soul and spirit. If unmoved and unshaken in the deluge, you will be like Heaven itself. If you doubt, then you perish. After a long practice of religion again, one is tried a second time. This danger does not come from Heaven, nor from man, but from one’s own passions. It burns one’s whole body to ashes, and all one’s long years of practice are in vain like a dream. After another long term of practice, one is tried a third time by the danger of environment, which blows on one like a typhoon and affects one’s whole being. This must be overcome.” When the Seeker of Secrets heard this his body shook and his hair stood on end. “Oh Master, have pity on me, and tell me how to overcome these three dangers, and I shall never forget your kindness.” The Master said, “That is not difficult. There are two ways to avoid them. One has 36 wonders, the other 72; which do you wish to know?” The Seeker of Secrets said, “I wish to know the 72 wonders.” “Come here then, and I will teach you the incantation.” Then he whispered it in his ear. The Monkey King felt influences going through every pore of his body, and began to practice the arts and to learn the whole 72 wonders.","Another three years passed before Subodhi reappeared to teach his disciples. He spoke of academic debates and parables and of external self-cultivation. “Where’s Monkey?” he suddenly asked. Monkey kneeled before him. “Here I am!” “What have you been working on of late?” “The basics of immortality: the nature and origins of all things.” “In that case, you have already penetrated the divine substance of matter. But beware of the peril of the three calamities.” Monkey mulled this over for a while. “Master is surely mistaken,” he eventually responded. “I thought that anyone who has learned the Way and is rich in virtue will live as long as Heaven itself. Neither fire, nor water, nor illness can harm him. What three calamities do you speak of?” “What you have learned is not ordinary magic. You have stolen the creative power of heaven and earth itself, and penetrated the dark formulae of the sun and the moon. Ghosts and spirits will seek to bring you down. Although you have extended your life, in five hundred years’ time Heaven will unleash the calamity of thunder at you. You must seek wisdom to prevent this peril. Succeed and you will live as long as Heaven itself. Fail and you will die. In another five hundred years, Heaven will rain the calamity of the cold, dark fire of yin. It burns from the soles of your feet to the cavity of your heart. It will reduce your entrails to ashes and your limbs to ruins. Your millennium of hard work will then be as dust and nothingness. After another five hundred years, Heaven will set the calamity of wind onto you. This is no earthly wind. It enters through the fontanels, blows through the six internal organs, midriff, and nine orifices. Your flesh and bones will dissolve and your body will disintegrate. You see, then, why I recommend avoiding these calamities.” Monkey’s fur stood on end. “Tell me how to escape these horrors!” “Normally, this would be perfectly simple. But as you are an unusual specimen, I fear I cannot teach you.” “I’ve a head at the top and feet at the bottom, nine apertures, four limbs, five viscera, and six internal organs. How am I unusual?” “You bear a superficial resemblance to humans, but your cheeks are abnormally flat.” (Monkeys have rather angular faces, with sunken cheeks and pointed muzzles.) Monkey patted his face combatively. “Appearances can be deceptive. My cheek pouches have storage capacity on the inside. I demand parity.” “Fair enough,” considered Subodhi. “Which escape do you want to learn? There’s the Art of the Big Dipper, which involves thirty-six transformations, or the Art of the Earthly Multitude, which involves seventy-two.” “The more the merrier,” considered Monkey. “I’ll take the second.” “Come over here, then, and I will tell you the formula.” No one knows what Subodhi whispered into Monkey’s ear. But our hero was someone who could learn a hundred things from a single explanation. He immediately memorized the magic and, after practicing on his own, mastered the seventy-two transformations.","After three years had passed in this way the Patriarch once more sat on his lecturing throne and expounded the Dharma to the students. He recounted famous sayings and parables, and discussed external phenomena and external appearances. Without warning he asked, “Where is Sun Wukong?” Sun Wukong went forward, knelt down and replied, “Your disciple is present.” “What Way have you cultivated since coming here?” “Your disciple is now fairly well conversant with the Dharma,” Sun Wukong replied, “and my Source is getting gradually stronger.” “If you are conversant with the Dharma and you know about the Source,” the Patriarch replied, “and if the spirit has already flowed into you, then you must beware of the 'Three Disasters.'” Sun Wukong thought for a long time, then he said, “Patriarch, you're talking rubbish. I have often heard that the Way is lofty and its power mighty, that it is as eternal as Heaven, that it can overcome fire and water, and prevent all illnesses from arising, so how could there be “Three Disasters?'” To this the Patriarch replied, “This is not the ordinary Way: it involves seizing the very creation of Heaven and Earth, and encroaching on the hidden workings of the sun and moon. Once the elixir is made, devils and spirits cannot tolerate it. Although it will preserve the youthfulness of your face and prolong your life, in five hundred years' time Heaven will strike you with a thunderbolt. You must be clear-sighted in nature and mind, so that you can hide from it before it comes. If you succeed in avoiding it you will live as long as Heaven; and if you don't, it will kill you. Another five hundred years later Heaven will burn you with fire. This fire will be not heavenly fire or ordinary fire but 'hidden fire'. It will burn you from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head; your five viscera will be reduced to ashes, your four limbs will be destroyed, and a thousand years of asceticism will have been so much wasted time. Yet another five hundred years later a wind will blow at you. It will not be the North, South, East, or West wind, nor will it be a warm, fragrant wind from the Northwest; nor will it be the kind of wind that blows among flowers, willows, pine, and bamboo. It will be what is called a 'monster wind'. It will blow through the crown of your head down into your six entrails. It will go through the Cinnabar Field below your navel and penetrate your nine orifices. Your flesh and your bones will be destroyed and your body will disintegrate. So you must avoid all three of these disasters.” When he heard this Sun Wukong's hair stood on end, and he kowtowed with the words, “I implore you, my lord, to show pity and teach me how to avoid these three disasters. If you do I will be grateful to you for ever.” “That would be easy,” the Patriarch replied, “but for the fact that you are different from other people—which means that I can't.” “I have a head that faces the sky and feet standing on earth,” said Sun Wukong. “I have nine orifices and four limbs, five viscera and six entrails. How am I different from anyone else?” “Although you are quite like other people, your cheeks are too small.” Now the Monkey had a funny face, with cheeks that caved inwards and a sharp chin. Sun Wukong felt it with his hand and replied with a laugh, “Master, you didn't take everything into account. Although I'm a bit short of jaw, I've got more dewlap than other people to make up for it.” “Very well then,” the Patriarch said, “which would you prefer to learn: the thirty-six heavenly transformations or the seventy-two earthly ones?” “Your disciple wants to get as much out of it as he can, so I would like to learn the seventy-two earthly ones.” “If that's what you want,” the Patriarch replied, “come here and I'll teach you the spells.” Thereupon he whispered into Sun Wukong's ear, and who knows what miraculous spells he taught him? The Monkey King was the sort of person who understands everything once he is told a tiny part, and he learned the spells on the spot. He practiced and trained until he had mastered all seventy-two transformations."

His wind is incomparable to the spring and autumn wind, the pine and bamboo wind, and the east-west north-south wind. ""Bajie said:","“A young priest like you, why do you lie? The wind of that Great King Yellow Wind is most fearsome, not comparable with any spring-autumn wind, pine-and-bamboo wind, or the wind coming from the four quarters.” “I suppose,” said Eight Rules, “it must be brain-bursting wind, goat-ear wind, leprous wind, or migrainous wind!”",,Monkey looked nonplussed. “Don’t you recognize me?” Wish Fulfillment segued. “Should I?”,"“How could you tell such lies, a reverend gentleman, and so young a one at that? The Great King of the Yellow Wind's hurricane is really terrible. It can't be compared with spring winds, autumn winds, pine and bamboo winds, or North, South, East and West winds.” “It must be a brain-snatching wind,” interrupted Pig, “or a goat's ear wind, or a hemp wind, or a head-twisting wind.”"
师徒们宴罢，老高将一红漆丹盘，拿出二百两散碎金银，奉三位长老为途中之费；又将三领绵布褊衫，为上盖之衣。三藏道：“我们是行脚僧，遇庄化饭，逢处求斋，怎敢受金银财帛？”行者近前，轮开手，抓了一把，叫：“高才，昨日累你引我师父，今日招了一个徒弟，无物谢你，把这些碎金碎银，权作带领钱，拿了去买草鞋穿。以后但有妖精，多作成我几个，还有谢你处哩。”高才接了，叩头谢赏。老高又道：“师父们既不受金银，望将这粗衣笑纳，聊表寸心。”三藏又道：“我出家人，若受了一丝之贿，千劫难修。只是把席上吃不了的饼果，带些去做干粮足矣。”八戒在旁边道：“师父、师兄，你们不要便罢，我与他家做了这几年女婿，就是挂脚粮也该三石哩。丈人啊，我的直裰，昨晚被师兄扯破了，与我一件青锦袈裟，鞋子绽了，与我一双好新鞋子。”高老闻言，不敢不与，随买一双新鞋，将一领褊衫，换下旧时衣物。那八戒摇摇摆摆，对高老唱个喏道：“上复丈母、大姨、二姨并姨夫、姑舅诸亲：我今日去做和尚了，不及面辞，休怪。丈人啊，你还好生看待我浑家，只怕我们取不成经时，好来还俗，照旧与你做女婿过活。”行者喝道：“夯货，却莫胡说！”八戒道：“哥呵，不是胡说，只恐一时间有些儿差池，却不是和尚误了做，老婆误了娶，两下里都耽搁了？”三藏道：“少题闲话，我们赶早儿去来。”遂此收拾了一担行李，八戒担着；,"After the master and apprentice feast, Lao Gao took out a red lacquer elixir plate, took out 200 taels of scattered gold and silver, and paid the three elders for the journey; Sanzang said: ""We are walking monks. We turn to villagers to cook rice, and we ask for fast food everywhere. How dare we accept gold, silver, wealth, and silk?"" Master, I hired an apprentice today, I have nothing to thank you for, take these pieces of gold and silver, and use them as the leading money to buy straw sandals to wear. In the future, if there are goblins, make me a few more, and thank you."" Gao Cai took it, kowtow and thanked him. Lao Gao said again: ""Masters don't accept gold and silver, so I hope you will accept these rough clothes with a smile."" Sanzang said again: ""If I am a monk, if I take a bribe, it will be hard to repair. I just eat it on the table. If you don’t have any cakes and fruits, bring some to make dry food.” Ba Jie said beside him: “Master, senior brother, don’t let it go, I have been son-in-law with his family for a few years, and it should be three stone miles even if we are left with food. Father-in-law, my straight robe was torn by my senior brother last night, and I have a green brocade cassock with me, and the shoes are broken, and I have a pair of good new shoes."" When the old man heard the words, he didn't dare to refuse, so he bought a new pair of shoes. , put a shirt on and change out of old clothes. The Bajie swayed and sang to the old man: ""Shangfu's mother-in-law, aunt, second aunt, uncle, uncle and relatives: I am going to be a monk today. Haosheng looks at my Hun family, I'm afraid that when we can't get the scriptures, it's good to return to the world and live with you as a son-in-law."" The traveler shouted: ""Hold the goods, but don't talk nonsense!"" Bajie said: ""Brother, it's not nonsense, I'm just afraid The time is a little short, but it’s not that the monk did it by mistake, and the wife missed the marriage, and it was delayed twice?” Sanzang said, “Let’s gossip, let’s get there early.” So he packed a load of luggage, and Bajie was carrying it. ;","After master and disciples had been feted, old Mr. Gao took out a red lacquered tray bearing some two hundred taels of gold and silver in small pieces, which were to be presented to the three priests for travel expenses. There were, moreover, three outer garments made of fine silk. Tripitaka said, “We are mendicants who beg for food and drink from village to village. How could we accept gold, silver, and precious clothing?” Coming forward and stretching out his hand, Pilgrim took a handful of the money, saying, “Gao Cai, yesterday you took the trouble to bring my master here, with the result that we made a disciple today. We have nothing to thank you with. Take this as remuneration for being a guide; perhaps you can use it to buy a few pairs of straw sandals. If there are any more monsters, turn them over to me and I’ll truly be grateful to you.” Gao Cai took the money and kowtowed to thank Pilgrim for his reward. Old Mr. Gao then said, “If the masters do not want the silver and gold, please accept at least these three simple garments, which are but small tokens of our goodwill.” “If those of us who have left the family,” said Tripitaka again, “accept the bribe of a single strand of silk, we may fall into ten thousand kalpas from which we may never recover. It is quite sufficient that we take along the leftovers from the table as provisions on our way.” Eight Rules spoke up from the side: “Master, Elder Brother, you may not want these things. But I was a son-in-law in this household for several years, and the payment for my services should be worth more than three stones of rice! Father, my shirt was torn by Elder Brother last night; please give me a cassock of blue silk. My shoes are worn also, so please give me a good pair of new shoes.” When old Mr. Gao heard that, he dared not refuse; a new pair of shoes and a cassock were purchased at once so that Eight Rules could dispose of the old attire. Swaggering around, our Eight Rules spoke amiably to old Mr. Gao, saying, “Please convey my humble sentiments to my mother-in-law, my great-aunt, my second aunt, and my uncle-in-law, and all my other relatives. Today I am going away as a monk, and please do not blame me if I cannot take leave of them in person. Father, do take care of my better half. If we fail in our quest for scriptures, I’ll return to secular life and live with you again as your son-in-law.” “Coolie!” shouted Pilgrim. “Stop babbling nonsense!” “It’s not nonsense,” said Eight Rules. “Sometimes I fear that things may go wrong, and then I could end up unable either to be a monk or to take a wife, losing out on both counts.” “Less of this idle conversation!” said Tripitaka. “We must hurry up and leave.” They packed their luggage, and Eight Rules was told to carry the load with a pole.",,"Monkey grabbed Sandy with his left hand and Pigsy with his right, crashed through the door, and rode his cloud straight back to the Well of Wisdom. Anxious not to disturb Tripitaka, they repaired quietly to bed and slept soundly until dawn. When day broke, Tripitaka dressed in his brocade robe and told his disciples that they needed to go to court to have their travel documents stamped. The three of them pulled on their clothes and braced themselves for trouble. As anticipated, as soon as the four pilgrims were presented to the throne, the king’s face darkened. “Why haven’t these Buddhists been arrested?” “They come from the Tang empire in China,” a royal tutor intervened, “a great country some ten thousand miles from here. The road to China is infested with monsters and fiends. These monks must have extraordinary magical powers to have undertaken such a journey. I beg Your Majesty to allow them through.” Just as the king had agreed to look at their travel papers, however, the official keeper of the door announced the arrival of the three state preceptors. The flustered king immediately put the documents away, stood up, and ordered his attendants to set out stools with embroidered seats. The three chief Taoists—the pilgrims’ nemeses from the night before—strutted up to the throne, while the king and his courtiers bowed deeply. “To what do we owe this unexpected honor?” asked the king. The Taoists glared at Tripitaka and company without responding to the king. “Where did those four come from?” “They’re Buddhists from the Tang empire, headed for India. They’re here to have their travel documents approved,” the king responded. “Ha!” The Taoists clapped their hands with grim satisfaction. “Have they offended you in some way?”","When master and disciples had eaten, Squire Gao brought pieces of gold and silver to the weight of two hundred ounces on a red lacquer tray and offered them to the three pilgrims to help with the expenses of their journey. Then he produced three brocade-collared gowns that could serve as overcoats. “We are mendicant monks,” said Sanzang, “Who beg for our food in the villages and other places through which we pass, so we could not possibly accept gold, silver, or cloth.” Monkey then marched up and grabbed a handful of the money. Then he addressed the young man Gao Cai. “Yesterday,” he said, “I troubled you to lead my master here, and today he has recruited another disciple, but we have been unable to show our gratitude. So take these pieces of gold and silver as your fee for guiding us, and buy yourself a pair of straw sandals. If you have any more evil spirits in future, and you help us again, we'll be able to show even more appreciation.” The young man Gao Cai took the gold and silver, then kowtowed to express his thanks. “If you won't take gold or silver,” Squire Gao said, “please be good enough to accept these rough clothes as a mark of our gratitude.” “If we monks accepted a single thread, we would have to atone for it for a thousand ages,” replied Sanzang. “It will suffice if we take the pancakes and fruit that we haven't eaten with us as provisions for the journey.” “Master, elder brother,” said Pig, who was standing beside them, “it's all right for you two to refuse them, but I was a son-in-law in this family for several years, and I deserves three bushels of grain to take with me. On yes, father-in-law, my tunic was torn by elder brother yesterday and my shoes have split, so please give me a black brocade cassock and a good pair of new shoes.” Old Squire Gao, who could scarcely refuse this request, gave him the new shoes and a tunic in exchange for his old ones. Pig swaggered over to Old Gao, chanted a “na-a-aw” of respect, and said, “Please inform my mother-in-law, my sisters-in-law, my brothers-in-law, and my uncles that I have become a monk today, and ask them to excuse me for not saying good-bye to them in person. Father-in-law, look after my wife well. If we don't get the scriptures, I'll go back to lay life and work for you as a son-in-law again.” “Moron,” shouted Monkey, “stop talking nonsense.” “I'm doing nothing of the sort,” Pig replied, “I am thinking that if things go wrong I'd be wasting my time as a monk, and my wife's marriage would have been ruined, both for nothing.” “Enough of your idle chatter,” said Sanzang, “let's be on our way at once.” Their luggage was hung from a carrying-pole on pig's shoulders."

He was in the place where he couldn't be killed when he suddenly saw an old man coming with a cane in hand. Walking forward, with a flick of his hand, the ropes were all broken, and he blew a sigh of relief from the opposite side. Sanzang Fangsu knelt down and said: ""Thank you, old man! Save the poor monk's life!"" The old man replied: ""Get up. Have you ever neglected? What?"" Sanzang said:","Soon the sun rose high in the sky, but Tripitaka was still in a stupor, unable to discern which way was north, south, east, or west. In that half-dead condition, he suddenly saw an old man approaching, holding a staff in his hands. Walking up to Tripitaka, the man waved his hands and all the ropes snapped. He then blew on Tripitaka, and the monk began to revive. Falling on the ground, he said, “I thank the aged father for saving the life of this poor monk!” “Get up,” the old man said, returning his salute, “have you lost anything?” “The followers of your poor monk,” said Tripitaka, “have been eaten by the monsters.","The demon tried to escape by the North, by the South, by the East, and by the West, but in all these efforts he was baffled.

The Magic Fan was given to Sun, who tested its magic. After the first shake, the flames of the mountain died out. After the second shake a cool gentle breeze arose.

After exchanging courtesies, the dragon invited Monkey to take a seat. “I did hear that your jail term was up—forgive me for being late to offer my congratulations. I imagine that you have returned to your old haunt on Flower-Fruit Mountain?” “I did think of that, but then I decided to become a Buddhist monk. ” “Oh, really?” queried the dragon king. “Well, I owed Guanyin a favor, and she said I should escort the Tang emperor’s scripture pilgrim, Tripitaka, to the west.” “Good for you!” applauded the dragon king. “So what are you doing here, then?” “Tripitaka didn’t appreciate me.","A moment later the red sun rose high in the sky, but Sanzang was too befuddled to know where he was. Just when all seemed lost, an old man appeared, walking towards him with the help of a stick. He came up to Sanzang, broke all his bonds with a wave of his hand, and revived him by blowing into his face. Sanzang fell to his knees and bowed low to him, saying, “Thank you, venerable ancient, for saving my humble life.” The old man returned his bow and said, “Get up. Have you lost anything?” “My attendants have been eaten by monsters, and I don't know where my baggage or my horse is,” replied Sanzang."

The idiot took off the blue brocade cloth straight jacket, took the shirt, and put it on his body. Before he tied the belt, he jumped and fell to the ground. It turned out that several ropes were tightly taut. The idiot was in unbearable pain, and these people were long gone.","“Fine! Fine! Fine!” said Eight Rules. “Bring out all three undershirts and let me try them on. If all fit me, they can all have me.” The woman went inside and took out one undershirt, which she handed over to Eight Rules. Taking off his blue silk shirt, Idiot took up the undergarment and draped it over his body at once. Before he had managed to tie the strings, however, he suddenly fell to the floor. The undershirt, you see, had changed into several pieces of rope which had him tightly bound. As he lay there in unbearable pain, the women vanished.",,"“All right, give me my wife’s weapons!” The maids handed over the two blue-bladed swords. Taking off the duck-green silk-velvet jacket he’d worn to the banquet, King Bull Demon tightened his belt and headed straight for Flame Mountain. Soon enough, he caught up with Monkey, who was strolling merrily along toward Flame Mountain with the enormous fan on his shoulders. So he even swindled my wife out of the trick for enlarging the fan? Bull Demon thought. No good asking him for it directly—he’ll just fan me into oblivion. I understand that he has two comrades, a pig and a sand-spirit, both of whom I knew back when they were demons. I’m going to impersonate the pig, to give that monkey a taste of his own medicine. I’ll bet he’s too pleased with himself to recognize me. Bull Demon, you see, had also mastered seventy-two transformations; he was pretty much a match for Monkey in terms of skill set, though a little slower and heavier on his feet. He turned himself into the exact likeness of Pigsy, took a shortcut to get ahead, and made straight for the self-satisfied simian.","“Great, great, great,” said Pig. “Bring out all three shirts for me to try on, and if I can get them all on, I'll marry them all. ” The woman went back inside, and brought out only one shirt, which she handed to Pig. The idiot took off his own black cloth tunic and pulled on the shirt, but before he could tie the belt at the waist he fell to the ground with a thump and found himself tightly bound with many ropes. He was in great pain, and the women had all disappeared."

""Bajie said: ""Brother, do you see how heavy this luggage is?"" The walker said: ""Brother, since I have you and the sand monk, I have never carried it, how much does it weigh?"" ""Bajie said: ""Brother, look at the number: four pieces of yellow vines, eight long and short ropes. It is necessary to prevent rain and rain, and three or four layers of felt. The plaque is still slippery, and nails are nailed on both ends. A nine-ringed staff with copper inlaid iron, and a large cloak wrapped in silk vines. With such a lot of luggage, it is difficult for the old pig to carry a daily home, but you and Master are apprentices, and you use me as a long-term worker! The walker smiled and said, ""Fool, who are you talking to? ""Bajie said: ""Brother, let me tell you. ""Walker said:"" I told you wrong. Old Sun only cares about Master, you and Sha Seng are in charge of luggage and horses. But if you ignore it a little bit, you will get a rough stick on Guguai first!

How would I know its weight?” “Ah! Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “just count the things here: Four yellow rattan mats; Long and short, eight ropes in all. To guard against dampness and rain, There are blankets—three, four layers! The flat pole’s too slippery, perhaps? You add nails on nails at both ends! Cast in iron and copper, the nine-ringed priestly staff. Made of bamboo and rattan, the long, large cloak. With all this luggage, you should pity old Hog, who has to walk all day carrying it! You only are the disciple of our master: I’ve been made into a long-term laborer!” “Idiot!” said Pilgrim with a laugh, “to whom are you protesting?” “To you, Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules. “If you’re protesting to me,” said Pilgrim, “you’ve made a mistake! Old Monkey is solely concerned with Master’s safety, whereas you and Sha Monk have the special responsibility of looking after the luggage and the horse. If you ever slack off, you’ll get a good whipping in the shanks from this huge rod!”",,"and that’s how I ended up here. How far is it back to Flame Mountain from here?” Lingji seemed to find this whole story enormously entertaining. “Princess Iron-Fan’s Palm-Leaf Fan,” he explained with a smile, “was created by heaven and earth back when chaos divided and Pan Gu built the universe. It’s made of magic leaves of supreme yin—darkness and cold—which is why it can extinguish all fires. It can fan a single human eighty-four thousand miles. Sumeru’s only fifty thousand miles from Flame Mountain, so you did very well to stop here.” “Impressive,” admitted Monkey. “But now what am I to do?” “Don’t worry,” Lingji consoled him. “Some years back, the Buddha gave me a treasure for this very situation: the wind-stilling elixir, which will enable you to resist her fan. You can then take the fan, extinguish the fire, and carry on to the west.” He fished out of his sleeve the magic pellet, which he sewed firmly onto the underside of Monkey’s collar. “Not a moment to lose!”","If you want to be a monk, you have to suffer—it's the only way of being a true disciple.” “How heavy do you think this load is?” Pig asked. “I haven't carried it since you and Friar Sand joined us, so how should I know?” Monkey replied. “Just add it up,” said Pig. “There are Four bundles wrapped in yellow bamboo mats, Eight ropes of assorted lengths. Then, to keep out rain and damp, Three or four layers of felt around it The carrying-pole is terrible slippery With nails at either end. Then there's a bronze and iron nine-ringed staff And a cape made of bamboo and creeper. With all this luggage to carry day after day of course I find the going heavy. While you're allowed to be the master's disciple, I'm treated as a hired hand.” “Who do you think you're talking to, idiot?” Monkey asked. “I'm talking to you, elder brother,” said Pig. “You shouldn't be complaining about this to me,” Monkey replied. “My job is to look after the master's safety, while you and Friar Sand look after the horse and the luggage. And if there's any slacking from you, you'll feel a heavy stick about you ankles.”"
此榜行至海州地方，有一人姓陈名萼，表字光蕊，见了此榜，即时回家，对母张氏道：“朝廷颁下黄榜，诏开南省，考取贤才，孩儿意欲前去应试。倘得一官半职，显亲扬名，封妻荫子，光耀门闾，乃儿之志也。特此禀告母亲前去。”张氏道：“我儿读书人，‘幼而学，壮而行’，正该如此。但去赴举，路上须要小心，得了官，早早回来。”光蕊便吩咐家僮收拾行李，即拜辞母亲，趱程前进。到了长安，正值大开选场，光蕊就进场。考毕中选，及廷试三策，唐王御笔亲赐状元，跨马游街三日。不期游到丞相殷开山门首，有丞相所生一女，名唤温娇，又名满堂娇，未曾婚配，正高结彩楼，抛打绣球卜婿。适值陈光蕊在楼下经过，小姐一见光蕊人材出众，知是新科状元，心内十分欢喜，就将绣球抛下，恰打着光蕊的乌纱帽。猛听得一派笙箫细乐，十数个婢妾走下楼来，把光蕊马头挽住，迎状元入相府成婚。那丞相和夫人，即时出堂，唤宾人赞礼，将小姐配与光蕊。拜了天地，夫妻交拜毕，又拜了岳丈岳母。丞相吩咐安排酒席，欢饮一宵。,"This list went to Haizhou, and there was a person named Chen Mingcai, whose name was Guangrui. When he saw this list, he went home immediately and said to his mother Zhang: ""The imperial court issued the Yellow List, and ordered the opening of the South Province, to be admitted for talents, my son. I want to go to take the exam. If I get a half-official position, show my relatives and make a name for myself, seal my wife and my son, and honor my family, this is my son's ambition. I hereby tell my mother to go."" Learn, be strong and walk', that's how it should be. But you have to be careful on the road when you go to Jue, get an official, come back early."" Guangrui ordered the boy to pack his luggage, bid farewell to his mother, and move forward. When he arrived in Chang'an, it was the time when the election was open, and Guangrui entered the field. After completing the exam, he was selected, and the three strategies of the court test were given to the champion by the royal pen of Tang Wang, who walked across the street for three days. Unexpectedly, he swims to the head of the prime minister Yin Kaishan. There is a daughter born to the prime minister. The name is Wen Jiao, also known as Man Tang Jiao. She has never been married. When Chen Guangrui passed by downstairs, the lady was very happy when she saw that Guangrui had outstanding talents and knew that she was the champion of the new department, so she threw the hydrangea down and put on Guangrui's black gauze hat. Hearing the sound of music, dozens of maids and concubines came downstairs, held Guangrui's horse's head, and welcomed the champion into the prime minister's mansion to get married. The prime minister and his wife immediately left the hall, called the guests to praise, and matched the young lady with Guangrui. After worshipping heaven and earth, the husband and wife paid their respects, and then they worshipped their husband-in-law and mother-in-law. The prime minister ordered to arrange a banquet and drink happily all night.","This summons reached the place Haizhou, where it was seen by a certain man named Chen E (with the courtesy name of Guangrui), who then went straight home to talk to his mother, whose maiden name was Zhang. “The court,” he said, “has sent a yellow summons, declaring in these southern provinces that there will be examinations for the selection of the worthy and the talented. Your child wishes to try out at such an examination, for if I manage to acquire an appointment, or even half a post, I would become more of a credit to my parents, magnify our name, give my wife a title, benefit my son, and bring glory to this house of ours. Such is the aspiration of your son: I wish to tell my mother plainly before I leave.” “My son,” said she of the Zhang family, “an educated person ‘learns when he is young, but leaves when he is grown.’ You should indeed follow this maxim. But as you go to the examination, you must be careful on the way, and, when you have secured a post, come home quickly.” So Guangrui gave instructions for his family page to pack his bags, took leave of his mother, and began his journey. When he reached Chang’an, the examination site had just been opened, and he went straight in. He took the preliminary tests, passed them, and went to the court examination, where in three sessions on administrative policy he took first place, receiving the title “zhuangyuan,” the certificate of which was signed by the Tang emperor’s own hand. As was the custom, he was led through the streets on horseback for three days. The procession at one point passed by the house of the chief minister, Yin Kaishan, who had a daughter named Wenjiao, nicknamed Mantangjiao (A Hall of Loveliness). She was not yet married, and at this time she was just about to throw down an embroidered ball from high up on a festooned tower in order to select her spouse. It happened that Chen Guangrui was passing below the tower. When the young maiden saw Guangrui’s outstanding appearance and knew that he was the recent zhuangyuan of the examinations, she was very pleased. She threw down the embroidered ball, which just happened to hit the black gauze hat of Guangrui. Immediately, lively music of pipes and flutes could be heard throughout the area as scores of maids and serving-girls ran down from the tower, took hold of the bridle of Guangrui’s horse, and led him into the residence of the chief minister for the wedding. The chief minister and his wife at once came out of their chambers, called together the guests and the master of ceremonies, and gave the girl to Guangrui as his bride. Together, they bowed to Heaven and Earth; then husband and wife bowed to each other, before bowing to the father- and mother-in-law. The chief minister then gave a big banquet and everyone feasted merrily for a whole evening, after which the two of them walked hand in hand into the bridal chamber.","These are called the Six Paths of Transmigration. The good ascend in their progress, the faithful are reborn in the way of the honorable, the filial are reborn to happiness, the righteous are born among men, the virtuous are born rich, but the bad will fall to Hell and into the pathways of demons.” The emperor nodded his head and took careful note of this. The Judge then led the emperor to the path of rebirth that led to honor, and, bowing to him, said, “Your Majesty, this is your way out, your humble officer must now return, but I have ordered Executioner Zhao to accompany you one stage more.” The emperor thanked him for accompanying him all this long way. The Judge said, “When your Majesty returns to earth, you must on no account forget to found the Society for the Salvation of Souls. If there are no complaints in Hell, then the people on earth shall enjoy happiness. If all evils are redressed, and all men instructed how to be good, then I guarantee that your descendants will be long lived and your Empire permanently safe.” The emperor took note of each of these things and bade the Judge farewell. He then followed the Executioner and with him entered the gate. The Executioner saw a horse inside the gate, already saddled, and urged the emperor to mount it. When the Executioner had helped him up, the horse went off like an arrow and soon arrived at the banks of the Wei River. In the water were a pair of golden carp playing together. At this sight the emperor was delighted, stopped the horse and seemed as if he would never tire of watching them. The Executioner said, “Your Majesty had better let the horse go on, so that we may enter the city early.” But the emperor was loath to leave the spot. The Executioner then gave the horse a kick and shouted out, “Why do you not go, what are you waiting for?” With this he gave a push, and the horse plunged into the Wei River, and thus the emperor left the territory of Hell, and returned among living men. At that time both the civil and military officials were gathered together about the heir, and the Empress Dowager and palace ladies were at the White Tiger Hall, weeping, and discussing how to put forth an edict about the emperor’s death, so as to inform the whole empire, and announce the accession of the heir to the throne. But Minister Wei said, “Let us wait one day more before doing this, as the emperor’s soul is sure to return to his body.”","When a gentleman called Guangrui from Haizhou learned of the imminent exam session, he immediately asked his mother’s permission to attend. “If I were lucky enough to earn an official posting, it would enhance our family’s reputation, and benefit my future wife and sons.” “You’re ready for this,” his mother—a lady surnamed Zhang—agreed. “But take care, and come back as soon as you’ve been given a job.” Guangrui reached Chang’an just in time for the start of the exams and, when the results came out, discovered that he had come in first. After receiving a certificate signed by the emperor himself, he was toured on horseback through the streets of the capital for three whole days. The procession passed by the house of Yin Kaishan, one of Taizong’s chief ministers, who had a captivatingly pretty, unmarried daughter called Wenjiao. At the very moment that Guangrui passed beneath, Wenjiao was about to drop an embroidered ball from a decorated tower; whomever it chanced to hit would be her husband. The moment she laid eyes on Guangrui, Wenjiao could see that he was an exceptional young man, a first impression corroborated by his ranking top in the civil service exam. Not coincidentally, the embroidered ball scored a direct hit against Guangrui’s black silk hat. A symphony of pipes and flutes erupted, and an army of maidservants rushed out of the building, grabbed the bridle of Guangrui’s horse, and welcomed the examination star into the house of his future in-laws. Yin Kaishan and his wife immediately summoned guests and a master of ceremonies, and married the young lady off to Guangrui. The new couple bowed to heaven and earth, to each other, and to the girl’s parents. The minister gave a huge banquet and, after an evening’s revelry, the new couple retired hand in hand to the bridal chamber.","When this notice reached the district of Haizhou it was seen by a man called Chen E, whose courtesy name was Guangrui. He returned home and said to Madame Zhang, his mother, “The court has issued a yellow notice saying that the Chancellery will be opened for an examination to select men of wisdom and talent. Your child wants to go and take part. If I am given an official post it will bring me fame and make our family illustrious; my wife will be given a title, my sons will be given preferential treatment; and it will bring glory to our house. Such is my ambition; and I have come to tell you, mother, that I am going.” “You are a scholar, my son,” his mother replied, “and it is right that 'one who studies when young should travel when grown up'. But do take care on the journey to the examinations, and if you are given office, come back home as soon as you can.” Chen Guangrui then ordered his servants to get his luggage together, took his leave of his mother, and started off on his journey. When he reached Chang'an the examination grounds were open and he went in. Having been successful in this examination, he went to the palace for the three questions test. The Tang Emperor personally awarded him the first place, and he was paraded round the streets on horseback for three days. It happened that just when the procession was passing the gateway of the minister Yin Kaishan, the minister's unmarried daughter Wenqiao, whose other name was Man-tang-qiao (Beauty Throughout the Hall), was making decorations for the house and throwing an embroidered ball to see who her future husband would be. When Chen Guangrui passed below she saw at once that he was exceptionally handsome, and she knew that he had come first in the recent examinations. She was thoroughly taken with him, and when she dropped her embroidered ball it landed squarely on his black hat. To the sound of pipes and flutes a dozen or so maidservants and serving women hurried downstairs to take hold of the head of Chen Guangrui's horse and invite him into the minister's mansion to marry his daughter. The minister and his wife came into the main hall, and when they had called for a master of ceremonies they married their daughter to Guangrui. When bride and groom had bowed to Heaven, Earth and each other they both bowed to the bride's father and mother. The minister ordered a banquet, and there was a night of drinking and celebration."
菩萨却与木吒，辞了悟能，半兴云雾前来、正走处，只见空中有一条玉龙叫唤。菩萨近前问日：“你是何龙，在此受罪？”那龙道：“我是西海龙王敖闰之子。因纵火烧了殿上明珠，我父王表奏天庭，告了忤逆。五帝把我吊在空中。打了三百，不日遭诛。望菩萨搭救搭救。”,"The Bodhisattva and Mu Zha, however, resigned from their enlightenment, and came forward half-heartedly in the clouds and mist, and as they were walking, they saw a jade dragon calling out in the sky. The Bodhisattva asked the sun recently: ""You are He Long, and you are suffering here?"" The dragon said: ""I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the West Sea. Because of arson and burning the pearl in the palace, my father and king played the heavenly court and sued for disobedience. The five emperors put me on fire. Hanging in the air. After hitting three hundred, I will be executed soon. I hope the Bodhisattva will rescue me.""","The Bodhisattva and Mokṣa took leave of Wuneng and proceeded again halfway between cloud and mist. As they were journeying, they saw in midair a young dragon calling for help. The Bodhisattva drew near and asked, “What dragon are you, and why are you suffering here?” The dragon said, “I am the son of Aorun, Dragon King of the Western Ocean. Because I inadvertently set fire to the palace and burned some of the pearls therein, my father the king memorialized to the Court of Heaven and charged me with grave disobedience. The Jade Emperor hung me in the sky and gave me three hundred lashes, and I shall be executed in a few days. I beg the Bodhisattva to save me.”","The Ten Judges of Hell sent Judge Cui and Executioner Zhao to accompany the emperor back. The emperor, before leaving the Sunluo Hall, kowtowed, and asked, “Are all well in my earthly palace?” The Judges replied, “Yes, all are well there, but we fear your younger sister has not long to live.” The emperor bowed again and thanked them, saying, “When I return to the world, I have nothing but melons to send you as a present.” The Ten Judges rejoiced and said, “We have abundance of Eastern and Western melons, but have no Southern melons.” Taizong said, “When I return home, I will send you some.” After this they bowed again and separated. The executioner seized his flag and led the way.","As Guanyin and Hui’an rushed on, they ran into a mewling jade dragon. “Who are you, and what is wrong?” Guanyin asked. “I am the son of Aorun, Dragon King of the Western Ocean. Because I accidentally set fire to our palace and some pearls were lost in the blaze, my father denounced me to Heaven for being unfilial. The Jade Emperor had me hung up and whipped, and in a few days’ time I will be executed. Please save me, Guanyin!”","The Bodhisattva and Moksa then took their leave of the Pig Awakened to Power and continued on their way by low-altitude cloud. As they were travelling along they heard a jade dragon call to them in mid-air. “Which dragon are you?” the Bodhisattva asked as she went up to him. “And why are you undergoing punishment here?” “I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. Because I burnt up the bright pearls in the palace, my father reported me to the court of Heaven as a rebel. The Jade Emperor had me hung up in mid-air and given three hundred strokes, and I am to be executed any day now. I beg you to save me, Bodhisattva.”"
高老见这等去邪归正，更十分喜悦，遂命家僮安排筵宴，酬谢唐僧。八戒上前扯住老高道：“爷，请我拙荆出来拜见公公伯伯，如何？”行者笑道：“贤弟，你既入了沙门，做了和尚，从今后，再莫题起那拙荆的话说。世间只有个火居道士，那里有个火居的和尚？我们且来叙了坐次，吃顿斋饭，赶早儿往西天走路。”高老儿摆了桌席，请三藏上坐，行者与八戒，坐于左右两旁，诸亲下坐。高老把素酒开樽，满斟一杯，奠了天地，然后奉与三藏。三藏道：“不瞒太公说，贫僧是胎里素，自幼儿不吃荤。”老高道：“因知老师清素，不曾敢动荤。此酒也是素的，请一杯不妨。”三藏道：“也不敢用酒，酒是我僧家第一戒者。”悟能慌了道：“师父，我自持斋，却不曾断酒。”悟空道：“老孙虽量窄，吃不上坛把，却也不曾断酒。”三藏道：“既如此，你兄弟们吃些素酒也罢，只是不许醉饮误事。”遂而他两个接了头锺。各人俱照旧坐下，摆下素斋，说不尽那杯盘之盛，品物之丰。,"Elder Gao was even more delighted when he saw that he had returned to the righteous, so he ordered his children to arrange a banquet to reward the Tang monk. Bajie stepped forward and grabbed Lao Gao and said, ""Master, please invite me, Zhuojing, to come out to meet my father-in-law and uncle, how about that?"" The walker smiled and said, ""Xian brother, since you have entered the ascetic and become a monk, from now on, don't mention it again. What Zhuojing said. There is only a Huoju Taoist priest in the world, and there is a Huoju monk? Let’s talk about the seat, eat a fast meal, and walk to the west in the morning.” Gao Laoer set the table and invited Sanzang. Sitting up, the walkers and Bajie sat on the left and right sides, and the relatives sat down. Gao Lao opened the bottle of vegetarian wine, filled a glass, poured the heaven and earth, and then presented it to Sanzang. Sanzang said: ""To be honest with the Taigong, the poor monk is vegetarian, and he has not eaten meat since he was a child."" Lao Gao said, ""Because I know that the teacher is pure, I have never dared to eat meat. This wine is also vegetarian, so please have a glass."" Sanzang said: ""I don't dare to use wine. Wine is the first person in my monk's family."" Wu Neng panicked: ""Master, I keep fasting myself, but I have never stopped drinking."" Wukong said: ""Although the old grandson is narrow, I can’t eat the altar handle, but I’ve never stopped drinking.” Sanzang said, “If that’s the case, it’s better for your brothers to eat some vegetarian wine, just don’t get drunk and make mistakes.” So the two of them took the lead. Everyone sat down as usual, put down their vegetarian food, and couldn't say enough about the abundance of the cups and dishes, and the abundance of things.","When old Mr. Gao saw the happy ending of this whole affair, he was more delighted than ever. He ordered his houseboys immediately to prepare a feast to thank the Tang Monk. Eight Rules went forward and tugged at him, saying, “Papa, please ask my humble wife to come out and greet the granddads and uncles. How about it?” “Worthy brother!” said Pilgrim, laughing. “Since you have embraced Buddhism and become a monk, please don’t ever mention ‘your humble wife’ again. There may be a married Daoist in this world, but there’s no such monk, is there? Let’s sit down, rather, and have a nice vegetarian meal. We’ll have to start off soon for the West.” Old Mr. Gao set the tables in order and invited Tripitaka to take the honored seat in the middle: Pilgrim and Eight Rules sat on both sides while the relatives took the remaining seats below. Mr. Gao opened a bottle of dietary wine and filled a glass: he sprinkled a little of the wine on the ground to thank Heaven and Earth before presenting the glass to Tripitaka. “To tell you the truth, aged sir,” said Tripitaka, “this poor monk has been a vegetarian from birth. I have not touched any kind of forbidden food since childhood.” “I know the reverend teacher is chaste and pure,” said old Mr. Gao, “and I did not dare bring forth any forbidden foodstuff. This wine is made for those who maintain a vegetarian diet: there’s no harm in your taking a glass.” “I just don’t dare use wine,” said Tripitaka. “for the prohibition of strong drink is a monk’s first commandment.” Alarmed, Wuneng said, “Master, though I kept a vegetarian diet, I didn’t cut out wine.” “Though my capacity is not great,” said Wukong, “and I’m not able to handle more than a crock or so, I haven’t discontinued the use of wine either.” “In that case,” said Tripitaka, “you two brothers may take some of this pure wine. But you are not permitted to get drunk and cause trouble.” So the two of them took the first round before taking their seats again to enjoy the feast. We cannot tell you in full what a richly laden table that was, and what varieties of delicacies were presented.",,"Reentering, the Taoists first kowtowed effusively, then poured the contents of the basin and the flowerpot into the vat. “Bring me a goblet, disciples,” ordered Tiger-Strength. He scooped out a cupful, took a large swig, then wiped his mouth and smacked his lips. “Well?” quizzed Deer-Strength. “Is it delectable?” “Not exactly,” replied Tiger-Strength, puckering. “It’s quite a particular taste.” “Let me try it,” said Goat-Strength, taking a big gulp. “It tastes . . . a lot like pig urine.” Hearing this, Monkey realized the game was up and decided to go out with style. “Taoist dimwits! Know that we are Buddhist monks from the great Tang empire. Having enjoyed the food you so kindly left for us, we decided to leave you a token of our gratitude. In case you hadn’t worked it out, that’s piss in the vat, not holy water.” The assembled Taoists immediately locked the door, gathered up pitchforks, rakes, brooms, tiles, rocks—anything they could lay their hands on—and hurled themselves at the impostors.","Squire Gao was happier than ever to see that he had turned from evil to good, and he ordered his servants to set out banquet with which to thank the Tang Priest. Pig went over to Squire Gao, tugged at his coat, and said, “Sir, may my wife come out and pay her respects to these two gentlemen?” “Brother,” said Monkey with a laugh. “You've entered the church now and become a monk. Don't ever talk about a wife again. Only Taoist priests can have families—we Buddhist monks never marry. Let's all sit down and eat a vegetarian meal, then we can set off early tomorrow morning on our journey to the West.” Squire Gao had the table and chairs set out and asked Sanzang take the seat of honour. Monkey and Pig sat on his left and right, and all the relations sat below them. Squire Gao opened a pot of wine, from which he filled a cup and poured a libation to Heaven and Earth before handing it to Sanzang. “Frankly, sir,” Sanzang said, “I have been a vegetarian from the womb, and have not consumed strong-flavoured food since my earliest childhood.” “Venerable master, I know that you are a vegetarian,” Squire Gao replied, “which is why I haven't pressed any meat or strong-flavoured food upon you. But this wine is made from vegetable matter, so a cup of it will do no harm.” “I don't drink either,” Sanzang explained, “as alcohol is the first of the prohibitions of the priesthood.” “Master,” pig hastily interjected, “I may be a vegetarian, but I haven't given up liquor.” “And although I haven't strong head for the stuff and can't finish a whole jar of it, I haven't given it up either,” Monkey added. “In that case you two had better drink some; but don't get drunk and ruin everything,” said Sanzang. The pair of them then took the first cup, after which everyone sat down again as the vegetarian dishes were brought in. Words could not describe the flowing cups, the well-filled dishes, and the splendid food."
却说那大仙自元始宫散会，领众小仙出离兜率，径下瑶天，坠祥云，早来到万寿山五庄观门首。看时，只见观门大开，地上干净，大仙道：“清风、明月，却也中用。常时节，日高三丈，腰也不伸，今日我们不在，他倒肯起早，开门扫地。”众小仙俱悦。行至殿上，香火全无，人踪俱寂，那里有明月、清风！众仙道：“他两个想是因我们不在，拐了东西走了。”大仙道：“岂有此理！修仙的人，敢有这般坏心的事！想是昨晚忘却关门，就去睡了，今早还未醒哩。”众仙到他房门首看处，真个关着房门，鼾鼾沉睡。这外边打门乱叫，那里叫得醒来？众仙撬开门板，着手扯下床来，也只是不醒。大仙笑道：“好仙童啊！成仙的人，神满再不思睡，却怎么这般困倦？莫不是有人做弄了他也？快取水来。”一童急取水半盏递与大仙。大仙念动咒语，噀一口水，喷在脸上，随即解了睡魔。,"However, he said that the great immortal left the meeting at Yuanshi Palace, led all the little immortals out of Tusita, walked down Yaotian, fell into auspicious clouds, and arrived at the gate of Wuzhuangguan Gate of Longevity Mountain early. When he looked at it, he saw that the gate of observation was wide open, the ground was clean, and the great immortal said: ""The breeze and the bright moon are also useful. During the season, the sun is three feet high, and the waist is not stretched. Today we are not here, he is willing to get up early, open the door and sweep the floor. ."" All the immortals were delighted. Walking to the hall, there is no incense, no trace of people, there is a bright moon and a cool breeze! The immortals said: ""The two of them thought it was because we weren't there, they abducted something and left."" Daxian said, ""How can it be! People who cultivate immortals dare to have such a bad heart! I think they forgot to close the door last night and went to bed. I haven't woken up yet this morning."" When the immortals looked at the front of his room door, they really closed the door, snoring and falling asleep. The door is slamming outside here, and there is a wake up call? The immortals pried on the door panel and started to pull out of the bed, but they just didn't wake up. Daxian smiled and said: ""What a fairy boy! A person who has become an immortal, Shenman is no longer sleepy, but why is he so sleepy? Could it be that someone has messed with him? Quickly fetch water."" Daxian recited a spell, spit out a sip of water, sprayed it on his face, and immediately released the Sandman.","We now tell you about the Great Immortal, who left the Tushita Palace with the lesser immortals after the lecture was over. Descending from the Green Jasper Heaven and dropping down from the auspicious clouds, they arrived before the Five Villages Abbey at the Long Life Mountain, where they found the gates wide open and the grounds neat and clean. “Well,” said the Great Immortal, “Clear Breeze and Bright Moon are not that useless after all! Ordinarily, they don’t even bestir themselves when the sun is high, but today when we are away, they are willing to rise early to open the gates and sweep the grounds.” All the lesser immortals were delighted, but when they reached the main hall, they discovered neither fire and incense nor any trace of a human person. Clear Breeze and Bright Moon were simply nowhere to be seen! “Because of our absence, the two of them must have stolen away with our things,” said the rest of the immortals. “Nonsense!” said the Great Immortal. “How could those who seek the way of immortality dare to engage in such wickedness? They must have forgotten to close the gates last night and gone to sleep. They are probably not yet awake this morning.” When they all reached the door of the Daoist lads, they found the door tightly shut and heard heavy snoring from within. They pounded on the door and attempted to rouse them, but the lads could not be wakened by all that clamor. Finally, the immortals managed to pry open the door and pull the lads off their beds; even then they did not wake up. “ Dear immortal lads!” said the Great Immortal, laughing. “Those who have attained immortality should not be so desirous of sleep, for their spirits are full. Why are they so fatigued? Could it be that someone has played a trick on them? Quickly, bring me some water!” One of the lads brought half a cup of water to the Great Immortal, who recited a spell before spitting a mouthful of water on the lads’ faces. The Sleep Demon was thus exorcised.",,"Soon, Thunderclap Monastery came into view: its agate-brick, golden-tiled turrets rose up out of cliffs scented with orchids. Divine apes picked peaches in its orchards; white cranes perched on pine branches; phoenixes swooped and pirouetted amid palaces, pavilions, and towers. Practically dancing with excitement, Tripitaka approached the monastery gate, where he was stopped and asked for his credentials by the Buddha’s Four Guardian Kings. “Wait here while we announce you.” Delighted to learn that the pilgrims had finally arrived, the Buddha mobilized his full complement of deities—the Eight Bodhisattvas, the Four Guardian Kings, the Five Hundred Arhats, the Three Thousand Protectors, the Eleven Great Orbs, and the Eighteen Custodians of Monasteries—to line up in two columns to greet the travelers, then issued to Tripitaka a golden decree of summons, which was passed back, from gate to gate, eventually reaching the pilgrims at the front entrance. The pilgrims prostrated themselves three times before the Buddha in the Great Hero Hall and then to his attendants to the left and the right. They showed their travel papers to the Buddha, who examined them carefully. “The Great Emperor of the Tang commanded me to beg you for scriptures of salvation,” Tripitaka said. “Please grant this wish, so that I may return to my country as soon as possible.” The Buddha opened his merciful mouth of mercy: “Due to the size, fertility, wealth, and populousness of your country, it is rife with greed, violence, licentiousness, bullying, and trickery. Your people do not follow the Buddha’s teachings or cultivate good karma. They are disloyal, unfilial, mendacious, immoral, unkind, and cruel. Due to their thoroughgoing wickedness, after death your people are banished to the darkness of Hell, where they are pounded, pestled, pounded some more, then reincarnated as beasts, mostly of the furred and horned variety, so that they can repay their debts to society in their next existence by becoming food for others. In sum, for the above reasons, they are condemned to eternal perdition in my Buddhist Hell, with no hope of deliverance. Your Confucius preached benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom; generations of your rulers have devised all kinds of punishments—imprisonment, banishment, hanging, beheading—to police the conduct of your people. None of this has managed to curb the foolish, the blind, and the reckless. But I have here three baskets of scriptures—15,144 scrolls in total—that can release mortals from vexations, calamities, and transgressions. One set speaks of Heaven, one of Earth; the third redeems the damned.","After the lecture in the palace of the Original Celestial Jade Pure One the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan led his junior Immortals down from the Tushita Heaven through the jade sky on auspicious clouds, and in a moment they were back at the gates of the Wuzhuang Temple. The gates, he saw, were wide open, and the ground was clean. “So Pure Wind and Bright Moon aren't so useless after all,” he said. “Usually they're still in bed when the sun is high in the sky. But now, with us away, they got up early, opened the gates, and swept the grounds.” All the junior Immortals were delighted. Yet when they went into the hall of worship there was no incense burning and nobody to be seen. Where were Bright Moon and Pure Wind, they wondered. “They probably thought that with us not here they could steal some stuff and clear out.” “What an outrageous idea,” said the Great Immortal. “As if men cultivating immortality could do anything so evil! I think they must have forgotten to shut the gates before they went to sleep last night and not have woken up yet.” When the Immortals went to look in their room they found the doors closed and heard the boys snoring. They hammered on the doors and shouted for all they were worth, but the boys did not wake up. They forced the doors open and pulled the boys from their beds: the boys still did not wake up. “Fine Immortal boys you are,” said the Great Immortal with a smile. “When you become an Immortal your divine spirit should be so full that you do not want to sleep. Why are they so tired? They must have been bewitched. Fetch some water at once.” A boy hastily handed him half a bowl of water. He intoned a spell, took a mouthful of the water, and spurted it on their faces. This broke the enchantment."
光阴拈指，却当七日正会，玄奘又具表，请唐王拈香。此时善声遍满天下。太宗即排驾，率文武多官、后妃国戚，早赴寺里。那一城人，无论大小尊卑，俱诣寺听讲。当有菩萨与木叉道：“今日是水陆正会，以一七继七七，可矣了。我和你杂在众人丛中，一则看他那会何如，二则看金蝉子可有福穿我的宝贝，三则也听他讲的是那一门经法。”两人随投寺里。正是有缘得遇旧相识，般若还归本道场。入到寺里观看，真个是天朝大国，果胜裟婆，赛过祇园舍卫，也不亚上刹招提。那一派仙音响亮，佛号喧哗。这菩萨直至多宝台边，果然是明智金蝉之相。诗曰：万象澄明绝点埃，大典玄奘坐高台。超生孤魂暗中到，听法高流市上来。施物应机心路远，出生随意藏门开。对看讲出无量法，老幼人人放喜怀。又诗曰：因游法界讲堂中，逢见相知不俗同。尽说目前千万事，又谈尘劫许多功。法云容曳舒群岳，教网张罗满太空。检点人生归善念，纷纷天雨落花红。那法师在台上，念一会《受生度亡经》，谈一会《安邦天宝篆》，又宣一会《劝修功卷》。这菩萨近前来，拍着宝台厉声高叫道：“那和尚，你只会谈小乘教法，可会谈大乘么？”玄奘闻言，心中大喜，翻身跳下台来，对菩萨起手道：“老师父，弟子失瞻，多罪。见前的盖众僧人，都讲的是小乘教法，却不知大乘教法如何。”菩萨道：“你这小乘教法，度不得亡者超升，只可浑俗和光而已。我有大乘佛法三藏，能超亡者升天，能度难人脱苦，能修无量寿身，能作无来无去。”,"Time strove, but when the meeting was held on the seventh day, Xuanzang made another appearance and asked Tang Wang Nianxiang. At this time, good voices spread all over the world. Taizong immediately lined up and led the civil and military officials, concubines and national relatives, and went to the temple early. People in that city, no matter how big or small, went to the temple to listen to the lecture. When there is a Bodhisattva and Mu Cha said: ""Today is the water and land meeting, and it's okay to follow the seven or seven. You and I are mixed in the crowd, one is to see how he will be, and the other is to see the golden cicada. Blessed to wear my baby, San Ze also listened to him teach which scripture method."" The two threw themselves into the temple. It was by chance that he met the old acquaintance, and Prajna returned to the dojo. Entering the temple to watch, it is really a big country of the Celestial Dynasty. Guo wins the scorpion, and surpasses the Gion Shewei. The fairy voice was loud and the Buddha's name was loud. This Bodhisattva has reached the edge of the platform of many treasures, and is indeed the image of a wise golden cicada. The poem says: Vientiane is clear and bright, and Xuanzang sits on a high platform. Chaosheng Lonely arrived secretly, listening to the law and coming up from the market. Shiwu should have a long way to go, and hide the door at will when he was born. To see the immeasurable Dharma, everyone, old and young, is happy. He also wrote a poem: “Because you travel in the lecture halls of the Dharma world, you know each other when you meet them. After talking about the ten thousand things at present, he also talked about the many merits of the calamity. Fa Yunrong dragged Shu Qun Yue, and taught the Internet Zhang Luo Man Space. Check your life and return to good thoughts, and there will be bonuses in the rain. On the stage, the Master recited for a while the ""Sutra of Life and Death"", talked about the ""Anbang Tianbao Seal"" for a while, and announced the ""Persuasion to Cultivation"" for a while. The Bodhisattva approached, patted the treasured stage and shouted loudly, ""Then, monk, you only talk about the Hinayana teachings, but can you talk about the Mahayana?"" Hearing this, Xuanzang was overjoyed, turned over and jumped off the stage. ""Father, teacher, this disciple has lost his sight and is guilty of many sins. The monks I saw before were all teaching the Hinayana teachings, but they don't know how the Mahayana teachings are."" The Bodhisattva said, ""You, the Hinayana teachings, cannot save the deceased and ascend. It can only be muddy and light. I have the Mahayana Buddha Dharma Three Treasures, which can transcend the dead and ascend to heaven, can save difficult people and escape suffering, can cultivate an immeasurable longevity body, and can achieve no coming and no going.”","Time went by like the snapping of fingers, and the formal celebration of the Grand Mass on the seventh day was to take place. Xuanzang presented the Tang emperor with a memorial, inviting him to raise the incense. News of these good works was circulating throughout the empire. Upon receiving the notice, Taizong sent for his carriage and led many of his officials, both civil and military, as well as his relatives and the ladies of the court, to the temple. All the people of the city—young and old, nobles and commoners—went along also to hear the preaching. At the same time, the Bodhisattva said to Mokṣa, “Today is the formal celebration of the Grand Mass, the first seventh of seven such occasions. It’s about time for you and me to join the crowd. First, we want to see how the mass is going; second, we want to find out whether Gold Cicada is worthy of my treasures; and third, we can discover what division of Buddhism he is preaching about.” The two of them thereupon went to the temple; and so it is that Affinity will help old comrades meet As perfection returns to this holy seat. As they walked inside the temple to look around, they discovered that such a place in the capital of a great nation indeed surpassed the Ṣaḍ-varṣa,25 or even the Jetavana Garden of the Śrāvastī.26 It was truly a lofty temple of Caturdiśgaḥ,27 resounding with divine music and Buddhist chants. Our Bodhisattva went directly to the side of the platform of many treasures and beheld a form truly resembling the enlightened Gold Cicada. The poem says: All things were pure with not a spot of dust. Xuanzang of the Great Law sat high onstage. Lost souls, redeemed, approached the place unseen; The city’s highborn came to hear the Law. You give when time’s ripe: this intent’s far-reaching. You die as you please, the Canon door’s open. As they heard him rehearse the Boundless Law, Young and old were glad and comforted. Another poem says: Since she made a tour of this holy site, She met a friend unlike all other men. They spoke of the present and of countless things— Of merit and trial in this world of dust. The cloud of Law extends to shroud the hills; The net of Truth spread wide to fill all space. Asses your lives and return to good thoughts, For Heaven’s grace is rife as falling blooms. On the platform, that Master of the Law recited for a while the Sūtra of Life and Deliverance for the Dead; he then lectured for a while on the Heavenly Treasure Chronicle for Peace in the Nation, after which he preached for a while on the Scroll on Merit and Self-Cultivation.28 The Bodhisattva drew near and thumped her hands on the platform, calling out in a loud voice, “Hey, monk! You only know how to talk about the teachings of the Little Vehicle. Don’t you know anything about the Great Vehicle?” When Xuanzang heard this question, he was filled with delight. He turned and leaped down from the platform, raised his hands and saluted the Bodhisattva, saying, “Venerable Teacher, please pardon your pupil for much disrespect. I only know that the priests who came before me all talk about the teachings of the Little Vehicle. I have no idea what the Great Vehicle teaches.” “The doctrines of your Little Vehicle,” said the Bodhisattva, “cannot save the damned by leading them up to Heaven; they can only mislead and confuse mortals. I have in my possession Tripitaka, three collections of the Great Vehicle Laws of Buddha, which are able to send the lost to Heaven, to deliver the afflicted from their sufferings, to fashion ageless bodies, and to break the cycles of coming and going.”","But Sun was angry with the wicked son and killed him. At this the Master was very angry. “Being a follower of my religion, how is it that you kill people? Yesterday you killed two, and today you have killed the son of our kind host. Being a blood thirsty man you must leave me, I cannot keep you any longer.” Alas, how true it is that when the heart is mad with passion the great treasure cannot be procured. When one’s mind is not clear, it is difficult to succeed. Sun, after being banished by the Master as unworthy to be his disciple, was in great distress. He was unwilling to return to his Waterfall Cave, for he would appear disgraced. He therefore decided not to return to his cave, but to go to Guanyin in the Southern Ocean. After mounting the clouds, he soon arrived and was admitted to her presence. He prostrated himself before her and shed bitter tears. Guanyin said, “What is the matter?” Sun replied, “Ever since you delivered me from the punishment of Heaven, and bade me go with the Buddhist pilgrim to fetch the Sacred Scriptures from the West, I have served him most faithfully and have risked my life many times in saving his. But now, just because I killed a few robbers who would, but for me, have killed him, he is most ungrateful, and sends me away in disgrace. Therefore I have come to you to do me justice. Guanyin said, “The robbers were human beings, and therefore you should not have killed them, even to save your Master. You should practice kindness as well as preach it.” At this the Monkey confessed his sin, but added “I have rendered some service, and this should not be forgotten before sending me away in disgrace. I beg of you to pity me. I return to you the magic cap of spikes with which I am so often punished, and now let me return to my old home in the Waterfall Cave.” Guanyin replied, “The magic cap was given me by Buddha himself.” Then said the Monkey, “Let me go and return it to him.” Guanyin said, “No, wait until I see your Master. He will soon be in danger again and will need your help.” Meanwhile, after Sun had been sent away, the Master on his horse traveled on his way a whole day without anything to eat, and he became weak from hunger. Zhu Bajie asked him to dismount and rest, while he would see if there were any habitations near, where he could beg food.","Just as the timorous Tripitaka began to weep and tug at the hunter’s sleeves, a voice boomed out from the base of the mountain: “Master! MASTER!” Whose voice was it? Read on to find out. Chapter Fourteen “It must be that monkey trapped in a stone casket beneath the mountain,” ventured one of Boqin’s servants. “Of course!” exclaimed Boqin. “Who else?” “What monkey?” asked Tripitaka. “Before the Tang emperor conquered the west and renamed this the Mountain of Two Frontiers, the ancients called it Five-Phases. Apparently, around the time that Wang Mang usurped the throne from the Han,* this mountain fell from Heaven with a magic monkey impervious to heat and cold trapped beneath it. Local spirits kept watch over him, feeding him iron pellets and copper juice when he got hungry and thirsty. Let’s pay him a visit.” Back at the foot of the mountain, they discovered—as advertised—a stone casket containing a monkey; his head and hands had squeezed through the gaps, and he was gesticulating wildly. “What took you so long, Master? Get me out of here, and I’ll keep you safe on your journey to the west.” The monkey was not looking his best: his eyes blazed above hollow cheeks; his head was carpeted with lichen, grass, and moss; wisteria was growing out of his ears. Boqin got close enough to pluck some of the grass from his temples and the sedge from his chin. “I’ve nothing to say to you,” Monkey informed him saltily. “But send that monk over here.” “What for?” Tripitaka asked. “I’ve some questions for you. Did the King of the East send you to seek scriptures in the west?” “He did indeed. Why do you ask?” “I am the Great Sage Equal to Heaven. Five hundred years ago I rebelled against the Jade Emperor and the Buddha pinned me underneath this mountain as punishment. A while back, Guanyin stopped by on her journey east to find a scripture pilgrim.","Time passed in the snap of a finger, and it was time for the special assembly on the seventh day, so Xuanzang wrote a memorial inviting the Tang Emperor to come and burn incense. His reputation for piety had now spread throughout the empire. Taizong therefore led a large number of civil and military officials and his empresses, consorts and their families to the monastery in a procession of carriages to the temple early that morning. Everyone in the city, whether young or old, humble or mighty, went to the temple to hear the preaching. The Bodhisattva said to Moksa, “Today is a special day of the Great Mass of Land and Water, which will go on from this first seventh day to the seventh seventh day, as is proper. You and I are going to mingle with the crowds for three reasons: to see the service, to see the Golden Cicada enjoying the blessing of wearing our treasure, and to hear what branch of the scriptures he preaches on.” The pair of them went to the temple. They were fated to meet their old acquaintance, just as the Wisdom returned to its own preaching place. When they went inside the monastery they saw that this great and heavenly dynasty surpassed any other in the world; while the Jetavana Monastery and Sravana were no match for this temple. Sacred music sounded clear above the shouting of Buddha names. When the Bodhisattva approached the preaching dais she saw in Xuanzang the likeness of the wise Golden Cicada. As the poem goes: Pure in every image, free of every speck of dirt, The great Xuanzang sat on his lofty dais. The lonely souls who have been delivered come in secret, While the well-born arrive to hear the law. Great is his wisdom in choosing suitable methods; All his life he has opened the doors of the scriptures. As they watch him preach the infinite Law, The ears of young and old alike are filled with joy. As Guanyin went to the temple preaching hall She met an old acquaintance who was no common mortal. He spoke about every current matter, And mentioned the achievements of many a mortal era. The clouds of the Dharma settle over every mountain, The net of the teaching spreads right across the sky. If one counts the number of pious thoughts among humans They are as plentiful as raindrops on red blossom. On his dais the Master of the Law read through the Sutra to Give Life and Deliver the Dead, discussed the Heavenly Charm to Protect the Country and preached on the Exhortation to Cultivate Merit. The Bodhisattva went up to the dais, hit it, and shouted out at the top of her voice, “Why are you only talking about the doctrine of the Little Vehicle, monk? Can you preach about the Great Vehicle?” On hearing these questions a delighted Xuanzang leapt down from the preaching dais, bowed to the Bodhisattva, and said, “Venerable teacher, your disciple has sinned grievously in failing to recognize you. We monks who stand before you only preach the law of the Little Vehicle, and we know nothing of the doctrine of the Great Vehicle.” “That doctrine of the Little Vehicle of yours will never bring the dead to rebirth; it's only good enough for a vulgar sort of enlightenment. Now I have the Three Stores of the Buddha's Law of the Great Vehicle that will raise the dead up to Heaven, deliver sufferers from their torments, and free souls from the eternal coming and going.”"
那禅师传了经文，踏云光，要上乌巢而去，被三藏又扯住奉告，定要问个西去的路程端的。那禅师笑云：“道路不难行，试听我吩咐：千山千水深，多瘴多魔处。若遇接天崖，放心休恐怖。行来摩耳岩，侧着脚踪步。仔细黑松林，妖狐多截路。精灵满国城，魔主盈山住。老虎坐琴堂，苍狼为主簿。狮象尽称王，虎豹皆作御。野猪挑担子，水怪前头遇。多年老石猴，那里怀嗔怒。你问那相识，他知西去路。”行者闻言，冷笑道：“我们去，不必问他，问我便了。”三藏还不解其意，那禅师化作金光，径上乌巢而去。长老往上拜谢，行者心中大怒，举铁棒望上乱捣，只见莲花生万朵，祥雾护千层。行者纵有搅海翻江力，莫想挽着乌巢一缕藤。三藏见了，扯住行者道：“悟空，”这样一个菩萨，你捣他窝巢怎的？”行者道：“他骂了我兄弟两个一场去了。”三藏道：“他讲的西天路径，何尝骂你？”行者道：“你那里晓得？他说野猪挑担子，是骂的八戒；多年老石猴，是骂的老孙。你怎么解得此意？”八戒道：“师兄息怒。这禅师也晓得过去未来之事，但看他水怪前头遇这句话，不知验否，饶他去罢。”行者见莲花祥雾，近那巢边，只得请师父上马，下山往西而去。那一去：管教清福人间少，致使灾魔山里多。毕竟不知前程端的如何，且听下回分解。,"The Zen master passed on the scriptures, stepped on the clouds and light, and wanted to go to Wuchao, but was held back by Sanzang and told him that he must ask the end of the journey to the west. The Zen master said with a smile: ""The road is not difficult to travel, try to listen to my instructions: thousands of mountains and thousands of waters are deep, many miasles and many devils. Pine forests, monsters and foxes are all over the place. The city is full of elves, and the demons live in mountains. The tiger sits in the piano hall, and the wolf is the master. The lion and the elephant are king, and the tiger and leopard are the king. The wild boar carries the burden. The old stone monkey is angry there. If you ask that acquaintance, he knows the way to the west."" The traveler heard the words and sneered: ""We go, we don't need to ask him, just ask me."" As a golden light, it walks up the Wuchao. The elders went up to give thanks, and the traveler was furious in his heart. He raised his iron rod and looked up to make trouble. He saw thousands of lotus flowers, auspicious mist protecting thousands of layers. Even if the traveler has the power to stir the sea and turn the river, he does not want to hold a vine of Wuchao. When Sanzang saw it, he grabbed the traveler and said, ""Wu Kong,"" such a bodhisattva, why would you pound his nest? ""Walker said:"" He scolded my brothers two for a fight. ""Sanzang said, ""Why did he scold you for the path to the West that he talked about?"" ""Walker said:"" Where do you know? He said that the wild boar carries the burden, and it is the scolding of Bajie; the old stone monkey is the old grandson of the scolding. How do you understand this? ""Bajie said: ""Senior brother calm down. This Zen master also knew about the past and the future, but after seeing this sentence in front of his water monster, he didn't know whether to check it or not, so let him go. ""The pilgrim saw the auspicious mist of the lotus, and approached the nest, so he had to ask the master to mount the horse and go down the mountain to the west. After that, there were few disciplines and blessings in the world, resulting in more disasters and demons in the mountain.","After the transmission of the sūtra, the Chan Master trod on the cloudy luminosity and was about to return to his crow’s nest. Tripitaka, however, held him back and earnestly questioned him again about the condition of the road to the West. The Chan Master laughed and said: “The way is not too hard to walk; Try listening to what I say. A thousand hills and waters deep; Places full of goblins and snags; When you reach those sky-touching cliffs, Fear not and put your mind at rest. Crossing the Rub Ear Precipice, You must walk with steps placed sideways. Take care in the Black Pine Forest; Fox-spirits will likely bar your way. Griffins will fill the capitals; Monsters all mountains populate; Old tigers sit as magistrates; Graying wolves act as registrars. Lions, elephants—all called kings! Leopards, tigers are coachmen all! A wild pig totes a hauling pole; You’ll meet ahead a water sprite. An old stone ape of many years Now nurses over there his spite! Just ask that acquaintance of yours: Well he knows the way to the West.” Hearing this, Pilgrim laughed with scorn and said, “Let’s go. Don’t ask him, ask me! That’s enough!” Tripitaka did not perceive what he meant. The Chan Master, changing into a beam of golden light, went straight up to his crow ’s nest, while the priest bowed toward him to express his gratitude. Enraged, Pilgrim lifted his iron rod and thrust it upward violently, but garlands of blooming lotus flowers were seen together with a thousand-layered shield of auspicious clouds. Though Pilgrim might have the strength to overturn rivers and seas, he could not catch hold of even one strand of the crow’s nest. When Tripitaka saw this, he pulled Pilgrim back, saying, “Wukong, why are you jabbing at the nest of a bodhisattva like him?” “For leaving like that after abusing both my brother and me,” said Pilgrim. “He was speaking of the way to the Western Heaven,” said Tripitaka. “Since when did he abuse you?” “Didn’t you get it?” asked Pilgrim. “He said, ‘A wild pig totes a hauling pole,’ and insulted Eight Rules. ‘ An old stone ape of many years’ ridiculed old Monkey. How else would you explain that?” “Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “don’t be angry. This Chan Master does know the events of past and future. Let’s see if his statement, ‘You’ll meet ahead a water sprite,’ will be fulfilled or not. Let’s spare him and leave.” Pilgrim saw the lotus flowers and auspicious fog near the nest, and he had little alternative than to ask his master to mount so that they could descend from the mountain and proceed toward the West. Lo, their journey Thus shows that in man’s world pure leisure is rare, But evils and ogres are rife in the hills! We really do not know what took place in the journey ahead; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.",,"This time, the sky clouded over. “Who’s in charge of the clouds?” Monkey yelled again. A panicked Cloud-Pusher and Fog-Spreader bowed before him. Once Monkey had issued the same threat as before, the two cloud controllers gathered up their weather effects and the sun blazed in a cloudless sky. “Loser!” Pigsy taunted Tiger-Strength some more. By this point the Taoist was starting to get anxious. He let down his hair, recited another spell, burned yet another charm, and banged his tablet again. This performance immediately drew the Thunder Duke and the Dame of Lightning out of the South Gate of Heaven. Both bowed before Monkey, who once more explained the situation and demanded to know why the deities were helping his rival. “ That Taoist knows what he’s doing,” said the Thunder Duke. “As soon as he heard the rain summons, the Jade Emperor dispatched a rain-making decree to the office of the Primordial Heavenly Lord of the All-Pervasive Thunderclap in the Nine Heavens, who then delegated us to provide some thunder and lightning.” “Well, as you’re here, just hold fire a bit and you can help me instead,” Monkey told him. The Taoist went into a frenzy of incense-throwing, charm-burning, spell-reciting, and tablet-banging. Next to be intercepted by Monkey in the skies overhead were the Dragon Kings of the Four Oceans. “Where d’you think you’re going?” he roared. The four kings—Aoguang, Aoshun, Aoqin, and Aorun—bowed and listened to Monkey’s summary of events. “I trust I can count on your support?” Monkey concluded. “Unconditionally!” said the dragon kings. Monkey then addressed the crowd of immortals he had apprehended: “The Taoist has struck his tablet four times, and","When the hermit had recited it, he started to rise up to his crow's nest by cloud, but Sanzang tugged at him and said that he wanted to know about the way to the Western Heaven. To this the hermit replied with a smile: “The journey will not be difficult, If you try to follow my instructions. There will be a thousand mountains, a thousand deep rivers. Many evil miasmas, and many a devil. If you reach the edge of the sky Do not worry or be afraid. If you come to Precipitous Cliff Walk with your feet placed sideways. Be careful in the Black Pine Forest, Where many an evil fox may block your path. The capital cities will be full of spirits, And demon kings will live in the mountains. Tigers will sit in the music rooms, Wolves will be in charge of the accounts. Lions and elephants will all be kings, With tigers and leopards for ministers. A wild boar will carry your luggage, A water monster will lead the way. A very old stone monkey Has no cause to be angry. Ask those friends of yours— They know the way to the West.” Monkey smiled bitterly and said, “Let's go. No need to ask him; you can ask me.” Sanzang did not understand what he meant. The hermit changed himself into a beam of golden light and went up to his nest, while the venerable Sanzang bowed to him in gratitude. Monkey, now furiously angry, raised his iron cudgel and was just going up to wreck the place when ten thousand lotus flowers appeared, protected by a thousand miraculous mists. Brother Monkey, you are strong enough to stir up the ocean or turn a river upside-down; but don't even dream of touching a twig of that nest! When Sanzang saw what he was going to do, he grabbed hold of him and said, “Wukong, what do you mean by trying to wreck this Bodhisattva's nest?” “He insulted us two disciples,” Monkey replied. “He did not insult you,” said Sanzang. “He was talking about the way to the Western Heaven.” “You wouldn't be able to understand,” Monkey said. “When he said, 'A wild boar will carry your luggage,' he was insulting Pig; and 'A very old stone monkey' was an insult to me. You didn't get his meaning, of course.” “Don't be angry,” said Pig. “That hermit knows about the past and the future as well. We don't yet know whether his talk about a water monster leading the way will come true or not. Let him off.” Monkey saw the lotus blossoms and the miraculous mists draw in round the nest, and could but ask his master to mount the horse and go down the mountain to the West. On this journey, Although they knew blessings rare on earth, There was many a demon and disaster in the hill. If you don't know what lay in store for them, listen to the explanation in the next installment."
刚才都在前厅上栽我，我又有些奈上祝下的，只恐娘嫌我嘴长耳大。”那妇人道：“我也不嫌，只是家下无个家长，招一个倒也罢了，但恐小女儿有些儿嫌丑。”八戒道：“娘，你上复令爱，不要这等拣汉。想我那唐僧人才虽俊，其实不中用。我丑自丑，有几句口号儿。”妇人道：“你怎的说么？”八戒道：“我虽然人物丑，勤紧有些功。若言千顷地，不用使牛耕。只消一顿钯，布种及时生。没雨能求雨，无风会唤风。房舍若嫌矮，起上二三层。,"They planted me in the front hall just now, and I was a little bit greedy. I was afraid that my mother would think my mouth was too big and my ears were too big. The woman said, ""I don't mind it either, but there are no parents in the family, so it's fine to recruit one, but I'm afraid the younger daughter will be a little ugly."" ""Bajie said: ""Mother, you're going to be your daughter again, don't wait to pick Han."" I think that my Tang monk, although handsome, is actually useless. I'm ugly, I have a few slogans. ""The woman said: ""What do you say? ""Bajie said: ""Although I am ugly, I am diligent and have some merit. If you say a thousand hectares of land, you don't need to use oxen to plough it. As long as a meal of palladium, the cloth seed will be produced in time. If there is no rain, you can ask for rain, and if there is no wind, you can call for the wind. If the house is too short, go up to the second or third floor.","Just now they were all trying to play tricks on me in the front hall, and I was somewhat embarrassed because I was afraid that Mama would find my long snout and large ears too offensive.” “I don’t, really.” said the woman. “And since we have no master of the house, it’s better to take one than none at all. But I do fear that my daughters may find you somewhat unattractive.” “Mama,” said Eight Rules, “please instruct your noble daughters not to choose their men that way. Others may be more handsome, but they usually turn out to be quite useless. Though I may be ugly, I do live by certain principles.” “And what are they?” asked the woman. Eight Rules replied, “Though I may be somewhat ugly, I can work quite diligently. A thousand acres of land, you say? No need for oxen to plow it. I’ll go over it once with my rake, And the seeds will grow in season. When there’s no rain I can make rain. When there’s no wind I’ll call for wind. If the house is not tall enough, I’ll build you a few stories more.",,"Then she gave me a tongue-lashing and I might have been a little rough. How was I to know she was my sister-in-law? Would it help if I said I was sorry?” “I’ll spare you for old time ’s sake. Now beat it!” “You are too kind,” simpered Monkey. “But I’m afraid there is one other thing I need to beg of you.” “Don’t push your luck, Monkey,” growled Bull Demon. “It’s like this.” Monkey carried on regardless. “There I was, escorting that Tang monk of mine to the west, and what do you know —there’s a whopping Flame Mountain in our way. The locals told us that my esteemed sister-in-law Princess Iron-Fan happens to possess the Palm-Leaf Fan that can extinguish fire. But she’s not so keen on us borrowing it.","When they put the pressure on me in the hall just now I was in a very awkward spot. I hope you don't mind about my long snout and big ears.” “I don't mind,” she said, “as long as we can have a man about the house, though my girls might not find you very attractive.” “Tell your girls not to be so particular about a husband,” said Pig. “That Tang Priest may be very handsome, but he's completely useless. Although I'm as ugly as they come, I have something to say for myself.” “What would that be?” she asked. His reply was: “I may be not much to look at, But I certainly get things done. Fifteen thousand acres I can plough without an ox. Just by using my rake I plant crops that come up well. I can summon rain in a drought, Call up a wind when there's none. If you find your house too small, I can add two more stories, or three. If the ground needs sweeping, I'll sweep it;"

大圣却有算计：爬上树，一只手使击子，一只手将锦布直裰的襟儿扯起来，做个兜子等住，他却串枝分叶，敲了三个果，兜在襟中，跳下树，一直前来，径到厨房里去。那八戒笑道：“哥哥，可有么？”行者道：“这不是？老孙的手到擒来。这个果子，也莫背了沙僧，可叫他一声。”八戒即招手叫道：“悟净，你来。”,"The great sage had a plan: he climbed up the tree, hit the hammer with one hand, and pulled up the front of the brocade cloth with the other hand, making a pocket and waiting, but he split the branches and leaves, knocked three fruits, In the lapel, jump off the tree, keep coming, and go straight to the kitchen. That Bajie smiled and said, ""Brother, do you have it?"" The walker said, ""Isn't it? Old Sun's hand is here. Don't carry this fruit on your back, but you can call him."" Bajie waved his hand and shouted: "" Wu Jing, come here.""","The Great Sage, however, had his own plan: after climbing up on the tree, he held the golden mallet in one hand and, with the other, pulled up the front of his silk shirt to make a little sack. Parting the leaves and branches, he knocked three of the fruits into the sack. He jumped down from the tree and ran straight to the kitchen. “Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules smiling, “do you have them?” “Aren’t these the ones?” said Pilgrim. “I reached and took, that’s all! But we shouldn’t let Sha Monk pass up the chance of tasting this fruit. You call him.” Eight Rules waved his hands and cried, “Wujing, come!”",,"“Are we nearly there yet?” Tripitaka asked Monkey. “Even if we’re now on the outskirts of India,” considered Monkey, “we could still be a long way from the Buddha’s Thunderclap Monastery on Soul Mountain.

Where are you from?” a handful of constables asked.","The Great Sage now had a plan. He climbed the tree and then held the rod in one hand while he undid the lapel of his cloth tunic and made it into a kind of pouch.

He jumped out of the tree and went straight to the kitchen, where a smiling Pig asked him if he had got any. “This is the stuff, isn't it?” said Monkey. “I was able to get some. We mustn't leave Friar Sand in the dark, so give him a shout.” “Come here, Friar Sand,” Pig called, waving his hand."

After a few moments, they came and met outside together. Ao Qin said: ""Brother, what's the matter, beat the bells?"" Laolong said: ""My dear brother! It's hard to say! There was a natural saint of Huaguo Mountain who came to recognize me as a neighbor in the morning, and later asked for a weapon. It was too small to offer a steel fork, and a halberd was too light to present. My hand, I lost some answers. Now sitting in the palace, what kind of clothes do you want. I don't have anything, so I ring the bell and drum, and invite my virtuous brother to come. What clothes do you have, give him a pair, and send him to the door. Hearing this, Ao Qin said angrily: ""My brothers, order the soldiers, not to take him!"" Lao Long said: ""Don't say take! That piece of iron, if you hold it, you will die, if you knock it, you will die. The skin is broken, and the tendons are injured!"" Ao Run, the Dragon King of the West Sea, said: ""Second brother can't do anything with him; and only put on a pair of clothes and go with him, send him out the door, play the watch to the sky, and the sky will punish itself. Ao Shun, the Dragon King of the North Sea, said: ""That's right. I have a pair of lotus roots here."" Ao Run, the Dragon King of the West Sea, said: ""I brought a pair of golden armor with locks."" Ao Qin, the Dragon King of the South Sea, said: "" I have a purple-gold crown with phoenix wings."" Lao Long was overjoyed, and he brought him into the Crystal Palace to meet him, so he offered it to him. Wukong put on the golden crown, golden armor, and cloud shoes properly, used the Ruyi stick, and shot out all the way, and said to the dragons, ""Noisy! Noisy!""","Soon after the drum and the bell had sounded, the Dragon Kings of the Three Oceans got the message and arrived promptly, all congregating in the outer courtyard. “Elder Brother,” said Aoqin, “what emergency made you beat the drum and strike the bell?” “Good Brother,” answered the old Dragon, “it’s a long story! We have here a certain Heaven-born sage from the Flower-Fruit Mountain, who came here and claimed to be my near neighbor. He subsequently demanded a weapon; the steel fork I presented he deemed too small, and the halberd I offered too light. Finally he himself took that piece of rare, divine iron by which the depth of the Heavenly River was fixed and used it for mock combat. He is now sitting in the palace and also demanding some sort of battle dress. We have none of that here. So we sounded the drum and the bell to invite you all to come. If you happen to have some such outfit, please give it to him so that I can send him out of this door!” When Aoqin heard this, he was outraged. “Let us brothers call our army together,” he said, “and arrest him. What’s wrong with that?” “Don’t talk about arresting him!” the old Dragon said, “don’t talk about arresting him! That piece of iron—a small stroke with it is deadly and a light tap is fatal! The slightest touch will crack the skin and a small rap will injure the muscles!” Aorun, the Dragon King of the Western Ocean, said, “Second elder brother should not raise his hand against him. Let us rather assemble an outfit for him and get him out of this place. We can then present a formal complaint to Heaven, and Heaven will send its own punishment.” “You are right,” said Aoshun, the Dragon King of the Northern Ocean, “I have here a pair of cloud-treading shoes the color of lotus root.” Aorun, the Dragon King of the Western Ocean said, “I brought along a cuirass of chain-mail made of yellow gold.” “And I have a cap with erect phoenix plumes, made of red gold,” said Aoqin, the Dragon King of the Southern Ocean. The old Dragon King was delighted and brought them into the Water-Crystal Palace to present the gifts. Wukong duly put on the gold cap, the gold cuirass, and cloud-treading shoes, and, wielding his compliant rod, he fought his way out in mock combat, yelling to the dragons, “Sorry to have bothered you!” The Dragon Kings of the Four Oceans were outraged, and they consulted together about filing a formal complaint, of which we make no mention here.","True enough, as soon as the drum and bell sounded, the three Dragon brothers were alarmed and immediately appeared. Aojin asked, “Elder Brother, what is the matter? Why do you beat the drum and strike the bell?” The Old Dragon said, “I am afraid to tell you. There is a Sage from the Mountain Garden come to call on me as a neighbor, and he desires some weapons. I gave him the steel prong, but he said it was too small. When I gave him the carved lance, he said it was too light. Then I took from the bottom of our cave the wonderful iron staff. He was pleased with that, and he now sits in the palace and demands some armor. I have none here; therefore I beat the drum and the bell. My dear brothers, let him have a suit of armor, so that he may go.” The brother Aojin hearing this, got very angry and cried, “Let us get soldiers and arrest him.” The elder Dragon said, “Do not do that, do not do that! If he touches you with that iron beam, or if it falls upon you, you are dead.” The third brother, Aoyun said, “We must not fight with him. The best thing we can do is, to give him a suit of armor so that he may go. We will memorialize High Heaven about him and Heaven will punish him.” Then Aosun said, “That is right. I have here a pair of silk sandals for traveling in the air.” Aoyun said, “I have with me a chain coat with gold buckles.” Aojin said, “And I have a red gold helmet.” At this the elder Dragon King was greatly pleased, and led them to the crystal palace to be presented to his visitor. The Seeker of Secrets took the gold helmet, and the gold buckled coat, and the silk sandals and put them all carefully on. Then he took up the magic beam and walked straight out.","Moments after the alligator general had struck the bell and the turtle marshal beaten the drum, the three dragon brothers converged on the entrance to the Water-Crystal Palace. Aoguang hurried out to meet them. “What emergency did you bring us here for?” Aoqin asked his older brother. “It’s like this,” Aoguang replied. “Earlier today, a so-called immortal sage from Flower-Fruit Mountain, claiming to be a neighbor of mine, turned up demanding a weapon. I finally managed to fob him off with the magic iron pillar from the Heavenly River, but he’s now refusing to leave until I give him some armor, too. I don’t have a thing to give him, which is why I called you here. Do you have anything that will do, so that I can get rid of him?” “Let’s call up our armies and apprehend him!” spluttered the outraged Aoqin. “Hopeless,” Aoguang countered. “One tap of that magic iron will finish us all.” Aorun argued for the path of least resistance: “Let’s find him some armor, send him on his way, then make a formal complaint to Heaven, which can punish him as it sees fit.” “Good plan,” chimed Aoshun. “I have here a pair of cloud-hopping shoes in lotus-colored silk.” “And I happen to have with me a golden chain-mail cuirass,” added Aorun. “I can throw in a purple-gold phoenix-feather cap,” offered Aoqin. Delighted, Aoguang now ushered them into the palace to meet his unruly visitor. Monkey put on his shoes, his chain-mail cuirass, and his helmet and mock-fought his way out of the palace with his iron staff, yelling “Sorry for the trouble” as he went. Most unsettled by the whole encounter, the four dragons embarked upon a consultation process about lodging an official complaint with the Heavenly authorities. But we need not concern ourselves with that for the time being.","The sound of the bell and the drum startled the other three dragon kings, who had arrived and were waiting together outside within the instant. One of them, Ao Qin, said, “Elder Brother, what's up? Why the drum and the bell?” “It hurts me to tell you, brother,” the Old Dragon King replied. “There's this so-called heaven-born sage from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit who came here this morning saying that I was his neighbour, then demanded a weapon. I offered him a steel-pronged spear but he said it was too small, and a patterned halberd that he said was too light. Then he picked up the miraculous iron that fastens the Milky Way and tried a few movements with it. Now he's sitting in the palace and demanding a suit of armour, but we haven't got one. That's why I used the bell and the drum to call you here. You three must have some armour. Please give him a suit, then we can get rid of him.” When Ao Qin heard this he said in a fury, “To arms, brothers. Arrest the criminal.” “No! No! It's out of the question,” said the Old Dragon King. “If that iron cudgel of his gets you you're done for, if it hits you die, if it comes close your skin is broken, and if it so much as brushes against you your sinews are smashed.” Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea, said, “Second brother, you must not attack him. Instead we should put a suit of armour together for him, then send him away. We can send a memorial about it to Heaven, then Heaven will of course punish him.” “You're right,” said Ao Shun, the Dragon King of the Northern Sea. “I have a pair of lotus-root cloud-walking shoes.” “I've brought a suit of golden chain mail,” said Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. “And I have a phoenix-winged purple gold helmet,” added Ao Qin, the Dragon King of the Southern Sea. The Old Dragon King was very pleased, and he brought them into the palace to meet Sun Wukong and present the equipment to him. Sun Wukong put on the golden helmet and the armour and the cloud-walking shoes, then charged out, waving his cudgel and saying to the dragons, “My apologies for disturbing you.” The four Dragon Kings were most indignant, but we will not go into their discussions on the protest they sent to Heaven."

Why don’t you just bring the vase yourself?”","The monster shot forward as a stream of sparks, with the Great Sage behind him on his coloured cloud. As he was racing along, Monkey saw a tall mountain appear in front of them. Here the monster put himself together again by reassembling the sparks, rushed into a cave, and came out with a nine-pronged rake in his hand to do battle. “Wretch,” shouted Monkey, “where are you from? How do you know my name, you evil demon? What powers have you got? Tell me honestly, and I'll spare your life.”"

With a fierce look he held a different kind of weapon in each of the six hands, one instrument to behead the monster, a second to cut him down, a third to bind him, a fourth to beat him, a fifth a silken ball and the sixth a large fork with which to rush on him. When the Seeker of Secrets saw this, he was afraid and said, “This little boy after all has some skill. It would not be out of place to show him my skill.” The Seeker of Secrets then cried out, “Transform!” and in an instant he also had three heads and six arms, had multiplied his magic spear into three, and with his six hands grasped them.","Nezha’s baby face belied his prowess as a warrior; he was extraordinarily agile—able to fly, leap, and transform at will—and was armed, moreover, with six magic weapons. “Who’s this dumpling?” Monkey asked. “What business do you have with me?” “Monstrous monkey!” shouted Nezha. “How dare you not recognize me? For I am Prince Nezha, third son of Heavenly King Li. I am here on the orders of the Jade Emperor to capture you.” This made Monkey laugh a good deal. “Does your mother know you’re out, little princeykins? How many baby teeth have you lost already? I’ll spare you this time—for the sake of your adorable chubby cheeks. Just read the banner—if you’ve learned to read yet—and tell the Jade Emperor to give me a proper job. If he gives me a promotion, I’ll forget we got off to such a bad start. If not, I’ll take my quarrel to the emperor’s own throne room. And I’ll be bringing my staff, too.” Reading the banner, Nezha was even more provoked. “Extraordinary impudence! Prepare for a pounding!” “Fine by me,” said Monkey nonchalantly. “Swing away.” The furious Nezha turned into a monster with three heads and six arms, each holding a different weapon: a demon-beheading sword, a demon-hacking knife, a demon-strangling rope, a demon-taming pestle, a wheel of fire, and an embroidered ball. Witnessing this transformation, Wukong did feel a slight twinge of alarm. “So this whippersnapper has a few tricks up his six sleeves. Nothing to worry about, though.","His hair in tufts barely covers his scalp, His cloak not over his shoulders. How striking his intelligence, How elegant his air. Indeed he is the scion of a unicorn in Heaven; In truth he is a phoenix Immortal from the clouds. The seed of dragons is different from the common herd; This fine youth is not at all like mortals. With him he carries six divine weapons; Endless his transformations as he soars through the air. Now he has received an edict from the Jade Emperor's mouth, Making him Commander of the Three Temples of the Masses. Sun Wukong went up to him and asked, “Whose little boy are you then? What do you mean, charging up to my door?” “Stinking monkey fiend,” shouted Prince Nezha, “don't you know who I am? I am Nezha, the third son of the pagoda-bearing Heavenly King, and I have been commanded by the Jade Emperor to come here and arrest you.” “You do talk big, don't you, little prince,” said Sun Wukong, laughing at him. “But as you've still got all your milk teeth and are still wet behind the ears I'll spare your life and I won't hit you. Do you see what it says on my standard? Go and tell the Jade Emperor that if he gives me that title I'll call off my armies and submit to him once more. But if he doesn't do what I want him to, I'll surely attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist.” Nezha looked up and saw the words “Great Sage Equaling Heaven.” “You wicked monkey! How dare you give yourself a title like that, whatever your magic powers may be! Don't worry, all you're getting is my sword.” “Give me a few swipes, then,” replied Sun Wukong, “I won't move.” “Change,” yelled Nezha in a passion, and at once he had three heads and six arms, which made him look most ferocious. In his hands he held six weapons, a demon-beheading sword, a demon-hacking cutlass, a demon-binding rope, a demon-quelling pestle, an embroidered ball, and a fire-wheel—and wielding all these he rushed straight at Sun Wukong. At the sight of him Sun Wukong exclaimed with astonishment, “Well, my boy, you certainly know a trick or two. But just behave yourself and watch what I can do.” Our dear Great Sage shouted “Change,” and he too had three heads and six arms. He shook his gold-banded cudgel, and it turned into three cudgels, which he gripped with his six hands to ward off Nezha's blows. It was a great fight, and it made the earth shake and the mountains tremble:"
采来堆积备冬寒，换酒换钱从俺。”渔翁道：“你山中虽可比过，还不如我水秀的幽雅，有一《临江仙》为证：潮落旋移孤艇去，夜深罢棹歌来。蓑衣残月甚幽哉，宿鸥惊不起，天际彩云开。困卧芦洲无个事，三竿日上还捱。随心尽意自安排，朝臣寒待漏，争似我宽怀？”樵夫道：“你水秀的幽雅，还不如我山青更幽雅，亦有《临江仙》可证：苍径秋高拽斧去，晚凉抬担回来。野花插鬓更奇哉，拨云寻路出，待月叫门开。稚子山妻欣笑接，草床木枕敧捱。蒸梨炊黍旋铺排，瓮中新酿熟，真个壮幽怀！”渔翁道：,"Collected to prepare for winter cold, exchange wine for money from me. The fisherman said: ""Although your mountain is comparable, it is not as elegant as mine. There is a ""Linjiang Immortal"" as a proof: when the tide ebbs, the lonely boat is moved, and the night is late at night. The waning moon is very secluded, the gulls can't be startled, and the sky is full of colorful clouds. Sleepy and lying in Luzhou, there is nothing to do. Arrange as you please, courtiers wait for the leaks, arguing for my mercy? ""The woodcutter said: ""You are beautiful and elegant, not as elegant as my mountain green, and there is also ""Linjiang Xian"" to prove it: Cangjing pulls the axe in the autumn, and carries the burden back in the evening. It is even more strange that the wildflowers are inserted on the temples, and the clouds are looking for a way out, and the door is opened when the moon calls. Zhizishan's wife smiled and greeted him, and the grass bed and the wooden pillow slammed into each other. The steamed pears and millets are arranged in a twist, and the urns are freshly brewed, which is really magnificent! ""The fisherman said:","I gather and stockpile, ready for winter’s cold. Change them for wine or cash as I wish.” The fisherman said, “Though your life in the mountains is not bad, it is still not as charming and graceful as mine is on the fair waters. As testimony, I have a lyric to the tune of ‘Immortal by the River’: Falling tide moves my one boat away; I rest my oars, my song comes with the night. The coir coat, the waning moon—how charming they are! No seagull darts up from fright As rosy clouds spread through the sky. I sleep without care at reeded isles, Still snoozing when the sun is high. I work after my own plans and desires. Vassals in cold nights tending court, Could theirs match my pleasure and peace?” The woodman said, “The charm and grace of your fair waters cannot be compared with those of my blue mountains. I too have a testimony to the tune of ‘Immortal by the River’: I walk autumn’s frosty paths dragging my ax; In night’s cool I pole back my load, Stranger still with temples stuck with flowers. I push clouds to find my way out; Moon-stuck I call open my gate. Rustic wife and young son greet me with smiles; On straw bed and wooden pillow I lie. Steamed pears and cooked millet are soon prepared. The urn’s brew newly mellowed Will add to my secret joys.” The fisherman said, “All these things in our poems have to do with our livelihood, the occupations with which we support ourselves.","I take refuge in the Buddha I take refuge in the Dharma I take refuge in the Sangha Then the Man of Religion was about to rise to the clouds and depart, when the Master seized him and asked him the way to the West. The Man of Religion smiled and said: The road is not difficult, Listen to me. You must cross a thousand mountains and a thousand streams, And you must pass through dark places, where fiends abound, If you come to what seems the end of all things, Have no fear but press on,",One would praise seagulls and crabs; the other craggy peaks and mountain tea.,"I stack them up against the winter cold, And whether they're sold for wine or money is up to me.” “Although you don't do too badly in your hills, your life is not as elegant as mine on the water,” said the fisherman, “as I can show with some lines to the tune The Immortal by the River. As the tide turns my solitary boat departs; I sing in the night, resting from the oars. From under a straw cape the waning moon is peaceful. The sleeping gulls are not disturbed As the clouds part at the end of the sky. Tired, I lie on the isle of rushes with nothing to do, And when the sun is high I'm lying there still. I arrange everything to suit myself: How can the court official compare with my ease As he waits in the cold for an audience at dawn?” “Your life on the water may be elegant, but it's nothing compared with mine,” replied the woodcutter, “and I have some lines to the same tune to demonstrate the point: On an autumn day I carry my axe along the greeny path Bringing the load back in the cool of evening, Putting wild flowers in my hair, just to be different, I push aside the clouds to find my way home, And the moon is up when I tell them to open the door. Rustic wife and innocent son greet me with smiles, And I recline on my bed of grass and wooden pillow. Steamed millet and pear are spread before me, While the new wine is warm in the pot: This is really civilized.” “All this is about our living and the ways we provide for ourselves,” said the fisherman."

Living in concord and sympathy, they did not mingle with bird or beast but enjoyed their independence in perfect happiness. For such were their activities:","Whether beast or man or sage.

工完回奏，太宗甚喜。却又聚集多官，出榜招僧，修建水陆大会，超度冥府孤魂。榜行天下，着各处官员推选有道的高僧，上长安做会。那消个月之期，天下多僧俱到。唐王传旨，着太史丞傅奕选举高僧，修建佛事。傅奕闻旨，即上疏止浮图，以言无佛。表曰：“西域之法，无君臣父子，以三途六道，蒙诱愚蠢，追既往之罪，窥将来之福，口诵梵言，以图偷免。且生死寿夭，本诸自然；刑德威福，系之人主。今闻俗徒矫托，皆云由佛。自五帝三王，未有佛法，君明臣忠，年祚长久。至汉明帝始立胡神，然惟西域桑门，自传其教，实乃夷犯中国，不足为信。”太宗闻言，遂将此表掷付群臣议之。时有宰相萧瑀，出班俯囟奏曰：,"After finishing the work, Taizong was very happy. However, they gathered many officials, recruited monks, built water and land conferences, and rescued the lonely souls of the underworld. All over the world, officials from all over the world choose eminent monks with Taoism and go to Chang'an for a meeting. During the period of the disappearing months, many monks in the world will arrive. The emperor of Tang passed the decree, and the Taishi Cheng Fu Yi elected eminent monks and built Buddhist affairs. When Fu Yi heard the decree, he immediately dismissed the floating pictures, saying that there is no Buddha. The table said: ""The law of the Western Regions, there are no rulers, ministers, fathers and sons. They use three paths and six paths to lure fools, pursue past sins, see future blessings, and recite Sanskrit words to try to avoid them. Xingdeweifu is the master of the people. Now I hear the pretense of the common people, all of which are from the Buddha. Since the Five Emperors and Three Kings, there has been no Buddha Dharma. The Sangmen in the Western Regions, who have self-published their teachings, are actually barbarians invading China, and they cannot be trusted."" When Taizong heard this, he threw this table to the ministers for discussion. At that time, there was the chancellor Xiao Yu, who came out of class and played down the fontanelle, saying:","The work was finished and reported; Taizong was exceedingly pleased. He then gathered many officials together in order that a public notice be issued to invite monks for the celebration of the Grand Mass of Land and Water, so that those orphaned souls in the Region of Darkness might find salvation. The notice went throughout the empire, and officials of all regions were asked to recommend monks illustrious for their holiness to go to Chang’an for the Mass. In less than a month’s time, various monks from the empire had arrived. The Tang emperor ordered the court historian, Fu Yi, to select an illustrious priest to take charge of the ceremonies. When Fu Yi received the order, however, he presented a memorial to the Throne that attempted to dispute the worth of Buddha.2 The memorial said: The teachings of the Western Territory deny the relations of ruler and subject, of father and son. With the doctrines of the Three Ways3 and the Sixfold Path,4 they beguile and seduce the foolish and the simpleminded. They emphasize the sins of the past in order to ensure the felicities of the future. By chanting in Sanskrit, they seek a way of escape. We submit, however, that birth, death, and the length of one’s life are ordered by nature; but the conditions of public disgrace or honor are determined by human volition. These phenomena are not, as some philistines would now maintain, ordained by Buddha. The teachings of Buddha did not exist in the time of the Five Thearchs and the Three Kings, and yet those rulers were wise, their subjects loyal, and their reigns long-lasting. It was not until the period of Emperor Ming in the Han dynasty that the worship of foreign gods was established,5 but this meant only that priests of the Western Territory were permitted to propagate their faith. The event, in fact, represented a foreign intrusion in China, and the teachings are hardly worthy to be believed. When Taizong saw the memorial, he had it distributed among the various officials for discussion. At that time the prime minister Xiao Yu came forward and prostrated himself to address the throne, saying, “The teachings of Buddha, which have flourished in several previous dynasties, seek to exalt the good and to restrain what is evil.","How is it that you come and make trouble here and kill his disciples? The Taoist chief priest will now say that we Buddhist monks have killed them. What shall we do? And if we go into the city with you, we are afraid you will have to pay for this with your life.” Sun laughed and said, “Friends, do not trouble yourselves about this. I am Sun Wukong, the Great Sage, a disciple of the Holy Master from China, seeking Sacred Scriptures in the West, and I have come to save you.” They all answered, “No, no, you cannot be Sun, for we know him.” He replied, “You have not met him, how can you therefore know him?” They replied, “We have often seen him in our dreams. The Minister of Venus has described him to us and warned us not to make a mistake.” “What did he say to you?” They replied, “He has a hard head, bright eyes, a round face, and a hairy face without cheeks, sharp teeth, pointed mouth, hot temper, and is uglier than the God of Thunder.","Get away with you!” Without engaging further, the disguised Guanyin and Hui’an carried on their way, until they encountered the cortege of Taizong’s chancellor, Xiao Yu, at the Gate of Eastern Resplendence. When Guanyin refused to step aside to let him past, Xiao Yu reined in his horse; the luminous robe immediately caught his eye. “How much is it?” he asked. “That depends,” Guanyin replied. “Seven thousand is the price for the impious. But I will gift these items gratis to a faithful follower of the Buddha.” The minister now dismounted and treated Guanyin with the utmost courtesy.","When he was informed that work had been completed Taizong was very pleased, and assembling the multitude of officials he issued a notice summoning monks to come and hold a Great Mass for the rebirth of those lonely souls in the underworld. As the notice traveled throughout the empire the local officials everywhere recommended holy and venerable monks to go to Chang'an for the service. By the end of the month many monks had arrived in Chang'an from all over the empire. The Emperor issued a decree ordering Fu Yi, the Deputy Annalist, to select some venerable monks to perform Buddhist ceremonies. On hearing this command Fu Yi sent up a memorial requesting a ban on the building of pagodas and saying that there was no Buddha. It read: By the Law of the West there are no distinctions between ruler and subject or between father and son; the Three Paths and the Six Roads are used to deceive the foolish; past sins are chased away to filch future blessings; and Sanskrit prayers are recited in attempts to avoid retribution. Now birth, death and the length of life are in fact decided by nature; and punishments, virtue, power and blessings come from the lord of men. But these days vulgar believers distort the truth and say that they all come from Buddha. In the time of the Five Emperors and Three Kings of antiquity this Buddha did not exist, yet rulers were enlightened, subjects were loyal, and prosperity lasted for many a long year. When foreign gods were first established in the time of Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty, sramanas from the West began to propagate their religion. This is in reality a foreign encroachment on China, and it does not merit belief. When he had heard this read to him Taizong tossed it to his other officials for debate. The minister Xiao Yu stepped forward from the ranks, kowtowed and said, “The Buddha's law has flourished for several dynasties, and by spreading good and preventing evil it gives unseen help to the state; there is no reason why it would be abolished."
那呆子只管絮絮叨叨的唧哝，不期那两个道童复进房来取茶去献，只听得八戒还嚷甚么“人参果吃得不快活，再得一个儿吃吃才好。”清风听见心疑道：“明月，你听那长嘴和尚讲人参果还要个吃吃。师父别时叮咛，教防他手下人罗唣，莫敢是他偷了我们宝贝么？”明月回头道：“哥耶，不好了！不好了！,"The idiot just kept chattering, and unexpectedly the two Taoist boys came back to the room to fetch tea to offer, only to hear Bajie shouting, ""I'm not happy to eat ginseng fruit, it's better to eat another one."" Qingfeng heard Suspiciously said: ""Mingyue, you heard that the long-mouthed monk said that you need to eat ginseng fruit. Master reminded him to guard against his subordinate Luo Meng, don't you dare to steal our treasure?"" Mingyue turned back and said: "" Brother Ye, it's not good! It's not good!","Idiot, however, kept muttering and mumbling to himself. When the two Daoist lads unexpectedly came back to the room to fetch some tea for the Tang Monk, they heard Eight Rules complaining about “not enjoying my ginseng fruit,” and saying that it would be much better if he could have a taste of another one. Hearing this, Clear Breeze grew suspicious and said, “Bright Moon, listen to that monk with the long snout; he said he wanted to eat another ginseng fruit. Before our master’s departure, he told us to be wary of their mischief. Could it be that they have stolen our treasures?” Turning around, Bright Moon said, “Elder Brother, it looks bad, very bad!",,"Unable to find a reasonable counterargument, Monkey let Aoguang return to the ocean and told his fellow pilgrims that he had to make a trip to Heaven. In a single cloud-somersault, Monkey was at the West Gate. “Afternoon, Monkey,” the duty patrol greeted him. “Got those scriptures yet?” “Any day now,” answered Monkey.","Before long the Taoist boys were back in their room, and they heard Pig moaning, “I didn't enjoy my manfruit; I wish I could have another.” Pure Wind's suspicion were aroused, and he said to Bright Moon, “Did you hear that long-snouted monk saying he wished he could have another manfruit? Our master told us when he went that we were to be careful of those gangsters and not let them steal our treasures.” “This is terrible, terrible,” said Bright Moon. “What's the golden rod doing on the floor?"
只见那老儿才引个少年，拿一个板盘儿，托三杯清茶来献。茶罢，又吩咐办斋。那少年又拿一张有窟窿无漆水的旧桌，端两条破头折脚的凳子，放在天井中，请三众凉处坐下。三藏方问道：“老施主，高姓？”老者道：“在下姓王。”“有几位令嗣？”,"I saw that the old man invited a young man to bring a plate and three cups of tea to offer. After tea was over, he ordered to fast. The young man took another old table with holes and no paint, and two stools with broken heads and legs, put them in the patio, and asked the three people to sit down in a cool place. Sanzang asked: ""Old donor, Gao's surname?"" The old man said: ""My surname is Wang."" ""How many servants are there?""","The old man then brought a young man in to present three cups of tea placed on a wooden tray. After the tea, he ordered a vegetarian meal to be prepared. Then the young man took an old, unvarnished table full of holes and several stools with broken legs, and placed them in the courtyard for the three of them to sit where it was cool. Only then did Tripitaka ask, “Old patron, what is your noble surname?” “Your humble servant goes by the surname of Wang,” said the old man. “And how many heirs do you have?” asked Tripitaka.",,"While the king ordered Tiger-Strength to be taken off for a restorative wash and comb, Monkey became an auspicious cloud once more and bore Tripitaka back down before the throne, where he was declared the victor. But just as the king was finally about to let them go, Deer-Strength made another petition. “My brother must have caught a cold and sneezed up there—the Buddhist didn’t win fair and square. I now challenge them to a contest of Guess What’s Inside the Box. If the Buddhists can outguess me, then let them go.","The old man came out again with a young man who was carrying a tray with three cups of tea on it, and when it had been drunk he gave instructions for a vegetarian meal to be prepared. The young man then brought out an old, dented, and unlacquered table, as well as a pair of benches with chipped tops and broken legs, which he put in a cool spot before asking the three of them to sit down. Sanzang then asked the old man his surname, and was told, “Your humble servant's surname is Wang.” “How many descendants have you?”"
“贤卿所奏有理。”就传招贤文榜，颁布天下：各府州县，不拘军民人等，但有读书儒流，文义明畅，三场精通者，前赴长安应试。,"""Xianqing's performance is justified."" The list of recruiting talents was passed on, and the world was promulgated: all prefectures, states, and counties, regardless of military and civilians, but those who have read Confucianism, have a clear literary meaning, and are proficient in three courses, go to Chang'an to take the exam.","“Our worthy subject has voiced a sound principle in his memorial,” said Taizong. He therefore issued a summons to be proclaimed throughout the empire: in every prefecture, county, and town, those who were learned in the Confucian classics, who could write with ease and lucidity, and who had passed the three sessions of examination,5 regardless of whether they were soldiers or peasants, would be invited to go to Chang’an to take the imperial examination.","The Judge said, “Your Majesty is clear sighted. Do not forget what you see now, and let it be known when you return among the living.","Any man, of whatever background, who could write well and was fluent enough in the Confucian classics to have passed the three basic literary qualifications should come to Chang’an to take the imperial civil service exam.","“The suggestion of our wise minister is right,” said the Emperor, and notices inviting worthy men to compete in the examinations were posted throughout the empire. All the Confucian scholars on the civil or military rolls in every prefecture, district and county who had distinguished themselves in the three-stage examinations for their understanding of literature were to go to Chang'an for a final test."

那菩萨到山脚下，有玉真观金顶大仙，在观门首接住，请菩萨献茶。菩萨不敢久停，对大仙曰；“今领如来法旨，上东土寻取经人去。”大仙道：“取经人几时方到？”菩萨道：“未定，约莫二三年间，或可至此。”遂辞了大仙，半云半雾，约记程途。有诗为证。诗曰:万里相寻自不言，却云谁得意难全？求人忽若浑如此，是我平生岂偶然？传道有方成是语，说明无信也虚传。愿倾肝胆寻相识，料想前头必有缘。,"When the Bodhisattva arrived at the foot of the mountain, there was a great immortal of Yuzhen Guan Jinding, who caught him at the head of the Guanmen and asked the Bodhisattva to offer tea. The Bodhisattva did not dare to stop for a long time, and said to the great immortal, ""I have received the decree of the Tathagata, and I will go to the east to find the scriptures."" The great immortal said: ""When will the scriptures arrive?"" ."" Then he resigned from the great immortal, half cloud and half fog, and made an appointment to record the journey. Poetry is proof. The poem says: Looking for each other in thousands of miles without saying a word, but who can be proud of it? Begging for someone like this, is it just an accident in my life? Evangelism is just a word, indicating that there is no faith and it is false. I am willing to dedicate my heart and courage to find acquaintances, and I expect that there must be a fate ahead.","The Gold Cicada Elder will clasp the candana.23 The Bodhisattva went to the bottom of the hill, where she was received at the door of the Jade Perfection Daoist Abbey by the Great Immortal of Golden Head. The Bodhisattva was presented with tea, but she did not dare linger long, saying, “I have received the dharma-decree of Tathāgata to look for a scripture pilgrim in the Land of the East.” The Great Immortal said, “When do you expect the scripture pilgrim to arrive?” “I’m not sure,” said the Bodhisattva. “Perhaps in two or three years’ time he’ll be able to get here.” So she took leave of the Great Immortal and traveled at an altitude halfway between cloud and mist in order that she might remember the way and the distance. We have a testimonial poem for her that says: A search through ten thousand miles—no need to say! To state who will be found is no easy thing. Has not seeking someone been just like this? What’s been my whole life, was that a mere chance? We preach the Dao, our method turns foolish When saying meets no belief; we preach in vain. To find some percipient I’d yield liver and gall. There’s affinity, I think, lying straight ahead.","Here a great calamity befell Chen, because of a wrong he had done in a former existence. One of the boatmen, Liu Hong, seeing the beautiful bride, arranged with his comrade to murder the husband, and throw his body into the river. He threatened to kill the wife if she did not obey him. She was watched and prevented from committing suicide. He collected her husband’s documents and decided to impersonate Chen. The night demons announced to the Dragon King that a man had been drowned. He ordered his body to be brought before him. At sight of it, he recognised the very man who had saved his life when he had been in the form of a fish, and had been bought for the mother. “One good turn deserves another! I must save this man, and restore his life.”","On taking her leave of the Buddha, Guanyin called her trusty disciple Hui’an to accompany her, for he possessed an iron staff weighing a thousand pounds, handy for pulverizing any incidental demons. Pausing only to take tea with the caretaker of the Taoist temple at the foot of Soul Mountain, whom she told to expect a scripture pilgrim in a couple of years’ time, they soared eastward at low altitude.","When the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain the Gold-headed Immortal of the Jade Truth Temple stopped her at the temple gate and invited her to take some tea. But she dared not stop for long, and so she said, “I have been given a sacred command by the Tathagata to go to the East and find a man who will come to fetch the scriptures.” “When will he arrive?” the Immortal asked. “It is not definite,” the Bodhisattva replied, “but he will probably reach here in two or three years' time.” She took her leave of the Immortal and as she traveled amid cloud and mist she estimated the distances. There are some verses to prove it: She cared nothing of the journey of ten thousand miles to find him, But worried about finding the right man. Looking for the man seemed to be very chancy, But how can it be a mere coincidence? One who teaches the Way for the wrong motives will distort it; He who explains it without faith will preach in vain. Whoever will try and know it with his whole being,"
却说他师徒两个，策马前来，直至山门首观看，果然是一座寺院。但见那层层殿阁，选迭廊房，三山门外，巍巍万道彩云遮；五福堂前，艳艳千条红雾绕。两路松篁，一林桧柏。两路松篁，无年无纪自清幽；一林桧柏，有色有颜随傲丽。又见那钟鼓楼高，浮屠塔峻。安禅僧定性，啼树鸟音闲。寂寞无尘真寂寞，清虚有道果清虚。诗曰：上刹祇园隐翠窝，招提胜景赛婆婆。果然净土人间少，天下名山僧占多。长老下了马，行者歇了担，正欲进门，只见那门里走出一众僧来。你看他怎生模样：头戴左笄帽，身穿无垢衣。铜环双坠耳，绢带束腰围。草履行来稳，木鱼手内提。口中常作念，般若总皈依。三藏见了，侍立门旁，道个问讯，那和尚连忙答礼，笑道失瞻，问：“是那里来的？请入方丈献茶。”三藏道：“我弟子乃东土钦差，上雷音寺拜佛求经。至此处天色将晚，欲借上刹一宵。”那和尚道：“请进里坐，请进里坐。”三藏方唤行者牵马进来。那和尚忽见行者相貌，有些害怕，便问：“那牵马的是个甚么东西？”三藏道：“悄言！悄言！他的性急，若听见你说是甚么东西，他就恼了。他是我的徒弟。”,"But he said that he had two masters and disciples, and they came on horseback until they watched at the head of the mountain gate. It was indeed a monastery. But I saw the halls and pavilions, the selected corridors, and outside the Sanshan Gate, majestic and colorful clouds covered it; in front of the Wufu Hall, a thousand red mists swirled around. Two pine trees, one forest of cypress. Two paths of pine trees, no age and no discipline, are secluded; one forest of cypress, colored and beautiful with pride. See also that the bell and drum tower is high, and the Buddha tower is steep. An Chan monk is steadfast, and the sound of trees and birds is idle. Lonely and dust-free is really lonely, and there is a clear and empty way. The poem says: Go to the hidden green nest of Gion, and recruit the grandmother of the beautiful scenery. Sure enough, there are few people in the Pure Land, and there are many famous mountain monks in the world. The elder got off the horse, and the traveler rested his load and was about to enter the door, when he saw a group of monks coming out of the door. Look at how he was born: wearing a left-handed hat on his head and wearing immaculate clothes. Brass loops double drop earrings. Silk belt cinches waist. The grass is stable, and the wooden fish is carried in the hand. Often thinking in the mouth, Prajna always takes refuge. When Sanzang saw him, he stood by the door and asked a question. The monk hurriedly answered the salute, smiled, and asked, ""Where did you come from? Please enter the abbot to offer tea."" Sanzang said: ""My disciple is the emperor of the East, and the sound of thunder is heard. The temple is worshiping Buddha and asking for scriptures. It will be late here, and I want to borrow the last night."" The monk said: ""Please come in and sit in, please come in and sit."" The monk suddenly saw Xing Xing's face, and was a little scared, so he asked: ""What is the thing that is leading the horse?"" Sanzang said: ""Quie Yan! Quiet! He is impatient, if he hears what you say, he will be annoyed. He is my apprentice.""","We were telling you about the disciple and master, who urged the horse forward and arrived at the front gate of the building. They saw that it was indeed a monastery with Tiers of towers and turrets, And rows of quiet chambers. Above the temple gate Hung the august panoply of colored nimbus; Before the Hall of Five Blessings Whirled a thousand strands of bright red mists. Two rows of pines and bamboos; One grove of juniper and cypress; Two rows of pines and bamboos Revealed their fair virtue unspoiled by time; One grove of juniper and cypress Displayed its chaste beauty in comely hues. They saw also the tall bell tower, The pagoda rugged, Monks in silent meditation And birds on trees gently cooing. A dustless seclusion was the real seclusion, For the quiescence of Dao was truly quiescent. The poem says: This temple, like Jetavana, hides in a jade-green grove. Its beauty surpasses even the Ṣaḍ-varṣa.1 Pure land among mankind is rare indeed: This world’s famed mountains are mostly held by monks. The priest dismounted, and Pilgrim laid down his load. They were about to walk through the gate when a monk came out. “How does he look?” you ask. He wore a hat pinned to the left And a robe most spotlessly pure. Two brass rings hung from his ears; A silk sash was wrapped round his waist. His straw sandals moved sedately; His hands carried a wooden fish. His mouth recited constantly The Wisdom he sought most humbly. When Tripitaka saw him, he stood waiting by the gate and saluted with his palms pressed together in front of him. The monk returned the greeting at once and said laughing, “I’m sorry, but I don’t know you!” He then asked, “Where do you come from? Please come in for some tea.” “Your disciple,” said Tripitaka, “has been sent by royal decree from the Land of the East to go to seek scriptures from Buddha in the Temple of Thunderclap. It was getting late when we arrived here, and we would like to ask for a night’s lodging in your fair temple.” “Please take a seat inside,” said the monk. Only then did Tripitaka call Pilgrim to lead the horse inside. When the monk caught sight of Pilgrim’s face, he became somewhat afraid and asked, “What’s that thing leading the horse?” “Speak softly!” said Tripitaka. “He’s easily provoked! If he hears you referring to him as a thing, he’ll get mad. He happens to be my disciple.”","The common people should not desecrate them Believers will then understand this Boundless Law. Then Buddha ascended and sat on the Lotus Throne, and ordered the two great tamers of dragons and tigers to beat the cloud drums, and invite the 3,000 Buddhas, the Four Temple Guardians, The Shining Ones, the Bodhisattvas, the 500 arhats, and all other denizens of all quarters of the Blessed Land of the Spiritual Mountain, together with all honored ones and all the holy monks. They were seated all in their respective places. Then heavenly music commenced simultaneously. When all the Buddhas had arrived, they bowed before Lord Buddha. Buddha asked Ananda and Kasyapa how many scriptures they had given him. They said 5,048 books had been selected and given to the holy monk from China. Each of the four pilgrims then folded his palms together and bowed towards Lord Buddha. Buddha spoke to the Master and said, “These Scriptures are priceless in value. Although they are Buddhist canons, they really contain the essence of the three religions of China, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. When you take them to your Southern Continent for the instruction of all, be careful not to desecrate them. Do not read them till you have bathed and fasted from flesh. Reverence them as great treasures, for in them you find the mystery of how to become divine, and you will receive wonderful light for the understanding of all things.” The Master bowed in thanksgiving, and received them all. When the Master had gone, Lord Buddha was about to dismiss the assembled court, when suddenly Guanyin entered, united her palms and said, “Some years ago I received your commands to go to the East and look for a man to fetch the Sacred Scriptures. Today that work is accomplished. It has taken 14 years, which is 5,040 days, which is eight days less than the number of books in the three collections of Sacred Scriptures you have given them. I beg that you authorize me to have the additional Scriptures sent to the East in eight days.” Buddha was greatly pleased at this, gave her an edict authorizing this, and ordered the Eight Messengers to have the holy monk return to China with the Scriptures within eight days, so that the days might tally with the number of the books in the collection. On no account should there be any delay. The Messengers then at once caught up the Master and said, “Scripture Seekers, follow us.” Then, feeling their bodies light and strong, they could feel themselves flying on clouds.","When will we reach Soul Mountain?” Just then, a woman of about thirty appeared. “Where did you come from?” she asked, leaning against the Pillar of Ultimate Peace. “Why are you tied to this post?” “Why waste your breath?” he answered through tear-clouded eyes. “I am doomed—doomed! Just eat me and put me out of my misery.” “I’m no cannibal!” protested the woman. “I’m the third daughter of the king of Precious Image, a citadel about three hundred miles west of here, and my name is Baihuaxiu—Hundred Flowers’ Shame. Thirteen years ago, this monster carried me off in a tornado and forced me to be his wife and have his children. In all this time, I’ve not been able to send any message to, much less see, my parents. But why has he captured you?” Tripitaka explained his mission and the misstep that had brought him there. “Now your husband is after my two disciples, so he can put us all in the same steamer.” The princess beamed. “Don’t worry. Precious Image lies on your route westward. If you take a letter to my parents, I’ll tell my husband to spare your life.” Tripitaka naturally agreed. The princess quickly wrote and sealed a letter, then untied Tripitaka. “Thank you,” he said, taking the note. “I promise to deliver it. But will your parents believe the letter is from you, after so many years of silence?” “Don’t worry. They’ll know.” Tripitaka lodged the letter deep in his sleeve and made for the door. The princess pulled him back. “You can’t go out the front! My husband’s goblins are all there, cheering on their king, who’s fighting your disciples. They’ll tear you apart the moment they see you. Best to go out the back. But wait for me to talk my husband around. If he agrees to let you go, your disciples can go with you.”","The master whipped on his horse and hurried straight to the temple gate with his disciple to have a look. They saw that it was indeed a monastery: Hall upon hall, Cloister after cloister. Beyond the triple gates Countless coloured clouds are massed; Before the Hall of Five Blessings Coil a thousand wisps of red mist. Two rows of pine and bamboo, A forest of locust and cypress trees. The two rows of pine and bamboo Are ageless in their elegant purity; The forest of locust and cypress trees Has color and beauty. See how high the drum and bell towers are, How tall the pagoda. In peaceful mediation the monks make firm their natures, As birds sing in the trees outside. Peace beyond mortal dust is the only true peace; Emptiness with the Way is the real emptiness. As the poem goes, A supreme Jetavana hidden in a green valley, A monastery set in scenery unbeaten in the world. Such pure lands are rare on earth; On most of the famous mountains dwell monks. Sanzang dismounted, Monkey laid down his burden, and they were just on the point of going in when a crowd of monks came out. This is how they were dressed: On their heads they wore hats pinned on the left, On their bodies were clothes of purity. Copper rings hung from their ears, And silken belts were tied around their waists. Slowly they walked on sandals of straw, As they held wooden clappers in their hands. With their mouths they were always chanting Their devotion to the Wisdom. When Sanzang saw them he stood respectfully beside the gate and greeted them. A monk hastily returned his greeting and apologized for not noticing them before. “Where are you from?” he asked, “please come to the abbot's rooms and have some tea.” “I have been sent from the East on an imperial mission to worship the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and ask for the scriptures,” Sanzang replied, “and as it is almost night we would like to ask for a night's lodging now that we are here.” “Come inside and sit down, come inside and sit down,” the monk said. When Sanzang told Monkey to lead the horse over, the monk was frightened at the sudden sight of him and asked, “What's that thing leading the horse?” “Keep your voice down,” Sanzang urged, “keep your voice down. He has a quick temper, and if he hears you referring to him as 'that thing,' he'll be furious. He's my disciple.”"
却说行者取了辟火罩，一筋斗送上南天门，交与广目天王道：“谢借！谢借！”天王收了道：“大圣至诚了。我正愁你不还我的宝贝，无处寻讨，且喜就送来也。”行者道：“老孙可是那当面骗物之人？这叫做好借好还，再借不难。”天王道：“许久不面，请到宫少坐一时何如？”行者道：“老孙比在前不同，烂板凳高谈阔论了；如今保唐僧，不得身闲。容叙！容叙！”急辞别坠云，又见那太阳星上，径来到禅堂前，摇身一变，变做个蜜蜂儿，飞将进去，现了本象，看时那师父还沉睡哩。行者叫道：“师父，天亮了，起来罢。”三藏才醒觉，翻身道：“正是。”穿了衣服，开门出来，忽抬头只见些倒壁红墙，不见了楼台殿宇，大惊道：,"But he said that the walker took the fire-proof cover and sent it to Nantianmen with a somersault, and handed it over to the Heavenly King Guangmu and said, ""Thank you for your loan! Thank you for your loan!"" , I have nowhere to ask for it, and I will send it if I am happy."" The walker said: ""Is Lao Sun the person who cheats in person? This is called good borrowing and repaying, and it is not difficult to borrow again."" The king said: ""I haven't seen you for a long time, please How about sitting in the palace for a while?"" The traveler said: ""Old Sun is different than before, and the rotten bench is talking about it; now the Tang monk can't be idle. Rong Xu! Rong Xu!"" , went straight to the front of the meditation hall, transformed into a bee, flew in, and realized the original image, when I saw that the master was still asleep. The traveler shouted, ""Master, it's dawn, get up."" Sanzang woke up and turned over and said, ""That's right."" After putting on his clothes, he opened the door and came out. Suddenly he looked up and saw some red walls that fell, and the buildings and palaces were gone. startled:","Now we shall tell you about Pilgrim, who, taking the Fire-Repelling Cover, sent it up to the South Heaven Gate with one somersault. He handed it back to the Broad-Eyed Devarāja, saying, “Thanks so much for lending it to me!” The Devarāja took it back and said, “The Great Sage is very honest. I was a little worried that if you did not return my treasure, I would have a hard time finding you. I’m glad you brought it right back.” “Do you think that old Monkey is the sort of person who steals openly?” asked Pilgrim. “As the saying goes, ‘Return what you borrow, and again you may borrow!’” “I haven’t seen you for a long time,” said the Devarāja, “and I would like to invite you to spend some time at my palace. How about it?” Pilgrim said, “Old Monkey can’t do what he did before, ‘squatting on a rotted bench and dispensing lofty discourse.’ Now that I have to protect the Tang Monk, I haven’t a moment’s leisure. Give me a rain check!” He took leave of the Devarāja quickly and dropped down from the clouds. As the sun arose, he arrived at the Chan hall, where with one shake of his body he changed again into a bee. When he flew inside and resumed his original form, he saw that his master was still sleeping soundly. “Master,” cried Pilgrim, “it’s dawn. Get up.” Only then did Tripitaka awake; he turned around, saying, “Yes, indeed!” Putting on his clothes, he opened the door and went out. As he raised his head, he saw crumbling walls and seared partitions; the towers, the terraces, and the buildings had all disappeared. “Ah!” he cried, greatly shaken.",,"Using the magic of Liquid Restriction, the dragon poured a cup of wine that rose up in the shape of a thirteen-story pagoda with a pointed roof. The entranced monster glugged the whole lot down, took another bite of the corpse, demanded a song, then accepted a second oversize goblet of drink. “Can you dance?” he now asked the disguised dragon. “A little, but it would be better if I had something to dance with.” The monster promptly unbuckled his sword and handed the blade over. The dragon-lady began a dance of extraordinary intricacy, moving the sword now to the left, now to the right, now up, now down. When the monster was utterly mesmerized, she suddenly broke off and thrust the sword hard at him. Only narrowly dodging the blow, the monster grabbed a wrought-iron candelabrum weighing eighty or ninety pounds, and the two of them battled their way out of the hall and into the air, where the palace lady changed back into a dragon. Eventually, though, the dragon—who was a somewhat petite creature, recall—grew tired. In desperation, he hurled the sword at the monster, who promptly caught it and, with his other hand, threw the candelabrum at the dragon. Caught off balance, the dragon took a blow to one of his hind legs. Falling out of the sky, he was saved only by the palace moat into which he plunged, immediately becoming invisible to the monster. Shrugging his shoulders, the monster returned to the Hall of Silver Peace with sword and candelabrum to drink himself into oblivion.","Brother Monkey grabbed the Anti-fire Cover, took it back to the Southern Gate of Heaven with a single somersault, and returned it to the Broad-visioned Heavenly King with thanks. “Great Sage,” said the Heavenly King as he accepted it. “You are as good as your word. I was so worried that if you didn't give me back my treasure, I'd never be able to find you and get it off you. Thank goodness you've returned it.” “Am I the sort of bloke who'd cheat someone to his face?” asked Monkey. “After all, 'If you return a thing properly when you borrow it, it'll be easier to borrow it next time.'” “As we haven't met for so long, why don't you come into the palace for a while?” said the Heavenly King. “I'm no longer the man to 'sit on the bench till it rots, talking about the universe,'“ Monkey replied. “I'm too busy now that I have to look after the Tang Monk. Please excuse me.” Leaving with all speed, he went down on his cloud, and saw that the sun was rising as he went straight to the meditation hall, where he shook himself, turned into a bee, and flew in. On reverting to his true form he saw that his master was still sound asleep. “Master, get up, it's dawn,” he called. Sanzang woke up, rolled over, and said, “Yes, so it is.” When he had dressed he opened the doors, went outside, and saw the walls reddened and in ruins, and the halls and towers gone. “Goodness,” he exclaimed in great astonishment, “why have the buildings all disappeared?"
这里麻绳喷水，紧紧的绑着，还比关在殿上被你使解锁法搠开门走哩！”行者道：“不是夸口说，那怕他三股的麻绳喷上了水，就是碗粗的棕缆，也只好当秋风！”正话处，早已万籁无声，正是天街人静。好行者，把身子小一小，脱下索来道：“师父去哑！”沙僧慌了道：“哥哥，也救我们一救！”行者道：“悄言！悄言！”他却解了三藏，放下八戒、沙僧，整束了褊衫，扣背了马匹，廊下拿了行李，一齐出了观门。又教八戒：“你去把那崖边柳树伐四颗来。”八戒道：“要他怎的？”行者道：“有用处，快快取来！”那呆子有些夯力，走了去，一嘴一颗，就拱了四颗，一抱抱来。行者将枝梢折了，将兄弟二人复进去，将原绳照旧绑在柱上。那大圣念动咒语，咬破舌尖，将血喷在树上，叫“变！”一根变作长老，一根变作自身，那两根变作沙僧、八戒，都变得容貌一般，相貌皆同，问他也就说话，叫名也就答应。他两个却才放开步，赶上师父。这一夜依旧马不停蹄，躲离了五庄观。只走到天明，那长老在马上摇桩打盹，行者见了，叫道：“师父不济！出家人怎的这般辛苦？我老孙千夜不眠，也不晓得困倦。,"Here the hemp ropes are sprayed with water and tied tightly, it is better than being locked in the hall and being unlocked by you to open the door! The walker said: ""I'm not boasting, even if his three-strand hemp rope is sprayed with water, even the thick brown cable, he has to be the autumn wind!"" ""The place where the truth is said, has long been silent, and it is the quietness of Tianjie. Good people, keep your body small, take off the cable and say: ""Master, go dumb!"" Sha Seng panicked: ""Brother, save us too!"" ""Walker said:"" Whisper! Whisper! But he solved Sanzang, put down Bajie and Sha Seng, bundled up his shirt, buckled his horse, took his luggage from the corridor, and went out of the gate together. He taught Bajie again: ""Go and cut down the willow tree by the cliff. Come four. ""Bajie said: ""What do you want him to do? The walker said: ""It is useful, quickly get it!"" ""The idiot had some ramming strength, and walked away. One mouthful, four arches, and one hug. The walker broke the branch tip, put the two brothers back in, and tied the original rope to the post as usual. The Great Sage chanted a spell, bit the tip of his tongue, sprayed blood on the tree, and called ""Change! ""One turned into an elder, the other turned into himself, and the other two turned into Shaman and Bajie, both of which had ordinary appearances, and they all had the same appearance. If they asked him, they would speak, and if they were named, they would agree. Only then did he let go of his steps and caught up with Master. He kept running non-stop that night, hiding from the Wuzhuang Temple. When he reached dawn, the elder was shaking a pile to take a nap right away, and the pilgrim saw it and shouted: ""Master is not good! Why is it so hard to be a monk? My grandson Qianye couldn't sleep, and he didn't know how sleepy he was.","We are tightly bound now in hemp ropes sprayed with water. They are not like the locks on those doors that you opened so easily with your magic!” “This is no exaggeration,” said Pilgrim, “but I’m not afraid of a three-ply hemp rope sprayed with water. Even if it were a coir cord as thick as a small bowl, I would consider it as insubstantial as the autumn wind!” Hardly had he finished speaking when it became completely quiet everywhere. Dear Pilgrim! He contracted his body and at once freed himself from the ropes, saying, “Let’s go, Master!” “Elder Brother,” said a startled Sha Monk, “save us, too!” “Speak softly! Speak softly!” said Pilgrim. He untied Tripitaka, Sha Monk, and Eight Rules; they put on their clothes, saddled the horse, and picked up the luggage from the corridor. As they walked out of the Abbey gate, Pilgrim said to Eight Rules, “Go to the edge of the cliff there and bring back four willow trees.” “What do you want them for?” asked Eight Rules. “I have use for them. Bring them quickly.” Idiot did possess some sort of brutish strength. He did as he was told, and with one shove of his snout he felled one of the willow trees. Knocking down three more, he gathered them up into a bundle and hauled them back. Pilgrim stripped the branches off the trunks, and the two of them carried the trunks inside, where they fastened them to the pillars with the ropes with which they had earlier been tied up themselves. Then the Great Sage recited a spell; biting the tip of his own tongue, he spat some blood on the trees and cried, “Change!” One of them changed into the elder, another changed into a figure like himself, and the two other trees changed into Sha Monk and Eight Rules. They all seemed to look exactly alike; when questioned, they knew how to make replies; when their names were called, they knew how to answer. Only then did the two of them run back out and catch up with their master. As before, the horse did not pause to rest for that whole night as they fled the Five Villages Abbey. When morning arrived, however, the elder was nodding on the horse, hardly able to remain in the saddle. When Pilgrim saw him like that, he called out, “Master, you are terribly soft! How is it that a person who has left home like yourself has so little endurance? If I, old Monkey, went without sleep even for a thousand nights, I still would not feel fatigue.",,"Steady now.” Once again the elderly turtle stretched out its legs and glided through the water as if on flat ground, carrying the four disciples and the horse toward the eastern shore. On they went until, approaching the east bank that afternoon, the turtle spoke again: “When I carried you across the river all those years ago, I begged you to ask the Buddha when I would be permitted to take human form. I wonder what he said.” Now Tripitaka, upon reaching the Western Heaven, had been very taken up with bathing in fragrant water, feasting on divine delicacies, shedding his mortal form, meeting the Buddha, and the like. Of course he hadn’t asked when the turtle would become human. He dared not lie; choosing instead to be economical with the truth, he fell silent. Instantly understanding what had happened, the turtle shook all its passengers into the river and dived down out of sight. It was just as well that Tripitaka had finally cast off his mortal body; otherwise, he would have sunk straight to the bottom. Pigsy, Sandy, and the horse, formerly a dragon, were of course perfectly at home in the water. A laughing Monkey, meanwhile, hauled Tripitaka out of the water and deposited him on the east bank. But clothes, scriptures, saddle, and bridle were soaked. With the sun still high in the sky, the pilgrims spread out the scriptures to dry on some nearby boulders. To Tripitaka’s dismay, when they tried to repack them, the scrolls of one sutra had stuck to the rocks and had to be torn off. For this reason, that sutra today remains incomplete, and the text can still be read on the boulder on which the scrolls were dried. “We should have been more careful,” tutted Tripitaka. “Nothing’s perfect,” Monkey said, laughing. “Not even Heaven and Earth. Now the sutra suits the flawed nature of the cosmos.” They stopped briefly for a meal at a monastery, where Pigsy complained that losing his mortal frame had quite taken away his appetite (but he still managed to put away nine dishes and twenty to thirty steamed buns). Just as the pilgrims were searching for the road to the east, the Buddha’s attendants called out to them from midair: “Follow us!” Tripitaka and the others rose weightlessly up into the second magic wind that the Buddha’s attendants had generated. In a matter of hours, Chang’an came into view. That day, the emperor happened to have climbed up to the Scripture Anticipation Tower that he had had built more than ten years previously. From this vantage point, he immediately noticed something unusual: fragrant winds and an auspicious haze emanating from the west. “We’ve reached our destination,” the Buddha’s attendants told Tripitaka, still in midair. “But as the locals are actually quite intelligent, we fear they might recognize us if we escort you to earth. Probably best if you go down alone, deliver the scriptures, then meet us back here, and we’ll return together to the Buddha.” “Tripitaka can’t manage all those bags and the horse on his own,” objected Monkey.","“They've tied us up with hempen ropes and spurted water on them, so we're tightly bound. This isn't like the time we were shut in the hall of the temple and you unlocked the doors to let us out.” “I'm not boasting,” said Monkey. “I don't give a damn about their three hempen ropes sprayed with water. Even if they were coconut cables as thick as a ricebowl they would only be an autumn breeze.” Apart from him speaking, all was now silence. Splendid Monkey made himself smaller, slipped out of his bonds, and said, “Let's go, master.” “Save us too, elder brother,” pleaded a worried Friar Sand. “Shut up, shut up,” Monkey replied, then freed Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand, straightened his tunic, tightened his belt, saddled the horse, collected their luggage from under the eaves, and went out through the temple gates with the others. “Go and cut down four of the willow-trees by that cliff,” he told Pig, who asked, “Whatever do you want them for?” “I've got a use for them,” Monkey replied. “Bring them here immediately.” The idiot Pig, who certainly had brute strength, went and felled each of them with a single bite, and came back holding them all in his arms. Monkey stripped off their tops and branches and told his two fellow-disciples to take the trunks back in and tie them up with the ropes as they themselves had been tied up. Then Monkey recited a spell, bit the tip of his tongue open, and spat blood over the trees. At his shout of “Change!” one of the trees turned into Sanzang, one turned into Monkey, and the other two became Friar Sand and Pig. They were all perfect likenesses; when questioned they would reply, and when called by their names they responded. The three disciples then hurried back to their master, and once more they traveled all night without stopping as they fled from the Wuzhuang Temple. By the time it was dawn the venerable Sanzang was swaying to and fro as he dozed in the saddle. “Master,” called Monkey when he noticed, “you're hopeless. You're a man of religion—how can you be finding it so exhausting? I can do without sleep for a thousand nights not feeling a bit tired."

那明月、清风，暗自夸称不尽道：“好和尚！真个是西方爱圣临凡，真元不昧。师父命我们接待唐僧，将人参果与他吃，以表故旧之情，又教防着他手下人罗唣。果然那三个嘴脸凶顽，性情粗糙，幸得就把他们调开了。若在边前，却不与他人参果见面。”清风道：“兄弟，还不知那和尚可是师父的故人，问他一问看，莫要错了。”二童子又上前道：“启问老师可是大唐往西天取经的唐三藏？”长老回礼道：“贫僧就是，仙童为何知我贱名？”童子道：“我师临行，曾吩咐教弟子远接。不期车驾来促，有失迎迓。老师请坐，待弟子办茶来奉。”三藏道：“不敢。”那明月急转本房，取一杯香茶，献与长老。茶毕，清风道：“兄弟，不可违了师命，我和你去取果子来。”,"Na Mingyue and Qingfeng secretly boasted and said: ""Good monk!

The monk is an old friend of Master, so if you ask him, don’t make a mistake.” The second boy stepped forward again and said, “Is Teacher Qiwen Tang Sanzang who went to the West to get scriptures from the Tang Dynasty?” The elder returned his salute and said, “The poor monk is the immortal. Why does the boy know my name?"" The boy said, ""When my teacher was leaving, I ordered my disciples to meet me at a distance. I didn't expect the car to come, so I'm sorry. Teacher, please take a seat and wait for the disciples to serve tea."" Sanzang said: "" Don't dare."" That Mingyue hurriedly turned to the room, took a cup of fragrant tea, and presented it to the elders. After tea, Qingfeng said, ""Brother, don't disobey your teacher's orders, I'll go get the fruit with you.""","Clear Breeze and Bright Moon, filled with admiration, said softly to each other: “What a monk! Truly the incarnation of a lovable sage of the West, whose true origin is not at all obscured! Well, our master did tell us to take care of the Tang Monk and to serve him some ginseng fruits as a token of past friendship. He also cautioned us about the rowdiness of his disciples, and he couldn’t have been more correct. It’s a good thing that those three, so fierce in their looks and so churlish in their manners, were sent away. For had they remained, they would certainly have to see the ginseng fruits.” Then Clear Breeze said, “Brother, we are still not quite certain whether that monk is really an old acquaintance of Master. We had better ask him and not make a mistake.” The two lads therefore went forward again and said, “May we ask the old master whether he is Tripitaka Tang from the Great Tang Empire, who is on his way to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven?” Returning their bows, the elder said, “I am, indeed. How is it that the immortal youths know my vulgar name?” “Before our master’s departure,” said one of them,” he gave us instructions that we should go some distance to meet you. We did not expect your arrival to be so soon, and thus we failed in the proper etiquette of greeting you. Please take a seat, Master, and allow us to serve you tea.” “I hardly deserve that,” said Tripitaka, but Bright Moon went quickly back to his room and brought back a cup of fragrant tea to present to the elder. After Tripitaka had drunk the tea, Clear Breeze said, “Brother, we must not disobey our master’s command. Let’s go and bring back the fruit.”",,"First ask him nicely for his heart: promise him a state funeral and a temple, with guaranteed sacrifices. If he doesn’t agree, just tie him up and gouge his heart out anyway. Child’s play.” As ever, the king followed his instructions to the letter. Having overheard all of this, Monkey flew back to the postal station, where Tripitaka and the others were enjoying their royal feast. “Disaster!” he exclaimed, suddenly reappearing as Monkey. Tripitaka promptly fainted. “Wake up!” urged Sandy, trying to get him upright. Monkey reported everything he had learned and that the postal station was about to be surrounded by soldiers. “You did a good thing rescuing those little boys,” concluded Pigsy. “ But now Tripitaka’s going to be in the soup—literally.” “Whatever shall we do?” beseeched Tripitaka, sweating with fear. “If we’re to get out of this fix,” considered Monkey, “we’ll need to swap identities. You’ll have to become my disciple for the day.” “If you can save my life,” pledged Tripitaka, “I’ll follow you to the ends of the earth.” “No time to waste,” said Monkey. “Pigsy: mud.” To avoid having to go outside—the soldiers could arrive at any moment— Pigsy pissed on a patch of the dirt floor, stirred it all together, and passed it to Monkey. Monkey molded this unlovely mixture over his face to fashion a mask, then pressed it onto Tripitaka’s face.","Bright Moon and Pure Wind were meanwhile quietly praising Sanzang to each other: “What a splendid monk. He is indeed the beloved sage of the West in mortal form, and his true nature is not at all befuddled. The master told us to entertain him and give him some manfruit as a token of their old friendship, and he also warned us to be on our guard against those hooligans of his. They have murderous-looking faces and coarse natures. Thank goodness he sent them away, because if they were still with him, we wouldn't be able to give him the manfruit.” “We don't yet know whether this monk is our master's old friend or not,” said Pure Wind. “We'd better ask him to make sure.” The two of them then went over to Sanzang and said, “May we ask you, venerable master, whether you are the Sanzang of the Great Tang who is going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures?” “Yes, I am,” said Sanzang, returning their bows. “How did you know who I was?” “Our master told us before he went,” they replied, “to go out to meet you long before you got here, but as you came faster than we expected we failed to do so. Please sit down, teacher, while we fetch you some tea.” “I am honoured,” said Sanzang. Bright Moon hurried out and came back with a cup of fragrant tea for him. When Sanzang had drunk the tea, Pure Wind said to Bright Moon, “We must do as our teacher told us and fetch the fruit.”"

Called: ""Children, open your eyes."" All the monkeys were on the ground, recognizing their hometown, all rejoiced, and they all ran to the old road of Dongmen. The monkeys in the cave all crowded in together, divided into groups, and worshipped the Monkey King. Arranged wine and fruit, received the wind and congratulated him, and asked about the matter of subduing the devil and saving the child. Wukong made a detailed remark, and the monkeys praised them all: ""Your Majesty went to that place, I didn't intend to learn such a trick!"" Wukong said again: ""I said goodbye to you, I drifted with the current, drifted across the eastern sea, and headed to the south. Libuzhou, learnt to be a human figure, wears this clothes, wears this shoes, swaying and swaying, wandering around for more than 8 or 9 years, not to mention the Tao; he also crossed the Western Ocean to the boundary of Xiniu Hezhou, visited for a long time, and was fortunate to meet an old ancestor. , passed on the true fruit of my longevity with Heaven, the great method of immortality and longevity."" All the monkeys congratulated him. All said: ""Once upon a time!"" Wukong laughed again: ""Little ones, I also like that I have a surname."" The monkeys said: ""What is the surname of the king?"" Wukong said: ""My surname is Sun today. The name of the Dharma is Wukong.” The monkeys heard this, applauded and said: “The king is the old grandson, we are all the second grandson, the third grandson, the young grandson, the young grandson, the grandson of one family, the grandson of a country, and the grandson of a nest! ""All come to flatter the old grandson, big pots and small bowls, coconut wine, wine, fairy flowers, fairy fruits, it's a family joy! what! Through a surname to return to its originality, only waiting for the name of the immortal to be relocated. After all, I don't know how to produce results, what is the end of this world, let's listen to the next decomposition.","Dear Monkey King. He recited a spell, rode for a while on a fierce wind, and then lowered the direction of the cloud. “Little ones,” he cried, “open your eyes!” The monkeys felt solid ground beneath their feet and recognized their home territory. In great delight, every one of them ran back to the cave along the familiar roads and crowded in together with those waiting in the cave. They then lined up according to age and rank and paid tribute to the Monkey King. Wine and fruits were laid out for the welcome banquet. When asked how he had subdued the monster and rescued the young ones, Wukong presented a detailed rehearsal, and the monkeys broke into unending applause. “Where did you go, Great King?” they cried. “We never expected that you would acquire such skills!” “The year I left you all,” Wukong said, “I drifted with the waves across the Great Eastern Ocean and reached the West Aparagodānīya Continent. I then arrived at the South Jambūdvīpa Continent, where I learned human ways, wearing this garment and these shoes. I swaggered along with the clouds for eight or nine years, but I had yet to learn the Great Art. I then crossed the Great Western Ocean and reached the West Aparagodānīya Continent.17 After searching for a long time, I had the good fortune to discover an old Patriarch, who imparted to me the formula for enjoying the same age as Heaven, the secret of immortality.” “Such luck is hard to meet even after ten thousand afflictions!” the monkeys said, all congratulating him. “Little ones,” Wukong said, laughing again, “another delight is that our entire family now has a name.” “What is the name of the great king?” “My surname is Sun,” replied Wukong, “and my religious name is Wukong.” When the monkeys heard this, they all clapped their hands and shouted happily, “If the great king is Elder Sun, then we are all Junior Suns, Suns the Third, small Suns, tiny Suns—the Sun Family, the Sun Nation, and the Sun Cave!” So they all came and honored Elder Sun with large and small bowls of coconut and grape wine, of divine flowers and fruits. It was indeed one big happy family! Lo, The surname is one, the self’s returned to its source. This glory awaits—a name recorded in Heaven! We do not know what the result was and how Wukong would fare in this realm; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.","He then uttered an incantation, and a strong wind carried them over the clouds. When he descended from the clouds he called on them to open their eyes. They then found they were at home again, and were very glad, and ran into the cave as of old. Then all the monkeys assembled in the cave to welcome the king and get ready a banquet. They asked him how he had vanquished the Demon King. The Seeker of Secrets told them the whole story. The monkeys’ praises were interminable, and they asked, “Where, Oh King, did you learn all these wonders?” He answered, “That year when I left you, I sailed across the China Sea till I reached the Southern Continent and there I learnt how to become human, and put on clothes and wear boots for some 8 or 9 years, but had not found the secret forces of nature. I then crossed over the great Western Ocean till I reached the Unicorn Continent in the West, and searched for this secret for a long time. Finally I met an old patriarch who taught me the true way of living eternal as the heavens, so as never to become old.” All the monkeys congratulated him on having discovered how to avoid all calamities. The Seeker of Secrets smiled on his followers and said, “You may congratulate me on one other thing. You all have a family name now.” They all cried, “Oh King, what is thy name?” The king said, “My surname is Sun, which means macaque, and my name is the Seeker of Secrets.” When they heard this, they clapped their hands with great joy and said, “The great King is the venerable Sun, we are his sons and grandsons, one family and one nation—all of the same name. Let us all honor our ancestor Sun with cups of coconut wine, grape wine, and fairest fruits, for this is a great joy to the whole family.”","That marvelous monkey muttered a spell, swept up the others in a wind-propelled cloud, and landed smoothly back on Flower-Fruit Mountain. “Open your eyes, little ones.” Immediately recognizing their old home, the delighted monkeys rushed into the cave and lined up with the others before Monkey. They held a celebratory banquet of fruits and wine, during which Monkey regaled them with the story of how he had defeated the monster. “Where were you all that time, great king?” they wanted to know next. “How did you learn this magic?” Monkey gave them an unexpurgated version of his travels—including Subodhi’s imparting of immortality. “What luck!” applauded the monkeys, toasting their king with bowls of coconut-and-grape wine, divine flowers and fruit.","Splendid Monkey King. He recited a spell, took them riding on a hurricane, then brought the cloud down to the ground. “Open your eyes and look, children,” he shouted. As soon as the monkeys' feet touched the ground they recognized their home. In their delight they all ran along the familiar path to the cave, and the monkeys who had stayed in the cave all crowded in as well. They divided themselves into age-groups and bowed in homage to the Monkey King. Wine and food was laid out to celebrate, and they asked him how he had defeated the demon king and saved their children. When Sun Wukong had told them the whole story the monkeys were full of admiration. “Where did you learn such arts, Your Majesty?” they asked insistently. “When I left you,” Sun Wukong replied, “I followed the waves and the currents, and drifted across the Eastern Ocean to the Southern Jambu Continent. Here I taught myself to take human form and to wear these clothes and boots. I swaggered around for eight or nine years, but I never found the Way, so I sailed across the Western Ocean to the Western Continent of Cattle-gift. After long enquiries I was lucky enough to meet a venerable Immortal, who taught me the True Result, which makes me as immortal as heaven, and the great Dharma Gate to eternal youth.” The monkeys all congratulated him and exclaimed that his like could not be found in a billion years. Sun Wukong laughed and said, “Children, we should congratulate ourselves on having a surname.” “What is Your Majesty's surname?” the monkey masses asked. “My surname is now Sun, and my Buddhist name is Wukong.” The monkeys all clapped their hands with joy and said, “Your Majesty is Old Sun, and we are Second Sun, Third Sun, Thin Sun, Little Sun—a family of Suns, a nation of Suns, a den of Suns.” They all offered Old Sun their respects, with big plates and small bowls of coconut toddy, grape wine, magic flowers, and magic fruit. The whole household was happy. My word! By uniting themselves with a single surname They are waiting to be transferred to the Register of Immortals. If you don't know how this ended and want to know about the rest of their lives there, then listen to the explanation in the next installment."

Formerly we were intimate, and your face and voice are still before me. But several years have now passed and I have had no opportunity of receiving from you more instruction, such as you often gave me before. But in my dreams I receive your advice, and thus know you have been highly promoted. But alas, we are now separated by the great gulf of life and death, and cannot see each other face to face. Now, because my emperor is gone from the living, his case will be brought before the Court of Hell, and he is sure to meet you. I beg of you to remember a thousand times our former friendship, and devise some means by which my emperor will be restored to earth again without much difficulty, for which I shall be eternally grateful to you.” Judge Cui was much pleased with the letter and said, “I know all about Judge Wei beheading the Old Dragon in his dream.","He had a snout riddled with holes like a lotus seed pod, his ears fanned out like palm leaves, and his yellow eyes gleamed between.

What have I accomplished?” The Brothers Kang, Zhang, Yao, and Li said, “Elder Brother need have no further discussion. Let us take this fellow up to the Jade Emperor to see what will be done with him.” “Worthy Brothers,” said the Immortal Master, “you may not have a personal audience with the Jade Emperor because you have not received any divine appointment. Let the celestial guardians take him into custody. I shall go with the Devarāja to the Region Above to make our report, while all of you make a thorough search of the mountain here. After you have cleaned it out, go back to the River of Libations. When I have our deeds recorded and received our rewards, I shall return to celebrate with you.” The four grand marshals and the two generals followed his bidding. The Immortal Master then mounted the clouds with the rest of the deities, and they began their triumphal journey back to Heaven, singing songs of victory all the way. In a little while, they reached the outer court of the Hall of Perfect Light, and the Heavenly preceptor went forward to memorialize to the Throne, saying, “The Four Great Devarājas have captured the monstrous monkey, the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven. They await the command of Your Majesty.” The Jade Emperor then gave the order that the demon king Mahābāli and the celestial guardians take the prisoner to the monster execution block, where he was to be cut to small pieces.

The merit does not belong to me.” The Four Governors said, “Take this slave to the Jade Emperor.” The Divine Kinsman said, “As some of you have not been registered in Heaven, you cannot see the Jade Emperor. Let the six first ranks of the heavenly spirits ascend to Heaven and report. Let the generals of the army remain here to search the mountain. When you have searched it all then return to the Guanzhou River and wait until I get you a reward so that we may rejoice together.” So the governors and the two commanders-in-chief remained behind and the Divine Kinsman with his company mounted the cloud and sang a song of victory, as they wended their way to Heaven. Soon they arrived at the Dongming Hall. The heavenly generals said, “The Four Great Heavenly Princes and their followers have now caught the Monkey Demon, and have arrived here to await your commands.” The Jade Emperor then ordered that the chief and all the heavenly hosts should be quartered in the new demon terrace, and that the captive should be flayed alive.","Laozi retrieved his circlet and suggested that the Jade Emperor and his retinue return to the Hall of Divine Mists, while the expeditionary forces congratulated themselves on a job well done and packed up for home.

Erlang was richly rewarded—with a hundred golden flowers, bottles of wine, tablets of elixir, and countless other treasures—and sent back home.

They went over to congratulate the Little Sage and said, “It was all thanks to you, Little Sage.” “No, it was thanks to the great blessings of His Celestial Majesty and the might of all the gods—it was nothing I did,” replied the Little Sage. “No time to talk now, elder brother,” said the four marshals Kang, Zhang, Yao, and Li. “Let's take this wretch up to Heaven to see the Jade Emperor and ask what is to be done with him.” “Worthy brothers,” Erlang replied, “you never received any heavenly commission, so it would not be right for you to see the Jade Emperor. The heavenly soldiers can escort him while I go up there with the Heavenly Kings to report back. You should comb this mountain with your troops, and when you've finished go back to Guanjiangkou. When I've asked for our rewards, I'll come back and we can celebrate together.” The four marshals and the two generals accepted their orders, and the rest mounted their clouds and went to Heaven triumphantly singing victory songs. Before long they were outside the Hall of Universal Brightness. The heavenly teachers reported to the throne that the Four Great Heavenly Kings and the rest of them had captured the monkey devil, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, and were now waiting to be summoned. The Jade Emperor then issued an edict ordering the Strong-arm Demon King and the heavenly soldiers to march him to the Demon-beheading Tower, where the wretch was to have his body chopped to mincemeat. Goodness! The bully and cheat now meets with a bitter punishment, The heroic spirit must now come to an end.

Mrs. Zhang said: ""Congratulations to my son, and he is married again."" Guangrui said: ""The child is blessed by his mother, and he is the champion of the middle class. He was given a parade through the streets. He passed by the gate of the Prime Minister Yin's house. The young lady is about to recruit her son-in-law as her son-in-law. In addition to the baby being the governor of Jiangzhou, the imperial court has come to pick up her mother and go to work together.” Zhang Shi was overjoyed and packed up the itinerary. On the road for a few days, before going to Wanhuadian Liu Xiaoer's house to settle down, Zhang's body suddenly became ill, and he said to Guangrui: ""I am uneasy, and I will go back to the store for two days."" Guangrui obeyed.

When he returned to the store and told his mother about this, Mrs. Zhang said, ""It's a good thing to release the life, and I'm very happy.""

The child wants to get up tomorrow, and I don't know if the mother is in good health. ?""","As his home was on the way, Guangrui returned to his house where husband and wife bowed together to his mother, Lady Zhang. “Congratulations, my son,” said she of the Zhang family, “you even came back with a wife!” “Your child,” said Guangrui, “relied on the power of your blessing and was able to attain the undeserved honor of zhuangyuan. By imperial command I was making a tour of the streets when, as I passed by the mansion of Chief Minister Yin, I was hit by an embroidered ball. The chief minister kindly gave his daughter to your child to be his wife, and His Majesty appointed him governor of Jiangzhou. I have returned to take you with me to the post.” She of the Zhang family was delighted and packed at once for the journey. They had been on the road for a few days when they came to stay at the Inn of Ten Thousand Flowers, kept by a certain Liu Xiaoer. She of the Zhang family suddenly became ill and said to Guangrui, “I don’t feel well at all. Let’s rest here for a day or two before we journey again.” Guangrui obeyed. Next morning there was a man outside the inn holding a golden carp for sale, which Guangrui bought for a string of coins. He was about to have it cooked for his mother when he saw that the carp was blinking its eyes vigorously. In astonishment, Guangrui said, “I have heard that when a fish or a snake blinks its eyes in this manner, that’s the sure sign that it’s not an ordinary creature!” He therefore asked the fisherman, “Where did you catch this fish?” “I caught it,” said the fisherman, “from the river Hong, some fifteen miles from this district.” Accordingly, Guangrui sent the live fish back to the river and returned to the inn to tell his mother about it. “It is a good deed to release living creatures from captivity,” said she of the Zhang family. “I am very pleased.” “We have stayed in this inn now for three days,” said Guangrui. “The imperial command is an urgent one. Your child intends to leave tomorrow, but he would like to know whether mother has fully recovered.”","Or is it some demon that is alarming the whole family?” Minister Wei said, “It is not a demon, it is only the emperor’s soul returning. Bring implements to open the coffin at once!” They did so and then they saw the emperor sit up, still crying, “You are drowning me! Who will take me out of the water?” Xu Mao and others went forward and said, “Do not be alarmed! Your Majesty is waking up from a dream. Your ministers are all here looking after your safety.” The emperor opened his eyes and said, “I have come from great trouble and have just escaped from the hungry demons of Hell and from drowning.” The ministers asked, “What dangers were your Majesty in?” The emperor said, “I was riding, and when I got to the Wei River, I saw two fish playing with each other, and watched them until the Executioner Zhao pushed me into the river, and almost drowned me.” Minister Wei said, “Your Majesty is still ill and your mind is wandering. You must get the doctor at once to give you medicine to restore you to your natural health of body and mind.” It should be stated that the emperor had been dead for three days and nights when he returned to earth again. It was now evening and the ministers advised the emperor to sleep and they all retired. Next morning they put off their mourning robes and appeared in their court robes, each with his red and black hat, purple silks, and badges, waiting outside the door to be called in. The emperor had a good sleep the whole night and was much refreshed.","Since the road to Jiangzhou passed by Haizhou, Guangrui paid a visit to his old home, where he and his wife bowed to his mother. “Congratulations!” Mrs. Zhang exclaimed. “A job and a wife!” After Guangrui explained how it had all come about, he invited his mother to accompany them to his new posting. She happily accepted, and the three of them set out again. After a few days on the road, they put up at the Myriad Flowers Inn. That evening, Guangrui’s mother suddenly fell ill and asked to rest for a couple of days before they continued on their way. The following morning, Guangrui bought a live golden carp from a hawker outside the inn, with a view to having it cooked for his mother. Just as he was about to order it to be gutted, he noticed it blinking its eyes energetically. “I heard somewhere that this is a sign of supernatural abilities,” he observed, and—after asking for directions from the fisherman—returned it to the river where it had been caught. Although his mother was pleased to learn what Guangrui had done, she still did not feel well enough to travel, especially as it was the hottest time of the year.","Chen Guangrui was able to call at his own home on the way, so he and his bride could pay their respects to his mother, Madame Zhang. “Congratulations, my son,” she said. “And you have brought a bride back with you too.” “Thanks to my mother's blessings, your son was placed first in the examinations,” he replied, “and given a parade through the streets on His Majesty's orders. As I was passing the gateway of minister Yin's residence, I happened to be hit by an embroidered ball, and the minister was kind enough to give me his daughter's hand. The court has appointed me prefect of Jiangzhou, so I have come to fetch you, mother, and take you with me to my post.” Madame Zhang was overjoyed, and she packed her luggage and traveled with them. One night, after they had been on the road for several days, they put up at the Liu the Second's Ten Thousand Flowers Inn, where Madame Zhang was suddenly taken ill. “As I'm not feeling well,” she said to her son, “I'd better stay in this inn for a couple of days to get over it before going on.” Chen Guangrui accepted her suggestion. The next morning he saw a man selling a golden-coloured carp in front of the inn and brought it from him for a string of copper coins, intending to have it lightly fried for his mother. Then he noticed it blinking. “It's said that if a fish or a snake blinks it is no ordinary creature,” he thought. He asked the fisherman where he had caught it. “In the Hongjiang River, five miles from the prefectural capital,” the fisherman replied. Chen Guangrui had the fish taken back to the Hongjiang River to be released there, then went back to the inn to tell his mother about what had happened. “It is good to release living things,” his mother said, “and I am very pleased.” Then Chen Guangrui said, “We have been at this inn for three days, and the time limit set for me is a tight one, so I must be on my way tomorrow morning. Are you well enough yet, mother?”"

Since I am trapped by the Buddha Tathagata, when will I relax and show my power again!","I rue the impish ape not heeding the Law, Who let loose wild heroics in bygone years.

Back to the light, Ning Xin sits in the inner light, and the sun and the moon are in the middle of the body. Don't think about everything and have few desires, the six pure bodies are firm. Rejuvenation is easy to get, and the way to the sage is not a long way. After three years without leakage, he became an immortal body, and different vulgar generations were tormented. Ten continents and three islands are still playing games, and the corners of the world have turned around. You deserve to be more than three hundred years old, and you must not soar to the sky. Going to the sea and subduing the dragon is a real treasure, only one golden hoop stick. In front of Huaguo Mountain is the handsome head, and there are monsters in the Water Curtain Cave. The Jade Emperor made a propaganda decree to seal me the highest grade in the sky. He made a lot of trouble in Lingxiao Hall several times, and he stole the Queen Mother's peach several times. One hundred thousand heavenly soldiers came down to me, densely covered with guns and knives. After the battle, the king returned to the upper realm, and Nezha led his troops to flee in pain. Xiansheng Zhenjun can change, Lao Sun bet on a level trade. Guanyin, the ancestor of Taoism, and the Jade Emperor, watched the demon from the Nantianmen. But I was helped by Lao Jun for a while, Erlang captured me and took me to Tiancao. Tie your body to the Demon Subduing Pillar, that is, order the Divine Soldier to take the head owl.","He gave me those high secrets of the gods; With no foundation I would have been lost. My inner light relumed, I sat in peace As sun and moon mated within myself.5 I thought of nothing—all my desires gone, My body strengthened, my six senses cleansed. From age back to youth was an easy boon; To join transcendents was no distant goal. Three years without leaks6 made a godlike frame, Immune to sufferings known to mortal men. Playing through the Ten Islets and Three Isles, I made the rounds at Heaven’s very edge. I lived like that for some three hundred years, Though not yet ascended to the Ninefold Heaven. Taming sea dragons brought me treasure true: The golden-hooped rod I did find below. As field marshal at the Flower-Fruit Mount, Monsters I gathered at Water-Curtain Cave. Then the Jade Emperor gave to me the name, Equal to Heaven— such, the rank most high. Thrice I caused havoc in Divine Mists Hall; Once I stole peaches from the Mother Queen. Thus came a hundred thousand men divine To curb me with their rows of spears and swords. The Devarāja was beaten back to Heaven, While Naṭa in pain led his troops and fled. Xiansheng Master7 knew transformations well; With him I waged a contest and I fell. Laozi, Guanyin, and the Jade Emperor All watched the battle at South Heaven Gate. When Laozi decided to lend his help, Erlang brought me to Heaven’s magistrate. To the monster-routing pillar I was tied; The gods were told to have my head cut off.",,"“How dare you harass me in my own home!” The two waged battle on a nearby mountaintop until the monster misread a Monkey feint and Monkey smashed his staff down on Yellow-Robe’s head. The monster instantly vanished without a trace. Concluding that his foe had to be a deity of some sort—only immortals could pull off this kind of top-notch disappearing trick—Monkey somersaulted up to Heaven and demanded a full roll call of all the spirits. Eventually, it was discovered that the Wood-Wolf Star had been absent without leave for thirteen days—thirteen years in earthly time. On the orders of the Jade Emperor, Wood-Wolf’s astral colleagues recited a spell to draw him out of his present hiding place, in a mountain stream. As the errant constellation approached the gate of Heaven, Monkey was all for bashing him some more; it was only thanks to the intervention of Wood-Wolf’s celestial colleagues that he made it as far as a hearing in front of the Jade Emperor. “Why,” asked the emperor, “did you abandon Heaven for the mortal world?” “Forgive me, Your Majesty,” Wood-Wolf beseeched, kowtowing. “The princess of Precious Image is no ordinary woman—she is the Jade Lady in charge of heavenly incense. When she asked me to have an affair with her, I refused her on the grounds that it might anger you. Then she said we should elope to the mortal world and immediately took over the body of the princess of Precious Image. After she’d gone to all this trouble, it seemed rude not to play along, so I turned into a monster, occupied a mountain, kidnapped her in a scented cyclone, and made her my wife for thirteen years.” Taking a dim view of these shenanigans, the Jade Emperor promptly demoted Wood-Wolf Star to fire-tending duties in the Tushita Palace. “Thanks and so long!” whooped Monkey. “Still haven’t learned any manners, Monkey?” snarked one of the Heavenly courtiers. The Jade Emperor was phlegmatic.","I learned a great spell of immortality. I could scarcely have survived without it. Turning my gaze inwards, I sat and calmed my mind, While the sun and moon in my body intermingled. Ignoring the affairs of the world, I made my desires few, When senses, body, and mind were purified, my body was firm. Reversing the years and returning to youth is then easily done; The road to immortality and sagehood was not long. In three years I acquired a magic body, That did not suffer like a common one. I wandered around the Ten Continents and Three Islands, The corners of the sea and the edge of the sky. I was due to live over three hundred years But could not yet fly up to the Nine Heavens. I got a real treasure for subduing sea dragons: An iron cudgel banded with gold. On the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit I was supreme commander; In the Water Curtain Cave I assembled the fiendish hosts. The Great Jade Emperor sent me a decree Conferring high rank and the title 'Equaling Heaven'. More than once I wrecked the Hall of Miraculous Mist, And stole the Queen Mother's peaches several times. A hundred thousand heavenly soldiers in serried ranks Came with spears and swords to put me down. I sent the heavenly kings back up there in defeat, Made Nazha flee in pain at the head of his men. The True Lord Erlang, skilled at transformations, Lao Zi, Guanyin and the Jade Emperor Watched me being subdued from the Southern Gate of Heaven. As he was given some help by Lord Lao Zi, Erlang captured me and took to Heaven. I was tied to the Demon-subduing Pillar, And divine soldiers were ordered to cut off my head."
至次日，点札风伯、雷公、云童、电母，直至长安城九霄空上。他挨到那巳时方布云，午时发雷，未时落雨，申时雨止，却只得三尺零四十点，改了他一个时辰，克了他三寸八点，雨后发放众将班师。他又按落云头，还变作白衣秀士，到那西门里大街上，撞入袁守诚卦铺，不容分说，就把他招牌、笔、砚等一齐捽碎。那先生坐在椅上，公然不动。这龙王又轮起门板便打、骂道：“这妄言祸福的妖人，擅惑众心的泼汉！你卦又不灵，言又狂谬！说今日下雨的时辰点数俱不相对，你还危然高坐，趁早去，饶你死罪！”守诚犹公然不惧分毫，仰面朝天冷笑道：“我不怕！我不怕！我无死罪，只怕你倒有个死罪哩！别人好瞒，只是难瞒我也。我认得你，你不是秀士，乃是泾河龙王。你违了玉帝敕旨，改了时辰，克了点数，犯了天条。你在那剐龙台上，恐难免一刀，你还在此骂我？”龙王见说，心惊胆战，毛骨悚然，急丢了门板，整衣伏礼，向先生跪下道：“先生休怪。前言戏之耳，岂知弄假成真，果然违犯天条，奈何？望先生救我一救！,"To the next day, point to Zha Fengbo, Lei Gong, Yun Tong, and Dian Mu until the sky above Chang'an City. When he got there, Fang Buyun, thunder at noon, and rain before it rained, when the rain stopped, but only three feet and forty points, changed him by one hour, beat him by three inches and eight points, and distributed the generals after the rain. return after victory. He pressed the cloud head down again, and turned into a scholar in white clothes. He went to Ximenli Street and crashed into Yuan Shoucheng's hexagram shop. The gentleman sat in his chair, blatantly motionless. The Dragon King turned the door and beat and scolded: ""This demon who talks about good fortune and good fortune, and a bastard who is good at deceiving people's hearts! Your hexagrams are ineffective, and your words are ridiculous! Saying that the time of day when it rains is not the same, You are still sitting at risk, go as soon as possible, and spare you the death penalty!"" Shoucheng was still openly not afraid, and sneered with his face up to the sky: ""I am not afraid! I am not afraid! It's just hard to hide from me. I know you, you are not a scholar, but the Dragon King of Jinghe. You violated the imperial edict of the Jade Emperor, changed the time, scored points, and violated the rules of heaven. You are on the Dragon Slaying Platform. You are still scolding me here?"" When the Dragon King saw this, he was frightened and horrified, and he threw the door panel in a hurry. , it really violates the rules of heaven, but what? Mr. Wang save me!","The next day he ordered the Duke of Wind, the Lord of Thunder, the Boy of Clouds, and the Mother of Lightning to go with him to the sky above Chang’an. He waited until the hour of the Serpent before spreading the clouds, the hour of the Horse before letting loose the thunder, the hour of the Sheep before releasing the rain, and only by the hour of the Monkey did the rain stop.22 There were only three feet and forty drops of water, since the times were altered by an hour and the amount was changed by three inches and eight drops. After the rain, the Dragon King dismissed his followers and came down from the clouds, transformed once again into a scholar dressed in white. He went to the West Gate Street and barged into Yuan Shoucheng’s shop. Without a word of explanation, he began to smash the shop sign, the brushes, and the ink slab to pieces. The Master, however, sat on his chair and remained unmoved, so the Dragon King unhinged the door and threatened to hit him with it, crying, “You’re nothing but a bogus prophet of good and evil, an imposter who deludes the minds of the people! Your predictions are incorrect; your words are patently false! What you told me about the time and quantity of today’s rain was utterly inaccurate, and yet you dare sit so smugly and so high on your seat? Leave here at once before you are executed!” Still Yuan Shoucheng was not at all intimidated. He lifted up his head and laughed scornfully. “I’m not afraid!” he said. “Not in the least! I’m not guilty of death, but I fear that you have committed a mortal crime. You can fool other people, but you can’t fool me! I recognize you, all right: you are not a white-robed scholar but the Dragon King of the Jing River. By altering the times and holding back the quantity of rain, you have disobeyed the decree of the Jade Emperor and transgressed the law of Heaven. On the dragon execution block you won’t escape the knife! And here you are, railing at me!” When the Dragon King heard these words, his heart trembled and his hair stood on end. He dropped the door quickly, tidied his clothes, and knelt before the Master saying, “I beg the Master not to take offense. My previous words were spoken in jest; little did I realize that my prank would turn out to be such a serious crime. Now I have indeed transgressed the law of Heaven. What am I to do? I beseech the Master to save me.","Zhu Bajie said, “That is all very well for you to say, but I have a load to carry from day to day, do not forget that, and do not treat me as a common coolie. The horse is fat and strong and only carries the Master, why not put some of my load on the horse?” The Monkey said, “This horse was originally the third son of one of the dragon kings, and as he broke one of the laws of Heaven he would have been killed, but for Guanyin’s mercy in sparing his life, on condition that he should carry the Master. Carry your load yourself!’” On hearing this, Zhu Bajie started to wonder just what was going on. When night came they arrived at a house occupied by a widow and her three daughters, and they asked for lodging. The mother welcomed them heartily, and told them how she became a widow and was now well to do. What troubled her was that there was no husband, or son, or son-in-law, to whom to leave her ten thousand acres of land. “Now that we are four women and you are four men, is it not providential that you have come here?” At this speech the Master pretended to be deaf and dumb. She went on to say there were 300 acres of dry land, 300 of watered land, 300 of orchard and forests, horses and cattle in droves, sheep and pigs without number, sixty or seventy farms, clothing enough to last for years, and grain and silver in abundance. “You had better stay here and have a comfortable home without care, rather than the troubles of travel to the West.” The Master was silent. She again spoke, “I am forty-five years old, my eldest daughter is twenty, the second eighteen, and the third sixteen.","The next day, the dragon king ordered the Duke of Wind, the Lord of Thunder, the Page Boy of Clouds, and the Dame of Lightning to stand with him above Chang’an. Clouds, thunder, and rain succeeded one another exactly two hours later than instructed, and only three feet and forty drops of water fell. The dragon king then dismissed his subordinates, returned to earth, transformed into the scholar of the previous day, and bashed his way into Yuan Shoucheng’s shop, smashing his sign, writing brushes, and inkstone. When Master Yuan remained seated, perfectly impassive, the dragon king ripped the door off its hinges and threatened him with it: “Bogus prophet! Everything you told me about the rain today was wrong! How dare you sit there so high-and-mighty? Get out before I throw you out!” Master Yuan laughed scornfully. “You don’t scare me. But I’m worried for you. I know who you are: the local dragon king. By altering the times and quantity of rain, you’ve disobeyed the Jade Emperor and broken Heavenly law. Those are capital offenses, you know.” Suddenly trembling, the dragon king dropped the door and kneeled before Master Yuan. “I was only joking! And now I’ve gone and broken Heavenly law. What’s to become of me?","The next day he ordered Viscount Wind, Duke Thunder, the Cloud Youth and Mother Lightning to go to the sky above the city of Chang'an. He waited till late in the morning before spreading the clouds, unleashed the thunder at noon, started the rain in the early afternoon, and stopped it in the late afternoon, when only three feet and 0.4 inches had fallen. He had thus changed the times by two hours and reduced the amount of rain by .08 inches. After the rain he dismissed his generals and his hosts and put away his clouds; then he changed back into a white-clad scholar and charged into Yuan Shoucheng's fortune-telling stall on West Gate Street. Without even asking for an explanation he smashed up Yuan's sign, his brush, his inkstone, and everything else, while the fortune-teller remained calmly in his chair without moving. The dragon king brandished the door in the air, ready to hit him with it, and began to pour abuse on him: “ You evil man, with all your reckless talk about blessings and disasters; you stinking deceiver of the masses. Your predictions are false, and you talk nonsense. You got the time and the amount of today's rain quite wrong, but you still sit there so high and mighty. Get out at once if you want me to spare your life.” Yuan Shoucheng, who was as calm and unfrightened as ever, looked up to the sky with a mocking smile. “I'm not afraid,” he said, “I'm not afraid. I've committed no capital offence, but I fear that you have. You may be able to fool other people, but you can't fool me. I know who you are. You're no scholar; you're the Dragon King of the River Jing. You flouted a decree of the Jade Emperor by changing the time of the rain and cutting down the amount, which is a crime against the laws of Heaven. I'm afraid that you're for the executioner's blade on the Dragon-slicing Scaffold. Are you going to keep up that abuse of me?” On hearing this the dragon king trembled from fear and his hair stood on end. Dropping the door at once he straightened his clothes and made gestures of submission, kneeling to the soothsayer and saying, “Please do not be angry with me, sir; I was only joking. I never thought that it would be taken seriously. Whatever am I to do if I have broken the laws of Heaven? I beg you to save me, sir."
但见那：花尽蝶无情叙，树高蝉有声喧。野蚕成茧火榴妍，沼内新荷出现。那日正行时，忽然天晚，又见山路旁边，有一村舍。,"But see that: the flowers are exhausted and the butterflies are ruthless, and the trees are high and the cicadas are noisy. The wild silkworm turns into a cocoon, and a new lotus appears in the marsh. When I was walking that day, suddenly it was late in the evening, and I saw a cottage next to the mountain road.","They saw Flowers gone, and butterflies cared not to linger; On tall trees the cicada chirp turned brazen. Wild worms made their cocoons, fair pomegranates their fire, As new lilies in the ponds appeared.3 As they were traveling one day, it was growing late again when they saw a hamlet beside the mountain road.",,"the deities assured him. Staff training delivered, Monkey returned to the altar and retrieved his specious self. (The magic was beyond the vision of the mortals on the scene.)","The blossoms were over, the butterflies' passion spent. High in the trees the cicadas screeched. Wild silkworms spun cocoons amid the pomegranate blossom, As lotus flowers opened in the pool. As they were travelling along one evening they saw a cottage beside the road."
却说那李天王与三太子领着众将，直至灵霄殿。启奏道：“臣等奉圣旨出师下界，收伏妖仙孙悟空，不期他神通广大，不能取胜，仍望万岁添兵剿除。”玉帝道：“谅一妖猴，有多少本事，还要添兵？”太子又近前奏道：“望万岁赦臣死罪！那妖猴使一条铁棒，先败了巨灵神，又打伤臣臂膊。洞门外立一竿旗，上书‘齐天大圣’四字，道是封他这官职，即便休兵来投；若不是此官，还要打上灵霄宝殿也。”玉帝闻言，惊讶道：“这妖猴何敢这般狂妄！着众将即刻诛之。”正说间，班部中又闪出太白金星，奏道：“那妖猴只知出言，不知大小。欲加兵与他争斗，想一时不能收伏，反又劳师。不若万岁大舍恩慈，还降招安旨意，就教他做个齐天大圣。只是加他个空衔，有官无禄便了。”玉帝道：“怎么唤做‘有官无禄’？”金星道：“名是齐天大圣，只不与他事管，不与他俸禄，且养在天壤之间，收他的邪心，使不生狂妄，庶乾坤安靖，海宇得清宁也。”玉帝闻言道：“依卿所奏。”即命降了诏书，仍着金星领去。,"But he said that King Li and the third prince led the generals to Lingxiao Hall. Qi Zuo said: ""The ministers and others have been sent to the lower realms by the imperial decree to subdue the demon Sun Wukong. Unexpectedly, he has great supernatural powers and cannot win. I still hope that long live soldiers will be added to eradicate it."" Add troops?"" The prince approached the prelude again and said, ""Long live the pardon for the death penalty! The demon monkey used an iron rod to defeat the giant spirit god first, and then injured the arm of the minister. The word ""Great Sage'"" means that he will be sealed with this official position, even if the troops are suspended; if it is not for this official, he would have to be placed in the Palace of Lingxiao."" The Jade Emperor was surprised when he heard the words: ""How dare this demon monkey be so arrogant. Let the generals immediately execute him."" While speaking, a Taibaijinxing flashed in the squad, and played: ""That monster monkey only knows how to speak, not how big or small. If he wants to increase his troops to fight against him, he thinks that he can't be subdued for a while, but he Master Lao. If you don't want to give up your kindness and kindness, and surrender to An's will, I will teach him to be a great sage of the sky. Just add him an empty title, and it will be easy if you have an official or no salary."" The Jade Emperor said: ""How do you call it 'an official without an official'? ""Lu'?"" Jin Xing said: ""The name is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, he just doesn't care about him, he doesn't have a salary, and he is raised between the heavens and the earth, accepting his evil heart, so that he will not be arrogant, the heaven and the earth will be peaceful, and the sea will be peaceful. Yu is also very peaceful."" The Jade Emperor heard the words and said, ""It is according to Qing."" He ordered the imperial edict to be sent, and he was still led by Jin Xing.","Now we return to the Devarāja Li and the Third Prince, who, leading the other commanders, went straight to the Treasure Hall of Divine Mists to give this report: “By your holy decree your subjects led the expeditionary force down to the Region Below to subdue the baneful immortal, Sun Wukong. We had no idea of his enormous power, and we could not prevail against him. We beseech Your Majesty to give us reinforcements to wipe him out.” “How powerful can we expect one baneful monkey to be,” asked the Jade Emperor, “that reinforcements are needed?” “May Your Majesty pardon us from an offense worthy of death!” said the prince, drawing closer. “That baneful monkey wielded an iron rod; he defeated first the Mighty-Spirit God and then wounded the shoulder of your subject. Outside the door of his cave he set up a banner bearing the words, ‘The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven.’ He said that if he were given such a rank, he would lay down his arms and come to declare his allegiance. If not, he would fight his way up to the Treasure Hall of Divine Mists.” “How dare this baneful monkey be so insolent!” exclaimed the Jade Emperor, astonished by what he had heard. “We must order the generals to have him executed at once!” As he said this, the Gold Star of Venus came forward again from the ranks and said, “The baneful monkey knows how to make a speech, but he has no idea what’s appropriate and what isn’t. Even if reinforcements are sent to fight him, I don’t think he can be subdued right away without taxing our forces. It would be better if Your Majesty were greatly to extend your mercy and proclaim yet another decree of pacification. Let him indeed be made the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven; he will be given an empty title, in short, rank without compensation.” “What do you mean by rank without compensation?” said the Jade Emperor. The Gold Star said, “His name will be Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, but he will not be given any official duty or salary. We shall keep him here in Heaven so that we may put his perverse mind at rest and make him desist from his madness and arrogance. The universe will then be calm and the oceans tranquil again.” Hearing these words, the Jade Emperor said, “We shall follow the counsels of our minister.” He ordered the mandate to be made up and the Gold Star to bear it hence.","Meanwhile Guardian King Li, had returned with his third son to Heaven, and memorialized thus: “We, your ministers, by your command, led forth an army to subdue the monster the Seeker of Secrets, but as we did not know that his magic power was so great, we did not overcome him. We therefore hope Your Majesty will add more heavenly hosts to destroy him.” The Jade Emperor said, “How can one monkey demon have such ability that you need an additional force?” Then the third son said, “I hope Your Majesty will forgive your minister, and not put him to death. That Monkey Demon had an iron spear with which he first put to flight the Great Victorious Commander. Then he wounded me in my arm. At the entrance of his cave he has hoisted a flag on which is written in large letters “The Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven.” He says if you give him this position and title, he will cease fighting; but if not, he will lay siege to Heaven itself.” The Jade Emperor, hearing this, was much astonished and said, “How dare he be so mad as that?” and ordered all the generals to go and destroy him at once. Just as he spoke, the Minister of Venus stepped out of the ranks and said, “That monkey demon knows how to make big demands, but does not know how far he can go. If you send more heavenly legions to fight him, they will not subdue him easily, so it will cause great trouble to the army. Would it not be better that you should pardon him, and send an edict, granting him the title that he asks? But let it be only an empty title, without any emolument.” The Jade Emperor said, “What do you mean by that?” “Let him come and take up his abode in Heaven,” said the minister, “so that his ambition might be satisfied, and he will no longer create any disturbance, and Heaven and Earth may be at peace again.” The Jade Emperor, having heard this, granted the request. He ordered that an edict be written, and that the Minister of Venus should take it to the Monkey King.","Meanwhile, King Li and Prince Nezha were reporting on the war to the Jade Emperor. “We were, in truth, surprised by the abilities of this monkey and beg for more soldiers to destroy him.” “How powerful can one monkey be,” wondered the Jade Emperor, “that reinforcements are required?” “We apologize for our treacherous failure, but this demonic monkey’s iron staff first defeated Mighty-Spirit,” Nezha explained, “then wounded me on the arm.” He next reported Monkey’s demand for a promotion. “Outrageous!” snapped the Jade Emperor. “Have him executed forthwith!” Gold Star now stepped forward. “This baneful monkey knows how to bluster, but not when to stop. I suspect that even if we commit more troops, he won’t be easily defeated, and the campaign will exhaust our armies. Why doesn’t Your Majesty bring him around with another amnesty and give him an honorary title?” “What sort of thing do you have in mind?” the emperor asked. “Let him call himself Great Sage Equal to Heaven—a non-stipendiary post with no duties. That way, we’ll keep him tame and tethered here, and peace will be restored.” “Very well,” agreed the emperor, and dispatched Gold Star with a second amnesty.","Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha led their forces straight to the Palace of Miraculous Mist and made this request: “We, your subjects, took our forces down to the lower world, under your Divine Edict, to subdue the immortal fiend Sun Wukong. But to our surprise we found that his magical powers were too far-reaching for us to be able to defeat him. We therefore hope that Your Imperial Majesty will send more troops to exterminate him.” “How could a mere monkey goblin have such great powers that you actually need more troops?” asked the Jade Emperor. Prince Nezha then came forward and memorialized, “We beg Your Majesty to spare us the deaths we deserve. That monkey fiend has an iron cudgel that he used to defeat the Mighty Miracle God and wounded me on the shoulder. He has set a banner up outside the entrance to his cave that reads 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' and he says that if you give him this office he will stop fighting and submit; otherwise he will attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist.” When the Jade Emperor heard this he asked in horror, “How dare that monkey fiend talk so wildly? Send all the generals to execute him at once.” As he spoke the Great White Planet stepped forward from the ranks of officials. “That monkey fiend knows how to talk,” he suggested, “but he has no idea about real power. If more soldiers were sent to fight him, they might not be able to overcome him at once and their energies would be wasted. But if Your Imperial Majesty were to show your great mercy, you could send down a pacificatory amnesty and let him be a Great Sage Equaling Heaven. It would only be an empty title that he was given, just an honorary appointment.” “What do you mean by an honorary appointment?” asked the Jade Emperor. “He would be called a Great Sage Equaling Heaven, but he would not be given any responsibility or paid any salary. He would be kept between Heaven and Earth, where his evil nature would be under control and he would be kept from wickedness. Thus Heaven and Earth can be at peace, while sea and sky enjoy tranquillity.” The Jade Emperor approved this suggestion and ordered that a new edict should be issued for the Great White Planet to deliver."
次早方刷扮了马匹，包裹了行囊出门。众僧远送方回。行者引路而去，正是那春融时节，但见那：草衬玉骢蹄迹软，柳摇金线露华新。桃杏满林争艳丽，薜萝绕径放精神。沙堤日暖鸳鸯睡，山涧花香蛱蝶驯。这般秋去冬残春过半，不知何年行满得真文。师徒们行了五七日荒路，忽一日天色将晚，远远的望见一村人家。三藏道：“悟空，你看那壁厢有座山庄相近，我们去告宿一宵，明日再行何如？”行者道：“且等老孙去看看吉凶，再作区处。”那师父挽住丝缰，这行者定睛观看，真个是：竹篱密密，茅屋重重。参天野树迎门，曲水溪桥映户。道旁杨柳绿依依，园内花开香馥馥。此时那夕照沉西，处处山林喧鸟雀；晚烟出爨，条条道径转牛羊。又见那食饱鸡豚眠屋角，醉酣邻叟唱歌来。行者看罢道：“师父请行，定是一村好人家，正可借宿。”那长老催动白马，早到街衢之口。又见一个少年，头裹绵布，身穿蓝袄，持伞背包，敛裩扎裤，脚踏着一双三耳草鞋，雄纠纠的出街忙步。行者顺手一把扯住道：“那里去？我问你一个信儿：此间是甚么地方？”那个人只管苦挣，口里嚷道：“我庄上没人，只是我好回信？”行者陪着笑道：“施主莫恼，与人方便，自己方便。你就与我说说地名何害？我也可解得你的烦恼。”那人挣不脱手，气得乱跳道：“蹭蹬！蹭蹬！家长的屈气受不了，又撞着这个光头，受他的清气！”行者道：“你有本事，劈开我的手，你便就去了也罢。”那人左扭右扭，那里扭得动，却似一把铁钤拑住一般，气得他丢了包袱，撇了伞，两只手，雨点似来抓行者。行者把一只手扶着行李，一只手抵住那人，凭他怎么支吾，只是不能抓着。行者愈加不放，急得爆燥如雷。三藏道：“悟空，那里不有人来了？你再问那人就是，只管扯住他怎的？放他去罢。”行者笑道：“师父不知，若是问了别人没趣，须是问他，才有买卖。”那人被行者扯住不过，只得说出道：“此处乃是乌斯藏国界之地，唤做高老庄。一庄人家有大半姓高，故此唤做高老庄。你放了我去罢。”行者又道：“你这样行装，不是个走近路的。你实与我说你要往那里去，端的所干何事，我才放你。”这人无奈，只得以实情告诉道：“我是高太公的家人，名叫高才。我那太公有一个女儿，年方二十岁，更不曾配人，三年前被一个妖精占了。那妖整做了这三年女婿，我太公不悦，说道女儿招了妖精，不是长法，一则败坏家门，二则没个亲家来往，一向要退这妖精。那妖精那里肯退，转把女儿关在他后宅，将有半年，再不放出与家内人相见。我太公与了我几两银子，教我寻访法师，拿那妖怪。我这些时不曾住脚，前前后后，请了有三四个人，都是不济的和尚，脓包的道士，降不得那妖精。刚才骂了我一场，说我不会干事，又与了我五钱银子做盘缠，教我再去请好法师降他。不期撞着你这个纥刺星扯住，误了我走路，故此里外受气，我无奈，才与你叫喊。不想你又有些拿法，我挣不过你，所以说此实情。你放我走罢。”行者道：“你的造化，我有营生，这才是凑四合六的勾当。你也不须远行，莫要化费了银子。我们不是那不济的和尚，脓包的道士，其实有些手段，惯会拿妖。这正是一来照顾郎中，二来又医得眼好，烦你回去上复你那家主，说我们是东土驾下差来的御弟圣僧往西天拜佛求经者，善能降妖缚怪。”高才道：“你莫误了我。我是一肚子气的人，你若哄了我，没甚手段，拿不住那妖精，却不又带累我来受气？”行者道：“管教不误了你。你引我到你家门首去来。”那人也无计奈何，真个提着包袱，拿了伞，转步回身，领他师徒到于门首道：“二位长老，你且在马台上略坐坐，等我进去报主人知道。”行者才放了手，落担牵马，师徒们坐立门旁等候。,"The next morning, Fang pretended to be a horse, packed his luggage and went out. The monks sent Fang back from afar. The walker leads the way, it is the spring season, but see that: the grass lining the jade cong's hoof is soft, and the willow shakes the golden thread to reveal the newness. The peaches and apricots are full of beautiful forests, and the radishes go around the path to release the spirit. The sand dike is warm in the sun, the mandarin ducks sleep, and the mountain stream is fragrant with flowers and butterflies. In this way, halfway through autumn, winter and spring, I don’t know when the line is full of real texts. The masters and apprentices traveled on a barren road for five or seven days, and suddenly it was getting dark one day, and they saw a village from a distance. Sanzang said: ""Wukong, you see that there is a villa close to the wall. Let's stay overnight. How about we do it tomorrow?"" The traveler said: ""Let's wait for the old grandson to see the good and the bad, and then make a decision."" That master Holding the silk reins, the traveler watched intently, what it really was: dense bamboo fences and heavy thatched huts. The towering wild trees greet the door, and the Qushuixi Bridge reflects the households. The willows beside the road are green, and the flowers in the garden are fragrant. At this time, the sunset is sinking to the west, and the mountains and forests are full of birds and birds; I saw the corner of the house where the chickens and pigs were full of food, and the drunken old man came to sing. The traveler looked at it and said, ""Master, please come, it must be a good family in a village, and can sleep in."" The elder urged the white horse to arrive at the mouth of the street early. I saw another young man, his head wrapped in cotton cloth, wearing a blue jacket, carrying an umbrella backpack, tucked up his pants, and a pair of three-eared straw sandals, walking out of the street vigorously. The walker grabbed his hand and said, ""Where are you going? Let me ask you a letter: Where is this place?"" The man just struggled and shouted, ""There is no one in my village, but I can reply to the letter?"" The walker accompanied him. He smiled and said, ""Don't worry about the donor, it is convenient for others, and convenient for yourself. Just tell me what's wrong with the name of the place? I can also solve your troubles."" Scrambling! The parents can't bear the suffocation, and bumping into this bald head again, get his breath!"" The walker said: ""You have the ability, split my hand, and you will go."" The man twisted from side to side. , there was twisting, but it was like an iron jacket clamped, so angry that he lost his baggage, put aside his umbrella, and with both hands, raindrops seemed to catch the traveler. The walker held the luggage with one hand and pressed the other hand against the man, but he couldn't hold it no matter how he faltered. The walker is more and more insistent, and the urgency is explosive. Sanzang said: ""Wukong, there is no one here? If you ask that person again, just hold him and let him go."" The walker smiled and said, ""Master, I don't know, if it's not interesting to ask someone else, you have to ask him. Only then can we buy and sell.” The man was caught by the traveler, so he had to say: “This is the border of Wusi Zang, and it is called Gao Lao Zhuang. Most of the people in the village have the surname Gao, so it is called Gao Lao Zhuang. Just let me go."" The traveler said again: ""You are not a short cut. You told me where you are going and what you are doing, and I will let you go."" The man was helpless. , I can only tell the truth: ""I am Gao Taigong's family, my name is Gao Cai. My Taigong has a daughter who is twenty years old and has never been married. Three years ago, she was occupied by a goblin. After being the son-in-law for the past three years, my grandfather was displeased and said that her daughter recruited a goblin, which is not a long-term law. First, it ruined the family, and secondly, because there was no in-law contact, I always wanted to retire the goblin. The goblin was willing to quit, and the daughter was locked up instead. He will stay in his back house for half a year, and he will not be released to meet his family again. My grandfather gave me a few taels of silver and taught me to search for the master and get the monster. I never stopped at these times. Before and after, I invited three The four of them are all poor monks and pustular Taoist priests. They can't let that goblin go. They scolded me just now, saying that I couldn't do anything, and they entangled with me for five coins, and taught me to ask a good mage to let him down. I accidentally bumped into you, the thorn star, and I missed my walk, so I was angry inside and out. I was helpless, so I shouted with you. I don't want you to have some ideas. I can't earn you, so I tell the truth. You let me go. Let's go."" The walker said: ""Your good fortune, I have a living, this is a four-in-one business. You don't have to travel far, don't waste money. We are not the poor monks, pustules Taoist priests. , In fact, there are some tricks, I'm used to taking demons. This is the first to take care of Langzhong, and the second is to heal the eyes. Please go back to your family owner and say that we are the royal brother and holy monk sent by Dongtu. Those who worship Buddha in the West and seek scriptures are good at slaying demons and monsters."" Gao Cai said, ""Don't get me wrong. I'm an angry person. Are you trying to get me to get angry again?"" The walker said, ""You can't be wrong with your discipline. You lead me to the front of your house."" His master and apprentice arrived at the head of the door and said, ""Two elders, please sit on the horse platform for a while, and wait for me to go in and report to the master."" waiting.","The next morning they saddled the horse and took up the luggage, while the monks accompanied their guests for a great distance before turning back. As Pilgrim led the way forward, it was the happiest time of spring. You see The horse making light tracks on grassy turfs; Gold threads of willow swaying with fresh dew. Peaches and apricots fill the forest gay. Creepers grow with vigor along the way. Pairs of sun-warmed ducks rest on sandy hanks; The brook’s fragrant flowers tame the butterflies. Thus autumn goes, winter fades, and spring’s half gone; When will merit be made and the True Writ found? Master and disciple traveled for some six or seven days in the wilderness. One day, when it was getting late, they saw a village in the distance. “Wukong,” said Tripitaka, “look! There’s a village over there. How about asking for lodging for the night before we travel again tomorrow?” “Let’s wait until I have determined whether it is a good or bad place before we decide,” said Pilgrim. The master pulled in the reins as Pilgrim stared intently at the village. Truly there were Dense rows of bamboo fences; Thick clusters of thatched huts. Skyscraping wild trees faced the doorways; The winding brooklet reflected the houses. Willows by the path unfurled their lovely green; Fragrant were the flowers blooming in the yard. At this time of twilight fast fading, The birds chattered every where in the woods. As kitchen smoke arose, Cattle returned on every lane and path, You saw, too, well-fed pigs and chickens sleeping by the house’s edge, And the old, sotted neighbor coming with a song. After surveying the area, Pilgrim said, “Master, you may proceed. It appears to be a village of good families, where it will be appropriate for us to seek shelter.” The priest urged the white horse on, and they arrived at the beginning of a lane heading into the village, where they saw a young man wearing a cotton head-wrap and a blue jacket. He had an umbrella in his hand and a bundle on his back; his trousers were rolled up, and he had on his feet a pair of straw sandals with three loops. He was striding along the street in a resolute manner when Pilgrim grabbed him, saying, “Where are you going? I have a question for you: what is this place?” Struggling to break free, the man protested, “Isn’t there anyone else here in the village? Why must you pick me for your question?” “Patron,” said Pilgrim genially, “don’t get upset. ‘Helping others is in truth helping yourself.’ What’s so bad about your telling me the name of this place? Perhaps I can help you with your problems.” Unable to break out of Pilgrim’s grip, the man was so infuriated that he jumped about wildly. “Jinxed! I’m jinxed!” he cried. “No end to the grievances I have suffered at the hands of my family elders and I still have to run into this baldheaded fellow and suffer such indignity from him!” “If you have the ability to pry open my hand,” said Pilgrim, “I’ll let you go.” The man twisted left and right without any success: it was as if he had been clamped tight with a pair of iron tongs. He became so enraged that he threw away his bundle and his umbrella; with both hands, he rained blows and scratches on Pilgrim. With one hand steadying his luggage, Pilgrim held off the man with the other, and no matter how hard the man tried, he could not scratch or even touch Pilgrim at all. The more he fought, the firmer was Pilgrim’s grip, so that the man was utterly exasperated. “Wukong,” said Tripitaka, “isn’t someone coming over there? You can ask someone else. Why hang onto him like that? Let the man go.” “Master, you don’t understand,” said Pilgrim, laughing. “If I ask someone else, all the fun will be gone. I have to ask him if, as the saying goes, ‘there’s going to be any business’!” Seeing that it was fruitless to struggle any more, the man said finally, “This place is called the Mr. Gao Village in the territory of the Kingdom of Qoco. Most of the families here in the village are surnamed Gao, and that’s why the village is so called. Now please let me go.” “You are hardly dressed for a stroll in the neighborhood,” said Pilgrim, “so tell me the truth. Where are you going, and what are you doing anyway? Then I’ll let you go.” The man had little alternative but to speak the truth. “I’m a member of the family of old Mr. Gao, and my name is Gao Cai. Old Mr. Gao has a daughter, his youngest, in fact, who is twenty years old and not yet betrothed. Three years ago, however, a monster-spirit seized her and kept her as his wife. Having a monster as his son-in-law bothered old Mr. Gao terribly. He said, ‘My daughter having a monster as her spouse can hardly be a lasting arrangement. First, my family’s reputation is ruined, and second, I don’t even have any in-laws with whom we can be friends.’ All that time he wanted to have this marriage annulled, but the monster absolutely refused; he locked the daughter up instead in the rear building and would not permit her to see her family for nearly half a year. The old man, therefore, gave me several taels of silver and told me to find an exorcist to capture the monster. Since then, I have hardly rested my feet; I managed to turn up three or four persons, all worthless monks and impotent Daoists. None of them could subdue the monster. A short while ago I received a severe scolding for my incompetence, and with only half an ounce more of silver as a travel allowance, I was told to find a capable exorcist this time. I didn’t expect to run into you, my unlucky star, and now my journey is delayed. That’s what I meant by the grievances I had suffered in and out of the family, and that’s why I was protesting just now. I didn’t know you had this trick of holding people, which I couldn’t overcome. Now that I have told you the truth, please let me go.” “It’s really your luck,” said Pilgrim, “coupled with my vocation: they fit like the numbers four and six when you throw the dice! You needn’t travel far, nor need you waste your money. We are not worthless monks or impotent Daoists, for we really do have some abilities; we are most experienced, in fact, in capturing monsters. As the saying goes, ‘You have now not only a caring physician, but now you have cured your eyes as well!’ Please take the trouble of returning to the head of your family and tell him that we are holy monks sent by the Throne in the Land of the East to go worship Buddha in the Western Heaven and acquire scriptures. We are most capable of seizing monsters and binding fiends.” “Don’t mislead me,” said Gao Cai, “for I’ve had it up to here! If you are deceiving me and really don’t have the ability to take the monster, you will only cause me more grievances.” Pilgrim said, “I guarantee that you won’t be harmed in any way. Lead me to the door of your house.” The man could not think of a better alternative; he picked up his bundle and umbrella and turned to lead master and disciple to the door of his house. “You two elders,” he said, “please rest yourselves for a moment against the hitching posts here. I’ll go in to report to my master.” Only then did Pilgrim release him. Putting down the luggage and dismounting from the horse, master and disciple stood and waited outside the door.",,"Unsheathing his Sword of Seven Stars, one of the kings slashed at the face of Monkey, who transformed himself this time into red light and escaped the cave as ether, which he thoroughly enjoyed. Silver Horn pulled on his armor—a wrought-iron suit, cinched at the waist with a dragon’s tendon—strode out of the cave, and hurled himself into combat with Monkey on the edge of the clouds. After a while, Monkey tried to settle the fight by lassoing his opponent with the Golden Rope. But here Monkey was out of his depth. Just as the noose settled around Silver Horn’s head, the demon recited a loose-rope spell. The monster then seized hold of one end and, before Monkey could do his body-thinning magic, lassoed him with a tight-rope spell. In an instant Monkey was comprehensively trussed with an inescapable gold ring enclosing him around his neck. The monster also dealt him seven or eight blows to the head with his sword, to which Monkey was entirely indifferent. “All right, you hardheaded ape,” said the demon, “back to the cave where I’ll beat you some more. But first I want my other two treasures back.” After a careful search, Silver Horn took back the gourd and the vase, then used one end of the rope as a leash to lead Monkey back to the cave. He and Golden Horn tied Monkey to a pillar and went back to their drinking. “Looks like you won’t be nibbling my ears anytime soon!” Pigsy chortled down at Monkey from the beam. But Monkey was already busy with an escape plan. When no one was paying attention, he turned his staff into a steel file, sawed his way out of the neck ring, turned a hair into a specious Monkey still tied to the pillar, and changed himself into a goblin. “Phony Monkey alert!” Pigsy trilled. “Pigsy’s just making a fuss,” the Monkey-goblin explained to the kings, “because Monkey’s refusing to use magic to escape.” “Tricksy devil!” said Silver Horn. “Give him twenty strokes on the snout.” “Gently now,” warned Pigsy as Monkey approached with a stick, “or I’ll rat you out again.” “I’m trying to get us all out of this hole,” hissed Monkey. “Why do you keep on giving me away? Anyway, how come you’re the only one in this caveful of fiends who can still recognize me?” “Your art of seventy-two transformations doesn’t reach as far as your red buttocks. They’re a bit of a giveaway.” Monkey then shuffled over to the kitchen to rub his bottom against the charcoal burned onto the base of a pot while Pigsy giggled some more. Monkey now plotted to take back the treasures. “Monkey has frayed that Golden Rope,” the Monkey-goblin informed the kings. “How about I replace it with something thicker?” “Good idea,” responded the demon, undoing a lion-buckled belt and handing it to the fake goblin. Monkey reattached his phony self to the pillar with the belt, slipped the Golden Rope up his sleeve, and turned another hair into a fake Golden Rope, which he handed back to the demon. Busy guzzling wine, the demon put it away without noticing. Now in possession of one of the treasures, Monkey sprang out of the cave door and changed back to his true form. “Fiends!” he shouted. “Know that Yeknom is here!” “Who?” asked a startled Golden Horn. “Don’t worry,” soothed Silver Horn. “I’ll prepare the calabash so we can bottle up our unexpected visitor if necessary.” Just outside the door, he encountered an ever-so-slightly-shorter replica of Monkey. “I am the brother of Monkey,” said Monkey. “I’m here to reckon with his captors.” Silver Horn yawned. “I suppose you want to fight me now. Well, I’m not playing that game. I’ll call your name instead. Will you answer to it?” “Ten thousand times!” The demon leaped into the air, holding the calabash upside down, and roared: “Yeknom!” Monkey now hesitated, knowing the power of the gourd. “Answer!” cried the fiend. “My ears are a little blocked today. Speak up, would you?” “YEKNOM!” Monkey experienced some inner turmoil: My real name is Monkey; Yeknom is just an alias. If I answer to a false name, will I still be sucked inside? He soon found out. Answering to Yeknom, he was swallowed whole and the calabash was taped up. It turned out that Monkey had been overthinking the matter. The gourd didn’t bother checking your identity: as long as you answered back, it had you. Inside the gourd it was perfectly dark. Unworried about the calabash’s power over him—forty-nine days in Laozi’s brazier had only made him stronger—Monkey concentrated on following what was going on outside. “All good,” he heard Silver Horn tell Golden Horn. “I’ve got Monkey’s brother inside.” “Sit down and take your ease, excellent brother.” Golden Horn said jubilantly. “When we can hear monkey-slime sloshing around inside, we’ll take the seal off.” First, Monkey thought of hoaxing the monsters by urinating inside the gourd to generate a liquid sound effect, but rethought when he considered what a smelly mess it would make of his shirt. I’ll gargle instead, he decided. Bored of waiting for the monsters to remember to shake the gourd, Monkey resorted to some amateur dramatics to accelerate matters: “ Oh, goodness! What’s happened to my shins?” No response from the demons. “My pelvis is pus!” “He must be almost done,” reflected Golden Horn. “Let’s take a look.” Monkey plucked a hair and transformed it into a half monkey stuck to the bottom of the gourd, while changing his real self into a cicada perched near the rim of the calabash. The instant that Silver Horn lifted the seal, Monkey flew out and instantly transformed again into Lounging Dragon, who had met such a sticky end earlier. Panicked by glimpsing the partially dissolved body inside the gourd, the monster didn’t wait to verify that it was Monkey. “He’s not finished, quickly put the stopper back on.” Back went the seal with Monkey sniggering on the outside. Golden Horn poured his brother a full cup of wine. “Let me toast your success in capturing Tripitaka, Pigsy, Sandy, Monkey, and Monkey’s brother Yeknom.” Anxious to take the proffered cup respectfully, with two hands, Silver Horn passed the gourd to Lounging Dragon—the disguised Monkey. While the two brothers politely toasted each other, Monkey had time to tuck the treasure up his sleeve and turn another of his hairs into a replica. The toasts complete, Silver Horn took back the gourd without checking it over, while Monkey slipped out of the room. Returning to his true form outside the cave, Monkey now tried another grand entrance. “Open up, monsters! It’s Nomyek, brother of Monkey and Yeknom!” “How can that Monkey have so many damn brothers?” asked Golden Horn. “Relax,” reassured Silver Horn. “This calabash can bottle up a thousand people. I’ll deal with him straightaway.” And out he strode to receive his visitor. “I won’t fight you,” Silver Horn told Nomyek. “But I will call your name. Will you answer to it?” “Happy to oblige.” Monkey chuckled. “But if I call your name, will you answer to it?” “I want to call your name,” revealed the disingenuous fiend, “so that my calabash here will swallow you up. Why do you want to call my name?”","The next morning the horse was curried and the luggage packed, and then they set out. The monks escorted them a long distance before turning back, after which Monkey led the way. It was now early spring. The grass cushions the horse's hooves, New leaves emerge from the willow's golden threads. Apricot vies for beauty with peach; The wild fig round the path is full of life. On sun-warmed sandbanks sleep mandarin ducks; In the flower-scented gully the butterflies are quiet. After autumn, winter, and half of spring, Who knows when the journey will end as they find the true word? One evening, after they had been travelling along a desolate path for six or seven days, master and disciple saw a distant village. “Monkey,” said Sanzang, “do you see the village not far over there? Let's go and ask them to put us up for the night; we can set off again tomorrow morning.” “Wait till I've made sure it's all right before deciding.” Monkey replied, gazing at the village as his master pulled on the silken rein. He saw Close-planted bamboo fences, Many a thatched roof. Outside the gates soar lofty trees; Houses are mirrored in the waters under a bridge. Green grow the willows beside the road, Fragrant bloom the flowers in the gardens. As sun sets in the West Birds sing in the wooded hills. The smoke of evening rises from the stoves Along the paths roam sheep and cattle. Well-fed chickens and pigs sleep under the eaves, While the drunk old man sings his song next door. When he had surveyed the scene, Brother Monkey said, “Go ahead, master. It's definitely a good village. We can spend the night there.” Sanzang urged his horse forward, and in a few moments they were at the beginning of the main street. A young man appeared wearing a silken turban, a blue jacket, a pair of trousers tied at the ankles, and a pair of straw sandals. He was carrying an umbrella in his hand and a pack on his back. He was a fine sight as he walked briskly down the street. Monkey grabbed him and asked, “Where are you going? I want to ask you something—where is this?” The fellow, who was trying to break loose, shouted, “Why ask me? I'm not the only person in the village.” “Don't be angry, kind sir,” replied Monkey, all smiles. “To help others is to help yourself. What harm can it do to tell me what the place is called? We might be able to bring your troubles to an end, you know.” Struggle as he might, the fellow could not break loose, which made him leap around with fury. “Damn it, damn it,” he shouted, “I get more bullying from the old man than I can stand, and now I've got to run into you, baldy. You've got it in for me too.” “If you're good for anything, get out of my grip,” Monkey said. “Do that and I'll let you go.” The young man twisted and turned, but he could not break free—it was as if he were held in a pair of pliers. In his temper he threw down his umbrella and his bundle, and tore at Monkey with both hands, trying to get hold of him. Monkey was holding the luggage in one hand, and with the other he was keeping the young man under control, and no matter how hard the fellow tried he could not get a grip on him. Monkey, however, was now holding him more firmly than ever, and was bursting with fury. “Monkey,” Sanzang said, “here comes someone else you can ask. Why keep such a tight grip on him? Let him go.” “You don't understand, master,” replied Monkey with a smile. “It would be no fun to ask anyone else. I have to ask him if there's to be anything to be got out of this.” Seeing that Monkey would not let him go, the fellow started to talk. “This is Old Gao Village in the country of Stubet, and it's called that because practically everyone here has the surname Gao. Now let me go.” “From your get-up, you're going on a long journey,” Monkey went on. “Tell me where you're going and what you're up to, then I'll let you go.” The poor fellow had no option but to tell Monkey the truth. “I'm Gao Cai from the family of Squire Gao. His youngest daughter is twenty and not yet married, but three years ago an evil spirit came and took her. He's been staying with us for three years, and the old man isn't at all pleased. There's no future in having a girl marry an evil spirit, he says. It's ruining our family, and we don't get a family of in-laws to visit. He's always wanted to get rid of the evil spirit, but he refuses to go. Now he's shut the girl up in the back building for the best part of a year, and he won't let any of the family see her. My old man gave me two ounces of silver and sent me to find a priest to capture the monster. I've been on the go for ages now, and asked three or four of them, but they were all hopeless monks or pimples of Taoists—none of them could control him. The old man's just been swearing at me as an utter idiot, given me five more ounces of silver as travelling expenses, and told me to find a good priest who'll deal with the monster. Then I was grabbed by you, you evil star, and that's made me later than ever. No wonder I shouted at you : I'm pushed around at home and pushed around when I go out. I never thought you'd be such a good wrestler that I wouldn't be able to break out of your clinch. Let me go now—I've told you everything.” “You're in luck—we're in the business,” Monkey replied. “This is quite convenient; you needn't go any further or spend any of your money. We're not hopeless monks or pimples of Taoists. We've got some real magic powers, and we know how to deal with evil spirits. This'll do both of us a bit of good. Go back and tell the head of your household that my master is a saintly monk, and the younger brother of the Emperor of the East, who has sent him to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and seek the scriptures. We are very good at controlling devils and capturing monsters.” “Don't lie to me,” the young man replied. “I've had enough of being pushed around. If you're tricking me, you haven't really got any special powers, and you can't capture that fiend, you'll only be getting me into more trouble than ever.” “I swear I'm not fooling you,” answered Monkey. “Show us the way to your front door.” The young man saw that there was nothing for it but to pick up his bundle and umbrella, turn round, and take the two of them to his gate, where he said to them, “Reverend gentlemen, would you mind sitting here on the verandah for a moment while I go in and tell the master?” Only then did Monkey let go of him, put down the carrying-pole, take the horse's reins, and stand beside his master, who sat down by the gate."
八戒道：“哥哥怎的定得个远近之数？”行者道：“不瞒贤弟说，老孙这双眼，白日里常看得千里路上的吉凶。却才在空中看出：此河上下不知多远，但只见这径过足有八百里。”长老忧嗟烦恼，兜回马，忽见岸上有一通石碑。三众齐来看时，见上有三个篆字，乃流沙河，腹上有小小的四行真字云：“八百流沙界，三千弱水深。鹅毛飘不起，芦花定底沉。”师徒们正看碑文，只听得那浪涌如山，波翻若岭，河当中滑辣的钻出一个妖精，十分凶丑：一头红焰发蓬松，两只圆睛亮似灯。不黑不青蓝靛脸，如雷如鼓老龙声。身披一领鹅黄氅，腰束双攒露白藤。项下骷髅悬九个，手持宝杖甚峥嵘。那怪一个旋风，奔上岸来，径抢唐僧，慌得行者把师父抱住，急登高岸，回身走脱。那八戒放下担子，掣出铁钯，望妖精便筑，那怪使宝杖架住。他两个在流沙河岸，各逞英雄。这一场好斗：九齿钯，降妖杖，二人相敌河岸上。,"Bajie asked: ""How can my brother decide the number of distances and distances?"" Walker said: ""To tell the truth from my wise brother, Lao Sun's eyes often see good and bad things on a journey of a thousand miles during the day. I don’t know how far up and down, but I can see that this path is about 800 li.” The elder was worried and troubled, and went back to his horse, when he suddenly saw a stone tablet on the shore. When the three congregations came together to look at it, they saw that there were three seal characters, Liusha River, and a small four-line true character on the belly: ""Eight hundred quicksand realms, three thousand weak water depths. The goose feathers can't float, and the reed flowers are sinking. ""The teachers and disciples were looking at the inscription, but they heard the waves surging like mountains and turning like ridges, and a goblin emerged from the river. It was very ugly: a red flame with fluffy hair, and two round eyes that brightened like lamps. The face is neither black nor blue, and the sound of an old dragon is like thunder and drums. He wears a goose-yellow cloak with a collar, and a pair of white vines on his waist. There are nine skeletons hanging under the item, holding a treasured staff. That strange whirlwind rushed to the shore and grabbed the Tang monk, so panicked that the walker hugged the master, hurried to the high shore, turned around and escaped. That Bajie put down the burden, pulled out the iron and palladium, and waited for the goblin to build it, and the monster used the treasured staff to hold it. The two of them were on the banks of the quicksand, each acting as a hero. This fight: Nine-toothed palladium, demon-subduing staff, the two are on the bank of the river against each other.","“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “how could you determine its width just like that?” “To tell you the truth, Worthy Brother,” said Pilgrim, “these eyes of mine can determine good or evil up to a thousand miles away in daylight. Just now when I was up in the air, I could not tell how long the river was, but I could make out its width to be at least eight hundred miles.” Sighing anxiously, the elder pulled back his horse and suddenly discovered on the shore a slab of stone. When the three of them drew closer to have a look, they saw three words written in seal-script (“Flowing-Sand River”) below which there were also four lines written in regular style. It read: These Flowing-Sand metes, eight hundred wide; These Weak Waters, three thousand deep. A goose feather cannot stay afloat; A rush petal will sink to the bottom. As master and disciples were reading the inscription, the waves in the river suddenly rose like tall mountains, and with a loud splash from the midst of the waters a monster sprang out. Looking most savage and hideous, he had A head full of tousled and flame-like hair; A pair of bright, round eyes which shone like lamps; An indigo face, neither black nor green; An old dragon’s voice like thunderclap or drum. He wore a cape of light yellow goose down. Two strands of white reeds tied around his waist. Beneath his chin nine skulls were strung and hung; His hands held an awesome priestly staff. Like a cyclone, the fiend rushed up to the shore and went straight for the Tang Monk. Pilgrim was so taken aback that he grabbed his master and dashed for high ground to make the escape. Putting down the pole, Eight Rules whipped out his rake and brought it down hard on the monster. The fiend used his staff to parry the blow, and so the two of them began to unleash their power on the bank of the Flowing-Sand River. This was some battle! The nine-pronged rake; The fiend-routing staff; These two met in battle on the river shore.",,"The unsuspecting queen called once more for her carriage and, snuggling fragrantly up to Tripitaka, rode out with him to the western outskirts of the city, through streets lined with city dwellers eager to catch a glimpse of the royal couple. When they were ready for the send-off, the three disciples stood before the carriage and chorused: “No need to come any further, Your Majesty. We’ll say our good-byes here.” Tripitaka got out of the carriage. “Your Majesty, please return to your capital and allow me to carry on my journey west.” The queen paled with shock. “What are you talking about? I’ve promised you my kingdom. Your reign is due to start tomorrow. You’ve eaten the wedding feast!” Pigsy lost his temper here. “Let Tripitaka go, you powdered skeleton!” But just as the intimidated queen stumbled back into the carriage and Sandy was helping Tripitaka onto the horse, a girl rushed out of the crowd. “Where do you think you’re going, you beautiful Buddhist? You and I have some love to make!” And before Sandy could beat her off with his staff, and Monkey and Pigsy could perform their immobility spells, she and Tripitaka disappeared into a whirlwind.","“How can you be so sure of the distance, brother?” Pig asked. “These eyes of mine can see what's happening three hundred and fifty miles away in daytime,” Monkey replied. “When I took a look from up in the air just now I couldn't make out the length of the river, but I could see that it was a good three hundred and fifty miles wide.” Depressed and worried, Sanzang reined in his horse and noticed a stone tablet beside the river. The three of them went to look at it, and they saw the words FLOWING SANDS RIVER inscribed on it in the ancient curly style. On the base of the tablet were four lines in the standard script: “Three hundred miles of flowing sands, Three thousand fathoms of weak water, On which a goose feather will not float, And the flower of a reed will sink.” As the three of them were looking at this tablet they heard the waves make a roar like a collapsing mountain as a most hideous evil spirit emerged from the water: A head of matted hair, as red as fire, A pair of staring eyes, gleaming like lamps. An indigo face, neither black nor green, A dragon's voice like drums or thunder. On his body a cloak of yellow goose-down, Tied at the waist with white creeper. Nine skulls hung around his neck, And in his hands was an enormous staff. The monster came to the bank in a whirlwind and rushed straight at the Tang Priest. Monkey picked Sanzang up at once, turned, and made off up the high bank. Pig dropped his carrying-pole, grabbed his rake, and struck at the evil spirit, who parried the blow with his staff. Each of them showed his prowess on the banks of the Flowing Sands River, and it was a fine battle: The nine-pronged rake, And the ogre-quelling staff: Two men fighting on the banks of the river."
第十回,tenth time,"After expressing his gratitude, Wei Zheng set out to play chess with the Tang emperor, both of them moving the pieces step by step into positions.","This they did, but the Monkey burst open all the doors and they all went their way, leaving the youths fast asleep.","That morning, therefore, Wei Zheng had not gone to court, in order to bathe, to sharpen his magic sword for the impending execution, and to practice some calisthenics of the soul.",It was just as the Chess Classic says:
依般若波罗蜜多故，心无挂碍，无挂碍故，无有恐怖。远离颠倒梦想，究竟涅槃，三世诸佛，依般若波罗蜜多故，得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。故知般若波罗蜜多，是大神咒，是大明咒，是无上咒，是无等等咒，能除一切苦，真实不虚。故说般若波罗蜜多咒，即说咒曰：‘揭谛！揭谛！波罗揭谛！波罗僧揭谛！菩提萨婆诃！’”此时唐朝法师本有根源，耳闻一遍《多心经》，即能记忆，至今传世。此乃修真之总经，作佛之会门也。”,"Because of Prajna Paramita, there is no hindrance in the mind, no hindrance, so there is no fear. Away from perverted dreams, and finally Nirvana, all the Buddhas of the three worlds, relying on Prajna Paramita, attained Anuttarasamyaksabodhi. Therefore, we know that Prajna Paramita is the great divine mantra, the great bright mantra, the unsurpassed mantra, and the unparalleled mantra. It can remove all suffering, and it is true and not false. Therefore, when the Prajna-Paramita mantra is said, the mantra is said: 'Reveal the truth! Reveal! Porojati! Pharaoh Reveals the Truth! Bodhisattva Pohe! '"" At this time, the Tang Dynasty masters had their roots. Hearing the ""Multiple Heart Sutra"" once, he could remember it, and it has been handed down to the world. This is the general sutra for self-cultivation, and it is also the door of the Buddha's meeting.""","Because there is nothing to be attained, the mind of the Bodhisattva, by virtue of reliance upon the Perfection of Wisdom, has no hindrances: no hindrances, and therefore, no terror or fear; he is far removed from error and delusion, and finally reaches Nirvāṇa. All the Buddhas of the three worlds28 rely on the Perfection of Wisdom, and that is why they attain the ultimate and complete enlightenment. Know, therefore, that the Perfection of Wisdom is a great divine spell, a spell of great illumination, a spell without superior, and a spell without equal. It can do away with all sufferings—such is the unvarnished truth. Therefore, when the Spell of the Perfection of Wisdom is to be spoken, say this spell: “Gate! Gate! Pāragate! Pārasaṃgate! Bodhisvāhā!”29 Now because that master of the law from the Tang court was spiritually prepared, he could remember the Heart Sūtra after hearing it only once. Through him, it has come down to us this day. It is the comprehensive classic for the cultivation of Perfection, the very gateway to becoming a Buddha.",,"A panicked Old Woman of the Wind and her sidekick twisted their wind bag shut and bowed before Monkey. “Here I am,” snapped Monkey, “doing my best to protect this Tang monk on his way to fetch scriptures, stuck in a rain-making contest with deviant Taoists, and I find you helping them, not me. I’ll let you off this time if you stop the wind immediately. But if I see the merest flutter of that Tiger-Strength’s whiskers, you’ll each get twenty of the best from my iron staff.” “Understood!” replied the old woman, and the wind instantly subsided. “You blew it!” Pigsy jeered at Tiger-Strength. “Our turn.” The Taoist now burned another charm, and banged his tablet a second time.","As nothing is to be gained, a Bodhisattva depending on prajna-paramita becomes free in his mind, and as he is free in his mind he has no fear and is rid of dreamlike thoughts of unreality and enjoys ultimate Nirvana. By mean of prajna-paramita, all Buddhas of the past, the present and the future realize anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Therefore, we know prajna-paramita is a great, divine spell, a great enlightening spell, a supreme spell, and a spell without a parallel, that can do away with all sufferings without fail. Thus we recite the Prajna-paramita Spell and say: Gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate, bodhi, svaha! As the Patriarch from the Tang had already the origins of enlightenment inside himself, he was able to remember the Heart Sutra after only one hearing, and it has been passed on down to this very day. This sutra is the kernel of the cultivation of the truth, and it is the gateway to becoming a Buddha."
盖众多人，都念“南无观世音菩萨”。太宗即传旨：教巧手丹青，描下菩萨真象。旨意一声，选出个图神写圣远见高明的吴道子，此人即后图功臣于凌烟阁者。当时展开妙笔，图写真形。那菩萨祥云渐远，霎时间不见了金光。只见那半空中，滴溜溜落下一张简帖，上有几句颂子，写得明白。颂曰：“礼上大唐君，西方有妙文。程途十万八千里，大乘进殷勤。此经回上国，能超鬼出群。若有肯去者，求正果金身。”太宗见了颂子，即命众僧：,"Many people recite ""Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva"". Taizong passed the decree: teach skillful Danqing, and describe the truth of Bodhisattva. With a decree, Wu Daozi, who had a great vision and a great vision, was selected. At that time, I developed a wonderful pen, drawing pictures and shapes. The auspicious cloud of the Bodhisattva gradually drifted away, and the golden light disappeared in an instant. I saw that in mid-air, a brief post slipped down, with a few odes on it, clearly written. Song said: ""Respectfully, Lord Tang, there is a wonderful text in the West. The journey is 108,000 miles, and the Mahayana is diligent. This sutra can surpass the ghosts and out of the group when returning to the country. ""When Taizong saw Songzi, he ordered the monks:","Everyone was chanting, “Namo Bodhisattva Guanshiyin!”31 Taizong at once gave the order for a skilled painter to sketch the true form of the Bodhisattva. No sooner had he spoken than a certain Wu Daozi was selected, who could portray gods and sages and was a master of the noble perspective and lofty vision. (This man, in fact, was the one who would later paint the portraits of meritorious officials in the Lingyan Tower.) Immediately he opened up his magnificent brush to record the true form. The hallowed clouds of the Bodhisattva gradually drifted away, and in a little while the golden light disappeared. From midair came floating down a slip of paper on which were plainly written several lines in the style of the gāthā: We greet the great Ruler of Tang With scripts most sublime of the West. The way: a hundred and eight thousand miles. This Mahāyāna seek earnestly. These Books, when they reach your fair state, Can redeem damned spirits from Hell. If someone is willing to go, He’ll become a Buddha of gold. When Taizong saw the gāthā, he said to the various monks: “Let’s stop the Mass. Wait until I have sent someone to bring back the scriptures of the Great Vehicle.","When the mind wanders from the body, The form is without life. When the passions are rebellious You must wait till they submit. After three days and three nights, Sha arrived at the Waterfall Cave, where he found the false Sun seated on a rock, reading aloud the imperial edict spread out before him, in which it was written how the emperor had died and had descended into hell, but that the authorities there had allowed him to return to earth again, and he had made a vow to save the souls of the lost. Guanyin had also graciously said that the Sacred Scripture in the West could save the dead spirits from torment. “I have therefore commanded the monk Xuanzang to travel far to the West in search of these wonderful Scriptures so as to have them made known in the East. Let none of the rulers, through whose lands he must pass, hinder him in his holy mission.” This was dated the 13th year of Zhenguan and was stamped by the emperor’s seal in nine places.","“Keep going!” Monkey called to them. After Tripitaka and the others had left the precincts of the mountain entirely, they heard a huge crash—as if the earth were splitting. Then a naked Monkey appeared, kneeling, before them. “Monkey is free!” After kowtowing four times to Tripitaka, he sprang up again. “Thanks for looking after my master,” he hailed Boqin. “And for pulling grass off my face.” He then gathered up Tripitaka’s luggage and strapped it onto the back of the horse, who cowered with fear—given Monkey’s past experience as a Heavenly stable hand, both mortal and immortal horses submitted to him. “Now that you’ve acquired such an, um, distinguished disciple, I’ll take my leave,” Boqin said to Tripitaka.","Taizong ordered that a skilled painter was to make a true likeness of the Bodhisattva, and no sooner had the words left his mouth than the brilliant and enlightened portrayer of gods and Immortals, Wu Daozi, was chosen. He was the man who later did the pictures of distinguished ministers in the Cloud-piercing Pavilion. Wielding his miraculous brush, he painted a true likeness on the spot. The Bodhisattva's magic cloud slowly faded into the distance, and a moment later the golden light could be seen no more. All that was visible was a note drifting down from the sky on which could be read the following brief address in verse: “Greetings to the lord of the Great Tang. In the West are miraculous scriptures. Although the road is sixty thousand miles long, The Great Vehicle will offer its help. When these scriptures are brought back to your country They will save devils and deliver the masses."
此时龙子龙孙与那鱼鲫蟹士正欢笑谈此事未毕，只听得半空中叫：“泾河龙王接旨。”众抬头上看，是一个金衣力士，手擎玉帝敕旨，径投水府而来。慌得龙王整衣端肃，焚香接了旨。,"At this time, the dragon son Longsun and the fish and crucian carp were laughing and talking about the matter, but they heard the call in mid-air: ""Jinghe Dragon King takes the order."" Everyone looked up and saw that it was a golden-clothed warrior, holding the Jade Emperor in his hand. The imperial decree came straight to the water house. The Dragon King was so panicked that he dressed up and burned incense to accept the order.","While the dragon sons and grandsons were laughing at the matter with the fish and crab officials, a voice was heard suddenly in midair announcing, “Dragon King of the Jing River, receive the imperial command.” They raised their heads to look and saw a golden-robed guardian holding the decree of the Jade Emperor and heading straight for the water residence. The Dragon King hastily straightened out his attire and burned incense to receive the decree.","Guanyin asked, “Did you tell him that you were fetching the Sacred Scriptures? He is a disciple of mine, and if you had only told him so, you would have had no trouble. Hui Yan, take this red gourd, and go with Sun, and call for Seeker of Purity, and he will come and ferry you across.” On being called the demon emerged and apologized for the delay, because he did not know the pilgrim himself was there.","The royal dragon family and the fishy ministers were still laughing when a voice rang out above them: “Imperial command incoming, O Dragon King!” A muscular envoy in a golden robe landed, delivered a decree from the Jade Emperor, and took off again.","Just as all the dragon sons and grandsons were laughing and talking about this with the fish ministers and crab soldiers a shout was heard from the sky: “Dragon King of the Jing River, prepare to receive an Imperial Decree.” They all looked up and saw a warrior in golden clothes coming towards the watery palace with a decree from the Jade Emperor in his hands. This alarmed the dragon king, who straightened his clothes, stood up solemnly, burnt incense and received the decree."

Where the wind picked up, the king of the proud country was scattered, and the three streets and six cities were all panicked and closed their doors, and no one dared to leave. Wukong just pressed the cloud head. Walk into the door. Until the weapon hall and the arsenal, open the door, and when you look at it, there are countless instruments inside: knives, spears, swords, halberds, axes, tomahawks, hairs, sickles, whips, palladiums, swords, bows, crossbows, forks, spears, Everything is ready. When I saw it, I was very happy and said: ""How much can I take alone? I can also use a clone method to move it."" Good Monkey King, that is, he plucked a handful of hairs, chewed it in the mouth, sprayed the general, chanted a mantra, and cried: "" Change!"" Changed into thousands of little monkeys, and they all moved and robbed; the strong took five or seven pieces, the weak took three or two pieces, and moved them all. Step on the head of the cloud, find a way to take a picture, call the wind, and lead the little monkey back to the place.","This wind toppled Buddha’s throne of a thousand years And shook to its foundations the Five-Phoenix Tower. The wind arose and separated the king from his subjects in the Aolai Country. Throughout the various boulevards and marketplaces, every family bolted the doors and windows and no one dared go outside. Wukong then lowered the direction of his cloud and rushed straight through the imperial gate. He found his way to the armory, knocked open the doors, and saw that there were countless weapons inside. Scimitars, spears, swords, halberds, battle-axes, scythes, whips, rakes, drumsticks, drums, bows, arrows, forks, and lances—every kind was available. Highly pleased, Wukong said to himself, “How many pieces can I possibly carry by myself? I’d better use the magic of body division to transport them.” Dear Monkey King! He plucked a handful of hairs, chewed them to pieces in his mouth, and spat them out. Reciting the spell, he cried, “Change!” They changed into thousands of little monkeys, who snatched and grabbed the weapons. Those that were stronger took six or seven pieces, the weaker ones two or three pieces, and together they emptied out the armory. Wukong then mounted the cloud and performed the magic of displacement by calling up a great wind, which carried all the little monkeys back to their home.","Then there arose a tremendous cyclone blowing sand and stones, and the people of Aolai were so terrified that they shut their doors, as none dare stay outside. The Seeker of Secrets then descended from the clouds, went to the armory and burst open the doors. Inside were eighteen kinds of weapons, all complete. He rejoiced greatly at the sight. “But I cannot take many alone. I had better call my monkeys by magic.” Then he plucked a hair, chewed it into bits, and blew them out with an incantation, and many thousands of monkeys appeared. They cleared the armory of all the weapons, took them through the air, and returned home with them. Then the Monkey King shook his body, put back the hair and set up the weapons in a heap and called the monkeys together to choose their arms.","Rulers and subjects fled inside their houses and bolted their doors shut. With the coast cleared, Monkey landed his cloud and rushed through the palace gate straight to the armory. There he found vast stores of every kind of weapon: knives, spears, swords, halberds, battle-axes, bows, arrows, and so on. “But how am I to get all this home? Time for some more body division, I think.” Plucking out another handful of hairs, he once more chewed them to a pulp, then spat them out, recited a magic spell, and shouted, “Change!” The fragments of hair turned into one hundred thousand little monkeys, all grabbing at weapons. After emptying the armory, they jumped back onto the cloud and Monkey carried them home on another gale.","The thrones of princes are all blown over; Towers of five phoenixes are shaken to their foundations. Where the storm blew, the prince of Aolai fled in terror, and gates and doors were shut in the streets and markets. Nobody dared to move outside. Sun Wukong landed his cloud and rushed straight through the gates of the palace to the arsenal and the military stores, opened the doors, and saw countless weapons: swords, pikes, sabres, halberds, battleaxes, bills, scimitars, maces, tridents, clubs, bows, crossbows, forks, and spears were all there. At the sight of them he said happily, “How many of these could I carry by myself? I'd better use the magic for dividing up my body.” Splendid Monkey King. He plucked a hair from his body, chewed it up, spat it out, made the magic with his fist, said the words of the spell, and shouted “Change!” It turned into hundreds and thousands of little monkeys, who rushed wildly about grabbing weapons. The strong ones took six or seven each and the weaker ones two or three, and between them they removed the lot. He climbed back up on the clouds, called up a gale by magic, and took all the little monkeys home with him."

The little monster seeks out the mountains to talk about calamity, and the old demon is angry and shows his mighty power. Turning over and playing the Batu Caves, guns and sticks argue right and wrong.","This Monkey King boldly posed as a monk; That swarthy chap wisely concealed the robe. Back and forth went their clever repartee, Adapting to each instant perfectly. He would see the cassock but had no means: This runic treasure’s a mystery indeed!

Liu Quan scolded him a few times because his wife, Li Cuilian, pulled out the golden hairpin at the head of the door, saying that he did not follow the way of women and went out of the boudoir without permission. Li Shi couldn't hold back his anger and hanged himself. Leaving a pair of children who are young, weeping day and night.","From that time on, there was not a single person in the empire who did not practice virtue. Meanwhile, another notice was posted asking for a volunteer to take the melons and other fruits to the Region of Darkness. At the same time, a roomful of gold and silver from the treasury was sent with the Imperial Duke of Khotan, Hu Jingde, to the Kaifeng District of Henan so that the debt to Xiang Liang could be repaid. After the notice had been posted for some days, a worthy came forth to volunteer his life for the mission. He was originally from Zunzhou; his surname was Liu and his given name Quan, and he belonged to a family of great wealth. The reason he came forward was that his wife, Li Cuilian, happened to have given a gold hairpin from her head, by way of alms, to a monk in front of their house. When Liu Quan chided her for her indiscretion in flaunting herself outside their home, Li became so upset that she promptly hanged herself, leaving behind her a pair of young children, who wept piteously day and night.","The demon took a magic leather bag, in which to imprison Zhu Bajie and, transforming himself into the shape of Guanyin, invited Zhu Bajie to enter the cave. The fool went in, and directly he entered, he was seized and placed in the bag. Then the demon appeared in his true form, and said, “Now you see who I am. I am the naked child, and I mean to cook you for my dinner. A fine pig to protect his Master you are!” Then the small demons announced the arrival of Sun. The demon then called his six strong generals, with names such as Mist in the Clouds, Spreading Fire, Fleet as the Wind and so on, who came kneeling for orders.","He turned out to be a humble water-seller who donated all his surplus income to alms-giving or burning paper money—that was how he had built up such an extraordinary fortune in the netherworld. Taizong then advertised for a volunteer to deliver the promised pumpkins to Hell. A few days later, a man called Liu Quan—from a wealthy family of central China—came forward. Not long before, he had scolded his wife for her indiscretion in giving a monk a gold hairpin at their front door, and she had promptly hanged herself in shame and anger, leaving behind a pair of grief-stricken young children.","From then on everyone in the country did good deeds. Another notice was issued calling for a worthy man to take pumpkins to the underworld, and at the same time Yuchi Jingde, the Duke of E, was sent to Kaifeng in Henan to visit Xiang Liang and pay him back a hoard of jewels and a hoard of gold and silver. Some days after the notice had been issued a worthy man called Liu Quan from Junzhou came forward to deliver the pumpkins. He came from a family worth ten thousand strings of cash. When his wife Li Cuilian had taken a gold pin from her hair to give as an offering to a monk at the gate, Liu Quan had cursed her for being a loose wife who would not stay in the women's quarters. Li Cuilian, bitterly resenting this, had hanged herself, leaving a little boy and girl who had been crying night and day ever since."
“乃幽冥背阴山。”太宗悚惧道：“朕如何去得？”判官道：“陛下宽心，有臣等引领。”太宗战战兢兢，相随二人，上得山岩，抬头观看，只见：形多凸凹，势更崎岖。峻如蜀岭，高似庐岩。非阳世之名山，实阴司之险地。荆棘丛丛藏鬼怪，石崖磷磷隐邪魔。,"""It's a ghostly backyin mountain."" Taizong asked in horror, ""How can I get there?"" The judge said: ""Your Majesty is relieved, and there are ministers to guide you."" : The shape is more convex and concave, and the potential is more rugged. As steep as Shuling, as high as Luyan. Not a famous mountain in the Yang world, but a dangerous place in the real Yin Division. Thorn bushes hide ghosts, stone cliffs hide evil spirits.","“How can we go there?” asked Taizong fearfully. “Your Majesty need not worry,” said the judge, “for your subjects are here to guide you.” Shaking and quaking, Taizong followed the two of them and ascended the slope. He raised his head to look around and saw that Its shape was both craggy and curvate, And its form was even more tortuous. Rugged like the Shu peaks;8 Tall like the Lu summits; It was not a famed mountain in the World of Light, But a treacherous place in the Region of Darkness. Thickets of thorns sheltered monsters; Tiers of stone ridges harbored demons.","The attainment of immortality is not by following the many. It is one’s lot to meet both good and evil. All the world has its appointed calamities Throughout countless ages, But there remains a divine light shining through the gloom. The Great Sage and the demons wrangled much about the respective merits of their gourds, which, each assured the other, could imprison men, and make them do their own wish. Finally the Great Sage succeeded in putting one of the great demons in his gourd.","“There is a road into Hell, but no way out,” the judge replied reassuringly. “You can leave only on the Wheel of Transmigration, so that’s where we’re headed. We thought we’d take you on the scenic route, to show you some of the sights of Hell as we go.” After a few miles, they crossed the precipitous Mountain of Shade, crawling with ghosts and goblins, and garlanded with pitch-black demonic exhalations and monster-harboring thickets of thorns.","“However shall we cross it?” Taizong asked in terror. “Have no fears, Your Majesty; your subjects will lead the way,” answered the judge. Taizong followed them shivering and trembling, and when they had climbed the mountain he looked around him. He saw that it was Jagged, Precipitous, High as the Sichuan ranges, Lofty as Lushan. It is not a famous peak of the world of light, But a crag of the underworld. Ogres hidden in the clumps of thorns, Evil monsters lurk behind the cliffs."

A group of monkeys played for a while, but went to take a bath in the mountain stream. Seeing that stream of water rushing, it really looks like a gushing melon. Gu Yun: ""The birds have the language of the birds, and the beasts have the language of the beasts."" All the monkeys said: ""I don't know where this water is. We have nothing to do today. Yay!"" With a shout, they all dragged men and women, called brothers and brothers, and ran together, climbing the mountain along the stream, until the source of the stream was a waterfall and flying spring. But see that:","Swinging from branches to branches, Searching for flowers and fruits; They played two games or three With pebbles and with pellets; They circled sandy pits; They built rare pagodas; They chased the dragonflies; They ran down small lizards; Bowing low to the sky, They worshiped Bodhisattvas; They pulled the creeping vines; They plaited mats with grass; They searched to catch the louse That they bit or sqeezed to death; They dressed their furry coats; They scraped their fingernails; Those leaning leaned; Those rubbing rubbed; Those pushing pushed; Those pressing pressed; Those pulling pulled; Those tugging tugged. Beneath the pine forest and free to play, They washed themselves in the green-water stream. So, after the monkeys had frolicked for a while, they went to bathe in the mountain stream and saw that its currents bounced and splashed like tumbling melons. As the old saying goes, Fowls have their fowl speech, And beasts have their beast language. The monkeys said to each other, “We don’t know where this water comes from. Since we have nothing to do today, let us follow the stream up to its source to have some fun.” With a shriek of joy, they dragged along males and females, calling out to brothers and sisters, and scrambled up the mountain alongside the stream. Reaching its source, they found a great waterfall. What they saw was","In the summer heat he joined a herd of monkeys seeking a cool place in the deep shade of fir trees. After play he would go to the mountain stream to bathe and watch the water rushing down the rocks. Then one day all the monkeys cried out, “Where does the stream come from? Let us follow it to its source. Call the monkeys all together.” All came and shouted out, “Let us go.”","One sweltering morning, he sheltered from the heat with a crowd of monkeys in the shade of some pines; they swung from branch to branch, built sand pagodas, and chased dragonflies and lizards. Afterward, bathing in a mountain stream, they noticed how its current seemed to tumble like rolling melons and wondered where it was coming from. “As we don’t have anything particular to do today,” one of them suggested, “let’s follow the stream to its origin.” With shrieks of happy agreement, they all scrambled up the mountain to a great curtain of a waterfall.","Climbing trees, picking flowers, looking for fruit; Throwing pellets, playing knucklebones; Running round sandy hollows, building stone pagodas; Chasing dragonflies and catching locusts; Worshipping the sky and visiting Bodhisattvas; Tearing off creepers and weaving straw hats; Catching fleas then popping them with their teeth and fingers; Grooming their coats and sharpening their nails; Beating, scratching, pushing, squashing, tearing and tugging; Playing all over the place under the pine trees; Washing themselves beside the green stream. After playing, the monkeys would go and bathe in the stream, a mountain torrent that tumbled along like rolling melons. There is an old saying, “Birds have bird language and, animals have animal talk.” All the monkeys said to each other, “I wonder where that water comes from. We've got nothing else to do today, so wouldn't it be fun to go upstream and find its source?” With a shout they all ran off, leading their children and calling to their brothers.

早又是竹敲残月落，鸡唱晓云生。那众僧起来，收拾茶水早斋。玄奘遂穿了袈裟，上正殿，佛前礼拜，道：“弟子陈玄奘，前往西天取经，但肉眼愚迷，不识活佛真形。今愿立誓：路中逢庙烧香，遇佛拜佛，遇塔扫塔。但愿我佛慈悲，早现丈六金身，赐真经，留传东土。”祝罢，回方丈进斋。斋毕，那二从者整顿了鞍马，促趱行程。三藏出了山门，辞别众僧。众僧不忍分别，直送有十里之遥，噙泪而返，三藏遂直西前进。正是那季秋天气，但见：数村木落芦花碎，几树枫杨红叶坠。路途烟雨故人稀，黄菊丽，山骨细，水寒荷破人憔悴。白蘋红蓼霜天雪，落霞孤鹜长空坠。依稀黯淡野云飞，玄鸟去，宾鸿至，嘹嘹呖呖声宵碎。,"Early on, the bamboo knocked the waning moon again, and the chicken sang Xiao Yunsheng. The monks got up and packed their tea and breakfast. Xuanzang then put on his cassocks, went up to the main hall, and worshiped in front of the Buddha, saying: ""Disciple Chen Xuanzang, went to the west to collect scriptures, but he was blinded by naked eyes and did not know the true form of living Buddhas. Now I would like to make an oath: I will burn incense in temples on the road, and I will worship Buddhas when I meet Buddhas. Pagoda sweeps the pagoda. I hope that my Buddha will be merciful, and will soon appear in the golden body of Zhangliu, give the scriptures, and pass it on to the East."" After congratulations, he returned to the abbot and entered the fasting. After the fasting, the two servants rectified the pommel horse and accelerated the journey. Sanzang left the mountain gate and bid farewell to the monks. The monks couldn't bear to part, so they sent them ten miles away, and they returned in tears, and Sanzang went straight to the west. It was autumn in that season, but see: a few village trees fell with broken reeds, a few trees fell with maple and poplar red leaves. On the road, there are few old friends, Huang Juli, thin mountain bones, cold water and lotus, and haggard. The white apple and the red polygonum are frosty and snowy in the sky, and the solitary dragon in the sunset falls into the sky. Vaguely bleak, wild clouds fly, mysterious birds go, Binhong arrives, and the night is broken.","Soon The bamboos struck down the setting moon3 And the cocks crowed to gather the clouds of dawn. The various monks arose and prepared some tea and the morning meal. Xuanzang put on his cassock and went to worship Buddha in the main hall. “Your disciple, Chen Xuanzang,” he said, “is on his way to seek scriptures in the Western Heaven. But my fleshly eyes are dim and unperceptive and do not recognize the true form of the living Buddha. Now I wish to make a vow: that throughout this journey I shall burn incense whenever I come upon a temple, I shall worship Buddha whenever I meet a Buddha, and I shall sweep a pagoda whenever I reach a pagoda. May our Buddha be merciful and soon reveal to me his Diamond Body sixteen feet tall. May he grant me the true scriptures so that they may be preserved in the Land of the East.” He finished his prayer and went back to the hall for the vegetarian meal, after which his two attendants made ready the saddle and urged him to begin his journey. Going out of the temple’s gate, Tripitaka took leave of the monks, who grieved to see him go. They accompanied him for ten miles before turning back, tears in their eyes, as Tripitaka proceeded directly toward the West. It was the time of late autumn. You see Trees growing bare in hamlets as rush petals break; From every maple column the red leaves fall. Trekkers through paths of mist and rain are few. The fair chrysanthemums, The sharp mountain rocks, Cold streams and cracked lilies all make one sad. Snow falls from a frosty sky on rushes and reeds. One duck at dusk descends in the distant void. Clouds o’er the wilds move through the gathering gloom. The swallows depart; The wild geese appear— Their cries, though loud, are halting and forlorn.4","2. The second is a bare tailed horse monkey, that knows light and darkness and human affairs, is skilful in going in and out, and can avoid death and prolong life. 3. The third is the sliding long armed monkey, that holds the sun and moon in his hands, can compress a thousand mountains, knows what is lucky and unlucky, and plays with heaven and earth, as if they were mere balls. 4. The fourth is the six-eared monkey, that hears at great distances, understands the principles of things, knows the past and future, and all things are perfectly clear to him. Lord Buddha said, “It is this six-eared monkey who is the false one.” At this the false monkey was greatly alarmed, transformed himself into a bee, and tried to fly away, but Buddha put a pot over it, which prevented its escape. The true Sun could not contain himself any longer, and struck it dead with his club, and so ended this species of monkey, and none have appeared since. Meanwhile Zhu Bajie had gone to the Mountain Cave and found the false Master and the false disciples. He killed them and discovered they were only monkeys transformed. He then brought back the felt bag and stolen documents. Thus once more the four true pilgrims started on their westward journey. Discord on the way disturbs all things. Demons take advantage and unite in mischief.","Tripitaka asked him. “You just look after our things,” Monkey said soothingly, “while I go and have an exchange of views with them.” “But there are six of them to one of you. And you’re an undersized monkey. How will you manage?” Monkey sauntered up to them with his arms folded. “Why, may I ask, are you blocking our way?” “We are the kings of this highway,” they replied, “famed for our feats of wealth redistribution—to ourselves—though you seem inexplicably ignorant of our reputation. We are: Eyes-That-See-and-Delight, Ears- That-Hear-and-Rage, Nose- That-Smells-and-Loves, Tongue-That -Tastes-and-Desires, Mind-That-Sees-and-Lusts, and Body-That","Before long the bamboo clappers were sounding for the setting moon, while the cocks greeted the dawn with their crowing. The monks all got up and prepared tea and breakfast. Sanzang put on his cassock and went to worship the Buddha in the main hall. “Your disciple Chen Sanzang,” he said, “is going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures, but my fleshly eye is too dim to see the true image of the living Buddha. I now vow that whenever I come across a temple on my journey I shall burn incense; whenever I see a Buddha's image I shall worship it; and whenever I pass a stupa I shall sweep it. My only wish is that Buddha in his mercy will soon appear to me in his golden body and give me the true scriptures to take back and propagate in the land of the East.” When he had prayed he went back to the abbot's room for breakfast. After breakfast his two attendants saddled the horse and set off at a good pace. At the gate of the monastery Sanzang took his leave of the monks, who were so unwilling to be parted from him that they accompanied him for some three miles before turning back with tears in their eyes, while Sanzang carried on Westwards. It was autumn weather: Leafless the village trees, and fallen the reed flowers; The red leaves had dropped from maple and willow. The way was foggy and damp, and few were the friends that he met. Beautiful the yellow chrysanthemums, Delicate the mountain spurs; Sad to see the lotus withered now the water was cold. White duckweed and red smartweed were turned to snow by the frost. Solitary ducks coming down from the clouds, dropping from the sky, Where pale and wispy clouds were scudding. The swallows had departed, The migrant geese were here, And their honking shattered the night."
一日，暮春天气，众人同在松阴之下，讲经参禅，谈说奥妙。那酒肉和尚恰被玄奘难倒，和尚大怒骂道：“你这业畜，姓名也不知，父母也不识，还在此捣甚么鬼！”玄奘被他骂出这般言语，入寺跪告师父，眼泪双流道：“人生于天地之间，禀阴阳而资五行，尽由父生母养，岂有为人在世而无父母者乎？”再三哀告，求问父母姓名。长老道：“你真个要寻父母，可随我到方丈里来。”玄奘就跟到方丈，长老到重梁之上，取下一个小匣儿，打开来取出血书一纸，汗衫一件，付与玄奘。玄奘将血书拆开读之，才备细晓得父母姓名，并冤仇事迹。玄奘读罢，不觉哭倒在地道：“父母之仇，不能报复，何以为人？十八年来，不识生身父母，至今日方知有母亲。此身若非师父捞救抚养，安有今日？容弟子去寻见母亲，然后头顶香盆，重建殿宇，报答师父之深恩也！”师父道：“你要去寻母，可带这血书与汗衫前去，只做化缘，径往江州私衙，才得你母亲相见。”,"One day, in the twilight of spring, everyone was under the shade of pine, teaching scriptures and meditation, and talking about the mysteries. The monk with wine and meat was just stumped by Xuanzang, and the monk scolded angrily: ""You are a business animal, you don't know your name, your parents don't know, what the hell are you still doing here!"" The temple knelt down and told the master, with tears streaming down: ""Life is between heaven and earth, with yin and yang and the five elements, all raised by parents, how can there be a person who is alive but has no parents?"" The elder said: ""If you really want to find your parents, you can come with me to the abbot."" Xuanzang followed the abbot, and the elder went to the top of the beam, took down a small box, opened it, and took out a piece of blood and a piece of undershirt. Pieces, paid to Xuanzang. Xuanzang disassembled the blood book and read it, so that he could know the names of his parents and the deeds of grievances. After reading it, Xuanzang burst into tears and said, ""My parents have an enmity, I can't take revenge, how can I be a human being? For eighteen years, I didn't know my biological parents, and now I know that I have a mother. Today? Let the disciple go to find his mother, then put the incense bowl on his head, rebuild the temple, and repay the deep kindness of the master!"" The master said: ""If you are going to find your mother, you can take this blood book and undershirt with you, only for almsgiving, Going to the private yamen in Jiangzhou, you have to meet your mother.""","One day in late spring, the various monks gathered in the shade of pine trees were discussing the canons of Chan and debating the fine points of the mysteries. One feckless monk, who happened to have been completely outwitted by Xuanzang’s questions, shouted angrily, “You damnable beast! You don’t even know your own name, and you are ignorant of your own parents! Why are you still hanging around here playing tricks on people?” When Xuanzang heard such language of rebuke, he went into the temple and knelt before the master, saying with tears flowing from his eyes, “Though a human being born into this world receives his natural endowments from the forces of yin and yang and from the Five Phases, he is always nurtured by his parents. How can there be a person in this world who has no father or mother?” Repeatedly and piteously he begged for the names of his parents. The abbot said, “If you truly wish to seek your parents, you may follow me to my cell.” Xuanzang duly followed him to his cell, where, from the top of a heavy crossbeam, the abbot took down a small box. Opening the box, he took out a letter written in blood and an inner garment and gave them to Xuanzang. Only after he had unfolded the letter and read it did Xuanzang learn the names of his parents and understand in detail the wrongs that had been done them. When Xuanzang finished reading, he fell weeping to the floor, saying, “How can anyone be worthy to bear the name of man if he cannot avenge the wrongs done to his parents? For eighteen years, I have been ignorant of my true parents, and only this day have I learned that I have a mother! And yet, would I have even reached this day if my master had not saved me and cared for me? Permit your disciple to go seek my mother. Thereafter, I will rebuild this temple with an incense bowl on my head, and repay the profound kindness of my teacher.” “If you desire to seek your mother,” said the master, “you may take this letter in blood and the inner garment with you. Go as a mendicant monk to the private quarters at the governor’s mansion of Jiangzhou. You will then be able to meet your mother.”","Guanyin and her disciple Mucha appeared in the streets in very poor garments, carrying with them a beautifully embroidered cassock and a nine ringed pastoral staff, which they offered for sale. For the one they asked 5,000 taels and for the other 2,000 taels. But the price was too high for anyone to pay. The Prime Minister, returning from the temple, heard of the articles and asked, “What good is there in buying them?” “He that possesses them will neither be reborn, nor fall into hell, nor be poisoned, nor be killed by wild beasts!” was the reply. On hearing this, the Prime Minister dismounted from his horse, and thought these two magic things most suitable for Xuanzang. The emperor wished to buy them, but Guanyin refused all offers of money, wanting to present them as a gift to the right person. So, wearing poor garments, Guanyin joined the throng, and listened for a time to Xuanzang’s discourse on the Sacred Scriptures. Then Guanyin called out to him in a loud voice, and said, “You have only explained to us Primitive Buddhism. Now explain to us Higher Buddhism. Early Buddhism cannot save the dead, but Higher Buddhism can take them to Heaven, can save men from trouble, can make them long lived without being reborn again in this world.” The emperor then asked for some one to volunteer to go to fetch the Sacred Scriptures of Higher Buddhism from the West.","One fine spring day, as the temple’s monks debated the finer points of Zen under the shade of some pine trees, a good-for-nothing who was wrong-footed by the subtlety of Xuanzang ’s questions lashed out at him: “You bastard! You don’t even know who your mother and father are!” His eyes smarting with tears, Xuanzang kneeled before the abbot and begged him to reveal the names of his parents. Faming brought Xuanzang to his room, where the abbot took down from a beam a small box containing the letter and undergarment from eighteen years earlier, then passed both to the young man. As soon as Xuanzang had read the letter, he kneeled, weeping, before the abbot. “Even as I owe my very survival to you, my teacher, I must avenge the wrongs suffered by my parents. Permit me to seek out my mother, and I will beg for funds to rebuild our temple to repay your kindness.” “Take the letter and the cloth,” instructed the abbot, “and visit the residence of the governor of Jiangzhou as a mendicant—you’ll find your mother there.”","One day in late spring the whole community gathered under the shade of some pine trees to expound the scriptures, meditate and discuss the inner mysteries. A bibulous, meat-eating monk who had been confounded in a disputation by Xuanzang lost his temper and started to abuse him: “You animal, you don't know your own surname or who your parents were. Don't try any of your clever tricks here.” Stung by this abuse, Xuanzang went into the temple and knelt before his teacher with tears streaming from his eyes. “All men who are born between Heaven and Earth, and who are endowed with the Positive, the Negative, and the Five Elements—all are begotten by a father and reared by a mother,” he said. “How can there be any man alive who never had father and mother?” He begged over and over again to know his parents' names. “If you really wish to find out about your father and mother, come with me into my cell,” said the abbot, and they went there together. The abbot lifted down a little box from on top of a massive beam, opened it, took out a letter written in blood and a shift, and gave them to Xuanzang, who unfolded the letter and read it. At last he learned about his parents and the wrongs they had suffered. When he had read it he collapsed, weeping and crying out, “How can I be a man if I don't avenge my father and mother? For seventeen years I haven't known my own parents, but now I know that I have a mother. I would not be alive today, teacher, had you not rescued me and brought me up. Please allow me to go and see my mother, then I will put an incense-burner on my head and rebuild the temple to repay the great kindness you have shown me.” “If you want to go and look for your mother you had better take the letter written in blood and the shift with you. If you go to the private residence of the prefect of Jiangzhou you will be able to see your mother.”"

The golden hoop is a treasure in the sea, and it can be won by rapid changes;","Two sharp weapons sought a chance to hurt, But thrusts and parries did not slack one whit.

又来拜了三藏，拜了行者与八戒，分了大小。三藏见他行礼，真象个和尚家风，故又叫他做沙和尚。木叉道：“既秉了迦持，不必叙烦，早与作法船去来。”那悟净不敢怠慢，即将颈项下挂的骷髅取下，用索子结作九宫，把菩萨葫芦安在当中，请师父下岸。那长老遂登法船，坐于上面，果然稳似轻舟。左有八戒扶持，右有悟净捧托，孙行者在后面牵了龙马半云半雾相跟，头直上又有木叉拥护，那师父才飘然稳渡流沙河界，浪静风平过弱河。真个也如飞似箭，不多时，身登彼岸，得脱洪波，又不拖泥带水，幸喜脚干手燥，清净无为，师徒们脚踏实地。那木叉按祥云，收了葫芦，又只见那骷髅一时解化作九股阴风，寂然不见。三藏拜谢了木叉，顶礼了菩萨。正是木叉径回东洋海，三藏上马却投西。毕竟不知几时才得正果求经，且听下回分解。,"He came to worship Sanzang again, worshipped Xingzhe and Bajie, and divided the size. When Sanzang saw him salute, he really looked like a monk, so he called him monk Sha. Mu Cha said: ""Since you have the Kachi, you don't need to worry about it, and you will come to the boat as soon as possible."" Na Wujing didn't dare to neglect, he took off the skeleton hanging from his neck, made a nine palace with ropes, and placed the Bodhisattva gourd in safety. In the middle, ask Master to disembark. The elder then boarded the Dharma boat and sat on it, as steady as a light boat. With Bajie's support on the left, Wujing's support on the right, Sun Xingzhe led the dragon and horse half-cloud and half-fog to follow, and the wooden fork on the head supported, the master was able to cross the Liusha River boundary smoothly, the waves were calm and the wind calmed down. Weak river. The real one is like flying like an arrow. In a short time, he will be on the other side, and he will get rid of the flood without being muddy. Fortunately, his feet are dry, his hands are pure, and his teachers and students are down-to-earth. The wooden fork pressed the auspicious cloud and took the gourd, only to see the skeleton dissolving into nine gloomy winds for a while, and disappeared silently. Sanzang thanked the wooden fork and bowed to the Bodhisattva. It was Mu Cha that returned to the East Ocean, and Sanzang mounted his horse but cast west. After all, I don't know how long it will take to get the truth, and let's listen to the next decomposition.","The Great Sage indeed took the razor and shaved Wujing’s head, after which he came again to pay homage to Tripitaka, Pilgrim, and Eight Rules, thus becoming the youngest disciple of the Tang Monk. When Tripitaka saw that he comported himself very much like a monk, he gave him the nickname of Sha Monk. “Since you have embraced the faith,” said Mokṣa, “there’s no need for further delay. You must build the dharma vessel at once.” Not daring to delay, Wujing took off the skulls around his neck and strung them up with a rope after the design of the Nine Palaces, placing the gourd in the middle. He then asked his master to leave the shore, and our elder thus embarked on the dharma vessel. As he sat in the center, he found it to be as sturdy as a little boat. He was, moreover, supported by Eight Rules on his left and Wujing on his right, while Pilgrim Sun, leading the dragon-horse, followed in the rear, treading half on cloud and half on fog. Above their heads Mokṣa also took up his post to give them added protection. In this way our master of the Law was safely ferried across the boundary of the Flowing-Sand River: with the wind calm and waves quiet he crossed the weak water. It was truly as fast as flying or riding an arrow, for in a little while he reached the other shore, having been delivered from the mighty waves. He did not drag up mud or water, and happily both his hands and feet remained dry. In sum, he was pure and clean without engaging in any activity. When master and disciples reached solid ground again, Mokṣa descended from the auspicious clouds. As he took back his gourd, the nine skulls changed into nine curls of dark wind and vanished. Tripitaka bowed to thank Mokṣa and also gave thanks to the Bodhisattva. So it was that Mokṣa went straight back to the South Sea, while Tripitaka mounted his horse to go to the West. We do not know how long it took them to achieve the right fruit of scripture acquisition; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.",,"And stop bowing in that stupid way.” “Your husband and I have been sworn brothers these past five hundred years. I understand that you are his wife. That means I’m your brother-in-law.” “If we’re family, then why did you persecute my son?” Monkey opted to feign ignorance. “And your son would be . . . ?” “Red Boy of Fire-Cloud Cave by Desiccated Pine Stream on Roaring Mountain. Name ring a bell? Just when I was wondering how to destroy you, here you come knocking at my door. Prepare to die!” Monkey tried to smile his way out of it. “Surely some mistake.","The Great Sage obediently shaved the monster's head, who then bowed to Sanzang, Monkey, and Pig with appropriate degrees of reverence. When Sanzang saw him do this just like a real monk he gave him another name—Friar Sand. “Now that you have entered the faith,” said Moksa, “there's no need to waste time talking. Make that dharma boat at once.” Friar Sand took the skulls from round his neck without delay and tied them into the pattern of the Nine Palaces with the Bodhisattva's gourd in the middle. Then he asked Sanzang to board it, and Sanzang found when he sat on it that it was as stable as a small dinghy. Pig and Friar San supported him to left and right, while Monkey led the dragon horse through the clouds behind him, and Moksa stood above him on guard. Sanzang thus made a calm and windless crossing of the weak water of the Flowing Sands River. He moved with the speed of an arrow, and it was not long before he climbed ashore on the other side. He was neither wet nor muddy, and his hands and feet were completely dry. Thus it was that master and disciples trod on dry land again without any trouble. Moksa then landed his cloud, and took back the gourd. The nine skulls changed into nine gusts of wind and disappeared. Sanzang bowed to Moksa to thank him and worshipped the Bodhisattva, after which Moksa returned to the Eastern Ocean, While Sanzang remounted and headed West. If you don't know when they won their reward and fetched the scriptures, listen to the explanation in the next chapter."
“正来进拜，不期路遇华翰，见有佛衣雅会，故此急急奔来，愿求见见。”那怪笑道：“老友差矣。这袈裟本是唐僧的，他在你处住札，你岂不曾看见，反来就我看看？”行者道：“贫僧借来，因夜晚还不曾展看，不期被大王取来，又被火烧了荒山，失落了家私。那唐僧的徒弟，又有些骁勇，乱忙中，四下里都寻觅不见。原来是大王的洪福收来，故特来一见。”,"""I was coming in to worship, and I met Hua Han on the road unexpectedly. I saw there was an elegant gathering of Buddhist clothes, so I rushed over and hoped to see you."" That strange smile said: ""It's a bad old friend.

The traveler said, ""The poor monk borrowed it, because he hadn't seen it at night, it was unexpectedly taken by the king, and the barren hill was burned by fire, and it was lost. Furniture. That Tang Seng's apprentice is a little brave, and in the hustle and bustle, he can't find it anywhere. It turns out that it was collected by the king's Hongfu, so I came here to see it.""","“I was just coming to pay my respects,” said Pilgrim, “and I did not anticipate meeting your kind messenger. When I saw that there was going to be a Festival of the Buddha Robe, I came hurriedly, hoping to see the garment.” “My old friend may be mistaken,” said the monster, laughing. “This cassock originally belonged to the Tang Monk, who was staying at your place. Why would you want to look at it here, since you must surely have seen it before?” “Your poor monk,” answered Pilgrim, “did borrow it, but he did not have the opportunity last night to examine it before it was taken by the Great King. Moreover, our monastery, including all our belongings, was destroyed by fire, and the disciple of that Tang Monk was rather bellicose about the matter. In all that confusion, I couldn’t find the cassock anywhere, not knowing that the Great King in his good fortune found it. That is why I came specially to see it.”",,"“Great king! Long snout, huge ears— it’s Pigsy for sure!” Pigsy immediately tried to bury his snout in his chest. “Lift your chin up so we can get a good look at you,” ordered Silver Horn. “Can’t,” mumbled Pigsy. “Birth defect.” But when Silver Horn told his army of fiends to pull it up with hooks, Pigsy immediately obliged.","“I was on my way here to visit you when I happened to see your message that you were giving a 'Buddha's Robe Banquet,' so I hurried over to ask you to let me have a look.” “You've misunderstood, old friend,” replied the evil monster with a smile. “It's the Tang Priest's cassock, and as he's been staying at your place you must have seen it there. Why come here to see it?” “When I borrowed it,” Monkey said, “it was too late at night for me to be able to look at it. Since then, to my great surprise, it has been taken by Your Majesty. On top of that, the monastery has been burnt down and I have lost everything I own. That disciple of the Tang Priest's is quite a bold fellow, but he could not find it anywhere. I have come here to look at it as Your Majesty has had the great good fortune to recover it.”"
第十一回,eleventh time,"They set out again on a broad and level path, leaving quickly with light, airy steps.","But the inward true Ideal is free from the dust of earth,","“When he returns to the world of the living, he’ll hold a grand mass to enable your souls to be reborn.","The judge then told the marshal to wave his soul-leading flag, and Taizong was taken out of the City of the Unjustly Slain and floated along the highway to the daylight."
少顷间，只听得呀的一声，洞门开处，里面走出一个仙童，真个丰姿英伟，像貌清奇，比寻常俗子不同。但见他：,"After a while, I heard a squeak. The door opened, and a fairy boy walked out. He was really handsome and handsome, with a strange appearance, which was different from ordinary people. But see him:","After a moment he heard the door of the cave open with a squeak, and an immortal youth walked out. His bearing was exceedingly graceful; his features were highly refined. This was certainly no ordinary young mortal, for he had","Shortly after he heard the noise of a door opening. It was the door of the cave. Out of it came an Immortal Student who cried out, “Who is making a noise here?”","After a very short while, the door creaked open and a young immortal of exceptionally refined looks emerged. He wore a robe with loose, billowing sleeves; his hair was bound with silk cords.","Before long the doors of the cave opened with a creak, and an immortal boy came out. In the nobility of his bearing and the exceptional purity of his features he was completely different from an ordinary boy. His hair was bound with a pair of silken bands,"
那大圣趁着机会，滚下山崖，伏在那里又变，变一座土地庙儿；大张着口，似个庙门；牙齿变做门扇，舌头变做菩萨，眼睛变做窗棂。只有尾巴不好收拾，竖在后面，变做一根旗竿。真君赶到崖下，不见打倒的鸨鸟，只有一间小庙，急睁凤眼，仔细看之，见旗竿立在后面，笑道：“是这猢狲了！他今又在那里哄我。我也曾见庙宇，更不曾见一个旗竿竖在后面的。断是这畜生弄谊！他若哄我进去，他便一口咬住。我怎肯进去？等我掣拳先捣窗棂，后踢门扇！”大圣听得，心惊道：“好狠！好狠！门扇是我牙齿，窗棂是我眼睛；若打了牙，捣了眼，却怎么是好？”扑的一个虎跳，又冒在空中不见。,"The great sage took the opportunity to roll down the cliff, lie down there, and change into a land temple; his mouth is wide open, like a temple gate; his teeth become doors, his tongue become a bodhisattva, and his eyes become window lattices. Only the tail is not easy to clean up, and it stands upright at the back and turns into a flagpole. The real monarch rushed to the foot of the cliff, but there was no bustard that had been knocked down, only a small temple. He opened his phoenix eyes and looked at it carefully. When he saw the flagpole standing behind, he smiled and said, ""It's this hozen! He is there to coax me again today. I have also seen temples, and I have never seen a flagpole standing in the back. It must be this beast! If he coaxes me in, he will bite. How can I go in? Kick the door!"" The great sage heard this, and said in shock: ""How cruel! How cruel! The door leaf is my teeth, and the window lattice is my eyes; , and disappeared in the air again.","The Great Sage took advantage of this opportunity, nonetheless. Rolling down the mountain slope, he squatted there to change again—this time into a little temple for the local spirit. His wide-open mouth became the entrance, his teeth the doors, his tongue the Bodhisattva, and his eyes the windows. Only his tail he found to be troublesome , so he stuck it up in the back and changed it into a flagpole. The Immortal Master chased him down the slope, but instead of the bustard he had hit he found only a little temple. He opened his phoenix eye quickly and looked at it carefully. Seeing the flagpole behind it, he laughed and said, “It’s the ape! Now he’s trying to deceive me again! I have seen plenty of temples before but never one with a flagpole behind it. This must be another of that animal’s tricks. Why should I let him lure me inside where he can bite me once I’ve entered? First I’ll smash the windows with my fist! Then I’ll kick down the doors!” The Great Sage heard this and said in dismay, “How vicious! The doors are my teeth and the windows my eyes. What am I going to do with my eyes smashed and my teeth knocked out?” Leaping up like a tiger, he disappeared again into the air.","The Great Sage took advantage of that and rolled down to the bottom of the hill like a dead thing, and then changed himself into a local temple, transforming the various parts of his body into the parts of the temple. There was a difficulty about the tail, but he finally turned it into a flagstaff. The Divine Kinsman, looking about for the shot cuckoo, saw a tiny shrine with a flagstaff behind, and smiled and thought, “ And so the Monkey has changed into this now. I have seen many temples and shrines, but I have never seen a flag staff put up behind one before! He thinks he can deceive me and get me to enter, and then he will swallow me with one gulp. But I am not going to be tempted into entering it. I will first break through the door and windows with my fists.” The Great Sage, on feeling this pounding said, “What smart eyes he has! If he destroys the door and windows, he will destroy my eyes and teeth and I shall be hopelessly wounded.” So he jumped like a tiger and suddenly disappeared in the air.","After rolling down the mountain a way, Monkey laid low for a while, then transformed into a small temple to the local spirit: his mouth became the entrance, his teeth the doors, his tongue the statue of the Bodhisattva, his eyes the windows. His tail proved a puzzler, though, until he eventually decided to stick it up in the air as a flagpole. The approaching Erlang sized up the shrine with that useful third eye of his. “That monkey’s trying to fool me again. I’ve seen plenty of temples in my time, but never one with a flagpole. If I go in, he’ll gobble me up. I’d better smash the windows and kick the door in.” Anticipating that this would hurt, Monkey sprang into the air and disappeared again.","He opened his mouth wide to look like the entrance to the temple and turned his teeth into the doors; he made his tongue into a statue of a god and his eyes into windows and lattice. He could not tuck his tail away, so he stuck it up behind him as a flagpole. When Erlang came to the foot of the precipice he could not see the bustard he had shot over, and anxiously opening his phoenix eyes he looked carefully around and saw a temple with its flagpole at the back. “It must be that monkey over there,” he observed with a smile. “He's trying to fool me again. I've seen temples before, but never one with the flagpole at the back. I'm sure it is that beast up to his tricks again. If he'd managed to lure me in, he'd have been able to get me with a single bite. Of course I won't go in. I'll smash his windows in with my fist, then I'll kick his door down.” “Vicious, really vicious,” thought the Great Sage with horror when he heard him say this. “Those doors are my teeth, and the windows are my eyes; and if he smashes my teeth and bashes in my eyes, what sort of a state will that leave me in?”"
他打个唿哨，跳在空中，火眼金睛，用手搭凉篷，四下里观看，更不见马的踪迹。按落云头报道：“师父，我们的马断乎是那龙吃了，四下里再看不见。”三藏道：“徒弟呀，那厮能有多大口，却将那匹大马连鞍辔都吃了？想是惊张溜缰，走在那山凹之中。你再仔细看看。”行者道：“你也不知我的本事。我这双眼，白日里常看一千里路的吉凶。象那千里之内，蜻蜓儿展翅，我也看见，何期那匹大马，我就不见！”三藏道：“既是他吃了，我如何前进！可怜啊！这万水千山，怎生走得！”说着话，泪如雨落。行者见他哭将起来，他那里忍得住暴燥，发声喊道：“师父莫要这等脓包形么！你坐着！坐着！等老孙去寻着那厮，教他还我马匹便了。”三藏却才扯住道：“徒弟啊，你那里去寻他？,"With a whistle, he jumped in the air, his eyes were piercing, he built an awning with his hands, and looked around, but there was no sign of the horse. Press Luo Yuntou to report: ""Master, our horse is definitely eaten by the dragon, and we can't see it anywhere."" Sanzang said: ""My apprentice, that fellow has such a big mouth, but he ate that big horse even with its saddle and bridle. I think it was astonishing, slipping the reins and walking in the valley. You can take a closer look."" The traveler said: ""You don't know my ability. My eyes often see good and bad luck in a thousand miles during the day. Within a thousand miles, the dragonfly spreads its wings, and I can see it, too, and I will not see that big horse!"" Sanzang said, ""Since he ate it, how can I move forward! Poor! How can I walk in such a thousand mountains and rivers! ""As he spoke, tears fell like rain. When the traveler saw that he was about to cry, he couldn't hold back his irritability, and shouted: ""Master, don't want such a pustule! You sit! Sit! Wait for the old grandson to find the man and teach him to return my horse. That's it."" Sanzang stopped and said, ""Apprentice, where are you going to find him?","He whistled once and leaped up into the air. Shading his fiery eyes and diamond pupils with his hand, he peered in all four directions, but there was not the slightest trace of the horse. Dropping down from the clouds, he made his report, saying, “Master, our horse must have been eaten by that dragon. It’s nowhere to be seen!” “Disciple,” said Tripitaka, “how big a mouth does that creature have that he can swallow a horse, harness and all? It must have been frightened away instead, probably still running loose somewhere in the valley. Please take another look.” Pilgrim said, “You really have no conception of my ability. This pair of eyes of mine in daylight can discern good and evil within a thousand miles; at that distance, I can even see a dragonfly when it spreads its wings. How can I possibly miss something as big as a horse?” “If it has been eaten,” said Tripitaka, “how am I to proceed? Pity me! How can I walk through those thousand hills and ten thousand waters?” As he spoke, tears began to fall like rain. When Pilgrim saw him crying, he became infuriated and began to shout: “Master, stop behaving like a namby-pamby! Sit here! Just sit here! Let old Monkey find that creature and ask him to give us back our horse. That’ll be the end of the matter.” Clutching at him, Tripitaka said, “Disciple, where do you have to go to find him?","The king asked them their names, and business. At this, the three moved nearer the king to speak, but the guard sternly rebuked them for their rudeness in approaching so near. Sun smiled, and cried out with a loud voice, “Those who insult others insult themselves. Since my Master is to be your son-in-law, how is it that he is standing and not sitting in your presence? I have never heard of such manners before.” At this the king changed his countenance, but submitted to the rebuke. Then the chief disciple spoke: “My name is Sun Wukong, and my ancestors lived in the country of Aolai, in the Flower and Fruit Mountain. My father was Heaven and my mother was Earth; a peach stone split and I was born. I sought for a famous man to be my teacher, and studied the best religion. Then I studied the magic of the immortals, and sought happiness at the Cave of the Blessed. I went to sea and conquered the dragons, went to the mountains and captured the demons, erased my name from among mortals in Hell, and was registered with the immortals.","“All right, all right,” said Monkey. “I know how ticklish you are—one step out of line and you start that head-squeezing spell. Rest a while and I’ll go and forage.” Leaping onto the clouds, Monkey inspected the pilgrims’ surroundings. The area was densely forested but, as he had said, uninhabited. The only glimmer of possibility was a patch of pinkish-red dots on a mountain due south. “There may be some mountain peaches to be had,” Monkey reported back. “I’ll go and pick them.” “Peaches!” enthused Tripitaka. “It’s not often a Buddhist monk gets to eat peaches!” And off Monkey hurtled with the begging bowl. But as the saying goes: a large mountain must have a monster—and this one was no exception. Monkey’s departure aroused the fiend in question. Traveling on dark winds, she spotted—from the edge of the clouds— Tripitaka seated on the ground. “What luck! What luck!” she rejoiced. “My family has been talking for years about a monk from the east traveling west to fetch scriptures. This monk has cultivated himself through ten pure existences. His flesh has powerful life-prolonging properties. And here he is, on my mountain!” But the covetous monster dared not approach while Tripitaka was guarded by the formidable-looking Pigsy and Sandy, who after all had once worked for the Jade Emperor. “I’ll play a good joke on them,” said the monster to herself. In a mountain hollow, this virtuoso fiend transformed herself into a ravishingly beautiful girl—bright eyes, red lips, white teeth, moonlike visage, delicate hands, tiny feet—wearing an emerald silk dress.","He leapt into the sky, whistling. Putting up his hand to shade his fiery eyes with their golden pupils, he looked all around below him, but saw no sign of the horse. He put his cloud away and reported, “Master, that horse of ours must have been eaten by the dragon—I can't see it anywhere.” “Disciple,” Sanzang protested, “how could that wretched creature have a mouth big enough to swallow a horse that size, saddle and all? I think the horse must have slipped its bridle in a panic and run into that valley. Go and have a more careful look.” “You don't know about my powers,” Monkey replied. “These eyes of mine can see what's happening three hundred miles away, and within that range I can even spot a dragonfly spreading its wings. There's no way I could miss a big horse like that.” “But we'll never get across those thousands of mountains and rivers.” As he spoke, his tears fell like rain. The sight of him crying was too much for Brother Monkey, who flared up and shouted, “Stop being such an imbecile, master. Sit there and wait while I find that wretch and make him give us back our horse.” “You mustn't go,” said Sanzang, grabbing hold of him."
是夜在禅堂歇宿。那三藏想着袈裟，那里得稳睡？忽翻身见窗外透白，急起叫道：“悟空，天明了，快寻袈裟去。”行者一骨鲁跳将起来，早见众僧侍立，供奉汤水，行者道：“你等用心伏侍我师父，老孙去也。”三藏下床扯住道：“你往那里去？”行者道“我想这桩事都是观音菩萨没理，他有这个禅院在此，受了这里人家香火，又容那妖精邻住。我去南海寻他，与他讲一讲，教他亲来问妖精讨袈裟还我。”三藏道：“你这去，几时回来？”行者道：“时少只在饭罢，时多只在晌午就成功了。那些和尚，可好伏侍，老孙去也。”说声去，早已无踪。须臾间，到了南海，停云观看，但见那：汪洋海远，水势连天。祥光笼宇宙，瑞气照山川。千层雪浪吼青霄，万迭烟波滔白昼。水飞四野，浪滚周遭。水飞四野振轰雷，浪滚周遭鸣霹雳。休言水势，且看中间。五色朦胧宝迭山，红黄紫皂绿和蓝。才见观音真胜境，试看南海落伽山。好去处！山峰高耸，顶透虚空。中间有千样奇花，百般瑞草。风摇宝树，日映金莲。观音殿瓦盖琉璃，潮音洞门铺玳瑁。绿杨影里语鹦哥，紫竹林中啼孔雀。罗纹石上，护法威严；玛瑙滩前，木叉雄壮。这行者观不尽那异景非常，径直按云头，到竹林之下。早有诸天迎接道：“菩萨前者对众言大圣归善，甚是宣扬。今保唐僧，如何得暇到此？”行者道：“因保唐僧，路逢一事，特见菩萨，烦为通报。”诸天遂来洞口报知。菩萨唤入，行者遵法而行，至宝莲台下拜了。菩萨问曰：“你来何干？”行者道：“我师父路遇你的禅院，你受了人间香火，容一个黑熊精在那里邻住，着他偷了我师父袈裟，屡次取讨不与，今特来问你要的。”菩萨道：“这猴子说话，这等无状！既是熊精偷了你的袈裟，你怎来问我取讨？都是你这个孽猴大胆，将宝贝卖弄，拿与小人看见，你却又行凶，唤风发火，烧了我的留云下院，反来我处放刁！”行者见菩萨说出这话，知他晓得过去未来之事，慌忙礼拜道：“菩萨，乞恕弟子之罪，果是这般这等。但恨那怪物不肯与我袈裟，师父又要念那话儿咒语，老孙忍不得头疼，故此来拜烦菩萨。望菩萨慈悲之心，助我去拿那妖精，取衣西进也。”菩萨道：“那怪物有许多神通，却也不亚于你。也罢，我看唐僧面上，和你去走一遭。”行者闻言，谢恩再拜。即请菩萨出门，遂同驾祥云，早到黑风山，坠落云头，依路找洞。,"It was night in the meditation hall. That Sanzang thinks about the cassock, where should he sleep peacefully? Suddenly turning over and seeing the whiteness outside the window, he cried out in a hurry: ""Wukong, it's dawn, hurry up and look for the robe."" The walker jumped up and saw all the monks standing and offering the soup, and the walker said: ""You wait and serve me with your heart. Master, the old grandson is going too."" Sanzang got out of bed and grabbed him and said, ""Where are you going?"" The traveler said, ""I think this matter is all ignored by Guanyin Bodhisattva. He has this temple here, and he received the incense of others here. Let that goblin live next door. I'll go to the South China Sea to find him, talk to him, and teach him to come and ask the goblin to ask the goblin to return the robe to me."" Sanzang said, ""You're going here, when will you come back?"" After dinner, Shiduo succeeded only in the noon. Those monks are so good to serve, and the old grandson is gone."" After he said that, he had long since disappeared. After a short while, I arrived at the South China Sea and stopped the clouds to watch, but I saw it: the ocean is far away, and the water is powerful. Auspicious light cages the universe, auspicious air illuminates the mountains and rivers. Thousand layers of snow waves roar Qingxiao, and thousands of smoke waves surge into the day. The water flies in the four fields, and the waves roll around. The water flies and the four fields rumble and thunder, and the waves roll around with thunder. Stop talking about the water potential, and look at the middle. Five-color hazy Baodie Mountain, red, yellow, purple, soap, green and blue. Only when I saw Guanyin's real vista, try to see Luojia Mountain in the South China Sea. ideas! The peaks are so high that they penetrate the void. There are thousands of exotic flowers in the middle, and all kinds of grasses. The wind shakes the precious tree, and the sun shines on the golden lotus. The Guanyin Hall is covered with glazed tiles, and the door of Chaoyin Cave is covered with tortoiseshell. Parrots speak in the shadow of green poplars, peacocks sing in the purple bamboo forest. On the ribbed stone, the guardian is majestic; in front of the agate beach, the wooden fork is majestic. The pilgrim couldn't see the strange scenery, so he pressed the head of the cloud and went under the bamboo forest. The heavens have long greeted him and said, ""The former Bodhisattva preached to everyone that the great sage returned to good. Now, how can I protect the Tang monk, how can I get here?"" To inform."" The heavens came to the cave entrance to report. The Bodhisattva called in, and the practitioner followed the Dharma, and bowed down to the lotus altar. The Bodhisattva asked, ""What are you doing here?"" The traveler said, ""My master met your Zen temple on the way, and you received the incense of the world, and let a black bear spirit be there next to him. He stole my master's cassock and repeatedly took it back. Yes, I'm here to ask you what you want."" The Bodhisattva said, ""This monkey speaks without any form! Since Xiong Jing stole your robe, why did you ask me to ask for it? Babe is showing off, Na and the villain see it, but you are murdering again, calling the wind and getting angry, and burning down my Liuyun courtyard, but I will let you go!"" When the practitioner saw the Bodhisattva saying this, he knew that he knew the past and the future. He hurriedly bowed and said, ""Bodhisattva, beg for forgiveness of the sins of the disciples, the result is like this. But I hate that monster for not wanting to wear a cassock with me, and the master wants to recite that mantra again. The old grandson couldn't bear the headache, so he came to pay his respects to the Bodhisattva. I hope the compassionate heart of the Bodhisattva will help me to get that fairy and go west."" The Bodhisattva said, ""That monster has many supernatural powers, but it is no less than yours. Well, I will go with you on the face of Monk Tang. Once."" The traveler heard the words and thanked him again. Immediately, he invited the Bodhisattva to go out, and then he rode the auspicious cloud with him, arrived at the Black Wind Mountain early, fell into the cloud head, and followed the road to find a hole.","So they spent the night in the Chan hall, but Tripitaka was thinking about the cassock. How could he possibly sleep well? As he tossed and turned, he suddenly saw the windows growing bright. He arose at once and called: “Wukong, it’s morning. Go find the cassock quickly.” Pilgrim leaped up with a bound and saw that the monks were bringing in washing water. “All of you,” said Pilgrim, “take care to minister to my master. Old Monkey is leaving.” Getting up from his bed, Tripitaka clutched at him, asking, “Where are you going?” “Come to think of it,” said Pilgrim, “this whole affair reveals the irresponsibility of the Bodhisattva Guanyin. She has a Chan hall here where she has enjoyed the incense and worship of all the local people, and yet she can permit a monster-spirit to be her neighbor. I’m leaving for the South Sea to find her for a little conversation. I’m going to ask her to come here and demand that the monster return the cassock to us.” “When will you be back?” asked Tripitaka. “Probably right after breakfast,” answered Pilgrim. “At the latest, I should be back around noon, when everything should be taken care of. All of you monks must take care to wait on my master. Old Monkey is leaving.” He said he was leaving, and the next instant he was already out of sight. In a moment, he arrived at the South Sea, where he stopped his cloud to look around. He saw A vast expanse of ocean, Where water and sky seemed to merge. Auspicious light shrouded the earth; Hallowed air brightened the world. Endless snow-capped waves surged up to Heaven; Layers of misty billows washed out the sun. Water flying every where; Waves churning all around. Water flying every where rolled like thunderclaps; Waves churning all around boomed like cannonade. Speak not merely of water; Let’s look more at the center. The treasure-filled mountain of five dazzling colors: Red, yellow, green, deep purple, and blue. If this be Guanyin’s scenic region true, Look further at Potalaka of South Sea. What a splendid place! The tall mountain peak Cut through airy space. In its midst were thousands of rare flowers, A hundred kinds of divine herbs. The wind stirred the precious trees; The sun shone on the golden lotus. Glazed tiles covered the Guanyin Hall; Tortoiseshell spread before the Tidal-Sound Cave. In the shades of green willow the parrot spoke; Within the bamboo grove the peacock sang. On rocks with grains like fingerprints, The guardians fierce and solemn. Before the cornelian foreshore, Mokṣa strong and heroic. Pilgrim, who could hardly take his eyes off the marvelous scenery, lowered his cloud and went straight to the bamboo grove. The various deities were there to receive him, saying, “The Bodhisattva told us some time ago about the conversion of the Great Sage, for whom she had nothing but praise. You are supposed to be accompanying the Tang Monk at this moment. How do you have the time to come here?” “Because I am accompanying the Tang Monk,” said Pilgrim, “I had an incident on our journey about which I must see the Bodhisattva. Please announce my arrival.” The deities went to the mouth of the cave to make the announcement, and the Bodhisattva asked him to enter. Obeying the summons, Pilgrim went before the bejeweled lotus platform and knelt down. “What are you doing here?” asked the Bodhisattva. “On his journey my master came across one of your Chan halls,” said Pilgrim, “where you receive the services of fire and incense from the local people. But you also permitted a Black Bear Spirit to live nearby and to steal the cassock of my master. Several times I tried to get it back but without success. I have come specifically to ask you for it.” The Bodhisattva said, “This monkey still speaks insolently! If the Bear Spirit stole your cassock, why did you come to ask me for it? It was all because you had the presumption, you wretched ape, to show off your treasure to sinister people. Moreover, you had your share of evildoing when you called for the wind to intensify the fire, which burned down one of my way stations down below. And yet you still want to be rowdy around here?” When Pilgrim heard the Bodhisattva speaking like that, he realized that she had knowledge of past and future events. Hurriedly he bowed with humility and said, “Bodhisattva, please pardon the offense of your disciple. It was as you said. But I’m upset by the monster’s refusal to give us back our cassock, and my master is threatening to recite that spell of his at any moment. I can’t bear the headache, and that’s why I have come to cause you inconvenience. I beseech the Bodhisattva to have mercy on me and help me capture that monster, so that we may recover the garment and proceed toward the West.” “That monster has great magical power,” said the Bodhisattva, “really just as strong as yours. All right! For the sake of the Tang Monk, I’ll go with you this time.” When Pilgrim heard this, he bowed again in gratitude and asked the Bodhisattva to leave at once. They mounted the blessed clouds and soon arrived on the Black Wind Mountain. Dropping down from the clouds, they followed a path to look for the cave.",,"Seal the container with this tag labeled ‘ For the Urgent Attention of Laozi.’ He’ll be slime in an hour and three-quarters.” Back on the mountaintop, pinned beneath three notable geographical features, Monkey was not ready to go quietly. He wailed so loudly that the Golden-Headed Guardian and the Protectors of the Five Directions, whom Guanyin had deputized to escort the pilgrimage, the god of the mountain, and the spirit of the soil held a conference about it. “Do you know who you’ve got trapped beneath these mountains?” Golden-Headed Guardian asked the local divinities. They shook their heads. “Monkey, formerly known as the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, who caused such a rumpus in Heaven five centuries ago. What on earth were you thinking of, lending that fiend those mountains to crush him? If Monkey ever escapes, you’re all dead meat.” The resident deities went ashen. “We had no idea. We were just following the Moving Mountain spell we heard.” “What’s done is done. You’ll just have to plead ignorance and hope he doesn’t puree you after we release him.” After a brief further discussion, the local spirits nervously approached and introduced themselves to Monkey. “What of it?” responded Monkey, not in the mood for small talk. “Permit us to remove the mountains from your head and shoulders and beg-your-pardon-for-the-inconvenience-none-intended.” “Go ahead. No hard feelings.” The relieved deities recited some spells and the mountains returned to their homes. Monkey instantly sprang up. Pausing only to hitch up his tiger-skin kilt, he whipped out his staff. “Show me your shanks! Two strokes each for favoring a monster over Monkey.” “But these mountain demons are just too powerful,” protested the spirits. “We have to be at their beck and call.” “Outrageous!” cried Monkey. “Even in my most outlandish moments I never ordered a local deity around.” (He omitted to mention here that he might have urinated on the hand of the Buddha.) Two shafts of light coming from a nearby valley suddenly distracted him. “What’s that?” “Some goblins, I suspect, with the monsters’ treasures, here to capture you.” “Finally, some fun!” exclaimed Monkey. “A question, quickly: who would be their favorite sort of visitor?” “They’re obsessed with elixirs—a Taoist, therefore.” “I’ll postpone your beating for another day. Monkey has other business for now.” The deities did not wait for him to change his mind. Monkey transformed himself into the very image of an old Taoist priest—patchwork robe, hair pulled up in two topknots—and reclined by the roadside, awaiting the imps. As they approached, he introduced himself by sticking out his golden-hooped staff for one of the goblins to trip over. “If my kings weren’t so fond of Taoists, I’d punch your lights out!” whined the imp, who had gone flying. Monkey smiled sweetly. “Oh, tripping people up when we first meet them is just a custom of my country.” “You can’t be from around here, then.” “Indeed not. I hail from Mount Penglai, the island of the immortals.” “Then you must be—an immortal!” The imp quickly swallowed his anger. “Pardon our ignorance.” “No offense taken.","This night he spent asleep in the monastery. Sanzang, however, could not sleep for thinking about the cassock. He turned over, and seeing that the sky was growing light outside the window, got straight out of bed and said, “Monkey, it's light, go and get the cassock.” Brother Monkey bounded out of bed, and in an instant a host of monks was in attendance, offering hot water. “Look after my master properly,” he said. “I'm off.” Sanzang got out of bed and seized hold of him. “Where are you going?” he asked. “I've been thinking,” said Monkey, “that this whole business is the Bodhisattva Guanyin's fault. Although this is her monastery and she receives the worship of all these monks, she allows that evil spirit to live in the neighbourhood. I'm going to the Southern Sea to find her and ask her to come here herself to make that evil spirit give us back the cassock.” “When will you come back?” Sanzang asked. “After you've finished breakfast at the earliest, and by midday at latest, I'll have done the job. Those monks had better look after you well. I'm off now.” No sooner were the words out of his mouth than he had disappeared without a trace and reached the Southern Sea. Stopping his cloud to take a look, he saw: A vast expanse of ocean, Waters stretching till they joined the sky. Propitious light filled the firmament, Auspicious vapours shone over mountains and rivers. A thousand snow-capped breakers roared at the azure vault, A myriad misty waves reared at the sky. Water flew in all directions, Torrents poured everywhere. As the water flew in all directions it echoed like thunder; As the torrents poured everywhere they crashed and roared. Let us leave the sea, And consider what lay in it: A precious mountain in many a misty color— Red, yellow, purple, black, green, and blue. Then did he see the beautiful land of Guanyin, Potaraka Island in the Southern Sea. What a wonderful place to go— Towering peaks Cutting through the sky, With a thousand kinds of exotic flowers below them, And every type of magical herb. The wind shook priceless trees, The sun shone on golden lotus. Guanyin's palace was roofed with glazed tiles, The gates of the Tide Cave were set with tortoise shell. In the shade of green willows parrots talked, While peacocks called amid purple bamboo. On the marbled stone The protecting gods are majestically severe; . Before the agate strand Stands the mighty Moksa. Not pausing to take in the whole of this exotic scene, Monkey brought his cloud straight down to land under the bamboo grove. A number of devas were already there to meet him, and they said, “The Bodhisattva told us some time ago that you had been converted, Great Sage, and praised you very warmly. But if you are now protecting the Tang Priest, how have you found the time to come here?” “Because something has happened while I've been escorting him on his journey. Please go and tell the Bodhisattva that I'd like an audience with her.” When the devas went into the cave to report this, Guanyin summoned him inside. Monkey did as he was told and bowed to her beneath the lotus throne. “What have you come for?” the Bodhisattva asked. “My master's journey has brought him to a monastery of yours,” Monkey replied, “and I find that although you accept incense from its monks, you allow a black bear spirit to live in the neighbourhood, and have let him steal my master's cassock. I've tried to take it off him a number of times but got nowhere, so now I've come to ask you to demand it from him.” “What nonsense, you ape,” the Bodhisattva retorted. “Even if a bear spirit has stolen your cassock, what business have you to ask me to go and demand it for you? It all happened because you wanted to show it off, you big-headed and evil baboon, in front of petty-minded people. On top of that, in your wickedness you called up the wind to spread the fire that burnt down my monastery. And now you have the nerve to try your tricks here.” These words from the Bodhisattva made Monkey realize that she knew all about the past and the future, so he hastily bowed down in reverence and pleaded, “Bodhisattva, forgive your disciple his sins, everything you say is true. All the same, my master will recite that spell again because that monster won't give back the cassock, and I couldn't bear the agonizing headache. That's why I came to bother you, Bodhisattva. I beg you in your mercy to help me catch that evil spirit, get the cassock back, and carry on towards the West.” “That monster's magical powers are certainly no weaker than yours,” the Bodhisattva said. “Very well then, out of consideration for the Tang Priest I'll go there with you.” Monkey thanked her and bowed again, asked her to come out, and rode on the same magic cloud as her. In next to no time they reached the Black Wind Mountain, where they landed the cloud and headed for the cave on foot."

老儿十分欢喜，才教展抹桌椅，摆列斋供。斋罢将晚，老儿问道：“要甚兵器？要多少人随？趁早好备。”行者道：“兵器我自有。”老儿道：“二位只是那根锡杖，锡杖怎么打得妖精？”行者随于耳内取出一个绣花针来，捻在手中，迎风幌了一幌，就是碗来粗细的一根金箍铁棒，对着高老道：“你看这条棍子，比你家兵器如何？可打得这怪否？”高老又道：“既有兵器，可要人跟？”行者道：“我不用人，只是要几个年高有德的老儿，陪我师父清坐闲叙，我好撇他而去。等我把那妖精拿来，对众取供，替你除了根罢。”那老儿即唤家僮，请了几个亲故朋友。一时都到，相见已毕，行者道：“师父，你放心稳坐，老孙去也。”,"The old man was very happy, so he taught me to spread the tables and chairs, and set up the fasting offerings. When the meal was over, the old man asked, ""How many weapons do you want? How many people do you need? Get ready as soon as possible."" The walker said, ""I have my own weapons."" Got a goblin?"" The walker took out an embroidery needle from his ear, twisted it in his hand, and slapped it against the wind, it was a gold-hooped iron rod as thick as a bowl, and said to Old Man Gao, ""Look at this stick, it's better than How about your weapons? Can you fight like this?"" Elder Gao said again, ""If you have weapons, do you need someone to follow you?"" Walker said, ""I don't need anyone, I just want a few old and virtuous elders to accompany you. My master sits quietly and talks, so I can leave him alone. When I bring that goblin, I will give testimony to the public, and I will remove the root for you."" The old man called the family boy and invited a few relatives and friends. When the time came, the meeting was over, and the traveler said, ""Master, you can rest assured and sit tight, the old grandson is gone.""","The old man was delighted; he asked at once for tables to be set and a vegetarian feast to be prepared. When they had finished the meal, evening was setting in. The old man asked, “What sort of weapons and how many people do you need? We’d better prepare soon.” “I have my own weapon,” replied Pilgrim. The old man said, “The only thing the two of you have is that priestly staff, hardly something you can use to battle the monster,” whereupon Pilgrim took an embroidery needle out of his ear, held it in his hands, and waving it once in the wind, changed it into a golden-hooped rod with the thickness of a rice bowl. “Look at this rod,” he said to old Mr. Gao. “How does it compare with your weapons? Think it’ll do for the monster?” “Since you have a weapon,” said old Mr. Gao again, “do you need some attendants?” “No need for any attendants,” said Pilgrim. “All I ask for is some decent elderly persons to keep my master company and talk with him, so that I may feel free to leave him for a while. I’ll catch the monster for you and make him promise publicly to leave, so that you will be rid of him for good.” The old man at once asked his houseboy to send for several intimate friends and relatives, who soon arrived. After they were introduced, Pilgrim said, “Master, you may feel quite safe sitting here. Old Monkey is off!”",,"And when we don’t have anything for them, they smash up our temples and rip our clothes.” “Who is he, and where does he live?” asked Monkey. “We know him by the name of Red Boy, son of King Bull Demon and Princess Iron-Fan, and he lives in Fire-Cloud Cave, where he has perfected the art of demonic flames.” Monkey now returned, beaming, to his comrades. “Nothing to worry about here,” he told them. “Tripitaka’ll be fine—he’s been captured by one of my relatives. When I was the king of Flower-Fruit Mountain, I swore blood brotherhood with one King Bull Demon—his son’s the fireball who kidnapped Tripitaka. I’m sure he’ll release Tripitaka to his favorite uncle.” Sandy was dubious. “You’ve not seen this relative of yours for at least five hundred years or—I imagine—sent him birthday gifts or greetings. Are you sure he’ll remember you?” “Look,” said Monkey, “he might not lay on a banquet for us, but he’ll give us back our spiritual leader, for sure.” Within a few days, they found their way to Fire-Cloud Cave. Monkey and Pigsy approached, while Sandy guarded the luggage and the horse from a distance.","The old man was delighted. He had a table and chairs set out and wiped clean, and a vegetarian meal brought in. When the meal was over and he was about to go to bed, the old man asked, “What weapons and how many men will you need? I'll get everything ready in good time.” “I have a weapon,” Monkey replied. “You two gentlemen only have your monastic staves —how will you be able to kill the fiend with them?” the old man asked. Monkey produced the embroidery needle from his ear, held it between his fingers, and shook it in the wind. It turned into the gold-banded cudgel as thick as a rice-bowl. Monkey turned to Squire Gao and asked, “How does this cudgel compare with the weapons you have in here? Will it do to kill the monster?” “So you have the weapon,” the old man went on, “but what about the men?” “I can do it single-handed.” Monkey replied, “though I would like a few respectable old gentlemen to come in and keep my master company while I'm away from him. When I've captured the monster they can witness his confession before I wipe him out for you.” The old man thereupon sent his servants to ask a few old friends over, and before long they had all arrived. When the introductions were over Monkey said, “Master, you sit here and don't worry."
绿树能攀折，知寒善谕时。准灵惟显处，故此号山君。又见那后边来的是一条胖汉，你道怎生模样：嵯峨双角冠，端肃耸肩背。性服青衣稳，蹄步多迟滞。宗名父作牯，原号母称牸。能为田者功，因名特处士。,"Green trees can climb and break, know when cold is good. The quasi-spirit is only visible, hence the name Shanjun. Then I saw a fat man coming from behind. How do you look like: Saga double-horned crown, shrugging his shoulders solemnly. Tsing Yi is stable in sexual clothes, and hoof steps are more sluggish. Zong's name was his father Zuo Ku, and his original mother was called Ku. Able to work for the field, because of his reputation as a special sergeant.","He could break or climb the green trees, And predicted when winter was near. Truly he was most clever. Hence Mountain Lord was his name. Following behind him was another husky fellow. “How did he look?” you ask. A cap of twin horns rugged, And a humpback most majestic. His green robe showed his calm nature, He walked with a slumberous gait. He came from a father named Bull; His mother’s proper name was Cow. A great boon to people who plowed, He was thus called the Steer Hermit.","Having heard this, Sun mounted on a cloud and arrived at Jilei Mountain. There he met the fox princess, the present wife of the Ox-Head Demon, whom he upbraided and pursued back to her cave. The Ox-Head Demon came out and became very angry with Sun for having terrified her. Sun asked him to return to his previous wife, the raksha, and beg the Magic Fan of her. This the Ox-Head Demon refused to do. Then they fought three times together, and Sun was victorious. With the consent of the Ox-Head Demon, Sun assumed his shape and visited the raksha. He was very nice to her.","he snapped and shot off into the air. “Ach,” Tripitaka sighed. “I just offered him a little constructive criticism and off he went in a huff. It seems that fate does not wish me to have a disciple. Even if I wanted him back, I have no idea how to summon him. I’ll just have to go on alone.” His staff in one hand, the reins in the other, he plodded sadly on westward. Before long, he spotted coming down the mountain toward him an old woman holding a silk shirt and a patterned cap.","He could uproot and snap a green tree, And when he left cold he could change the weather. Clearly he shows his miraculous powers, For which he is known as the Mountain Lord. Behind him Sanzang saw a fat man. Do you know what he looked like? A hat with two towering horns, His shoulders squarely set. He liked to wear dull-coloured clothes, And his pace was always sluggish. His male ancestors were called Bull; His mother was known as Cow, As he could work for farmers, His name was Hermit Ox."
行者没及奈何，只得回见三藏道：“师父，这个怪被老孙骂将出来，他与我赌斗多时，怯战而走，只躲在水中间，再不出来了。”三藏道：“不知端的可是他吃了我马？”行者道：“你看你说的话！不是他吃了，他还肯出来招声，与老孙犯对？”三藏道：,"The traveler had no choice but to return to Sanzang and said, ""Master, this monster was scolded by the old grandson to come out. He fought with me for a long time. I don't know why, but he ate my horse?"" The traveler said, ""Look at what you said! It wasn't because he ate it, and he was willing to come out and say something to fight Lao Sun?"" Sanzang said:","Pilgrim had little choice but to return to Tripitaka, saying, “Master, that monster made his appearance as a result of my tongue-lashing. He fought with me for a long time before taking fright and running. He’s hiding in the water now and refuses to come out again.” “Do you know for certain that it was he who ate my horse?” asked Tripitaka. “Listen to the way you talk!” said Pilgrim. “If he hadn’t eaten it, would he be willing to face me and answer me like that?” “The time you killed the tiger,” said Tripitaka, “you claimed that you had the ability to tame dragons and subdue tigers.","Happily Guanyin gave me a chance to redeem myself by accompanying the Master to the West, and in this way bring forth good fruit. I understand religion much better now. My name is Sha the Monk, also known as the Seeker of Purity.” When the king heard this, he was very glad, because his own daughter had chosen to marry a living Buddha, and also very much alarmed, because all three disciples were strange spirits. Then an official came to announce to the king that the propitious day for the marriage was the twelfth of that month, and so it was fixed for that day. As it was only the eighth, the king provided daily feasts for the prospective son-in-law, and the disciples.","Why didn’t you send your husband instead? Why are you, a married woman, wandering out here on your own, without even a servant? Most unseemly!” Tripitaka asked. “My husband is in the north, digging the fields with a few laborers,” she embroidered further with a coy smile. “I cooked this food to deliver to them.","Monkey could do nothing, so he had to report to Sanzang, “Master, I swore at that ogre till it came out, and after fighting me for ages it fled in terror. It's now in the water and won't come out again.” “Are you sure that it really ate our horse?” Sanzang asked."

The Dragon King said, ""Please tell me what the weather is like in the sky."" The master passed on a lesson and said, ""The top of the mountain is lost in clouds, and the top of the forest is covered by fog. If the rain is covered, it must be in the Ming Dynasty. The Dragon King said, ""When will it rain tomorrow? How big is the rain?"" The master said, ""Tomorrow will be cloudy at dawn, thunder will come, it will rain at noon, and it will be rainy in the near future. The total amount of water is three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points."" "". The Dragon King smiled and said, ""This statement cannot be used as a joke. If it rains tomorrow, according to the number of hours you have decided, I will give you fifty taels of tuition money as a thank you. If there is no rain, or if the number of hours is not met, I will tell you the truth. Destroy your facade, smash your signboard, and drive out of Chang'an immediately, you are not allowed to confuse the public here!"" The gentleman replied: ""This must be up to you. Please, please, the rain will come later in the Ming Dynasty.""","The Master asked, “What would you like to know?” The Dragon King said, “Please forecast the weather.” The Master consulted his sticks and made his judgment: Clouds hide the hilltop And fog shrouds the tree. The rain you’d divine Tomorrow you’ll see. “At what hour will it rain tomorrow, and how much rain will there be?” asked the Dragon King. “At the hour of the Dragon the clouds will gather,” said the Master, “and thunder will be heard at the hour of the Serpent. Rain will come at the hour of the Horse and reach its limit at the hour of the Sheep.21 There will be altogether three feet, three inches, and forty-eight drops of rain.” “You had better not be joking now,” said the Dragon King, laughing. “If it rains tomorrow and if it is in accordance with the time and the amount you prophesied, I shall present you with fifty taels of gold as my thanks. But if it does not rain, or if the amount and the hours are incorrect, I tell you truly that I shall come and break your front door to pieces and tear down your shop sign. You will be chased out of Chang’an at once so that you may no longer seduce the multitude.” “You may certainly do that,” said the Master amiably. “Good-bye for now. Please come again tomorrow after the rain.”","I extinguished all my passions, Had communion with heavenly beings. The Jade Emperor made me Chamberlain, Armed with sword and buckler I was leader of his bodyguard. But when the Queen of Heaven Ordered her peach banquet, By mischance some crystals broke, And I was sentenced to death. A bare footed Taoist begged to spare my life. I received eight hundred strokes And was banished to these Quicksands, Where to keep from starvation","the fortune-teller asked after serving his new client tea. “I would like a weather forecast for tomorrow,” the dragon king requested. Master Yuan consulted the divination sticks up his sleeve. “Clouds will confuse the peaks. Mists will shroud the treetops. Those wishing for rain will not be disappointed.” “What time and how much will it rain?” the dragon king pressed him. “Clouds will appear at the hour of the Dragon. Thunder will sound at the hour of the Serpent. The rain will commence at the hour of the Horse and end at the hour of the Sheep. In total, three feet, three inches, and forty-eight drops of water will fall.” “I hope you’re not joking,” responded the dragon king. “If all is exactly as you say, I will thank you for your forecast with fifty ounces of gold. If not, I will expose you as a fraud, break down your door, tear up your sign, and drive you out of Chang’an.” “As you like,” said Master Yuan amiably. “Do come again—after the rain.”","“What have you come to ask about, sir?” asked the soothsayer, and the dragon king replied, “I beg you to uncover the secrets of the sky for me.” The soothsayer passed him a slip of paper from his sleeve and said, “Clouds obscure the mountain peak, mist covers the tree tops. If there is to be rain, it will certainly come tomorrow.” “When will it rain tomorrow,” asked the dragon king, “and how many inches of rain will fall?” “Tomorrow the clouds will gather at mid-morning; late in the morning there will be thunder; at noon it will start to rain; and in the early afternoon the rain will finish, after 3 feet 3.48 inches have fallen,” replied the soothsayer. “I trust that you are not fooling,” said the dragon king. “If it rains tomorrow at the time and to the depth you have predicted I shall pay you a fee of fifty pieces of gold. If it does not rain, or if it does not rain at the time and to the depth you say it will, then I'm telling you straight that I'll smash up your shopfront, tear down your sign and run you out of Chang'an so that you won't be able to deceive the people a moment longer.” “That is entirely up to you,” replied the other cheerfully. “We shall meet again tomorrow after the rain.”"

If the old grandson has such a spell, he will recite it a thousand times! This time, there are many black bears, and they have taught him!"" But he said that the monster had been awake for a long time, and it was fair. Unable to contain the pain, he had to kneel on the ground and begged: ""But spare your life, may I take refuge!"" The Bodhisattva fell into the auspicious light, and he mounted the top with him to receive the precepts, and taught him to hold a long spear and follow him left and right. That black bear is only ambitious today, and the infinite stubbornness will be closed at this time. The Bodhisattva instructed: ""Wukong, you can go back. You can live and serve the Tang monk, and then you will not be lazy and work in the future.""","“Truly a salvific and merciful goddess,” said Pilgrim, laughing, “who will not hurt a single sentient being. If old Monkey knew a spell like that, he’d recite it a thousand times. That would finish off as many black bears as there are around here!” So, we shall tell you about the monster, who regained consciousness after along time. Convinced by the unbearable pain, he had no choice but to fall on his knees and beg: “Spare my life, for I’m willing to submit to Truth!” Dropping down from the blessed luminosity, the Bodhisattva then touched his head and gave him the commandments, telling him to wait on her, holding the lance. So it was with the Black Bear: Today his vaulting ambition is checked; This time his boundless license has been curbed. “You may return now, Wukong,” instructed the Bodhisattva, “and serve the Tang Monk attentively. Don’t start any more trouble with your carelessness.”",,"Out of my sight, you useless lumps!” shouted Silver Horn at Cunning Devil and Wily Worm, who could hardly believe their luck. “Send in some competent goblins instead.” In came imps three and four, Mountain Tiger and Lounging Dragon. “Go and invite our mother to dinner, and ask her to bring the Golden Rope with her. Don’t mess this up.” Off the two new goblins raced, with Monkey-as-fly buzzing in pursuit. Two or three miles into the journey, Monkey turned himself into another goblin and pretended to be running to catch up with them. “Wait for me!” he called.","“You certainly are the all-merciful deliverer who doesn't allow a single soul to perish,” said Monkey with a laugh. “If I knew a spell like that one of yours, I'd say it a thousand times over and finish off all the black bears I could find.” Although the bear spirit had come round and the spell had stopped, he was still in great pain as he knelt on the ground and begged pitifully, “Spare my life and I promise I'll return to the truth.” The Bodhisattva descended in a ray of light, placed her hands on his head, and administered the monastic discipline to him; then she told him to take up his spear and accompany her. The black bear's evil intentions ceased from that day on, and his unbounded perversity came to an end. “Sun Wukong,” ordered the Bodhisattva, “go back now. Serve the Tang Priest well, don't be lazy, and don't start trouble.”"
“既如此，不敢久留，请大圣早发慈悲，莫要疏久了你师父。”行者见他催促请行，急耸身，出离海藏，驾着云，别了龙王。正走，却遇着南海菩萨。菩萨道：“孙悟空，你怎么不受教诲，不保唐僧，来此处何干？”慌得个行者在云端里施礼道：“向蒙菩萨善言，果有唐朝僧到，揭了压帖，救了我命，跟他做了徒弟。他却怪我凶顽，我才闪了他一闪，如今就去保他也。”菩萨道：“赶早去，莫错过了念头。”言毕各回。,"""Since that's the case, I don't dare to stay for a long time. Please be merciful to the Great Sage as soon as possible, and don't neglect your master for a long time."" Seeing him urging him to go, the walker shrugged and left the sea, riding a cloud and saying goodbye to the Dragon King. As he was walking, he met the Bodhisattva of the South China Sea. The Bodhisattva said, ""Sun Wukong, why are you not being taught and protecting the monks of Tang Dynasty, why are you here?"" A traveler in the clouds saluted in panic and said, ""Speak kindly to Meng Bodhisattva, if a monk from the Tang Dynasty arrives and removes the sticker, He saved my life and became his apprentice. But he blamed me for being stubborn, so I did away with him, and now I will protect him."" The Bodhisattva said, ""Go early, don't miss your thoughts.""","Delighted, the Dragon King said, “If that’s your wish, I dare not detain you. Instead, I ask the Great Sage to show his mercy at once and not permit his master to wait any longer.” When Pilgrim heard this exhortation to leave, he bounded right out of the oceanic region; mounting the clouds, he left the Dragon King. On his way he ran right into the Bodhisattva of South Sea. “Sun Wukong,” said the Bodhisattva, “why did you not listen to me and accompany the Tang Monk? What are you doing here?” Pilgrim was so taken aback that he saluted her on top of the clouds. “I’m most grateful for the kind words of the Bodhisattva,” he said. “A monk from the Tang court did appear, lifted the seal, and saved my life. I became his disciple, but he blamed me for being too violent. I walked out on him for a little while, but I’m going back right now to accompany him.” “Go quickly then,” said the Bodhisattva, “before you change your mind again.”","He summoned the Rain Dragon, who said to him, “Obtain an Edict from Heaven to sanction rain and I will give you as much as you desire.” At this, Sun flew away to Heaven. Meanwhile the Prefect ordered each family to reverence the Tablet of the Rain Dragon, and burn incense to him, to put out water jars and willow branches at their doors, and to worship Heaven. When Sun presented his request in Heaven, he was told by the Jade Emperor that the city did not deserve rain, as their Prefect had committed a great sin. On the 25th day of the 12th moon, which was the day when the Jade Emperor went forth to inspect Heaven and Earth, he had found an altar prepared for worship in Fengshan city, but, owing to a quarrel between the Prefect and his wife, the altar had been upset and the offerings prepared for the gods had been thrown to the dogs. This was an offence beyond pardon, so the prefecture was punished with drought. This was to last till a mountain of rice 1,000 feet high had been all eaten up by a chicken the size of a man’s fist, and till a mountain of flour 200 feet high had been licked up by a little pet dog, and a metal lock 13 inches long, which had a bolt of the thickness of one’s finger, had been burnt through by an ordinary lamp. But one of the great spirits told Sun, “Do not be discouraged at this, for if the Prefect truly repents, all this will come to pass.”","No, we need your cloud-somersaulting here.” “My cloud-somersaulting is pretty much the same as your cloud-riding except that I can travel farther and faster. I can’t carry him any more than you can. As the old saying goes: ‘It’s easier to topple Mount Tai than to lift a human off the mortal earth.’ Tripitaka has to cross all these foreign lands himself if he is to escape the bitter sea of mortality; he has to take every difficult step himself. We are his guardians: we can protect him, but we can’t suffer these hardships for him, neither can we go and pick up the scriptures ourselves. If we were to go alone, the Buddha wouldn’t hand them over to the likes of you or me.” Thus mulling over the enormity of their task, the three of them had something to eat, then spent the night on the shore of Flowing Sand. “Now what?” Tripitaka asked the next morning.","“In that case I shan't keep you. I ask you in your mercy not to leave your master waiting for long.” Being thus pressed to go, Monkey left the sea palace, mounted his cloud, and took leave of the dragon king. On his way he met the Bodhisattva Guanyin. “What are you doing here, Sun Wukong?” she asked. “Why did you reject the Tang Priest's teaching and stop protecting him?” Brother Monkey frantically bowed to her from his cloud and replied, “As you had predicted, Bodhisattva, a monk came from the Tang Empire who took off the seal, rescued me, and made me his disciple. I ran away from him because he thought I was wicked and incorrigible, but now I'm going back to protect him.” “Hurry up then, and don't have any more wicked thoughts.” With that they each went their separate ways."
当日三斋已毕，唐王驾回。待七日正会，复请拈香。时天色将晚，各官俱退。怎见得好晚？你看那：万里长空淡落辉，归鸦数点下栖迟。满城灯火人烟静，正是禅僧入定时。一宿晚景题过。,"The three fastings were over that day, and the King of Tang drove back. After the main meeting on the seventh day, please ask Nianxiang again. It will be late and all the officials will retire. Why are you so late? Look at that: the sky fades away for thousands of miles, and the crows count down and settle down. The city is full of lights and people are quiet, it is the time when the Zen monks enter. One night scene has been questioned.","The twelve hundred monks all touched their foreheads to the ground to express their gratitude. After the three vegetarian meals of the day, the Tang emperor returned to the palace to wait for the formal celebration of the mass seven days hence, when he would again be invited to raise incense. As dusk was about to fall, the various officials all retired. What sort of evening was this? Look at The long stretch of clear sky as twilight dims, As specks of jackdaw drop to their perch late. People grow quiet, the city full of lights: Now’s the time for Chan monks to meditate. We have told you about the scenery of the night.","The Monkey said, “You just pray, and I will do the rest.” The Master therefore mounted the platform and reverently prayed the Heart Sutra. Sun quickly took out his spear from his ear and raised the point of it to the sky. Immediately the sound of wind filled the place, not of ordinary wind, but of a great typhoon, and tiles were lifted off the roofs, and bricks rolled about, with gravel and stones. Then he raised the point of his spear a second time, and mist and clouds darkened all like night. Then he raised the point of his spear a third time, and then thunder and lightning broke forth as if the earth and mountains were split asunder, and so terrified the people that every family in the city burnt incense and paper money to their gods. Then he raised the point of his spear the fourth time, and rain fell as if buckets were being emptied, and all the streets were running with rivers, so that the king cried out, “Enough, enough!”","The emperor immediately summoned Xuanzang into the throne room; presented him with his travel permit, a purple-gold begging bowl, two attendants, and a horse; and told him he should leave immediately. The emperor and his officials personally saw Xuanzang out of the city wall, where the monks from Xuanzang’s temple were waiting with luggage containing winter and summer clothes. When all was ready for the pilgrim’s departure, the emperor lifted a cup of wine. “Do you have a nickname that your friends call you by?” he asked. “I fear I do not,” apologized Xuanzang. “Well, Guanyin called the scriptures you are seeking the Tripitaka.",When the three vegetarian meals for the day were over the Tang Emperor went back to the palace. He was invited to come back to the Grand Assembly to burn incense once more on the seventh day. As evening was now drawing in all the officials went away. It was a fine evening: A light glow suffused the boundless sky; A few crows were late in finding their roosts. Lamps were lit throughout the city as all fell still; It was just the hour for the monks to enter the trance.
且说他三众，在路餐风宿水，带月披星，早又至夏景炎天。,"Let’s talk about his three congregations. They dine on the road and stay in the water, bring the moon and stars, and arrive in the summer of summer.","He recited it frequently, and the beam of spiritual light penetrated by itself to his innermost being. We turn now to tell you about the three travelers, who dined on the wind and rested by the waters, who clothed themselves with the moon and cloaked themselves with the stars on their journey. Soon, it was the scene of summer again, beneath a torrid sky.",,Got that?” “Consider it done!”,"As that venerable elder recited it constantly, a ray of miraculous light penetrated through to him. Eating and sleeping in the open, the three of them traveled on, and before long the heat of summer was upon them."
三人望江痛哭，早已惊动水府。有巡海夜叉，将祭文呈与龙王。龙王看罢，就差鳖无帅去请光蕊来到，道：“先生，恭喜！,"The three of them looked at the river and cried bitterly, which had already disturbed the water house. There are yaksa who patrol the sea and present the sacrificial text to the Dragon King. After the Dragon King finished watching, he sent Bie Wushuai to invite Guangrui to come and said, ""Sir, congratulations!","Facing the river the three persons wept without restraint, and their sobs were heard down below in the water region. A yakṣa patrolling the waters brought the essay in its spirit form to the Dragon King, who read it and at once sent a turtle marshal to fetch Guangrui. “Sir,” said the king, “Congratulations!","At once he mounted the clouds, reached Heaven and asked for a shade to put over the place where his Master slept and over his cassock and that the wind should blow till everything else was burnt.",Their sobs resonated deep underwater and the eulogy—transmitted to the afterlife through burning—was delivered to the dragon king. “Wonderful news!” the monarch told Guangrui.,"The bitter lamentations of the three of them startled the underwater palace. A patrolling yaksha demon handed the funerary address to the dragon king. When he had read it, the dragon king sent Marshal Turtle to ask Chen Guangrui to come and see him."
菩萨正然点看，只见那河中，泼刺一声响亮，水波里跳出一个妖魔来，十分丑恶。他生得：,"The Bodhisattva looked at it righteously, and saw a loud thorn in the river, and a monster jumped out of the water waves, very ugly. He gave birth to:","The Bodhisattva was looking over the river when suddenly a loud splash was heard, and from the midst of the waves leaped an ugly and ferocious monster. He appeared to have","Before these words were finished, they heard that a dispatch had been brought for the Dragon King from the Jade Emperor, and they saw a yellow robed official bearing an edict, which said, “I command the Dragon King to ensure that tomorrow there shall be heavy rain all over Chang’an.” This was exactly what the fortune-teller had predicted.","Just as the Bodhisattva was pondering the desolate immensity of the river, a hideous monster leaped out of the waves.",As the Bodhisattva was surveying the scene she heard a splash and saw a hideous ogre leap out of the waves. He was

Scared the aquarium and scare the turtles away. The dragons of the South Sea are trembling; the dragons of the West Sea are miserable; the dragons of the North Sea bow their heads and surrender; The iron rod, the golden crown of the phoenix's wings, the chain mail, and the walking shoes were given as gifts. He still practiced martial arts and showed his supernatural powers, but he said, 'Noisy! Noisy!' Sure enough, he was invincible, very difficult to control. , I look forward to the Holy Inquisition. I beg for the heavenly soldiers, accept this evildoer, and envoy Haiyue Qingning, and go to Yuan Antai. I will honor it."" The Dragon King thanked him. Next, Tianshi Ge Xian Weng said: ""Long live, there is King Qin Guang, the underworld master, who has entered the scriptures of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, the master of the underworld."" The table says:","From the lowly water region of the Eastern Ocean at the East Pūrvavideha Continent, the small dragon subject, Aoguang, humbly informs the Wise Lord of Heaven, the Most Eminent High God and Ruler, that a bogus immortal, Sun Wukong, born of the Flower-Fruit Mountain and resident of the Water-Curtain Cave, has recently abused your small dragon, gaining a seat in his water home by force. He demanded a weapon, employing power and intimidation; he asked for martial attire, unleashing violence and threats. He terrorized my water kinsmen, and scattered turtles and tortoises. The Dragon of the Southern Ocean trembled; the Dragon of the Western Ocean was filled with horror; the Dragon of the Northern Ocean drew back his head to surrender; and your subject Aoguang flexed his body to do obeisance. We presented him with the divine treasure of an iron rod and the gold cap with phoenix plumes; giving him also a chain-mail cuirass and cloud-treading shoes, we sent him off courteously. But even then he was bent on displaying his martial prowess and magical powers, and all he could say to us was “Sorry to have bothered you!” We are indeed no match for him, nor are we able to subdue him. Your subject therefore presents this petition and humbly begs for imperial justice. We earnestly beseech you to dispatch the Heavenly host and capture this monster, so that tranquility may be restored to the oceans and prosperity to the Lower Region. Thus we present this memorial. When the Holy Emperor had finished reading, he gave the command: “ Let the Dragon God return to the ocean. We shall send our generals to arrest the culprit.” The old Dragon King gratefully touched his forehead to the ground and left. From below the Immortal Elder Ge, the Celestial Master,8 also brought forth the report. “Your Majesty, the Minister of Darkness, King Qinguang, supported by the Bodhisattva King Kṣitigarbha, Pope of the Underworld, has arrived to present his memorial.” The jade girl in charge of communication came from the side to receive this document, which the Jade Emperor also read from the beginning. The memorial said:","After bowing, he presented his memorial as follows: “Your humble Dragon Master Aoguang of the Eastern Ocean of the Continent of the Mighty Gods, on earth for ages, memorializes the Sacred Sovereign of High Heaven, the Great Ruler of the Universe, that: Sun, the Seeker of Secrets, a monster from the Mountain Garden of the Waterfall Cave, has insulted your humble petitioner, forced himself into our Ocean Palace, demanding weapons and armor. I and my brothers gave him the precious magic iron club, a red gold helmet, chain armor and sky boots, and saw him off most civilly. But he played his tricks, used magic to frighten us with his threats and power, so that he was most difficult to manage. We humbly appeal to your sacred judgment, and beg that you send legions from Heaven to arrest this monster, so that the ocean and rocks may not be troubled, and our ancient home will be at rest.” When the Jade Emperor had read the memorial through, he ordered the Dragon King to return to his ocean home saying, “I will send generals for the monster’s arrest.” The old Dragon King kowtowed, thanked him and went away. Next there was another ancient worthy who memorialized thus: saying, “There is one of the Judges of Hell, named Prince Qinguang, who brings a complaint from the Chaplain of Hell. The complaint reads: ‘Hell is the earthly prison of the dead.","Your unworthy subject Aoguang begs to inform his imperial eminence that a bogus immortal of Water-Curtain Cave on Flower-Fruit Mountain, by the name of Sun Wukong (also known as Monkey), has been harassing this small, weak dragon. He broke into my palace, demanded a weapon using threats of grievous bodily harm, then again used intimidation to extort a suit of armor. He terrorized my watery relatives and sundry turtles and alligators. After presenting him with a magic iron staff, a golden phoenix-feather helmet, a suit of chain-mail, and cloud-shoes, my brothers and I—dragon kings, all—saw him off with all due courtesy. But still he terrorized us with magic and violence and didn’t say a proper thank you. As we ourselves are no match for him, we respectfully beg you to apprehend this demon to restore peace and prosperity to the ocean bed. Humbly yours, etc., etc. “You may return to your ocean,” the Jade Emperor replied. “We’ll deal with this miscreant.” Bowing his head in thanks, the dragon king departed. Directly afterward, further visitors were announced: “The Minister of Hell and the Pope of Darkness also wish to present a memorial.” This time the Jade Girl, the emperor’s director of communications, delivered the document to the emperor. It went like this:","Your Subject Ao Guang, the Humble Dragon of the Eastern Sea of the Eastern Continent of Superior Body in the Nether Watery Regions Reports to the Jade Emperor of the Azure Vault of Heaven Recently one Sun Wukong, an immortal fiend born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit now living in the Water Curtain Cave, bullied this humble dragon and occupied my watery house by force. He demanded a weapon by displaying magical prowess; he insisted on having armour by showing off his evil powers. He terrified the watery tribe and made the tortoises and alligators flee in terror. The dragon of the Southern Sea trembled, the dragon of the Western Sea was made miserable, the dragon of the Northern Sea had to hang his head and come in submission, and I, your subject Ao Guang, humbled myself before him. We had to present him with a miraculous iron cudgel, a golden phoenix-winged helmet, a suit of chain mail, and a pair of cloud-walking shoes; and we escorted him out politely. He continued to show off his martial arts and magic powers, and all he had to say for himself was, “My apologies for disturbing you.” There is truly no match for him, and he is uncontrollable. Your subject now presents this memorial, and respectfully awaits your sage decision. I humbly beg that heavenly soldiers be sent to arrest this evil demon, so that the sea and the mountains may be at peace, and the ocean may enjoy tranquillity. When the Jade Emperor had read this through he ordered, “Let the Dragon God return to the Sea; we shall send generals to arrest the demon.” The Old Dragon King bowed till his head touched the floor and took his leave. Then the Venerable Immortal Ge, a heavenly teacher, reported, “Your Majesty, the King of Qinguang, one of the ministers of the Underworld, has come with a memorial from the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha.” A jade girl messenger took the memorial, which the Jade Emperor read through. It ran:"
“娘，娘说得是，你请上坐，等我也拜几拜，就当拜堂，就当谢亲，两当一儿，却不省事？”他丈母笑道：“也罢，也罢，果然是个省事干家的女婿。我坐着，你拜么。”咦！满堂中银烛辉煌，这呆子朝上礼拜，拜毕道：“娘，你把那个姐姐配我哩？”他丈母道：“正是这些儿疑难：我要把大女儿配你，恐二女怪；要把二女配你，恐三女怪；欲将三女配你，又恐大女怪；所以终疑未定。”八戒道：“娘，既怕相争，都与我罢，省得闹闹吵吵，乱了家法。”他丈母道：“岂有此理！你一人就占我三个女儿不成！”八戒道：“你看娘说的话。那个没有三房四妾？就再多几个，你女婿也笑纳了。我幼年间，也曾学得个熬战之法，管情一个个伏侍得他欢喜。”那妇人道：“不好！不好！我这里有一方手帕，你顶在头上，遮了脸，撞个天婚，教我女儿从你跟前走过，你伸开手扯倒那个就把那个配了你罢。”呆子依言，接了手帕，顶在头上。有诗为证，诗曰：痴愚不识本原由，色剑伤身暗自休。从来信有周公礼，今日新郎顶盖头。那呆子顶裹停当，道：“娘，请姐姐们出来么。”他丈母叫：“真真、爱爱、怜怜，都来撞天婚，配与你女婿。”只听得环珮响亮，兰麝馨香，似有仙子来往，那呆子真个伸手去捞人。两边乱扑，左也撞不着，右也撞不着。来来往往，不知有多少女子行动，只是莫想捞着一个。东扑抱着柱科，西扑摸着板壁，两头跑晕了，立站不稳，只是打跌。前来蹬着门扇，后去汤着砖墙，磕磕撞撞，跌得嘴肿头青，坐在地下，喘气呼呼的道：“娘啊，你女儿这等乖滑得紧，捞不着一个，奈何！奈何！”那妇人与他揭了盖头道：“女婿，不是我女儿乖滑，他们大家谦让，不肯招你。”八戒道：“娘啊，既是他们不肯招我啊，你招了我罢。”那妇人道：“好女婿呀！这等没大没小的，连丈母也都要了！我这三个女儿，心性最巧，他一人结了一个珍珠篏锦汗衫儿。你若穿得那个的，就教那个招你罢。”八戒道：,"""Mother, mother is right, please sit up, wait for me to pray a few times, then you should be worshipping the church, and you should be thanking your relatives, and you will be a child. He's a son-in-law who saves his time. I'm sitting, do you worship."" Hey! The silver candles in the hall were full of brilliance, and the idiot bowed up and said, ""Mother, do you match that sister with me?"" His mother-in-law said, ""It is these problems: I want to match the eldest daughter to you, and I am afraid that the two girls will be strange. If you want to match two women with you, you will be afraid of three women; if you want to match three women with you, you will be afraid of the big girl; so it is uncertain."" Bajie said: ""Mother, if you are afraid of fighting, you will all be with me, so you don't have to make trouble. It's arguing and disrupting the family law."" His mother-in-law said, ""How unreasonable! You can't have three of my daughters alone!"" Bajie said, ""Look at what my mother said. That one doesn't have three bedrooms and four concubines? Just a few more. Your son-in-law also laughed. When I was young, I also learned a way to endure battles, and I was happy to serve each and every one."" The woman said, ""Not good! Not good! I have a handkerchief here. On your head, cover your face, hit the heavenly marriage, teach my daughter to walk past you, stretch out your hand and tear that one down and make that one match you."" The idiot Yiyan took the handkerchief and put it on his head. There is a poem as a proof, the poem says: I don't know the root cause, the color sword hurts the body and secretly rests. I have always believed in Zhou Gongli, but today the groom has his head covered. The idiot stopped and said, ""Mother, please come out, my sisters."" His mother-in-law called: ""Zhenzhen, love, love, pity, all come to marry and match your son-in-law."" Huan Pei was heard loudly , Lan Musk is fragrant, it seems that there are fairies coming and going, that idiot is really reaching out to find people. The two sides are fluttering, and the left can't hit, and the right can't hit. Come and go, I don't know how many women act, just don't want to catch one. Dongpu hugged Zhuke, and Xipu touched the board wall. He lost his mind when he ran away. He came to kick the door, and then went to the brick wall, knocking and bumping, his mouth was swollen, his head was swollen, he sat on the ground, panting and said: ""Mother, your daughter is so slippery that she can't catch it. One, Naihe! Naihe!"" The woman lifted her hijab with him and said, ""Son-in-law, it's not my daughter's sly, they are all humble and won't hire you."" Bajie said, ""Mother, since they won't hire me. , you recruit me."" The woman said: ""Good son-in-law! There is no big or small, even the mother-in-law! My three daughters have the most clever hearts, and he has a pearl brocade. T-shirt. If you wear that, I will teach that to recruit you."" Bajie said:","“You take the upper seat also, and let me bow to you a few times. We’ll consider that my worship of Heaven and Earth as well as my gesture of gratitude to you. Doing these two things at once will save me some trouble.” “All right, all right,” said his mother-in-law, laughing. “You are indeed a son-in-law who knows how to fulfill your household duties with the least effort. I’ll sit down, and you can make your bows.” The candles on silver candlesticks were shining brightly throughout the hall as Idiot made his bows. Afterwards he said, “Mama, which one of the dear sisters do you plan to give me?” “That’s my dilemma,” said his mother-in-law. “I was going to give you my eldest daughter, but I was afraid of offending my second daughter. I was going to give you my second daughter, but I was afraid then of offending my third daughter. And if I were to give you my third daughter, I fear that my eldest daughter may be offended. That’s why I cannot make up my mind.” “Mama,” said Eight Rules, “if you want to prevent strife, why not give them all to me? That way, you will spare yourself a lot of bickering that can destroy the harmony of the family.” “Nonsense!” said his mother-in-law. “You mean you alone want to take all three of my daughters?” “Listen to what you’re saying, Mama!” said Eight Rules. “Who doesn’t have three or four concubines nowadays? Even if you have a few more daughters, I’ll gladly take them all. When I was young, I learned how to be long-lasting in the arts of love. You can be assured that I’ll render satisfactory service to every one of them.” “That’s no good! That’s no good!” said the woman. “I have a large handkerchief here, with which you can cover your head, blindfold yourself, and determine your fated marriage that way. I’m going to ask my daughters to walk past you, and the one you can catch with your hands will be betrothed to you.” Idiot accepted her suggestion and covered his head with his handkerchief. We have a testimonial poem that says: The fool knows not the true causes of things; Beauty’s sword can in secret wound the self. The Duke of Zhou of old had fixed the rites. But a bridegroom today still veils his head! After Idiot had tied himself up properly, he said, “Mama, ask the dear sisters to come out.” “Zhenzhen, Aiai, Lianlian,” cried his mother-in-law, “you all come out and determine your fated marriage, so that one of you may be given to this man.” With the sounds of girdle-jade and the fragrance of orchids, it seemed that some immortal ladies had suddenly appeared. Idiot indeed stretched forth his hands to try to catch hold of one of the girls, but though he darted about madly this way and that, he could not lay hands on anyone on either side of him. It seemed to him, to be sure, that the girls were making all kinds of movement around him, but he could not grab a single one of them. He lunged toward the east and wrapped his arms around a pillar; he made a dive toward the west and slammed into a wooden partition. Growing faint from rushing about like that, he began to stumble and fall all over the place—tripping on the threshold in front of him, smashing into the brick wall behind him! Fumbling and tumbling around, he ended up sitting on the floor with a bruised head and a swollen mouth. “Mama,” he cried, panting heavily, “you have a bunch of slippery daughters! I can’t catch a single one of them! What am I to do? What am I to do?” Taking off his blindfold, the woman said, “Son-in-law, it’s not that my daughters are slippery ; it’s just that they are all very modest. Each defers to the other so that she may take you.” “If they are unwilling to take me, Mama,” said Eight Rules, “why don’t you take me instead?” “Dear son-in-law,” said the woman, “you really have no regard for age or youth, when you even want your mother-in-law! My three daughters are really quite talented, for each one of them has woven a silk undershirt studded with pearls. Try them on, and the one whose shirt fits you will take you in.”",,"Can this really be it? he wondered to himself. Iron-Fan now rubbed her powdered cheek against his face. “Put the fan away and have another drink,” she urged. “What are you thinking about?” Monkey decided to seize the moment. “How can such a tiny thing extinguish fire?” “Has that Jade-Face rotted your brain?” replied Iron-Fan, reckless from drink. “Surely you remember—twist the seventh red thread on the handle, chant the magic words ‘hui-xu-he-xi-xi-chui-hu,’ and it will grow twelve feet long and extinguish any blaze!” Carefully committing these instructions to memory, Monkey popped the fan into his mouth, then rubbed his face and revealed his true identity. “Recognize me now?” he yelled at Iron-Fan. She was so shocked and ashamed by her sudden realization of Monkey’s deception that she stumbled and fell, knocking over tables and chairs as she went. Completely indifferent to her distress, Monkey strode triumphantly out of the cave. He hopped onto a cloud that took him straight to the top of the mountain, where he spat out the fan and followed Iron-Fan’s usage instructions. The good news was that it was clearly different from the earlier fake one: it immediately grew to twelve feet and was enveloped in an auspicious light and propitious vapors. The bad news was that Monkey had not thought to learn the magic for shrinking the fan back again, so he had no choice but to haul the thing back on his shoulders. Meanwhile, Bull Demon was finally leaving his underwater banquet. Returning to the gateway, however, he discovered that his steed had vanished. “Who stole my water-repellent, golden-eyed beast?” he roared at the gathered spirits. “It wasn’t us!” they pleaded, falling to their knees. “We were all in the banqueting hall, singing, playing, and serving.” “Could an intruder have somehow got in?” wondered the dragon paterfamilias. “I do recall seeing an unfamiliar crab wandering about,” recalled one of his sons. “I think I can guess what happened,” Bull Demon said. “Before you invited me tonight, I was battling with Monkey, who wanted the Palm-Leaf Fan off me so that he could carry on his way west. He must have turned into a crab to follow me here, stolen my ride, and gone on to my wife’s place to finagle the fan off her.” “Not—not the Monkey who turned Heaven upside down?” the watery spirits said, trembling. “The very same,” Bull Demon confirmed. “I’d advise you to avoid the road to the west for the time being.” Parting the water, King Bull Demon leaped out of the pool, hopped onto a yellow cloud, and made for Palm-Leaf Cave on Jade-Cloud Mountain, where he found his first wife wailing and raging, and the golden-eyed beast tethered outside. “You bastard!” Iron-Fan screamed at him. “How could you let that monkey steal your golden-eyed beast and your identity and humiliate me like that?” “Where is he?” Bull Demon asked between gritted teeth. “That bastard ape tricked the fan off me, turned back into Monkey, and disappeared. I’m so angry I could die!” “Calm down. I’ll catch that monkey, get the fan back, then skin him, pulverize his bones, and gouge out his heart. Now, give me my weapons!” “You don’t keep your weapons here anymore,” the maids pointed out.","“You sit in the seat of honour and I'll bow to you a few times— that can be the wedding ceremony and thanking the bride's family rolled into one, which will save trouble.” “Very well then,” said the woman with a laugh. “You are a most capable and practical son-in-law. I'll sit here while you bow to me.” In the room glittering with silver candles the blockhead bowed to her, then asked which of the girls would be married to him. “That's the problem,” his mother-in-law said. “If I give you the eldest, the second one will be upset; and if I give you the second one, I'm afraid the third one will be; and if I give you the third, the eldest will be— so I haven't decided yet.” “If there's any danger of them quarrelling,” said Pig, “then give me all of them, to save the family from being troubled with arguments and squabbles.” “What a suggestion,” his mother-in-law exclaimed. “You're certainly not having all my daughters to yourself.” “Don't be silly, mother. What's unusual about three or four wives? Even if there were several more of them, I'd take them on with a smile. When I was young I learned the art of 'protracted warfare,' and I can guarantee to keep every one of them happy.” “No, no,” the woman said. “I have a handkerchief here. Tie it round your head to cover your face, and we can let Heaven decide which one you'll marry. I'll tell the girls to walk in front of you while you stretch your arms out. The one you catch, will be yours.” The blockhead obediently tied the handkerchief round his head, and there is a verse to prove it: The fool, not knowing his own fate, Was wounded by the sword of sex as he harmed himself in secret There have always been proper wedding rites, But today the groom blindfolded himself. When he had tied the handkerchief on firmly, the idiot said, “Mother, please ask the girls to come out.” “Zhenzhen, Aiai, Lianlian,” she called, “come out to see which of you Heaven will marry to my new son-in-law.” He heard the tinkling of jade ornaments and smelt rare perfumes as if fairies were there, so he reached out to grab one. He groped about to his left and his right, but without success. There were so many girls running about, and he had no chance of catching one. When he stretched East he only put his arms round a pillar, and when he stretched West he felt only the wall. As he rushed from one end of the room to the other he felt so dizzy that he lost his balance and kept tripping over. He stumbled into the door when he went forward, and collided with the brick wall when he went back, bumping, crashing and falling over till his snout was swollen and his head blue with bruises. Finally he sat on the floor and said as he gasped for breath, “Mother, your daughters are so slippery I can't catch a single one of them. Whatever shall I do?” “They're not slippery,” she said, taking off the handkerchief, “they're all too shy to marry you.” “If they won't marry me,” Pig said, “then you marry me.” “What a son-in-law!” she said. “He doesn't care whether they're young or old—he even wants his own mother-in-law. Now each of these clever girls of mine has made a brocade shirt sewn with pearls. I'll tell whichever girl it is whose shirt you put on to marry you.” “Great, great, great,” said Pig."

却说太宗与魏征在便殿对弈，一递一着，摆开阵势。正合《烂柯经》云：博弈之道，贵乎严谨。高者在腹，下者在边，中者在角，此棋家之常法。法曰：宁输一子，不失一先。击左则视右，攻后则瞻前。有先而后，有后而先。两生勿断，皆活勿连。阔不可太疏，密不可太促。与其恋子以求生，不若弃之而取胜；与其无事而独行，不若固之而自补。彼众我寡，先谋其生；我众彼寡，务张其势。善胜者不争，善阵者不战；善战者不败，善败者不乱。夫棋始以正合，终以奇胜。凡敌无事而自补者，有侵绝之意；弃小而不救者，有图大之心。随手而下者，无谋之人；不思而应者，取败之道。《诗》云：“惴惴小心，如临于谷。”此之谓也。诗曰，,"But it was said that Taizong and Wei Zheng played a game in the hall, and they set up a battle with one hand and one hand. It is exactly in line with the ""Lan Ke Jing"" cloud: the way of the game, the most precious is the rigorous. The taller is in the belly, the lower is on the side, and the middle is in the corner. This is a common practice for chess players. Fa said: It is better to lose a son than to lose a first. If you hit left, you will look right, and if you hit back, you will look forward. There is first and then, and there is last. The two lives should not be broken, and the two lives should not be connected. The width should not be too sparse, and the dense should not be too tight. It is better to give up and win than to love a child to survive; rather than to go alone with nothing to do, it is better to fix it and make up for it. If they are many and I am few, I will make a living first; if I am many and few, I will try to increase their power. Those who are good at victorious do not fight, those who are good in formation do not fight; those who are good in battle are not defeated, and those who are good at defeat are not in chaos. Chess starts with a perfect match and ends with an odd victory. Those who make up for themselves when the enemy has nothing to do, have the intention of encroaching on them; those who abandon the small and not save have the intention of seeking the big. Those who go down casually are those who do not have a plan; those who respond without thinking are the way to win or lose. ""Poem"" says: ""Be cautious and be careful, as if you are in a valley."" This is also called. The poem says,","After expressing his gratitude, Wei Zheng set out to play chess with the Tang emperor, both of them moving the pieces step by step into positions. It was completely in accordance with the instruction of the Classic of Chess: The way of chess exalts discipline and caution; the most powerful pieces should remain in the center, the weakest ones at the flanks, and the less powerful ones at the corners. This is a familiar law of the chess player. The law says: “You should rather lose a piece than an advantage. When you strike on the left, you must guard your right; when you attack in the rear, you must watch your front. Only when you have a secure front will you also have a rear, and only if you have a secure rear will you maintain your front. The two ends cannot be separated, and yet both must remain flexible and not be encumbered. Abroad formation should not be too loose, while a tight position should not be constricted. Rather than clinging on to save a single piece, it is better to sacrifice it in order to win; rather than moving without purpose, it is better to remain stationary in order to be self-supportive. When your adversary outnumbers you, your first concern is to survive; when you outnumber your adversary, you must strive to exploit your force. He who knows how to win will not prolong his fight; he who is a master of positions will not engage in direct combat; he who knows how to fight will not suffer defeat; and he who knows how to lose will not panic. For chess begins with proper engagement but ends in unexpected victory. If your enemy, even without being threatened, is bringing up his reinforcement, it is a sign of his intention to attack; if he deserts a small piece without trying to save it, he may be stalking a bigger piece. If he moves in a casual manner, he is a man without thoughts; response without thought is the way to defeat. The Classic of Poetry says: Approach with extreme caution As if facing a deep canyon. Such is the meaning thereof. The poem says:","But the Monkey transformed some willow trees into the likeness of the Master and his disciples, and in this way they escaped. They were caught again, and when the Monkey was beaten, he changed his legs into wrought iron. When about to be boiled in oil, he changed a stone lion into his form, to take his place. To be religious, one must have a keen edge to one’s ear. One must ever keep close to one’s conscience. Steel is hard, but steeled hearts are harder, The humble minded never is a fool. The abbot said to the Monkey, “You have presumed too far this time. There is a day of reckoning. I will go with you to the West and get back my mandrake tree from Buddha himself.” “Is that all? Why did you not tell me before? If you let my Master go, I will bring you a living tree.” The bargain was made, and the Monkey went in search of the Old Physician, who could make the dead live. He first went to the Islands of the Immortals and found three persons playing chess, the angels of the Star of Long Life, the Star of Happiness, and the Star of Wealth. On seeing the Monkey, one said, “Great Sage, you have left Taoism and now follow Buddhism. How is it you come to see us again? Have you stolen the root of immortality, the mandrake?","That morning, therefore, Wei Zheng had not gone to court, in order to bathe, to sharpen his magic sword for the impending execution, and to practice some calisthenics of the soul.","The best place is the middle of the board, The worst is the side, And the comers are neither good nor bad. This is the eternal law of chess. The law says: “It is better to lose a piece Than to lose the initiative. When you are struck on the left, look to the right, When attacked in the rear, keep an eye on your front. Sometimes the leader is really behind, Sometimes the laggard is really ahead. If you have two 'live' areas do not let them be severed; If you can survive as you are, do not link up. Do not spread yourself out too thinly, Do not crowd your pieces too closely. Rather than being niggardly with your pieces, Lose them and win the game. Rather than moving for no reason, It is better to strengthen your position. When he has many and you have few, Concentrate on survival; When you have many and he has few, Extend your positions. The one who is good at winning does not have to struggle; The one who draws up a good position does not have to fight; The one who fights well does not lose; The one who loses well is not thrown into confusion. Open your game with conventional gambits, And end by winning with surprise attacks. When the enemy strengthens himself for no apparent reason, He is planning to attack and cut you off. When he abandons small areas and does not rescue them His ambitions are great. The man who places his pieces at random Has no plans; The man who responds without thinking Is heading for defeat. The Book of Songs says: “Be cautious and careful As if you were walking on the edge of a precipice.' This is what it means.” There is a poem that goes:"
他轮枪舞剑，一拥前来，照行者劈头乱砍，乒乒乓乓，砍有七八十下。悟空停立中间，只当不知。那贼道：“好和尚！真个的头硬！”行者笑道：“将就看得过罢了！你们也打得手困了，却该老孙取出个针儿来耍耍。”那贼道：“这和尚是一个行针灸的郎中变的。我们又无病症，说甚么动针的话！”行者伸手去耳朵里拔出一根绣花针儿，迎风一幌，却是一条铁棒，足有碗来粗细，拿在手中道：“不要走！也让老孙打一棍儿试试手！”唬得这六个贼四散逃走，被他拽开步，团团赶上，一个个尽皆打死。剥了他的衣服，夺了他的盘缠，笑吟吟走将来道：“师父请行，那贼已被老孙剿了。”三藏道：“你十分撞祸！他虽是剪径的强徒，就是拿到官司，也不该死罪；你纵有手段，只可退他去便了，怎么就都打死？这却是无故伤人的性命，如何做得和尚？出家人扫地恐伤蝼蚁命，爱惜飞蛾纱罩灯。你怎么不分皂白，一顿打死？全无一点慈悲好善之心！早还是山野中无人查考；若到城市，倘有人一时冲撞了你，你也行凶，执着棍子，乱打伤人，我可做得白客，怎能脱身？”悟空道：“师父，我若不打死他，他却要打死你哩。”三藏道：“我这出家人，宁死决不敢行凶。我就死，也只是一身，你却杀了他六人，如何理说？此事若告到官，就是你老子做官，也说不过去。”行者道：“不瞒师父说，我老孙五百年前，据花果山称王为怪的时节，也不知打死多少人。假似你说这般到官，倒也得些状告是。”三藏道：“只因你没收没管，暴横人间，欺天诳上，才受这五百年前之难。今既入了沙门，若是还象当时行凶，一味伤生，去不得西天，做不得和尚！忒恶！忒恶！”原来这猴子一生受不得人气，他见三藏只管绪绪叨叨，按不住心头火发道：“你既是这等，说我做不得和尚，上不得西天，不必惩般绪咶恶我，我回去便了！”那三藏却不曾答应，他就使一个性子，将身一纵，说一声“老孙去也！”三藏急抬头，早已不见，只闻得呼的一声，回东而去。撇得那长老孤孤零零，点头自叹，悲怨不已，道：“这厮！这等不受教诲！我但说他几句，他怎么就无形无影的，径回去了？罢！罢！罢！也是我命里不该招徒弟，进人口！如今欲寻他无处寻，欲叫他叫不应，去来！,"He wheeled a gun and danced a sword, swarmed him, and slashed at the head, pinging ping ping ping pong, slashing seventy or eighty times. Wukong stopped in the middle, just pretending he didn't know. The thief said: ""Good monk! What a tough guy!"" The walker laughed and said, ""I'll see it soon! You guys are too tired, but it's time for the old grandson to take out a needle and play with it."" The thief said : ""This monk has changed from a monk who practiced acupuncture. We have no symptoms, so what are we talking about using acupuncture!"" The practitioner stretched out his hand and pulled out an embroidery needle from his ear. The bowl was thick and thin, and he held it in his hand and said, ""Don't go! Let Lao Sun try it out with a stick too!"" The six thieves fled in all directions. die. After stripping him of his clothes and snatching his entanglement, he walked into the future with a smile and said: ""Master, please go, that thief has been killed by the old sun."" Sanzang said: ""You are very troubled! Even if you get a lawsuit, you shouldn't be punished by death. Even if you have the means, you can only let him go, and you will be killed. This is the life of a person for no reason. How to be a monk? Cherish the moth gauze lamp. Why are you indiscriminate and killed in one go? There is no compassion or kindness at all! Long ago there was no one to investigate in the mountains; if you were in the city, if someone rammed you for a while, you would also commit murder, clinging to a stick How can I get away?” Wukong said, “Master, if I don’t kill him, he will kill you.” Sanzang said, “I’m a monk, I’d rather die. Never dare to commit murder. I will die, and I am only one body, but you have killed six of them. How can you justify it? If this matter is reported to an official, even if your father is an official, you can’t justify it.” The walker said: “I don’t hide it from the master. , my grandson five hundred years ago, according to the season when Huaguoshan called the king a strange, I don’t know how many people were killed. If you say that you are in office, you will have to sue.” Sanzang said: “Only It was because you confiscated and confiscated, that you bullied the world and deceived the world, and you only suffered the trouble of five hundred years ago. Now that you have entered the ascetic, if you still commit murder as you did back then, you will only hurt your life, you will not be able to go to the West, and you will not be able to become a monk! Evil! It's so evil!"" It turned out that this monkey couldn't bear popularity all his life, he saw that Sanzang was only concerned with his thoughts, and he couldn't hold back his anger and said: ""Since you are such a class, you say that I can't be a monk, and I can't go to the west, so I don't need to punish me. You hate me, I'll go back!"" Sanzang didn't agree, so he turned his head upside down, and said, ""Old grandson, go!"" Go back east. Leaving the elder alone, he nodded his head and sighed, filled with grief and resentment, and said: ""This fellow! This is not taught! I just said a few words to him, why did he go back without a trace? Stop! Stop! Forget it! It's also my life that I shouldn't recruit apprentices, get into the mouth! Now if you want to find him, there is nowhere to find him, and if you want to tell him to be unworthy, come and go!","Wielding spears and swords, they surrounded Pilgrim and hacked away at his head seventy or eighty times. Pilgrim stood in their midst and behaved as if nothing were happening. “What a monk!” said one of the robbers. “He really does have a hard head!” “Passably so!” said Pilgrim, laughing. “But your hands must be getting tired from all that exercise; it’s about time for old Monkey to take out his needle for a little entertainment.” “This monk must be an acupuncture man in disguise,” said the robber. “We’re not sick! What’s all this about using a needle?” Pilgrim reached into his ear and took out a tiny embroidery needle; one wave of it in the wind and it became an iron rod with the thickness of a rice bowl. He held it in his hands, saying, “Don’t run! Let old Monkey try his hand on you with this rod!” The six robbers fled in all directions, but with great strides he caught up with them and rounded all of them up. He beat every one of them to death, stripped them of their clothes, and seized their valuables. Then Pilgrim came back smiling broadly and said, “You may proceed now, Master. Those robbers have been exterminated by old Monkey.” “That’s a terrible thing you have done!” said Tripitaka. “They may have been strong men on the highway, but they would not have been sentenced to death even if they had been caught and tried. If you have such abilities, you should have chased them away. Why did you slay them all? How can you be a monk when you take life without cause? We who have left the family should Keep ants out of harm’s way when we sweep the floor, And put shades on lamps for the love of moths. How can you kill them just like that, without regard for black or white? You showed no mercy at all! It’s a good thing that we are here in the mountains, where any further investigation will be unlikely. But suppose someone offends you when we reach a city and you perpetrate violence again, hitting people indiscriminately with that rod of yours—would I be able to remain innocent and get away scot-free?” “Master,” said Wukong, “if I hadn’t killed them, they would have killed you!” Tripitaka said, “As a priest, I would rather die than practice violence. If I were killed, there would be only one of me, but you slaughtered six persons. How can you justify that? If this matter were brought before a judge, and even if your old man were the judge, you certainly would not be able to justify your action.” “To tell you the truth, Master,” said Pilgrim, “when I, old Monkey, was king on the Flower-Fruit Mountain five hundred years ago, I killed I don’t know how many people. I would not have been a Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, if I had lived by what you are saying.” “It’s precisely because you had neither scruples nor self-control,” said Tripitaka, “unleashing your waywardness on Earth and spreading outrage in Heaven, that you had to undergo this ordeal of five hundred years. Now that you have entered the fold of Buddhism, if you still insist on practicing violence and indulge in the taking of life as before, you are not worthy to be a monk, nor can you go to the Western Heaven. You’re wicked! You’re just too wicked!” Now this monkey had never in all his life been able to tolerate scolding. When he heard Tripitaka’s persistent reprimand, he could not suppress the flames leaping up in his heart. “If that’s what you think,” he said. “If you think I’m not worthy to be a monk, nor can I go to the Western Heaven, you needn’t bother me further with your nagging! I’ll leave and go back!” Before Tripitaka had time to reply, Pilgrim was already so enraged that he leaped into the air, crying only, “ Old Monkey’s off!” Tripitaka quickly raised his head to look, but the monkey had already disappeared, trailed only by a swishing sound fading fast toward the East. Left by himself, the priest could only shake his head and sigh, “That fellow! He’s so unwilling to be taught! I only said a few words to him. How could he vanish without a trace and go back just like that? Well, well, well! It must be also that I am destined not to have a disciple or any other companion, for now I couldn’t even call him or locate him if I wanted to.","I have one daughter named Baoying, who is just seven years of age. Being too young to understand human relations, how can she do the work of a witch? If you do not believe, I will have her carried out for you to see. This monkey is really outrageous in his charges. Remember too that I am of the celestial world, and am given power to execute any one, without memorializing for permission first. Even if I were one of the common people on the earth, I should not be falsely accused, for the law says a false charge should be punished threefold. Let my men bind this monkey!” Instantly the great generals in waiting came forward and bound Sun. The minister cried, “Guardian King Li, take care you do not get into trouble. We bring you a celestial edict. How can you order your officers to bind one who bears this edict?” The Guardian King said, “Tell me, Minister, how I should deal with a false charge like this. Please sit down. Let me get the sword with which I execute demons, and have this monkey beheaded, and then we can go together and report to the Jade Emperor.” When the minister saw the sword, he was really alarmed about Sun, but Sun, not in the least afraid, smiled and said quietly, “Do not be alarmed about me, I am accustomed to losing at first, but in the end I always win.” Before he had finished his sentence, the Guardian King raised his sword and was going to strike Sun. But before the stroke fell, Prince Nezha came forward and seizing the sword cried, “Father, do not be angry!” At this the father, instead of being more angry that his son should resist him, was alarmed. There was a reason for it. Prince Nezha had once gone to bathe in the sea, and got into trouble by going into the Dragon’s Crystal Palace, and seizing a dragon there, in order to make a bow string out of his muscles. When the Guardian King heard of it, he was afraid of future troubles, and wished to kill his son. The son became very angry, took a sword and cut off his flesh and gave it to his mother, and cut off his bones and returned them to his father. His soul departed and went to Paradise. Lord Buddha had just dismissed his pupils, to whom he had been preaching, when he heard a cry, “Murder, help, help!” Buddha knew it was Nezha. He gave him a new body, and read over him the magic words which give life to the dead, and Nezha was given a new life to rule over 96 demons, and with wonderful magic powers. He wished to kill his father for attempting to kill him. In these dire straits the Guardian King was obliged to beg for his own life. The Buddha gave him charge of a golden pagoda. That is why the Guardian King was also called Li the Pagoda Bearer. From then on Nezha came to regard Lord Buddha as his father, so as to end the strife between father and son. Guardian King Li said to Nezha, “Son, you have something to say.” This was the reason why the father showed no anger. Nezha went on his knees, kowtowed, and said, “Father, there is a daughter in the earthly world, whom you have forgotten, and she is a witch. Three hundred years ago she stole some fragrant candles from the Spiritual Hall. Lord Buddha sent you and me to arrest her, and by rights she should have been put to death then. But we spared her life, and she in gratitude worships you as her father, and honors me as brother, and that is the explanation of tablet and incense burner in her cave.” The king was astonished and said, “I had completely forgotten her. What is her name?” Nezha replied, “She has three names. Originally she was called Golden-nosed White Rat. On account of her fondness for fragrant incense she was called Half-of-a-Guanyin. Now she is called the Brave-Lady-of-the-Earth.” After hearing this, the Guardian King ordered Sun to be unbound. But Sun would not hear of it. “Carry me bound to the Jade Emperor, or if you will not carry me, I will roll myself into his presence.” At this the Guardian King became much alarmed.","Just to be on the safe side, Monkey confiscated the rake, turned one of his hairs into a rope with which to truss Stiff-Bristles, and dragged him back by the ear to Mr. Gao’s place. In an instant they were back in the village, where Mr. Gao and Tripitaka were overjoyed to see Monkey again. “That’s my son-in-law!” exclaimed Mr. Gao. The pig-monster fell to his knees before Tripitaka. “Forgive me, Master! If I’d only known that you were a guest of my father-in-law, I’d have paid my respects straightaway and we wouldn’t have had any of this unpleasantness.” “How did you get him to surrender?” Tripitaka asked Monkey. “You tell him, thickhead!” Monkey ordered Pigsy, whacking him with the handle of the rake, and the story tumbled out of the captive. Tripitaka immediately offered Guanyin a prayer of thanks and asked Monkey to untie their new disciple. With one shake of Monkey’s body, the rope fell off and returned to him as a hair. The pig-monster bowed again to Tripitaka, and then to Monkey, as the senior disciple. “I’ve been vegetarian since taking holy orders from Guanyin,” Pigsy told Tripitaka. “I trust you won’t mind if I start feasting on flesh again now that I’ve found you? “Out of the question!” exclaimed Tripitaka. After treating his guests to a decidedly vegetarian banquet, Mr. Gao produced a red lacquer tray heaped with two hundred ounces of gold and silver to thank Tripitaka and Monkey for solving his domestic problem. Tripitaka refused to accept it. “Wherever we go, we beg for food. We cannot accept money.” But Monkey gave a handful of the cash to Gao Cai, his original informant. “Thanks to you, we’ve gained a disciple. Take this—it’ll keep you in sandals for a bit. Save any other monsters you meet for me!” Pigsy was not prepared to be so austere. “You got a good few years of toil out of me,” he said to Mr. Gao. “Monkey here ripped my shirt last night and my shoes are in pieces. Cough up for replacements, will you?” His ex-father-in-law could not comply fast enough. Delighted with his fine new clothes, Pigsy began strutting around the courtyard. “Send my best to the in-laws! Look after the old wife! If the scripture thing doesn’t work out, I’ll come back to her.” “Stupid rice bucket!” fulminated Monkey. “Always wise to have a plan B,” justified Pigsy. “Stop wasting time,” chided Tripitaka. “We must be on our way.” Pigsy shouldered the bags on a carrying pole, Tripitaka mounted the horse, and Monkey led the way to the west, his iron staff across his shoulders. Chapter Eighteen Summer came—the air scorching, the pomegranates ripe, the cicadas noisy—and went. Monkey carped at Pigsy a good deal, mostly about Pigsy’s near-constant complaints of hunger (“We can’t all drink wind and burp mist like you,” Pigsy shot back), and Tripitaka needed rescuing from the Magic Mink of Yellow-Wind Cave. Before they knew it, it was autumn again; the now-chilly cicadas chirped on wilting willows and the sun rose lower in the sky. The pilgrims presently encountered a vast, turbulent river. “Why is there no ferry to take us across?” asked an alarmed Tripitaka. “It’s too choppy for boats,” observed Pigsy. Monkey leaped into the air to scope out the situation. “This isn’t going to be easy,” he admitted. “It’s at least eight hundred miles wide. Though I can cross the river in a fraction of a cloud-somersault, that’s not an option for you, Master.” Heaving an anxious sigh, Tripitaka spotted a stone slab on the riverbank. The three of them gathered around to read it: the river of flowing sand: eight hundred miles wide, three thousand deep. everything—even feathers and petals—sinks. As they processed this discouraging information, the river billowed into mountainous waves, and an appallingly ugly monster—wild red hair, burning eyes, bluish face, thunderclap roar, and a truly intimidating stave—surged out of the spray.","Waving their spears and swords they rushed him, hacking wildly at his face. Seventy or eighty blows crashed down on him, but he simply stood in the middle of them, ignoring everything. “What a monk!” the bandits said. “He's a real tough nut.” “I think we've seen enough of that,” said Brother Monkey with a smile. “Your hands must be tired after all that bashing. Now it's my turn to bring out my needle for a bit of fun.” “This monk must have been an acupuncturist,” said the bandits. “There's nothing wrong with us. Why is he talking about needles?” Taking the embroidery needle from his ear, Brother Monkey shook it in the wind, at which it became an iron cudgel as thick as a ricebowl. With this in his hand he said, “Stick around while I try my cudgel out.” The terrified bandits tried to flee in all directions, but Monkey raced after them, caught them all up, and killed every one of them. Then he stripped the clothes off them, took their money, and went back with his face wreathed in smiles. “Let's go, master; I've wiped those bandits out,” he said. “Even though they were highwaymen, you're really asking for trouble,” Sanzang replied. “Even if they had been arrested and handed over to the authorities, they wouldn't have been sentenced to death. You may know a few tricks, but it would be better if you'd simply driven them away. Why did you have to kill them all? Even taking a man's life by accident is enough to stop someone from becoming a monk. A person who enters the religious life Spares the ants when he sweeps the floor, Covers the lamps to save the moth. What business did you have to slaughter the lot of them, without caring which of them were the guilty and which were innocent? You haven't a shred of compassion or goodness in you. This time it happened in the wilds, where nobody will be able to trace the crime. Say someone offended you in a city and you turned murderous there. Say you killed and wounded people when you went berserk with that club of yours. I myself would be involved even though I'm quite innocent.” “But if I hadn't killed them, they'd have killed you, master,” protested Sun Wukong. “I am a man of religion, and I would rather die than commit murder,” said Sanzang. “If I'd died, there'd only have been me dead, but you killed six of them, which was an absolute outrage. If the case were taken to court, you couldn't talk your way out of this even if the judge were your own father.” “To tell you the truth, master, I don't know how many people I killed when I was the monster who ruled the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit,” said Sun Wukong, “but if I'd acted your way I'd never have become the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.” “It was precisely because you acted with such tyrannical cruelty among mortals and committed the most desperate crimes against Heaven that you got into trouble five hundred years ago,” retorted Sanzang. “But now you have entered the faith, you'll never reach the Western Heaven and never become a monk if you don't give up your taste for murder. You're too evil, too evil.” Monkey, who had never let himself be put upon, flared up at Sanzang's endless nagging. “If you say that I'll never become a monk and won't ever reach the Western Heaven, then stop going on at me like that. I'm going back.” Before Sanzang could reply, Monkey leapt up in a fury, shouting, “I'm off.” Sanzang looked up quickly, but he was already out of sight. All that could be heard was a whistling sound coming from the East. Left on his own, the Priest nodded and sighed to himself with great sadness and indignation. “The incorrigible wretch,” he reflected. “Fancy disappearing and going back home like that just because I gave him a bit of a telling-off. So that's that. I must be fated to have no disciples or followers. I couldn't find him now even if I wanted to, and he wouldn't answer if I called him."
好太子，双手轮着铁棍，束一束绣衣，跳出辕门，高叫：“那个是齐天大圣？”大圣挺如意棒，应声道：“老孙便是。你是甚人，辄敢问我？”木叉道：“吾乃李天王第二太子叉，今在观音菩萨宝座前为徒弟护教，法名惠岸是也。”大圣道：“你不在南海修行，却来此见我做甚？”木叉道：“我蒙师父差来打探军情，见你这般猖獗，特来擒你！”大圣道：“你敢说那等大话！且休走！吃老孙这一棒！”木叉全然不惧，使铁棒劈手相迎。他两个立那半山中，辕门外，这场好斗：,"The good prince, with iron rods in both hands, bundled a bunch of embroidered clothes, jumped out of the gate, and shouted: ""That is the great sage Equalling the sky?"" How dare you ask me?"" Mu Cha said: ""I am the second prince of Li Tianwang, and now I am protecting my disciples in front of the throne of Guanyin Bodhisattva. The Dharma name is Hui'an."" The Great Sage said, ""You are not practicing in the South China Sea. But what are you doing here to see me?"" Mu Cha said: ""I was sent by Master to inquire about the military situation. Seeing that you are so rampant, I came here to arrest you!"" The Great Sage said: ""You dare to say such big things! Don't go! Eat Lao Sun's stick!"" Mu Cha was not afraid at all, and made the iron stick to meet him. The two of them stood in the middle of the mountain, outside the gate, this fight:","Dear prince! Grasping the iron rod with both hands, he tightened up his embroidered garment and leaped out of the gate. “Who is the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven?” he cried. Holding high his compliant rod, the Great Sage answered, “None other than old Monkey here! Who are you that you dare question me?” “I am Mokṣa, the second prince of Devarāja Li,” said Mokssa. “At present I am also the disciple of Bodhisattva Guanyin, a defender of the faith before her treasure throne. And my religious name is Hui’an.” “Why have you left your religious training at South Sea and come here to see me?” said the Great Sage. “I was sent by my master to inquire about the military situation,” said Mokṣa. “Seeing what a nuisance you have made of yourself, I have come specifically to capture you.” “You dare to talk so big?” said the Great Sage. “But don’t run away! Have a taste of old Monkey’s rod!” Mokṣa was not at all frightened and met his opponent squarely with his own iron rod. The two of them stood before the gate of the camp at mid-mountain, and what a magnificent battle they fought!","The son seized his iron staff, jumped outside the gate and shouted out, “Which is the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven?” The Great Sage replied, “Who are you that dares to ask me?” Mucha said, “I am the second son of Guardian King Li, my Buddhist name is Hui Yan and I am a disciple of Guanyin.” The Great Sage said, “Why do you come here instead of practicing religion at your home in the Southern Ocean?” Mucha replied, “I have been sent by my teacher to enquire about the war, and to see that these ferocious monkeys are captured.” The Great Sage said, “How dare you talk like this to me? Wait till you have a taste of my club.” Mucha took his iron staff to meet him, and there on the side of the mountain, outside the camp, the two fought several bouts with each other.","Cinching his embroidered robe and grasping an iron staff, Hui’an leaped out of the camp. “Where is this Great Sage Equal to Heaven?” he hollered. “None other,” replied Monkey, raising his own staff. “Who dares ask?” “I am Hui’an, the second son of King Li, senior disciple of the Bodhisattva Guanyin of the South Sea.” “What are you doing here?” “Guanyin sent me to find out what was going on. Given what a nuisance you’ve been, I’ve decided to arrest you.” “Big talk from a little squirt,” responded the Great Sage. “But don’t leave just yet. I want to introduce you to this staff of mine.” The two of them fought like whirlwinds until eventually Hui’an’s arms and shoulders began to ache.","The splendid Prince Moksa hitched up his embroidered robes and charged out through the gates of the headquarters waving his iron staff with both hands. “Which of you is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven?” he shouted. “I am,” answered the Great Sage, brandishing his As-You-Will cudgel. “But who do you think you are, asking a question like that?” “I am Prince Moksa, the second son of Heavenly King Li, and I am now a disciple and a guard before the throne of the Bodhisattva Guanyin. My Buddhist name is Huian.” “Why have you come here to see me instead of staying in the Southern Sea and cultivating your conduct?” asked the Great Sage, and Moksa replied, “My teacher sent me here to find out about the military situation, but now that I've seen your savagery I've come to capture you.” “You talk big, don't you,” said the Great Sage. “Well then, don't go away, try a taste of my cudgel.” Moksa, not in the least frightened, struck at him with his iron staff. It was a fine fight they fought, half-way up the mountainside outside the gates of the headquarters."
佛衣会做不成了！门外有一个毛脸雷公嘴的和尚，来讨袈裟哩！”那黑汉被行者在芳草坡前赶将来，却才关了门，坐还未稳，又听得那话，心中暗想道：“这厮不知是那里来的，这般无礼，他敢嚷上我的门来！”教：“取披挂！”随结束了，绰一杆黑缨枪，走出门来。这行者闪在门外，执着铁棒，睁睛观看，只见那怪果生得凶险：碗子铁盔火漆光，乌金铠甲亮辉煌。皂罗袍罩风兜袖，黑绿丝绦軃穗长。手执黑缨枪一杆，足踏乌皮靴一双。,"Buddha clothes can not be done! There is a monk with a hairy face and Lei Gongzui outside the door, coming to ask for a cassock! ""The black man was chased by the walker in front of Fangcao Slope, but he closed the door, and he was still unsteady. Hearing those words, he thought to himself: ""I don't know where this fellow came from, so rude, How dare he yell at my door! ""Teach: ""Take the mantle! ""As soon as it was over, he grabbed a black tassel spear and walked out the door. This traveler dodged outside the door, clinging to the iron rod, and watching with his eyes open, he saw that the strange fruit was dangerous: the iron helmet of the bowl was brightly painted, and the armor of black gold was shining brilliantly. .

There’s a monk with a hairy face and a thunder-god mouth outside demanding the cassock.” That swarthy fellow, after being chased by Pilgrim from the grass meadow, had just managed to reach the cave. He had not even been able to sit down when he again heard this announcement, and he thought to himself: “I wonder where this fellow came from, so arrogant that he dared show up making demands at my door!” He asked for his armor, and, after putting it on, he walked outside holding a lance with black tassels. Pilgrim stood on one side of the gate, holding his iron rod and glaring. The monster indeed cut a formidable figure: A bowl-like helmet of dark burnished steel; A black-gold cuirass that shone most bright. A black silk robe with wide wind-bagging sleeves, And dark green sashes with long, long tassels. He held in his hands a black-tasseled lance. He wore on his feet two black-leather boots.",,"Pigsy shouted down to the horrified courtiers. Still sleeping off the wine in the Hall of Silver Peace, the monster blearily heard someone calling his name. He rolled over and saw Pigsy and Sandy hovering above the clouds and hollering about his sons. Isn’t Sandy meant to be tied up at home? How have those two got hold of my boys? Are they spoiling for a fight? I’ve a beast of a hangover, though, and my battling mightn’t be up to scratch. I’ll head home first, find out whether those really were my boys, then settle with them. Back he went without even a word of farewell to the king. By this point the court knew full well that he was a monster.","The junior devil rushed in and reported, “The 'Buddha's Robe Banquet' is off, Your Majesty. There's hairy-faced thunder god outside the gates who's demanding the cassock.” The dark fellow, who had barely had time to shut the gates and had not even sat down properly since Brother Monkey chased him, away from the grassy slope, thought on hearing this news, “This wretch has come from I don't know where, and now he has the effrontery to come yelling at my gates.” He called for his armour, tightened his belt, and strode out of the gates with a black-tasseled spear in his hands. Monkey appeared outside the gates holding his iron cudgel and glaring wide-eyed at that ferocious-looking monster. His bowl-shaped iron helmet shone like fire; His black bronze armour gleamed. A black silk gown with billowing sleeves, A dark green silken sash with fringes. In his hands a spear with black tassels, On his feet a pair of dark leather boots."
只怕他暗地里撺将出来，却不又连我都害了？那时节人马两亡，怎生是好！”行者闻得这话，越加嗔怒，就叫喊如雷道：“你忒不济！不济！又要马骑，又不放我去，似这般看着行李，坐到老罢！”哏哏的吆喝，正难息怒，只听得空中有人言语，叫道：,"I'm afraid that he will come out secretly, but he will not even harm me? At that time, when both people and horses died, how could it be good to live! When the walker heard this, he became more and more angry, and shouted like thunder: ""You are so bad!"" Not bad! He wants to ride a horse again, but he doesn't let me go, looks at his luggage like this, and sits till he gets old! ” He shouted loudly, and it was hard to let go of his anger, only to hear someone speaking in the air, shouting:","Wouldn’t I be hurt if he should appear from somewhere after you are gone? How would it be then if both man and horse should perish?” At these words, Pilgrim became even more enraged. “You’re a weakling! Truly a weakling!” he thundered. “You want a horse to ride on, and yet you won’t let me go. You want to sit here and grow old, watching our bags?” As he was yelling angrily like this, he heard someone calling out in midair: “Great Sage Sun, don’t be annoyed.","Officials acknowledged me as the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven. I met the spirits of heaven daily, and we sang together in the most sacred places. But, because I spoilt the peach banquet, and greatly disturbed the Heavenly Court, I was arrested and subdued by Buddha, and imprisoned under Nature’s mountain. When hungry, I had only iron rust to eat, and when thirsty I was given only copper syrup to drink. For 500 years I never tasted tea or food. Happily, when my Master came from the East to go to the West, Guanyin taught me how to avert the punishment of Heaven by repentance, and rescued me from my terrible distress.","In her left hand she carried a blue sandstone pot and in her right a green porcelain vase. She then set her course directly for the travelers. And as soon as she came into view, Tripitaka could not take his eyes off her. “Monkey said the mountain was uninhabited. But this looks remarkably like a human being approaching.”","“I'm frightened that he'll come creeping out again and kill me this time. Then I'll be dead as well as the horse, and that would be terrible.” This made Monkey angrier than ever, and he roared with a shout like thunder, “You're hopeless, absolutely hopeless. You want a horse to ride but you won't let me go. This way you'll be sitting there looking at the luggage for the rest of your life.” As he was yelling ferociously in a flaming temper, a voice was heard in the sky that said, “Don't be angry, Great Sage; stop crying, younger brother of the Tang Emperor."
行者道：“且见师父去。”,"The walker said, ""Let's see Master go.""","“Let’s go talk to Master,” said Pilgrim.",,"“Dearest disciples, I’m so glad to see you!”","“Let's go and see the master,” Monkey said."
“孙大圣莫恼，唐御弟休哭。我等是观音菩萨差来的一路神祇，特来暗中保取经者。”那长老闻言，慌忙礼拜。行者道：“你等是那几个？可报名来，我好点卯。”众神道：“我等是六丁六甲、五方揭谛、四值功曹、一十八位护教伽蓝，各各轮流值日听候。”,"""Don't worry about Dasheng Sun, don't cry, brother of Tang Yu. We are all the gods sent by Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, and I came here to secretly protect the scriptures."" The elder heard the words and hurriedly prayed. The walker said: ""Who are you waiting for? You can sign up, I am better."" The gods said: ""I am waiting for the six Dings and six Jias, the five-party Jieti, the four-value meritorious officers, and the eighteen guards Jialan. Everyone takes turns on duty.""","And stop crying, Royal Brother of Tang. We are a band of deities sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin to give secret protection to the scripture pilgrim.” Hearing this, the priest hastily bowed to the ground. “Which divinities are you?” asked Pilgrim. “Tell me your names, so that I can check you off the roll.” “We are the Six Gods of Darkness and the Six Gods of Light,” they said, “the Guardians of Five Points, the Four Sentinels, and the Eighteen Protectors of Monasteries. Every one of us waits upon you in rotation.”","I was named the Seeker of Secrets, and I am also known as Sun Wukong, Aware of Emptiness. The king was greatly astonished, then came down from his throne and congratulated the Master, rejoicing in the great providence which had brought them together. The second disciple then spoke: “My name is Zhu Bajie. In a former life, I was a man fond of pleasure and idleness, and I was stupid all my life.","“You stay here with Sandy,” Pigsy told him. “I’ll investigate.” He set down his rake, straightened his shirt, and sauntered over, trying his best to look debonair. The “girl” was even more gorgeous close up: porcelain skin, flawless bone structure, almond eyes, gently curvaceous. The mere sight of her scrambled the lustful Pigsy’s brain. “Beautiful lady!” he babbled. “Where are you going and what are you carrying?”","As he was yelling ferociously in a flaming temper, a voice was heard in the sky that said, “Don't be angry, Great Sage; stop crying, younger brother of the Tang Emperor. We are gods sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin to give hidden protection to the pilgrim who is fetching the scriptures.” At these words Sanzang immediately bowed, but Monkey said, “Tell me your names, you lot.” “We are the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions, the Four Duty Gods, and the Eighteen Protectors of the Faith; we shall take it in turns to be in attendance every day.”"
却说那和尚把袈裟骗到手，拿在后房灯下，对袈裟号啕痛哭，慌得那本寺僧，不敢先睡。小幸童也不知为何，却去报与众僧道：“公公哭到二更时候，还不歇声。”有两个徒孙，是他心爱之人，上前问道：“师公，你哭怎的？”老僧道：“我哭无缘，看不得唐僧宝贝！”小和尚道：“公公年纪高大，发过了他的袈裟，放在你面前，你只消解开看便罢了，何须痛哭？”老僧道：“看的不长久。我今年二百七十岁，空挣了几百件袈裟，怎么得有他这一件？怎么得做个唐僧？”小和尚道：“师公差了。唐僧乃是离乡背井的一个行脚僧。你这等年高，享用也彀了，倒要象他做行脚僧，何也？”老僧道：“我虽是坐家自在，乐乎晚景，却不得他这袈裟穿穿。若教我穿得一日儿，就死也闭眼，也是我来阳世间为僧一场！”众僧道：“好没正经！你要穿他的，有何难处？,"But he said that the monk tricked the cassock into his hands, held it under the lamp in the back room, and cried bitterly at the cassock, so panicked that the monk of the temple did not dare to sleep first. Xiao Xingtong didn't know why, but went to report to the monks and said, ""My father-in-law cried until the second watch, and he didn't stop."" Two of his disciples and grandchildren, who were his beloved ones, stepped forward and asked, ""Master, are you crying? What's wrong?"" The old monk said: ""I'm crying for no reason, I can't see the treasure of Tang monk!"" The young monk said: ""The father-in-law is very old, he has given his robe and put it in front of you, you can just take it off and look at it, why cry The old monk said: ""I can't see it for a long time. I am two hundred and seventy years old this year, and I have earned hundreds of cassocks for nothing. How can I have this one? How can I be a Tang monk?"" The little monk said: ""Master tolerance The Tang monk is a walking monk who is far away from his hometown. You are so old and you have enough to enjoy, but you want to be a walking monk like him, why?"" The old monk said: ""Although I am sitting at home and enjoying the evening scenery, But he is not allowed to wear this cassock. If you teach me to wear it for a day, I will die and close my eyes, and I will come to the world to be a monk!"" The monks said: ""It's not serious! You want to wear him, there are What is the difficulty?","We shall now tell you about the old monk, who had got hold of the cassock by fraud. He took it beneath the lamps in the back room and sat in front of it, bawling. The chief priest of the monastery was so startled that he dared not retire first. The young cleric, not knowing the reason for the weeping, went to report to the other monks, saying, “The aged father has been crying, and it’s now the second watch and he still hasn’t stopped.” Two grand disciples, who were his favorites, went forward to ask him, “Grand master, why are you crying?” “I’m crying over my ill luck,” replied the old monk, “for I cannot look at the treasure of the Tang Monk.” One of the little monks said, “The aged father is becoming a little senile! The cassock is placed right before you. All you have to do is to untie the package and look at it. Why do you have to cry?” “But I can’t look at it for long,” said the old monk. “I’m two hundred and seventy years old, and yet I have bargained in vain for those several hundred cassocks. What must I do to acquire that one cassock of his? How can I become the Tang Monk himself?” “The grand master is erring,” said the little monk. “The Tang Monk is a mendicant who had to leave his home and country. You are enjoying the benefits of old age here, and that should be sufficient. Why do you want to be a mendicant like him?” The old monk said, “Though I’m relaxing at home and enjoying my declining years, I have no cassock like his to put on. If I can put it on for just one day, I’ll die with my eyes shut, for then I shall not have been a monk in vain in this World of Light.” “What nonsense!” said another monk. “If you want to put it on, what’s so difficult about that?",,"the sentry goblins reported to Yellow-Robe. “Big Snout and Sulky Chops have broken our door down.” “What are they doing back here?” he wondered. “Didn’t I just spare their master?” “Maybe,” speculated one of the imps, “they forgot something and have come to pick it up.” “Nonsense!” snorted the monster. “Why would they smash the door just to pick up lost property? No, there’s something else behind this.” Grabbing his armor and sword, he strode out to confront them. “What is it now?” “So—kidnap the princess of Precious Image and force her to be your wife, would you?” roared Pigsy. “I’m on a royal mission to capture you. Save me some trouble and tie yourself up, would you?” Utterly enraged by this little speech, Yellow-Robe brought his sword down as hard as he could on Pigsy’s head. Pigsy fought back with his rake, assisted by Sandy. But after fewer than ten clashes, Pigsy was so exhausted that he could barely lift his weapon. During their first battle, Pigsy and Sandy had only managed to fight Yellow-Robe to a stalemate due to the presence of Guanyin’s guardian spirits, who’d been there to protect Tripitaka. Now, of course, they were all watching over Tripitaka in Precious Image, and so Yellow-Robe soon bested the two disciples. “Need the toilet,” Pigsy told Sandy. “You carry on.”","After the old monk had tricked them into giving him the cassock, he held it under the lamp in the back room as he wept and wailed over it. This so alarmed the monks that none of them dared go to sleep before he did. The young page, not knowing what to do, went to tell the other monks, “Grandad's still crying although it's getting on for eleven.” Two junior monks, who were among the old man's favorites, went over to ask him why he was crying. “I'm crying because my accursed fate won't allow me to see the Tang Priest's treasure,” he said; to which they replied, “Grandad, in your old age you have succeeded. His cassock is laid before you, and all you have to do is open your eyes and look. There's no need for tears.” “But I can't look at it for long,” the aged monk answered. “I'm two hundred and seventy this year, and I've collected all those hundreds of cassocks for nothing. However am I to get hold of that one of his? However am I to become like the Tang priest?” “Master, you've got it all wrong,” the junior monks said. “The Tang Priest is a pilgrim far from home. You should be satisfied with your great seniority and wealth; why ever would you want to be a pilgrim like him?” “Although I live at home and enjoy my declining years, I've got no cassock like his to wear,” the aged monk replied. “If I could wear it for a day, I would close my eyes in peace. I'd be as happy as if I were a monk in my next life.” “What nonsense,” the junior monks said. “If you want to wear his cassock, there'll be no problem about that."

Thus vice and virtue will at last be paid: It differs only in coming soon or late.” When Taizong heard these words, he was terror-stricken.","Those two demons used to look after my gold crucible, but they stole my magic treasures, and ran away to the world of human beings. Fortunately you have caught them, and deserve great reward.” But Sun replied, “You should be severely punished for letting your servants do this evil in the world.’” The Ancient of Days said, “No, without these various trials, your Master and his disciples could never gain perfection of character!” Then Sun understood and said, “Since you have come yourself for the magic treasures, I shall return them to you.” After receiving them, the Ancient of Days and his two servants went away, one on his right and the other on his left, and returned to the Polar Star Mansion again. 13","There’s tongue-pulling, skin-shredding—and -peeling, for those gluttons for punishment out there—bone-exposing, tendon-severing, freezing, pounding, crushing, grinding, mutilation, evisceration, boiling oil, and of course oodles of blood. Does that answer your question?” Taizong was too horrified to speak.","The Hell of the Pool of Blood, the Avichi Hell, the Hell of the Steelyard Beam, Where skin is pulled away from the bone, Arms are broken and tendons cut. Because they killed for gain, Butchering living creatures, They fell into these torments that will not end in a thousand years; They will always lie here, never to escape. Every one of them is tightly bound, Knotted and roped. Red-faced demons, And black-faced demons, Are sent with their long halberds and short swords. Ox-headed fiends. And horse-faced fiends, With iron clubs and brazen hammers, Beat them till their wincing faces flow with blood, As they call on Heaven and Earth and get no answer. Let no man alive have any illusions: The devils carry out their orders and release nobody. Good and evil will always be rewarded: It is only a question of time.”"
“适间小的们说东土唐朝来的老爷，我才出来奉见。”三藏道：,"""The young people said that the master from the Tang Dynasty came from the East, and I came out to see it."" Sanzang said:","“Just now I heard the little ones announcing,” said the old monk, “that venerable fathers from the Tang court have arrived from the east. I came out specifically to meet you.” “Without knowing any better,” said Tripitaka, “we intruded into your esteemed temple.",,the courtiers exclaimed at Tripitaka’s elaborate rituals of homage to the king.,"“The youngsters have just told me that gentlemen have come from the Tang Empire in the East,” he said, “so I have come out to see you.” “Please forgive us for blundering into your monastery so rudely,” Sanzang replied."
洞里乾坤任自由，壶中日月随成就。遨游四海乐清闲，散淡十洲容辐辏。,"The universe in the cave is free, and the sun and the moon in the pot follow the achievements. Traveling around the world is leisurely and leisurely, and the ten continents are scattered.","Sky and earth in his cave knew no constraint. Sun and moon were perfected in his vase.16 He roamed the Four Seas in joy serene, And made the Ten Islets17 his tranquil home.","After paying his respects, he was told to go and see Lord Buddha, to whom he said, “When we first heard that the Monkey Demon had been taken by the Ancient of Days to the Polar Star Mansion and had his dross burnt there, we thought all trouble was at an end and little expected it would break forth again.","There were divine dancing girls, there were zithers, there were gifts (including two pears and an auspicious purple fungus), and many, many toasts.","In his cave Heaven and Earth are free. In his bottle Sun and Moon were created. As he wanders around the Four Seas in pure idleness Taking his ease in the Ten Continents, enjoying the bustle."

The iron rods are distracted and pounded, and the nails are drilled to meet them. Sowing the soil and raising the dust, the sky and the earth are dark, and the flying sand and the stone are frightening. Nine-toothed palladium, radiant, double rings are loud; This is the Prince of Heaven, and that is the Marshal Spirit. One is a Dharma protector in Putuo, and the other is a fairy in a cave. In this encounter, it's a competition, and I don't know which one wins or loses.","The monster is fierce. Hui’an is powerful. The iron rod jabs at the heart; The muckrake swipes at the face. Spraying mud and splattering dust darken Heaven and Earth; Flying sand and hurling rocks scare demons and gods. The nine-teeth rake, All burnished, Loudly jingles with double rings; The single rod, Black throughout, Leaps and flies in both hands. This one is the prince of a Devarāja; That one is the spirit of a grand marshal. This one defends the faith at Potalaka; That one lives in a cave as a monster. Meeting this time they rush to fight, Not knowing who shall lose and who shall win.","He has been kind to my descendants. Since I have received this letter about you today, you can set your mind at rest. I, your humble minister, shall not fail to have you restored to the land of the living, and to your throne again.” The emperor thanked him. As they were talking, two young men dressed in black approached them. They were carrying official umbrellas and streamers, and called out with a loud voice, “Yama the King of Hell invites you in.”","A tremendous, if messy, battle began, with mud, dust, sand, and rocks spraying everywhere. At the climax of the struggle, Guanyin dropped some lotus flowers between them.","Huian, imposing and able. The iron staff could pulverize the heart; The rake struck at the face. The dust thrown up darkened Heaven and Earth; The flying sand and stones startled gods and ghouls. The nine-toothed rake Gleamed and flashed As its pair of rings resounded; The lone staff Was ominously black As it whirled in its owner's hands. One was the heir of a Heavenly King, One defended the Law on Potaraka Island. The other was an evil fiend in a mountain cave. In their battle for mastery, None knew who the winner would be."

The judge ordered to go forward and led Taizong to pass over the Golden Bridge.","“The Guards of the Bridges have come to receive you,” they said. The judge ordered them to make way and proceeded to lead Taizong across a golden bridge.","THEY HAD NOT TRAVELED FAR before the Master cried out, “There is a mountain of difficulties ahead of us, we must be careful.” The Monkey said, “Master, do not be over anxious. So long as our hearts are upright, there cannot be any serious trouble.”","They now came to three parallel bridges. The first, made of gold, they led Taizong over.","Before they had gone much further a group of devil soldiers holding banners knelt down beside the road and said, “The Commissioners of the Bridges welcome you.” The Judge shouted to them that they were to rise and led Taizong across a golden bridge."
三藏夸赞不尽，道：“太保真山神也！”伯钦道：“有何本事，敢劳过奖？这个是长老的洪福。去来！赶早儿剥了皮，煮些肉，管待你也。”他一只手执着叉，一只手拖着虎，在前引路。三藏牵着马，随后而行，迤逶行过山坡，忽见一座山庄。那门前真个是：参天古树，漫路荒藤。万壑风尘冷，千崖气象奇。一径野花香袭体，数竿幽竹绿依依。草门楼，篱笆院，堪描堪画；石板桥，白土壁，真乐真稀。秋容萧索，爽气孤高。道旁黄叶落，岭上白云飘。疏林内山禽聒聒，庄门外细犬嘹嘹。伯钦到了门首，将死虎掷下，叫：“小的们何在？”只见走出三四个家僮，都是怪形恶相之类，上前拖拖拉拉，把只虎扛将进去。伯钦吩咐教：“赶早剥了皮，安排将来待客。”复回头迎接三藏进内。彼此相见，三藏又拜谢伯钦厚恩怜悯救命，伯钦道：“同乡之人，何劳致谢。”坐定茶罢，有一老妪，领着一个媳妇，对三藏进礼。伯钦道：“此是家母、山妻。”三藏道：“请令堂上坐，贫僧奉拜。”老妪道：“长老远客，各请自珍，不劳拜罢。”伯钦道：“母亲呵，他是唐王驾下差往西天见佛求经者。适间在岭头上遇着孩儿，孩儿念一国之人，请他来家歇马，明日送他上路。”老妪闻言，十分欢喜道：“好！好！好！就是请他，不得这般，恰好明日你父亲周忌，就浼长老做些好事，念卷经文，到后日送他去罢。”这刘伯钦，虽是一个杀虎手，镇山的太保，他却有些孝顺之心，闻得母言，就要安排香纸，留住三藏。,"Sanzang was full of praise, and said, ""It's too true to the mountain god!"" Bo Qin said, ""What's the skill, dare to work hard for a reward? This is the elder's Hongfu. Come on! Peel the skin early, cook some meat, and take care of you. ."" He held the fork in one hand and dragged the tiger in the other, leading the way. Sanzang led the horse, followed by walking, walking across the hillside, and suddenly saw a villa. The real one in front of the door is: towering ancient trees and wild vines on the road. The wind and dust are cold in Wanhe, and the weather in Qianya is strange. The fragrance of wild flowers permeates the body along one path, and several poles of bamboo are green. The grass gate tower and the fence courtyard are worthy of description and painting; the slate bridge and the white earth wall are really happy and rare. Qiu Rong is desolate, refreshing and lonely. Yellow leaves fall by the road, and white clouds float on the ridge. In the sparse forest, the mountain birds roared, and outside the village gate, the fine dogs chirped. When Bo Qin reached the door, he threw the dead tiger down and called out, ""Where are the little ones?"" go in. Bo Qin instructed the teacher: ""Flay the skin early, and arrange to entertain guests in the future."" Fu turned around to welcome Sanzang inside. When they saw each other, Sanzang thanked Xie Boqin for being kind and merciful, and Boqin said, ""My fellow villagers, thank you."" Boqin said: ""This is the mother and wife of the mountain."" Sanzang said: ""Please order to sit in the hall, and the poor monks will worship."" The old woman said: ""The elders are distant guests. : ""Mother, he is the one who was sent by King Tang to the west to see the Buddha and ask for scriptures. I met a child at the top of the mountain, and the child read a person from a country. I asked him to come home to rest his horse and take him on the road tomorrow."" Hearing this, he said with great joy: ""Good! Good! Good! Just invite him, don't be like this, just tomorrow your father Zhou Ji will do something good, read the scriptures, and send him the day after tomorrow."" Although Liu Boqin was a tiger slayer and the Taibao of Zhenshan, he had a heart of filial piety. Hearing his mother's words, he would arrange incense paper to keep Sanzang.","Applauding him unceasingly, Tripitaka said, “The Guardian is truly a mountain god!” “What ability do I have,” said Boqin, “that I merit such acclaim? This is really the good fortune of the father. Let’s go. I’d like to skin him quickly so that I can cook some of his meat to entertain you.” He held the trident in one hand and dragged the tiger with the other, leading the way while Tripitaka followed him with his horse. They walked together past the slope and all at once came upon a mountain village, in front of which were Old trees soaring skyward, Roads filled with wild creepers. In countless canyons the wind was cool; On many ridges came strange sounds and sights. One path’s wild blooms, their scent clung to one’s body; A few poles of bamboo, what enduring green! The portal of grass, The wattle-fenced yard— A picture to paint or sketch. The stone-slab bridge, The white-earth walls— How charming indeed, and rare! Now in the wistful face of autumn, The air was cool and brisk, By the wayside yellow leaves fell; Over the peaks the white clouds drifted. In thinly-grown woods the wild fowls twittered, And young dogs yelped outside the village gate. When Boqin reached the door of his house, he threw down the dead tiger and called, “Little ones, where are you?” Out came three or four houseboys, all looking rather unattractive and mean, who hauled the tiger inside. Boqin told them to skin it quickly and prepare it for the guest. He then turned around to welcome Tripitaka into his dwelling, and as they greeted each other, Tripitaka thanked him again for the great favor of saving his life. “We are fellow countrymen,” said Boqin, “and there’s little need for you to thank me.” After they had sat down and drunk tea, an old woman with someone who appeared to be her daughter-in-law came out to greet Tripitaka. “This is my mother, and this my wife,” said Boqin. “Pray ask your parent to take the honored seat,” said Tripitaka, “and let your poor monk pay his respects.” “Father is a guest coming from great distance,” said the old woman. “Please relax and don’t stand on ceremony.” “Mother,” said Boqin, “he has been sent by the Tang emperor to seek scriptures from Buddha in the Western Heaven. He met your son just now at the ridge. Since we are fellow countrymen, I invited him to the house to rest his horse. Tomorrow I shall see him on his way.” When she heard these words, the old woman was very pleased. “Good! Good! Good!” she said. “The timing couldn’t be better, even if we had planned to invite him. For tomorrow happens to be the anniversary of your late father’s death. Let us invite the elder to perform some good deeds and recite an appropriate passage of scripture. We shall see him off day after tomorrow.” Although he was a tiger slayer, a so-called “Guardian of the Mountain,” our Liu Boqin had a good deal of filial feeling for his mother. When he heard what she said, he immediately wanted to prepare the incense and the paper money, so that Tripitaka might be asked to stay.","Against his parents’ wish, Palace joys he left, To study the Mysteries, In lonely hill retreats. When his work was finished, He ascended up in light, Received the name of Conqueror, The Equal One with Heaven. All demon forms and spirits That caused man’s sin and woe Were put under his control. Two generals, of the Tortoise and Serpent Stars, and five dragons were sent to help Sun against the Demon of the Thunder Temple. But after several fights they were captured. Sun was greatly disheartened, but the local gods told him not to lose courage, but to ask the bodhisattva of the Southern Continent for aid. He was a chief of exceeding mighty power, who had formerly subdued the Queen of the Ocean. After hearing Sun’s tale, he sent his son and four of his generals to help him against the demon. But after fighting a long time, the demon captured them all in his magic bag, and, binding them, threw them into a vault. Then Sun went to the top of a hill near and wept in despair. In the midst of his grief, he saw a bright cloud approach from the Southwest and heard a voice calling him. This was no other than Lord Buddha himself. Lord Buddha told Sun not to lose heart, but to attack the demon once more. This time, however, he was to retreat before the demon and lead him to a little temple at the foot of the hill, where there was a garden of melons. Sun was then to transform himself into a fine ripe melon, and Buddha would give him to the demon to eat. Once inside his enemy, Sun could have his revenge. This plan greatly pleased Sun, and all was done as had been proposed. So Buddha, in the form of a gardener, gave the demon a large ripe melon to quench his thirst. As soon as Sun slipped down his throat, he caused such agony to the demon that he rolled on the ground, and the tears ran down his cheeks. Then Buddha made himself known to the demon, who was greatly terrified, and begged forgiveness. Lord Buddha then bade Sun come forth, and taking the demon’s treasures from him he shut him up in the magic bag.","Misery and woe!” Monkey found his master’s terror extremely irritating. “Calm down, for goodness’ sake. I’ll have a word with that dragon to give us our horse back.” “Don’t leave me!” Tripitaka implored. “What if he suddenly appears and snatches me?” “You are totally useless!” Monkey fulminated. “First you want a horse, then you won’t let me fetch you one. Why don’t we just sit here watching our bags till we get old and die?” “Don’t be so tetchy, Monkey,” a chorus of voices called from above. “And do stop blubbing, Tripitaka. We are spirits sent by Guanyin to offer you secret protection.” While Tripitaka bowed, Monkey busied himself with administrative matters. “I want your names and ranks so I can put together a register for the guardian spirit protection rota.” The forty-odd deities obediently recited back their names and occupations; the Gods of Darkness and Light volunteered for the first shift. “The rest of you can get lost for the time being,” Monkey told them. “Take good care of Tripitaka while I go after that damn dragon.” He tightened his vine belt, hitched up his tiger-skin kilt, and stood guard by a bulge in the stream, armed with his staff. “Lawless loach!” he yelled at the water. “Give me back my horse!” Having thoroughly eaten the horse, the dragon was at this moment lying on the bed of the brook, nurturing his humors and cultivating his digestive juices. When this abusive demand reached his ears, though, his heart caught fire and he leaped back out of the churning stream. “Who dares insult me?”","Sanzang was full of praise for him. “High Warden, you really are a mountain god.” “It was nothing,” said Liu Boqin, “so please don't exaggerate. This is all the result of your blessings. Come on, let's skin it and boil up some of its meat as soon as we can so as to get you fed.” Holding his trident in one hand and dragging the tiger with the other he led the way, while Sanzang followed, leading his horse. As they wound their way across the mountain, a cottage suddenly came into view. In front of its gate there were: Ancient trees reaching to the sky, Wild creepers covering the path. Cool were the wind and dust in the valleys, Strange vapours coiled around the cliffs. The scent of wild flowers was all along the path, Deep, deep the green of the bamboos. A thatched gatehouse, A fenced yard, Both pretty as a picture. A stone bridge, Whitewashed mud walls: Charming austerity. The loneliness of autumn, Airy isolation. Yellow leaves lay fallen beside the path, White clouds drifted above the peaks. Mountain birds sang in the woods While a puppy barked outside the gate. When he reached the gate, the high warden Liu Boqin threw down the tiger and shouted, “Where are you, lads?” Three or four servants of strange and repulsive appearance came out, and with much pulling and tugging they carried the tiger in. Boqin told them to skin it at once and prepare it to offer to their guest, then turned round to welcome Sanzang in. When they had formally greeted each other Sanzang bowed to Boqin to thank him for taking pity on him and saving his life. “Why bother to thank me? We're fellow countrymen.” When Sanzang had been offered a seat and served with tea, an old woman came out to greet him followed by a young one. Liu Boqin explained that they were his mother and his wife. “Madam, please take the highest seat while I bow to you,” said Sanzang. “You are a guest from afar, venerable monk, so let us each preserve our dignity and neither bow to the other,” the old woman replied. “Mother,” said Liu Boqin, “he has been sent by His Majesty the Tang Emperor to go to the Western Heaven to see the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. I met him on the mountain, and I thought that as we were fellow-countrymen I should invite him home to rest before I take him on his way tomorrow.” The old woman was delighted. “Good, good,” she said. “But it would be even better to ask him to stay longer. Tomorrow is the anniversary of your father's passing away, and I would like to trouble the venerable monk to say some prayers and read a sutra for him; you could take him on his way the day after.” Although this Boqin was a tiger-killer and the high warden of the mountain, he was a dutiful son, and when he heard this suggestion he made ready paper and incense and asked Sanzang to stay."
忽见一座城，城门上挂着一面大牌，上写着“幽冥地府鬼门关”七个大金字。那青衣将幢幡摇动，引太宗径入城中，顺街而走。,"Suddenly I saw a city with a big sign hanging on the gate, with seven big golden characters written on it, ""Ghost Gate of the Underworld"". That Tsing Yi shook the banner and led Taizong into the city, following the street.","He suddenly saw a huge city, and on a large plaque above the city gate was the inscription in gold letters, “The Region of Darkness, The Gate of Spirits.” Waving the banners, the blue robes led Taizong into the city.","They were to take them upside down and call out the Monkey’s name, and if he replied, he would be found inside them, and the demons were to seal them up, with the seal of the Ancient of Days. When the Monkey found himself crushed under the three mountains, he was greatly distressed about his Master, and cried aloud, “","Taizong and Cui Jue followed the young men into a huge metropolis, past a golden-lettered welcome sign that read the capital of darkness: a fine city.","A city wall appeared in front of them, and above its gates hung a large tablet on which was written DEVIL GATE OF THE WORLD OF DARKNESS in huge letters of gold. The two lictors waved their banners and led Taizong into the city and along its streets."
“兄弟，正是这等！他领了几十个小妖，敢与老孙赌斗，被我打败了，他转不往洞跑，却跑来这里寻死。亏你接着；不然，又走了。”八戒道：“弄风摄师父去的可是他？”行者道：“正是，正是。”八戒道：“你可曾问他师父的下落么？”行者道：“这怪把师父拿在洞里，要与他甚么鸟大王做下饭。是老孙恼了，就与他斗将这里来，却着你送了性命。兄弟啊，这个功劳算你的，你可还守着马与行李，等我把这死怪拖了去，再到那洞口索战。须是拿得那老妖，方才救得师父。”八戒道：“哥哥说得有理。你去，你去，若是打败了这老妖，还赶将这里来，等老猪截住杀他。”好行者，一只手提着铁棒，一只手拖着死虎，径至他洞口。,"""Brother, that's it! He led dozens of little demons, dared to gamble with Lao Sun, but was defeated by me. He couldn't turn to the cave, but came here to seek death. It's your fault for continuing; otherwise, go again. It's over."" Bajie said: ""It was him who caught the wind and took Master away?"" Walker said: ""Exactly, exactly."" Bajie said, ""Have you ever asked him about Master's whereabouts?"" Walker said: ""This is a strange thing. The master took it in the cave and wanted to cook with him some bird king. It was Lao Sun who was annoyed, so he fought with him to come here, but he killed you. Brother, this credit is yours, but you still guard it. Horse and luggage, wait for me to drag this dead monster away, and then go to the entrance of the cave to fight. You must get the old monster before you can save the master."" Bajie said: ""Brother is right. You go, you go, If you defeat this old demon, you will come here and wait for the old pig to stop and kill him."" The good traveler, holding an iron rod in one hand and a dead tiger in the other, walked to the entrance of his cave.","When Pilgrim saw that, he was very pleased, saying, “That’s right, Brother! He was audacious enough to lead scores of little demons against me, but he was defeated. Instead of fleeing back to the cave, he came here seeking death. It’s a good thing you are here, or else he would have escaped again.” “Is he the one who took our master with the wind?” asked Eight Rules. “ Yes! Yes!’’ said Pilgrim. “Did you ask him the whereabouts of our master?’’ said Eight Rules. “This monster brought Master to the cave,” said Pilgrim, “to be served to some blackguard of a Great King as meat for his rice. I was enraged, fought with him, and chased him here for you to finish him off. Brother, this is your merit! You can remain here guarding the horse and luggage, and let me drag this dead monster back to the mouth of the cave to provoke battle again. We must capture the old monster before we can rescue Master.” “You are right, Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules. “Go, go now! If you beat that old monster, chase him here and let old Hog intercept and kill him.” Dear Pilgrim! Holding the iron rod in one hand and dragging the dead tiger with the other, he went back to the mouth of the cave. So it was that",,"“Is it safe?’ Tripitaka worried. “Think about it,” Monkey reasoned with him, “a creature who’s gone to the trouble of learning human speech wouldn’t lie. Don’t forget the horse.” Following Monkey’s direction, the band of travelers climbed onto the turtle’s shell. Just in case the turtle did have any mischief in mind, Monkey untied his belt and threaded it through the turtle’s nose to serve as a rein. He stood with one foot on the turtle’s back, the other on its head, one hand grasping his staff, the other the makeshift rein. “Watch yourself, turtle,” he muttered. “One false move and you’ll taste my staff.” The turtle glided out onto the water’s surface as if it were solid, level ground. In less than a day, the disciples reached the other side of the river, perfectly safe and dry. After disembarking, Tripitaka placed his palms together in thanks. “You must be exhausted, venerable turtle, and we have nothing to reward you with. I’ll be sure to bring you something back from India.” “No need,” the turtle responded, “but perhaps in India you could help answer a question I have, for I understand that the Buddha is birthless and deathless, and knows past and future. I have cultivated myself for thirteen hundred years, thereby lengthening my life, lightening my body and learning human speech. But I still cannot escape my turtle shell. When you see the Buddha, could you ask him how I could acquire a human body?” “I absolutely will,” Tripitaka promised. The turtle then slid back into the water and the pilgrims carried on their way.","When Monkey saw this he was delighted, and he said, “That's the way, brother. He led a few dozen petty fiends out to do battle with me, but I beat him. Instead of running back to the cave he came this way, as if he wanted to die. If you hadn't been here to meet him, he'd have got away again.” “Was he the one who made a gale and carried off our master?” Pig asked. “The very one,” Monkey replied. “Did you ask him where our master is?” Pig asked. “He took our master into the cave and wanted to give him to his chieftain to eat with his rice. This made me so angry that I fought him all the way to here, where you finished him off. The credit for this must go to you, brother. You'd better go on looking after the horse and our things while I drag that monster's body over to the cave and challenge them to another fight. We must capture the chief monster if we're to rescue our master.” “You're right,” said Pig, “so off you go. If you beat that chief monster, mind you chase him this way for me to corner and kill.” Splendid Monkey went straight to the mouth of the cave with his cudgel in one hand and the dead tiger in the other."
又急转过花园，只见菜园门也开了。忙入人参园里，倚在树下，望上查数；颠倒来往，只得二十二个。明月道：“你可会算帐？”,"He turned around the garden again, and saw that the vegetable garden door was also open. Busy entering the ginseng garden, leaning under the tree, looking up and counting; Mingyue said: ""Can you settle accounts?""","They ran past the flower garden and saw that the door to the vegetable garden was also open. They dashed into the ginseng garden; running up to the tree, they started to count, staring upward.

那猴在山中，却会行走跳跃，食草木，饮涧泉，采山花，觅树果；与狼虫为伴，虎豹为群，獐鹿为友，猕猿为亲；夜宿石崖之下，朝游峰洞之中。真是“山中无甲子，寒尽不知年。”一朝天气炎热，与群猴避暑，都在松阴之下顽耍。你看他一个个：,"The monkey walks and jumps in the mountains, eats herbs and trees, drinks springs, plucks mountain flowers, and forages fruit from trees; it is accompanied by wolves, tigers and leopards as a group, deer as friends, and macaques as relatives; Down, towards the You Peak Cave. It's really ""there is no Jiazi in the mountains, and the cold does not know the year."" Once the weather was hot, and the group of monkeys escaped the heat, they all played under the pine shade. Look at him one by one:","That monkey in the mountain was able to walk, run, and leap about; he fed on grass and shrubs, drank from the brooks and streams, gathered mountain flowers, and searched out fruits from trees. He made his companions the tiger and the lizard, the wolf and the leopard; he befriended the civet and the deer, and he called the gibbon and the baboon his kin. At night he slept beneath stony ridges, and in the morning he sauntered about the caves and the peaks. Truly, In the mountain there is no passing of time; The cold recedes, but one knows not the year.8 One very hot morning, he was playing with a group of monkeys under the shade of some pine trees to escape the heat. Look at them, each amusing himself in his own way by","The Monkey on the mountain could walk and jump, eat vegetables and drink of the brook, pluck wild flowers and seek for fruit and berries, and make companions of monkeys and birds and join a herd of deer. At night he lay down on a rock. In the day he wandered about on mountain peaks and penetrated into caves. Truly he was the most incomparable of all living creatures. In the greatest cold he did not suffer.","The monkey gamboled over the mountains, eating grass, drinking from streams, picking mountain flowers, hunting for fruit; he kept company with wolves and snakes, tigers and panthers, befriended deer and antelope, and swore brotherhood with macaques and apes. At night, he slept below cliffs; at sunrise, he wandered through mountains and caves, with no sense of the passing of time. One sweltering morning, he sheltered from the heat with a crowd of monkeys in the shade of some pines; they swung from branch to branch, built sand pagodas, and chased dragonflies and lizards.","On his mountain the monkey was soon able to run and jump, feed from plants and trees, drink from brooks and springs, pick mountain flowers and look for fruit. He made friends with the wolves, went around with the tigers and leopards, was on good terms with the deer, and had the other monkeys and apes for relations. At night he slept under the rockfaces, and he roamed around the peaks and caves by day. As the saying so rightly goes, “There is no calendar in the mountains, and when winter's over you don't know the time of year.” On hot mornings he and all the other monkeys would play under the shade of some pines to avoid the heat. Just look at them all:"

Bajie saw it and said, ""If it is a raging tide, there is no boat to cross.""","“Disciples,” exclaimed Tripitaka, “look at that vast expanse of water in front of us. Why are there no boats in sight?

He echoed: ""The one who disturbs the Heavenly Palace is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven."" The Jade Emperor was annoyed. That is to say, dispatch the four heavenly kings, cooperate with Li Tianwang and Prince Nezha, and point out the twenty-eight stars, the nine luminaries, the twelve Yuanchen, the five directions, the four meritorious officials, the east and west stars, the two north and south gods, the five mountains and four ditches, and the universal stars. A total of 100,000 celestial soldiers deployed 18 celestial nets to the lower bounds, and went to Huaguo Mountain to besiege them, and they were sure to capture that fellow and deal with them. Immediately, the gods left the Heavenly Palace. This one goes, but see that:","The minister received his order and left the palace to make a thorough investigation. After obtaining all the details, he returned presently to report, “The person who has so profoundly disturbed Heaven is none other than the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven.” He then gave a repeated account of all the previous incidents, and the Jade Emperor was furious. He at once commanded the Four Great Devarājas to assist Devarāja Li and Prince Naṭa.

They were ordered to set up eighteen sets of cosmic net, to journey to the Region Below, to encircle completely the Flower-Fruit Mountain, and to capture the rogue and bring him to justice. All the deities immediately alerted their troops and departed from the Heavenly Palace. As they left, this was the spectacle of the expedition:","The superintendent went out and made enquiries everywhere. Then he reported and said, “The disturber of the celestial guests is none other than the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven,” and he then told the story of his doings.

Together, they mobilized the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Nine Luminaries, the Twelve Heavenly Branches, the Guards of the Five Quarters, most of the Heavenly officer corps, plus one hundred thousand celestial infantry.","The Miraculous Investigator left the palace in obedience to the edict, and by making thorough enquiries he found out all the details of what had happened. “The wrecker of the Heavenly Palace was Sun Wukong,” he reported, and he went on to give a full account.

三藏道：“我贫僧是唐朝来的，往西天拜佛求经，适路过此间，天晚，特造檀府借宿一宵，明早不犯天光就行。万望方便一二。”老者道：“你虽是个唐人，那个恶的却非唐人。”悟空厉声高呼道：“你这个老儿全没眼色！唐人是我师父，我是他徒弟！,"Sanzang said: ""My poor monk came from the Tang Dynasty. I went to the west to worship Buddha and ask for scriptures. It is convenient to pass by here. In the evening, I specially built Tan Mansion to stay overnight.

We plan to leave tomorrow before it’s light, and we beseech you not to deny our request.” “Though you may be a Tang man,” the old man said, “that nasty character is certainly no Tang man!” “Old fellow!” cried Wukong in a loud voice, “you really can’t see, can you? The Tang man is my master, and I am his disciple.","Sun picked out various hearts dripping with blood, but none of them were black, and he asked, “Is it this white heart, this yellow heart, this heart, ambitious for riches or fame, or this jealous heart, filled with desire to be first and foremost, or this heart full of desire to be honorable, or to be careful? These I can give you, but there is not a single black heart or desire in the whole lot.” At this the king was bewildered and said, “Stop, we do not want any more of this.” But the substitute Master said, “How blind you have been, Oh king! It is this Taoist priest who has the black heart. Let me show it to you!” In a moment Sun changed into his own form, and made for the Taoist priest, who recognised him as the Great Sage, who had thrown Heaven itself into turmoil 500 years before. The priest then fled with the queen, but Sun followed them, and by the aid of the local gods found their hiding place.","Is it because I’m back so late?” “You’re so uncouth,” trilled Monkey. “I’m not feeling at all well today, but in you come demanding a kiss. Get undressed and go to sleep.” The unsuspecting fiend did as he was told. Meanwhile, Monkey got up to sit on the chamber pot. “Where are you, my sugarplum?” the monster asked, now in bed and unable to find his beloved. “You go to sleep,” Monkey told him.","When the old man looked up and saw Sanzang's pure face he felt steady on his feet at once, and he asked what monastery Sanzang was from, and why had he brought that evil-looking creature to his house. “I come from the Tang Court,” said Sanzang, “and I am going to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. As we were passing this way at nightfall we came to your mansion, good benefactor, to ask for a night's lodging. We shall be off before dawn tomorrow.

唐王在那宝殿上闻言，十分欢喜，又问：“那和尚，九环杖有甚好处？”菩萨道：“我这锡杖，是那铜镶铁造九连环，九节仙藤永驻颜。入手厌看青骨瘦，下山轻带白云还。摩呵五祖游天阙，罗卜寻娘破地关。不染红尘些子秽，喜伴神僧上玉山。”唐王闻言，即命展开袈裟，从头细看，果然是件好物，道：“大法长老，实不瞒你，朕今大开善教，广种福田，见在那化生寺聚集多僧，敷演经法。内中有一个大有德行者，法名玄奘。朕买你这两件宝物，赐他受用。你端的要价几何？”菩萨闻言，与木叉合掌皈依，道声佛号，躬身上启道：“既有德行，贫僧情愿送他，决不要钱。”说罢，抽身便走。唐王急着萧瑀扯住，欠身立于殿上，问曰：“你原说袈裟五千两，锡杖二千两，你见朕要买，就不要钱，敢是说朕心倚恃君位，强要你的物件？更无此理。朕照你原价奉偿，却不可推避。”菩萨起手道：“贫僧有愿在前，原说果有敬重三宝，见善随喜，皈依我佛，不要钱，愿送与他。今见陛下明德止善，敬我佛门，况又高僧有德有行，宣扬大法，理当奉上，决不要钱。贫僧愿留下此物告回。”唐王见他这等勤恳甚喜，随命光禄寺大排素宴酬谢。菩萨又坚辞不受，畅然而去，依旧望都土地庙中隐避不题。,"When King Tang heard the words in the hall, he was very happy, and asked again, ""Then monk, what is the benefit of the nine-ring stick?"" The Bodhisattva said, ""My tin stick is the copper-inlaid iron made of nine chains, and the nine-segmented vines will stay forever. Yan. I'm tired of looking at the green bones and thin, and when I go down the mountain, I will bring back the white clouds. The five ancestors of Mohe traveled to Tianque, and Luo Bu Xunniang broke through the ground. I don't get stained with red dust and some filth, and I like to accompany the gods and monks to Yushan."" Tang Wang heard the words and ordered Unfolding the cassock and looking at it from the beginning, it was indeed a good thing, and said: ""Elder Dafa, I will tell you the truth, I am now opening up a good teaching and planting a lot of blessing fields. I saw many monks gathered at the Huasheng Temple, and they practiced the scriptures. A man of great virtue, the Dharma name is Xuanzang. I bought these two treasures from you and gave them to use them. How much are you asking for?"" Hearing the words, the Bodhisattva folded his palms with the wooden fork to take refuge, said the Buddha's name, and bowed his body and said, ""Since the If there is virtue, the poor monk would rather send him, but never ask for money."" After saying that, he pulled away and left. Tang Wang was anxious to stop Xiao Yu, leaned his body and stood on the hall, and asked, ""You originally said that the cassocks were five thousand taels and the tin sticks were two thousand taels. If you see that I want to buy them, you don't want the money. You dare to say that I rely on the throne. Want your things? There is no reason. I will pay you the original price, but it cannot be avoided."" The Bodhisattva raised his hand and said: ""The poor monk has a vow to go ahead, he said that if he has respect for the Three Jewels, he will rejoice when he sees good things, and take refuge in me. Buddha, I don't want money, I would like to give it to him. Now I see that Your Majesty is virtuous and virtuous, respects my Buddhism, and the eminent monks are virtuous and virtuous, and they preach Dafa. ""The King of Tang was very happy to see his diligence and diligence, and ordered a large vegetarian banquet at Guanglu Temple to reward him. The Bodhisattva insisted that he would not accept it again, and went away freely, still hiding in the Temple of the Earth in Wangdu.","When the Tang emperor, who was up in the Treasure Hall, heard these words, he was highly pleased. “Tell me, priest,” he asked again, “What’s so good about the nine-ring priestly staff?” “My staff,” said the Bodhisattva, “has on it Nine joined-rings made of iron and set in bronze, And nine joints of vine immortal ever young. When held, it scorns the sight of aging bones; It leaves the mount to return with fleecy clouds. It roamed through Heaven with the Fifth Patriarch; It broke Hell’s gate where Luo Bo sought his Mom.20 Not soiled by the filth of this red-dust world, It gladly trails the god-monk up Mount Jade.”21 When the Tang emperor heard these words, he gave the order to have the cassock spread open so that he might examine it carefully from top to bottom. It was indeed a marvelous thing! “Venerable Elder of the Great Law,” he said, “we shall not deceive you. At this very moment we have exalted the Religion of Mercy and planted abundantly in the fields of blessing. You may see many priests assembled in the Temple of Transformation to perform the Law and the sūtras. In their midst is a man of great merit and virtue, whose religious name is Xuanzang. We wish, therefore, to purchase these two treasure objects from you to give them to him. How much do you really want for these things?” Hearing these words, the Bodhisattva and Mokṣa folded their hands and gave praise to the Buddha. “If he is a man of virtue and merit,” she said to the Throne, bowing, “this humble cleric is willing to give them to him. I shall not accept any money.” She finished speaking and turned at once to leave. The Tang emperor quickly asked Xiao Yu to hold her back. Standing up in the Hall, he bowed low before saying, “Previously you claimed that the cassock was worth five thousand taels of silver, and the staff two thousand. Now that you see we want to buy them, you refuse to accept payment. Are you implying that we would bank on our position and take your possession by force? That’s absurd! We shall pay you according to the original sum you asked for; please do not refuse it.” Raising her hands for a salutation, the Bodhisattva said, “This humble cleric made a vow before, stating that anyone who reveres the Three Treasures, rejoices in virtue, and submits to our Buddha will be given these treasures free. Since it is clear that Your Majesty is eager to magnify virtue, to rest in excellence, and to honor our Buddhist faith by having an illustrious monk proclaim the Great Law, it is my duty to present these gifts to you. I shall take no money for them. They will be left here and this humble cleric will take leave of you.” When the Tang emperor saw that she was so insistent, he was very pleased. He ordered the Court of Banquets to prepare a huge vegetarian feast to thank the Bodhisattva, who firmly declined that also. She left amiably and went back to her hiding place at the Temple of the Local Spirit, which we shall mention no further.","Being cold and hungry they greatly rejoiced to see a fine building ahead of them, but Sun said, “It is another demon trap. I will make a ring round you. Inside that you will be safe. Do not wander outside it. I will go and look for food.” By magic and skill Sun managed to get his begging bowl full of food, and returned to the Master. But the Master and his disciples had become tired of waiting inside the ring, and had gone to explore a fine building nearby. Zhu Bajie went in to look. Not a soul was to be seen, but when he entered one of the back rooms upstairs, he was terrified out of his wits, for there was a white human skeleton of immense size lying there. He was about to flee when he saw three wadded cloaks which he took to keep the pilgrims warm. The Master upbraided Zhu Bajie, and would have had him restore them at once. By this time, however, the Demon of the House descended on them, bound the Master and said, “We have heard that if we eat a bit of your flesh our white hairs shall become black again, and our lost teeth spring up afresh.” So he gave orders to the small demons to bind the three. This they did, and thrust the pilgrims into a cave, and lay in wait for Sun. When he returned, there was a great fight. Sun by magic called forth a hundred thousand snakes which so frightened the small demons that they all ran to their cave. But they succeeded in robbing Sun of his magic club. When your virtue has grown one foot, The demon’s tares have grown ten feet. What a pity the soul often has no steady purpose. But is led astray by circumstances. The Great Sage, empty handed, having lost the battle, cried bitterly, and called out, “Master, I had hoped to bear testimony with you, and practice religion with you till I was saved by the same Providence, and had the same magic power, little thinking that I should now be helpless without my weapons to do good.” He then went up to heaven to ask for aid, but finally he was cast on his own resources, and managed to regain some of the stolen weapons. At night Sun, by various magic arts, entered the demon’s cave and tried to take possession of a magic coil belonging to him. But failing in this, he called forth a number of small monkeys, who took away most of the demon’s weapons and set fire to the cave. Half of the small demons were burnt. But the Demon of the House, by means of his magic coil, put out the fire and Sun was not able to rescue the Master and his fellow pilgrims, who still remained bound.","“Great king!” “You’ve nothing to fear from me,” the new arrival reassured Tripitaka, raising him to his feet. “I’m just a local hunter called Liu Boqin. I was out searching for some dinner. I hope I didn’t scare you.” “I’m a Buddhist monk from the Tang empire, sent to fetch scriptures from the west. You saved me from those tigers and snakes! How can I ever thank you?” “They know I’m a hunter,” replied Boqin. “That’s why they ran away as soon as they saw me. We are actually compatriots, you and I, for this bit of country still counts as part of the Tang empire. Come home with me to rest your horse. I’ll see you on your way tomorrow.” Tripitaka happily accepted. After one hill, the wind started up again. “Stay there,” Boqin said. “Where there’s a wind, there’s a wildcat. That’s your dinner on its way over here.” Tripitaka, as usual, was paralyzed with fear while the indomitable Boqin faced off with a tiger, which tried to flee as soon as it saw the hunter. “Where do you think you’re going?” thundered Boqin, attacking the animal with his trident. Eventually, after a couple of hours’ struggle, the tiger grew tired, and he dispatched it by driving the pitchfork through its chest.","When the Tang Emperor heard these words spoken in his throne hall he was filled with joy, and he asked another question: “Monk, what is so wonderful about your nine-ringed staff?” “This staff of mine,” the Bodhisattva replied, “is: A nine-ringed iron staff inlaid with copper, A nine-sectioned Immortal's cane to preserve eternal youth. Held in your hand it's as light as a bone, As you go down the mountain it brings white clouds. The Fifth Patriarch took it through the gates of Heaven; When Lo Bu searched for his mother he used it to smash the gates of Earth. Untouched by the filth of mortal dust, It gladly accompanies the godly monk as he climbs the jade mountain.” The Tang Emperor then ordered that the cassock be unfolded. On examining it from top to bottom he saw that it was indeed a fine article. “Elder of the Great Law,” he said, “I tell you truthfully that I am now propagating the good word and widely sowing seeds of blessing. At this moment many monks are assembled at the Huasheng Monastery for recitation of the surras. Among them is one monk of outstanding virtue whose Buddha-name is Xuanzang, and we wish to buy those two treasures of yours to give him. So what is your price?” The Bodhisattva and Moksa put their hands together, intoned the name of the Buddha, and bowed down. “If he really is a virtuous monk,” she said, “I shall give them to him, and I refuse to accept any money for them.” With that she turned and left. The Emperor immediately told Xiao Yu to stop her as he rose to his feet and called out, “You told us that you wanted five thousand ounces for the cassock and two thousand for the staff, but now that we have said we shall buy them, you refuse to take any money. Are you going to say that I abused my power to seize your things? We would never dream of it. We shall pay the price you asked, and will take no refusal.” Raising her hand the Bodhisattva said, “I made a vow that I would give them free to anyone who honoured the Three Treasures, delighted in goodness, and believed in our Buddha. Now I have seen that Your Majesty is a good and virtuous respecter of our Buddhist faith, and have heard that there is a monk of virtuous conduct who preaches the Great Law, it is only right that I should offer them to him; I don't want any money for them. I am leaving the things here. Good-bye.” The Tang Emperor was very pleased with the monk's sincerity, and ordered that a large vegetarian banquet be given to thank him in the Imperial Kitchen. This the Bodhisattva refused to accept and went airily off. There is no need to describe how she returned to her hide-out in the local god's temple."
“徒弟，不可伤他性命；不然，又一个得财伤人的罪了。”行者道：“我晓得。”行者复进去，来到那童儿睡的房门外。他腰里有带的瞌睡虫儿，原来在东天门与增长天王猜枚耍子赢的。他摸出两个来，瞒窗眼儿弹将进去，径奔到那童子脸上，鼾鼾沉睡，再莫想得醒。他才拽开云步，赶上唐僧，顺大路一直西奔，这一夜马不停蹄，只行到天晓，三藏道：“这个猴头弄杀我也！你因为嘴，带累我一夜无眠！”行者道：“不要只管埋怨。天色明了，你且在这路旁边树林中将就歇歇，养养精神再走。”那长老只得下马，倚松根权作禅床坐下，沙僧歇了担子打盹，八戒枕着石睡觉。孙大圣偏有心肠，你看他跳树扳枝顽耍。四众歇息不题。,"""Apprentice, don't hurt his life; otherwise, it will be another crime of getting money and hurting others."" The walker said, ""I know."" The walker went back in and came to the door where the boy was sleeping. The sleepy bug with a belt around his waist turned out to be the one who won the game with the King of Growth at Dongtianmen. He took out two of them, slammed them into the window, and ran straight to the boy's face, snoring and falling asleep, never thinking about waking up. Only then did he pull Yunbu away, catch up with Tang Seng, and ran west along the main road. He did not stop until dawn, and Sanzang said, ""This monkey head is killing me! You are tired of me and sleepless all night because of your mouth!"" Said: ""Don't just complain. The sky is clear, you can rest in the woods next to the road, and keep your spirits up before you go."" The elder had to dismount, leaning on Songgenquan to sit down on the meditation bed, and the monk Sha rested his burden and took a nap. , Bajie sleeps on the stone. Sun Dasheng has a heart, you can see him jumping on trees and pulling branches. It's okay for the four to rest.","“Disciple,” said Tripitaka, “don’t harm them, or you will be guilty of murder as well as robbery.” “I won’t harm them,” said Pilgrim. Going inside again, he went to the door of the room where the lads were sleeping. He still had around his waist a few sleep-inducing insects, which he had won from the Devarāja Virūpākṣa when they had played a game of guess-fingers at the East Heaven Gate. Taking out two of these insects, he filliped them through a hole in the window. They headed straight for the faces of the lads who fell at once into a sleep so deep that it seemed nothing could arouse them. Then Pilgrim turned around and caught up with the Tang Monk, and all of them fled, following the main road to the West. Throughout that whole night, the horse did not pause to rest, and they journeyed until it was almost dawn. “Monkey,” said the Tang Monk, “you have just about killed me! Because of your mouth, I’ve had to spend a sleepless night.” “Stop this complaining!” said Pilgrim. “It’s dawn now, and you may as well take some rest in the forest here by the road. After you have regained a little strength, we’ll move on.” All that elder could do was to dismount and use a pine root as his couch. As soon as he put down the luggage, Sha Monk dozed off, while Eight Rules fell asleep with a rock as his pillow. The Great Sage Sun, however, had other interests. Just look at him! Climbing the trees and leaping from branch to branch, he had a grand time playing. We shall leave them resting and make no further mention of them now.",,"“It has no end and no beginning, and carries its passengers to eternal peace and joy.” “Sounds perfect,” said Monkey. “Hop on, everyone.” When Tripitaka continued to hesitate, Monkey gave him a good shove; the Buddhist master promptly fell into the river. The boatman quickly fished him out, and the religious master stood on one side of the boat wringing his clothes out, stamping his shoes, and grumbling at Monkey, who was busy helping Sandy and Pigsy get the horse and luggage on board. As soon as the boatman began gently punting across the river, a corpse floated past. Monkey smiled at the terror-stricken Tripitaka. “Don’t be afraid. It’s you.” “So it is!” Pigsy and Sandy exclaimed, clapping their hands. “Congratulations!” added the boatman. They were soon safely across, and Tripitaka skipped lightly onto the bank. They had truly reached the other shore, breaking free of their mortal senses—sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and thought. The boat and its pilot vanished. The four of them sprang up Soul Mountain.","“Mind you don't kill them, disciple,” said Sanzang, “or you'll be on a charge of murder in the pursuit of theft as well.” “I'm aware of that,” replied Monkey and went back into the temple. Standing outside the door of the room where the boys were sleeping, he took a couple of sleep insects from his belt. These were what he had used when he fooled the Heavenly King Virudhaka at the Eastern Gate of Heaven, and now he threw them in through a gap in the window lattice. They landed straight on the boys' faces, and made them fall into a deeper sleep from which they would not wake up for a long time. Then he streaked back by cloud and caught up with Sanzang. They headed West along the main road. That night the horse never stopped, and they kept on till dawn. “You'll be the death of me, you ape,” said Sanzang. “Because of your greed I've had to stay awake all night.” “Stop grumbling,” said Monkey. “Now that it's light you can rest in the forest beside the road and build your strength up before we move on.” Sanzang obediently dismounted and sat down on the roots of a pine tree, using it as a makeshift meditation platform. Friar Sand put down the luggage and took a nap, while Pig pillowed his head on a rock and went to sleep. Monkey, the Great Sage, had his own ideas and amused himself leaping from tree to tree."
却说行者伏侍唐僧西进，行经数日，正是那腊月寒天，朔风凛凛，滑冻凌凌，去的是些悬崖峭壁崎岖路，迭岭层峦险峻山。三藏在马上，遥闻唿喇喇水声聒耳，回头叫：“悟空，是那里水响？”行者道：“我记得此处叫做蛇盘山鹰愁涧，想必是涧里水响。”说不了，马到涧边，三藏勒缰观看，但见：涓涓寒脉穿云过，湛湛清波映日红。声摇夜雨闻幽谷，彩发朝霞眩太空。千仞浪飞喷碎玉，一泓水响吼清风。流归万顷烟波去，鸥鹭相忘没钓逢。师徒两个正然看处，只见那涧当中响一声，钻出一条龙来，推波掀浪，撺出崖山，就抢长老。慌得个行者丢了行李，把师父抱下马来，回头便走。那条龙就赶不上，把他的白马连鞍辔一口吞下肚去，依然伏水潜踪。行者把师父送在那高阜上坐了，却来牵马挑担，止存得一担行李，不见了马匹。他将行李担送到师父面前道：“师父，那孽龙也不见踪影，只是惊走我的马了。”三藏道：“徒弟啊，却怎生寻得马着么？”行者道：“放心，放心，等我去看来。”,"However, it is said that the traveler followed the Tang monk to the west, and traveled for several days. It was the cold day of the twelfth lunar month, the wind was cold, and the mountains were slick and cold. They went to some steep cliffs and rugged roads, and the mountains were steep and steep. Sanzang was on his horse, and when he heard the rustling sound of water in the distance, he turned around and called, ""Wukong, where is the sound of water?"" The traveler said, ""I remember that this place is called Snake Panshan Yingchou Stream. It must be the sound of water in the stream."" He said. No, I went to the edge of the stream, and Sanzang Le was watching, but I saw: the cold veins passed through the clouds, and the waves of Zhan Zhanqing reflected the sun. The sound shakes the night and the rain smells the valley, and the color of the morning glow dazzles the space. Thousands of waves flew and sprayed broken jade, and a flood of water roared in the breeze. Flowing back to the thousands of hectares of smoke and waves, the gulls and herons forgot that they did not catch each other. The master and the apprentice looked rightly at the place, and saw a sound in the middle of the stream, a dragon came out, pushed the waves, pushed out of the cliff, and robbed the elder. The traveler lost his luggage in a panic, carried the master off the horse, turned around and left. The dragon couldn't catch up, so he swallowed his white horse with its saddle and bridle in one bite, and was still lurking in the water. The traveler sent the master to sit on the Gaofu, but came to lead the horse to carry the load, and the horse was nowhere to be found. He put the luggage in front of his master and said, ""Master, the evil dragon is nowhere to be seen. It just scared my horse away."" Sanzang said, ""My apprentice, how did you find the horse?"" Don't worry, don't worry, wait for me to see.""","We were telling you about Pilgrim, who ministered to the Tang Monk faithfully as they advanced toward the West. They traveled for several days under the frigid sky of midwinter; a cold wind blew fiercely, and slippery icicles hung everywhere. They traversed A tortuous path of hanging gorges and cliffs, A parlous range tiered with summits and peaks. As Tripitaka was riding along on his horse, his ears caught the distant sound of a torrent. He turned to ask: “Wukong, where is that sound coming from?” Pilgrim said, “The name of this place, I recall, is Serpent Coil Mountain, and there is an Eagle Grief Stream in it. I suppose that’s where it’s coming from.” Before they had finished their conversation, they arrived at the bank of the stream. Tripitaka reined in his horse and looked around. He saw A bubbling cold stream piercing through the clouds, Its limpid current reddened by the sun. Its splatter in night rain stirs quiet vales; Its colors glow at dawn to fill the air. Wave after wave seems like flying chips of jade, Their deep roar resonant as the clear wind. It flows to join one vast stretch of smoke and tide, Where gulls are lost with egrets but no fishers bide. Master and disciple were looking at the stream, when there was a loud splash in midstream and a dragon emerged. Churning the waters, it darted toward the bank and headed straight for the priest. Pilgrim was so startled that he threw away the luggage, hauled the master off his horse, and turned to flee with him at once. The dragon could not catch up with them, but it swallowed the white horse, harness and all, with one gulp before losing itself again in the water. Pilgrim carried his master to high ground and left the priest seated there; then he returned to fetch the horse and the luggage. The load of bags was still there, but the horse was nowhere to be seen. Placing the luggage in front of his master, he said, “Master, there’s not a trace of that cursed dragon, which has frightened away our horse.” “Disciple,” said Tripitaka, “how can we find the horse again?” “Relax! Relax!” said Pilgrim. “Let me go and have a look!”","ON THE PILGRIMS WENT, till they came to the Golden Temple where Shakyamuni had once preached. There they were hospitably received by the abbot, who said grace before eating. Attached to the temple was an orphanage. There they met a monk 105 years old, who told them, privately, that the king’s daughter was in the orphanage. She declared she had been carried off and placed in this temple by the demons, whilst a witch had been substituted as the royal princess in the palace. He begged them to find out the truth of this, as every night the true princess begged him to help her. The pilgrims promised to do what they could. On entering the city in search of the king’s palace, to get his passport signed, the Master and Sun found a strange ceremony taking place. The king’s only daughter had fixed on that very day and hour to throw a colored silk ball on the head of her chosen husband. She threw it at the Master, and carried him to the palace, amid the congratulations of all the people. But the Master said he was on an important mission, and must consult his three disciples, as to what was to be done. He was warned that if he did not accept the princess’ choice he would he killed. This threw the Master into a great fear and he waited anxiously for the appearance of his disciples, for whom he had sent. The three disciples were invited to the royal palace. On entering the royal presence, the three stood upright, and none of them knelt.","Chapter Nineteen After a series of remarkable events—Pigsy falling into the Buddha’s honey-trap; a piqued Monkey demolishing a holy tree laden with magical fruits resembling newborn babies; Pigsy, Tripitaka, and Sandy being lacquered; and Monkey being fried by the outraged keeper of the tree—the team of disciples made peace with the immortal horticulturalist in question, restored themselves with plenty of ginseng and cinnabar, and set off once more for the west. Soon they came to another tall mountain. “The way ahead is steep and treacherous,” observed Tripitaka, “I fear the horse will slip. Take care, all of you.” “Don’t worry, Master!” cheered Monkey. Our hero led the way, opening a path onto a high ridge. Before them lay yet another mountain range running with streams, tigers, wolves, deer, foxes, rabbits, and a thousand-foot python and a one-hundred-thousand-foot hydra, both of whom busily belched horrendous miasma. Just as Tripitaka was beginning to whimper, Monkey waved his staff and all the wild beasts scattered like so many rodents. Onward they journeyed to the summit, at which moment Tripitaka chose to say: “I’ve not had anything to eat all day. Go and beg me some food.” “Did you walk up here with your eyes shut?” Monkey responded affably. “This mountain is completely uninhabited. Even if we had money to spend, there’d be no one to sell us food.” Tripitaka now turned petulant. “Are you forgetting who rescued you from that stone casket beneath the Mountain of Two Frontiers? You owe me, Monkey! Get me something to eat before this pestilential mountain finishes me off.”","Monkey looked after the Tang Priest as they headed West. They had been travelling for several days in the twelfth month of the year, with its freezing North winds and biting cold. Their path wound along overhanging precipices and steep cliffs, and they crossed range after range of dangerous mountains. One day Sanzang heard the sound of water as he rode along, and he turned around to shout, “Monkey, where's that sound of water coming from?” “As I remember, this place is called Eagle's Sorrow Gorge in the Coiled Snake Mountain. It must be the water in the gorge.” Before he had finished speaking, the horse reached the edge of the gorge. Sanzang reined in and looked. He saw: A thin cold stream piercing the clouds, Deep, clear waves shining red in the sun. The sound shakes the night rain and is heard in the quiet valley, Its color throws up a morning haze that obscures the sky. A thousand fathoms of flying waves spit jade; The torrent's roar howls in the fresh wind. The current leads to the misty waves of the sea; The egret and the cormorant never meet by a fisherman. As master and disciple watched they heard a noise in the gorge as a dragon emerged from the waves, leapt up the cliff, and grabbed at Sanzang. In his alarm Monkey dropped the luggage, lifted Sanzang off his horse, turned, and fled. The dragon, unable to catch him up, swallowed the white horse, saddle and all, at a single gulp, then disappeared once more beneath the surface of the water. Monkey made his master sit down on a high peak and went back to fetch the horse and the luggage. When he found that the horse had gone and only the luggage was left, he carried the luggage up to his master and put it down before him. “Master,” he said, “that damned dragon has disappeared without a trace. It gave our horse such a fright that it ran away.” “However are we going to find the horse, disciple?” “Don't worry, don't worry, wait here while I go and look for it.”"

Bajie said, ""Not to mention the hard work, but it's just that the goblin has been sent to send you across the river. ""That monster's method is an opponent of the old pig. He was in the middle of the battle, and he made a fraudulent defeat, and he rushed to the shore. When he saw his brother holding a stick, he ran away.""

Only that plan is perfect!” Tripitaka said, “How did the battle go with the monster just now?” “He was just about my equal,” said Eight Rules, “and we fought to a draw. But then I feigned defeat and he chased me up to the bank. When he saw Elder Brother lifting his rod, however, he fled.” “So what are we going to do?” asked Tripitaka.",,"Monkey inquired. “I would rather die!” Tripitaka shot back. “She was all over you yesterday,” Monkey pointed out. “Why has she turned on you now?” “She tormented me for half the night,” explained Tripitaka, “but I refused to go near her. When she realized she wouldn’t get anywhere, she tied me up and left me here.” Monkey buzzed back out of the cave and filled Pigsy in on everything. “Excellent!” Pigsy chuckled.","“Don't shout, idiot,” Monkey said with a smile, “don't shout. Let's go back and see our master.” When Pig reached the top of the bank with Monkey, Sanzang bowed to him and said, “You've had a tough time, disciple.” “I wouldn't say that,” Pig replied. “But if we'd captured that evil spirit and made him take you across the river, that would have been the perfect solution.” “How did your battle with the evil spirit go?” Sanzang asked. “He's as good as me,” Pig replied. “When I pretended to be beaten in the fight he chased me to the river's edge; but then he saw elder brother waving his cudgel, so he ran away.” “So what are we going to do?” Sanzang asked."

With a bound, Pilgrim rolled himself toward the west; biting the tip of his tongue, he spat a mouthful of blood on the stone lion, crying, “Change!” It changed into a figure just like himself, all tied up in a bundle.

The three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight diamonds, and four bodhisattvas put their palms together and bowed, and they asked the sun, ""Who is the one who disturbed the peach in the Heavenly Palace?"" The Tathagata said, ""That fellow is a demon monkey from Huaguo Mountain. The crimes are monstrous and indescribable. Even if the gods and generals in the sky can't be subdued, even if Erlang captures them. Laojun uses fire to exercise, but it can't be injured. I stopped fighting and asked him where he came from. He said that he had supernatural powers and would change. Refer to the Five Elements Mountain and seal him down there. The five emperors opened the Jinque Yao Palace, and invited me to sit in chief. The Li Antian Conference thanked me, but he resigned and drove back.""","The tune of this lyric is named “Su Wu at Slow Pace.”11 We shall now tell you about our Sovereign Buddha Tathāgata, who took leave of the Jade Emperor and returned to the Treasure Monastery of Thunderclap. All the three thousand buddhas, the five hundred arhats, the eight diamond kings, and the countless bodhisattvas held temple pennants, embroidered canopies, rare treasures, and immortal flowers, forming an orderly array before the Spirit Mountain and beneath the two Śāla Trees to welcome him. Tathāgata stopped his hallowed cloud and said to them: I have With deepest prajñā12 Looked through the three realms.13 All fundamental nature Will end in extinction Like empty phenomena Existing as nothing. The wily ape’s extirpation, This, none can comprehend. Name, birth, death, and origin Of all forms appear thus. When he had finished speaking, he beamed forth the śārī light,14 which filled the air with forty-two white rainbows, connected end to end from north to south. Seeing this, the crowd bowed down and worshipped. In a little while, Tathāgata gathered together the holy clouds and blessed fog, ascended the lotus platform of the highest rank, and sat down solemnly. Those three thousand buddhas, five hundred arhats, eight diamond kings, and four bodhisattvas folded their hands and drew near. After bowing down, they asked, “The one who caused disturbance in Heaven and ruined the Peach Festival, who was he?” “That fellow,” said Tathāgata, “was a baneful monkey born in the Flower-Fruit Mountain. His wickedness was beyond all bounds and defied description. The divine warriors of the entire Heaven could not bring him to submission. Though Erlang caught him and Laozi tried to refine him with fire, they could not hurt him at all. When I arrived, he was just making an exhibition of his might and prowess in the midst of the thunder deities. When I stopped the fighting and asked about his antecedents, he said that he had magic powers, knowing how to transform himself and how to cloud somersault, which would carry him one hundred and eight thousand miles at a time. I made a wager with him to see whether he could leap clear of my hand. I then grabbed hold of him while my fingers changed into the Mountain of Five Phases, which had him firmly pinned down. The Jade Emperor opened wide the golden doors of the Jade Palace, invited me to sit at the head table, and gave a Banquet for Peace in Heaven to thank me.

Those in the north kill a good deal, but they do so for survival’s sake. They’re rough but not malicious. Though the inhabitants of the west are not first-rate illuminates, they live long, abstemious lives. But the inhabitants of the southern continent, I’m afraid, are a lecherous, wicked, and violent lot, bubbling over with poison and spite.","This lyric poem is set to the tune Su Wu Man. Our story goes on to how our Buddha, the Tathagata, left the Jade Emperor and went back to the Thunder Monastery, where he saw the three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight great Vajrapanis and countless Bodhisattvas standing under the pairs of sala trees at the foot of the Vulture Peak, all holding banners, canopies, jewels and magical flowers. The Tathagata brought his propitious cloud to a halt and addressed them thus: “With my deep insight I surveyed the Three Worlds. The origin of nature Is ultimately emptiness, Like the great void, Containing nothing at all. The subjection of this evil monkey Was a mystery beyond understanding. It is called the beginning of life and death: Such is the appearance of things. When he had spoken a sacred light filled the sky with forty-two rainbows that linked North and South together. All who saw them bowed, and a moment later the Buddha gathered together some felicitous cloud and climbed to the supreme Lotus Throne, where he seated himself in majesty. Then the three thousand Buddhas, the five hundred Arhats, the eight Vajrapanis and the four Bodhisattvas came forward to bow to him with their hands together and ask, “Who was it who wrecked the Heavenly Palace and ruined the Peach Banquet?” “The wretch was a monkey fiend born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit,” the Buddha replied, “whose towering crimes would beggar description. None of the heavenly generals were able to subdue him, and when Lord Lao Zi refined him with fire after Erlang had captured him, he was unharmed. When I went there he was in the middle of the thunder generals, giving a great display of his martial prowess and his spirit. I stopped the fighting and asked him what it was all about. He said that he had divine powers, was able to do transformations, and could ride a somersault cloud for thirty-six thousand miles at a single jump. I made a wager with him that he could not jump out of my hand, then grabbed him, turned my fingers into the Five Elements Mountain, and sealed him under it. The Jade Emperor opened wide the golden gates of the Jade Palace, and invited me to be the guest of honour at a Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven he gave to thank me. After that I took my leave of him and came back here.”"

那阵上李天王早已看见，急欲提兵助战。不觉太子倏至面前，战兢兢报道：“父王！弼马温真个有本事！孩儿这般法力，也战他不过，已被他打伤膊也。”天王大惊失色道：“这厮恁的神通，如何取胜？”太子道：“他洞门外竖一竿，旗上写‘齐天大圣’四字，亲口夸称，教玉帝就封他做齐天大圣，万事俱休；若还不是此号，定要打上灵霄宝殿哩！”天王道：“既然如此，且不要与他相持，且去上界，将此言回奏，再多遣天兵，围捉这厮，未为迟也。”太子负痛，不能复战，故同天王回天启奏不题。,"Li Tianwang had already seen that battle, and he was eager to send troops to help. Unknowingly, the crown prince rushed to the front, and reported tremblingly: ""Father! Ma Wen is really capable! With such magical powers as this child, he can't even fight against him, and he has already injured his arm."" How can this kind of buddy's supernatural powers win?"" The prince said, ""He erected a pole outside the gate of the cave, and the four characters 'Monkey King' was written on the flag. Everything is over; if it is not this number, it will definitely be called the Lingxiao Palace!"" The king said, ""If this is the case, don't hold back with him, go to the upper realm, echo this word, and send more heavenly soldiers to surround and arrest him. This fellow, it's not too late."" The prince was in pain and could not resume the battle, so it was not a question to return to Tianqi with the heavenly king.","Standing in front of his battle line, Devarāja Li saw what was happening and was about to go to his son’s assistance. The prince, however, came to him first and gasped, “Father King! The BanHorsePlague is truly powerful. Even your son of such magical strength is no match for him! He has wounded me in the shoulder.” “If this fellow is so powerful,” said the Devarāja, turning pale with fright, “how can we beat him?” The prince said, “In front of his cave he has set up a banner bearing the words, ‘The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven.’ By his own mouth he boastfully asserted that if the Jade Emperor appointed him to such a title, all troubles would cease. If he were not given this name, he would surely fight his way up to the Treasure Hall of Divine Mists!” “If that’s the case,” said the Devarāja, “let’s not fight with him for the moment. Let us return to the region above and report these words. There will be time then for us to send for more celestial soldiers and take this fellow on all sides.” The prince was in such pain that he could not do battle again; he therefore went back to Heaven with the Devarāja to report, of which we speak no further.","At this Guardian King Li was greatly alarmed, changed color and said, “How can we withstand this kind of magic?” The young prince replied, “Outside his cave there is a flagstaff with a banner on which is written in large letters ‘The Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven.’ This name he boasts, and says that the Jade Emperor must recognize him as an equal, and then there will be no trouble at all. If the Jade Emperor refuses, then he will certainly fight, even up to the Court of Heaven.” Guardian King Li said, “Since matters are so bad, on no account have anything to do with him just now, but let us return to Heaven and report and ask for more legions to subdue him.” So they departed for Heaven. The Monkey King, after his victory, returned to the Mountain Garden, and the seventy-two demon kings and the six brothers all came to congratulate him.","Having seen everything from the front of his battle formation, King Li was about to rush into the fray himself when Nezha pulled him back. “This stable hand does know a thing or two about fighting. He even managed to wound me on the shoulder.” “How can we possibly defeat him?” Nezha’s father quailed. “He’s planted a banner outside his cave, declaring that he is the Great Sage Equal to Heaven,” explained Nezha. “If the emperor gives him that job, he says he’ll agree to a truce. If not, he’ll take his fight to the emperor’s throne room.” “Let’s pass his ultimatum on to the emperor,” King Li ruled.","He brought his magic to an end, put his six weapons away, reverted to his true appearance, and abandoned the field of battle in defeat. This had all been observed by Heavenly King Li, who was on the point of sending reinforcements when his son appeared before him and reported in fear and trembling, “Father, the Protector of the Horses is very powerful. My magic was outclassed and he has wounded me in the shoulder.” The color drained from the face of the horror-struck Heavenly King as he said, “If the creature has magic powers like that, how are we going to defeat him?” “Outside the gates of the cave,” the prince went on to report, “there is a banner on a pole that reads 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven'. He bragged that if the Jade Emperor gave him this title he would call everything off; otherwise he said he would attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist.” “In that case,” said the Heavenly King, “we'll disengage now, go back to Heaven, and request that more heavenly troops be sent to capture this wretch. There is plenty of time.” The prince, in pain and unable to go on fighting, went back to Heaven with the Heavenly King and put in this request, but of that no more for the moment."
那二圣得了旨，径到灵山胜境，雷音宝刹之前，对四金刚、八菩萨礼毕，即烦转达。众神随至宝莲台下启知，如来召请。二圣礼佛三匝，侍立台下。如来问：“玉帝何事，烦二圣下凡？”二圣即启道：“向时花果山产一猴，在那里弄神通，聚众猴搅乱世界。玉帝降招安旨，封为‘弼马温’，他嫌官小反去。当遣李天王、哪吒太子擒拿未获，复招安他，封做‘齐天大圣’，先有官无禄。着他代管蟠桃园；他即偷桃；又走至瑶池，偷肴，偷酒，搅乱大会；仗酒又暗入兜率宫，偷老君仙丹，反出天宫。玉帝复遣十万天兵，亦不能收伏。后观世音举二郎真君同他义兄弟追杀，他变化多端，亏老君抛金钢琢打重，二郎方得拿住。解赴御前，即命斩之。刀砍斧剁，火烧雷打，俱不能伤，老君准奏领去，以火煅炼。四十九日开鼎，他却又跳出八卦炉，打退天丁，径入通明殿里，灵霄殿外；被佑圣真君的佐使王灵官挡住苦战，又调三十六员雷将，把他困在垓心，终不能相近。事在紧急，因此，玉帝特请如来救驾。”如来闻说，即对众菩萨道：“汝等在此稳坐法庭，休得乱了禅位，待我炼魔救驾去来。”,"Those two sages received the decree and went straight to the victorious realm of Lingshan Mountain, before the Precious Shrine of Thunder Sound, and after bowing to the Four Vajras and the Eight Bodhisattvas, they immediately conveyed their troubles. The gods followed to the Baolian platform to enlighten, and the Tathagata invited him. The second sacrament of the Buddha three times, standing under the stage. The Tathagata asked: ""What's the matter with the Jade Emperor, bothering the two saints to go down to earth?"" The two saints immediately said: ""Xiangshi Huaguo Mountain gave birth to a monkey, where he used supernatural powers, and gathered all the monkeys to disturb the world. Ma Wen', he suspected that the official was small and turned away. When he sent Li Tianwang and Prince Nezha to capture him, he re-hired Anta and made him the 'Great Sage of Equaling Heaven'. That is, steal peaches; go to Yaochi, steal food, steal wine, and disrupt the conference; fight wine and secretly enter the Tusita Palace, steal Laojun's elixir, and go out of the Heavenly Palace. The Jade Emperor even sent 100,000 heavenly soldiers, but he could not be subdued. Ju Erlang Zhenjun and his righteous brother chased and killed him. He changed a lot, but because Laojun threw gold, steel, and diamonds, Erlang had to hold it. Xie went to the imperial front, and ordered him to be executed. Knife, axe, fire, thunder, etc. Can't be hurt, Lao Jun is allowed to play and lead him to forge with fire. When the cauldron opened on the forty-ninth day, he jumped out of the gossip furnace, beat Tian Ding, and entered the Tongming Hall and outside the Lingxiao Hall; His assistant, Wang Lingguan, blocked the hard fight, and dispatched thirty-six generals of thunder to trap him in Gaixin, and he could not be approached in the end. The matter is urgent, so the Jade Emperor specially invited the Tathagata to rescue him."" The Tathagata heard it, and said to the bodhisattvas. : ""You are sitting here firmly in the courtroom, resting your meditation position, waiting for me to come and rescue me.""","The two sages received the decree and went straight to the Spirit Mountain. After they had greeted the Four Vajra-Buddhas and the Eight Bodhisattvas in front of the Treasure Temple of Thunderclap, they asked them to announce their arrival. The deities therefore went before the Treasure Lotus Platform and made their report. Tathāgata at once invited them to appear before him, and the two sages made obeisance to the Buddha three times before standing in attendance beneath the platform. Tathāgata asked, “What causes the Jade Emperor to trouble the two sages to come here?” The two sages explained as follows: “ Some time ago there was born on the Flower-Fruit Mountain a monkey who exercised his magic powers and gathered to himself a troop of monkeys to disturb the world. The Jade Emperor threw down a decree of pacification and appointed him a Bimawen, but he despised the lowliness of that position and left in rebellion. Devarāja Li and Prince Naṭa were sent to capture him, but they were unsuccessful, and another proclamation of amnesty was given to him. He was then made the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, a rank without compensation. After a while he was given the temporary job of looking after the Garden of Immortal Peaches, where almost immediately he stole the peaches. He also went to the Jasper Pool and made off with the food and wine, devastating the Grand Festival. Half-drunk, he went secretly into the Tushita Palace, stole the elixir of Laozi, and then left the Celestial Palace in revolt. Again the Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand Heavenly soldiers, but he was not to be subdued. Thereafter Guanyin sent for the Immortal Master Erlang and his sworn brothers, who fought and pursued him. Even then he knew many tricks of transformation, and only after he was hit by Laozi’s diamond snare could Erlang finally capture him. Taken before the Throne, he was condemned to be executed; but, though slashed by a scimitar and hewn by an ax, burned by fire and struck by thunder, he was not hurt at all. After Laozi had received royal permission to take him away, he was refined by fire, and the brazier was not opened until the forty-ninth day. Immediately he jumped out of the Brazier of Eight Trigrams and beat back the celestial guardians. He penetrated into the Hall of Perfect Light and was approaching the Hall of Divine Mists when Numinous Officer Wang, aide to the Immortal Master of Adjuvant Holiness, met and fought with him bitterly. Thirty-six thunder generals were ordered to encircle him completely, but they could never get near him. The situation is desperate, and for this reason, the Jade Emperor sent a special request for you to defend the Throne.” When Tathāgata heard this, he said to the various bodhisattvas, “All of you remain steadfast here in the chief temple, and let no one relax his meditative posture. I have to go exorcise a demon and defend the Throne.”","As soon as these two officials received this command, they went to a grand service in the Spiritual Mountain in the West where Buddha’s Temple was. There they paid their respects to the four Temple Guardians and the Eight Bodhisattvas and begged them to announce them. These led the officials to the Precious Lotus Terrace, saying, “Lord Buddha invites you two officials to see him. Go three times round in procession and wait. Lord Buddha asks what the Jade Emperor wishes by sending you here.” The two officials told the story of the Great Sage from beginning to end and added, “The matter at present is very urgent and the Jade Emperor invites Lord Buddha to come to the rescue.” On hearing this, Buddha spoke to all the other Buddhas Past and Future and said, “All of you sit here in this temple hall, while I go and tame the demon and ease the Jade Emperor’s mind.”","“Put down your weapons,” the Buddha ordered the thunder gods, “and tell the Great Sage to come and talk to me.” After receiving the message, Monkey walked cantankerously over to the Buddha. “Who are you? Can’t you see I’m in the middle of a battle?” The Buddha laughed.","When these two sages received the order they went to the wonderful land of the Miraculous Mountain, where they offered their greetings to the Four Vajrapanis and Eight Bodhisattvas before the Thunder Monastery and asked them to pass on their massage. The gods went to the foot of the lotus seat to inform the Tathagata, who invited the two sages to his presence. When the sages had performed the threefold obeisance to the Buddha they stood in attendance below the throne. “Why has the Jade Emperor troubled you two sages to come here?” asked the Buddha. “A monkey,” they reported, “who was born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, has used his magic powers to unite all the monkeys and throw the world into confusion. The Jade Emperor sent down an edict of amnesty and appointed him Protector of the Horses, but this was not good enough for him, so he left Heaven again. When heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha were unsuccessful in their attempt to capture him the Jade Emperor sent down another amnesty with his appointment as a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven'. At first this appointment was purely nominal, but later he was told to look after the Peach Orchard. But he stole the peaches and then went to the Jade Pool where he stole the delicacies and the liquor and wrecked the banquet. In his drunkenness he staggered into the Tushita Palace, stole Lord Lao Zi's pills of immortality, and left Heaven again. The Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand heavenly troops, but they were still unable to subdue him. Then Guanyin recommended the True Lord Erlang and his sworn brothers to go after the monkey, and he used many a transformation until he was finally able to capture the monkey after the Lord Lao Zi hit him with his Diamond Jade. The monkey was then taken to the imperial presence, and the order for his execution was given. But although he was hacked at with sabres, chopped at with axes, burned with fire, and struck with thunder, none of this did him any damage; so Lord Lao Zi requested permission to take him away and refine him with fire. But when the cauldron was opened after forty-nine days he jumped out of the Eight Trigrams Furnace, routed the heavenly troops, and went straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness in front of the Hall of Miraculous Mist. Here he has been stopped and engaged in fierce combat by the Kingly Spirit Officer, the lieutenant of the Helpful Sage and True Lord Erlang, thunder generals have been sent there to encircle him; but no one has been able to get close to him. In this crisis the Jade Emperor makes a special appeal to you, the Tathagata, to save his throne.” On hearing this the Tathagata said to the assembled Bodhisattvas, “You stay here quietly in this dharma hall and behave yourselves in your seats of meditation while I go to deal with the demon and save the throne.”"
却说殷小姐痛恨刘贼，恨不食肉寝皮，只因身怀有孕，未知男女，万不得已，权且勉强相从。转盼之间，不觉已到江州。,"However, she said that Miss Yin hated Liu Thief and hated eating meat and sleeping skin, just because she was pregnant, she didn't know the sex, she had no choice but to obey. While looking forward to it, I didn't realize that I had arrived in Jiangzhou.","We now tell you that Lady Yin hated the bandit Liu so bitterly that she wished she could devour his flesh and sleep on his skin! But because she was with child and did not know whether it would be a boy or a girl, she had no alternative but to yield reluctantly to her captor.

The Jade Emperor's nephew, the Emperor Zhaohui Ling Wang Erlang is also enshrined. Today, I have been ordered to capture you, the Bima Wenhou, who rebelled against the Heavenly Palace. You still don't know whether to live or die!"" The Great Sage said, ""I remember the Jade Emperor's sister, Sifan, in the lower realm. Cooperate with Yang Jun, give birth to a man, and used an axe to smash Taoshan, is it you? I will scold you a few times, but I have no grievances, and I will hit you with a blow, but it will be a pity for your life. Junior, you can hurry back and call you the Four Heavenly Kings to come out."" Hearing the words, the true monarch was furious in his heart: ""Splashing monkeys! Don't be rude! Eat my knife!"" , split hands. The two of them are good kills:","His lofty mind scorned being high Heaven ’s kin; His pride led him to dwell near Libations Stream. From Chi City here’s the kind heroic sage:4 Of boundless epiphanies, he’s named Erlang. When the Great Sage saw him, he lifted high his golden-hooped rod with gales of laughter and called out, “What little warrior are you and where do you come from, that you dare present yourself here to provoke battle?” “You must have eyes but no pupils,” shouted the Immortal Master, “if you don’t recognize me! I am the maternal nephew of the Jade Emperor, Erlang, the King of Illustrious Grace and Spirit by imperial appointment. I have received my order from above to arrest you, the rebellious Bimawen ape. Don’t you know that your time has come?” “I remember,” said the Great Sage, “that the sister of the Jade Emperor some years ago became enamored of the Region Below; she married a man by the name of Yang and had a son by him.5 Are you that boy who was reputed to have cleaved open the Peach Mountain with his ax? I would like to rebuke you roundly, but I have no grudge against you. I can hit you with this rod of mine too, but I’d like to spare your life! A little boy like you, why don’t you hurry back and ask your Four Great Devarājas to come out?” When the Immortal Master heard this, he grew very angry and shouted, “Reckless ape! Don’t you dare be so insolent! Take a sample of my blade!” Swerving to dodge the blow, the Great Sage quickly raised his golden-hooped rod to engage his opponent. What a fine fight there was between the two of them:","When the Great Sage saw him, he smiled inwardly and lifted his steel club and shouted out, “What minor general are you who dares to come and fight with me?” The Divine Kinsman shouted back, “You foolish fellow, you seem to have eyes, but cannot see. Do you not know me? I am the Divine Kinsman of the Jade Emperor, come here by order to take you. But you, foolish one, defy us and do not know what is good for you.” The Great Sage said, “Now I remember the Jade Emperor’s sister had an idea of coming down to earth to marry a certain Mr. Yang. They had a son who used to go to Peach Mountain with a hatchet in his hand. Can you be this one? Well, sir, I will not fight you. Go back quickly and tell your Four Great Guardians of Heaven to come forth.” The Divine Kinsman, hearing this, was very angry, and said, “You wretched monkey, do not be so foolish. Take a cut from my sword.” The Great Sage raised his steel club and the two fought with all their might.","“What a question!” roared Erlang. “I am Erlang, maternal nephew of the Jade Emperor, King of Extremely Obvious Brilliance by Imperial Appointment. I’m here on His Majesty’s orders, you mutinous macaque, to bring you to justice. Lost the will to live yet?” “I do have a vague memory,” Monkey mused, “of the Jade Emperor’s marriage to a mortal by the name of Yang. I presume you’re their undersized offspring. One touch of my staff will turn you into pip-squeak pâté, but I bear you no grudge and I’d like to spare your life. Off you trot now. Tell your Four Heavenly Kings to come instead.”","His heart was too lofty to acknowledge his relatives in Heaven; In his pride he went back to be a god at Guanjiang. He was the Merciful and Miraculous Sage of the red city, Erlang, whose transformations were numberless. When the Great Sage saw him he laughed with delight, raised his gold-banded cudgel, and shouted, “Where are you from, little general, that you have the audacity to challenge me?” “You must be blind, you wretch, if you can't recognize me. I am the nephew of the Jade Emperor, and my title is Merciful and Miraculous King Erlang. I am here on imperial orders to arrest you, Protector of the Horses, you rebel against Heaven, you reckless baboon.” “Now I remember who you are,” replied the Great Sage. “Some years ago the Jade Emperor's younger sister wanted to be mortal and came down to the lower world, where she married a Mr. Yang and gave birth to a son, who split the Peach Mountain open with his axe. Is that who you are? I should really fling you a few curses, but I've got no quarrel with you; and it would be a pity to kill you by hitting you with my cudgel. So why don't you hurry back, young sir, and tell those four Heavenly Kings of yours to come out?” When the True Lord Erlang heard this he burst out angrily, “Damned monkey! Where are your manners? Try this blade of mine!” The Great Sage dodged the blow and instantly raised his gold-banded club to hit back. There was a fine battle between the two of them:"
诗曰：大有唐王降敕封，钦差玄奘问禅宗。坚心磨琢寻龙穴，着意修持上鹫峰。边界远游多少国，云山前度万千重。自今别驾投西去，秉教迦持悟大空。却说三藏自贞观十三年九月望前三日，蒙唐王与多官送出长安关外。一二日马不停蹄，早至法门寺。本寺住持上房长老，带领众僧有五百余人，两边罗列，接至里面，相见献茶。茶罢进斋，斋后不觉天晚，正是那：影动星河近，月明无点尘。雁声鸣远汉，砧韵响西邻。归鸟栖枯树，禅僧讲梵音。蒲团一榻上，坐到夜将分。众僧们灯下议论佛门定旨，上西天取经的原由。有的说水远山高，有的说路多虎豹，有的说峻岭陡崖难度，有的说毒魔恶怪难降。三藏钳口不言，但以手指自心，点头几度。众僧们莫解其意，合掌请问道：“法师指心点头者，何也？”三藏答曰：“心生，种种魔生；心灭，种种魔灭。我弟子曾在化生寺对佛设下洪誓大愿，不由我不尽此心。这一去，定要到西天，见佛求经，使我们法轮回转，愿圣主皇图永固。”众僧闻得此言，人人称羡，个个宣扬，都叫一声“忠心赤胆大阐法师”，夸赞不尽，请师入榻安寐。,"The poem says: There is a great Tang king who sent an imperial edict and sent Xuanzang to inquire about the Zen sect. Deliberately honing in on the search for the Dragon's Cave, and deliberately cultivating the peak of Jiufeng. How many countries have the borders traveled far, the clouds and mountains are thousands of times. From now on, don't drive to the west, and teach Jia Chi Wu Dakong. However, it is said that three days before Sanzang was seen in September of the thirteenth year of Zhenguan, King Mengtang and many officials sent them out of Chang'an Pass. On a day or two, I went to Famen Temple as early as possible. The abbot of the monastery, the elder Shangfang, led more than 500 monks. After tea, we enter the fast, and after fasting, we do not realize that it is too late, which is exactly that: the shadows are moving close to the galaxy, and the moon is bright without a speck of dust. The sound of wild geese sings in the distant Han, and the rhythm of anvil resounds to the west. Returning to the dead tree, Zen monks speak Sanskrit. On the futon, sit until the night. The monks discussed under the lamp the decree of Buddhism and the reason for going to the west to obtain scriptures. Some say that the water is far and the mountains are high, some say that there are many tigers and leopards on the road, some say that the mountains and cliffs are difficult, and some say that poisonous demons and monsters are difficult to descend. Sanzang Jaw didn't say anything, but with his fingers, he nodded several times. The monks couldn't understand the meaning, they put their palms together and asked: ""The Master points to the heart and nods, why?"" Sanzang replied: ""When the heart is born, all kinds of demons are born; when the heart is destroyed, all kinds of demons are destroyed. The Buddha made a great vow, and I can't help not fulfilling my heart. When I go, I will definitely go to the West Heaven to see the Buddha and ask for scriptures, so that our Dharma wheel will turn around, and may the holy master and emperor's image be forever."" Hearing this, the monks said, Everyone is envied, and all of them are called ""loyal and bold to explain the master"", and they are full of praise.","At Double-Fork Ridge, Boqin detains the monk. The rich Tang ruler issued a decree, Deputing Xuanzang to seek the source of Chan. He bent his mind to find the Dragon Den, With firm resolve to climb the Vulture Peak.1 Through how many states did he roam beyond his own? Through clouds and hills he passed ten thousand times. He now leaves the throne to go to the West; He’ll keep law and faith to reach the Great Void. We shall now tell you about Tripitaka, who, on the third day before the fifteenth of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of the period Zhenguan, was sent off by the Tang emperor and many officials from outside the gate of Chang’an. For a couple of days his horse trotted without ceasing, and soon they reached the Temple of the Law Gate. The abbot of that temple led some five hundred monks on both sides to receive him and took him inside. As they met, tea was served, after which a vegetarian meal was presented. Soon after the meal, dusk fell, and thus Shadows moved to the Star River’s nearing pulse; The moon was bright without a speck of dust. The wild geese called from the distant sky, And washing flails beat from nearby homes. As birds returned to perch on withered trees, The Chan monks conversed in their Sanskrit tones. On rush mats placed upon a single bunk, They sat until halfway through the night. Beneath the lamps the various monks discussed Buddhist doctrines and the purpose of seeking scriptures in the Western Heaven. Some pointed out that the waters were wide and the mountains very high; others mentioned that the roads were crowded with tigers and leopards; still others maintained that the precipitous peaks were difficult to scale; and another group insisted that the vicious monsters were hard to subdue. Tripitaka, however, kept his mouth shut tightly, but he pointed with his finger to his own heart and nodded his head several times. Not perceiving what he meant, the various monks folded their hands and asked, “Why did the Master of the Law point to his heart and nod his head?” “When the mind is active,” Tripitaka replied, “all kinds of māra come into existence; when the mind is extinguished, all kinds of māra will be extinguished. This disciple has already made an important vow before Buddha in the Temple of Transformation, and he has no alternative but to fulfill it with his whole heart. If I go, I shall not turn aside until I have reached the Western Heaven, seen Buddha, and acquired the scriptures so that the Wheel of the Law will be turned to us2 and the kingdom of our lord will be secured forever.” When the various monks heard this statement, everyone congratulated and commended him, saying, “A loyal and valiant master!” They praised him unceasingly as they escorted him to bed.","The Doorman of Hell therefore said to them both, “Since you are identical in form and appearance, and have exactly the same magic powers, I advise you to go to Shakyamuni and let him decide for you.” Thus the Gates of Hell were opened, and the two eagerly went to see Shakyamuni. A double-minded man gets into trouble, On land and sea he is in the midst of doubt, Trusting in his fine horse and three faithful servants, Relying on magic spears and highest service. In North and South without success, In East and West troubles rise. Seeking heaven you must sacrifice your own will, Then there is new birth and growth into a saint. The two Suns pressed and fought on, till they came to the Assembly of the Sages, where were the four great bodhisattvas, hundreds of arhats and innumerable other holy disciples, whom the Buddha had taught of the transcendental mysteries of Universal Law. Lord Buddha said to the Assembly, “You are all of one mind. Now behold the double minded ones!” The two Suns quarreled fiercely, each claiming the same thing, and asked Lord Buddha to decide. He said, “There are but five classes of Immortals in the Universe: those of heaven, those of earth, those of gods, those of men, those of spirits. There are but five classes of creatures: men, fish, hairy creatures, feathered creatures and worms. These two Suns do not belong to any of these ten classes, but to the four classes of monkeys. 1. The first is the clever stone monkey, that knows magic, knows the times and seasons, and knows the treasures of earth and sky.","“Oh, and could you lend me a needle and thread?” the freshly bathed Monkey continued. The old man quickly produced these items. Monkey slipped on the white shirt that Tripitaka had been wearing before his bath, neatly hemmed the bottom of the tiger-skin kilt, and tied it around his waist once more with the piece of vine. “How do I look?” he asked Tripitaka, parading about the room. “Never better!” applauded the monk. “If you don’t mind wearing secondhand things, you’re welcome to keep that shirt.” “Thanks!” sang Monkey. “This has been easily the best day I’ve had in half a millennium.” And once he had found some hay for the horse, the entire household retired to bed. The next day after breakfast, the two set out once more. On they went for months, traveling by day and resting at night, until one day in early winter six men jumped out at them from the side of the road, armed with spears, swords, and bows, and shouting, “Your money or your life!” Dumb with fear, Tripitaka tumbled off the horse. Monkey picked him up off the ground. “Don’t worry, Master. These nice men have come to give us all their clothes and money.” “Is there something wrong with your hearing?”","On Double-Forked Peak Boqin Entertains the Priest The Great Tang Emperor issued an edict Sending Sanzang to learn the Dhyana teachings. With firmness and patience he seeks the dragon's lair, Determined to carry on till he climbs the Vulture Peak. On his long journey he will visit many a country; Thousands of cloud-capped mountains lie before him. Now he leaves the Emperor and sets out for the West Cleaving to the faith, and aware of the Great Void. It has been told already how Sanzang was seen off at the checkpoint outside Chang'an by the Tang Emperor and a host of officials on the twelfth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of Zhen Guan. For two days his horse's hoofs were never still, and he soon reached the Fa Men Monastery, where the abbot came out to meet him at the head of five hundred and more monks drawn up in two lines. Taking Sanzang inside, he greeted him, offered him tea, and then gave him a monastic meal. By the time the meal was over night had fallen. As it approached the Milky Way, The moon was free from any dust. The wild goose called to the distant traveler, While washing-boards could be heard by neighbors. Roosting birds perch in the withered trees; The dhyana monks chant Sanskrit music. On their seats with hassocks of rushes They sit until the middle of the night. In the lamplight the monks were discussing the true teachings of the Buddhist faith and the reasons for going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. Some said that there would be wide rivers and high mountains to cross, some that there would be many a tiger and leopard along the way, some that the lofty ranges and cliffs would be hard to cross, and some that there would be evil demons and foul fiends difficult to subdue. Sanzang kept his lips sealed; he said nothing, only pointing to his heart and nodding occasionally. The monks, unable to understand what he meant, put their hands together and asked, “Why do you point to your heart and nod your head, Master?” “When the heart and mind live,” Sanzang replied, “every kind of evil lives; but when they are extinguished, evil is extinguished too. I made a great vow to the Buddha in the Huasheng Monastery that if I failed to achieve this mission it would not be for lack of trying. I am determined to reach the Western Heaven, where I may see the Buddha and ask for the scriptures, so that the Wheel of the Law may revolve, and our sage Emperor enjoy eternal security.” On hearing his words the monks all expressed their admiration, saying as if with one voice, “What a loyal and brave Hierarch.” With praises still on their lips they invited the Master to go to bed and wished him a peaceful night's sleep."

""Frightened a civilian and military general to panic, and the queen's concubines were terrified. The faces are like yellow mulberry leaves after autumn, and the waist is like tender wicker before spring. The prince's feet are weak, and it is difficult to hold the mourning staff to perform his mourning ceremony; The concubines fell, and the colorful girl slanted. The concubine fell, but it was like a gust of wind blowing down and defeating the lotus; the colorful girl slanted, like a shower rushing to the crooked Jiaohan. The ministers were frightened, their bones were soft and tendons numb. Trembling and trembling, crazy. A White Tiger Hall is like a broken beam bridge, and a mourning platform is like a collapsed temple. At this time, all the palace people were gone, and the one who dared to approach the spirit to help the coffin. Thanks to the upright Xu Maogong, the prudent Prime Minister Wei, the courageous Qin Qiong, and the fierce Jingde, they stepped forward to support the coffin and shouted, ""Your Majesty has something that you can't put down, say wait with me, don't be a ghost. , terrified the family."" Wei Zheng said: ""It's not a ghost, this is His Majesty's revival. Quickly retrieve the equipment!"" When he opened the lid of the coffin, he saw Taizong sitting inside, and shouted, ""I'm dead! Who rescued me?"" Mao Gong and others stepped forward to help him up and said: ""Don't be afraid of your Majesty's awakening, the ministers and others are here to escort them."" Tang Wang just opened his eyes and said, ""I have been suffering very recently, and I have escaped the evil ghosts of the underworld, and I have been killed by the water. The ministers said: ""Your Majesty, don't be afraid, what kind of flood is coming?""","“To tell you the truth, Mr. Xu,” said Wei Zheng, “I have been instructed since my youth in the arts of immortality. My calculations are most accurate, and I promise you that His Majesty will not die.” As they were talking, they suddenly heard a loud voice crying in the coffin, “You’ve drowned me! You’ve drowned me!” It so startled the civil and military officials, and so terrified the queen and the ladies, that every one of them had A face brown as autumnal mulberry leaves, A body limp as the willow of early spring. The legs of the crown prince buckled, He could not hold the mourning staff to finish his rites. The soul of the steward left him, He could not wear the mourning cap to show his grief The matrons collapsed; The ladies pitched sideways; The matrons collapsed Like weak hibiscus blasted by savage wind. The ladies pitched sideways Like lilies overwhelmed by sudden rain. The petrified lords— Their bones and tendons feeble— Trembled and shook, All dumb and awestruck. The whole White Tiger Hall was like a bridge with broken beams; The funeral stage resembled a temple wrecked. Every person attending the court ran away, and no one dared approach the coffin. Only the upright Xu Mougong, the rational Prime Minister Wei, the courageous Qin Qiong, and the impulsive Jingde came forward and took hold of the coffin. “Your Majesty,” they cried, “if there’s something bothering you, tell us about it. Don’t play ghost and terrify your relatives!” Then, however, Wei Zheng said, “He’s not playing ghost. His Majesty is coming back to life! Get some tools, quick!” They opened the top of the coffin and saw indeed that Taizong was sitting up inside, still shouting, “You’ve drowned me! Who bailed me out?” Mougong and the rest of them went forward to lift him up, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Your Majesty, and wake up. Your subjects are here to protect you.” Only then did the Tang emperor open his eyes and say, “How I suffered just now! I barely escaped attack by spiteful demons from the Region of Darkness, only to encounter death by drowning!” “Have no fear, Your Majesty,” said the ministers. “What kind of calamity occurred in the water?”","Zhu Bajie replied, “I am not heartless. Brother Sun said he can make the dead live. Do you think I would have troubled to carry the dead corpse here, if he had not said so?” The Master then called for Sun and told him to restore the dead to life. “It is better to save a man’s life than to build a seven storied pagoda!” Sun replied, “Why do you believe that fool’s talk? When a man dies, his soul returns only in the third week, the fifth week and the seventh week, but never after. This man has been dead for three years; how can you expect him to live again?” The Master assented. But Zhu Bajie became angry and cried, “Do not be deceived by Sun. He is quite able to restore the dead to life if he should so choose. Recite the incantation to cause the spikes of his cap of spikes to pierce his head, and make him restore this man to life!” So the Master recited the incantation, and the Monkey’s eyes became swollen and his head began to feel great pain. The Great Sage suffered such terrible pain in his head that he begged the Master not to repeat the incantation any more, as he could not endure the pain. “I will make the dead live!” The Master said, “How can you do that?” Sun replied, “I will descend to hell, and beg that the king’s spirit be allowed to return to his body.” But Zhu Bajie said, “If you cannot give life to him without yourself descending to hell, where is your power? Master, do not let him deceive you. Go on, repeat the incantation.” Sun, feeling the great pain again, said, “I can save him without going to hell.” The Master said: And how can you do that?”","Just as one of Wei Zheng’s colleagues was countering that spilled water was lost forever, a cry came from inside the casket: “You’re drowning me!” The entire court fled for cover except for Wei Zheng and three ministers who plucked up the courage to engage with the coffin. “Is there something bothering Your Majesty? Coffin drapes not to your liking perhaps?” “What did I tell you?” exclaimed Wei Zheng. “He’s coming back to life!” The lid was lifted to reveal the emperor sitting up inside, still shouting about being drowned. “Don’t worry, Your Majesty,” the brave ministers reassured him. “We’re here now. What’s wrong?”","“Mr. Xu,” Wei Zheng replied, “I can say truthfully that I have been given instruction in the magic arts since childhood and my predictions are extremely accurate. I can assure you that I have saved His Majesty from death.” As they were arguing they heard loud shouts of “You're drowning me, you're drowning me,” coming from the coffin. The civil officials and the generals were struck with terror; the empresses and consorts shivered. Every one of them had A face as yellow as a mulberry-leaf after autumn, A waist as weak as a willow sapling before spring. The heir went weak at the knees, As he stood in full mourning, unable to hold up his staff; The attendants' souls flew away: How would it do for them to be wearing mourning hats and clothes? The consorts and concubines collapsed, The palace beauties had to lie down. When the consorts and concubines collapsed, It was like a gale blowing down withered lotuses. When the palace beauties lay down It was like a rainstorm beating young lotuses down. All the ministers were terrified And their limbs went numb; They shivered and shook, Struck dumb and stupid. The White Tiger Hall was like a bridge collapsing, And the confusion round the coffin Was like a temple falling down. All the palace women fled, as not one of them dared to approach the imperial coffin. Luckily the upright Xu Maogong, the trusty Wei Zheng, the brave Qin Shubao, and the ferocious Yuchi Jingde went forward to put their hands on the coffin and shouted, “What is it that worries Your Majesty and makes you speak to us? Tell us, and do not haunt us and scare the royal family.” “His Majesty is not haunting us,” Wei Zheng said. “His Majesty has come back to life. Bring tools at once.” They opened the coffin and found Taizong sitting up inside and still shouting, “You're drowning me. Save me, someone.” Xu Maogong and the others helped him to his feet and said, “There is nothing to fear as you come round, Your Majesty. We are all here to protect you.” The Tang Emperor then opened his eyes and said, “We have been having an awful time: after escaping from the evil demons of the underworld, we were drowned.” “Relax, Your Majesty, there is nothing to fear. How could you have drowned?” the ministers said."
“你这老儿不知分限。那怪也曾对我说，他虽是食肠大，吃了你家些茶饭，他与你干了许多好事。这几年挣了许多家资，皆是他之力量。他不曾白吃了你东西，问你祛他怎的。据他说，他是一个天神下界，替你巴家做活，又未曾害了你家女儿。想这等一个女婿，也门当户对，不怎么坏了家声，辱了行止，当真的留他也罢。”老高道：“长老，虽是不伤风化，但名声不甚好听。,"""You old man don't know the limit. That monster once said to me that although he is a big eater and eats some tea and rice from your family, he has done a lot of good things with you. He has earned a lot of money in the past few years, and it's all about him. He never ate your food for nothing, and asked you how to get rid of him. According to him, he was a god from the lower realm who worked for your Ba family and never harmed your daughter. Thinking of such a son-in-law, Yemen is right , it doesn’t hurt the family’s reputation and humiliates the behavior, it’s worth keeping him seriously.” Lao Gao said: “Elder, although he is not offensive, his reputation is not very good.","“Aren’t you being rather demanding, old man?” said Pilgrim, laughing. “That monster did tell me that, although he has an enormous appetite and has consumed a good deal of food and drink from your family, he has also done a lot of good work for you. Much of what you were able to accumulate these last few years you owe to his strength, so that he really hasn’t taken any free meals from you. Why ever do you want to have him driven away? According to him, he is a god who has come down to earth and who has helped your family earn a living. Moreover, he has not harmed your daughter in any way. Such a son-in-law, I should think, would be a good match for your daughter and your family. So, what’s all this about ruining your family’s reputation and damaging your standing in the community? Why not really accept him as he is?” “Honored Priest,” said old Mr. Gao, “though this matter may not offend public morals, it does leave us with a bad name.",,"“In order of seniority: Tiger-Strength Great Immortal, Deer-Strength Great Immortal, and Goat-Strength Great Immortal. They can summon the wind and the rain as easily as turning over their hands. If they point at water, it turns into oil; stones become gold. The awestruck king worships them.” “May I meet these famous Taoists?” “Of course—as easy as blowing away ashes.","“You've got no sense of what's proper, old man,” replied Monkey with a grin. “He told me that although he may have put away a lot of your rice and tea, he's also done you a lot of good. You've piled up a lot of wealth in the past few years, all thanks to his efforts. He says he hasn't been eating your food in idleness, and wants to know why you're trying to have him exorcised. He maintains that he is a heavenly Immortal come down to earth who has been working for your family and has never harmed your daughter. I would say that he is a very fitting son-in-law for you, who does your family's name no harm. You really ought to keep him.” “Venerable sir,” the old man replied, “he may never have done anything wicked, but it does our reputation no good to have a son-in-law like him."

He is the only monster spirit around here.” “How far is the mountain from here?” asked Pilgrim. “Only twenty miles,” said the abbot. “The peak that you can see right now is where it is.” Pilgrim laughed and said, “Relax, Master! No need for further discussion; it must have been stolen by the black monster.” “That place is about twenty miles away,” said Tripitaka. “How can you be so sure that it was he?” “You didn’t see last night’s fire,” said Pilgrim, “when its light illuminated great distances, and its brightness penetrated the Threefold Heaven. Not just for twenty miles, but for two hundred miles around it could be seen. I have no doubt that he saw the brilliant glow of the fire and used that opportunity to come here secretly. When he saw that our cassock was a treasure, he grabbed it in the confusion and left. Let old Monkey go find him.” “Who will care for me while you are gone?” asked Tripitaka.",,"He was not bothered in the slightest. ‘I’ll skin him alive, pull out his tendons, gnaw his bones, and eat his heart!

As anticipated, Monkey began tugging his ears and scratching his cheeks in fury. “Who is this outrageous fiend?” “His name’s Yellow-Robe.” “We’re leaving now,” Monkey declared. “That monster is begging for a beating. I’ll smash him to smithereens, then pick up where I left off here in Flower-Fruit.” “Good idea,” approved Pigsy. “Revenge first, long-term life plans second.” Monkey rushed into the cave and put his pilgrim’s clothes—the silk shirt and the tiger-skin kilt—back on. “Where are you going?” his little monkeys clamored. “Stay with us and enjoy yourself!” “Heaven and earth have fated me to be this monk’s disciple,” Monkey admonished them. “He didn’t really banish me—he just wanted me to have a little holiday. Look after this mountain of ours, and be sure to plant the willows and pines in the right season.","“If you hadn't asked, sir, I'd never have imagined you wanted to know,” the abbot replied. “There is a mountain due South of here called the Black Wind Mountain, and in the Black Wind Cave-on it there lives a Great Black King.

There aren't any other evil spirits apart from him.” “How far is the mountain from here?” Monkey asked. “Only about seven miles,” the abbot replied. “It's the mountain you can see over there.” Monkey smiled and said to Sanzang. “Don't worry, master, there's no need to ask any more questions. No doubt about it: it must have been stolen by that black monster.” “But his place is seven miles from here, so how can you be sure it was him?” Sanzang asked. “You didn't see the fire last night,” Brother Monkey retorted. “The flames were leaping up hundreds of miles high, and the glow penetrated the triple heavens. You could have seen it seventy miles away, let alone seven. I'm convinced that he saw the glare and took the chance to slip over here quietly. When he saw that our cassock was a treasure, he must have stolen it in the confusion. Just wait while I go and find him.” “If you go, who's going to protect me?” asked Sanzang."

My old grandson has traveled a hundred and eight thousand miles in one somersault. His palm is less than a foot in radius, so how can he not jump out?"" With that said, can you do what you want?"" The Buddha said, ""Do it! Do it!"" He stretched out his right hand, but it was the size of a lotus leaf. The great sage took the wishful stick, exhaled his divine power, and stood upright in the palm of the Buddha's hand, but said, ""I'm going out!"" The Buddha looked at it with his eyes and saw that the windmill of the Monkey King couldn't help but move forward. During the Great Sunnah, I suddenly saw five fleshy red pillars supporting a green energy. He said: ""This is the end of the road. This time back, the Tathagata testifies that I will be seated in the Lingxiao Palace."" Then he thought about it and said, ""Stay here! Wait for me to leave some marks before I can talk to the Tathagata."" The next hair, blowing a fairy breath, called ""Change!"" It turned into a tube of thick ink and double hair, and on the middle pillar wrote a line in big words: ""The Great Sage Qitian, come here for a visit."" After writing, receive hairy. Not Zhuang Zun, but sprinkled a bath of monkey urine under the root of the first pillar. Turning somersaults over the clouds, walking back to the place, standing in the Tathagata Palm: ""I've gone, I'm here now. You teach the Jade Emperor to let the Heavenly Palace be with me.""","When the Great Sage heard this, he said to himself, snickering, “What a fool this Tathāgata is! A single somersault of mine can carry old Monkey one hundred and eight thousand miles, yet his palm is not even one foot across. How could I possibly not jump clear of it?” He asked quickly, “You’re certain that your decision will stand?” “Certainly it will,” said Tathāgata. He stretched out his right hand, which was about the size of a lotus leaf. Our Great Sage put away his compliant rod and, summoning his power, leaped up and stood right in the center of the Patriarch’s hand. He said simply, “I’m off!” and he was gone— all but invisible like a streak of light in the clouds. Training the eye of wisdom on him, the Buddhist Patriarch saw that the Monkey King was hurtling along relentlessly like a whirligig. As the Great Sage advanced, he suddenly saw five flesh-pink pillars supporting a mass of green air. “This must be the end of the road,” he said. “When I go back presently, Tathāgata will be my witness and I shall certainly take up residence in the Palace of Divine Mists.” But he thought to himself, “Wait a moment! I’d better leave some kind of memento if I’m going to negotiate with Tathāgata.” He plucked a hair and blew a mouthful of magic breath onto it, crying, “Change!” It changed into a writing brush with extra thick hair soaked in heavy ink. On the middle pillar he then wrote in large letters the following line: “The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, has made a tour of this place.” When he had finished writing, he retrieved his hair, and with a total lack of respect he left a bubbling pool of monkey urine at the base of the first pillar. He reversed his cloud somersault and went back to where he had started. Standing on Tathāgata’s palm, he said, “I left, and now I’m back. Tell the Jade Emperor to give me the Celestial Palace.”","The Great Sage secretly rejoiced and said to himself, “This Buddha must be a perfect fool. I can jump eighteen thousand li at once, and his palm is not more than a foot in length. How could I not jump out of it?” Then he spoke aloud, “Since you propose this, I agree to it.” Buddha said, “Agreed, agreed!” and opened his hand. His palm was only about the size of a small lotus leaf. The Great Sage took his magic steel and made a leap and rested on Buddha’s palm, and said, “Here I go!” He thought he was traveling invisibly on the clouds, and that Buddha was watching him going fast like a windmill. The Great Sage, thinking he was rushing on the clouds, suddenly saw five pillars of red flesh in front stopping him, beyond which was darkness. He then said, “This must be the end of the journey. I will go back now, and Buddha is my witness that the Lingshao Hall of the Jade Emperor is mine now!” He was about to call out to show he had stopped, when he thought he would mark where he had arrived and show it as a proof to the Buddha. He therefore plucked a hair, chewed it, blew it out and cried out, “Change!” and it was changed into a pencil covered with ink. On the middle pillar he wrote, “The Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven, has traveled thus far!” and then put back his hair in the original place. Then at the bottom of the first pillar, he urinated, after which he thought he had jumped up to the clouds and returned. He found himself still standing on the palm of the Buddha’s hand. He said, “I have been away and have come back! Now call upon the Jade Emperor to yield his throne to me.”","Monkey laughed to himself. This Buddha’s an idiot. His palm’s less than a foot wide. How could I fail? “You swear?” he asked out loud. “I swear,” confirmed the Buddha, opening his palm out like a lotus leaf. “Back in a jiffy!” Monkey shouted, leaving behind only a vapor trail. All the while, the Buddha kept his Eye of Wisdom on him, watching as Monkey whirled forward like a pinwheel until he suddenly encountered five flesh-pink pillars surrounded by green air. Looks like this is the end of the road. Hello, Hall of Divine Mists, good-bye, Jade Emperor. The Buddha promised! Then Monkey had a second thought: I should leave my mark, in case the Buddha tries to be slippery about it. Pulling out a hair, he changed it—with a breath of magic air—into a thick writing brush soaked in ink and scrawled in large letters on the middle pillar: the great sage equal to heaven was here. His inscription complete, he retrieved his hair and—I’m very sorry to say—deposited a stream of bubbling monkey pee at the base of the first pillar. With a reversal of his cloud-somersault, he was back to where he had started, standing on the Buddha’s palm. “Mission accomplished. Tell the Jade Emperor to pack up.”","When he heard this offer the Great Sage smiled to himself and thought, “This Buddha is a complete idiot. I can cover thirty-six thousand miles with a somersault, so how could I fail to jump out of the palm of his hand, which is less than a foot across?” With this in his mind he asked eagerly, “Do you guarantee that yourself?” “Yes, yes,” the Buddha replied, and he stretched out his right hand, which seemed to be about the size of a lotus leaf. Putting away his As-You-Will cudgel, the Great Sage summoned up all his divine powers, jumped into the palm of the Buddha's hand, and said, “I'm off.” Watch him as he goes like a streak of light and disappears completely. The Buddha, who was watching him with his wise eyes, saw the Monkey King whirling forward like a windmill and not stopping until he saw five flesh-pink pillars topped by dark vapours. “This is the end of the road,” he said, “so now I'll go back. The Buddha will be witness, and the Hall of Miraculous Mist will be mine.” Then he thought again, “Wait a moment. I'll leave my mark here to prove my case when I talk to the Buddha.” He pulled out a hair, breathed on it with his magic breath, and shouted “Change.” It turned into a writing brush dipped in ink, and with it he wrote THE GREAT SAGE EQUALING HEAVEN WAS HERE in big letters on the middle pillar. When that was done he put the hair back on, and, not standing on his dignity, made a pool of monkey piss at the foot of the pillar. Then he turned his somersault round and went back to where he had started from. “I went, and now I'm back. Tell the Jade Emperor to hand the Heavenly Palace over to me,” he said, standing in the Buddha's palm."
“李兄，我想那争名的，因名丧体；夺利的，为利亡身；受爵的，抱虎而眠；承恩的，袖蛇而去。算起来，还不如我们水秀山青，逍遥自在，甘淡薄，随缘而过。”李定道：“张兄说得有理。但只是你那水秀，不如我的山青。”张稍道：“你山青不如我的水秀。,"""Brother Li, I think that those who compete for fame will die because of their names; those who take profits will die for the sake of profit; those who receive titles will sleep with a tiger in their arms; those who accept favors will go away. Xiushanqing is free and easy, and it is easy to pass by."" Li Ding said: ""Brother Zhang is right. But it's just that your water is beautiful, not as good as my mountain."" Zhang Shao said: ""Your mountain is not as good as mine. .","“Brother Li,” said Zhang Shao, “in my opinion those who strive for fame will lose their lives on account of fame; those who live in quest of fortune will perish because of riches; those who have titles sleep embracing a tiger; and those who receive official favors walk with snakes in their sleeves. When you think of it, their lives cannot compare with our carefree existence, close to the blue mountains and fair waters. We cherish poverty and pass our days without having to quarrel with fate.” “Brother Zhang,” said Li Ding, “there’s a great deal of truth in what you say. But your fair waters cannot match my blue mountains.” “On the contrary,” said Zhang Shao, “your blue mountains cannot match my fair waters, in testimony of which I offer a lyric2 to the tune of ‘Butterflies Enamored of Flowers’ that says:","Return your so called wife to her father.” The demon changed back into his natural form, ran into a cave and brought out a nine-pronged spear with which to fight. Sun cried out, “Tell me what your skill is, and hand your weapons over to me, or I will kill you, false demon!”","We travel now to another riverbank, this time near Chang’an, to eavesdrop on an exchange between two friends—a local fisherman and a woodcutter who lived in the mountains nearby. Although neither had had any luck in the civil service exam, they both had more than a smattering of education, and tottering home one evening after more wine than was perhaps good for them, they began to quarrel amicably about which were more beautiful—mountains or rivers.","“Brother Li,” said Zhang Shao, “it seems to me that people who struggle for fame kill themselves for it; those who compete for profit die for it; those who accept honors sleep with a tiger in their arms; and those who receive imperial favours walk around with snakes in their sleeves. Taking all in all, we are much better off living free among our clear waters and blue hills: we delight in our poverty and follow our destinies.” “You are right, Brother Zhang,” said Li Ding, “but your clear waters have nothing on my blue hills.” “Your blue hills are not a patch on my clear waters,” retorted Zhang Shao, “and here is a lyric to the tune of The Butterfly Loves the Flowers to prove it: The skiff is tiny amid the misty expanse of waves; Calmly I lean against the single sail,"

Wukong pressed the cloud head and reached Huaguo Mountain. He was looking for a way to go, and suddenly he heard the chirping of cranes and chirps. and also! ""At the bottom of the cliff, beside the rock ridge, among the flowers and plants, among the trees, monkeys as big as small jumped out by tens of thousands, surrounded a beautiful monkey king, kowtowed and shouted, ""Your Majesty, you are so relieved! Why did you go for a long time? Flash us all here, I hope you are as hungry as you are! Recently, I was bullied here by a demon, who forcibly took over our Shuilian Cave Mansion. At these times, the fellow robbed our family of fire, captured many sons and nephews, taught us sleepless nights and nights, and guarded the family business. Fortunately, the king is here! If the king does not come again in the next year, even the cave will belong to someone else! When Wukong heard that, he was furious in his heart: ""What kind of monster, you dare to be invisible!"" Tell me in detail, until I seek his revenge. All the monkeys kowtowed: ""Speak to the king, that fellow calls himself the Demon King of Confusion, and lives in Zhibeixia."" Wukong said: ""How long is the distance from here to him?"" ""The monkeys said: ""When he comes, it is cloudy, and when he leaves, it is foggy, whether it is wind or rain, whether it is thunder or lightning, I don't know how many roads there are. ""Wukong said: ""Since that's the case, don't be afraid, and play with yourselves, wait for me to find him!"" ""","Words of farewell still echo in my ears. I ne’er hope to see so soon the eastern depths!” Wukong lowered the direction of his cloud and landed squarely on the Flower-Fruit Mountain. He was trying to find his way when he heard the call of cranes and the cry of monkeys; the call of cranes reverberated in the Heavens, and the cry of monkeys moved his spirit with sadness. “Little ones,” he called out, “I have returned!” From the crannies of the cliff, from the flowers and bushes, and from the woods and trees, monkeys great and small leaped out by the tens of thousands and surrounded the Handsome Monkey King. They all kowtowed and cried, “Great King! What laxity of mind! Why did you go away for such a long time and leave us here longing for your return like someone hungering and thirsting? Recently, we have been brutally abused by a monster, who wanted to rob us of our Water-Curtain Cave. Out of sheer desperation, we fought hard with him. And yet all this time, that fellow has plundered many of our possessions, kidnapped a number of our young ones, and given us many restless days and nights watching over our property. How fortunate that our great king has returned! If the great king had stayed away another year or so, we and the entire mountain cave would have belonged to someone else!” Hearing this, Wukong was filled with anger. “What sort of a monster is this,” he cried, “that behaves in such a lawless manner? Tell me in detail and I will find him to exact vengeance.” “Be informed, Great King,” the monkeys said, kowtowing, “that the fellow calls himself the Monstrous King of Havoc, and he lives north of here.” Wukong asked, “From here to his place, how great is the distance?” The monkeys replied, “He comes like the cloud and leaves like the mist, like the wind and the rain, like lightning and thunder. We don’t know how great the distance is.” “In that case,” said Wukong, “go and play for a while and don’t be afraid. Let me go and find him.”","Finally the Seeker of Secrets descended safely from the clouds, arrived at the Mountain Garden and there heard the monkeys crying bitterly. He said, “My children, I have returned, what is the matter?” Ten thousand monkeys, great and small, ran towards him from all the rocks and trees about, knelt before him and cried, “Why did you leave us so long here without protection? We have been longing for your return like men who are hungry and thirsty. Of late we have been troubled by the Chief Disturber of the World’s Peace, who wanted to take possession of our cave by force. We fought him at the risk of our lives and many were killed. If you, Oh King, had not returned, there would soon have been no cave left us at all.” The Seeker of Secrets became very angry and asked what evil spirit it was that had dared do that. “We will soon have our revenge on him. Where does he live and how far away?” “We do not know. He came with the wind and went away in a fog.” At this the Seeker of Secrets said, “I will find him.”","Just as he was trying to work out which path to take back to Water-Curtain Cave, he heard the cries of cranes and monkeys echoing about him. “I’m back, little ones!” he called. From out of rocky enclaves, grasses, flowers, and trees, thousands of monkeys of different sizes leaped out and surrounded their king. “Why were you gone so long? A cruel demon has attacked Water-Curtain Cave, stolen our possessions, and kidnapped our children.” “Who is this insolent fiend?” raged Monkey. “Tell me everything, and I’ll settle his hash.” “He calls himself the Monstrous King of Chaos, and he lives north of here.” “How far?” “We don’t know. He arrives like the clouds and departs like the mist, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning.” “Very well.","The parting words still echo in my ears; When will I see The Eastern Ocean again?” Sun Wukong put away his cloud and headed straight to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. As he followed the path there he heard the call of the cranes and the cries of the apes. The crane calls echoed beyond the Milky Way, and the ape cries were pathetically sad. Sun Wukong shouted, “Children, I'm back.” Big monkeys and little monkeys came bounding in their thousands and tens of thousands from caves in the cliffs, from the grass and flowers, and down from the trees. They all crowded round the Handsome Monkey King, kowtowed and said, “Your Majesty, you're a cool one. How could you stay away for so long, abandoning us all here? We've been desperate for you to come back. A demon has been mistreating us terribly. He's occupied our Water Curtain Cave, and we've been fighting for our lives with him. Recently he's been stealing our things and carrying off many of our youngsters. We've had to stay awake all night to guard our families. Thank goodness you've come back! Another year without you, Your Majesty, and every one of us would be under his control, cave and all.” Sun Wukong was furious, “Who is this demon? What an outrage! Tell me everything about him, and then I'll go and give him what's coming to him.” The monkey host kowtowed again and said, “Your Majesty, the wretch calls himself the Demon King of Confusion. He lives North of here.” “How far away is his lair?” Sun Wukong asked. “He comes and goes in cloud and mist with wind and rain, or thunder and lightning, so we don't know how far it is.” “If that's how it is,” Sun Wukong replied, “then don't worry. Just keep yourselves amused while I go and find him.”"
猴王道：“据你说起来，乃是一个行孝的君子，向后必有好处。但望你指与我那神仙住处，却好拜访去也。”樵夫道：“不远，不远。此山叫做灵台方寸山。山中有座斜月三星洞。那洞中有一个神仙，称名须菩提祖师。那祖师出去的徒弟，也不计其数，见今还有三四十人从他修行。你顺那条小路儿，向南行七八里远近，即是他家了。”猴王用手扯住樵夫道：“老兄，你便同我去去。若还得了好处，决不忘你指引之恩。”樵夫道：“你这汉子，甚不通变。我方才这般与你说了，你还不省？假若我与你去了，却不误了我的生意？老母何人奉养？我要斫柴，你自去，自去。”,"The Monkey King said: ""According to you, he is a gentleman who practices filial piety, and it will be good for him to go backwards. But I hope you point to my immortal residence, but it is easy to visit."" The woodcutter said: ""Not far, not far. This mountain is called Lingtai Fangcun Mountain. There is a three-star cave with a slanting moon in the mountain. There is a god in the cave, called the Patriarch Subhuti. There are countless apprentices that the Patriarch has gone out, and there are still 30 to 40 people who practice with him today. You follow that path and go south for seven or eight miles, and that's his home."" The Monkey King grabbed the woodcutter and said, ""Brother, you can go with me. If you get something good, don't forget it. The kindness of your guidance."" The woodcutter said: ""You man, you are very inflexible. I told you just now, but you still don't realize it? If I go with you, I will not miss my business? Who is the mother? Support? I want to chop firewood, you go, go by yourself.""","The Monkey King said, “According to what you have said, you are indeed a gentleman of filial piety, and you will certainly be rewarded in the future. I hope, however, that you will show me the way to the immortal’s abode, so that I may reverently call upon him.” “It’s not far,” the woodcutter said. “This mountain is called the Mountain of Mind and Heart, and in it is the Cave of Slanting Moon and Three Stars. Inside the cave is an immortal by the name of the Patriarch Subodhi, who has already sent out innumerable disciples. Even now there are thirty or forty persons who are practicing austerities with him. Follow this narrow path and travel south for about seven or eight miles, and you will come to his home.” Grabbing the woodcutter, the Monkey King said, “Honored brother, go with me. If I receive any benefit, I will not forget the favor of your guidance.” “What a boneheaded fellow you are!” the woodcutter said. “I have just finished telling you these things, and you still don’t understand. If I go with you, won’t I be neglecting my livelihood? And who will take care of my mother? I must chop my firewood. You go on by yourself!”","The Monkey King said, “From what you say you are one of the superior men, full of filial piety, and surely you shall have a share of immortality. Please show me where the Immortal lives, so that I may pay my respects to him and learn from him.” “It is near, quite near. This place is called the Heart of the Living Mountain. In the mountain there is the Slanting Moon and Three Star Cave. In that cave there is an Immortal called the Fountain of Wisdom, and innumerable disciples taught by him have gone forth. He has some thirty or forty students now. You follow that small path and go southward for seven or eight li, and there is the place.” The Monkey King laid hold of the woodman and said, “Venerable Brother, you come with me. I shall not forget your kindness.” The woodman said, “What a stupid man you are! I have already told you where to find him. I must cut wood and look after my mother. If I go with you I shall be neglecting my business, and who will look after my mother? You go by yourself!”","“Well, I’m sure you will be rewarded in later life for your filial devotion. In the meantime, though, could you point the way to the immortal’s house, so that I can pay him a visit?” “It’s not far. This is Heart and Soul Mountain. About seven or eight miles to the south, you’ll come to the Cave of the Tilted Moon and Three Stars, the home of an immortal called Subodhi, who has trained many disciples, and currently has thirty or forty studying under him.” Monkey tugged at the woodcutter. “Come with me! You won’t regret it.” “Did you not listen to anything I said just now?” he answered, exasperated. “I’ve wood to chop.","“From what you say,” the Monkey King replied, “you're a filial son and a gentleman— you're bound to be rewarded for it one day. But I'd be grateful if you could show me where that Immortal lives, so that I can go and pay him my respects.” The woodcutter said, “It's not far from here. This mountain is the Spirit Tower Heart Mountain, and in it there is the Cave of the Setting Moon and the Three Stars. In that cave lives an Immortal called the Patriarch Subhuti. I don't know how many disciples he has trained—there are thirty or forty of them cultivating their conduct with him at the moment. If you take that path South for two or three miles you'll reach his home.” The Monkey King tugged at the woodcutter and said, “Take me there, Elder Brother. If I get anything out of this, I won't forget your kindness.” “You idiot,” the woodcutter replied, “didn't you understand what I told you just now? If I went with you I wouldn't be able to earn my living, and who would look after my poor old mother then? I've got to get on with my woodcutting. Go by yourself.”"

If there’s no great inconvenience, we’ll take you.” “No need for further discussion,” said Eight Rules, “for he’s no genuine parent of mine. Whether I want to do this or not is for me to decide.” “All right, all right,” said the woman. “Let me talk to my girls first.” She slipped back inside immediately and slammed the rear door shut. Eight Rules did not graze the horse there either, but led it back to the front. Little did he realize, however, that Great Sage Sun had heard everything. With wings outstretched, the Great Sage flew back to see the Tang Monk, changing back into his original form. “Master,” he said, “Wuneng is leading the horse back here.” “Of course he’s leading the horse,” said the Tang Monk, “for if he doesn’t, it may run away in a fit of mischief.” Pilgrim started to laugh and gave a thorough account of what the woman and Eight Rules had said, but Tripitaka did not know whether to believe him or not.",,"Be a compassionate bull demon and come with me now to Jade-Cloud Mountain, would you, and persuade her to lend us the fan?

This time you’ve gone too far, Monkey. Have a taste of my cudgel!” “I really do need that fan,” Monkey persevered. “If you can hold your own against me,” growled Bull Demon, “I’ll tell my wife to lend it to you. If not, I’ll kill you, just to cheer myself up.” “Good plan, brother. It’s been centuries since we tested ourselves against each other —I’ve really missed our mortal combat.” When they were about a hundred clashes in—each fighting on their respective auspicious clouds—a voice called out from the summit of Thunder-Hoard Mountain: “Lord Bull Demon! My sovereign begs the pleasure of your company for dinner.” Bull Demon blocked and held Monkey’s staff. “Hold on. Back after a banquet.” Dropping down from the clouds, Bull Demon went back inside the cave.","If the ditches are blocked, I'll make them run. I can do all sorts of household jobs.

If there are no problems, then you can marry one of the girls.” “There's no need to talk it over with him,” Pig said. “He's not my father or mother, and it's entirely up to me whether I do it or not.” “Very well then,” she said, “Wait while I tell the girls.” With that she went in and shut the door behind her. Pig still did not let the horse graze but dragged it round towards the front of the house. Unbeknown to him, Monkey, who knew all about what had happened, flew back, changed back into his own form, and said to the Tang Priest, “ Master, Pig is leading the horse back.” “If he hadn't led it, it might have got excited and run away,” Sanzang said, at which Monkey burst out laughing and told him all about what had taken place between Pig and the woman. Sanzang did not know whether to believe him or not."
菩萨即唤惠岸，袖中取出一个红葫芦儿，吩咐道：“你可将此葫芦，同孙悟空到流沙河水面上，只叫悟净，他就出来了。先要引他归依了唐僧，然后把他那九个骷髅穿在一处，按九宫布列，却把这葫芦安在当中，就是法船一只，能渡唐僧过流沙河界。”惠岸闻言，谨遵师命，当时与大圣捧葫芦出了潮音洞，奉法旨辞了紫竹林。有诗为证，诗曰：五行匹配合天真，认得从前旧主人。炼已立基为妙用，辨明邪正见原因。金来归性还同类，木去求情共复沦。二土全功成寂寞，调和水火没纤尘。,"The Bodhisattva called Hui'an, took out a red gourd from his sleeve, and instructed: ""You can bring this gourd with Sun Wukong to the surface of the Liusha River, just call Wujing, and he will come out. First, you must lead him to take refuge with the Tang monk, Then put his nine skeletons in one place and arrange them according to the nine palaces, but put this gourd in the middle, which is a Dharma boat that can cross the Tang Dynasty monk and cross the Liusha River."" Hui'an heard the words and obeyed the teacher's order. At that time, he walked out of Chaoyin Cave with the Great Sage holding a gourd, and left the Zizhu Forest in accordance with the decree of the law. There is a poem as proof, the poem says: The five elements match the innocence, recognize the former master. Refinement has established a foundation as a wonderful use, discerning the cause of evil and right view. Jin Lai's nature is still the same, and Mu Qu's intercession will be reincarnated. The two soils have all succeeded in loneliness, reconciling water and fire without fine dust.","The Bodhisattva immediately called for Hui’an. Taking a little red gourd from her sleeves, she handed it over to him, saying, “Take this gourd and go with Sun Wukong to the Flowing-Sand River. Call ‘Wujing,’ and he’ll come out at once. You must first take him to submit to the Tang Monk. Next, string together those nine skulls of his and arrange them according to the position of the Nine Palaces. Put this gourd in the center, and you will have a dharma vessel ready to ferry the Tang Monk across the boundary formed by the Flowing-Sand River.” Obeying the instructions of his master, Hui’an left the Tidal-Sound Cave with the Great Sage carrying the gourd. As they departed the purple bamboo grove in compliance with the holy command, we have a testimonial poem: The Five Phases well matched as Heaven’s truth, His former master he can recognize. Refine the self as base for wondrous use; Good and bad discerned will reveal the cause. Metal returns to nature—the same kind are both. Wood begs for favor: they’ll all be redeemed. Two-Earths9 completes merit to reach the void: Water and fire blended, dustless and clean.",,"“If it’s so hot,” wondered Monkey, “how did you grow rice for this pudding?” “With the help of Princess Iron-Fan.” “Who?” Monkey asked. “She’s an immortal with a magic palm-leaf fan. One wave of it puts the fire out, a second brings a breeze, a third rain. That brief respite allows us to grow crops. Otherwise, nothing would grow around here—not even a blade of grass.”","The Bodhisattva sent for her disciple Huian and produced a red bottle-gourd from her sleeve. “Take this gourd,” she said, “and go with Sun Wukong to the Flowing Sands River. Shout 'Wujing'—'Awakened to Purity'—and he'll come out. First take him to submit to the Tang Priest, and then make him thread his nine skulls on a string like the Sacred Palaces. If he puts this gourd in the middle of them, it will make a dharma boat to ferry the Tang Priest across the river.” In obedience to the Bodhisattva's command, Huian and the Great Sage took the gourd with them from the Tide Cave and the Purple Bamboo Grove. There are some lines to describe it: The Five Elements were combined with the heavenly Immortal, Recognizing their master of the old days. They have been sufficiently refined to achieve great things; When true and false are distinguished, origins are seen. When Metal joins Nature, like joins like; When Wood seeks the Passions, both are lost. When the two Earths achieve nirvana, Fire and Water will combine, and worldly dust be no more."

太宗道：“求证善事，有劳法师，无物酬谢。早间萧瑀迎着二僧，愿送锦襕异宝袈裟一件，九环锡杖一条。今特召法师领去受用。”玄奘叩头谢恩。太宗道：“法师如不弃，可穿上与朕看看。”,"Taizong said: ""For the proof of good deeds, there is a teacher who has worked hard, but there is no reward. Xiao Yu greeted the two monks in the morning, and would like to send a golden cassock and a nine-ring tin stick. Today, a special teacher is called to take it and use it."" Xuanzang kowtowed and thanked him. . Taizong said: ""If the Master does not abandon it, you can wear it and see it with me.""","“We have greatly troubled our Master,” said Taizong, “to render exemplary good works, for which we have hardly anything to offer you in thanks.

We therefore call specially for you so that you may receive them for your enjoyment and use.” Xuanzang kowtowed to express his thanks. “If our Master of the Law is willing,” said Taizong, “please put the garment on for us to have a look.”","When Sun once more attacked him, the arhats threw diamond dust into the air, which blinded and half buried the demon. But, throwing his magic coil, he was able to gather up all the diamond dust and carry it back to his cave. The arhats then advised Sun to see the Ancient of Days, who knew more about this particular demon than any one else. So Sun went to the Palace of the Ancient of Days, where he found that the Demon of the House was none other than one of the deity’s ox angels who had stolen the magic coil from the Palace and had gone down to earth as ox demons It was the same coil with which Sun himself had been subdued, when he had rebelled against Heaven.","“Could our visitor recite some scriptures for the occasion?” A filial son, Boqin immediately set to preparing incense and paper money for an ancestral ceremony.

The prince Nezha flashed next to him, and he said, ""Father, please calm down and forgive the sins of the giants. When the child leaves the school, you will know the depth.""

Your unworthy warrior cannot prevail against him. Defeated, I have come to beg your pardon.” “This fellow has blunted our will to fight,” said Devarāja Li angrily. “Take him out and have him executed!” From the side came Prince Naṭa, who said, bowing deeply, “Let your anger subside, Father King, and pardon for the moment the guilt of Mighty-Spirit. Permit your child to go into battle once, and we shall know the long and short of the matter.” The Devarāja heeded the admonition and ordered Mighty-Spirit to go back to his camp and await trial.","The Great Victorious Spirit returned to the camp, went to see Guardian King Li, knelt before him, and said, “The Horse Master certainly has immense magic power.

""Fu Yi and Xiao Yu argued, saying that the etiquette is based on serving the family and the emperor, while the Buddha turned his back on his family, resisted the Son of Heaven with his husband, and rebelled against his relatives with his body. Xiao Yu was not born in Kongsang, but followed the teaching of no father. As the saying goes, those who are not filial have no relatives. Xiao Yu put his palms together and said, ""The hell is set up for this person. Taizong summoned his servants, Zhang Daoyuan, and Zhongshu's commander, Zhang Shiheng, and asked the Buddha how to do camping blessings. Emperor Wu of Zhou divided it into three teachings: Zen master Dahui praised you far and wide, and all the offerings were made without fail; Since ancient times, it has been said that the three religions are supreme and cannot be destroyed or destroyed. His Majesty Fu Qi, the Holy Sword, made a clear judgment. Taizong was very happy and said: ""Your words are reasonable. Anyone who makes a statement is guilty. ""Then Wei Zheng, Xiao Yu and Zhang Daoyuan invited all the Buddhas, and elected a person with great virtue to be the altar master and built the dojo. All of them bowed their heads and thanked them and left. Since then, the law has been issued: but there are those who slander the monks and slander the Buddha. , cut off its arm.","I urge that the dissenter be severely punished.” Taking up the debate with Xiao Yu, Fu Yi contended that propriety had its foundation in service to one’s parents and ruler. Yet Buddha forsook his parents and left his family; indeed, he defied the Son of Heaven all by himself, just as he used an inherited body to rebel against his parents. Xiao Yu, Fu Yi went on to say, was not born in the wilds, but by his adherence to this doctrine of parental denial, he confirmed the saying that an unfilial son had in fact no parents. Xiao Yu, however, folded his hands in front of him and declared, “Hell was established precisely for people of this kind.” Taizong thereupon called on the Lord High Chamberlain, Zhang Daoyuan, and the President of the Grand Secretariat, Zhang Shiheng, and asked how efficacious the Buddhist exercises were in the procurement of blessings. The two officials replied, “The emphasis of Buddha is on purity, benevolence, compassion, the proper fruits, and the unreality of things. It was Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou dynasty who set the Three Religions in order.6 The Chan Master, Da Hui, also had extolled those concepts of the dark and the distant. Generations of people revered such saints as the Fifth Patriarch, who became man,7 or the Bodhidharma, who appeared in his sacred form; none of them proved to be inconspicuous in grace and power. Moreover, it has been held since antiquity that the Three Religions are most honorable, not to be destroyed or abolished. We beseech, therefore, Your Majesty to exercise your clear and sagacious judgment.” Highly pleased, Taizong said, “The words of our worthy subjects are not unreasonable. Anyone who disputes them further will be punished.” He thereupon ordered Wei Zheng, Xiao Yu, and Zhang Daoyuan to invite the various Buddhist priests to prepare the site for the Grand Mass and to select from among them someone of great merit and virtue to serve as the altar master. All the officials then bowed their heads to the ground to thank the emperor before withdrawing. From that time also came the law that any person who denounces a monk or Buddhism will have his arms broken.","Hearing this, Sun was both angry and glad, and could not help saying, “Friends, it is true you know that I am not Sun himself. I am only his disciple come here to learn how to manage things. But is that not Sun Wukong himself coming?” He pointed with his hand. At this all looked in the direction in which he pointed. During this interval, he changed from a Taoist and appeared in his true form. At this they all fell down and kowtowed, begging his pardon that their mortal eyes could not recognize him. “We implore you to enter the city, and compel the demons there to repent, and follow righteousness.” Sun cried out, “Follow me,” and they did, first to the sand, where they emptied two carts and smashed them into splinters, and then took the bricks and tiles and timber and threw them all into a heap calling upon all the monks to disperse. “Tomorrow,” said Sun, “I am going to see the king and I will destroy these Taoists!","This robe would be perfect for the officiating priest, Xuanzang.” Xiao Yu led her in to see the emperor. “What is special about this robe?” Taizong asked her. “Made from ice-white silkworms and by immortal weavers, it protects the wearer from calamity. It glows with a magic aura bright enough to illuminate your mortal world.” “That does sound good,” admitted the emperor.","Those who deny sages are lawless. I request that he be severely punished.” Fu Yi argued with Xiao Yu, pointing out that correct behavior was derived from serving one's parents and one's sovereign, whereas the Buddha turned his back on his parents, resisting the Son of Heaven although he was but a commoner, and rebelling against his mother and father with the body that they gave him. Xiao Yu had not been born in an empty mulberry tree, but he honoured a religion that denied fathers; this indeed proved that he who had no sense of filial piety denied his father. All Xiao Yu did was to put his hands together and say, “Hell must have been made for men such as him.” Taizong sent for the High Chamberlain Zhang Daoyuan and the Head of the Secretariat Zhang Shiheng to ask them how effectively Buddhist ritual obtained blessings. “The Buddha dwells in purity, benevolence and mercy,” the two officers replied, “and the True Result is Buddha-emptiness. Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty placed the Three Teachings in an order. The Chan Master Dahui wrote a poem in praise of the distant and mysterious. If the masses support monks, anything can happen. The Five Patriarchs came down to their mothers' wombs, and Bodhidharma appeared. From remotest antiquity everyone has said that the Three Teachings are highly venerable and cannot be destroyed or abolished. We humbly beg Your Majesty to give us his perceptive ruling.” “Your submission makes sense,” said the delighted Taizong. “If anyone else makes further comments, he will be punished.” He then ordered Wei Zheng, Xiao Yu and Zhang Daoyuan to invite all the monks and select one of great virtue to be Master of Ceremonies. They all bowed to thank him and withdrew. From then on there was a new law: anyone who injured a monk or slandered the Buddha would lose his arm."

Let old Monkey go find that cursed dragon in the stream and ask him for our horse.” The various deities obeyed. Only then did Tripitaka feel somewhat relieved as he sat on the cliff and told Pilgrim to be careful. “Just don’t worry,” said Pilgrim. Dear Monkey King! He tightened the belt around his silk shirt, hitched up his tiger-skin kilt, and went straight toward the gorge of the stream holding the golden-hooped iron rod. Standing halfway between cloud and fog, he cried loudly on top of the water, “Lawless lizard! Return my horse!

The emperor bathed in piety and respected the Buddha, took refuge in the fruit of good deeds, and rejoiced in incense. The king of Tang drove a large car, arrived in front of the temple early, ordered the music horn to stop, got off the chariot, and led many officials. Worship Buddha and incense. The three rounds have been completed, look up and see, there is indeed a good dojo, but you can see: banners are fluttering, and the treasure cover is shining. Flags fluttered and danced, condensed the sky and swayed colorful clouds; Baogai was flying, and the sun was shining and red and electric. The World-Honored Golden Elephant has a splendid appearance, and the Arhat jade is majestic. Vase with immortal flowers, burning sandalwood in the furnace. Immortal flowers are placed in the vase, and the brocade tree is shining brightly in the treasure temple; When the new fruit is built, the red plate is built, and the odd-shaped candy cake is piled up in a colorful case. The eminent monks listed and recited the scriptures, wishing to pull the lonely soul away from suffering. Taizong, both civil and military, took incense, worshipped the Buddha's golden body, and participated in the Arhats. See also the great Chandu Gang, Master Chen Xuanzang, who led the monks to worship the Tang king. After the ceremony, they were divided into classes and settled in their meditation positions. The Master presented Jigu Bangwen and Taizong to read. It is very good. Looking at his lonely soul, it is deeply appropriate to mourn. This is in accordance with Taizong's holy order: to select monks, participate in Zen teaching, and open the door for convenience, transport the boat of compassion, and help people in the sea of suffering. , play Hongmeng in general; move and stop doing nothing, mix it into pure vegetarian. With this good reason, I invite you to reward the Qing capital Jiangque; take advantage of my victory to get out of the cage of hell. Get to the bliss as soon as possible, and travel to and from the West at will. The poem says: 1 Longevity incense in the furnace, several rolls of super-birth urns. Boundless wonderful teachings are proclaimed, and boundless heaven is blessed. All injustices have been eliminated, and all lonely souls have been released from prison. I wish to protect our family and keep the peace and prosperity forever."" Taizong was full of joy and said to the monks : ""You stand firm, and don't neglect the Buddha's affairs. When your success is complete, and everyone has their own blessings, I will reward them, and I will never work in vain.""","A thousand lords with girdle-jade walk in front and rear. The many flags of guardsmen stand both left and right. Those holding gilt bludgeons, And halberds and axes, March in pairs and pairs; The red silk lanterns, The royal incense urn, Move in solemnity. The dragons fly and the phoenixes dance; The falcons soar and the eagles take wing. This Son of Heaven’s an upright sage; The righteous ministers are good. They increase our bliss by a thousand years, surpassing Yu and Shun; They secure peace of ten thousand ages, rivaling Yao and Tang. We also see the curve-handled umbrella, And robes with rolling dragons— Their glare lighting up each other; The jade joined-rings, The phoenix fans, Waving through holy mist. Those caps of pearls and belts of jade; The purple sashes and medals of gold. A thousand rows of soldiers protect the Throne; Two lines of marshals uphold the carriage. This emperor, cleansed and sincere, bows to the Buddha, Glad to raise incense and seek virtue’s fruit. The grand cortege of the Tang emperor soon arrived in front of the temple. The emperor ordered a halt to the music, left the carriages, and led many officials in the worship of Buddha by taking up burning incense sticks in their hands. After bowing three times holding the incense, they raised their heads and looked around them. This was indeed a splendid religious hall. You see Dancing flags and banners; Bright, gleaming sunshades. Dancing flags and banners Fill the air with strands of flashing colored mists. Bright, gleaming sunshades Glow in the sun as fiery bolts. Imposing, the gold image of Lokājyeṣṭha;14 Most awesome, the jade features of the arhats. Divine flowers fill the vases. Sandalwood incense burn in the urns. The divine flowers filling the vases Adorn the temple with a brilliant forest of brocade. The sandalwood incense burning in the urns Covers the clear sky with waves of fragrant clouds. Piled high on red trays are fruits in season. On colored counters, mounds of cakes and sweets rest. Rows of noble priests chant the holy sūtras To save from their travails those orphaned souls. Taizong and his officials each lifted the incense; they also worshipped the golden body of the Buddha and paid homage to the arhats. Thereafter, the Master of the Law, Chen Xuanzang, the Grand Expositor of the Faith, led the various monks to greet the Tang emperor. After the ceremony, they went back to their seats according to their rank and station. The priest then presented Taizong with the proclamation for the deliverance of the orphaned souls. It read: The supreme virtue is vast and endless, for Buddhism is founded upon Nirvāṇa. The spirit of the pure and the clean circulates freely and flows everywhere in the Three Regions. There are a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, all regulated by the forces of yin and yang. Boundless and vast indeed are the substance, the function, the true nature, and the permanence of such phenomena. But look at those orphaned souls, how worthy they are of our pity and commiseration! Now by the holy command of Taizong, we have selected and assembled various priests, who will engage in meditation and in the proclamation of the Law. Flinging wide the gates of salvation and setting in motion many vessels of mercy, we would deliver you, the multitudes, from the Sea of Woe and save you from perdition and from the Sixfold Path. You will be led to return to the way of truth and to enjoy the bliss of Heaven. Whether it be by motion, rest, or nonactivity, you will be united with, and become, pure essences. Therefore make use of this noble occasion, for you are invited to the pleasures of the celestial city. Take advantage of our Grand Mass so that you may find release from Hell’s confinement, ascend quickly and freely to ultimate bliss, and travel without restraint in the Region of the West.15 The poem says: An urn of immortal incense. Some scrolls of salvific power. As we proclaim this boundless Law, Receive now Heaven’s endless grace. All your guilt and crime abolished, You lost souls may leave your prison. May our nation be firmly blessed With peace long and all-embracing. Highly pleased by what he read, Taizong said to the monks, “Be firm, all of you, in your devotion, and do not slack in your service to Buddha. After the achievement of merit and after each has received his blessing, we shall reward you handsomely. Be assured that you will not have labored in vain.”","There was no thunder and no lightning after this. This made the Wizard still more anxious, and he burnt more incense and charms and recited more incantations and struck the table as his fourth signal. Instantly the dragons from the four oceans appeared. Sun cried out above their heads, “Aoguang, where do you think you are going?” Aoguang and his companions came forward and bowed. Then Sun told them what he had told the other helpers before, and added, “You helped me before though not successfully. Today I hope you will help me with success.” The Dragon King replied, “I gladly obey your orders.” Sun said, “I beg of you to give me a helping hand. The Wizard’s signal of the fourth performance is now finished. It is now my turn, and I expect you all to help me. I burn no incense and have no signal but my club. When I lift up my spear the first time, I want the wind to blow.” The Mistress of the Wind said, “The wind shall blow.” “When I lift up my spear the second time, I want the clouds to gather.” The Master of the Clouds said, “The clouds shall gather.” “When I lift up my spear the third time, I want thunder and lightning.” The Master of Thunder and Mistress of Lightning said, “You shall have them in abundance.” “When I lift up my spear the fourth time, I want rain.” The Dragon replied, “Your orders shall be obeyed.” “When I lift up my spear the fifth time, I want a clear sky without fail.” Having arranged this, he restored the false Sun and took his place. He shouted out, “Master Wizard, your fourth signal for performance is now over and there has been neither wind, clouds, thunder, lightning, nor rain. Now it is my time to try.” The Wizard came down from his platform altar and went to the gallery by the king, and the Monkey followed him. The king asked the wizard how it was that none of his four attempts were successful. The wizard replied, “The rain king was not at home today.” The Monkey angrily replied, “The dragon gods were all at home, but your Royal Wizard is not sufficiently skilful.” The king then ordered the Buddhist monks to mount the platform. Sun invited the Master to go, but he said he could not command rain.","“How wonderful!” gasped all present—including the emperor—kneeling, bowing, and burning incense. Taizong called quickly for a skilled painter to sketch a true likeness of the Bodhisattva, but as soon as the artist lifted his brush, the vision vaporized, leaving only a slip of paper drifting down on the breeze. On it was written the following message: Greetings, Emperor of the Tang! 108,000 miles west of here, wonderful texts speak of the Mahayana. Once distributed throughout your empire, these sutras will deliver the ghosts of the damned from Hell. He who is willing to seek them will become a golden Buddha. “Let’s pause the mass and our pursuit of virtue until someone has brought back these miraculous scriptures,” decided the emperor. “But who will go?” asked his officials. “Though entirely useless,” Xuanzang instantly spoke up, “I volunteer to fetch these treasures that will secure the empire in perpetuity.” The emperor immediately raised Xuanzang to his feet and bowed four times to him. “For such sacrifice and service, we will become brothers.” “I swear on my life to reach the Western Heaven,” Xuanzang responded, overwhelmed. “If not, I will never return home and instead pass straight to Hell.” The beaming emperor now returned to the palace, to prepare Xuanzang’s travel documents and await an auspicious day for his departure. Xuanzang, meanwhile, went back to his own temple, which was buzzing with the news of his pledge. “Did you really volunteer to go to the Western Heaven?” one of his disciples asked him. “The way is full of tigers, leopards, demons, and monsters, wide rivers and high mountains. Will we ever see you again?” “I have made a solemn oath,” said Xuanzang. “I must repay the emperor’s generosity by serving the country. If I fail, I will be damned to eternal perdition. Remember: The active mind conjures up demons; the stilled mind extinguishes them. I may be gone for two, three, seven years, or forever. But if the pine tree inside our gate points eastward, you’ll know that I’ll be back soon.” The next morning at court, Taizong wrote out a document describing the mission and stamped it with an imperial seal granting free passage to its bearer. “The stars are auspiciously aligned today for the start of a long journey,” the Department of Astronomy reported.","A thousand officials with jade at their belts walked in due order. The banners of the five guards are drawn up on either side. Holding golden gourds, Wielding battle-axes, They stand in pairs; Lamps of purple gauze, Imperial censers, Make majestic clouds. Dragons fly and phoenixes dance, Ospreys and eagles soar. True is the enlightened Son of Heaven, Good are his just and loyal ministers. This age of prosperity surpasses the time of Shun and Yu; The eternal peace he has given outdoes that of Yao and Tang. Under a parasol with curved handle The dragon robe sweeps in, Dazzling bright. Interlocking jade rings, Coloured phoenix fans, Shimmer with a magic glow. Pearl crowns and belts of jade, Gold seals on purple cords. A thousand regiments of soldiers protect the imperial chariot, Two lines of generals carry the royal chair. Bathed and reverent, the Emperor comes to worship the Buddha, Submitting to the True Achievement as he joyfully burns incense. When the carriage of the Tang Emperor reached the temple, orders were given to stop the music as he descended from the vehicle and went at the head of his officials to bow to the Buddha and burn incense. When he had done this three times he looked up and saw what a magnificent assembly it was: Dancing banners, Flying canopies. When the banners danced The sky shook with the clouds of silk; When the canopies flew The sun gleamed as the red lightning flashed. Perfect the image of the statue of the Honoured One, Mighty the grandeur of the Arhats' countenances. Magic flowers in a vase, Censers burning sandalwood and laka. As the fairy flowers stand in vases Trees like brocade fill the temple with their brightness. As the censers burn sandalwood and laka Clouds of incense rise to the azure heaven. Fresh fruit of the season is piled in vermilion dishes, Exotic sweets are heaped on the silk-covered tables. Serried ranks of holy monks intone the surras To save abandoned souls from suffering. Taizong and his civil and military officials all burned incense, bowed to the golden body of the Lord Buddha, and paid their respects to the Arhats. The Hierarch Chen Xuanzang then led all the monks to bow to the Emperor, and when this was over they divided into their groups and went to their meditation places while the Hierarch showed the Emperor the notice about the delivery of the lonely ghosts. It read: “Mysterious is the ultimate virtue, and the Sect of Meditation leads to Nirvana. The purity of the truth is all-knowing; it pervades the Three Regions of the universe. Through its countless changes it controls the Negative and Positive; unbounded are the embodiments of the eternal reality. In considering those forlorn ghosts one should be deeply distressed. At the sacred command of Taizong we have assembled some chosen monks for meditation and preaching. He has opened wide the gates of enlightenment and rowed far the boat of mercy, saving all the beings in the sea of suffering, and delivering those who had long been afflicted by the six ways of existence. They will be led back to the right road and revel in the great chaos; in action and in passivity they will be at one with primal simplicity. For this wonderful cause they are invited to see the purple gates of the pure capital, and through our assembly they will escape from the confines of Hell to climb to the World of Bliss and be free, wandering as they please in the Paradise of the West. As the poem goes: A burner of incense of longevity, A few spells to achieve rebirth. The infinite Law is proclaimed, The boundless mercy of Heaven is shown. When sins are all washed away, The neglected souls leave Hell. We pray to protect our country; May it stay at peace and be blessed.” When he had read this the Tang Emperor's heart was filled with happiness and he said to the monks, “Hold firm to your sincerity and never allow yourselves a moment's slackness in the service of the Buddha. Later on, when the Assembly is over, you will be blessed and we shall richly reward you. You shall certainly not have labored in vain.” The twelve hundred monks all kowtowed to thank him."
第十七回,seventeenth time,SEVENTEEN,,“Ha!”,Chapter 17
光阴迅速。一日，刘洪公事远出，小姐在衙思念婆婆、丈夫，在花亭上感叹，忽然身体困倦，腹内疼痛，晕闷在地，不觉生下一子。耳边有人嘱曰：“满堂娇，听吾叮嘱。吾乃南极星君，奉观音菩萨法旨，特送此子与你，异日声名远大，非比等闲。刘贼若回，必害此子，汝可用心保护。汝夫已得龙王相救，日后夫妻相会，子母团圆，雪冤报仇有日也。谨记吾言，快醒快醒！”言讫而去。小姐醒来，句句记得，将子抱定，无计可施。忽然刘洪回来，一见此子，便要淹杀，小姐道：“今日天色已晚，容待明日抛去江中。”幸喜次早刘洪忽有紧急公事远出，小姐暗思：“此子若待贼人回来，性命休矣！不如及早抛弃江中，听其生死。倘或皇天见怜，有人救得，收养此子，他日还得相逢。”但恐难以识认，即咬破手指，写下血书一纸，将父母姓名、跟脚原由，备细开载；又将此子左脚上一个小指，用口咬下，以为记验。取贴身汗衫一件，包裹此子，乘空抱出衙门。幸喜官衙离江不远，小姐到了江边，大哭一场。正欲抛弃，忽见江岸岸侧飘起一片木板，小姐即朝天拜祷，将此子安在板上，用带缚住，血书系在胸前，推放江中，听其所之。小姐含泪回衙不题。,"Time passes quickly. One day, when Liu Hong was away from official business, the young lady missed her mother-in-law and husband in the ya, and sighed in the flower pavilion. She suddenly felt sleepy, had pain in her abdomen, and was dizzy on the ground. Unconsciously, she gave birth to a son. Someone in my ear said: ""The house is full of sweethearts, listen to my advice. I am the star of the South Pole, and I have sent this son to you in accordance with the decree of Guanyin Bodhisattva. In the future, the reputation will be great and it will be no easy task. If Liu thief returns, he will certainly harm this son. , you can protect your heart. Your husband has been rescued by the Dragon King. In the future, the husband and wife will meet, the mother and son will be reunited, and there will be a day to take revenge for the injustice. Remember my words, wake up, wake up!"" The words ended. The young lady woke up, remembered every sentence, held her son in her arms, and had nothing to do. Suddenly Liu Hong came back, and as soon as he saw this son, he was about to drown and kill him. The young lady said, ""It's getting late today, so let's wait until tomorrow to throw it in the river."" Fortunately, Liu Hong had an urgent business trip the next morning, and the young lady thought to herself: "" If this son waits for the thief to return, his life will be over! It is better to abandon Jiangzhong as soon as possible and let him live and die. If the emperor sees mercy and someone saves him and adopts this son, he will meet again in the future."" With his finger, he wrote down a piece of paper in blood, and recorded the names of his parents and the reason for his foot. Take a single-piece, wrap the child, and take it out of the yamen in the air. Fortunately, the government office was not far from the river, and the young lady came to the riverside and cried a lot. Just as she was about to abandon it, she suddenly saw a piece of wood floating on the bank of the river. The young lady prayed to the sky, placed the child on the board, tied it with a belt, tied the blood letter to her chest, pushed it into the river, and listened to it. The lady returned to the office with tears in her eyes.","Time passed by swiftly. One day, Liu Hong went far away on official business, while Lady Yin at the mansion was thinking of her mother-in-law and her husband and sighing in the garden pavilion. Suddenly she was seized by tremendous fatigue and sharp pains in her belly. Falling unconscious to the ground, she gave birth to a son. Presently she heard someone whispering in her ear: “Mantangjiao, listen carefully to what I have to say. I am the Star Spirit of South Pole, who sends you this son by the express command of the Bodhisattva Guanyin. One day his name will be known far and wide, for he is not to be compared with an ordinary mortal. But when the bandit Liu returns, he will surely try to harm the child, and you must take care to protect him. Your husband has been rescued by the Dragon King; in the future both of you will meet again even as son and mother will be reunited. A day will come when wrongs will be redressed and crimes punished. Remember my words! Wake up! Wake up!” The voice ceased and departed. The lady woke up and remembered every word; she clasped her son tightly to her but could devise no plan to protect him. Liu Hong then returned and wanted to have the child killed by drowning the moment he saw him. The lady said, “Today it’s late already. Allow him to live till tomorrow and then have him thrown into the river.” It was fortunate that Liu Hong was called away by urgent business the next morning. The lady thought to herself: “If this child is here when that bandit returns, his life is finished! I might as well abandon him now to the river, and let life or death take its own course. Perhaps Heaven, taking pity on him, will send someone to his rescue and to have him cared for. Then we may have a chance to meet again.” She was afraid, however, that future recognition would be difficult; so she bit her finger and wrote a letter with her blood, stating in detail the names of the parents, the family history, and the reason for the child’s abandonment. She also bit off a little toe from the child’s left foot to establish a mark of his identity. Taking one of her own inner garments she wrapped the child and took him out of the mansion when no one was watching. Fortunately the mansion was not far from the river. Reaching the bank, the lady burst into tears and wailed long and loud. She was about to toss the child into the river when she caught sight of a plank floating by the river bank. At once she prayed to Heaven, after which she placed the child on the plank and tied him securely to it with some rope. She fastened the letter written in blood to his chest, pushed the plank out into the water, and let it drift away. With tears in her eyes, the lady went back to the mansion, but we shall say no more of that.","He received the melons, and asked the man his name and whence he came. Liu replied, “I am from Junzhou and my name is Liu Chun. As my wife had committed suicide, I was willing to leave my home and children, and to sacrifice my life for my emperor, and therefore present the melons as my tribute.” When the Ten Judges heard this, they sent one of the demons to find the soul of Liu’s wife, and bring her to see him. The Judges also looked up the Records of Life and Death. Both the husband and wife were destined to become immortals. Yama said to one of his demons, “Go at once and bring her here.” The demon replied, “She arrived here long ago and her corpse has decomposed by now. Where can we put her soul?” Yama turned up the Records of Life and Death again. “The emperor’s sister, Princess Li Ruying, should be dead by now. Take her body and let the soul of Liu’s wife occupy it.” Having received his orders, the demon took Liu and his wife out of Hell. And so the princess’ body was given Mrs. Liu’s soul. The emperor, seeing his sister reviving, began to congratulate the royal princess, but she, possessing the soul of Liu’s wife, was indignant, saying she was not a princess, but the wife of a common man. It took some time for Liu to get used to the idea of his wife’s soul in the body of the princess, but in time they remembered their former earthly experiences together, and were reconciled. Guanyin. 10 Xuanzang Starts Out on His Mission THE EMPEROR SENT ONE OF his Ministers to Kaifeng in Henan in search of the man Shang Liang, who had laid up great treasure in Hell, and from whom the emperor had borrowed. The emperor sent an immense amount of gold and silver to repay the loan, but the man denied that he had lent money to the emperor, and would not receive it. On hearing of the disinterestedness of the man and his wife in refusing the money, the emperor ordered a temple to be built in honor of the family.","Time flew by, and one day, when Liu Hong was far away on official business and Wenjiao was thinking sadly about her mother-in-law and husband, she was suddenly overwhelmed with fatigue and collapsed with agonizing stomach cramps. While she was giving birth, a voice whispered to her: “I am the Star Spirit of the South Pole. Guanyin sends you this baby, for he is an exceptional child and one day will be famous throughout China. But when that bandit returns, he will try to kill the boy. You must protect him. The dragon king has rescued your husband, and one day your family will be reunited and your injustices avenged. Remember everything that I’ve told you. Now wake up!” Coming to from her stupor, Wenjiao hugged her baby, recalling the spirit’s words. But she could not think of how to protect him, and when Liu Hong returned he ordered her to drown the baby. “It’s too late to go out to the river tonight,” Wenjiao argued. “Wait till tomorrow.” As luck would have it, the following morning Liu Hong was sent away on urgent business. Liu Hong will kill the baby as soon as he returns, Wenjiao thought. I might as well leave him in the river and hope that Heaven will take pity and send someone to rescue him. To help identify him in the future, she bit her finger and wrote a letter in blood giving the name of his parents and the reasons she had abandoned the child, then bit off the child’s left little toe. She wrapped the baby in her underclothes and, when no one was around, slipped out to the river near the governor’s house. Weeping bitterly, she was about to throw the child into the river when she spotted a plank near the riverbank. After praying to Heaven, she tied the baby to the wood, tucked the letter next to his chest, and pushed the plank down the river. Having watched it drift away, she returned tearfully to the house.","Time flew by. One day, when Liu Hong was far away on official business, the young lady was in a summerhouse in the official residence sighing sadly as she thought of her mother-in-law and her husband. Suddenly she felt weak and her belly started to ache. She fell to the ground unconscious, and before she knew it she gave birth to a son. She heard a voice in her ear saying, “Man-tang-qiao, you must do as I tell you. I am the Lord of the Southern Pole Star, and I have come to give you this son on the orders of the Bodhisattva Guanyin. One day he will be extraordinarily famous. When the villainous Liu comes back he will certainly want to kill this boy, so you must look after him with great care. Your husband has been rescued by the dragon king; one day you will be reunited with him and your son, and your sufferings will be at an end. Remember my words. Wake up, wake up!” When the young lady came to she remembered every word he had spoken, but as she wrapped the baby tight in swaddling clothes, she could not think what to do. When Liu Hong came back he wanted to drown the child the moment he saw him, but the young lady said, “It's already dark: we can throw him in the river tomorrow.” Fortunately Liu Hong had to go a long way away on urgent business the next day. “If I wait till that villain returns my son will be killed,” thought the young lady, “so the best thing would be to abandon him in the river as soon as possible and let fate determine whether he is to live or do die. If Heaven is merciful someone will rescue the boy and bring him up, and we shall be reunited one day.” Then, worrying that she might not be able to recognize him, she bit open her finger and wrote a letter in blood giving a full account of his parentage and background. Then she bit off the little toe of the child's left foot to be an identifying mark, wrapped him up in one of her own shifts, and carried him out of the official residence when nobody was looking. Luckily the residence was not far from the river bank. When she reached it she wept for a while and was just going to throw him in when she noticed a board floating beside the bank. The young lady bowed to Heaven in her gratitude and tied the child to the board with her sash, placing the blood letter next to his chest. Then she pushed him out into the stream to go where he would and returned to the yamen in tears."
那大圣正与七十二洞妖王，并四健将分饮仙酒，一闻此报，公然不理道：“今朝有酒今朝醉，莫管门前是与非！”说不了，一起小妖又跳来道：“那九个凶神，恶言泼语，在门前骂战哩！”大圣笑道：“莫睬他。‘诗酒且图今日乐，功名休问几时成。’”说犹未了，又一起小妖来报：“爷爷！那九个凶神已把门打破了，杀进来也！”大圣怒道：“这泼毛神，老大无礼！本来不与他计较，如何上门来欺我？”即命独角鬼王，领帅七十二洞妖王出阵，老孙领四健将随后。那鬼王疾帅妖兵，出门迎敌，却被九曜恶星一齐掩杀，抵住在铁板桥头，莫能得出。,"The great sage was drinking the immortal wine with the seventy-two cave demon kings and the four strong generals. When he heard this report, he blatantly ignored it: ""If you are drunk at the moment, don't worry about right or wrong in front of the door!"" The little demon jumped up again and said: ""Those nine fierce gods, swearing and swearing in front of the door!"" The great sage laughed and said, ""Don't pay attention to him."" '"" Before he could talk, another little demon came to report: ""Grandpa! Those nine fierce gods have already broken the door, and they are coming in!"" The great sage said angrily: ""This hairy god, the boss is rude! I didn't want to be with him. How can you come to bully me?"" He ordered the one-horned ghost king to lead the seventy-two cave demon kings to battle, and the old grandson led the four strong generals to follow. The ghost king was swiftly commanding the demon soldiers and went out to meet the enemy, but was killed by the evil stars of the Nine Lights, and stood at the head of the iron bridge.","Our Great Sage was just sharing the Heavenly wine with the four mighty commanders and the monster kings of seventy-two caves. Hearing this announcement, he said in a most nonchalant manner, “If you have wine today, get drunk today; Mind not the troubles in front of your door!” Scarcely had he uttered this proverb when another group of imps came leaping and said, “Those nine savage gods are trying to provoke battle with foul words and nasty language.” “Don’t listen to them,” said the Great Sage, laughing. “Let us seek today’s pleasure in poetry and wine, And cease asking when we may achieve glory or fame.” Hardly had he finished speaking when still another flock of imps arrived to report, “Father, those nine savage gods have broken down the door, and are about to fight their way in!” “These reckless, witless gods!” said the Great Sage angrily. “They really have no manners! I was not about to quarrel with them. Why are they abusing me to my face?” He gave the order for the One-Horn Demon King to lead the monster kings of seventy-two caves to battle, adding that old Monkey and the four mighty commanders would follow in the rear. The Demon King swiftly led his troops of ogres to go out to fight, but they were ambushed by the Nine Luminaries and pinned down right at the head of the sheet iron bridge.","The little monkey demons were frightened and ran in saying, “Outside there are nine fierce spirits, who say that they have been sent as messengers from Heaven to capture the Great Sage. They are cursing and swearing outside the gate.” At that time the Great Sage was drinking wine with his four great generals. Though he heard these words, he paid no attention to them and said, “This morning we have wine and we will take our fill, and never mind what is outside.” Before they had finished speaking, a whole crowd of little monkeys rushed in and cried, “Great King, the nine fierce gods have broken through the gate and are rushing in and killing all before them.” The Great Sage was very angry, ordered his commander-in-chief, “Lead out twenty-two generals of the monkey demons to fight. I and my four bodyguards will follow.” Then the commander-in-chief led them out to meet the enemy and the nine fierce officers annihilated them all before they came to the iron bridge.","Just then, Monkey was enjoying a few cups of heavenly wine with seventy-six of his closest friends. He seemed perfectly unfazed by the news of what was going on outside. “Drink your wine while it’s warm,” he proverbialized. “Never mind the brewing storm.” Another cohort of fiends charged over. “Those rough gods say they’re about to break down the door.” “Seek not worldly fame or gain,” the Great Sage continued. “Except wine and verse, all is in vain.” Now a third gaggle of monkeys barreled up. “They’ve smashed in the door and are fighting their way into the cave.”","The Great Sage, who was just then sharing the immortal liquor with the seventy-two kings of the monsters and his four Stalwart Generals, paid no attention to the report, saying: “Today we have wine so today we celebrate: To hell with what's happening outside the gate.” But before the words were out of his mouth another group of little devils came in. “Those nine evil gods are using foul and provocative language to challenge us to fight,” they announced. “Never mind them,” said the Great Sage with a laugh. “With verse and wine we're happy today; Who cares when fame will come our way?” But before these words were out of his mouth yet another group of devils came rushing in. “Sir, those nine evil gods have smashed the gates and are charging in.” “The stinking gods!” exploded the Great Sage, “What nerve! I never wanted a fight with them, so why should they come here to push us around?” He thereupon ordered the One-horned Monster King to lead the seventy-two monster kings into battle while he followed them with the four Stalwart Generals. The monster king hastily assembled the devil soldiers and sallied forth to meet the enemy. They were all stopped by a charge by the Nine Bright Shiners, who held the head of the iron bridge so that no one could enter or leave."
只为心高图罔极，不分上下乱规箴。,"Just for the sake of being arrogant and arrogant, regardless of the rules and regulations.","Because pride has sought to scale the limits, Ignoring hierarchy to flout the law.","WHEN THE GREAT SAGE WAS ESCORTED by the heavenly host to the new demon terrace, he was slung to a beam, but neither knife nor hatchet nor sword had touched his body.","There, they chopped him with a knife, minced him with a hatchet, stabbed him with a spear, and slashed him with a sword—all without the slightest effect.","It is because his ambition was high, his plans far-reaching, He did not respect authority, and he smashed convention."

却说那怪败了阵回，方才喘定，又听得有人推得水响，忽起身观看，原来是八戒执了钯推水。那怪举杖当面高呼道：“那和尚那里走！仔细看打！”八戒使钯架住道：“你是个甚么妖精，敢在此间挡路？”那妖道：“你是也不认得我。我不是那妖魔鬼怪，也不是少姓无名。”八戒道：“你既不是邪妖鬼怪，却怎生在此伤生？你端的甚么姓名，实实说来，我饶你性命。”那怪道：,"However, he said that the monster had been defeated, and he had just breathed a sigh of relief. He heard someone push the water again, and suddenly got up to watch. The monster raised his stick and shouted in front of him: ""Where is the monk going! Watch carefully!"" Bajie made Palladium stand up and said: ""What kind of fairy are you, dare to block the way here?"" The demon said: ""You don't even know it. Me. I'm not that monster, nor is there a nameless name."" Bajie said, ""You're not an evil monster, so how could you be born here and hurt your life? What name do you use? To be honest, I'll spare your life."" The strange said :","We now tell you about that monster, who went back to his home in defeat. He had barely caught his breath when he heard someone pushing water, and as he rose to take a look, he saw Eight Rules pushing his way through with his rake. That monster lifted his staff and met him face to face, crying, “Monk, watch where you are going or you’ll receive a blow from this!” Using the rake to block the blow, Eight Rules said, “What sort of a monster are you that you dare to bar our way?” “So you don’t recognize me,” said the monster. “I’m no demon or fiend, nor do I lack a name or surname.” “If you are no demon or fiend,” said Eight Rules, “why do you stay here and take human lives? Tell me your name and surname, and I’ll spare your life.” The monster said:",,"“Agony!” howled Monkey, fleeing in pain. Seeing him retreat, Pigsy followed, trailing his rake. The fiend returned triumphantly to the cave and tidied away her tridents. “I feel terrible!” groaned Monkey, gripping his head, his face contorted with pain. “It was going so well,” Pigsy asked him. “Why did you suddenly run away yelping with pain?” “Ow! Ow!” Monkey responded. “Have you got a headache?” asked Sandy. “No!” replied Monkey, hopping about. “I don’t know what she stabbed my head with, but the pain was so unbearable I had to retreat.” “You’re always boasting about your head,” Pigsy said, smirking, “about how you toughened it up through meditation and whatnot. How come it can’t stand a little tap with a trident?” “True.” Monkey was puzzled.","The ogre had now recovered his breath after his earlier defeat, and when he heard someone pushing the waters aside he leapt to his feet to look. Seeing that it was Pig brandishing his rake, the monster raised his staff and shouted at him, “Where do you think you're going, monk? Watch out, and take this.” Pig warded off the blow with his rake and replied. “Who are you, evil spirit, and why are you blocking the way?” “You may not realize who I am,” the monster replied, “but I'm no fiend, demon, ghost or monster, and I don't lack a name either.” “If you're not a fiend, a demon, or a monster, then why do you live here taking life? Tell me your name truthfully and I'll spare you life.” “I,” the monster replied, “Have had a divine essence since childhood,"
一时间丹满酒醒，又自己揣度道：“不好！不好！这场祸，比天还大；若惊动玉帝，性命难存。走！走！走！不如下界为王去也！”他就跑出兜率宫，不行旧路，从西天门，使个隐身法逃去。即按云头，回至花果山界。但见那旌旗闪灼，戈戟光辉，原来是四健将与七十二洞妖王，在那里演习武艺。大圣高叫道：“小的们！我来也！”众怪丢了器械，跪倒道：“大圣好宽心！丢下我等许久，不来相顾！”大圣道：“没多时！没多时！”且说且行，径入洞天深处。四健将打扫安歇叩头礼拜毕。俱道：“大圣在天这百十年，实受何职？”大圣笑道：“我记得才半年光景，怎么就说百十年话？”健将道：“在天一日，即在下方一年也。”大圣道：“且喜这番玉帝相爱，果封做‘齐天大圣’，起一座齐天府，又设安静、宁神二司，司设仙吏侍卫。向后见我无事，着我看管蟠桃园。近因王母娘娘设‘蟠桃大会’，未曾请我，是我不待他请，先赴瑶池，把他那仙品、仙酒，都是我偷吃了。走出瑶池，踉踉跄跄误入老君宫阙，又把他五个葫芦金丹也偷吃了。但恐玉帝见罪，方才走出天门来也。”,"Dan Man sobered up for a while, and then speculated: ""Not good! Not good! This disaster is bigger than the sky; if the Jade Emperor is disturbed, his life will be hard to save. Go! Go! Go! ""He ran out of the Tusita Palace, did not go the old way, and escaped through the Xitianmen using a stealth method. That is, press the cloud head and return to the Huaguo Mountain boundary. But seeing that the flag was shining brightly and the halberd was shining, it turned out to be the four strong generals and the seventy-two cave demon kings, practicing martial arts there. The Great Sage shouted loudly, ""You little ones! I'll come too!"" The monsters dropped their equipment and knelt down and said, ""The Great Sage is so relieved! Leave me and wait for a long time, so I won't come to take care of you!"" The Great Sage said, ""It won't be long. It won't be long!"" Let's talk and walk, and enter the depths of the cave. The four health workers will clean and rest in peace and kowtow to the end of their prayers. All said: ""The great sage has been in the sky for one hundred years, what is the role of the great sage?"" The great sage smiled and said: ""I remember only half a year, so why do you talk about a hundred years?"" One year below."" The Great Sage said, ""I am delighted that the Jade Emperors fell in love with each other, and if they were named the 'Great Sage of Equalling Heaven', they built an Equalling Heaven Mansion, and set up two divisions of Jingjing and Ningshen, and set up immortal officials and guards. Seeing that I have nothing to do, let me take care of the Pantao Garden. Recently, because the Queen Mother set up a 'Pantao Conference', she never invited me, so I didn't wait for him to invite me. I went to Yaochi first, and I stole his immortal products and immortal wine. He walked out of the Jade Pond, staggered into Laojun's palace by mistake, and stole five of his gourd golden pills. But I was afraid that the Jade Emperor would be guilty, so I just walked out of the gate of heaven.""","In a moment, the effect of the elixir had dispelled that of the wine, and he again thought to himself, “Bad! Bad! I have brought on myself calamity greater than Heaven! If the Jade Emperor has knowledge of this, it’ll be difficult to preserve my life! Go! Go! Go! I’ll go back to the Region Below to be a king.” He ran out of the Tushita Palace and, avoiding the former way, left by the West Heaven Gate, making himself invisible by the magic of body concealment. Lowering the direction of his cloud, he returned to the Flower-Fruit Mountain. There he was greeted by flashing banners and shining spears, for the four mighty commanders and the monster kings of seventy-two caves were engaging in a military exercise. “Little ones,” the Great Sage called out loudly, “I have returned!” The monsters dropped their weapons and knelt down, saying, “Great Sage! What laxity of mind! You left us for so long, and did not even once visit us to see how we were doing.” “It’s not that long!” said the Great Sage. “It’s not that long!” They walked as they talked, and went deep inside the cave dwelling. After sweeping the place clean and preparing a place for him to rest, and after kowtowing and doing homage, the four mighty commanders said, “The Great Sage has been living for over a century in Heaven. May we ask what appointment he actually received?” “I recall that it’s been but half a year,” said the Great Sage, laughing. “How can you talk of a century?” “One day in Heaven,” said the commanders, “is equal to one year on Earth.” The Great Sage said, “I am glad to say that the Jade Emperor this time was more favorably disposed toward me, and he did indeed appoint me Great Sage, Equal to Heaven. An official residence was built for me, and two departments—Peace and Quiet, and Serene Spirit—were established, with bodyguards and attendants in each department. Later, when it was found that I carried no responsibility, I was asked to take care of the Garden of Immortal Peaches. Recently the Lady Queen Mother gave the Grand Festival of Immortal Peaches, but she did not invite me. Without waiting for her invitation, I went first to the Jasper Pool and secretly consumed the food and wine. Leaving that place, I staggered into the palace of Laozi and finished up all the elixir stored in five gourds. I was afraid that the Jade Emperor would be offended, and so I decided to walk out of the Heaven Gate.”","With the pills and the wine working in him he did not feel comfortable, and said, “If the Jade Emperor is disturbed I shall fear for my life. It is better for me to go down and be a king upon earth.” So he ran out of the Polar Star Mansion. He had not gone far from the Western Gate of Heaven before he made himself invisible, got on the clouds, and returned to his old home in the mountain. The Monkey Upsets the Peach Banquet. Then he shouted out, “My little ones, I have returned.” They all knelt and cried out, “You, Great Sage, have been very thoughtless of us; you have left us for so long a time without coming back.” He replied, “Not long, not long at all,” and as he spoke he walked on and went far into the cave. When the four generals had kowtowed before him, they said, “Oh Great Sage, you have been in Heaven for a hundred years, what honors have you received?” The Great Sage laughed and said, “It seems to me only six months since I left you. Why do you speak of a hundred years?” The generals said, “One day in heaven is equal to one year on earth.” The Great Sage said, “I am glad to tell you that the Jade Emperor was kind to me this time, and gave me the title of being Equal to Heaven, and let me live in the Palace of the Equal of Heaven, and I had servants to wait on me. Seeing that I had nothing to do, he appointed me to look after the Peach Orchard. Then followed the great Banquet of the Queen of Heaven. Because I was not invited to it, I went to the Celestial Lake Palace where the banquet was to be held, and finding none of the guests had arrived and that everything had been prepared and all the dishes laid out, I stealthily tasted them and drank the wine. On leaving I lost my way and got into the Mansion of the Ancient of Days, where I found five gourds full of the Pills of Immortality. These I also stealthily swallowed. Fearing that the Jade Emperor might find fault with me, I left Heaven altogether and returned here.”","The elixir immediately woke him from his intoxication and enabled him to make a sober analysis of the situation. “Bad! Very bad! If the Jade Emperor finds out about this, he’ll skin me alive. What to do? Run away! Run away! Down to earth, where I’ll go back to being a king.” In the interest of discretion, he chose the West Gate rather than the South Gate out of Heaven (having taken the precaution of making himself invisible first) and landed on Flower-Fruit Mountain. “I’m back, little ones!” he announced. The throng of monkeys and cave demons—then in the middle of their military training—dropped their weapons in surprise and kneeled. “You were enjoying yourself so much in Heaven, you forgot all about us,” they said reproachfully. “But I’ve only been gone half a year!” Monkey laughed, sweeping back onto his throne. “Remember that one day in Heaven is a year on earth,” his generals reminded him. “You’ve been gone well over a century. What job did the Jade Emperor give you this time?” “This time,” Monkey reported, “the Jade Emperor saw sense and appointed me Great Sage Equal to Heaven. He built me a palace and gave me two departments and a ministerial staff. But it turned out that I had nothing to do, so they put me in charge of the Orchard of Immortal Peaches. When the Queen Mother failed to invite me to a banquet, I crashed her palace and secretly guzzled all the food and wine for the feast. Then I stumbled by mistake into Laozi’s palace, and since he wasn’t around I polished off all his elixirs. After that, I decided to lie low for a while. So here I am.”","Before long he was full of pills and quite sober. “This is terrible,” he thought, “this is a colossal disaster. If the Jade Emperor is shocked by this, I'm done for. I must get out of here. I'd be much better off as a king in the lower world.” He rushed out of the Tushita Palace, avoiding his usual route. Using a spell to make himself invisible, he left by the West Gate of Heaven, and went straight down to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit by cloud. When he got there he saw flags, banners, spears and halberds gleaming in the sun: the four Stalwart Generals and the seventy-two kings of the monsters were holding military exercises. “Children, I'm back,” shouted the Great Sage in a loud voice, and all the fiends dropped their weapons and fell to their knees. “You don't care, do you, Great Sage?” they said. “It's been so long since you left us, and you never came back to see us.” “I haven't been long, I haven't been long,” protested the Great Sage, and as they talked they walked into the innermost part of the cave. When the four Stalwart General's had tidied the place up and made him sit down, they kowtowed to him and asked, “What office did you hold, Great Sage, during your century and more in Heaven?” The Great Sage laughed and said, “As far as I can remember it was only six months, so why do you say it was over a century?” “A day in Heaven is the same as a year on earth,” the Stalwart Generals replied. “I was lucky this time,” said the Great Sage. “The Jade Emperor took a liking to me and ennobled me as the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. He had an Equaling Heaven Residence built for me, complete with a Tranquillity Office and a Calm Divinity Office with Immortal functionaries, attendants and guards. Later on, when he saw that I had nothing to do, he put me in charge of the Peach Orchard. Recently the Queen Mother Goddess gave a Peach Banquet, but she didn't invite me. Instead of waiting for an invitation, I went to the Jade Pool and stole all the immortal food and drink. I staggered away from the Jade Pool and blundered into Lord Lao Zi's palace, and there I ate up his five gourds of pills of immortality. Then I got out through the heavenly gates and came here because I was scared that the Jade Emperor was going to punish me.”"

At that time, he was drunk and drowsy, and he was pouring around. Cheng Xiong crashed into the Guanghan Palace, and the Merry Fairy came to meet. Seeing his appearance holding people's souls, the old mortal heart is hard to destroy. There is no disrespect at all, and Chang'e is pulled to accompany her to rest. Repeatedly disobeying, hiding in the east and hiding in dissatisfaction. The color is like the sky and the thunder is like thunder, which almost shook the sky. The picket spirit officer played the Jade Emperor, and that day I was my fate. The siege of Guanghan is not ventilated, and it is difficult to escape without a door to advance and retreat. But I was held by the gods, and I was not afraid of wine in my heart. He was escorted to Lingxiao to see the Jade Emperor, and asked the execution according to the law. Thanks to Taibai Li Jinxing, he went out to work and said it in person. The punishment was changed and the heavy responsibility was 2,000 hammers, and the flesh was broken. The liberation was banished from Tianguan, and Fuling Mountain went down to map the family business. I was reincarnated by mistake because of my guilt, and my common name is Pig Ganghene. Hearing the words, the traveler said: ""You are originally the lower realm of the Tianpeng Water God, and you know my old grandson's name. ""That strange voice: ""Hey! You slandered Bima Wen, when you were in that disaster, you made me wait for a long time, and today you come here to deceive people! Don't be rude, eat me a palladium!"" , raise the stick and hit the head. The two of them gambled and fought in the dark night in the middle of the mountain. Good to kill: The golden eyes of the walker are like lightning, and the eyes of the demon are like silver flowers. This one is sprayed with colorful mist, and the other is full of red clouds. Breathing out, the red glow is bright at dusk, and the mouth is sprayed with colorful fog and luminous luminosity. Golden hoop rod, nine-toothed palladium, two heroes can be boasted: one is the great saint coming to the world, and the other is the marshal descending to the end of the world. The one who became a monster because of his loss of power, this one who escaped suffering and worshipped the monk's family. The palladium is like a dragon stretching its claws, and the stick is like a phoenix wearing a flower. That Dao, you broke a relationship like killing your father! This is what you should take for raping a young girl! Gossip, chaos, often come and go. Look at the battle till dawn, the goblin's arms are sore and numb. From the second watch, the two of them fought until the east turned white. The monster couldn't meet the enemy, and fled after defeat, but still turned into a gust of wind, walked back into the cave, closed the door, and did not come out again. The traveler saw a stone tower outside the door of the cave, with three characters written on it, ""Yunzhan Cave"", and seeing that it was strange, the sky was bright, but he thought: ""I am afraid that Master will wait, and go back to see him, and then catch this man again. It's not too late."" Follow the clouds a little and arrive at Gao Lao Zhuang early.","Because Queen Mother gave the Peaches Feast— When she met her guests at the Jasper Pool— My mind turned hazy for I got dead drunk, A shameless rowdy reeling left and right. Boldly I barged into Vast Cold Palace15 Where the charming fairy received me in. When I saw her face that would snare one’s soul, My carnal itch of old could not be stopped! Without regard for manners or for rank, I grabbed Miss Chang’e16 asking her to bed. For three or four times she rejected me: Hiding east and west, she was sore annoyed. My passion sky-high I roared like thunder, Almost toppling the arch of Heaven’s gate. Inspector General17 told the Emperor Jade; I was destined that day to meet my fate. The Vast Cold completely enclosed airtight Left me no way to run or to escape. Then I was caught by the various gods, Undaunted still, for wine was in my heart. Bound and taken to see the Emperor Jade, By law I should have been condemned to death. It was Venus the Gold Star, Mr. Li, Who left the ranks and knelt to beg for me. My punishment changed to two thousand blows, My flesh was torn; my bones did almost crack. Alive! I was banished from Heaven’s gate To make my home beneath the Fuling Mount. An errant womb’s my sinful destination: Stiff-Bristle Hog’s my worldly appellation!” When Pilgrim heard this, he said, “So you are actually the Water God of the Heavenly Reeds, who came to earth. Small wonder you knew old Monkey’s name.” “Curses!” cried the monster. “You Heaven-defying BanHorsePlague! When you caused such turmoil that year in Heaven, you had no idea how many of us had to suffer because of you. And here you are again to make life miserable for others! Don’t give me any lip! Have a taste of my rake!” Pilgrim, of course, was unwilling to be tolerant; lifting high his rod, he struck at the monster’s head. The two of them thus began a battle in the middle of the mountain, in the middle of the night. What a fight! Pilgrim’s gold pupils blazed like lightning; The monster’s round eyes flashed like silver blooms. This one spat out colored fog: That one spouted crimson mist. The spouted crimson mist lit up the dark; The colored fog spat out made bright the night. The golden-hooped rod; The nine-pronged muckrake. Two true heroes most worthy of acclaim: One was the Great Sage descended to earth; One was a Marshal who came from Heaven. That one, for indecorum, became a monster; This one, to flee his ordeal, bowed to a monk. The rake lunged like a dragon wielding his claws: The rod came like a phoenix darting through flowers. That one said: “Your breaking up a marriage is like patricide!” This one said: “You should be arrested for raping a young girl!” Such idle words! Such wild clamor! Back and forth the rod blocked the rake. They fought till dawn was about to break, When the monster’s two arms felt sore and numb. From the time of the second watch, the two of them fought until it was growing light in the east. That monster could hold out no longer and fled in defeat. He changed once more into a violent gust of wind and went straight back to his cave, shutting the doors tightly and refusing to come out. Outside the cave, Pilgrim saw a large stone tablet, which had on it the inscription, “Cloudy Paths Cave.” By now, it was completely light. Realizing that the monster was not going to come out, Pilgrim thought to himself, “I fear that Master may be anxiously waiting for me. I may as well go back and see him before returning here to catch the monster.” Mounting the clouds, he soon arrived at Old Gao village.",,"Red Boy rudely quizzed her. “Monkey’s sidekick?” When Guanyin did not reply, Red Boy drove his lance at her heart, upon which she vanished into a ray of golden light. “Why did you give up so easily?” demanded Monkey. “Watch what he does next,” she shushed him. Red Boy was very pleased with himself. “That Guanyin was completely useless. I’ll try out her dais for myself.” The moment he sat down, arms and legs folded, Guanyin shouted “Disappear!” and the flowers and leaves that had been concealing the swords vanished, leaving Red Boy sitting on thirty-six heavenly points. From below, Hui’an struck the handles hundreds of times so that they pierced Red Boy’s legs over and over again. When the demon tried to pull out the swords, Guanyin recited a spell to turn the blades into hooks that held fast to his body. Red Boy finally begged for mercy. “I did not realize how powerful you were, Guanyin. Spare me and I’ll follow your Buddhist laws.” “You promise to take the commandments?” Red Boy nodded, desperate to live. Guanyin shaved off almost all his hair except for three tufts plaited into tiny braids. “Disappear!” she then called, and the swords fell away, leaving Red Boy completely unscarred. But as soon as the swords and the pain had gone, and Red Boy realized he had been given a truly undignified hairstyle, he lunged again at Guanyin with his lance. Guanyin produced another golden circlet from her sleeve—partner to Monkey’s headache hoop. With one wave, it became five rings. When she threw them at Red Boy, one attached to his head, the other four to his hands and feet. “Now time for the spell—no, not yours,” she reassured Monkey, spotting his look of horror. “This one’s just for Red Boy.” As she recited, the demonic boy scratched his cheeks and ears, curled himself into a ball, and writhed this way and that. When Guanyin stopped after several recitations, Red Boy discovered that there were golden hoops around his neck, wrists, and ankles—no amount of tugging dislodged them. “How d’you like your bracelets of good behavior?” Monkey taunted him. When Red Boy charged at Monkey with his lance, Guanyin merely shouted “Close!” and Red Boy’s wrists fastened tightly to his sides. With one more spell, Guanyin’s vase scooped up all the water it had disgorged. “The boy wants educating,” Guanyin told Monkey. “I’ll take him back to the South Sea now, to train him as my attendant. You go and rescue the others.” And off Monkey went, for a happy reunion with Sandy, Tripitaka, and Pigsy.","When the Queen Mother gave a Peach Banquet, She invited many guests to the Jade Pool. As drunkenness clouded my mind that day, I lurched and staggered around. As I charged in drunken pride into the Cool Broad Palace I was greeted by an exquisite immortal maiden. At the sight of her beauty my soul was captivated, And I could not repress my mortal passions of old. Losing all sense of rank and dignity, I seized the beauty and asked her to sleep with me. Three times, four times she refused, Dodging and trying to hide in her distress. Great was the courage of my lust, and I roared like thunder, All but shaking down the gates of heaven. The Miraculous Inspecting Officer reported to the Jade Emperor, And from that day I was doomed. The Cool Broad Palace was closely surrounded. I could neither advance nor retreat: escape was impossible. Then I was arrested by the gods, But as I was still drunk I was not scared. I was marched to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to see the Jade Emperor, And, after questioning, sentenced to death. Luckily the Great White Planet Stepped forward, bowed low, and interceded. My sentence was commuted to two thousand strokes of the heavy rod, Which tore my flesh and all but smashed my bones. I was released alive and expelled from Heaven, So I tried to make a living on the Mount of Blessing. For my sins I was reborn from the wrong womb, And now I am known as Iron-haired Pig.” “So you are an earthly reincarnation of Marshal Tian Peng,” said Brother Monkey when he heard this. “ No wonder you knew my name.” “Ha,” the monster snorted angrily. “Your insane rebellion caused trouble for very many of us, Protector of the Horses. Have you come here to throw your weight around again? I'll teach you some manners. Take this!” Monkey was in no mood to spare him after this, and he struck at the monster's head with his cudgel. The pair of them fought a magnificent midnight battle on that mountainside: Monkey's golden pupils flashed with lightning; The monster's glaring eyes sparked silver. One disgorged coloured mist, The other breathed out red clouds. The red clouds lit up the night; The coloured mists illuminated the darkness. A gold-banded cudgel, A nine-toothed rake, And two splendid heroes. One a Great Sage down among the mortals, The other a marshal banished from Heaven. One had been stripped of his honors and become a monster, The other had been saved when he took service with a priest. When the rake attacked, it was like a dragon stretching its claws; The cudgel blocked it as nimbly as a phoenix flying through flowers. Pig said, “In wrecking my marriage your crime is as great as parricide.” Monkey replied, “You deserve to be arrested for raping that young girl.” Amid these exchanges And wild shouts, The cudgel and the rake crossed and clashed. They fought each other till the day began to dawn, And the monster's arms were tired right out. They fought from the second watch of the night until the sky began to grow light in the East. The monster, no longer able to resist his enemy, broke away and fled, turning himself into a hurricane again. He went straight back to his cave, shut the gates behind him, and did not come out. Monkey saw a stone tablet outside the cave on which was inscribed CLOUD PATHWAY CAVE. The monster did not come out again and it was now broad daylight, so Monkey thought that as his master might be waiting for him he had better go back to see him. He could come back later to catch the monster. He gave his cloud a kick and was back in Old Gao Village in an instant."
上有六张交椅，两山头挂着四季吊屏。,"There are six top chairs on the top, and the four seasons hanging screens are hung on the two hills.","There were six straight-backed chairs in the main hall, while hanging screens were mounted on the walls east and west just below the roof.",,"He then flew back out of the princess’s mouth as a cricket, returned to his true form, seized the fan, and strode out.",Pictures of the four seasons were hung on the walls at either end of the hall.

The master of the monastery inside said, ""Master, come to the abbot in the back to serve tea."" ” He then released the reins and led the horse, carried his luggage, turned around the main hall, entered the back room, and ordered his seat.","“Get up, get up! Don’t be afraid. We are noble priests who have come from the Great Tang Nation in the east.” The various monks then bowed courteously to him, and when they saw Tripitaka, they were even more reassured. One of the monks, who was the abbot of the monastery, said, “Let the holy fathers come to the living room in the back so that we may offer them some tea.” Untying the reins and leading the horse, they picked up the luggage and went past the main hall to the back of the monastery, where they sat down in orderly rows.",,"he now shouted, brandishing his sword. “The battle’s off. I promised my wife I’d spare your master. Pick him up at the back door and carry on to the west.","“Get up, get up, you've nothing to fear. I'm a lord from the land of the Great Tang empire in the East.” The monks all bowed to him, and could not feel easy until Sanzang appeared. “Please come and drink tea in my rooms,” said the abbot of the monastery. The horse was unloaded and led off, while they went round the main hall to a room at the back where they sat down according to their seniority."

住了云头，仔细看，果然是座好山。况正值春光时节，但见：万壑争流，千崖竞秀。鸟啼人不见，花落树犹香。雨过天连青壁润，风来松卷翠屏张。山草发，野花开，悬崖峭嶂；薛萝生，佳木丽，峻岭平岗。不遇幽人，那寻樵子？涧边双鹤饮，石上野猿狂。,"Live in the cloud head, look carefully, it really is a good mountain. The situation is in the spring season, but see: thousands of valleys compete for flow, and thousands of cliffs compete for show. Birds sing, no one is seen, flowers fall and trees are fragrant.

It was a spring day: The myriad valleys' streams compete, A thousand precipices vie in beauty. Where the birds call, no man is; When the blossoms fall, the trees are still fragrant. After the rain, the sky and the lowering cliff are moist; As the pines bend in the wind, they spread an emerald screen.

At that time, Tianpeng and Tianyou rushed out of the Lingxiao Palace and said, ""Please stay with the Tathagata a little longer, and my lord will come here."" The Buddha heard the words and looked back to pay his respects. In a few moments, I saw the luanyu of eight scenes, the jeweled cover of nine lights; the sound of mystic songs and wonderful music, the chanting of the immeasurable divine chapter; the scattered precious flowers, and the real fragrance, until the Buddha thanked him and said, ""I hope that Dafa will save the demons and evil spirits. Stop for a day, and invite all the immortals to do a feast for a while to thank you."" The Tathagata did not dare to disobey, so he put his palms together and thanked: ""The old monk has come here under the orders of the Great Heavenly Venerate, what is the magic power? ?"" The Jade Emperor sent a decree, that is, the gods of the cloud group, separately invited Sanqing, Siyu, Wulao, Liusi, Qiyuan, Baji, Jiuyao, Shidu, and Qianzhen Wansheng to come here to attend the meeting, and thank Buddha's kindness. . He also ordered the Four Heavenly Masters and the Nine Heavens Fairies to open the Jade Palace, the Taixuan Treasure Palace, and the Dongyang Jade Pavilion, and invite the Tathagata to sit on the Qibao Lingtai.

At that moment, however, Tianpeng11 and Tianyou, two celestial messengers, came running out of the Treasure Hall of Divine Mists and said, “We beg Tathāgata to wait a moment, please! Our Lord’s grand carriage will arrive momentarily.” When the Buddhist Patriarch heard these words, he turned around and waited with reverence. In a moment he did indeed see a chariot drawn by eight colorful phoenixes and covered by a canopy adorned with nine luminous jewels. The entire cortege was accompanied by the sound of wondrous songs and melodies, chanted by a vast celestial choir. Scattering precious blossoms and diffusing fragrant incense, it came up to the Buddha, and the Jade Emperor offered his thanks, saying, “We are truly indebted to your mighty dharma for vanquishing that monster. We beseech Tathāgata to remain for one brief day, so that we may invite the immortals to join us in giving you a banquet of thanks.” Not daring to refuse, Tathāgata folded his hands to thank the Jade Emperor, saying, “Your old monk came here at your command, Most Honorable Deva. Of what power may I boast, really? I owe my success entirely to the excellent fortune of Your Majesty and the various deities. How can I be worthy of your thanks?” The Jade Emperor then ordered the various deities from the Thunder Department to send invitations abroad to the Three Pure Ones, the Four Ministers, the Five Elders, the Six Women Officials,12 the Seven Stars, the Eight Poles, the Nine Luminaries, and the Ten Capitals. Together with a thousand immortals and ten thousand sages, they were to come to the thanksgiving banquet given for the Buddhist Patriarch. The Four Great Imperial Preceptors and the Divine Maidens of Nine Heavens were told to open wide the golden gates of the Jade Capital, the Treasure Palace of Primal Secret, and the Five Lodges of Penetrating Brightness. Tathāgata was asked to be seated high on the Numinous Terrace of Seven Treasures, and the rest of the deities were then seated according to rank and age before a banquet of dragon livers, phoenix marrow, juices of jade, and immortal peaches.","When Lord Buddha had subjugated Monkey, he called on Ananda and Kasyapa to return with him to the West. Then the immortal heavenly leaders came out of the Lingshao Hall and begged the Buddha to wait a little, till the Jade Emperor arrived. When Buddha heard this, he turned his head and looked up, and there were eight brilliant carriages and nine colored umbrellas, full of choristers singing, praising the Infinite Spirit, and scattering precious fragrant flowers. They came in front of Buddha and said, “Thanks to thy great mercy, the Monkey Demon has been subjugated. Will you not stay a day longer with us so that we may invite all the gods to a thanksgiving banquet?” Lord Buddha put his palms together and thanked them and said, “I came here in obedience to the Jade Emperor. Whatever power has been shown has been owing to his great blessing and all the gods. Please thank him for his kind thought.” Then the Jade Emperor ordered the Board of Thunder and all the gods to arrange themselves, and the Three Pure Ones and the Temple Gods, the Five Elders, the Six Officials and Seven Originals, the Eight Points, the Nine Stars, and the Ten Boards, in all ten thousand sages and saints; and all thank Lord Buddha for his favors. He also ordered the Four Celestial Generals and the Fairies of the Nine Heavens to open the Pearl Palace and the Precious Palace of the Great Mystery and the private rooms and invite Lord Buddha to sit on the top of the seven storied throne, and that seats be arranged for each guest and dishes with dragon livers and phoenix marrow, wine and peaches.","Their monkey-extirpation job done, the Buddha and his disciples were about to leave when the Jade Emperor’s chariot—canopied with jewels, drawn by eight bright phoenixes, escorted by wondrous music, and broadcasting blossoms and incense—drew up. “You have saved us with your blessed presence!” the emperor effused to the Buddha. “Please stay for the Great Banquet of Heavenly Peace so we can thank you properly.” “Oh, it was nothing,” said the Buddha modestly. “I am your humble servant. My powers pale in comparison to yours.” The golden gates to the Jade Capitol, the Palace of Primal Mystery, and the Institute of Penetrating Light were thrown open, and the Buddha was invited to sit on the emperor’s own dais. Some eleven thousand deities feasted on dragon livers, phoenix marrow, jade juice, and immortal peaches.","When he had eliminated the monkey fiend the Buddha told Ananda and Kasyapa to return with him to the Western paradise. At that moment Tian Peng and Tian You hurried out of the Hall of Miraculous Mist to say, “We beg the Tathagata to wait a moment as the Jade Emperor's chariot is coming.” The Buddha turned round and looked up, and an instant later he saw an eight-splendour imperial chariot and a nine-shining jeweled canopy appear to the sound of strange and exquisite music, and the chanting of countless sacred verses. Precious flowers were scattered and incense was burned. The Jade Emperor went straight up to the Buddha and said, “We are deeply indebted to the great Buddha's powers for wiping out the demon, and we hope that the Tathagata will spend a day here so that we may invite all the Immortals to a feast of thanksgiving.” The Buddha did not dare refuse, so putting his hands together he replied, “This old monk only came here in obedience to Your Celestial Majesty's command. What magic powers can I pretend to? This was all due to the wonderful good fortune of Your Celestial Majesty and the other gods. How could I possibly allow you to thank me?” The Jade Emperor then ordered all the gods of the Department of Thunder to split up and invite the Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors, the Five Ancients, the Six Superintendents, the Seven Main Stars, the Eight Points of the Compass, the Nine Bright Shiners, the Ten Chiefs, the Thousand Immortals, and the Ten Thousand Sages to a banquet to thank the Buddha for his mercy. Then he ordered the Four Great Heavenly Teachers and the Nine Heavenly Maidens to open the golden gates of the jade capital, and Palace of the Great Mystery, and the Tong Yang Jade Palace, invite the Tathagata to take his seat on the Throne of the Seven Precious Things, arrange the places for all the different groups of guests, and set out the dragon liver, phoenix bone-marrow, jade liquor, and magic peaches."
只因搅乱蟠桃会，十万天兵布网罗。,"Just because of disturbing the Pantao Society, one hundred thousand heavenly soldiers were snared.",A hundred thousand Heaven troops spread the net of God.,All the hosts of heaven arranged themselves in order to leave heaven.,We are gods dispatched to subdue the rebellious monkey.,"Just because he wrecked the banquet of peaches, A hundred thousand heavenly troops now spread their nets."
二人同携素手，共入兰房。次日五更三点，太宗驾坐金銮宝殿，文武众臣趋朝。太宗同道：“新科状元陈光蕊应授何官？”魏征丞相奏道：“臣查所属州郡，有江州缺官。乞我主授他此职。”太宗就命为江州州主，即令收拾起身，勿误限期。光蕊谢恩出朝，回到相府，与妻商议，拜辞岳丈岳母，同妻前赴江州之任。,"The two entered the orchid room together. The next day, at five o'clock and three o'clock, Taizong sat in the Golden Palace, and the civil and military officials rushed to the court. Taizong said, ""Which officer should Chen Guangrui, the champion of the new division, be granted?"" Prime Minister Wei Zheng said: ""The state and county to which the minister belongs, there is a shortage of officials in Jiangzhou. I beg my lord to grant him this post."" Taizong ordered him to be the governor of Jiangzhou. Pack up, don't miss the deadline. Guangrui Xie En left the court, returned to the prime minister's mansion, discussed with his wife, bid farewell to his husband-in-law and mother-in-law, and went to Jiangzhou with his wife.","The chief minister then gave a big banquet and everyone feasted merrily for a whole evening, after which the two of them walked hand in hand into the bridal chamber. At the fifth watch early next morning, Taizong took his seat in the Treasure Hall of Golden Chimes as civil and military officials attended the court. Taizong asked, “What appointment should the new zhuangyuan receive?” The prime minister Wei Zheng said, “Your subject has discovered that within our territory there is a vacancy at Jiangzhou. I beg my Lord to grant him this post.” Taizong at once made him governor of Jiangzhou and ordered him to leave without delay. After thanking the emperor and leaving the court, Guangrui went back to the house of the chief minister to inform his wife. He took leave of his father- and mother-in-law and proceeded with his wife to the new post at Jiangzhou.","But one of the ministers stepped forward and said, “Do not listen to these strange words of Minister Wei. From of old who does not know that spilt water cannot be gathered up again, and that when life is gone it does not return? Why do you raise these false hopes?” Minister Wei replied, “I have had some experience in these matters from my youth and know well some things. I am sure the emperor is not dead.” At this moment they heard repeated loud cries from the coffin, “You are drowning me, you are drowning me!” This terrified all the civil officers and military generals. The Empress and all the ladies of the court trembled with fear, and none dared approach the coffin. Happily the upright Duke Xu Mao, the fiery Prime Minister Wei Zheng, the brave Qin Jiong and the strong Hu Jingde all went to the coffin and cried, “What is it that troubles Your Majesty?","The minister gave a huge banquet and, after an evening’s revelry, the new couple retired hand in hand to the bridal chamber. At court early the next day, Taizong and his officials appointed Guangrui governor of Jiangzhou and ordered him to leave straightaway to take up the post. After thanking the emperor, Guangrui informed his wife and in-laws, and the newlyweds headed off to begin a new life.","The bride and groom went hand in hand into the bridal chamber. At the third quarter of the fifth watch the next morning Emperor Taizong took his throne in the Golden Chariot Hall, and the civil and military officials came to court. “What office should Chen Guangrui who came top in the examinations be given?” the Emperor asked, and the minister Wei Zheng replied, “Your subject has gone through the list of the prefectures and commanderies, and found that the district of Jiangzhou needs a prefect. I beg Your Majesty to give him this office.” The Emperor therefore appointed him prefect of Jiangzhou and ordered him to pack his belongings and set off as he had to be there by a set date. Chen Guangrui thanked the Emperor for his grace and withdrew. He went back to the minister's mansion and consulted his wife, then he took his leave of his parents-in-law and set off together with her for his post in Jiangzhou."
行者道：“这个叫做金蝉脱壳计，他将虎皮苫在此，他却走了。,"The walker said: ""This is called Jin Chan's escape plan, he put the tiger skin here, but he left.","Pilgrim replied, “This is called the trick of the gold cicada casting its shell. He left his skin covering the stone here to fool us, but he himself has escaped.",,Pausing only to remove his shirt and kilt—“so that I can really enjoy myself in there”—he dived into the cauldron and splashed happily about.,He put his tiger-skin over this rock and got away.
却说那三人穿林入里，只见那呆子绷在树上，声声叫喊，痛苦难禁。行者上前笑道：“好女婿呀！这早晚还不起来谢亲，又不到师父处报喜，还在这里卖解儿耍子哩！咄！你娘呢？你老婆呢？好个绷巴吊拷的女婿呀！”那呆子见他来抢白着羞，咬着牙，忍着疼，不敢叫喊。沙僧见了老大不忍，放下行李，上前解了绳索救下。呆子对他们只是磕头礼拜，其实羞耻难当，有《西江月》为证：色乃伤身之剑，贪之必定遭殃。佳人二八好容妆，更比夜叉凶壮。只有一个原本，再无微利添囊。好将资本谨收藏，坚守休教放荡。那八戒撮土焚香，望空礼拜。行者道：,"But they said that the three of them went through the forest and entered the forest, only to see the idiot stretched on the tree, screaming, and the pain was unbearable. The traveler stepped forward and said with a smile: ""Good son-in-law! Sooner or later, I won't get up to thank my relatives, and I won't report the good news to my master, and I'm still selling Jie'er here! Duh! Where's your mother? Where's your wife? My son-in-law!"" When the idiot saw him coming to grab Bai Bai, he was ashamed, gritted his teeth, endured the pain, and did not dare to shout. When Sha Seng saw the boss, he couldn't bear it, put down his luggage, stepped forward and untied the rope to save him. The idiots just kowtow to them. In fact, shame is hard to bear. There is ""Xijiang Moon"" as proof: Sex is a sword that hurts the body, and greed will surely suffer. The beauty Erba has good makeup and is more fierce than Yaksha. There is only one original, and there is no meager profit. It is good to keep the capital carefully, and stick to the suspension of education and debauchery. The eight precepts pinch the earth and burn incense, and look at the sky and pray. Walker said:","We shall tell you about the three of them who, on entering the forest, found Idiot tied to a tree. He was screaming continuously because of the unbearable pain. Pilgrim approached and said to him, laughing, “Dear son-in-law! It’s getting rather late, and you still haven’t got around to performing the proper ceremony of thanking your parents or announcing your marriage to Master. You are still having a grand old time playing games here! Hey! Where’s your mama? Where’s your wife? What a dear son-in-law, all bound and beaten!” When Idiot heard such ridicule, he was so mortified that he clenched his teeth to try to endure the pain without making any more noise. Sha Monk, however, could not bear to look at him; he put down the luggage and went forward to untie the ropes. After he was freed, Idiot could only drop to his knees and kowtow toward the sky, for he was filled with shame. For him we have as a testimony this lyric to the tune of “Moon Over West River”: Eros is a sword injurious: Live by it and you will be slain. The lady so fair and lovely at sixteen Is more vicious than a yakṣa! You have but one principal sum; You can’t add profit to your purse. Guard and keep well your precious capital, Which you must not squander and waste. Scooping up some dirt and scattering it like incense, Eight Rules bowed to the sky. “Did you recognize those bodhisattvas at all?” asked Pilgrim.",,"“I can take you.” A resigned Pigsy hopped onto a fast easterly cloud with the spirit, until they heard a commotion of voices and wind: the battle between Monkey and Bull Demon. “Yoo-hoo, Monkey! It’s me!” shouted Pigsy. Monkey took out on Pigsy his annoyance at having fallen into Bull Demon’s trap. “You’ve gone and properly messed things up here,” he grumbled at Pigsy, who was nonplussed until Monkey explained Bull Demon’s fraud through impersonation. Enraged at learning about the deception, Pigsy rushed at the bull demon, showering him with blows. Exhausted by a day’s battle, Bull Demon turned into a swan and flew off; Monkey pursued him as a gyrfalcon, trying to peck the swan’s eyes out. The bull demon went on the attack now as a yellow eagle; Monkey fought back as a black phoenix. Bull Demon next transformed into a musk deer; Monkey went after him as a hungry tiger. When Bull Demon became a leopard, Monkey pounced as a golden-eyed lion. Bull Demon was now a bear and Monkey an elephant, trying to wrap his python-like trunk around the bear. With a hoot of laughter, Bull Demon returned to his true form, a huge white bull, ten thousand feet long, eight thousand feet high. Monkey also became his real self and grew to a hundred thousand feet. This time, the forty-odd guardian deities that had been detailed to watch over the pilgrims and Monkey’s former antagonist Nezha pitched in to help Monkey. The outnumbered Bull Demon fled back to Iron-Fan’s cave on Jade-Cloud, shutting himself inside. By this point, Iron-Fan was all for surrendering, but Bull Demon insisted on continuing to fight.","The three of them went into the wood and saw the idiot tied up under a tree, yelling and howling in unbearable pain. Monkey went over to him and said with a laugh, “What a son-in-law! So late, and you still haven't got up to thank your mother-in-law or come to tell the good news to the master. Why are you still playing around here? Where's your mother-in-law? Where's your wife? You make a fine, strapped-up, well-beaten son-in-law!” The blockhead, burning with humiliation at being thus mocked, gritted his teeth to stop himself howling in his agony. Friar Sand was overcome with pity when he saw him, and putting down the luggage he went over and untied him. The idiot kowtowed to him in gratitude. He was suffering terrible remorse. There is a poem to the tune The Moon in the West River to prove it: Sex is a sword that wounds the body; Whoever lusts for it will suffer. A pretty girl of sixteen Is far more dangerous than a yaksha demon. There is only one Origin, And there are no extra profits to staff in the sack. Better store all your capital away, Guard it well, and don't squander it. Pig used a pinch of earth to represent burning incense and bowed in worship to Heaven. “Did you recognize the Bodhisattva?”"
欺天罔上思高位，凌圣偷丹乱大伦。恶贯满盈今有报，不知何日得翻身。”,"Bullying the sky without thinking of a high position, Ling Sheng steals pills and chaotic Dalun. The evil is full and full of rewards, and I don't know when I will turn over. ""","Craving high place, he flouted Heaven’s reign, Mocked saints and stole pills, breaking great relations. Evil, full to the brim, now meets retribution. We know not when he may find release.","But a change comes sudden to all resolved. When the next change comes, who can tell?","Their monkey-extirpation job done, the Buddha and his disciples were about to leave when the Jade Emperor’s chariot—canopied with jewels, drawn by eight bright phoenixes, escorted by wondrous music, and broadcasting blossoms and incense—drew up.","“The rebel against Heaven, wanting high position, Insulted Immortals, stole the pills, and destroyed morality. Today his terrible sins are being punished, Who knows when he will be able to rise again?”"
去来！”正是舍身拚命归西去，莫倚旁人自主张。,"come and go! ""It is to give up your life and go to the west, don't rely on others to advocate for yourself.","I might as well go on by myself!” So, he was prepared to Lay down his life and go toward the West, To be his own master and on none rely.","The Minister of Venus strove to make peace and said to Sun, “Oh monkey, you are too willful, you should remember past kindness.” “And what kindness have you shown me?” The Minister of Venus replied “I recommended you to be made the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven, but you did not behave yourself.”","A yellow goose-down cloak was draped over its shoulders, two bleached reeds were tied around its waist, and a necklace of nine skulls rattled around its neck. This tornado of a fiend went straight for Tripitaka. Monkey snatched Tripitaka off to higher, safer ground while Pigsy threw down the luggage, drew his rake, and engaged the monster on the riverbank.","I couldn't find him now even if I wanted to, and he wouldn't answer if I called him. I must be on my way.” So he had to strive with all his might to reach the West, looking after himself with nobody to help."
行者大怒，走进方丈屋里，把那触死鬼尸首抬出，选剥了细看，浑身更无那件宝贝，就把个方丈掘地三尺，也无踪影。行者忖量半晌，问道：“你这里可有甚么妖怪成精么？”院主道：,"The traveler was furious, walked into the abbot's house, carried out the dead body of the ghost, and took a closer look. The traveler thought about it for a while, and then asked, ""Do you have any monsters here that have turned into spirits?"" The master said:","Angrily, Pilgrim walked into the Patriarch’s room, pulled out the corpse of the old man rammed to death, and stripped him naked. The body was examined carefully, but the treasure was nowhere to be seen. Even if they had dug up three feet of the ground in that room, there would have been not a trace of it. Pilgrim thought silently for awhile and then asked, “Is there any monster around here who has become a spirit?” “If father hadn’t asked,” said the abbot, “he would have never known about this.",,"As soon as I mentioned you, the monster became even more bumptious. ‘Monster,’ I said to him, ‘don’t you lay a finger on my master, for I have a senior disciple with a doctorate in demon-defeating. When Monkey shows up, you’ll be dead before you’ve picked a burial ground.’","Monkey went into the abbot's quarters at the back in a great rage and carried out the corpse of the old monk who had killed himself. When he stripped the body he found no treasures on it, so he dug up the floor of his room to a depth of three feet, again without finding a sign of the cassock. Monkey thought for a moment and then asked, “Are there any monsters turned spirits around here?” “If you hadn't asked, sir, I'd never have imagined you wanted to know,” the abbot replied."
“徒弟呀，我这等磕头，你也就不拜他一拜，且立在旁边，只管哂笑，是何道理？”行者道：“你那里知道，象他这个藏头露尾的，本该打他一顿，只为看菩萨面上，饶他打尽彀了，他还敢受我老孙之拜？老孙自小儿做好汉，不晓得拜人，就是见了玉皇大帝、太上老君，我也只是唱个喏便罢了。”三藏道：“不当人子！莫说这空头话！快起来，莫误了走路。”那师父才起来收拾投西而去。,"""Apprentice, when I'm kowtowing, you won't bow to him, but stand beside him and just laugh. What's the point?"" The walker said, ""You know that someone who hides his head and shows his tail like him should have beaten him. Just to see the face of the Bodhisattva, I have spared him all the money, and he still dares to be worshipped by my old grandson? The old grandson has been a good man since he was a child, and he does not know how to worship people. Even when he met the Jade Emperor and Taishang Laojun, I also It's just a sing-along."" Sanzang said, ""Don't be a son of man! Don't say such empty words! Get up quickly, don't miss your walk."" Then the master got up and packed up and left.","“Disciple,” said the priest, “when I kowtowed like that, all you could do was to stand snickering by the side of the road, with not even a bow. Why?” “You wouldn’t know, would you?” said Pilgrim. “For playing a game of hide-and-seek like that with us, he really deserves a beating! But for the sake of the Bodhisattva, I’ll spare him, and that’s something already! You think he dares accept a bow from old Monkey? Old Monkey has been a hero since his youth, and he doesn’t know how to bow to people! Even when I saw the Jade Emperor and Laozi, I just gave them my greeting, that’s all!” “Blasphemy!” said Tripitaka. “Stop this idle talk! Let’s get going without further delay.” So the priest got up and prepared to set off again toward the West.","When Sun Wukong heard this, he paid, “Then we shall go back and tell Buddha about this!” At this the two said, “Take it easy! Just take whatever you want!” Thus the Master and disciples took several loads of books, which Zhu Bajie, Sha the Monk, and the horse carted away, after which they went to thank Lord Buddha. On the way they passed the Light Giving Buddha. He had overheard the conversation about the price of the books, and knew that they had been given “wordless scriptures.” He thought within himself, “Serves them right! Still, since the people in the East are unintelligent they will not understand the subtlety of the wordless scriptures, and as the Master has traveled far, he should have the written scriptures.” He ordered the pilgrims to be followed, and when their loads were opened, the pilgrims were indignant to find that they had no written scriptures, but only white paper. They decided to return and inform Buddha that they had been cheated, because they had not offered to pay for the books. The Master offered Ananda and Kasyapa the golden bowl, which the Chinese emperor and given him, in payment for the written scriptures.","Bring me my armor!” Buckled into a golden cuirass, Yellow-Robe—for it was he—swaggered out, sword in hand. “How dare you kick up such a rumpus at my door!” “I’m the representative of the Tang empire,” Pigsy somewhat embellished his status on the quest, “traveling west to seek scriptures. My master is the emperor’s own brother. If you’ve got him inside there, hand him over now or I’ll let my rake do the talking.” “Oh, yes, I’ve a Buddhist monk in here. I was just rustling up some human dumplings for him. Do join us.” His mouth watering, Pigsy was about to take up the invitation when Sandy pulled him back. “He’s lying. Tripitaka’s not allowed to eat human flesh, and neither are we.”","They're already much too far away to hear your prayers or see your kowtows, so why ever are you doing that?” “Disciple,” Sanzang replied, “what do you mean by standing beside the path sneering at me and not even making a single bow while I've done all those kowtows?” “You don't know anything,” Monkey retorted. “A deceitful pair like that deserve a thrashing. I let them off out of respect for the Bodhisattva. That's quite enough: they couldn't expect me to bow to them too, could they? I've been a tough guy since I was a kid, and I don't bow to anyone. Even when I meet the Jade Emperor or the Supreme Lord Lao Zi I just chant a 'na-a-aw' and that's all.” “You inhuman beast,” said Sanzang, “stop talking such nonsense. Get moving, and don't hold us up a moment longer.” With that Sanzang rose to his feet and they set off to the West."
比常更有百分光明！”却转头后边望望，呀！那里得甚房舍窗门，但只见些老槐高柳，兄弟们都睡在那绿莎茵上。那八戒醒来道：“哥哥，你嚷怎的？”行者道：“你睁开眼看看。”呆子忽抬头，见没了人家，慌得一毂辘爬将起来道：“我的马哩？”行者道：“树上拴的不是？”“行李呢？”行者道：“你头边放的不是？”,"Brighter than ever! But he turned his head and looked behind him, ah! There are no windows and doors in the house, but I saw some old Huai Gao Liu, and the brothers were sleeping on the green shade. The Bajie woke up and said, ""Brother, why are you yelling?"" of? ""Walker said:"" Open your eyes and see. The idiot suddenly raised his head, seeing that he was gone, he got up in a panic and said, ""My horse? The walker said: ""Isn't it tied to the tree?"" ""What about the luggage?"" The walker said: ""Isn't it placed next to your head?"" ""","I can see a hundred times better than before!” He then turned his head to look around. Ah! There were neither buildings nor halls, only some old locust trees and tall willows. The brothers were actually lying on a green grass meadow. Just then, Eight Rules began to stir, saying, “Elder Brother, why are you making all these noises?” “Open your eyes and take a look,” said Pilgrim. Raising his head, Idiot discovered that the house had disappeared. He was so startled that he scrambled up at once, crying, “Where’s my horse?” “Isn’t it over there, tied to a tree?” said Pilgrim. “And the luggage?” asked Eight Rules. “Isn’t it there by your head?” said Pilgrim.",,"Just as he was about to bail some water, however, the immortal suddenly reappeared and fastened his hook around one of Monkey’s legs; Monkey fell flat on his muzzle. Scrambling to his feet, he made a second attempt to lower the bucket with his right hand, while fending off the hook with his left, but Wish Fulfillment struck again. This time, the bucket tumbled into the well as Monkey lost his balance. “This fellow needs to learn some manners,” Monkey muttered, clambering back up and wildly hammering his opponent with blows of his staff. Although the immortal fled again, Monkey was stuck: rope and bucket were lost, and the hook could return at any moment. I need an assistant, he thought, reversing his cloud to the village. Back at the cottage, it was business as usual: Tripitaka moaning and Pigsy babbling about their contractions. “Have you got the water?”","At about five the next morning, just before the break of day, Brother Monkey rubbed his face, opened his eyes and said, “It certainly is good ointment—I can see far, and more clearly than ever.” He turned round to look behind him, and to his astonishment there was no house, windows, or doors; all that could be seen were some ancient locust trees and tall willows. The pair of them were sleeping on cushions of green sedge. “What are you shouting for?” asked Pig as he woke up. “Open your eyes and look,” replied Monkey. The idiot raised his head, and when he saw that there was nobody there, he leapt up in a panic with the words, “Where's our horse?” “Over there, tied to a tree,” said Monkey. “What about the luggage?” “There, beside your head.”"

Let him go. Let's untie Tang Sanzang, replace him with a new pot, tie him up, and avenge the ginseng tree. That little fairy really did it, dismantling the cloth paint. The walker could hear it clearly in mid-air, and he thought: ""Master is not good, if he gets into the oil pan, he will die in one roll, burnt in two rolls, and burn at three or five rolls."" , he made a sloppy monk! I also went to save him. ""Good sage, press down the cloud head, go up to the front and say, ""Don't tear down the cloth paint, I'm going to put the oil pan. ""That Daxian exclaimed: ""You monkey!""

I want to bring you some love of oil, soup, oil and water, but I’m just in a hurry. If you open the air in the pot, I’m afraid it will contaminate your cooked oil, making it difficult to mix and eat. pot. Don't stab my master, come stab me. ""The Great Immortal heard the words, hehe sneered, walked out of the hall, and grabbed it. After all, I don't know what to say, how to get out, and I will listen to the decomposition next time.","All right! All right! Let him go. Untie Tripitaka Tang and bring out a new pan. We’ll fry him instead in order to avenge my ginseng tree.” The various little immortals accordingly went to untie the lacquer cloth, but Pilgrim, who heard this clearly in the air, thought to himself, “Master is utterly helpless! If he arrives in the pan, the first boiling bubble will kill him and the second will burn him up; by the time the oil sizzles three or four times, he’ll be a messy monk! I had better go and save him!” Dear Great Sage! He lowered the direction of his cloud and went back to the main hall. With his hands at his waist, he said, “Don’t untie the lacquer wrapping to fry my master. Let me go into the pan of boiling oil instead.” “You wretched ape!” cried a somewhat startled Great Immortal. “How dare you display such tricks to wreck my stove?”5 “If you have the misfortune of meeting me,” said Pilgrim, laughing, “your stove deserves to be overturned! Why blame me? Just now, I was about to receive your kind hospitality in the form of oily soup, but I suddenly had the urge to relieve myself. If I opened up right in the pan, I was afraid that I might spoil your hot oil so that it could not be used for cooking. Now that I’m completely relieved, I feel quite good about going into the pan. Don’t fry my master; fry me instead. ” When the Great Immortal heard these words, he laughed menacingly and ran out of the hall to catch hold of Pilgrim. We do not know what sort of things he has to say to him, or whether Pilgrim manages to escape again. Let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.",,"How come I’m a rotten service attendant?” “Because you’re still lazy and talk back, and retain an enormous appetite. Think about it. You’ll get to clean up the offerings whenever there are Buddhist services, anywhere in the world. “Sandy, you were the great General of Curtain-Drawing. Because you smashed a crystal cup during the Great Grand Festival of Immortal Peaches, you were banished to the River of Flowing Sand, where you compounded your sin by eating humans. Fortunately, you embraced our teachings and helped Tripitaka by leading the horse on the pilgrimage. I therefore appoint you Golden-Bodied Arhat.” The Buddha turned finally to the horse. “You were once the dragon prince of the Western Ocean until your father had you condemned to death for disobedience. But because you embraced our teachings and carried Tripitaka on his journey to the west, and then the scriptures back to the east, I hereby promote you to Heavenly Dragon of the Order of Eight Supernatural Beasts.” Once the pilgrims had kowtowed their thanks to the Buddha, the horse was pushed into the Dragon-Transforming Pool behind Soul Mountain, where it instantly shed its coat and grew horns, golden scales, and silver whiskers. Swathed in auspicious air and clouds, it soared out of the pool and roosted on one of the Pillars Supporting Heaven. Monkey turned to Tripitaka. “Seeing as I’m a Buddha now, can’t I smash that hoop stuck on my head? I don’t want that so-called Bodhisattva to use it to play tricks on me or anyone else.” Tritpitaka smiled. “We needed the hoop only because there was no other way of bringing you to heel. Now that you’ve become a Buddha, it’s disappeared of its own accord. Feel for yourself.” Touching his head, Monkey discovered that the hoop had indeed vanished. The newly promoted pilgrims joined with all the other divinities of Soul Mountain in chanting their praise of every Buddha and Bodhisattva, including the Buddha Victorious in Struggle and all the way down to the Altar Service Attendant, the Golden-Bodied Arhat, and the Heavenly Dragon of the Order of Eight Supernatural Beasts. “We dedicate ourselves,” the heavenly chorus finished, “to the pure land of the Buddha, to repay compassion from above, and to save those below. Those who see and hear will be reborn and enlightened in the land of ultimate bliss.”","Forget about him, let him go. Untie Tang Sanzang instead and fetch another pot. We can fry him to avenge the destruction of the tree.” The junior Immortals set to and began to tear off Sanzang's lacquered bandages. Monkey could hear all this clearly from mid-air. “The master will be done for,” he thought. “If he goes into that cauldron it'll kill him. Then he'll be cooked, and after four or five fryings he'll be eaten as a really tender piece of monk. I must go back down and save him.” The splendid Great Sage brought his cloud down to land, clasped his hands in front of him, and said, “Don't spoil the lacquered bands, and don't fry my master. Put me in the cauldron of oil instead.” “I'll get you, you baboon,” raged the Great Immortal in astonishment. “Why did you use one of your tricks to smash my cooking pot?” “You must expect to be smashed up if you meet me—and what business is it of mine anyhow? I was going to accept your kind offer of some hot oil, but I was desperate for a shit and a piss, and if I'd done them in your cauldron, I'd have spoilt your oil and your food wouldn't have tasted right. Now I've done my stuff I'm ready for the cauldron. Please fry me instead of my master.” The Great Immortal laughed coldly, came out of the hall, and seized him. If you don't know how the story goes or how he escaped, listen to the explanation in the next installment."
行者的胆量原大，那容分说，走上前来，叉手当胸，对那六个人施礼道：“列位有甚么缘故，阻我贫僧的去路？”那人道：,"The pilgrim had great courage, said Rongfen, stepped forward, crossed his hands on his chest, and saluted the six people: ""What is the reason for you to prevent me from going as a poor monk?"" The man said:","As he always had been audacious, Pilgrim did not wait for further discussion. He walked forward with arms folded and saluted the six men, saying, “Sirs, for what reason are you blocking the path of this poor monk?” “We are kings of the highway,” said the men, “philanthropic mountain lords.","On turning round he saw Sun following. The Guardian King quickly asked, “What kind of edict do you bring?”",Have another go—this is fun.” “But I thought you lived on Flower-Fruit Mountain when you weren’t making life hell in Heaven. What are you doing all the way out here?” “Monkey has mended his ways and converted from Taoism to Buddhism.,"The brave Brother Monkey did not stop to argue. Instead he stepped forward, folded his arms across his chest, bowed to the six bandits and said, “Why are you gentlemen obstructing our way?”"
不说他师徒在路暂住。且说那大仙，天明起来，吃了早斋，出在殿上，教拿鞭来：“今日却该打唐三藏了。”那小仙轮着鞭，望唐僧道：“打你哩。”那柳树也应道：“打么。”乒乓打了三十。,"Not to mention that his master and apprentice are temporarily living on the road. Let’s talk about that big immortal, who got up at dawn, ate his morning fast, and went out of the hall to teach him to bring the whip: “Today, it’s time to hit Tang Sanzang.” The little immortal took the whip and asked Tang monk, “I’ll hit you.” That willow tree He also replied, ""Why?"" Ping-pong played thirty.","Let’s find a temporary shelter beneath the mountain slope and rest awhile before we move on again.” We shall not tell you any more now about master and disciples resting by the way; we shall tell you instead of the Great Immortal, who rose at the crack of dawn and went out at once to the main hall after taking his morning meal. He said, “Bring out the whip. It’s Tripitaka’s turn today to be flogged.” The little immortal wielded the whip and said to the Tang Monk, “I’m going to beat you.” “Go ahead,” said the willow tree, and he was given thirty lashes. Changing the direction of his whip, the little immortal said to Eight Rules, “I’m going to flog you.” “Go ahead,” said the other willow tree, and the one that was changed into the form of Sha Monk gave the same reply when it was his turn.",,"“The Buddha said that the whole trip should take no more than eight days,” worried one of the attendants. “We’ve been gone more than four already, and we’re afraid that once Pigsy gets a sniff of the delights of the Tang empire, we’ll never get him back to nirvana in time.” “Rude!” Pigsy laughed. “I’m up for imminent promotion to Buddhahood. Why would I want to linger in the mortal world?","We shall leave them resting beside the path to tell how the Great Immortal got up at dawn, ate his meatless breakfast, and went to the hall. “Today Tang Sanzang is to be whipped,” he announced as he sent for the lash. The junior whirled it around and said to the Tang Priest, “I'm going to flog you.” “Flog away,” the willow tree replied. When he had given it thirty resounding lashes he whirled the whip around once more and said to Pig, “Now I'm going to flog you.”"

He rented a room with some money to live with his mother-in-law, and then entangled with his mother-in-law and said, ""I'll be back in just over a month.""","When the grandmother saw the youthful monk, she said, “You’re indeed my grandson! Why, you are just like my son Guangrui!” She felt both happy and sad. Xuanzang led his grandmother out of the kiln and went back to Liu Xiaoer’s inn, where he rented a room for her to stay. He also gave her some money, saying, “In a little more than a month’s time, I’ll be back.”","They fell on Sun and beat him badly. But as his head seemed to be made of iron, the beating had no effect on him. Then he took out his magic needle from his ear, made it into his steel spear, went for them, and killed them all.

Then he said forward: ""Bodhisattva, I have eaten countless people here. I have always eaten people who have come to take sutras several times. The heads of people who eat them are thrown into quicksand and sink. At the bottom of the water (even goose feathers can't float in this water), there are only nine skeletons of people who read the scriptures. They float on the water and can't sink again. I thought it was a foreign object. I'm afraid that people who take the scriptures won't get this, but it's not a mistake in my future?"" Bodhisattva said: ""Is there no reason? You can hang the skull under your head and wait for the scriptures to enter, it will be useful."" The monster said. ""Since this is the case, I would like to receive teachings."" The Bodhisattva received the precepts with him, referring to Sha as his surname, so he took the surname Sha, and gave it a Dharma name, called Sha Wujing. At that time, he entered the ascetic and sent the Bodhisattva across the river, and he washed his mind and worries. Don't hurt your life again, just wait for the person who learns the scriptures.","“I’m willing,” said the monster, “to seek refuge in right action.” He said also, “Bodhisattva, I have devoured countless human beings at this place. There have even been a number of scripture pilgrims here, and I ate all of them. The heads of those I devoured I threw into the Flowing Sand, and they sank to the bottom, for such is the nature of this water that not even goose down can float on it. But the skulls of the nine pilgrims floated on the water and would not sink. Regarding them as something unusual, I chained them together with a rope and played with them at my leisure. If this becomes known, I fear that no other scripture pilgrim will want to come this way. Won’t it jeopardize my future?” “Not come this way? How absurd!” said the Bodhisattva. “You may take the skulls and hang them round your neck. When the scripture pilgrim arrives, there will be a use for them.” “If that’s the case,” said the monster, “I’m now willing to receive your instructions.” The Bodhisattva then touched the top of his head and gave him the commandments.26 The sand was taken to be a sign, and he was given the surname “Sha” and the religious name “Wujing,”27 and that was how he entered the Gate of Sand.28 After he had seen the Bodhisattva on her way, he washed his heart and purified himself; he never took life again but waited attentively for the arrival of the scripture pilgrim.","After having gone a long distance, he saw neither men nor horses about him, only a great wilderness. In his astonishment he was at a loss to find his way, but at a distance, he heard a man calling to him, “Emperor of the Great Tang Dynasty, come this way!” On hearing this, Taizong lifted his head and saw a man in a netted coat with a leather belt, and a black silk hat, holding in his hand an ivory tablet, such as officials carry to court on which to take notes. He knelt on the roadside and said, “I pray your Majesty to forgive me for being late in coming to meet you.’” Taizong said, “Who are you?” The other answered, “Your humble officer when living on earth had a father who was the magistrate of Cizhou, and in time became the Vice President of the Board of Ceremonies. His surname was Cui and his given name Ru. He is now the Chief Judge in Hell. He saw the affair of the ghost of the Dragon King and knew that your Majesty would arrive here today, and has come specially to meet you.”","“It sounds good in principle,” mused the fiend. “But I see a potential problem. I’ve eaten more people than I can remember, including the odd pilgrim traveling west for scriptures. Because everything sinks to the bottom of Flowing Sand, I throw all my victims’ heads into the river. But the skulls of the nine pilgrims floated back to the surface, so I threaded them onto a rope to fiddle with when I was at a loose end. I’m afraid that due to the river’s bad reputation, pilgrims won’t come this way anymore—and there go my prospects.” “Nonsense. Wear the skulls as a necklace. When the true scripture pilgrim comes, there’s sure to be a use for them.” “In that case, count me in.” The Bodhisattva touched his head and gave him holy orders. Taking inspiration from the river, she gave him the surname Sha (sand) and the religious name Wujing, “awakened to purity”—Sandy, for short. He then saw Guanyin over the river, swore off eating humans, and waited for the scripture pilgrim to arrive.","“I am willing to return to the truth,” the ogre replied, then went closer as he continued, “Bodhisattva, I have lost count of the number of people I have eaten here, and I have even devoured some pilgrims who were trying to fetch scriptures. I throw the heads of all my victims into the river, and they all sink to the bottom as not even goose-down will float on this water. But the skeletons of those nine pilgrims floated and would not sink. I was so impressed by this that I threaded them together with rope and play with them in my spare time. But I am afraid that the man who is to fetch the scriptures may not get this far, which would wreck my future.” “Of course he'll get here,” the Bodhisattva replied. “You should hang those skeletons from your head and wait for him. They will come in useful.” “In that case,” the ogre said, “I shall await your instructions.” The Bodhisattva then laid her hands on his head and administered the monastic rules to him, chose for him the surname Sha (“Sand"") and gave him the Buddhist name of Wujing (“Awakened to Purity""). Then he entered monkish life and took the Bodhisattva across the river. He washed his heart, cleansed his thoughts, and stopped killing living creatures. All he did now was to wait for the pilgrim who would come to fetch the scriptures."

却说行者攻门不开，也只得回观音院。那本寺僧人已葬埋了那老和尚，都在方丈里伏侍唐僧。早斋已毕，又摆上午斋，正那里添汤换水，只见行者从空降下，众僧礼拜，接入方丈，见了三藏。三藏道：“悟空你来了，袈裟如何？”行者道：“已有了根由。早是不曾冤了这些和尚，原来是那黑风山妖怪偷了。老孙去暗暗的寻他，只见他与一个白衣秀士，一个老道人，坐在那芳草坡前讲话。也是个不打自招的怪物，他忽然说出道：后日是他母难之日，邀请诸邪来做生日，夜来得了一件锦襕佛衣，要以此为寿，作一大宴，唤做庆赏佛衣会。是老孙抢到面前，打了一棍，那黑汉化风而走。道人也不见了，只把个白衣秀士打死，乃是一条白花蛇成精。我又急急赶到他洞口，叫他出来与他赌斗。他已承认了，是他拿回。战彀这半日，不分胜负。那怪回洞，却要吃饭，关了石门，惧战不出。老孙却来回看师父，先报此信，已是有了袈裟的下落，不怕他不还我。”众僧闻言，合掌的合掌，磕头的磕头，都念声“南无阿弥陀佛！今日寻着下落，我等方有了性命矣！”行者道：“你且休喜欢畅快，我还未曾到手，师父还未曾出门哩。只等有了袈裟，打发得我师父好好的出门，才是你们的安乐处；若稍有些须不虞，老孙可是好惹的主子！可曾有好茶饭与我师父吃？可曾有好草料喂马？”众僧俱满口答应道：“有！有！有！更不曾一毫有怠慢了老爷。”,"But he said that the walker could not open the door, so he had to go back to the Guanyin Academy. The monks of the temple have buried the old monk, and they are all serving the Tang monk in the abbot. After the morning fast was over, the morning fast was set again, and the soup was being added and the water was changed, when the pilgrims descended from the sky, the monks bowed, and they joined the abbot and saw the three Tibetans. Sanzang said: ""Wu Kong, you are here, how about the robe?"" The walker said: ""There is a root cause. I have never wronged these monks long ago. It turned out that the Heifengshan monster stole it. The old sun went to find him secretly, only to see He was sitting in front of the Fangcao Slope and talking with a scholar in white, an old Taoist. He was also a monster who did not attack himself, and he suddenly said: The day after tomorrow is the day of his mother's disaster. When I got a golden Buddhist robe, I wanted to use it as my longevity and have a big feast, called a festival to celebrate the Buddhist robe. It was Lao Sun who grabbed it and hit him with a stick, and the black Han turned away. The Taoist also disappeared. , I only killed a white-clothed scholar, but a white-flowered snake turned into a monster. I hurried to the entrance of his cave and asked him to come out and fight with him. He has admitted it, and he took it back. The winner will be divided. The blame goes back to the cave, but he has to eat, and the stone gate is closed, so he can't fight. The old grandson looked back and forth at the master, and reported this letter first, because the whereabouts of the cassock is already there, and I'm not afraid that he won't return it to me."" When the monk heard the words, those who folded their palms, and those who kowtowed, all recited, ""Namo Amitabha! I will find my whereabouts today, and I will have my life!"" The practitioner said: ""You don't like to be happy, I haven't gotten it yet, Master. You haven't gone out yet. Only when you have the cassocks and send my master to go out well will be your comfort zone; Have you ever had good fodder to feed the horses?"" All the monks replied, ""Yes! Yes! Yes! I have never neglected my master in the slightest.""","We must tell you that Pilgrim had no success in breaking down the door and so had to return to the Guanyin Hall. The clerics of that monastery had already buried the old monk, and they were all gathered in the back room to minister to the Tang Monk, serving him lunch soon after he had finished breakfast. As they were scurrying about fetching soup and hauling water, Pilgrim was seen descending from the sky. The monks bowed courteously and received him into the back room to see Tripitaka. “Wukong,” said Tripitaka, “ so you’ve returned. How is the cassock?” “At least I found the real culprit,” said Pilgrim. “It was a good thing that we did not punish these monks, for the monster of Black Wind Mountain did steal it. I went secretly looking for him, and saw him seated on a beautiful grass meadow having a conversation with a white-robed scholar and an old Daoist. He was, in a sense, making a confession without being tortured, saying something about the day after tomorrow being his birthday, when he would invite all the other griffins for the occasion. He also mentioned that he had found an embroidered Buddha robe last night, in celebration of which he was planning to throw a large banquet, calling it the Festival of the Buddha Robe. Old Monkey rushed up to them and struck out with his rod; the swarthy fellow changed into the wind and left, and the Daoist also disappeared. The white-robed scholar, however, was killed, and he turned out to be a white-spotted snake who had become a spirit. I quickly chased the swarthy fellow to his cave and demanded that he come out to fight. He had already admitted that he took the cassock, but we fought to a draw after half a day of battle. The monster returned to his cave because he wanted to eat; he closed his stone doors tightly and refused to fight anymore. I came back to see how you were and to make this report to you. Since I know the whereabouts of the cassock, I’m not worried about his unwillingness to give it back to me.” When the various monks heard this, some of them folded their hands while others kowtowed, all chanting, “Namo Amitābha! Now that the whereabouts of the cassock is known, we have a claim to our lives again.” “Don’t celebrate yet,” said Pilgrim, “for I have not yet recovered it, nor has my master left. Wait until we have the cassock so that my master can walk peacefully out of this door before you start cheering. If there’s the slightest mishap, old Monkey is no customer to be provoked, is he? Have you served some good things to my master? Have you given our horse plenty of hay?” “We have, we have, we have!” cried the monks hastily. “Our service to the holy monk has not slackened in the least!”",,"“Relax!” said Monkey. “I’ll find out more.” Up Monkey went. “These monsters, then: are they professionals or amateurs?” The woodcutter laughed mirthlessly. “Deep in this mountain lies the Lotus-Flower Cave, home to two monsters determined to have you for dinner.” “What luck!” responded Monkey cheerfully. “Do you know how they plan to eat us?” “I beg your pardon?” asked the nonplussed woodcutter. “I see you are inexperienced in such matters. If they start with the head, I’ll be dead in one bite—all good. After that, they can fry, sauté, braise, or boil me—it wouldn’t matter one bit. But if they start with my feet, well, I might still be alive even when they get to my pelvis. And that would be—literally—a pain.” “You’re overthinking this. The monsters will catch you, pop you in a steamer, then eat you whole.” “Better still! Just a touch of stuffiness, then it’ll all be over.” “Beware, flippant monkey! Beware! These monsters have five treasures of incomparable magic power. Beware!” The imperturbable Monkey now strolled back to the others. “Nothing to worry about,” he reported to Tripitaka. “The odd demon or two, that’s all. The locals seem a little high-strung, but with me to protect you, you’ve nothing to worry about. Onward!” “Why did that woodcutter disappear so suddenly?”","Monkey charged the gates but was unable to force them open, so he had to go back to the Guanyin Monastery, where the monks had buried the old patriarch and were now all in attendance on the Tang Priest in the abbot's quarters. Breakfast was over, and lunch was being brought in. Just as they were bringing soup and more hot water, Monkey descended from the sky. The monks all bowed low and took him into the abbot's room to see Sanzang. “Ah, you're back, Wukong,” he said. “What about the cassock?” “I've found the answer. We misjudged these monks. It was in fact stolen by a fiend from the Black Wind Mountain. I went to have a quiet look for him and found him sitting in front of grassy slope talking to a white-gowned scholar and an old Taoist. He's a self-confessed monster, and he said with his own mouth that he was inviting all the evil spirits to come and celebrate his birthday tomorrow, and that as he had come by a brocade Buddha's robe last night he wanted to celebrate that too, so he was going to give a great feast that he called an 'Assembly for the Celebration and Admiration of the Buddha's Robe'. I rushed him and took a swipe at him with my club, but the dark fellow turned into a puff of wind and fled. The Taoist disappeared too, and I was only able to kill the white-clad scholar, who was a white snake turned spirit. I went to the mouth of his cave as fast as I could and told him to come out and fight me. He admitted that he had carried it off. We fought for half a day without either of us winning, and then the monster went back to his cave for lunch and shut the stone gates behind him. He was too scared to come out again, so I came back to give you this news, master. Now we know where the cassock is, there's no need to worry that he won't give it back.” On hearing this, the monks put their hands together or kowtowed as they invoked Amitabha Buddha and exclaimed, “He's found where it is—we're saved.” “Don't be so happy about it,” Monkey warned, “I haven't got it yet, and my master hasn't left your monastery yet. You'll have to wait till I've recovered the cassock and my master has been seen off properly from here before you can consider yourselves safe. And if there is the slightest mistake, remember that I'm a very quick-tempered boss. Have you given my master the best food and tea? Have you given my horse the best fodder?” “Yes, yes, yes,” the monks hastened to assure him. “We haven't been remiss in any way while looking after his Reverence.”"
忽一日，祖师与众门人在三星洞前戏玩晚景。祖师道：“悟空，事成了未曾？”悟空道：“多蒙师父海恩，弟子功果完备，已能霞举飞升也。”祖师道：“你试飞举我看。”悟空弄本事，将身一耸，打了个连扯跟头，跳离地有五六丈，踏云霞去勾有顿饭功夫，返复不上三里远近，落在面前，叉手道：“师父，这就是飞举腾云了。”祖师笑道：“这个算不得腾云，只算得爬云而已。自古道：‘神仙朝游北海暮苍梧。’似你这半日，去不上三里，即爬云也还算不得哩！”悟空道：“怎么为‘朝游北海暮苍梧’？”祖师道：“凡腾云之辈，早辰起自北海，游过东海、西海、南海、复转苍梧，苍梧者却是北海零陵之语话也。将四海之外，一日都游遍，方算得腾云。”悟空道：“这个却难！却难！”祖师道：“世上无难事，只怕有心人。”悟空闻得此言，叩头礼拜，启道：“师父，‘为人须为彻’，索性舍个大慈悲，将此腾云之法，一发传与我罢，决不敢忘恩。”祖师道：“凡诸仙腾云，皆跌足而起，你却不是这般。我才见你去，连扯方才跳上。我今只就你这个势，传你个‘筋斗云’罢。”悟空又礼拜恳求，祖师却又传个口诀道：“这朵云，捻着诀，念动真言，攒紧了拳，对身一抖，跳将起来，一筋斗就有十万八千里路哩！”大众听说，一个个嘻嘻笑道：“悟空造化！若会这个法儿，与人家当铺兵，送文书，递报单，不管那里都寻了饭吃！”师徒们天昏各归洞府。这一夜，悟空即运神炼法，会了筋斗云。逐日家无拘无束，自在逍遥此一长生之美。,"Suddenly one day, the patriarch and his disciples played a night scene in the foreplay of Sanxingdong. The Patriarch said: ""Wukong, has it ever happened?"" Wukong said: ""Master Duomeng Haien, the disciple has completed his achievements and has been able to ascend to the sky."" The Patriarch said: ""You try flying and let me see."" He shrugged, made some somersaults, jumped five or six feet off the ground, and stepped on Yunxia to hook a meal, but he couldn't return three miles away, so he landed in front of him, crossed his hands, and said, ""Master, this is flying. Lifting the clouds."" The Patriarch smiled and said, ""This can't be regarded as flying clouds, it's just about climbing clouds. Since ancient times, there is a saying: 'The gods traveled to the North Sea and Mu Cangwu.' It’s not a big deal!” Wukong said, “Why is it 'Walking towards the North Sea and Cangwu’?” The Patriarch said, “Everyone who is born in the sky starts from the North Sea in the morning, swims through the East China Sea, the West China Sea, the South China Sea, and then turns to Cangwu. , Cangwu is the language of Lingling in Beihai. You can travel all over the four seas in one day, and you will be able to fly."" Wukong said: ""This is difficult! But difficult!"" The ancestor said: ""There is nothing difficult in the world Hearing this, Wukong kowtowed and said: ""Master, 'one must be thorough', simply give up great compassion and pass on this method of soaring clouds to me, never Dare to be ungrateful."" The patriarch said: ""All immortals and clouds all fall and rise, but you are not like this. I only saw you go, and I just jumped up. I only use your posture today, and pass you a somersault. Cloud, let's go."" Wukong prayed again and begged, but the patriarch passed on a formula: ""This cloud, twist the formula, recite the mantra, clench the fist, shake the body, jump up, and there will be ten a somersault. It’s a thousand miles away!” When the crowd heard it, they all giggled and said, “Wukong is good fortune! If you know this method, you can become a soldier with others, send documents, and submit reports, no matter where you are, you will find food to eat!” The disciples returned to their caves at dusk. That night, Wukong practiced the magic of luck and learned somersaults. Daily home is unfettered and free, this is the beauty of longevity.","One day when the Patriarch and the various pupils were admiring the evening view in front of the Three Stars Cave, the master asked, “Wukong, has that matter been perfected?” Wukong said, “Thanks to the profound kindness of the master, your pupil has indeed attained perfection; I now can ascend like mist into the air and fly.” The Patriarch said, “Let me see you try to fly.” Wishing to display his ability, Wukong leaped fifty or sixty feet into the air, pulling himself up with a somersault. He trod on the clouds for about the time of a meal and traveled a distance of no more than three miles before dropping down again to stand before the Patriarch. “Master,” he said, his hands folded in front of him, “this is flying by cloud-soaring.” Laughing, the Patriarch said, “This can’t be called cloud-soaring! It’s more like cloud-crawling! The old saying goes, ‘The immortal tours the North Sea in the morning and reaches Cangwu by night.’ If it takes you half a day to go less than three miles, it can’t even be considered cloud-crawling.” “What do you mean,” asked Wukong, “by saying, ‘The immortal tours the North Sea in the morning and reaches Cangwu by night’?” The Patriarch said, “Those who are capable of cloud-soaring may start from the North Sea in the morning, journey through the East Sea, the West Sea, the South Sea, and return again to Cangwu. Cangwu refers to Lingling in the North Sea. It can be called true cloud-soaring only when you can traverse all four seas in one day.” “That’s truly difficult!” said Wukong, “truly difficult!” “Nothing in the world is difficult,” said the Patriarch; “only the mind makes it so.” When Wukong heard these words, he kowtowed reverently and implored the Patriarch, “Master, if you do perform a service for someone, you must do it thoroughly. May you be most merciful and impart to me also this technique of cloud-soaring. I would never dare forget your gracious favor.” The Patriarch said, “When the various immortals want to soar on the clouds, they all rise by stamping their feet. But you’re not like them. When I saw you leave just now, you had to pull yourself up by jumping. What I’ll do now is to teach you the cloud-somersault in accordance with your form.” Wukong again prostrated himself and pleaded with him, and the Patriarch gave him an oral formula, saying, “Make the magic sign, recite the spell, clench your fist tightly, shake your body, and when you jump up, one somersault will carry you one hundred and eight thousand miles.” When the other people heard this, they all giggled and said, “Lucky Wukong! If he learns this little trick, he can become a dispatcher for someone to deliver documents or carry circulars. He’ll be able to make a living anywhere!” The sky now began to darken, and the master went back to the cave dwelling with his pupils. Throughout the night, however, Wukong practiced ardently and mastered the technique of cloud-somersault. From then on, he had complete freedom, blissfully enjoying his state of long life.","The Monkey King felt influences going through every pore of his body, and began to practice the arts and to learn the whole 72 wonders. Afterwards when they were outside the door of the Three Star Cave, the Master said, “Seeker of Secrets, have you learnt all the arts?” He replied, “Thanks to your great kindness I have, and I can fly among the clouds.” The Master said, “Let me see what you can do.” At this, the Seeker of Secrets bent himself and jumped some 50 or 60 feet in the air and walked on the clouds for about the time it takes one to have a meal, walked for a mile and then descended amongst them. The Master said, “That is not much. It is only creeping on the clouds. The ancient Immortals are said to have mounted in the morning as far as the Northern Ocean, gone round the East, South, and West Ocean, and been back at night.” The Seeker of Secrets said, “This is not easy.” The Master said, “Easy enough if you have a mind to do it.” At this the Seeker of Secrets threw himself on his knees and, declaring he was in earnest, begged his master to be so kind as to show him how to do it again. The Master said, “You jumped when rising, you should only bow and rise. But if you wish I can teach you how to do it by somersaults.” The Seeker of Secrets knelt before him again and begged him to do so. The Master then taught him the incantation. Then with a clenched fist and a spring, the Monkey King was off 107,000 li.","One day, as the community was enjoying the scenery at dusk in front of the Cave of the Tilted Moon and Three Stars, Subodhi suddenly turned to Monkey. “How are you getting on?” “Thanks to you, I am now fully perfected. I can float and fly, as light as mist.” “Let’s see you do it.” Anxious to show off, Monkey somersaulted some sixty feet into the air. In the time it would take to eat a meal, he had covered three miles. He returned and stood before Subodhi. “I call this cloud-galloping.” Subodhi snorted. “Cloud-crawling, more like. Any self-respecting immortal can fit in a tour of the four oceans between breakfast and dinner. That’s cloud-galloping. In fact, given that it took you most of the day to travel just three miles, cloud-crawling is an overstatement.” “What you describe is fiendishly hard!” “Nothing in this world is hard. It is only the mind that makes it so.” “If you’re going to help me, then do it properly. Please teach me how to cloud-gallop.” “Immortals begin a cloud-gallop by stamping their feet,” Subodhi explained. “But when you took off just now, you jumped. So I’ll give you a lift-off that suits you: the cloud-somersault.” Subodhi taught him a magic sign and spell. “Now clench your fists, shake your body, and jump. A single somersault will carry you 108,000 miles.” “Lucky Monkey!” The crowd of disciples giggled. “If you master this, you can get a job as an express courier. You’ll always be able to make a living.” As dusk was now turning to darkness, master and disciples went back inside the cave. But Monkey stayed up all night until he had mastered the cloud-somersault. Day in, day out, he reveled in the freedom of his new immortality.","One day the Patriarch and all his disciples were enjoying the sunset outside the Three Stars Cave. The Patriarch asked Sun Wukong, “Have you succeeded yet?” Sun Wukong replied, “Thanks to your infinite mercy, master, your disciple's results have been perfect, and I can now rise on the clouds and fly.” “Let me see you try a flight,” the Patriarch said. Sun Wukong used his skill to perform a series of somersaults that carried him fifty or sixty feet into the air, then walked around on the clouds for about as long as it takes to eat a meal. He covered about a mile altogether before landing in front of the Patriarch, folding his arms across his chest, and saying, “Master, that's flying and soaring in the clouds.” The Patriarch laughed. “That's not soaring on the clouds—it's just climbing up them. There is an old saying that 'an Immortal visits the Northern Sea in the morning and Cangwu in the evening'. But to take as long as you did just to go a mile doesn't count as climbing on the clouds.” “How can it be possible to visit the Northern Sea in the morning and Cangwu in the evening?” Sun Wukong asked. “All cloud-soarers start off from the Northern Sea early in the morning, visit the Eastern, Western and Southern Seas, and then come back to Cangwu; Cangwu is what the Northern Sea is called in the Lingling language. When you can go beyond all four seas in a single day you can regard yourself as a cloud-soarer.” “But that must be very difficult,” Sun Wukong observed. “Where there's a will there's a way,” the Patriarch replied. “Nothing by halves, master,” replied Sun Wukong with bows and kowtows, “I beg of you in your great mercy to teach me the art of cloud-soaring. I promise that I will always be grateful.” “Immortals take off with a stamp of their feet,” said the Patriarch, “but you do it differently— just now I saw you pull yourself up. As that is the way you do it, I'll show you how to do it your own way and teach you the 'somersault cloud.' “ Sun Wukong bowed again, imploring him to do so, and the Patriarch taught him the spell. “For this kind of cloud,” the Patriarch said, “you make the magic by clasping your hands in the special way, recite the words of the spell, clench your fist, shake yourself, and jump. With one somersault you can go sixty thousand miles.” When the others heard this they all exclaimed with a laugh. “Lucky old Sun Wukong. With magic like this he could be-a messenger delivering official letters and reports, and he'd never go short of a meal.” When it was dark the Patriarch and his pupils returned to the cave. That night Sun Wukong moved his spirit, practiced the technique, and mastered the cloud somersault. From then on he was free from all restraint and he enjoyed the delights of immortality, drifting around as he pleased."
当时龙子龙孙即捧香茶来献。,"At that time, the son of the dragon and the grandson of the dragon came to present it with fragrant tea.","At that moment, the Dragon sons and grandsons presented them with aromatic tea.","The little demons withdrew into the cave once more, and brought out a real man’s head, dripping with blood.","“Couldn’t you have waited until I lured him onto higher ground, then blocked his route back to the river?","“Delighted to oblige,” said the dragon king, and his dragon sons and grandsons came in with some fragrant tea which they presented to Monkey."
“莫哭！莫哭！你不知那姓孙的，也是个太乙散仙，也曾大闹天宫，神通广大。既然打倒了宝树，你可认得那些和尚？”清风道：,"""Don't cry! Don't cry! You don't know that the surnamed Sun is also a Taiyi Loose Immortal. He has also made a lot of trouble in the Heavenly Palace, and has great supernatural powers. Now that you have defeated the treasure tree, do you recognize those monks?"" Qingfeng said:","Instead, he said, “Don’t cry! Don’t cry! What you don’t know is that the fellow with the name of Sun is also a minor immortal of the Great Monad; he has great magic power and has caused much disturbance in Heaven. If our treasure tree is struck down, all I want to know is whether you will be able to recognize these monks if you see them again.” “Certainly,” said Clear Breeze.",,"“Hilarious!” guffawed the Buddha’s honored attendants. “If we gave out the scriptures for free, our descendants would starve to death.” Their finagling enraged Monkey. “I’m going to tell on you to the Buddha. He’ll get you to cough up.”","The Great Immortal did not lose his temper when he heard their story, “Don't cry,” he said, “don't cry. What you don't realize is that Monkey is an Immortal of the Supreme Monad, and that he played tremendous havoc in the Heavenly Palace. He has vast magic powers. But he has knocked our tree over. Could you recognize those monks?”"
正在欢饮之间，猴王忽停杯问曰：“我这‘弼马温’是个甚么官衔？”众曰：“官名就是此了。”又问：“此官是个几品？”众道：“没有品从。”猴王道：“没品，想是大之极也。”众道：“不大，不大，只唤做‘未入流’。”猴王道：“怎么叫做‘未入流’？”众道：“末等。这样官儿，最低最小，只可与他看马。似堂尊到任之后，这等殷勤，喂得马肥，只落得道声‘好’字，如稍有些尪羸，还要见责；再十分伤损，还要罚赎问罪。”猴王闻此，不觉心头火起，咬牙大怒道：“这般藐视老孙！老孙在花果山，称王称祖，怎么哄我来替他养马？养马者，乃后生小辈，下贱之役，岂是待我的？不做他！不做他！我将去也！”忽喇的一声，把公案推倒，耳中取出宝贝，幌一幌，碗来粗细，一路解数，直打出御马监，径至南天门。众天丁知他受了仙录，乃是个弼马温，不敢阻当，让他打出天门去了。,"While drinking, the Monkey King suddenly stopped his cup and asked, ""What is the official title of my 'Bi Ma Wen'?"" Said: ""There is no quality to follow."" The monkey king said: ""No quality, I think it is the ultimate."" The crowd said: ""It's not big, it's not big, it's just called 'not entering the stream'."" The monkey king said: ""How can it be called 'not entering the stream' Entering the stream'?"" The crowd said, ""Wait at the end. This kind of official, the lowest and the smallest, can only watch horses with him. After Shitangzun took office, he was so diligent, fed the horses fat, and only ended up with the word 'good'. If you are a little bit sloppy, you will be punished; if you are injured too much, you will be punished for atonement."" Hearing this, the Monkey King felt a fire in his heart, gritted his teeth and said angrily: ""You despise the old grandson like this! The old grandson is in Huaguo Mountain. How can I coax me to raise horses for him? The horse breeders are the descendants of the younger generation, and they are inferior, so how can they treat me? Don't be him! Don't be him! I will go!"" Hu La said With a sound, the koan was pushed down, and the treasure was taken out of his ears, and the bowl was as thick and thin as possible. All Tian Ding knew that he had received the immortal record, but he was a bit of a horse, so he didn't dare to stop him and let him go out of the gate of heaven.","While they were drinking happily, the Monkey King suddenly put down his cup and asked: “What sort of rank is this BanHorsePlague of mine?” “The rank and the title are the same,” they said. “But what ministerial grade is it?” “It does not have a grade,” they said. “If it does not have a grade,” said the Monkey King, “I suppose it must be the very highest.” “Not at all,” they replied, “it can only be called ‘the unclassified’!” The Monkey King said, “What do you mean by ‘the unclassified’?” “It is really the meanest level,” they said. “This kind of minister is the lowest of the low ranks; hence he can only look after horses. Take the case of Your Honor, who, since your arrival, have been so diligent in discharging your duties. If the horses are fattened, you will only earn yourself a ‘Fairly Good!’ If they look at all thin, you will be roundly rebuked. And if they are seriously hurt or wounded, you will be prosecuted and fined.” When the Monkey King heard this, fire leaped up from his heart. “So that’s the contempt they have for old Monkey!” he cried angrily, gnashing his teeth. “At the Flower-Fruit Mountain I was honored as king and patriarch. How dare they trick me into coming to look after horses for them, if horse tending is such a menial service, reserved only for the young and lowly? Is such treatment worthy of me? I’m quitting! I’m quitting! I’m leaving right now!” With a crash, he kicked over his official desk and took the treasure out of his ear. One wave of his hand and it had the thickness of a rice bowl. Delivering blows in all directions, he fought his way out of the imperial stables and went straight to the South Heaven Gate. The various celestial guardians, knowing that he had been officially appointed a BanHorsePlague, did not dare stop him and allowed him to fight his way out of the Heaven Gate.","The Minister of Venus. In the midst of the banquet, the Monkey King asked, “By the way, what is the official rank of the Horse Master?” They answered, “He has no official rank.” The Monkey King said, “Since he has no rank, the position must be very high and unequalled.” They replied, “No, not at all, it is not great at all. It is just above not having any rank at all. It is the lowest. The ministers think you are only good enough to look after the horses. After having taken so much care of the horses as you have done, all you can expect is that they are pleased with you, but if there is anything wrong you will be censured, and if very wrong, you will be punished.” When the Monkey King heard this, he became very angry, ground his teeth and said, “This is an insult! In my Mountain Garden they call me King. How dare they invite me here merely to look after horses? Is this the way they should behave towards me? I will not stand it! I will not stand it! I am going!” In an instant he pushed over, with a great noise, the table at which public justice was administered, pulled out his precious weapon from his ear, and having got it to its proper size, rushed out through the gate of the Imperial Horse Yamen, and proceeded straight towards the South Gate. All the guard knew he had been given an official position in heaven as Horse Master, so did not dare to stop him as he passed outside.","While the others were merrily drinking away, Monkey suddenly set down his cup. “What grade am I in the civil service here?” “You don’t have one,” his colleagues replied. “You mean I’m too high up for the grade system?” Monkey asked. “Quite the opposite. You’re so low-ranking you’re off the bottom of the scale. You’ve done a famous job since starting in the stables, but you’ll never get more than a grudging ‘not bad’ from the higher-ups. If the horses lose any weight, senior management will tan your hide. And if they get injured under your watch, you’ll be severely punished.” “So that’s what they think of Monkey!” the Imperial Groom exploded. “Don’t they know I’m the King of Flower-Fruit Mountain? How have they hoodwinked me into looking after their smelly horses? I’m off!” Pushing over his desk, he took the iron out from behind his ear, shook it out to the thickness of a cudgel, and barged his way out of the South Gate. Knowing that Monkey was now on the immortal payroll, the sentries didn’t dare arrest him.","In the middle of the party the Monkey King suddenly put down his cup and asked, “What sort of office is this 'Protector of the Horses?'” “What the name suggests, that's all.” “Which official grading does it carry?” “Unclassified.” “What does 'unclassified' mean?” “Bottom grade,” the others replied, going on to explain, “It is a very low and unimportant office, and all you can do in it is look after the horses. Even someone who works as conscientiously as Your Honour and gets the horses so fat will get no more reward than someone saying 'good'; and if anything goes at all wrong you will be held responsible, and if the losses are serious you will be fined and punished.” The Monkey King flared up on hearing this, gnashed his teeth, and said in a great rage, “How dare they treat me with such contempt? On the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit I am a king and a patriarch. How dare he trick me into coming here to feed his horses for him? It's a low job for youngsters, not for me. I won't do it, I won't. I'm going back.” He pushed the table over with a crash, took his treasure out of his ear, and shook it. It became as thick as a rice bowl, and he brandished it as he charged out of the Imperial Stables to the Southern Gate of Heaven. As the celestial guards knew that his name was on the register of immortal officials they did not dare to block his path, but let him out through the gate."

This Monkey King has 84,000 feathers and feathers on his body since he became Dao, and his roots can change, according to his heart. Those little monkeys are good-eyed and can jump, they can't cut with a knife, and they can't hurt with a gun. You see him jumping back and forth, getting up, surrounding the demon king, hugging, pulling, pulling, drilling his crotch, pulling his feet, kicking his hair, picking his eyes, twisting his nose, lifting his drums, Straight to make a save plate. Then Wukong went to grab his sword, separated the little monkey, took a look at the top door, and chopped it into two pieces. He led the crowd into the cave and annihilated all the big and small goblins. But with a flick of his hair, he closed his body. Seeing that the one who couldn't hold his body was the little monkey captured by the Demon King in the Water Curtain Cave, Wukong said, ""Why are you here?"" There were about thirty or fifty, all of them tearfully said, ""I'm waiting for you. After the king went to immortality, he quarreled with him for the past two years and took us all into the future. Isn't that the house fire in our cave? The stone basin and stone bowl were all brought by this fellow."" Wukong said: ""Since it is our home Fire, you all move out."" Immediately, a fire was set in the cave, burning the water-dirty cave to dryness and becoming one. They said to the crowd, ""You wait and come back with me."" The monkeys said, ""Your Majesty, when we came, we only heard the wind in our ears, and we fluttered to this place, and we didn't know the path. How can we return to our hometown now?"" Wukong said. : ""This is a trick he made, how difficult it is! Now I know everything, I know everything, and I can do it too. You all closed your eyes, don't be afraid!""","For you see, when someone acquires the body of an immortal, he can project his spirit, change his form, and perform all kinds of wonders. Since the Monkey King had become accomplished in the Way, every one of the eighty-four thousand hairs on his body could change into whatever shape or substance he desired. The little monkeys he had just created were so keen of eye and so swift of movement that they could be wounded by neither sword nor spear. Look at them! Skipping and jumping, they rushed at the Monstrous King and surrounded him, some hugging, some pulling, some crawling in between his legs, some tugging at his feet. They kicked and punched; they yanked at his hair and poked at his eyes; they pinched his nose and tried to sweep him completely off his feet, until they tangled themselves into confusion. Meanwhile Wukong succeeded in snatching the scimitar, pushed through the throng of little monkeys, and brought the scimitar down squarely onto the monster’s skull, cleaving it in two. He and the rest of the monkeys then fought their way into the cave and slaughtered all the imps, young and old. With a shake, he collected his hair back onto his body, but there were some monkeys that did not return to him. They were the little monkeys kidnaped by the Monstrous King from the Water-Curtain Cave. “Why are you here?” asked Wukong. The thirty or fifty of them all said tearfully, “After the Great King went away to seek the way of immortality, the monster menaced us for two whole years and finally carried us off to this place. Don’t these utensils belong to our cave? These stone pots and bowls were all taken by the creature.” “If these are our belongings,” said Wukong, “move them out of here.” He then set fire to the Water-Belly Cave and reduced it to ashes. “All of you,” he said to them, “follow me home.” “Great King,” the monkeys said, “when we came here, all we felt was wind rushing past us, and we seemed to float through the air until we arrived here. We don’t know the way. How can we go back to our home?” Wukong said, “That’s a magic trick of his. But there’s no difficulty! Now I know not only one thing but a hundred! I’m familiar with that trick too. Close your eyes, all of you, and don’t be afraid.”","The Monkey King, since he had discovered this supernatural gift, had 84,000 hairs on his body, and each of these could be transformed in like manner, as he pleased. The small monkeys were so lively that the demon could not hit them on the right or left. They went at him from behind and before, they seized him and pulled him and tripped him, played with his hair and eyes, as if he were a pincushion. The Seeker of Secrets then laid hold of his sword, went up amongst the monkeys, struck the top of the Demon King’s head till it split open, and went into the cave, killing as he went, leaving not one of the demons alive. Then he put back the hair in its place on his body again. Those who did not suffer in the cave were a few dozen monkeys, which the Demon King had carried captive before. He ordered them out to light a fire to burn all the demons. Then he told these monkeys to follow him home. “Shut your eyes tight.”","When someone becomes an immortal, you see, he can transform his spirit at will. Now that Monkey was an adept in the Way, every single one of the eighty-four thousand hairs on his body could change into whatever form he wanted. His mini-monkeys were so sharp-eyed and agile that the monster couldn’t get his sword near them. Back and forth they weaved and darted until the monster was completely surrounded. Some squeezed, some tugged, some jabbed at his crotch, while others pulled at his feet, tore his hair, gouged at his eyes, tweaked his nose, and generally befuddled him. While this was going on, the real Monkey managed to grab the monster’s sword, advance through the mass of little monkeys, and slice the monster’s head in two. Monkey then led his army into the cave, where they slaughtered all the imps. The conquest complete , Monkey shook himself and the hairs returned to his body. About forty monkeys, however, retained their shape—for they had been kidnapped here from Flower-Fruit Mountain—and tearfully explained themselves to the monkey king. “These stone pots and bowls”—they gestured around the cave—“he also stole from us.” “Then we will take them with us,” pronounced Monkey, who then set fire to the cave and burned it to ashes. “Let’s head home,” he told his followers. “Close your eyes and don’t be afraid.”","Sun Wukong now had an immortal body, and there was no magic transformation of which he was not capable. Since he had followed the Way he could change each of the eighty-four thousand hairs on his body into anything he wanted. The little monkeys were too quick and nimble for sword or spear. Look at them, leaping forwards and jumping backwards, rushing up and surrounding the demon king, grabbing him, seizing him, poking him in the backside, pulling at his feet, punching him, kicking him, tearing his hair out, scratching at his eyes, twisting his nose, all picking him up together and throwing him to the ground. They went on until they had beaten him to a pulp. Sun Wukong snatched his sword from him, told the little monkeys to get out of the way, and brought it down on the crown of his head, splitting it into two. Then he led his forces charging into the cave, where they exterminated all the demons, big and small. He shook his hair and put it back on his body. The monkeys who did not go back on his body were the little monkeys the demon king had carried off from the Water Curtain Cave. Sun Wukong asked them how they had got there. There were thirty of forty of them, and they replied with tears in their eyes, “It was after Your Majesty went off to become an Immortal. He has been fighting with us for the last two years. He brought us all here by force. All the things here—the stone bowls and plates—were stolen from our cave by that beast.” “If it's our stuff, take it all out,” said Sun Wukong. He then set fire to the Cave in the Belly of the Water and burnt it to a cinder. “Come back with me,” he ordered the monkeys. “Your Majesty,” they replied, “when we came here all we could hear was the wind howling in our ears as it blew us here, so we don't know the way. How are we ever going to get back?” “There's nothing at all to that spell he used,” said Sun Wukong. “I can do it too, as now I only have to know the smallest bit about something to understand it completely. Shut your eyes and don't worry.”"

那小妖听说，疾忙跑入洞里，报道：“大王！祸事了！”魔王道：“有甚祸事？”小妖道：“洞外有猴头称为花果山水帘洞洞主。他说你屡次欺他儿孙，特来寻你，见个上下哩。”魔王笑道：“我常闻得那些猴精说他有个大王，出家修行去，想是今番来了。你们见他怎生打扮，有甚器械？”小妖道：“他也没甚么器械，光着个头，穿一领红色衣，勒一条黄绦，足下踏一对乌靴，不僧不俗，又不像道士神仙，赤手空拳，在门外叫哩。”魔王闻说：“取我批挂兵器来！”那小妖即时取出。那魔王穿了甲胄，绰刀在手，与众妖出得门来，即高声叫道：“那个是水帘洞洞主？”悟空急睁睛观看，只见那魔王：,"When the little demon heard that, he hurriedly ran into the cave and reported, ""Your Majesty! A disaster!"" The devil said, ""What's wrong?"" The little demon said, ""There is a monkey head outside the cave called Huaguoshan Water Curtain Cave. Lord. He said that you have repeatedly bullied his children and grandchildren, so he came here to look for you and see you."" The Demon King smiled and said, ""I often hear those monkey spirits say that he has a great king and is going to become a monk. I think it is this time. How did you see him dressed and what equipment did he have?"" The little demon said: ""He doesn't have any equipment either, he is naked, he wears a red shirt with a collar, a yellow sash, and a pair of black boots on his feet. It's not like Taoist priests and immortals, with bare hands, shouting outside the door."" The demon king heard and said, ""Bring me the weapons!"" The little demon immediately took it out. The Demon King was wearing armor and had a knife in his hand. When he came out with all the demons, he shouted loudly, ""That's the cave master of the Water Curtain Cave?"" Wukong opened his eyes and watched, only to see the Demon King:","Hearing this, the imps darted into the cave and cried out, “Great King, a disastrous thing has happened!” “What sort of disaster?” asked the Monstrous King. “Outside the cave,” said the imps, “there is a monkey who calls himself the lord of the Water-Curtain Cave in the Flower-Fruit Mountain. He says that you have repeatedly bullied his young ones and that he has come to settle matters with you.” Laughing, the Monstrous King said, “I have often heard those monkeys say that they have a great king who has left the family to practice self-cultivation. He must have come back. How is he dressed, and what kind of weapon does he have?” “He doesn’t have any kind of weapon,” the imps said. “He is bare-headed, wears a red robe with a yellow sash, and has a pair of black boots on. He looks like neither a monk nor a layman, neither a Daoist nor an immortal. He is out there making demands with naked hands and empty fists.” When the Monstrous King heard this, he ordered, “Get me my armor and my weapon.” These were immediately brought out by the imps, and the Monstrous King put on his breastplate and helmet, grasped his scimitar, and walked out of the cave with his followers. “Who is the lord of the Water-Curtain Cave?” he cried with a loud voice. Quickly opening wide his eyes to take a look, Wukong saw that the Monstrous King","The little demons ran in and said, “Trouble has come, oh King,” and repeated the message of the Monkey King. The Demon King laughed and said, “I have often heard the monkeys say that they had a great chief, and that he had gone away to lead a religious life. I suppose it is he who has come. How is he dressed and how is he armed?” They replied, “He is not armed, but is hatless and dressed in a red gown and yellow girdle and black boots. He is not like an ordinary man, nor like a Buddhist monk or a Taoist priest, and he is waiting outside with no weapons in his hands.” On hearing this the Demon King put on his armor, took a sword in his hand and went out, followed by a crowd of little demons, and cried out, “Where is the Master of the Water Screen Cave?” The Seeker of Secrets opened his eyes and saw the Demon King.","The imps rushed into the cave. “O great king!” they wailed. “Catastrophe!” “What are you talking about?” the Monstrous King—for it was he—asked. After the fiends reported their encounter outside the cave, their sovereign laughed: “Those monkeys are always saying they have a king who left them to study the Way. So he’s back at last, it seems. How is he dressed, and what weapons does he have?” “None that we can see. He’s bareheaded and is wearing a red robe tied with a yellow sash and black boots. He doesn’t resemble your regular Buddhist or Taoist. But he’s certainly making quite a racket out there.” “Bring me my armor and my weapon,” instructed the monster. Once dressed for combat, he exited the cave with his retinue of goblins. “So where’s this King of Water-Curtain Cave?” he bellowed. Monkey gazed upon a demon thirty feet high, with a waist as thick as ten arm-spans and brandishing a sharp, bright sword.","The minor demons scuttled into the cave and reported, “A disaster, Your Majesty.” “What do you mean, disaster?” the demon king asked. “There's a monkey outside the cave,” the minor demons reported, “who says that he's the King of the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. He says that you have been bullying his children and grandchildren, and that he's come specially to find you to have it out with you.” The demon king laughed. “Those monkey devils are always going on about a king of theirs who renounced the world to cultivate his conduct; I suppose it must be him who's here now. Did you see how he was dressed or what weapons he was carrying?” “He hasn't got any weapons. He's bareheaded, and he's wearing a red gown belted with a yellow silk sash, and a pair of black boots. He isn't dressed like a monk, or a layman, or an Immortal. He's bare-handed and empty-fisted, and he's standing outside the doors yelling.” “Bring me my armour and weapons,” said the demon king when he heard this. The minor demons produced them at once, and when he had donned his armour he went out of the door with all the demons, his sword in his hand. “Who is the King of the Water Curtain Cave?” he roared.

次早，那合家老小都起来，就整素斋，管待长老，请开启念经。这长老净了手，同太保家堂前拈了香，拜了家堂。三藏方敲响木鱼，先念了净口业的真言，又念了净身心的神咒，然后开《度亡经》一卷。诵毕，伯钦又请写荐亡疏一道，再开念《金刚经》、《观音经》，一一朗音高诵。诵毕，吃了午斋，又念《法华经》、《弥陀经》。各诵几卷，又念一卷《孔雀经》，及谈苾蒭洗业的故事，早又天晚。献过了种种香火，化了众神纸马，烧了荐亡文疏，佛事已毕，又各安寝。,"The next morning, all the elders and children of the whole family get up, and they will fasten their vegetarian meals and take care of the elders. Please start chanting. The elder cleaned his hands, took incense in front of the Taibao family hall, and worshipped the family hall. Sanzang sounded the wooden fish, first recited the mantra to purify the mouth and karma, and then recited the divine mantra to purify the body and mind, and then opened a volume of the ""Sutra of Rescue the Death"". After the recitation, Boqin asked him to write a recomendation of the dead, and then began to recite the ""Diamond Sutra"" and ""Guanyin Sutra"", and recited them one by one in high pitch. After reciting, eat lunch, and recite the Lotus Sutra and Amitabha Sutra. Each recite a few volumes, and another volume of ""Peacock Sutra"", and talk about the story of Bijiao washing industry, early and late. All kinds of incense have been offered, the gods have been turned into paper horses, and the texts of the dead have been burned. The Buddhist work has been completed, and everyone sleeps peacefully.","As soon as the members of the family, young and old, arose next morning, they went to prepare vegetarian food to serve to the priest, who was then asked to begin his recitations. Having first washed his hands, the priest went to the ancestral hall with the Guardian to burn incense. Only after he had bowed to the house shrine did Tripitaka beat on his wooden fish and recite first the true sentences for the purification of the mouth, and then the divine formula for the purification of mind and body. He went on to the Sūtra for the Salvation of the Dead, after which Boqin requested him to compose in writing a specific prayer for the deliverance of the deceased. He then took up the Diamond Sūtra and the Guanyin Sūtra, each of which was given a loud and clear recitation. After lunch, he recited several sections from the Lotus Sūtra and the Amitāyus Sūtra, before finishing with the Peacock Sūtra and a brief recounting of the story of Buddha healing a bhikṣu.8 Soon it was evening again. All kinds of incense were burned together with the various paper horses, images of the deities, and the prayer for the deliverance of the deceased. The Buddhist service was thus completed, and each person retired.","Experiments with different elements are easy, and a little addition of one or of the other produces all Nature’s combinations, according to the definite proportions of the various forces. When the positive and negative follow their respective laws, and the three forces of mind, matter, and life unite to form the Golden Pill of Immortality, then we can understand the laws which permeate all things. By trying to he wise, one becomes foolish, By playing with a vice, it becomes a bad habit. So Sun transformed himself into one of the ladies in waiting on the queen, in order to gain possession of the three bells. To get the demon to show the bells, which were concealed under his clothes, Sun caused lice, fleas, and bugs to worry him, till he was compelled to take off his garments. The Monkey then took the genuine bells himself, and substituted false ones for the demon. Sun then appeared outside the gates and called upon the demon to come out and fight him. He shook the three bells together. At once there appeared dense smoke, fierce flames, and blinding sand, such as were never seen before. The demon meantime, used his false bells, but could do nothing.","and we’re sure you’ll all get along famously.” Monkey relayed all this to Tripitaka. Hardly had the indomitable monk begun to mewl about how hungry and cold he would get waiting for Monkey to return when one of his protectors, the Golden-Headed Guardian, intervened from midair: “Don’t stir yourself. I’ll fetch her.” “Much obliged!” Monkey shouted back. “Quick as you can!” Thanks to a speedy cloud transportation system, the guardian soon reached the South Sea and asked to be shown in to Guanyin in her Purple Bamboo Grove. “Tripitaka and Monkey are in a fix: they’ve lost their horse at the Brook of Eagle’s Sorrow on Serpent’s Coil Mountain.","Early the next morning the whole family, young and old, got up and prepared vegetarian food for the monk, and then they asked him to start reciting sutras. Sanzang washed his hands, went to the family shrine of the high warden, burned incense there, and worshipped, then beat his “wooden fish” as he recited first a prayer to purify his mouth, then a holy spell to purify his body and mind, and finally the Sutra to Deliver the Dead. When he had finished, Boqin asked him to write out a letter of introduction for the dead man and also recite the Diamond Sutra and the Guanyin Sutra. Sanzang recited them in a loud, clear voice and then ate lunch, after which he read out the several chapters of the Lotus Sutra, the Amitabha Sutra, as well as one chapter of the Peacock Sutra and told the story of the cleansing of the bhikshu. By now it was dark, and when they had burned all kinds of incense, paper money, and paper horses for all the gods, and the letter of introduction for the dead man, the service was over and everyone went to bed and slept soundly."
那鬼使速取来在森罗殿下，与刘全夫妻相会。诉罢前言，回谢十王恩宥，那阎王却检生死簿子看时，他夫妻们都有登仙之寿，急差鬼使送回。鬼使启上道：“李翠莲归阴日久，尸首无存，魂将何附？”阎王道：“唐御妹李玉英，今该促死；你可借他尸首，教他还魂去也。”那鬼使领命，即将刘全夫妻二人还魂。带定出了阴司，那阴风绕绕，径到了长安大国，将刘全的魂灵，推入金亭馆里；将翠莲的灵魂，带进皇宫内院，只见那玉英宫主，正在花阴下，徐步绿苔而行，被鬼使扑个满怀，推倒在地，活捉了他魂，却将翠莲的魂灵，推入玉英身内。鬼使回转阴司不题。,"That ghost envoy, Quick, came to meet Liu Quan and his wife at His Royal Highness Sen Luo. After the preface, he thanked the ten kings for their kindness, but when the king of hell checked the book of life and death, his husband and wife had a long life of immortality, and they urgently sent ghosts to send them back. The ghost envoy Qi Shang said: ""Li Cuilian has been in the dark for a long time, and there is no corpse left, so what is the soul attached to?"" Yan Wang said: ""Tang Yumei Li Yuying, it is time to promote death now; you can borrow his corpse and teach him to revive his soul."" That ghost envoy Taking orders, Liu Quan and his wife are about to revive. He took out the Yin Si, and the yin wind swirled around and led to the great country of Chang'an, where he pushed Liu Quan's soul into the Golden Pavilion, and took the soul of Cui Lian into the inner courtyard of the palace, only to see the Yuying Palace Master, who was in Huayin. Down, walking slowly on the green moss, he was pounced on by the ghost, pushed him to the ground, captured his soul alive, but pushed Cuilian's soul into Yuying's body. It is not a problem for the ghost to turn around the yin.","When the Ten Kings heard these words, they asked at once for Li, the wife of Liu Quan; she was brought in by the demon guardian, and wife and husband had a reunion before the Hall of Darkness. They conversed about what had happened and also thanked the Ten Kings for this meeting. King Yama, moreover, examined the Books of Life and Death and found that both husband and wife were supposed to live to a ripe old age. He quickly ordered the demon guardian to take them back to life, but the guardian said, “Since Li Cuilian has been back in the World of Darkness for many days, her body no longer exists. To whom should her soul attach herself?” “The emperor’s sister, Li Yuying,” said King Yama, “is destined to die very soon. Borrow her body right away so that this woman can return to life.” The demon guardian obeyed the order and led Liu Quan and his wife out of the Region of Darkness to return to life. We do not know how the two of them returned to life; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter. TWELVE The Tang emperor, firmly sincere, convenes a Grand Mass; Guanyin, in epiphany, converts Gold Cicada. We were telling you about the demon guardian who was leading Liu Quan and his wife out of the Region of Darkness. Accompanied by a swirling dark wind, they went directly back to Chang’an of the great nation. The demon pushed the soul of Liu Quan into the Golden Court Pavilion Lodge, but the soul of Cuilian was brought into the inner court of the royal palace. Just then the Princess Yuying was walking beneath the shadows of flowers along a path covered with green moss. The demon guardian crashed right into her and pushed her to the ground; her living soul was snatched away and the soul of Cuilian was pushed into Yuying’s body instead. The demon guardian then returned to the Region of Darkness, and we shall say no more about that.","Guanyin took it up with ease, and said, “This dew water is different from dragon water and can put out the fire of passion. I will send a fairy with you on your boat. You need no sails. The fairy only needs to blow a little and the boat floats at will without any effort.” Finally, the demon child, having been caught, repented and begged to be received as a disciple. Guanyin accepted him and blessed him, giving him the name of Sadhana the Page. Guanyin Saves the Red Child. After Guanyin had said some prayers, Sadhana the Page commenced his duties by paying due respect to Guanyin. When Sha the Monk, who was still waiting at the Pine forest, saw Sun returning, he was very glad.","While the couple had a touching reunion, King Yama consulted the Ledger of Life and Death and discovered that an administrative error had been made, for both Li and Liu were supposed to live to ripe old ages, and quickly asked a clerk to restore them to life. But there was a hitch, the minion revealed: “Because Li’s been dead too long, her soul no longer has a body to go back to.” “Not a problem,” determined King Yama. “The emperor’s sister Yuying is due to die at any moment now. Cuilian can take her body.” And the administrator led Liu Quan and his wife away, to implement this technically complex reincarnation procedure. Chapter Twelve The infernal assistant swirled Liu Quan and Li Cuilian out of Hell and into the imperial palace in Chang’an, where Princess Yuying was taking a walk. Yama’s envoy knocked her to the ground, pulled out her soul, inserted Cuilian’s into the still-warm body, and swirled back to Hell and out of our story.","The devil messengers soon brought her to the Senluo Palace, outside which Liu Quan was reunited with her. They thanked the Ten Kings for their kindness and told them about the harsh words that had been spoken. On consulting the Registers of Birth and Death, the kings found that they were fated to become Immortals, so they ordered demon officers to take them back at once. The demon officers, however, asked in a report, “As Li Cuilian has been dead for some time her body has perished, so what is her soul to be attached to?” “Li Yuying, the sister of the Tang Emperor, is due to die a sudden death today,” said the Kings of Hell, “so we can borrow her body to put Li Cuilian's soul back into.” On receiving this order the demon officers took Liu Quan and his wife out of the underworld to be brought back to life. If you don't know how they returned to life, listen to the explanation in the next installment. Chapter 12 The Tang Emperor Keeps Faith and Holds a Great Mass Guanyin Appears to the Reincarnated Golden Cicada When the devil officers left the underworld with Liu Quan and his wife, a dark and whirling wind blew them straight to the great capital Chang'an, where Liu Quan's soul was sent to the Golden Pavilion and Li Cuilian's to an inner courtyard of the palace, where Princess Yuying could be seen walking slowing beside some moss under the shade of some blossoming trees. Suddenly the devil officers struck her full in the chest and knocked her over; they snatched the soul from her living body and put Li Cuilian's soul into the body in its place. With that they returned to the underworld."

Why didn't he call us when he moved? If the old pig knows it, it's better to send you some tea and fruit. I think he is hiding from the door, I'm afraid the boss knows, but he We moved overnight. Hey! We also slept to death! Why can't his house be demolished without hearing the sound?"" The walker chuckled and said, ""You idiot, don't make a fuss, look at what kind of paper there is on that tree. Son."" Bajie stepped forward and uncovered it with his hands. It turned out that the above four lines of Song Zi said: ""Zhuangju is not a layman's residence, and the protector Jialan has turned the house. The magic medicine and the king's doctor have eye pain. Xing Zhe said: ""This group of strong gods, since they have changed dragons and horses, have never ordered him, but he has come to make a fool of himself!"" Bajie said: ""Brother, don't be arrogant. , you don't know yet. This guardian Jia Lan, Liu Ding Liu Jia, Wu Fang Jie Di, and Four Values Gong Cao secretly protect my master according to the Bodhisattva's decree. Since then, I have reported my name, just because I have always had you. I didn't use them, so I didn't point it."" Bajie said: ""Brother, since he was secretly protecting the master by the decree of the law, he couldn't show himself clearly, so he pointed the fairy village. You don't blame him, and yesterday I thanked him for pointing his eyes with you. And thanks to him for taking care of our fasting meal, it can be said that he did his best. You don’t blame him, let’s go and save the master.” Walker said: “Brother is right. It’s not far from here to the entrance of the Yellow Wind Cave. Go, just watch Ma Shoudan in the woods, and wait for the old grandson to go to the cave to inquire about the whereabouts of the master, and then fight against him."" Bajie said: ""It is just like this, to ask for a life and death faith. If the master dies Now, everyone is looking for a leader; if we are not dead, we should do our best."" The walker said: ""Don't talk nonsense, I will go!""","“This family is rather shifty!” said Eight Rules. “If they have moved, why didn’t they give us a call? If they had let old Hog know about it, they might have received some farewell gifts of tea and fruits. Well, I suppose they must be trying to hide from something and are afraid that the county sheriff may get wind of it; so they moved out in the night. Good Heavens! We must have been dead to the world! How could we not have heard anything when they dismantled the whole house?” “Idiot, stop babbling!” said Pilgrim, chuckling. “Take a look on that tree and see what kind of paper slip is there.” Eight Rules took it down. It was a four-line poem that read: This humble abode’s no mortal abode: A cottage devised9 by the Guardians of Law, Who gave the wondrous balm to heal your sore. Fret not and do your best to quell the fiend. Pilgrim said, “A bunch of roguish deities! Since we changed to the dragonhorse, I had not taken a roll call of them. Now they are playing tricks on me instead!” “Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “stop putting on such airs! How would they ever let you check them off the roll?” “Brother,” said Pilgrim, “you don’t know about this. These Eighteen Protectors of Monasteries, the Six Gods of Darkness and Six Gods of Light, the Guardians of Five Points, and the Four Sentinels all have been ordered by the Bodhisattva to give secret protection to Master. The other day they reported their names to me, but since you have been with us, I have not made use of them. That’s why I haven’t made a roll call.” “Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “if they were ordered to give secret protection to Master, they had reason not to reveal themselves. That’s why they had to devise this cottage here, and you shouldn’t blame them. After all, they did put ointment on your eyes for you yesterday, and they did take care of us for one meal. You can say that they have done their duty. Don’t blame them. Let’s go and rescue Master.” “Brother, you are right,” said Pilgrim. “This place is not far from the Yellow Wind Cave. You had better stay here and look after the horse and luggage in the woods. Let old Monkey go into the cave to make some inquiry after the condition of Master. Then we can do battle with the monster again.” “Exactly,” said Eight Rules. “You should find out whether Master is dead or alive; if he’s dead, each one of us can tend to our own business; if he’s not, we can do our best to discharge our responsibility.” Pilgrim said, “Stop talking nonsense! I’m off!”",,"asked Sandy eagerly when Monkey reappeared. “Oh, woe,” wailed Tripitaka on learning of Wish Fulfillment’s frosty reception of Monkey. Monkey shrugged. “It’s all fine. I just need some backup from Sandy. I’ll fight the immortal while Sandy gets the water.” “But the two of us are ill,” worried Tripitaka. “Who will look after us?” “Don’t worry,” reassured the old woman. “We’ll take care of you. We wouldn’t dream of harming such illustrious visitors.” “What harm could you women do to us?” Monkey snorted scornfully. “You were lucky to have come straight to my door,” said their hostess, smiling. “If you’d wandered into another house, they’d have torn you to pieces.” “W-what do you mean?” whimpered Pigsy. “The five of us here are all too old to have thoughts of romance, so we wouldn’t lay a finger on you. But if you’d stumbled into a house of young women, they’d have forced you to have sex and killed you if you put up any resistance. Then they’d have skinned you and turned you into perfume bags.” “I’d be safe at least.” Pigsy sighed in relief. “I’m far too smelly to make perfume out of. The other three are deliciously fragrant though; can’t recommend them highly enough.” “Save your breath,” Monkey told him, laughing, “for giving birth.” “There’s no time to waste,” urged the woman. “Go get that water.”","“The wretches,” said Pig, “moving way in the middle of the night. Damn it, we must have been almost dead asleep. However did they dismantle the house without us hearing a thing?” “Idiot,” said Monkey with a snigger, “don't go shouting all over the place. Can you see what that piece of paper on the tree over there is?” Pig went over, tore it down, and saw that there were four lines of verse on it: “This farm was not inhabited by mortals; The Revealers of the Truth produced the house by magic. I gave you good medicine to cure your eyes: Subdue demons with all your heart, and never hesitate.” “So those tough gods came to play their tricks, although I haven't called the roll since they changed the dragon into a horse,” said Monkey. “Don't show off, brother,” said Pig. “How could they possibly answer to your roll-call?” “You don't realize,” Monkey replied, “that the Protectors of the Faith, the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions and the Four Duty Gods have all been ordered by the Bodhisattva to give secret protection to our master. They reported their names to me then, but as I've had you with me recently I haven't needed them again, which is why I haven't called the roll.” “Brother,” Pig replied, “if they have been ordered to protect our master in secret, then of course they can't appear in their true forms. That was why they produced the magic farm. You mustn't be angry with them. Yesterday they gave you eye ointment and fed us—they did all they could. Don't be angry with them. Let's go and rescue the master instead.” “How right you are,” said Monkey. “It's not far from here to the Yellow Wind Cave, so there's no need for you to move. You'd better stay in the wood and look after the horse and the luggage while I go to the cave to see what I can find out about where our master is before fighting the monster again.” “Yes,” said Pig, “find out for sure whether he's alive or dead. If the master's dead, we'd better each go our own way, and if he's alive we'll do everything we can to save him.” “Stop talking such nonsense,” replied Monkey. “I'm off.”"

It turns into a ox-eared knife, picks the skin from the tiger's belly, peels it down, and peels off the whole skin. Come, chop off the claws, cut off the head, cut a square piece of tiger skin, lift it up, measure it, and say, ""It's wider, one piece can be made two pieces."" He took the knife, Cut into two pieces. Putting one up, wrapping one around his waist, he grabbed a kudzu vine by the road, tied it tightly, covered his lower body, and said, ""Master, let's go! Let's go! When you get to someone's house, borrow some needles and thread, and it won't be too late to sew again. ."" He twisted the iron rod, still like a needle, put it in his ear, carried the luggage, and asked the master to mount the horse.","“Master,” said Pilgrim as he returned dragging the tiger, “sit down for awhile, and wait till I have stripped him of his clothes. When I put them on, we’ll start off again.” “Where does he have any clothes?” asked Tripitaka. “Don’t mind me, Master,” said Pilgrim, “I have my own plan.” Dear Monkey King! He pulled off one strand of hair and blew a mouthful of magic breath onto it, crying, “Change!” It changed into a sharp, curved knife, with which he ripped open the tiger’s chest. Slitting the skin straight down, he then ripped it off in one piece. He chopped away the paws and the head, cutting the skin into one square piece. He picked it up and tried it for size, and then said, “It’s a bit too large; one piece can be made into two.” He took the knife and cut it again into two pieces; he put one of these away and wrapped the other around his waist. Ripping off a strand of rattan from the side of the road, he firmly tied on this covering for the lower part of his body. “Master,” he said, “let’s go! Let’s go! When we reach someone’s house, we will have sufficient time to borrow some threads and a needle to sew this up.” He gave his iron rod a squeeze and it changed back into a tiny needle, which he stored in his ear. Throwing the luggage on his back, he asked his Master to mount the horse.","the Monk are also taken and bound. Being driven to despair, I have come to beg for a great favor. Take back the cap of spikes and let me return to my old mountain cave. You know that since I became human, well almost, and was converted to Buddhism, I have never failed in my duty. But this time these demons are more than a match for me.” Buddha said, “Do not be alarmed, I know these particular demons quite well.” Sun shouted back, “You must be in league with them!” Buddha said, “Just listen, will you?

They are servants of Manjusri of Mount Wutai in Shansi, and Samantadhadra, of Mount Emei in Sichuan.","He puts away between three and five pecks of rice at one sitting. A snack is at least a hundred bread rolls. Just as well he’s a vegetarian. If he demanded meat and wine, he’d have eaten and drunk me out of house and home in six months.” “Maybe he needs to eat a lot because he works so hard,” Tripitaka suggested. “His appetite’s actually the least of my worries,” resumed Mr. Gao. “He’s also fond of riding the wind and stirs up an almighty mess of stones and dirt whenever he comes and goes. Terrible nuisance for me and my neighbors. And then he locked up my youngest daughter, Emerald Orchid, in the back room of the house. I haven’t seen her for half a year and don’t know whether she’s dead or alive. Hence my suspicion that he’s a demon and my search for a reliable exorcist.” “Don’t worry, old man,” Monkey said, grinning. “Before the night’s out, I’ll capture him, have him sign the divorce papers, and return your daughter to you.” “Forget the paper trail,” said Mr. Gao. “Just get rid of him for me. Or my relatives will never speak to me again.” “Consider it done,” Monkey reassured him. By the time they had eaten, night was drawing in. “Do you need any weapons or reinforcements?” Mr. Gao asked Monkey. “Just me and my staff,” replied Monkey, removing the magic iron from his ear. With one wave, it grew into a substantial cudgel.","“Sit down for a moment, master, while I strip the clothes off him to wear on the journey,” said Brother Monkey as he dragged the tiger over. “But he hasn't got any clothes,” Sanzang protested. “Don't bother yourself about it, I know how to cope.” The splendid Monkey King pulled a hair from his body, breathed some magic breath on it, and said “Change!,” on which it turned into a pointed knife shaped like a cow's ear. Cutting into the skin on the tiger's belly, he took it all off in a single stroke, chopped off the head and claws, then held up the square hide to get an idea of its size. “It's on the big side,” he said, “so I could make two kilts out of it,” and with these words he took his knife and cut it in two. One piece he put away, and the other he wrapped round his waist to cover the lower half of his body and tied firmly with a creeper he pulled down from beside the path. “Let's go on, master, let's go on,” he said. “The sewing can wait till we reach a house where we can borrow a needle and thread.” He pinched his iron cudgel to make it as small as a needle again, put it back in his ear, took the luggage on his back, and asked Sanzang to mount the horse."

却说小姐自见儿子之后，心内一忧一喜，忽一日推病，茶饭不吃，卧于床上。刘洪归衙，问其原故，小姐道：“我幼时曾许下一愿，许舍僧鞋一百双。昨五日之前，梦见个和尚，手执利刃，要索僧鞋，便觉身子不快。”刘洪道：“这些小事，何不早说？”随升堂吩咐王左衙、李右衙：江州城内百姓，每家要办僧鞋一双，限五日内完纳。百姓俱依派完纳讫。小姐对刘洪道：,"But she said that after seeing her son, she felt a mixture of worry and joy in her heart, and suddenly put down the illness one day, did not eat tea and rice, and lay on the bed. Liu Hong returned to the Yap and asked the reason, and the young lady said, ""I made a wish when I was young to give away a hundred pairs of monk shoes. Five days ago, I dreamed of a monk holding a sharp blade and asking for monk shoes, and I felt unhappy. ""Liu Hong said, ""Why didn't you tell me about these little things earlier?"" Suishengtang instructed Wang Zuoya and Li Youya: Every household in Jiangzhou City should buy a pair of monk shoes, which should be paid within five days. The people are all sent to pay. Miss said to Liu Hong:","We were speaking of Lady Yin, who, having seen her son, was filled with both anxiety and joy. The next day, under the pretext of being sick, she lay on her bed and would take neither tea nor rice. Liu Hong returned to the mansion and questioned her. “When I was young,” said Lady Yin, “I vowed to donate a hundred pairs of monk shoes. Five days ago, I dreamed that a monk demanded those shoes of me, holding a knife in his hand. From then on, I did not feel well.” “Such a small matter!” said Liu Hong. “Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” He at once went up to the governor’s hall and gave the order to his stewards Wang and Li that a hundred families of the city were each to bring in a pair of monk shoes within five days. The families obeyed and completed their presentations. “Now that we have the shoes,” said Lady Yin to Liu Hong, “what kind of temple do we have nearby that I can go to fulfill my vow?”","Throughout the ages, Buddhism has been honored, and the incarnations of the great Patriarchs of Buddhism, and the appearance of Dharma amongst mortals are well known. From of old till now, all speak of the three religions as most worthy.

He arrived at Fayun Temple, where 500 monks received him. He said to them, “From the heart come all sorts of evil spirits. By the heart you can overcome them.”","The next day, still light-headed with joy and anxiety, Wenjiao took to her bed, pretending to be ill. Liu Hong asked her what was wrong. “When I was younger, I promised to donate a hundred pairs of shoes to Buddhist monks. Five days ago, I had a dream in which a monk holding a knife demanded the shoes, and my illness began the following morning.” “What a trifle!” sneered Liu Hong, and told his stewards to order a hundred families in the city to each deliver a pair of monk’s shoes within five days. “Which local temple should I donate them to?” asked Wenjiao, when the shoes were ready. “There’s Golden Mountain and Burned Mountain,” replied Liu Hong.","Now that she had seen her son Miss Yin was both anxious and happy. One day she said that she was ill, and she lay in her bed refusing food and tea. When Liu Hong came back and asked what was the matter she said, “When I was young I once vowed that I would donate a hundred pairs of monks' shoes. Five days ago I dreamt that a monk came with a sharp sword in his hand to demand the shoes, and since then I haven't been feeling well.” “That's easily done,” said Liu Hong. “Why didn't you mention it before?” He took his place in the official hall and gave instructions to yamen assistants Wang and Li that every household living in the city of Jiangzhou was to make a pair of monk's shoes and hand them in within five days. When the common people had handed all the shoes in, Miss Yin said to Liu Hong, “Now that the shoes have been made, what temples are there here to which I can take them to fulfil my vow?”"

The old man, carrying a piece of paper on his back, said that it was an angel sent from heaven, and there was an imperial decree to invite you.""

The Monkey King hurriedly straightened his clothes and greeted him outside the door. Jin Xing walked into the center, facing the south and said: ""I am the Western Taibaijinxing, and I follow the imperial decree of the Jade Emperor. I invite you to go up to the heaven and worship the immortal records."" Wukong smiled: ""I feel so much that the old star is coming."" Teach: ""Little Arrange a banquet and hospitality.""

This Monkey King and Venus raised the head of the cloud and rose above the sky, which is exactly that: Gao moved to the top of the heaven and was listed in the Cloud Class Treasure Record. After all, I don't know what official title was awarded, so let's listen to the decomposition next time. Hong Kong talents:","Having received the decree, the Gold Star went out of the South Heaven Gate, lowered the direction of his hallowed cloud, and headed straight for the Flower-Fruit Mountain and the Water-Curtain Cave. He said to the various little monkeys, “I am the Heavenly messenger sent from above. I have with me an imperial decree to invite your great king to go to the Upper Region. Report this to him quickly!” The monkeys outside the cave passed the word along one by one until it reached the depth of the cave. “Great King,” one of the monkeys said, “there’s an old man outside bearing a document on his back. He says that he is a messenger sent from Heaven, and he has an imperial decree of invitation for you.” Upon hearing this, the Handsome Monkey King was exceedingly pleased. “These last two days,” he said, “I was just thinking about taking a little trip to Heaven, and the heavenly messenger has already come to invite me!” The Monkey King quickly straightened out his attire and went to the door for the reception. The Gold Star came into the center of the cave and stood still with his face toward the south. “I am the Gold Star of Venus from the West,” he said. “I came down to Earth, bearing the imperial decree of pacification from the Jade Emperor, and invite you to go to Heaven to receive an immortal appointment.” Laughing, Wukong said, “I am most grateful for the Old Star’s visit.” He then gave the order: “Little ones, prepare a banquet to entertain our guest.” The Gold Star said, “As a bearer of imperial decree, I cannot remain here long. I must ask the Great King to go with me at once. After your glorious promotion, we shall have many occasions to converse at our leisure.” “We are honored by your presence,” said Wukong; “I am sorry that you have to leave with empty hands!” He then called the four mighty commanders together for this admonition: “Be diligent in teaching and drilling the young ones. Let me go up to Heaven to take a look and to see whether I can have you all brought up there too to live with me.” The four mighty commanders indicated their obedience. This Monkey King mounted the cloud with the Gold Star and rose up into the sky. Truly He ascends the high rank of immortals from the sky; His name’s enrolled in cloud columns and treasure scrolls. We do not know what sort of rank or appointment he received; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.","The Minister of Venus took it and went outside the South Gate and proceeded down on an auspicious cloud, till he got to the Mountain Garden of the Waterfall Cave. There he said to the crowd of small monkeys, “I am an ambassador sent from the Jade Emperor himself with an imperial edict to invite your Great King to go to heaven. Go and tell him at once!” The little monkeys outside the cave rushed in at once to the depths of the cave and said, “Great King, outside there is an old man who says he is an ambassador sent from the Jade Emperor with an edict to invite you to heaven.” The Monkey King was very delighted to hear it, and said, “These last few days I have just been thinking of going to heaven to look for myself. Quickly invite the messenger in.” The Monkey King hurriedly put on his clothes and went out to meet the Minister of Venus who came inside and standing with his face to the South said, “I am the Minister of Venus from the Palace of the Jade Emperor. I have been sent down to earth with a dispatch to invite you to heaven for an audience, and to become one of the officials in heaven.” The Seeker of Secrets smiled and said, “I am much obliged to you, Minister of Venus, for coming down to see me. We must arrange for a worthy banquet.” The Minister of Venus, replied, “I have the dispatch with me and I must not tarry long. I beg of you to return with me.” The Seeker of Secrets called his four strong generals and commanded them saying, “Be careful to drill my monkeys while I go to heaven to find out how to get there, so that I may later take you with me there.” Having given his commands, the Monkey King with the Minister of Venus rose amongst the clouds and passed beyond them. 4","Landing his auspicious cloud in front of Water-Curtain Cave, Gold Star announced himself and his mission to the crowd of monkeys: “I am the representative of the Jade Emperor, who invites your king to join the Heavenly civil service. Run along now and tell him.” The message bounced along a chain of monkey minions; by the time it reached their king deep inside the cave it had become: “ An old man outside with a piece of paper on his back says come up to Heaven.” “Ha!” exclaimed Monkey. “I was just thinking the other day how much I’d like to do that. Send him in!” Once inside, Gold Star introduced himself formally and repeated his invitation. “Don’t mind if I do, chum!” said Monkey, beaming. “But let’s feast first.” “As I’m on imperial business,” protested Gold Star, “I daren’t delay. Let us ascend to Heaven directly. Once the Jade Emperor has given you your Very Important Job, we’ll have plenty of time to chat.” “Sorry you’ll leave empty-bellied.” Monkey shrugged and called his four generals over: “Keep the little monkeys at their training. Meantime, I’ll have a sniff around Heaven and see whether you can all come, too.” He then hopped onto Gold Star’s personal cloud, and they rose into the sky.","The Great White Planet left Heaven by the Southern Gate, and brought his propitious cloud down by the Water Curtain Cave, where he said to the little monkeys, “I am an envoy from Heaven, and I am carrying a divine edict inviting your great king to the upper world. Go and tell him at once.” The little monkeys outside conveyed the message by relays into the depths of the cave: “Your Majesty, there's an old man outside carrying a document on his back. He says he's an envoy from Heaven with an invitation for you.” The Handsome Monkey King was delighted. He said, “I'd been thinking of going up to Heaven to have a look round for the past couple of days, and now a heavenly envoy has come to invite me.” “Ask him in at once,” he shouted, hastily straightening his clothes and going out to meet the envoy. The Planet came straight in, stood facing the South, and said, “I am the Great White Planet of the West, and I have come down to earth with an Edict of Amnesty and enlistment from the Jade Emperor to invite you to Heaven to be given office as an Immortal.” “I am very grateful to you, venerable Planet, for condescending to come here,” replied Sun Wukong with a smile; then he told his subjects to prepare a feast to entertain the visitor. “I'm afraid I can't delay,” replied the Planet, “as I am carrying a divine edict, so may I ask Your Majesty to come back with me now? We can talk at leisure after your glorious elevation.” “Thank you for coming,” said Sun Wukong. “I'm sorry you couldn't take some refreshments before leaving.” Then he called for his four Stalwart Generals and ordered them, “Give my sons and grandsons a thorough training. When I've had a look round in Heaven, I'll take you all to live with me up there.” The four Stalwart Generals accepted their orders, and the Monkey King made his cloud carry him up above the clouds. He was Raised to a high-ranking heavenly office, Listed among the courtiers in the clouds. If you don't know what office he was given, listen to the explanation in the next installment. Chapter 4"
二将军侍立门旁，一夜天晚，更不曾见一点邪崇。是夜，太宗在宫，安寝无事，晓来宣二将军，重重赏劳道：“朕自得疾，数日不能得睡，今夜仗二将军威势甚安。卿且请出安息安息，待晚间再一护卫。”二将谢恩而出。遂此二三夜把守俱安，只是御膳减损，病转觉重。太宗又不忍二将辛苦，又宣叔宝、敬德与杜、房诸公入宫，吩咐道：“这两日朕虽得安，却只难为秦、胡二将军彻夜辛苦。朕欲召巧手丹青，传二将军真容，贴于门上，免得劳他，如何？”众臣即依旨，选两个会写真的，着胡、秦二公依前披挂，照样画了，贴在门上，夜间也即无事。,"The second general stood beside the door, and all night long, he never saw any evil spirits. That night, Taizong was in the palace, sleeping peacefully, and Xiao came to announce the second general, and rewarded him heavily and said: ""I am sick of myself and cannot sleep for several days. Tonight, the second general is very powerful. Please go out and rest in peace. I'll escort me again at night."" The second general came out with thanks. Therefore, for two or three nights, the guards were all safe, but the royal meal was damaged, and the illness turned serious. Taizong couldn't bear the hard work of the two generals, so he announced that Shubao, Jingde, Du and Fang entered the palace, and ordered: ""Although I have been safe these two days, it is difficult for the two generals Qin and Hu to work all night. I want to summon Qiao. Hand Danqing, tell the true face of the second general, and stick it on the door, so as not to trouble him, how?"" The ministers followed the order and chose two who would be able to take pictures. At the door, there is nothing to do at night.","The two generals stood beside the door for the entire night and did not see the slightest disturbance. That night Taizong rested peacefully in the palace; when morning came he summoned the two generals before him and thanked them profusely, saying, “Since falling ill, I haven’t been able to sleep for days, and only last night did I manage to get some rest because of your presence. Let our worthy ministers retire now for some rest so that we may count on your protection once again at night.” The two generals left after expressing their gratitude, and for the following two or three nights their standing guard brought continued peace. However, the royal appetite diminished and the illness became more severe. Taizong, moreover, could not bear to see the two generals overworked. So once again he called Shubao, Jingde, the ministers Du and Fang into the palace, saying to them, “Though I got some rest these past two days, I have imposed on the two generals the hardship of staying up all night. I wish to have portraits made of both of them by a skilled painter and have these pasted on the door, so that the two generals will be spared any further labor. How about it?” The various ministers obeyed; they selected two portrait painters, who made pictures of the two generals in their proper battle attire. The portraits were then mounted near the gate, and no incident occurred during the night.","Seeing some light, he made for it, thinking he could get some food, but it was a demon’s trap, and he was caught in it. The demon rejoiced greatly at the prospect of enjoying human flesh and thus becoming immortal. But the two disciples came, and discovering that their Master was inside, launched an attack on the demon. The two disciples fought thirty times without being vanquished. The Master, who was bound inside, was praying for them. He was also weeping, fearing that he would be murdered, although he knew that his time had not yet come. Then a woman of about thirty years old entered and, seeing the Master, asked him who he was. She told him she was the Princess from the Elephant Country, and had been carried away by this demon thirteen years before. If the Master would deliver a letter to her father on his way to the West, she would unbind him and let him go. This was agreed on, and through her help, the Master and his disciples were able to escape. Having passed through a dark forest, they arrived at the court of the princess’ father, where the Master delivered the letter begging for rescue from the demon husband.","That evening the ministers donned full, gleaming battle dress and, armed with bludgeons and battle-axes, watched over the palace gate; Taizong at last had a peaceful night’s sleep.","The two generals stood beside the doors till deep into the night, and not a single demon did they see. That night Taizong slept peacefully in the palace and nothing happened. When morning came he called the two generals in and gave them rich rewards. “We had not been able to sleep for several days since we fell ill,” he said, “but last night was very peaceful, thanks to the awesome might of you two generals. Please go and rest now so that you can guard us again tonight.” The two generals thanked him and left. For the next two or three nights they stood guard and all was quiet; but the Emperor ate less and less as his illness took a turn for the worse. Not wishing to put the two generals to any more trouble, he summoned them to the palace with Du Ruhui and Fang Xuanling. These were the instructions he gave them: “Although we have enjoyed peace for the last two days, we are unhappy about the night-long ordeals we have imposed on Generals Qin and Yuchi. We therefore wish to commission two skilled painters to make faithful portraits of the two generals to paste on the doors so that they may be saved trouble. What do you think?” In obedience to the imperial decree the officials chose two men who could draw a good likeness, and the two generals wore their armour as before while they were painted. Then the pictures were stuck on the doors, and there was no trouble that night."
诗曰：龙集贞观正十三，王宣大众把经谈。道场开演无量法，云雾光乘大愿龛。御敕垂恩修上刹，金蝉脱壳化西涵。普施善果超沉没，秉教宣扬前后三。贞观十三年，岁次己巳，九月甲戌初三日，癸卯良辰。陈玄奘大阐法师，聚集一千二百名高僧，都在长安城化生寺开演诸品妙经。那皇帝早朝已毕，帅文武多官，乘凤辇龙车，出离金銮宝殿，径上寺来拈香。怎见那銮驾？真个是：一天瑞气，万道祥光。仁风轻淡荡，化日丽非常。,"The poem says: Long Jizhengguan is the thirteenth, Wang Xuan public talks about the sutras. In the dojo, the immeasurable method was performed, and the clouds, mist, and light traveled through the Great Wishing Shrine. The imperial decree gracefully repaired the upper brake, and the golden cicada took off the shell and transformed the Xihan. The good fruit of Pu Shi is super sunk, and the teachings are preached before and after three. In the thirteenth year of Zhenguan, the age is Jisi, and the third day of the first month of Jiaxu in September is the good day of Guimao. Master Chen Xuanzang Dachan gathered 1,200 eminent monks, and they all performed various wonderful sutras at Huasheng Temple in Chang'an City. The emperor had already finished his court, and he was handsome, civil and military, and had many officials. He rode a phoenix chariot and a dragon chariot, left the golden palace, and went to the temple to burn incense. How do you see that Luan Jia? The real one is: One day is auspicious, and ten thousand auspicious light. The wind of benevolence is light and swaying, and the sun is very beautiful.","The king called his people to hear the Sacred Books. The boundless Law was performed at a plot of truth; Cloud, fog, and light filled the Great Promise Hall. By grace the king decreed this grand temple’s rite; Shell-shed Gold Cicada sought wealth of the West. He spread wide the good works to save the damned And held his faith to preach the Three Modes of Life.13 In the thirteenth year of the Zhenguan period, when the year stood at jisi and the ninth month at jiaxu, on the third day and at the auspicious hour of gueimao, Chen Xuanzang, the Great Expositor-Priest, gathered together one thousand two hundred illustrious monks. They met at the Temple of Transformation in the city of Chang’an to expound the various holy sūtras. After holding court early that morning, the emperor led many officials both military and civil and left the Treasure Hall of Golden Chimes by phoenix carriages and dragon chariots. They came to the temple to listen to the lectures and raise incense. How does the imperial cortege appear? Truly it comes with A sky full of blessed air, Countless shafts of hallowed light. The favorable wind blows gently; The omnific sun shines brightly.","At the sight of this, Sun shouted out, “Who is Master of the Clouds?” A young man came forward and bowed, and Sun threatened him with twenty blows if he did not disperse the clouds at once. Immediately after this, the sun shone forth brightly and there was not a cloud in the sky for ten thousand li. At this, the Wizard cut loose his hair with the sword, recited an incantation and burnt another charm. Then he struck the table as his third signal. At this, from the south gate of heaven there appeared the Master of Thunder and the Mistress of Lightning before Sun and bowed to him. Sun reprimanded them, as he had done the others, for helping the demons so earnestly instead of helping him. They replied that the charms and dispatches had been burnt, and sent to the Jade Emperor by the Wizard, and the edict they had received was a genuine one ordering them to help in thunder, lightning, and rain. Sun said, “Since it is so, wait here and serve me now.”","“You’re the monk who brought us the robe, aren’t you? Why are you breaking up the mass by arguing with our priest?” “Your priest does not know the path to salvation,” Guanyin told him without bowing first. “For that, you need my Tripitaka—the scriptures of the great vehicle.” “And where are they?” the emperor asked eagerly. “In Thunderclap Monastery in India, the Western Heaven—the home of the Buddha. These teachings can unravel a hundred grievances and dispel unimagined calamities.” “Can you recite any of it from memory?” Guanyin and Hui’an now rose up, took their actual forms, and hovered beatifically above the crowd on auspicious clouds.","At the assembly they began to expound the unfathomable law, While clouds glowed above the great shrine. The Emperor in his grace orders the building of a temple; The Golden Cicada sheds his skin to edify the West. He spreads the news that rewards for goodness save from ill, Preaching the doctrine of the three Buddhas of past and future. In the year jisi, the thirteenth of Zhen Guan, on the day jiaxu, the third of the ninth month, the Hierarch Chen Xuanzang assembled twelve hundred venerable monks at the Huasheng Temple in the city of Chang'an for a chanting of all the holy scriptures. After morning court was over the Emperor left the throne hall in his dragon and phoenix chariot at the head of a host of civil and military officials and went to the temple to burn incense. What did the imperial chariot look like? Indeed Propitious vapours filled the sky That shone with ten thousand beams of sacred light. A mellow breeze blew softly, The sunlight was strangely beautiful."
行者拿了，按着云头，径到禅堂房脊上，罩住了唐僧与白马、行李，他却去那后面老和尚住的方丈房上头坐，着意保护那袈裟。看那些人放起火来，他转捻诀念咒，望巽地上吸一口气吹将去，一阵风起，把那火转刮得烘烘乱着。好火！好火！但见：黑烟漠漠，红焰腾腾。黑烟漠漠，长空不见一天星；红焰腾腾，大地有光千里赤。起初时，灼灼金蛇；次后来，威威血马。南方三炁逞英雄，回禄大神施法力。燥干柴烧烈火性，说甚么燧人钻木；熟油门前飘彩焰，赛过了老祖开炉。正是那无情火发，怎禁这有意行凶，不去弭灾，反行助虐。风随火势，焰飞有千丈余高；火趁风威，灰迸上九霄云外。乒乒乓乓，好便似残年爆竹；泼泼喇喇，却就如军中炮声。烧得那当场佛象莫能逃，东院伽蓝无处躲。胜如赤壁夜鏖兵，赛过阿房宫内火！这正是星星之火，能烧万顷之田。须臾间，风狂火盛，把一座观音院，处处通红。你看那众和尚，搬箱抬笼，抢桌端锅，满院里叫苦连天。,"The traveler took it, pressed the cloud head, and walked to the ridge of the meditation hall, covering the Tang monk, the white horse, and the luggage, but he went to sit on the abbot's room where the old monk lived in the back, deliberately protecting the cassock. Seeing those people set fire, he twisted the tactic and chanted the mantra, and looked at the ground to take a breath and blow it away, and a gust of wind blew the fire into chaos. good fire! good fire! But see: black smoke, red flames. Dark smoke, the sky does not see a single star; the red flames are soaring, and the earth is bright red for thousands of miles. At first, it was a burning golden snake; later, it was a mighty blood horse. Sanqi in the south is a hero, and the great god Huilu casts mana. Dry wood burns fiery fire, what is it like to say that a flint man drills wood; the colorful flames float in front of the cooked gas pedal, which surpasses that of the ancestors when they opened the furnace. It is that ruthless fire, how to stop this intentional murder, not to destroy disasters, but to help abuse. The wind followed the fire, and the flames flew more than a thousand feet high; the fire took advantage of the wind, and the ashes burst into the clouds. Ping, ping, pong, like firecrackers in the last years of life; Burned to the point where the Buddha statue was unable to escape, and the East Courtyard Garan had nowhere to hide. Victory is like a fighter in the night on the red cliff, surpassing the fire in the Epang Palace! This is the fire of a single star, which can burn thousands of acres of fields. In a short time, the wind and fire were raging, turning a Guanyin courtyard into red everywhere. Look at the monks, carrying boxes and cages, grabbing tables and pots, and the courtyard is full of misery.","Pilgrim took it and descended through the clouds to the roof of the Chan hall, where he covered up the Tang Monk, the white horse, and the luggage. He himself then went to sit on the roof of the back room occupied by the old monk in order to guard the cassock. As he saw the people lighting the fire, he pressed his fingers together to make a magic sign and recited a spell. Facing the ground to the southwest, he took a deep breath and then blew it out. At once a strong wind arose and whipped the fire into a mighty blaze. What a fire! What a fire! You see Rolling black smoke; Vaulting red flames. With rolling black smoke All the stars vanish from the vast sky; With vaulting red flames The earth’s lit up, made crimson for a thousand miles. At the beginning, What gleaming snakes of gold! Soon thereafter, What imposing bloody horses! The Three Southern Forces display their might. The Great God of Fire reveals his power. When dried wood burns in such fire intense, Why speak of Suiren4 drilling fire from wood ? When colored flames shoot out of hot-oiled doors, They match even the opened oven of Laozi. This is how fire rages ruthlessly, Though no worse than such intended fraud As not suppressing misdeeds And abetting violence. The wind sweeps the fire And flames fly up for some eight thousand feet; The fire’s helped by the wind, So ashes burst beyond the Ninefold Heaven. Ping-ping, pang-pang, They sound like those firecrackers at year’s end. Po-po, la-la, They’re like the roar of cannons in the camps. It burns till the Buddha’s image cannot flee from the scene, And the Temple Guardians have no place to hide. It’s like the Red Cliff Campaign in the night,5 Surpassing the fire at Epang Palace.6 As the saying goes, “One little spark of fire can burn ten thousand acres.” In a moment, the strong wind and the raging fire made the entire Guanyin Hall glowing red. Look at all those monks! They began to bring out the chests and carry out the drawers, to grab for tables and snatch up pots. A loud wailing filled the whole courtyard.",,"I’d originally planned to slaughter the tiger for our wedding feast, but the princess begged me to spare its life, as it had brought us together. So I let it go. But the tiger recovered from its wound and became an evil spirit. It ate the pilgrims from the Tang empire that everyone’s talking about, stole their travel papers, and impersonated one of them to deceive my revered father-in-law. There he is”—he pointed to Tripitaka—“sitting on your very own brocade cushion: the tiger that kidnapped your daughter.” The dim-witted king found this story entirely plausible. “But how can you tell this is the same tiger?” “Tigers are my specialty. How would I not know one when I see one?” “Make him appear in his true form,” ordered the king. The monster approached Tripitaka, muttered the eye-dimming spell, and spat a mouthful of water over the monk. Everyone in the court now saw Tripitaka only as a ferocious tiger with lightning eyes, hooked claws, sawlike teeth, and appalling, meaty breath. While the king melted into a puddle of fear and most of his courtiers fled for safety, a handful of brave army officers began hacking at the “tiger” with their weapons. If it hadn’t been for all his Heavenly guardians creating a protective force field around him, Tripitaka would have been cut to pieces. Eventually, by evening, the panic had subsided, and the “tiger” was clapped in irons and locked in an iron cage.","Taking the cover, Monkey pressed down on his cloud and went straight to the roof of the meditation hall, where he spread the cover over the Tang Priest, the dragon horse, and the luggage. Then he went to sit on top of the aged monk's room to protect the cassock. As he watched them starting the fire he kept on reciting a spell and blew some magic breath towards the Southwest, at which a wind arose and fanned the flames up into a wild and roaring blaze. What a fire! Spreading black smoke, Leaping red flames; The spreading black smoke blotted out all the stars in the sky, The leaping red flames made the earth glow red for hundreds of miles. When it started It was a gleaming golden snake; Later on It was a spirited horse. The Three Spirits of the South showed their might, The Fire God Huilu wielded his magic power, The bone-dry kindling burned ferociously, As when the Emperor Suiren drilled wood to start a fire. Flames leapt up from the boiling oil before the doors, Brighter than when Lord Lao Zi opens his furnace. As the cruel fire spreads, What can stop this willful murder? Instead of dealing with the disaster They abetted it. As the wind fanned the fire. The flames flew many miles high; As the fire grew in the might of the wind, Sparks burst through the Nine Heavens. Cracking and banging, Like firecrackers at the end of the year; Popping and bursting, Like cannon-fire in battle. None of the Buddha statues could escape the blaze, And the guardian gods in the Eastern court had nowhere to hide. It was fiercer that the fire-attack at Red Cliff, Or the burning of the Epang Palace. A single spark can start a prairie fire. In a few moments the raging wind had blown the fire up into an inferno, and the whole Guanyin Monastery was red. Look at the monks as they move away boxes and baskets, grabbing tables and carrying cooking-pots on their heads. The whole monastery was full of the sound of shouting and weeping."
孙行者护住了后边方丈，辟火罩罩住了前面禅堂，其余前后火光大发，真个是照天红焰辉煌，透壁金光照耀！,"Sun Xingzhe protected the abbot at the back, and the fire hood covered the front of the meditation hall. The rest of the front and back were full of fire. It was a brilliant red flame, shining through the walls with golden light!","Pilgrim Sun, however, stood guard at the back while the Fire-Repelling Cover securely screened off the Chan hall at the front. The rest of the place was completely lit up; truly the sky was illuminated by brilliant red flames, and bright gold light shone through the walls.",,"The king then ordered the royal catering department to drum up a lavish banquet to thank his son-in-law for saving him from the specious Buddhist. That evening, eighteen palace ladies sang, danced, and plied the monster with drink in the Hall of Silver Peace.","Brother Monkey protected the abbot's rooms at the back, and the Anti-fire Cover covered the meditation hall in front; everywhere else the fire raged, its red flames reflected in the sky and its dazzling brightness shining through the wall."
下请书的小校，被孙行者打死在大路旁边，他绰着经儿变化做金池长老，来骗佛衣也！”那怪闻言，暗道：“我说那长老怎么今日就来，又来得迅速，果然是他！”急纵身，拿过枪来，就刺行者。行者耳朵里急掣出棍子，现了本相，架住枪尖，就在他那中厅里跳出，自天井中，斗到前门外，唬得那洞里群魔都丧胆，家间老幼尽无魂。这场在山头好赌斗，比前番更是不同。好杀：,"The small school who asked for the book was beaten to death by Sun Xingzhe by the side of the road. Hearing the words, that strange said secretly: ""I said, why did the elder come today, and he came so quickly, it really is him!"" He jumped in a hurry, took the gun, and stabbed the walker. The walker quickly pulled a stick out of his ear, and when he realized the truth, he held the tip of the gun, and jumped out of his central hall. All the demons in that cave were scared, and there were no souls in the family, old and young. This time, there is a lot of gambling and fighting on the mountain, which is even more different than the previous one. Good to kill:","The junior officer who went to deliver the invitation was beaten to death by Pilgrim Sun and left by the wayside. Our enemy followed the clue and changed himself into the Golden Pool Elder so that he could obtain the Buddha robe by fraud.” When the monster heard that, he said to himself, “I was wondering already why he came today, and in such a hurried manner too! So, it’s really he!” Leaping up, he grabbed his lance and aimed it at Pilgrim. Whipping out the rod from his ear, Pilgrim assumed his original form and parried the lance. They rushed from the living room to the front courtyard, and from there they fought their way out to the front door. The monsters in the cave were frightened out of their wits; young and old in that household were horror-stricken. This fierce contest before the mountain was even unlike the last one. What a fight!",,"Immediately confirming that it was Pigsy, Silver Horn charged. But Pigsy wasn’t willing to go quietly. Seizing his rake (which Silver Horn loudly disparaged as a pilfered gardening implement), the enraged Pigsy fought with a reckless ferocity, flapping his ears, spitting, whooping. But then Silver Horn summoned his thirty fiends as backup, and Pigsy panicked as they swarmed toward him. Turning to flee, he tripped over a vine and the goblins were all over him in a moment and hauled him back to the cave. “We caught one, brother!” announced Silver Horn. Golden Horn rushed over to see, but his delight quickly turned to disappointment.","Brother Monkey has killed the lieutenant who is taking the invitation by the main path, and taken the chance of making himself look like the Elder of the Golden Pool to come here and trick the Buddha's robe out of you.” “I wondered why the elder came today,” the monster thought, “and why he came so soon, and now I see that it's really him.” He leapt to his feet, grabbed his halberd, and thrust at Monkey. Monkey pulled the cudgel from his ear in a flash, reverted to his true form, parried the halberd's blade, jumped out from the main room into the courtyard, and fought his way back out through the front gates. This terrified all the fiends in the cave, scaring the wits out of young and old alike. The fine combat on the mountain that ensued was even better than the previous one."
说话间，不觉的天色将晚。小的们排开桌凳，拿几盘烂熟虎肉，热腾腾的放在上面。伯钦请三藏权用，再另办饭。三藏合掌当胸道：“善哉！贫僧不瞒太保说，自出娘胎，就做和尚，更不晓得吃荤。”伯钦闻得此说，沉吟了半晌道：“长老，寒家历代以来，不晓得吃素。就是有些竹笋，采些木耳，寻些干菜，做些豆腐，也都是獐鹿虎豹的油煎，却无甚素处。有两眼锅灶，也都是油腻透了，这等奈何？反是我请长老的不是。”三藏道：“太保不必多心，请自受用。我贫僧就是三五日不吃饭，也可忍饿，只是不敢破了斋戒。”伯钦道：“倘或饿死，却如之何？”三藏道：,"While talking, it was getting late. The little ones lined up the tables and stools, took a few plates of overcooked tiger meat, and placed them on it hot. Birqin asked Sanzang to use it, and then prepare another meal. Sanzang put his palms together and said, ""Excellent! The poor monk told the Taibao that he has been a monk since he was born, and he doesn't even know how to eat meat."" Hearing this, Boqin pondered for a while and said, ""Elder, the Han family has been around for a long time. , I don't know how to be a vegetarian. Even some bamboo shoots, some fungus, some dried vegetables, and some tofu are all fried with roe, deer, tiger and leopard, but they are not very ordinary. There are two-eye pots and stoves, and they are all greasy. , what can I do? It’s not that I invited the elders.” Sanzang said: “The Taibao doesn’t have to worry about it, please use it yourself. Even if I don’t eat for three to five days, I can endure hunger, but I don’t dare to break my fast.” Boqin said, ""What if I starve to death?"" Sanzang said:","As they talked, the sky began to darken. The servants brought chairs and a table and set out several dishes of well-cooked tiger meat, steaming hot. Boqin invited Tripitaka to begin, telling him that rice would follow. “O dear!” said Tripitaka, his hands folded. “To tell you the truth, I have been a monk since leaving my mother’s womb, and I have never eaten any meat.” Hearing this, Boqin reflected awhile. He then said, “Elder, for generations this humble family has never kept a vegetarian diet. We could, I suppose, find some bamboo shoots and wood ears and prepare some dried vegetables and bean cakes, but they would all be cooked with the fat of deer or tigers. Even our pots and pans are grease-soaked! What am I to do? I must ask the elder’s pardon.” “Don’t fret,” said Tripitaka. “Enjoy the food yourself. Even if I were not to eat for three or four days, I could bear the hunger. But I dare not break the dietary commandment.” “Suppose you starve to death,” said Boqin, “what then?” “I am indebted to the Heavenly kindness of the Guardian,” said Tripitaka, “for saving me from the packs of tigers and wolves.","Then they returned to the Sound of Thunder Temple. The little demons could see that that their chief had been vanquished, and fled away in terror. But Sun pursued and killed them all. The Master and pilgrims were then discovered, and the heavenly allies were all liberated from the vault, and thanked Sun and the others for their assistance. Before the pilgrims resumed their journey they set fire to the temple which had been used to deceive worshippers. And that was the end of that. 20 Sun Becomes a Doctor The Good get the help of ten thousand Providences. Their fame spreads to the four continents, Their wisdom shines on the life to come. They are blown about to the ends of heaven.","Without pausing for formalities, Monkey whacked the dragon’s head with his staff, while his opponent fought back with teeth and claws. After a long and frenzied engagement, the dragon eventually grew tired and retreated back to the bed of the stream. Monkey continued to heap vitriol upon him, but the dragon suddenly developed hearing difficulties. Monkey went back to Tripitaka and made a full report. “That day you killed the tiger, you said you could defeat any animal,” Tripitaka needled him. “Why not this dragon?” Monkey was very susceptible to this kind of provocation. “Enough!” he bellowed. “I’ll go have a few more words with him.” He bounded back to the stream. Mustering his magic powers, he churned the calm waters of Eagle’s Sorrow until they resembled the turbid, zigzagging waves of the Yellow River at high tide, in order to flush the dragon out. When you’re stuck at the bottom of a well, someone’s bound to drop a rock on your head, the unfortunate creature thought to himself. Barely a year after I escaped execution in Heaven, here I am being harassed by this churlish demon. He decided to re-emerge to have it out with Monkey.","While they talked they had not noticed the evening drawing in. The servants set out a table and stools, then brought in several dishes of tender tiger-meat, which they placed steaming hot on the table. Liu Boqin asked Sanzang to help himself while he served the rice. Putting his hands together in front of his chest, Sanzang replied, “This is wonderful, but I must tell you frankly that I have been a monk ever since I left my mother's womb, so I am quite unable to eat meat.” Boqin thought for a while before replying, “Venerable monk, our family has not eaten vegetarian food for generations. When we cut bamboo shoots, pick fungus, gather wild vegetables for drying, or make bean-curd we always cook them in the fat of roebuck, deer, tiger or leopard, so even they aren't really vegetarian; and our two cooking pots are steeped in fat, so what are we to do? I'm afraid it was wrong of me to ask you here.” “There's no need to worry,” Sanzang answered. “Please go ahead and eat. I'd go without food for four or five days, or even starve, rather than break the monastic rule about vegetarian food.” “But we can't have you starving to death,” protested Liu Boqin."
老王道：“仓卒无肴，不敢苦劝，请再进一筋。”三藏、行者俱道：,"The old king said: ""There is no food in haste, I dare not persuade hard, please add a muscle."" Sanzang and Xing Zhe said:","“In our haste we have not prepared any dainty viands,” said old Wang, “and I dare not press you too much. Please take at least one more helping.” Both Tripitaka and Pilgrim said, “We have had enough.”",,"Deciding to hide something in the box himself, the king disappeared into his garden, chose an enormous peach, and returned for another round of guessing.","“As this is far from being haute cuisine, I cannot press you too hard, but please take another mouthful.” “We have eaten enough,” said Sanzang and Monkey; but Pig said, “What are you going on about, old fellow?"
次早，太宗设朝，聚集文武，写了取经文牒，用了通行宝印。有钦天监奏曰：“今日是人专吉星，堪宜出行远路。”唐王大喜。又见黄门官奏道：“御弟法师朝门外候旨。”随即宣上宝殿道：“御弟，今日是出行吉日。这是通关文牒。朕又有一个紫金钵盂，送你途中化斋而用。再选两个长行的从者，又银駔的马一匹，送为远行脚力。你可就此行程。”玄奘大喜，即便谢了恩，领了物事，更无留滞之意。唐王排驾，与多官同送至关外，只见那洪福寺僧与诸徒将玄奘的冬夏衣服，俱送在关外相等。唐王见了，先教收拾行囊马匹，然后着官人执壶酌酒。太宗举爵，又问曰：“御弟雅号甚称？”玄奘道：“贫僧出家人，未敢称号。”太宗道：“当时菩萨说，西天有经三藏。御弟可指经取号，号作三藏何如？”玄奘又谢恩，接了御酒道：“陛下，酒乃僧家头一戒，贫僧自为人，不会饮酒。”太宗道：“今日之行，比他事不同。此乃素酒，只饮此一杯，以尽朕奉饯之意。”三藏不敢不受。接了酒，方待要饮，只见太宗低头，将御指拾一撮尘土，弹入酒中。,"The next morning, Emperor Taizong set up a court, gathered the civil and military, wrote the ultimatum to take the scriptures, and used the seal of the pass. You Qin Tianjian said: ""Today is a lucky star for people, and it is suitable to travel long distances."" The king of Tang was overjoyed. Then I saw the Huangmen official playing: ""Master Yudi is waiting for the order outside the door."" Then he announced to the treasure hall and said: ""Brother Yu, today is an auspicious day for travel. This is the customs clearance letter. I have another purple-gold bowl. I will send you on the way. Use it for fasting. Choose two more long-distance servants, and a silver horse, and give it as a long-distance foot power. You can go on this journey."" Xuanzang was overjoyed, even if he thanked him and received things, he would not stay. stagnant meaning. The king of Tang lined up and sent many officials to the outside of the pass, but the monks and disciples of Hongfu Temple sent Xuanzang's winter and summer clothes to the outside of the pass. When the king of Tang saw him, he first taught him to pack his bags and horses, and then let the officials hold the pot and drink wine. Emperor Taizong raised the title and asked, ""What is the name of the royal brother?"" Xuanzang said: ""The poor monk is a monk, but he does not dare to be called a family."" Taizong said: ""At that time, the Bodhisattva said that there are three collections of scriptures in the West. The royal brother can refer to the scriptures and take the title How about the name of Sanzang?"" Xuanzang thanked him again, took the wine and said, ""Your Majesty, wine is the first precept of the monk's family, and the poor monk is a person and does not know how to drink."" Taizong said: ""Today's trip is different from other things. This is plain wine, just drink this one cup to fulfill my intention of honoring.” Sanzang dared not accept it. After receiving the wine, he was about to drink it, but Taizong lowered his head, picked up a pinch of dust with his imperial finger, and flicked it into the wine.","The disciples all committed his words firmly to memory. The next morning Taizong held court and gathered all the officials together. They wrote up the formal rescript stating the intent to acquire scriptures and stamped it with the seal of free passage. The President of the Imperial Board of Astronomy then came with the report, “Today the positions of the planets are especially favorable for men to make a journey of great length.” The Tang emperor was most delighted. Thereafter the Custodian of the Yellow Gate also made a report, saying, “The Master of the Law awaits your pleasure outside the court.” The emperor summoned him up to the treasure hall and said, “Royal Brother, today is an auspicious day for the journey, and your rescript for free passage is ready. We also present you with a bowl made of purple gold for you to collect alms on your way. Two attendants have been selected to accompany you, and a horse will be your means of travel. You may begin your journey at once.” Highly pleased, Xuanzang expressed his gratitude and received his gifts, not displaying the least desire to linger. The Tang emperor called for his carriage and led many officials outside the city gate to see him off. The monks in the Temple of Great Blessing and the disciples were already waiting there with Xuanzang’s winter and summer clothing. When the emperor saw them, he ordered the bags to be packed on the horses first, and then asked an officer to bring a pitcher of wine. Taizong lifted his cup to toast the pilgrim, saying, “What is the byname of our Royal Brother?” “Your poor monk,” said Xuanzang, “is a person who has left the family. He dares not assume a byname.” “The Bodhisattva said earlier,” said Taizong, “that there were three collections of scriptures in the Western Heaven. Our Brother can take that as a byname and call himself Tripitaka. How about it?” Thanking him, Xuanzang accepted the wine and said, “Your Majesty, wine is the first prohibition of priesthood. Your poor monk has practiced abstinence since birth.” “Today’s journey,” said Taizong, “is not to be compared with any ordinary event. Please drink one cup of this dietary wine, and accept our good wishes that go along with the toast.” Xuanzang dared not refuse; he took the wine and was about to drink, when he saw Taizong stoop down to scoop up a handful of dirt with his fingers and sprinkle it in the wine.","It cannot be he that has created an impostor Master to fetch the Sacred Scriptures.” Then Sha proposed that Sun should go with him to the Waterfall Cave and see the demon impostor for himself. When Sun Wukong and Sha the Monk arrived at the Waterfall Cave, they found the impostor sitting on the stone terrace drinking wine. Then Sun’s anger was kindled and he went forward and cursed the demon who was impersonating him, and taking possession of his home. They engaged in combat. Sha the Monk wished greatly to help, but was much perplexed: the two were so much alike that he feared he might aid the false one. So he went into the cave in search of the Master’s bag with the imperial edict. But he could not find it. When he came out, the two were still fighting. They both cried out to him to return to the Master, and tell him all that had taken place. Sha the Monk was still more perplexed, as their words were the same, and their appearance identical. The two monkeys, still fighting, made their way to the Southern Ocean. Guanyin and her attendants came forth to see them. Both of them cried out to her, “This monkey has taken my shape, and we have been fighting all the way from the Waterfall Cave. I have come to beg you to help me.” Guanyin and her fairies looked from one to the other, but could not detect any difference between them. She bade them cease from fighting, and she again scrutinized them. Then she called for Mucha and the Red Child, who was now called Sadhana the Page, to come forth, and said to them, “I am going to pronounce a certain incantation and you must watch carefully and note which of them complains of pain in the head.” So she recited the incantation to cause the spikes of Sun’s cap to enter his head, but both of them cried out to her to cease, for the spikes were piercing the heads of both of them. Finally they went up to Heaven so that the Jade Emperor should decide. The true Sun made his complaint that he was escorting the Buddhist pilgrim from China to fetch the Sacred Scriptures from the West, but that he was attacked on the way, and that the imperial edict had been stolen, and carried to his old home the Waterfall Cave, by the false Sun, who had appropriated everything there.","A question came to Tripitaka as they walked: “What happened to the cudgel you hit the tiger with?” With a happy laugh, Monkey explained the provenance of the weapon and its name. “It came in pretty handy when I rebelled against Heaven, because I could shrink and grow it as required.” “And how come that tiger froze as soon as it saw you?” Tripitaka asked. “I can defeat dragons and tigers, and churn rivers and oceans. I can read a person from one glance at their face; I can discern truth from sounds. I can grow as big as the universe or shrink to smaller than a hair. I have mastered infinite transformations and can turn invisible and visible at will. Killing that tiger was child’s play. Give me a proper challenge and I’ll show you what I’m made of.” All this was music to Tripitaka’s easily frightened ears, and the two of them barely noticed the day drawing in as they walked and chatted. “It’s getting late,” observed Monkey. “There should be a house in that copse of trees ahead. Let’s ask to spend the night.” He marched up to the door. “Open up!” An old man leaning on a bamboo staff came to the door. One glance at Monkey—bulbous muzzle, red eyes, freshly flayed tiger-skin kilt—and the old man began babbling fearfully about demons. “Don’t be afraid, sir,” Tripitaka reassured him. “I am a monk and he is my disciple.” The old man gazed, somewhat reassured, at Tripitaka’s handsome, guileless face. “But what sort of temple accepts monks as ugly as that?” Tripitaka now explained where he had come from and where he was going, and asked to stay for a night. “That eyesore of a disciple of yours doesn’t look very Chinese to me,” said the old man doubtfully. “I’m the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, you dim geriatric,” scolded Monkey. “And anyway, we’ve met plenty of times before.","All his disciples committed his words most carefully to memory. At court the next morning Taizong assembled his civil and military officials and wrote out the document Xuanzang would need to fetch the scriptures, stamping it with the imperial seal that gave the right to travel freely. When an imperial astrologer reported that this day was under an auspicious star for setting out on a long journey, the Tang Emperor was delighted. A eunuch official came in to report, “The Imperial Younger Brother, the Master of the Law, awaits a summons outside the palace doors.” Calling him into the throne hall, Taizang said, “Brother, today is a lucky one for starting on a journey, and here is the pass that will let you through the checkpoints. I am also giving you a golden bowl with which you may beg for food on your journey, in addition to choosing two experienced travelers to accompany you and presenting you with a horse to carry you on your long journey. You may now set out.” Xuanzang, who was very happy to hear this, thanked the Emperor and took the presents. He was now more eager than ever to be off. Taizong and a host of officials went by carriage to accompany him to the checkpoint. When they got there they found that the monks of the Hongfu Monastery and Xuanzang's own disciples were waiting outside with his summer and winter clothing. As soon as he saw this the Tang Emperor ordered that it be packed and horses be provided, then told an official to pour out some wine. Raising his cup he asked, “Brother, what is your courtesy name?” “As I am not of the world, I do not have one,” replied Xuanzang. “The Bodhisattva said yesterday that there are Three Stores (son zang) of scriptures in the Western Heaven. You, brother, should take a courtesy name from this. What about Sanzang?” Thanking the Emperor for his kindness, he accepted the cup of wine with the words, “ Your Majesty, liquor is the first of the things from which a monk must abstain, and so I have never drunk it.” “Today's journey is exceptional,” Taizong replied, “and besides, this is a nonalcoholic wine, so you should drink this cup and let us feel that we have seen you off properly.” Unable to refuse any longer, Sanzang took the wine, and was on the point of drinking it when he saw Taizong bend down, take a pinch of dust in his fingers, and flick it into his cup."
却说太宗自服了安神定魄之剂，连进了数次粥汤，被众臣扶入寝室，一夜稳睡，保养精神，直至天明方起，抖擞威仪，你看他怎生打扮；戴一顶冲天冠，穿一领赭黄袍。系一条蓝田碧玉带，踏一对创业无忧履。貌堂堂，赛过当朝；威烈烈，重兴今日。好一个清平有道的大唐王，起死回生的李陛下！唐王上金銮宝殿，聚集两班文武，山呼已毕，依品分班。只听得传旨道：,"However, it is said that Taizong took the medicine for calming the mind and the soul, and even entered the porridge and soup several times, was helped by the officials into the bedroom, slept steadily all night, and maintained his spirit until the dawn of the day, full of majesty, you can see how he dressed up; Dai Yi The top is crowned to the sky, and he wears an ochre-yellow robe. Tie a Lantian jasper belt, and step on a pair of entrepreneurship and worry-free shoes. Majestic, better than the current dynasty; Wei Lie, rejuvenated today. What a peaceful and dignified King of Tang, and His Majesty Li who came back to life! The King of Tang went to the Golden Palace and gathered two classes of civil and military officials. Only hear the preaching:","We now tell you about Taizong, who, having received the medicine prescribed for calming his spirit and fortifying his soul, and having taken the rice broth several times, was carried into his bedchamber by his attendants. He slept soundly that whole night, and when he arose at dawn, his spirit was fully revived. Look how he was attired: He donned a tall, royal cap; He wore a dark ocher robe; He put on a belt of green jade from Blue Mountain; He trod a pair of empire-building carefree boots. His stunning looks Surpassed anyone in court: With power to spare He resumed his reign. What a great Tang emperor of justice and truth, The Majestic Li who rose again from the dead! The Tang emperor went up to the Treasure Hall of the Golden Carriage and gathered together the two groups of civil and military officials, who, after shouting “Long live the emperor” three times, stood in attention according to rank and file. Then they heard this loud announcement: “If there is any business, come forth and make your memorial; if there is no business, you are dismissed from court.”","But it grows like its father in the womb, And like the Ancient of Days in Heaven. The earthly must be lost before one gains the heavenly, Truly salvation comes from a higher realm. The question then arose, how to restore the true king to his kingdom, and how to punish the demon. When he was just about to kill the demon, the bodhisattva Manjusri appeared and told the true history of both the king and the demon.","The next day the courtiers swapped their mourning clothes for their usual red, black, purple, and gold court outfits, and listened admiringly to the emperor—magnificent in a dark yellow robe—recount his time in the underworld.","As for Taizong, after taking the medicine to settle his spirit and calm his soul and drinking some thin gruel he was helped to his bedroom by his ministers. He slept soundly all night, building up his energies, and at dawn he rose. See how he was arrayed as he summoned up his authority: On his head a hat that thrust into the sky; On his body a dark yellow robe Girt with a belt of Lantian jade; On his feet a pair of Shoes of Success. The dignity of his bearing Surpasses all others at court. His awesome majesty Is today restored. What a peaceful and wise Great Tang Emperor, The king named Li who can die and rise again. The Tang Emperor entered the throne hall, and when the two groups of civil and military officials had finished acclaiming him they divided into sections according to their ranks. When they heard the decree, “Let all those with business step forward from their sections and submit memorials, and let those with no business retire,” Xu Maogong, Wei Zheng, Wang Gui, Du Ruhui, Fang Xuanling, Yuan Tiangang, Li Chunfeng, Xu Jingzong and others stepped forward on the Eastern side; and on the Western side Yin Kaishan, Liu Hongji, Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Cheng Yaojin, Qin Shubao, Yuchi Jingde, Xue Rengui and others stepped forward also."

盖闻天地之数，有十二万九千六百岁为一元。将一元分为十二会，乃子、丑、寅、卯、辰、巳、午、未、申、酉、戌、亥之十二支也。每会该一万八百岁。且就一日而论：子时得阳气，而丑则鸡鸣；寅不通光，而卯则日出；辰时食后，而巳则挨排；日午天中，而未则西蹉；申时晡而日落酉；戌黄昏而人定亥。譬于大数，若到戌会之终，则天地昏蒙而万物否矣。再去五千四百岁，交亥会之初，则当黑暗，而两间人物俱无矣，故曰混沌。又五千四百岁，亥会将终，贞下起元，近子之会，而复逐渐开明。邵康节曰：“冬至子之半，天心无改移。一阳初动处，万物未生时。”到此，天始有根。再五千四百岁，正当子会，轻清上腾，有日，有月，有星，有辰。日、月、星、辰，谓之四象。故曰，天开于子。又经五千四百岁，子会将终，近丑之会，而逐渐坚实。易曰：“大哉乾元！至哉坤元！万物资生，乃顺承天。”至此，地始凝结。再五千四百岁，正当丑会，重浊下凝，有水，有火，有山，有石，有土。水、火、山、石、土谓之五形。故曰，地辟于丑。又经五千四百岁，丑会终而寅会之初，发生万物。历曰：“天气下降，地气上升；天地交合，群物皆生。”至此，天清地爽，阴阳交合。再五千四百岁，正当寅会，生人，生兽，生禽，正谓天地人，三才定位。故曰，人生于寅。,"It is known that the number of heaven and earth is 129,600 years old. Divide the Yuan into twelve branches, which are the twelve branches of Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, and Hai. Every meeting should be eighteen hundred years old. And in terms of one day: when the child is yang, the cock crows when the ugly is; when the yin is not clear, the sun rises at the mao; when the chen is after eating, the si is in a row; the sun is noon and the sky is in the middle of the day, but the west is awake; When Shen is noon, the sun goes down; when it is dusk, people settle down. For example, in the case of large numbers, if the meeting of Xu reaches the end, the heaven and the earth will be dimmed and all things will cease to exist. Five thousand four hundred years later, at the beginning of the Jiaohai Meeting, it will be dark, and there will be no characters in the two rooms, so it is called chaos. Five thousand and four hundred years old, the Haihui will end, Zhenxia will start the Yuan, and the Zizhihui will be approached, and gradually enlightened. Shao Kangjie said: ""Half of the child in the winter solstice, the heart of the sky has not changed. When the sun first moves, when all things are not born."" At this point, the beginning of the sky has its roots. Five thousand and four hundred years old, when Zihui, Qingqing ascends, there will be sun, moon, stars, and chen. The sun, the moon, the stars, and the chen are called the four signs. Therefore, it is said that the heaven is opened by the son. After another 5,400 years, Zihui will end, approaching the ugly meeting, and gradually become solid. Yi said: ""Great is the Qianyuan! It is the Kunyuan! The living beings of all things follow the sky."" At this point, the ground began to congeal. Another five thousand and four hundred years old, when the ugliness will meet, the heavy turbidity will congeal, and there will be water, fire, mountains, rocks, and soil. Water, fire, mountain, stone and earth are called the five forms. Therefore, it is said that the earth is created by ugliness. After another five thousand four hundred years, the ugly will end and the Yin will be the beginning, and all things will happen. The calendar says: ""When the weather falls, the qi of the earth rises; when the heaven and the earth meet, all things are born."" At this point, the sky is clear and the earth is cool, and the yin and yang meet. Five thousand and four hundred years old, when the Yin Hui is born, people, animals, and birds are born. Therefore, it is said that life is born in Yin.","We heard that, in the order of Heaven and Earth, a single period consisted of 129,600 years. Dividing this period into twelve epochs were the twelve stems of Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, Yu, Xu, and Hai, with each epoch having 10,800 years. Considered as the horary circle, the sequence would be thus: the first sign of dawn appears in the hour of Zi, while at Chou the cock crows; daybreak occurs at Yin, and the sun rises at Mao; Chen comes after breakfast, and by Si everything is planned; at Wu the sun arrives at its meridian, and it declines westward by Wei; the evening meal comes during the hour of Shen, and the sun sinks completely at Yu; twilight sets in at Xu, and people rest by the hour of Hai. This sequence may also be understood macrocosmically. At the end of the epoch of Xu, Heaven and Earth were obscure and all things were indistinct. With the passing of 5,400 years, the beginning of Hai was the epoch of darkness. This moment was named Chaos, because there were neither human beings nor the two spheres. After another 5,400 years Hai ended, and as the creative force began to work after great perseverance, the epoch of Zi drew near and again brought gradual development. Shao Kangjie3 said: When to the middle of Zi winter moved, No change by Heaven’s mind had been approved. The male principle had but barely stirred, But the birth of all things was still deferred. At this point, the firmament first acquired its foundation. With another 5,400 years came the Zi epoch; the ethereal and the light rose up to form the four phenomena of the sun, the moon, the stars, and the Heavenly bodies. Hence it is said, the Heaven was created at Zi. This epoch came to its end in another 5,400 years, and the sky began to harden as the Chou epoch approached. The Classic of Change said: Great was the male principle; Supreme, the female! They made all things, In obedience to Heaven. At this point, the Earth became solidified. In another 5,400 years after the arrival of the Chou epoch, the heavy and the turbid condensed below and formed the five elements of water, fire, mountain, stone, and earth. Hence it is said, the Earth was created at Chou. With the passing of another 5,400 years, the Chou epoch came to its end and all things began to grow at the beginning of the Yin epoch. The Book of Calendar said: The Heavenly aura descended; The earthly aura rose up. Heaven and Earth copulated, And all things were born. At this point, Heaven and Earth were bright and fair; the yin had intercourse with the yang. In another 5,400 years, during the Yin epoch, humans, beasts, and fowls came into being, and thus the so-called three forces of Heaven, Earth, and Man were established. Hence it is said, man was born at Yin.","WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE AGE OF THE WORLD is 129,600 years for one kalpa, that these kalpas are divided into 12 periods, just as the day and night are divided into 12 Chinese hours, and each period is 10,800 years, or two half periods of 5,400 each. Speaking of the divisions in a day, there are twelve of 2 hours each, from midnight to midnight. But if we speak of the division of the kalpas, at the end of each there is a return to chaos and darkness. After the first period of 5,400 years, everything should be dark like night without any living thing. This state is called chaos. After the second period of 5,400 years comes the era which gradually begins to open up with light. Hence the saying, “The winter solstice is the re-beginning.” But Nature never changes. Everything is dead. Soon after, life again begins. After a third period of 5,400 years, the lighter parts of matter rise up, forming the sun and moon and stars. Towards the end of a fourth period of 5,400 years, the solid parts combine. The Book of Changes says, “How great is Heaven , how perfect is the Earth producing all things. The Earth henceforth becomes solid.” After a fifth period of 5,400 years more, all the solids resolve into water and fire, into mountains, rocks, and earth. After a sixth period of 5,400 years, at the end of another kalpa, all things are reproduced again. Heavenly influences descend and earthly influences rise, and by the union of the two, all living things are produced. After the seventh period of 5,400 years, men and birds and beasts are produced. Thus we have the three great powers, Heaven, Earth, and Man.",,"In the arithmetic of the universe, 129,600 years make one cycle. Each cycle can be divided into twelve phases: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII, the twelve branches. Each phase lasts 10,800 years. Now within a single day, the positive begins at the time I; at II the cock crows; at III it is not quite light; at IV the sun rises; V is after breakfast; and at VI one does business. VII is when the sun reaches noon; at VIII it is slipping towards the West; IX is late afternoon; the sun sets at X; XI is dusk; and at XII people settle down for the night. If you compare this with the big numbers, then at the end of Phase XI Heaven and Earth were still one, and no beings had appeared. 5,400 years later came the beginning of Phase XII, when all was darkness and there were still no people or other creatures; for this reason it was called Chaos. Another 5,400 years later Phase XII was drawing to a close and a new cycle was about to begin. As Phase I of the new era approached, gradually there was light. As Shao Yong said, “When winter reaches the mid-point of Phase I The heart of Heaven does not move. Where the Positive first appears Nothing has yet come to life.” At this time, Heaven first had a foundation. 5,400 years later, in the middle of Phase I, the light and pure rose upwards, and sun, moon, stars, and constellations were created. These were called the Four Images. Hence the saying that heaven began in I. Another 5,400 years later, when Phase I was nearing its end and Phase II was imminent, things gradually solidified. As the Book of Changes says, “Great is the Positive; far-reaching is the Negative! All things are endowed and born in accordance with Heaven.” This was when the earth began to congeal. After 5,400 more years came the height of Phase II, when the heavy and impure solidified, and water, fire, mountains, stone, and Earth came into being. These five were called the Five Movers. Therefore it is said that the Earth was created in Phase II. After a further 5,400 years, at the end of Phase II and the beginning of the Phase III, living beings were created. In the words of the Book of the Calendar, ”The essence of the sky came down and the essence of earth went up. Heaven and Earth intermingled, and all creatures were born.” Then Heaven was bright and Earth was fresh, and the Positive intermingled with the Negative. 5,400 years later, when Phase III was at its height, men, birds and beasts were created. Thus the Three Powers—Heaven, Earth and Man—now had their set places. Therefore it is said that man was created in Phase III."

Standing on the tip of a cloud and facing the wind, he gently flipped open the wide sleeve of his gown and sent it toward the earth in a sweeping motion. All four of the monks and the horse were at once scooped up into the sleeve. “This is dreadful!” said Eight Rules. “We have been placed in a clothes bag!” “It isn’t a clothes bag, Idiot!” said Pilgrim. “We’ve been scooped up into his sleeve.” “In that case,” said Eight Rules, “it shouldn’t be too difficult! Let me use my rake and make a hole in his gown. When we make our escape, we can claim that he was careless and didn’t hold us securely, so that we fell out of his sleeve.” Idiot started to dig into the garment madly with his rake, but all to no avail: although the material was soft to the touch, it was harder than steel when it came into contact with the rake.",,"I told them they’d undersold themselves and that they’d as good as given away the family fortune. So this time around, when you refused to come up with the goods, they gave you blank scrolls. Actually, these blank scrolls are just as good and true as written ones. But seeing as you creatures from the east are too dim to see it , I suppose I’d better give you the ones with writing on them.” He now turned once more to the original two attendants. “Select for them a few written scrolls.” Back the attendants and disciples went to the pavilion; again, the former demanded a “gift.” This time Tripitaka asked Sandy to dig out the purple-gold alms bowl, which he then presented with both hands. “Due to our poverty and the length of our journey, we were unable to prepare any presents. But please accept as a token of our gratitude this alms bowl that the Tang emperor gave us to beg for food along the way. When we return to the Tang court with the true teachings, the emperor will be sure to reward you richly. Only this time, do give us the written versions.” One of the attendants smiled gently and took the bowl. The various orderlies in the pavilion began sniggering and nudging one another: “Outrageous! Imagine asking scripture seekers for a bribe!”","A pair of turned-up sandals on his feet, And round his waist a belt of silk. His body was like a child's, His face was that of a beautiful woman. A wispy beard floated down from his chin, And the hair on his temples was crow-black. He met Monkey unarmed With only a jade-handled whisk in his hands. Monkey struck wildly at him with his club, only to be parried to left and right by the Great Immortal's whisk. After two or three rounds the Great Immortal did a “Wrapping Heaven and Earth in His Sleeve” trick, waving his sleeve gently in the breeze as he stood amid the clouds, then sweeping it across the ground and gathering up the four pilgrims and their horse in it. “Hell,” said Pig, “We're all caught in a bag.” “It isn't a bag, you idiot,” said Monkey, “he's caught us all in his sleeve.” “It doesn't matter, anyhow,” said Pig. “I can make a hole in it with a single blow of my rake that we can all get through. Then we'll be able to drop out when he relaxes his grip on us.” But however desperately he struck at the fabric he could make no impression on it: although it was soft when held in the hand it was harder than iron when hit."
李定道：“你的水秀，不如我的山青。也有个《蝶恋花》词为证，词曰：云林一段松花满，默听莺啼，巧舌如调管。红瘦绿肥春正暖，倏然夏至光阴转。又值秋来容易换，黄花香，堪供玩。迅速严冬如指拈，逍遥四季无人管。”渔翁道：“你山青不如我水秀，受用些好物，有一《鹧鸪天》为证，仙乡云水足生涯，摆橹横舟便是家。活剖鲜鳞烹绿鳖，旋蒸紫蟹煮红虾。青芦笋，水荇芽，菱角鸡头更可夸。娇藕老莲芹叶嫩，慈菇茭白鸟英花。”樵夫道：“你水秀不如我山青，受用些好物，亦有一《鹧鸪天》为证：,"Li Ding said: ""Your water beauty is not as good as my mountain green. There is also a poem ""Butterfly Loves Flowers"" as proof. It’s warm, and the summer solstice turns. It’s easy to change in autumn, and the yellow flowers are fragrant, which is good for play. The fast and severe winter is like a finger, and the four seasons are unattended.” The fisherman said: “Your mountains are not as beautiful as my water, and you can use some good things. There is a ""Partridge Heaven"" as a proof, Xianxiang Yunshui is full of life, and the scull is home. The fresh scales are cut and the green turtle is cooked, and the purple crab is steamed and the red shrimp is cooked. Green asparagus, water chestnut sprouts, water chestnut chicken head It is even more praiseworthy. The tender lotus and old lotus celery leaves are tender, and the mushrooms, water chestnuts, white birds and beautiful flowers."" The woodcutter said: ""You are not as beautiful as my mountains, and you can use some good things. There is also a ""Partridge Heaven"" as proof:","Li Ding said, “Your fair waters are not as good as my blue mountains. I also have as testimony a lyric poem to the tune of ‘Butterflies Enamored of Flowers’ that says: At a dense forest’s pine-seeded corner I hear, wordless, the oriole— Its deft tongue’s a tuneful pipe. Pale reds and bright greens announce the warmth of spring; Summer comes abruptly; so passes time. Then autumn arrives (for it’s an easy change) With fragrant golden flowers Most worthy of our joy; And cold winter descends, swift as a finger snaps. Ruled by no one, I’m free in all four climes.” The fisherman said, “Your blue mountains are not as good as my fair waters, which offer me some fine things to enjoy. As testimony I have here a lyric to the tune of ‘The Partridge Sky’”: The fairy land cloud and water do suffice: Boat adrift, oars accumbent—this is my home. I split fishes live and cook green turtles; I steam purple crabs and boil red shrimps. Green reed-shoots, Water-plant sprouts; Better still the ‘chicken heads,’3 the walter caltrops, Lotus roots, old or young, the tender celery leaves, Arrowheads, white caltrops, and niaoying flowers.” The woodman said, “Your fair waters are not as good as my blue mountains, which offer me some fine things to enjoy. As testimony I too have a lyric to the tune of ‘The Partridge Sky’:","But I met a spirit, who showed me the way of the immortals. He bade me repent and leave the common way of men, and make myself familiar with the way to heaven above, and hell beneath. I received the Pill of Nine Transformations and studied all the arts by which man could be united to the Powers and Forces above and below, till at last I was able to fly with a light but strong body, and was a guest in the Celestial Court, where I freely mixed with all at the peach banquet. But getting drunk, I made love to some of the fairies, and was expelled back to earth, but by some mistake in transmigration, I got into the womb of a sow instead of that of a woman. That is why I am called Zhu the Pig.” “Oh, you are one of the water fairies sent down to live among men?” “Yes, and you are that terrible monkey, who made such disturbance, and got us all into trouble in Heaven!” They fought again and Sun was victorious, cursing him for daring to marry a good girl. Then the demon asked if the father had sent for him. Sun replied, “No, I and my Master were passing by on our way to fetch the Sacred Scriptures of the West, and he asked us to save his daughter.” On hearing they were in search of the Sacred Scriptures, the demon at once fell on his knees. “I have been waiting for this pilgrim for many years.",One would praise seagulls and crabs; the other craggy peaks and mountain tea.,"“Your clear waters are no match for my blue hills,” said Li Ding, “and there is another lyric to the same tune to prove it. It goes: The cloudy woods are covered with pine blossom. Hush! Hear the oriole sing, As if it played a pipe with its cunning tongue. With touches of red and ample green the spring is warm; Suddenly the summer's here as the seasons turn. “When autumn comes the look of things is changed; The scented chrysanthemum Is enough for my pleasure. Soon the cruel winter plucks all off. I am free through four seasons, at nobody's beck and call.” “You don't enjoy the good things in your blue hills that I do on my clear waters,” replied the fisherman, “and I can prove it with another lyric to the tune of The Partridge Heaven: In this magic land we live off the cloudy waters; With a sweep of the oar the boat becomes a home. We cut open the live fish and fry the green turtle As steam coils from the purple crab and the red shrimps bubble. Green reed shoots, Sprouts of water-lilies, Better still, water chestnuts and the gorgon fruit, Delicate louts roots and seeds, tender celery, Arrowhead, reed-hearts and bird-glory blossom.” “Your clear waters cannot compare with my blue hills when it comes to the good things they provide,” said the woodcutter, and I can cite another lyric to the tuneThe Partridge Heaven as evidence: Mighty crags and towering peaks reach to the sky;"

铜蛇铁狗任争餐，永堕奈河无出路。诗曰：时闻鬼哭与神号，血水浑波万丈高。无数牛头并马面，狰狞把守奈河桥。”正说间，那几个桥梁使者，早已回去了。太宗心又惊惶，点头暗叹，默默悲伤，相随着判官、太尉，早过了奈河恶水，血盆苦界。前又到枉死城，只听哄哄人嚷，分明说“李世民来了！李世民来了！”太宗听叫，心惊胆战。见一伙拖腰折臂、有足无头的鬼魅，上前拦住，都叫道：还我命来！还我命来！”慌得那太宗藏藏躲躲，只叫“崔先生救我！崔先生救我！”判官道：陛下，那些人都是那六十四处烟尘，七十二处草寇，众王子、众头目的鬼魂；尽是枉死的冤业，无收无管，不得超生，又无钱钞盘缠，都是孤寒饿鬼。陛下得些钱钞与他，我才救得哩。”太宗道：“寡人空身到此，却那里得有钱钞？”判官道：“陛下，阳间有一人，金银若干，在我这阴司里寄放。陛下可出名立一约，小判可作保，且借他一库，给散这些饿鬼，方得过去。”太宗问曰：“此人是谁？”判官道：“他是河南开封府人氏，姓相名良，他有十三库金银在此。陛下若借用过他的，到阳间还他便了。”太宗甚喜，情愿出名借用。遂立了文书与判官，借他金银一库，着太尉尽行给散。判官复吩咐道：“这些金银，汝等可均分用度，放你大唐爷爷过去，他的阳寿还早哩。我领了十王钧语，送他还魂，教他到阳间做一个水陆大会，度汝等超生，再休生事。”众鬼闻言，得了金银，俱唯唯而退。判官令太尉摇动引魂幡，领太宗出离了枉死城中，奔上平阳大路，飘飘荡荡而去。毕竟不知从那条路出身，且听下回分解。,"The copper snake and the iron dog are fighting for meals, and they will fall into the Naihe River forever without a way out. The poem says: When I hear ghosts crying and god's horns, the blood and water are turbulent. Numerous bull heads and horse faces are fiercely guarding the Naihe Bridge. ""While he was talking, those bridge messengers had already returned. Taizong was startled again, nodded and sighed, silently sad, following the judges and Taiweis, he passed the bad waters of the Naihe River long ago, and he was in a world of misery. Cheng, only to hear the cacophony, clearly saying, ""Li Shimin is here! Li Shimin is here! ""Tai Zong heard the call, and his heart trembled. Seeing a group of ghosts with legs and no heads, they stepped forward to stop them, and they all shouted: Give me my life! Give me my life!"" Called ""Mr. Cui save me! Mr. Cui save me!"" The judge said: ""Your Majesty, those people are the ghosts of the sixty-four smoke and dust, the seventy-two grass bandits, the princes and the leaders; No income, no control, no superbirth, and no money and money, all of them are lonely and hungry ghosts. Your Majesty has some money with him, and I can save you. Taizong said, ""The widow came here empty-handed, but there must be money there?"" ""The judge said: ""Your Majesty, there is a person in the yang world, and some gold and silver are stored in my yin department. Your Majesty can make a contract with a name, and a small sentence can be guaranteed, and borrow him a treasury to disperse these hungry ghosts, so that they can pass. Taizong asked, ""Who is this person? The judge said: ""He is from Kaifeng Prefecture, Henan, with a surname and a good name, and he has thirteen treasuries of gold and silver here. If His Majesty has borrowed from him, he will return it to the world. Taizong was very happy, and would rather be famous and borrowed. He set up a document and a judge, lent him a treasury of gold and silver, and sent it to the captain to disperse it. Your grandfather Tang went over, his birthday is still early. I took the ten kings of Junyu, sent him back to life, and taught him to go to the earth to do a land and water conference, save you and others, and then take a break from life. ""When the ghosts heard the words, they got gold and silver, and they all retreated. The judge ordered the captain to shake the spirit flag and lead Taizong out of the city of death. He ran to Pingyang Road and drifted away. After all, he didn't know where he came from. , and listen to the next decomposition.","Iron dogs and brass serpents will strive to feed on them. Their fall’s eternal—there is no way out.” The poem says: Ghosts are heard wailing; demons often cry As waves of blood rise ten thousand feet high. Horse-faces and Bull-heads by countless scores This No-Option Bridge grimly fortify. While Taizong and his guides were speaking, the several Guardians of the Bridge went back to their station. Terrified by his vision, Taizong could only nod his head in silent horror. He followed the judge and the grand marshal across the malicious water of the No-Option River and the bitter Realm of the Bloody Bowl. Soon they arrived at the City of the Dead, where clamoring voices were heard proclaiming distinctly, “Li Shimin has come! Li Shimin has come!” When Taizong heard all this shouting, his heart shook and his gall quivered. Then he saw a throng of spirits, some with backs broken by the rack, some with severed limbs, and some headless, who barred his way and shouted together, “Give us back our lives! Give us back our lives!” In terror Taizong tried desperately to flee and hide, at the same time crying, “Mr. Cui, save me! Mr. Cui, save me!” “Your Majesty,” said the judge, “these are the spirits of various princes and their underlings, of brigands and robbers from sundry places. Through works of injustice, both theirs and others’, they perished and are now cut off from salvation because there is none to receive them or care for them. Since they have no money or belongings, they are ghosts abandoned to hunger and cold. Only if Your Majesty can give them some money will I be able to offer you deliverance.” “I came here,” said Taizong, “with empty hands. Where can I get money?” “Your Majesty,” said the judge, “there is in the World of the Living a man who has deposited great sums of gold and silver in our Region of Darkness. You can use your name for a loan, and your lowly judge will serve as your voucher; we shall borrow a roomful of money from him and distribute it among the hungry ghosts. You will then be able to get past them.” “Who is this man?” asked Taizong. “He’s a man from the Kaifeng District in Henan Province,” said the judge. “His given name is Liang and his surname is Xiang. He has thirteen rooms of gold and silver down here. If Your Majesty borrows from him, you can repay him when you return to the World of Light.” Highly pleased and more than willing to use his name for the loan, Taizong at once signed a note for the judge. He borrowed a roomful of gold and silver, and the grand marshal was asked to distribute the money among the ghosts. The judge also instructed them, saying, “You may divide up these pieces of silver and gold among yourselves and use them accordingly. Let the Great Tang Father pass, for he still has a long time to live. By the solemn word of the Ten Kings I am accompanying him to return to life. When he reaches the world of the living, he has been instructed to hold a Grand Mass of Land and Water for your salvation.10 So don’t start any more trouble.” When the ghosts heard these words and received the silver and gold, they obeyed and turned back. The judge ordered the grand marshal to wave the flag for guiding souls, and led Taizong out of the City of the Dead. They set out again on a broad and level path, leaving quickly with light, airy steps.","Bring out your five hundred priests, properly dressed, and give a proper welcome to my Master, or I shall beat you still more.” After this the abbot beat the great drum and rang the great bell, and the monks came running, and wondering what was the matter. When they were arranged in order, they fell on their knees, and welcomed the Master suitably. After supper, the Master dismissed all except Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie and Sha the Monk. He took them out with him and said, “Look at that wonderful moonlight. It makes me long for the time when I can return to my dear old home.” The Monkey, on hearing this, said to the Master, “You enjoy the beautiful light and long for home. You do not think of the Great Purpose before the Sun and Moon were created, and how they are made to revolve from month to month without fail. This is a mystery. One thing is clear, what is not born is immortal.” The Master said, “My disciples, you are all tired, go to sleep while I read a chapter of my Sacred Scriptures.” The Monkey said, “Are you not now traveling so far to get the Sacred Scriptures? How come you can read them now?” The Master said, “Oh, just sometimes I read over my old books, lest I forget them.” That night, the Master had a strange dream, in which the spirit of the King of Kashghar appeared to him and told his history. During a long drought he was deceived by a demon who slew him, and threw him into a well in the palace garden, where he had remained for three years, after which the demon had assumed his form and usurped his throne and deceived everyone. He begged the Master to allow his disciple Sun to rescue him. In proof of the truth of his story, be left behind a bar of white jade. The Master told his dream to the Monkey, who thought there must be some truth in it, and departed to seek the palace. The Master then chanted: Religions vestments we need not heed,","The river’s depths are populated by fiends hungry for humans—including a breed of iron dogs and brass serpents with a particular yen for women who bad-mouth their in-laws.” Taizong was, once more, speechless with terror. Presently, Taizong and his guides reached the City of the Dead, where a crowd of broken ghosts—some with severed limbs, some headless, some with their backs snapped by the rack—clamored around Taizong: “Save us!” He tried to hide behind Cui Jue. “These are the impoverished hungry ghosts of miscellaneous princes and gangsters,” the judge explained, “who led wicked lives and currently have no hope of reincarnation because no one looks after their memory on earth. I can get you past them only if you give them some money.” “But you see that I came empty-handed,” objected Taizong. “A man in your world, Liang Xiang from Kaifeng in Henan, has deposited thirteen vaults of gold and silver in Hell. If you tell the infernal bankers who you are and I vouch for you, they’re sure to advance you a loan, which we can give to the hungry ghosts.” Taizong promptly signed a chit, borrowed a roomful of gold and silver, and distributed it among the ghosts. “Let the emperor through,” instructed Cui Jue. “When he returns to the world of the living, he’ll hold a grand mass to enable your souls to be reborn.","Copper snakes and iron dogs feast on them at will, As they constantly fall in the river, never to escape. There is a poem that goes: As ghosts wail and spirits howl The waves of blood tower high. Countless ghouls with heads of bulls and horses Guard the bridge with great ferocity. The commissioners of the bridges had gone away while he was speaking. Taizong's heart was once more filled with horror, and he nodded his head and sighed silently in his distress, then followed the judge and the Marshal. Before long they crossed the evil River of Punishment and passed the terrors of the Bowl of Blood. Then they came to the City of the Unjustly Slain. Amid the hubbub, shouts of “Li Shimin's here, Li Shimin's here,” could be made out, to the terror of Taizong. He saw that his way was blocked by a crowd of maimed and headless spectres. “Give us back our lives,” they were all shouting, “give us back our lives.” The panic-stricken Taizong tried to hide, yelling, “Help, Judge Cui, help, help.” “Your Majesty,” the judge replied, “these are the ghosts of the kings and chieftains of the sixty-four groups of rebels and the seventy-two troops of bandits. They were all killed unjustly, and nobody has given them a home or looked after them. They cannot get themselves reborn as they have no money for the journey, so they are all uncared-for cold and hungry ghosts. If Your Majesty is able to give them some money I can save you.” “I came here empty-handed,” Taizong replied, “so where could I possibly get any money?” “Your Majesty,” the judge replied, “there is a man in the world of light who deposited a certain amount of money in the underworld. If Your Majesty is prepared to sign an I.O.U., I will endorse it, and we can borrow his store of money to distribute among these hungry ghosts; then we will be able to continue on our way,” “Who is this man?” asked Taizong. “He is a man of Kaifeng in Henan,” the judge replied, “and his name is Xiang Liang. He has thirteen hoards of gold and silver down here, and if Your Majesty borrows them, all you have to do is repay them when you return to the world of light.” Taizong was very pleased, and only too eager to borrow one. He signed an I.O.U. at once and gave it to the judge, then borrowed a store, which he gave to the marshal to hand out. “You are to share out this gold and silver and let your Lord of the Great Tang past,” said the judge. “As it is too early in his life, I am under orders from the ten kings to return his soul and tell him to hold a Great Mass when he is back in the world of light to enable all of you to be reborn, so don't be making any more trouble.” When the ghosts heard what he had to say and were given the gold and silver they all withdrew, murmuring their obedient assent. The judge then told the marshal to wave his soul-leading flag, and Taizong was taken out of the City of the Unjustly Slain and floated along the highway to the daylight."
“呆子，不要者嚣，你那口里娘也不知叫了多少，又是甚么弄不成？快快的应成，带携我们吃些喜酒，也是好处。”他一只手揪着八戒，一只手扯住妇人道：“亲家母，带你女婿进去。”那呆子脚儿趄趄的要往那里走，那妇人即唤童子：“展抹桌椅，铺排晚斋，管待三位亲家。我领姑夫房里去也。”一壁厢又吩咐庖丁排筵设宴，明晨会亲，那几个童子，又领命讫。他三众吃了斋，急急铺铺，都在客座里安歇不题。,"""Idiot, you don't want to be arrogant.

The idiot was about to go there, and the woman called the boy: ""Show the tables and chairs, arrange the evening fast, and take care of the three of them. My in-laws. I'll take my uncle to the room."" In the next room, he instructed the cooks to arrange a banquet, and they would kiss them in the morning, and the boys took their orders again. The three of them ate fast and hurried to shop, and they all rested in the guest seat.","“Stop this fakery! You have addressed her as ‘Mama’ for countless times already! What do you mean by ‘nothing doing’? Agree to this at once, so that we may have the pleasure of enjoying some wine at the wedding.” He caught hold of Eight Rules with one hand and pulled at the woman with the other, saying, “Mother-in-law, take your son-in-law inside.” Somewhat hesitantly, Idiot started to shuffle inside, while the woman gave instructions to a houseboy, saying, “Take out some tables and chairs and wipe them clean. Prepare a vegetarian dinner to serve these three relatives of ours. I’m leading our new master inside.” She further gave instructions for the cook to begin preparation for a wedding banquet to be held the next morning. The houseboys then left to tell the cook. After the three pilgrims had eaten their meal, they retired to the guest rooms, and we shall say no more of them for the moment.",,"“So where’s the real fan?” asked Monkey. “Still safe and sound in my possession.” The maids now brought in some wine. “Do drink up, my precious persimmon,” Monkey cajoled her. “Thank you for looking after our home while I’ve been gone.” “Please don’t mention it,” replied Iron-Fan, refilling the cup. After a few more rounds, Iron-Fan had been thoroughly disinhibited by drink. She edged closer to Monkey: she held his hand, rubbed his shoulder, whispered sweet nothings in his ear, flushed peach-pink, and undid her top buttons. They drank from the same cup; they ate fruit from each other’s mouths.","“Stop trying to cover up, blockhead,” said Monkey. “You've already called her 'mother' umpteen times: there's nothing impossible about it at all. Hurry up and fulfil your promise so that we can have some wedding wine, which will be one good thing about it.” Seizing Pig with one hand and grabbing the woman with the other he said, “As the bride's mother, you should take your son-in-law inside.” The idiot Pig hesitated, wanting to go in, and the woman said to the servants, “Bring table and chairs and give these three relatives of ours a meatless supper. I'm taking our son-in-law inside.” Then she told the cooks to prepare a banquet for their friends and relations the following morning. The servants did as they were told, and the other three pilgrims ate their supper, spread their bedding, and went to sleep in their places."

Wukong said, ""Master said to everyone in front of the altar yesterday, and when he was teaching his disciples at the third watch, he passed on my teachings from the back door, so he boldly went to the master's bed. When the ancestor heard that, he was very happy, and he thought to himself: ""This fellow is indeed born from heaven and earth!"" Otherwise, why break the dark mystery in my plate? Wukong said: ""There are no six ears here, there is only one disciple, I hope that Master will show mercy and teach me the way of longevity, and never forget my gratitude!"" The Patriarch said: ""You are destined now, and I am also happy to say. Now that you know the secret mystery in the plate, you should come and listen carefully, and you should pass on the wonderful way of longevity. Wukong bowed his head and thanked him, washed his ears, and knelt down on the couch. The Patriarch said:","Without a perfect man’s transmiting a subtle rune, You’d have vain words, worn mouth, and tongue waxed dry!” “Master,” Wukong responded at once. “Your pupil has been kneeling here and waiting on you for a long time.” When the Patriarch heard Wukong’s voice, he rose and put on his clothes. “You mischievous monkey!” he exclaimed, sitting down cross-legged, “Why aren’t you sleeping in front? What are you doing back here at my place?” Wukong replied, “Before the platform and the congregation yesterday, the master gave the order that your pupil, at the hour of the third watch, should come here through the rear entrance in order that he might be instructed. I was therefore bold enough to come directly to the master’s bed.” When the Patriarch heard this, he was terribly pleased, thinking to himself, “ This fellow is indeed an offspring of Heaven and Earth. If not, how could he solve so readily the riddle in my pot!” “There is no third party here save your pupil,” Wukong said. “May the master be exceedingly merciful and impart to me the way of long life. I shall never forget this gracious favor.” “Since you have solved the riddle in the pot,” said the Patriarch, “it is an indication that you are destined to learn, and I am glad to teach you. Come closer and listen carefully. I will impart to you the wondrous way of long life.” Wukong kowtowed to express his gratitude, washed his ears, and listened most attentively, kneeling before the bed. The Patriarch said:","Your breath is spent, you preach in vain. At this the Monkey King said, “Since you signaled to me to come and get the secret of religion at this time, I have come here and have been kneeling to receive it for some time.” The Master thought, “What a rare creature I have in this monkey!” He said, “I will tell you this great secret.” To discover secret doctrine, perfect and profound, One must train the spirit’s nature, only this the art, This involves three primal forces, sex, mind, and spirit. Secret keep this no divulging, fatal to reveal, Preserve with care your body’s strength,","If you reveal magic to an imperfect being your words will be empty and your tongue dry! Monkey took this as his cue to speak: “I’m waiting.” Subodhi pulled on his clothes, then sat back down cross-legged. “Monkey! What are you doing here?” “You told me to come through the back door at the third watch, for a lesson in enlightenment.” “This chap truly is a child of heaven and earth,” Subodhi rejoiced to himself. “How else could he have unriddled me so easily?” “I have come alone,” Monkey went on, “in the hope that Master will teach me the Way of Immortality.” “This is your destiny,” Subodhi replied. “Come close and listen.” Monkey kowtowed his thanks, washed his ears out, and kneeled to hear Subodhi’s secret life-preserving precepts. Thus Monkey was blessed with understanding.","To teach miraculous spells to any but the Perfect Man, Is to tire the voice and dry the tongue in vain.” Sun Wukong said in reply, “Master, your disciple has been kneeling here for a long time.” When the Patriarch heard that it was Sun Wukong who was speaking he pulled some clothes on, sat up cross-legged, and shouted, “It's that monkey. Why have you come into my room instead of sleeping out in front?” “Master, you told me publicly in front of the altar yesterday that your disciple was to come in here through the back gate at the third watch as you were going to teach me the Way. That is why I made so bold as to come to pay my respects beside my master's bed.” The Patriarch was very pleased to hear this and said to himself, “This wretch was indeed born of Heaven and Earth. Otherwise he wouldn't have been able to understand my cryptic message.” Sun Wukong said, “There is no third pair of ears in this room; your disciple is the only other person here. I hope, master, that in your great mercy you will teach me the Way of Immortality. If you do, I'll always be grateful to you.” “You are predestined,” the Patriarch said, “so I shall be happy to tell you. Since you understood my cryptic message, come over here and listen carefully while I teach you the miraculous Way of Immortality.” Sun Wukong kowtowed with gratitude and knelt before the bed, listening with all his attention. The Patriarch said:"
行者道：“看看袈裟，有何差错？”三藏道：“你不曾理会得，古人有云，珍奇玩好之物，不可使见贪婪奸伪之人。倘若一经入目，必动其心；既动其心，必生其计。汝是个畏祸的，索之而必应其求可也；不然，则殒身灭命，皆起于此，事不小矣。”行者道：“放心放心！都在老孙身上！”你看他不由分说，急急的走了去，把个包袱解开，早有霞光迸迸，尚有两层油纸裹定，去了纸，取出袈裟！抖开时，红光满室，彩气盈庭。众僧见了，无一个不心欢口赞。真个好袈裟！上头有：千般巧妙明珠坠，万样稀奇佛宝攒。上下龙须铺彩绮，兜罗四面锦沿边。体挂魍魉从此灭，身披魑魅入黄泉。托化天仙亲手制，不是真僧不敢穿。,"The traveler said: ""Look at the cassock, what's wrong?"" Sanzang said: ""You didn't pay attention to it, the ancients said that there are rare and good things, and you can't make people who are greedy and treacherous. If you look at it, you will be moved. If you move your heart, you will have a plan. You are a person who is afraid of disaster, and you must respond to his request when you ask for it; otherwise, you will die and die. It all starts here, and the matter is not trivial."" The practitioner said: "" Don't worry! It's all on the old grandson!"" You can see that he couldn't help but hurriedly walked over and untied the bag, the rays of light were already shining, and there were still two layers of oil paper wrapped, went to the paper, and took out the cassock! When shaken, the red light fills the room, and the color is full of color. When the monks saw it, all of them cheered. What a nice cassock! On the top are: thousands of ingenious pearl pendants, thousands of rare Buddha treasures. The upper and lower dragons must be covered with colorful flowers, and there are brocades on all sides. The body-hanging sprite has since perished, and the spooky charm has entered the Yellow Spring. It was made by Tianxian by himself, not a real monk would not dare to wear it.","“Just a look at the cassock,” said Pilgrim, “how can that be a mistake?” “You haven’t considered this,” said Tripitaka. “As the ancients declared, ‘The rare object of art should not be exposed to the covetous and deceitful person.’ For once he sees it, he will be tempted; and once he is tempted, he will plot and scheme. If you are timid, you may end up yielding to his every demand; otherwise, injury and loss of life may result, and that’s no small matter.” “Relax! Relax!” said Pilgrim. “Old Monkey will assume all responsibility!” Look at him! He did not permit any further discussion! Darting away, he untied the bag, and brilliant rays at once came flashing through the two layers of oil-paper in which the garment was wrapped. He discarded the paper and took out the cassock. As he shook it loose, a crimson light flooded the room and glorious air filled the courtyard. When the various monks saw it, none could suppress the admiration in his heart and the praise on his lips. It was truly a magnificent cassock! It has hanging on it Sparkling pearls—marvelous in every way— And Buddha’s treasures in each aspect rare. Up and down spreads grapevine3 weave on gorgeous silk; On every side are hems of fine brocade. Put it on, and goblins will then be slain. Step in it, and demons will flee to Hell. It’s made by those hands of gods incarnate; He who’s not a true monk dares not wear it.",,"The first, Pigsy, has a long snout and tusks, a bristly head and fanlike ears. His belly is so vast it stirs up the wind when he walks. The second, Sandy, is twelve feet tall and three arm spans wide. He has a blue face, burning eyes, and a row of nails for teeth.” The king laughed. “Do you think I’m that easily scared? Call them in.” “I smell a banquet!” rejoiced Pigsy when the king’s invitation reached the posthouse. “Let’s fill our faces and head off tomorrow.” “We’ll see,” Sandy ruminated pessimistically. The two of them headed to court, fully armed, and made a perfunctory bow before the throne. “Ugly and rude!” muttered the assembled officials. “Why on earth aren’t they kowtowing?” “You can take us or leave us,” responded Pigsy, on hearing their murmurings. “We might not be much to look at, but we have our uses.”","“You don't understand,” Sanzang replied. “The ancients used to say, 'Don't let greedy and treacherous men see rare or amusing things.' If he lays his eyes on it, his mind will be disturbed, and if his mind is disturbed, he's bound to start scheming. If you were cautious, you would only have let him see it if he'd insisted; but as it is, this is no trifling matter, and may well be the end of us.” “Don't worry, don't worry,” said Brother Monkey, “I'll look after everything.” Watch as without another word of argument he rushes off and opens the bundle, which is already giving off a radiant glow. It still had two layers of oiled paper round it, and when he removed it to take out the cassock and shake it open the hall was bathed in red light and clouds of coloured vapours filled the courtyard. When the monks saw it their hearts were filled with delight and their mouths with praise. It really was a fine cassock. Hung with pearls of unrivalled quality, Studded with Buddhist treasures infinitely rare. Above and below a dragon beard sparkles, On grass-cloth edged with brocade. If it is worn, all demons are extinguished; When donned it sends all monsters down to hell. It was made by the hands of heavenly Immortals, And none but a true monk should dare put it on."
龙王辞别，出长安，回水府。大小水神接着，问曰：“大王访那卖卦的如何？”龙王道：“有，有，有！”但是一个掉嘴口讨春的先生。我问他几时下雨，他就说明日下雨；问他甚么时辰，甚么雨数，他就说辰时布云，已时发雷，午时下雨，未时雨足，得水三尺三寸零四十八点，我与他打了个赌赛；若果如他言，送他谢金五十两；如略差些，就打破他门面，赶他起身，不许在长安惑众。”众水族笑曰：“大王是八河都总管，司雨大龙神，有雨无雨，惟大王知之，他怎敢这等胡言？那卖卦的定是输了！定是输了！”,"The Dragon King said goodbye, left Chang'an, and returned to Shuifu. The water gods, big and small, then asked, ""How about your visit to that man who sells hexagrams?"" The Dragon King said, ""Yes, yes, yes!"" When I asked him when it rained, he said it would rain in the sun; when I asked him what time and how much it would rain, he said there were clouds at the hour, thunder at the hour, it rained at noon, and the rain was not enough, and the water was three feet, three inches and zero. At 48 o'clock, I had a bet with him; if he did what he said, I would give him fifty taels of gold; if it was a little worse, I would break his front and drive him to stand up, so as not to confuse the crowd in Chang'an. All the water tribes laughed and said, ""Your Majesty is the head of the Eight Rivers, the Great Dragon God of Rain, there is rain but no rain, but the Majesty knows about it, how can he dare to make such nonsense? The one who sells fortunes must lose! Must lose! ""","The Dragon King took leave and returned to his water residence. He was received by various aquatic deities, who asked, “How was the Great King’s visit to the soothsayer?” “Yes, yes, yes,” said the Dragon King, “there is indeed such a person, but he’s a garrulous fortune-teller. I asked him when it would rain, and he said tomorrow; I asked him again about the time and the amount, and he told me that clouds would gather at the hour of the Dragon, thunder would be heard at the hour of the Serpent, and that rain would come at the hour of the Horse and would reach its limit at the hour of the Sheep. Altogether there would be three feet, three inches, and forty-eight drops of water. I made a wager with him: if it is as he said, I’ll reward him with fifty taels of gold. If there is the slightest error, I’ll break down his shop and chase him away, so that he will not be permitted to seduce the multitude at Chang’an.” “The Great King is the supreme commander of the eight rivers,” said the water kin, laughing, “the great Dragon Deity in charge of rain. Whether there is going to be rain or not, only the Great King knows that. How dare he speak so foolishly? That soothsayer is sure to lose!”","I have eaten many a traveler. Witness these skulls around my neck. Today you afford me another meal. At this Zhu Bajie started to beat him. Sun Wukong went to help, but the demon rushed back into the water, while the Master watched them from a little height. After two other unsuccessful fights, failing to get the demon to come out of the water and fight on dry land, they went and told the Master of their difficulty. The Monkey said to Zhu Bajie, “Stay here with the Master, while I go to see Guanyin again.” He went and told his story that they had fought the demon three times without success.","The dragon king returned to his underwater palace and reported his doings to the various aquatic deities. “. . . and I told him, if he’s made the tiniest mistake, I’ll smash up his shop and drive him out of the city.” “Good one, Great King!” guffawed his relatives. “You’re the generalissimo of the water. Only you know how much rain there’s going to be. That fortune-teller’s going to be fried rice!”","The dragon king took his leave and went back to his watery palace from Chang'an. The greater and lesser water spirits greeted him with the question, “How did Your Majesty's visit to the soothsayer go?” “It was all right,” he replied, “but he was a smooth-tongued fortune-teller. When I asked him when it would rain, he said tomorrow. When I asked what time of day it would be and how much would fall, he said that at mid-morning the clouds would gather, late in the morning it would thunder, at noon it would start to rain, and early in the afternoon it would stop raining. He also said that 3 feet 3.48 inches of rain would fall. I made a wager with him that if his prediction turned out to be true, I'd give him fifty ounces of gold; but if he got it at all wrong, I'd smash up his shopfront id drive him out, so that he wouldn't be able to deceive the public any longer. The watery tribe laughed and said, “Your Majesty is the General Superintendent of the Eight Rivers and the Great Dragon God of the Rain, so only you can know whether there will be rain. How dare he talk such nonsense? That fortune-teller is bound to lose, absolutely bound to.”"
二人当时不敢停留，闯出天罗地网，驾起瑞霭祥云。须臾，径至通明殿下，见了四大天师，引至灵霄宝殿，呈上表章。惠岸又见菩萨施礼。菩萨道：“你打探的如何？”惠岸道：“始领命到花果山，叫开天罗地网门，见了父亲，道师父差命之意。父王道：‘昨日与那猴王战了一场，止捉得他虎豹狮象之类，更未捉他一个猴精。’正讲间，他又索战，是弟子使铁棍与他战经五六十合，不能取胜，败走回营。父亲因此差大力鬼王同弟子上界求助。”菩萨低头思忖。,"At that time, the two did not dare to stay, so they broke out of the net and drove up the auspicious clouds. After a short while, I went straight to His Highness Tongming, met the Four Heavenly Masters, and led him to the Hall of Lingxiao, where he presented the form. Hui'an saw the Bodhisattva salute again. The Bodhisattva said: ""How did you inquire?"" Hui'an said: ""He led the order to Huaguo Mountain, called the opening of Tianluodi's net gate, and met his father. The master said that he sent his order. The father said: 'Yesterday we fought with the monkey king. In one case, he only caught him tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, etc., let alone a monkey spirit."" During the lecture, he asked to fight again. Go back to the camp. Therefore, my father sent Dali Ghost King and his disciples to the upper realm for help."" The Bodhisattva lowered his head and thought.","Not daring to linger, the two of them crashed out of the cosmic nets and mounted the holy mist and hallowed cloud. In a moment they reached the Hall of Perfect Light and met the Four Celestial Masters, who led them into the Treasure Hall of Divine Mists to present their memorial. Hui’an also saluted the Bodhisattva, who asked him, “What have you found out about the situation?” “When I reached the Flower-Fruit Mountain by your order,” said Hui’an, “I opened the cosmic nets by my call. Seeing my father, I told him of my master’s intentions in sending me. Father King said, ‘We fought a battle yesterday with that Monkey King but managed to take from him only tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, and the like. We did not catch a single one of his monkey monsters.’ As we were talking, he again demanded battle. Your disciple used the iron rod to fight him for fifty or sixty rounds, but I could not prevail against him and returned to the camp defeated. Thus father had to send the demon king Mahābāli and your pupil to come here for help.” The Bodhisattva bowed her head and pondered.","The prince was alarmed at this and ordered a memorial to be written and sent to Heaven requesting help. He then sent one of the Great Guardians to accompany his son Mucha, bearing this memorial to Heaven. When Hui Yan met Guanyin, he told her the evil tidings that they had been beaten. The Jade Emperor opened the memorial and, seeing that it was a request for help, smiled and said, “What shall we do with this wild monkey?","Shaken by this latest setback, King Li dashed off a request to the Jade Emperor for reinforcements and sent Hui’an and another king back up to Heaven to deliver the message. An instant later, the two of them were in front of Guanyin and the Jade Emperor, who tore open the note asking for backup. “Ha!” the emperor snorted.","Not daring to waste a moment, the two messengers rushed out through the heaven-and-earth nets and mounted their propitious clouds. A moment later they arrived outside the Hall of Universal Brightness, where they greeted the Four Heavenly Teachers, who led them to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and handed up their memorial. Prince Moksa, or Huian, did homage to the Bodhisattva, who asked him what he had found out. “As you instructed me, I went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit,” reported Huian, “asked them to open the gates of the heaven-and-earth net, saw my father, and told him of the orders you had given me. His Majesty my father said that they fought against the Monkey King yesterday but did not capture a single monkey spirit—only tigers, leopards, lions, elephants and so on. While he was telling me this the Monkey King demanded battle again, so your disciple fought some fifty or sixty rounds against him with my iron staff, but I was no match for him. He beat me, and drove me back to the camp. This is why my father has sent me and the Strong-arm Devil King up to Heaven to ask for reinforcements.” The Bodhisattva lowered her head in deep thought."
“陛下宽心，臣有一事，管保陛下长生。”太宗道：“病势已入膏肓，命将危矣，如何保得？”征云：“臣有书一封，进与陛下，捎去到冥司，付酆都判官崔珪。”太宗道：“崔珪是谁？”征云：“崔珪乃是太上先皇帝驾前之臣，先受兹州令，后升礼部侍郎。在日与臣八拜为交，相知甚厚。他如今已死，现在阴司做掌生死文簿的酆都判官，梦中常与臣相会。此去若将此书付与他，他念微臣薄分，必然放陛下回来，管教魂魄还阳世，定取龙颜转帝都。”太宗闻言，接在手中，笼入袖里，遂瞑目而亡。那三宫六院、皇后嫔妃、侍长储君及两班文武，俱举哀戴孝，又在白虎殿上，停着梓宫不题。,"""Your Majesty is relieved, I have something to do with your Majesty's longevity."" Taizong said: ""The disease is terminal, and my life is in danger. How can I protect it?"" Ming Si, Fu Fengdu judge Cui Gui."" Taizong asked: ""Who is Cui Gui?"" Zheng Yun: ""Cui Gui is the minister before the emperor of the first emperor, he first received the order of Zizhou, and then he was promoted to the minister of the Ministry of Rites. Babai is a friend, and they know each other very well. He is dead now, and now the Yinsi is the judge of Fengdu who is in charge of the life and death document. When His Majesty comes back, he will discipline his soul to return to the world, and he will definitely take Longyan and transfer it to the imperial capital."" When Taizong heard the words, he took it in his hand, wrapped it in his sleeve, and died with his eyes closed. The three palaces and six courtyards, the queen's concubines, the chief minister, the prince, and the two classes of civil and military officials all raised their mourning and filial piety. On the White Tiger Hall, they stopped at the Zigong.","Your subject knows something that will guarantee long life for Your Majesty.” “My illness,” said Taizong, “has reached the irremediable stage; my life is in danger. How can you preserve it?” “Your subject has a letter here,” said Wei, “which I submit to Your Majesty to take with you to Hell and give to the Judge of the Underworld, Jue.” “Who is Cui Jue?” asked Taizong. “Cui Jue,” said Wei, “was the subject of the deceased emperor, your father: at first he was the district magistrate of Cizhou, and subsequently he was promoted to vice president of the Board of Rites. When he was alive, he was an intimate friend and sworn brother of your subject. Now that he is dead, he has become a judge in the capital of the Underworld, having in his charge the chronicles of life and death in the region of darkness. He meets with me frequently, however, in my dreams. If you go there presently and hand this letter to him, he will certainly remember his obligation toward your lowly subject and allow Your Majesty to return here. Surely your soul will return to the human world, and your royal countenance will once more grace the capital.” When Taizong heard these words, he took the letter in his hands and put it in his sleeve; with that, he closed his eyes and died. Those queens and concubines from three palaces and six chambers, the crown prince and the two rows of civil and military officials, all put on their mourning garb to mourn him, as the imperial coffin lay in state at the Hall of the White Tiger, but we shall say no more about that. We do not know how the soul of Taizong came back; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.","The Master’s dragon horse could suffer this no longer, and said to Zhu Bajie, “If you wish to save your Master, you must send for help. You and the monk are no match for this demon.” “Where can we get help?” “You must send to the Mountain Garden for the Monkey King.” Zhu Bajie said, “I am afraid he will be angry with me and kill me, because I blamed him for killing those demons, who appeared as two women and an old man.” “No, the Monkey King is a great and kind king. Tell him that the Master speaks of his ability and kindness often, and would like to see him.” Zhu Bajie therefore went to the Mountain Garden, where he interviewed the Monkey King. But the Monkey did not seem anxious to leave his beautiful place, and Zhu Bajie began to doubt his sincerity in serving the Master, and said so in the hearing of some of the Monkeys. These told the Monkey King of Zhu’s","Before he went, though, Wei Zheng had some words of comfort: “When you go down to Hell, be sure to seek out Cui Jue. He was a minister and close friend of your father, the late emperor. After he died, he became an infernal judge, superintending the ledgers of life and death. We often hold meetings in my dreams. Give him this letter, which reminds him that he owes me a favor— I guarantee he’ll let you return to life.” Placing the letter in his sleeve, the emperor closed his eyes and died. While the imperial family and courtiers put on their mourning clothes, the adventures of Taizong’s soul began. Chapter Eleven","I can ensure Your Majesty long life.” “The disease has reached my heart,” replied the Emperor, “and my life will end at any moment now, so how can you save it?” “Your subject has a letter here,” said Wei Zheng, “that I am offering to Your Majesty to take with you to the underworld and give to Cui Jue, the judge of Fengdu.” “Who is this Cui Jue?” asked the Emperor. “He was one of the officers of Your Majesty's exalted predecessor. From being magistrate of Cizhou he was promoted to be vice-president of the Ministry of Rites. When he was alive he and I were close friends. Now that he is dead he is in charge of the Registers of Birth and Death in the underworld as judge of Fengdu, and he often comes to see me in my dreams. If you take this letter with you on your journey and give it to him, he is bound to allow Your Majesty to come back out of consideration for your humble subject. I can guarantee that Your Majesty's soul will return to the sunlight, and the dragon countenance will certainly return to the imperial capital.” Taizong took the letter and put it in his sleeve, then he shut his eyes in death. The empresses, consorts and imperial concubines of the three palaces and the six compounds, the palace servants, the heir to the throne, and the civil and military officials all grieved and dressed in mourning. The imperial coffin lay in state in the White Tiger Hall."
土地道：“大圣，错怪了小神也。这宝贝乃是地仙之物，小神是个鬼仙，怎么敢拿去？就是闻也无福闻闻。”行者道：“你既不曾拿去，如何打下来就不见了？”土地道：“大圣只知这宝贝延寿，更不知他的出处哩。”行者道：“有甚出处？”土地道：“这宝贝三千年一开花，三千年一结果，再三千年方得成熟。短头一万年，只结得三十个。有缘的，闻一闻，就活三百六十岁；吃一个，就活四万七千年。却是只与五行相畏。”行者道：“怎么与五行相畏？”土地道：“这果子遇金而落，遇木而枯，遇水而化，遇火而焦，遇土而入。敲时必用金器，方得下来。打下来，却将盘儿用丝帕衬垫方可；若受些木器，就枯了，就吃也不得延寿。吃他须用磁器，清水化开食用，遇火即焦而无用。遇土而入者，大圣方才打落地上，他即钻下土去了。这个土有四万七千年，就是钢钻钻他也钻不动些须，比生铁也还硬三四分，人若吃了，所以长生。大圣不信时，可把这地下打打儿看。”行者即掣金箍棒筑了一下，响一声迸起棒来，土上更无痕迹。行者道：“果然！果然！我这棍，打石头如粉碎，撞生铁也有痕，怎么这一下打不伤些儿？这等说，我却错怪了你了，你回去罢。”那土地即回本庙去讫。,"The land said: ""The great sage, it's the little god who is wrong. This treasure is the thing of the earth immortal, and the little god is a ghost, how dare you take it? Even if you hear it, there is no blessing to hear it."" Go, how can you kill it and disappear?"" Tu Tu said: ""The great sage only knows that this treasure prolongs life, and he does not know its source."" The traveler asked, ""Where is the source?"" Tu Tu said: ""This treasure blooms every three thousand years, and three thousand years. Once the fruit is born, it will take another three thousand years to mature. The short head is 10,000 years old, and only 30 are born. If you smell it, you will live 360 years; if you eat one, you will live 47,000 years. The five elements are intimidating."" The traveler asked: ""How can you be afraid of the five elements?"" The earth said: ""This fruit falls when it encounters gold, it withers when it encounters wood, it melts when it encounters water, it scorches when it encounters fire, and it enters when it encounters soil. It must be used when knocking. Gold utensils can only be taken down. When they are knocked down, they can only be lined with silk handkerchiefs. If you receive some wooden utensils, they will dry up and you will not be able to eat them. You must use magnetic utensils to eat them. It is burnt and useless. When the great sage hits the ground and enters the ground, he immediately burrows into the soil. This soil is 47,000 years old, and even a steel drill can't drill a bit of whiskers, even more than pig iron. It is three or four points hard. If people eat it, they will live forever. If the Great Sage does not believe it, you can beat the ground to see."" The traveler immediately hit the golden hoop to build it, and the stick burst out with a sound, and there was no trace on the soil. . The walker said: ""Sure enough! Sure enough! My stick is like smashing stones, and there are also marks on pig iron. How can I not hurt more now? Now, I have wrongly blamed you. You can go back."" Go back to the temple to finish.","“Great Sage,” said the local spirit, “you have made a mistake in blaming me. This treasure is something that belongs to an earthbound immortal, whereas I am only a ghost immortal.13 Would I dare take it? I don’t even have the good fortune to smell it!” “If you hadn’t snatched it,” said Pilgrim, “why did it disappear the moment it fell?” “You may know only about its power to prolong life, Great Sage,” said the local spirit, “but you don’t know its background.” “What do you mean by background?” said Pilgrim. “This treasure,” said the local spirit, “will bloom only once in three thousand years; it will bear fruit after another three thousand years; and the fruit won’t ripen for yet another three thousand years. All in all, one must wait for almost ten thousand years before there are thirty of these fruits. A person lucky enough to smell it once will live for three hundred and sixty years; if he eats one, he will live for forty-seven thousand years. However, the fruit is resistant to the Five Phases.” “What do you mean by resistant to the Five Phases?” asked Pilgrim. The local spirit replied, “This fruit will fall when it encounters gold; it will wither when it encounters wood; it will melt when it encounters water; it will dry up if it encounters fire; and it will be assimilated if it encounters earth. That is why one has to use an instrument of gold to knock it down, but when it falls, it has to be held by a tray cushioned with silk handkerchiefs. The moment it touches wood, it will wither and will not prolong life even if it’s eaten. When it is eaten, it should be held in a porcelain container and should be dissolved with water. Again, fire will dry it up and it will be useless. Finally, what is meant by its assimilation into earth may be illustrated by what happened just now, for when you knocked it down, it at once crawled into the ground. This part of the garden will last for at least forty-seven thousand years. Even a steel pick will not be able to bore through it, for it is three or four times harder than raw iron. That is why a man will live long if he eats one of the fruits. If you don’t believe me, Great Sage, strike at the ground and see for yourself.” Whipping out his golden-hooped rod, Pilgrim gave the ground a terriffic blow. The rod rebounded at once, but there was not the slightest mark on the ground. “Indeed! Indeed!” said Pilgrim. “This rod of mine can turn a boulder into powder; it will leave its mark even on raw iron. How is it that there’s not even a scratch on the ground? Well, in that case, I have made a mistake in blaming you. You may go back. ”14 The local spirit thus went back to his own shrine.",,"Monkey smashed his staff down on her head; Pigsy dealt a second, crushing blow. In an instant, the beauty that had so befuddled the king morphed into a dead white vixen. “Don’t mangle her anymore,” Monkey instructed Pigsy. “We need the king to see her for what she really was.” Pigsy dragged her by the tail out of the cave, where the Old Star was still scolding the deer for his various diabolical escapades. Pausing only to order the local spirit to burn the cave to ashes, Monkey and company returned to the palace of Bhikku, where they exhibited the two former favorites before the king. Scarlet with embarrassment, the king muttered his thanks, then busied himself ordering the royal catering department to prepare another banquet for the visitors. After taking their seats, Tripitaka and Sandy asked how the Old Star had allowed his deer to cause so much trouble. “Oh, that,” the Old Star replied with a laugh. “An immortal neighbor of mine dropped by for a game of chess, and the deer slipped away while we were playing.” At this moment, the banquet was served: a magnificent feast of dragon-shaped pastries, duck-shaped cakes, lion-shaped bonbons, and roll-shaped rolls. The brocade-draped tables were covered end to end with enormous chestnuts, lychees, peaches, dates, and persimmons; gold and silver bowls were heaped with fragrant rice. “You can have the fruit,” Pigsy told Monkey after the toasts, “I’ll handle the rest.” He then demolished the entire banquet. When Old Star got up to leave, the king kneeled to beg a cure for his illness. “Because I was so focused on recovering my deer,” the immortal said, “I came without any elixirs. I’d have been delighted to pass a couple of nutritious formulas on to you, but your tendons and spirit have degenerated so much that no alchemy will have any effect. I do, however, have up my sleeve three fire dates, which go nicely with tea. You’d be welcome to them.” As soon as he ate them, the king felt his sickness lifting; these magic fruits later enabled him to live to a ripe old age. “Could I have a few?” Pigsy asked. “I’m still a bit hungry.” “Afraid I’ve run out,” Old Star apologized. “I’ll send on some more when I get home.” The immortal then leaped onto the deer and soared into the clouds. “Time for us to be on our way, too,” Tripitaka told his disciples. The king begged them to stay on longer as his counselors. “Less luxury and more charity,” Tripitaka told him. “That’s my only advice to you.” Although Tripitaka absolutely refused the king’s offer of gold and silver to cover their journey onward, the king insisted that he get into the royal carriage and be pushed through the streets and out of the city by the monarch and his courtiers. As the townsfolk came out to watch, another howling gale—the work of the friendly local spirits who had previously helped Monkey—deposited by the side of the road 1,111 coops, each containing a wailing little boy. Moments later, their ecstatic parents rushed up, hugging, kissing, and soothing their lost children. Chapter Thirty-Four After crossing the Mountain of Hidden Mists, the travelers approached another city.","“Great Sage,” the deity replied, “don't be angry with me. These treasures belong to the Immortals of the Earth, and I am a ghost Immortal, so I would never dare take one. I've never even had the good fortune to smell one.” “If you didn't take it, why did it disappear the moment I knocked it down from the tree?” Monkey asked. “You may know that these treasures give eternal life, Great Sage,” the deity replied, “but you don't know about their origin.” “Where do they come from, then?” Monkey asked. “These treasures,” the deity replied, “take three thousand years to blossom, another three thousand to form, and three thousand more to ripen. In almost ten thousand years only thirty grow. Anyone lucky enough to smell one will live for three hundred and sixty years, and if you eat one you will live to be forty-seven thousand. These fruit fear only the Five Elements.” “What do you mean, 'fear only the Five Elements?' “ Monkey asked. “If they meet metal,” the deity said, “they fall; if they meet wood they rot; if they meet water they dissolve; if they meet fire they are burnt; and if they meet earth they go into it. If you tap them you have to use a golden rod, otherwise they won't drop; and when you knock them down you must catch them in a bowl padded with silk handkerchiefs. If they come in contact with wooden utensils they rot, and even if you eat one it won't make you live any longer. When you eat them you must do so off porcelain, and they should be cooked in clear water. If they come in contact with fire they become charred and useless, and they go into any earth they touch. When you knocked one to the ground just now it went straight in, and as the earth here will now live for forty-seven thousand years you wouldn't be able to make any impression on it even with a steel drill: it's much harder than wrought iron. But if a man eats one he wins long life. Try hitting the ground if you don't believe me.” Monkey raised his gold-ringed cudgel and brought it down on the ground. There was a loud noise as the cudgel sprang back. The ground was unmarked. “So you're right,” said Monkey, “you're right. This cudgel of mine can smash rocks to powder and even leave its mark on wrought iron, but this time it did no damage at all. This means that I was wrong to blame you. You may go back now.” At this the local deity went back to his shrine."

“师父放心，且莫焦恼。如今天色又晚，且坐在这崖次之下，待老孙去化些斋饭来，你吃了睡去，待明日再处。”八戒道：“说得是，你快去快来。”行者急纵云跳起去，正到直北下人家化了一钵素斋，回献师父。师父见他来得甚快，便叫：“悟空，我们去化斋的人家，求问他一个过河之策，不强似与这怪争持？”行者笑道：“这家子远得很哩！相去有五七千里之路。他那里得知水性？问他何益？”八戒道：“哥哥又来扯谎了。五七千里路，你怎么这等去来得快？”行者道：“你那里晓得，老孙的觔斗云，一纵有十万八千里。象这五七千路，只消把头点上两点，把腰躬上一躬，就是个往回，有何难哉！”八戒道：“哥啊，既是这般容易，你把师父背着，只消点点头，躬躬腰，跳过去罢了，何必苦苦的与他厮战？”行者道：“你不会驾云？你把师父驮过去不是？”八戒道：“师父的骨肉凡胎，重似泰山，我这驾云的，怎称得起？须是你的觔斗方可。”行者道：“我的觔斗，好道也是驾云，只是去的有远近些儿。你是驮不动，我却如何驮得动？自古道，遣泰山轻如芥子，携凡夫难脱红尘。象这泼魔毒怪，使摄法，弄风头，却是扯扯拉拉，就地而行，不能带得空中而去。象那样法儿，老孙也会使会弄。还有那隐身法、缩地法，老孙件件皆知。,"""Master, don't worry, don't worry. If it's too late today, let's sit under the cliff and wait for the old grandson to cook some fast food. You eat and sleep, and you will be there tomorrow."" Bajie said: ""Said Yes, hurry up and come."" The traveler jumped up in a hurry, and when he arrived at Zhibeixia, he made a bowl of vegetarian food and returned to the master. When the master saw how fast he was coming, he called out, ""Wu Kong, let's go to Huazhai's house and ask him for a way to cross the river. Isn't it like fighting with this monster?"" The traveler laughed and said, ""This family is very far away! There are five or seven thousand miles of road. Where did he know about water? What’s the benefit of asking him?” Bajie said, “Brother lied again. Five or seven thousand miles away, why did you come and go so quickly?” The walker said, “You It is known from there that the old grandson's somersault cloud is one hundred and eight thousand miles long. Like these five or seven thousand roads, you only need to nod your head twice and bow your waist once, and you will go back, what's so difficult!"" Bajie said. ""Brother, since it's so easy, you carry the master on your back, just nod your head, bow your waist, and jump over, why bother fighting with him?"" The walker said, ""You can't ride the clouds? Master carried the past, didn't you?"" Bajie said: ""Master's flesh and blood is as heavy as Mount Tai. How can I be called a cloud-riding person? It must be your somersaults."" The walker said: ""My somersaults are good Taoism. It is also riding the clouds, but it is farther and nearer. You can’t carry it, but how can I carry it? Since ancient times, sending Mount Tai is as light as mustard seeds, and it is difficult for ordinary people to get rid of the red dust. , to get the limelight, but it's just chatting, walking on the spot, and can't take it away in the air. Like that, the old grandson will do it. There are also the stealth method, the shrinking method, and the old grandson. Everyone knows.","“Master, relax!” said Pilgrim. “Let’s not worry now, for it’s getting late. You sit here on the cliff and let old Monkey go beg some vegetarian food. Take some rest after you eat, and we’ll find a solution tomorrow.” “You are right,” said Eight Rules. “Go, and come back quickly.” Pilgrim swiftly mounted the clouds and went north to beg a bowl of vegetarian food from a family to present to his master. When the master saw him return so soon, he said, “Wukong, let us go to that household which gave us the food and ask them how we may cross this river. Isn’t this better than fighting the monster?” With a laugh, Pilgrim said, “That household is quite far from here, about six or seven thousand miles, no less! How could the people there know about the water? What’s the use of asking them?” “You are fibbing again, Elder Brother!” said Eight Rules. “Six or seven thousand miles, how could you cover that distance so quickly?” “You have no idea,” said Pilgrim, “about the capacity of my cloud somersault, which with one leap can cover one hundred and eight thousand miles. For the six or seven thousand here, all I have to do is to nod my head and stretch my waist, and that’s a round trip already! What’s so hard about that?” “Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “if it’s so easy, all you need to do is to carry Master on your back: nod your head, stretch your waist, and jump across. Why continue to fight this monster?” “Don’t you know how to ride the clouds?” asked Pilgrim. “Can’t you carry him across the river?” “The mortal nature and worldly bones of Master are as heavy as the Tai Mountain,” Eight Rules said. “How could my cloud soaring bear him up? It has to be your cloud somersault.” “My cloud somersault is essentially like cloud soaring,” said Pilgrim, “the only difference being that I can cover greater distances more rapidly. If you can’t carry him, what makes you think I can? There’s an old proverb that says: Move Mount Tai: it’s light as mustard seeds. Lift a man and you won’t leave the red dust! Take this monster here: he can use spells and call upon the wind, pushing and pulling a little, but he can’t carry a human into the air. And if it’s this kind of magic, old Monkey knows every trick well, including becoming invisible and making distances shorter.",,"“Chastity to spare. To the rescue!” Never one to beat around the bush, Pigsy smashed the stone doors with his rake. “Those two horrors from yesterday are back,” cried the terrified sentries, rushing inside the cave. The fiend, who was just emerging from her bedroom, immediately gave instructions. “Keep our imperial visitor safe in the back of the cave. I’ll deal with our uninvited guests.” She then seized her trident. “Outrageous monkey! Barbaric swine! How dare you break down my door!” “That’s our teacher you’ve got there,” Monkey shouted back. “Release him now and we’ll spare your life. Refuse and we’ll flatten this mountain of yours.” The fiend answered by snorting smoke and fire and charging with her trident. After a few rounds, she dealt Pigsy’s snout the coup de grâce she’d given Monkey the previous day. Pigsy promptly fled in agony, his rake trailing behind him. Monkey himself made a false move with his staff and also fled in defeat. The victorious fiend told her servants to secure the doors with piles of rocks. Standing guard by the horse, Sandy heard the most fearful grunting and snorting approach. Pigsy soon came into view. “This is the worst! The worst!” he wailed. Monkey followed not far behind, giggling. “You thought I had a head carbuncle yesterday. Looks like you’ve got snout pox today!” “Oh, the pain!” Pigsy resumed. “I can’t bear it!” The three of them were thus in a fix when they spotted an old woman approaching from the south, a green bamboo basket filled with vegetables over her arm. Monkey quickly noticed that the old woman was wreathed with fragrant mists. “Kowtow!” he shouted to his fellow disciples. “It’s Guanyin!”","“Relax, master,” said Monkey, “there's no need to worry. It's getting late, so you'd better sit on the bank while I go and beg some food. When you've eaten that you can go to sleep, and we can decide what to do tomorrow morning.” “Good idea,” said Pig. “Be as quick as you can.” Monkey leapt up on his cloud, went due North to a house where he begged some food, and came back to give it to his master. Seeing him come back so soon, Sanzang said to him, “Monkey, let's go to the house where you begged this food and ask them how to cross this river. That would be better than having to fight this ogre.” “But that house is a long way away,” laughed Monkey. “It's about two thousand miles from here. What would be the point in asking them about this river? They wouldn't know anything about it.” “You're telling tall stories again,” Pig said. “If it's two thousand miles away, how did you get there and back so fast?” “You wouldn't know, of course,” Brother Monkey replied, “that my somersault cloud can cover thirty-six thousand miles with a single bound. To do a mere two-thousand-mile return journey takes only a couple of nods and a bow—there's nothing to it.” “If it's so easy, brother,” said Pig, “you should carry the master on your back, take him across with just a couple of nods and a bow, and save us all the trouble of fighting the monster.” “You can ride clouds, can't you?” said Monkey. “Why don't you carry the master across?” “The master's mortal flesh and bones are heavier than Mount Tai,” said Pig, “So although I can ride clouds I could never lift him. Nothing but your somersault will do the trick.” “My somersault is the same as cloud-riding.” Monkey said, “except that it takes you further. I'm no more able to carry him than you are. As the old saying goes, 'Mount Tai is as easy to move as a mustard seed, but a mortal cannot be dragged away from the earthly dust.' When that other poisonous monster of a fiend made a magic wind I could only move the master by dragging and tugging him along the ground. Of course. I can do tricks like that, and all those other ones like making myself invisible or shrinking land."

美猴王正喜间，忽对众说道：“汝等弓弩熟谙，兵器精通，奈我这口刀着实榔槺，不遂我意，奈何？”四老猴上前启奏道：“大王乃是仙圣，凡兵是不堪用；但不知大王水里可能去得？”悟空道：“我自闻道之后，有七十二般地煞变化之功；筋斗云有莫大的神通；善能隐身遁身，起法摄法；上天有路，入地有门；步日月无影，入金石无碍；水不能溺，火不能焚。那些儿去不得？”四猴道：“大王既有此神通，我们这铁板桥下，水通东海龙宫。大王若肯下去，寻着老龙王，问他要件甚么兵器，却不趁心？”悟空闻言甚喜道：“等我去来。”,"While the Monkey King was overjoyed, he suddenly said to the crowd: ""You guys are familiar with bows and crossbows, and you are proficient in weapons, but my knife is really a slap in the face, and it doesn't do what I want, what can I do?"" The four old monkeys stepped forward and said, ""Your Majesty is Immortal saints, ordinary soldiers are useless; but I don’t know if the king can go in the water?” Wukong said: “After I heard about the Dao, I have seventy-two earth-shattering transformation skills; somersaulting clouds have great supernatural powers; Body, get up and take the law; there is a way to heaven, and there is a door to enter the earth; walking in the sun and the moon without shadows, entering gold and stone without hindrance; water can't drown, fire can't burn. Those who can't go?"" The four monkeys said: ""Your Majesty has this Shentong, under our iron bridge, the water leads to the Dragon Palace of the East China Sea. If the king is willing to go down, look for the old dragon king, and ask him what weapon he needs, but don't take advantage of it?"" Wukong was very happy when he heard the words: ""Wait for me to come.""","While the Handsome Monkey King was enjoying all this, he suddenly said to the multitude, “You all have become adept with the bow and arrow and proficient in the use of weapons. But this scimitar of mine is truly cumbersome, not at all to my liking. What can I do?” The four elder monkeys came forward and memorialized, “The great king is a divine sage, and therefore it is not fit for him to use an earthly weapon. We do not know, however, whether the great king is able to take a journey through water?” “Since I have known the Way,” said Wukong, “I have the ability of seventy-two transformations. The cloud somersault has unlimited power. I am familiar with the magic of body concealment and the magic of displacement. I can find my way to Heaven or I can enter the Earth. I can walk past the sun and the moon without casting a shadow, and I can penetrate stone and metal without hindrance. Water cannot drown me, nor fire burn me. Is there any place I can’t go to?” “It’s a good thing that the great king possesses such powers,” said the four monkeys, “for the water below this sheet iron bridge of ours flows directly into the Dragon Palace of the Eastern Ocean. If you are willing to go down there, Great King, you will find the old Dragon King, from whom you may request some kind of weapon. Won’t that be to your liking?” Hearing this, Wukong said with delight, “Let me make the trip!”","In the midst of this splendid success, however, the Monkey King said, “I am not satisfied. My sword is very blunt, what shall we do?” The four elder monkeys came forward and said, “Oh Great King, you are an Immortal Sage, and all human weapons are of no use to you. But we do not know if you can live under water.” The Seeker of Secrets said, “Since I discovered the secret of life I know seventy-two magic transformations. I can ride through the air like lightning; I can make myself invisible; I can ascend to high Heaven or descend into the depths of the earth; I can walk in sunlight or moonlight without throwing a shadow; I can go through metals or stones; water cannot drown me, fire cannot burn me. I am in possession of all these powers.” The four elder monkeys said, “Since the Great King has all these magic powers, and the water under our iron bridge flows to the Dragon Palace of the Eastern Sea, if you are willing to go down that water in search of the Venerable Dragon King, and ask him for a weapon, you may get what you want.” The Seeker of Secrets rejoiced on hearing this and said, “I will go.”","The four wise monkeys again stepped forward. “You are an immortal, Your Majesty. Ordinary weapons are not the thing for you. Can you travel underwater?” “I have mastered seventy-two transformations,” explained Monkey. “I can cloud-somersault, turn invisible, and apparate. I can soar to heaven and bore down into the earth. I can saunter across the sun and the moon without casting a shadow; I can pass through metal and stone. Water cannot drown me, fire cannot burn me. Is there anything I can’t do?” “Marvelous. For the water beneath this iron bridge flows directly to the palace of the dragon king of the Eastern Ocean. Why don’t you go and ask him for a weapon?” Monkey thought this an excellent plan. “Back soon.”","One day, amid all this success, the Handsome Monkey King suddenly said to the other monkeys, “You are now expert in the bow and crossbow, and highly skilled in other weapons; but this sword of mine is too clumsy for my liking. What shall I do about it?” The four veteran monkeys came forward and submitted a suggestion: “Your Majesty is an Immortal, so mortals' weapons are not good enough for you. We wonder if Your Majesty is able to travel underwater.” “Since hearing the Way,” Sun Wukong replied, “I have mastered the seventy-two earthly transformations. My somersault cloud has outstanding magical powers. I know how to conceal myself and vanish. I can make spells and end them. I can reach the sky and find my way into the earth. I can travel under the sun or moon without leaving a shadow or go through metal or stone freely. I can't be drowned by water or burned by fire. There's nowhere I cannot go.” “If Your Majesty has these magical powers, the stream under our iron bridge leads to the Dragon palace of the Eastern Sea. If you are willing to go down there, go and find the Dragon King and ask him for whatever weapon it is you want. Wouldn't that suit you?” “Wait till I get back,” was Sun Wukong's delighted reply."
真君与大圣斗经三百馀合，不知胜负。那真君抖擞神威，摇身一变，变得身高万丈，两只手，举着三尖两刃神锋，好便似华山顶上之峰，青脸獠牙，朱红头发，恶狠狠，望大圣着头就砍。这大圣也使神通，变得与二郎身躯一样，嘴脸一般，举一条如意金箍棒，却就是昆仑顶上擎天之柱，抵住二郎神，唬得那马、流元帅，战兢兢，摇不得旌旗；崩、巴二将，虚怯怯，使不得刀剑。这阵上，康、张、姚、李、郭申、直健，传号令，撒放草头神，向他那水帘洞外，纵着鹰犬，搭弩张弓，一齐掩杀。可怜冲散妖猴四健将，捉拿灵怪二三千！那些猴，抛戈弃甲，撇剑抛枪；跑的跑，喊的喊；上山的上山，归洞的归洞；好似夜猫惊宿鸟，飞洒满天星。众兄弟得胜不题。,"The True Monarch and the Great Sage have fought together for more than 300 times, and they do not know the outcome. The true monarch was full of divine power, transformed into a ten thousand zhang tall, with two hands, holding a three-pointed and two-edged divine sharp edge, just like the peak on the top of Huashan Mountain, with a blue face and fangs, red hair, vicious, looking at the great sage. just chop. This great sage also made supernatural powers, becoming the same as Erlang's body, with the same face and face, holding a wishful golden hoop stick, but it was Kunlun's top pillar, resisting Erlang God, and bluffing the horse and Marshal Liu, trembling, Can't wave flags; Beng and Ba two generals are timid and timid, so they can't make swords. In this battle, Kang, Zhang, Yao, Li, Guo Shen, and Zhijian gave orders, scattered grass-headed gods, and directed eagles and dogs to the outside of his water curtain cave. Pitifully scattered the four strong generals of the demon monkeys, and captured two or three thousand spirit monsters! Those monkeys abandoned their arms and armor, threw their swords and spears; they ran and shouted; those who went up the mountain returned to the cave; they were like night cats and stunned birds, flying all over the sky. The brothers are victorious.","The Immortal Master fought the Great Sage for more than three hundred rounds, but the result still could not be determined. The Immortal Master, therefore, summoned all his magical powers; with a shake, he made his body a hundred thousand feet tall. Holding with both hands the divine lance of three points and two blades like the peaks that cap the Hua Mountain, this green-faced, saber-toothed figure with scarlet hair aimed a violent blow at the head of the Great Sage. But the Great Sage also exerted his magical power and changed himself into a figure having the features and height of Erlang. He wielded a compliant golden-hooped rod that resembled the Heaven-supporting pillar on top of Mount Kunlun to oppose the god Erlang. This vision so terrified the marshals, Ma and Liu, that they could no longer wave the flags, and so appalled the generals, Beng and Ba, that they could use neither scimitar nor sword. On the side of Erlang, the Brothers Kang, Zhang, Yao, Li, Guo Shen, and Zhi Jian gave the order to the plant-headed deities to let loose the falcons and dogs and to advance upon those monkeys in front of the Water-Curtain Cave with mounted arrows and drawn bows. The charge, alas, Dispersed the four mighty commanders of monkey imps And captured two or three thousand numinous fiends! Those monkeys dropped their spears and abandoned their armor, forsook their swords, and threw away their lances. They scattered in all directions—running, screaming, scuttling up the mountain, or scrambling back to the cave. It was as if a cat at night had stolen upon resting birds: they darted up as stars to fill the sky. The Brothers thus gained a complete victory, of which we shall speak no further.","The Great Sage also used his magic art and changed himself so that he looked exactly like the Divine Kinsman. He raised his magic club, which was as huge as a peak of the Himalayas, and opposed the Divine Kinsman and so terrified the standard bearer that he could not hold the flag, and the two generals Peng and Pa that they could not hold their swords. The four governors, together with the two commanders-in-chief gave orders the troops to go to the waterfall outside the cave, and carry with them the falcons and hounds and the bows and arrows to kill everybody outright. The poor monkeys were throwing away their spears and armor, their swords and lances, and were running and screaming, some fleeing to the mountains, others to the caves. The Great Sage, suddenly seeing all the monkeys of his camp fleeing in terror, was himself alarmed, and, thinking of hiding himself by magic, retreated with his club.","This murderously close duel raged through three hundred clashes; deputies on both sides waved banners and beat drums. With no clear winner emerging, Erlang decided to mobilize some magic, suddenly towering a hundred thousand feet tall. Monkey instantly replicated the trick. Noticing that the monkey generals were distracted by this display, Erlang’s blood brothers ordered the plant-headed spirits to release hawks, hounds, and arrows at the entrance of Water-Curtain Cave.","After Erlang and the Great Sage had fought over three hundred rounds the outcome of the fight was still undecided. Erlang braced, himself, and with a shake became ten thousand fathoms tall; in his hands his two-bladed trident looked like the peaks of Mount Hua. His face was black, his fangs were long, and his hair was bright red: he looked ferociously evil. He hacked at the Great Sage's head. The Great Sage, also resorting to magic, gave himself a body as big as Erlang's and a face as frightening; and he raised his As-You-Will gold-banded cudgel, which was now like the pillar of Heaven on the summit of the Kunlun Mountain, to ward off Erlang's blow. This reduced the two ape field marshals Ma and Liu to such trembling terror that they could no longer wave their banners, while the gibbon generals Seng and Ba were too scared to use their swords. On the other side Kang, Zhang, Yao, Li, Guo Shen and Zhi Jian threw the straw-headed gods into an assault on the Water Curtain Cave, with the dogs and eagles unleashed and their bows and crossbows drawn. This attack put the four monkey generals to flight, and two or three thousand devils were captured. The monkeys threw away their spears, tore off their armour, abandoned their swords and halberds, and fled screaming. Some went up the mountain and some returned to the cave, like roosting birds frightened by an owl, or stars scattered across the sky. That is all we have to say about the sworn brothers' victory."
行者到于门首，又见那两扇石门，关得甚紧，门上有一横石板，明书六个大字，乃“黑风山黑风洞”，即便轮棒，叫声“开门！”那里面有把门的小妖，开了门出来，问道：“你是何人，敢来击吾仙洞？”行者骂道：“你个作死的孽畜！甚么个去处，敢称仙洞！仙字是你称的？快进去报与你那黑汉，教他快送老爷的袈裟出来，饶你一窝性命！”小妖急急跑到里面，报道：“大王！,"When the traveler arrived at the front of the door, he saw the two stone doors, which were closed very tightly. There was a horizontal stone slab on the door with six characters inscribed, ""Heifeng Mountain Heifeng Cave"". There was a little demon who was holding the door, opened the door and came out, asking: ""Who are you, dare to attack my fairy cave?"" What is your name? Go in and report to your black man, and teach him to take out the cassock of the master, and spare your life!"" The little demon hurried inside and reported, ""Your Majesty!","Pilgrim went to the door and found that the two stone doors were tightly closed. On top of the door was a stone tablet, on which was plainly written in large letters, “Black Wind Mountain, Black Wind Cave.” He lifted his rod to beat at the door, crying, “Open the door!” A little demon who stood guard at the door came out and asked, “Who are you, that you dare beat at our immortal cave?” “You damnable beast!” scolded Pilgrim. “What sort of a place is this, that you dare assume the title of ‘immortal’? Is the word ‘immortal’ for you to use? Hurry inside and tell that swarthy fellow to bring out your venerable father’s cassock at once. Then I may spare the lives of the whole nest of you.” The little demon ran swiftly inside and reported: “Great King!",,"I may be small, but I punch above my weight. Hide away while I finish him off, then I’ll take you back to the palace.” With the princess out of sight, Monkey transformed himself into her exact likeness and went into the cave to await the monster. Back in Precious Image, Pigsy and Sandy had, according to the plan, smashed the two boys to the ground in front of the throne, leaving a hideous hash of blood and bones. “Behold the sons of the monster Yellow-Robe!”","When he reached the gates Monkey saw that they were very strongly fastened, and above them was a stone tablet inscribed with the words Black Wind Cave of the Black Wind Mountain in large letters. He brandished his cudgel and shouted, “Open up!” at which the junior devil who was on the gates opened them and asked, “Who are you, and how dare you come and attack our Immortals' cave?” “You damned cur,” Monkey railed at him. “How dare you call a place like this an 'Immortals' cave'? What right have you to use the word 'Immortal'? Go in and tell that dark fellow of yours that if he gives back my cassock at once, I'll spare your lives.” The junior devil rushed in and reported, “The 'Buddha's Robe Banquet' is off, Your Majesty."
又听得支的一声，二门开了。行者嘤嘤的飞将进去，只见那老妖吩咐各门上谨慎，一壁厢收拾兵器：“只怕昨日那阵风不曾刮死孙行者，他今日必定还来，来时定教他一命休矣。”行者听说，又飞过那厅堂，径来后面。但见层门，关得甚紧，行者漫门缝儿钻将进去，原来是个大空园子，那壁厢定风桩上绳缠索绑着唐僧哩。那师父纷纷泪落，心心只念着悟空、悟能，不知都在何处。行者停翅，叮在他光头上，叫声“师父”。那长老认得他的声音道：“悟空啊，想杀我也！你在那里叫我哩？”行者道：“师父，我在你头上哩。你莫要心焦，少得烦恼，我们务必拿住妖精，方才救得你的性命。”唐僧道：“徒弟啊，几时才拿得妖精么？”行者道：“拿你的那虎怪，已被八戒打死了，只是老妖的风势利害。料着只在今日，管取拿他。你放心莫哭，我去哑。”,"With another bang, the second door opened. Xing Zhe flew in, only to see the old demon instructing the gates to be cautious, and to pack up weapons in a compartment: ""I am afraid that the gust of wind yesterday did not kill Sun Xing Zhe, he will definitely come back today, and he will definitely teach him a life when he comes. It's over."" When the traveler heard that, he flew over the hall again and came to the back. But when I saw the door on the floor, it was closed so tightly that pedestrians crawl through the cracks of the door. It turned out to be a large empty garden, and Tang Seng Li was tied with ropes on the fixed wind pile in the wall. The master burst into tears, thinking only of Wukong and Wuneng, but he didn't know where they were. The walker stopped his wings, stung his bald head, and called out ""Master"". The elder recognized his voice and said, ""Wukong, you want to kill me too! Where are you calling me?"" The walker said, ""Master, I'm on your head. Don't worry, don't worry, we must take it. You can only save your life by staying in the fairy."" Tang Seng said: ""Apprentice, when did you get the fairy?"" Walker said: ""The tiger monster that took you has been beaten to death by Bajie, it's just the wind of the old monster. Profits and harms. It is expected that only today will take care of him. Don't worry, don't cry, I'll go dumb.""","Just then, the second door inside opened with a creak, and Pilgrim immediately flew in. The old monster was giving orders to all his subordinates to be especially careful in guarding the various entrances while they made ready their weapons. “If the wind yesterday did not kill that Pilgrim Sun,” he said, “he will certainly come back today. When he comes, we’ll finish him off.” Hearing this, Pilgrim flew past the main hall and arrived at the rear of the cave, where he found another door tightly shut. Crawling through a crack in the door, he discovered a large garden, in the middle of which, bound by ropes to a pole, was the Tang Monk. That master was shedding tears profusely, constantly wondering where Wukong and Wuneng were to be found. Pilgrim stopped his flight and alighted on his bald head, saying, “Master!” Recognizing his voice, the Elder said, “Wukong, I nearly died thinking of you! Where are you calling from?” “Master,” said Pilgrim, “I’m on your head. Calm yourself and stop worrying. We must first capture the monster before we can rescue you. “Disciple,” said the Tang Monk, “when will you be able to capture the monster?” “The Tiger Monster who took you,” said Pilgrim, “has already been slain by Eight Rules. But the wind of the old monster is a powerful weapon. I suspect we should be able to capture him today. Relax and stop crying.",,"“No presents, no water,” Wish Fulfillment countered. Monkey now drew his antagonist into battle farther down the mountain, while Sandy dashed inside with the bucket and filled it to the brim, breaking the arm of the assistant in the process, then ran back out and onto his cloud. “Leave him!” he shouted to Monkey, who was still in the thick of battle. “I’ve got the water.” Monkey blocked the hook with his staff. “No hard feelings, now that I’ve got what I came for. But no more fleecing innocent passersby.” Though Wish Fulfillment tried another couple of hook swipes at Monkey’s legs, Monkey danced out of reach, then grabbed the hook and smashed it to pieces. He hopped back onto his own cloud, caught up with Sandy, and the two of them returned in triumph. “How’s it going, big belly?” Monkey teased Pigsy, who was desperately hugging the door frame. “Have you got it?” pleaded the desperate Pigsy. Monkey would have had some more fun with him, but Sandy was more magnanimous. “Abortion water to the rescue!” The old woman half-filled a cup with the water. “Sip this slowly; one mouthful should be enough to end the pregnancy.” “Just pass the bucket,” gasped Pigsy. “If you drink the whole thing,” said the woman, “it’ll dissolve your entire digestive system.” On learning this, Pigsy behaved with uncharacteristic moderation around the water. Within about twenty minutes, the two of them felt sharp cramps and their intestines began to growl, after which Pigsy lost control of his bowels and bladder; Tripitaka also retired to empty his system.","The two gates creaked open, and Monkey flew inside with a buzz to see the old demon giving orders that a very close watch was to be kept at all the gates, and all the weapons are to be assembled at such-and-such a spot. “I'm afraid that yesterday's wind may not have killed Brother Monkey,” he was saying, “and I think he's bound to come back today. When he does, I'll finish him off.” When he heard this, Monkey flew across to the back of the hall where he saw a door that was tightly closed. He slipped through the crack between the two leaves of the door and found himself in a large empty garden, on one side of which was the wind-settling stake with the Tang Priest tied to it. The tears were pouring down Sanzang's face as he wondered where Monkey and Pig were. Monkey stopped flying as he stung his shaven pate and called, “Master.” “Monkey,” said Sanzang, recognizing his voice, “do you want to get me killed? Where are you calling me from?” “I'm on your head, master. Don't be anxious or worried. We are sure to catch that evil spirit and save your life.” “How long will it be till you catch that evil spirit, disciple?” “Pig has already killed the tiger monster who captured you,” Monkey replied, “but that old fiend has a terrible way with a hurricane. All the same, I'm certain that I can catch him today, so don't worry and stop crying."
继子荫孙图富贵，更无一个肯回头！,"Stepsons and grandsons are rich and noble, and no one is willing to turn back!","Seeking wealth and power to give to sons of sons, There’s not one ever willing to turn back.","Heedless of the doom of death. Sons and grandsons all want ease,","Monkey remained determined to seek the formula for eternal life, while the humans who surrounded him sought only money and fame, without a thought for their own mortality; no one cared what became of him.","When trying to ensure their sons and grandsons inherit their wealth and power, They have no time to stop and think."
相持取胜有何难，赌斗求功不用说。何怕你铜头铁脑一身钢，钯到魂消神气泄！”行者闻言，收了铁棒道：“呆子不要说嘴！老孙把这头伸在那里，你且筑一下儿，看可能魂消气泄？”那怪真个举起钯，着气力筑将来，扑的一下，钻起钯的火光焰焰，更不曾筑动一些儿头皮。唬得他手麻脚软，道声“好头！好头！”行者道：“你是也不知。老孙因为闹天宫，偷了仙丹，盗了蟠桃，窃了御酒，被小圣二郎擒住，押在斗牛宫前，众天神把老孙斧剁锤敲，刀砍剑刺，火烧雷打，也不曾损动分毫。又被那太上老君拿了我去，放在八卦炉中，将神火锻炼，炼做个火眼金睛，铜头铁臂。不信，你再筑几下，看看疼与不疼？”那怪道：“你这猴子，我记得你闹天宫时，家住在东胜神洲傲来国花果山水帘洞里，到如今久不闻名，你怎么来到这里上门子欺我？莫敢是我丈人去那里请你来的？”行者道：“你丈人不曾去请我。因是老孙改邪归正，弃道从僧，保护一个东土大唐驾下御弟，叫做三藏法师，往西天拜佛求经，路过高庄借宿，那高老儿因话说起，就请我救他女儿，拿你这馕糠的夯货！”那怪一闻此言，丢了钉钯，唱个大喏道：“那取经人在那里？累烦你引见引见。”行者道：,"How difficult is it to win a stalemate? It goes without saying that gambling and fighting for success. Why be afraid of your copper head, iron brain and steel body, and palladium to your soul and let out your breath! When the traveler heard the words, he took the iron stick and said, ""Don't talk about it, idiot!"" The old grandson stretched this head there, and you can build it a little bit, to see if the soul may be relieved? ""That monster really raised the palladium and built the future with all his strength. With a pounce, he got into the flames of the palladium, and he never even touched his scalp. He was so stunned that his hands were numb and his feet were soft, and he said, ""Good head! good head! The walker said: ""You don't know either. Lao Sun stole elixir, peaches, and imperial wine because of the trouble in the Heavenly Palace. He was captured by the little saint Erlang and held in front of the Bullfighting Palace. Not even a single bit of damage. I was taken by the old master, and put in the gossip furnace, where the divine fire was tempered to make it with golden eyes and a copper head and iron arms. If you don't believe me, do you build it a few more times to see if it hurts or not? The strange said: ""You monkey, I remember that when you were in the Heavenly Palace, your family lived in the water curtain cave of Aolai Guohuaguoshan in Dongsheng Shenzhou. It has not been famous for a long time. Why did you come here to bully me?"" Wouldn't it be my husband who invited you there? The walker said, ""Your husband never invited me."" Because it was the old grandson who changed his ways and returned to the righteous, abandoned the Tao and became a monk, and protected an imperial younger brother from the Eastern Tang Dynasty called Master Sanzang. He went to the west to pray to Buddha and ask for scriptures. He passed by Gaozhuang and stayed there. The old man asked me to save him because of what he said. Daughter, take your naan chaff! When the strange heard this, he threw his nails and sang a loud voice, ""Where is the person who took the scriptures?"" Excuse me for introductions. ""The walker said:","To win in battle? Why, it’s no hard thing! And making merit? It need not be said! You may have a bronze head, an iron brain, and a full steel frame. I’ll rake till your soul melts and your spirit leaks!” When Pilgrim heard these words, he put away his iron rod and said, “Don’t brag too much, Idiot! Old Monkey will stretch out his head right here, and you can give him a blow. See if his soul melts and his spirit leaks!” The monster did indeed raise his rake high and bring it down with all his might; with a loud bang, the rake made sparks as it bounced back up. But the blow did not make so much as a scratch on Pilgrim’s head. The monster was so astounded that his hands turned numb and his feet grew weak. He mumbled, “What a head! What a head!” “You didn’t know about this, did you?” said Pilgrim. “When I caused such turmoil in Heaven by stealing the magic pills, the immortal peaches, and the imperial wine, I was captured by the Little Sage Erlang and taken to the Polestar Palace. The various celestial beings chopped me with an ax, pounded me with a bludgeon, cut me with a scimitar, jabbed me with a sword, burned me with fire, and struck me with thunder —all this could not hurt me one whit. Then I was taken by Laozi and placed in his eight-trigram brazier, in which I was refined by divine fire until I had fiery eyes and diamond pupils, a bronze head and iron arms. If you don’t believe me, give me some more blows and see whether it hurts me at all.” “Monkey,” said the monster, “I remember that at the time you were causing trouble in Heaven, you lived in the Water-Curtain Cave of the Flower-Fruit Mountain, in the Aolai Country of the East Pūrvavideha Continent. Your name hasn’t been heard of for a long time. How is it that you suddenly turn up at this place to oppress me? Could my father-in-law have gone all that way to ask you to come here?” “Your father-in-law did not go to fetch me,” said Pilgrim. “It’s old Monkey who turned from wrong to right, who left the Daoist to follow the Buddhist. I am now accompanying the royal brother of the Great Tang Emperor in the Land of the East, whose name is Tripitaka, Master of the Law. He is on his way to the Western Heaven to seek scriptures from Buddha. We passed through the Gao Village and asked for lodging; old man Gao then brought up the subject of his daughter and asked me to rescue her and to apprehend you, you overstuffed coolie!” Hearing this, the monster threw away his muckrake and said with great affability, “Where is the scripture pilgrim? Please take the trouble of introducing me to him.” “Why do you want to see him?”",,"He flung the cart between the two passes, where it smashed to pieces, and hurled the bricks and timber back down the hill. “Tomorrow I will go and see the king and destroy the Taoists.” Tired of waiting for Monkey, Tripitaka now caught up with him and learned about the situation in Cart-Slow. “One Buddhist monastery in the city survived the king’s purge, because it houses a portrait of his father,” a monk-slave told them. “How about you stay there for the night?” After the pilgrims entered the city, they were shunned by everyone they encountered until they reached the Well of Wisdom Monastery, whose elderly monk kneeled before Monkey and acclaimed him his savior. “Back on your feet!” Monkey laughed. “Let’s see if I can get you some results tomorrow.” That night, though, Monkey could not sleep a wink. Around eleven o’clock, he heard gongs and flutes nearby. He quietly pulled on his clothes and leaped into the air to see what was going on. Due south, a Taoist temple was ablaze with lamps and candles. Inside a chamber hung with yellow silk brocade scrolls, three elderly priests in full ceremonial dress—Tiger-Strength, Deer-Strength, and Goat-Strength, Monkey surmised—officiated before tables groaning with sumptuous comestibles. Below them a crew of seven or eight hundred lesser Taoists were beating drums and bells, shaking incense and mumbling prayers. I feel like playing a little joke on them, Monkey thought, but I might need some backup. Better bring Pigsy and Sandy along. Monkey returned to the monastery, where Pigsy and Sandy were fast asleep in the same bed. “Get up!” Monkey whispered to Sandy. “Let’s go and have some fun.” “Sleep’s fun,” Sandy grumbled groggily. “The Taoists nearby have filled their temple with steamed buns as big as barrels and cakes weighing fifty or sixty pounds apiece.” Pigsy sat bolt upright. “Did someone say steamed buns as big as barrels?” “Don’t wake Tripitaka,” Monkey shushed him. “Just come with me.” The other two disciples quickly dressed and cloud-traveled to the temple. As soon as Pigsy saw the lights, he was all for going straight down there. “Be patient,” Monkey restrained him.","To win a fight with it requires no effort; Of course it always brings me glory. Even if you have an iron brain in a brazen head and a body of steel, This rake will scatter your souls and send your spirit flying.” Monkey put his cudgel away and replied, “Stop shooting your mouth off, you idiot. I'm now sticking my head out for you to hit. Let's see you scatter my souls and send my spirits flying.” The monster raised his rake and brought it down with all his might, but although flames leapt forth, it did not even scratch Monkey's scalp. The monster's arms and legs turned to jelly with fright as he exclaimed, “What a head, what a head.” “You wouldn't know,” Monkey replied. “When I was captured by the Little Sage for wrecking the Heavenly Palace, stealing the pills of immortality and the heavenly peaches, and filching the imperial wine, I was marched to a place outside the Dipper and Bull Palace, where all the gods of Heaven hacked at me with axes, hit me with maces, cut at me with swords, stabbed at me with daggers, tried to burn me with lightning, and pounded me with thunder; but none of it hurt me in the slightest. Then I was taken off by the Great High Lord Lao and put in the Eight Trigrams Furnace, where I was refined with divine fire, so that my eyes are now fiery, my pupils golden, my head brazen, and my shoulders of iron. If you don't believe me, try a few more blows to see whether you can hurt me or not.” “I remember you, you baboon,” the monster replied. “When you made trouble in Heaven, you lived in the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Continent of Divine Victory. I haven't heard of you for a very long time. What brings you here, and why are you bullying me in front of my own gates? Surely my father-in-law didn't go all that way to ask you to come here?” “No,” said Monkey, “he didn't. I have turned away from evil and been converted to good. I have given up Taoism and become a Buddhist. I am protecting the Patriarch Sanzang, the younger brother of the Great Tang Emperor, on his journey to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. We happened to ask for a night's lodging when we came to Gao Village, and in the course of our conversation Old Gao asked me to rescue his daughter and capture you, you chaff-guzzling moron.” The monster dropped his rake to the ground, chanted a respectful “na-a-aw,” and said, “Where's this pilgrim? Please take me to meet him.” “What do you want to see him for?”"
菩萨引众同入里面，与玉帝礼毕，又与老君、王母相见，各坐下。便问：“蟠桃盛会如何？”玉帝道：“每年请会，喜喜欢欢，今年被妖猴作乱，甚是虚邀也。”菩萨道：“妖猴是何出处？”玉帝道：“妖猴乃东胜神洲傲来国花果山石卵化生的。当时生出，即目运金光，射冲斗府。始不介意，继而成精，降龙伏虎，自削死籍。当有龙王、阎王启奏。朕欲擒拿，是长庚星启奏道：‘三界之间，凡有九窍者，可以成仙。’朕即施教育贤，宣他上界，封为御马监弼马温官。那厮嫌恶官小，反了天宫。即差李天王与哪吒太子收降，又降诏抚安，宣至上界，就封他做个‘齐天大圣’，只是有官无禄。他因没事干管理，东游西荡。朕又恐别生事端，着他代管蟠桃园。他又不遵法律，将老树大桃，尽行偷吃。及至设会，他乃无禄人员，不曾请他，他就设计赚哄赤脚大仙，却自变他相貌入会，将仙肴仙酒尽偷吃了，又偷老君仙丹，又偷御酒若干，去与本山众猴享乐。朕心为此烦恼，故调十万天兵，天罗地网收伏。这一日不见回报，不知胜负如何。”,"The Bodhisattva led the congregation into the interior, and after bowing to the Jade Emperor, met the Laojun and the Queen Mother, and sat down. Then he asked, ""How about the Pantao Festival?"" The Jade Emperor said, ""I invite the meeting every year, I like it, but this year I was disturbed by the demon monkey, which is a false invitation."" The Bodhisattva asked, ""Where did the demon monkey come from?"" The Jade Emperor said: ""The demon monkey was born from a stone egg in the Huaguo Mountain, the country proudly came from Dongsheng Shenzhou. At that time, it was born with golden light and shot into Doufu. It didn't mind at first, and then it became a spirit, subduing dragons and tigers, and cutting itself to death. When there is a dragon king, The King of Hell will play it. I want to capture it, but Chang Geng Xing plays it and said: 'Between the three realms, whoever has nine orifices can become immortals.' Official. That fellow disliked the small officials, and turned against the Heavenly Palace. That is, he sent Li Tianwang and Prince Nezha to surrender, and then sent an edict to appease them, and declared him to the upper realm, so he was named a 'Great Sage of Equaling Heaven', but he had officials but no money. Because he has nothing to do with management, he wanders around. I am afraid that there will be no trouble, so I let him take care of Pantao Garden. He also disobeys the law and steals old trees and peaches. He never invited him, so he planned to make money and coax a barefooted immortal, but he changed his appearance and joined the society. He stole all the immortal food and immortal wine, and stole Laojun's elixir and some imperial wine, and went to enjoy the monkeys in this mountain. Because of this trouble, one hundred thousand heavenly soldiers are dispatched, and the nets of heaven and earth are subdued. There is no return on this day, and I don’t know how to win or lose.”","The Bodhisattva led the crowd inside. After paying homage to the Jade Emperor, they also saluted Laozi and the Queen Mother. When each of them was seated, she asked, “How is the Grand Festival of Immortal Peaches?” “Every year when the festival has been given,” said the Jade Emperor, “we have thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. This year it has been completely ruined by a baneful monkey, leaving us with nothing but an invitation to disappointment.” “Where did this baneful monkey come from?” asked the Bodhisattva. “He was born of a stone egg on top of the Flower-Fruit Mountain of the Aolai Country of the East Pūrvavideha Continent,” said the Jade Emperor. “At the moment of his birth, two beams of golden light flashed immediately from his eyes, reaching as far as the Palace of the Polestar. We did not think much of that, but he later became a monster, subduing the Dragon and taming the Tiger as well as eradicating his name from the Register of Death. When the Dragon Kings and the Kings of the Underworld brought the matter to our attention, we wanted to capture him. The Star of Long Life, however, observed that all the beings of the three regions that possessed the nine apertures could attain immortality. We therefore decided to educate and nurture the talented monkey and summoned him to the Region Above. He was appointed to the post of Bimawen at the imperial stables, but, taking offense at the lowliness of his position, he left Heaven in rebellion. We then sent Devarāja Li and Prince Naṭa to ask for his submission by proclaiming a decree of pacification. He was brought again to the Region Above and was appointed the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven—a rank without compensation. Since he had nothing to do but to wander east and west, we feared that he might cause further trouble. So he was asked to look after the Garden of Immortal Peaches. But he broke the law and ate all the large peaches from the oldest trees. By then, the banquet was about to be given. As a person without salary he was, of course, not invited; nonetheless, he plotted to deceive the Immortal of Naked Feet and managed to sneak into the banquet by assuming the Immortal’s appearance. He finished off all the divine wine and food, after which he also stole Laozi’s elixir and took away a considerable quantity of imperial wine for the enjoyment of his mountain monkeys. Our mind has been sorely vexed by this, and we therefore sent a hundred thousand celestial soldiers with cosmic nets to capture him. We haven’t yet received today’s report on how the battle is faring.”","Guanyin said, “Since there is no banquet, pray come with me to see the Jade Emperor.” So all followed her to the Dongming Hall. There the four great barefooted Taoist immortals received them. Guanyin said, “I wish to see the Jade Emperor, may I trouble you to announce us?” A messenger went into the palace to know if they might enter. At the same time the Ancient of Days accompanied by the Queen of Heaven went there also. Guanyin then led her followers in. After having paid their respects, and having greeted the Ancient of Days and the Queen of Heaven, they all sat down and asked about the Peach Banquet. The Jade Emperor said, “Once a year we meet together for a happy banquet, but this year that monkey demon has upset everything. On this account I am greatly troubled, and have therefore sent a hundred thousand of the hosts of heaven down to earth to capture him. Today I have not received any report and do not know whether there has been a victory or not.”","After a handful of busily gossiping immortals had given her a sketchy account of what had happened, she went straight off to see the Jade Emperor, who was seated on his dais next to Laozi, with the Queen Mother behind the throne. “So what’s this business about the Peach Festival?” Guanyin asked, after exchanging greetings with the three of them. “Usually it’s the highlight of the social calendar,” complained the Jade Emperor, “but this year that demonic monkey has spoiled the whole thing. We’ve had to cancel all the invitations.” “And where did this demonic monkey spring from?” Guanyin next wanted to know. The Jade Emperor explained Monkey’s backstory: his emergence from a stone egg on top of Flower-Fruit Mountain, his radiating shafts of golden light as far as the Palace of the Polestar, and so on. “We didn’t think anything of it at the time, but then he went on to make a real pest of himself, bullying dragons, getting himself and his minions deleted from the registers of life and death. My first thought was to take him captive, but the Spirit of Longevity thought he might have potential as an immortal. Hoping to civilize this magic monkey, we therefore summoned him to Heaven and put him in charge of the imperial stables. After he absconded, claiming the job was unworthy of him, we offered him an amnesty and an honorary title, Great Sage Equal to Heaven. To keep him out of trouble, we put him in charge of the Orchard of Immortal Peaches. But he ate all the biggest peaches (without permission, I might add), smuggled himself into the peach banquet (to which he had not been invited) disguised as Barefoot here, polished off all the food and wine, stole Laozi’s elixirs, and thieved some more wine to share with his goblins down below. Since we are not amused, we have dispatched one hundred thousand soldiers with cosmic nets to bring him to heel. We’re still awaiting news from the battlefield.”","The Bodhisattva went in at the head of the others, and when she had done obeisance to the Jade Emperor she greeted Lao Zi and the Queen Mother. After they had all sat down she asked what had happened at the Peach Banquet. “The banquet is held every year, and it is normally a very happy occasion,” the Jade Emperor replied, “but this year that monkey fiend wrecked it, so that your invitation was worth nothing.” “Where does this monkey fiend come from?” asked the Bodhisattva. “He was born from a stone egg on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body,” the Jade Emperor answered. “When he was born golden beams flashed from his eyes that reached to the star palace. At first we paid no attention to him, but later on he became a spirit, subduing dragons and tigers, and erasing his own name from the registers of death. The Dragon Kings and King Yama of the underworld informed us of this in memorials, and we wanted to capture him, but the Star of Longevity memorialized that in the Three Worlds all beings with nine orifices can become Immortals. We therefore extended education to the worthy by summoning him to the upper world and appointing him Protector of the Horses in the Imperial Stable. But this was not good enough for the scoundrel, who rebelled against Heaven. We sent Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha to accept his surrender, extended him an amnesty, and summoned him back to the upper world. We made him a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' though this carried no salary. As he had nothing to do he would go wandering all over the place, and for fear that this might lead to trouble we had him look after the Peach Orchard. Once again he flouted the law by stealing and eating every single one of the big peaches from the old trees. When the banquet was to be held he was not invited as his position was purely an honorary one; so he played a trick on the Bare-foot Immortal, went to the banquet looking like him, ate all the immortal delicacies, and drank all the immortal liquor. On top of this he stole Lord Lao Zi's pills of immortality and some imperial liquor, which he took to his mountain for the monkeys to enjoy. This made us very angry so we sent a hundred thousand heavenly troops to spread heaven-and-earth nets and subdue him. But we have received no reports today, so we do not know whether we have been victorious.”"
那虎怪撑持不住，回头就走。他原来在那洞主面前说了嘴，不敢回洞，径往山坡上逃生。行者那里肯放，执着棒，只情赶来，呼呼吼吼，喊声不绝，却赶到那藏风山凹之间。正抬头，见八戒在那里放马。八戒忽听见呼呼声喊，回头观看，乃是行者赶败的虎怪，就丢了马，举起钯，刺斜着头一筑。可怜那先锋，脱身要跳黄丝网，岂知又遇罩鱼人，却被八戒一钯，筑得九个窟窿鲜血冒，一头脑髓尽流干。有诗为证，诗曰：三五年前归正宗，持斋把素悟真空。诚心要保唐三藏，初秉沙门立此功。那呆子一脚躧住他的脊背，两手轮钯又筑。行者见了，大喜道：,"The tiger monster couldn't hold it any longer and turned around and left. He had spoken in front of the cave owner and did not dare to go back to the cave, so he went straight to the hillside to escape. The pilgrims are willing to let go, stick to the stick, just love to come, huhu huhu, shouting endlessly, but they rush to the valley between the hidden winds. As he looked up, he saw that Bajie was putting his horse there. Bajie suddenly heard the whirring and shouting, and looked back to see that it was the tiger monster that the walker had defeated. Poor Pioneer, he had to jump the yellow silk net to get out, but he met the murloc again, but was smashed into nine holes with blood and blood, and his brain was drained. There is a poem as proof, the poem says: Three or five years ago, I returned to the orthodoxy, and I held fast to make the Suwu vacuum. Sincerely want to protect Tang Sanzang, Chu Bing Shaman made this contribution. The idiot slapped his back with one foot, turning his hands again and again. When the traveler saw it, he was overjoyed and said:","Not able to hold out any longer, the monster turned and fled. But since he had boasted in front of the Cave Master, he dared not go back to the cave; instead, he fled toward the mountain slope. Pilgrim, of course, would not let him go; holding his rod, he gave chase relentlessly, shouting and crying along the way. As they reached the fold of the mountain, which formed a wind break, he happened to look up, and there was Eight Rules grazing the horse. Hearing all the shouts and clamor, Eight Rules turned around and saw that it was Pilgrim chasing a defeated Tiger Monster. Abandoning the horse, Eight Rules lifted his rake and approaching from one side brought it down hard on the monster’s head. Pity that Vanguard! He hoped to leap clear of the brown-rope net, Not knowing he would meet the fisher’s coop. One blow from Eight Rules’s rake produced nine holes, from which fresh blood spurted out, and the brains of the monster’s whole head ran dry! We have a poem as a testimony for Eight Rules, which says: Returning to True Teaching some years ago, He kept a chaste diet to realize the Real Void. To serve Tripitaka is his pious wish: This, a new Buddhist convert’s first merit. Idiot put his foot on the monster’s spine and brought down the rake on him once more. When Pilgrim saw that, he was very pleased, saying, “That’s right, Brother!",,"Monkey addressed some parting words to the people of Cart-Slow: “I admit it now: I freed these monks, smashed the cart they were pulling, and pulverized their perverse Taoist masters. The lesson for you all? Don’t worship false religions and respect the unity of the three faiths. Only this will guarantee the peace and prosperity of your kingdom.” The king thanked the pilgrims once more and saw them off on the road to the west. Chapter Twenty-Eight As summer turned to autumn, the pilgrims approached the River to Heaven. After a quick aerial reconnaissance, Monkey estimated that it was at least four hundred miles wide. Just as Tripitaka was settling into a crying fit, a voice rose up from the water: “I’ll take the four of you across.” A moment later, an elderly, scabby-headed turtle emerged out of the depths and clambered onto the riverbank, revealing a huge, round white shell about forty feet in circumference. “On we get,” said Monkey.","When he could defend himself no longer, the monster turned to flee. As he had talked so boastfully in front of his chieftain he dared not return to the cave, so he tried to escape up the mountain side. Monkey, who had no intention of letting him go, chased him as fast as he could, waving his cudgel, roaring, and howling. He chased him as far as the hollow where the wind was stored, where Pig could be seen pasturing the horse. As soon as Pig heard the shouting he turned to look, and when he saw Monkey pursuing the defeated tiger monster he let go of the horse, raised his rake, and struck the tiger diagonally across the head. The poor monster, who thought he had made his way out of the silken net, never realized that he had been caught by a fish-trapper. Pig's rake made nine holes from which the blood gushed, and the brains all spurted out. There is a pome to prove it that goes: Converted to the true faith several years before, He avoided meat and was awakened to emptiness. Determined with all his heart to defend Sanzang He won this merit early in his religious life. Planting his foot in the middle of the monster's back, Pig swung the rake with both hands and smote him again. When Monkey saw this he was delighted, and he said, “That's the way, brother."
行者即纵筋斗云，径上南海。咦！那消半个时辰，早望见普陀山境。须臾间坠下筋斗，到紫竹林外，又只见那二十四路诸天，上前迎着道：“大圣何来？”行者道：“我师有难，特来谒见菩萨。”诸天道：“请坐，容报。”那轮日的诸天，径至潮音洞口报道：“孙悟空有事朝见。”菩萨正与捧珠龙女在宝莲池畔扶栏看花，闻报，即转云岩，开门唤入。大圣端肃皈依参拜，菩萨问曰：,"The walker will somersault the clouds, and go to the South China Sea. what! After half an hour, I saw Putuo Mountain. After a short while, he fell somersaults, and when he reached the Zizhu Forest, he saw the twenty-four road of heaven, who came forward to meet him and said, ""Where is the great sage?"" The heavens said: ""Please take a seat, please report."" The heavens of the sun went directly to the entrance of Chaoyin Cave to report: ""Sun Wukong has something to meet."" That is, turn to Yunyan, open the door and call in. The Great Sage Duansu took refuge and paid homage, and the Bodhisattva asked:","Pilgrim catapulted into the air with his cloud somersault and headed for the South Sea. Ah! It did not even take him half an hour before he saw the scenery of the Potalaka Mountain. In a moment, he dropped down from his somersault and arrived at the edge of the purple bamboo grove, where he was met by the Spirits of the Twenty-Four Ways. They said to him, “Great Sage, what brings you here?” “My master faces an ordeal,” said Pilgrim, “which brings me here specially to see the Bodhisattva.” “Please take a seat,” said the spirits, “and allow us to make the announcement.” One of the spirits who was on duty went to the entrance of the Tidal-Sound Cave, announcing, “Sun Wukong wishes to have an audience with you.” The Bodhisattva was leaning on the rails by the Treasure Lotus Pool, looking at the flowers with the Pearl-Bearing Dragon Princess. When she heard the announcement, she went back to the cave, opened the door, and asked that he be shown in. With great solemnity, the Great Sage prostrated himself before her.",,"Without music to block the noise, the city’s children would all perish.” “Bunk!” scoffed Monkey. “We’re still ages away from Sihali. And at the rate we’re going, we might never get there.” “Then why is it so hot?” Pigsy asked. As they walked and squabbled, they came upon a large red house at the roadside. “Go inside and find out what’s going on with the weather,” Tripitaka ordered Monkey. Putting away his staff and trying his best to look normal, Monkey approached the house just as an old man emerged.","Monkey then somersaulted off on his cloud towards the Southern Sea, and before an hour was up he saw Potaraka Island. An instant later he landed outside the Purple Bamboo Grove, where the twenty-four devas came forward to greet him with the words, “Why have you come, Great Sage?” “Because my master is in trouble,” Monkey replied, “I have come for an audience with the Bodhisattva.” The deva on duty that day asked Monkey to sit down while he went in to report, whereupon he went into the Tide Cave to announce that Sun Wukong was seeking an audience on business. The Bodhisattva was leaning on a balcony looking at the blossoms in the Precious Lotus Pool with the Dragon Princess Peng Zhu when she heard the news. She went back in her cloudy majesty, opening the door and summoning Monkey to her presence. The Great Sage greeted her with grave reverence."
行者道：“不妨！不妨！有了老孙与我这师弟，任他是甚么妖怪，不敢惹我。”正说处，又见儿子拿将饭来，摆在桌上，道声“请斋。”三藏就合掌讽起斋经，八戒早已吞了一碗。长老的几句经还未了，那呆子又吃彀三碗。行者道：“这个馕糠！好道撞着饿鬼了！”那老王倒也知趣，见他吃得快，道：“这个长老，想着实饿了，快添饭来。”那呆子真个食肠大，看他不抬头，一连就吃有十数碗。三藏、行者俱各吃不上两碗，呆子不住，便还吃哩。,"The walker said: ""It's okay! It's okay! With the old grandson and my junior brother, let him be any kind of monster, and dare not provoke me."" Just as he was talking, he saw his son bring the meal, put it on the table, and said, ""Please Zhai."" Sanzang put his palms together and satirized the Zhai Sutra, and Bajie had already swallowed a bowl. Before the elder's few sutras were finished, the idiot ate three more bowls. The traveler said: ""This naan chaff! It's a good way to bump into a hungry ghost!"" The old king was also interested, seeing that he was eating fast, and said: ""This elder, I think I'm really hungry, and I'll add some more food."" The food intestines are big, and seeing that he doesn't look up, he eats dozens of bowls in a row. Sanzang and Xingjing can't eat two bowls each, and if the idiot can't stop, they still eat it.","“No fear! No fear!” said Pilgrim. “With old Monkey and his younger brother around, we’ll never be touched, no matter what kind of monster we meet.” While they spoke, one of the sons brought out some rice and placed it on the table, saying, “Please eat.” Tripitaka immediately folded his hands to begin his grace, but Eight Rules had already swallowed a whole bowl of rice. Before the priest could say the few sentences, Idiot had devoured three more bowlfuls. “Look at the glutton!” said Pilgrim. “It’s like we’ve met a preta!” Old Wang was a sensitive person. When he saw how fast Eight Rules was eating, he said, “This honored priest must be really hungry! Quick, bring more rice!” Idiot in truth had an enormous appetite. Look at him! Without lifting his head once, he finished over ten bowls, while Tripitaka and Pilgrim could hardly finish two. Idiot refused to stop and wanted to eat still more.",,"I see inside the box . . . a ceremonial jacket and skirt.” “I see an old chipped cup,” countered Tripitaka. Just as the king was about to arrest Tripitaka for impertinence, an attendant opened the box and brought out the cup. “Who put this here?” barked the furious king. “I put a jacket and skirt inside,” said the queen. “How could they have been replaced by this cup?”","“Certainly, certainly,” said Monkey. “With me, my master and my fellow-disciple, no devils, however fierce, will dare to provoke us.” As he spoke the youth came in with food, which he put on the table with the words, “Please eat.” Sanzang put his hands together and started to recite the grace. By then Pig had already swallowed a bowlful, and the moron finished three more before the short prayer was over. “What a chaff-guzzler,” said Monkey. “We do seem to have run into a hungry ghost.” Old Wang, however, found the speed at which Pig ate very amusing, and said, “This reverend gentleman must be very hungry. Give him more rice at once.” The stupid creature indeed had a large stomach. Look at him, keeping his head down as he devours at least a dozen bowls. Sanzang and Monkey had not been able to finish two bowls, but the idiot would not stop and was still eating."
只见那小仙报道：“师父，油锅滚透了。”大仙教“把孙行者抬下去！”四个仙童抬不动，八个来，也抬不动，又加四个，也抬不动。众仙道：“这猴子恋土难移，小自小，倒也结实。”却教二十个小仙，扛将起来，往锅里一掼，烹的响了一声，溅起些滚油点子，把那小道士们脸上烫了几个燎浆大泡！只听得烧火的小童喊道：“锅漏了！锅漏了！”说不了，油漏得罄尽，锅底打破，原来是一个石狮子放在里面。大仙大怒道：“这个泼猴，着然无礼！教他当面做了手脚！你走了便罢，怎么又捣了我的灶？这泼猴枉自也拿他不住，就拿住他，也似抟砂弄汞，捉影捕风。,"I saw that Xiaoxian reported: ""Master, the oil pan is boiling."" Daxian taught, ""Take Sun Xingzhe down!"" Can't lift. All the immortals said: ""This monkey loves the soil and can't be moved. He is very strong since he was a child."" But he taught twenty little immortals, picked them up, threw them into the pot, made a sound of cooking, and splashed some boiling oil ideas. , burned the faces of the little Taoist priests with a few big bubbles of smoldering pulp! The little boy who could only hear the fire shouted, ""The pot is leaking! The pot is leaking!"" Daxian said angrily: ""This monkey is so rude! Teach him to do tricks in front of his face! If you leave, why did you smash my stove again? This monkey can't hold him in vain, so just hold him. , It is also like rubbing sand to get mercury, catching shadows and chasing wind.","Just then, one of the little immortals gave this report, “Master, the oil is sizzling in the pan.” “Pick up Pilgrim Sun and throw him in!” said the Great Immortal. Four of the divine lads went to carry him, but they could not lift him up; eight more joined them, but they had no success either. They added four more, and still they could not even budge him. “This monkey loves the earth so much that he can’t be moved!” said one of the immortals. “Though he may be rather small, he’s quite tough!” Finally, twenty little immortals managed to lift him up and hurl him into the pan; there was a loud splash, big drops of boiling oil flew out in every direction, and the faces of those little Daoists were covered with blisters. Then they heard the lad who was tending the fire crying, “The pan’s leaking! The pan’s leaking!” Hardly had he uttered these words when all the oil was gone. What they saw in the pan with its bottom punctured was a stone lion. Enraged, the Great Immortal said, “That wretched ape! He’s wicked indeed! And I’ve allowed him to show off right in front of my nose! So, he wanted to escape, but why did he have to ruin my pan? I suppose it’s exceedingly difficult to catch the wretched ape, and even if one does catch him, trying to hold him is like trying to grasp sand or handle mercury, to catch a shadow or seize the wind!",,"The Buddha turned first to Tripitaka, “In a previous incarnation you were my second-favorite disciple. But because you didn’t pay attention in one of my lectures, I demoted you to reincarnation in the east. Fortunately, you kept the faith by undertaking a journey of 108,000 miles to bring Buddhist teachings back to China. I therefore appoint you Sandalwood Buddha. “Now, Monkey. We didn’t get off to the best of starts, what with your urinating on my hand and my pinning you beneath the Five-Phases Mountain for five hundred years. Since then, however, you have embraced my teachings and truly distinguished yourself in defeating demons. For your unwavering loyalty, I appoint you Buddha Victorious in Struggle. “Pigsy, you were once a water god of the Heavenly River, banished to the mortal world and reincarnated as a pig after you got drunk and propositioned the moon goddess. Fortunately, you converted to Buddhism and protected Tripitaka on his journey here. Unfortunately, you remained susceptible to greed and lust. Nonetheless, in recognition of your service carrying the bags, I’m still going to give you a job: Altar Service Attendant.” “What?” spluttered Pigsy. “They’re both Buddhas!","It was just at this moment that the junior Immortals reported, “The oil's boiling hard.” “Carry Monkey down to it,” the Great Immortal ordered, but when four of them tried to pick him up they could not. Eight then tried and failed, and four more made no difference. “This earth-infatuated ape is immovable,” they said. “He may be small, but he's very solid.” Twelve junior Immortals were then told to pick him up with the aid of carrying-poles, and when they threw him in there was a loud crash as drops of oil splashed about, raising blisters all over the junior Immortals' faces. “There's a hole in the cauldron—it's started leaking,” the scalded Immortals cried, but before the words were out of their mouths the oil had all run out through the broken bottom of the cauldron. They realized that they had thrown a stone lion into it. “Damn that ape for his insolence,” said the Great Immortal in a terrible rage. “How dare he play his tricks in my presence! I don't mind so much about your getting away, but how dare you wreck my cauldron? It's useless trying to catch him, and even if you could it would be like grinding mercury out of sand, or trying to hold a shadow or the wind."

拿与你，你不认得。”行者道：“这呆子笑话我老孙。老孙五百年前，因访仙道时，也曾云游在海角天涯，那般儿不曾见？”八戒道：“哥啊，人参果你曾见么？”行者惊道：“这个真不曾见。但只常闻得人说，人参果乃是草还丹，人吃了极能延寿。如今那里有得？”八戒道：“他这里有。那童子拿两个与师父吃，那老和尚不认得，道是三朝未满的孩儿，不曾敢吃。那童子老大惫懒，师父既不吃，便该让我们，他就瞒着我们，才自在这隔壁房里，一家一个，啯啅啯啅的吃了出去，就急得我口里水泱。怎么得一个儿尝新？我想你有些溜撒，去他那园子里偷几个来尝尝，如何？”行者道：“这个容易，老孙去手到擒来。”急抽身，往前就走，八戒一把扯住道：“哥啊，我听得他在这房里说，要拿甚么金击子去打哩。须是干得停当，不可走露风声。”行者道：“我晓得，我晓得。”,"Take it with you, you do not recognize it. ""Walker said:"" This idiot is laughing at my grandson. Five hundred years ago, when the old grandson visited the immortal way, he also traveled around the corners of the sea. Haven't seen him like that? ""Bajie said: ""Brother, have you ever seen ginseng fruit? The traveler said in surprise: ""I have never seen this before."" But I often hear people say that ginseng fruit is a grass-returning pill, and people eat it to prolong life. Where is it now? ""Bajie said:"" He has it here. The boy took two to eat with the master, but the old monk didn't recognize it. Dao was a child before three dynasties and never dared to eat it. The eldest boy was tired and lazy. Master didn't want to eat, so he should let us. He hid it from us, so he sat in the next room, one by one, and ate it out, making my mouth water in urgency. How to get a new one? I think you're a little rambunctious, go steal some from his garden and try it, how about that? The walker said: ""This is easy, Lao Sun will go and capture it. He pulled away in a hurry and walked forward. Bajie grabbed it and said, ""Brother, I heard him say in this room that he would use some kind of gold hammer to beat him."" It must be done properly, and it must not be exposed to the wind. The walker said: ""I know, I know. ""","“I can tell you,” said Eight Rules with a laugh, “but you have never seen it; I can put it before you, but you won’t recognize it.” “You must be joking, Idiot,” said Pilgrim. “Five hundred years ago, when I, old Monkey, searched for the Way of Immortality, I went all the way to the corner of the ocean and the edge of the sky. What can there be that I have never seen?” “Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “have you ever seen the ginseng fruit?” Somewhat startled, Pilgrim said, “That I really have never seen! But I have heard that ginseng fruit is the grass of the reverted cinnabar. When a man eats it, his life will be prolonged. But where can one get ahold of it?” “They have it here,” said Eight Rules. “The two lads brought two of these fruits for Master to eat, but that old monk could not recognize them for what they were. He said that they were infants not yet three days old and dared not eat them. The lads themselves were quite disobliging; if Master would not eat, they should have given them to us. Instead, they hid them from us. Just now in the room next door, each had a fruit to himself and finished it with great relish. I got so excited that I was drooling, wondering how I could have a taste of this fruit. I know you are quite tricky. How about going to their garden and stealing a few for us to have a taste of them?” “That’s easy,” said Pilgrim. “Old Monkey will go, and they will be at the reach of his hands!” He turned quickly and began to walk to the front. Eight Rules caught hold of him and said, “Elder Brother, I heard them talking in the room, and they mentioned something about using a gold mallet to knock down the fruits. You must do it properly, and without being detected.” “I know! I know!” exclaimed Pilgrim.",,"Monkey laughingly introduced himself and explained the deception, revealing that Tripitaka and the other two disciples were back at the postal station. The grateful king asked the others to be brought to court. Just as Tripitaka was thinking how nice it would be not to wear a mud mask lubricated with pig ’s urine, he heard a voice outside: “The King of Bhikku wishes to thank you at court.” “Cheer up!” exulted Pigsy. “I don’t think they want your heart this time. Monkey must have triumphed!” “But how can I return to the court with this stinky face on me?” “We’ll have to get Monkey’s help on that,” admitted Pigsy. “Heavens above! What a bunch of horrors!” quavered the courtiers when the three of them emerged into the courtyard. “Sandy and I were born like this,” Pigsy explained. “But our master here will look much better once he’s exfoliated.” As soon as they entered the throne room, Monkey ran up and with one magic breath restored Tripitaka to his true self. While the king gushed at Tripitaka—Buddha this, Buddha that —Monkey remained focused on the here and now. “Do you have that fiend’s address? I must destroy him so that he doesn’t come back to make any more trouble.” “I did ask him that when he first arrived three years ago,” the embarrassed king replied. “He said he was from nearby—the village of Pure Magnificence on Willow Hill, about seventy miles south of here.” “Oh, and on the subject of missing persons: I was the one who hid the little boys,” Monkey told him, smiling, “on the compassionate orders of my master.","“I can't describe it because you've never seen it,” said Pig, “and if I gave it to you, you wouldn't know what it was.” “Don't try to make a fool of me, idiot,” said Monkey. “When I studied the Way of Immortality five hundred years ago I traveled on my cloud to the comers of the ocean and the edge of the sky. I've seen everything.” “Have you seen manfruit then?” Pig asked. “No, I haven't,” said Monkey with astonishment. “But I've heard that manfruit is Grass-returning Cinnabar, and that anyone who eats it lives to a great old age. Where can we get some?” “Here,” said Pig. “Those boys gave two to our master, but that old monk didn't know what they were and thought they were newborn babies. He wouldn't eat them. Those boys are disgraceful—instead of giving them to us as they should have done they sneaked off into their room and had one each, gobble, gobble, gobble—I was drooling. I wish I knew how I could try one. Surely you've got some dodge for getting into the orchard and pinching a few for us to taste. You have, haven't you?” “Easy,” said Monkey. “I'll go in and pick some.” As he rushed out Pig grabbed him and said, “I heard them saying in their room that they needed a golden rod to knock them down with. You must do this very carefully—nobody must know about it.” “I know, I know,” replied Monkey."
茶毕，行者回头一看，见后壁上挂著一幅圯桥进履的画儿。行者道：“这是甚么景致？”龙王道：“大圣在先，此事在后，故你不认得。这叫做圯桥三进履。”行者道：“怎的是三进履？”,"After the tea, the traveler looked back and saw a picture of a bridge walking on the back wall hanging on the back wall. The walker said: ""What is this scene?"" The dragon king said: ""The great sage comes first, and this matter comes later, so you don't recognize it. This is called the three-entry shoe on the bridge."" The walker said: ""What is the three-entry shoe?""","When they finished the tea, Pilgrim happened to turn around and saw hanging behind him on the wall a painting on the “Presentation of Shoes at Yi Bridge.” “What’s this all about?” asked Pilgrim. The Dragon King replied, “The incident depicted in the painting took place some time after you were born, and you may not recognize what it was—the threefold presentation of shoes at Yi Bridge.” “What do you mean by the threefold presentation of shoes?” asked Pilgrim.","This time all three disciples believed it was their Master’s. They wept bitterly and reverently buried it. Leaving Sha the Monk to take care of the grave and the baggage, Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie determined to take revenge on the demons for their Master’s death. The demon led out all his forces against them, but Sun, plucking out some of his hairs, changed them into monkeys like himself, each armed with a terrible spear. They killed numbers of demons, so that the chief fled to his cave.","We won’t see head nor tail of him for a good while now.” “Cool it, half-wit,” said Monkey amiably. “Let’s have another word with Tripitaka.” “You must be exhausted,” Tripitaka comforted Pigsy when the two of them returned. “What shall we do now?” “It’s getting late,” said Monkey.","When he had drunk his tea, Monkey looked round and saw a picture called, “Presenting the Shoe at the Yi Bridge” hanging on the wall behind him. “What's that a view of?” asked Monkey. “You wouldn't know about it because it happened after your time,” the dragon king replied. “It's called 'Presenting the Shoe Three Times at the Yi Bridge.'” “What's all that about?” Monkey asked."

It was like A brass pan meeting an iron broom, A jade gong facing a golden bell.",,"Leaving Sandy with the horse, Monkey and Pigsy leaped back to the stone screen. “Stay here,” Monkey instructed Pigsy. “I’m going in first to find out whether the fiend assaulted Master during the night. If he lost his virtue to her, the pilgrimage is off.","Although he is only a pilgrim fetching scriptures His unrestrained anger bursts against the sky. Such was the chaos that the fishes lost their scales, While the soft shells of terrapins were crushed; Red prawns and purple crabs all lost their lives, And all the gods of the water palace prayed to heaven. The only sound was the thunder of crashing waves; Sun and moon were dark, to the horror of earth and sky. They battled on for four hours, but the issue was still undecided. It was as if a brass pan was fighting an iron brush, or a jade chime was competing with a golden bell."
观音闻言。即与木吒撞上南天门里。早有丘、张二天师接着，问道：“何往？”菩萨道：“贫僧要见玉帝一面。”二天师即忙上奏。玉帝遂下殿迎接。菩萨上前礼毕道：“贫僧领佛旨上东土寻取经人，路遇孽龙悬吊，特来启奏，饶地性命，赐与贫僧，教他与取经人做个脚力。”五帝闻言，即传旨赦宥，差天将解放，送与菩萨。菩萨谢恩而出。这小龙叩头谢活命之恩，听从菩萨使唤。菩萨把他送在深涧之中，只等取经人来，变做白马，上西方立功。小龙领命潜身不题。,"Guanyin heard the words. That is, they collided with Mu Zha into Nantianmenli. Qiu and Zhang Ertian Master followed up and asked, ""Where are you going?"" The Bodhisattva said, ""The poor monk wants to see the Jade Emperor."" Ertian Master hurriedly played. The Jade Emperor came down to greet him. The Bodhisattva stepped forward and bowed, saying: ""The poor monk took the Buddha's decree and went to the Eastern Land to find a person who can get the scriptures. On the way, he encountered an evil dragon and hung it. He came here to perform the music, spare his life, and gave it to the poor monk to teach him and the person who got the scriptures to be strong. ""When the five emperors heard the words, they sent a decree to pardon you, and sent the heavens to liberate them and send them to the Bodhisattva. Bodhisattva thanked him. This little dragon kowtowed to thank him for his life, and obeyed the call of the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva sent him into a deep stream, just waiting for the person who took the scriptures to come, turn him into a white horse, and go to the west to make meritorious deeds. Xiaolong leads the order and dives without a problem.","When Guanyin heard these words, she rushed with Mokṣa up to the South Heaven Gate. She was received by Qiu and Zhang, the two Celestial Masters, who asked her, “Where are you going?” “This humble cleric needs to have an audience with the Jade Emperor,” said the Bodhisattva. The two Celestial Masters promptly made the report, and the Jade Emperor left the hall to receive her. After presenting her greetings, the Bodhisattva said, “By the decree of Buddha, this humble cleric is journeying to the Land of the East to find a scripture pilgrim. On the way I met a mischievous dragon hanging in the sky. I have come specially to beg you to spare his life and grant him to me. He can be a good means of transportation for the scripture pilgrim.” When the Jade Emperor heard these words, he at once gave the decree of pardon, ordering the Heavenly sentinels to release the dragon to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva thanked the Emperor, while the young dragon also kowtowed to the Bodhisattva to thank her for saving his life and pledged obedience to her command. The Bodhisattva then sent him to live in a deep mountain stream with the instruction that when the scripture pilgrim should arrive, he was to change into a white horse and go to the Western Heaven. The young dragon obeyed the order and hid himself, and we shall speak no more of him for the moment.","Judge Cui followed and protected the emperor. They passed through a dark office, which was not the way they had come. Then the emperor said to the Judge, “We have surely lost the way.” The Judge replied, “No. There is only one way to reach Hell and there is no return from it. Now we shall take your Majesty through the starting place for transmigration, in order, on the one hand, to let you see the underworld, and, on the other, to let your Majesty escape the round of transmigration.” So the emperor had to follow these two men for some li. Then he saw a high mountain with dark clouds covering the bottom with mist. The emperor asked, “What mountain is that?” The Judge said, “It is the Chilly Side of the Shadow of Death.” The emperor was afraid, and said, “How can I pass that way?” The Judge said, “Your Majesty need not fear! We will lead the way.”","Please save me, Guanyin!” The Bodhisattva and her disciple immediately dashed up to Heaven to intervene with the Jade Emperor. “While traveling east, on a mission from the Buddha to find a pilgrim to seek scriptures in the west, I’ve encountered a disorderly dragon awaiting execution. I beg you to spare his life so that he can carry my pilgrim to the Buddha.” The Jade Emperor promptly agreed to the pardon and allowed the dragon to go off with Guanyin, who sent him to live in a mountain stream. She ordered him to turn into a white horse when the pilgrim passed by, and to expiate his crimes on the journey to the west.","When she heard his plea the Bodhisattva went in through the Southern Gates of Heaven with Moksa. Here they were met by the Heavenly Teachers Qiu and Zhang, who asked them, “Where are you going?” “I would like an audience with the Jade Emperor.” The two Heavenly Teachers hurried in to announce her, and the Jade Emperor came out of his palace to receive her. The Bodhisattva went forward to greet him and said, “On my way to the East on the orders of the Buddha to find the man to fetch the scriptures, I met a wicked dragon suspended in mid-air.. I have come here especially to ask you to spare his life and give him to me so that I can teach him to serve the pilgrim with his legs.” On hearing this the Jade Emperor issued a decree pardoning him, and he sent a heavenly general to release him and give him to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva thanked him for his generosity and left. The young dragon kowtowed to show how grateful he was for having his life spared, and he obediently did what the Bodhisattva told him to. She took him to a deep ravine, where he was to wait until the pilgrim came. When that happened he was to turn into a white horse and achieve merit by going to the Western Heaven. On receiving his orders the young dragon hid himself."

Do you know who he is? Lingtong's original taboo name is Jin Chan, just because he has no intention to listen to the Buddha's teachings, he turns to the world to suffer and suffer, and he is born into the world and caught in the net. When you are reincarnated, you will meet the evil, and before you come out, you will face the evil party. His father was Chen Zhuangyuan from Haizhou, and his grandfather was the head of the dynasty. Born to be a prisoner of falling river stars, he followed the waves with the waves. Jinshan on the island has a great relationship, and the monk Qian'an raised him. At the age of eighteen, he recognized his mother and went to Kyoto to seek foreign minister. The general manager opened up the mountain to transfer the army, and Hongzhou suppressed the bandits and executed the murderous party. The champion Guangrui took off Tianluo, and his son and father met to celebrate the award. Fu Ye now receives the grace of the Lord, and the sages of Lingyan Pavilion are famous. Enguan was not willing to become a monk, and the monk Hongfu visited him. The small characters are ancient Buddha children, and the legal name is Chen Xuanzang. On that day, Master Xuanzang was presented to the audience. This man has been a monk since childhood, he was born from his mother's womb, and he fasted and took the precepts. His grandfather saw Yin Kaishan, the general manager of the dynasty, and his father Chen Guangrui, the champion of the middle school, and the official worshiper of Wenyuan Palace. He does not love glory and splendor, but only likes to practice annihilation. It was found that his roots were good and his virtue was high. Thousands of scriptures, all can be understood: the Buddha's name is Xianyin, and nothing is impossible. At that time, the three of them were led to the front of the imperial court, and they danced and danced, and after paying their respects, they said, ""Chen Yu and others have received the imperial decree and have chosen Chen Xuanzang, an eminent monk."" When Taizong heard his name, he pondered for a long time and said, ""Is it Xuanzang, the son of the scholar Chen Guangrui?"" Jiang Liu'er kowtowed and said, ""This is my minister."" Taizong said happily, ""It is indeed a good move, and I am a monk with virtue and Zen. ."" Xuanzang nodded his thanks and received the title of Dachan. He also gave a multicolored woven gold cassock and a Pilu hat. Teach him to pay homage to the Ming monks again, to be the leader of the next Chali class, to write the will of the office, to go to Huasheng Temple, to choose an auspicious day and a good time, and to perform the scriptures. Xuanzang bowed to the decree again, and then went to Huasheng Temple to gather many monks, build a meditation couch, decorate the merits, and arrange the music. A total of 1,200 monks, both large and small, were selected and assigned to three halls, the upper, middle and lower halls. In front of all the Buddhas, the objects are all in the same order, and the heads are different. It is selected on the third day of September of this year, the good day of Huang Dao, to start the water and land conference on July 7, 49. That is to say, after the presentation was made, Taizong and his relatives and relatives of the Wenwu Kingdom all attended the meeting due to the deadline, and listened to the lecture. After all, I don't know what the holy will is, so let's listen to the decomposition next time.","The next day the three court officials began the process of selection at the Mountain-River Altar, and from among the priests gathered there they chose an illustrious monk of great merit. “Who is this person?” you ask. Gold Cicada was his former divine name. As heedless he was of the Buddha’s talk, He had to suffer in this world of dust, To fall in the net by being born a man. He met misfortune as he came to Earth, And evildoers even before his birth. His father: Chen, a zhuangyuan from Haizhou. His mother’s sire: chief of this dynasty’s court. Fated by his natal star to fall in the stream, He followed tide and current, chased by mighty waves. At Gold Mountain, the island, he had great luck, For the abbot, Qian’an,8 raised him up. He met his true mother at age eighteen, And called on her father at the capital. A great army was sent by Chief Kaishan To stamp out at Hongzhou the vivious crew. The zhuangyuan Guangrui escaped his doom: Son rejoined sire—how worthy of praise! They saw the emperor to receive his grace; Their names resounded in Lingyan Tower.9 Declining office, he chose a monk’s life At Hongfu Temple to seek the true Way, This old Buddha-child, nicknamed River Float, With a religious name of Chen Xuanzang. So that very day the multitude selected the priest Xuanzang, a man who had been a monk since childhood, who maintained a vegetarian diet, and who had received the commandments the moment he left his mother’s womb. His maternal grandfather was Yin Kaishan, one of the chief army commanders of the present dynasty. His father, Chen Guangrui, had taken the prize of zhuangyuan and was appointed Grand Secretary of the Wenyuan Chamber. Xuanzang, however, had no love for glory or wealth, being dedicated wholly to the pursuit of Nirvāṇa. Their investigations revealed that he had an excellent family background and the highest moral character. Not one of the thousands of classics and sūtras had he failed to master; none of the Buddhist chants and hymns was unknown to him. The three officials led Xuanzang before the throne. After going through elaborate court ritual, they bowed to report, “Your subjects, in obedience to your holy decree, have selected an illustrious monk by the name of Chen Xuanzang.” Hearing the name, Taizong thought silently for a long time and said, “Can Xuanzang be the son of Grand Secretary Chen Guangrui?” Child River Float kowtowed and replied, “That is indeed your subject.” “This is a most appropriate choice,” said Taizong, delighted. “You are truly a monk of great virtue and possessing the mind of Chan. We therefore appoint you the Grand Expositor of the Faith, Supreme Vicar of Priests.” Xuanzang touched his forehead to the ground to express his gratitude and to receive his appointment. He was given, furthermore, a cassock of knitted gold and five colors, a Vairocana hat,10 and the instruction diligently to seek out all worthy monks and to rank all these ācāryas11 in order. They were to follow the imperial decree and proceed to the Temple of Transformation,12 where they would begin the ritual after selecting a propitious day and hour. Xuanzang bowed again to receive the decree and left. He went to the Temple of Transformation and gathered many monks together; they made ready the beds, built the platforms, and rehearsed the music. A total of one thousand two hundred worthy monks, young and old, were chosen, who were then further separated into three divisions occupying the rear, middle, and front portions of the hall. All the preparations were completed and everything was put in order before the Buddhas. The third day of the ninth month of that same year was selected as the lucky day, when a Grand Mass of Land and Water lasting forty-nine days (in accordance with the number seven times seven) would begin. A memorial was presented to Taizong, who went with all his relatives and officials, both civil and military, to the Mass on that day to burn incense and listen to the lecture. We have a poem as testimony.","They said, “Sir, we dare not go far, lest they attempt to seize you and there will be trouble.” “Since you think so, I will give you a charm for your protection.” So saying the Great Sage pulled out some hairs, and gave one to each to put on his ring finger, and to hold firmly. “If any one attempts to catch you, hold firmly to this, call out “Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven,” and I will come and save you, though I should be ten thousand miles away.” Some of them tried the charm and, sure enough, he stood before them like the God of Thunder. In his hand was an iron club so that an army of ten thousand men and horses could not get near him. After this about a hundred monks came up together and said, “There are a hundred Great Sages protecting us!” They kowtowed to Sun and said, “It is perfectly marvelous how your magic works!” So Sun went off to see the king to find out what was going on. The king said, “Our country is suffering from drought, and although there are charges against you of murdering two Taoist priests, setting free five hundred slaves, and desecrating our temple, we will forgive you if you can bring rain. Can you do better than the Taoists? I will go to the top of the Five Phoenix Hall to watch you. First the Taoists will show their skill.” The Taoist priest who was the Royal Wizard followed the king into the gallery while the Master and his disciples remained below. A messenger came running in to say that everything was ready for the altar. The Royal Wizard said, “When you hear my first signal, the wind will come, at my second signal, the clouds will come, at my third signal, thunder and lightning will follow, at my fourth signal, rain will come, at my fifth signal, the clouds and rain will cease.” He mounted a platform about fifty feet high, all round which were banners with illustrations of the Twenty-eight Constellations. In the middle was a table, and on it was an incense burner and candles. Beside them was a golden tablet on which was written, “God of Thunder.” Below these were five big jars full of clean water. Floating on the water were willow branches on which was an iron tablet whereon was written, “The Charm of the Master of the Thunder Hall.” On the right and left were five boards on which were written the names of the Mistress of the Wind and the Master of Thunder. Beside each board there stood two Taoist priests each holding an iron banner. Behind them there were a great many Taoist fortunetellers and writers of charms. A small Taoist presented the Great Wizard with a book of charms written on yellow paper and with a precious sword. The Wizard pronounced an incantation, took a charm and burnt it in a candle. Then he tapped the table as the first signal. Truly enough, at once it began to blow. Sun, at this, whispered to his companions, “Do not speak to me for some time, as I am going to attend to some private business.” The Great Sage then plucked a hair and changed it into his own form to remain there by his Master, while he himself mounted the clouds and shouted out, “Mistress of the Wind, what are you doing? Instead of helping me, who is going to fetch the Sacred Scriptures from the West, you are helping a demon! Bid the wind to cease or I will give you twenty blows with my steel staff!’”","“That does sound good,” admitted the emperor. “And the staff?” “A former prop of immortals, it laughs at the very idea of old age.” Taizong insisted on buying both for Xuanzang. But Guanyin refused payment, in recognition of the emperor’s devotion to good works. When the emperor tried to thank her with a vegetarian banquet, she also declined and returned happily to her temple lodging. The emperor immediately summoned Xuanzang to the palace to try on the robe. It fit him perfectly. The seventh day, the conclusion of the mass, swiftly arrived, and the emperor returned to the temple, followed by most of the capital’s population. “Let’s go and see what all the fuss is about,” Guanyin said to Hui’an, “and whether this monk deserves our treasures and what he actually knows about Buddhism.” When they arrived, Xuanzang was busy preaching about this and that: now the sutra of Life and Deliverance for the Dead, now the Heavenly Chronicle of Peace, now the Scroll of Merit Through Self-Cultivation. Pushing her way to the front, Guanyin thumped the platform. “Hey, you up there!” she heckled. “So you know a thing or two about Hinayana, the lesser vehicle of Buddhist enlightenment. But what can you tell me about Mahayana, the great vehicle?” Xuanzang gladly jumped off the platform from which he had been speaking, to salute his challenger. “We know nothing of Mahayana. Please tell us more!” “Hinayana is the doctrine of the confused; its followers will never ascend to Heaven. Only the Mahayana can break the endless cycles of transmigration.","The next day the three court officials assembled all the monks at the altar among rivers and hills, and they went through them all one by one. From among them they chose a venerable and virtuous monk. Do you know who he was? Fully versed in the basic mystery, his title was Golden Cicada; But because he did not want to hear the Buddha preach He transferred to the mortal world to suffer torment, Was born among the common mortals to fall into the net. From the moment he entered the womb he met with evil, Before he left it he encountered a gang of villains. His father was Top Graduate Chen from Haizhou, His grandfather a senior imperial commander. His birth offended the meteor that dropped into the water, He drifted with the current and followed the waves. Jinshan Island had a great destiny: The abbot Qian'an brought him up. Only at seventeen did he meet his mother, And go to the capital to find his grandfather. Commander Yin Kaishan, raising a great army, Wiped out and punished the bandits at Hongzhou. Graduate Chen Guangrui escaped from the heavenly net, And father and son were happily reunited. Accepting the invitation he receives once more the monarch's grace, And his fame is spread as he climbs the lofty tower. Refusing to take office he wants to be a monk, So as sramana of the Hongfu Temple he learns about the Way, The child of an ancient Buddha who used to be called Jiangliu, And took the dharma-name of Chen Xuanzang. That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. Investigation revealed that his origins were good and his virtue great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know; he could sing every Buddhist chant and knew all the religious music. The three officials took him to the imperial presence, where they danced and stirred up the dust. When they had bowed they reported, “Your subject Xiao Yu and the rest of us have chosen a venerable monk called Chen Xuanzang in obedience to the imperial decree.” On hearing his name Taizong thought deeply for a long time and then asked, “Is that the Xuanzang who is the son of Grand Secretary Chen Guangrui?” “Your subject is he,” replied Xuanzang with a kowtow. “Then you were indeed well chosen,” said the Emperor with satisfaction. “You are indeed a monk of virtuous conduct of a mind devoted to meditation. I give you the offices of Left Controller of the Clergy, Right Controller of the Clergy, and Hierarch of the Empire.” Xuanzang kowtowed to express his thanks and accepted the appointments. The Emperor then gave him a multicolored golden cassock and a Vairocana miter, telling him to be sure he conscientiously continued to visit enlightened monks, and giving him the position at the top of the hierarchy. He gave him a decree in writing ordering him to go to the Huasheng Temple to pick a propitious day and hour on which to begin the recitations of the scriptures. Xuanzang bowed, took the decree, and went to the Huasheng Temple where he assembled many monks, had meditation benches made, prepared for the mass, and chose the music. He selected a total of twelve hundred high and humble monks of enlightenment, who he divided into an upper, a middle and a lower hall. All the holy objects were neatly arranged before all the Buddhas. The third day of the ninth month of that year was chosen an auspicious day on which to start the seven times seven days of the Great Land and Water Mass. This was all reported to the throne, and at the appointed time Taizong, the high civil and military officials, and the royal family went to the service to burn incense and listen to the preaching. There is a poem to prove it that goes:"
有一《蝶恋花》词为证，词曰：烟波万里扁舟小，静依孤篷，西施声音绕。涤虑洗心名利少，闲攀蓼穗蒹葭草。数点沙鸥堪乐道，柳岸芦湾，妻子同欢笑。一觉安眠风浪俏，无荣无辱无烦恼。”,"There is a poem ""Butterfly Loves Flowers"" as evidence. Cleanse and wash the heart, fame and fortune are few, and leisurely climb the Polygonum paniculata. Counting the sand gulls, Kanle Road, Liuan Luwan, and his wife laughing together. A good night's sleep, no glory, no shame, no troubles. ""","In a small boat o’er ten thousand miles of misty waves I lean to the silent, single sail, Circled by sounds of the mermaid-fish. My mind cleansed, my care purged, here lacks wealth or fame; Leisurely I pick stems of bulrushes and reeds. Counting the seagulls is pleasure to be told! At willowed banks and reeded bays My wife and son join my joyous laugh. I sleep most soundly as wind and wave recede; No shame, no glory, nor any misery.”","Sun cried out, “Tell me what your skill is, and hand your weapons over to me, or I will kill you, false demon!” The demon was defeated, of course, and told Sun, “Since I was born, I have been stupid and loved ease, night and day.","To decide the matter, they engaged in a poetry duel—each exchanging poems to extol the beauty of their preferred natural feature. One would praise seagulls and crabs; the other craggy peaks and mountain tea.","Listening to the voice of Xishi the beauty. My thoughts and mind are cleared; I have no wealth or fame As I toy with the waterweed and the rushes. “To count a few gulls makes the journey happy. In the reedy bend, under the willow bank, My wife and children smile with me. The moment I fall asleep, wind and waves are quiet; No glory, no disgrace, and not a single worry.”"
“阿弥陀佛！既是偷了四个，怎么只拿出三个来分，预先就打起一个偏手？”那呆子倒转胡嚷。二仙童问得是实，越加毁骂。就恨得个大圣钢牙咬响，火眼睁圆，把条金箍棒揝了又揝，忍了又忍道：“这童子这样可恶，只说当面打人也罢，受他些气儿，等我送他一个绝后计，教他大家都吃不成！”好行者，把脑后的毫毛拔了一根，吹口仙气，叫“变！”变做个假行者，跟定唐僧，陪着悟能、悟净，忍受着道童嚷骂；他的真身出一个神，纵云头跳将起去，径到人参园里，掣金箍棒往树上乒乓一下，又使个推山移岭的神力，把树一推推倒。可怜叶落枒开根出土，道人断绝草还丹！那大圣推倒树，却在枝儿上寻果子，那里得有半个？原来这宝贝遇金而落，他的棒刃头却是金裹之物，况铁又是五金之类，所以敲着就振下来，既下来，又遇土而入，因此上边再没一个果子。他道：“好！好！好！大家散火！”他收了铁棒，径往前来，把毫毛一抖，收上身来。那些人肉眼凡胎，看不明白。,"""Amitabha! Since he stole four, how come he only took out three to share, and then played a partial hand in advance?"" The idiot yelled backwards. Er Xiantong asked the truth and cursed even more. He hated so much that the great sage gritted his teeth, his fire eyes widened, he slammed the golden hoop stick and endured it, and said, ""This boy is so abhorrent, it's just a matter of hitting people in the face, I'll be a little angry with him. Wait until I give him a plan, and teach him that everyone can't eat it!"" The good traveler plucked a hair from the back of his head, blew a fairy breath, and called ""Change!"" Wu Neng and Wu Jing, endured the scolding of the Taoist boy; his real body was a god, he jumped up with the head of the cloud, went straight to the ginseng garden, pinged the tree with the golden cudgel, and pushed the mountain again. Ling's divine power pushed the tree down. Poor Ye Luoya rooted and unearthed, the Taoist cut off the grass and returned the pill! The great sage knocked down the tree, but searched for fruit on the branches, where must there be half? It turned out that this treasure fell when it met gold, but the tip of his stick was wrapped in gold, and iron was also metal, so it vibrated when it was knocked, and when it came down, it also fell into the soil, so there was no fruit on it. . He said, ""Good! Good! Good! Let's all spread the fire!"" Those people are mortal to the naked eye and cannot see it.","“Amitābha Buddha!” said Eight Rules. “If you stole four of them, why did you only bring out three for us to divide among ourselves? Didn’t you skim something off the top already?” So saying, Idiot began to make a fuss again. When the immortal lads found out the truth, they became even more abusive in their language; the Great Sage became so enraged that he ground his steel-like teeth audibly and opened wide his fiery eyes. He gripped his golden-hooped rod again and again, struggling to restrain himself and saying to himself, “These malicious youths! They certainly know how to give people a lashing with their tongues! All right, so I have to take such abuse from them. Let me offer them in return ‘a plan for eliminating posterity,’ and none of them will have any more fruit to eat!” Dear Pilgrim! He pulled off a strand of hair behind his head and blew on it with his magic breath, crying “Change!” It changed at once into a specious Pilgrim, standing by the Tang Monk, Wujing, and Wuneng to receive the scolding from the Daoist lads. His true spirit rose into the clouds, and with one leap he arrived at the ginseng garden. Whipping out his golden-hooped rod, he gave the tree a terrific blow, after which he used that mountain-moving divine strength of his to give it a mighty shove. Alas, Leaves fell, limbs cracked, and roots became exposed; The Daoists lost their grass of reverted cinnabar. After the Great Sage had pushed down the tree, he tried to look for the fruits on the branches but he could not find even half a fruit. The treasure, you see, would fall when it met with gold, and both ends of his rod were wrapped in gold. Moreover, iron is also one of the five metallic elements. The blow of the rod, therefore, shook loose all the fruits from the tree, and when they fell, they became assimilated to the earth once they touched the ground, so that there was not a single fruit left on the tree. “Fine! Fine!” he said. “Now all of us can scram!” He put away his iron rod and went back to the front. With a shake of his body he retrieved his hair, but the rest of the people, like those of fleshly eyes and mortal stock, could not perceive what had taken place.",,"“Is that authorized?” the celestial being queried. “I understand that three conditions have to be met first.” “I know. But the Four Heavenly Preceptors also told me that the prefect could expiate his offense through religious devotion. The inhabitants of the city have been ostentatiously holy for the past three days, and a courier has just delivered their documents of repentance to the Jade Emperor.” “In that case,” replied the minister, “the four thunder dukes and the Dame of Lightning are yours for the day.” In the sky above Phoenix-Immortal, Monkey conducted the dignitaries as they generated flashes of purple-gold light and deafening peals of thunder. The locals—who had not seen anything like this for three long years—fell to their knees and cried out to the Buddha. While Monkey conducted this display, the courier delivered the piety reports to the throne room. “And what of the Three Impossible Challenges?” the Jade Emperor now asked. “The rice and noodles have vanished,” a minion from the Hall Draped with Fragrance reported, “and the lock is broken.” “I hereby order,” pronounced the emperor, “the Departments of Wind, Cloud, and Rain to release three feet and forty-two drops of rain.” Once the Four Heavenly Preceptors had liaised with the departments in question, the magic bureaucracy released a torrent over Phoenix-Immortal: it was as if whole rivers and seas were pouring from the sky. The streets ran with water; dying plants and trees revived. After every single drop of the allotted rain had fallen, Monkey choreographed a round of thanks to the thunder-, lightning-, and rain-spirits. “Step out from the clouds and reveal yourselves,” he told the divine administrators, “so that they will lavish you with sacrifices.”","“Amitabha Buddha,” exclaimed Pig, “if he pinched four of them why did he only share out three? He must have done the dirty on us.” He continued to shout wildly in this vein. Now that they knew that the fruit really had been stolen, the two boys started to abuse them even more foully. The Great Sage ground his teeth of steel in his fury, glaring with his fiery eyes and tightening his grip on his iron cudgel. “Damn those Taoist boys,” he thought when he could restrain himself no longer. “If they'd hit us we could have taken it, but now they're insulting us to our faces like this, I'll finish their tree off, then none of them can have any more fruit.” Splendid Monkey. He pulled a hair out from the back of his head, breathed a magic breath on it, said “Change,” and turned it into an imitation Monkey who stayed with the Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand to endure the cursing and swearing of the Taoist boys, while the real Monkey used his divine powers to leap out of the hall by cloud. He went straight to the garden and struck the manfruit tree with his gold-banded cudgel. Then he used his supernatural strength that could move mountains to push the tree over with a single shove. The leaves fell, the branches splayed out, and the roots came out of the ground. The Taoists would have no more of their “Grass-returning Cinnabar.” After pushing the tree over Monkey searched through the branches for manfruit, but he could not find a single one. These treasures dropped at the touch of metal, and as Monkey's cudgel was ringed with gold, while being made of iron, another of the five metals, one tap from it brought them all tumbling down, and when they hit the ground they went straight in, leaving none on the tree. “Great, great, great,” he said, “that'll make them all cool down.” He put the iron cudgel away, went back to the front of the temple, shook the magic hair, and put it back on his head. The others did not see what was happening as they had eyes of mortal flesh."
“朕才命太医院去进药，不知何如。”便教妃嫔入宫去请。那宫主在里面乱嚷道：“我吃甚么药？这里那是我家！我家是清凉瓦屋，不象这个害黄病的房子，花狸狐哨的门扇！放我出去！放我出去！”正嚷处，只见四五个女官，两三个太监，扶着他，直至殿上。唐王道：“你可认得你丈夫么？”玉英道：“说那里话，我两个从小儿的结发夫妻，与他生男育女，怎的不认得？”唐王叫内官搀他下去。那宫主下了宝殿，直至白玉阶前，见了刘全，一把扯住道：“丈夫，你往那里去，就不等我一等！我跌了一跤，被那些没道理的人围住我嚷，这是怎的说！”那刘全听他说的话是妻之言，观其人非妻之面，不敢相认。唐王道：“这正是山崩地裂有人见，捉生替死却难逢！”好一个有道的君王，即将御妹的妆奁、衣物、首饰，尽赏赐了刘全，就如陪嫁一般，又赐与他永免差徭的御旨，着他带领御妹回去。他夫妻两个，便在阶前谢了恩，欢欢喜喜还乡。有诗为证：人生人死是前缘，短短长长各有年。刘全进瓜回阳世，借尸还魂李翠莲。他两个辞了君王，径来均州城里，见旧家业儿女俱好，两口儿宣扬善果不题。,"""I just ordered the Tai Hospital to take medicine, but I don't know what to do."" Then he taught the concubines to go to the palace to invite them. The palace lord shouted: ""What medicine do I take? This is my home! My home is a cool tiled house, not like this yellow-blighted house with fancy doors! Let me out! Let me out!"" Just as he was shouting, he saw four or five female officials and two or three eunuchs, supporting him up to the hall. Tang Wang said: ""Do you recognize your husband?"" Yuying said, ""Speaking of that, my two husbands and wives have been married since childhood, and they have sons and daughters with him, why don't you recognize them?"" Tang Wang asked the internal officials to help him down. . The palace lord went down to the palace and went to the front of the white jade steps. When he saw Liu Quan, he grabbed him and said, ""Husband, if you go there, don't wait for me! I fell and was surrounded by those unreasonable people. Stop me and shout, what is this!"" Then Liu Quan heard that what he said was the words of his wife, and he didn't dare to recognize him because he was not his wife. Tang Wang said: ""This is the landslide and the ground is cracked by some people, but it is rare to catch life instead of death!"" What a wise king, he is about to reward Liu Quan with his sister's makeup, clothing, and jewelry, just like a dowry. He also gave him the imperial decree that he would never be sent away, and asked him to lead the imperial sister back. He and his wife thanked them in front of the steps and returned home happily. There are poems as proof: life and death are the front lines, and the short and the long have their own years. Liu Quan entered the melon and returned to the Yang World, and revived Li Cuilian by borrowing the corpse. The two of them resigned from the king and went straight to the city of Junzhou. Seeing that the old family business and children were all good, the two of them preached the good fruit.","“We just asked the court dispensary to send in some medicine,” said the Tang emperor, “for we don’t know what’s happening.” Some ladies of the court went to fetch the princess, and they found her inside, screaming, “Why do I need to take any medicine? How could this be my house? Ours is a clean, cool house of tiles, not like this one, yellow as if it had jaundice, and with such gaudy appointments! Let me out! Let me out!” She was still shouting when four or five ladies and two or three eunuchs took hold of her and led her outside to the court. The Tang emperor said, “Do you recognize your husband?” “What are you talking about?” said Yuying. “The two of us were pledged to each other since childhood as husband and wife. I bore him a boy and a girl. How could I not recognize him?” The Tang emperor asked one of the palatial officials to help her go down from the Treasure Hall. The princess went right before the steps of white jade, and when she saw Liu Quan, she grabbed him, saying, “Husband, where have you been? You didn’t even wait for me! I tripped and fell, and then I was surrounded by all these crazy people, talking nonsense! What do you have to say to this?” Liu Quan heard that she was speaking like his wife, but the person he saw certainly did not resemble her, and he dared not acknowledge her to be his own. The Tang emperor said, “Indeed, Men have seen mountains cracking, or the gaping of earth; But none has seen the living exchanged for the dead!” What a just and kindly ruler! He took his sister’s toilet boxes, garments, and jewelry and bestowed them all on Liu Quan; it was as if the man was provided with a dowry. He was, moreover, exempted forever from having to engage in any compulsory service to the Crown, and was told to take the royal sister back to his home. So, husband and wife together expressed their gratitude before the steps and returned happily to their village. We have a testimonial poem: How long, how short—man has his span of years; He lives and dies, each foreordained by fate. Liu Quan presented melons and returned to life; In someone’s body so did Li, his mate. The two of them took leave of the emperor, went directly back to Junzhou, and saw that both house and children were in good order. They never ceased thereafter to proclaim the rewards of virtue, but we shall speak of them no further.","“That is a small matter,” said Sun. “What else can they do?” “They can manufacture the Pill of Immortality, and change stone into gold.” Sun said, “These are also small matters, common to many. How did these Taoists deceive your king?” “The king reads prayers with them night and day, expecting to attain permanent life without death. In this way the king believes in them.” “Since things are in this state, why do you not all go away?” “Sir, you do not know that we cannot go away, for the king has authorized a picture of every one of us to be made, and these are hung up everywhere. The Country of Slow Carts is extensive with prefectures, counties, and market places, and a picture of the Buddhist monks is in each place, with a notice saying that any official who catches a runaway monk will be promoted three degrees, and that every non-official who catches a monk will get fifty taels. This is signed with the king’s own hand. Thus you see we are helpless.” Then said Sun, “You might as well die and end it all.” They replied, “A great many have died. We monks in this country at one time numbered over two thousand, but we perish in our sufferings. Six or seven hundred have already died, seven or eight hundred have committed suicide. There now remain only about five hundred of us and we cannot die. Ropes cannot strangle us, swords cannot cut us, we plunge into the river to drown ourselves, but float on top instead of sinking; we take poison, but it does not kill us.” Sun said, “Then you are favored, you are all immortals.”","“So that’s why my sister was acting so strangely just now. Her soul has been replaced by that of Liu Quan’s wife. Of course!” In another part of the palace, the revived princess was making her presence felt. “I don’t need any medicine! And who chose those garish yellow tiles all over this place? And those vulgar decorations? Let me out!” A team of palace ladies and eunuchs guided her to the throne room, where Taizong asked if Liu Quan was her husband. “We were betrothed as children, and I’m the mother of his son and daughter. Of course he’s my husband!” She now turned to Liu Quan. “Where did you run off to? Why didn’t you wait for me? I tripped while trying to keep up, and the next thing I knew, I was surrounded by all these crazy people.” Liu Quan had no idea how to respond: this woman sounded exactly like his wife but looked nothing like her. Taizong now stepped in, declaring that the living, his sister Yuying, had been exchanged for the dead, Cuilian. He gifted Liu Quan with all of his sister’s clothes, jewelry, and cosmetics, exempted him from any future conscriptions, and sent the happy couple back to their home, where—reunited with their children—they lived happily and virtuously ever after. Having cleared up this confusing business of resurrection-substitution, Taizong turned his attention to the grand Buddhist mass that he had promised the hungry ghosts he had encountered in the Region of Darkness. A heated court debate ensued about whether Buddhism constituted a corrupting foreign faith that urged gullible believers to focus on the possible rewards of a later existence rather than on the here and now; that undermined social hierarchies, between ruler and subject, father and son.","“We have just ordered the Imperial Medical Academy to send some medicine, so we don't know whether it will be possible,” said the Tang Emperor, who then sent a consort into the palace to ask her to come out. The princess, meanwhile, was shouting wildly inside the palace, “I'm taking none of your medicine. This isn't my home. My home is a simple tiled house, not like this jaundiced, yellow place with its flashy doors. Let me out, let me out.” Four of five women officials and two or three eunuchs appeared while she was shouting and helped her go straight to the throne hall, where the Tang Emperor asked, “Would you recognize your husband if you saw him?” “What a thing to ask! We've been married since we were children, and I've given him a son and a daughter, so of course I'd recognize him.” The Emperor told his attendants to help her down and she went down from the throne hall. As soon as she saw Liu Quan in front of the white jade steps she seized hold of him. “Husband!” she exclaimed, “where did you go? Why didn't you wait for me? I tripped over, and all these shameless people surrounded me and shouted at me. Wasn't that shocking?” Although Liu Quan could hear that it was his wife talking, she looked like somebody else, so he did not dare to recognize her as his wife. “Indeed,” said the Emperor, “Sometimes mountains collapse and the earth yawns open, But few men will shorten their lives to die for another.” As he was a good and wise monarch he gave all of the princess' dressing-cases, clothes and jewelry to Liu Quan as if they were a dowry, presented him with an edict freeing him from labor service for life, and told him to take the princess home with him. Husband and wife thanked him before the steps and returned home very happily. There is a poem to prove it: Life and death are pre-ordained; Some have many years, others few. When Liu Quan came back to the light after taking the pumpkins, Li Cuilian returned to life in a borrowed body. After leaving the Emperor the pair went straight back to the city of Junzhou, where they found that their household and their children were all well. There is no need to go into how the two of them publicized their virtue rewarded."

一朝，王母娘娘设宴，大开宝阁，瑶池中做“蟠桃胜会”，即着那红衣仙女、素衣仙女、青衣仙女、皂衣仙女、紫衣仙女、黄衣仙女、绿衣仙女，各顶花篮，去蟠桃园摘桃建会。七衣仙女直至园门首，只见蟠桃园土地、力士同齐天府二司仙吏，都在那里把门。仙女近前道：“我等奉王母懿旨，到此携桃设宴。”土地道：“仙娥且住。今岁不比往年了，玉帝点差齐天大圣在此督理，须是报大圣得知，方敢开园。”仙女道：“大圣何在？”土地道：“大圣在园内，因困倦，自家在亭子上睡哩。”仙女道：“既如此，寻他去来，不可延误。”土地即与同进。寻至花亭不见，只有衣冠在亭，不知何往。四下里都没寻处。原来大圣耍了一会，吃了几个桃子，变做二寸长的个人儿，在那大树梢头浓叶之下睡着了。七衣仙女道：“我等奉旨前来，寻不见大圣，怎敢空回？”旁有仙吏道：“仙娥既奉旨来，不必迟疑。我大圣闲游惯了，想是出园会友去了。汝等且去摘桃，我们替你回话便是。”那仙女依言，入树林之下摘桃。先在前树摘了二篮，又在中树摘了三篮；到后树上摘取，只见那树上花果稀疏，止有几个毛蒂青皮的。原来熟的都是猴王吃了。七仙女张望东西，只见南枝上止有一个半红半白的桃子。青衣女用手扯下枝来，红衣女摘了，却将枝子望上一放。原来那大圣变化了，正睡在此枝，被他惊醒。大圣即现本相，耳朵内掣出金箍棒，幌一幌，碗来粗细，咄的一声道：“你是那方怪物，敢大胆偷摘我桃！”慌得那七仙女一齐跪下道：“大圣息怒。我等不是妖怪，乃王母娘娘差来的七衣仙女，摘取仙桃，大开宝阁，做‘蟠桃胜会’。适至此间，先见了本园土地等神，寻大圣不见。我等恐迟了王母懿旨，是以等不得大圣，故先在此摘桃，万望恕罪。”大圣闻言，回嗔作喜道：“仙娥请起。王母开阁设宴，请的是谁？”仙女道：“上会自有旧规。请的是西天佛老、菩萨、罗汉，南方南极观音，东方崇恩圣帝，十洲三岛仙翁，北方北极玄灵，中央黄极黄角大仙，这个是五方五老。还有五斗星君，上八洞三清、四帝、太乙天仙等众，中八洞玉皇、九垒、海岳神仙，下八洞幽冥教主、注世地仙。各宫各殿大小尊神，俱一齐赴蟠桃嘉会。”大圣笑道：“可请我么？”仙女说：“不曾听得说。”大圣道：“我乃齐天大圣，就请我老孙做个尊席，有何不可？”仙女道：“此是上会会规，今会不知如何。”大圣道：“此言也是，难怪汝等。你且立下，待老孙先去打听个消息，看可请老孙不请。”,"One day, the Queen Mother held a banquet, opened the treasure pavilion, and held a ""Peach Victory Meeting"" in the Yaochi, that is, the red-clothed fairy, the plain-clothed fairy, the green-clothed fairy, the soap-clothed fairy, the purple-clothed fairy, the yellow-clothed fairy, and the green-clothed fairy. For each flower basket, go to the Peach Garden to pick peach and build a meeting. The seven-clothed fairy went to the gate of the garden, and saw the land of Pantao Garden, Li Shi and the immortal officials of the Second Division of Qitian Mansion, all of which were there to hold the gate. The fairy approached and said: ""I am waiting for the decree of the Queen Mother to come here to hold a banquet with peaches."" The land said: ""Xian'e, stay here. This year is not as old as in previous years. When the great sage knows, he dares to open the garden."" The fairy said, ""Where is the great sage?"" The earth said, ""The great sage is in the garden, and because of sleepiness, he sleeps on the pavilion."" The fairy said, ""If that's the case, go find him. Come, without delay."" The land is the same as the advance. Xun to the flower pavilion, only the clothes and crown are in the pavilion, and I don't know where to go. Nowhere to be found. It turned out that the great sage played for a while, ate a few peaches, turned into a man two inches long, and fell asleep under the thick leaves on the top of the big tree. Seven-clothed fairy said: ""I'm waiting for the order to come, but if I can't find the Great Sage, how dare I come back empty-handed?"" An immortal officer next to him said, ""Since Xian'e has come under the order, there is no need to hesitate. My Great Sage is used to wandering, thinking It was out of the garden to meet friends. You wait to go pick peaches, and we will answer for you."" The fairy followed her words and went into the woods to pick peaches. First, I picked two baskets from the front tree, and then three baskets from the middle tree. When I picked it from the back tree, I saw that the flowers and fruits on the tree were sparse, and there were only a few hairy green skins. It turned out that the cooked ones were eaten by the Monkey King. The seven fairies looked around and saw a half-red and half-white peach on the southern branch. The woman in blue ripped off the branch with her hands, and the woman in red picked it, but looked up at the branch. It turned out that the great sage had changed, was sleeping on this branch, and was awakened by him. The Great Sage immediately showed his true appearance, and he put a golden hoop stick in his ear, made a guise, the thickness of the bowl, and said in a loud voice: ""You are that monster, dare to steal my peaches!"" The seven fairies knelt together in panic. He said next: ""The Great Sage calms his anger. I am not a monster, but a seven-clothed fairy sent by the Queen Mother to pick up the peaches, open the treasure pavilion, and make a 'Peach Victory Club. , I can’t find the great sage. I’m afraid I will be late for the Queen Mother’s decree, so I can’t wait for the great sage, so I will pick peaches here first, and I hope to forgive my sins.” The great sage heard the words and replied with anger and joy: “Xian’e, please get up. The Queen Mother opened the pavilion for a banquet, who did you invite?"" The fairy said: ""The meeting has its own old rules. The people invited are Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats in the West, Antarctic Guanyin in the South, Emperor Chong'en in the East, and Immortals on the Three Islands in the Ten Continents. Weng, the northern arctic mysterious spirit, the central Huangji and Huangjiao Daxian, this is the Wufang Wulao. There are also Wudouxingjun, Shangbadong Sanqing, Sidi, Taiyi Tianxian, etc., Zhongbadong Jade Emperor, Jiuli , Haiyue Immortal, the sect master of Xiabadong Netherworld, and the Earth Immortal. All the gods and goddesses in each palace and hall will all go to the Pantao Festival."" The Great Sage smiled and said, ""Can you invite me?"" The fairy said, ""I have never heard of it. I have to say it."" The great sage said, ""I am the great sage of Equaling the sky, so why not invite my grandson to be a high-ranking seat?"" The fairy said, ""This is the rule of the meeting, and I don't know what to do now."" Great sage Said: ""This is also true, no wonder you and others. You stand up and wait for the old grandson to inquire about the news first, and see if the old grandson can be invited.""","One day the Lady Queen Mother decided to open wide her treasure chamber and to give a banquet for the Grand Festival of Immortal Peaches, which was to be held in the Palace of the Jasper Pool. She ordered the various Immortal Maidens—Red Gown, Blue Gown, White Gown, Black Gown, Purple Gown, Yellow Gown, and Green Gown—to go with their flower baskets to the Garden of Immortal Peaches and pick the fruits for the festival. The seven maidens went to the gate of the garden and found it guarded by the local spirit, the stewards, and the ministers from the two departments of the Equal to Heaven Residence. The girls approached them, saying, “We have been ordered by the Queen Mother to pick some peaches for our banquet.” “Divine maidens,” said the local spirit, “please wait a moment. This year is not quite the same as last year. The Jade Emperor has put in charge here the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, and we must report to him before we are allowed to open the gate.” “Where is the Great Sage?” asked the maidens. “He is in the garden,” said the local spirit. “Because he is tired, he is sleeping alone in the arbor.” “If that’s the case,” said the maidens, “let us go and find him, for we cannot be late.” The local spirit went into the garden with them; they found their way to the arbor but saw no one. Only the cap and the robe were left in the arbor, but there was no person to be seen. The Great Sage, you see, had played for a while and eaten a number of peaches. He had then changed himself into a figure only two inches high and, perching on the branch of a large tree, had fallen asleep under the cover of thick leaves. “Since we came by imperial decree,” said the Seven-Gown Immortal Maidens, “how can we return empty-handed, even though we cannot locate the Great Sage?” One of the divine officials said from the side, “Since the divine maidens have come by decree, they should wait no longer. Our Great Sage has a habit of wandering off somewhere, and he must have left the garden to meet his friends. Go and pick your peaches now, and we shall report the matter for you.” The Immortal Maidens followed his suggestion and went into the grove to pick their peaches. They gathered two basketfuls from the trees in front and filled three more baskets from the trees in the middle. When they went to the trees at the back of the grove, they found that the flowers were sparse and the fruits scanty. Only a few peaches with hairy stems and green skins were left, for the fact is that the Monkey King had eaten all the ripe ones. Looking this way and that, the Seven Immortal Maidens found on a branch pointing southward one single peach that was half white and half red. The Blue Gown Maiden pulled the branch down with her hand, and the Red Gown Maiden, after plucking the fruit, let the branch snap back up into its position. This was the very branch on which the transformed Great Sage was sleeping. Startled by her, the Great Sage revealed his true form and whipped out from his ear the golden-hooped rod. One wave and it had the thickness of a rice bowl. “From what region have you come, monsters,” he cried, “that you have the gall to steal my peaches?” Terrified, the Seven Immortal Maidens knelt down together and pleaded, “Let the Great Sage calm himself! We are not monsters, but the Seven-Gown Immortal Maidens sent by the Lady Queen Mother to pluck the fruits needed for the Grand Festival of Immortal Peaches, when the treasure chamber is opened wide. We just came here and first saw the local spirit of the garden, who could not find the Great Sage. Fearing that we might be delayed in fulfilling the command of the Queen Mother, we did not wait for the Great Sage but proceeded to pluck the peaches. We beg you to forgive us.” When the Great Sage heard these words, his anger changed to delight. “Please arise, divine maidens,” he said. “Who is invited to the banquet when the Queen Mother opens wide her treasure chamber?” “The last festival had its own set of rules,” said the Immortal Maidens, “and those invited were: the Buddha, the Bodhisattvas, the holy monks, and the arhats of the Western Heaven; Kuan-yin from the South Pole; the Holy Emperor of Great Mercy of the East; the Immortals of Ten Continents and Three Islands; the Dark Spirit of the North Pole; the Great Immortal of the Yellow Horn from the Imperial Center. These were the Elders from the Five Quarters. In addition, there were the Star Spirits of the Five Poles, the Three Pure Ones, the Four Deva Kings, the Heavenly Deva of the Great Monad, and the rest from the Upper Eight Caves. From the Middle Eight Caves there were the Jade Emperor, the Nine Heroes, the Immortals of the Seas and Mountains; and from the Lower Eight Caves, there were the Pope of Darkness and the Terrestrial Immortals. The gods and devas, both great and small, of every palace and mansion, will be attending this happy Festival of the Immortal Peaches.” “Am I invited?” asked the Great Sage, laughing. “We haven’t heard your name mentioned,” said the Immortal Maidens. “I am the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven,” said the Great Sage. “Why shouldn’t I, old Monkey, be made an honored guest at the party?” “Well, we told you the rule for the last festival,” said the Immortal Maidens, “but we do not know what will happen this time.” “You are right,” said the Great Sage, “and I don’t blame you. You all just stand here and let old Monkey go and do a little detection to find out whether he’s invited or not.”","Now it happened that the Queen of Heaven had a birthday that day, and had provided a great banquet in one of her palaces on the lake. This was called the Peach Banquet, and for this she sent seven companies of fairies in various uniforms of red, blue, grey, black, purple, yellow, and green ornamented with flowers on their heads, to gather peaches from the orchard. The seven companies of fairies arrived at the orchard and found the servants watching at the gate. They said, “We have come by order of the Queen of Heaven to fetch peaches for the Peach Banquet.” The servants replied, “Just wait a little. This year is not the same as before. The Jade Emperor has appointed the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven, to guard the orchard. We must go in and announce you to him.” The Queen of Heaven. The fairies asked, “Where is he?” The servants replied, “He is inside the orchard sleeping in the pavilion.” “Go and fetch him and be quick about it,” ordered the fairies. The servants went on to the pavilion, but could not find him. His clothes were there, but he was gone. It happened that the Great Sage, after eating some peaches, had suddenly transformed himself into a man only two inches in height, and was sleeping amongst the leaves on one of the branches of a tree. The servants returned to say they could not find him. The seven companies of fairies replied, “We came in obedience to the Queen’s command. How can we go back empty handed?” Some of the servants standing by said, “Since you fairies have come in obedience to the Queen, and there is no doubt of her command, you had better go in and pluck the peaches yourselves. The Great Sage must have wandered out of the orchard to visit his friends.” They went in and found very few peaches, and those that were there were hairy and green. The Monkey had eaten all the ripe ones. The fairies looked East and West and only on the South found a few partly eaten remnants, some red and some white. The blue fairies pulled a branch down. It was on this branch that the Great Sage was sleeping. The red fairies picked the fruit and then let go of the branch. This sudden jerk woke the Great Sage and he resumed his original natural size. He pulled out of his ear the steel needle, which grew as large as a beam, and cried out fiercely, “What fiends you are to dare to come and steal my peaches!” At this sight the seven bands of fairies fell down on their knees and begged him not to be angry, saying, “We are not fiends, but are fairies sent by the Queen of Heaven to get peaches for her banquet. When we arrived, you could not be found anywhere. Fearing to be late, we came in to pick some fruit. Pray forgive us.” On hearing this, the Great Sage ceased his anger and smiled, saying, “Rise! Whom has the Queen of Heaven invited to the Banquet?” The fairies replied, “Those invited are, according to ancient custom, the Buddha of the Western Heaven, the bodhisattvas, the arhats, Guanyin of the Southern Ocean, The Merciful Emperor of the East, the Venerable Immortals of the Ten Provinces and Three Islands, the Mystic Divinity of the North Pole, the Great Immortal of the Center, The Five Elders of the Five Regions. Besides these, are the Prince of the Five Northern Stars, Spirits of the Upper Eight Caves, the Three Pure Ones, the Four Rulers and the Heavenly Immortal called the Great Beginning. There are also the Jade Emperor and the Gods of the Nine Mountains and Seas of the Middle Eight Caves, the King of Hell, the Dark Teacher of the Lower Eight Caves, the Spirits of the Earth. All the Major and Minor Deities of all the Halls and Palaces will meet at the banquet to congratulate the Queen.” The Great Sage laughed and asked, “Am I invited?” The fairies replied that they did not know. The Great Sage said, “I am the Great Sage, Equal of Heaven. Why should I not have been invited among the honored guests?” “These are those who have been invited in the past. We do not know who are invited now,” replied the fairies. “I do not blame you,” he said. “Wait a little and let me go and enquire.”","Time passed in this delicious way until one morning the Queen Mother decided to host a Great Grand Festival of Immortal Peaches in her Palace of the Jade Pool and ordered her immortal ladies-in-waiting—Red Gown, Blue Gown, White Gown, Black Gown, Purple Gown, Yellow Gown, and Green Gown—to pick peaches for the event. As they approached the orchard gate, they spotted the local spirit, his gardeners, and Monkey’s aides standing outside and explained the purpose of their visit. “Hold on,” the spirit replied. “There’s been a change of management around here. The Jade Emperor has put the Great Sage Equal to Heaven in charge and we have to report to him before opening the gate.” “Where is he right now?” asked one of the ladies. “Inside, napping in a pavilion.” “Then we’ll go and find him. We mustn’t keep our mistress waiting.” The spirit escorted them in, but only Monkey’s robe and cap were to be found inside the pavilion—for after removing them to climb up and pilfer a few peaches, our Great Sage had shrunk himself to two inches tall and was busy snoozing amid the dense foliage at the crown of a tree. “What should we do?” asked one of the ladies. “The Great Sage often wanders off,” advised one of his aides. “He must have left to meet a friend. You go ahead and pick your peaches; we’ll let him know you were here.” Weaving in and out of the trees, the ladies-in-waiting managed to pick two baskets from the trees at the front and three from the middle rows, but there were hardly any peaches on the trees at the back—and these thin pickings were green and hard, for of course Monkey had eaten all the ripe fruit. After a long, hard search, they finally spotted a red and white peach on a south-facing branch. Green Gown pulled it near, then—after Red Gown had picked the fruit—let the branch snap back into position. As chance would have it, tiny Monkey had been sleeping on that very branch, and the twanging motion startled him awake. He instantly grew back to his normal size, pulled the iron out from behind his ear, and grew it to the thickness of a cudgel. “How dare you steal my peaches, you disgusting fiends!” he roared. The seven ladies huddled together in terror. “Don’t be angry, Great Sage,” they begged. “We’re the Queen Mother’s ladies-in-waiting. She sent us to pick peaches for her festival. Because the orchard spirit couldn’t find you, we decided to get on with picking the peaches. Forgive us!” Monkey’s rage instantly melted into delight. “Enchanting news. And who, may I ask, has the Queen Mother invited?” “From past experience: the Buddha, the Bodhisattvas, the holy monks and the arhats of the west, Guanyin from the South Pole, the Holy Emperor of Highest Mercy from the East, the ancient immortals of the Ten Continents and Three Islands, the Dark Spirit of the North Pole, and the Great Immortal of the Yellow Horn of the Imperial Center. Then there’ll be the Five Elders from the Five Quarters, the Star Spirits of the Five Poles, the Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors, the Heavenly Deva of the Great Monad, and everyone else from the Upper Eight Caves. From the Middle Eight Caves, she’ll have invited the Jade Emperor, the Nine Heroes, the Spirits of Seas and Mountains, and then the Pope of Darkness, and the Earthly Immortals from the Lower Eight Caves. Pretty much anyone who’s anyone.” “And how about me?” Monkey smiled. “She’s not mentioned you as such.” “I am the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, you know,” explained Monkey. “The party won’t be the same without me.”","One day the Queen Mother arranged a banquet, opening many precious pavilions for a feast of peaches by the Jade Pool. She sent the Red Fairy, the Blue Fairy, the White Fairy, the Black Fairy, the Purple Fairy, the Yellow Fairy, and the Green Fairy to the Peach Orchard with their baskets to pick peaches for the feast. The seven fairies went straight to the orchard gates, the workmen of the orchard and the immortal superintendents of the two offices of the Equaling Heaven Residence were guarding the gate. The fairies went up to them and said, “We have come on the orders of the Queen Mother to pick peaches for a feast.” “Wait a moment please, Immortal Beauties,” said the local god. “Things are different this year. The Jade Emperor has appointed the Great Sage Equaling Heaven to be the guardian of this orchard, and we must ask him before we can open the orchard to you.” “Where is the Great Sage?” the fairies asked, and the local god replied, “Inside the orchard. As he was feeling tired he is having a nap by himself in a summerhouse.” “In that case, please find him without delay,” requested the fairies, and the local god took them into the orchard. But all they could find of him in the summerhouse were his hat and clothes. They had no idea where he could have gone, and looked everywhere without success. The Great Sage had in fact made himself only two inches long after eating some of the peaches for fun, and he was sleeping under a large leaf at the top of one of the big trees. “We have come by decree, and we can't go back empty-handed, although the Great Sage is nowhere to be found,” said the fairies. One of the immortal superintendents who was standing nearby replied, “As you Immortal Beauties have come by order of the Queen Mother, we must not delay you. Our Great Sage is always wandering off, so I expect that he has gone away to visit some of his friends. You had better pick the peaches; it will be all right if we inform him.” The fairies did as he suggested and went into the orchard to pick peaches. First they filled two baskets from the trees in front, and then they picked three basketfuls from the trees in the middle; but when they came to the trees at the back, they saw that peaches and blossoms were few and far between. Only a few unripe fruits with furry stalks and green skins were left. All the ripe ones had been eaten up by the Monkey King. The seven fairies looked everywhere, but all they could see was a single red and white peach on a Southern branch. The Blue Fairy pulled the branch down, the Red Fairy picked the peach, and then they let the branch go again. This woke up the Great Sage, who had changed himself into this peach to take a nap on this branch. He resumed his own form, took his gold-banded cudgel from his ear, shook it till it was as thick as a ricebowl, and shouted at them, “Where are you from, you thieving fiends?” The seven fairies fell on their knees in confusion. “Please don't be angry with us, Great Sage. We're not fiends but seven fairies sent by Her Majesty the Queen Mother of the West to pick peaches of immortality and open the precious halls here for a Feast of Peaches. When we arrived here we saw the local god and other deities of the place, but we could not find you, Great Sage. We could not delay carrying out the Queen Mother's orders, so we went ahead and picked the peaches without waiting for you, Great Sage. We very much hope that you will forgive us.” These words turned the Great Sage's bad mood into a good one, and he said, “Please rise, Fairy Beauties. Who is the Queen Mother inviting to this feast?” “There are old rules about who attends: The Buddha of the Western Heaven, Bodhisattvas, holy monks, Arhats, the Guanyin of the South Pole, the Merciful and Sage Emperor of the East, the Venerable Immortals of the Ten Continents and the Three Islands, the Mystic Divinity of the North Pole, and the Great Yellow-horned Immortal of the Yellow Pole at the Centre. These make up the Five Venerable Ones of the Five Regions. There will also be the Star Lords of the Five Constellation; the Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors and the Heavenly Immortal of the Great Monad from the Eight High Caves; the Jade Emperor, the immortals of the Nine Mounds, and the gods of the Seas and Mountains and the Ruler of the Nether World from the Eight Lower Caves; and the terrestrial deities. All the major and minor gods of all the halls and palaces will come to the Feast of Peaches.” “Will I be invited?” asked the Great Sage with an ingratiating smile. “Not as far as we've heard,” the fairies replied. “I'm the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, so why shouldn't I be asked?” said the Great Sage. “That was what happened before: we don't know about this time,” the fairies replied. “You're right,” he said. “Just wait here while I go and find out whether I'm invited.”"

莫念！管寻还了袈裟！”那众僧见了，一个个战兢兢的，上前跪下劝解，三藏才合口不念。行者一骨鲁跳起来，耳朵里掣出铁棒，要打那些和尚，被三藏喝住道：“这猴头！你头痛还不怕，还要无礼？休动手！且莫伤人！再与我审问一问！”众僧们磕头礼拜，哀告三藏道：“老爷饶命！我等委实的不曾看见。这都是那老死鬼的不是。他昨晚看着你的袈裟，只哭到更深时候，看也不曾敢看，思量要图长久，做个传家之宝，设计定策，要烧杀老爷。自火起之候，狂风大作，各人只顾救火，搬抢物件，更不知袈裟去向。”,"Don't miss it! Guan Xun returned the cassock! When all the monks saw this, they were all trembling and knelt down to persuade them, but Sanzang didn’t say anything. ""This monkey head! You are not afraid of a headache, but also rude? Hugh hands! And don't hurt anyone! Interrogate me again! The monks kowtowed and prayed to Sanzang, ""Sir, forgive me!"" I've honestly never seen it. It's all that old bastard, isn't it? He looked at your cassock last night, but when he cried even deeper, he never dared to look at it. When the fire broke out, the wind was blowing, everyone only focused on putting out the fire, moving and robbing things, not to mention the whereabouts of the cassocks. ""","“Stop the recitation! Stop the recitation!” he cried. “I’ll find the cassock.” Terrified by what they saw, the various monks went forward and knelt down to plead with Tripitaka, who only then stopped his recitation. Pilgrim leaped straight up and whipped out his rod from his ear. He would have struck at the monks, had not Tripitaka shouted for him to halt, crying, “Monkey! Aren’t you afraid of your headache? Do you still want to behave badly? Don’t move, and don’t hurt people! Let me question them further.” The monks kowtowed and begged Tripitaka, saying, “Father, please spare us. Truly we did not see your cassock. It was entirely the fault of that old devil! After he got your cassock last night, he started crying until very late; he didn’t even bother to look at it, for all he had on his mind was how he might keep it permanently as an heirloom. That was why he made plans to have you burned to death, but after the fire started, a violent wind arose also. Every one of us was only concerned with putting out the fire and trying to save something. We have no idea where the cassock has gone.”",,"Monkey angrily ordered them to drag the bad-tempered hog back. They then deposited their captive in front of Monkey, who had resumed his place on the boulder. “All right, you pointless pig: what bother has Tripitaka gotten himself into that he needs me to rescue him from? Don’t make me beat it out of you.” Pigsy told Monkey everything: his mission to find food, his nap, Tripitaka’s misstep into Yellow-Robe’s pagoda, their escape to Precious Image, Pigsy and Sandy ’s return to rescue the princess, his nap, Sandy’s capture, the horse’s sword dance . . . “And then the talking horse told me to bring you back, and that’s where we are.” “Idiot!” snapped Monkey. “Didn’t I tell you to frighten any incidental demons by telling them that I’m Tripitaka’s senior disciple?” Here Pigsy had his stroke of genius. “Funny you should say that.","Monkey fell to the ground in great agony, clutching his head and pleading, “Stop, stop, I swear to return the cassock to you.” The monks, trembling at the sight, begged him to stop, and only then did he shut his mouth and desist. Monkey leapt to his feet, took his iron cudgel from behind his ear, and was going to hit the monks when Sanzang shouted, “You ape, aren't you afraid of another headache? Are you going to misbehave again? Don't move your hand or hurt anyone. I want you to question them again instead.” The monks all kowtowed to him and entreated him most pitifully to spare their lives. “We've honestly not seen it. It's all that dead old bastard's fault. After he saw your cassock yesterday evening he cried till late into the night, not even wanting to look at it as he worked out a plan by which it could belong to the monastery for ever. He wanted to burn you to death, masters, but when the fire started, a gale wind blew up, and we were all busy trying to put the blaze out and move away what stuff we could. We don't know where the cassock went.”"
玄奘哭回寺中，告过师父，即时拜别，径往洪州。来到万花店，问那店主刘小二道：“昔年江州陈客官有一母亲住在你店中，如今好么？”刘小二道：“他原在我店中，后来昏了眼，三四年并无店租还我，如今在南门头一个破瓦窑里，每日上街叫化度日。那客官一去许久，到如今杳无信息，不知为何。”玄奘听罢，即时问到南门头破瓦窑，寻着婆婆。婆婆道：“你声音好似我儿陈光蕊。”玄奘道：“我不是陈光蕊，我是陈光蕊的儿子。温娇小姐是我的娘。”婆婆道：“你爹娘怎么不来？”玄奘道：“我爹爹被强盗打死了，我娘被强盗霸占为妻。”婆婆道：“你怎么晓得来寻我？”玄奘道：“是我娘着我来寻婆婆。我娘有书在此，又有香环一只。”那婆婆接了书并香环，放声痛哭道：“我儿为功名到此，我只道他背义忘恩，那知他被人谋死！且喜得皇天怜念，不绝我儿之后，今日还有孙子来寻我。”玄奘问：“婆婆的眼，如何都昏了？”婆婆道：“我因思量你父亲，终日悬望，不见他来，因此上哭得两眼都昏了。”玄奘便跪倒向天祷告道：“念玄奘一十八岁，父母之仇不能报复。今日领母命来寻婆婆，天若怜鉴弟子诚意，保我婆婆双眼复明！”祝罢，就将舌尖与婆婆舔眼。须臾之间，双眼舔开，仍复如初。婆婆觑了小和尚道：,"Xuanzang cried and returned to the temple, told his master, said goodbye immediately, and went straight to Hongzhou. When I came to Wanhua Store, I asked Liu Xiaoer, the owner of the store: ""In the past, Jiangzhou Chen Keguan had a mother who lived in your store, how are you now?"" Liu Xiaoer said, ""He was in my store before, and then he fainted. Looking at it, I haven’t paid the rent back in three or four years. Now I live in a broken tile kiln at the head of the South Gate, and I go to the streets to beggar every day. The guest official has been gone for a long time, and now there is no information. I don’t know why.” After Xuanzang listened to it, he immediately asked the pottery kiln at the south gate, looking for his mother-in-law. The mother-in-law said: ""You sound like my son Chen Guangrui."" Xuanzang said: ""I am not Chen Guangrui, I am Chen Guangrui's son. Miss Wenjiao is my mother."" The mother-in-law said: ""Why don't your parents come?"" Xuanzang Said: ""My father was beaten to death by robbers, and my mother was occupied by robbers as his wife."" The mother-in-law said, ""How did you know that you were looking for me?"" Xuanzang said, ""It was my mother who brought me to find her. My mother has a book. Here, there is another incense ring."" The mother-in-law took the book and the incense ring, and wept bitterly: ""My son is here because of his fame. After the emperor's pity on my son, there is still a grandson coming to look for me today."" Xuanzang asked, ""Why are my mother-in-law's eyes faint?"" Her mother-in-law said, ""I am thinking about your father, and I have been waiting for him all day long, but I can't see him coming. , so I cried so much that my eyes fainted."" Xuanzang knelt down and prayed to the sky: ""Nian Xuanzang is 18 years old, and he can't take revenge for his parents' hatred. Today, he took his mother's order to find his mother-in-law. Sincerity, keep my mother-in-law's eyes back!"" After wishing, she licked her eyes with the tip of her tongue and her mother-in-law. For a moment, his eyes licked open, and he was still the same as before. The mother-in-law looked at the little monk and said:","Xuanzang returned weeping to the temple. He told his master everything and bowed to take leave of him immediately. Going straight to Hongzhou, he came to the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn and addressed the innkeeper, Liu Xiaoer, saying, “In a previous year there was an honored guest here by the name of Chen whose mother remained at your inn. How is she now?” “Originally,” said Liu Xiaoer, “she stayed in my inn. Afterwards she went blind, and for three or four years did not pay me any rent. She now lives in a dilapidated potter’s kiln near the Southern Gate, and every day she goes begging on the streets. Once that honored guest had left, he was gone for a long time, and even now there is no news of him whatever. I can’t understand it.” When Xuanzang heard this, he went at once to the dilapidated potter’s kiln at the Southern Gate and found his grandmother. The grandmother said, “Your voice sounds very much like that of my son Chen Guangrui.” “I’m not Chen Guangrui,” said Xuanzang, “but only his son! Lady Wenjiao is my mother.” “Why didn’t your father and mother come back?” asked the grandmother. “My father was beaten to death by bandits,” said Xuanzang, “and one of them forced my mother to be his wife.” “How did you know where to find me?” asked the grandmother. “It was my mother,” answered Xuanzang, “who told me to seek my grandmother. There’s a letter from mother here and there’s also an incense ring.” The grandmother took the letter and the incense ring and wept without restraint. “For merit and reputation,” she said, “my son came to this! I thought that he had turned his back on righteousness and had forgotten parental kindness. How should I know that he was murdered? Fortunately, Heaven remembered me at least in pity, and this day a grandson has come to seek me out.” “Grandmother,” asked Xuanzang, “how did you go blind?” “Because I thought so often about your father,” said the grandmother. “I waited for him daily, but he did not return. I wept until I was blind in both eyes.” Xuanzang knelt down and prayed to Heaven, saying, “Have regard of Xuanzang who, at the age of eighteen, has not yet avenged the wrong done to his parents. By the command of my mother, I came this day to find my grandmother. If Heaven would take pity on my sincerity, grant that the eyes of my grandmother regain their sight.” When he finished his petition, he licked the eyes of his grandmother with the tip of his tongue. In a moment, both eyes were licked open and they were as of old. When the grandmother saw the youthful monk, she said, “You’re indeed my grandson!","It does not come, nor go, nor return. It is not different, it is not the same. It is neither possession nor loss. It is difficult to take or give away. It cannot be heard or counted on. The vital spark inside and outside is everywhere the same. There is a whole kingdom of heaven in one atom. There are numberless worlds in one grain. There is but one principle in body and soul. He who knows this must follow the mystery of nature. The pure is that which is untainted and clean. All the ways of good and evil are impotent. This is the teaching of the glorious Shakyamuni! When Xuanzang heard the thunder cry, “Oh my Master, you have come!” it frightened him very much. But the people there said, “These must be the cries of the Monkey King.” “Who is that?” asked Xuanzang. “He is one that cannot be frozen or starved, and lives on nothing but iron pills and copper syrup. He has been imprisoned here for 500 years.” Xuanzang let him out of the prison under the mountain, and the Monkey King followed the pilgrim as his disciple, and was given a new name. He was no longer Sun the Seeker of Secrets, but Sun the Pilgrim. Their first encounter was with a tiger which Sun easily killed, and made himself some fur clothes with its skin. But then they were suddenly attacked by six robbers, who were more difficult to deal with. They were Mr. Eye, who loved change, Mr. Ear, who became angry too easily, Mr. Nose, who smelt love, Mr. Tongue the Taster, Mr. Thought the Coveter, and Mr. Sad the Dissatisfied.","After Wenjiao’s boat had departed back to Jiangzhou, Xuanzang immediately set out for Hongzhou and made inquiries about a Mrs. Zhang at the Myriad Flowers Inn. “Oh, yes,” recalled the innkeeper. “She went blind and ran out of money. She became a beggar and now lives in a derelict potter’s kiln near the south gate of the city. I could never understand why we heard nothing more of the son who left her here.” Xuanzang immediately sought out his grandmother. “You sound so like my son, Guangrui,” she said, sighing. “I’m his son,” Xuanzang told her. “Wenjiao, your daughter-in-law, is my mother.” “But why didn’t your parents come back for me?” “My father was murdered by bandits,” Xuanzang revealed. “And one of them forced my mother to become his wife.” “How did you find me?” she asked. “My mother sent me, with this incense ring.” Mrs. Zhang now wept freely. “My son died for the sake of wealth and reputation! Thinking that he had abandoned me, I cried myself blind for him. At last, Heaven has sent you to find me.” “Take pity on us,” Xuanzang prayed, “and restore my grandmother’s vision.” He then licked his grandmother’s eyes and her sight returned.","Xuanzang returned to the temple in tears and told the abbot that he was leaving at once for Hongzhou. When he reached the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn he said to the innkeeper Liu the Second, “How is the mother of Prefect Chen of Jiangzhou who is staying in your inn?” “She used to stay here,” replied the innkeeper. “She went blind, and as she didn't pay any rent for three or four years, she now lives in a ruined tile-kiln near the Southern gate and begs in the streets every day to keep herself alive. That official went away a very long time ago and she hasn't heard from him to this day, though I don't know why.” On learning this he asked the way to the ruined tile-kiln at the Southern gate and found his grandmother. “You sound like my son Chen Guangrui,” said his grandmother. “I'm not Chen Guangrui, I'm his son. My mother is Miss Yin Wenqiao.” “Why have your father and mother not come?” she asked; and he replied, “My father was murdered by a brigand and my mother was forced to become his wife. I have a letter here and a sandalwood bracelet from my mother.” His grandmother took the letter and the bracelet, and sobbed aloud. “My son came here for the sake of fame and glory. I thought that he had forgotten all feelings of decency and gratitude; it never occurred to me that he might have been murdered. What a blessing that Heaven in its mercy did not cut short my son's line, so that I now have a grandson to come and find me.” “How did you go blind, granny?” asked Xuanzang. “I was always thinking of your father and longing for him to come back every day,” she said, “but as he never did I wept so much that! lost the sight of both my eyes.” Xuanzang fell to his knees and prayed to Heaven. “Although I am seventeen,” he said, “I have been unable to avenge my parents. Today I have come on my mother's orders and found my grandmother; if Heaven is at all moved by my sincerity, may my granny's eyes see again.” When he had prayed, he licked her eyes with the tip of his tongue. The licking soon opened them, and they could see once more. His grandmother looked at the little monk with a mixture of joy and sadness and said, “You really are my grandson—you're the very image of my son Guangrui.”"
张稍道：“李定，我两个真是微吟可相狎，不须檀板共金樽。但散道词章，不为稀罕，且各联几句，看我们渔樵攀话何如？”李定道：“张兄言之最妙，请兄先吟。”“舟停绿水烟波内，家住深山旷野中。偏爱溪桥春水涨，最怜岩岫晓云蒙。龙门鲜鲤时烹煮，虫蛀干柴日燎烘。钓网多般堪赡老，担绳二事可容终。小舟仰卧观飞雁，草径斜敧听唳鸿。口舌场中无我分，是非海内少吾踪。溪边挂晒缯如锦，石上重磨斧似锋。秋月晖晖常独钓，春山寂寂没人逢。鱼多换酒同妻饮，柴剩沽壶共子丛。,"Zhang Shao said: ""Li Ding, the two of us are really sympathetic, and we don't need sandalwood boards to share a golden bottle. But it's not uncommon for me to share a few chapters of Taoism. Let's combine a few sentences each. How about our fishing woodcutter?"" Li Dingdao ""Brother Zhang's words are the best, please sing first."" ""The boat stops in the green shisha waves, and I live in the deep mountains and wilderness. I prefer the spring water to rise in Xiqiao, and the most pity for Yanxiu Xiaoyunmeng. When the fresh carp is cooked in Longmen, insects The moths and firewood are burning every day. There are many fishing nets that can support the old, and the two things of carrying a rope can end. The boat lies on the back to watch the flying geese, the grass trails obliquely and listens to the chirping. Hanging by the stream is like brocade, and re-grinding the axe on the stone is like a sharp edge. Qiuyuehuihui often fishes alone, and there is no one in Chunshan. The fish often change wine and drink with the wife, and the firewood is left to sell the pot and the sons.","Zhang Shao said, “Li Ding, the two of us indeed are Lucky to have light songs to amuse us. We don’t need castanets or flasks of gold.7 But the poems we have recited thus far are occasional pieces, hardly anything unusual. Why don’t we attempt a long poem in the linking-verse manner,8 and see how fares the conversation between the fisherman and the woodman?” Li Ding said, “That’s a marvelous proposal, Brother Zhang! Please begin.” My boat rests on the green water’s mist and wave.9 My home’s deep in mountains and open plains. I love the streams and bridges as spring tide swells; I care for ridges veiled by the clouds of dawn. My fresh carps from Longmen are often cooked;10 My dried woods, worm-rotted, are daily burnt. Nets of many kinds will support my age. Both pole and rope will see me to the end. I lie in a skiff and watch wild geese fly; I sprawl on grassy paths when wild swans cry. I have no stake in fields of mouth and tongue; Through seas of scandal I’ve not made my way. Hung-dried by the stream my net’s like brocade; Polished new on rocks, my ax shows a fine blade. Beneath autumn’s moon I oft fish alone; In spring hills all quiet I meet no one. Fishes are changed for wine for me and wife to drink; Firewood is used to buy a bottle for my son.","You ask this disciple: He knows the way to Heaven. The Monkey did not like his remarks, thinking they were sarcastic. But Zhu Bajie said, “Do not be suspicious. This Man of Religion knows a great deal about the past and the future.” Then the Monkey said to the Master, “Mount the horse and let us go!” Religion springs from the heart, and religion dies at the heart. On whom does the rise and fall depend? If it only depends on self, Why need we help from another? Strive to get blood out of iron. Put a ring through your nose, And fasten yourself to distant space",One would praise seagulls and crabs; the other craggy peaks and mountain tea.,"Grass shoes with hempen thongs, a cloak of coarsest cloth, A mind relaxed: better than wearing silk.” “Li Ding,” said the other, “how truly it can be said of us that 'by reciting some verses we become close friends: What need for golden winecups and a sandalwood table?' But there is nothing remarkable in just reciting verses; what would you say if we made couplets in which we each contributed a line about our lives as fisherman and woodcutter?” “Brother Zhang,” said Li Ding, “that is an excellent suggestion. Please be the one to start.” Here are their couplets: My boat is moored in the green waters amid the misty waves; My home is in the wilds, deep in the mountains. How well I like the swollen stream under the bridge in spring; My delight is a mountain peak swathed in clouds at dawn. Dragon-sized fresh carp cooked at any time; Dry, rotten, firewood always keeps one warm. A full array of hooks and nets to support my old age; Carrying wood and making twine will keep me till I die. Lying back in a tiny boat watching the flying geese; Reclining beside the grassy path and hearing the wild swans call. I have no stall in the marketplace of tongues; I've left no trace in the sea of disputation. The nets hung to dry beside the brook are like brocade; An axe well honed on rock is sharper than a spear. Under the shining autumn moon I often fish alone; I meet nobody on the solitary mountain in spring. I trade my surplus fish for wine and drink it with my wife; When I've wood to spare I buy a bottle and share it with my sons."

What will happen to me then if they grab me?” “If you go into the water to fight him,” said Pilgrim, “don’t tarry. Make sure, in fact, that you feign defeat and entice him out here. Then old Monkey will help you.” “Right you are,” said Eight Rules. “I’m off!” He took off his blue silk shirt and his shoes; holding the rake with both hands, he divided the waters to make a path for himself. Using the ability he had developed in bygone years, he leaped through billows and waves and headed for the bottom of the river.",,"“Outrageous monkey!” she bellowed. “How dare you barge into my home and spy on me?” The two of them fought their way out of the cave, at which point Pigsy sprang into action. “Stand back, Monkey! Pigsy’s got this!” With another battle cry, the fiend now snorted fire from her nose and puffed smoke from her mouth; somehow, her single trident had become three, which she passed among too many hands for Monkey and Pigsy to count. “I know who you are,” she taunted, “but you don’t know who I am. Even the Buddha fears me.” The battle went on until nightfall, at which point the fiend suddenly jumped into the air and stabbed Monkey hard on the head.","The only other way I can get about there is by turning myself into a fish, a shrimp, a crab or a turtle. I can manage any strange and wonderful magic on a mountain or in the clouds that you can do, but when it comes to underwater business, I'm useless.” “When I was the commander of the Milky Way, the heavenly river, in the old days,” said Pig, “I had a force of eighty thousand sailors, so I know a bit about water. But I'm afraid that he might have generations of clansmen down there, and that would be too much for me. And if they got me, we'd be in a real mess.” “You go into the water and start a fight with him there,” said Monkey. “Don't fight hard, and don't win. You must lose and lure him out, then I can finish him off for you.” “Very well then, I'll be off,” said Pig. After stripping off his brocade tunic and removing his shoes he swung his rake in both hands and made his way into the water, where the tricks he had learned years back enabled him to go through the waves to the river-bed, across which he advanced."
正说处，那上房院主，又整治素供，请孙老爷吃斋。行者却吃了些须，复驾祥云，又去找寻。正行间，只见一个小怪，左胁下夹着一个花梨木匣儿，从大路而来。行者度他匣内必有甚么柬札，举起棒，劈头一下，可怜不禁打，就打得似个肉饼一般，却拖在路旁，揭开匣儿观看，果然是一封请帖。帖上写着：“侍生熊罴顿首拜，启上大阐金池老上人丹房：屡承佳惠，感激渊深。夜观回禄之难，有失救护，谅仙机必无他害。生偶得佛衣一件，欲作雅会，谨具花酌，奉扳清赏。至期，千乞仙驾过临一叙。是荷。先二日具。”行者见了，呵呵大笑道：“那个老剥皮，死得他一毫儿也不亏！他原来与妖精结党！怪道他也活了二百七十岁。想是那个妖精，传他些甚么服气的小法儿，故有此寿。老孙还记得他的模样，等我就变做那和尚，往他洞里走走，看我那袈裟放在何处。假若得手，即便拿回，却也省力。”,"Just as he said, the owner of the upper house, and he rectified the vegetarian offerings, and invited Master Sun to eat fast. The traveler, however, ate some beards, returned to the auspicious cloud, and went to find it again. In the middle of the line, I saw a little monster with a rosewood box under the left side, coming from the road. When the traveler tried to save him, there must be some card in the box. He raised his stick and slapped his head. He couldn't help but beat it like a meat pie, but he dragged it by the roadside and opened the box to see it. It was indeed an invitation. The post reads: ""Waiter Xiong Shi made his first salutation, and opened the Dan room of the old master of Jinchi, Dachan: I have received good benefits for many times, and I am deeply grateful. Yeguan is difficult to return to the fortune. Occasionally get a Buddha robe, if you want to make an elegant party, I would like to have flowers and drink, and I will give you a reward. When the time comes, Qian Qixian will come and talk. It is a lotus. I will wear it for two days."" The traveler saw it, hehe laughed Said: ""That old skinning, he died without any loss! He turned out to be a party with a goblin! Strangely, he also lived to be two hundred and seventy years old. I think it was the goblin who passed on some of his convincing little tricks. That's why I have this longevity. The old grandson still remembers his appearance, and when I become that monk, I will walk into his cave and see where my cassock is placed. If I succeed, even if I get it back, it will save effort.""","As they were speaking, the abbot brought in some more vegetarian dainties to serve to the holy monk Sun. Pilgrim ate some and left at once on the hallowed cloud to search for the monster. As he was traveling, he saw a little demon approaching from the main road, who had a box made of pear tree wood wedged between his left arm and his body. Suspecting that something important was inside the box, Pilgrim raised his rod and brought it down hard on the demon’s head. Alas, the demon could not take such a blow! He was instantly reduced to a meat patty, which Pilgrim tossed to the side of the road. When he opened the box, there was indeed an invitation slip, on which was written: Your student-servant, the Bear, most humbly addresses the Exalted Aged Dean of the Golden Pool. For the gracious gifts you have bestowed on me on several occasions I am profoundly grateful. I regret that I was unable to assist you last night when you were visited by the God of Fire, but I suppose that Your Holy Eminence has not been adversely affected in any way. Your student by chance has acquired a Buddha robe, and this occasion calls for a festive celebration. I have therefore prepared with care some fine wine for your enjoyment, with the sincere hope that Your Holy Eminence will be pleased to give us a visit. This invitation is respectfully submitted two days in advance. When Pilgrim saw this, he roared with laughter, saying, “That old carcass! He didn’t lose anything by his death! So he belonged to a monster’s gang! Small wonder that he lived to his two hundred and seventieth year! That monster, I suppose, must have taught him some little magic like ingesting his breath,10 and that was how he enjoyed such longevity. I can still remember how he looked. Let me change myself into that monk and go to the cave to see where my cassock is located. If I can manage it, I’ll take it back without wasting my energy.”",,"No need to sneak about in fancy dress.” “Please believe me that these demons are exceptionally powerful,” the terrified deity implored him. “You’ll need every ounce of that cleverness of yours to keep Tripitaka safe. One slip, and the pilgrimage will be over.” “Yes, yes—now get lost.” But Monkey weighed the spirit’s words carefully all the same as he made his way back to the group. If I tell Tripitaka the truth about the immortal’s warnings, he’s such a weed he’ll burst into tears and refuse to go on. But if I hide the information from him to keep us on the move and these monsters do succeed in capturing him, I’ll have to go to the trouble of rescuing him yet again. I know: I’ll send Pigsy on ahead to test the waters. If he defeats the monsters solo, good for him. If he’s captured, then I’ll come to the rescue again and further burnish my demon-defeating credentials. On returning to the others, Monkey cleverly offered Pigsy two choices of task: either begging for food for Tripitaka or patrolling the mountain. Remembering what had happened the last time he was sent foraging, Pigsy opted—albeit grudgingly—to go on reconnaissance. “Useless Tripitaka!” he muttered to himself as he trudged off. “Scheming Monkey! Miserable Sandy! You’re all fine and dandy, while I wear out my feet on this cursed mountain.” Now this mountain did indeed contain a Lotus-Flower Cave, home to two fiends who answered to the names Great King Golden Horn and Great King Silver Horn. That very day, their conversation turned to the scripture pilgrims.","As he was talking the senior abbot came in, set out the vegetarian meal, and invited Lord Monkey to eat. After swallowing a few mouthfuls Monkey mounted his magic cloud once more and went off on his hunt. On his way he saw a junior goblin going along the main path with a rosewood box under his left arm. Guessing that there must be some kind of letter in the box Monkey raised his cudgel and brought it down on his head. The blow did not just kill the goblin: it left him looking like a hamburger. Throwing his remains aside, Brother Monkey wrenched open the box and saw that it contained an invitation: Your pupil Bear presents his humble greetings to Your Excellency, the Supreme and Venerable One of the Golden Pool: I am deeply grateful for the magnificent kindness that I have so frequently received from you. When I saw the fire last night I failed to put it out, but I am sure that your divine intelligence will have suffered no harm from it. As your pupil has been lucky enough to obtain a Buddha's robe, I am giving a banquet, to which I hope you will come to appreciate the robe. I would be profoundly grateful if you would honour me with your presence at the appointed time. Written two days beforehand. On reading this, Monkey roared with laughter and said, “That crooked old monk. He thoroughly deserved to be killed. He'd been ganging up with evil spirits, had he? It's odd that he should have lived to be two hundred and seventy. I suppose that evil spirit must have taught him a few tricks about controlling his vital essence, which was why he lived so long. I can remember what he looked like, so I think I'll make myself look like him and go into that cave. This way I can see where he's put that cassock, and if I'm lucky I'll be able to get back and save a lot of trouble."
正嚷间，真君到了，问：“兄弟们，赶到那厢不见了？”众神道：“才在这里围住，就不见了。”二郎圆睁凤眼观看，见大圣变了麻雀儿，钉在树上，就收了法象，撇了神锋，卸下弹弓，摇身一变，变作个雀鹰儿，抖开翅，飞将去扑打。大圣见了，搜的一翅飞起，去变作一只大鹚老，冲天而去。二郎见了，急抖翎毛，摇身一变，变作一只大海鹤，钻上云霄来衔。大圣又将身按下，入涧中，变作一个鱼儿，淬入水内。二郎赶至涧边，不见踪迹。心中暗想道：“这猢狲必然下水去也。定变作鱼虾之类。等我再变变拿他。”果一变变作个鱼鹰儿，飘荡在下溜头波面上。等待片时，那大圣变鱼儿，顺水正游，忽见一只飞禽，似青鹞，毛片不青；似鹭鸶，顶上无缨；似老鹳，腿又不红：“想是二郎变化了等我哩！……”急转头，打个花就走。二郎看见道：“打花的鱼儿，似鲤鱼，尾巴不红；似鳜鱼，花鳞不见；似黑鱼，头上无星；似鲂鱼，腮上无针。他怎么见了我就回去了？必然是那猴变的。”赶上来，刷的啄一嘴。那大圣就撺出水中，一变，变作一条水蛇，游近岸，钻入草中。二郎因衔他不着，他见水响中，见一条蛇撺出去，认得是大圣，急转身，又变了一只朱绣顶的灰鹤，伸着一个长嘴，与一把尖头铁钳子相似，径来吃这水蛇。水蛇跳一跳，又变做一只花鸨，木木樗樗的，立在蓼汀之上。二郎见他变得低贱，——花鸨乃鸟中至贱至淫之物，不拘鸾、凤、鹰、鸦都与交群——故此不去拢傍，即现原身，走将去，取过弹弓拽满，一弹子把他打个〔足龙〕踵。,"During the shouting, the real monarch arrived and asked, ""Brothers, did you disappear when you arrived there?"" The gods said, ""I was surrounded here, and then I disappeared."" Erlang watched with wide phoenix eyes, and saw that the great sage had changed into a sparrow. Son, nailed it to the tree, took away the dharma image, cast aside the divine sharp edge, unloaded the slingshot, transformed into a sparrowhawk, fluttered its wings, and flew to swat. When the great sage saw it, the searched wing flew up, turned into a big mortal, and flew away into the sky. When Erlang saw it, he shook his feathers anxiously, and transformed himself into a sea crane, which climbed into the sky to hold its title. The great sage pressed his body down again, plunged into the stream, turned into a fish, and was quenched into the water. Erlang rushed to the stream and disappeared. I thought to myself, ""This hozen must go into the water. It will become a fish and shrimp or something. When I change, I will take him."" While waiting for a while, the great sage turned into a fish and was swimming along the water, when suddenly he saw a bird, like a green harrier, but not green; like an egret, with no tassel on the top; like a stork, but his legs were not red: ""I think it is Erlang. It's changed, wait for me!"" He turned his head sharply, and left with a smile. When Erlang saw it, he said: ""The fish with flowers looks like a carp, but its tail is not red; it looks like a mandarin fish, but its scales are not visible; it looks like a black fish, but it has no stars on its head; it looks like a bream, but it has no needles on its cheeks. Why did he go back when he saw me? Is it? It must be the monkey who changed."" Catching up, he pecked his mouth. The great sage jumped out of the water, turned into a water snake, swam near the shore, and burrowed into the grass. Erlang couldn't catch him because of the sound of the water. He saw a snake rushing out in the sound of water. He recognized it as the Great Sage. Similar, come to eat this water snake. The water snake jumped and turned into a flower bustard, a woodsy tree, standing on the Polygonum. Erlang saw that he had become low and low, - the flower bustard is the most cheap and lewd thing among the birds, not only the luan, the phoenix, the eagle, the crow are all in the flock - so he did not go to the side, he immediately appeared in his original body, and was about to go. He took the slingshot and dragged it to the full, and hit him on the heel with a single bullet.","they all cried. As they were making all that clamor, the Immortal Master arrived and asked, “Brothers, where did you lose him in the chase?” “We just had him boxed in here,” said the gods, “but he simply vanished.” Scanning the place with his phoenix eye wide open,6 Erlang at once discovered that the Great Sage had changed into a small sparrow perched on a tree. He changed out of his magic form and took off his pellet bow. With a shake of his body, he changed into a sparrow hawk with outstretched wings, ready to attack its prey. When the Great Sage saw this, he darted up with a flutter of his wings; changing himself into a cormorant, he headed straight for the open sky. When Erlang saw this, he quickly shook his feathers and changed into a huge ocean crane, which could penetrate the clouds to strike with its bill. The Great Sage therefore lowered his direction, changed into a small fish, and dove into a stream with a splash. Erlang rushed to the edge of the water but could see no trace of him. He thought to himself, “This simian must have gone into the water and changed himself into a fish, a shrimp, or the like. I’ll change again to catch him.” He duly changed into a fish hawk and skimmed downstream over the waves. After a while, the fish into which the Great Sage had changed was swimming along with the current. Suddenly he saw a bird that looked like a green kite though its feathers were not entirely green, like an egret though it had small feathers, and like an old crane though its feet were not red. “That must be the transformed Erlang waiting for me,” he thought to himself. He swiftly turned around and swam away after releasing a few bubbles. When Erlang saw this, he said, “The fish that released the bubbles looks like a carp though its tail is not red, like a perch though there are no patterns on its scales, like a snake fish though there are no stars on its head, like a bream though its gills have no bristles. Why does it move away the moment it sees me? It must be the transformed monkey himself!” He swooped toward the fish and snapped at it with his beak. The Great Sage shot out of the water and changed at once into a water snake; he swam toward shore and wriggled into the grass along the bank. When Erlang saw that he had snapped in vain and that a snake had darted away in the water with a splash, he knew that the Great Sage had changed again. Turning around quickly, he changed into a scarlet-topped gray crane, which extended its beak like sharp iron pincers to devour the snake. With a bounce, the snake changed again into a spotted bustard standing by itself rather stupidly amid the water pepper along the bank. When Erlang saw that the monkey had changed into such a vulgar creature—for the spotted bustard is the basest and most promiscuous of birds, mating indiscriminately with phoenixes, hawks, or crows—he refused to approach him. Changing back into his true form, he went and stretched his bow to the fullest. With one pellet he sent the bird hurtling.","Whilst they were talking of this, the Divine Kinsman arrived and asked, “How did you lose him?” They replied, “Here, where we had surrounded him, he suddenly disappeared!” The Divine Kinsman looked around with his phoenix eyes and saw the Monkey King in the form of a magpie on the top of a tree. He threw aside his spear and bow and used his magic to change himself into a starving falcon, and flew towards the magpie. The Great Sage, seeing this, flew away and changed himself into an eagle and made for the sky. The Divine Kinsman, then, quickly fluttered his feathers and changed himself into an ocean roc, and flew up to the cloud to pounce upon him. The Great Sage, seeing this, transformed himself into a fish in a stream and disappeared. The Divine Kinsman followed him to the brook side but could see no trace of him. In his heart he thought, “This monkey must have gone into the water! I must transform myself into a cormorant, and I shall surely get him!” So he changed again into a cormorant and floated down on the waves of the water and rested awhile. The Great Sage, having changed himself into a fish, was also carried down by the stream. Then he suddenly saw something flying like a bird, somewhat like a mandarin duck or a heron, but without red legs, and divined that the Divine Kinsman had changed himself into a cormorant and was waiting for him. He then turned round and made a sudden whirl in the water and disappeared. The Divine Kinsman, seeing this whirling fish, first like a carp but without a red tail, then like a perch but without scales, then like a black fish but without a star on its head, then like a bream but without a needle on its head, thought, “How is it that at the sight of me this fish disappears? It must be that it is no other than the Monkey changed into a fish!” So with his beak he tried to snatch the fish. The Great Sage then escaped out of the water and changing himself into a water snake on the edge of the river, rustled into the grass where he hid himself. Then the Divine Kinsman, hearing some noise in the water, and seeing a water snake coming out, recognised it as the Great Sage, and changed himself into a grey heron. With his long pincers like a beak he tried to pounce on the snake and swallow it. The water snake wriggled out and changed itself into a fetid tree, on the top of an acrid sandy beach. After some more changes the Divine Kinsman shot at him when he was like a cuckoo.","“Where did he go?” exclaimed the discombobulated brothers. Keeping a cool head, Erlang saw through Monkey’s transformation with his magic third eye. Discarding his weapons, Erlang turned into a falcon and rushed at the sparrow, which soared upward, now as a cormorant. Erlang smartly became a large sea crane, drilling into the clouds with its bill. The Great Sage changed direction, plunging into a stream as a fish. Erlang—now a fish hawk—skimmed over the surface of the water. Monkey swam off in the opposite direction, leaving a trail of bubbles. “There’s something odd about that fish,” mused Erlang. “It has the look of a carp but no red tail. There’s something of the bream about it, but it has no gill bristles. And why did it make off as soon as it saw me? I smell Monkey!” Just as Erlang’s beak dipped into the water, Monkey flung himself onto the bank as a water snake and slithered off into the grass. Erlang turned into a vermilion-headed gray crane and pounced with his pincerlike beak at the fake snake, which promptly became a spotted bustard, perched stupidly amid the knotweed. Seeing that Monkey had transformed strategically into such a degraded creature—the spotted bustard is the lowest and most promiscuous of birds, mating carelessly with phoenixes, hawks, and crows—Erlang refused to go anywhere near him. Returning to his true form, he shot the bustard with his pellet bow, sending the bird hurtling off balance.","As they were shouting the True Lord Erlang arrived and asked them, “Brothers, where had you chased him to when he disappeared?” “We had him surrounded here just now, but he vanished.” Erlang opened his phoenix eyes till they were quite round and looked about him. He saw that the Great Sage had changed himself into a sparrow and was perching on a branch; so he put off his magical appearance, threw down his divine trident, and took the pellet bow from his waist. Then he shook himself, changed into a kite, spread his wings, and swooped in to attack. As soon as the Great Sage saw this he took off and turned himself into a big cormorant, soaring up into the sky. Erlang saw him, and with a quick shake of his feathers and a twist of his body he transformed himself into a crane and pierced the clouds as he tried to catch him. The Great Sage landed on a mountain stream and, changing into a fish, plunged into the water. Erlang, who had pursued him to the bank of the stream, could see no trace of him. “That macaque must have gone into the water and changed himself into some kind of fish or shrimp,” he thought. “I'll transform myself again, then I'll get him.” He turned into a fish-hawk and soared above the lower reaches of the stream and the first waves of the sea. He waited there for a time. Meanwhile the Great Sage, who was in the form of a fish, swam with the stream until he noticed a bird flying above him. It was quite like a blue kite, except that its feathers were not blue; it was quite like an egret, but it had no crest on its head; and it was quite like a stork, but its legs were not red. “That must be what Erlang turned himself into while waiting for me,” he thought, turned round quickly, and went away. “The fish who turned round,” thought Erlang when he saw this, “is like a carp but its tail isn't red; it's like a mandarin fish, but I can't see the pattern on its scales; it's like a snakehead, but without a star on its head; and like a bream, but it has no needles on its gills. Why did it turn round the moment it saw me? It must be that monkey transformed.” He swooped down and snapped at the Great Sage with his beak. The Great Sage leapt out of the water, turned into a water-snake, swam to the bank, and slid into the grass. Failing to catch the fish in his beak, Erlang saw a snake jump out of the water and realized it was the Great Sage. He changed himself at once into a red-crested grey crane, and stretched out his long beak that was like a pair of pointed pincers to eat up the water-snake. The snake gave a jump and became a bustard standing stiffly on a smartweed-covered bank. When Erlang saw that he had turned himself into so low a creature—for the bustard is the lowest and lewdest of birds, not caring whether it mates with phoenix, eagle or crow—he kept his distance, reverted to his own body, went away to fetch and load his pellet bow, and knocked him flying with a single shot. The Great Sage seized the chance as he rolled down the precipice to crouch there and turn himself into a temple to a local god."

The saved boys naturally became Buddhist disciples.","“I need to unburden myself.” Then he began to sigh theatrically. “What’s wrong now?” asked the monster. “All day, my parents made a terrible scene outside our door.

正讲处，有那司香巡堂官急奏唐王道：“法师正讲谈妙法，被两个疥癞游僧，扯下来乱说胡话。”王令擒来，只见许多人将二僧推拥进后法堂。见了太宗，那僧人手也不起，拜也不拜，仰面道：“陛下问我何事？”唐王却认得他，道：“你是前日送袈裟的和尚？”菩萨道：“正是。”太宗道：“你既来此处听讲，只该吃些斋便了，为何与我法师乱讲，扰乱经堂，误我佛事？”菩萨道：,"At the speaking place, there was a priest of the Sixiang inspector who hurriedly played Tang Wangdao: ""The Master was talking about the wonderful method, but he was torn down by two wandering monks and talked nonsense."" Wang Ling was arrested, and many people saw the two monks Push into the rear court. When he saw Taizong, the monk couldn't lift his hands, and he didn't pay respects. He looked up and said, ""Your Majesty asked me what?"" Tang Wang recognized him and said, ""Are you the monk who gave the cassock the day before yesterday?"" The Bodhisattva said, ""It is ""Tai Zong said: ""Since you have come here to listen to the lectures, you should only eat some fasting food, so why are you talking nonsense with my Master, disturbing the scripture hall, and misleading my Buddhist affairs?"" The Bodhisattva said:","As they were speaking, the officer in charge of incense and the inspection of halls reported to the emperor, “The Master was just in the process of lecturing on the wondrous Law when he was pulled down by two scabby mendicants, babbling some kind of nonsense.” The king ordered them to be arrested, and the two monks were taken by many people and pushed into the hall in the rear. When the monk saw Taizong, she neither raised her hands nor made a bow; instead, she lifted her face and said, “What do you want of me, Your Majesty?” Recognizing her, the Tang emperor said, “Aren’t you the monk who brought us the cassock the other day?” “I am,” said the Bodhisattva. “If you have come to listen to the lecture,” said Taizong, “you may as well take some vegetarian food. Why indulge in this wanton discussion with our Master and disturb the lecture hall, delaying our religious service?” “What that Master of yours was lecturing on,” said the Bodhisattva, “happens to be the teachings of the Little Vehicle, which cannot lead the lost up to Heaven.","The Master was also suffering from thirst, and Sha the Monk went away in search of some water, leaving the Master, the horse, and the baggage by the side of the road. Hunger and thirst seemed hard to bear, for the disciples were long gone away from their homes and their goal. Suddenly there was a stir in the sky, and he saw what seemed like Sun appear with a cup of water for the Master. But seeing it was Sun who brought it, the Master would not touch it. He would rather die of hunger and thirst than touch anything given him by that bloodthirsty monkey. Sun Wukong said, “If you die, what will become of your great mission to fetch the Sacred Scriptures?”","She said that if I swear off violence, worship the Law of the Buddha, and escort the scripture pilgrim to the west, the Buddha will reward me. I’ve been watching and waiting for you ever since.” Tripitaka beamed. “Well, that’s wonderful. But how can I release you from this stone box? I have no ax or drill.” “Easy.","As the Bodhisattva was talking, the Master of Incense, an official who patrolled the temple, made an urgent report to the Tang Emperor that just when the Master of the Law was in the middle of preaching the wonderful Law a pair of scabby itinerant monks had dragged him down and were engaging him in wild argument. The Emperor ordered them to be arrested and brought before him, and a crowd of men hustled the two of them into the rear hall of the monastery. When they saw Taizong they neither raised their hands in greeting nor bowed, but looked him in the eye and said, “What does Your Majesty want to ask us about.” Recognizing them, the Emperor asked, “Are you not the monk who gave us the cassock?” “That's right,” replied the Bodhisattva. “If you came here to listen to the preaching you should be satisfied with getting something to eat,” said Taizong. “Why did you start ranting at the Master of the Law, disturbing the scripture hall and interfering with our service to the Buddha?” “That master of yours was only teaching the doctrine of the Little Vehicle, which will never send the dead up to Heaven,” replied the Bodhisattva."
次早，法师又升坐，聚众诵经不题。,"The next morning, the Master ascended to sit again, and gathered the crowd to recite the scriptures without question.","The next morning the Master of the Law again ascended his seat and gathered the monks to recite their sūtras, but we shall say no more about that.","The Monkey raised his spear point a fifth time, and immediately the wind, the thunder and lightning, and rain ceased, and the clouds cleared away to the great joy of all.",How about I call you that—one brother to another?”,We will omit a description of the night or of how the monks intoned the scriptures when their master took his seat again the next morning.

But I am afraid that good faith will be difficult to follow. Your five treasures."" He ordered Anuo and Kasyapa to take out a ""Jinlan cassock"" collar and a ""nine-ring tin stick"", and said to the Bodhisattva; ""This cassock and tin stick can be used by those who take the scriptures. If you are willing to come here with firm heart, wear my robes, so as not to fall into reincarnation; hold my tin coins, so as not to be poisoned.""","When Tathāgata saw her, he was most delighted and said to her, “No other person is qualified to make this journey. It must be the Honorable Guanyin of mighty magic powers—she’s the one to do it!” “As your disciple departs for the east,” said the Bodhisattva, “do you have any instructions?” “As you travel,” said Tathāgata, “you are to examine the way carefully. Do not journey high in the air, but remain at an altitude halfway between mist and cloud so that you can see the mountains and waters and remember the exact distance. You will then be able to instruct closely the scripture pilgrim. Since he may still find the journey difficult, I shall also give you five talismans.” Ordering Ānanda and Kāśyapa to bring out an embroidered cassock and a nine-ring priestly staff, he said to the Bodhisattva, “You may give this cassock and this staff to the scripture pilgrim. If he is firm in his intention to come here, he may put on the cassock and it will protect him from falling back into the wheel of transmigration. When he holds the staff, it will keep him from meeting poison or harm.”","Guanyin said, “If you are really in earnest and desire to be good, I will help you. I am going in search of a Chinese pilgrim who is to fetch the Sacred Scriptures. When he arrives, he will deliver you if you are willing to become his disciple.","“You must take especial care on this mission,” he advised her. “You must travel low enough that you can see which mountains and rivers you pass, and give the scripture pilgrim precise directions to Thunderclap Monastery. The going will be tough for this true believer of ours, and I therefore have five treasures that you can use to help him.” Two of his disciples brought out an embroidered robe and a nine-ringed monk’s staff. “You can give these two items to the pilgrim for his personal use.","The Buddha was very pleased to see her. “No one but the venerable Guanyin, whose divine powers are so great, will do for this mission,” he said. “What instructions have you for your disciple as she goes to the East?” Guanyin asked. “You must watch the route all the way,” said the Buddha. “You may not go via the Milky Way, but if necessary you may have a little cloud or mist. As you cross mountains and rivers you must note the distances carefully to enable you to give full instructions to the man who will come to fetch the scriptures. But that true believer will, I'm afraid, have a difficult journey, so I shall give you five treasures for him.” The Buddha ordered Ananda and Kasyapa to bring out a brocade cassock and a nine-ringed monk's staff. “Give this cassock and staff to him who will come to fetch the scriptures: they are for him to use. If he is determined to come here, he can avoid the Wheel of Reincarnation by wearing this cassock, and he will be free from evil if he carries this staff.”"
却说此子在木板上，顺水流去，一直流到金山寺脚下停住。那金山寺长老叫做法明和尚，修真悟道，已得无生妙诀。正当打坐参禅，忽闻得小儿啼哭之声，一时心动，急到江边观看，只见涯边一片木板上，睡着一个婴儿，长老慌忙救起。见了怀中血书，方知来历，取个乳名，叫做江流，托人抚养，血书紧紧收藏。光阴似箭，日月如梭，不觉江流年长一十八岁。长老就叫他削发修行，取法名为玄奘，摩顶受戒，坚心修道。,"But he said that the child was on a wooden board, and it flowed along the water until it stopped at the foot of the Jinshan Temple. The elder of Jinshan Temple is called Monk Faming. While meditating and practicing meditation, I suddenly heard the sound of a child crying, and I was moved to the riverside to watch it. I saw a baby sleeping on a wooden board at the edge of the river, and the elder hurriedly rescued it. When I saw the blood book in my arms, I knew the origin and took a nickname called Jiang Liu. Time is like an arrow, the sun and the moon are like shuttles, and I don't realize that Jiang Liu is 18 years older. The elder asked him to cut his hair and practice, and named him Xuanzang.","Now we shall tell you about the boy on the plank, which floated with the current until it came to a standstill just beneath the Temple of Gold Mountain. The abbot of this temple was called Monk Faming. In the cultivation of perfection and comprehension of truth, he had attained already the wondrous secret of birthlessness. He was sitting in meditation when all at once he heard an infant crying. Moved by this, he went quickly down to the river to have a look, and discovered the baby lying there on a plank at the edge of the water. The abbot quickly lifted him out of the water. When he read the letter in blood fastened to his chest, he learned of the child’s origin. He then gave him the baby name River Float6 and arranged for someone to nurse and care for him, while he himself kept the letter written in blood safely hidden. Time passed by like an arrow, and the seasons like a weaver’s shuttle; River Float soon reached his eighteenth year. The abbot had his hair shaved and asked him to join in the practice of austerities, giving him the religious name Xuanzang. Having had his head touched and having received the commandments, Xuanzang pursued the Way with great determination.","The temple was called the Shang temple. On the day of its opening, the people were ordered to select the best man in each of the three religions, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, to conduct the opening ceremony. The Buddhists chose Xuanzang, the son of the famous scholar Chen Hui. Being deeply versed in all the Buddhist Sacred Scriptures, he was appointed by the emperor to be the head of all Buddhists in the Empire. The emperor then called together 1,200 monks for a religious festival in Chang’an, lasting seven times seven days, during which Xuanzang gave an outline of the Buddhist Sacred Scriptures, and spoke of heaven, of hell, and of the many on earth who had lost their way, and whom he desired to lead back to the truth. While this great movement was going on in Chang’an, Lord Buddha had sent Guanyin to earth in search of a religious man to go to the West in quest of the Sacred Scriptures. She heard that the monk Xuanzang was none other than the Golden Cicada, who had become incarnate again to save men.","The plank drifted on the current until it reached the Temple of the Golden Mountain, whose abbot—named Faming—had achieved immortality through the pursuit of religious truth. While meditating, he heard a baby crying and discovered the child on the plank by the riverbank. The abbot immediately rescued him and read the letter tucked inside his swaddling. He named the baby Riverflow, found someone to care for him, and carefully hid the letter of identification. The years flew by and Riverflow turned eighteen, at which point the abbot asked him to become a monk, giving him the religious name Xuanzang.","The boy floated downstream on the plank until he came to a stop under the Jinshan Temple. The abbot of this temple was a monk called Faming who by cultivating the Truth and being awakened to the Way had found the secret of avoiding rebirth. As he was sitting at his meditation he heard a baby crying, and he hurried anxiously down to the riverside to look. He saw a baby lying on a board beside the bank, and got him out of the water as quickly as he could. When he read the letter written in blood that was on the baby's chest he knew why he was there. He gave the child the milk-name Jiangliu, “River Current,” and arranged for him to be fostered. The letter in blood he put away in a very safe place. Time passed like an arrow, and the days and months moved as fast as a shuttle. When Jiangliu reached the age of seventeen the abbot told him to have his head tonsured and enter the religious life. Giving him the Buddhist name Xuanzang he laid his hands upon his head and instructed him to observe the monastic discipline. Xuanzang was determined to cultivate the Way."
他等不得穷忙，即入蟠桃园内查勘。本园中有个土地拦住，问道：“大圣何往？”大圣道：“吾奉玉帝点差，代管蟠桃园，今来查勘也。”那土地连忙施礼，即呼那一班锄树力士、运水力士、修桃力士、打扫力士都来见大圣磕头，引他进去。但见那：,"He couldn't wait to be busy, so he went to Pantao Garden to investigate. A piece of land in this garden stopped him and asked, ""Where is the great sage going?"" The great sage said, ""I'll take care of the Jade Emperor and take care of the Pantao Garden. I'm here to investigate."" The land hurriedly saluted and called the group The hoe tree wrestlers, the water wrestlers, the peach wrestlers, and the cleaning wrestlers all came to the Great Sage to kowtow and lead him in. But see that:","He could not restrain himself from rushing immediately into the Garden of Immortal Peaches to inspect the place. A local spirit from the garden stopped him and asked, “Where is the Great Sage going?” “I have been authorized by the Jade Emperor,” said the Great Sage, “to look after the Garden of Immortal Peaches. I have come to conduct an inspection.” The local spirit hurriedly saluted him and then called together all the stewards in charge of hoeing, watering, tending peaches, and cleaning and sweeping. They all came to kowtow to the Great Sage and led him inside. There he saw","He then went to look at the Peach Orchard. Servants were there who refused to admit him asking, “Where does the Great Sage wish to go?” He replied, “I have been appointed by the Jade Emperor to take charge of the Peach Orchard, and have come to see it.” Then the servants called the others, and all kowtowed to him, leading him in to the orchard. It was full of magnificent trees with fine branches.","Eager to get started, he went straight into the orchard but was soon stopped by a local gardening spirit, who wanted to know what he was doing there. “The Jade Emperor’s just put me in charge, so I’m here to get the measure of the place.” Immediately saluting his new superior, the spirit summoned the orchard’s staff—the maintenance staff who weeded between the trees, watered and pruned them, and swept up the leaves—to give him a tour. A wonderful sight awaited Monkey.","In his eagerness to be at work he went straight to the Peach Orchard to have a look round. When he got there he was stopped by a local tutelary god who asked him, “Where are you going, Great Sage?” “I've been put in charge of the Peach Orchard by the Jade Emperor, and I've come to inspect it.” The local god hastened to greet him formally, and he called the men who weeded, brought water, looked after the trees, and swept the grounds to come and kowtow to the Great Sage.

“贫僧是大唐驾下钦差往西天拜佛求经的和尚。适间来到此处，遇著些狼虎蛇虫，四边围绕，不能前进。忽见太保来，众兽皆走，救了贫僧性命，多谢！多谢！”伯钦道：“我在这里住人，专倚打些狼虎为生，捉些蛇虫过活，故此众兽怕我走了。你既是唐朝来的，与我都是乡里。此间还是大唐的地界，我也是唐朝的百姓，我和你同食皇王的水土，诚然是一国之人。你休怕，跟我来，到我舍下歇马，明朝我送你上路。”三藏闻言，满心欢喜，谢了伯钦，牵马随行。,"""The poor monk is a monk who was sent by the Tang Dynasty to the west to worship Buddha and ask for scriptures. When I came here, I encountered some wolf, tiger, snake and insects, surrounded by all sides, and could not move forward. Suddenly I saw the Taibao coming, all the beasts left, and I was rescued. The poor monk's life, thank you very much! Thank you!"" Bo Qin said: ""I live here, and I only rely on fighting wolves and tigers for a living, and catching some snakes and insects for a living, so the beasts are afraid of me leaving. Since you came from the Tang Dynasty, you are with me It is a village. This is still the boundary of the Tang Dynasty, and I am also a commoner of the Tang Dynasty. I share the soil and water of the King of the Food King with you. It is true that we are people of the same country. Don’t be afraid. Come with me. I'll send you on your way."" Sanzang was overjoyed when he heard the words, thanked Boqin, and accompanied him with his horse.","“Your poor monk,” said Tripitaka, “is a cleric who has been sent by his Majesty, the Tang emperor, to seek scriptures from Buddha in the Western Heaven. When I arrived here a few moments ago, I was surrounded by tigers, wolves, and snakes, so that I could not proceed. But when the creatures saw you coming they all scattered, and you have thus saved my life. Many thanks! Many thanks!” “Since I live here and my livelihood depends on killing a few tigers and wolves,” said Boqin, “or catching a few snakes and reptiles, I usually frighten the wild beasts away. If you have come from the Tang empire, you are actually a native here, for this is still Tang territory and I am a Tang subject. You and I both live off the land belonging to the emperor so that we are in truth citizens of the same nation. Don’t be afraid. Follow me. You may rest your horse at my place, and I shall see you off in the morning.” Tripitaka was filled with delight when he heard these words, and he led his horse to follow the hunter.","It is only those who have a will to follow it and who are called who can master it.” After these words the spirits vanished and he regained his disciples. Soon there remained but a few trees instead of the structure the Master thought was a temple. It was no more than an illusion. The four traveled on over a hill and saw a temple, on which was written “The Sound of Thunder Temple.” The Master thought it must surely be the home of a famous bodhisattva. “Guanyin lives in the Southern Ocean, Samantabhadra lives in Mount Emei in Sichuan, Manjusri lives in Shansi, but I do not know what famous bodhisattva lives here. Let us go in.” But Sun said, “I fear it is not safe to go in.” But the Master insisted on going in. Sun said, “If you get into trouble, don’t blame me.” They went in. There was the image of the Buddha, surrounded by 500 arhats, as well as the usual Four Temple Guardians and innumerable other images. These figures filled the Master, Zhu Bajie, and Sha the Monk with awe, and they knelt and worshipped at every step; but Sun paid no respect to any of them.","Monkey pulled off Tripitaka’s old white shirt and replaced it with the silk one, which fit him perfectly. The instant that Monkey put on the cap, Tripitaka set down his biscuit and began silently reciting the Tight Hoop Spell. “Owwwwwww! My head hurts! My head hurts!” howled Monkey. After a few more renditions by the compassionate Tripitaka, Monkey was rolling around on the ground in pain, ripping at the cap. Fearing that he might break the golden hoop within, Tripitaka stopped his recital and the pain stopped, too. Monkey now touched his head. It felt like a golden wire was tightly wound about his crown, and however hard he tugged, it would not come off, as if it had taken root around his scalp. He pulled the staff out of his ear and tried desperately to prize off the hoop. Now afraid that Monkey might manage it, Tripitaka resumed his recitation until Monkey was somersaulting and cartwheeling in agony, eyes bulging, face and ears flushed scarlet. Taking pity on his disciple, Tripitaka desisted once more. “You’ve cursed my head!” raged Monkey. “That’s a bit strong,” protested Tripitaka. “I was only reciting the Tight Hoop Spell.” “Do it again,” asked Monkey. Soon enough, he was begging Tripitaka to stop. “Now will you listen to me?” asked Tripitaka. “I will!” “No more mischief?” “I wouldn’t dare!” Monkey’s heart, however, still plotted rebellion. The next instant, he turned the iron into a cudgel and was about to bring it down on Tripitaka’s head when the Buddhist pilgrim gabbled the spell and Monkey collapsed helplessly to the ground once more. “Mercy!","“I am a monk sent by the Emperor of the Great Tang to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask for the scriptures,” Sanzang replied. “I had just got here when I found myself completely surrounded by wolves, tigers, snakes and other creatures, which meant that I could go no further. Then suddenly you appeared, High Warden, and saved my life. Thank you very much indeed.” “Those of us who live here,” replied Liu Boqin, “can only support ourselves by killing tigers and wolves, and catching snakes and other reptiles, which is why all those animals fled in terror from me. As you are from the Tang Empire, we are compatriots. This is still the territory of the Great Tang, and I am a Tang citizen. Both of us depend on the Emperor's lands and rivers for our food and drink, and we are fellow-countrymen, so there is nothing to fear. You must come with me to my hut, and your horse can rest. I'll take you on your way tomorrow.” Sanzang, who was delighted to hear this, thanked him and went along behind him, leading the horse."
“萧瑀来奏何事？”萧瑀俯伏阶前道：“臣出了东华门前，偶遇二僧，乃卖袈裟与锡杖者。臣思法师玄奘可着此服，故领僧人启见。”太宗大喜，便问那袈裟价值几何。菩萨与木叉侍立阶下，更不行礼，因问袈裟之价，答道：“袈裟五千两，锡杖二千两。”,"""What is Xiao Yu coming to play?"" Xiao Yu bowed down and said, ""I came across two monks when I came out of Donghua Gate. They were selling cassocks and tin sticks. The priest Xuanzang of Chensi could wear this attire, so he led the monk to enlighten me. ."" Taizong was overjoyed and asked how much the cassock was worth. The Bodhisattva and the wooden fork stood at the foot of the steps, even more so without salute. They asked the price of the cassock, and replied, ""The cassock is five thousand taels, and the tin cane is two thousand taels.""","“What does Xiao Yu want to report to us?” asked the Tang emperor. Prostrating himself before the steps, Xiao Yu said, “Your subject going out of the Eastern Flower Gate met by chance these two monks, selling a cassock and a priestly staff. I thought of the priest, Xuanzang, who might wear this garment. For this reason, we asked to have an audience with Your Majesty.” Highly pleased, Taizong asked for the price of the cassock. The Bodhisattva and Mokṣa stood at the foot of the steps but did not bow at all. When asked the price of the cassock, the Bodhisattva replied, “Five thousand taels for the cassock and two thousand for the priestly staff.”","So they parted from their kind hosts, and the Master rode over the ice. Suddenly they heard a rumbling noise below and the white horse fell. Now the demon had been waiting for the sound of the horse’s feet to make the ice give way. He seized on the Master and dragged him beneath, calling out, “Come, all of you! We will feast on his flesh so that we may become immortal!” But the witch, afraid of Sun’s revenge, persuaded the demon to wait for two days, and they hid the Master in a stone coffer. In the meantime, the disciples thought the Master was drowned. They went back to the Chen family with the sad news.","With one wave of his hands, the ropes around Tripitaka snapped. He then blew on Tripitaka, who began to revive. “Thank you, oh, thank you!” Tripitaka cried, kneeling in gratitude. “Up you get,” responded the old man. “Do you have everything you came with?” “My attendants were eaten by the monsters, and I don’t know where my bags and horse have gotten to.” “There they are.” The old man pointed behind Tripitaka.","“What have you come to report, Xiao Yu?” the Emperor asked. Xiao Yu prostrated himself in front of the steps and replied, “When your subject went out through the Donghua Gate I met two monks who were selling a cassock and a staff. It occurred to me that this cassock would be suitable for Master Xuanzang to wear. So I have brought the monks for an audience with Your Majesty.” The delighted Taizong asked how much the cassock cost. Still standing beneath the steps, and not making any gestures of courtesy, the Bodhisattva and Moksa replied, “The cassock costs five thousand ounces of silver, and the staff two thousand.”"
三藏见他意思，实有好心，真个象沙门中的人物，便叫：,"Seeing what he meant, Sanzang really had good intentions, and he called out:","When Tripitaka saw that the monkey was truly a person of good intentions, someone who truly resembled those who had embraced the Buddhist faith, he called to him, “Disciple, what is your surname?”","But he said they had been foolish to capture Zhu Bajie, since he was of no use at all.","Then he spotted the less attractive—hideous, even—Monkey, to whom he did not extend the same courtesy.","Seeing that his intentions were indeed good and that he really was now a Buddhist, Sanzang asked him what was his surname."
“你又不曾问我姓甚名谁，我怎么就说？”小龙道：“我不曾问你是那里来的泼魔？你嚷道：‘管甚么那里不那里，只还我马来！’何曾说出半个唐字！”菩萨道：“那猴头，专倚自强，那肯称赞别人？今番前去，还有归顺的哩，若问时，先提起取经的字来，却也不用劳心，自然拱伏。”行者欢喜领教。菩萨上前，把那小龙的项下明珠摘了，将杨柳枝蘸出甘露，往他身上拂了一拂，吹口仙气，喝声叫“变！”那龙即变做他原来的马匹毛片，又将言语吩咐道：“你须用心了还业障，功成后，超越凡龙，还你个金身正果。”那小龙口衔着横骨，心心领诺。菩萨教悟空领他去见三藏，“我回海上去也。”行者扯住菩萨不放道：“我不去了！我不去了！西方路这等崎岖，保这个凡僧，几时得到？似这等多磨多折，老孙的性命也难全，如何成得甚么功果！我不去了！我不去了！”菩萨道：“你当年未成人道，且肯尽心修悟；你今日脱了天灾，怎么倒生懒惰？我门中以寂灭成真，须是要信心正果。,"""You didn't ask me who my last name was, so why would I say it?"" Xiaolong said, ""I never asked where you are from the Poker? You shouted: 'It doesn't matter where it is or not, just return my horse!' Why did you ever say half a Tang character!"" The Bodhisattva said, ""That monkey head relies only on self-improvement, but is willing to praise others? There are still people who are willing to go here today. Don't worry, you will naturally bow down."" The walker happily learned. The Bodhisattva stepped forward, plucked the little dragon's pearl, dipped the willow branch in nectar, and flicked his body, blowing a fairy breath, and shouting ""Change!"" The dragon turned into his original horse hair. , and then ordered the words: ""You must pay attention to the karma. After you succeed, you will surpass the ordinary dragon and return you to a golden body."" The little dragon held the crossbone in his mouth and promised him. The Bodhisattva taught Wukong to take him to see Sanzang, ""I'm going back to the sea."" The practitioner held on to the Bodhisattva and said, ""I won't go! I won't go! The road to the west is so rough, how long will it take to protect this ordinary monk? It seems that this is a lot of hardships and setbacks, and the life of the old grandson is also difficult to complete, how can I achieve any achievements! I won't go! I won't go!"" The Bodhisattva said: ""You were not a human being back then, and you were willing to cultivate with all your heart; In the face of natural disasters, how can I be lazy? In my door, silence becomes reality, and it is necessary to have confidence and fruition.","“How did you expect me to tell you anything?” The little dragon said, “Didn’t I ask you, ‘What kind of a monster are you and where do you come from?’ But all you did was shout, ‘ Never mind where I come from; just return my horse!’ Since when did you utter even half the word ‘Tang’?” “That monkey,” said the Bodhisattva, “is always relying on his own abilities! When has he ever given any credit to other people? When you set off this time, remember that there are others who will join you. So when they ask you, by all means mention first the matter of scripture seeking; they will submit to you without causing you further trouble.” Pilgrim received this word of counsel amiably. The Bodhisattva went up to the little dragon and plucked off the shining pearls hanging around his neck. She then dipped her willow branch into the sweet dew in her vase and sprinkled it all over his body; blowing a mouthful of magic breath on him, she cried, “Change!” The dragon at once changed into a horse with hair of exactly the same color and quality as that of the horse he had swallowed. The Bodhisattva then told him, “You must overcome with utmost diligence all the cursed barriers. When your merit is achieved, you will no longer be an ordinary dragon; you will acquire the true fruit of a golden body.” Holding the bit in his mouth, the little dragon humbly accepted the instruction. The Bodhisattva told Wukong to lead him to Tripitaka, saying, “I’m returning across the ocean.” Pilgrim took hold of her and refused to let go, saying, “I’m not going on! I’m not going on! The road to the West is so treacherous! If I have to accompany this mortal monk, when will I ever get there? If I have to endure all these miseries, I may well lose my life. What sort of merit do you think I’ll achieve? I’m not going! I’m not going!” “In years past, before you reached the way of humanity,” said the Bodhisattva, “you were most eager to seek enlightenment. Now that you have been delivered from the chastisement of Heaven, how could you become slothful again? The truth of Nirvāṇa in our teaching can never be realized without faith and perseverance.","The Master was frightened and said, “This bridge is not for mortals to cross over. We must look for some other way.” Sun smiled, and said, “It is the right way.” Zhu Bajie said, “If it is the way, who dares to cross it? The river is broad and the waves are high, and there is only this single tree, both narrow and slippery, spanning it. Who will attempt to cross it?” Sun said, “If you all wait here, I will show you how to cross it.” At this he ran and jumped on the bridge, crossed it jauntily, and in a minute was over it. Then he called on the others to follow. The Master shook his head, Zhu Bajie and Sha the Monk bit their nails, and said, “It is far too difficult!” At this Sun Wukong ran back over the bridge and, taking hold of Zhu Bajie’s hand, dragged him towards it, saying “Stupid fool, follow me!” But Zhu Bajie rolled on the ground and said, “Forgive me, it is far too dangerous. Let me just mount on the wind and cross over that way.” Sun urged him, “This is not the place for you to mount the wind. To become a Buddha you must cross by this bridge.” Zhu Bajie said, “Brother, if I cannot become a Buddha without this, I will have to renounce my hopes. It is really impossible to pass over it.” While these two were wrangling at the bridge end, they saw a man floating down in a boat crying out, “Take the ferry boat, take the ferry boat.” The Master was overjoyed at this, and called out to his disciples, “Do not wrangle any more, there is a ferryman coming.”","As a precautionary measure, Monkey first summoned the local mountain gods before him: “This monster has played three tricks on my master, and this time I want to finish her off. Don’t let her escape again.” The intimidated spirits stood guard on the edge of the clouds while Monkey dispatched the monster with one blow of his staff. Witnessing this at a distance, Tripitaka was speechless with horror. “Oh, well played, Monkey!” chortled Pigsy. “Three murders and it’s not even lunchtime.” Just as Tripitaka was about to start the headache spell again, Monkey rushed over to stop him. “Come and see who the old man really was.” A powder-white skeleton lay on the ground. “How can this be?” Tripitaka gasped. “You only killed him a moment ago.” “These are the remains of a demon that specialized in seducing innocent passersby. I finally succeeded in killing her just now and this is her true form. Look closer.” Monkey pointed out four words written on the spine: the white-bone demon. This time, Tripitaka really would have believed Monkey if the crafty Pigsy hadn’t stirred things up again. “He’s just beaten someone to death and is humbugging you with magic of some sort because he’s afraid of that spell of yours,” he needled. The gullible Tripitaka was once more taken in and promptly began the headache spell, breaking off only to issue Monkey’s marching orders. This time Monkey, too, had had enough. “Don’t worry, I’m going, seeing as you believe this idiot over me. Though I don’t fancy your chances without me.” “What arrogance!” raged Tripitaka. “Pigsy and Sandy can manage perfectly well on their own.”","“You never asked me my name, so how could I have told you?” Monkey retorted. “I asked you 'Where are you from, you bloody devil?' and you yelled, 'Never mind where I'm from, and give me back that horse.' You never so much as breathed the word 'Tang.'” “You monkey, you are so proud of your own strength that you never have a good word for anyone else,” said the Bodhisattva. “There will be others who join you later on your journey, and when they ask you any questions, the first thing you must mention is fetching the scriptures. If you do that, you'll have their help without any trouble at all.” Monkey was happy to accept instruction from her. The Bodhisattva then went forward, broke off some of the pearls from the dragon's head, soaked the end of her willow twig in the sweet dew in her bottle, sprinkled it on the dragon's body, and breathed on it with magic breath, shouted, and the dragon turned into the exact likeness of the original horse. “You must concentrate on wiping out your past sins,” she told him, “and when you have succeeded, you will rise above ordinary dragons and be given back your golden body as a reward.” The young dragon took the bit between his teeth, and her words to heart. The Bodhisattva told Sun Wukong to take him to see Sanzang as she was returning to the Southern Sea. Monkey clung to her, refusing to let her go. “I'm not going,” he said, “I'm not going. If the journey to the West is as tough as this, I can't possibly keep this mortal priest safe, and if there are many such more trials and tribulations, I'll have enough trouble keeping alive myself. How can I ever achieve any reward? I'm not going, I'm not going.” “In the old days, before you had learned to be a human being,” the Bodhisattva replied, “you were prepared to work for your awakening with all your power. But now that you have been delivered from a Heaven-sent calamity, you have grown lazy. What's the matter with you? In our faith, to achieve nirvana you must believe in good rewards."

Zhu Bajie recognized the wooden fork walker, and invited the master to greet him. After that Mucha and Sanzang finished their ceremony, they met with Bajie again. Bajie said: ""I have been instructed by the Venerable Master to see the Bodhisattva. I, Lao Zhuguo, obeyed the teachings of the Dharma, and I am glad to worship the ascetic. This has always been on the way, and I have not been able to express my gratitude. Forgive my sins."" The practitioner said:","In a little while the two of them lowered their clouds and arrived at the Flowing-Sand River. Recognizing the disciple Mokṣa, Zhu Eight Rules led his master to receive him.

I have indeed obeyed the Law, and I am happy recently to have entered the gate of Buddhism. Since we have been constantly on the road, I have yet to thank you. Please forgive me.” “Let’s forget about these fancy conversations,” said Pilgrim.",,"Monkey rushed back inside. Presenting Tripitaka with the pudding, he explained what the peddler had just told him. “We just need to get Iron-Fan’s fan and then we can extinguish the mountain of flames. We’ll be able to carry on our way and the locals will be able to enjoy a more temperate climate.” “But you don’t have any gifts,” the old man pointed out. “The locals have to prepare pigs, sheep, cash, exotic flowers and fruits, chickens, geese, and fine wine before begging for a wave of the fan.” “Just give me her address,” Monkey said nonchalantly. “She lives in Palm-Leaf Cave on Jade-Cloud Mountain—it’s about fifteen hundred miles southwest of here.” “No worries!” Monkey grinned.","A little later the pair of them brought their clouds down to land on the bank of the Flowing Sands River. Recognizing Huian as Moksa the Novice, Pig led his master forward to meet him. When Moksa had exchanged courtesies with Sanzang, he greeted Pig. Then Pig said, “Thanks to Your Holiness's instruction, I was able to meet the Bodhisattva, and since then I have obeyed the Buddhist law and had the pleasure of becoming a monk. As I have been travelling since then, I've been too busy to go and thank you. Please forgive me.” “Don't be so longwinded,” said Monkey."

It is worth laughing at the top seed in Wulingyuan, and it is even stronger than Tianfu!","Half red, half green, and spouting aroma sweet, These luscious divine roots of ten thousand years. Pity those fruits planted at Wuling Spring!15 How could they match the marvels of Heaven’s home:","All the gods and spirits said, “Good, truly it is a Great Peace!” Then each sat down in his seat, scattered flowers and made music.","Some eleven thousand deities feasted on dragon livers, phoenix marrow, jade juice, and immortal peaches.","Half red, half green, sweet-smelling beauties Growing every ten thousand years from immortal roots.

玄奘亦回洪福寺里。那本寺多僧与几个徒弟，早闻取经之事，都来相见，因问：“发誓愿上西天，实否？”玄奘道：“是实。”,"Xuanzang also returned to Hongfu Temple. Many monks and a few apprentices in this monastery had heard about the study of the scriptures, and they all came to meet, because they asked, ""Is it true that I vowed to go to the West?"" Xuanzang said, ""It is true.""","Xuanzang also went back to the Temple of Great Blessing. The many monks of that temple and his several disciples, who had heard about the quest for the scriptures, all came to see him. They asked, “Is it true that you have vowed to go to the Western Heaven?” “It is,” said Xuanzang.","So saying, he gave an order to one of the monkeys, who led out of the cave the white horse and the Master, followed by Zhu Bajie with the baggage, and Sha the Monk with his staff. When Sha saw the procession, he was filled with wrath and cried out, “How comes it that there is another Sha?”","Monkey now dragged the dead tiger over. “Do take a seat while I undress him.” “But he’s not wearing any clothes,” protested a puzzled Tripitaka.","Xuanzang went back to the Hongfu Monastery, where the many monks and his few personal disciples had already heard that he was going to fetch the scriptures. They came to ask if it was true that he had vowed to go to the Western Heaven. On being told by Xuanzang that it was indeed true, his pupils said, “Teacher, we have heard that the journey to the Western Heaven is a long one, and that there are many tigers, leopards, fiends, and demons on the way."
金击子如何落在地下？我们去园里看看来！”他两个急急忙忙的走去，只见花园开了，清风道：“这门是我关的，如何开了？”,"How did the gold striker fall to the ground? Let's go to the garden and take a look!

行者见说，唤山神土地同来见了三藏，具言前事。三藏道：,"When the traveler saw it, he called the land of the mountain god and came to see Sanzang, and explained the previous story. Sanzang Road:","When Pilgrim heard this, he called the mountain god and the local spirit to go with him to see Tripitaka to give an account of what had happened.",And leads to the Spiritual Mountain in the Blessed Land. 25,But I’m not about to give up now.

真君前前后后乱赶，只见四太尉、二将军一齐拥至道：“兄长，拿住大圣了么？”真君笑道：“那猴儿才自变座庙宇哄我。我正要捣他窗棂，踢他门扇，他就纵一纵，又渺无踪迹。可怪！可怪！”众皆愕然，四望更无形影。真君道：“兄弟们在此看守巡逻，等我上去寻他。”即纵身驾云，起在半空。见那李天王高擎照妖镜，与哪吒住立云端，真君道：“天王，曾见那猴王么？”天王道：“不曾上来。我这里照着他哩。”真君把那睹变化，弄神通，拿群猴一事说毕，却道：“他变庙宇，正打处，就走了。”李天王闻言，又把照妖镜四方一照，呵呵的笑道：“真君，快去！快去！那猴使了个隐身法，走出营围，往你那灌江口去也。”二郎听说，即取神锋，回灌江口来赶。,"The real monarch rushed back and forth, only to see the fourth captain and the second general swarming together and saying, ""Brother, have you taken hold of the great sage?"" Just as he was about to smash his window sills and kick his door leaf, he swung vertically and disappeared without a trace. It's weird! It's weird!"" Everyone was stunned and looked around even more invisible. The true monarch said: ""Brothers are guarding and patrolling here, waiting for me to go up to find him."" Seeing that Li Tianwang Gao Qing was looking at the demon mirror, and he was standing on the cloud with Nezha, the real monarch said: ""Tianwang, have you ever seen that monkey king?"" Changes, magic powers, and the group of monkeys were finished, but he said: ""He turned into a temple, he was fighting, and he left."" Li Tianwang heard the words, and took a picture of the demon mirror in all directions, hehe said with a smile: ""True Monarch, Hurry up! Hurry up! The monkey used a stealth technique, walked out of the camp, and went to your Guanjiangkou."" Erlang heard that, he took Shenfeng and went back to Guanjiangkou.","The Immortal Master was looking all around for him when the four grand marshals and the two generals arrived together. “Elder Brother,” they said, “have you caught the Great Sage?” “A moment ago,” said the Immortal Master laughing, “the monkey changed into a temple to trick me. I was about to smash the windows and kick down the doors when he vanished out of sight with a leap. It’s all very strange! Very strange!” The Brothers were astonished, but they could find no trace of him in any direction. “Brothers,” said the Immortal Master, “keep a lookout down here. Let me go up there to find him.” He swiftly mounted the clouds and rose up into the sky, where he saw Devarāja Li holding high the imp-reflecting mirror and standing on top of the clouds with Naṭa. “Devarāja,” said the Immortal Master, “have you seen the Monkey King?” “He hasn’t come up here,” said the Devarāja, “I have been watching him in the mirror.” After telling them about the duel in magic and transformations and the captivity of the rest of the monkeys, the Immortal Master said, “He finally changed into a temple. Just as I was about to attack him, he got away.” When Devarāja Li heard these words, he turned the imp-reflecting mirror all the way around once more and looked into it. “Immortal Master,” he said, roaring with laughter. “Go quickly! Quickly! That monkey used his magic of body concealment to escape from the cordon and he’s now heading for the mouth of your River of Libations.” We now tell you about the Great Sage, who had arrived at the mouth of the River of Libations.","The Divine Kinsman looked for him all round, but only saw the Four Governors and the Two Commanders-in-chief rushing towards him and eagerly saying, “Have you caught the Great Sage?” The Divine Kinsman laughed and said, “The Monkey had just changed himself into a temple and thought he would tempt me to go in, but when I was about to break through his door and windows, he got away and disappeared altogether, leaving no trace behind him. Most mysterious! Most mysterious!” They were all alarmed and looked round in all directions and still they found no trace of him. The Divine Kinsman then said, “Stay here, brethren, and watch, and I will go up to the sky and look for him.” When he got there, he saw Guardian King Li with Nezha on the clouds, high up in the air, scanning all round with his telescopic vision. The Divine Kinsman called out to Guardian King Li and asked, “Have you seen the Monkey King?” “No, I have not, we are here looking for him.” The Divine Kinsman then told the story of all the magic changes of the Monkey, until he changed himself into a temple and then disappeared completely. When Guardian King Li heard this, he peered around with his telescopic eyes and then he smiled and said, “Go at once, go at once, the Monkey has used the magic of making himself invisible. After leaving the camp, he went to your Guanzhou River.” When the Divine Kinsman heard that, he also spirited himself away to the mouth of the river.","As Erlang looked around him, his six blood brothers caught up; after briefing them quickly, Erlang told the others to keep a lookout while he went to check on King Li and his demon-reflecting mirror on the cloud tops. “Have you seen that Monkey?” Erlang hollered. King Li shone his mirror in all directions. “I see him!” He laughed. “He’s made himself invisible and is on his way to your own stomping ground, the River Guan.” Erlang hurried off in pursuit. As soon as he reached the Guan, Monkey changed himself into an exact likeness of Erlang, received the obeisances of Erlang’s subordinates, and set to officiating in his nemesis’s own temple.","With a tiger leap he disappeared into the sky. The True Lord Erlang rushed around wildly, but he could only see his six sworn brothers, who crowded round him and asked, “Elder brother, did you catch the Great Sage?” “That monkey turned himself into a temple to fool me,” he replied with a laugh. “Just when I was going to smash his windows and kick in his door he gave a jump and vanished without a trace. Strange, very strange.” They were all astonished, and though they looked all around they could see no sign of him. “Brothers, you patrol this area while I go to look for him above,” said Erlang, and with a quick jump he was riding a cloud in mid-air. When he saw Heavenly King Li holding high the fiend-detecting mirror and standing with Nezha at the edge of a cloud, the True Lord asked, “Your Heavenly Majesty, have you seen that Monkey King?” “He hasn't come up here—I've been keeping a lookout for him with this mirror,” the Heavenly King replied. The True Lord Erlang then told him how he had used transformations and magic to capture the monkey hordes. “He changed into a temple,” Erlang went on, “but got away just when I was going to hit him.” On hearing this, Heavenly King Li turned the fiend-detecting mirror in all four directions, then said with a laugh, “Hurry away, True Lord, hurry away. The monkey made himself invisible to get through the encirclement, and he's gone to your place, Guanjiangkou.” Erlang took his divine trident and returned to Guanjiangkou in pursuit."
这唤做六道轮回：行善的升化仙道，尽忠的超生贵道，行孝的再生福道，公平的还生人道，积德的转生富道，恶毒的沉沦鬼道。”唐王听说，点头叹曰：“善哉，真善哉！作善果无灾！善心常切切，善道大开开。莫教兴恶念，是必少刁乖。休言不报应，神鬼有安排。”判官送唐王直至那超生贵道门，拜呼唐王道：,"This is called the six paths of reincarnation: the path of ascending to immortals by doing good deeds, the path of supernatural rebirth with loyalty, the path of rebirth with filial piety, the path of fair rebirth of humanity, the path of reincarnation and wealth by accumulating virtue, and the path of sinister ghosts. When Tang Wang heard this, he nodded and sighed, ""It's good, it's really good!"" Do good without disaster! The good heart is always diligent, and the good way is wide open. Don't teach evil thoughts, you must be less obedient. No retribution, no retribution, gods and ghosts have arrangements. ""The judge sent the Tang King to the Chaosheng Guidao Gate, and called the Tang King Dao:","This is called the Sixfold Path of Transmigration. Those who perform good works will ascend to the way of the immortals; those who remain patriotic to the end will advance to the way of nobility; those who practice filial piety will be born again into the way of blessing; those who are just and honest will enter once more into the way of humans; those who cherish virtue will proceed to the way of riches; those who are vicious and violent will fall back into the way of demons.” When the Tang emperor heard this, he nodded his head and sighed, saying, “Ah, how truly good is goodness! To do good will never bring illness! In a good heart always abide. On a good way your door fling wide. Let no evil thoughts arise, And all mischief you must despise. Don’t say there’s no retribution, For gods have their disposition.” The judge accompanied the Tang emperor up to the very entrance to the way of nobility before he prostrated himself and called out, “Your Majesty, this is where you must proceed, and here your humble judge will take leave of you.","He was told: “If you do not avenge your father’s death, you have been born in vain!” But the prince remained still in some doubt. Sun therefore said, “Go straight back to the palace and see your mother in private, and hear what she will tell you.” Now after the Master had seen the soul of the king in a dream, the queen also had a similar dream.","“When you return to life, do remind your fellow mortals about the Six Paths of Karma. The virtuous will become immortals, the loyal nobles. The filial will be blessed, the principled wealthy. The just will be reborn as humans, the cruel as demons.” After leading the emperor up to the path of nobility, Cui Jue kowtowed in farewell.","It is called the Wheel of the Six Paths of Being. Those who have done good deeds rise on the Path of the Immortals; those who have been loyal are reborn on the Path of Honour; those who have done their duty to their parents lead their next life on the Path of Happiness; those who have been just return to life on the Path of Man; those who have accumulated merit are reborn on the Path of Wealth; and the evildoers fall down into the Path of Devils.” On hearing this the Tang Emperor nodded and said with a sigh: “Excellent, truly excellent, The virtuous come to no harm. The good heart is always mindful, The way of goodness always lies open. “Do not allow evil thoughts to arise; Thus you will avoid all trouble. Say not that there is no retribution; Whether you become a god or a ghost is all determined."
一日，在本洞分付四健将安排筵宴，请六王赴饮，杀牛宰马，祭天享地，着众怪跳舞欢歌，俱吃得酩酊大醉。送六王出去，却又赏劳大小头目，倚在铁板桥边松阴之下，霎时间睡着。四健将领众围护，不敢高声。只见那美猴王睡里见两人拿一张批文，上有“孙悟空”三字，走近身，不容分说，套上绳，就把美猴王的魂灵儿索了去，踉踉跄跄，直带到一座城边。猴王渐觉酒醒，忽抬头观看，那城上有一铁牌，牌上有三个大字，乃“幽冥界”。美猴王顿然醒悟道：“幽冥界乃阎王所居，何为到此？”那两人道：“你今阳寿该终，我两人领批，勾你来也。”猴王听说，道：“我老孙超出三界之外，不在五行之中，已不伏他管辖，怎么朦胧，又敢来勾我？”那两个勾死人只管扯扯拉拉，定要拖他进去。那猴王恼走性来，耳朵中掣出宝贝，幌一幌，碗来粗细；略举手，把两个勾死人打为肉酱。自解其索，丢开手，轮着棒，打入城中。唬得那牛头鬼东躲西藏，马面鬼南奔北跑，众鬼卒奔上森罗殿，报着：“大王！祸事！祸事！外面一个毛脸雷公，打将来了！”,"One day, in this cave, he assigned the four generals to arrange a feast, invited the six kings to drink, slaughtered oxen and horses, sacrificed to heaven and enjoyed the earth, danced and sang with all the monsters, and all ate and got drunk. After sending the six kings out, but rewarding the big and small leaders, leaning under the pine shade by the iron bridge, he fell asleep in an instant. The four generals were surrounded by the generals and did not dare to speak loudly. I saw that the Monkey King was sleeping and saw two people holding a letter of approval with the three characters ""Monkey King"" on it. He approached him and said nothing. He put on the rope and took the Soul of the Monkey King away, staggering. staggered, and led to the edge of a city. The Monkey King gradually woke up and suddenly looked up. There was an iron plate on the city, with three big characters on it, ""Netherworld"". The Monkey King suddenly came to his senses and said, ""The Netherworld is where the King of Hell lives, so why are you here?"" The two said, ""You should end your life today. The two of us will approve it and come here."" The Monkey King heard that and said: : ""My old grandson is beyond the Three Realms and is not in the Five Elements. He is no longer under his jurisdiction. How can he be hazy and dare to hook me?"" The Monkey King was angry, and the treasure came out of his ears, and the bowl was thick and thin; he raised his hand slightly and beat the two dead men into meat sauce. Freeing himself, he threw away his hand, took turns with his stick, and entered the city. The bull-headed ghost hid in Tibet, the horse-faced ghost ran north and south, and all the ghosts rushed to the Senluo Palace, reporting: ""Your Majesty! Disaster! Disaster! A hairy-faced Lei Gong outside is coming!""","One day, the four mighty commanders had been told to prepare a great banquet in their own cave, and the six kings were invited to the feast. They killed cows and slaughtered horses; they sacrificed to Heaven and Earth. The various imps were ordered to dance and sing, and they all drank until they were thoroughly drunk. After sending the six kings off, Wukong also rewarded the leaders great and small with gifts. Reclining in the shade of pine trees near the sheet iron bridge, he fell asleep in a moment. The four mighty commanders led the crowd to form a protective circle around him, not daring to raise their voices. In his sleep the Handsome Monkey King saw two men approach with a summons with the three characters “Sun Wukong” written on it. They walked up to him and, without a word, tied him up with a rope and dragged him off. The soul of the Handsome Monkey King was reeling from side to side. They reached the edge of a city. The Monkey King was gradually coming to himself, when he lifted up his head and suddenly saw above the city an iron sign bearing in large letters the three words “Region of Darkness.” The Handsome Monkey King at once became fully conscious. “The Region of Darkness is the abode of Yama, King of Death,” he said. “Why am I here?” “Your age in the World of Life has come to an end,” the two men said. “The two of us were given this summons to arrest you.” When the Monkey King heard this, he said, “I, old Monkey himself, have transcended the Three Regions and the Five Phases;5 hence I am no longer under Yama’s jurisdiction. Why is he so confused that he wants to arrest me?” The two summoners paid scant attention. Yanking and pulling, they were determined to haul him inside. Growing angry, the Monkey King whipped out his treasure. One wave of it turned it into the thickness of a rice bowl; he raised his hands once, and the two summoners were reduced to hash. He untied the rope, freed his hands, and fought his way into the city, wielding the rod. Bull-headed demons hid in terror, and horse-faced demons fled in every direction. A band of ghost soldiers ran up to the Palace of Darkness, crying, “Great Kings! Disaster! Disaster! Outside there","One day, he invited the six kings to dine at his cave, and they drank until they were all incapable. After seeing his guests off, while leaning on the iron bridge in the shade of the pine trees, he suddenly fell asleep. The four generals at once surrounded him to protect him, but dared not speak in case they might wake him. The Monkey King dreamt he saw two men carrying a warrant, with the name of Sun the Seeker of Secrets on it, approach him, and without any words bind him with ropes, take his soul away, and carry him off to the gates of a city. The Monkey King saw above the gates of the city an iron tablet on which was written, “The World of Hell.” The King said, “Hell is the place where Yama the Judge of the Dead lives; how is it that I am here?” The two men replied, “Your days on earth are numbered, and we two have been ordered to fetch you here.” The Monkey King on hearing this said, “I have crossed over beyond the gates of death and am no longer to be counted among mortals and cannot be under the rule of the Judge of Hell. How have you so blundered and dared to bring me here?” The two who had so far dragged him along, were determined to drag him in. The King, getting angry, drew out from his ear his precious weapon. It shone forth as he caused it to grow large, and with it he beat the two men to a pulp. He then tore off the rope that bound him, cast off the handcuffs and making of them a weapon went into the city. He frightened the bull-headed and horse-headed demons, so that they flew in all directions towards the office of Yama. They reported the matter to the great chief crying, “A great calamity, a great calamity. Outside a bearded thunderer has come.”","One day, Monkey instructed his four commanders to arrange a banquet for the seven brothers: oxen and horses were slaughtered, sacrifices were offered to heaven and earth, assorted imps were ordered to sing and dance, and everyone proceeded to get thoroughly drunk. After seeing his six compadres off, Monkey lay down under the shade of a pine tree and, a moment later, nodded off, surrounded by a hushed, protective circle of his subjects. As he slept, Monkey dreamed that two silent individuals, holding an official summons on which his full name—Sun Wukong—was written, tied him up and lugged him to the edge of a city. Still groggy with drink, Monkey half discerned an iron sign: welcome to hell. This brought him to his senses. “Why have you dragged me to the Kingdom of Death?” he demanded. “You’ve reached the end of your allotted span,” his escorts informed him. “Our orders are to bring you here.” Monkey was outraged: “I have transcended the Three Realms and the Five Phases and am no longer under King Yama’s jurisdiction. Why has your idiot sovereign had me arrested?” Ignoring the protest, the two soul-policemen went on trying to pull him inside. Now in a proper fury, Monkey pulled the magic iron staff out from behind his ear. With one wave, it grew into a cudgel, and Monkey smashed his guards to a pulp. He untied himself and charged into the city, spinning his staff this way and that. Bull-headed and horse-faced demons fled in terror, while ghost soldiers rushed to alert the Palace of Hell. “Disaster, Your Majesties!” they reported. “An outrageous monkey is about to smash his way into the palace!”","One day he instructed his four Stalwart Generals to arrange a feast for the six other kings. Oxen and horses were slaughtered, sacrifices were made to Heaven and Earth, and the assembled monsters danced, sang, and drank themselves blotto. When he had seen the six kings out and tipped his senior and junior officials Sun Wukong lay himself down under the shade of the pines beside the bridge and was asleep in an instant. The four Stalwart Generals made the others stand round and guard him, and they all kept their voices down. In his sleep the Handsome Monkey King saw two men approach him with a piece of paper in their hands on which was written “Sun Wukong.” Without allowing any explanations they tied up his soul and dragged it staggering along till they reached a city wall. The Monkey King, who was gradually recovering from his drunken stupor, looked up and saw an iron plate on the wall on which was inscribed WORLD OF DARKNESS in large letters. In a flash of realization he said, “The World of Darkness is where King Yama lives. Why have I come here?” “Your life in the world above is due to end now,” his escorts said, “and we were ordered to fetch you.” To this the Monkey King replied, “I have gone beyond the Three Worlds, and I am no longer subject to the Five Elements. I don't come under King Yama's jurisdiction. How dare you grab me, you idiots?” But the fetchers of the dead just went on tugging at him, determined to drag him inside. The Monkey King lost his temper, pulled his treasure out of his ear, and gave it a shake. It became as thick as a rice bowl. It only took a slight movement of his arm to smash the two fetchers of the dead to pulp. He untied his bonds, loosed his hands, and charged into the city whirling his cudgel, so terrifying the ox-headed and horse-faced devils that they fled in all directions for cover. All the devil soldiers rushed to the Senluo Palace and reported, “Your Majesty, disaster, disaster! A hairy-faced thunder-god is attacking us out there.”"
他说以相为姓，唤名猪刚鬣。是老孙从后宅里掣棒就打，他化一阵狂风走了。被老孙着风一棒，他就化道火光，径转他那本山洞里，取出一柄九齿钉钯，与老孙战了一夜。适才天色将明，他怯战而走，把洞门紧闭不出。老孙还要打开那门，与他见个好歹，恐师父在此疑虑盼望，故先来回个信息。”说罢，那老高上前跪下道：“长老，没及奈何，你虽赶得去了，他等你去后复来，却怎区处？索性累你与我拿住，除了根，才无后患。我老夫不敢怠慢，自有重谢：将这家财田地，凭众亲友写立文书，与长老平分。只是要剪草除根，莫教坏了我高门清德。”行者笑道：,"He said that he took Xiang as his surname and called him Zhu Ganghye. It was Lao Sun who hit the stick from the back house, and he turned into a gust of wind and left. With a blow from the old Sun, he turned into a fire, went straight to his cave, took out a handle of nine-toothed nails, and fought with the old Sun all night. Just as the sky was about to dawn, he timidly walked away, unable to close the cave door. The old grandson still wants to open the door and see what is wrong with him. I am afraid that the master will have doubts and hope here, so I will send a message back and forth first. After saying that, the old man stepped forward and knelt down and said, ""Elder, there is no time to do anything. Although you can go, how can he come back after you go?"" Simply tired you and me to hold, except for the root, there will be no trouble. My old husband does not dare to neglect, and he is very grateful: I will share this wealth and land with my relatives and friends and share it equally with the elders. I just want to cut the grass and remove the roots, don't teach me to ruin my high school and Qingde. ""The walker laughed:","He said that he derived his surname from his appearance, and he went by the name of Zhu Ganglie. When I attacked him with my rod in the rear building, he tried to escape by changing into a violent gust of wind; I then struck at the wind, and he changed into shafts of flaming light and retreated to his mountain cave. There he took out a nine-pronged muckrake to do battle with old Monkey for a whole night. Just now when it grew light, he could fight no longer and fled into the cave, shutting the doors tightly and not coming out any more. I wanted to break down the door to finish him off, but I was afraid that you might be waiting here anxiously. That’s why I came back first to give you some news.” When he had finished speaking, old Mr. Gao came forward and knelt down, saying, “Honored Priest, I have no alternative but to say this. Though you have chased him away, he might come back here after you leave. What should we do then? I may as well ask you to do us the favor of apprehending him, so that we shall not have any further worries. This old man, I assure you, will not be ungrateful or unkind; there will be a generous reward for you. I shall ask my relatives and friends to witness the drawing up of a document, whereby I shall divide my possessions and my property equally with you. All I want is to pluck up the trouble by the root, so that the pure virtue of our Gao family will not be tainted.” “Aren’t you being rather demanding, old man?” said Pilgrim, laughing.",,"The appearance of the Taoists seemed to terrify the Buddhists, who redoubled their efforts with the cart. Let’s take a closer look, he thought. Landing near the beach, Monkey transformed himself into a wandering Taoist and bowed before the two young men. “I have traveled here from far away,” he told them. “Is there any kind soul in the city from whom I could beg a little something to eat?” The young men laughed at the question. “Everyone in this city, from the king down to the most ordinary subjects, is devoted to Taoism—people bow and gift us food whenever they see us.” “What’s the name of this city, and how did its ruler come to be so pious?” “The place is called Cart-Slow. Twenty years ago, there was a terrible drought and all the crops failed. Just as things were getting desperate, three Taoist masters descended from Heaven and saved us all. They now rule over us.” “What are their names?” asked Monkey. “In order of seniority: Tiger-Strength Great Immortal, Deer-Strength Great Immortal, and Goat-Strength Great Immortal.","He says that he takes his name from his looks and is called Zhu Ganglie, Iron-haired Pig. I was going to kill him in the building at the back, but he turned into a hurricane and fled. When I struck at this wind, he changed into sparks, went straight back to his cave, came out with a nine-pronged rake, and fought me all night. He broke off the engagement in terror as the dawn broke and shut himself in his cave. I was going to smash down the gates and have it out with him, but then it occurred to me that you might be worried after waiting for me so long, so I came back to put you in the picture first.” After Monkey had made his report, Squire Gao came up and knelt before him saying, “Venerable sir, I'm afraid that although you've chased him away, he'll come back after you've gone; so this is no real solution. Please, I beg of you, catch him for me and exterminate him to prevent trouble later. I promise you that I shall not be remiss if you do this for me, and there will, of course, be rich rewards. I shall write a deed, witnessed by my relations and friends, giving you half of my property and my land. Please, please eradicate this evil weed and save the honour of the family.” “You've got no sense of what's proper, old man,” replied Monkey with a grin."
行者道：“这个放心，暗中自有神灵保护，明中等我叫那些和尚伏侍。”即唤众和尚过来道：“汝等着几个去埋那老鬼，着几个伏侍我师父，看守我白马！”众僧领诺。行者又道：“汝等莫顺口儿答应，等我去了，你就不来奉承。看师父的，要怡颜悦色；养白马的，要水草调匀。假有一毫儿差了，照依这个样棍，与你们看看！”他掣出棍子，照那火烧的砖墙扑的一下，把那墙打得粉碎，又震倒了有七八层墙。众僧见了，个个骨软身麻，跪着磕头滴泪道：“爷爷宽心前去，我等竭力虔心，供奉老爷，决不敢一毫怠慢！”好行者，急纵筋斗云，径上黑风山，寻找这袈裟。正是那：金禅求正出京畿，仗锡投西涉翠微。虎豹狼虫行处有，工商士客见时稀。路逢异国愚僧妒，全仗齐天大圣威。火发风生禅院废，黑熊夜盗锦襕衣。毕竟此去不知袈裟有无，吉凶如何，且听下回分解。,"The walker said: ""Don't worry, there are gods in the dark, and I will call those monks to serve."" Then he called the monks over and said, ""You wait for a few to bury that old ghost, and a few to serve my master and guard me. White horse!"" The monks accepted the promise. The pilgrim said again: ""Wait for Mo Shun'er to agree, and when I go, you won't come to flatter me. Those who look at the master should have a pleasant face; those who keep white horses should mix the water and grass thoroughly. If there is a slight difference, follow the instructions. Let's take a look at this sample stick!"" He pulled out the stick and slammed it against the burning brick wall, smashing it to pieces, and knocking down seven or eight layers of walls. When the monks saw it, all of them were numb, kneeling and kowtowing with tears: ""Grandpa, go ahead, I will try my best to worship the master, and I will never dare to neglect!"" Go up Black Wind Mountain and look for this cassock. Exactly that: Jin Chan went out of Gyeonggi to seek justice, and cast the west to Cuiwei with tin. Tigers, leopards, wolves and worms are everywhere, and businessmen are rare when they see them. Lu Feng felt jealous of foreign fools, and he relied on the might of Equaling Heaven. Huo Fa Feng Sheng Chan Yuan abolished, black bear thieves brocade clothes. After all, I don't know if there is a cassock or not, what is good or bad, let's listen to the decomposition next time.","“You can relax,” said Pilgrim. “You have in secret the protection of the gods; and in the open, I shall make sure that the monks wait on you.” He then called the monks over, saying, “A few of you can go and bury that old devil, while the others can wait on my master and watch our white horse.” The monks at once agreed. Pilgrim said again, “Don’t give me any casual reply now, only to grow slack in your service after I’m gone. Those who wait on my master must be cheerful and pleasant; those who look after the white horse must take care that water and hay are fed in proper proportions. If there’s the slightest mistake, you can count on meeting this rod. Now watch!” He whipped out his rod and aimed it at the seared bricked wall: with one stroke, not only did he pulverize the wall, but the impact was so great that it caused seven or eight more walls to collapse. When the various monks saw this, they were all paralyzed with fear. They knelt to kowtow with tears flowing from their eyes and said, “Father, please be assured that we shall be most diligent in caring for the holy father after you are gone. We wouldn’t dream of slacking in any way.” Dear Pilgrim! He swiftly mounted the cloud somersault and went straight to the Black Wind Mountain to look for the cassock. Thus it was that Truth-seeking Gold Cicada left Chang’an.7 With gifts he went westward, passing blue-green hills. There were wolves and tigers as he walked along, Though merchants or scholars were rarely seen. One foolish monk’s envy abroad he met; His refuge solely was the Great Sage’s might. The fire grew; the wind came and wrecked the Chan hall. A Black Bear at night stole the embroidered robe. We do not know whether Pilgrim found the cassock or not, or whether the outcome of his search was good or bad. Let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.",,"When I’ve been to India and delivered the scriptures back to the Land of the East, I’ll return to our monkey paradise.” Monkey and Pigsy cloud-traveled across the Great Eastern Ocean, pausing only briefly for Monkey to wash off what he called his “demonic odor,” so as not to disgust Tripitaka when they met again. Soon, Yellow-Robe’s golden pagoda came into view. “That’s where Sandy’s being held, though the monster’s not there right now,” Pigsy explained. Spotting two boys—one a little older than nine, the other about seven—playing a variation of hockey outside, Monkey swooped down, grabbed them by their hair, and carried them off screaming. The princess ran out to see Monkey standing on a cliff, making as if to smash her sons to the ground. “Who are you and why have you snatched my children?” she screeched. “Their father has a nasty temper on him—if you hurt a hair on their heads, he’ll make you pay.” “I— and you should know this already— am Monkey, Tripitaka’s chief and most charismatic disciple. Release Sandy and you’ll get your boys back.” The princess rushed back inside to untie Sandy, explaining that a monkey had shown up to demand his release. An ecstatic Sandy ran outside to acclaim his rescuer. “You’re a sight for sore eyes, Monkey!”","“Don't worry, gods are watching over you in secret, and in the visible sphere I'll make these monks serve you.” With that he called the community together and said, “I want some of you to go and bury that old ghost, and some of you to serve my master and look after our white horse.” The monks all assented obediently, and Monkey continued, “I won't have you agreeing glibly now but not waiting on them when I've gone. Those of you who look after my master must do so with pleasant expressions on your faces, and those who feed the horse must make sure he gets the right amount of hay and water. If there's the slightest mistake, I'll hit you like this.” He pulled out his cudgel, and smashed a fire-baked brick wall to smithereens; the shock from this shook down seven or eight more walls. At the sight of this the monks' bones turned to jelly, and they knelt down and kowtowed to him with tears pouring down their cheeks. “Don't worry, master, you can go—we'll look after him. We promise not to show any disrespect.” The splendid Monkey then went straight to the Black Wind Mountain with a leap of his somersault cloud to look for the cassock. The Golden Cicada left the capital in search of the truth, Leaning on his staff as he went to the distant West. Along his route were tigers, leopards and wolves; Few were the artisans, merchants, or scholars he met. In a foreign land be encountered a stupid and covetous monk, And depended entirely on the mighty Great Sage Equaling Heaven. When fire and wind destroyed the monastery, A black bear came one night to steal the silken cassock. If you don't know whether the cassock was found on this journey or how things turned out, listen to the explanation in the next installment."

玄奘法师大有缘，现前此物堪承受。浑如极乐活罗汉，赛过西方真觉秀。锡杖叮噹斗九环，毗卢帽映多丰厚。诚为佛子不虚传，胜似菩提无诈谬。当时文武阶前喝采，太宗喜之不胜，即着法师穿了袈裟，持了宝杖，又赐两队仪从，着多官送出朝门，教他上大街行道，往寺里去，就如中状元夸官的一般。这位玄奘再拜谢恩，在那大街上，烈烈轰轰，摇摇摆摆。你看那长安城里，行商坐贾、公子王孙、墨客文人、大男小女，无不争看夸奖，俱道：“好个法师！真是个活罗汉下降，活菩萨临凡。”玄奘直至寺里，僧人下榻来迎。一见他披此袈裟，执此锡杖，都道是地藏王来了，各各归依，侍于左右。玄奘上殿，炷香礼佛，又对众感述圣恩已毕，各归禅座。又不觉红轮西坠，正是那：日落烟迷草树，帝都钟鼓初鸣。叮叮三响断人行，前后御前寂静。上刹辉煌灯火，孤村冷落无声。禅僧入定理残经，正好炼魔养性。,"Master Xuanzang has a great predestined relationship, and now this thing is bearable. Like a blissful living Arhat, surpassing the Western True Jue Show. The tin stick is jingling and fighting with nine rings, and the Pilu hat is rich in reflection. Sincerity is true for the disciples of the Buddha, it is better than Bodhi without deceit. At that time, Taizong applauded in front of the civil and military steps, and Taizong was overjoyed, that is, the master wore a cassock, held a treasured staff, and gave two teams of ceremonial servants. The champion is generally praised by officials. This Xuanzang thanked Xie En again, and swayed and swayed on the street. You see in Chang'an city, the merchants, the sons, the kings, the literati, men and women, all vying for praise, all said: ""What a master! What a living Arhat descended, a living Bodhisattva came to the world."" Xuanzang went to the temple. Here, the monk stayed to welcome him. When they saw him wearing this cassock and holding this tin staff, they all knew that the king of Ksitigarbha had come. Xuanzang went up to the hall, worshipped the Buddha with incense sticks, and told the audience that the holy grace was over, and they all returned to their meditation seats. I didn't realize that the red wheel fell to the west, it was exactly that: the sunset smoke lost the grass and the trees, and the imperial capital bells and drums began to ring. Three ding dings cut off pedestrians, and the front and rear were silent. The lights on the last brake were brilliant, and the lonely village was silent. Zen monks enter the theorem and the residual scriptures, just to refine the devil's nature.","Great is the fortune of Xuanzang, the priest, Now most deserving of this precious thing. He seems a living arhat from the West, Or even better than its true elite. He holds his staff and all its nine rings clang, Benefic in his Vairocana hat. A true Buddha-child, it’s no idle tale, He matches the Bodhi and that’s no lie! The various officials, both civil and military, stood before the steps and shouted “Bravo!” Taizong could not have been more pleased, and he told the Master of the Law to keep his cassock on and the staff in his hands. Two regiments of honor guards were ordered to accompany him along with many other officials. They left the gate of the court and proceeded on the main streets toward the temple, and the whole entourage gave the impression that a zhuangyuan was making a tour of the city. The procession was a stirring sight indeed! The merchants and tradesmen in the city of Chang’an, the princes and noblemen, the men of ink and letters, the grown men and the little girls—they all vied to get a good view. Everyone exclaimed, “What a priest! He is truly a living arhat descended to Earth, a live bodhisattva coming to the world!” Xuanzang went right to the temple where he was met by all the monks leaving their seats. The moment they saw him wearing that cassock and holding the staff, they all said that King Kṣitigarbha23 had arrived! Everyone bowed to him and waited on him left and right. Going up to the main hall, Xuanzang lighted incense to honor the Buddha, after which he spoke of the emperor’s favor to the multitude. Thereafter, each went back to his assigned seat, and soon the fiery orb sank westward. So it was Sunset: mist hid trees and grasses; The capital’s first chimes rang out. Zheng-zheng they struck thrice, and human traffic ceased; Streets back and front soon grew quiet. Though lights burned bright at First Temple, The lone village was hush and mute. The monk focused to tend the sūtras still— Time to smelt demons, to nurse his spirit.24","Before long they heard a man cry out, “Holy monk, stop and take some food before you go.” It was one of the arhats that had helped to subjugate the demon. He held in his hand a golden bowl of rice, saying, “Holy monk, this bowl of rice was collected by Sun when he left you within the magic circle. Because you would not wait for him, you fell into the demon’s hands. Take it now and eat!” Thus was the bowl of food at last delivered to the Master. He was deeply grateful for his disciple’s efforts. Sun replied, “All this trouble happened because you went outside the magic circle I drew round you, but you thought you would be safe in other folds. It is all owing to your foolishness, Zhu the Pig! Fortunately, Buddha and the Ancient of Days put an end to the trouble and saved us.” 17 True Monkeys and False Monkeys ON THEIR WAY THE PILGRIMS MET a band of robbers, and Sun killed two of them. At night they lodged in the house of the father of the robber chieftain. The father and mother treated the pilgrims kindly, and gave them food and lodging. At midnight the gang of robbers, led by the son, returned to the house and discussed how they should take their revenge on the pilgrims. The father, overhearing their talk, secretly advised the pilgrims to depart early, which they did.","It was a modest spread: some unsauced bowls of tiger meat, alongside dishes of musk deer, snake, fox and rabbit flesh, and strips of venison jerky. The following morning, the family asked Tripitaka to begin the mass for Boqin’s father. After washing his hands, Tripitaka lit incense in the family shrine, bowed, and struck his wooden fish—a percussion instrument to accompany rituals—and spent the rest of the day reciting sutras. When evening came around once again, more incense was burned, along with paper gods and horses, and a written prayer for delivering the dead. That night, the soul of Boqin’s father visited all of the members of his family in their dreams. “I won’t lie to you,” he told them, “it’s been rough in the ranks of the damned and the unreincarnated. But things are looking up. Now that Tripitaka’s sutras have canceled out my sins, King Yama has approved my transmigratory transfer to a noble family in China. Do warmly thank Tripitaka on my behalf and see him safely on his way. Must dash, about to be reincarnated.” On waking, the family rushed to thank Tripitaka, who was delighted to hear about the dream message. He refused the ounce of silver they tried to press on him and asked instead that Boqin escort him part of the way west. Boqin’s mother baked him some biscuits for the journey, and the two men set out with three servants. After traveling for half a day, they came to a mountain so high that it seemed to stretch up to the sky. Boqin began skipping up the slope as if it were flat ground. Halfway across, though, he stopped. “You must go on alone from here,” he told Tripitaka, “for this is the Mountain of Two Frontiers: the eastern side belongs to the Tang, the western half to the Tartars. I’m not allowed to cross the border, and in any case I have no authority over the Tartar wolves.”","Great is the destiny of Xuanzang Master of the Law, Who is worthy to accept this gift at present. He is just like a living Arhat, Excelling the Enlightened One of the West. On the monkish staff the nine rings clink, And richly glows the Vairocana miter. How true that be is a Buddha's son; It is no lie that he has surpassed enlightenment. All the civil and military officials cried out with admiration, and the Emperor was delighted. Telling the Master of the Law to put the cassock on properly and take the staff, he granted him two bands of ceremonial attendants and had a host of officials see him out of the palace and walk with him to his monastery. It was just like the procession for a top graduate in the palace examination. Xuanzang bowed once more to thank the Emperor and then set out, striding majestically along the highway. All the travelling merchants, the shop-keepers, the fashionable young men, the professional scribes, the men and women, young and old, in the city of Chang'an fought to get a look at him and praise him. “What a splendid Master of the Law,” they said. “He's an Arhat come down to earth, a living Bodhisattva come to see us mortals.” Xuanzang went straight to his monastery, where all the monks left their places of meditation to welcome him. When they saw the cassock he was wearing and the staff in his hand they all said that King Ksitigarbha had come, did homage to him, and stood in attendance to right and left. Ascending the main hall, Xuanzang burned incense and worshipped Buddha, and when he had given an account of the Emperor's grade they all returned to their seats for meditation. Nobody noticed that the red wheel of the sun was now sinking in the West. As the sun sinks, plants and trees are veiled in mist While the capital echoes to the bell and drum. After three chimes of the bell nobody moves: The streets throughout the city are still. The monastery gleams with the light of its lamps; The village is lonely and silent. The Chan monks enter the trance and repair damaged sutras. A good way to purify oneself of evil and nourish the true nature."
“孙老爷说得是。一则天晚，二来我等有些愿心儿，今幸平安，有了宝贝，待我还了愿，请老爷散了福，明早再送西行。”行者道：“正是，正是。”你看那些和尚，都倾囊倒底，把那火里抢出的余资，各出所有，整顿了些斋供，烧了些平安无事的纸，念了几卷消灾解厄的经。当晚事毕。,"""Master Sun is right. One night, I'll wait for some wishes. Today, I'm lucky to be safe. I have a baby. When I repay my wishes, I ask the master to disperse the blessings and send them westward in the morning."" Yes, that's right."" Look at those monks, they all poured out their pockets, took out the remaining funds from the fire, gave everything, organized some fast offerings, burned some safe papers, and read a few scrolls. The Sutra of Disaster Relief. The night is over.","All the monks knelt down and said, “Elder Sun is right. It is getting late, and, moreover, we have a vow to fulfill. Now that we are all saved and the treasure has been recovered, we must redeem our vow and ask the venerable elders to distribute the blessing.1 Tomorrow we shall see you off to the West.” “Yes, yes, that’s very good!” said Pilgrim. Look at those monks! They all emptied their pockets and presented all the valuables they had managed to salvage from the fire. Everyone made some contribution. They prepared some vegetarian offerings, burned paper money to request perpetual peace, and recited several scrolls of scriptures for the prevention of calamities and deliverance from evil. The service lasted until late in the evening.",,"“I don’t really feel like monk today. What I fancy is a nice bit of pig’s ear. D’you have anything like that?” “Curse you!” spat Pigsy. “How about I tell them their mother’s grown a tail?” This outburst unfortunately blew Monkey’s cover. Some patrol goblins also happened to rush in at this moment with more bad news: “Disaster, great king! Monkey has beaten your mother to death and infiltrated the cave in disguise.”","The monks all knelt and said, “Lord Monkey is right. For one thing it's too late, and for another we made a vow. Now that all is well and the treasure has been recovered, we would like to carry out that vow and invite Your Lordships to share in the thanksgiving meal. Tomorrow morning we'll see you off on your way West.” “Yes, yes,” urged Monkey. The monks then emptied their bags and produced everything that was left of what they had saved from the fire to make an offering of food. Then they burnt some paper to bring blessings and recited some sutras to ward off disaster. The ceremonies were finished that evening."
怎么不走路？还在此做甚？”三藏抬头道：“你往那里去来？教我行又不敢行，动又不敢动，只管在此等你。”行者道：“我往东洋大海老龙王家讨茶吃吃。”三藏道：“徒弟啊，出家人不要说谎。你离了我，没多一个时辰，就说到龙王家吃茶？”行者笑道：,"Why don't you walk? What are you still doing here? Sanzang raised his head and said, ""Where are you going?"" Teach me to do it and dare not do it, move and dare not do it, just wait for you here. The walker said: ""I went to the old dragon king's house in the East Ocean to ask for tea and food. ""Sanzang said: ""Apprentice, monks, don't lie. You left me, and it didn't take more than an hour to talk about tea at the Dragon King's house? ""The walker laughed:","He approached him and said, “Master, why are you not on the road? What are you doing here?” “Where have you been?” asked Tripitaka, looking up. “Your absence has forced me to sit here and wait for you, not daring to walk or move.” Pilgrim replied, “I just went to the home of the old Dragon King at the Eastern Ocean to ask for some tea.” “Disciple,” said Tripitaka, “those who have left the family should not lie. It was less than an hour since you left me, and you claim to have had tea at the home of the Dragon King?” “To tell you the truth,” said Pilgrim, laughing, “I know how to cloud somersault, and a single somersault will carry me one hundred and eight thousand miles.","Sun carried this promise to Heaven to show the Jade Emperor. Whilst he was presenting this, the spirit, whose duty it was to report the quantities of incense burnt, announced that the rice and flour mountains had both fallen and disappeared, and that the metal lock had been broken. After this, rain fell to the great joy of all. The people offered money to the pilgrims for what they had done, but they would not receive any. The officials and people escorted them thirty li on their journey, and parted with them in tears. The Master, much pleased with the events at Fengshan, rode on his way, and arrived at a religious gathering at Yuhua, a most flourishing place, where rice was sold at four candarins per ten bushels, and oil for ten cash per catty. By this time they had traveled eighteen thousand li from China, and had been fourteen years on the road. The True Illustrious Religion is not human,","“Pigsy goes into the river.” Pigsy was understandably reluctant. “This time, I promise to control myself,” Monkey reassured him. “Get him onto dry land and I’ll block his escape route into the river.” Back Pigsy went with his rake, bursting in just as the fiend was waking up. The monster immediately jumped up and the battle restarted, both combatants energetically insulting the other’s weapon, until Pigsy feigned defeat once more and returned to the surface. “Come and fight me on solid ground, wretch!”","He went up to him and said, “Why aren't you travelling, master? What are you still here for?” Sanzang looked up. “Where have you been?” he asked. “I couldn't move without you, so I had to sit here and wait till you came back.” “I went to visit the Old Dragon King of the Eastern Sea to ask him for some tea,” Monkey replied. “Disciple, a religious man shouldn't tell lies. How can you say that you went to drink tea at the dragon king's place when you haven't been gone two hours?” “I can tell you quite truthfully,” replied Monkey with a smile, “that with my somersault cloud I can cover thirty-six thousand miles in a single bound."
却说那禅师见他三众前来，即便离了巢穴，跳下树来。三藏下马奉拜，那禅师用手搀道：“圣僧请起，失迎，失迎。”八戒道：“老禅师，作揖了。”禅师惊问道：“你是福陵山猪刚鬣，怎么有此大缘，得与圣僧同行？”八戒道：“前年蒙观音菩萨劝善，愿随他做个徒弟。”禅师大喜道：“好，好，好！”又指定行者，问道：,"But he said that the Zen master jumped down from the tree when he saw his three groups coming, even after leaving the nest. Sanzang dismounted from his horse and worshipped, and the Zen master said with his hand: ""The holy monk invites you, but you are not welcome."" How can I have such a great predestined relationship to walk with the holy monk?"" Bajie said, ""I was persuaded by Guanyin Bodhisattva to be kind last year, and I would like to follow him as an apprentice."" The Zen master was overjoyed and said, ""Good, good, good!"" road:","Tripitaka urged on his horse and rode up to the tree. We now tell you about that Chan Master, who, seeing the three of them approach, left his nest and jumped down from the tree. Tripitaka dismounted and prostrated himself.

Pardon me for not coming to meet you.” “Old Chan Master,” said Eight Rules, “please receive my bow!” “Aren’t you the Zhu Ganglie of the Fuling Mountain?” asked the Chan Master, startled. “How did you have the good fortune to journey with the holy monk?” “A few years back,” said Eight Rules, “I was beholden to the Bodhisattva Guanyin for persuading me to follow him as a disciple.” “Good! Good! Good!” said the Chan Master, greatly pleased.",,"If you succeed in bringing rain, I will pardon you and let you continue on your journey to the west. Fail and you will be publicly executed.” “You’re on!” whooped Monkey. As soon as the rain-making altar had been built, Tiger-Strength swaggered up to it. “How rude!” teased Monkey.","Sanzang gave his horse the rein, whipped it on, and went straight to the foot of the tree. When the hermit saw the three of them coming he jumped down from his bird's nest. Sanzang dismounted and bowed to him, and only then the hermit reply, helping him up, “Please arise, holy priest. I'm sorry I did not welcome you properly.” “Greetings, venerable hermit,” said Pig. “Aren't you the Iron-haired Pig from the Mount of Blessing? How have you had the great good fortune of travelling with a holy monk?” “Last year,” replied Pig, “I was converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin, and I swore that I'd go with him as his disciple.” “Wonderful, wonderful,” exclaimed the delighted hermit, who then pointed at Monkey and asked, “Who is this gentleman?” “Old hermit,” said Monkey, “how is it that you know him but didn't recognize me?”"
太宗只得随他两个，引路前来。径行数里，忽见一座高山，阴云垂地，黑雾迷空。太宗道：“崔先生，那厢是甚么山？”判官道：,"Taizong had to follow the two of them and lead the way. After walking for a few miles, I suddenly saw a high mountain, with overcast clouds hanging over the ground, and the black mist obscuring the sky. Taizong said: ""Mr. Cui, what kind of mountain is that carriage?"" The judge said:","Taizong had little alternative but to follow their lead. They had gone only a few miles when they came upon a tall mountain. Dark clouds touched the ground around it, and black mists shrouded the sky. “Mr. Cui,” said Taizong, “what mountain is this?” The judge said, “It’s the Mountain of Perpetual Shade in the Region of Darkness.”","Originally the heart is in harmony with the Divine, But when caught in the various nets of the world, It finds it not easy to avoid mistakes.

行者辞了菩萨，按落云头，将袈裟挂在香楠树上，掣出棒来，打入黑风洞里。那洞里那得一个小妖？原来是他见菩萨出现，降得那老怪就地打滚，急急都散走了。行者一发行凶，将他那几层门上，都积了干柴，前前后后，一齐发火，把个黑风洞烧做个红风洞，却拿了袈裟，驾祥光，转回直北。,"The practitioner resigned from the Bodhisattva, pressed down the cloud head, hung the cassock on the incense nan tree, pulled out a stick, and drove it into the Batu Caves. Is there a little monster in that cave? It turned out that when he saw the Bodhisattva appear, the old monster rolled on the ground and dispersed in a hurry. As soon as the traveler was murdered, he piled up dry wood on the doors of his several floors.

The fact of the matter was that when they saw the Bodhisattva’s epiphany, causing the old monster to roll all over the ground, they all scattered. Pilgrim, however, was not to be stopped; he piled dried wood around the several doorways in the cave and started a fire in the front and in the back. The whole Black Wind Cave was reduced to a “Red Wind Cave”! Picking up the cassock, Pilgrim then mounted the auspicious luminosity and went north.",,"After five or so miles, “Lounging Dragon” plucked a hair from his chest and transformed it into an enormous flatbread, then sat down and began to nibble on it. “Can we have some, too?” asked the carriers, pausing for a rest. As they approached, Monkey pounded both into mush. Disturbed by the whimpers of pain, the Monstress Dowager looked out of the sedan and was also pulverized by Monkey, who quickly located and tucked up his sleeve the Golden Rope. Then he transformed himself into the old woman, plucked three more hairs to stand in for the rest of the goblin party, and carried on toward Lotus-Flower Cave.","The Great Sage Removes a Monster from Gao Village Taking his leave of the Bodhisattva, Monkey brought his cloud in to land, hung the cassock on a nanmu tree, pulled out his cudgel, charged into the Black Wind Cave, and found not a single goblin inside. This was because the appearance of the Bodhisattva in her true form had so terrified them that they had fled in all directions. Evil thoughts welled up in Brother Monkey, and after piling dry firewood all around the multi-storied gate he set it alight, turning the Black Wind Cave into a Red Wind Cave. Then he went back to the North on a beam of magic light."
那四大天王收兵罢战，众各报功：有拿住虎豹的，有拿住狮象的，有拿住狼虫狐骆的，更不曾捉着一个猴精。当时果又安辕营，下大寨，赏劳了得功之将，吩咐了天罗地网之兵，个个提铃喝号，围困了花果山，专待明早大战。各人得令，一处处谨守。此正是：妖猴作乱惊天地，布网张罗昼夜看。毕竟天晓后如何处治，且听下回分解。,"The four great heavenly kings withdrew their troops and stopped fighting, and all of them repaid their merits: some caught tigers and leopards, some caught lions and elephants, some caught wolves, worms, foxes, and Luos, and they never caught a monkey spirit. At that time, Guo set up the camp again, went down to Dazhai, rewarded the generals who got the merits, ordered the soldiers of the heaven and earth to ring the bells and shouted, and besieged Huaguo Mountain, waiting for the battle in the morning. Everyone is ordered to be careful everywhere. This is exactly what the demon monkeys are in chaos, and the nets are spread out day and night to watch. After all, how to deal with it after dawn, let's listen to the decomposition next time.","When those Four Devarājas retired their troops and stopped their fighting, each one of the Heavenly commanders came to report his accomplishment. There were those who had captured lions and elephants and those who had apprehended wolves, crawling creatures, and foxes. Not a single monkey monster, however, had been seized. The camp was then secured, a great tent was pitched, and those commanders with meritorious services were rewarded. The soldiers in charge of the cosmic nets were ordered to carry bells and were given passwords. They encircled the Flower-Fruit Mountain to await the great battle of the next day, and each soldier everywhere diligently kept his watch. So this is the situation: The fiendish monkey riots through Heaven and Earth, But the net spreads open, ready night and day. We do not know what took place after the next morning; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.","The Four Guardians of Heaven called back their soldiers after the battle and rewarded them according to their respective merits. They had seized tigers and leopards and wolves without number, but had not got a single monkey amongst them. Those who toiled hard were rewarded, and all the companies of soldiers were thick like bees, and were called together to surround the Mountain Garden, only waiting for the daylight to begin the great battle. All were on the watch to hear the command of the prince.","And after a few bowls of coconut wine, all the monkeys fell asleep.","When the four Heavenly Kings had withdrawn their troops and ended the battle, those who had distinguished themselves reported what they had done. Some had captured tigers and leopards, some lions and elephants, and others wolves and raccoon-dogs, but not one single monkey goblin had been taken. Then they built a mighty stockade around their camp. Commanders who had distinguished themselves wee rewarded, and the soldiers who made up the heaven-and-earth nets were ordered to surround the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, holding bells and shouting, ready for a great battle the next day. Every man heard the orders, and they were strictly obeyed. Indeed: A wicked monkey made chaos, shocking heaven and earth, So they spread their nets and watched by night and day. Listen to the next installment to hear how he was dealt with the following morning."
那大仙临行，又叮咛嘱咐道：“我那果子有数，只许与他两个，不得多费。”清风道：“开园时，大众共吃了两个，还有二十八个在树，不敢多费。”大仙道：“唐三藏虽是故人，须要防备他手下人罗唣，不可惊动他知。”二童领命讫，那大仙承众徒弟飞升，径朝天界。,"When the great immortal left, he exhorted again: ""I have several fruits, I can only share two with him, and I don't need to pay more."" Qingfeng said: ""When the garden opened, the public ate two, and there were twenty-eight left in the tree. Don't dare to spend too much."" Daxian said, ""Although Tang Sanzang is an old friend, he must beware of Luo Su, his subordinate, and he must not be alerted."" Ertong took the lead, and the Daxian ascended to the heavens with his disciples.","As the Great Immortal was about to leave, he cautioned them again, saying, “Those fruits of mine are all numbered. You may give him two, but no more.” “When the garden was opened to the public,” said Clear Breeze, “we shared and ate two of the fruits; there should be still twenty-eight of them on the tree. We wouldn’t think of using any more than you have told us to.” The Great Immortal said, “Though Tripitaka Tang is an old friend, his disciples, I fear, may be somewhat rowdy. It’s best not to let them know about the fruits.” After he had finished giving these instructions to the two lads, the Great Immortal ascended to the region of Heaven with all his disciples.",,"While we come up with a plan to destroy this fiend, I want you to move the little boys inside their coops to some mountain valley or forest outside the city. I need you to keep them safe, fed, and happy for a day or two. When I’ve dealt with this demon, brought the king to his senses, and restored order to the kingdom, you can bring the boys back.” The obedient spirits descended onto the city, where the temperature suddenly plummeted with freezing fog and wind. While the parents took shelter from the cold, the gale swept up the 1,111 coops and the boys inside. By about midnight, every coop had been secreted outside the city walls. Waking at dawn the next day, Tripitaka immediately dressed for his visit to court. “I’m coming, too,” Monkey reminded him. “You might not be able to manage on your own.” “But you’re not very good with protocol,” Tripitaka worried. “You might offend the king.” “I’ll go in disguise, then.” Tripitaka told Pigsy and Sandy to mind the luggage and the horse, and the stationmaster reminded Tripitaka in a whisper not to ask about matters that did not concern him. Then they set off for the court:","Just as he was on the point of setting out, the Great Immortal gave them some more instructions: “There are a limited number of those manfruits. You must only give two, and not one more.” “When the garden was opened we all shared two,” said the boys, “and there are twenty-eight now left on the tree. We won't use more than two.” “Although the Tang Priest is an old friend of mine,” said the Great Immortal, “you must be on your guard against his ruffian followers, and you mustn't let them know about the manfruit.” The Great Immortal then flew up to Heaven with the rest of his disciples."

那呆子拉着马，有草处且不教吃草，嗒嗒嗤嗤的赶着马，转到后门首去，只见那妇人，带了三个女子，在后门外闲立着，看菊花儿耍子。他娘女们看见八戒来时，三个女儿闪将进去，那妇人伫立门首道：“小长老那里去？”这呆子丢了缰绳，上前唱个喏，道声：“娘！我来放马的。”那妇人道：“你师父忒弄精细，在我家招了女婿，却不强似做挂搭僧，往西跄路？”八戒笑道：“他们是奉了唐王的旨意，不敢有违君命，不肯干这件事。,"The idiot pulled the horse, there was grass, and he didn't teach him to eat grass, he drove the horse to the back door, and saw the woman, with three women, standing idle outside the back door, watching Chrysanthemums play tricks. When his wives saw Bajie coming, the three daughters were about to enter, and the woman stood at the door and said, ""Where are you going, little elder?"" The idiot lost the reins, stepped forward and sang, ""Mother! I'm here to let the horses go."" The woman said, ""Your master is so meticulous that he hired a son-in-law at my house, but it's not as strong as a hanging monk, going west?"" Bajie smiled and said, ""They enshrined the king of Tang. The will of the emperor, dare not go against the king's order, and refuse to do it.","Idiot pulled the horse out to where there was grass, but he did not graze him there. Shouting and whooping, he chased the horse instead to the rear of the house, where he found the woman standing outside the door with three girls, enjoying the sight of some chrysanthemums. When mother and daughters saw Eight Rules approaching, the three girls slipped inside the house at once, but the woman stood still beside the door and said, “little elder, where are you going?” Our Idiot threw away the reins and went up to greet her with a most friendly “Hello!” Then he said, “Mama, I came to graze the horse.” “Your master is much too squeamish,” said the woman. “If he took a wife in our family, he would be much better off, wouldn’t he, than being a mendicant trudging to the West?” “Well, they all have received the command of the Tang emperor,” said Eight Rules, with a laugh, “and they haven’t the courage to disobey the ruler’s decree. That’s why they are unwilling to do this thing.",,"Your son was about to eat my teacher. And now he’s living the good life, up with Guanyin.” “All right, I’ll let you off for that one. But why did you attack my concubine?” “Oh, that.” Monkey laughed. “I didn’t know where to find you, so I asked her ever so nicely for some directions.","Instead of letting the horse eat what grass there was, the blockhead chivied and dragged it round to the back door of the house, where he saw the woman and her three daughters admiring some chrysanthemums. When they saw Pig coming, the three girls rushed inside, while their mother remained standing in front of him. “Where are you going, reverend sir?” she asked. The idiot dropped the horse's bridle, greeted her respectfully, and said, “I'm pasturing the horse, mother.” “That master of yours is too prim and proper,” she said. “Wouldn't you rather marry here than go on plodding West as a travelling monk?” “They're under orders from the Tang Emperor,” Pig replied with a grin, “and are too scared of disobeying him to do a thing like this."
叔宝、茂功道：“千步廊南，十字街头，云端里落下这颗龙头，微臣不敢不奏。”唐王惊问魏征：“此是何说？”魏征转身叩头道：,"Shubao and Maogong said, ""South of the Qianbu Gallery, on the cross street, in the clouds, this dragon's head fell from the clouds. Wei Chen dare not stop playing it."" The king of Tang asked Wei Zheng in shock, ""What is this?"" Wei Zheng turned around and kowtowed:","“South of the Thousand-Step Corridor,” replied Shubao and Mougong, “at the crossroads, this dragon head fell from the clouds. Your lowly subjects dare not withhold it from you.” In alarm, the Tang emperor asked Wei Zheng, “What’s the meaning of this?” Turning to kowtow to him, Wei Zheng said, “This dragon was executed just now by your subject in his dream.”","He said, “I am grateful to you, Great Sage, for sparing my life.” The Monkey was invited to see Guanyin, to whom he told his story. She said, “Do not be troubled, I have drops of water that will restore your trees to life.” She at once returned with him, and although the trees were dead and uprooted, by application of the drops, they were fully renewed, leaves and fruit were produced and ten mandrakes were picked and shared by the assembled immortals.","“What is the meaning of this, Wei Zheng?” asked the alarmed emperor.","“This dragon's head fell from a cloud at the crossroads at the end of the Thousand Yard Portico, and your humble subjects dared not fail to report it,” said Qin Shubao and Xu Maogong. “What does this mean?” the Tang Emperor asked Wei Zheng in astonishment. “Your subject beheaded it in a dream just now,” replied Wei Zheng, kowtowing."

第一回,First time,ONE,1,,Chapter 1
话说那三藏望行者急忙不来，心甚疑惑，不知是请菩萨不至，不知是行者托故而逃，正在那胡猜乱想之中，只见半空中彩雾灿灿，行者忽坠阶前，叫道：“师父，袈裟来了。”三藏大喜，众僧亦无不欢悦道：“好了！好了！我等性命，今日方才得全了。”三藏接了袈裟道：“悟空，你早间去时，原约到饭罢晌午，如何此时日西方回？”行者将那请菩萨施变化降妖的事情，备陈了一遍，三藏闻言，遂设香案，朝南礼拜罢，道：“徒弟啊，既然有了佛衣，可快收拾包裹去也。”行者道：“莫忙，莫忙。今日将晚，不是走路的时候，且待明日早行。”众僧们一齐跪下道：,"It is said that the Sanzang Wangxing person was in a hurry and he was very doubtful. He didn’t know if he invited the Bodhisattva to come, and he didn’t know if the practitioner fled because of this reason. While he was in the middle of his wild speculations, he saw the colorful mist in the mid-air, and the walker suddenly fell in front of the steps. , shouted: ""Master, the cassock is here."" Sanzang was overjoyed, and all the monks said happily: ""Alright! Alright! I'm waiting for my life, and I'll have it all today."" Sanzang took the cassock and said, ""Wukong, you When I left in the morning, it was originally scheduled to stop for lunch, so how can I return to the west at this time?"" The practitioner prepared the matter of asking the Bodhisattva to transform and subdue the demon. Sanzang heard the words, set up the incense table, and bowed to the south. Said: ""Apprentice, since you have the Buddhist robes, you can quickly pack up and go."" The walker said: ""Don't be busy, don't be busy. Today is late, not the time to walk, and to leave early tomorrow."" All the monks together Kneeling down and saying:","We now tell you about Tripitaka, who was impatiently waiting for Pilgrim’s return and wondering whether Bodhisattva had consented to come and help, or whether Pilgrim on some pretext had left him. He was filled with such foolish thoughts and wild speculations when he saw bright, rose-colored clouds approaching in the sky. Dropping at the foot of the steps and kneeling, Pilgrim said, “Master, the cassock is here!” Tripitaka was most delighted, and not one of the monks could hide his pleasure. “Good! Good!” they cried. “Now we’ve found our lives again!” Taking the cassock, Tripitaka said, “Wukong, when you left in the morning, you promised to come back either after breakfast or sometime around noon. Why do you return so late, when the sun is already setting?” Pilgrim then gave a thorough account of how he went to ask for the Bodhisattva’s help, and how she in her transformation had subdued the monster. When Tripitaka heard the account, he prepared an incense table at once and worshipped, facing south. Then he said, “Disciple, since we have the Buddha robe, let us pack up and leave.” “No need to rush like that,” said Pilgrim. “It’s getting late, hardly the time to travel. Let’s wait until tomorrow morning before we leave.” All the monks knelt down and said, “Elder Sun is right.",,"Then he transformed himself into the old woman, plucked three more hairs to stand in for the rest of the goblin party, and carried on toward Lotus-Flower Cave. Soon enough this curious ensemble reached their destination, and Monkey swaggered into the cave, in grandiloquent imitation of the dowager, to a resplendent reception: the cave’s full detail of fiends, drums, and flutes, wisps of perfumed smoke from an enormous urn, and kowtows from Golden Horn and Silver Horn. Pigsy suddenly giggled. “What’s so funny?” Sandy asked sourly. “It’s our mutual friend.” “Who?” “Monkey!” “How d’you know?” “When he bent over to return the monsters’ greetings, his tail rode up. Being hung up on this high beam certainly gives you perspective.” Sandy shushed him. “Let’s hear what they’re saying.” “We have neglected you recently, dearest Mother,” one of the brothers began. “Today we captured an exceptionally virtuous and tender monk, and plan to steam him for your delectation. He’s rich in longevity.” “I don’t really feel like monk today.","Sanzang, who had been anxiously waiting for him, was beginning to wonder why he had not come back. Had the Bodhisattva not come when asked to, or had Monkey just made up a story to escape? As he was being racked by these desperate thoughts, a shimmering cloud appeared in mid-air and Monkey came down and knelt before him. “Master, here's the cassock,” he announced, to Sanzang's great joy. All the monks of the temple were delighted too, and they exclaimed, “Wonderful, wonderful, our lives are safe at last.” “Monkey,” said Sanzang as he took the cassock from him, “when you set out this morning you reckoned that it would only take the length of a meal, or until midday at longest. Why have you only come back now, at sunset?” When Monkey gave him a full account of how he had asked the Bodhisattva to transform herself to subdue the monster, Sanzang set up an incense table and bowed low to the South. That done, he said, “Disciple, now that we have the Buddha's robe, pack our luggage as quickly as you can.” “Not so fast, not so fast,” Monkey replied. “It's already evening, too late to hit the road. Let's set out tomorrow morning.” The monks all knelt and said, “Lord Monkey is right."
三藏不解其意，太宗笑道：“御弟呵，这一去，到西天，几时可回？”三藏道：“只在三年，径回上国。”太宗道：“日久年深，山遥路远，御弟可进此酒：宁恋本乡一捻土，莫爱他乡万两金。”三藏方悟捻土之意，复谢恩饮尽，辞谢出关而去。唐王驾回。毕竟不知此去何如，且听下回分解。,"Sanzang didn't understand what he meant, so Taizong smiled and said, ""Brother Yu, when you go to the West, when can you return?"" Sanzang said: ""It will only take three years to return to the country."" The mountain is far away and the road is far away, so the royal brother can enter this wine: I would rather love a twist of soil in my hometown, and don’t love a thousand taels of gold in a foreign country.” Sanzang Fang realized the meaning of twisting the soil, drank his gratitude, and left the customs after saying goodbye. Tang Wang drove back. After all, I don't know what to do, let's listen to the next decomposition.","Tripitaka had no idea what this gesture meant. “Dear Brother,” said Taizong, laughing, “how long will it take you to come back from this trip to the Western Heaven?” “Probably in three years time,” said Tripitaka, “I’ll be returning to our noble nation.” “The years are long and the journey is great,” said Taizong. “Drink this, Royal Brother, and remember: Treasure a handful of dirt from your home, But love not ten thousand taels of foreign gold.” Then Tripitaka understood the meaning of the handful of dirt sprinkled in his cup; he thanked the emperor once more and drained the cup. He went out of the gate and left, as the Tang emperor returned in his carriage. We do not know what will happen to him on this journey; let’s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.","The false Sun asserted exactly the same thing, and the Jade Emperor was not able to decide which was the true Monkey King. Then all decided to go and see the Master, and let him decide which was which. On being confronted with them, the Master realized that the one who had robbed and beaten him must have been a demon. But the two were so exactly alike, and each asserted the same of the other, that even the Master could not decide between them. Then they decided to go to hell and search the records there. But it was equally in vain, as no monkey name had been preserved there since the Monkey King had visited them and confused their records. Therefore none there could decide.","When you were young, you gathered firewood and carried vegetables right in front of me.” “What?” “I’m the monkey from the stone casket on the Mountain of Two Frontiers. Recognize me now?” “You do look a little familiar,” conceded the old man. “But how did you get out?” After Monkey had relayed his experiences of the past five hundred years, the old man called his wife and children together to join them for a convivial vegetarian meal.","Seeing Sanzang's incomprehension, Taizong laughed and said, “Dear brother, when will you return from this journey to the Western Heaven?” “I shall be back in this country within three years,” Sanzang replied. “The days and years will be long, the mountains will be high, and the road will lead you far away,” said Taizong, “so you should drink this wine to show that you have more love for a pinch of dust from home than fir thousands of ounces of foreign gold.” Only then did Sanzang understand the significance of the pinch of dust, and thanking the Emperor once more he drained the cup, took his leave of him, and went out through the checkpoint. The Emperor went back to the palace. If you don't know what happened on the journey, listen to the explanation in the next installment."
八节山中随放性，四时湖里任陶情。采薪自有仙家兴，垂钓全无世俗形。门外野花香艳艳，船头绿水浪平平。身安不说三公位，性定强如十里城。十里城高防阃令，三公位显听宣声。乐山乐水真是罕，谢天谢地谢神明。”他二人既各道词章，又相联诗句，行到那分路去处，躬身作别。张稍道：“李兄呵，途中保重！上山仔细看虎。假若有些凶险，正是明日街头少故人！”李定闻言，大怒道：“你这厮惫懒！好朋友也替得生死，你怎么咒我？我若遇虎遭害，你必遇浪翻江！”张稍道：“我永世也不得翻江。”李定道：“天有不测风云，人有暂时祸福。你怎么就保得无事？”张稍道：“李兄，你虽这等说，你还没捉摸；不若我的生意有捉摸，定不遭此等事。”李定道：“你那水面上营生，极凶极险，隐隐暗暗，有甚么捉摸？”张稍道：“你是不晓得。这长安城里，西门街上，有一个卖卦的先生。我每日送他一尾金色鲤，他就与我袖传一课，依方位，百下百着。今日我又去买卦，他教我在泾河湾头东边下网，西岸抛钓，定获满载鱼虾而归。明日上城来，卖钱沽酒，再与老兄相叙。”二人从此叙别。,"In the Bajie Mountains, you are free to let go, and in the lake at four seasons, you can be full of love. There is Xianjiaxing for the salary, and there is no secular form in fishing. The wildflowers are fragrant outside the door, and the green water and waves are flat on the bow. Body security not to mention the three public positions, the character is as strong as a ten-mile city. Shili City has a high defense order, and the three public positions are clearly heard. Leshan Leshui is really rare, thank God thank God. ""The two of them have their own words and chapters, but also linked poems. They walked to the branch and bowed to say goodbye. Zhang Shao said: ""Brother Li, take care on the way!"" Go up the mountain and watch the tiger carefully. If it's a little dangerous, it's the little old friends on the streets tomorrow! ""Li Ding heard the words and said angrily: ""You are tired and lazy! Good friends also live and die for me, how can you curse me? If I encounter tigers and suffer, you will encounter waves and turn the river! ""Zhang Shao said: ""I will never cross the river. ""Li Ding said: ""There are unforeseen circumstances in the sky, and there are temporary blessings and misfortunes for people. How can you be safe? Zhang Shao said: ""Brother Li, even though you are talking like this, you haven't figured it out yet; if my business were elusive, I wouldn't have encountered such a thing."" ""Li Dingdao: ""You live on the water, it is extremely vicious and dangerous, and it is faint and dark. What's wrong with you?"" ""Zhang Shao said:"" You don't know. In this city of Chang'an, on Ximen Street, there is a gentleman who sells fortunes. I gave him a golden carp every day, and he passed on a lesson with me. Today, I went to buy hexagrams again, and he taught me to cast the net on the east side of Jinghe Bay, and cast fishing on the west bank. Come to the city tomorrow, sell money and wine, and talk to my brother. ""The two said their goodbyes.","Throughout the year I roam free in the hills; In all four climes I sail the lakes at will. Gathering wood I own the immortals’ feel; Dropping my rod, I sport no worldly form. My door’s wild blossoms are fragrant and bright; My stem’s green water flows calm and serene. Content, I seek not the Three Dukes’ seats.12 Like a ten-mile city my nature’s firm. Cities, though tall, must resist a siege; Dukes, though of high rank, must the summon heed. Delight in hills and streams is truly rare. Thank Heaven, thank Earth, let’s thank the gods! The two of them thus recited poems and songs and composed linking-verses. Arriving at the place where their ways parted, they bowed to take leave of each other. “Elder Brother Li,” said Zhang Shao, “take care as you go on your way. When you climb the mountains, be wary of the tiger. If you were harmed, I would find, as the saying goes, one friend missing on the street tomorrow.” When Li Ding heard these words, he grew very angry saying, “What a scoundrel you are! Good friends would even die for each other! But you, why do you say such unlucky things to me? If I’m to be harmed by a tiger, your boat will surely capsize in the river.” “I’ll never capsize my boat in the river,” said Zhang Shao. Li Ding said, “As There are unexpected storms in the sky So there is sudden weal or woe with man.13 What makes you so sure that you won’t have an accident?” “Elder Brother Li,” said Zhang Shao, “you say this because you have no idea what may befall you in your business, whereas I can predict what’ll happen in my kind of business. And I assure you that I won’t have any accident.” “The kind of living you pick up on the waters,” said Li Ding, “is an exceedingly treacherous business. You have to take chances all the time. How can you be so certain about your future?” “Here’s something you don’t know about,” said Zhang Shao. “In this city of Chang’an, there’s a fortune teller who plies his trade on the West Gate Street. Every day I give him a golden carp as a present, and he consults the sticks in his sleeve for me. I follow his instructions when I lower my nets, and I’ve never missed in a hundred times. Today I went again to buy his prediction; he told me to set my nets at the east bend of the Jing River and to cast my line from the west bank. I know I’ll come back with a fine catch of fishes and shrimps. When I go up to the city tomorrow, I’ll sell my catch and buy some wine, and then I’ll get together with you again, old brother.” The two men then parted.","Zhu Bajie took his nine pronged spear and said, “Come on, I will soon finish you.” At a touch of his spear, the tiger, who was really a wind demon said, “We are a party sent ahead by the king of this mountain, to kill some mortals for dinner. What kind of Buddhist monk are you to carry deadly weapons like this?” Zhu Bajie replied, “You are greatly mistaken to think that we are ordinary mortals, we are come from China, and are going to the West in search of the Sacred Scriptures.” Meanwhile one of the demon chief’s generals seized the Master himself, and carried him to the chief, who told him to be careful not to eat him, or harm him, as he had two terrible disciples. Xuanzang began weeping for fear. Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie had not been there to protect the Master because they had been deceived by the demon who had taken the form of a tiger, and were busy chasing him down a mountain. But it turned out that the tiger was only a tiger’s skin. The two disciples were in great distress, not knowing where their Master had been carried, but finally, they found him in the Cave of the Yellow Ridge, and cried out, “Deliver up our Master at once, or we shall destroy your nest!” At this the demon chief was frightened, and said to the tiger, “I sent you to catch some cattle to eat, why did you bring a Buddhist pilgrim?” The tiger ran away, but was killed by Zhu. Sun went to the cave to look for his Master. Whilst the demon chief in the Cave of the Yellow Ridge was thinking of what to do, the Monkey outside killed a tiger doorkeeper. At this the demon chief put on his clothes, took with him his trident and went out with a host of demon followers. At the sight of the Monkey, not four feet high, he laughed, and asked, “Who art thou to think that I cannot master thee easily?” The Monkey said, “Only strike me and I shall grow.” He struck, and the Monkey at once was six feet, and then ten feet tall. They fought for a long time and neither was victor. Then the Monkey plucked a hair, chewed it, blew it out, and cried, “Change,” and he was changed into ten identical monkeys, each holding a steel spear. At this the demon chief opened his mouth as wide as ten feet and blew out a typhoon, which made the little monkeys turn about in the air like paper mills. At this the Monkey recalled his magic monkeys and fought alone. The demon blew at him so hard that the Monkey could not open his eyelids and was blind. After this the Monkey went to a village to get eye medicine, and to lodge and rest for the night. His host said, “This is not ordinary wind, it is the epidemic wind of false religion.”","Finally, the mountain lover, one Li Ding, made a more practical point about life on the river. “Working on the water is a treacherous business. Anything could happen to you.” “Not if you’re me,” answered his friend, Zhang Shao. “I know a fortune-teller on West Gate Street in Chang’an—he’s never wrong. I give him a golden carp every day and he predicts where I should cast. Every day I net pounds of fish and shrimp. I’ll sell tomorrow’s catch in the city, buy some wine, and treat you to a drink or six later.” And the two went their separate ways.","Throughout the year one does as he pleases in the hills; In all four seasons the other is happy on the lake. By gathering firewood you can become an Immortal; There is nothing worldly about fishing. Sweet smell the wild flowers growing outside my door; Smooth are the green waves lapping at my boat. A contented man never speaks of high honors; A settled nature is stronger than a city wall. Higher than a city wall for resisting enemy armies; More illustrious than holding high office and listening to imperial decrees. Those who are happy with mountains and rivers are few indeed; Thank Heaven, thank Earth, and thank the spirits. When the two of them had recited their verses and matched couplets they came to the place where their ways parted and bowed to each other to take their leave. “Brother Li,” said Zhang Shao, “look after yourself on your way home and keep a sharp look-out for tigers up in the hills. If you met with an accident then 'an old friend would be missing on the road tomorrow.' “ This made Li Ding angry. “You scoundrel,” he said, “I'm your friend; I'd die for you. How could you put such a curse on me? If I'm killed by a tiger, you'll be capsized by a wave.” “I'll never be capsized!” retorted Zhang Shao. “'In nature there are unexpected storms and in life unpredictable vicissitudes,'“ quoted Li Ding, “so how can you be sure you'll never have an accident?” “Brother Zhang,” replied the fisherman, “despite what you just said, it's your life that's insecure, whereas my life is certain: I'm sure that I shan't have an accident.” “Your life on the water is very dangerous and insecure,” said the woodcutter, “so how can you be so certain?” “There's something you don't know,” said Zhang Shao. “Every day I give a golden carp to a fortune-teller on the West Gate Street in Chang'an, and he passes a slip into my sleeve telling me I'll catch something every time provided I go to the right place. I went to buy a forecast from him today, and he told me that if I cast my nets to the East of the bend in the Jing River and lowered my lines on the Western bank, I would be bound to get a full load of fish and shrimps to take home. Tomorrow I shall go into town to sell them to buy wine, and we can continue our talk then, brother.” With this they parted."
小姐径进寺门，参了菩萨，大设斋衬，唤丫鬟将僧鞋暑袜，托于盘内。来到法堂，小姐复拈心香礼拜，就教法明长老分表与众僧去讫。玄奘见众僧散了，法堂上更无一人，他却近前跪下。小姐叫他脱了鞋袜看时，那左脚上果然少了一个小指头。当时两个又抱住而哭，拜谢长老养育之恩。法明道：“汝今母子相会，恐奸贼知之，可速速抽身回去，庶免其祸。”小姐道：“我儿，我与你一只香环，你径到洪州西北地方，约有一千五百里之程，那里有个万花店，当时留下婆婆张氏在那里，是你父亲生身之母。我再写一封书与你，径到唐王皇城之内，金殿左边，殷开山丞相家，是你母生身之父母。你将我的书递与外公，叫外公奏上唐王，统领人马，擒杀此贼，与父报仇，那时才救得老娘的身子出来。我今不敢久停，诚恐贼汉怪我归迟。”便出寺登舟而去。,"The young lady walked directly into the temple gate, joined the Bodhisattva, set up a large fasting lining, and called the maid to put the monk's shoes and socks on the plate. When she came to the Fatang, the lady returned to pray with the incense of the heart, and then taught the elder Faming to divide the table and the monks to go to the end. When Xuanzang saw that the monks had dispersed, and there was no one in the hall, he knelt down. When the lady told him to take off his shoes and socks, there was indeed a little finger missing from his left foot. At that time, the two hugged and cried again, thanking the elders for their kindness. Faming said: ""You are meeting your mother and son today. I'm afraid that the traitor will know about it. You can quickly withdraw and go back to save the disaster."" The young lady said: ""My son, I have a fragrance ring with you. You go to the northwest of Hongzhou and make an appointment. It is 1,500 miles away, and there is a Wanhua Store. At that time, the mother-in-law Zhang was left there. She is your father's biological mother. I will write another book with you, and go directly to the Golden Palace in the Tang Dynasty's imperial city. On the left, Prime Minister Yin Kaishan's family is your mother's biological parents. You handed my book to your grandfather and asked him to play it on the king of Tang, lead the troops, capture the thief, and avenge your father. Only then did you save the old lady's body. I don't dare to stop for a long time now, since I am afraid that the thieves will blame me for returning late."" Then he left the temple and boarded a boat.","The lady went straight inside to worship the Bodhisattva and to give a great vegetarian banquet. She ordered the housemaid to put the monk shoes and stockings in trays and have them brought into the main ceremonial hall. After the lady had again worshipped with extreme devoutness, she asked the abbot Faming to distribute the gifts to the various monks before they dispersed. When Xuanzang saw that all the monks had left and that there was no one else in the hall, he drew near and knelt down. The lady asked him to remove his shoes and stockings, and she saw that there was, indeed, a small toe missing from his left foot. Once again, the two of them embraced and wept. They also thanked the abbot for his kindness in fostering the youth. Faming said, “I fear that the present meeting of mother and child may become known to that wily bandit. You must leave speedily so that you may avoid any harm.” “My son,” the lady said, “let me give you an incense ring. Go to Hongzhou, about fifteen hundred miles northwest of here, where you will find the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn. Earlier we left an aged woman there whose maiden name is Zhang and who is the true mother of your father. I have also written a letter for you to take to the capital of the Tang emperor. To the left of the Golden Palace is the house of Chief Minister Yin, who is the true father of your mother. Give my letter to your maternal grandfather, and ask him to request the Tang emperor to dispatch men and horses to have this bandit arrested and executed, so that your father may be avenged. Only then will you be able to rescue your old mother. I dare not linger now, for I fear that knave may be offended by my returning late.” She went out of the temple, boarded the boat, and left.","On the monk protesting that he never ate meat, the women gave him vegetarian food, and he then gave thanks and ate. While there, Xuanzang offered prayers for the dead in his host’s family. Finding him gentle and ignorant of the road, the host accompanied him for a day’s journey. He could not go further, as they had arrived at the borders of the Tartar country, which he dared not cross. At the end of that journey a voice, with a sound like thunder, was heard at the foot of a mountain, crying, “ Oh my Master, you have come, you have come!” The Master. Buddha is in the heart, and the heart is in Buddha. The two are most important and should be inseparable. If you know that nothing is without a mind, That is the essence of the True Ideal. The essence of the True Ideal has no form It is a spark of light including everything. The bodiless is the real body, the formless is the real form. It has no color, but is not nothing. It does not come, nor go, nor return.","After receiving a warm welcome from the monks, she prayed and distributed the shoes. Once everyone else had left the hall of worship, Xuanzang kneeled next to her. Wenjiao asked him to take his shoes and socks off; she immediately saw that his left little toe was missing, and they once more tearfully hugged each other, then she thanked the abbot for looking after Xuanzang. “But I worry the murderer will hear about your reunion,” Faming warned Wenjiao. “You must leave immediately, for your own protection.” “Take this incense ring,” Wenjiao instructed Xuanzang, “and go to Hongzhou, some fifteen hundred miles northwest of here. There, you will find the Myriad Flowers Inn. Ask for an old lady by the surname of Zhang—your father’s mother and your grandmother. The ring will prove who you are. Then go on to the capital of the Tang empire—to the house of my father and your grandfather, Chief Minister Yin, to the left of the emperor’s palace. Give him this letter and ask him to have the emperor send soldiers to arrest and execute Liu Hong, to avenge your father. Then, at last, you can rescue me. I must go now, in case that villain gets suspicious.” After Wenjiao’s boat had departed back to Jiangzhou, Xuanzang immediately set out for Hongzhou and made inquiries about a Mrs. Zhang at the Myriad Flowers Inn.","When Miss Yin came into the temple she prayed to the Bodhisattva, offered a rich meal to the monks with a donation of money to each of them, and told her maid to put the shoes and the summer socks into the offertory tray. She then went into the Buddha-hall and worshipped with great devotion. When she told him to, Abbot Faming went away to distribute the gifts to the monks. Xuanzang saw that all the other monks had gone and that there was nobody else in the Buddha-hall, so he went up to his mother and knelt down. She told him to take off his shoes and socks and saw that one toe was indeed missing from his left foot. The pair of them hugged each other and cried again, then they bowed to the abbot to thank him for his kindness in bringing the boy up. “I'm worried that the villain may get to know of your reunion,” said the abbot, “so you had better go back as quickly as you can to avoid trouble.” “My son,” said Miss Yin, “I shall give you a sandalwood bracelet. You must go to a place called the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn to the Northwest of Hongzhou, which is about five hundred miles from here, where we left Madame Zhang, your paternal grandmother. I shall also write you a letter that you must take to the house of the minister Yin Kaishan which lies to the left of the palace inside the capital city of the Tang Emperor. He is my father. Give him this letter and ask him to submit a memorial to the Tang Emperor asking him to send horse and foot to capture or kill that bandit. Then your father will be avenged and your mother will be rescued. I must stay no longer as I am afraid that evil man may be suspicious if I am late back.” She left the temple and went back in her boat."
身上穿一领淡淡色，浅浅妆，盘金龙，飞彩凤的结素蓝袍；胸前挂一面对月明，舞清风，杂宝珠，攒翠玉的砌香环珮；腰间系一条冰蚕丝，织金边，登彩云，促瑶海的锦绣绒裙；面前又领一个飞东洋，游普世，感恩行孝，黄毛红嘴白鹦哥；手内托着一个施恩济世的宝瓶，瓶内插着一枝洒青霄，撒大恶，扫开残雾垂杨柳。玉环穿绣扣，金莲足下深。三天许出入，这才是救苦救难观世音。喜的个唐太宗，忘了江山；爱的那文武官，失却朝礼；,"He wears a light-colored, light-makeup, plain blue robe with golden dragons and flying phoenixes; on his chest is a garland of incense rings that faces the moonlight, dances in the breeze, miscellaneous jewels, and emeralds; around his waist Ice silk, weaving gold rims, climbing clouds, and promoting the splendid velvet skirt of Yaohai; in front of him, he leads another flying to the east, traveling around the world, showing gratitude and filial piety, yellow-haired, red-billed and white parrot; Inside is a branch that sprinkles Qingxiao, spreading great evil, sweeping away the residual fog and weeping willows. The jade ring wears an embroidered buckle, and the golden lotus is deep under the feet. Three days to allow entry and exit, this is to save suffering and save Guanyin. The happy Tang Taizong, forgot the country; the beloved civil and military officer, lost the court ceremony;","A robe of fine blue silk, Lightly colored And simply fretted By circling dragons And soaring phoenixes. Down in front was hung A pair of fragrant girdle-jade, Which glowed with the moon And danced with the wind, Overlaid with precious pearls And with imperial jade. Around her waist was tied An embroidered velvet skirt Of ice worm silk And piped in gold, In which she topped the colored clouds And crossed the jasper sea. Before her she led A cockatoo with red beak and yellow plumes, Which had roamed the Eastern Ocean And throughout the world To foster deeds of mercy and filial piety. She held in her hands A grace-dispensing and world-sustaining precious vase, In which was planted A twig of pliant willow, That could moisten the blue sky, And sweep aside all evil— All clinging fog and smoke. Her jade rings joined embroidered loops; Gold lotus grew beneath her feet. For three days oft she came and went: This very Guanshiyin30 who saves from pain and woe. So pleased by the vision was Tang Taizong that he forgot about his empire; so enthralled were the civil and military officials that they completely ignored court etiquette.","Then the false Sun went away, carrying the black felt bag, which contained the edicts and passports from the Emperor of China and the other rulers through whose regions they had passed. During this interval Zhu Bajie had found a house, where an old woman had given him some food. This he carried back to the Master, after which he took him and Sha the Monk to the old woman’s house, for a night’s lodging. Sha was sent in search of the felt bag and documents and was told if he could not find them, to go on the clouds to Guanyin to ask her help.","After kowtowing to Heaven, Tripitaka and Boqin made their way back down to the stone casket beneath the mountain to tell Monkey the good news. “Best keep your distance while I break out,” Monkey warned them. Boqin led the party some five or six miles away.","A plain blue robe with flying phoenixes, Pale-coloured, Patterned with running water, On which curled golden dragons. Before her breast hung A moon-bright, Wind-dancing, Pearl-encrusted, Jade-set circlet full of fragrance. Around her waist was A skirt of embroidery and brocade from the Jade Pool Made from the silk of ice-silkworms, With golden seams, That rode on coloured clouds. Before her went A white and yellow red-beaked parrot, To fly across the Eastern Ocean, And all over the world In gratitude and duty. The vase she held gave grace and salvation, And in the vase was a sprig of Weeping willow to sweep away the fog, Scattering water on the heavens, Cleansing all evil. Rings of jade looped over brocade buttons And her golden-lotus feet were concealed. She was able to visit the three heavens, For she was Guanyin, the rescuer from suffering. Taizong was so entranced that he forgot all about his empire; the ministers and generals were so captivated that they forgot all about court etiquette; and the masses all intoned, “Glory be to the Bodhisattva Guanyin.”"
又见他手里没有袈裟，又惧。问道：“怎么这番还不曾有袈裟来？”行者袖中取出个简帖儿来，递与三藏道：“师父，那怪物与这死的老剥皮，原是朋友。他着一个小妖送此帖来，还请他去赴佛衣会。是老孙就把那小妖打死，变做那老和尚，进他洞去，骗了一钟茶吃，欲问他讨袈裟看看，他不肯拿出。正坐间，忽被一个甚么巡山的，走了风信，他就与我打将起来。只斗到这早晚，不分上下。他见天晚，闪回洞去，紧闭石门。老孙无奈，也暂回来。”三藏道：“你手段比他何如？”行者道：“我也硬不多儿，只战个手平。”三藏才看了简帖，又递与那院主道：“你师父敢莫也是妖精么？”那院主慌忙跪下道：“老爷，我师父是人。只因那黑大王修成人道，常来寺里与我师父讲经，他传了我师父些养神服气之术，故以朋友相称。”行者道：“这伙和尚没甚妖气，他一个个头圆顶天，足方履地，但比老孙肥胖长大些儿，非妖精也。你看那帖儿上写着侍生熊罴，此物必定是个黑熊成精。”三藏道：“我闻得古人云，熊与猩猩相类，都是兽类，他却怎么成精？”行者笑道：“老孙是兽类，见做了齐天大圣，与他何异？大抵世间之物，凡有九窍者，皆可以修行成仙。”三藏又道：,"Seeing that he had no cassock in his hand, he was frightened. He asked, ""Why hasn't there been a cassock yet?"" Xingzhe took out a brief note from his sleeve, handed it to Sanzang and said, ""Master, that monster and this dead old man are friends. He has a little monster. I sent this post and invited him to go to the Buddhist Clothing Fair. It was the old grandson who beat the little demon to death, turned him into the old monk, went into his cave, cheated him for a minute of tea, and wanted to ask him for a cassock to see. , he refused to take it out. I was sitting in the room, when suddenly a patrolman walked away, and he fought with me. It was only until this morning and evening, no distinction was made. When he saw the night, he flashed back to the cave. Go, close the stone gate. Old Sun has no choice but to come back for the time being."" Sanzang said, ""How is your technique better than his?"" The walker said, ""I'm not too tough, I only fight a level."" Sanzang only read the brief post. Then he handed it to the master of the house and said, ""Does your master dare to be a goblin?"" The master of the house hurriedly knelt down and said, ""Master, my master is a human being. It's just because the black king is a Taoist, he often comes to the temple with me. Master taught the scriptures, and he passed on some of my master’s techniques of recuperating and convincing himself, so he is regarded as a friend.” The practitioner said: “This group of monks is not very demonic. When you grow up, you are not a fairy. Look at the post that says the waiter Xiong Shi, this thing must be a black bear turned into a spirit."" Sanzang said: ""I heard the ancients say that bears are similar to orangutans, and they are both beasts. , how did he become an essence?"" The walker smiled and said, ""The old grandson is a beast. Seeing that he has become the Great Sage Equalling Heaven, how is it different from him? Most of the things in the world, anyone with nine orifices can cultivate and become immortals."" Sanzang said again:","Tripitaka, who was waiting for him with bulging eyes, was delighted to see him; but when he did not see the cassock, he became frightened again. “How is it that you still have not brought back the cassock?” he asked. Pilgrim took out from his sleeve the invitation slip and handed it over to Tripitaka, saying, “Master, the monster and that old carcass used to be friends. He sent a little demon here with this invitation for him to go to a Festival of the Buddha Robe. I killed the little demon and changed into the form of the old monk to get inside the cave. I managed to trick him into giving me a cup of tea, but when I asked for the cassock, he refused to show it to me. As we were sitting there, my identity was leaked by someone on patrol in the mountain, and we began to fight. The battle lasted until this early evening and ended in a draw. When the monster saw that it was late, he slipped back into the cave and tightly bolted up his stone door. Old Monkey had no choice but to return here for the moment.” “How’s your skill as a fighter when compared with his?” asked Tripitaka. “Not much better,” said Pilgrim. “We are quite evenly matched.” Tripitaka then read the invitation slip and handed it to the abbot, saying, “Could it be that your master was also a monster-spirit?” Falling to his knees, the abbot said, “Old Father, my master is human. Because that Great Black King attained the way of humanity through self-cultivation, he frequently came to the monastery to discuss religious texts with my master. He imparted to my master a little of the magic of nourishing one’s spirit and ingesting breath; hence they address each other as friends.” “This bunch of monks here,” said Pilgrim, “don’t have the aura of monsters: each one has a round head pointing to the sky and a pair of feet set flat on the earth. They are a little taller and heavier than old Monkey, but they are no monsters. Look at what’s written on the slip: ‘your student-servant, the Bear.’ This creature must be a black bear who has become a spirit.” Tripitaka said, “I have heard from the ancients that the bear and the ape are of the same kind. They are all beasts, in other words. How can this bear become a spirit?” “Old Monkey is also a beast,” said Pilgrim, laughing, “but I became the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven. Is he any different? All the creatures of this world who possess the nine apertures can become immortals through the art of self-cultivation.” “You just said that the two of you were evenly matched,” said Tripitaka again.",,"Please help me get back to my temple!” “We are both men of religion,” answered Tripitaka. “Of course I must help you. Sandy, you carry this gentleman.” “Oh, not that face full of misery!” protested the fiend. “My poor nerves couldn’t take it.” “All right, you carry him, Monkey,” decided Tripitaka. “Ha!” muttered Monkey, as he took the Taoist onto his back. “You have underestimated me, shameless fiend. Tripitaka might not see through you, but I read you like a book. My master’s not on your menu.” “I’ve no idea what you’re talking about,” the monster replied primly. “Manners, Monkey!” chided Tripitaka, overhearing some of their exchange. After five or so miles, Tripitaka and Sandy disappeared out of view in a fold of the mountain and Monkey was all ready to dash the monster to the ground. But the fiend was a step ahead of him: deploying the Moving Mountains magic, he brought Mount Meru—the five-peaked center of the Buddhist universe—directly down on Monkey’s left shoulder. “Piffling mountain,” Monkey observed with a giggle. With another spell, the fiend summoned Mount Emei, another sacred peak, from west China. Monkey caught the second mountain on his right shoulder and began to sprint after Tripitaka. Now sweating with panic, the fiend recited one more spell to summon Mount Tai—a third sacred peak, this time from the east—which caught Monkey full on the head and finally pinned him to the ground. With Monkey taken care of, the fiend hitched a ride on a gale to catch up with Tripitaka. Hovering overhead, Silver Horn tucked Sandy under one monstrous armpit, Tripitaka under the other, and with another magic gust of wind the three were back in Lotus-Flower Cave. “I’ve got them, brother!” exulted Silver Horn. “Wrong again,” said Golden Horn, sighing. “Capturing the monk’s all very well, but we can’t eat him until we’ve secured the monkey. If we eat his master while he’s still at large, he’ll make our lives hell.” “That monkey isn’t going anywhere,” boasted Silver Horn.","Sanzang was very glad, until seeing that there was no cassock in Monkey's hands his happiness turned to fear. “Why haven't you got the cassock this time either?” he asked. Brother Monkey produced the invitation from his sleeve, and as he handed it to Sanzang he said, “Master, that fiend was friends with that dead crook. He sent a junior goblin with this invitation asking him to go to a 'Buddha's Robe Banquet'. I killed the goblin, made myself look like the old monk, went into the cave, and tricked a cup of tea out of them. I asked him to let me see the cassock, but he wouldn't bring it out. Then as we were sitting there a mountain patrolman of some sort gave the game away, so he started to fight me. We fought till just now, and neither of us was on top, when he saw that it was late, shot back to his cave and shut the stone doors behind him. This meant that I had to come back for the moment.” “How do your tricks compare with his?” Sanzang asked. “I'm not much better than him,” Monkey replied, “and I can only keep my end up.” Sanzang read the invitation and handed it to the prelate. “Can it be that your Patriarch was an evil spirit?” he said. The prelate fell to knees as fast as he could and said, “My lord, he was human. But because that Great Black King was cultivating the ways of humanity he often came to our temple to discuss the scriptures with our Patriarch, and taught him some of the arts of nourishing the divine and controlling the vital essence. That was why they were on friendly terms.” “None of these monks have anything satanic about them,” Monkey said. “They all have their heads in the air and their feet on the ground, and are taller and fatter than I am. They're not evil spirits. Do you see where it says 'Your pupil Bear' on the invitation? He must be a black bear who has become a spirit.” To this Sanzang said, “There's an old saying that 'Bears and baboons are alike'. If they are all animals, how can they become spirits?” Monkey laughed and replied, “I'm an animal too, but I became the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. I'm just the same as him. All the creatures on heaven and earth that have nine openings to their bodies can cultivate their conduct and become Immortals.” “Just now you said his abilities were the same as yours, so how are you going to beat him and get the cassock back?” Sanzang went on to ask."
恭喜！今有先生夫人，公子同岳丈俱在江边祭你，我今送你还魂去也。再有如意珠一颗，走盘珠二颗，绞绡十端，明珠玉带一条奉送。你今日便可夫妻子母相会也。”光蕊再三拜谢。龙王就令夜叉将光蕊身尸送出江口还魂，夜叉领命而去。,"Congratulations! Today, there is Mr. and Mrs., the son and the husband-in-law are all offering sacrifices to you by the river, and I will send you back to your soul today. There is also a wishful pearl, two walking beads, ten ends of twisted silk, and a pearl jade belt as a gift. You can meet your husband and wife today. ""Guangrui thanked him again and again. The Dragon King ordered Yasha to send Guangrui's body out of Eguchi to revive him, and Yasha led the way.","Congratulations! At this moment, your wife, your son, and your father-in-law are offering sacrifices to you at the bank of the river. I am now letting your soul go so that you may return to life. We are also presenting you with a pearl of wish fulfillment,8 two rolling-pan pearls,9 ten bales of mermaid silk,10 and a jade belt with lustrous pearls. Today you will enjoy the reunion of husband and wife, mother and son.” After Guangrui had given thanks repeatedly, the Dragon King ordered a yakṣa to escort his body to the mouth of the river and there to return his soul. The yakṣa followed the order and left.","At once he mounted the clouds, reached Heaven and asked for a shade to put over the place where his Master slept and over his cassock and that the wind should blow till everything else was burnt. In spite of this, however, the cassock disappeared! Next morning, the monks denied all knowledge of the cassock. The Monkey asked, “Is there a demon near here?” “Yes, in the Black Wind Mountain, only 20 li off.” “I am sure to find the cassock,” he told the monks, whom he had called together.","the monarch told Guangrui. “Your wife, son, and father-in-law are all making sacrifices to you on the riverbank. Now is the moment to return your soul to your family. I will send you back with a wish-granting pearl, ten bales of mermaid silk, and a pearl-encrusted jade belt.” Guangrui, of course, could not thank the dragon king enough. After a fond farewell, the king ordered an aquatic patrol to take Guangrui’s body up to the surface of the river and unite it with his soul.","“Congratulations, sir, congratulations,” said the dragon king. “Your lady, your son and your father-in-law are all sacrificing to you on the bank. I shall now return your soul to you and give you an As-You -Will pearl, two rolling pearls, ten pieces of mermaid silk, and a belt of jade studded with pearls. Today you will be reunited with you wife, your son and your mother.” Chen Guangrui bowed to him over and over again to express his gratitude. The dragon king then told a yaksha to take Chen Guangrui's body out to the estuary, where he was to return the soul to it; and the yaksha obediently went off."
赤胆忠良名誉大，欺天诳上声名坏。一低一好幸相持，豪杰英雄同赌赛。铁棒凶，金鞭快，正直无私怎忍耐？这个是太乙雷声应化尊，那个是齐天大圣猿猴怪。金鞭铁棒两家能，都是神宫仙器械。今日在灵霄宝殿弄威风，各展雄才真可爱。一个欺心要夺斗牛宫，一个竭力匡扶玄圣界。苦争不让显神通，鞭棒往来无胜败。他两个斗在一处，胜败未分，早有佑圣真君，又差将佐发文到雷府，调三十六员雷将齐来，把大圣围在垓心，各骋凶恶鏖战。那大圣全无一毫惧色，使一条如意棒，左遮右挡，后架前迎。一时，见那众雷将的刀枪剑戟、鞭简挝锤、钺斧金瓜、旄镰月铲，来的甚紧，他即摇身一变，变做三头六臂；把如意棒幌一幌，变作三条；六只手使开三条棒，好便似纺车儿一般，滴流流，在那垓心里飞舞。众雷神莫能相近。真个是：,"The brave and loyal have a great reputation, but they have a bad reputation for deceiving the sky. One low and one fortunately stalemate, heroes and heroes gamble with each other. The iron rod is fierce, the golden whip is fast, how can you endure the integrity and selflessness? This is Taiyi Leisheng Yinghuazun, and that is the Monkey King Monkey Monkey. The golden whip and iron rod are both capable of gods and gods. Today, in the Lingxiao Palace, it is very cute. One deceived his heart to take the Bullfighting Palace, and the other tried his best to help the Xuansheng Realm. Hard fights do not let the supernatural powers manifest, and there is no victory or defeat in the exchanges of whips and sticks. The two of them were fighting in the same place, and the victory or defeat was not divided. There was already a real monarch of the sage, and he sent the general Zuo to the Lei House, and dispatched 36 Lei generals to come together to surround the great sage in the heart of Gai, and each of them fought fiercely and fiercely. . The great sage had no fear at all, so he used a wish-fulfilling stick to cover the left and the right, and the back frame to greet him. At one time, when he saw the swords, spears, swords, halberds, whips, hammers, gourds, gourds, and sickles and shovels of the thunder generals, they were very tight, and he changed his body into three heads and six arms; Six hands made three sticks, like a spinning wheel, dripping and flowing, dancing in Gai's heart. The gods of thunder can't come close. The real one is:","A red-blooded patriot of ample fame, And a Heaven’s rebel with notorious name! The saint and sinner gladly tangle close So that two brave fighters can test their skills. Though the rod is fierce And the whip is fleet, How can the upright and just one forbear? This one is a supreme god of judgment with thunderous voice; The other, the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, a monstrous ape. The golden whip and the iron rod used by the two Are both divine weapons from the House of God. At Divine Mists Treasure Hall they show their might today, Each displaying his prowess winningly. This one brashly seeks to take the Big Dipper Palace; The other with all his strength defends the sacred realm. In bitter strife relentless they show their power; Moving back and forth, whip or rod has yet to score. The two of them fought for some time, and neither victory nor defeat could yet be determined. The Immortal Master of Adjuvant Holiness, however, had already sent word to the Thunder Department, and thirty-six thunder deities were summoned to the scene. They surrounded the Great Sage and plunged into a fierce battle. The Great Sage was not in the least intimidated; wielding his compliant rod, he parried left and right and met his attackers to the front and to the rear. In a moment he saw that the scimitars, lances, swords, halberds, whips, maces, hammers, axes, gilt bludgeons, sickles, and spades of the thunder deities were coming thick and fast. So with one shake of his body he changed into a creature with six arms and three heads. One wave of the compliant rod and it turned into three; his six arms wielded the three rods like a spinning wheel, whirling and dancing in their midst. The various thunder deities could not approach him at all. Truly his form was","A spirit official quickly met his attack, and the two fought fiercely in front of the Lingshao Hall. Before it was clear which was victorious, the spirit on the right sent his assistant general to the Thunder Palace and requested thirty-six thunder generals to come and help. They came together and surrounded the Great Sage on the terrace. They all looked most warlike, but although they came very near him with their knives and spears and swords and lances, the Great Sage had no fear and merely shook his body. By magic he changed himself into a being with three heads and six arms, and the steel club by a twist became three, and the six arms, wielding three clubs, twirled about like a spinning wheel on the terrace. Perfect life, shining bright Down all ages without fail,","“Put down your weapons,” the Buddha ordered the thunder gods, “and tell the Great Sage to come and talk to me.”","Great was the fame of the brave and loyal officer, Evil the name of the rebel who bullied Heaven. The low one and the good one were well matched; Valiant heroes fighting each other. Vicious the iron cudgel, Quick the golden mace. Both were straight, merciless, and terrible. One of them is a deity formed from the Great Monad's thunder; The other is the monkey spirit, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. With golden mace or iron cudgel each is a master; Both are weapons from the palaces of the gods. Today they show their might in the Hall of Miraculous Mist, A wonderful display of courage and skill. One in his folly wanting to capture the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull, The other exerting all his strength to support the world of the gods. The fight is too hard to allow the use of magic, As mace and cudgel struggle without result. As they fought together without either of them emerging as victor, the True Lord sent an officer with a message to the Thunder Palace ordering the thirty-six thunder generals to surround the Great Sage. Although they all fought with the utmost ferocity, the Great Sage was not in the least frightened, and parried and blocked to left and right with his As-You-Will cudgel, resisting his opponents in front and behind. Before long he found that the pressure was too great from the sabres, spears, swords, halberds, clubs, maces, claws-and-ropes, hammer, pole-axes, battle-axes, grabs, pennoned hooks, and moon-shaped bills of the thunder generals; so he shook himself and grew three heads and six arms. Then he shook his As-You-Will cudgel and changed it into three cudgels, and wielding the three cudgels in his six hands he flew round and round inside the encirclement like a spinning wheel. None of the thunder generals could get anywhere near him. Indeed, Perfectly round,"
