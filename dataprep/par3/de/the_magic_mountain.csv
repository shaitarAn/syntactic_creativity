"Die jungen Leute suchten sie zu trösten, machten Worte über die Möglichkeit einer glücklichen Wendung. Aber die Majorin schluchzte nur auf und dankte ihnen jedenfalls nochmals für alles, für die Hortensie und dafür, daß sie das Kind durch ihren Besuch noch ein wenig zerstreut und beglückt. Da läge die Ärmste in ihrer Qual und Einsamkeit, während andere junge {459}Dinger sich ihres Lebens freuten und mit hübschen jungen Herren tanzten, wozu die Krankheit doch keineswegs die Lust ertöte. Sie hätten ihr ein wenig Sonnenschein gebracht, mein Gott, wohl den letzten. Die Hortensie sei wie ein Ballerfolg und das Geplauder mit den beiden stattlichen Kavalieren wie ein netter kleiner Flirt für sie gewesen, das habe sie, Mutter Gerngroß, wohl gesehen.","The young people tried to comfort her, spoke up about the possibility of a happy turn of events. But the majoress only sobbed and thanked them again for everything, for the hydrangea and for distracting and making the child a little happy with her visit. There the poor thing would lie in her torment and loneliness, while other young things would enjoy their lives and dance with handsome young gentlemen, for which the illness by no means kills the desire. They would have brought her some sunshine, my God, probably the last. The hydrangea was like a success at the ball and the chat with the two stately cavaliers like a nice little flirt for her, she, Mother Gerngross, saw that very well.","The young people sought to console her, to say something about the possibility of a turn for the better. But the Major’s wife only sobbed and thanked them for all they had done, for the gift of the plant, and the diversion and pleasure their visit had brought her child. She lay there, poor little one, lonely and suffering upon her bed, while other young creatures were glad of life, and could dance with fine young men to their heart’s desire—and even the disease could not kill the desire to dance. They had brought her a ray of sunshine—my God, it would be the last. The hortensia had been like homage at a ball, the brief chat with the two fine young cavaliers a tiny affaire de cœur; she, the mother, had seen it.","The young men tried to comfort her, said something about the possibility of a happy turn for the better.

"»Ja, du hast es gewußt.«","""Yes, you knew it.""","Tu l’as su,” he said.","“Yes, you did, Clavdia.”"
"Aber auch Hans Castorps Haltung hatte sich nun gestrafft. Er hielt die Absätze geschlossen und sah Herrn Settembrini ebenfalls gerade an. Diesmal war es ein Gefecht. Hans Castorp stand seinen Mann. Einflüsse aus der Nähe »stärkten« ihn. Da war ein Pädagog, und dort draußen war eine schmaläugige Frau. Er entschuldigte sich nicht einmal für das, was er sagte; er fügte nicht hinzu: »Nehmen Sie es mir nicht übel.« Er antwortete:","But Hans Castorp's attitude had now also tightened. He kept his heels closed and also looked straight at Mr. Settembrini. This time it was a skirmish. Hans Castorp stood his ground. Influences from near ""strengthened"" him. There was a teacher, and out there was a narrow-eyed woman. He didn't even apologize for what he said; he did not add, ""Don't take offense."" He replied:","But Hans Castorp’s bearing too had stiffened. He stood with his heels together, and looked straight at Herr Settembrini in his turn. This time it was a duel. Hans Castorp stood his ground. Influences from not far off gave him strength. Here was a schoolmaster—but yonder was a woman with narrow eyes. He made no apologies for his words, he did not beg Herr Settembrini not to take offence; he answered: “Then you are more prudent for yourself than for others.","But Hans Castorp’s posture had stiffened as well now. He had put his heels together and was looking just as directly at Herr Settembrini. The battle had been engaged. Hans Castorp stood his ground. He was “strengthened” by forces close-by. Here was a pedagogue—but just outside was a narrow-eyed woman. He did not apologize for what he now said, did not even bother to preface it with, “No offense.” He replied, “Then you are more cautious about yourself than you are about other people."
"Dieser Junge mit dem Fingernagel, erzählte Joachim leise, sei nur ganz wenig leidend gewesen, als er gekommen sei, – ohne Temperatur, und nur der Vorsicht halber sei er von seinem Vater, einem Arzt, heraufgeschickt worden und habe nach des Hofrats Urteile etwa drei Monate bleiben sollen. Jetzt, nach drei Monaten, habe er 37,8 bis 38 und sei recht krank. Aber er lebe ja auch so unvernünftig, daß er Maulschellen verdiene.","This boy with the fingernail, Joachim said quietly, was only slightly ill when he came - without a temperature, and just to be on the safe side, he had been sent up by his father, a doctor, and according to the privy councilor he had about three sentences should stay for months. Now, after three months, he has 37.8 to 38 and is quite ill. But he also lives so unreasonably that he deserves a slap in the face.","The person with the finger-nail, Joachim related in a low voice, had been only a light case when he came. He had had no fever and had been sent up merely as a precautionary measure, by his father, who was a physician. The Hofrat had advised a stay of three months. The three months had passed, and now he had 100 to 100.5 degrees of fever and was seriously ill. But he lived so wide of all common sense that he needed his ears boxed.","The boy with the fingernail, Joachim explained in a low voice, had been only very slightly ill on arrival, with no temperature—his being sent up was more a precautionary measure by his father, a physician—and had been advised by the director that he would have to stay about three months. And now, after three months, with a temperature between 100 and 100.4 degrees, he was seriously ill. But he led such a reckless life that he deserved to have his ears boxed."
"Der Vorgang hatte sich abgespielt, wie Hans Castorp ihn während seines Aufenthaltes hier oben schon manchmal sich hatte abspielen sehen: der Schlitten oder Wagen hielt an der Rampe, Kutscher und Hausknecht schnürten die Koffer auf, Sanatoriumsgäste, Freunde dessen, der, genesen oder nicht, um zu leben oder zu sterben, die Rückreise ins Flachland antrat, oder auch nur solche, die den Dienst schwänzten, um das Ereignis auf sich wirken zu lassen, versammelten sich vorm Portal; ein Herr im Gehrock von der Verwaltung, vielleicht sogar die Ärzte stellten sich ein, und dann kam der Abreisende heraus, – strahlenden Angesichtes meist und huldvoll die neugierig Umstehenden und Zurückbleibenden grüßend, mächtig belebt für den Augenblick durch das Abenteuer … Diesmal nun war es Frau Chauchat gewesen, die herausgekommen war, lächelnd, den Arm voller Blumen, in langem, rauhem, mit Pelz besetztem Reisemantel und großem Hut, begleitet von Herrn Buligin, ihrem konkaven Landsmann, der ein Stück Weges mit ihr reiste. Auch sie schien freudig erregt, wie jeder Abreisende es war, – nur durch den Lebenswechsel, ganz unabhängig davon, {527}ob man mit ärztlicher Einwilligung reiste oder nur aus verzweifeltem Überdruß, auf eigene Gefahr und mit schlechtem Gewissen den Aufenthalt unterbrach. Ihre Wangen waren gerötet, sie plauderte beständig, wahrscheinlich auf russisch, während man ihre Knie mit einer Pelzdecke umwickelte … Nicht nur Frau Chauchats Landsleute und Tischgenossen, sondern auch zahlreiche andere Gäste waren zur Stelle gewesen, Dr. Krokowski hatte kernig lächelnd seine gelben Zähne im Barte gezeigt, noch mehr Blumen hatte es gegeben, die Großtante hatte Konfekt, »Konfäktchen«, wie sie zu sagen pflegte, das heißt russische Marmelade, gespendet, die Lehrerin hatte dort gestanden, der Mannheimer, – dieser in einiger Entfernung, trübe spähend, und seine leidvollen Augen waren am Hause emporgeglitten, wo sie Hans Castorp am Korridorfenster gewahrt und trübe auf ihm verweilt hatten … Hofrat Behrens hatte sich nicht gezeigt; offenbar hatte er sich von der Reisenden schon bei anderer, privater Gelegenheit verabschiedet … Dann hatten unter dem Winken und Rufen der Umstehenden die Pferde angezogen, und auch Frau Chauchats schräge Augen hatten nun, während die Vorwärtsbewegung des Schlittens ein Zurücksinken ihres Oberkörpers gegen das Polster bewirkt hatte, noch einmal lächelnd die Front des Berghof-Hauses überflogen und während des Bruchteils einer Sekunde auf Hans Castorps Antlitz verweilt … Bleich war der Zurückbleibende auf sein Zimmer geeilt, in seine Loggia, um den Schlitten von hier aus noch einmal zu sehen, der mit Geklingel die Anfahrtstraße hinab gegen »Dorf« hingeglitten war, hatte sich dann in seinen Stuhl geworfen und aus der Brusttasche die Erinnerungsgabe gezogen, das Pfand, das diesmal nicht in bräunlichroten Holzschnitzeln, sondern in einem dünn gerahmten Plättchen, einer Glasplatte bestand, die man gegen das Licht halten mußte, um etwas an ihr zu finden, – Clawdias Innenporträt, das ohne Antlitz war, aber das zarte {528}Gebein ihres Oberkörpers, von den weichen Formen des Fleisches licht und geisterhaft umgeben, nebst den Organen der Brusthöhle erkennen ließ …","The process had happened as Hans Castorp had often seen it happen during his stay up here: the sledge or carriage stopped at the ramp, the coachman and the porter unlaced the suitcases, sanatorium guests, friends of those who, recovered or not, to live or die, those returning to the lowlands, or even those who skipped work to let the event sink in, gathered in front of the portal; a gentleman in a frock coat from the administration, maybe even the doctors, and then the departing person came out – mostly with a beaming face and graciously greeting the curious bystanders and those who stayed behind, mightily animated for the moment by the adventure … This time it was a woman Chauchat, who had come out, smiling, with her arm full of flowers, in a long, rough, fur-trimmed traveling cloak and large hat, accompanied by Mr. Buligin, her concave countryman, who was traveling part way with her. She, too, seemed happily excited, as every departing person was - only because of the change of life, quite independent of whether {527} one traveled with the doctor's consent or only out of desperate weariness, at one's own risk and with a guilty conscience interrupted one's stay. Her cheeks were flushed, she was chattering away, probably in Russian, while her knees were wrapped in a fur blanket. Krokowski had shown his yellow teeth in his beard with a pithy smile, there had been more flowers, the great-aunt had donated sweets, ""little sweets,"" as she used to say, that is, Russian jam, the teacher had been standing there, the Mannheimer— he was some distance away, peering bleakly, and his sorrowful eyes had glided up the house where they had seen Hans Castorp at the corridor window and lingered bleakly on him... Hofrat Behrens had not shown himself; Apparently he had already said goodbye to the traveler on another, private occasion... Then, to the waving and shouting of those around, the horses had pulled up, and Mrs. Chauchat's slanted eyes were now on, while the forward movement of the sleigh caused her upper body to sink back against the cushion flew over the front of the Berghof-Haus with a smile and lingered on Hans Castorp’s face for a fraction of a second … Pale, the one who stayed behind had rushed to his room, to his loggia, to see the sled again from here, the one with Gklingel had slid down the access road towards ""Dorf"", then threw himself in his chair and pulled the souvenir out of his breast pocket, the deposit, which this time did not consist of brownish-red wood chips, but of a thinly framed plate, a glass plate, which one gave had to hold the light to find something on her, - Clawdia's interior portrait, without Ant litz was, but the delicate {528} bones of her upper body, surrounded by the soft forms of the flesh light and ghostly, together with the organs of the chest cavity could be recognized ...","It took place just as other such which Hans Castorp had witnessed during his stay up here. The sleigh or carriage halted before the door, coachman and porter strapped fast the trunks, while friends gathered about to say good-bye to the departing one, who, cured or not, and whether for life or death, was off for the flat-land. Others besides friends gathered round as well, curious on-lookers, who cut the rest-cure for the sake of the diversion thus afforded. There would be a frock-coated official representing the management, perhaps even the physicians themselves; then out came the gracious recipient of the attentions paid by this little world to a departing guest; generally with a beaming face, and a bearing which the excitement of the moment rendered far more animated than usual. To-day it was Frau Chauchat who issued from the portal, in company with her concave fellow-countryman, Herr Buligin, who was to accompany her for part of the way. She wore a long, shaggy, fur-trimmed travellingcloak, and a large hat; she was all smiles, her arms were full of flowers, she too seemed possessed by the pleasurable excitement due to the prospect of change, if to nothing else, which was common to all those who left, whatever the circumstances of their leaving, and whether with the consent of the physicans, or in sheer desperation and at their own risk. Her cheeks were flushed, and she chattered without stopping, probably in Russian, while the rug was being arranged over her knees. People presented farewell bouquets, the great-aunt gave a box of Russian sweetmeats. Numerous other guests besides Frau Chauchat’s Russian companions and table-mates, stood there to see her off; among them Dr. Krokowski, showing his yellow teeth through his beard in a hearty smile, the schoolmistress, and the man from Mannheim, who gazed gloomily and furtively from a distance, and whose eyes found out Hans Castorp as he stood at his corridor window looking down upon the scene. Hofrat Behrens did not show himself—he had probably ere now taken private leave of the traveller. The horses started up, amid farewells and hand-wavings from the bystanders; and then, as Frau Chauchat sank smilingly back against the cushions of the sleigh, her eyes swept the façade of the Berghof, and rested for the fraction of a second upon Hans Castorp’s face. In pallid haste he sought his loggia, thence to get a last glimpse of the sleigh as it went jingling down the drive toward the Dorf. Then he flung himself into his chair, and drew out his keepsake, his treasure, that consisted, this time, not of a few reddish-brown shavings, but a thin glass plate, which must be held toward the light to see anything on it. It was Clavdia’s x-ray portrait, showing not her face, but the delicate bony structure of the upper half of her body, and the organs of the thoracic cavity, surrounded by the pale, ghostlike envelope of flesh.","Her departure had taken place in much the same fashion as others Hans Castorp had seen during his stay: the sleigh or carriage stopped at the ramp, driver and porter strapped down trunks, and around the main entrance were gathered sanatorium guests—both friends of the person who, whether cured or not, whether to live or to die, was returning now to the flatlands, and mere onlookers playing hooky from their rest cure to take in the ambiance. A gentleman in a frock coat from the management, perhaps even the doctors, would appear, and then the departing guest came out—usually with a beaming smile, graciously greeting both bystanders and friends left behind, and generally quite animated by the excitement of the moment. And this time it had been Frau Chauchat who emerged, smiling, arms full of flowers, wearing a large hat and a long, coarse traveling coat trimmed with fur; she was accompanied by Herr Buligin, her concave countryman, who was to travel partway with her. Like every other departing guest, she, too, seemed happy and excited, if only because life would surely change—whether a person departed with medical approval or out of weary desperation broke off his stay at his own risk and with a bad conscience. Her cheeks were flushed, she kept up a constant flow of chatter—in Russian, presumably—while someone tucked a fur blanket around her legs. Not just Frau Chauchat’s countrymen and tablemates were present, but countless other guests were on hand as well. Dr. Krokowski showed up, smiling pithily and showing his yellow teeth under his beard. More flowers were presented. The great-aunt gave her some candies, “konfekti” as she called them in Russian; the teacher, Fräulein Engelhart, appeared, as did the man from Mannheim—although he stood off at some distance, watching gloomily; but then his mournful eyes glided up to the window, where he had spotted Hans Castorp, and lingered gloomily there for a while. Director Behrens had not come, having presumably said his good-byes to her on some other private occasion. The onlookers waved and called out, the horses pulled; as the sleigh moved forward, Frau Chauchat’s upper body sank back against the cushions and her smiling, slanted eyes quickly surveyed the façade of the Berghof and rested for the fraction of a second on Hans Castorp’s face. He was pale as he hurried back to his room and out onto the balcony, from where he could catch another glimpse of the sleigh as it made its jingling way down the approach road toward Dorf; then he threw himself in his chair, and from his breast pocket he pulled his memento—not reddish-brown pencil shavings this time, but a little plate of glass in a narrow frame, which had to be held up to the light for him to see what was there: the portrait of Clavdia’s interior, without a face, but revealing the organs of her chest cavity and the tender framework of her upper body, delicately surrounded by the soft, ghostlike forms of her flesh."
"Hans Castorp folgte den Vorgängen seitwärts geneigten Kopfes, nachdenklich versunken in die Betrachtung von Joachims Oberkörper, dessen Rippen (gottlob war er im Besitz seiner Rippen) sich beim Schnaufen unter der gespannten Haut hoch über den zurückfallenden Magen hoben, – diesem schlanken, gelblich-brünetten Jünglingsoberkörper mit den schwarzen Haaren am Brustknochen und an den übrigens kräftigen Armen, deren einer ein goldenes Kettenarmband um das Handgelenk trug. Turnerarme sind das, dachte Hans Castorp; er hat immer gern geturnt, während ich mir nichts daraus machte, und das hing mit seiner Lust zum Soldatenstande zusammen. Immer war er gut körperlich gesinnt, viel mehr als ich, oder doch auf andere Weise; denn ich war immer ein Zivilist, und es war mir mehr um warm baden und gut essen und trinken zu tun, ihm aber um männliche Anforderungen und Leistungen. Und nun ist auf so ganz andere Weise sein Körper in den Vordergrund getreten und hat sich selbständig und wichtig gemacht, nämlich durch Krankheit. Illuminiert ist er und will sich nicht entgiften und solide werden, so gern der arme Joachim auch Soldat sein möchte im Flachland. Sieh an, {273}er ist gewachsen, wie es im Buche steht, der reine Apollo von Belvedere, bis auf die Haare. Aber innerlich ist er krank und außen zu warm vor Krankheit; denn Krankheit macht den Menschen viel körperlicher, sie macht ihn gänzlich zum Körper … Und wie er dies dachte, erschrak er und blickte rasch und forschend von Joachims bloßem Oberleib zu seinen Augen hinauf, seinen großen, schwarzen und sanften Augen, die vom künstlichen Atmen und Husten in Tränen standen und bei der Untersuchung mit traurigem Ausdruck über den Zuschauer hin ins Leere sahen.","Hans Castorp followed the proceedings with his head tilted sideways, pensively contemplating Joachim's upper body, whose ribs (thank God he had his ribs) rose high above the sagging stomach when he puffed, this slender, yellowish-brunette A youth's torso with black hair on the breast bone and on the otherwise strong arms, one of which wore a gold chain bracelet around the wrist. Those are gymnast arms, thought Hans Castorp; he always liked to do gymnastics, while I didn't care, and that had to do with his desire to become a soldier. He was always physically good, much more so than I, or at least in a different way; for I was always a civilian, and I was more concerned with taking warm baths and eating and drinking well, but with manly demands and achievements for him. And now his body has come to the fore in a completely different way and has made itself independent and important, namely through illness. He's illuminated and doesn't want to decontaminate himself and become solid, no matter how much poor Joachim would like to be a soldier in the lowlands. Behold, {273}he has grown as it is written, the pure Apollo of Belvedere, down to his hair. But inside he is sick and outside too warm with sickness; because illness makes a person much more physical, it makes him completely a body ... And when he thought this, he was startled and looked up quickly and searchingly from Joachim's bare upper body to his eyes, his large, black and gentle eyes, which are from artificial breathing and Coughing in tears and staring into space at the viewer with a sad expression during the examination.","Hans Castorp followed the proceedings with his head on one side, absorbed in contemplation of his cousin’s torso. The ribs —thank Heaven, he had them all!—rose under the taut skin as he took deep inhalations, and the stomach fell away. Hans Castorp studied that youthful figure, slender, yellowish-bronze, with a black fell along the breastbone and the powerful arms. On one wrist Joachim wore a gold chainbracelet. “Those are the arms of an athlete,” thought Hans Castorp. “I never made much of gymnastics, but he always liked them, and that is partly the reason why he wanted to be a soldier. He has always been more inclined than I to the things of the body—or inclined in a different way. I’ve always been a civilian and cared more about warm baths and good eating and drinking, whereas he has gone in for manly exertion. And now his body has come into the foreground in another sense and made itself important and independent of the rest of him—namely, through illness. He is all ‘lit up’ within and can’t get rid of the infection and become healthy, poor Joachim, no matter how much he wants to get down to the valley and be a soldier. And yet look how he is developed, like a picture in a book, a regular Apollo Belvedere, except for the hair. But the disease makes him ailing within and fevered without; disease makes men more physical, it leaves them nothing but body”—his own thought startled him, and he looked quickly at Joachim with a questioning glance, that travelled from the bared body up to the large, gentle black eyes. Tears stood out in them, from the effort of the forced breathing and coughing and they gazed into space with a pathetic expression as the examination went on.","Tilting his head forward and to one side, Hans Castorp followed the whole procedure, but was soon lost in thought as he regarded Joachim’s upper body, the way the ribs— thank God he still had all his ribs— rose under the taut skin while the stomach fell with each breath he took. It was a slender, yellowish-brown, youthful torso, with black hair at the breastbone and along the still powerful arms, one of which was encircled at the wrist by a gold bracelet. “A gymnast’s arms,” Hans Castorp thought. “He always did enjoy gymnastics, whereas I didn’t care much for them, and that was all part of his wanting to become a soldier. He always was concerned about his body, much more than I, or at least in a different way than I, because I was always the civilian, and more interested in a nice warm bath and good food and drink, when what he wanted were challenges and exploits. And now his body has stepped to the fore, but in a totally different way, declaring its independence and putting on airs—by means of illness. He’s lambent, still toxic, and doesn’t seem to get any sturdier, no matter how much he wants to be a soldier in the flatlands. Look at him, a perfect adult male, an absolute Apollo Belvedere, to a T. But inside, Joachim is ill, and outside he’s too warm—because of illness. Illness makes people even more physical, turns them into only a body.” And he was so taken aback by the thought that he rapidly shifted his searching glance from Joachim’s naked upper torso to his eyes, to his large, black, gentle eyes, with tears in them from all the forced coughs and deep breaths of the examination. Those eyes were gazing mournfully now beyond his audience, into space."
"Was war es mit dem ehrliebenden Joachim? In den letzten Tagen waren seine Augen so unsicher und scheu geworden. Noch neulich war Oberin Mylendonk mit ihrem Durchbohrungsversuch an seinem sanften dunklen Blick gescheitert, allein wenn sie jetzt ihr Heil noch einmal versuchte, war man wahrhaftig nicht mehr sicher, wie die Sache ablaufen würde. Jedenfalls vermied er solche Begegnungen, und wenn es dennoch dazu kam (denn Hans Castorp sah ihn viel an), so wurde einem auch dabei nicht wohler. Bedrückt blieb Hans Castorp in seinem Abteil zurück, in treibender Versuchung, den Chef sogleich zur Rede zu stellen. Doch ging das nicht an, da Joachim sein Aufstehen gehört hätte, und so war Aufschub geboten und Behrens im Laufe des Nachmittags abzufangen.","What was it with honor-loving Joachim? In the last few days his eyes had become so uncertain and shy. Only recently Oberin Mylendonk had failed with her attempt at piercing because of his gentle, dark gaze, but if she now tried her salvation again, one really wasn't sure how things would turn out. In any case, he avoided such encounters, and when it did happen anyway (for Hans Castorp looked at him a lot), it didn't make you any happier. Depressed, Hans Castorp stayed behind in his compartment, tempted to confront the boss immediately. But that wasn't an option, since Joachim would have heard him getting up, so it was time to delay and intercept Behrens in the course of the afternoon.","What troubled our honour-loving Joachim? In these last days his eyes had grown so shy, so uncertain in their glance. Fräulein von Mylendonk’s efforts had suffered shipwreck only the other day against his mild dark gaze; but now had she tried, she might even have succeeded. For Joachim avoided meeting people’s eyes; and even when he met them, as he sometimes must notwithstanding, for his cousin looked at him a good deal, Hans Castorp was not greatly the wiser. He sat now in his balcony much cast down, and tempted to see the chief upon the spot, but refrained, for Joachim must have heard him get up; it was better to wait, and see Behrens later in the afternoon.","And how did things stand with honor-loving Joachim? In the last few days his glance had become very unsteady and reticent. Only recently Head Nurse Mylendonk had failed yet again in an attempt to fix his gentle, dark eyes with a piercing stare; but if she were to try her luck again, it was no longer absolutely certain how things would turn out. At any rate, he avoided such meetings of the eye, and even when they did occur (because Hans Castorp looked at him often), it did not make his cousin feel any better. Hans Castorp stayed behind on his balcony, depressed and sorely tempted to go see the boss then and there. But that was no good, since Joachim would have heard him get up, and so he decided he had best put it off and catch Behrens sometime later in the afternoon."
"»Wir?« dachte Hans Castorp gespannt … Wer sind »wir«? Ich muß unbedingt nachher Settembrini danach fragen, wen er mit »wir« meint.","""We?"" thought Hans Castorp curiously... Who are ""we""? I definitely have to ask Settembrini afterwards who he means by ""we.""","“We?” thought Hans Castorp, breathlessly. “Who are ‘we’? I must certainly ask Settembrini afterwards, whom he means by ‘we.’ ”","“We?” Hans Castorp thought, listening intently. “Who is ‘we’? I definitely must ask Settembrini later who it is he means by ‘we.’ ”"
"»Perfekt! Vorzüglich!« rief Peeperkorn und richtete sich auf. Seine Hände lösten sich, gingen auseinander und aufwärts, ausgebreitet, aufrecht, die Innenflächen nach außen, wie zu heidnischem Gebet. Seine großartige Physiognomie, eben noch von gotischem Schmerz beseelt, erblühte üppig und heiter; sogar ein sybaritisches Grübchen zeigte sich auf einmal in seiner Wange. »Die Stunde ist hie –« Und er ließ sich die Karte geben, setzte einen Hornklemmer auf, dessen Bügel ihm hoch an der Stirn emporragte, und bestellte Champagner, drei Flaschen Mumm & Co., Cordon rouge, très sec; dazu petits fours, {862}köstliche, kegelförmige kleine Schlemmerbissen, mit farbigem Zuckerguß überkleidet, von zartestem Biskuitcharakter, im Innern benetzt von Schokolade- und Pistaziencreme, und auf Papierdeckchen mit reichem Spitzenrande angeboten. Frau Stöhr leckte sich alle Finger bei ihrem Genuß. Herr Albin löste mit lässiger Routine den ersten Pfropfen aus seiner Haft von Draht, ließ den pilzförmigen Kork mit dem Knall einer Kinderpistole dem geschmückten Hals entschlüpfen und zur Dekke fahren, worauf er die Flasche nach elegantem Herkommen zum Einschenken in eine Serviette hüllte. Der edle Schaum befeuchtete das Linnen der Anrichtetischchen. Man ließ die Flachkelche klingen und leerte das erste Glas auf einen Zug, elektrisierte sich den Magen mit dem eiskalten, duftigen Geprickel. Die Augen glitzerten. Das Spiel hatte aufgehört, ohne daß man sich bemüßigt gesehen hätte, Karten und Geld vom Tische zu räumen. Die Gesellschaft überließ sich einem seli- gen Nichtstun, indem sie ein zusammenhangloses Geschwätz tauschte, dessen Elemente bei jedem einzelnen aus erhöhtem Gefühle stammten und in irgendeinem Urzustande das Schönste versprochen hatten, aus denen aber auf dem Wege zur Mitteilung ein fragmentarisch-lippenlahmer, teils indiskreter, teils unverständlicher Gallimathias wurde, geeignet, die zornige Scham jedes nüchtern Hinzukommenden zu erregen, doch von den Beteiligten ohne Beschwer ertragen, da alle sich in dem gleichen verantwortungslosen Zustand wiegten. Frau Magnus selbst hatte rote Ohren bekommen und gestand, sie fühle, wie Leben sie durchrinne, was aber Herrn Magnus nicht lieb zu sein schien. Hermine Kleefeld lehnte mit dem Rücken an der Schulter Herrn Albins, indem sie ihm ihren Kelch zum Einschenken vorhielt. Peeperkorn, das Bacchanal mit lanzenspitzen Kulturgebärden leitend, sorgte für Zufuhr und Nachschub. Er ließ Kaffee kommen nach dem Champagner, Mocca double, der wiederum von »Brot« begleitet war und von süßen {863}Scharfheiten, Apricots Brandy, Chartreuse, Crème de Vanille und Maraschino für die Damen. Später gab es noch saure Fischfilets und Bier dazu, endlich Tee, und zwar sowohl chinesischen wie Kamillentee für solche, die es nicht vorzogen, beim Sekt oder Likör zu bleiben oder zu einem ernsthaften Wein zurückzukehren, wie Mynheer selbst, der sich nach Mitternacht zusammen mit Frau Chauchat und Hans Castorp zu einem Schweizer Roten von naiv-spritziger Art durchgeläutert hatte, von dem er mit wirklichem Durst einen Glasbecher nach dem anderen hinunterschüttete.","""Perfect! Excellent!' cried Peeperkorn, straightening up. His hands parted, parted and ascended, spread, erect, palms outward, as in pagan prayer. His magnificent physiognomy, animated only a moment ago by Gothic pain, blossomed luxuriantly and cheerfully; even a sybaritic dimple suddenly appeared in his cheek. “The hour is here—” And he took the card, put on a horn clip that rose high on his forehead, and ordered champagne, three bottles of Mumm & Co., cordon rouge, très sec; in addition petits fours, {862}delicious, cone-shaped little delicacies, covered with colored icing, of the most delicate biscuit character, moistened on the inside with chocolate and pistachio cream, and offered on paper doilies with rich lace edges. Frau Stohr licked all her fingers as she enjoyed it. Mr. Albin loosened the first stopper from its hold on wire with casual routine, let the mushroom-shaped cork slip out of the decorated neck with the bang of a child's pistol and slide to the cover, whereupon he wrapped the bottle in a serviette, following elegant convention, for pouring. The noble foam moistened the linen of the side tables. You rattled the flat goblets and emptied the first glass in one go, electrifying your stomach with the ice-cold, fragrant tingling. The eyes glittered. The game had stopped without anyone having felt the need to remove cards and money from the table. Society allowed itself to be blissfully idle, exchanging incoherent gossip, the elements of which stemmed from heightened feelings in each individual and had promised the most beautiful things in some primal state, but from which, on the way to communication, a fragmentary, lame-lipped, partly indiscreet one , partly incomprehensible Gallimathias, was apt to arouse the angry embarrassment of every sober entrant, but endured without difficulty by those involved, since all lulled themselves in the same irresponsible state. Mrs Magnus herself had red ears and confessed to feeling life running through her, which Mr Magnus did not seem to appreciate. Hermine Kleefeld leaned with her back on Herr Albin's shoulder, holding out her goblet to pour. Peeperkorn, conducting the bacchanal with spear-pointed culture gestures, saw to the supply and replenishment. He ordered coffee after the champagne, mocha double, which was again accompanied by ""bread"" and sweet {863}spiciness, apricots brandy, chartreuse, crème de vanilla, and maraschino for the ladies. Later there were sour fish fillets and beer, and finally tea, both Chinese and chamomile, for those who preferred not to stick with sparkling wine or liqueur, or return to serious wine, like Mynheer himself, who joined after midnight with Frau Chauchat and Hans Castorp had refined it into a Swiss red of a naively bubbly kind, from which he downed one glass cup after the other with real thirst.","“Splendid, excellent,” Peeperkorn cried, and stood erect again. He unclasped his hands and spread them wide and high before him, palms outward—it looked like a heathen prayer. His majestic physiognomy, but now imprinted with Gothic anguish, blossomed once more in pagan jollity. Even a sybaritic dimple appeared in his cheek. “The hour is at hand,” said he, and sent for the wine-card. He put on a horn-rimmed pince-nez, the nose-piece of which rode high up on his forehead, and ordered champagne, three bottles of Mumm & Co., Cordon rouge, extra dry, with petits fours, toothsome cone-shaped little dainties in lace frills, covered with coloured frosting and filled with chocolate and pistache cream. Frau Stöhr licked her fingers after them. Herr Albin nonchalantly removed the wire from the first bottle, and let the mushroomshaped cork pop to the ceiling; elegantly he conformed to the ritual, holding the neck of the bottle wrapped in a serviette as he poured. The noble foam bedewed the cloth. Every glass rang as the guests saluted, then drank the first one empty at a draught, electrifying their digestive organs with the ice-cold, prickling, perfumed liquid. Every eye sparkled. The game had come to an end, no one troubled to take cards or gains from the table. They gave themselves over to a blissful far niente, enlivened by scraps of conversation in which, out of sheer high spirits, no one hung back. They uttered thoughts that in the thinking had seemed primevally fresh and beautiful, but in the saying somehow turned lame, stammering, indiscreet, a perfect gallimaufry, calculated to arouse the scorn of any sober onlooker. The audience, however, took no offence, all being in much the same irresponsible condition. Even Frau Magnus’s ears were red, and she admitted that she felt “as though life were running through her”— which Herr Magnus seemed not over-pleased to hear. Hermine Kleefeld leaned against Herr Albin’s shoulder as she held her glass to be filled. Peeperkorn conducted the Bacchanalian rout with his long-fingered gestures, and summoned additional supplies: coffee followed the champagne, “Mocha double,” with fresh rounds of “bread,” and pungent liqueurs: apricot brandy, chartreuse, crême de vanille, and maraschino for the ladies. Later there appeared marinated filets of fish, and beer; lastly tea, both Chinese and camomile, for those who had done with champagne and liqueurs and did not care to return to a sound wine, as Mynheer himself did; he, Frau Chauchat, and Hans Castorp working back after midnight to a Swiss red wine. Mynheer Peeperkorn, genuinely thirsty, drank down glass after glass of the simple, effervescent drink.","“Agreed! Excellent!” Peeperkorn cried and sat up straight. His hands now loosened, parted, were spread and raised, palms outward, as if in heathen prayer. His grand physiognomy, only just now animated with Gothic agony, blossomed with luxurious good cheer; even a sybaritic dimple made a brief appearance on one cheek. “Behold the hour is at hand—” And he told them to deal him a card, set a horn-rimmed pince-nez on his nose, its high bridge jutting up into his brow, and ordered champagne: three bottles of Mumm and Co., Cordon rouge, très sec; plus petits fours—luscious cone-shaped little delicacies, tenderest pastries glazed with colored sugar and marbled with chocolate or pistachio creams, each presented on a paper doily with a lacy trim. Frau Stöhr licked her fingers with gusto. Herr Albin released the first cork from its wire prison, a task of indolent routine, aimed the bottle at the ceiling, let the mushroom-shaped cork slip from its decorated neck with the pop of a toy gun, and then, as dictated by elegant tradition, wrapped the bottle in a napkin before pouring. Noble foam had moistened the linen on the little serving table. They all chinked shallow goblets and drank the first glass down, electrifying their stomachs with its ice-cold, fragrant tickle. Eyes glistened. The card game was over, although no one had troubled to gather up the cards and money from the table. The party gave itself over to its own blissful idleness; they exchanged disconnected small talk, scraps of elevated emotions, which in their primal state as ideas had promised ultimate beauty, but on the way to being spoken turned into fragmentary, slack-lipped gibberish, some of it indiscreet, some of it incomprehensible, all of it likely to have aroused angry embarrassment in any sober person who might have happened upon them, but accepted without complaint by the participants, who were all cradled in the same irresponsible mood. Frau Magnus ’s ears had turned red and she admitted that she felt as if life were coursing through her—which did not seem to please Herr Magnus. Hermine Kleefeld leaned her back against Herr Albin’s shoulder and held out her goblet for more champagne. Directing his bacchanalia with long-lanced, cultured gestures, Peeperkorn saw to it that supplies kept corning. He ordered coffee after the champagne, double mochas, which were once again served with “bread,” or sweet liqueurs—apricot brandy, chartreuse, crème de vanille, and maraschino—for the ladies. Later there was pickled herring and beer, and finally tea, including a Chinese chamomile, for anyone who had drunk enough champagne or liqueurs and did not wish to return to more serious wine, as had Mynheer, who, well after midnight, rang for a simple, sparkling Swiss red for himself, Frau Chauchat, and Hans Castorp—and poured down glass after glass in honest thirst."

"Das war das große Kolloquium über Gesundheit und Krankheit, das sich eines Tages, schon stark gegen Weihnachten hin, während eines Schneespazierganges nach »Platz« und wieder zurück aus solchen Differenzen entwickelte, und alle nahmen sie daran teil: Settembrini, Naphta, Hans Castorp, Ferge und Wehsal, – leicht fiebernd sämtlich, zugleich betäubt und erregt vom Gehen und Reden im Höhenfrost, zum Zittern geneigt ohne Ausnahme und, ob sie sich nun mehr tätig verhielten, wie Naphta und Settembrini, oder meist aufnehmend und nur mit kurzen Einwürfen das Gespräch begleitend, alle mit so angelegentlichem Eifer, daß sie oft selbstvergessen halt machten, eine tief beschäftigte, gestikulierende und durcheinander sprechende Gruppe bildeten und die Passage versperrten, unbekümmert um fremde Leute, die einen Bogen um sie beschreiben mußten und ebenfalls stehen blieben, das Ohr hinhielten und staunend ihren ausschweifenden Erörterungen lauschten.","That was the great colloquium on health and illness, which developed one day, well before Christmas, during a walk in the snow to »Platz« and back again from such differences, and they all took part: Settembrini, Naphta, Hans Castorp, Ferge and Wehsal - all slightly feverish, at the same time stunned and excited from walking and talking in the frost, without exception inclined to tremble and whether they behaved more actively, like Naphta and Settembrini, or mostly taking in the conversation and only making short interjections accompanying them, all with such eager zeal that they often halted, oblivious to themselves, forming a deeply occupied group, gesticulating and talking at once, and blocking the passage, unconcerned about strangers who had to make a detour around them and also stood still, putting their ears out and listened in amazement to their extravagant discussions.","That was in the course of the great disputation on sickness and health, which one day, close on Christmas, arose out of certain differences they had during a snowy walk to the Platz and back. They all took part Settembrini, Naphta, Hans Castorp, Ferge and Wehsal—one and all slightly feverish, at once nervously stimulated and physically lethargic from walking and talking in the severe frost, all subject to fits of shivering, and—whether principals in the argument, like Settembrini and Naphta, or for the most part receptive, like the others, contributing only short ejaculations from time to time—all, without exception, so utterly absorbed that they stopped several times by the way, in a disorderly, gesticulating knot, blocking the path of the passersby, who had to describe a circle to get round them. People even paused and listened in astonishment to their extravagance.","Then there was the great colloquy on health and sickness, which arose out of differences that became apparent one day, very close to Christmas, as they walked through the snow to Platz and back.

»Welcher Monsieur?«,"""What monsieur?""",“What monsieur?”,“Which monsieur?”
"»Bravo, bravo!« wurde gerufen. Man war schon beim Mokka, der in kleinen irden-braunen Kännchen serviert wurde, beziehungsweise auch bei den Likören, zum Beispiel Frau Stöhr, die Süß-Geistiges für ihr Leben gern schlürfte. Die Gesellschaft begann sich aufzulösen, zu zirkulieren. Man besuchte einan{494}der, wechselte die Tische. Ein Teil der Gäste hatte sich schon in die Konversationsräume verzogen, während ein anderer seßhaft blieb, dem Weingemisch weiter zusprechend. Settembrini kam nun persönlich herüber, sein Kaffeetäßchen in der Hand, den Zahnstocher zwischen den Lippen, und setzte sich hospitierend an die Tischecke zwischen Hans Castorp und die Lehrerin.","""Bravo, bravo!"" was shouted. One was already at the mocha, which was served in small earthen-brown pots, and also at the liqueurs, for example Mrs. Stöhr, who loved to sip sweets and spirits. Society began to dissolve, to circulate. People visited each other, changed tables. Some of the guests had already retreated to the conversation rooms, while others stayed put, continuing to enjoy the mixture of wines. Settembrini now came over in person, his coffee cup in his hand, toothpick between his lips, and sat down at the corner of the table between Hans Castorp and the teacher to observe.","“Bravo, bravo!” they shouted. They were drinking coffee by now, served in little brown earthenware jugs, and some of them liqueurs as well, for instance Frau Stöhr, who adored the sweet and spirituous. The company began to rise from table, to move about, to pay visits. Part of the guests had already moved into the reception-rooms, others remained seated, still faithful to the drink they had mingled. Settembrini, coffee-cup in hand, sporting his toothpick, crossed over and sat down between Hans Castorp and the schoolmistress.","“Bravo, bravo!” someone shouted. They were drinking their mocha now, served in little earthen-brown jugs, and some had liqueurs as well—Frau Stöhr for example, who simply loved to sip sweet spirits. People began to get up and circulate about the room. They visited one another’s tables. One group of guests had already moved on to the social rooms, while another stayed where they were in order to apply themselves to more burgundy and champagne. Settembrini came over in person now, coffee cup in hand, a toothpick between his lips, and made himself at home between Hans Castorp and the teacher."
»Du kommst also wieder!«,"""So you're coming back!""",“Then you are coming back!”,“So you will be coming back?”
"Darauf denn nun Herr Settembrini! Allzu kühn, rief er, kehre der andere seinen Geschmack an der inbrünstigen Barbarei gewisser Epochen hervor, indem er die Liebe zur literarischen Form verhöhne, ohne die allerdings keine Menschlichkeit möglich und denkbar sei, allerdings nicht und nimmermehr! Vornehmheit? Nur Menschenfeindschaft könne die Wortlosigkeit, die rohe und stumme Dinglichkeit auf ihren Namen tau{788}fen. Vornehm vielmehr sei einzig ein gewisser edler Luxus, die generosità, die sich darin bekunde, der Form einen menschlichen, vom Inhalt unabhängigen Eigenwert beizulegen, – der Kultus der Rede als einer Kunst um der Kunst willen, dies Erbe der griechisch-römischen Zivilisation, welches die Humanisten, die uomini letterati, der Romania, ihr wenigstens, zurückgebracht hätten, und das die Quelle jedes weiteren und inhaltlichen Idealismus, auch des politischen, sei. »Jawohl, mein Herr! Was Sie als Trennung von Rede und Leben verunglimpfen möchten, ist nichts als höhere Einheit im Kronrund des Schönen, und mir ist nicht bange, auf welche Seite in einem Streit, dessen Wahlfälle Literatur und Barbarei heißen, hochherzige Jugend sich immer schlagen wird.«","Then Mr. Settembrini! All too boldly, he exclaimed, the other shows his taste for the fervent barbarism of certain epochs by mocking the love of literary form, without which, of course, no humanity is possible and conceivable, but not and never! distinction? Only misanthropy could baptize the wordlessness, the raw and dumb materiality. Rather, what is noble is a certain noble luxury, the generosità, which manifests itself in attributing a human intrinsic value to the form, independent of the content – the cult of speech as an art for the sake of art, this legacy of Greco-Roman civilization, which the humanists who brought back uomini letterati, of Romania, at least you, and that is the source of all further and substantive idealism, including the political one. ""Yes sir! What you wish to denigrate as the separation of speech and life is nothing but a higher unity in the crown of beauty, and I am not afraid which side generous youth will always take in a quarrel whose choices are literature and barbarism.”","But now Herr Settembrini sprang into the breach. His opponent, he cried, was rash to expose his preference for the intense barbarism of certain epochs, and to pour scorn upon a love of literary form—without which no human nature was possible or thinkable, never had been and never would be! Fundamental nobility? Only misanthropy could so characterize the absence of letters, a rude and tongue-tied materialism. Rather you could only rightly so characterize a certain lordly luxuriance, the generosità which displayed itself in ascribing to form a human value independent of its content—the cult of speech as an art for art’s sake, the inheritance bequeathed by the Græco-Roman culture, which the humanists, the uomini letterati, had restored, restored at least to the Romance nations, and which was the source of every later significant idealism, even political. “Yes, my dear sir! That which you would disparage as a divorce between literature and life is nothing but a higher unity in the diadem of the beautiful; I am under no apprehension as to the side on which highhearted youth will choose to fight, in a struggle where the opposing camps are literature and barbarism.”","And here came Herr Settembrini! His opponent’s contempt for the love of literary form, he cried, only too plainly revealed a taste for the frenzied barbarism of certain epochs, but without such a love no true humanity was possible, or even conceivable, not now, not ever. Nobility? Only a misanthrope could christen the lack of the Word—raw, mute reality itself—with such a name. Nobility was, rather, a certain lofty abundance, generosità, which revealed itself by ascribing to form a human value quite independent of content; the cultivation of public speaking as an art for art’s sake, this legacy of Greco-Roman civilization, which humanists, the uomini letterati, had restored for those who spoke Romance languages, for them at least, was the source of every further meaningful idealism, including political idealism. “Yes, my good sir. What you would like to revile as the disjuncture of speech and life is nothing more than a higher unity in beauty’s crown, and I have no fear which side high-minded youth will always take in a struggle where the choice is between literature and barbarism.”"

"Die Teilnehmer – es waren fast lauter alte Bekannte von uns, und auch Hans Castorp war darunter – zeigten sich bei den Versuchen mehr oder weniger anstellig oder versagten auch gänzlich. Die Tauglichkeit Elly Brands aber erwies sich als außerordentlich, als auffallend, als ungebührlich. Ihre sichere Findigkeit im Aufsuchen von Verstecken hatte unter Beifall und bewunderndem Gelächter hingehen mögen; bei den kombinierten Handlungen jedoch fing man an zu verstummen. Sie führte aus, was immer man ihr heimlich vorgeschrieben, führte es aus, sobald sie wieder eingetreten, mit sanftem Lächeln, ohne ein Schwanken, auch ohne leitende Musik. Sie holte aus dem Speisesaal eine Prise Salz, streute sie dem Staatsanwalt Paravant {995}auf den Kopf, nahm ihn danach bei der Hand und führte ihn zum Klavier, wo sie mit seinem Zeigefinger den Anfang des Liedchens »Kommt ein Vogel geflogen« spielte. Dann brachte sie ihn zu seinem Platze zurück, machte einen Knix vor ihm, zog einen Fußschemel herbei und setzte sich abschließend darauf zu seinen Füßen nieder, – genau so, wie man es sich unter vielem Kopfzerbrechen für sie ausgedacht.","The participants – they were almost all old acquaintances of ours, and Hans Castorp was one of them – proved to be more or less competent in the tests or failed completely. Elly Brand's suitability, however, proved to be extraordinary, conspicuous, and improper. Her sure resourcefulness in finding hiding places might have been met with applause and admiring laughter; however, with the combined actions, one began to fall silent. She performed whatever was secretly told to her, performed it as soon as she re-entered, with a gentle smile, without hesitation, even without leading music. She fetched a pinch of salt from the dining room, sprinkled it on the head of the prosecutor Paravant {995}, then took him by the hand and led him to the piano, where she played the beginning of the little song ""Comes a bird flew"" with her index finger. Then she brought him back to his place, curtseyed before him, pulled out a footstool, and finally sat down on it at his feet—exactly as, with much agonizing thought, was conceived for her.","The participants were nearly all old friends of ours, among them Hans Castorp. They showed themselves apt in greater or less degree—some of them were entirely incapable. But Elly Brand’s talent was soon seen to be surpassing, striking, unseemly. Her power of finding hidden articles was passed over with applause and admiring laughter. But when it came to a concerted series of actions, they were struck dumb. She did whatever they had covenanted she should do , did it directly she entered the room; with a gentle smile, without hesitation, without the help of music. She fetched a pinch of salt from the dining-room, sprinkled it over Lawyer Paravant’s head, took him by the hand, led him to the piano and played the beginning of a nursery ditty with his forefinger; then brought him back to his seat, curtseyed, fetched a footstool and finally seated herself at his feet, all of that being precisely what they had cudgelled their brains to set her for a task.","The participants—almost all of them old acquaintances of ours, including Hans Castorp—showed some skill, to a greater or lesser degree, although a few of them were totally inept. Elly Brand’s abilities turned out to be quite extraordinary, sensational, unseemly. Her resourcefulness in searching out hidden objects was greeted with much applause and admiring laughter, and that might have been the end of it; but when she began guessing her complicated task, people slowly fell silent. She accomplished everything they had secretly assigned her to do, carried it out the moment she entered the room, with a gentle smile, without hesitation, and without musical accompaniment, either. She fetched a pinch of salt from the dining hall and sprinkled it on Prosecutor Paravant’s head, then took him by the hand, led him to the piano, and held his forefinger to plunk out the beginning of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” Then she brought him back to his seat, curtsied, pulled over a footstool, and sat down at his feet—exactly as they had racked their brains to devise."
"»Ja, er ist mein Vetter«, bestätigte er unnötigerweise. »Ich sah auch vorhin, daß er fort ist. Er wird sich gelegt haben.«","""Yes, he's my cousin,"" he confirmed unnecessarily. 'I saw earlier that he's gone. He will have settled down.'","“Yes, he is my cousin,” he confirmed her, unnecessarily. “I noticed he had gone, he is probably in the rest-cure by now.”","“Yes, he is my cousin,” he confirmed quite unnecessarily. “I also noticed a while ago that he had left. I’m sure he’s taking his rest cure.”"

"»Danke, Herr Naphta. Dem bringt wohl jedermann aufrichtige Sympathie entgegen, ein so braver Junge, wie er ja offensichtlich ist.

Da höre ich nun, daß er Logenbruder ist. Sehe einer an. Es berührt mich nachdenklich, das muß ich sagen. Es rückt mir seine Person in eine neue Beleuchtung und verdeutlicht mir manches.

I must say that gives me to think. It sets his personality in a new light, and clarifies certain things for me. Does he go about putting his foot at the right angle and shaking hands with a particular grip? I have never seen anything—”","“Thanks, Herr Naphta. It seems everyone takes an honest liking to him—he’s obviously such a fine lad. Even Herr Settembrini has a genuine soft spot for him, although he must disapprove, of course, of a certain fanatical terrorism that goes with Joachim’s profession. And now I hear he’s a Freemason—what do you know! Makes a man stop and think, I must say. It puts his personality in a whole new light, makes a lot of things clearer. I wonder if he sometimes places his feet at just the right angle and adds a special grip to his handshake? Not that I’ve ever noticed anything . . .”"
"Herr Albin hatte welche. Außer dem blanken kleinen Revolver, mit dem er die Damen zu ängstigen liebte, besaß er noch ein Zwillingspaar in den Samt eines gemeinsamen Etuis gebetteter Offizierspistolen, die aus Belgien stammten: automatische Brownings mit Griffen aus braunem Holz, in denen sich die Magazine befanden, bläulich stählerner Geschützmaschinerie und blank gedrehten Rohren, auf deren Mündungen knapp und fein die Visiere saßen. Hans Castorp hatte sie irgendwann einmal bei dem Windbeutel gesehen und erbot sich gegen seine Überzeugung, aus reiner Umfangenheit, sie von ihm auszuleihen. So tat er, indem er aus dem Zwecke sachlich kein Hehl machte, ihn aber in persönliches Ehrengeheimnis hüllte und mit leichtem Erfolge sich an den Kavalierssinn des Windbeutels wandte. Herr Albin unterwies ihn sogar im Laden und gab mit ihm im Freien blinde Probeschüsse aus beiden Gewehren ab.","Mr. Albin had some. Besides the shiny little revolver with which he loved to frighten the ladies, he also owned a pair of twins in the velvet of a common case of bedded officers' pistols, which came from Belgium: automatic Brownings with handles of brown wood, in which the magazines were, bluish steel gun machinery and brightly turned barrels, on the muzzles of which the sights sat tight and fine. Hans Castorp had once seen them by the cream puff and, against his conviction, offered to borrow them out of sheer volition. He did so, making no secret of the purpose, but shrouding it in a personal secret of honor and turning to the cavalier sense of the cream puff with little success. Herr Albin even instructed him in the shop and fired blind test shots with him from both rifles outdoors.","Herr Albin had. Besides the shiny little revolver with which he loved to frighten the ladies, he had a pair of officer’s pistols from Belgium in a velvet case: Browning automatics, with brown wooden butts holding the magazine, blued steel mechanism and shining barrels, with crisp little sights atop. Hans Castorp had seen them in Herr Albin’s room, and against his own convictions, out of sheer compulsion from the prevailing temper, offered to borrow them. He made no concealment of the purpose they were to serve, but appealing to the young swaggerer’s honour, readily swore him to secrecy. Herr Albin instructed him how to load the pistols, and they tested both weapons with blank shots in the open.","Herr Albin did. In addition to the shiny little revolver with which he loved to frighten the ladies, he also owned a pair of officer’s pistols, twins bedded together in a velvet-lined case; they were Belgian-made automatic Brownings, with brown wooden butts that held the magazines, with bluish steel mechanisms and shiny, rifled barrels, their spare, dainty sights set atop the muzzles. Hans Castorp had once noticed them in the blowhard’s room and offered—against his better judgment, in a spirit of absolute neutrality—to borrow the pistols from him. Not even attempting to disguise his purpose, he found it easy to appeal to Herr Albin’s sense of chivalry, though he did ask that it be kept secret as a matter of personal honor. Herr Albin even showed him how to load them, and out in the open they practiced firing blanks with both pistols."
"»Ich nehme diesen«, sagte er, ohne dem anderen nur Beachtung zu schenken. »Den hier zu fünf. Darf ich Ihnen sofort …«","""I'll take this one,"" he said, not even paying attention to the other. “This one for five.

"Von Hamburg bis dort hinauf, das ist aber eine weite Reise; zu weit eigentlich im Verhältnis zu einem so kurzen Aufenthalt.

"Hans Castorp hielt sich bis spät in die Nacht in seiner Balkonloge über dem verwunschenen Wintertal, weit länger als Joachim, der sich um zehn, oder doch nicht viel später, zurückzog. Sein vorzüglicher Liegestuhl mit dem dreiteiligen Polster und der Nackenrolle war nahe an das Holzgeländer gerückt, auf dem ein Kissen von Schnee sich hinzog; auf dem weißen Tischchen daneben brannte die elektrische Lampe und stand neben einem Stapel Bücher ein Glas fetter Milch, die Abendmilch, die allen Bewohnern des »Berghofs« noch um neun Uhr aufs Zimmer gebracht wurde, und in die Hans Castorp sich einen Schuß Kognak goß, um sie sich mundgerechter zu machen. Schon hatte er alle verfügbaren Schutzmittel gegen die Kälte aufgeboten, den ganzen Apparat. Bis über die Brust stak er in dem knöpfbaren Pelzsack, den er in einem einschlägigen Geschäft des Kurorts rechtzeitig erstanden, und hatte um diesen die beiden Kamelhaardecken nach dem Ritus geschlagen. Dazu trug er über dem Winteranzug seine kurze Pelzjacke, auf dem Kopf eine wollene Mütze, Filzstiefel an den Füßen und an den Händen dickgefütterte Handschuhe, die aber freilich das Erstarren der Finger nicht hindern konnten.","Hans Castorp stayed late into the night in his balcony box above the enchanted winter valley, far longer than Joachim, who retired at ten o'clock, or not much later. His exquisite lounge chair, with its three-piece cushion and bolster, was drawn close to the wooden railing, on which lay a pillow of snow; The electric lamp was on on the little white table next to it, and next to a pile of books stood a glass of fat milk, the evening milk that was brought to the rooms of all the residents of the ""Berghof"" at nine o'clock, and into which Hans Castorp poured himself a shot of cognac. to make them more bite-sized. He had already summoned all available means of protection against the cold, the whole apparatus. Up to his chest he was in the buttoned fur sack, which he had bought in good time in a shop in the spa town, and had wrapped the two camel's hair blankets around it according to the rite. He also wore his short fur jacket over his winter suit, a woolen hat on his head, felt boots on his feet and thickly lined gloves on his hands, which of course could not prevent his fingers from freezing.","Hans Castorp stopped until far into the night in his balcony above the ensorcelled winter scene—much longer than Joachim, who retired at ten or a little later.

Hans Castorp put a dash of cognac in his, to make it more palatable. Already he had availed himself of all his means of protection against the cold, the entire outfit: lay ensconced well up to his chest in the buttoned-up sleeping-sack he had acquired in one of the well-furnished shops in the Platz, with the two camel’s-hair rugs folded over it in accordance with the ritual.

You will feel the cold less on account of the dryness of the air and the absence of wind. It’s the thing about the change of temperature above the fog line; they’ve found out lately that it gets warmer in the upper reaches, something they did not know before. I should say it is actually colder when it rains. But you have your sleeping-bag, and they turn on the heat when they absolutely must.”","“You mustn’t imagine it as all that grim,” he said. “It’s not exactly the Arctic. You don’t feel the cold that much, because the air is so dry and the wind is still. If you wrap yourself up well, you can stay out on the balcony until deep into the night without freezing. It’s all about temperature inversions above the fog line—it gets warmer at higher altitudes. People didn’t really know about that before. It feels colder, in fact, when it rains. But you have your sleeping bag now, and they’ll even turn on the heat a bit if worse comes to worst.”"

"Es gab da Töpfe mit Marmeladen und Honig, Schüsseln mit Milchreis und Haferbrei, Platten mit Rührei und kaltem Fleisch; Butter war freigebig aufgestellt, jemand lüftete die Glasglocke über einem tränenden Schweizer Käse, um davon abzuschneiden, und eine Schale mit frischem und trockenem Obst stand obendrein in der Mitte des Tisches. Eine Saaltochter in Schwarz und Weiß fragte Hans Castorp, was er zu trinken wünsche: Kakao, Kaffee oder Tee. Sie war klein wie ein Kind, mit einem alten, langen Gesicht, – eine Zwergin, wie er mit Schrek{69}ken erkannte. Er sah seinen Vetter an, aber da dieser nur gleichmütig mit Schultern und Brauen zuckte, als wollte er sagen: »Ja, nun, was weiter?«, so fügte er sich in die Tatsachen, bat mit besonderer Höflichkeit um Tee, da es eine Zwergin war, die ihn fragte, und begann Milchreis mit Zimt und Zucker zu essen, während seine Augen über die anderen Speisen hingingen, von denen zu kosten ihn verlangte, und über die Gästeschaft an den sieben Tischen, Joachims Kollegen und Schicksalsgenossen, die alle innerlich krank waren und schwatzend frühstückten.","There were pots of jam and honey, bowls of rice pudding and oatmeal, platters of scrambled eggs and cold meat; Butter was profusely displayed, someone lifted the glass dome over a sodden Swiss cheese to slice off, and a bowl of fresh and dried fruit also sat in the center of the table. A maid in black and white asked Hans Castorp what he wanted to drink: cocoa, coffee or tea. She was as small as a child, with an old, long face - a dwarf, as he recognized with a shock. He looked at his cousin, but as he merely shrugged his shoulders and eyebrows indifferently, as if to say, ""Yes, well, what next?"" dwarf who asked him, and began to eat rice pudding with cinnamon and sugar, while his eyes wandered over the other dishes he desired to taste, and over the guests at the seven tables, Joachim's colleagues and fellow sufferers, all of them inwardly were sick and had breakfast chattering.","There were pots of marmalade and honey, basins of rice and oatmeal porridge, dishes of cold meat and scrambled eggs; a plenitude of butter, a Gruyère cheese dropping moisture under a glass bell.

She was small as a child, with a long, oldish face—a dwarf, he realized with a start. He looked at his cousin, who only shrugged indifferently with brows and shoulders, as though to say: “Well, what of it?” So he adjusted himself as speedily as possible to the fact that he was being served by a dwarf, and put special consideration into his voice as he asked for tea. Then he began eating rice with cinnamon and sugar, his eyes roving over the table full of other inviting viands, and over the guests at the six remaining tables, Joachim’s companions and fellow victims, who were all inwardly infected, and now sat there breakfasting.","There were pots of marmalade and honey, bowls of oatmeal and creamed rice, plates of scrambled eggs and cold meats; they had been generous with the butter.

"Hans Castorp hatte sich Tee geben lassen und tauchte Zwieback hinein. Auch etwas Marmelade versuchte er. Den Rosinenkuchen betrachtete er genau, doch erzitterte er buchstäblich bei dem Gedanken, davon zu essen. Abermals saß er an seinem Platze im Saal mit dem einfältig bunten Gewölbe, den sieben Tischen, – zum viertenmal. Etwas später, um sieben Uhr, saß er zum fünftenmal dort, und da galt es das Abendessen. In die Zwischenzeit, welche kurz und nichtig war, fiel ein Spaziergang zu jener Bank an der Bergwand, beim Wasserrinnsal – der Weg war jetzt dicht belebt von Patienten, so daß die Vettern häufig zu grüßen hatten – und eine neuerliche Liegekur auf dem Balkon, von flüchtigen und gehaltlosen anderthalb Stunden.

A little later, at seven o'clock, he sat there for the fifth time, and then it was dinner time. In the meantime, which was short and meaningless, there was a walk to that bench on the mountain wall, by the trickle of water - the path was now crowded with patients, so that the cousins often had to say hello - and another rest cure on the balcony, from fleeting and meaningless hour and a half. Hans Castorp shivered violently.","Hans Castorp chose tea, and dipped zwieback in it; he also tasted some marmalade.

Later, at seven o’clock, he sat there again, for the fifth time, and that was supper. In the brief and trifling interval the cousins had taken a turn as far as the bench on the mountain-side, beside the little watercourse. The path had been full of patients; Hans Castorp had often to lift his hat.","Hans Castorp had them bring him tea, and he dunked zwieback in it. He tried a little marmalade, too.

"»Und der Katarrh?« versetzte der Hofrat … »Wovon kommt der? Lassen Sie sich mal was erzählen, Castorp, und passen Sie auf, Sie verfügen ja über hinlänglich zahlreiche Hirnwindungen, soviel ich weiß. Also die Luft hier bei uns, die ist gut gegen die Krankheit, meinen Sie, nicht wahr? Und das ist auch so. Aber sie ist auch gut für die Krankheit, verstehen Sie mich, sie fördert sie erst einmal, sie revolutioniert den Körper, sie bringt die latente Krankheit zum Ausbruch, und so ein Ausbruch, {278}nichts für ungut, ist Ihr Katarrh. Ich weiß nicht, ob Sie schon unten im Tieflande febril gewesen sind, aber hier oben sind Sie es jedenfalls gleich am ersten Tage geworden und nicht erst durch Ihren Katarrh, – um meine Meinung zu sagen.«","""And the catarrh?"" replied the privy councillor. ""Where does it come from? Let me tell you something, Castorp, and watch out, as far as I know you have a sufficiently large number of convolutions in your brain. So the air here with us, it's good against the disease, don't you think? And that's the way it is. But it's also good for the disease, understand me, it promotes it first of all, it revolutionizes the body, it brings about the outbreak of the latent disease, and such an outbreak, {278}no offense, is your catarrh. I don't know if you were already febrile down in the lowlands, but up here you became febrile on the very first day and not just because of your catarrh - to give you my opinion.""","“And the cold,” rejoined the Hofrat, “where does that come from? Listen, Castorp, let me tell you something, and mark my words—for so far as I can tell, you’ve all the cerebral convolutions a body needs. Now: our air up here is good for the disease—I mean good against the disease , you understand—you think so, don’t you? Well, it is true. But also it is good for the disease; it begins by speeding it up, in that it revolutionizes the whole body; it brings the latent weakness to the surface and makes it break out. Your catarrh, fortunately for you, is a breaking-out of that kind. I can’t tell if you were febrile down below; but it is certainly my opinion that you have been from your first day up here, and not merely since you had your catarrh.”","“And the catarrh?” the director retorted. “Where does it come from? Let me tell you something, Castorp, and pay close attention now—you certainly have sufficient gray matter for that, as far as I can see. First and foremost: there’s the air up here. It’s good for fighting off illness, wouldn’t you say? And you’d be right. But it is also good for illness, you see, because it first enhances it, creates a revolution in the body, causes latent illness to erupt, and your catarrh—no offense intended—is just such an eruption. I don’t know if you were already febrile down in the plains, but in any case you had a fever your very first day here, and not because of any catarrh—that, at least, is my opinion.”"
"»Selbstredend«, sagte Hans Castorp, der hinter des Hofrats Schulter stand, und schloß die Augen, da es ganz gleichgültig war, ob man sie offen hielt, oder nicht, so schwarz war die Nacht. »Erst müssen wir uns mal die Augen mit Finsternis {330}waschen, um so was zu sehen, das ist doch klar. Ich finde es sogar gut und richtig, daß wir uns vorher ein bißchen sammeln, sozusagen in stillem Gebet. Ich stehe hier und habe die Augen geschlossen, es ist mir angenehm schläfrig zu Sinn. Aber wonach riecht es hier nur?«","""Of course,"" said Hans Castorp, who was standing behind the councilor's shoulder, and closed his eyes, since it made absolutely no difference whether one kept them open or not, the night was so black. ""First we'll have to wash our eyes {330}with darkness to see something like that, that's obvious. I even think it's good and right for us to collect ourselves a little beforehand, in quiet prayer, so to speak. I'm standing here with my eyes closed, feeling comfortably sleepy. But what does it smell like in here?'","“Naturally,” said Hans Castorp. He stood at the Hofrat’s shoulder, and closed his eyes, since the darkness was so profound that it did not matter whether he had them open or shut. “First we must wash our eyes with darkness to see what we want to see. That is plain. I find it quite right and proper, as a matter of fact, that we should collect ourselves a little, beforehand—in silent prayer, as it were. I am standing here with my eyes shut, and have quite a pleasant sleepy feeling. But what is it I smell?”","“Oh, but of course,” Hans Castorp said, standing now behind the director. He had closed his eyes, because in the pitch-black night it made no difference if they were open or shut. “We first have to let darkness wash over our eyes to see anything—that’s obvious. I even find it quite appropriate for us to gather together beforehand, in silent prayer, as it were. I’m standing here with my eyes closed and feeling pleasantly drowsy. But what’s that odor?”"

"Kurz, alles ging anders, als James es sich gedacht hatte, und das Gespräch mit der Oberin hatte seinem Gleichgewicht einen nachhaltigen Stoß versetzt. Zu zivilisiert, um dem Neffen, dessen Einigkeit mit den Erscheinungen hier oben aus seiner unberührbaren Ruhe deutlich hervorging, unhöflicherweise zu sagen, wie abschreckend ihm das Frauenzimmer dünkte, klopfte er nur vorsichtig mit der Erkundigung bei ihm an, die Oberin sei wohl eine recht originelle Dame, – was Hans Castorp, nachdem er flüchtig prüfend in die Luft geblickt, ihm halbwegs zugab, indem er die Frage zurückgab, ob die Mylendonk ihm ein Thermometer verkauft habe. – »Nein, mir? Ist das ihre Branche?« entgegnete der Onkel … Aber das Schlimme war, wie deutlich aus seines Neffen Miene hervorging, daß er sich auch dann nicht gewundert haben würde, wenn geschehen wäre, wonach er fragte. »Uns friert nicht«, stand in dieser Miene geschrieben. Den Konsul aber fror, ihn fror andauernd bei heißem Kopfe, und er überlegte, daß, wenn die Oberin ihm tatsächlich ein Thermometer angeboten hätte, er es gewiß zurückgewiesen haben würde, daß dies aber am Ende nicht richtig gewesen wäre, da man ein fremdes, zum Beispiel das des Neffen, zivilisierterweise nicht benutzen konnte.","In short, things weren't going the way James had imagined, and talking to the Matron had given his balance a lasting jolt. Too civilized to say impolitely to the nephew, whose agreement with the phenomena up here was clear from his untouchable calm, how deterrent the woman seemed to him, he only knocked cautiously at the door and inquired that the matron was probably a very original one Lady, - which Hans Castorp, after he glanced inquisitively into the air, halfway admitted, when he asked whether the Mylendonk had sold him a thermometer. - »No, me? Is that your line of business?” said the uncle… But the trouble was, as was evident from his nephew's expression, that even if what he was asking about had happened, he wouldn't have been surprised. ""We're not cold,"" was written in that expression. But the consul was cold, his head was hot all the time, and he reflected that if the matron had actually offered him a thermometer, he would certainly have refused it, but that in the end this would not have been right, since one had a foreign, for example that of the nephew, civilized could not use.","In short, it all turned out quite otherwise than James had expected, and the conversation with the Directress no little disturbed his equanimity. A man of his breeding hesitated to say rudely to his nephew that he found her an appalling person: it would be indiscreet, considering how plainly Hans Castorp’s manner revealed his acceptance of all the extraordinary phenomena up here. James merely tapped at his nephew’s door, and insinuated that Fräulein Mylendonk was surely extremely original. Hans Castorp looked up inquiringly, and half assented; asking, in his turn: “Did she sell you a thermometer?” “Me—no,” said his uncle. “Is that the custom up here?” The worst of it was that Hans Castorp would clearly not have been surprised if she had. It was “We don’t feel the cold” all over again. And the Consul did feel the cold, felt it persistently, though his head was hot. He thought to himself that if the Oberin had offered him a thermometer, he would certainly have refused it, and thereby have committed a blunder, since he could not ask to use his nephew’s—he was too civilized for that.","In short, everything went quite differently from how James had assumed it would, and the conversation with the head nurse was like a shove that kept him off-balance. He was too civilized to tell his nephew—whose calm indifference made it quite clear that he was in agreement with the way things were done up here —how terrifying he had found the woman, and so he simply rapped on his nephew’s door and circumspectly inquired if he did not also think the head nurse just a little odd. After first casting a fleeting, speculative glance in the air, Hans Castorp halfway assented to the idea by asking in return whether Head Nurse Mylendonk had sold him a thermometer. “ No. Me? Is she in the business?” his uncle replied. But the worst part was how clearly his nephew’s face said that he would not have been surprised if what he had asked had in fact occurred. “We’re never cold” was written in that expression. The consul, however, was cold, was constantly freezing although his head was hot; and he stopped to consider that if the head nurse had offered him a thermometer, he would have refused it, and yet it would not have been the right thing to do somehow, since it would be impolite to use someone else ’s, his nephew’s for example."

Ein sinnreiches Spielzeug also von der Art des stereoskopischen Guckkastens, des fernrohrförmigen Kaleidoskops und der kinematographischen Trommel? Allerdings – und auch wieder durchaus nicht. Denn erstens war das keine optische Veranstaltung, die man eines Abends – und man schlug die Hände teils über dem Kopf, teils in gebückter Haltung vorm Schoße zusammen – im Klaviersalon aufgebaut fand, sondern eine akustische; und ferner waren jene leichten Attraktionen nach Klasse, Rang und Wert überhaupt nicht mit ihr zu vergleichen. Das war kein kindliches und einförmiges Gaukelwerk, dessen man überdrüssig war, und das man nicht mehr anrührte, sobald man auch nur drei Wochen auf dem Buckel hatte. Es war ein strömendes Füllhorn heiteren und seelenschweren künstlerischen Genusses. Es war ein Musikapparat. Es war ein Grammophon.","{964}It was an increase in the entertainment devices in the main lounge, devised out of never resting care and decided upon by the administrative committee of the house, procured at a cost that we don't want to calculate, but which we can call generous, by the top management of this necessarily recommended institute. An ingenious toy, then, of the stereoscopic peep-box, telescopic kaleidoscope, and cinematographic drum type? However – and again not at all. First of all, it wasn't an optical event that you found set up one evening in the piano salon – and you sometimes clasped your hands over your head, sometimes in a stooped position in front of your lap – but an acoustic one; and further, those light attractions were not at all to be compared with her in class, rank, and value. This was not a childish and monotonous gimmick that you got tired of and didn't touch when you were even three weeks old. It was a flowing cornucopia of cheerful and soulful artistic enjoyment. It was a musical apparatus. It was a gramophone.","It acquired, at a cost which we need not go into, but which must surely have been considerable, a new device for the entertainment of the patients, and added it to those already installed in the largest of the reception-rooms of House Berghof. Was it some clever artifice, of the same nature as the stereopticon, the kaleidoscope, or the cinematographic cylinder? Yes—and yet, again, no, far from it. It was not an optical toy which the guests discovered one evening in the salon, and greeted with applause, some of them flinging their hands above their heads, others stooping over and clapping in their laps. It was an acoustical instrument. Moreover, the simple devices above-mentioned were not to be compared with it—they were outclassed, outvalued, outshone. This was no childish peep-show, like those of which all the guests were sick and tired, at which no one ever looked after the first few weeks. It was an overflowing cornucopia of artistic enjoyment, ranging from grave to gay. It was a musical apparatus. It was a gramophone.","In its never-resting concern for its guests, a thoughtful management had decided to add another amusing gadget to the collection in the main social room—purchased at a price we do not care to estimate, but that must have been considerable, a handsome disbursement on the part of the administration of this highly recommended institution. An ingenious toy, then, on the line of the stereoscopic viewer, the tubelike kaleidoscope, and the cinematographic drum? Yes indeed—and then again, not at all like them. First, it was not an optical contrivance that the guests found one evening in the music room—some of them greeting it by clasping their hands over their heads, others by folding them reverently with heads bowed—it was an acoustic instrument; and second, there was no comparison to those little mechanisms in value, status, and rank. This was no childish, monotonous peep show, of which they were all tired and with which no one bothered after his first three weeks here. It was an overflowing cornucopia of artistic pleasure, of delights for the soul from merry to somber. It was a musical apparatus. It was a gramophone."
"Dort oben, links von dem medizinischen Präsidium, hockte auf mehreren Kissen der bucklige Amateur-Photograph aus Mexiko, dessen Gesichtsausdruck vermöge sprachlicher Einsamkeit der eines Tauben war, und ihm zur Seite hatte das ältliche Fräulein aus Siebenbürgen ihren Platz, das, wie schon Herr Settembrini geklagt hatte, das Interesse aller Welt für ihren Schwager in Anspruch nahm, obgleich niemand etwas von diesem Menschen wußte, noch wissen wollte. Ein Stöckchen mit Tulasilberkrücke, dessen sie sich auch bei ihren Dienstpromenaden bediente, quer im Nacken, sah man sie zu bestimmten Stunden des Tages an der Brüstung ihrer Balkonloge ihre tellerflache Brust in hygienischen Tiefatmungen dehnen. Ein tschechischer Mann saß ihr gegenüber, den man Herr Wenzel nannte, da niemand seinen Familiennamen auszusprechen verstand. Herr Settembrini hatte sich seinerzeit zuweilen darin versucht, die krause Konsonantenfolge hervorzustoßen, aus der dieser Name bestand, – gewiß nicht in ehrlichem Bemühen, sondern nur um die vornehme Hilflosigkeit seiner Latinität an dem wilden Lautgestrüpp heiter zu erproben. Obwohl feist wie ein Dachs und von einer selbst unter Denen hier oben erstaunlich sich hervortuenden Eßlust, ver{642}sicherte der Böhme seit vier Jahren, daß er sterben müsse. Bei der Abendgeselligkeit klimperte er zuweilen auf einer bebänderten Mandoline die Lieder seiner Heimat und erzählte von seiner Zuckerrübenplantage, auf der lauter hübsche Mädchen arbeiteten. Schon in Hans Castorps Nähe folgten dann zu beiden Seiten des Tisches Herr und Frau Magnus, die Bierbrauersehegatten aus Halle. Melancholie umgab dieses Paar atmosphärisch, da beide lebenswichtige Stoffwechselprodukte, Herr Magnus Zucker, Frau Magnus dagegen Eiweiß, verloren. Die Gemütsverfassung, namentlich der bleichen Frau Magnus, schien jedes Einschlages von Hoffnung zu entbehren; Geistesöde ging wie ein kelleriger Hauch von ihr aus, und fast noch ausdrücklicher als die ungebildete Stöhr stellte sie jene Vereinigung von Krankheit und Dummheit dar, an der Hans Castorp, getadelt deswegen von Herrn Settembrini, geistigen Anstoß genommen hatte. Herr Magnus war regeren Sinnes und gesprächiger, wenn auch nur in der Art, die ehemals Settembrinis literarische Ungeduld erregt hatte. Auch neigte er zum Jähzorn und stieß öfters mit Herrn Wenzel aus politischen und sonstigen Anlässen feindlich zusammen. Denn ihn erbitterten die nationalen Aspirationen des Böhmen, der sich überdies zum Antialkoholismus bekannte und über den Erwerbszweig des Brauers moralisch Absprechendes äußerte, wogegen dieser mit rotem Kopf die sanitäre Unanfechtbarkeit des Getränkes vertrat, mit dem seine Interessen so innig verbunden waren. Bei solchen Gelegenheiten hatte früher Herr Settembrini humoristisch ausgleichend gewirkt; Hans Castorp aber, an seiner Statt, fand sich wenig geschickt und konnte nicht hinreichende Autorität in Anspruch nehmen, ihn darin zu ersetzen.","Up there, to the left of the medical headquarters, crouched on several cushions was the hunchbacked amateur photographer from Mexico, whose facial expression, owing to linguistic loneliness, was that of a deaf man, and at his side was the elderly lady from Transylvania, who, like Mr. Settembrini before him had complained that the whole world was interested in her brother-in-law, although no one knew or wanted to know anything about this person. A stick with a Tula silver crutch, which she also used when she was on duty, slung across her neck, at certain hours of the day she could be seen stretching her flat chest in hygienic deep breathing on the parapet of her balcony box. A Czech man sat across from her, whom they called Mr. Wenzel because nobody could pronounce his family name. M. Settembrini had at times attempted to eject the tangled sequence of consonants that made up this name—certainly not in an honest effort, but only to cheerfully test the noble helplessness of his Latinity against the wild undergrowth of sounds. Although as fat as a badger and with an appetite that is amazing even among those up here, the Bohemian has been affirming for four years that he must die. At the evening socials, he sometimes strummed the songs of his homeland on a mandolin with strings and talked about his sugar beet plantation, on which nothing but pretty girls worked. Mr. and Mrs. Magnus, the beer brewer's husband and wife from Halle, followed on both sides of the table, not far from Hans Castorp. Melancholy surrounded this couple atmospherically, as both vital metabolites, Mr. Magnus sugar, Ms. Magnus protein, on the other hand, lost. The state of mind, especially of the pale Mrs. Magnus, seemed to lack any touch of hope; Mental desolation emanated from her like a cellar breath, and almost more explicitly than the illiterate Stöhr she represented that combination of illness and stupidity which had caused Hans Castorp, who had been censured by Herr Settembrini, to take intellectual offense. Mr. Magnus was brighter and more talkative, if only in the way that had formerly aroused Settembrini's literary impatience. He was also prone to short temper and often had hostile encounters with Mr. Wenzel on political and other occasions. For he was embittered by the national aspirations of the Bohemians, who also professed anti-alcoholism and expressed moral negative opinions about the brewer's line of business, whereas the latter, with a red face, advocated the sanitary incontestability of the drink with which his interests were so closely connected. On such occasions M. Settembrini used to have a humorous balancing effect; But Hans Castorp, in his place, found himself inept and could not claim sufficient authority to replace him therein.","At the upper end, next the place of the medical presiding officer, the hump-backed Mexican sat, perched on many cushions; the amateur photographer, whose facial expression was that of a deaf person, because he possessed no language with which to communicate his thoughts. Beside him sat the ancient maiden lady from Siebenbürgen. She, as Herr Settembrini had said, claimed the interest of all and sundry for her brother-in-law, a man of whom nobody knew anything, or wished to know. Regularly at certain hours of the day this lady was to be seen at the balustrade of her loggia with a little Tula-silver-handled cane across the nape of her neck—it served also as a support on her walks—expanding her flat chest by means of deep-breathing exercises. Opposite her sat a Czech, whom everybody called Herr Wenzel, as his family name was impossible to pronounce. Herr Settembrini, indeed, did once essay to utter the involved succession of consonants; less in good faith than by way of testing gaily the elegant helplessness of his Latinity in face of that matted and tangled growth of sound. Although plump as a mole, with an appetite amazing even up here, the Czech had for four years been asseverating that there was no hope for him. Of an evening, he would strum the songs of his native land upon a beribboned mandolin; or talk about his sugar-beet plantation, and the pretty girls who worked it. On Hans Castorp’s either side sat the wedded pair from Halle, Magnus the brewer and his wife, about whom melancholy hung as a cloud, because they had no tolerance for certain important products of metabolism : he sugar, she albumen. Their spirits, particularly the sallow Frau Magnus’s, were proof against any ray of cheer; forlornity exhaled from her like damp from a cellar; even more than Frau Stöhr she represented that unedifying union of dullness and disease, which had offended Hans Castorp’s soul—under correction from Herr Settembrini. Herr Magnus was livelier and chattier, though only in a vein intolerable to the Italian’s literary sense. He was inclined to choler too, and often clashed with Herr Wenzel on political and other grounds. The nationalistic aspirations of the Czech exasperated him; again, the latter declared himself in favour of prohibition, and made moral remarks about the brewing industry, while Herr Magnus, very red in the face, defended from the hygienic viewpoint the unexceptionableness of the drink with which his interests were bound up. At such moments as these, Herr Settembrini’s light and humorous touch had often preserved the amenities; but Hans Castorp, in his place, found his authority little able to cope with the situation.","At the far end on his left, the hunchbacked amateur photographer from Mexico sat perched on several pillows, wearing the facial expression of a deaf man, the result of linguistic isolation; on his right was seated the old maid from Transylvania, a lady who, as Herr Settembrini had complained, demanded that everyone take an interest in her brother-in-law, although no one knew the man, nor wished to know him. At certain times of the day, she could be seen at the railing of her balcony doing hygienic deep-breathing exercises—her chest, flat as a platter, rising and falling and her cane with a niello-silver handle, which she also used on her constitutionals, held straight across the back of her neck. A Czech gentleman sat across from her; people called him Herr Wenzel, since no one could pronounce his real last name. In his day, Herr Settembrini had tried to utter its intricate succession of consonants—not, however, as an honest attempt at its wild jungle of sound, but as an amusing challenge for his own hopelessly elegant Latinity. Although this Bohemian was as stocky as a badger and displayed an appetite quite amazing even for people up here, he had been asserting for four years now that he would soon die. At their evening socials, he would occasionally plunk out the songs of his homeland on a ribboned mandolin or talk about his sugar-beet plantation, where only pretty maids worked. Closer to Hans Castorp, then, one on each side of the table, came Herr and Frau Magnus—the beer-brewer from Halle and his wife. Melancholy hung like a cloud over them, because both were steadily losing vital products of metabolism—Herr Magnus, sugar; Frau Magnus, protein. The mood of pallid Frau Magnus in particular seemed without a glimmer of hope; she exuded bleakness of spirit the way a cellar exudes damp. And perhaps even more explicitly than ignorant Frau Stöhr, she represented the union of sickness and stupidity that Hans Castorp had declared intellectually offensive—for which Settembrini had rebuked him. Herr Magnus was more talkative and lively by nature, although in ways that had once aroused Settembrini’s literary impatience. He was also inclined to temper tantrums and had frequently clashed with Herr Wenzel about politics or other matters, for he was incensed by the nationalist aspirations of the Bohemian, who likewise declared himself an advocate of temperance and would sometimes cast moral aspersions on the brewer’s profession, whereupon the latter would turn red-faced and defend the incontestable benefits to health found in the beverage with which his interests were so intimately entwined. On such occasions, Herr Settembrini’s humor had at one time helped to smooth matters over; but although he sat in the same chair now, Hans Castorp was less adept at this and unable to lay claim to the necessary authority."
"Der Normaltag war klar gegliedert und fürsorglich organisiert, man kam rasch in Trott und gewann Geläufigkeit, wenn man sich seinem Getriebe einfügte. Im Rahmen der Woche jedoch und größerer Zeiteinheiten unterlag er gewissen regelmäßigen Abwandlungen, die sich erst nach und nach einfanden, die eine zum erstenmal, nachdem die andere sich schon wiederholt hatte; und auch was die alltägliche Einzelerscheinung von Dingen und Gesichtern betraf, so hatte Hans Castorp noch auf Schritt und Tritt zu lernen, obenhin Angeschautes genauer zu bemerken und Neues mit jugendlicher Empfänglichkeit in sich aufzunehmen.","The normal day was clearly structured and caringly organized, you quickly got into the rut and gained fluency when you fitted into your gear. However, over the course of the week and larger units of time, it was subject to certain regular variations, which only appeared gradually, one for the first time after the other had already been repeated; And as far as the everyday individual appearance of things and faces was concerned, Hans Castorp still had to learn at every step to notice more precisely what was seen superficially and to take in new things with youthful receptivity.","The daily routine was clearly articulated, carefully organized; one fell quickly into step and, by yielding oneself to the general drift, was soon proficient. After that, indeed, within the weekly round, and also within other larger divisions of time, one discovered the existence of certain regular variations of the programme, which showed themselves, one at a time, a second one sometimes appearing only after the first had repeated itself. But even the phenomena of everyday life held much that Hans Castorp had still to learn: faces and facts already noted had to be conned, new ones to be absorbed with youth’s receptivity.","The normal day was carefully organized and neatly divided into its constituent parts; one quickly fell in with the routine and learned to move with its turning gears. In the framework of a week or larger units of time, however, there were certain recurring deviations that made their appearance little by little—one variation might appear, for instance, only after another had already repeated itself. And even in terms of the objects and faces that made up the details of a day, Hans Castorp had to learn at every step to take a closer, less casual look at accustomed facts and faces and assimilate new things with youthful receptivity."
"Neue Schlag- und Stichworte! Jetzt waren sie bei der Vornehmheit, der aristokratischen Frage! Hans Castorp, überhitzt und erschöpft von Frost und Problematik, taumeligen Urteils auch in Hinsicht auf die Verständlichkeit oder fiebrige Gewagtheit seiner eigenen Ausdrucksweise, bekannte mit lahmen Lippen, er habe sich den Tod von jeher mit einer gestärkten spanischen Krause vorgestellt, oder allenfalls, in kleiner Uniform sozusagen, mit Vatermördern, das Leben dagegen mit so einem gewöhnlichen modernen kleinen Stehkragen … Doch erschrak er selbst über das Trunken-Träumerische und Gesellschaftsunfähige seiner Rede und versicherte, nicht dies habe er sagen wollen. Aber ob es sich nicht so verhalte, daß es Leute gebe, gewisse Menschen, die man sich nicht tot vorzustellen vermöge, und zwar, weil sie so besonders ordinär seien! Das solle heißen: dermaßen lebenstüchtig muteten sie an, daß es einem vorkomme, als könnten sie niemals sterben, als seien sie der Weihe des Todes nicht würdig.","New catchphrases and keywords! Now they came to the distinction, the aristocratic question! Hans Castorp, overheated and exhausted by frost and problems, dizzy judgment also with regard to the comprehensibility or feverish daring of his own way of expression, confessed with lame lips that he had always imagined death with a strengthened Spanish ruff, or at most, with a smaller one Uniform, so to speak, with parricides, life on the other hand with an ordinary, modern little stand-up collar ... But he himself was shocked by the drunken, dreamy and socially inept nature of his speech and assured that that was not what he wanted to say. But isn't it true that there are people, certain people, who you can't imagine dead, because they are so particularly vulgar! That is to say: they seemed so fit for life that it seemed as if they could never die, as if they were not worthy of the consecration of death.","New cries, new catchwords! Now it was the “aristocratic principle.” Hans Castorp, all flushed and depleted from taxing his brains in the cold, shaky as to his capacity for clear expression, hot and cold with his own audacity, heard himself babble that always since a child he had pictured death to himself as wearing a starched ruff, or at least a sort of half-uniform, with a stand-up collar, while life, on the other hand, wore an ordinary collar. His words sounded, even to himself, like a drunken impropriety; he hastened to assure the company that that was not at all what he had meant to say. And yet—wasn’t it a fact that one couldn’t imagine certain people dead, simply because they were so very ordinary? That must mean they were very fit for life, but could not die, because unfit for the consecration of death.","More new catchwords. Now the issue was nobility, aristocracy. Hans Castorp, flushed and weary from the frosty air and all these uncertainties, his mind reeling as he wondered whether the way he was putting things was too feverishly daring or even comprehensible, admitted haltingly that he had always imagined death wearing a starched Spanish ruff, or at least in some sort of semi-uniform with a high stiff collar, whereas life always wore a little, normal, modern collar. And then aghast at his own social blunder, at the drunken dreaminess of his words, he assured them that was not what he had meant to say. But was it not true that there were people, certain individuals, whom one found it impossible to picture dead, precisely because they were so vulgar? That was to say: they seemed so fit for life, so good at it, that they would never die, as if they were unworthy of the consecration of death."
"»Sagen Sie das nicht«, wehrte der Hofrat ab. »Es war ein klotziges Stück Arbeit, ich bilde mir nicht ein, so recht damit fertig geworden zu sein, obgleich wir wohl zwanzig Sitzungen gehabt haben, – wie wollen Sie denn fertig werden mit einer so vertrackten Visage. Man denkt, sie muß leicht zu erwischen sein, mit ihren hyperboreischen Jochbeinen und den Augen, wie aufgesprungene Schnitte in Hefegebäck. Ja, hat sich was. Macht man die Einzelheit richtig, verpatzt man das Ganze. Das reine Vexierrätsel. Kennen Sie sie? Möglicherweise sollte man sie nicht abmalen, sondern nach dem Gedächtnis arbeiten. Kennen Sie sie denn?«","""Don't say that,"" the privy councilor said. 'It was a clumsy piece of work, I don't think I've quite finished it, although we must have had twenty sessions - how do you expect to deal with such a complicated visage. One thinks she must be easy to catch, with her hyperborean cheekbones and eyes like cracked cuts in a yeast cake. Yes, something has happened. If you get the detail right, you screw up the whole thing. The pure puzzle. Do you know her? Maybe you shouldn't copy them, but work from memory. Do you know her?'","“Oh, no,” the Hofrat demurred. “It was a pretty clumsy piece of work, I don’t flatter myself I hit her off very well, though we had, I suppose, twenty sittings. What can you do with a rum sort of face like that? You might think she would be easy to capture, with those hyperborean cheek-bones, and eyes like cracks in a loaf of bread. Yes, there’s something about her—if you get the detail right, you botch the ensemble. Riddle of the sphinx. Do you know her? It would probably be better to paint her from memory, instead of having her sit. Did you say you knew her?”","“Don’t say that,” the director objected. “I did a clumsy job. I don’t flatter myself that I handled it all that well, although I suppose we had twenty sessions at least. How can one handle an outlandish face like that? At first you think it will be easy to capture it, what with the swing of those hyperborean cheekbones and those eyes that look like cracks in a muffin. Yes, there is something special about her. You get the details right, and bungle the larger effect. A regular puzzle box. Do you know her? It might be better not to have her sit, but to paint her from memory. You know her, then, do you?”"
"Es will bemerkt sein, daß diese maurerischen Plaudereien, die zwischen dem Zögling und jedem der beiden Mentoren gesondert verliefen, noch in die Zeit vor Joachims Heimkehr zu Denen hier oben gefallen waren. Die Auseinandersetzung, auf die wir nun kommen, ereignete sich schon während seiner Wiederanwesenheit und in seiner Gegenwart, neun Wochen nach seiner Rückkehr, Anfang Oktober, und Hans Castorp behielt dies Beisammensein in der Herbstsonne vor dem Kurhaus in »Platz«, bei erfrischenden Getränken, darum allezeit so genau im Gedächtnis, weil Joachim ihm damals heimliche Sorge gemacht hatte, – Sorge durch Angaben und Erscheinungen, die sonst eben keine Sorge einzuflößen pflegen, nämlich durch Halsschmerzen und Heiserkeit: harmlose Belästigungen also, die aber dem jungen Castorp in einem irgendwie eigentümlichen Licht erschienen, – eben dem Licht, so kann man sagen, {782}das er in der Tiefe von Joachims Augen zu gewahren glaubte, diesen Augen, die immer sanft und groß gewesen waren, heute aber, genau erst heute, eine gewisse unbestimmbare Vergrößerung und Vertiefung von sinnendem und – man muß das sonderbare Wort hinzufügen – drohendem Ausdruck nebst jener erwähnten stillen Erleuchtung von innen her erfahren hatten, die ganz falsch gekennzeichnet wäre, wenn man sagte, sie hätte Hans Castorp nicht gefallen, – im Gegenteil, sie gefiel ihm sogar sehr gut, nur daß sie ihm dennoch Sorge machte. Und kurz, es ist über diese Eindrücke gar nicht anders als verworren, ihrem eigenen Charakter gemäß, zu reden.","It should be noted that these Masonic chats, which took place separately between the pupil and each of the two mentors, had occurred before Joachim's return to those above. The argument that we are now coming to took place while he was back and in his presence, nine weeks after his return, at the beginning of October, and Hans Castorp kept this get-together in the autumn sun in front of the Kurhaus in Platz, with refreshing drinks, therefore always remembered so clearly, because Joachim had secretly worried him at the time - worried by statements and phenomena that usually do not cause any concern, namely by sore throat and hoarseness: harmless annoyances, then, but in a somehow peculiar way to young Castorp Light appeared - just the light, one can say {782}that he thought he saw in the depths of Joachim's eyes, these eyes that had always been gentle and large, but today, precisely today, a certain indefinable enlargement and deepening of musing and - one must add the odd word - menacing expression along with that mentioned silent illumination of inside, which would be labeled quite wrongly if one said that Hans Castorp had not liked it - on the contrary, he actually liked it very much, only that it still worried him. And in short, it is nothing but confused to talk about these impressions, according to their own character.","It should be remarked that these Masonic conferences between the pupil and the two mentors took place separated in time, before Joachim’s return. The following conversation, however, occurred during his second stay up here, and in his presence, nine weeks after he arrived, at the beginning of October. Hans Castorp retained a clear memory of this gathering in the autumn sunshine, before the Kurhaus in the Platz, where they sat sipping cooling drinks; for it was just at that time he began to feel a secret concern about Joachim—though its ground was not one usually thought very important, being merely a sore throat and hoarseness, quite harmless afflictions, which yet appeared to Hans Castorp in a somewhat peculiar light—the same light, one might say, that he saw in the depths of Joachim’s eyes. Those eyes had always, we know, been large and mild, but to-day, precisely on this very day, had seemed to grow larger and deeper, with a musing, yes, we must even say an ominous expression, together with the above-mentioned light. It would have been false to say that Hans Castorp did not like the look of them; he did, only that it disquieted him. And, in short, one cannot, by their very nature, speak of these impressions otherwise than vaguely and confusedly.","It should be noted that these Masonic colloquies—held separately between the apprentice and each of his mentors—had taken place during the period before Joachim’s return home to the people up here. The discussion to which we now turn, however, occurred during his second stay and in his presence, at the beginning of October, nine weeks after his return; and Hans Castorp always remembered this particular gathering under an autumn sun on the terrace of the Kurhaus in Platz, where they sipped refreshing drinks, because his secret worries about Joachim had begun that day, worries aroused by statements and symptoms that would normally not arouse concern, a sore throat and hoarseness in particular, harmless irritations, which nevertheless Hans Castorp saw in a peculiar light somehow, the light, one might say, that he believed he saw shining deep in Joachim’s eyes, those eyes that had always been so gentle and large, but which that day, for the very first time, had grown indescribably larger and deeper, and along with their usual calm, inner light had taken on a meditative and—one has no choice but to use the word—ominous expression, which it would be quite wrong to say Hans Castorp had not liked, he had in fact liked it, except that it had also given rise to his worries. In short, one cannot help speaking about it in confusion commensurate with his confused impressions."
»Ja. Ich habe gewartet.«,"""Yes. I have waited.""",“Yes. I waited.”,“Yes. I’ve been waiting.”
"Ein Wasserfall ist immer ein anziehendes Ausflugsziel, und kaum wissen wir es zu rechtfertigen, daß Hans Castorp, der für fallendes Wasser sogar eine besondere Herzensneigung hegte, die malerische Kaskade im Walde des Flüelatals noch niemals besucht hatte. Für die Zeit seines Zusammenlebens mit Joachim mochte er entschuldigt sein durch die strenge Dienstlichkeit seines Vetters, der nicht zum Vergnügen hier gewesen war, und dessen sachlich-zweckhafter Sinn ihren Gesichtskreis auf die nächste Umgebung von Haus »Berghof« eingeschränkt hatte. Und nach seinem Ausscheiden – nun, auch danach hatte Hans Castorps Verhältnis zur hiesigen Landschaft, wenn man von seinen Skiunternehmungen absehen will, den Charakter {929}einer konservativen Einförmigkeit bewahrt, deren Kontrast zu der Spannweite seiner inneren Erfahrungen und »Regierungs«-obliegenheiten sogar nicht ohne einen gewissen bewußten Reiz für den jungen Mann gewesen war. Immerhin war seine Zustimmung lebhaft, als in seiner engeren Umgebung, diesem kleinen Freundeskreise von sieben Personen (ihn selber eingerechnet), der Plan einer Wagenfahrt nach jener empfohlenen Örtlichkeit erwogen wurde.","A waterfall is always an attractive destination, and we can hardly justify the fact that Hans Castorp, who even had a special affection for falling water, had never visited the picturesque cascade in the forest of the Flüelatal. He might have been excused for the time he lived with Joachim because of the strict official duties of his cousin, who had not been here for pleasure and whose functional sense of purpose had restricted her field of vision to the immediate vicinity of the Berghof house. And after his retirement - well, even after that, Hans Castorp's relationship to the local landscape, if you disregard his skiing ventures, retained the character of a conservative uniformity, the contrast to the range of his inner experiences and ""government"" duties even had not been without a certain conscious appeal to the young man. Nevertheless, his agreement was lively when in his immediate circle, this small circle of friends of seven people (including himself), the plan of a carriage ride to the recommended location was considered.","A WATERFALL is always an attractive goal for an excursion. We scarcely know how to explain why Hans Castorp, with all his native love of falling water, had never visited the picturesque cascade in the valley of the Fluela. His cousin’s strong sense of duty to the service had probably prevented him, during Joachim’s time; the latter’s purposeful attitude had tended to confine their activities to the close vicinity of the Berghof. But even since that time—if we except the winter excursions on skis—Hans Castorp’s relations with the mountain scenery had been extremely conservative, not to say monotonous. The young man found a curious pleasure in the contrast between the limitations of his physical sphere and the broad scope of his mental operations. However, when it was proposed that his little group of seven people should make a driving excursion to the waterfall, he readily assented.","A waterfall is always an inviting goal for an excursion, and we hardly know how to justify Hans Castorp’s never having visited the picturesque cascade in the forests of the Flüela Valley, particularly since he had a special fondness for falling water. He may be excused for not having done so during the period he lived with Joachim, since his cousin had not been here for pleasure and as a man with a strict sense of duty had limited his field of vision to purposeful business in the immediate vicinity of the Berghof. And after his demise—well, even after that, Hans Castorp’s relationship to the local landscape, if one ignores his ski outings, had maintained its conservative, monotone character, a trait that had held a certain special charm for the young man when he contrasted it with the range of his inner experiences and the duties involved in “playing king.” All the same, he had eagerly seconded the plan for a pilgrimage to this highly recommended site when it was suggested within his little circle of seven friends (counting himself)."

"»So ist es nicht gerade gemeint«, erwiderte Hans Castorp. »Ich lege einfach, ich balge mich mit dem abstrakten Zufall.

Wollen Sie glauben, daß ich jetzt zum zweiunddreißigstenmal auslege, ohne ein einziges Mal auch nur bis zur Hälfte des Spieles gekommen zu sein?«","""It's not exactly meant that way,"" replied Hans Castorp. “I just lay, I wrestle with abstract chance. I am intrigued by his capricious tricks, his servility and then again his unbelievable stubbornness. This morning, right after getting up, Patience came out clean three times in a row, once in two rows, which is a record. Do you want to believe that this is the thirty-second time I'm going to go out without even getting halfway through the game?""","“Not precisely playing cards,” Hans Castorp told him. “I am just laying them out, to have a tussle with abstract chance. The tricks it plays intrigue me, it is as inconsistent as the wind. It fawns on you, and then suddenly puts up its back and won’t budge. This morning, directly I got up, it came three times running, once in two rows, which is a record. But will you believe it, this is the thirty-third time I have played it without once going even halfway through?”","“That’s not quite it,” Hans Castorp replied. “I’m just laying the cards out, wrestling with abstract chance. I’m intrigued by its fickle tricks, the way it can toady up to you and then turn incredibly obstinate. This morning I got out of bed and easily won three games, one after the other, once only twice through—a record for me. And would you believe that I’ve laid them out thirty-two times in a row now, without being able to get halfway through even once?”"

"Das junge Blut mit seinen Ranzen und Spießgewehren, seinen verschmutzten Mänteln und Stiefeln! Man könnte sich humanistisch-schönseliger Weise auch andere Bilder erträumen in seiner Betrachtung. Man könnte es sich denken: Rosse regend und schwemmend in einer Meeresbucht, mit der Geliebten am Strande wandelnd, die Lippen am Ohre der weichen Braut, auch wie es glücklich freundschaftlich einander im Bogenschuß unterweist. Statt dessen liegt es, die Nase im Feuerdreck. Daß es das freudig tut, wenn auch in grenzenlosen Ängsten und unaussprechlichem Mutterheimweh, ist eine erhabene und beschämende Sache für sich, sollte jedoch kein Grund sein, es in die Lage zu bringen.","The young blood with their knapsacks and spearguns, their soiled coats and boots! In a humanistic, blissful way one could also dream up other images in his contemplation. One could imagine it: horses stirring and swimming in a sea bay, walking with the beloved on the beach, the lips on the ear of the soft bride, also how it happily and amicably instructs each other in archery. Instead, it lies with its nose in the fire dirt. That he does so joyfully, albeit in boundless fears and unspeakable mother homesickness, is a lofty and shameful thing in itself, but should not be a reason to put him in the position.","Ah, this young blood, with its knapsacks and bayonets, its mud-befouled boots and clothing! We look at it, our humanistic-æsthetic eye pictures it among scenes far other than these: we see these youths watering horses on a sunny arm of the sea; roving with the beloved one along the strand, the lover’s lips to the ear of the yielding bride; in happiest rivalry bending the bow. Alas, no, here they lie, their noses in fiery filth. They are glad to be here—albeit with boundless anguish, with unspeakable sickness for home; and this, of itself, is a noble and a shaming thing—but no good reason for bringing them to such a pass.","Youngsters with their backpacks and bayoneted rifles, with their filthy coats and boots—and in watching, one might also see them with a humanistic, beatific eye, might dream of other scenes. One might imagine such a lad spurring a horse on or swimming in a bay, strolling along the shore with a girlfriend, his lips pressed to his gentle beloved’s ear, or in happy friendship instructing another lad to string a bow. And instead, there they all lie, noses in the fiery filth. That they do it with joy, and also with boundless fear and an unutterable longing for home, is both shameful and sublime, but surely no reason to bring them here to this."
"»Das schien Ihnen nur so! Auf mein Wort, das war Täuschung«, sagte der Italiener mit einer entscheidenden Handbewegung. »Wir sind tief gesunkene Wesen, nicht wahr, Leutnant«, wandte er sich an Joachim, der sich über diese Anrede {91}nicht wenig freute, dies aber zu verbergen suchte und besonnen erwiderte:","“It only seemed so to you! On my word, that was a deception,' said the Italian with a decisive gesture. ""We are deeply sunk beings, aren't we, Lieutenant,"" he turned to Joachim, who was not a little pleased about this address, but tried to hide it and replied calmly:","“That was only seeming. Upon my honour, it was an illusion,” the Italian said, with a decisive-wave of the hand. “We are sunk enough here, aren’t we, Lieutenant?” he said to Joachim, who, no little gratified at this method of address, thought to hide his satisfaction, and answered reflectively:","“It only seemed that way to you. Upon my word—it was an illusion,” the Italian said with a decisive gesture of one hand. “We are creatures who have fallen to great depths, are we not, lieutenant?” he asked, turning to Joachim, who took considerable delight in the title, but tried to hide the fact in a sober reply."
"»Sehr netter Mann!« wiederholte Hans Castorp. »So eine flotte Redeweise hat er, es machte mir Spaß, ihm zuzuhören. ›Quecksilberzigarre‹ für ›Thermometer‹ ist doch ausgezeichnet, ich habe es gleich verstanden … Aber ich zünde mir nun eine richtige an,« sagte er stehenbleibend, »ich halte es nicht mehr aus! Seit gestern mittag habe ich nichts Ordentliches mehr geraucht … Entschuldige mal!« Und er entnahm seinem automobilledernen und mit silbernem Monogramm geschmückten Etui ein Exemplar von Maria Mancini, ein schönes Exemplar der obersten Lage, an einer Seite abgeplattet, wie er es besonders liebte, kupierte die Spitze mit einem kleinen, eckig schneidenden Instrument, das er an der Uhrkette trug, ließ seinen Taschenzündapparat aufflammen und setzte die ziemlich lange, vorn stumpfe Zigarre mit einigen hingebungsvoll paffenden Zügen in Brand. »So!« sagte er. »Nun können wir meinethalben den Lustwandel fortsetzen. Du rauchst natürlich nicht vor lauter Biereifer?«","""Very nice man!"" repeated Hans Castorp. 'He has such a snappy way of speaking, I enjoyed listening to him. 'Mercury cigar' for 'thermometer' is excellent, I understood it straight away... But I'll light a real one now,"" he said, stopping, ""I can't stand it any longer! I haven't smoked a decent smoke since noon yesterday the tip of a small, square-edged instrument that he wore on his watch chain ignited his pocket igniter and lit the fairly long, blunt-ended cigar with a few devotedly puffing puffs. he said. 'Now, for my part, we can continue the stroll. Of course you don't smoke because you're so keen on beer?""","“Very nice man,” repeated Hans Castorp. “He has such a flow of words I enjoy listening to him. ‘Quicksilver cigar’ was capital, I got it at once.—But I’ll just light up a real one,” he said, pausing, “I can’t hold out any longer. I haven’t had a proper smoke since yesterday after luncheon. Excuse me a minute.” He opened his automobile-leather case, with its silver monogram, and drew out a Maria Mancini, a beautiful specimen of the first layer, flattened on one side as he particularly liked it; he cut off the tip slantingly with a sharp little tool he wore on his watch-chain, then, striking a tiny flame with his pocket apparatus, puffed with concentration at the long, blunt-ended cigar until it was alight. “There!” he said. “Now, as far as I’m concerned, we can get on with the exercise. You don’t smoke—out of sheer doggedness, of course.”","“Very nice man,” Hans Castorp repeated. “Has such an easy way with words, it’s fun just to listen to him. ‘Mercury cigar’ for ‘thermometer’ is really quite splendid, I caught on right away. But I’m going to light a real one now,” he said, coming to a halt. “I can’t stand it any longer. I’ve not had a decent smoke since yesterday noon. Excuse me a moment.” And from a buff leather etui monogrammed in silver, he extracted one of his Maria Mancinis—a lovely specimen from the top of the box, flattened on just one side the way he especially liked it—trimmed the tip squarely with a small tool that hung from his watch chain, produced a flame from his pocket lighter, and after a bit of concentrated puffing managed to light the rather long, blunt-ended cigar. “There!” he said. “Now we can get on with our promenade, for all I care. Of course, being a zealot, you’re not smoking these days, are you?”"
"Hans Castorp, der sich verbeugt hatte, stand am Tische und sah auf die Tür, durch die sie verschwunden war, und auf das Instrument, das sie zurückgelassen. »Das war nun die Oberin von Mylendonk«, dachte er. »Settembrini mag sie nicht, und wahr ist es, sie hat ihre Unannehmlichkeiten. Das Gerstenkorn ist nicht schön, übrigens hat sie es ja wohl nicht immer. Aber warum nennt sie mich immer ›Menschenskind‹, noch dazu mit einem s in der Mitte? Es ist burschikos und sonderbar. Und da hat sie mir nun ein Thermometer verkauft, sie hat immer ein paar in der Tasche. Es soll ja hier überall welche geben, in allen Läden, auch da, wo man es gar nicht erwarten sollte, Joachim sagte es. Aber ich habe mich nicht zu bemühen brauchen, es ist mir von selbst in den Schoß gefallen.« Er nahm das zierliche Gerät aus dem Futteral, betrachtete es und ging dann mehrmals in Unruhe damit durch das Zimmer. Sein Herz klopfte rasch und stark. Er sah sich nach der offenen Balkontür um und machte eine Bewegung gegen die Zimmertür, aus dem Antriebe, Joachim aufzusuchen, unterließ es aber dann und blieb wieder am Tische stehen, indem er sich räusperte, um die Dumpfheit seiner Stimme zu prüfen. Hierauf hustete er. »Ja, ich muß nun sehn, ob ich Schnupfenfieber habe«, sagte er und führte rasch das Thermometer in den Mund, die Quecksilberspitze unter die Zunge, so daß das Instrument ihm schräg aufwärts zwischen den Lippen hervorragte, die er fest darum schloß, um keine Außenluft zuzulassen. Dann sah er nach seiner Armbanduhr: es war sechs Minuten nach halb zehn. Und er begann, auf den Ablauf von sieben Minuten zu warten.","Hans Castorp, who had bowed, stood at the table and looked at the door through which she had disappeared and at the instrument she had left behind. ""Now that was the Matron of Mylendonk,"" he thought. 'Settembrini doesn't like her, and it's true she has her troubles. The stye isn't pretty, and by the way, she doesn't always have it. But why does she keep calling me 'gosh' with an s in the middle? It's tomboyish and weird. And now she sold me a thermometer, she always has a few in her pocket. There's supposed to be one everywhere here, in all the shops, even in places where you shouldn't expect it, Joachim said. But I didn't have to bother, it fell into my lap of its own accord.' He took the dainty device out of its case, looked at it and then walked around the room with it several times in agitated manner. His heart was beating fast and strong. He looked around for the open balcony door and made a movement towards the room door, in the urge to see Joachim, but then stopped doing it and stopped at the table again, clearing his throat to test the dullness of his voice. Then he coughed. ""Yes, I must now see whether I have a cold,"" he said, and quickly put the thermometer in his mouth, the mercury tip under his tongue, so that the instrument protruded obliquely upwards between his lips, which he closed tightly around no outside air allowed. Then he checked his watch: it was six minutes past nine. And he began to wait for seven minutes to pass.","Hans Castorp bowed her out, then stood by the table, staring from the door through which she had disappeared to the instrument she had left behind. “So that,” he thought, “was Directress von Mylendonk. Settembrini doesn’t care for her, and certainly she has her unpleasant side. The stye isn’t pretty—but of course she does not have it all the time. But why does she call me ‘young ’un,’ like that? Rather rude and familiar, seems to me. So she has sold me a thermometer —I suppose she always has one or two in her pocket. They are to be had everywhere here, Joachim said, even in shops where you would least expect it. But I didn’t need to take the trouble to buy it; it just fell into my lap.” He took the article out of its case, looked at it, and walked restlessly up and down the room. His heart beat strong and rapidly. He looked toward the open balcony door, and considered seeking counsel of Joachim, but thought better of it and paused again by the table. He cleared his throat by way of testing his voice; then he coughed. “Yes,” he said. “I must see if I have the fever that goes with the cold.” Quickly he put the thermometer in his mouth, the mercury beneath the tongue, so that the instrument stuck slantingly upwards from his lips. He closed them firmly, that no air might get in. Then he looked at his wrist-watch. It was six minutes after the half-hour. And he began to wait for the seven minutes to pass.","Hans Castorp bowed as she left and stood now beside the table, staring at the door through which she had vanished—and at the apparatus she had left behind. “So that was Head Nurse von Mylendonk,” he thought. “Settembrini doesn’t like her, and there is something disagreeable about her, it’s true. The sty is not pretty, although I don’t suppose she always has one. But why does she keep saying ‘man alive,’ as if she were addressing me? It’s so odd, so slangy. And now she’s sold me a thermometer—always has a couple in her bag. They’re for sale here everywhere, in all the shops, even those you wouldn’t expect to carry them. Joachim said so. But I didn’t have to go to the trouble, it simply fell right into my lap.” He took the instrument from its case, examined it and walked restlessly with it back and forth in the room a few times. His heart was beating fast and strong. He looked out through the open door to the balcony, then moved in the direction of the hall door, with the idea of looking in on Joachim, but then gave that up and stood there again beside the table. He now cleared his throat to see just how hollow his voice sounded. He then coughed. “Yes, I do need to see if I have a little fever with my cold,” he said and quickly stuck the thermometer in his mouth, the mercury tip under his tongue, the glass tube jutting up at an angle from one corner , his lips tucked tightly around it to keep air out. Then he looked at his wristwatch—it was 9:36. And he began to wait for seven minutes to pass."
"Es war eine richtige Pause, – gelöst und von sanfter Genugtuung im Hinblick auf die schon geleistete Arbeit erfüllt. Die Zigarettenbüchsen der Herren klappten. Man rauchte mit Behagen und besprach da und dort nahe beieinander stehend den Charakter der Sitzung. Viel fehlte, daß man an diesem Charakter verzagen, eine endgültige Ergebnislosigkeit hätte ins Auge fassen müssen. Es gab Anzeichen, geeignet, solchen Kleinmut {1029}völlig hintanzuhalten. Diejenigen, die am entgegengesetzten Ende des Halbkreises, beim Doktor, gesessen hatten, stimmten darin überein, mehrmals und deutlich jenen kühlen Hauch verspürt zu haben, der regelmäßig, wenn Phänomene sich vorbereiteten, von der Person des Mediums in eine bestimmte Richtung ausgehe. Andere wollten Lichterscheinungen bemerkt haben, weiße Flecken, wandernde Ballungen von Kraft, die sich vor der spanischen Wand verschiedentlich gezeigt hätten. Kurzum, kein Nachlassen! Keine Mattherzigkeit! Holger hatte sein Wort gegeben, und man hatte kein Recht, zu zweifeln, daß er es einlösen werde.","It was a real pause, relaxed and filled with gentle satisfaction at the work already done. The gentlemen's cigarette cases banged. They smoked happily and, standing close together here and there, discussed the nature of the session. Much was lacking that one should have despaired of this character, that one should have contemplated a definitive inconclusive result. There were indications suitable to hold back such faintheartedness {1029}completely. Those who had sat at the opposite end of the semicircle, with the Doctor, agreed that they had repeatedly and distinctly felt that cool breath which regularly emanated from the medium's person in a certain direction when phenomena were in the making. Others claimed to have noticed signs of light, white patches, wandering concentrations of power that had shown themselves on various occasions in front of the screen. In short, no slacking off! No languor! Holger had given his word, and one had no right to doubt that he would keep it.","It was a beneficent pause, relaxed, and filled with peaceful satisfaction in respect of work already accomplished. The lids of cigarette-cases snapped, the men smoked comfortably, and standing in groups discussed the prospects of the seance. They were far from despairing or anticipating a negative result to their efforts. Signs enough were present to prove such doubting uncalled for. Those sitting near the doctor, at the far end of the row, agreed that they had several times felt, quite unmistakably, that current of cool air which regularly whenever manifestations were under way streamed in a definite direction from the person of the medium. Others had seen lightphenomena, white spots, moving conglobations of forces showing themselves at intervals against the screen. In short, no faint-heartedness! No looking backward now they had put their hands to the plough. Holger had given his word, they had no call to doubt that he would keep it.","It was a real intermission—everyone was relaxed and mildly satisfied with the work thus far accomplished. The gentlemen’s cigarette cases clicked. People smoked with gusto and in scattered groups discussed how the session was going. They were a long way from feeling discouraged about it, from any sense that they might have to contemplate its ending in failure. There were sufficient signs to counter all such despondency. Those who had been sitting at the far end of the semicircle, near the doctor, all agreed that several times they had clearly felt the cool draft that regularly prepared the way for any phenomena and that originated with the medium herself, always streaming in one particular direction. Others claimed to have seen little flecks of white light, shifting points of concentrated energy that had appeared repeatedly along the folding screen. In short, no giving up! No faint hearts! Holger had given his word, and they had no right to doubt he would keep it."
"Peeperkorn lag in der einen der beiden Bettstätten, Bücher, Briefe und Zeitungen auf der rotseidenen Steppdecke, und las durch seinen hochragenden Hornzwicker den »Telegraaf«. Kaffeegeschirr stand auf einem Stuhle neben ihm und eine halbgeleerte Rotweinflasche – es war der naiv Spritzige von gestern Abend – neben Medizingläsern auf dem Nachttischchen. Der Holländer trug zu Hans Castorps bescheidenem Befremden kein weißes Hemd, sondern ein wollenes mit langen Ärmeln, das an den Handgelenken geknöpft und ohne Halskragen war, rund ausgeschnitten vielmehr, den breiten Schultern und der mächtigen Brust des alten Mannes glatt anliegend: Die menschliche Großartigkeit seines Hauptes auf dem Kissen ward noch gehoben, dem Bürgerlichen entrückt durch diese Tracht, die seiner Erscheinung ein teils volkstümlich-arbeitermäßiges, teils verewigt-büstenartiges Gepräge verlieh.","Peeperkorn lay in one of the two bunks, books, letters, and newspapers on the red silk quilt, and read the Telegraaf through his towering horn pince-nez. Coffee sets stood on a chair next to him and a half-empty bottle of red wine - it was the naively sparkling one from last night - next to medicine glasses on the bedside table. The Dutchman, to Hans Castorp's modest astonishment, was not wearing a white shirt, but a long-sleeved woolen shirt, buttoned at the wrists and without a collar, rather round-necked, fitting smoothly to the old man's broad shoulders and powerful chest: The human grandeur of his The head was still raised on the pillow, removed from the bourgeois by this costume, which gave his appearance a partly folksy-worker-like, partly immortalized-bust-like character.","Pieter Peeperkorn lay in one of the two; its red satin coverlet was strewn with papers, books, and letters, and he was reading the Telegraaf through his horn-rimmed pince-nez with the high nose-piece. The coffee-machine stood on a chair at the bedside, and a half-empty bottle of the same simple effervescent red wine was on the night-table, among vials of medicine. Hans Castorp was rather put off to see the Dutchman wearing not a white night-shirt, but a long-sleeved woollen vest, buttoned at the wrists and collar-less, cut round in the neck, and clinging to the old man’s powerful torso, his broad shoulders and breast. This undress threw into even greater relief the splendid humanity of his head on the pillow; in it he looked more remote than ever from the conventional and middle-class, suggesting on the one hand the homme du peuple, on the other a portrait-bust.","Peeperkorn was lying in one of the beds, with books, letters, and newspapers strewn across a red silk quilt, and was reading the Telegraaf with the help of his high-bridged, horn-rimmed pince-nez. Next to him on a chair was a tray with coffee things and on his nightstand, amid glasses of medicine, was a half-empty bottle of wine—the simple, sparkling Swiss red of the night before. To Hans Castorp’s quiet amazement, the Dutchman was not wearing a white shin, but a woolen affair with long sleeves that buttoned at the wrists and an open, collarless neck, the smooth fabric clinging to the old man’s broad shoulders and massive chest. This outfit set the human grandeur of that head in strong relief against the pillow, in part lending it a less bourgeois, more working-class look, in part suggesting a sculptured, immortalized bust."
"Hans Castorp, den Hemdkragen knüpfend, stand mit gespreizten Beinen und Ellbogen, das Gesicht zur Decke gewandt.","Hans Castorp, knotting his shirt collar, stood with his legs and elbows apart, his face turned to the ceiling.","Hans Castorp stood, legs and elbows extended, his face turned up, buttoning his shirt-collar.","Buttoning his collar now, Hans Castorp stood there with legs and elbows spread, his face turned up to the ceiling."

"»Aus Wasser«, antwortete Behrens. »Für organische Chemie interessieren Sie sich also auch? Das ist allergrößtenteils Wasser, woraus der humanistische Menschenleib besteht, nichts Besseres und nichts Schlechteres, es ist keine Ursache, heftig zu werden. Die Trockensubstanz beträgt bloß fünfundzwanzig Prozent, und davon sind zwanzig Prozent gewöhnliches Hühnereiweiß, Proteinstoffe, wenn Sie es ein bißchen nobler ausdrücken wollen, denen eigentlich nur noch ein bißchen Fett und Salz zugesetzt ist, das ist so gut wie alles.«","""Of water,"" answered Behrens. »So you are also interested in organic chemistry? That's mostly water, what the humanistic human body is made of, nothing better and nothing worse, it's no reason to get violent. Dry matter is only twenty-five per cent, and of that twenty per cent is ordinary chicken protein, protein stuff, if you want to put it a little more poshly, with really just a little bit of fat and salt added, that's pretty much it.'","“Of water,” answered Behrens. “So you are interested in organic chemistry too? The human body consists, much the larger part of it, of water. No more and no less than water, and nothing to get wrought up about. The solid parts are only twenty-five per cent of the whole, and of that twenty are ordinary white of egg, protein, if you want to use a handsomer word. Besides that, a little fat and a little salt, that’s about all.”","“It’s made of water,” Behrens replied. “So you’re interested in organic chemistry, too, are you? The human body consists of water for the most part. Nothing better, nothing worse than water—nothing to get excited about.

That’s about all.”"
"Hans Castorp wuchs auf bei miserablem Wetter, in Wind und Wasserdunst, wuchs auf im gelben Gummimantel, wenn man so sagen darf, und fühlte sich im ganzen recht munter {50}dabei. Ein bißchen blutarm war er ja wohl von Anfang an, das sagte auch Dr. Heidekind und ließ ihm täglich zum dritten Frühstück, nach der Schule, ein gutes Glas Porter geben, – ein gehaltvolles Getränk, wie man weiß, dem Dr. Heidekind blutbildende Wirkung zuschrieb und das jedenfalls Hans Castorps Lebensgeister auf eine ihm schätzenswerte Weise besänftigte, seiner Neigung, zu »dösen«, wie sein Onkel Tienappel sich ausdrückte, nämlich mit schlaffem Munde und ohne einen festen Gedanken ins Leere zu träumen, wohltuend Vorschub leistete. Sonst aber war er gesund und richtig, ein brauchbarer Tennisspieler und Ruderer, wenn er auch lieber, statt selber die Riemen zu handhaben, an Sommerabenden bei Musik und einem guten Getränk auf der Terrasse des Uhlenhorster Fährhauses saß und die beleuchteten Boote betrachtete, zwischen denen Schwäne auf dem bunt spiegelnden Wasser dahinzogen; und wenn man ihn sprechen hörte: gelassen, verständig, ein bißchen hohl und eintönig, mit einem Anflug von Platt, ja, wenn man ihn auch nur ansah in seiner blonden Korrektheit, mit seinem gut geschnittenen, irgendwie altertümlich geprägten Kopf, in dem ein ererbter und unbewußter Dünkel sich in Gestalt einer gewissen trockenen Schläfrigkeit äußerte, so konnte kein Mensch bezweifeln, daß dieser Hans Castorp ein unverfälschtes und rechtschaffenes Erzeugnis hiesigen Bodens und glänzend an seinem Platze war, – er selbst hätte es, wenn er sich daraufhin auch nur geprüft hätte, nicht einen Augenblick lang bezweifelt.","Hans Castorp grew up in miserable weather, in wind and water vapor, grew up in a yellow rubber coat, if one may say so, and overall felt quite cheerful {50}while doing so. He was a bit anemic from the start, Dr. Heidekind and had him given a good glass of porter every day for his third breakfast after school - a hearty drink, as we know, that Dr. Heidekind attributed the blood-forming effect and which at any rate soothed Hans Castorp's spirits in a way he valued, and encouraged his tendency to ""doze"", as his uncle Tienappel put it, namely to dream into emptiness with a slack mouth and without a fixed thought. But otherwise he was healthy and fit, a useful tennis player and rower, although instead of handling the oars himself, he preferred to sit on the terrace of the Uhlenhorst ferry house with music and a good drink on summer evenings and watch the illuminated boats with swans between them floated on the colorfully reflecting water; and if you heard him speak: calm, intelligent, a bit hollow and monotonous, with a touch of Platt, yes, if you just looked at him in his blond correctness, with his well-designed, somehow archaic head, in which an inherited and unconscious conceit expressed itself in the form of a certain dry drowsiness, no one could doubt that this Hans Castorp was an unadulterated and honest product of local soil and brilliant in his place - he would have it himself, if he had only examined himself accordingly , not doubted for a moment.","So he grew up; in wretched weather, in the teeth of wind and mist, grew up, so to say, in a yellow mackintosh, and, generally speaking, he throve. A little anæmic he had always been, so Dr. Heidekind said, and had him take a good glass of porter after third breakfast every day, when he came home from school. This, as everyone knows, is a hearty drink— Dr . Heidekind considered it a blood-maker—and certainly Hans Castorp found it most soothing to his spirits and encouraging to a propensity of his, which his Uncle Tienappel called “dozing”: namely, sitting staring into space, with his jaw dropped and his thoughts fixed on just nothing at all. But on the whole he was sound and fit, an adequate tennis player and rower; though actually handling the oars was less to his taste than sitting of a summer evening on the terrace of the Uhlenhorst ferry-house, with a good drink before him and the sound of music in his ears, while he watched the lighted boats, and the swans mirrored in the bright water. Hear him talk, sedate and sensible, in a rather low, monotonous voice, just tinged with dialect; observe him in his blond correctness, with his well-shaped head, which had about it some stamp of the classic, and his self-possessed, indolent bearing, the fruit of innate, inherited, perfectly unconscious self-esteem—you would swear that this young Castorp was a legitimate and genuine product of the soil in which he flourished, and strikingly at home in his environment. Nor would he, had he ever put such a question to himself, have been for a single second doubtful of the answer.","He grew—despite miserable weather, despite wind and fog—grew up, one might say, in his yellow mackintosh, and on the whole was a quite cheerful lad. He was probably a little anemic from the start, or so Dr. Heidekind said, prescribing for him a nice daily glass of porter, to be drunk with his snack when he returned from school—a robust brew, as everyone knows, which Dr. Heidekind believed helped build the blood and which, however that might be, Hans Castorp discovered, much to his satisfaction, had a calming effect on his spirits and pleasantly assisted him in his proclivity to “doze”—as his Uncle Tienappel put it—when he would sit with his mouth slightly open, dreaming away without a single firm thought in his head. But otherwise he was a regular, healthy lad, a passable tennis-player and oarsman, although on summer evenings, instead of manning an oar, he preferred sitting on the terrace of the Uhlenhorst Boathouse, a refreshing drink in hand, listening to music and watching the boats as they drifted among the swans, their lights reflected in the bright, smooth water. And if you were to hear him talking—in his nonchalant, reasonable way, his voice a little hollow and monotone, with just a hint of Platt—or even if you just saw him there, so blondly correct, his hair nicely trimmed, his head with the stamp of something classic about it, his air cool and languid, suggesting an inherited, unconscious arrogance, then you could not doubt that this Hans Castorp was an honest, unadulterated product of the local soil, superbly at home in it—even he himself, had he ever actually considered the matter, would not have doubted it for a moment."

"{764}Auch ihre Besuche bei Settembrini und Naphta sowie die Spaziergänge mit diesen beiden feindlich Verbundenen nahmen sie wieder auf, und wenn A. K. Ferge und Ferdinand Wehsal sich beteiligten, was öfters geschah, so waren sie zu sechsen, und jene Widersacher im Geiste lieferten ihre unaufhörlichen Duelle, bei deren Vorführung wir irgendwelche Vollständigkeit nicht anstreben könnten, ohne uns ebenso ins Desperat-Unendliche zu verlieren, wie sie es täglich taten, vor einem stattlichen Publikum, wenn auch Hans Castorp seine arme Seele als Hauptgegenstand ihres dialektischen Wettstreites betrachten wollte. Von Naphta hatte er erfahren, daß Settembrini Freimaurer sei, – was keinen geringeren Eindruck auf ihn gemacht hatte als des Italieners Eröffnung über Naphtas jesuitische Herkunft und Versorgtheit. Wiederum war er phantastisch überrascht gewesen, zu hören, daß es im Ernst noch dergleichen gäbe und hatte den Terroristen mit Fleiß über den Ursprung und das Wesen dieser kuriosen Einrichtung ausgeholt, die in einigen Jahren ihr zweihundertjähriges Jubiläum würde begehen können. Wenn Settembrini über Naphtas geistiges Wesen hinter seinem Rücken, im Tone pathetischer Warnung und als von etwas Teuflischem sprach, so machte sich Naphta, hinter dem des anderen, über die Sphäre, die dieser vertrat, ohne Anstrengung lustig, indem er zu verstehen gab, daß es sich da um etwas recht Altmodisches und Rückständiges handle: um bürgerliche Aufklärung und eine Freigeisterei von vorgestern, welche nichts weiter sei, als armseliger Geisterspuk, sich aber der skurrilen Selbsttäuschung hingebe, noch immer revolutionären Lebens voll zu sein. Er sagte: »Was wollen Sie, schon sein Großvater war Carbonaro, zu deutsch also Köhler.

Man muß zugeben, daß dieses Mißverhältnis ausreichen würde, jede Interesselosigkeit des Geistes am Wirklichen zu entschuldigen, denn die Regel ist, daß die Fermente, die die Revolutionen der Wirklichkeit herbeiführen, ihm längst zum Ekel geworden sind. Tatsächlich ist toter Geist dem lebendigen widerwärtiger als irgendwelche Basalte, die wenigstens nicht den Anspruch erheben, Geist und Leben zu sein. Solche Basalte, Reste ehemaliger Wirklichkeiten, die der Geist so weit hinter sich gelassen hat, daß er sich weigert, den Begriff des Wirklichen überhaupt noch damit zu verbinden, erhalten sich träge fort und bewahren durch ihren plumpen und toten Fortbestand das Abgeschmackte leidigerweise davor, seiner Abgeschmacktheit inne zu werden. Ich spreche allgemein, aber Sie werden die Nutzanwendung auf jenen humanitären Freisinn zu ziehen wissen, der glaubt, sich gegen Herrschaft und Autorität noch immer in heroischem Stande zu befinden. Ach, und nun gar die Katastrophen, vermittelst deren er sich sein Leben beweisen möchte, die verspäteten und spektakulösen Triumphe, die er vorbereitet und die er eines Tages zu feiern träumt! Beim bloßen Gedanken daran könnte der lebendige Geist sich zu Tode langweilen, wüßte er nicht, daß in Wahrheit doch nur er aus solchen Katastrophen als Sieger und Nutznießer hervorgehen wird, – er, der Elemente des Alten in sich mit Zukünftigstem zu wahrer Revolution verschmilzt … Wie geht es Ihrem Vetter, Hans Castorp? Sie wissen, daß ich ihm viel Sympathie entgegenbringe.«","{764}They also resumed their visits to Settembrini and Naphta and their walks with these two hostile allies, and when AK Ferge and Ferdinand Wehsal took part, which often happened, there were six of them, and those adversaries in spirit delivered theirs incessant duels, in the performance of which we could not strive for any completeness without losing ourselves in the desperate infinity as they did every day before a stately audience, even if Hans Castorp wanted to regard his poor soul as the main object of their dialectic contest. He had learned from Naphta that Settembrini was a Freemason - which had made no less of an impression on him than the Italian's disclosure about Naphta's Jesuit origins and care. Again, he had been fantastically surprised to hear that there were other serious things like this, and had diligently teased the terrorist about the origin and nature of this curious institution, which in a few years would be celebrating its bicentenary. When Settembrini spoke of Naphta's spiritual nature behind his back, in a tone of pathetic warning and as something diabolical, Naphta, behind that of the other, made fun of the sphere he represented without effort, implying that it is about something really old-fashioned and backward: about bourgeois enlightenment and a free spirit from the day before yesterday, which is nothing more than pathetic ghostly spook but indulges in the bizarre self-deception of still being full of revolutionary life. He said: ""What do you want, his grandfather was already Carbonaro, which means Köhler in German. From him he got the Köhler belief in reason, freedom, human progress and that whole mothball of classicist-bourgeois virtue ideology... You see, what confuses the world is the disproportion between the speed of the spirit and the enormous clumsiness , slowness, inertia and inertia of matter. It must be admitted that this disparity would be enough to excuse any lack of interest in the mind for the real, for the rule is that the ferments which bring about the revolutions of reality have long since become disgusting to it. In fact, dead spirit is more repugnant to the living than any basalt, which at least does not claim to be spirit and life. Such basalts, remnants of former realities, which the spirit has left so far behind that it refuses to connect the concept of the real with it at all, persist sluggishly and, through their clumsy and dead persistence, unfortunately protect the absurd from being his to become aware of insipidity. I am speaking in general terms, but you will find the application to that humanitarian free spirit who thinks he is still heroic in the face of domination and authority. Oh, and now even the catastrophes by which he would like to prove his life to himself, the belated and spectacular triumphs which he is preparing and which he dreams of one day celebrating! The mere thought of it could bore the living spirit to death if it didn't know that in truth it is the only one who will emerge from such catastrophes as the victor and beneficiary - he who fuses elements of the old with what is most future to true revolution... How is your cousin, Hans Castorp? You know I have a great deal of sympathy for him.”","The cousins resumed their visits to Settembrini and Naphta and their walks with those two devoted opponents. When they were joined by A. K. Ferge and Wehsal, which often happened, they formed a group of six, and before this considerable audience the two opposed spirits carried on an endless duel, which we could not reproduce in any fullness without losing ourselves, as it did daily, in an infinitude of despair. Hans Castorp chose to regard his own poor soul as the object of their dialectic rivalry. He had learned from Naphta that Settembrini was a Freemason, which fact impressed him as much as Settembrini’s earlier statement that Naphta was a Jesuit. He was quite absurdly surprised to hear that there still existed such things as Freemasons; and diligently plied the terrorist with questions about the origin and significance of this curious body, which in a few years would celebrate its two-hundredth birthday. When Settembrini spoke behind his back of Naphta and his intellectual tendencies, it was always on an appealing note of warning, with a hint that the subject had more than a little of the diabolic about it. But when Naphta did the same, he made unaffectedly merry over the sphere which the other represented, and gave Hans Castorp to understand that the things for which Settembrini fought were all of them dead issues; free-thought and bourgeois enlightenment were the pathetic delusions of yesterday, though prone to the self-deception which made them a laughing-stock: namely, that they were still full of revolutionary life. Said Naphta: “Dear me, his grandfather was a carbonaro— in other words a charcoal-burner. From him he gets the charcoal-burner’s faith in reason, freedom, human progress, the whole box of tricks belonging to the classicistic-humanistic virtue-ideology. You see, what perplexes the world is the disparity between the swiftness of the spirit, and the immense unwieldiness, sluggishness, inertia, permanence of matter. We must admit that this disparity would be enough to excuse the spirit’s lack of interest in reality, for the rule is that it has sickened long before of the ferments that bring revolution in their train. In very truth, dead spirit is more repulsive to the living than dead matter, than granite for example, which makes no claim to be alive. Such granite, the relic of an ancient reality left so far behind by the spirit that it refuses any longer to associate with it the conception of reality, continues a sluggish existence, and by its bald and dull continuance prevents futility from becoming aware that it is futile. I am speaking in general terms, but you will know how to apply my words to that humanistic freethought which imagines itself to be still in a heroic attitude of resistance to authority and domination. Ah, and the catastrophes, by virtue of which it thinks to manifest its vitality, the ever-delayed spectacular triumphs at which it is preparing to assist, and thinks one day to celebrate! The living spirit would die of ennui at the bare thought of these, were it not aware that from such catastrophes it alone can emerge as the victor, welding as it does the elements of the old and the new to create the true revolution.— How is your cousin to-day, Hans Castorp? You know what profound sympathy I feel for him.”","And they resumed their visits to Settembrini and Naphta, as well as walks with those two antagonistic allies; when they were joined by A. K. Ferge and Ferdinand Wehsal, which frequently happened, that made a party of four before which the two intellectual adversaries could engage in constant duels—and we could not hope to present them in their entirety without fear of likewise losing ourselves in the same desperate infinitude into which they daily threw themselves for their large audience, although Hans Castorp chose to see his own poor soul as the chief object of their dialectic rivalry. He had learned from Naphta that Settembrini was a Freemason—which made no less an impression on him than had the Italian’s revelation of Naphta’s Jesuit origins and patronage. He had been flabbergasted to hear that there really and truly was such a thing; and he had diligently sounded the terrorist out on the beginnings and character of this curious institution, which in a few years would celebrate its two-hundredth anniversary. And whereas Settembrini had spoken behind Naphta’s back in tones of pathos-laden admonition about the Jesuit, as if he were somehow diabolic, Naphta made unperturbed fun of the other man and the sphere he came from, suggesting that the whole thing was terribly old-fashioned and backward, an attempt at bourgeois enlightenment perpetrated by yesterday’s freethinkers, when in fact it was nothing more than a wretched intellectual mirage, which its self-deluded adherents ludicrously believed was full of revolutionary life. “What do you expect?” Naphta said. “His grandfather was a Carbonaro, which means charcoal-burner, by the way. From him he got his charcoal-burner’s faith in reason, freedom, human progress, and the whole moth-eaten classicistic-bourgeois ideology of virtue. You see, what confuses the world is the incongruity between the swift flight of the mind and matter’s vast clumsy slowness, its dogged persistence and inertia. One must admit such an incongruity would suffice to excuse the mind’s lack of interest in reality, because as a rule the mind is disgusted by reality’s ferment long before it erupts in revolution. Indeed, to a lively mind, a dead intellect is more abhorrent than basalt, which at least does not make any claims to life and thought. Rocks like basalt, remnants of former realities, which the Spirit has left so far behind that it refuses even to associate the notion of reality with them, persist in their dogged way; their very lumpish, dead continuance unfortunately prevents them in their inanity from realizing how inane they are. I am speaking in generalities, but you will know how to apply my words to those humanitarian freethinkers, who believe themselves to be heroes still standing up against authority and domination. Ah, and the catastrophes by which free thought hopes to prove its own vitality—ah, those latter-day, spectacular triumphs for which it prepares itself and which it dreams of someday celebrating! The mere idea would be enough to bore the living Spirit to death, if it did not know that it shall emerge from such catastrophes as the true victor and beneficiary—fusing, as it does, elements of the old with the new to create an authentic revolution. . . . And how is your cousin doing, Hans Castorp? You know I’ve always had a great liking for him.”"
"Dann stellte der Großvater das Gefäß auf den Teller zurück und ließ den Kleinen in die glatte, leicht goldige Höhlung sehen, die aufschimmerte von dem einfallenden Oberlicht.","Then the grandfather put the vessel back on the plate and let the little one look into the smooth, slightly golden cavity, which shimmered in the light from the skylight.","Grandfather set the vessel back on the tray, and let the boy look into the smooth, faintly golden inside, which caught the light from the window in the ceiling.","Then his grandfather would put the basin back on its tray and let the boy look into its smooth, soft golden hollow, which began to shimmer as it caught the light falling from above."

"»Vortrefflich!« rief Peeperkorn, indem er sich gegen die Stuhllehne zurückwarf und den Arm gegen die Zwergin ausstreckte. Er rief es mit einer Betonung, als wollte er sagen: Aber was wollen Sie denn? Alles steht wundervoll! – »Mein Kind,« fuhr er aufs ernsteste und fast mit Strenge fort, »– das übertrifft alle meine Erwartungen. Emerentia – Sie sprechen es mit Bescheidenheit aus, aber der Name – und in Verbindung mit Ihrer Person – kurzum, das eröffnet die schönsten Möglichkeiten. Er ist wohl wert, daß man ihm nachhängt und alles Gefühl seiner Brust daransetzt, um – in der Koseform – Sie verstehen mich wohl, mein Kind: in der Koseform – möge es Rentia heißen, aber auch Emchen wäre erwärmend, – für den Augenblick halte {834}ich es ohne Schwanken mit Emchen. Emchen also, mein Kind, merke auf: Ein wenig Brot, meine Liebe. Halt! Steh! Daß ja kein Mißverständnis sich einschleiche! Ich sehe es deinem verhältnismäßig großen Gesichte an, daß diese Gefahr – Brot, Renzchen, aber nicht gebackenes Brot, – wir haben hier davon die Fülle, in allerlei Gestalt. Sondern gebranntes, mein Engel. Gottesbrot, klares Brot, kleine Koseform, und zwar der Labung wegen. Ich bin ungewiß, ob Ihnen der Sinn dieses Wortes – ich würde vorschlagen, ›Herzstärkung‹ dafür einzusetzen, liefe hier nicht die neue Gefahr mit unter, es im Sinne gebräuchlicher Leichtfertigkeit – Er–ledigt, Rentia. Erledigt und ausgeschlossen. Vielmehr im Sinn unserer Pflicht und heiligen Verbindlichkeit – Zum Beispiel also der mir obliegenden Ehrenschuld, mich deiner charakteristischen Kleinheit so recht starken Herzens – Einen Genever, Geliebte! – Zu erfreuen, wollte ich sagen. Schiedamer, Emerenzchen. Eile und bringe mir einen!«","""Excellent!"" cried Peeperkorn, throwing himself back against the back of the chair and stretching out his arm towards the dwarf. He called it with an emphasis, as if to say: But what do you want? Everything is wonderful! - ""My child,"" he continued in the most serious and almost severe manner, ""- that surpasses all my expectations. Emerentia - you say it with modesty, but the name - and in connection with your person - in short, that opens up the most beautiful possibilities. He is well worth hanging after him and putting all your heart and soul into it, in order to - in the pet form - You understand me well, my child: in the pet form - may it be called Rentia, but Emchen would also be warming - hold for the moment {834}I do it without hesitation with Emchen. Emchen therefore, my child, pay attention: A little bread, my dear. Stop! stand! So that no misunderstanding creeps in! I can see from your relatively large face that this danger - bread, Renzchen, but not baked bread - we have plenty of it here, in all kinds of forms. But burnt, my angel. God's bread, clear bread, small pet form, and that's because of the refreshment. I'm not sure if you understand the meaning of that word - I'd suggest putting 'heart strengthening' in for it, were it not for the new danger involved here, using it in the sense of customary frivolity - Done, Rentia. Done and ruled out. Rather in the sense of our duty and sacred obligation - For example, the honorable debt incumbent on me, your characteristic smallness with a really strong heart - A genever, beloved! - To please, I wanted to say. Schiedamer, Emerenzchen. Hurry and bring me one!'","“Splendid,” cried Peeperkorn, throwing himself back in his chair and stretching out his arm toward her. He cried it in the tone of one who would say “Wonderful! Is not everything wonderful?”—“My child,” he went on, with a perfectly serious face, almost sternly, “you surpass all my expectations. Emerentia! You utter it so modestly—yet, taken with your person, it holds out such boundless possibilities. Beautiful. Worth dwelling upon, communing with in the depths of one’s—in order to—understand me, my child: as a term of endearment—the pet name. It might be Rentia. Though Emchen would equally warm and fortify the heart—in short, for the moment, I will abide by Emchen. Emchen, then, ‘Emchen my child, attend. A little bread, my love. But hold! Let no misunderstanding come between us—for in your somewhat over life-size face I seem to read—bread, Renzchen, bread; yet not baker’s bread, of which in this place we have enough and to spare, in all conceivable forms. Not corn that is baked, my angel, but corn that is burnt—in other words, distilled. Bread of God, bread of sunshine, little pet name; bread for the laving of man’s weary spirit. But I still have misgivings—whether the sense of this word I would even consider substituting for it another, the beautiful word cordial—if here we did not encounter a new danger, that it might be understood in the ordinary thoughtless sense— No more, Rentia. Settled. Set—tled, and out of the question. Rather would I, in consideration of the debt of honour I acknowledge, right cordially to rejoice your characteristic smallness—a gin, love, and haste thee. A Schiedamer, Emerentia. Bring me one hither.”","“Splendid!” Peeperkorn cried, throwing himself against the back of his chair and stretching one arm out to the dwarf. The tone of his cry seemed to say, “Well, who could object to that! It’s all so wonderful!”—“My child,” he continued now in an earnest, almost stern voice, “that exceeds my every expectation. Emerentia—you pronounce it with modesty, but the name—and taken together with your person—in short, it reveals the loveliest possibilities. ‘ Tis well worth musing upon, giving rein to all the emotions that well up in one’s chest, so that one may—but as a nickname, you must understand, my child, as a nickname—it might be Rentia, or even Emchen would cheer the heart—but for the moment I shall without hesitation hold fast to Emchen. So then, Emchen my child, listen well: a little bread, my dear. Wait! Stay! Let there be no misunderstanding. I can read from your relatively broad face that there is the danger of—bread, Renzchen, but not baked bread, of that we have a sufficiency, in all shapes and sizes. Not baked, but distilled, my angel. The bread of God, clear as crystal, my little Nickname, that we may be regaled. I am uncertain whether what I intend by using that term—I might suggest ‘a cordial for the heart’ as an alternative, if that term did not likewise run the danger of being taken in a more common, thoughtless sense—but that set-tles it, Rentia. Settles it, over and done! Or rather, in light of our duty, our holy obligation—for example, the debt of honor incumbent upon me to turn with a most cordial heart to you, so small but full of character—a gin, my love! To gladden my heart, might I say. A gin, a Schiedam gin, my Emerenzchen. Make haste to bring it to me.”"
"»Ja, Zeit«, sagte Joachim und nickte mehrmals geradeaus, ohne sich um des Vetters ehrliche Entrüstung zu kümmern. »Die springen hier um mit der menschlichen Zeit, das glaubst du gar nicht. Drei Wochen sind wie ein Tag vor ihnen. Du wirst schon sehen. Du wirst das alles schon lernen«, sagte er und setzte hinzu: »Man ändert hier seine Begriffe.«","""Yes, it's about time,"" said Joachim, and nodded straight ahead several times, ignoring his cousin's honest indignation. »They jump around here with human time, you wouldn't believe that. Three weeks is like a day before you. You will see. You'll learn all that,' he said, adding, 'You're changing your terms here.'","“Oh, time—!” said Joachim, and nodded repeatedly, straight in front of him, paying his cousin’s honest indignation no heed. “They make pretty free with a human being’s idea of time, up here. You wouldn’t believe it. Three weeks are just like a day to them. You’ll learn all about it,” he said, and added: “One’s ideas get changed.”","“Ah yes, time,” Joachim said, nodding to himself several times, paying no attention to his cousin’s honest indignation. “You wouldn’t believe how fast and loose they play with people’s time around here. Three weeks are the same as a day to them. You’ll see. You have all that to learn,” he said, and then he added, “A man changes a lot of his ideas here.”"

"Es war eine Dame, die da durch den Saal ging, eine Frau, ein junges Mädchen wohl eher, nur mittelgroß, in weißem Sweater und farbigem Rock, mit rötlichblondem Haar, das sie einfach in Zöpfen um den Kopf gelegt trug. Hans Castorp sah nur wenig von ihrem Profil, fast gar nichts. Sie ging ohne Laut, was zu dem Lärm ihres Eintritts in wunderlichem Gegensatz stand, ging eigentümlich schleichend und etwas vorgeschobenen Kopfes zum äußersten Tische links, der senkrecht zur Verandatür stand, dem »Guten Russentisch« nämlich, wobei sie die {119}eine Hand in der Tasche der anliegenden Wolljacke hielt, die andere aber, das Haar stützend und ordnend, zum Hinterkopf führte. Hans Castorp blickte auf diese Hand, – er hatte viel Sinn und kritische Aufmerksamkeit für Hände und war gewöhnt, auf diesen Körperteil zuerst, wenn er neue Bekanntschaften machte, sein Augenmerk zu richten. Sie war nicht sonderlich damenhaft, die Hand, die das Haar stützte, nicht so gepflegt und veredelt, wie Frauenhände in des jungen Hans Castorp gesellschaftlicher Sphäre zu sein pflegten. Ziemlich breit und kurzfingrig, hatte sie etwas Primitives und Kindliches, etwas von der Hand eines Schulmädchens; ihre Nägel wußten offenbar nichts von Maniküre, sie waren schlecht und recht beschnitten, ebenfalls wie bei einem Schulmädchen, und an ihren Seiten schien die Haut etwas aufgerauht, fast so, als werde hier das kleine Laster des Fingerkauens gepflegt. Übrigens erkannte Hans Castorp dies eher ahnungsweise, als daß er es eigentlich gesehen hätte, – die Entfernung war doch zu bedeutend. Mit einem Kopfnicken begrüßte die Nachzüglerin ihre Tischgesellschaft, und indem sie sich setzte, an die Innenseite des Tisches, den Rücken gegen den Saal, zur Seite Dr. Krokowskis, der dort den Vorsitz hatte, wandte sie, noch immer die Hand am Haar, den Kopf über die Schulter und überblickte das Publikum, – wobei Hans Castorp flüchtig bemerkte, daß sie breite Backenknochen und schmale Augen hatte … Eine vage Erinnerung an irgendetwas und irgendwen berührte ihn leicht und vorübergehend, als er das sah …","It was a lady who was walking through the hall, a woman, probably a young girl, only medium-sized, in a white sweater and colored skirt, with reddish-blond hair that she wore in a simple braid around her head. Hans Castorp saw little of her profile, almost nothing at all. She walked silently, which was a strange contrast to the noise of her entrance, walked strangely slowly and with her head pushed forward to the extreme table on the left, which stood perpendicularly to the patio door, namely the ""Good Russian Table"", where she held one hand in held in the pocket of the woolen jacket that was attached, but led the other to the back of the head, supporting and arranging the hair. Hans Castorp looked at that hand - he had a great deal of sense and critical attention to hands and was accustomed to paying attention to that part of the body first when making new acquaintances. It was not particularly ladylike, the hand that supported the hair not as cultivated and ennobled as women's hands were in the habit of being in young Hans Castorp's social sphere. Rather broad and short-fingered, she had something primitive and childlike, something of a schoolgirl's hand; her nails obviously knew nothing about manicures, they were trimmed badly and properly, also like a schoolgirl's, and the skin on their sides seemed a little rough, almost as if the little vice of finger-biting was cultivated here. Incidentally, Hans Castorp recognized this more vaguely than he actually saw it - the distance was too great. With a nod of her head, the latecomer greeted her companions at the table, and as she sat down, on the inside of the table, her back against the hall, to the side of Dr. Krokowskis, who was presiding there, she turned her head over her shoulder, her hand still to her hair, and surveyed the audience - with Hans Castorp glimpsing that she had broad cheekbones and narrow eyes... A vague recollection of something and someone touched him lightly and momentarily as he saw this...","It was a lady who was passing through the room; a woman, or rather girl, of middle height, in a white sweater and coloured skirt, her reddish-blond hair wound in braids about her head. Hans Castorp had only a glimpse of her profile. She moved, in singular contrast to the noise of her entrance, almost without sound, passing with a peculiarly gliding step, her head a little thrust forward, to her place at the furthest table on the left, at right angles to the verandah door: the “good” Russian table, in fact. As she walked, she held one hand deep in the pocket of her close-fitting jacket; the other she lifted to the back of her head and arranged the plaits of her hair. Hans Castorp looked at the hand. He was habitually observant and critical of this feature, and accustomed when he made a new acquaintance to direct his attention first upon it. It was not particularly ladylike, this hand that was putting the braids to rights; not so refined and well kept as the hands of ladies in Hans Castorp’s own social sphere. Rather broad, with stumpy fingers, it had about it something primitive and childish, something indeed of the schoolgirl. The nails, it was plain, knew nothing of the manicurist’s art; they were cut in rough-and-ready schoolgirl fashion, and the skin at the side looked almost as though someone were subject to the childish vice of finger biting. But Hans Castorp sensed rather than saw this, owing to the distance. The laggard greeted her table-mates with a nod, and took her place on the inner side of the table with her back to the room, next to Dr. Krokowski, who was sitting at the top. As she did so, she turned her head, with the hand still raised to it, toward the dining-room and surveyed the public; Hans Castorp had opportunity for the fleeting observation that her cheek-bones were broad and her eyes narrow.—A vague memory of something, of somebody, stirred him slightly and fleetingly as he looked.","It was a lady who crossed the hall now, a young woman, a girl really, of only average height, in a white sweater and brightly colored skirt, with reddish-blond hair, which she wore in a simple braid wound up on her head. Hans Castorp saw only a little of her profile—almost nothing, in fact. In quite marvelous contrast to her noisy entrance, she walked soundlessly, with a peculiar slinking gait, her head thrust slightly forward, and proceeded to the farthest table on the left, set perpendicular to the veranda doors—the Good Russian table. As she walked she kept one hand in the pocket of her close-fitting wool jacket, while the other was busy at the back of her head, tucking and arranging her hair. Hans Castorp looked at that hand—he had a good eye and a fine critical sense for hands, and it was his habit always first to direct his gaze at them whenever he made a new acquaintance. The hand tucking up her hair was not particularly ladylike, not refined or well cared for, not in the way the ladies in young Hans Castorp’s social circle cared for theirs. It was rather broad, with stubby fingers; there was something primitive and childish about it, rather like the hand of a schoolgirl. Her nails had clearly never seen a manicure, and had been trimmed carelessly—again, like a schoolgirl’s; and the cuticles had a jagged look, almost as if she were guilty of the minor vice of nail-chewing. Hans Castorp only surmised all this, however, more than he actually saw it—she was really too far away. Her tablemates greeted the latecomer with nods; as she took her seat on the near side of the table—her back to the room and right beside Dr. Krokowski, who was presiding—she turned, her hand still at her hair, and looked back over her shoulder at the assembly. And Hans Castorp caught a fleeting glance of her broad cheekbones and narrow eyes—and at the sight, a vague memory of something or somebody brushed over him."
"Das traf zu. Schon beim ersten Frühstück am Faschingsdienstag, der sofort da war, ehe man ihn von weitem nur recht ins Auge gefaßt, – schon in der Frühe gab es im Speisesaal allerlei Töne aus scherzhaften Blasinstrumenten, schnarrend und tutend; beim Mittagessen flogen vom Tische Gänsers, Rasmussens und der Kleefeld bereits Papierschlangen, und mehrere Personen, zum Beispiel die rundäugige Marusja, trugen papierne Kopfbedeckungen, die ebenfalls bei dem Hinkenden vorn in der Loge zu kaufen waren; aber abends entfaltete sich im Saal und in den Konversationsräumen eine Festgeselligkeit, die in ihrem Verlauf … Nur wir wissen vorderhand, wozu, dank Hans Castorps Unternehmungsgeist, diese Fastnachtsgeselligkeit in ihrem Verlaufe führte. Aber wir lassen uns durch unser Wissen nicht hin- und nicht aus unserer Bedächtigkeit reißen, sondern geben der Zeit die Ehre, die ihr gebührt, und überstürzen nichts, – vielleicht sogar zögern wir die Ereignisse hin, weil wir die sittliche Scheu des jungen Hans Castorp teilen, die den Eintritt dieser Ereignisse so lange hintangehalten hatte.","That was true. Already at the first breakfast on Shrove Tuesday, which was there before you even caught sight of it from afar - early in the morning there were all sorts of joking wind instruments in the dining room, buzzing and tooting; at lunch streams of paper were already flying from the table of Gänsers, Rasmussens and Kleefeld, and several people, for example the round-eyed Marusja, wore paper headgear, which could also be bought from the limping man in the front of the box; but in the evening a festive sociability unfolded in the hall and in the conversation rooms, which in its course ... Only we know for the time being what, thanks to Hans Castorp's enterprising spirit, this carnival sociability led to in its course. But we don't allow ourselves to be swept away by our knowledge or from our deliberation, but give the time the honor it deserves and don't rush anything - perhaps we even delay events because we see the moral shyness of young Hans Castorp share that had delayed the occurrence of these events for so long.","And so it fell out. Shrove Tuesday came on apace; before one had actually seen it on the way, it arrived. All sorts of absurd instruments were snarling and squealing in the dining-hall, even at early breakfast; at midday, paper snakes were launched from the table where Gänser, Rasmussen, and Fräulein Kleefeld sat. Paper caps were mounted; they, like the trumpets, were to be had of the concierge. The round-eyed Marusja was among the first to appear in one. But in the evening—ah, in the evening there were festivities in the hall and the reception-rooms, in the course of which—but we alone know to what, thanks to Hans Castorp’s enterprising spirit, these carnival gaieties led up in their course; and we do not mean to let our knowledge betray us into indiscretion. We shall pay time all the honour due it, and precipitate nothing. Nay, rather, we shall incline to protract the tale, out of feeling for young Hans Castorp’s moral compunctions, which have so long prevented him from crossing his Rubicon.","It was indeed. Already at breakfast on Mardi Gras morning—which was there before you had even got a good bead on it—already at breakfast, the dining hall was filled with the rattling and tootling of all sorts of toy instruments. By noon, streamers were already flying at the table where Gänser, Rasmussen, and Kleefeld sat, and several people—round-eyed Marusya for instance—were wearing paper hats, which were also on sale at the limping concierge’s desk in the lobby. And by evening both in the dining hall and the social rooms the festivities continued to grow until at one point . . . At this juncture we alone know to what these carnival festivities eventually led, thanks to Hans Castorp’s enterprising spirit. But we are not about to let our knowledge of what happened disrupt the deliberate pace of our narrative; instead, we shall give time the honor it is due and not rush into things—perhaps we shall even draw these events out a bit, for we share with young Hans Castorp the same moral scruples that for so long had kept him from precipitating such events."
"{245}Was ist der Mensch, wie leicht betrügt sich doch sein Gewissen! Wie versteht er es, noch aus der Stimme der Pflicht die Erlaubnis zur Leidenschaft herauszuhören! Aus Pflichtgefühl, um der Billigkeit, des Gleichgewichts willen hörte Hans Castorp Herrn Settembrini zu und prüfte wohlmeinend seine Aspekten über die Vernunft, die Republik und den schönen Stil, bereit, sich davon beeinflussen zu lassen. Desto statthafter aber fand er es hinterdrein, seinen Gedanken und Träumen wieder in anderer, in entgegengesetzter Richtung freien Lauf zu lassen, – ja, um unseren ganzen Verdacht oder unsere ganze Einsicht auszusprechen, so hatte er wohl gar Herrn Settembrini nur zu dem Zwecke gelauscht, von seinem Gewissen einen Freibrief zu erlangen, den es ihm ursprünglich nicht hatte ausfertigen wollen. Was oder wer aber befand sich auf dieser anderen, dem Patriotismus, der Menschenwürde und der schönen Literatur entgegengesetzten Seite, wohin Hans Castorp sein Sinnen und Betreiben nun wieder lenken zu dürfen glaubte? Dort befand sich … Clawdia Chauchat, – schlaff, wurmstichig und kirgisenäugig; und indem Hans Castorp ihrer gedachte (übrigens ist »gedenken« ein allzu gezügelter Ausdruck für seine Art, sich ihr innerlich zuzuwenden), war es ihm wieder, als säße er im Kahn auf jenem holsteinischen See und blicke aus der glasigen Tageshelle des westlichen Ufers vexierten und geblendeten Auges hinüber in die nebeldurchsponnene Mondnacht der östlichen Himmel.","{245}What is man, how easily his conscience is deceived! How well he understands how to hear permission for passion even in the voice of duty! Out of a sense of duty, for the sake of equity, for the sake of balance, Hans Castorp listened to Mr. Settembrini and sympathetically examined his aspects of reason, the Republic and beautiful style, ready to be influenced by them. But afterwards he found it all the more permissible to let his thoughts and dreams run free in the opposite direction - yes, in order to express our entire suspicion or our entire insight, he had probably only listened to Mr. Settembrini for the purpose of to obtain a license from his conscience, which he had originally not wanted to give him. But what or who was on this other side, the opposite of patriotism, human dignity and fine literature, to which Hans Castorp now believed he could direct his thoughts and activities again? There was... Clawdia Chauchat, - limp, wormy, and Kyrgyz-eyed; and while Hans Castorp was thinking of her (by the way, ""commemorate"" is an all too restrained expression for his way of turning to her inwardly), he again felt as if he were sitting in a boat on that Holstein lake and looking out of the glassy daylight of the western shore in a puzzled way and blinded eyes across into the mist-spun moonlit night of the eastern heavens.","What a creature is man, how widely his conscience betrays him! How easy it is for him to think he hears, even in the voice of duty, a licence to passion! Hans Castorp listened to Herr Settembrini out of a sense of duty and fairness, in the idea of hearing both sides; with the best of intentions he tested the latter’s views on the subject of the republic, reason and the bello stile. He was entirely receptive. And all the while he was finding it more and more permissible to give his thoughts and dreams free rein in another and quite opposite direction. Indeed, to give expression to all that we suspect or divine, we think it not unlikely that Hans Castorp hearkened to Herr Settembrini’s discourse in order to get from his own conscience an indulgence which otherwise might not have been forthcoming. But what—or who—was it that drew down the other side of the scales, when weighed over against patriotism, belles-lettres, and the dignity of man? It was—Clavdia Chauchat, “Kirghiz”-eyed, “relaxed,” and tainted within; when he thought of her (though thinking is far too tame a word to characterize the impulse that turned all his being in her direction), it was as though he were sitting again in his boat on the lake in Holstein, looking with dazzled eyes from the glassy daylight of the western shore to the mist and moonbeams that wrapped the eastern heavens.","What a piece of work is a man, and how easily conscience betrays him. He listens to the voice of duty—and what he hears is the license of passion. And out of a sense of duty to be fair and balanced, Hans Castorp listened to Herr Settembrini. With the best of intentions he tested the man’s views on reason, the world republic, and beautiful style—and was prepared to be influenced by them. And each time, he found it all the more permissible afterward to let his thoughts and dreams run free in another direction, in the opposite direction. To put our suspicions and true understanding of the matter into words—he had probably listened to Herr Settembrini for one purpose only: to be given carte blanche by his conscience, a license it had been unwilling to grant him at first. And what or who stood on the opposing side of patriotism, the dignity of man, and beautiful literature—the side toward which Hans Castorp believed he should direct his thoughts and deeds? There stood . . . Clavdia Chauchat—listless, worm-eaten, Kirghiz-eyed; and whenever Hans Castorp thought of her (although “thought” is an all-too-inhibited word for describing how he turned inwardly toward her), it seemed to him that he was sitting again in that boat on the lake in Holstein and gazing with dazzled and bewildered eyes out of glassy daylight across to the eastern sky and the moonlit night draped in a web of mist."
"»Erstens,« erwiderte Hans Castorp und teilte seine Rede nun sogar in erstens und zweitens ein, »verstehe ich nicht, warum man mit harmlosem Fieber – ich will einmal annehmen, daß es so etwas gibt – mit harmlosem Fieber das Bett hüten muß, mit anderem aber nicht. Und zweitens sage ich dir ja, daß der Schnupfen mich nicht heißer gemacht hat, als ich schon vorher war. Ich stehe auf dem Standpunkt,« schloß er, »daß 37,6 gleich 37,6 ist. Könnt ihr damit herumlaufen, kann ich es auch.«","""Firstly,"" replied Hans Castorp, now even dividing his speech into first and second, ""I don't understand why one has to stay in bed with a harmless fever - I'll assume that there is such a thing - with a harmless fever, with but not others. And secondly, I'm telling you that the cold hasn't made me any hotter than I was before. I am of the opinion,' he concluded, 'that 37.6 equals 37.6. If you can walk around in it, so can I.”","“In the first place,” said Hans Castorp, speaking with dignity and dividing his remarks into categories, “I cannot comprehend why, with a harmless fever—assuming for the moment, that there is such a thing—one must keep one’s bed, while with one that is not harmless you needn’t. And secondly, I tell you the fever has not made me hotter than I was before. My position is that 99.6 ° is 99.6°. If you can run about with it, so can I.”","“First,” Hans Castorp replied, dividing his response into a first and second, “I don’t understand why someone with a harmless fever—we’ll assume there is such a thing—with a harmless fever, then, has to stay in bed, but not in the opposite case. And second, I’m telling you that my cold has not made me hotter than I already was. My position remains,” he concluded, “that ninety-nine point seven is ninety-nine point seven. And if you can run around with that, so can I.”"
"Sie bestiegen den Lift, dessen elektrisches Triebwerk der Franzose bediente. Im Hinaufgleiten trocknete Hans Castorp sich die Augen.","They boarded the elevator, the electric motor operated by the Frenchman. Hans Castorp dried his eyes as he glided up.","They entered the lift—it was an electric one, worked by the Frenchman. As they went up, Hans Castorp wiped his eyes.","They got on the elevator, the Frenchman operating the electric switches. As they glided upward, Hans Castorp dried his eyes."
"»Sofort waren Sie wahrscheinlich beschwipst«, bekräftigte der Hofrat. »Das sind die löslichen Gifte, die von den Bakterien erzeugt werden; die wirken berauschend auf das Zentralnervensystem, verstehen Sie, und dann kriegt man heitere Bäckchen. Sie gehen nun erst einmal in die Klappe, Castorp; wir müssen sehen, ob wir Sie durch ein paar Wochen Bettruhe nüchtern kriegen. Das Weitere kann nachher kommen. Wir nehmen eine schöne Innenansicht von Ihnen auf – es wird Ihnen Spaß machen, so Einblick zu gewinnen in Ihre eigne Person. Das sage ich Ihnen aber gleich: ein Fall wie Ihrer heilt nicht von heute bis übermorgen, Reklameerfolge und Wunderkuren sind dabei nicht aufzuweisen. Es kam mir doch gleich so vor, als ob Sie ein besserer Patient sein würden, mit mehr Talent zum Kranksein, als der Brigadegeneral da, der immer gleich weg will, wenn er mal ein paar Striche weniger hat. Als ob Stillgelegen nicht ein ebenso gutes Kommando wäre wie Stillgestanden! Ruhe ist die erste Bürgerpflicht, und Ungeduld schadet bloß. Daß Sie mich also nicht enttäuschen, Castorp, und meine Menschenkenntnis nicht Lügen strafen, bitt’ ich mir aus! Und nun marsch, in die Remise mit Ihnen!«","""You were probably tipsy straight away,"" the councilor confirmed. “These are the soluble toxins produced by the bacteria; they have a heady effect on the central nervous system, you know, and then you get cheerful cheeks. You're going to get screwed, Castorp; we need to see if we can sober you up with a few weeks of bed rest. The rest can come later. We take a nice inside view of you - you will enjoy gaining insight into yourself in this way. But I'll tell you right away: a case like yours doesn't heal from today to the day after tomorrow, and there are no signs of successful advertising or miracle cures. It immediately struck me as if you were a better patient, with more talent for being sick than that brigadier general who always wants to leave when he's a few marks short. As if stand still wasn't as good a command as stand still! Rest is the first duty of citizenship, and impatience only harms. So that you don't disappoint me, Castorp, and don't give the lie to my knowledge of human nature, I ask myself! And now off you go to the coach house!”","“You were probably fuddled right from the start, in my opinion,” the Hofrat confirmed him. “Those were the soluble toxins thrown off by the bacteria; they act like an intoxicant upon the central nervous system and give you a hectic flush. Now, Castorp, we’ll stick you into bed and see if a couple of weeks’ rest will sober you up. What follows will follow. We’ll take a handsome x-ray of you—you’ll enjoy seeing what goes on in your own inside. But I tell you straightaway, a case like yours doesn’t get well from one day to the next: it isn’t a question of the miracle cures you read about in advertisements. I thought when I first clapped eyes on you that you would be a better patient than your cousin, with more talent for illness than our brigadiergeneral here, who wants to clear out directly he has a couple of points less fever. As if ‘lie down’ isn’t just as good a word of command as ‘stand up’! It is the citizen’s first duty to be calm, and impatience never did any good to anyone. Now, Castorp, watch out you don’t disappoint me and give the lie to my knowledge of human nature! Get along now, into the caboose with you—march!”","“You felt tipsy right off, I presume,” the director said to prove the point. “That comes from soluble toxins released by the bacteria; they have an intoxicating effect on the central nervous system, you see—which gives you those flushed cheeks. And so first off, Castorp, we’re going to stick you in bed; we’ll see if we can’t get you sobered up with a few weeks of bed rest. And then we shall see what we shall see. We’ll take a pretty interior snapshot of you—it’s always fun to get a look at what’s happening inside your own body. But let me tell you right off: a case like yours is not healed just like that. We don’t promote ourselves with a lot of publicity about miracle cures. I knew at once that you’d be a better patient than visitor, with more talent for being ill than our brigadier general here, who tries to slip away the moment his fever goes down a tenth or two. As if ‘At ease!’ weren’t just as good a command as ‘Attention!’ A citizen’s first duty is to stay calm, and impatience never helps anything. And so I do insist that you not disappoint me, Castorp, or prove me wrong about my knowledge of human nature. And now, forward march!—off to the stall with you both!”"
"Hans Castorp telegraphierte. Er erzählte nach rechts und links, daß sein Vetter wiederkomme, und alle, die Joachim kannten, waren betrübt und erfreut, und zwar beides aufrichtig, denn Joachims properes, ritterliches Wesen hatte die allgemeine Zuneigung gewonnen, und manches unausgesprochene Urteil und Gefühl ging in der Richtung, daß er der Beste gewesen sei von allen hier oben. Wir haben niemanden persönlich im Auge, glauben aber an eine gewisse Genugtuung, die mancher darüber empfand, daß Joachim aus dem Soldatenstande zur horizontalen Lebensweise zurückkehren mußte und in seiner Properkeit nun wieder einer der Unsrigen sein würde. Frau Stöhr, bekanntlich, hatte sich gleich das ihre gedacht; sie fand sich bestätigt in dem ordinären Zweifelsinn, mit dem sie Joachims Aufbruch ins Flachland begleitet hatte, und verschmähte nicht, sich seiner zu rühmen. »Faul, faul«, machte sie. Sie habe die Sache sogleich als faul erkannt und wolle nur hoffen, daß Ziemßen sie nicht oberfaul gemacht habe mit seinem Eigensinn. (»Oberfaul« sagte sie vor lauter unermeßlicher Gewöhnlichkeit.) Da sei es denn doch viel besser, man bleibe gleich bei der Stange, wie sie, die auch ihre Lebensinteressen im Flachlande, nämlich in Cannstadt, habe, einen Mann und zwei Kinder, sich jedoch zu beherrschen wisse … Es kam gar keine Rückäußerung mehr von Joachim oder Frau Ziemßen. Hans Castorp blieb unwissend über Tag und Stunde ihrer Ankunft; zu einem Empfang am Bahnhof kam es aus diesem Grunde nicht, sondern drei Tage nach Absendung von Hansens Depesche waren sie einfach da, und Leutnant Joachim trat mit erregtem Lachen an seines Vetters Dienstlager.","Hans Castorp telegraphed. He told right and left that his cousin was coming back, and all who knew Joachim were saddened and delighted, both sincerely, for Joachim's proper, chivalrous nature had won the general affection, and many unspoken judgments and feelings passed in the Direction that he was the best of everyone up here. We don't have anyone in mind personally, but believe in a certain satisfaction that some felt that Joachim had to return from the military rank to the horizontal way of life and that in his proper state he would now be one of ours again. Frau Stöhr, as is well known, immediately thought of hers; she found herself confirmed in the vulgar doubt with which she had accompanied Joachim's departure for the lowlands, and did not shy away from boasting about him. ""Lazy, lazy,"" she said. She immediately recognized the matter as lazy and just wanted to hope that Ziemssen hadn't made her lazy with his stubbornness. (""Very lazy,"" she said out of sheer immeasurable ordinariness.) Then it would be much better to stick with it, like she, who also has her life interests in the lowlands, namely in Cannstadt, a husband and two children, herself However, I know how to control it … There was no reply at all from Joachim or Ms. Ziemßen. Hans Castorp remained ignorant of the day and hour of their arrival; For this reason there was no reception at the station, but three days after Hansen's telegram had been sent they were simply there, and Lieutenant Joachim, laughing excitedly, walked up to his cousin's camp.","Hans Castorp telegraphed. He spread the news of his cousin’s return, and all those who had been the young man’s friends were glad and sorry and both quite sincerely; for his clean and chivalrous personality had been universally approved, and there was a sort of unspoken feeling that Joachim had been the best of the lot up here. We mention no one in particular; but incline to think that in some quarters a certain satisfaction was felt in the knowledge that Joachim must give up the soldier’s career and return to the horizontal, and in all his immaculateness become one of them up here again. Frau Stöhr, of course, had had her ideas all along; time had now justified the rather unfeeling hints she threw out when Joachim went down, and she was not above saying I told you so. “Pretty rotten,” she called it. She had known it for that from the first, and only hoped that Ziemssen by his pigheadedness had not made it putrid. Her choice of words was conditioned by sheer innate vulgarity. How much better it was to stop at one’s post, as she did; she too had her life down below, in Cannstadt, a husband and two children, but she could contain herself. . . No reply came to the telegram. Hans Castorp remained in ignorance of the hour or day of his cousin’s coming, and thus could not receive him at the station when, three days later, he and his mother simply arrived. Lieutenant Joachim, laughing and excited, burst upon his cousin in the evening rest-cure.","Hans Castorp telegraphed back. He also told anyone who would listen that his cousin was returning, and all those who knew Joachim were both sad and happy to hear the news, and were sincere in both emotions, because Joachim’s orderly, chivalrous demeanor had won him general goodwill; and a common response, though left unspoken, was that Joachim was the best of the lot up here. We looked no one square in the eye, but we assume there were many who felt a certain satisfaction in Joachim’s having to leave his soldierly profession and resume an orderly, horizontal life with the rest of us up here. Frau Stöhr, as we know, had felt that way from the first; she found her own vulgar skepticism, with which she had sent Joachim on his way down to the flatlands, confirmed, and did not mind praising herself for it. “Rotten, rotten,” she said. She had known there was something rotten about the whole affair from the first and could only hope that Ziemssen’s obstinacy had not turned it putrid—“putrid,” she said, in her infinite vulgarity. It was really much wiser to stick to one’s guns, the way she did—she, too, had a life down in the flatlands, in Cannstatt, to be precise, a husband and two children, but she knew how to contain herself. There was no further reply, either from Joachim or Frau Ziemssen. Hans Castorp was left uncertain of the day and hour of their arrival—which is why he was not at the station to meet them, when, three days after he had sent off his telegram, they were suddenly simply there."
"Zur Hauptprüfung hatte er scharf und anhaltend arbeiten müssen und sah, als er heimkam, denn doch noch matter aus, als es zu seinem Typus paßte. Dr. Heidekind schalt, so oft er ihn sah, und forderte Luftveränderung, das heißt: eine gründliche. Mit Norderney oder Wyk auf Föhr, sagte er, sei es dieses Mal nicht getan, und wenn man ihn frage, so gehörte Hans Castorp, bevor er auf die Werft gehe, für ein paar Wochen ins Hochgebirge.","For the main examination he had to work hard and persistently, and when he came home he looked even weaker than suited his type. dr Heidekind scolded him whenever he saw him and demanded a change of scenery, that is, a thorough one. With Norderney or Wyk auf Föhr, he said, it wasn't enough this time, and if you ask him, Hans Castorp should spend a few weeks in the high mountains before he goes to the shipyard.","He had had to work hard and steadily for his examination, and came home looking rather paler than a man of his blond, rosy type should do. Dr. Heidekind scolded, and insisted on a change of air; a complete change, not a stay at Norderney or Wyk on Föhr—that would not mend matters this time , he said; if they wanted his advice, it was that Hans Castorp should go for a few weeks to the high mountains before he took up his work in the yards.","His exams had meant a long period of concentrated work, and upon returning home he looked paler than he ought—even given his general type. Dr. Heidekind scolded whenever he saw him and insisted on a change of air, and he meant a radical change. Norderney or Wyk on the island of Föhr, he said, would not do it this time, and if you were to ask him, what Hans Castorp needed was a few weeks in the Alps before going to work on the docks."
"»Sagst du, daß sie mit den Beinen strampelte?«","""Did you say she kicked her legs?""",“You say she kicked?”,“Are you saying she was kicking with her legs?”
"»Doch, ja, das habe ich«, bestätigte Hans Castorp. »Erfahrungsgemäß ist es gar nicht so leicht, hier oben Bekanntschaften zu machen, aber mit Frau Chauchat und mir hat es sich in letzter Stunde doch noch getroffen und arrangiert, gesprächsweise sind wir uns …« Hans Castorp zog die Luft durch die Zähne ein. Er hatte die Spritze empfangen. »Fff!« machte er rückwärts. »Das war sicher ein hochwichtiger Nerv, den Sie da zufällig getroffen haben, Herr Hofrat. Oh, ja, ja, es schmerzt höllenmäßig. Danke, etwas Massage verbessert die Sache … Gesprächsweise sind wir uns näher gekommen.«","""Yes, yes, I did,"" confirmed Hans Castorp. ""From experience, it's not that easy to make acquaintances up here, but Ms. Chauchat and I finally met and arranged things last hour, we talked to each other..."" Hans Castorp sucked in air through his teeth. He had received the injection. ""Fff!"" he did backwards. “That must have been a very important nerve that you accidentally struck, Herr Hofrat. Oh, yes, yes, it hurts like hell. Thanks, a massage will make things better... We've gotten closer as we talked.""","“Yes,” went on the youth, “ I made her acquaintance—a thing that isn’t so easy, hereabouts, you know. But Frau Chauchat and I, we managed, at the eleventh hour, we had some conversation—Ff—f!” went Hans Castorp, and drew his breath sharply through his teeth. The needle had gone in. “That was certainly a very important nerve you happened to hit on, Herr Hofrat,” he said. “I do assure you, it hurt like the devil. Thanks, a little massage does it good. . . Yes, we came a little closer to each other, in conversation.”","“Yes, indeed, I did,” Hans Castorp confirmed. “It’s been my experience that it isn’t all that easy to make acquaintances up here, but it just worked out that way for Frau Chauchat and me at the very last minute and we sort of fell into conversation and . . .” Hans Castorp pulled air in between his teeth. The needle struck home. “Fff!” he sucked in. “That’s a critical nerve you happened to hit there, Director Behrens. Oh, yes, yes, hurts like hell. Thanks, a little massage does help. And so got to know one another, conversationally, I mean.”"
"Eins aber bereitete ihm Genugtuung, wenn er lag und auf sein Herz, sein körperliches Herz achtete, das rasch und vernehmlich in der Stille pochte, – der vorschriftsmäßigen Hausordnungsstille, die während der Haupt- und Schlafliegekur über dem ganzen »Berghof« waltete. Es pochte hartnäckig und vordringlich, sein Herz, wie es das fast beständig tat, seitdem er hier oben war; doch nahm Hans Castorp neuerdings weniger Anstoß daran als in den ersten Tagen. Man konnte jetzt nicht mehr sagen, daß es auf eigene Hand, grundlos und ohne Zusammenhang mit der Seele klopfte. Ein solcher Zusammenhang war vorhanden oder doch unschwer herzustellen; eine rechtfertigende Gemütsbewegung ließ sich der exaltierten Körpertätigkeit zwanglos unterlegen. Hans Castorp brauchte nur an Frau Chauchat zu denken – und er dachte an sie –, so besaß er zum Herzklopfen das zugehörige Gefühl.","One thing, however, gave him satisfaction when he lay and paid attention to his heart, his physical heart, which was beating quickly and audibly in the silence - the prescribed house rules silence that reigned over the entire ""Berghof"" during the main and sleep rest cure. It was beating persistently and urgently, his heart, as it had almost constantly since he was up here; but recently Hans Castorp took less offense than in the first days. One could no longer say that it was knocking on one's own hand, for no reason and without any connection with one's soul. Such a connection existed or was at least not difficult to establish; a justifying emotional emotion could be casually added to the exalted physical activity. Hans Castorp only had to think of Mrs. Chauchat - and he thought of her - and he had the feeling to make his heart pound.","One thing there was which pleased him: when he lay listening to the beating of his heart—his corporeal organ—so plainly audible in the ordered silence of the rest period, throbbing loud and peremptorily, as it had done almost ever since he came, the sound no longer annoyed him. For now he need not feel that it so beat of its own accord, without sense or reason or any reference to his non-corporeal part. He could say, without stretching the truth, that such a connexion now existed, or was easily induced: he was aware that he felt an emotion to correspond with the action of his heart. He needed only to think of Madame Chauchat—and he did think of her—and lo, he felt within himself the emotion proper to the heart-beats.","He did take satisfaction in one thing, however, as he lay there listening to his heart, his physical heart, pounding rapidly and audibly in the stillness—the stillness that was prescribed by house rules and reigned over the entire Berghof during the main rest cure of the day. His heart was pounding insistently, urgently, the way it had done almost constantly ever since he had arrived here; and yet of late that did not upset Hans Castorp as it had the first few days. One could no longer say that it thudded on its own accord, for no reason, and without any connection to his soul. There was a connection now, or at least it would not have been difficult to establish one—a justifiable emotion could easily be assigned to his body’s overwrought activity. Hans Castorp needed only to think of Frau Chauchat—and he did think of her—and his heart had a suitable emotion to make it pound."
"Hans Castorp stieg diesmal zum Meister und seiner Begleiterin. An der Seite des guten Ferge, dem alles Höhere völlig ferne lag, saß er dem Paare gegenüber. Es wurde fast nichts gesprochen auf dieser Heimfahrt. Mynheer saß, die flachen Hände auf dem Plaid, das seine Knie zusammen mit denen Clawdias umhüllte, und ließ den Unterkiefer hängen. Settembrini und Naphta stiegen aus und verabschiedeten sich, bevor die Wagen Geleise und Wasserlauf überschritten. Wehsal fuhr allein in der zweiten Kutsche die Wegschleife hinan und vor das Berghofportal, wo man sich trennte. –","This time Hans Castorp went up to the master and his companion. He sat opposite the couple at the side of the good Ferge, who was far removed from anything higher. Almost nothing was said on this drive home. Mynheer sat, hands flat on the plaid that encased his knees along with Clawdia's, jaw drooping. Settembrini and Naphta got out and said goodbye before the wagons crossed the tracks and the watercourse. Wehsal drove alone in the second carriage up the loop and in front of the Berghof portal, where they parted. –","This time Hans Castorp mounted with Alynheer and Madame, and sat opposite the pair with the humble Ferge, to whom all high thoughts were vain. Scarcely a word was spoken on the homeward drive. Mynheer sat with his jaw dropped and his hands palm upward on the carriage rug spread across his and Madame’s knees. Settembrini and Naphta dismounted and took their leave before the carriages crossed the track and the watercourse, and Wehsal drove alone as far as the portal of the Berghof, where the party separated.","This time Hans Castorp climbed in with the master and his companion, sitting across from the couple and beside good old Ferge, to whom all higher things were utterly foreign. Almost nothing was said during the ride home. Mynheer sat with his jaw slack, his hands palm down on the plaid traveling blanket spread over both his and Clavdia’s knees. Settembrini and Naphta got out and said their good-byes before the carriages moved on across the tracks and the little brook. Wehsal rode alone in the second carriage as it wound its way up the looping drive to the portal of the Berghof, where they all parted."
"Das war peinigend für Joachim; aber der Urheber solcher Lustbarkeit war unempfindlich gegen die Enthüllung seines Zustandes, er mochte meinen, daß derselbe, unbeachtet und verborgen, nicht zu seinem Rechte gekommen wäre. Des allgemeinen Verständnisses dafür durfte er sicher sein. Die Schadenfreude, die sich darein mischte, nahm er in den Kauf. Nicht nur von seinem eigenen Tisch, sondern nachgerade auch von anderen, benachbarten blickte man auf ihn, um sich an seinem Erbleichen und Erröten zu weiden, wenn nach Beginn einer Mahlzeit die Glastür ins Schloß schmetterte, und auch hiermit war er wohl gar noch zufrieden, da es ihm schien, daß seinem Rausch, indem er Aufmerksamkeit erregte, eine gewisse Anerkennung und Bestätigung von außen zuteil werde, geeignet, seine Sache zu fördern, seine unbestimmten und unvernünftigen Hoffnungen zu ermutigen, – und das beglückte ihn sogar. Es kam dahin, daß man sich buchstäblich versammelte, um {363}dem Verblendeten zuzusehen. Das war etwa nach Tische auf der Terrasse oder am Sonntagnachmittag vor der Conciergeloge, wenn die Kurgäste dort ihre Post in Empfang nahmen, die an diesem Tage nicht auf die Zimmer verteilt wurde. Vielfach wußte man, daß da ein kolossal Beschwipster und Hochilluminierter sei, der sich alles anmerken ließ, und so standen etwa Frau Stöhr, Fräulein Engelhart, die Kleefeld nebst ihrer Freundin mit dem Tapirgesicht, der unheilbare Herr Albin, der junge Mann mit dem Fingernagel und noch dieses oder jenes Mitglied der Patientenschaft, – standen mit hinuntergezogenen Mündern und durch die Nase pruschend und sahen ihm zu, der, verloren und leidenschaftlich lächelnd, jene Hitze auf den Wangen, die ihn sofort am ersten Abend seines Hierseins ergriffen, jenen Glanz in den Augen, den schon der Husten des Herrenreiters darin entzündet, in einer bestimmten Richtung blickte …","That was tormenting for Joachim; but the originator of such merriment was impervious to the revelation of his condition, he might think that, unnoticed and hidden, it would not have come into its own. He could be sure of the general understanding of this. He put up with the glee that mingled with it. People looked at him not only from his own table, but also from other neighboring ones, in order to gloat over his paling and blushing when the glass door slammed shut after the start of a meal, and he was probably even satisfied with this, for it seemed to him that, by attracting attention, his intoxication received a certain recognition and confirmation from without, apt to further his cause, to encourage his vague and unreasonable hopes--and that even made him happy. It got to the point of literally gathering to watch {363}the blind man. That was, for example, after tables on the terrace or on Sunday afternoons in front of the concierge lounge, when the spa guests received their mail there, which was not distributed to the rooms that day. In many cases one knew that there was a colossally tipsy and highly illuminated man who let everything be noticed, and so there stood Frau Stöhr, Fraulein Engelhart, Frau Kleefeld together with her friend with the tapir face, the incurable Herr Albin, the young man with the fingernail and nor this or that member of the patient body, - stood with their mouths down and sniffing their noses and watched him, who, lost and smiling passionately, that heat on his cheeks that immediately seized him on the first evening of his being here, that glow in his Eyes, which the gentleman's rider's cough already inflamed in them, looked in a certain direction...","This was painful for Joachim; but the object of their mirth seemed insensible to his own self-betrayal; perhaps he felt that his state, if concealed and unregarded, would never come to any proof. He might count, however, on a general understanding of it, and as for the inevitable malice that went with it, he took that for granted. People, not only at his own table, but at neighbouring ones as well, enjoyed seeing him flush and pale when the glass door slammed. And even this gratified him; it was like an outward confirmation and assertion of his inner frenzy, which seemed to him calculated to forward his affair, and encourage his vague and senseless hopes. And so it too made him happy. It came to this: that people actually stood about in groups to observe the infatuated youth—after dinner, on the terrace, or on a Sunday afternoon before the porter’s lodge, when the letters were distributed, for on that day they were not carried to the patients’ rooms. He was quite generally known to be very far gone, drunk as a lord and not caring who knew it. Frau Stöhr, Fräulein Engelhart, Hermine Kleefeld and her friend the tapir-faced girl, Herr Albin, the young man with the finger-nail, and perhaps others among the guests—would stand together and watch him, with the corners of their mouths drawn down, fairly chortling, whilst he, poor wight, his face aglow with the heat that from the first had never left him, with the glittering eye the gentleman rider’s cough had kindled, would gaze, forlornly and frantically smiling, in one certain direction.","It was all very painful for Joachim; but the person who was the source of their amusement seemed insensitive to this revelation of his inner state. Perhaps he thought that if he had left it hidden and ignored, it would never have come into its own. He could be sure of meeting with general sympathy and was willing to accept the schadenfreude that might come with it. Not just people at his own table, but by now those at neighboring tables as well, took delight in watching him blanch and blush when the glass door banged shut at the start of each meal; and indeed he even found some gratification in attracting their attention, since it brought with it a certain external acknowledgment and confirmation of his intoxicated state, which somehow tended both to advance his cause and to encourage his own vague, irrational hopes—and it all made him very happy. It came to the point where people literally gathered to watch the infatuated young man—on the terrace after dinner or on Sunday afternoon when all the guests thronged the concierge’s desk to pick up their mail, which on that one day was not delivered to their rooms. It was generally known that he was tipsy as hell, a man in a highly lambent state, who did not care who noticed. And so Frau Stöhr,Fräulein Engelhart, young Kleefeld, her girlfriend with the face of a tapir, the incurable Herr Albin, the young man with the saltcellar fingernail, and various other sanatorium residents would stand there with mouths pulled down at the corners and snort through their noses as they watched him gaze in one particular direction—a forlorn and passionate smile on his lips, the same flush on his cheeks that had appeared his first evening here, the same glint in his eyes that had been enkindled by the Austrian horseman’s cough."
"So vergingen einige Tage, vier oder fünf. Das Leben des Sendboten lief auf Schienen, – auf denen, die ihm gelegt waren, und daß es außerhalb ihrer laufen könne, schien keine Denkbarkeit. Der Konsul hatte seine Erlebnisse, gewann seine Eindrücke, – wir wollen ihn nicht weiter dabei belauschen. Er hob eines Tages in Hans Castorps Zimmer ein schwarzes Glasplättchen auf, das unter anderem kleinen Privatbesitz, womit der Inhaber sein reinliches Heim geschmückt, gestützt von einer geschnitz{658}ten Miniaturstaffelei, auf der Kommode stand und sich, gegen das Licht erhoben, als photographisches Negativ erwies. »Was ist denn das?« fragte der Onkel betrachtend … Er mochte wohl fragen! Das Porträt war ohne Kopf, es war das Skelett eines menschlichen Oberkörpers in nebelhafter Fleischeshülle, – ein weiblicher Torso übrigens, wie sich erkennen ließ. »Das? Ein Souvenir«, antwortete Hans Castorp. Worauf der Onkel »Pardon!« sagte, das Bildnis auf die Staffelei zurückstellte und sich rasch davon entfernte. Dies nur als Beispiel für seine Erlebnisse und Eindrücke in diesen vier oder fünf Tagen. Auch an einer Conférence des Dr. Krokowski nahm er teil, da es undenkbar war, sich davon auszuschließen. Und was die erstrebte Privatunterhaltung mit Hofrat Behrens betraf, so bekam er am sechsten Tage seinen Willen. Er wurde bestellt und stieg nach dem Frühstück, entschlossen, ein ernstes Wort mit dem Manne wegen seines Neffen und dessen Zeitverbrauchs zu reden, ins Souterrain hinab.","A few days passed like this, four or five. The life of the emissary ran on rails - on those that were laid for him, and that it could run outside of them seemed inconceivable. The Consul had his experiences, gained his impressions - we don't want to eavesdrop on him any further. One day in Hans Castorp's room he picked up a small piece of black glass which, among other things, was a small private possession, with which the owner decorated his clean home, supported by a carved miniature easel, stood on the chest of drawers and stood up against the light as photographic negative proved. ""What's that?"" asked the uncle, considering ... he might well ask! The portrait was headless, it was the skeleton of a human torso in a hazy shell of flesh—a female torso, by the way, as could be seen. ""The? A souvenir,” answered Hans Castorp. Whereupon the uncle said ""Pardon!"" put the portrait back on the easel and quickly walked away from it. This is only an example of his experiences and impressions in these four or five days. Also at a conference of Dr. Krokowski, he took part because it was unthinkable to exclude himself from it. And as far as the desired private conversation with Hofrat Behrens was concerned, he got his way on the sixth day. He was summoned and after breakfast, determined to have a serious word with the man about his nephew and his wasting of time, he went down to the basement.","Some days passed, perhaps four or five. The life of the ambassador ran on rails— the rails laid for it to run on—and that it should run off them was unthinkable. The Consul had his experiences, got his impressions—in which we shall not trouble to follow him. One day, in Hans Castorp’s room, he lifted from its easel on the chest of drawers a black glass plate, one of the small personal articles with which the owner adorned his cleanly quarters. He held it toward the light; it proved to be a photographic negative. He looked at it—“What is that?” he said. He might well ask. It showed the headless skeleton of a human form—the upper half, that is—enveloped in misty flesh; he recognized the female torso. “That? Oh, a souvenir,” the nephew answered. To which the uncle replied: “Pardon me,” and hastily replaced the picture on its easel. We give this merely as example of the sort of experience the four or five days supplied him. He attended one of Dr. Krokowski’s conférences— that he should stop away was unthinkable. On the sixth day he achieved the much-desired private talk with the Hofrat. He was sent for, and after breakfast descended the stairs to the basement, to have a serious word with the man on the subject of his nephew and the way he spent his time.","Several days passed, four or five. The envoy’s life proceeded along the tracks laid down for him, and it seemed inconceivable it could have proceeded any other way. The consul experienced life here, gathered impressions—and we do not wish to spy on him any further. One day he happened to notice a little plate of dark glass that Hans Castorp had placed atop his chest of drawers along with several other personal items by way of decoration for his tidy room; he picked it up from the little carved wooden stand in which it rested and, holding it up against the light, discovered it was the negative of a photograph. “What’s this?” Uncle James asked, still staring at it—and an honest question it was. The portrait had no head, it was the skeleton of a human torso inside a foggy halo of flesh—the torso of a woman, he realized. “That? A souvenir,” Hans Castorp replied. And then his uncle said, “Pardon me!” put the portrait back on its stand, and quickly left the room. We mention this merely as one example of his experiences and impressions during those four or five days. He also attended one of Dr. Krokowski’s lectures, since it was unthinkable that he could excuse himself from it. And as for the private discussion he hoped to have with Director Behrens, he was granted his wish on the sixth day. He was sent for, and after breakfast he descended to the basement, determined to have a serious word with the man about his nephew and the way he was spending his time."
"Sie lächelte, – zierlich und etwas verschlossen. Das Erbarmen mit ihrer Mühsal schien in der Tat verschwendet. Es sah nicht aus, als sei sie besonders erschöpft davon. Vielleicht erinnerte sie sich gar nicht daran. Sie saß in des Doktors Besuchersessel an der rückwärtigen Breitseite des Schreibtisches am Fenster, zwischen ihm und der spanischen Wand, die die Chaiselongue umstand; hatte dem Stuhl eine Wendung gegeben, daß sie den Arm auf die Schreibtischplatte stützen konnte und ins Zimmer blickte. So saß sie, von gerührten Blicken gestreift, mit aufmunterndem Kopfnicken hie und da bedacht, schweigend während der ganzen Pause, die fünfzehn Minuten dauerte.","She smiled - daintily and somewhat closed. Indeed, pity for their toil seemed wasted. It didn't look like she was particularly exhausted by it. Maybe she didn't even remember. She sat in the doctor's visitor's chair at the back of the desk by the window, between him and the screen that surrounded the chaise longue; had turned the chair so that she could rest her arm on the desk and look into the room. So she sat, touched by touched looks, with a nod of encouragement here and there, silent throughout the interval, which lasted fifteen minutes.","She smiled affectedly, rather remotely. In truth, their solicitude seemed wasted; she did not appear exhausted by her efforts. Perhaps she retained no memory of them. She sat down in the chair reserved for patients, by the writing-desk near the window, between the desk and the screen about the chaise-longue; gave the chair a turn so that she could support her elbow on the desk and look into the room; and remained thus, receiving their sympathetic glances and encouraging nods, silent during the whole intermission, which lasted fifteen minutes.","She smiled, an affected and somewhat reserved smile. Their pity for her labors did indeed seem to have been wasted. She did not look particularly exhausted. Perhaps she did not even remember any of it. She sat in the chair reserved for patients at the back of the doctor’s wide desk, near the window, between it and the folding screen arranged around the chaise longue; she had turned the chair enough so that she could brace one arm on the desktop and look out into the room. And there she sat, the object of sympathetic glances and occasional encouraging nods, and said not a word during the entire intermission, which lasted fifteen minutes."
"»Wie steht es denn mit den Stichen am rechten Hilus, wo es immer verschärft klang? Besser? Na, kommen Sie her! Wollen mal höflich bei Ihnen anklopfen.« Und die Auskultation begann.","'How about the stitches in the right hilum, where it always sounded sharp? Better? Come here! Let's knock on your door politely.' And the auscultation began.","“How about the stitches in the right hilum, where it always sounded so sharp? Better? eh? Well, come along, let me thump you about a bit.” And the auscultation began.","“And how is that little twinge in the right hilum, where it always sounds a little aggravated? Better? Well, come here. Let’s give you a few polite thumps.” And the auscultation began."

"Noch um ein Uhr dauerte die Festsitzung an, zusammengehalten teils durch bleierne Rauscheslähmung, teils durch das eigentümliche Vergnügen, sich die Nacht um die Ohren zu schlagen, teils durch die Persönlichkeitswirkung Peeperkorns und durch das abschreckende Beispiel Petri und der Seinen, an deren Fleischesschwäche niemand teilhaben wollte. Allgemein gesprochen, schien der weibliche Teil weniger gefährdet in dieser Hinsicht. Denn während die Männer, rot oder fahl, die Beine von sich streckten und die Backen aufbliesen, indem sie nur noch mechanisch dann und wann dem Becher zusprachen, von rechter Dienstfreudigkeit nicht mehr beseelt, hielten die Frauen sich tätiger. Hermine Kleefeld, die nackten Ellbogen auf die Tischplatte gestemmt, die Wangen in den Händen, wies lachend dem kichernden Ting-Fu den Schmelz ihrer Vorderzähne, indes Frau Stöhr, mit angezogenem Kinn über die vorgebogene Schulter kokettierend, den Staatsanwalt ans Leben zu fesseln suchte. Mit Frau Magnus war es dahin gekommen, daß sie auf Herrn Albins Schoß Platz genommen hatte und ihn an beiden Ohrläppchen zog, was aber Herr Magnus eher als Erleichterung zu empfinden schien. Anton Karlowitsch Ferge ward aufgefordert, die Geschichte seines Pleura-Choks zum besten zu geben, kam aber wegen Zungenschlages nicht zustande damit und erklärte ehrlich seinen Bankerott, der als {864}Anlaß zum Trinken einstimmig ausgerufen wurde. Wehsal weinte vorübergehend bitterlich, aus irgendwelchen Elendstiefen, in welche seinen Mitmenschen Einblick zu eröffnen auch seine Zunge nicht mehr imstande war, wurde aber mit Kaffee und Kognak seelisch wieder auf die Beine gebracht und erregte übrigens durch das Gewimmer seiner Brust, durch sein runzelig bebendes Kinn, das von Tränen troff, das bedeutendste Interesse Peeperkorns, der mit erhobenem Zeigefinger und hochgezogenen Arabesken die allgemeine Aufmerksamkeit für Wehsals Zustand in Anspruch nahm.","The celebratory session was still going on at one o'clock, held together partly by leaden paralysis, partly by the peculiar pleasure of beating the night around one's ears, partly by the impact of Peeperkorn's personality and by the deterrent example of Peter and his family, in whose weakness of the flesh no one shares wanted. Generally speaking, the female part seemed less vulnerable in this regard. For while the men, red or sallow, stretched out their legs and puffed out their cheeks, only mechanically smacking their cups now and then, no longer inspired by real willingness to serve, the women kept themselves more active. Hermine Kleefeld, her bare elbows propped on the tabletop, her cheeks in her hands, laughingly pointed the enamel of her front teeth at the giggling Ting-Fu, while Frau Stöhr, with her chin drawn up and coquetting over her protruding shoulder, tried to tie the public prosecutor to life. Ms. Magnus had gotten to the point where she sat on Mr. Albin's lap and pulled both of his earlobes, which Mr. Magnus seemed to take more as a relief. Anton Karlowitsch Ferge was asked to tell the story of his pleura choke, but because of tongue-lashing he couldn't do it and honestly declared his bankruptcy, which was unanimously proclaimed as a reason to drink. Wehsal cried bitterly for a while, from some depths of misery that even his tongue was no longer able to open up to his fellow human beings, but was mentally brought back on his feet with coffee and cognac and, by the way, excited by the whimpering of his chest, by his wrinkled quivering chin , dripping with tears, was the prime interest of Peeperkorn, who, with finger-wagging and arabesques, drew attention to Woesal's condition.","The party held together for another hour, partly because they were all too leadenfooted and befuddled to rise, partly because this method of spending the hours of the night appealed to them by its novelty; partly by the weight of Peeperkorn’s personality, and the blasting example of Peter and his brethren, to which they all shamed to yield. Generally speaking, the female section seemed less compromised than the male. For the men, flushed or sallow, sat with their legs sprawled before them, puffing out their cheeks. Now and then they would make a half-mechanical effort to lift the glass, but their hearts were no longer in it. The women were more enterprising. Hermine Kleefeld, bare elbows on the table, propped up her head, her cheeks in her hands, and showed the giggling Ting-fu all the enamel of her front teeth. Frau Stöhr, with her chin and shoulder coquettishly meeting, sought to reawaken Lawyer Paravant to desire. Frau Magnus’s state was such that she had seated herself on Herr Albin’s lap and was pulling both his ears by their lobes—a sight in which Herr Magnus appeared to find relief. The company had urged Anton Karlowitsch Ferge to regale them with the story of the pleura-shock; but his tongue was too thick, he could not manage it, and honourably avowed his incapacity, which was greeted by the company as occasion for another drink. Wehsal all at once began to weep bitterly, from some unplumbed depth of wretchedness. They brought him round with coffee and cognac; but the episode roused Peeperkorn’s lively interest, who looked at his quivering chin, from which tears dripped, and with raised forefinger and lifted masklike brows called the attention of the company to the phenomenon.","At one o’clock the festivities were still under way, held together partly by the leaden palsy of drink, partly by the unusual pleasure of making a night of it, partly by the effect of Peeperkorn’s personality, and partly by the deterrent example offered by Saint Peter and friends, whose weakness of the flesh no one wanted to emulate. Generally speaking, the females seemed less endangered in this regard. The men’ sat with legs stretched out before them, puffing up their red or pallid cheeks and merely quaffing mechanically from time to time, apparently no longer inspired by the task at hand; the women, however, were more industrious. Propping her bared elbows on the table, Hermine Kleefeld held both cheeks in her hands and laughed, displaying the enamel of her front teeth to a giggling Dr. Ting-Fu; meanwhile, Frau Stöhr sat with one shoulder rolled forward, her chin tucked up against it, and flirted with the prosecutor, attempting to enslave him. Frau Magnus was so far gone that she was sitting on Herr Albin’s lap, tugging at both his earlobes—to which Herr Magnus reacted with what appeared to be relief. Someone had asked Anton Karlovitch Ferge to entertain them with his tale of pleural shock, but he could not manage his recalcitrant tongue and frankly admitted his incapacity—which was unanimously greeted as cause for another drink. Wehsal wept bitterly for a while, out of the depths of a misery into which he could give them no insight, since his tongue, too, was no longer in service; but coffee and cognac got him back on his mental feet again. His whimpering tones and his wrinkled trembling chin with tears dripping down it aroused Peeperkorn’s eminent interest, and he stood there now with a raised forefinger and a raised brow of arabesques, calling everyone’s attention to Wehsal’s condition."
"»Ich lege mich aber bei Nacht nicht auf den Balkon«, erklärte Hans Castorp. »Das tue ich nicht, ich sage es dir gleich. Es würde mir gar zu sonderbar vorkommen. Alles hat seine Grenzen. Und irgendwie muß ich ja schließlich auch markieren, daß ich nur zu Besuch bin bei euch hier oben. Ich sitze hier noch etwas und rauche meine Zigarre, wie es sich gehört. Sie schmeckt miserabel, aber ich weiß, daß sie gut ist, und das muß mir für heute genügen. Jetzt ist die Uhr gleich neun, – allerdings, leider ist es noch nicht mal neun. Aber wenn es halb zehn ist, dann ist es ja schon so weit, daß man halbwegs normalerweise zu Bett gehen kann.«","""But I don't lie down on the balcony at night,"" explained Hans Castorp. ""I'm not doing that, I'll tell you right away. It would seem too strange to me. Everything has its limits. And somehow I have to mark that I'm only visiting you up here. I'll sit here a little longer and smoke my cigar, as it should be. It tastes awful, but I know it's good, and that'll have to do with me for today. Now the clock is almost nine - unfortunately, it's not even nine yet. But by the time it's nine-thirty, it's far enough to go to bed halfway normally.""","“I shan’t lie out on the balcony at night,” Hans Castorp declared. “I can tell you that at once. It would seem perfectly weird to me. Everything has its limits. I must draw the line somewhere, since I’m really only up here on a visit. I will sit here awhile and smoke my cigar in the regular way. It tastes vile, but I know it’s good, and that will have to do me for to-day. It is close on nine—it isn’t even quite nine yet, more’s the pity—but when it is half past, that is late enough for a man to go to bed at least halfway decently.”","“Well, I’m not going to lie out on my balcony at night in any case,” Hans Castorp declared. “I won’t do that, let me tell you. That would seem really too strange. Everything has its limits. And there has to be some way for me to tell that I’m only a visitor up here among you all. I’ll sit here for a while yet and smoke my cigar, just as usual. It tastes terrible, but I know it’s good and that will have to suffice for me today. It’s almost nine o’clock—well, not quite nine yet, sad to say. But once it’s half past, that will be late enough for me to go to bed at something like a normal time.”"
"»Allerdings,« lachte Hans Castorp; »da haben wir sie klipp und klar vor Augen.«","""Certainly,"" laughed Hans Castorp; ""we have them crystal clear before our eyes.""","“In any case,” laughed Hans Castorp, “we have it all right before our eyes.”","“Yes indeed,” Hans Castorp said, laughing, “there you have it right in front of your nose.”"
"Will schützend ich auf dich herniedersehn,","I want to look down on you protectively,","Thee I would watch and guard alway,","I shall protect you from on high,"
"Nein, das war sie nicht. Aber Hans Castorp konnte sie ohne weiteres holen.","No, she wasn't. But Hans Castorp could fetch them without further ado.","the doctor inquired. No, but Hans Castorp could fetch it at once.","No, it wasn’t. But Hans Castorp could fetch it right away."
"Dankbares Entzücken erfüllte ihn angesichts der Schonung, die seiner Herkunft, seinem jungen Christentum, seinen persönlichen Verhältnissen überhaupt zuteil wurde. Daß es ein Freiplatz war, den er in der Anstalt einnahm, schien niemand zu wissen. Die Hausgesetze lenkten die Aufmerksamkeit seiner Kameraden von der Tatsache ab, daß er ohne Familienanhang, ohne Heimat war. Das Empfangen von Paketen mit Lebensmitteln und Leckereien war allgemein verboten. Was etwa dennoch kam, wurde verteilt, und auch Leo erhielt davon. Der {671}Kosmopolitismus der Anstalt verhinderte jedes auffällige Hervortreten seines Rassengepräges. Es waren da junge Exoten, portugiesische Südamerikaner, die »jüdischer« aussahen als er, und so kam dieser Begriff abhanden. Der äthiopische Prinz, der gleichzeitig mit Naphta Aufnahme gefunden hatte, war sogar ein wolliger Mohrentyp, dabei aber sehr vornehm.","He was filled with grateful delight at the consideration shown to his origins, his young Christianity, and his personal circumstances in general. No one seemed to know that it was a free place in the institution. The house laws diverted the attention of his comrades from the fact that he was without family, without a home. Receiving packages of food and treats was generally forbidden. Anything that came along was distributed, and Leo received it too. The {671}cosmopolitanism of the institution prevented any conspicuous emergence of his racial character. There were young exotics, Portuguese South Americans, who looked more ""Jewish"" than he did, and so the term got lost. The Ethiopian prince, who was accepted at the same time as Naphta, was even a woolly Moorish type, but very distinguished.","He thrilled with gratitude at the consideration they showed him, in respect of his origin, his infant Christianity, and his personal fortunes. No one in the institution seemed to know that he was an object of charity. The rules of the house favoured the concealment of his homeless and family-less state. It was forbidden to send parcels of food or sweets to the pupils; if any came, they were divided and Leo received his share with the others. And the cosmopolitanism of the institution prevented his race from being perceptible. There were other young exotics among the pupils, such as the Portuguese South-Americans, who looked even more “Jewish” than he did, and thus the idea did not come up. An Ethiopian prince had been received at the same time with Naphta; he had woolly hair, and was distinctly Moorish in appearance, though most distinguished.","He was grateful beyond bounds for the respect shown his origins, his infant Christian faith, his personal status in general. No one seemed to realize that he lived and studied free of charge. The rules of the institution diverted the attention of his classmates from the fact that he had no family, no home. The receipt of all packages of food and sweets was expressly forbidden, and if something did arrive, it was distributed evenly among them all. The cosmopolitanism of the Stella prevented his racial traits from being noticed. There were other young foreigners—Portuguese South Americans, who looked more “Jewish” than he, and so the very term lost meaning. The Ethiopian prince who had been admitted at the same time as Naphta was a very elegant-looking Moor with woolly hair."
"»Sie werden Gehör finden, mein Herr!« rief Settembrini ihm nach, der den Tisch verließ und zum Kleiderständer eilte, um sich seines Pelzwerks zu bemächtigen. Dann ließ der Freimaurer sich hart auf seinen Stuhl zurücksinken und preßte sein Herz mit den Händen.","""You will be heard, sir!"" Settembrini called after him, who left the table and rushed to the clothes rack to get hold of his furs. Then the Mason sat back hard in his chair and squeezed his heart with his hands.","You will hear from me.” “And you will find a hearing, sir,” Settembrini called after him, as the Jesuit left his place and hurried to the hat-stand to seek his cloak. Then the Freemason let himself fall back with a thud on his hard chair, and pressed both hands to his heart.","“And you will receive a hearing, sir!” Settembrini shouted after him, as the ex-Jesuit left the table and hurried to the coatrack to gather up his furs. Then the Freemason sank down hard onto his chair and pressed his hands to his heart."
"»Ja, die Stätte der Verwesung. Sie ist der Inbegriff aller Hermetik, nichts anderes als das Gefäß, die wohlverwahrte Kristallretorte, worin der Stoff seiner letzten Wandlung und Läuterung entgegengezwängt wird.«","“Yes, the place of decomposition. It is the epitome of all hermetics, nothing other than the vessel, the well-preserved crystal retort, in which the substance is forced towards its final transformation and purification.«","“Yes, the place of corruption. It comprehends all hermetics, all alchemy, it is nothing else than the receptacle, the well-guarded crystal retort wherein the material is compressed to its final transformation and purification.”","“Yes, the scene of corruption. It is the epitome of all hermetism—nothing less than the vessel, the carefully safeguarded crystal retort, in which matter is forced toward its final mutation and purification.”"
"»Selbstverständlich werden wir ihn besuchen!« erklärte Hans Castorp. »Die Miekrigkeit, – das ist nur das Militär, das da aus dir spricht. Aber die Chaldäer hatten auch solche Nasen und waren doch höllisch auf dem Posten, nicht bloß in den Geheimwissenschaften. Naphta hat auch was von Geheimwissenschaft, er interessiert mich nicht wenig. Ich will auch nicht behaupten, daß ich heute schon klug aus ihm geworden bin, aber wenn wir öfter mit ihm zusammenkommen, so werden wir es vielleicht, und ich halte es gar nicht für ausgeschlossen, daß wir überhaupt klüger werden bei dieser Gelegenheit.«","""Of course we'll visit him!"" declared Hans Castorp. »The hunger – that's just the military speaking out of you. But the Chaldeans also had such noses, and yet they were on the job like hell, and not just in the secret sciences. Naphta also has something of an occult science to it that interests me quite a bit. I don't want to claim that I've gotten any sense out of him today either, but if we get to see him more often we might, and I don't think it's out of the question that we'll get any wiser at all on this occasion.""","“Visit him—of course we’ll visit him,” declared Hans Castorp. “When you talk about his being puny, that’s only the military in you speaking. And as for his nose, the Chaldeans had the same kind, and they knew devilish well what they were about, on more subjects than alchemy. Naphta has something of the mystagogue about him, he interests me a good deal. I won’t say that I make him out altogether, yet, but if we meet him often perhaps we shall; I don’t think it at all unlikely we may learn something from the acquaintance with him.”","“But of course we’ll visit him,” Hans Castorp declared. “And as for being puny—that’s just the soldier talking. The Chaldeans had noses like that, too, and they were damn sharp people, and not just when it came to occult sciences. There is something of the occult about Naphta, too —I find him more than a little intriguing. I can’t say I’ve got him figured out after only today, but if we get together with him often enough, maybe we’ll both be able to. And I don’t think it’s out of the question that we’ll learn a thing or two out of this.”"
"{804}Hans Castorp beeilte sich, zurückzutreten, nicht ohne wahrgenommen zu haben, daß noch andere Mitglieder der Gästeschaft auf die Szene, wie das zu gehen pflegte, ein belustigtes Auge hatten, – unbemerkt von Joachim, oder doch unbeachtet von ihm. Dieser Anblick: Joachim, im Gespräche rücksichtslos hingegeben an die hochbrüstige Marusja, mit der er so lange an ein und demselben Tisch gesessen, ohne ein einziges Wort mit ihr zu wechseln; vor deren Person und Existenz er mit strengem Ausdruck, vernünftig und ehrliebend, die Augen niedergeschlagen hatte, obgleich er fleckig erblaßte, wenn von ihr die Rede war, – erschütterte Hans Castorp mehr, als irgendein Zeichen der Entkräftung, das er in diesen Wochen sonst an seinem armen Vetter wahrgenommen. »Ja, er ist verloren!« dachte er und setzte sich still auf einen Stuhl im Musiksalon, um Joachim Zeit zu lassen für das, was er sich dort in der Halle an diesem letzten Abend noch gönnte.","{804}Hans Castorp hastened to resign, not without noticing that other members of the guests had an amused eye on the scene, as was usual - unnoticed by Joachim, or at least unnoticed by him. This sight: Joachim, in conversation ruthlessly devoted to the high-breasted Marusja, with whom he had sat at the same table for so long without exchanging a single word with her; in front of whose person and existence he had lowered his eyes with a stern expression, sensible and honor-loving, although he turned blotchy when she was spoken of, - shook Hans Castorp more than any sign of exhaustion that he had otherwise seen during these weeks noticed his poor cousin. ""Yes, he's lost!"" he thought and sat quietly on a chair in the music salon to give Joachim time for what he was still allowing himself to do there in the hall that last evening.","The onlooker hastened to withdraw; though he saw that he was not the only one to watch the little scene, unobserved or at least unheeded by Joachim. The sight shook Hans Castorp more than any sign of failing strength he had seen all these weeks in his cousin: Joachim in conversation, sunk in conversation, with Marusja, at whose table he had sat so long without exchanging a syllable with her, but in reason and honour kept his eyes cast down, and sternly refused to be aware of her person or existence, though he went all mottled whenever she was mentioned in his presence—“Ah, yes, he is a lost man,” thought Hans Castorp, and sat down on a chair in the music-room, to give Joachim time for this one farewell indulgence. From now on, Joachim took up the horizontal. Hans Castorp sitting in his excellent chair wrote to Louisa Ziemssen.","Hans Castorp beat a hasty retreat, but not before he realized that other guests of the sanatorium, as was common here, were watching the scene with an amused eye—without Joachim’s noticing, or perhaps caring. What a sight: Joachim recklessly indulging in conversation with high-breasted Marusya, a person with whom he had never exchanged a single word during the whole time they had sat at the same table and at the mention of whose name he had always lowered his eyes and assumed a stern, reasonable, honor-loving expression, though his face had turned blotchy and pale. And it shocked Hans Castorp more than any other sign of his poor cousin’s failing strength that he had noticed over the past weeks. “Yes, he is lost,” he thought and sat quietly for a while in the music room to give Joachim time for whatever it was he was allowing himself out there in the lobby on his last evening."
"Joachim suchte nach einer Antwort. »Gott,« sagte er, »sie sind so frei … Ich meine, es sind ja junge Leute, und die Zeit spielt keine Rolle für sie, und dann sterben sie womöglich. Warum sollen sie da ernste Gesichter schneiden. Ich denke manchmal: Krankheit und Sterben sind eigentlich nicht ernst, sie sind mehr so eine Art Bummelei, Ernst gibt es genau genommen nur im Leben da unten. Ich glaube, daß du das mit der Zeit schon verstehen wirst, wenn du erst länger hier oben bist.«","Joachim searched for an answer. 'God,' he said, 'they're so free... I mean, they're young people and time doesn't matter to them, and then they might die. Why should they make serious faces? I sometimes think: sickness and dying aren't actually serious, they're more of a kind of loitering, strictly speaking, there's only seriousness in life down there. I think you'll understand that in time, once you've been up here a little longer.""","Joachim sought for a reply. “Good Lord,” he said, “they are so free— I mean, they are so young, and time is nothing to them, and then they may die—perhaps —why should they make a long face? Sometimes I think being ill and dying aren’t serious at all just a sort of loafing about and wasting time; life is only serious down below. You will get to understand that after a while, but not until you have spent some time up here.”","Joachim searched for an answer. “My God,” he said, “they’re so free. I mean, they’re young and time plays no role in their lives, and they may very well die. Why should they go around with long faces? I sometimes think that illness and death aren’t really serious matters, that it’s all more like loafing around, and that, strictly speaking, things are serious only down below in real life. I think maybe you’ll come to understand that in due time, after you’ve been up here with us a little longer.”"
"Bequem und nicht ohne Würde trug er auf seinen Schultern die hohe Zivilisation, welche die herrschende Oberschicht der handeltreibenden Stadtdemokratie ihren Kindern vererbt. Er {52}war so gut gebadet wie ein Baby und ließ sich von jenem Schneider kleiden, der das Vertrauen der jungen Leute seiner Sphäre besaß. Der kleine, sorgfältig gezeichnete Wäscheschatz, den die englischen Züge seines Schrankes bargen, ward von Schalleen aufs beste betreut; noch als Hans Castorp auswärts studierte, schickte er ihn regelmäßig zur Reinigung und Ausbesserung nach Hause (denn seine Maxime war, daß man außer in Hamburg im Reiche nicht zu bügeln verstehe), und eine aufgerauhte Stelle an der Manschette eines seiner hübschen farbigen Hemden hätte ihn mit heftigem Unbehagen erfüllt. Seine Hände, obgleich nicht sonderlich aristokratisch in der Form, waren gepflegt und frisch von Haut, mit einem Kettenring aus Platin und dem großväterlichen Erbsiegelring geschmückt, und seine Zähne, die etwas weich waren und mehrfach Schaden gelitten hatten, mit Gold ergänzt.","Comfortably and not without dignity, he carried on his shoulders the high civilization which the ruling upper class of the commercial urban democracy inherited from their children. He was bathed as well as a baby and had himself clothed by that tailor who had the confidence of the young people of his sphere. The small, carefully drawn treasure of linen, which the English features of his closet contained, was well looked after by Schalleen; Even when Hans Castorp was studying abroad, he regularly sent him home to be cleaned and repaired (for his maxim was that except in Hamburg one did not know how to iron in the Reich), and a rough spot on the cuff of one of his pretty colored shirts would have him filled with intense uneasiness. His hands, though not particularly aristocratic in form, were trim and fresh of skin, adorned with a chain ring of platinum and the grandfather's hereditary signet ring, and his teeth, which were somewhat soft and had been damaged several times, were supplemented with gold.","Comfortably, not without dignity, he carried the weight of culture with which the governing upper class of the commercial city endowed its children. He was as clean as a well-cared-for baby, and dressed by the tailor in whom the young men of his social sphere felt most confidence. Schalleen took beautiful care of his small stock of carefully marked linen, which was bestowed in a dressing-chest on the English plan. When he studied away from home, he regularly sent back his laundry to be washed and mended, for it was a saying of his that outside Hamburg nobody in the kingdom knew how to iron. A rough spot on the cuff of his dainty coloured shirts filled him with acute discomfort. His hands, though not particularly aristocratic in shape, were well tended and fresh-skinned, and he wore a platinum chain ring as well as the seal ring inherited from Grandfather. His teeth were rather soft and defective and he had a number of gold fillings.","The upper class of this commercial and democratic city-state bequeaths its children the burden of higher civilization, and Hans Castorp bore it on his shoulders with a certain easy dignity. He was bathed spotless as a baby, and he had his clothes made by a tailor who enjoyed the trust of the young men in his circle. Schalleen took splendid care of his little treasure of neatly monogrammed underwear and shirts, which were tucked away in the English-style drawers of his wardrobe. Even when Hans Castorp left home to study, he regularly sent his things home to be laundered and mended—for it was his maxim that no one in the empire except residents of Hamburg knew how to iron—and a badly creased cuff on one of his pretty pastel shirts filled him with a terrible unease. Although the shape of his hands was not particularly aristocratic, he took good care of them, keeping the skin supple and setting them off with a simple platinum band and his grandfather’s signet ring; his teeth, which were rather soft and subject to damage, had been repaired with gold inlays."
»Hast du nicht vielleicht einen Bleistift?«,"""Don't you have a pencil?""","“Eh—h!” turned his back on the room and the carnival gaieties.—But Hans Castorp was standing on the tiled court of the school yard, gazing at close quarters into these blue-grey-green epicanthus eyes, above the prominent cheekbones, and saying: “Do you happen to have a pencil?”","Hans Castorp, however, was standing in the brick schoolyard, staring from close up into a pair of blue-gray-green, epicanthic eyes above prominent cheekbones; and he said, “Do you have a pencil, perhaps?”"

"Zu plaudern! Man konnte es sich denken. Niemandem war wohl bei dem Wort, einem rechten Wort des fröhlichen Kameraden Krokowski. Jedermann fühlte sein Innerstes kalt davon angerührt, auch Hans Castorp, als er verspätet seinen vorzüglichen Liegestuhl bezog und sich erinnerte, wie ihm bei Ellys ungebührlichen Leistungen und der verschämten Erklärung, die sie dafür gegeben, der Boden unter den Füßen geschwankt hatte, so daß eine gewisse Übelkeit und körperliche Beängstigung, eine leichte Seekrankheit ihn angekommen war. Er hatte niemals ein Erdbeben erlebt, aber er sagte sich, daß damit wohl ähnliche Empfindungen unverwechselbaren Schreckens verbunden sein müßten, – von der Neugier abgesehen, die Ellen Brands fatale Fähigkeiten ihm außerdem einflößten: einer Neugier, die das Gefühl ihrer höheren Hoffnungslosigkeit in sich selbst trug, das heißt: das Bewußtsein der geistigen Unzugänglichkeit des Gebietes, wonach sie tastete, und daher den Zweifel, ob sie nur müßig oder auch {997}sündig sei, was sie aber nicht hinderte, zu bleiben, was sie war, nämlich Neugier. Hans Castorp hatte, wie jedermann, im Lauf seiner Lebensjahre von Dingen der geheimen Natur oder Übernatur dies und jenes vernommen, – der seherischen Urtante ist ja Erwähnung geschehen, von der eine melancholische Überlieferung auf ihn gekommen. Aber niemals war diese Welt, der er eine theoretische und unbeteiligte Anerkennung nicht versagt hatte, ihm persönlich auf den Leib gerückt, nie hatte er praktische Erfahrungen damit gemacht, und sein Widerstreben gegen solche Erfahrungen, ein Geschmackswiderstreben, ein ästhetisches Widerstreben, ein Widerstreben humanen Stolzes – wenn wir so anspruchsvolle Ausdrücke verwenden dürfen in Hinsicht auf unseren durchaus anspruchslosen Helden – kam der Neugier, die sie ihm lebhaft erregten, fast gleich. Er fühlte im voraus, fühlte es klar und deutlich, daß diese Erfahrungen, wie sie auch fortgehen mochten, nie anders sich würden anlassen können, als abgeschmackt, unverständlich und menschlich würdelos. Dennoch brannte er darauf, sie zu machen. Er begriff, daß »Müßig oder sündig«, als Alternative schon schlimm genug, gar keine Alternative war, sondern daß das zusammenfiel, und daß geistige Hoffnungslosigkeit nur die außermoralische Ausdrucksform der Verbotenheit war. Das Placet experiri aber, ihm eingepflanzt von einem, der solche Versuche freilich aufs prallste mißbilligen mußte, saß fest in Hans Castorps Sinn; seine Sittlichkeit fiel nachgerade mit seiner Neugier zusammen, hatte das wohl eigentlich immer getan: mit der unbedingten Neugier des Bildungsreisenden, die vielleicht schon, als sie vom Mysterium der Persönlichkeit kostete, nicht mehr weit von dem hier auftauchenden Gebiet entfernt gewesen war, und die eine Art von militärischem Charakter bekundete dadurch, daß sie dem Verbotenen nicht auswich, wenn es sich anbot. So beschloß Hans Castorp, auf dem Posten zu sein und nicht beiseite zu stehen, wenn es mit Ellen Brand zu weiteren Abenteuern kommen sollte.","To chat! You could imagine. Nobody was comfortable with the word, a right word of the cheerful comrade Krokowski. Everyone felt his innermost being touched coldly, including Hans Castorp, when he belatedly moved into his excellent deck chair and remembered how the ground had trembled under his feet at Elly's improper performance and the shameful explanation she gave for it, so that a certain nausea and physical anxiety, a slight seasickness had arrived. He had never experienced an earthquake, but he told himself that there must be similar feelings of unmistakable terror associated with it—aside from the curiosity that Ellen Brand's fatal abilities also inspired in him: a curiosity that made him feel her higher hopelessness carried, that is: the consciousness of the spiritual inaccessibility of the area for which she groped, and therefore the doubt whether she was merely idle or also {997}sinful, which did not prevent her from remaining what she was, namely curiosity. Hans Castorp, like everyone else, had heard this and that about things of secret nature or the supernatural in the course of his life - the visionary great-aunt was mentioned, from which a melancholy tradition came down to him. But this world, to which he had not denied theoretical and impartial recognition, had never gotten to him personally, he had never had practical experience with it, and his resistance to such experiences, a taste resistance, an aesthetic resistance, a resistance of human pride - if we may use such pretentious terms in regard to our thoroughly undemanding hero - almost equaled the curiosity they aroused in him. He felt in advance, felt it clearly and distinctly, that these experiences, however they might continue, could never begin in any other way than insipid, incomprehensible, and humanly undignified. Still, he was dying to do it. He understood that ""idle or sinful,"" bad enough as an alternative, was not an alternative at all, but coincidentally, and that spiritual hopelessness was only the extramoral expression of the forbidden. The placet experiri, however, planted in him by someone who had to vehemently disapprove of such attempts, stuck firmly in Hans Castorp's mind; his morality almost coincided with his curiosity, had probably always done so: with the unconditional curiosity of the educational traveler, which perhaps even when it tasted the mystery of personality was not far removed from the area emerging here, and the one A kind of military character was shown by not avoiding what was forbidden when the opportunity arose. So Hans Castorp decided to be on the lookout and not stand aside if Ellen Brand had any further adventures.","A little chat. Quite so. But nobody felt easy at the word, it was just the sort of word Krokowski the merry comrade used by preference, and it gave them cold shivers. Hans Castorp, as he sought his tardy reclining-chair, remembered the feeling with which he had seen Elly ’s illicit achievements and heard her shamefaced explanation; as though the ground were shifting under his feet, and giving him a slightly qualmish feeling, a mild seasickness. He had never been in an earthquake; but he said to himself that one must “experience a like sensation of unequivocal alarm. But he had also felt great curiosity at these fateful gifts of Ellen Brand; combined, it is true, with the knowledge that their field was with difficulty accessible to the spirit, and the doubt as to whether it was not barren, or even sinful, so far as he was concerned—all which did not prevent his feeling from being what in fact it actually was, curiosity. Like everybody else, Hans Castorp had, at his time of life, heard this and that about the mysteries of nature, or the supernatural. We have mentioned the clairvoyante greataunt, of whom a melancholy tradition had come down. But the world of the supernatural, though theoretically and objectively he had recognized its existence, had never come close to him , he had never had any practical experience of it. And his aversion from it, a matter of taste, an aesthetic revulsion, a reaction of human pride— if we may use such large words in connexion with our modest hero—was almost as great as his curiosity. He felt beforehand, quite clearly, that such experiencess whatever the course of them, could never be anything but in bad taste, unintelligible and humanly valueless. And yet he was on fire to go through them. He was aware that his alternative of “barren” or else “sinful,” bad enough in itself, was in reality not an alternative at all, since the two ideas fell together, and calling a thing spiritually unavailable was only an a-moral way of expressing its forbidden character. But the “placet experiri” planted in Hans Castorp’s mind by one who would surely and resoundingly have reprobated any experimentation at all in this field, was planted firmly enough. By little and little his morality and his curiosity approached and overlapped, or had probably always done so; the pure curiosity of inquiring youth on its travels, which had already brought him pretty close to the forbidden field, what time he tasted the mystery of personality, and for which he had even claimed the justification that it too was almost military in character, in that it did not weakly avoid the forbidden, when it presented itself. Hans Castorp came to the final resolve not to avoid, but to stand his ground if it came to more developments in the case of Ellen Brand.","Chat! They should have known. And yet no one felt all that easy about the word, even if it was a standard word for their cheerful comrade, Dr. Krokowski. Everyone felt the touch of an icy finger deep inside, even Hans Castorp, who was late in finding his way to his splendid lounge chair that evening; he stretched out and recalled how, as he watched Elly’s unseemly achievements and listened to her embarrassed explanation, the ground had shifted under his feet, making him feel a little queasy and anxious all over, like a slight touch of seasickness. He had never been in an earthquake, but he told himself that it most probably evoked similar sensations of unmistakable terror—quite apart from the curiosity that Ellen Brand’s disagreeable talents also awakened in him. It was a curiosity that bore within it a sense of its own ultimate hopelessness, that is, an awareness that there were regions to which his mind was forbidden the access it groped to find—giving rise to doubts whether it was simply idle, or perhaps sinful curiosity, which did not, however, prevent it from being what it was: curiosity. Like everyone else, over the course of his life Hans Castorp had heard one thing or another about arcane. natural, or supernatural, phenomena—there has already been mention made of his clairvoyant great-aunt, whose melancholy story had been passed down to him. But never had that world, to which he would not have denied theoretical and unbiased recognition, pressed in hard upon him; he had no practical experience of it, and the aversion he felt to such experiences (an aversion based on good taste, an aesthetic aversion, an aversion that came with his pride as a human being—if we can apply such pretentious terms to our thoroughly unpretentious hero) was almost equal to the curiosity they aroused in him. He could sense in advance, quite clearly, quite definitely, that however such experiences might develop, they would never seem anything but preposterous, incomprehensible, and lacking in human value. And yet he burned to taste them. He understood that “idle or sinful”—which was bad enough as an alternative—was no alternative at all, that the two coincided, and that to say something was spiritually and intellectually “hopeless” was merely the amoral way of saying it was “forbidden.” And yet the old placet experiri, planted in him by someone who would have most stoutly disapproved of any experiments of this sort, had taken firm root in Hans Castorp’s mind. By now, his morality coincided with his curiosity, probably always had. It was the unconditional curiosity of the tourist thirsty for knowledge; a curiosity that, in having tasted the mystery of personality, had perhaps not been all that far from the realms emerging here; a curiosity that displayed something of a military character by not trying to evade something forbidden if it might offer itself. And so Hans Castorp decided to be on the alert and not to step aside if Ellen Brand should have further adventures."

"»Stütze mich, mein Kind! Stütze mich andererseits, junger Mann!« sagte er zu Frau Chauchat und Hans Castorp. So waren sie seinem schweren Körper beim Aufkommen vom Stuhle behilflich, boten ihm ihre Arme dar, und eingehängt in beide trat er breitbeinig, das mächtige Haupt auf eine seiner hochgezogenen Schultern geneigt und bald den einen, bald den anderen seiner Führer durch die Schwankungen seines Schrittes zur Seite drängend, den Weg zur Ruhe an. Im Grunde war es wohl ein königlicher Luxus, den er sich leistete, indem er sich dieser Art lotsen und stützen ließ. Wahrscheinlich hätte er, wenn es ihm darauf angekommen wäre, auch allein gehen können, – er verschmähte jedoch diese Anstrengung, die ja nur den kleinen und untergeordneten Sinn hätte haben können, seinen Rausch schamhaft zu verbergen, während er sich desselben offenbar nicht nur durchaus nicht schämte, sondern sich im Gegenteil groß und üppig darin gefiel und sich einen königlichen Spaß daraus machte, seine dienenden Führer schwankend nach rechts und links zu stoßen. Er selbst äußerte unterwegs:","""Support me, my child! Support me on the other hand, young man!' he said to Frau Chauchat and Hans Castorp. So they helped his heavy body to get up from the chair, offered him their arms, and hooked in both he stepped legs apart, his mighty head bent on one of his raised shoulders and now one, now the other of his guides through the unsteadiness of his step pushing aside, the way to rest. Basically it was probably a royal luxury that he allowed himself to be guided and supported in this way. He probably could have gone alone if it had mattered to him - but he disdained this exertion, which could only have had the small and subordinate purpose of modestly concealing his intoxication, while he obviously did not admit it at all ashamed, but, on the contrary, reveled in being large and voluptuous in it, and took royal pleasure in swaying his servant leaders to the right and left. He himself said on the way:","“Let me lean upon you, my child! And you, young man, on my other side,” he said. They helped him lift his unwieldy body from table, gave him the support of their arms, and he walked with wide steps between them bedwards, his mighty head sunk on his lifted shoulder. First one and then the other of his aides was carried to one side by his staggering pace. It is probable that he was merely indulging himself in the regal luxury of being thus supported and piloted; presumably he could have gone by himself. But he scorned the effort. If made it would have been solely for the unworthy purpose of disguising his state, and of this he was royally unashamed, revelling in the fun of making his companions stagger with him from side to side. He even said, on the way: “Children—nonsense.","“Assist me, my child. Assist me on the other side, young man,” he said to Frau Chauchat and Hans Castorp. And so the two of them helped him heave his ponderous body out of the chair and now offered their arms; linked together with them, he walked, or staggered, down the path toward bed, with legs spread wide and mighty head tilted toward one raised shoulder, lurching now toward one of his escorts and now toward the other. In allowing them to support and pilot him, he was in fact treating himself to a kind of regal luxury. Presumably, had it been necessary, he could have walked on his own—he disdained such an effort, however, which could have served only one small, inferior purpose: to hide his drunkenness out of embarrassment. And he was evidently not in the least embarrassed by it; on the contrary, he luxuriated grandly in it and took royal delight in jostling his escorts to the right or left as he tottered along."
"»Gott,« sagte er, »sie scheinen mir nicht sehr interessant. An den anderen Tischen sitzen, glaube ich, interessantere, aber das kommt einem vielleicht nur so vor. Frau Stöhr sollte sich das Haar waschen lassen, es ist so fett. Und diese Mazurka da, oder wie sie heißt, kommt mir etwas albern vor. Immer muß sie sich das Taschentuch in den Mund stopfen vor lauter Kichern.«","'God,' he said, 'they don't seem very interesting to me. I think the other tables are more interesting, but that might just seem like it. Frau Stohr should have her hair washed, it's so greasy. And that mazurka there, or whatever it's called, seems a bit silly to me. She always has to stuff her handkerchief into her mouth from giggling.”","“Dear me,” he said, “I don’t find them so very interesting. Some of the people at the other tables look more so, but that may be only seeming. Frau Stöhr ought to have her hair shampooed, it is so greasy.

"»Das haben Sie dankenswert richtig unterschieden und angeordnet«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Vierzehntes?« versicherte er sich … »Dreizehnhundertsoundso?

I didn't really know anything about it, I'm a man of technical progress, as far as I'm concerned. But up here the idea of the Middle Ages has been brought to my attention in various ways. Economic social theory did not exist at that time, that much is clear. What was the artist's name?'","“We are most grateful to you for making these distinctions clear,” Hans Castorp said. “Fourteenth century?” he inquired of himself; “that means thirteen hundred soand-so? Yes, that is the Middle Ages, the way the books say; and I can more or less recognize in this thing the conception I have been getting of them lately. I never knew anything about the Middle Ages before, myself, being on the technical side. But up here they have been brought home to me in various ways. There was no economic doctrine of society then, that’s plain enough. What is the name of the artist?”","“How kind of you to define and differentiate the matter so clearly,” Hans Castorp said. “Fourteenth?” he inquired, just to be sure. “Thirteen hundred and something? Yes, perfect textbook Middle Ages—I see in it, as it were, some notions about the Middle Ages that I’ve been working on of late myself. Actually, I never knew anything about the period. I’m a man of technology and progress, to the extent my opinions count in this world. But up here the whole issue of the Middle Ages has been brought home to me in various ways.

"Ein Mann in Livree, mit Tressenmütze, sah zu, wie sie einander – der junge Ziemßen in militärischer Haltung – rasch und ein bißchen verlegen die Hände schüttelten, und kam dann heran, um sich Hans Castorps Gepäckschein auszubitten; denn er war der Concierge des Internationalen Sanatoriums »Berghof« und zeigte sich willens, den großen Koffer des Gastes vom Bahnhof »Platz« zu holen, indes die Herren direkt mit dem Wagen zum Abendbrot fuhren. Der Mann hinkte auffallend, und so war das erste, was Hans Castorp Joachim Ziemßen fragte:","A man in livery, with a trefoil cap, watched them - young Ziemssen in a military bearing - shake hands quickly and a little embarrassed, and then came up to ask Hans Castorp's luggage tag; for he was the concierge of the international sanatorium ""Berghof"" and showed himself willing to fetch the guest's large suitcase from the ""Platz"" train station, while the gentlemen drove straight to supper in the car. The man limped conspicuously, and so the first thing Hans Castorp asked Joachim Ziemßen was:","A man in livery with a braided cap looked on while they shook hands, quickly, not without embarrassment, young Ziemssen in military position, heels together.

This man limped noticeably; and so, curiously enough, the first thing Hans Castorp said to his cousin was: “Is that a war veteran?","They quickly shook hands with some embarrassment—young Ziemssen never losing his military bearing—watched all the while by a man in livery with a braided cap, who then approached and asked Hans Castorp for his baggage ticket; this was the concierge of the International Sanatorium Berghof, and he proved quite willing to fetch the guest’s large trunk from the station at Davos-Platz while the gentlemen themselves drove on ahead to dinner.

"Dies alles fand der junge Hans Castorp hörenswert, zwar unverbindlicherweise und mehr zum Versuch, doch hörenswert auf alle Fälle fand er, daß es sei, und sprach sich in diesem Sinne auch gegen Joachim Ziemßen darüber aus, der aber gerade das Thermometer im Munde hatte und also nur undeutlich antworten konnte, danach auch allzu beschäftigt war, die Ziffer abzulesen und in die Tabelle einzutragen, um sich zu Settembrinis Aspekten äußern zu können. Hans Castorp, wie wir sagten, nahm gutwillig Kenntnis davon und öffnete ihnen zur Prüfung sein Inneres: woraus vor allem erhellt, wie vorteilhaft der wachende Mensch sich von dem blöde träumenden unterscheidet, – als welcher Hans Castorp Herrn Settembrini schon mehrmals ins Gesicht hinein einen Drehorgelmann geschimpft und ihn aus allen Kräften von der Stelle zu drängen versucht hatte, weil er »hier störe«; als Wachender aber hörte er ihm höflich und aufmerksam zu und suchte rechtlich gesinnt die Widerstände auszugleichen und niederzuhalten, die sich gegen des Mentors Anordnungen und Darstellungen in ihm erheben wollten. Denn daß gewisse Widerstände in seiner Seele sich regten, soll nicht geleugnet werden: es waren solche, die von früher her, ursprünglich und immer schon darin vorhanden gewesen, wie auch solche, die sich aus der gegenwärtigen Sachlage besonders ergaben, aus seinen teils mittelbaren, teils verschwiegenen Erlebnissen bei Denen hier oben.","The young Hans Castorp found all this worth hearing, admittedly without obligation and more as an experiment, but he thought it was worth hearing in any case, and spoke in this sense also against Joachim Ziemßen about it, who just had the thermometer in his mouth and so could only answer vaguely, and then was too busy reading the number and entering it in the table to be able to comment on Settembrini's aspects. Hans Castorp, as we said, willingly took note of it and opened his heart to them for examination: from which it becomes clear above all how advantageously the waking person differs from the stupid dreaming one - as which Hans Castorp has repeatedly punched Mr. Settembrini in the face with a barrel organ had scolded him and tried to push him from the spot with all his might because he was ""disrupting here""; as a watcher, however, he listened to him politely and attentively and tried to balance and suppress the resistance that wanted to rise up in him against the mentor's instructions and representations in a legally minded manner. For the fact that certain resistances arose in his soul should not be denied: there were some that had existed in the past, originally and had always been there, as well as some that arose from the current state of affairs, from his partly indirect, partly concealed experiences with those up here.","Well, all that young Hans Castorp found worth listening to; not precisely overwhelming, of a value largely experimental, but still worth listening to. He said as much to Joachim Ziemssen later; but Joachim had his thermometer in his mouth and could not reply to his cousin; nor had he afterwards leisure, when, on taking it out, he read the figure and entered it in his note-book. But Hans Castorp good-naturedly took cognizance of Settembrini’s point of view and tested by it his own inner experiences; from which self-examination it principally appeared that the waking man has an advantage over the sleeping and dreaming one. For whereas the sleeping Hans Castorp had more than once upbraided the organ-grinder to his face and done his utmost to drive him away because he felt him a disturbing influence, the waking one lent him an attentive ear and made an honest effort to minimize the opposition which his mentor’s ideas and conceptions persistently aroused in him. For it cannot be denied that there was such opposition; some of it such as he must always have felt from the very beginning, the rest arising from the particular situation and his partly vicarious, partly secret and personal experiences among “those up here.”","Young Hans Castorp found all this well worth listening to—not that he was obliged to, of course, it was more an experiment—but in any case, well worth listening to, and he said as much to Joachim Ziemssen, who had just stuck a thermometer in his mouth and so could only mumble a reply and then became too involved in reading the numbers and entering them on his chart to be able to comment on Settembrini’s views. Hans Castorp, as we have said, took note of them in his kindhearted way and he opened himself to them as a way of testing them—from which it became particularly clear that the waking Hans Castorp was a very different person from the fatuously dreaming Hans Castorp, who had called Settembrini an “organ-grinder” to his face and tried with all his might to push him out of the way because he was “bothering” him. Awake, however, he listened to him politely and attentively and tried to be fair, compensating for or suppressing feelings that he felt rising in opposition to his mentor’s opinions and characterizations. For it cannot be denied that opposition was stirring in his soul—both the sort that had always been there naturally from the start and the sort that arose specifically from the present situation, partly from indirect observation, partly from personal experience among these people up here."
"»Ah, Krokowski!« rief Settembrini. »Dort geht er und weiß alle Geheimnisse unserer Damen. Man bittet, die feine Symbolik seiner Kleidung zu beachten. Er trägt sich schwarz, um anzudeuten, daß sein eigenstes Studiengebiet die Nacht ist. Dieser Mann hat in seinem Kopf nur einen Gedanken, und der ist schmutzig. Ingenieur, wie kommt es, daß wir von ihm noch gar nicht gesprochen haben! Sie haben seine Bekanntschaft gemacht?«","""Ah, Krokowski!"" exclaimed Settembrini. 'There he goes, knowing all the secrets of our ladies. One asks to note the subtle symbolism of his clothing. He wears black to indicate that his primary field of study is the night. This man has only one thought in his head, and it's dirty. Engineer, how come we haven't spoken of him yet! You made his acquaintance?”","“Ah, Krokowski,” Settembrini cried. “There he goes—he who knows all the secrets in the bosoms of our ladies—pray observe the delicate symbolism of his attire: he wears black to indicate that his proper field of study is the night. The man has but one idea in his head, and that a smutty one. How does it happen, Engineer, that we have not spoken of him until now? You have made his acquaintance?”","“Ah, Krokowski,” Settembrini exclaimed. “There he goes, filled with all the secrets of our ladies. I beg you, please regard the delicate symbolism of his garb. He wears black to indicate that his particular specialty is the night. The man has but one thought in his head, and it is a filthy one. My good engineer, how is it that we have not yet spoken of the man? Have you made his acquaintance?”"
"»Das ist die Luft und hat nichts zu sagen. Behrens selbst hat den ganzen Tag blaue Backen. Manche gewöhnen sich nie. Na, go on, wir kriegen sonst nichts mehr zu essen.«","'This is the air and has nothing to say. Behrens himself has bruised cheeks all day. Some never get used to it. Well, go on, we won't get anything else to eat.""","Joachim did not take up the offer, but merely said: “That is the air—it doesn’t mean anything; Behrens himself is purple in the face all day long. Some people never get used to it. Come along now, do, or we shan’t get anything to eat.”","Joachim did not acknowledge it, but merely said, “It’s the air here, it doesn’t mean anything. Behrens himself walks around with purple cheeks all day. Some people never get used to it. Well, come on now, or we’ll not get anything to eat.”"
"Und da die Lehrerin den Verweis demütig lächelnd einsteckte, als sei sie selber die Schuldige, so war nicht weiter die Rede von Madame Chauchat. –","And since the teacher accepted the reprimand, smiling humbly, as if she herself were to blame, Madame Chauchat was no longer mentioned. –","And on the schoolmistress’s meekly accepting this reproof as though she herself had been the guilty party, there was no more talk of Madame Chauchat.","But since the teacher meekly accepted his rebuke as if she were the guilty party, nothing more was said about Madame Chauchat."
"Indes er sich die Hände trocknete, trat er mit gepuderten Backen, in seiner fil d’écosse-Unterhose und roten Saffian-Pantoffeln auf den Balkon hinaus, der durchlief und nur vermittelst undurchsichtiger, nicht ganz bis zum Geländer vortretender Glaswände in einzelne Zimmerbereiche geteilt war. Der Morgen war kühl und wolkig. Gestreckte Nebelbänke lagen unbeweglich vor den seitlichen Höhen, während massiges Gewölk, weißes und graues, auf das fernere Gebirge niederhing. Flecken und Streifen von Himmelsblau waren hie und da sichtbar, und wenn ein Sonnenblick einfiel, schimmerte die Ortschaft im Talgrunde weiß gegen die dunklen Fichtenwälder der Hänge. Irgendwo gab es Morgenmusik, wahrscheinlich in demselben Hotel, wo man auch gestern abend Konzert gehabt hatte. Choral-Akkorde klangen gedämpft herüber, nach einer {62}Pause folgte ein Marsch, und Hans Castorp, der Musik von Herzen liebte, da sie ganz ähnlich auf ihn wirkte, wie sein Frühstücksporter, nämlich tief beruhigend, betäubend, zum Dösen überredend, lauschte wohlgefällig, den Kopf auf die Seite geneigt, mit offenem Munde und etwas geröteten Augen.","While he was drying his hands, he stepped out onto the balcony with powdered cheeks, in his fil d'écosse underpants and red morocco slippers, which ran through and was divided into individual room areas only by means of opaque glass walls that did not quite protrude to the railing . The morning was cool and cloudy. Long banks of fog lay motionless in front of the lateral heights, while heavy clouds, white and gray, hung down over the more distant mountains. Spots and streaks of blue sky were visible here and there, and when a glimpse of the sun shone, the village at the bottom of the valley shimmered white against the dark pine forests on the slopes. There was morning music somewhere, probably in the same hotel where there had been a concert last night. Muted chorale chords sounded across, after a pause a march followed, and Hans Castorp, who loved music very much because it had a very similar effect on him as his breakfast porter, viz. deeply soothing, intoxicating, persuading one to doze off, listened complacent, head tilted to one side, mouth open and eyes somewhat reddened.","With powdered cheeks, in his Scotch-thread drawers and red morocco slippers, he walked out on the balcony, drying his hands. The balcony ran across the house and was divided into small separate compartments by opaque glass partitions, which did not quite reach to the balustrade. The morning was cool and cloudy. Trails of mist lay motionless in front of the heights on one side and the other, while great cloud-masses, grey and white, hung down over the distant peaks. Patches and bands of blue showed here and there; now and then a gleam of sunshine lighted up the village down in the valley, till it glistened whitely against the dark fir-covered slopes. Somewhere there was music, very likely in the same hotel where there had been a concert the evening before. The subdued chords of a hymn floated up; after a pause came a march. Hans Castorp loved music from his heart; it worked upon him in much the same way as did his breakfast porter, with deeply soothing, narcotic effect, tempting him to doze. He listened well pleased, his head on one side, his eyes a little bloodshot.","He powdered his cheeks and slipped into his plaid undershorts and red morocco-leather slippers, and still drying his hands, he stepped out onto the balcony, which, although private, was connected to those adjoining and separated from them only by an opaque glass partition that extended almost to the railing. The morning was cool and cloudy. Long banks of fog lay motionless along the hills to both sides, while masses of clouds, white and gray, were draped on the more distant mountains. Patches and streaks of blue sky were visible here and there, and when a ray of sun broke through, the village in the valley below glistened white against the dark forests of pine on the slopes. Somewhere morning music was playing; presumably it came from the same hotel where the concert had been held the evening before. Muted chords of a chorale drifted toward him; a march followed after a brief pause. Hans Castorp loved music with all his heart, its effect being much like that of the porter he drank with his morning snack—profoundly calming, numbing, and “doze”-inducing—and he listened now with pleasure, his head tilted to one side, mouth open, eyes slightly bloodshot. He looked down at the winding road they had followed up to the sanatorium the evening before."
"Aber das war ja erklärter Wahnsinn! Ein so wunderherrliches Lied!

Pure masterpiece, born from the last and most sacred depths of the people's mind; a supreme possession, the archetype of intimacy, kindness itself!

"Joachim verabschiedete sich zur Mahlzeit. Das Essen wurde gebracht. Das Tal hatte sich längst mit Schatten gefüllt, und während Hans Castorp aß, dunkelte es zusehens im weißen Zimmer. Er saß, wenn er fertig war, in sein Plumeau gelehnt, vor dem abgegessenen Tischleindeckdich und blickte in die rasch zunehmende Dämmerung, die Dämmerung von heute, die von der gestrigen, vorgestrigen oder der vor acht Tagen nur schwer zu unterscheiden war. Es war Abend, – nachdem es eben noch Morgen gewesen. Der zerkleinerte und künstlich kurzweilig gemachte Tag war ihm buchstäblich unter den Händen {293}zerbröckelt und zunichte geworden, wie er mit heiterer Verwunderung oder allenfalls nachdenklich bemerkte; denn Grauen hiervor war seinen Jahren noch fremd. Ihm war nur, als blicke er »immer noch«.","Joachim said goodbye to the meal. The food was brought. The valley had long since been filled with shadows, and while Hans Castorp ate, it grew noticeably darker in the white room. When he was done, he would sit leaning against his quilt in front of the table setting he had eaten and staring into the rapidly increasing twilight, today's twilight, which was difficult to distinguish from yesterday, the day before, or a week ago. It was evening - after it had just been morning. The crushed and artificially entertaining day had literally crumbled in his hands and wasted, as he remarked with cheerful astonishment or at most thoughtfully; for horror of this was still alien to his years. It only seemed to him that he was ""still"" looking.","Joachim, on his way to the evening meal, stopped to say goodbye. Hans Castorp’s tray was brought. The valley had long since filled with shadow, and darkened apace as he ate. When he had done, he leaned back against his down quilt, with the magic table cleared before him, and looked into the growing dusk, to-day’s dusk, yet scarcely distinguishable from the dusk of yesterday or last week. It was evening—and had just been morning. The day, artificially shortened, broken into small bits, had literally crumbled in his hands and was reduced to nothing: he remarked it to himself with a start—or, at any rate, he did at least remark; for to shudder at it was foreign to his years. It seemed to him that from the beginning of time he had been lying and looking thus.","Joachim would look in before leaving for supper. His own tray would be brought in. The valley would long since have filled with shadows, and while Hans Castorp ate, it would grow discernibly darker in the white room. When he had finished, he would sit there propped up against his pillows, his empty dishes and his magic table before him, and gaze out into the quickly falling dusk—today’s dusk, which was hardly distinguishable from yesterday’s, or the dusk of the day before yesterday, or of a week ago. There was evening—and there had just been morning. The day, chopped into little pieces by all these synthetic diversions, had in fact crumbled in his hands, and turned to dust— and he would notice it now, either in cheerful amazement or, at worst, with a little pensiveness, since to shudder at the thought would have been inappropriate to his young years. It seemed to him that he was simply gazing, “on and on.”"

"{349}Schlicht gesagt, war unser Reisender nun also über beide Ohren in Clawdia Chauchat verliebt, – wir gebrauchen nochmals dies Wort, da wir dem Mißverständnis, das es erregen könnte, hinlänglich vorgebeugt zu haben meinen. Freundlich gemütvolle Wehmut im Geist jenes Liedchens war es also nicht, was das Wesen seiner Verliebtheit ausmachte. Vielmehr war das eine ziemlich riskierte und unbehauste Abart dieser Betörung, aus Frost und Hitze gemischt wie das Befinden eines Febrilen oder wie ein Oktobertag in oberen Sphären; und was fehlte, war eben ein gemüthaftes Mittel, das ihre extremen Bestandteile verbunden hätte. Sie bezog sich einerseits mit einer Unmittelbarkeit, die den jungen Mann erblassen ließ und seine Gesichtszüge verzerrte, auf Frau Chauchats Knie und die Linie ihres Beines, auf ihren Rücken, ihre Nackenwirbel und ihre Oberarme, von denen die kleine Brust zusammengepreßt wurde, – mit einem Worte auf ihren Körper, ihren lässigen und gesteigerten, durch die Krankheit ungeheuer betonten und noch einmal zum Körper gemachten Körper. Und sie war andererseits etwas äußerst Flüchtiges und Ausgedehntes, ein Gedanke, nein, ein Traum, der schreckhafte und grenzenlos verlockende Traum eines jungen Mannes, dem auf bestimmte, wenn auch unbewußt gestellte Fragen nur ein hohles Schweigen geantwortet hatte. Wie jedermann, nehmen wir das Recht in Anspruch, uns bei der hier laufenden Erzählung unsere privaten Gedanken zu machen, und wir äußern die Mutmaßung, daß Hans Castorp die für seinen Aufenthalt bei Denen hier oben ursprünglich angesetzte Frist nicht einmal bis zu dem gegenwärtig erreichten Punkt überschritten hätte, wenn seiner schlichten Seele aus den Tiefen der Zeit über Sinn und Zweck des Lebensdienstes eine irgendwie befriedigende Auskunft zuteil geworden wäre.","{349}Put simply, our traveler was now head over heels in love with Clawdia Chauchat - we use this word again, as we think we have sufficiently averted the misunderstanding which it might arouse. So it wasn't a friendly, heartfelt melancholy in the spirit of that little song that made up the essence of his infatuation. Rather, it was a rather risky and homeless variety of this infatuation, mixed of chill and heat like the condition of a febrile, or like an October day in the upper spheres; and what was missing was a sentimental means that would have connected its extreme components. She referred, on the one hand, with an immediacy that made the young man pale and distorted his features, to Mrs. Chauchat's knees and the line of her leg, to her back, to her cervical vertebrae, and to her upper arms, which were squeezing her small breasts—with a Words on her body, her relaxed and intensified body, enormously stressed by the illness and once more made into a body. And it was, on the other hand, something extremely fleeting and vast, a thought, no, a dream, the frightening and infinitely alluring dream of a young man whose definite, if unconsciously asked, questions had been answered only by hollow silence. Like everyone else, we claim the right to have our private thoughts about the narrative going on here, and we express the conjecture that Hans Castorp has not even reached the present point in time for his stay with those above would have transcended if his humble soul from the depths of time about the meaning and purpose of life's service had somehow been given satisfactory information.","In brief, our traveller was now over head and ears in love with Clavdia Chauchat— we may still use the phrase, since we have already obviated any possible misunderstanding on the score of it. We have seen that the essence of his passion was something quite other than the tender and pensive mood of that oft-quoted ditty: rather it was a wild and vagrant variation upon the lovesick lute, it was mingled frost and fire, like the state of a fever patient, or the October air in these high altitudes. What he actually lacked, in fact, was an emotional bridge between two extremes. On the one hand his passion dwelt, with an immediacy that left the young man pale and staring, upon Frau Chauchat’s knee, the line of her thigh, her back, her neck-bone, her arms that pressed together her little breasts—in a word, it dwelt upon her body, her idle, accentuated body, exaggerated by disease and rendered twice over body. And, on the other hand, it was something in the highest degree fleeting and tenuous; a thought, nay, a dream, the frightful, infinitely alluring dream of a young man whose unspoken, unconscious questioning of the universe has received no answer save a hollow silence. We have as much right as the next person to our private thoughts about the story we are relating; and we would here hazard the surmise that young Hans Castorp would never have overstepped so far the limits originally fixed for his stay if to his simple soul there might have been vouchsafed, out of the depth of his time, any reasonably satisfying explanation of the meaning and purpose of man’s life.","To put it simply, our traveler had fallen head over heels in love with Clavdia Chauchat—we use the term “love,” whereas we have thus far spoken of infatuation, because we believe we have taken sufficient precautions to prevent any misunderstandings its use might cause. The constituent element of his love, therefore, was not the amiable, tender melancholy found in our little song. It was, instead, a rather reckless and unpolished variation of this folly, a fusion of frost and heat, like a man in a fever or an October day in these lofty regions. What he lacked was the emotion that might have united the two extremes. On the one hand, his love was caught up—and with such an immediacy that it could make the young man blanch and grimace—in Frau Chauchat’s knee, the contour of her leg, her back, the nape of her neck, her upper arms and the way they pressed her small breasts together, in brief, caught up in her body, her careless body, so accentuated and vastly enhanced by her illness that it was a second embodiment of her body. And on the other hand, his love was something utterly elusive and amorphous, a thought—no, a dream, the terrifying and infinitely seductive dream of a young man whose answer to certain, though subconsciously posed questions would have been only hollow silence. We have as much right as anyone to private thoughts about the story unfolding here, and we would like to suggest that Hans Castorp would not have stayed with the people up here even this long beyond his originally planned date of departure, if only some sort of satisfactory answer about the meaning and purpose of life had been supplied to his prosaic soul from out of the depths of time."
"Eine spöttische Prophezeiung vom Faschingsabend war eingetroffen: Hans Castorp hatte eine schlechte Fieberlinie gehabt, in steiler Zacke, die er mit einem Gefühl von Festlichkeit eingezeichnet, war seine Kurve damals emporgestiegen und, {530}nach einigem Absinken, als Hochplateau fortgelaufen, das sich, nur leicht gewellt, dauernd über der Ebene des bisher Gewohnten hielt. Es war eine Übertemperatur, deren Höhe und Hartnäckigkeit nach des Hofrats Aussage zu dem lokalen Befund in keinem rechten Verhältnis stand. »Sind eben doch vergifteter, als man Ihnen zutrauen sollte, Freundchen«, sagte er. »Na, greifen wir mal zu den Injektionen! Das wird Ihnen anschlagen. In drei, vier Monaten sind Sie wie der Fisch im Wasser, wenn es nach dem Unterfertigten geht.« So kam es, daß Hans Castorp nun zweimal die Woche, am Mittwoch und Sonnabend gleich nach der Morgenmotion, sich im »Labor« drunten einzufinden hatte, um seine Einspritzung entgegenzunehmen.","A mocking prophecy from the evening of carnival had come true: Hans Castorp had had a bad fever line, in a steep spike, which he marked with a feeling of festivity, his curve had risen at that time and, {530}after some sinking, continued as a high plateau, which, only slightly wavy, constantly above the level of what we were used to. It was an excessive temperature, the level and persistence of which, according to the Hofrat, was disproportionate to the local findings. ""You're more poisoned than you should be given credit for, pal,"" he said. “Well, let's get to the injections! This will hit you. In three or four months you'll be like the fish in the water, according to what was signed.' So it came about that Hans Castorp now had to go downstairs in the 'laboratory' twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays immediately after the morning movement to receive his injection.","One prophecy, indeed, made on that carnival evening, made in mockery, was fulfilled: Hans Castorp’s fever chart did display a sharply rising curve. He marked it down with a feeling of solemnity. Thereafter it fell a trifle, and then ran on, unchanged save for slight undulations, well above its accustomed level. It was fever, the degree and persistency of which, according to the Hofrat, was out of all proportion to the condition of his lung. “H’m, young fellow me lad, you’re more infected than one would take you for,” he said. “We’ll have to come on to the hypos. They’ll serve your turn, or I’m a Dutchman. In three or four months you ought to be as fit as a fiddle.” Thus it came about that Hans Castorp had to produce himself, twice in the week, Monday and Saturday after the morning exercise, down in the “lab,” where he was given his injections.","One mocking prophecy from Mardi Gras had been fulfilled: Hans Castorp’s fever chart had taken a turn for the worse; he had solemnly traced the initial steep, jagged upward curve, the few halting steps back down, and the steady high plateau that undulated gently above its previous standard level. It was a fever which, in its stubbornness and seriousness, was out of all proportion to any medical finding, or so the director said. “More toxic than we gave you credit for, my friend,” he declared. “Well, let’s give injections a try! Those will do the trick. In three or four months you’ll be fit as a fiddle, if the undersigned has anything to do with it.” And so from then on, twice a week, right after his morning constitutional on Wednesday and Saturday, Hans Castorp had to report to the lab for his shot."
"»Latini, Carducci, Ratzi-Mausi-Falli, laß mich in Frieden!«","""Latini, Carducci, Ratzi-Mausi-Falli, leave me alone!""","For despite his keepsake, the macabre trophy he wore next his heart, he leaned upon Herr","He muttered to himself, “Latini, Carducci, bibbi-boobi-trappi, just leave me in peace!”"
"»Hören Sie, Ingenieur, was ist Ihnen in die Krone gefahren?« {500}sagte der Italiener, die Augen voller Erstaunen, und verließ gleichfalls den Tisch. »Das klingt wie Abschied …«","""Listen, engineer, what's gotten into your crown?"" {500}said the Italian, his eyes full of astonishment, and he also left the table. ""That sounds like goodbye...""","“Why, Engineer, what has come over you?” the Italian asked in surprise, rising in his turn. “That sounds like a parting.”","“My good engineer, whatever has got into you?” the Italian asked, his eyes full of amazement, rising to leave the table as well. “Those sound like words of farewell.”"
"Es war halb fünf. Was Teufel, so viel war es ja beinahe schon gewesen, als das Wetter losgegangen war. Sollte er glauben, daß sein Herumirren kaum eine Viertelstunde gedauert hatte? »Die Zeit ist mir lang geworden«, dachte er. »Das Umkommen ist langweilig, wie es scheint. Aber um fünf oder halb sechs wird es regelrecht dunkel, das bleibt bestehen. Wird es vorher aufhören, rechtzeitig genug, daß ich vor weiterem Umkommen bewahrt bleibe? Darauf könnte ich einen Schluck Portwein nehmen, zu meiner Stärkung.«","It was four thirty. Hell, it was almost that much when the weather started. Was he to believe that his wandering had barely lasted a quarter of an hour? ""I've had a long time,"" he thought. 'Perishing is boring, it seems. But at five or five-thirty it gets really dark, that stays the same. Will it stop before then, in time to save me from further perishing? Then I could have a sip of port to keep me going.”","It was half past four. But deuce take it, it had been nearly as much before the storm burst. Was it possible his whole bewildered circuit had lasted scarcely a quarter of an hour? “ ‘Coming round’ makes time seem long,” he noted. “And when you don’t ‘ come round’—does it seem longer? But the fact remains that at five or half past it will be regularly dark. Will the storm hold up in time to keep me from running in circles again? Suppose I take a sip of port—it might strengthen me.”","It was half past four. What the devil—it had been almost that late when the storm first broke. Was he supposed to believe that his confused wanderings had lasted barely one quarter of an hour? “Time has slowed down for me,” he thought. “Passing on is boring, it seems. But it will be fully dark by five or five-thirty, that much is certain. Will it stop before then, stop in time to keep me from passing on even more? I could drink a sip of port to that—just to fortify myself a little.”"
"»Nehmen Sie sich zusammen, Wehsal, und reden Sie nicht so niederträchtig!« verwies ihn Hans Castorp. »Frauen lächeln bei jeder Gelegenheit, nur um des Lächelns willen; es ist nutzlos, sich jedesmal Gedanken darüber zu machen. Was krümmen Sie sich immer so? Sie haben, wie wir alle, Ihre Vorzüge und Nachteile. Zum Beispiel spielen Sie sehr hübsch aus dem ›Sommernachtstraum‹, das kann nicht jeder. Sie sollten es nächstens mal wieder tun.«","""Pull yourself together, Wehsal, and don't talk so meanly!"" Hans Castorp reprimanded him. “Women smile at every opportunity just for the sake of smiling; it's useless to worry about it every time. Why are you always squirming like that? Like all of us, you have your advantages and disadvantages. For example, you play very nicely from ›A Midsummer Night's Dream‹, not everyone can do that. You should do it again next time.""","“Pull yourself together, Wehsal, and stop talking in that poor-spirited way,” Hans Castorp admonished him. “Women are for ever smiling, at anything, just for the sake of smiling; there is no sense in attending to it. Why do you always cry yourself down? You have your advantages and your disadvantages, like the rest of us. For instance, you can play out of the Midsummer Night’s Dream, and it’s not everybody who can. Will you play for us again soon’ “","“Pull yourself together, Wehsal, and refrain from such ugly comments,” Hans Castorp rebuked him. “Women smile on all sorts of occasions, just to smile. It is pointless to worry about it every time. Why are you forever cringing and writhing? Like all of us, you have your good points and your bad. For example, you play the music of Summer Night’s Dream very prettily, and not everyone can do that. You must play it again soon.”"
"Unter diesen Klängen also war, so hörte Hans Castorp, ein Taschentuch selbsttätig, oder vielmehr von einer in seinen Falten verborgenen »Klaue« geführt, vom Boden aufgestiegen, des Doktors Papierkorb hatte sich schwebend zur Decke erhoben, der Perpendikel einer Wanduhr war »von niemandem« abwechselnd angehalten und wieder in Gang gesetzt, eine Tischglocke »genommen« und geläutet worden und dergleichen trü{1013}be Nichtigkeiten mehr. Der gelehrte Versuchsleiter war in der glücklichen Lage, diese Leistungen mit einem griechischen Namen voll wissenschaftlichen Anstandes zu treffen. Es waren, so erläuterte er in seinen Vorträgen und in Privatgesprächen »telekinetische« Erscheinungen, Fälle von Fernbewegung; und der Doktor ordnete sie einem Gebiet von Phänomenen zu, das die Wissenschaft auf den Namen der Materialisation getauft hatte, und auf das sein Sinnen und Trachten bei den Versuchen mit Ellen Brand eigentlich gerichtet war.","Among these sounds, Hans Castorp heard, a handkerchief had risen from the floor by itself, or rather guided by a ""claw"" hidden in its folds, the doctor's wastepaper basket had soared to the ceiling, the pendulum of a wall clock was ""from nobody ' alternately stopped and started again, a table bell 'taken' and rang and such dull nothing more. The learned experimenter was in the fortunate position of being able to describe these achievements with a Greek name full of scientific decency. They were, as he explained in his lectures and in private conversations, ""telekinetic"" phenomena, cases of long-distance movement; and the doctor assigned them to a field of phenomena that science had dubbed materialization, and to which his thoughts and aspirations in the experiments with Ellen Brand were actually directed.","To their accompaniment, Hans Castorp learned, a handkerchief had been lifted from the floor, of its own motion, or, rather, that of the “hidden hand” in its folds. The doctor’s waste-paper-basket had risen to the ceiling; the pendulum of a clock been alternately stopped and set going again “without anyone touching it,” a table-bell “taken” and rung—these and a good many other turbid and meaningless phenomena. The learned master of ceremonies was in the happy position of being able to characterize them by a Greek word, very scientific and impressive. They were, so he explained in his lectures and in private conversations, “telekinetic” phenomena, cases of movement from a distance; he associated them with a class of manifestations which were scientifically known as materializations, and toward which his plans and attempts with Elly Brand were directed.","To these strains, then, or so Hans Castorp was told, a handkerchief had spontaneously sprung into action, or better, had risen from the floor, controlled by a “claw” hidden within its folds; the doctor’s wastepaper basket had ascended to the ceiling and hovered there; the pendulum of a wall clock had been alternately held back by “no one” and then set in motion again; a serving bell had been “picked up” and rung—a whole series of these and other murky, trivial goings-on. The learned conductor of these experiments was put in the happy situation of supplying a Greek name, replete with scientific decorum, to these feats. They were, so he explained in lectures and private conversations, “telekinetic” events, movements of objects from place to place; the doctor included them in a range of phenomena that science had baptized with the name of “materialization,” and it was to these events that all his aspirations were directed in his experiments with Ellen Brand."
"Ein wenig krank war sie heraufgekommen, – krank immerhin, denn sonst wäre sie nicht gekommen, nicht ganz leicht vielleicht sogar, aber eher leicht als schwer. Der Pneumothorax, diese noch junge und rasch zu großer Beliebtheit gelangte Errungenschaft der chirurgischen Technik, hatte sich auch in ihrem Falle glänzend bewährt. Der Eingriff war vollkommen gelungen, Frau Zimmermanns Zustand und Befinden machte die erfreulichsten Fortschritte, ihr Mann – denn sie war verheiratet, wenn auch kinderlos – durfte sie in drei bis vier Monaten zurückerwarten. Da machte sie, um sich zu amüsieren, einen Ausflug nach Zürich, – es lag kein anderer Grund vor für diese Reise als der des Amüsements. Sie hatte sich auch amüsiert nach Herzenslust, war aber dabei der Notwendigkeit innegeworden, sich auffüllen zu lassen und hatte mit diesem Geschäft einen dortigen Arzt betraut. Ein netter, komischer junger Mensch, hahaha, hahaha, aber was war geschehen? Er hatte sie überfüllt! Es gab keine andere Bezeichnung dafür, das Wort sagte alles. Er hatte es zu gut mit ihr gemeint, hatte die Sache wohl nicht so recht verstanden, und kurz und gut: in überfülltem Zustande, das heißt unter Herzbeklemmungen und Atemnot – ha! hihihi – war sie hier oben wieder eingetroffen und von Behrens, der mordsmäßig gewettert hatte, {466}sofort ins Bett gesteckt worden. Denn nun sei sie schwerkrank, – nicht hochgradig eigentlich, aber verpfuscht, verpatzt, – hahaha, sein Gesicht, was er denn für ein komisches Gesicht mache? Und sie lachte, indem sie mit dem Finger hineindeutete, so sehr über dies Gesicht, daß nun auch ihre Stirn sich blau zu färben begann. Aber am allerkomischsten, sagte sie, sei Behrens mit seinem Gewetter und seiner Grobheit, – schon im voraus habe sie darüber lachen müssen, als sie gemerkt habe, daß sie überfüllt sei. »Sie schweben in absoluter Lebensgefahr«, habe er sie angeschrien ohne Umschweife und Einkleidung, so ein Bär, hahaha, hihihi, entschuldigen Sie.","She had come up a little ill - ill at least, because otherwise she would not have come, perhaps not quite lightly, but rather lightly than heavily. The pneumothorax, an achievement of surgical technique that was still young and quickly attained great popularity, had also proved brilliant in her case. The operation was a complete success, Mrs. Zimmermann's condition and health made the most gratifying progress, her husband - because she was married, albeit childless - could expect her back in three to four months. So she made a trip to Zurich to amuse herself - there was no other reason for this trip than that of amusement. She had also been amused to her heart's content, but, realizing the need to have herself filled up, had entrusted the business to a local doctor. A nice, funny young person, hahaha, hahaha, but what happened? He had overflowed them! There was no other word for it, the word said it all. He had meant too well with her, had probably not really understood the matter, and in short: in an overflowing state, that is, with oppressed heart and shortness of breath - ha! hihihi – she had come back up here and was immediately put to bed by Behrens, who had thundered furiously. Because now she is seriously ill - not seriously, actually, but messed up, screwed up - hahaha, his face, what kind of funny face is he making? And she laughed, pointing at it with her finger, so hard at that face that her forehead also began to turn blue. But the funniest thing of all, she said, was Behrens with his storm and his rudeness - she had to laugh about it beforehand when she noticed that she was overcrowded. ""Your life is in absolute danger,"" he shouted at her outright, such a bear, hahaha, hehehe, excuse me.","She had come up a little ill— well, ill, of course, for otherwise she would not have come; perhaps not quite a slight case, but rather slight than grave. The pneumothorax, that newest triumph of modern surgical technique, so rapidly become popular, had been brilliantly successful in her case. She made most gratifying progress, her condition was entirely satisfactory. Her husband—for she was married, though childless—might hope to have her home again in three or four months. Then, to divert herself, she made a trip to Zürich—there had been no other reason for her going, save simply to amuse herself—she had amused herself to her heart’s content, but found herself overtaken by the need to be “filled up” again and entrusted the business to a physician where she was. A nice, amusing young man—but what was the result? Here she was overtaken by a perfect paroxysm of laughter. He had filled her too full! There were no other words to describe it, that said it all. He had meant too well by her , he had probably not too well understood the technique; the long and short of it was, in that condition, not able to breathe, suffering from cardiac depression, she had come back—ah, ha, ha, ha! and Behrens, cursing and storming with a vengeance, had stuck her into bed. For now she was ill indeed, not actually in high fever, but finished, done, made a mess of—oh, what a face he was making, how funny he looked, ha, ha, ha! She pointed at Hans Castorp and laughed so hard that even her brow grew blue. The funniest thing of all, she said, was the way Behrens raved and reviled—it had made her laugh, at first, when she discovered that she was overfilled. “You are in absolute danger of your life,” he had bellowed at her, just like that, without making any bones of it. “What a bear—ah, ha, ha, ha!—you really must please forgive me.”","She had come up here only slightly ill—but ill, all the same, otherwise she would never have come; perhaps more than just slightly, but closer to that than seriously ill. Pneumothorax—the new surgical technique that had quickly gained such widespread popularity—had proved marvelously effective in her case. The operation had been a complete success; Frau Zimmermann’s condition had improved most gratifyingly. Her husband—for she was married, though she had no children—was told he could expect her home in three to four months. And so, just for the fun of it, she had made a little trip to Zurich—for no other reason than to amuse herself. And she had done so to her heart’s content; meanwhile, however, she became aware that she needed a refill and had entrusted a local doctor with the job. A nice, funny young man—ha ha ha, ha ha ha—and what had happened? He had overblown her! There was no other way to put it, the word itself said it all. He had meant well, too well, but had not really understood his task. The upshot was that she had come back up here in an overblown state, with constriction of the heart and shortness of breath—ha! hee hee hee— and Behrens had sworn like a trooper and sent her straight to bed. Because she was now seriously ill—not a patient of highest rank, but one whose case was botched and bungled. Ha ha ha—look at his face, what a funny face! And pointing a finger at Hans Castorp, she laughed so hard at the face he was making that her forehead began to turn purple. But the funniest thing of all, she said, had been the way Behrens had turned the air blue with his ranting and raving. From the moment she had realized she was overblown, just picturing what he would do had set her laughing. “You are literally hovering between life and death,” he had shouted, not bothering to mince words. What a bear he was—ha ha ha, hee hee hee—Herr Carsten really must excuse her."
"O Scham unserer Schattensicherheit! Hinweg! Wir erzählen das nicht! Ist unser Bekannter getroffen? Er meinte einen Augenblick, es zu sein.

No more!—But our friend? Was he hit? He thought so, for the moment. A great clod of earth struck him on the shin, it hurt, but he smiles at it.

"»Nein, wozu?« sagte er. »Ich schreibe nie Briefe. An wen wohl? Höchst selten mal eine Karte, die gleich frankiert ist. An wen sollte ich wohl Briefe schreiben? Ich habe niemanden.

So steht es mit mir.«","""No, what for?"" he said. 'I never write letters. To whom? Rarely a card with the same postage. Who should I write letters to? I have no one.

I never write a letter. To whom should I write? I seldom do, even a card, and that is already stamped. I have no one to write to. I have no contact with the flat-land, it has fallen away.

At most a postcard now and then, and they’re prestamped. To whom should I be writing letters? I have no feeling whatever for the flatlands anymore, I’ve lost that somehow. We had a folk song in school, that went, ‘The world is lost to me now.’ That’s how it is with me.”"
"»O ja, energisch auch, doch, sehr energisch«, sagte Hans Castorp. Er prüfte die heimatliche Lebensstimmung aus der Entfernung und fand, daß sein Unterredner sie richtig kennzeichne. »Phlegmatisch und energisch, so sind sie wohl.«","""Oh yes, energetic too, yes, very energetic,"" said Hans Castorp. He examined the mood of life at home from a distance and found that his interlocutor characterized it correctly. ""Phlegmatic and energetic, that's what they are.""","“Oh, yes, very energetic,” said Hans Castorp. He mentally assayed the temper of his native city, and found that his interlocuter had characterized it justly. “Phlegmatic and energetic, yes, I should say they are.”","“Oh yes, energetic, too, very energetic,” Hans Castorp said. From a distance now, he examined life in his homeland and found that his interlocutor had characterized it correctly. “Detached and energetic, you’re probably right there.”"
"Da war eine dritte … Es waren eigentlich wiederum mehrere, zusammengehörig, ineinandergehend, drei oder vier, denn die Tenorarie, die vorkam, nahm allein eine bis zur Mitte beringte Seite für sich in Anspruch. Wieder war das etwas Französisches, aus einer Oper, die Hans Castorp gut kannte, die er wiederholt im Theater gehört und gesehen und auf deren {981}Handlung er einmal sogar gesprächsweise – und zwar in einem sehr entscheidenden Gespräch – eine Anspielung gemacht hatte … Es war im zweiten Akt, in der spanischen Schenke, einer geräumigen Spelunke, dielenartig, mit Tüchern geschmückt und von defekter maurischer Architektur. Carmens warme, ein wenig rauhe, aber durch Rassigkeit einnehmende Stimme erklärte, tanzen zu wollen vor dem Sergeanten, und schon hörte man ihre Kastagnetten klappern. In demselben Augenblick aber erschollen aus einiger Entfernung Trompeten, Clairons, ein wiederholtes militärisches Signal, das dem Kleinen nicht wenig in die Glieder fuhr. »Halt! Einen Augenblick!« rief er und spitzte die Ohren wie ein Pferd. Und da Carmen »Warum?« fragte und »was es denn gäbe?«: »Hörst du nicht?« rief er, ganz erstaunt, daß ihr das nicht eingehe, wie ihm. Es seien ja die Trompeten aus der Kaserne, die das Zeichen gäben. »Zur Heimkehr naht die Frist«, sagte er opernhaft. Aber die Zigeunerin konnte das nicht begreifen und wollte es vor allem auch gar nicht. Desto besser, meinte sie halb dumm, halb frech, da brauchten sie keine Kastagnetten, der Himmel selbst schicke ihnen Musik zum Tanz und darum: Lalalala! – Er war außer sich. Sein eigener Enttäuschungsschmerz trat ganz zurück hinter dem Bemühen, ihr klarzumachen, um was es sich handle, und daß keine Verliebtheit der Welt gegen dieses Signal aufkomme. Wie war es denn möglich, daß sie etwas so Fundamentales und Unbedingtes nicht verstand! »Ich muß nun fort, nach Haus, ins Quartier, zum Appell!« rief er, verzweifelt über eine Ahnungslosigkeit, die ihm das Herz doppelt so schwer machte, als es ohnedies gewesen wäre. Da aber mußte man Carmen hören! Sie war wütend, sie war in tiefster Seele empört, ihre Stimme war ganz und gar betrogene und beleidigte Liebe – oder sie stellte sich so. »Ins Quartier? Zum Appell?« Und ihr Herz? Und ihr gutes, zärtliches Herz, das in seiner Schwäche – ja, sie gebe es zu: in seiner Schwäche! – bereit gewesen sei, ihm {982}mit Gesang und Tanz die Zeit zu kürzen? »Traterata!« und sie hob mit wildem Hohn die gerollte Hand an den Mund, um das Clairon nachzuahmen. »Traterata!« Und das genüge. Da springe der Dummkopf in die Höhe und wolle fort. Gut denn, fort mit ihm! Hier sein Helm, sein Säbel und Gehänge! Machen, machen, machen solle er, daß er in die Kaserne komme! – Er bat um Erbarmen. Aber sie fuhr fort in ihrem glühenden Hohn, indem sie tat, als sei sie er, der beim Schall der Hörner sein bißchen Verstand verloren habe. Traterata, zum Appell! Barmherziger Himmel, er werde noch zu spät kommen! Nur fort, denn es rufe ja zum Appelle, und da störe er selbstverständlich auf wie ein Narr, in dem Augenblick, wo sie, Carmen, für ihn habe tanzen wollen. Das, das, das sei seine Liebe zu ihr! –","There was a third one... There were actually several more, belonging together, intertwined, three or four, because the tenor aria that appeared occupied a page that was ringed up to the middle. Again it was something French, from an opera which Hans Castorp knew well, which he had heard and seen repeatedly in the theater and to whose plot he had once even alluded in a conversational manner - and in a very decisive conversation at that... It was in the second act, in the Spanish tavern, a spacious tavern, floorboard-like, decked with cloths, and of defective Moorish architecture. Carmen's warm voice, a little rough but captivating because of its classiness, declared that she wanted to dance in front of the sergeant, and her castanets could be heard clattering. At the same moment, however, trumpets sounded from a distance, Clairons, a repeated military signal, which shook the little one not a little. ""Stop! he cried, pricking up his ears like a horse. And when Carmen asked ""Why?"" and ""What's the matter?"": ""Can't you hear?"" he exclaimed, quite astonished that she didn't get it like he did. It was the trumpets from the barracks that gave the signal. ""It's time to go home,"" he said operatically. But the gypsy couldn't understand it and above all didn't want it at all. All the better, she said, half stupid, half cheeky, they didn't need castanets, heaven itself sent them music to dance to, and therefore: Lalalala! - He was beside himself. The pain of his own disappointment receded completely behind the effort to make her understand what it was all about and that no infatuation in the world could overcome this signal. How was it possible that she didn't understand something so fundamental and absolute! ""I have to go home now, to my quarters, to roll-call!"" he cried, despairing at an ignorance that made his heart twice as heavy as it would have been otherwise. But then you had to hear Carmen! She was angry, she was outraged in her soul, her voice was betrayed and offended love all over - or she pretended to be. »To the quarters? For roll call?” And her heart? And her good, tender heart, in its weakness - yes, she admits it: in its weakness! - was prepared to shorten his time {982}with singing and dancing? ""Traterata!"" and she raised her curled hand to her mouth with wild derision in imitation of the Clairon. ""Traterata!"" And that's enough. Then the fool jumps up and wants to get away. Alright then, away with him! Here is his helmet, his saber and his gear! Do it, do it, do it, get him to the barracks! – He asked for mercy. But she continued in her glowing scorn, pretending to be he who had lost his little mind at the sound of the horns. Traterata, to roll call! Merciful Heaven, he will still be late! Go ahead, because there was a call to roll call, and of course he broke up like a fool at the moment when she, Carmen, wanted to dance for him. That, that, that was his love for her! –","There was a third. Or rather there were many, a consecutive group of three or four, a single tenor aria taking up almost half the space of a whole black rubber plate. Again it was French music—an opera Hans Castorp knew well, having seen and heard it repeatedly. Once, at a certain critical juncture now far in the past, he had made its action serve him for an allegory. The record took up the play at the second act, in the Spanish tavern, in crude Moorish architecture, a shawl-draped, roomy cellar like the floor of a barn. One heard Carmen’s voice, a little brusque, yet warm, and very infectious in its folk-quality, saying she would dance before the sergeant; one heard the rattle of castanets. But in the same moment, from a distance, the blare of trumpets swelled out, bugles giving a military signal, at which sound the little sergeant starts up. “One moment, stop!” he cries, and pricks up his ears like a horse. Why? What was it then, Carmen asked; and he: “Dost thou not hear?” astonished that the signal did not enter into her soul as into his. “Carmen, ‘tis the retreat!” It is the trumpets from the garrison, giving the summons. “The hour draws nigh for our return,” says he, in operatic language. But the gipsy girl cannot understand, nor does she wish to. So much the better, she says, half stupidly, half pertly; she needs no castanets, for here is music dropped from the sky. Music to dance by, tra-la, tra-la! He is beside himself. His own disappointment retreats before his need to make clear to her how matters stand, and how no love-affair in the world can prevent obedience to this summons. How is it she cannot understand anything so fixed, so fundamental? “I must away, the signal summons me, to quarters!” he cries, in despair over a lack of understanding that doubly burdens his heavy heart. And now, hear Carmen! She is furious. Outraged to the depths of her soul, her voice is sheer betrayed and injured love—or she makes it sound so. “To quarters? The signal?” And her heart? Her faithful, loving heart, just then, in its weakness, yes, she admitted, in its weakness, about to while away an hour with him in dance and song? “Tan-ta-ra!” And in a fury of scorn she sets her curled hand to her lips and imitates the horns: “Taran-tara!” And that was enough to make the fool leap up, on fire to be off! Good, then, let him be off, away with him! Here are helmet, sabre, and hanger—away, away, away with him, let him be off, let him be off, off to the barracks! He pleads for mercy. But she goes on, scorching him with her scorn, mocking him, taking his place and showing in pantomime how at the sound of the horn he lost what little sense he had. Tan-tara! The signal! O heaven! he will come too late! Let him go, let him be off, for the summons sounds, and he, like a fool, makes to go, at the very moment when she would dance for him. From this time, so she will account his love!","To our nocturnal musician’s ears, this one piece’s soothing effects made it worth many others. And there was a third—made up of several records actually, three or four that belonged together and were to be played in sequence, since the tenor aria alone took up half of one disk of concentric rings. It was another French piece, an opera Hans Castorp knew well, one he had heard and seen repeatedly in the theater and to whose plot he had even alluded once in conversation—in a very crucial conversation. It was the music from the second act, in the Spanish tavern—a low dive, spacious, almost barnlike, with cloths on the tables and a kind of half-baked Moorish architecture. In a warm, slightly husky voice, both earthy and intriguing, Carmen declares she wants to dance with her corporal, and you can hear the castanets clattering now. At the same moment, however, trumpets—bugles—call from the distance, a repeated military signal that comes as no small shock to the little man. “Stop! Just a moment!” he cries and pricks up his ears like a horse. And when Carmen asks, “Why?” and wants to know what is going on, he cries, “Don’t you hear?”—amazed that the message is not as clear to her as it is to him. Those were trumpets from his barracks, a bugle call. “They are sounding the retreat,” he says operatically. But the Gypsy cannot understand and, more importantly, doesn’t want to. All the better, she says, half out of stupidity, half out of impudence, now she won’t need her castanets, heaven itself is sending her music to dance by and so— la la la la! He is beside himself. The pain of disappointment gives way to attempts to make clear to her what is happening and that no love affair in the world can prevail against this call. How is it possible, really, that she does not understand something so fundamental, so absolute? “I must return to camp, to quarters, for roll call,” he cries in despair at an ingenuousness that only doubles the burden his heart already feels. But listen to Carmen now! She is furious, outraged to the depths of her soul; her voice is all betrayal and injured love—or she makes it sound that way. “ Back to quarters, for roll call?” And what about her heart? Her good, tender heart that in its stupidity—yes, she admits it, in its stupidity—was prepared to amuse him with song and dance? “ Ta ra ta ta!” and in savage mockery she holds a rolled hand to her mouth to imitate the bugle call. “ Ta ra ta ta!” And that does it. The idiot leaps up—he is leaving. Fine then, run along! Here, here are his cap, his sword and knapsack! Clear out, dear out, run along, back to the barracks! He begs for mercy. But she keeps up her hot scorn, she imitates him, and pretends to lose her head at the sound of the trumpets. Ta ra ta ta, back to roll call! Merciful heavens, he’s going to be late! Run along, there’s the bugle call, and of course he starts acting the fool just when she, Carmen, was going to dance for him. That, that, that, is his love for her!"
"Und Settembrini begann, italienisch zu rezitieren, indem er die schönen Silben auf der Zunge zergehen ließ, den Kopf hin und her bewegte und zuweilen die Augen schloß, unbekümmert darum, daß seine Begleiter kein Wort verstanden. Sichtlich war es ihm darum zu tun, sein Gedächtnis und seine Aussprache selbst zu genießen und vor den Zuhörern zur Geltung zu bringen. Endlich sagte er:","And Settembrini began to recite in Italian, letting the beautiful syllables melt in his mouth, moving his head from side to side and occasionally closing his eyes, unconcerned that his companions could not understand a word. It was evidently his concern to enjoy his memory and his pronunciation himself and to bring them to bear in front of the audience. Finally he said:","And Settembrini began to recite in Italian, letting the beautiful syllables melt upon his tongue, as he closed his eyes and swayed his head from side to side, heedless that his hearers understood not a syllable. Obviously it was all done for the sake of impressing his companions with his memory and his pronunciation.","And Settembrini began to recite in Italian, letting the lovely syllables melt on his tongue, rocking his head back and forth, even closing his eyes now and then, oblivious to the fact that his companions understood not a word. It was evident that he did it to savor both his own powers of memory and the words themselves—and to show them off to his audience. Finally he said, “But you do not understand."
"Irgendwoher gebot eine Baßstimme Ruhe. Herr Albin lachte kurz auf, – es war ein flatternd-abgerissenes Lachen. Dann ward es still in der Liegehalle, so still, als sei ein Traum oder Spuk zerstoben; und sonderbar klangen die gesprochenen Worte im Schweigen nach. Hans Castorp lauschte ihnen, bis sie völlig erstorben waren, und obwohl ihm unbestimmt schien, als ob Herr Albin ein Laffe sei, so konnte er sich doch nicht eines gewissen Neides auf ihn erwehren. Namentlich jenes dem Schulleben entnommene Gleichnis hatte ihm Eindruck gemacht, denn er selbst war ja in Untersekunda sitzen geblieben, und er erinnerte sich wohl des etwas schimpflichen aber humoristischen, angenehm verwahrlosten Zustandes, dessen er genossen hatte, als er im vierten Quartal das Rennen aufgegeben und »über das Ganze« hatte lachen können. Da seine Betrachtungen dumpf und verworren waren, so ist es schwer, sie zu präzisieren. Hauptsächlich schien ihm, daß die Ehre bedeutende Vorteile für sich habe, aber die Schande nicht minder, ja, daß die Vorteile der letzteren geradezu grenzenloser Art seien. Und indem er sich probeweise in Herrn Albins Zustand versetzte und sich vergegenwärtigte, wie es sein müsse, wenn man endgültig des Druckes der Ehre ledig war und auf immer die bodenlosen Vorteile der Schande genoß, erschreckte den jungen Mann ein Gefühl von wüster Süßigkeit, das sein Herz vorübergehend zu noch hastigerem Gange erregte.","From somewhere a bass voice called for silence. Herr Albin laughed briefly - it was a fluttering, broken laugh. Then it became quiet in the lounge, as quiet as if a dream or a spook had died away; and strangely the words spoken rang in the silence. Hans Castorp listened to them until they were completely dead, and although it seemed to him vaguely that Herr Albin was a jerk, he could not help feeling a certain envy of him. Especially that parable taken from school life had made an impression on him, because he himself had stayed behind in lower secondary, and he probably remembered the somewhat shameful but humorous, pleasantly neglected state he had enjoyed when he gave up the race in the fourth quarter and ""about the whole thing"" had been able to laugh. Since his reflections were dull and confused, it is difficult to make them precise. In the main, it seemed to him that honor had significant advantages, but shame no less, indeed, that the advantages of the latter were almost limitless. And as he tentatively put himself in Mr. Albin's condition, and imagined what it must be like to finally be free from the pressures of honor and enjoy forever the bottomless advantages of shame, the young man was terrified by a feeling of wild sweetness that was his temporarily aroused the heart to an even faster pace.","From somewhere a bass voice was audible, commanding quiet. Herr Albin gave a short laugh, a ragged, wavering laugh; then stillness reigned in the rest-hall, a stillness as of a vanished dream, a disappearing wraith. Afterwards the voices rose again, sounding strange in the silence. Hans Castorp listened until they were quite hushed. He had an indistinct notion that Herr Albin was a puppy, yet could not resist a certain envy. In particular, the school-days comparison made an impression on him; he himself had stuck in the lower second and well remembered this situation, of course rather to be ashamed of and yet not without its funny side. In particular he recalled the agreeable sensation of being totally lost and abandoned, with which, in the fourth quarter, he gave up the running—he could have “laughed at the whole thing.” His reflections were dim and confused, it would be difficult to define them; but in effect it seemed to him that, though honour might possess certain advantages, yet shame had others, and not inferior: advantages, even, that were well-nigh boundless in their scope. He tried to put himself in Herr Albin’s place and see how it must feel to be finally relieved of the burden of a respectable life and made free of the infinite realms of shame; and the young man shuddered at the wild wave of sweetness which swept over him at the thought and drove on his labouring heart to an even quicker pace.","From somewhere a bass voice rang out, demanding quiet. Herr Albin let out a brief laugh—a fluttery, ragged laugh. Then it grew quiet in the lounging area—as quiet as if a nightmare or a ghost had been routed. And any word spoken sounded strange in the silence. Hans Castorp listened until the last one had died away, and although he was not quite certain if Herr Albin was a phony or not, he could not help feeling a little envious of him nevertheless. That comparison taken from life at school had made an impression on him, because he had been held back in his sophomore year, and he could recall the somewhat ignominious, but humorous and pleasantly untidy state of affairs that he had enjoyed in the last quarter, once he had given up even trying and was able to laugh “at the whole thing.” But since his thought processes were dull and confused, it is difficult to be very precise about them. On the whole, however, it seemed to him that although honor had its advantages, so, too, did disgrace, and that indeed the advantages of the latter were almost boundless. He tried putting himself in Herr Albin ’s shoes and imagining how it must be when one is finally free of all the pressures honor brings and one can endlessly enjoy the unbounded advantages of disgrace—and the young man was terrified by a sense of dissolute sweetness that set his heart pounding even faster for a while."
"{504}Hinter sich hörte er rufen, wohllautende ausländische Worte: »Eh! Ingegnere! Aspetti! Che cosa fa! Ingegnere! Un po’ di ragione, sa! Ma è matto questo ragazzo!« Aber er übertönte diese Stimme mit der seinen, und so sah man Herrn Settembrini, eine Hand mit gespreiztem Arm über den Kopf geworfen – eine in seiner Heimat übliche Gebärde, deren Sinn nicht leicht auf ein Wort zu bringen wäre, und die von einem langgezogenen »Ehh –!« begleitet war – die Fastnachtsgeselligkeit verlassen. – Hans Castorp aber stand auf dem Klinkerhof, blickte aus nächster Nähe in die blau-grau-grünen Epicanthus-Augen über den vortretenden Backenknochen und sprach:","{504}Behind him he heard euphonious foreign words: ""Eh! enemies!

And uttering a long drawn-out “Ehh—!” he left the Mardi Gras festivities. Hans Castorp, however, was standing in the brick schoolyard, staring from close up into a pair of blue-gray-green, epicanthic eyes above prominent cheekbones; and he said, “Do you have a pencil, perhaps?”"
"Auch zu dem Friedhof am Dorfberge also gingen die drei einmal spazieren, – exakter Rechenschaft halber sei auch dieser Ausflug noch angeführt. Die Anregung dazu war von Hans Castorp ausgegangen, und Joachim hatte wohl anfangs der armen Karen wegen Bedenken gehabt, dann aber eingesehen und zugegeben, daß es zwecklos gewesen wäre, mit ihr Verstecken zu spielen und sie im Sinne der feigen Stöhr vor allem, was an den Exitus erinnerte, ängstlich zu bewahren. Karen Karstedt gab sich noch nicht den Selbsttäuschungen des letzten Stadiums hin, sondern wußte Bescheid, wie es mit ihr stand und was es mit der Nekrose ihrer Fingerspitzen auf sich hatte. Sie wußte ferner, daß ihre harten Verwandten vom Luxus des Heimtransportes kaum würden etwas wissen wollen, sondern daß ihr nach dem Exitus ein bescheidenes Plätzchen dort oben zum Quartier würde angewiesen werden. Und kurz, man konnte wohl finden, daß dieses Wanderziel moralisch passender für sie war, als manches andere, zum Beispiel der Bobstart oder das Kino, – wie es denn übrigens nicht mehr als ein anständiger Akt der Kameradschaft war, Denen dort oben einmal einen Besuch zu machen, gesetzt, daß man den Friedhof nicht einfach als Sehenswürdigkeit und neutrales Spaziergebiet betrachten wollte.","The three of them also went for a walk to the cemetery on the Dorfberge - for the sake of exact account this excursion should also be mentioned. The suggestion for this had come from Hans Castorp, and Joachim had probably initially had reservations about poor Karen, but then he realized and admitted that it would have been pointless to play hide-and-seek with her and that she, in the interest of the cowardly Stöhr, was above all involved remembered the exitus, anxious to preserve. Karen Karstedt did not yet succumb to the self-deceptions of the last stage, but knew how she was and what the necrosis of her fingertips was all about. She also knew that her close relatives would scarcely want to know anything about the luxury of being transported home, but that after her death she would be assigned a modest place up there to live in. And in short, one could well find that this hiking destination was morally more appropriate for them than some other things, for example the bobsled run or the cinema - as it was then, by the way, no more than a decent act of camaraderie To pay a visit to those up there once to do, assuming that one does not want to regard the cemetery simply as a place of interest and a neutral area for walking.","To the graveyard then, on the slope of the Dorfberg, the three wended their way— we tell it to complete the tale of their excursions. It was Hans Castorp’s idea; Joachim probably had scruples at first, on the score of poor Karen, but in the end agreed that it was useless to pretend with her, or to carry out Frau Stöhr’s cowardly policy of shielding her from all that could remind her of her end. Karen Karstedt was not yet so far on as to display the self-deception that marks the last stage. She knew quite well how it stood with her, and what the necrosis of her finger-tips meant: knew too that her unfeeling relatives would not hear of the unnecessary expense of having her sent back home, and that it would be her lot, after her exit, to fill a modest space up yonder. In short, it might even be said that such an excursion was more fitting, morally spoken, than many another, than the cinematograph or the bob-sleigh races, for example—and surely it was no more than proper to make those lying up there a visit once in a way, as a comradely attention, provided one did not regard it as in the same class with an ordinary walk or excursion to a point of interest.","And so the trio also walked to the cemetery on Dorfberg one day— this excursion, too, is recorded here for the sake of rendering a full account. The suggestion had been Hans Castorp’s, and although Joachim had some doubts at first because of poor Karen, he had yielded, admitting that it would have been pointless to play hide-and-seek with her, shielding her out of anxiety, à la cowardly Frau Stöhr, from anything that might remind her of her mortality. Karen Karstedt did not indulge in self-deception about even the final stages of her illness; she knew only too well how things stood and what the necrosis in her fingertips meant. She knew, moreover, that her skinflint relatives would hardly want to hear anything about the expense of transporting her home after her demise and that she would be allotted a modest plot up above for a final resting place. And so one might very well conclude that, as a goal for an excursion, it was more morally fitting than many others—the movie theater or the start of the bobsled run, for instance—particularly since paying a visit to those people up there was nothing more than an act of comradely respect, assuming, of course, that one did not regard the cemetery simply as one of the town’s sights, a standard goal for a standard walk."

"Mit einem Worte: Hans Castorp sah in seinem stillen Verhältnis zu dem nachlässigen Mitgliede Derer hier oben ein Ferienabenteuer, das vor dem Tribunal der Vernunft – seines eigenen vernünftigen Gewissens – keinerlei Anspruch auf Billigung erheben konnte: hauptsächlich deshalb nicht, weil Frau Chauchat ja krank war, schlaff, fiebrig und innerlich wurmstichig, ein Umstand, der mit der Zweifelhaftigkeit ihrer Gesamtexistenz nahe zusammenhing und auch an Hans Castorps Vorsichts- und Abstandsgefühlen stark beteiligt war … Nein, ihre wirkliche Bekanntschaft zu suchen, kam ihm nicht in den Sinn, und was das andere betraf, so würde es ja in anderthalb Wochen, wenn er bei Tunder & Wilms in die Praxis trat, wohl oder übel folgenlos beendet sein.","In a word: Hans Castorp saw in his quiet relationship with the neglectful member of those up here a holiday adventure which before the tribunal of reason - his own reasonable conscience - could lay no claim to approval: mainly because Mrs. Chauchat was ill , limp, feverish and wormy inside, a circumstance that was closely related to the dubious nature of her entire existence and also played a major part in Hans Castorp’s feelings of caution and distance … No, it never occurred to him to seek her real acquaintance, and what that was As far as others were concerned, it would be over in a week and a half when he went into practice at Tunder & Wilms, for better or for worse, without any consequences.","In a word, Hans Castorp envisaged in this opening affair between him and the heedless creature who was a member of the Berghof society no more than a holiday adventure. Before the tribunal of reason, conscience, and common sense it could make no claims to be heard; principally, of course, because when all was said and done, Frau Chauchat was an ailing woman, feeble, fevered, and tainted within; her physical condition had much to do with the questionable life she led, as also with Hans Castorp's instinctive reservations. No, it simply did not occur to him to seek her society; while as for the rest—well, however the thing turned out, it would be over in one way or another inside ten days, when he would enter upon his apprenticeship at Tunder and Wilms ’s. For the moment, however, he had begun to live in and for the emotions roused in him by the pretty patient: the up and down of suspense, fulfilment or disappointment, characteristic of such a state.","In a word, Hans Castorp saw his silent relationship to this one careless person among all the others up here as a vacation adventure, which had no claim before the court of reason—or of his own reasonable conscience—and that was primarily because Frau Chauchat was sick, listless, feverish, and worm-eaten deep inside, a condition that was closely bound up with the dubious nature of her whole being and that itself contributed strongly to Hans Castorp’s sense of caution and need to keep his distance. No, it never entered his mind to seek out a real acquaintanceship. As for the rest, it would all be over with no consequences, for better or worse, in another week and a half, when he would enter training with Tunder and Wilms."

""A lively company!"" And perhaps he was taking revenge a little for the reprimand he received this morning for the ""Schellenbaum"".","“What kind of talk is that?” Joachim said, with serious reproach. “ ‘Doing a lively business’!” And perhaps he recalled the reproaches he had called down on his own head earlier in the day.","“What sort of an expression is that,” Joachim reprimanded him discreetly. “ ‘A regular hustle and bustle!’ ” And perhaps he was revenging himself a little for the rebuke he had received earlier today for his “glockenspiel.”"
"Er durfte ungescheut auch Settembrini um weitere Belehrung ansprechen, denn dieser hatte Herrn Naphta in Dingen der Diskretion nichts vorzuwerfen und war übrigens nie sonderlich bedacht gewesen, aus seiner Zugehörigkeit zu jener harmonischen Gesellschaft ein Geheimnis zu machen. Die »Rivista della Massoneria Italiana« lag offen auf seinem Tisch; Hans Castorp hatte nur eben nicht acht darauf gegeben. Und als er, von Naphta aufgeklärt, das Gespräch auf die königliche {775}Kunst gebracht hatte, so, als sei Settembrinis Verbundenheit mit ihr eine Sache, über die er sich niemals Zweifel gemacht, da war er nur auf geringe Zurückhaltung gestoßen. Zwar gab es Punkte, über die der Literat sich nicht herausließ, sondern bei deren Berührung er mit einer gewissen Ostentation die Lippen verschloß, offenbar gebunden durch jene terroristischen Gelöbnisse, von denen Naphta gesprochen: eine Geheimniskrämerei, die äußere Bräuche und seine eigene Stellung innerhalb der merkwürdigen Organisation betraf. Sonst aber nahm er sogar den Mund sehr voll und gab dem Neugierigen ein bedeutendes Bild von der Ausbreitung seiner Liga, die sich in rund zwanzigtausend Logen und hundertfünfzig Großlogen fast über die ganze Welt und selbst auf Zivilisationen wie Haiti und die Negerrepublik Liberia erstrecke. Auch wußte er sich nicht wenig mit allerlei großen Namen, deren Träger Maurer gewesen waren oder es heute waren, nannte Voltaire, Lafayette und Napoleon, Franklin und Washington, Mazzini und Garibaldi, von Lebenden sogar den König von England und außerdem eine Menge Männer, in deren Händen die Geschäfte der europäischen Staaten lagen, Mitglieder von Regierungen und Parlamenten.","He was not afraid to approach Settembrini for further instruction, for he had nothing to accuse Mr. Naphta of in matters of discretion and, moreover, had never particularly considered making a secret of his membership in that harmonious society. The Rivista della Massoneria Italiana lay open on his table; Hans Castorp just hadn't paid attention to it. And when, enlightened by Naphta, he had brought up the subject of the royal {775}art, as if Settembrini's attachment to it was a thing about which he had never doubted, he had met but little reluctance. Admittedly there were points about which the man of letters did not digress, but on touching which he closed his lips with a certain ostentation, evidently bound by those terrorist vows of which Naphta spoke: a secrecy that bound external customs and his own position within the strange organization concerned. But otherwise he even talked very full and gave the curious an important picture of the expansion of his league, which in around twenty thousand lodges and one hundred and fifty grand lodges stretched almost all over the world and even to civilizations like Haiti and the Negro Republic of Liberia. He also knew a lot about all sorts of big names whose bearers had been or are today Masons, called Voltaire, Lafayette and Napoleon, Franklin and Washington, Mazzini and Garibaldi, even the King of England of the living, and also a lot of men in whose hands were the affairs of the European states, members of governments and parliaments.","He might with impunity seek further information from Herr Settembrini, for that gentleman could not reproach Naphta with any lack of discretion; indeed, he had never made any secret of his membership in the harmonious band of brothers. The Rivista della Massoneria lay open upon his table; Hans Castorp had simply never noticed it. Enlightened by Naphta, he led the conversation round to the subject of the “kingly art,” as though Settembrini’s connexion with it had never been a matter of doubt, and he met with very little reticence. True, there were points upon which the literary man was silent. When they were touched upon he closed his lips with ostentation, being obviously bound by those terroristic vows of which Naphta had spoken; this when Hans Castorp encroached on trade secrets, as it were, outward forms of the organization, and his own position within it. But otherwise he was almost too expansive; and held forth at length, giving the seeker after information a considerable picture of the extent of the society, which spread almost all over the world, with twenty thousand lodges and a hundred and fifty grand lodges, in round numbers, and had penetrated civilizations like Haiti and the Negro republic of Liberia. Also he had much to tell of the great names whose bearers had been Masons: Voltaire, Lafayette and Napoleon, Franklin and Washington, Mazzini and Garibaldi; among the living, the King of England, and besides him, a large group of people in whose hands lay the conduct of the nations of Europe, members of governments and parliaments.","There was no reason to be shy about turning to Herr Settembrini for further information; inasmuch as the Italian had never been particularly careful about making a secret of his membership in that harmonious society, he could not reproach Herr Naphta for a lack of discretion in the matter.

And so when he brought the conversation around to the “royal craft,” as if he had never been in any doubt about Settembrini’s association with it, he met with little reticence. There were topics, of course, that the literary man would not discuss, and at their mention he simply set his lips tight with some ostentation, presumably bound by the terroristic oath that Naphta had said drew a veil of secrecy over the curious organization’s ceremonial usages and his own rank within it. But otherwise he was downright boastful and provided his inquisitive visitor a full picture of the fellowship’s worldwide operation, with approximately 20,000 lodges and 150 grand lodges, even reaching the cultures of Negro republics like Haiti and Liberia. He was also quite liberal about naming names of those great men who had been or were now Masons: Voltaire, Lafayette, and Napoleon, Franklin and Washington, Mazzini and Garibaldi; and among the living, the king of England and a great many other men, members of governments and parliaments, in whose hands lay the affairs of Europe."

"Was redete denn Dr. Krokowski? In welchem Gedankengange bewegte er sich? Hans Castorp nahm seinen Verstand zusammen, um aufs laufende zu kommen, was ihm nicht gleich gelang, da er den Anfang nicht gehört und beim Nachdenken über Frau Chauchats schlaffen Rücken Weiteres versäumt hatte. Es handelte sich um eine Macht … jene Macht … kurzum, es war die Macht der Liebe, um die es sich handelte. Selbstverständlich! Das Thema lag ja im Generaltitel des Vortragszyklus, {193}und wovon sollte Dr. Krokowski denn auch sonst wohl sprechen, da dies nun einmal sein Gebiet war. Etwas wunderlich war es ja, auf einmal ein Kolleg über die Liebe zu hören, während sonst immer nur von Dingen wie dem Übersetzungsgetriebe im Schiffbau die Rede gewesen war. Wie fing man es an, einen Gegenstand von so spröder und verschwiegener Beschaffenheit am hellen Vormittag vor Damen und Herren zu erörtern? Dr. Krokowski erörterte ihn in einer gemischten Ausdrucksweise, in zugleich poetischem und gelehrtem Stile, rücksichtslos wissenschaftlich, dabei aber gesanghaft schwingenden Tones, was den jungen Hans Castorp etwas unordentlich anmutete, obgleich gerade dies der Grund sein mochte, weshalb die Damen so hitzige Wangen hatten und die Herren ihre Ohren schüttelten. Insonderheit gebrauchte der Redner das Wort »Liebe« beständig in einem leise schwankenden Sinn, so daß man niemals recht wußte, woran man damit war, und ob es Frommes oder Leidenschaftlich-Fleischliches bedeute, – was ein leichtes Gefühl von Seekrankheit erzeugte. Nie in seinem Leben hatte Hans Castorp dieses Wort so oft hintereinander aussprechen hören, wie hier und heute, ja, wenn er nachdachte, so schien ihm, daß er selbst es noch niemals ausgesprochen oder aus fremdem Munde vernommen habe. Das mochte ein Irrtum sein, – jedenfalls fand er nicht, daß so häufige Wiederholung dem Worte zustatten käme. Im Gegenteil, diese schlüpfrigen anderthalb Silben mit dem Zungen-, dem Lippenlaut und dem dünnen Vokal in der Mitte wurden ihm auf die Dauer recht widerwärtig, eine Vorstellung verband sich für ihn damit wie von gewässerter Milch, – etwas Weißbläulichem, Labberigem, zumal im Vergleich mit all dem Kräftigen, was Dr. Krokowski genau genommen darüber zum besten gab. Denn so viel ward deutlich, daß man starke Stücke sagen konnte, ohne die Leute aus dem Saale zu treiben, wenn man es anfing wie er. Keineswegs begnügte er sich damit, allgemein bekannte, doch {194}gemeinhin in Schweigen gehüllte Dinge mit einer Art von berauschendem Takt zur Sprache zu bringen; er zerstörte Illusionen, er gab unerbittlich der Erkenntnis die Ehre, er ließ keinen Raum für empfindsamen Glauben an die Würde des Silberhaares und die Engelsreinheit des zarten Kindes. Übrigens trug er auch zum Gehrock seinen weichen Fallkragen und seine Sandalen über den grauen Socken, was einen grundsätzlichen und idealistischen Eindruck machte, wenn auch Hans Castorp etwas darüber erschrak. Indem er an der Hand von Büchern und losen Blättern, die vor ihm auf dem Tische lagen, seine Aufstellungen durch allerlei Beispiele und Anekdoten stützte und mehrmals sogar Verse rezitierte, handelte Dr. Krokowski von erschreckenden Formen der Liebe, wunderlichen, leidvollen und unheimlichen Abwandlungen ihrer Erscheinung und Allgewalt. Unter allen Naturtrieben, sagte er, sei sie der schwankendste und gefährdetste, von Grund aus zur Verirrung und heillosen Verkehrtheit geneigt, und das dürfe nicht wundernehmen. Denn dieser mächtige Impuls sei nichts Einfaches, er sei seiner Natur nach vielfach zusammengesetzt, und zwar, so rechtmäßig wie er als Ganzes auch immer sei, – zusammengesetzt sei er aus lauter Verkehrtheiten. Da man nun aber, und zwar mit Recht, so fuhr Dr. Krokowski fort, da man es nun aber richtigerweise ablehne, aus der Verkehrtheit der Bestandteile auf die Verkehrtheit des Ganzen zu schließen, so sei man unweigerlich genötigt, einen Teil der Rechtmäßigkeit des Ganzen, wenn nicht seine ganze Rechtmäßigkeit, auch für die einzelne Verkehrtheit in Anspruch zu nehmen. Das sei eine Forderung der Logik, und daran bitte er seine Zuhörer festzuhalten. Seelische Widerstände und Korrektive seien es, anständige und ordnende Instinkte von – fast hätte er sagen mögen bürgerlicher Art, unter deren ausgleichender und einschränkender Wirkung die verkehrten Bestandteile zum regelrechten und nützlichen Ganzen verschmölzen, – ein im{195}merhin häufiger und begrüßenswerter Prozeß, dessen Ergebnis jedoch (wie Dr. Krokowski etwas wegwerfend hinzufügte) den Arzt und Denker weiter nichts angehe. In einem anderen Falle dagegen gelinge er nicht, dieser Prozeß, wolle und solle er nicht gelingen, und wer, so fragte Dr. Krokowski, vermöge zu sagen, ob dies nicht vielleicht den edleren, seelisch kostbareren Fall bedeute? In diesem Falle nämlich eigne beiden Kräftegruppen, dem Liebesdrange sowohl wie jenen gegnerischen Impulsen, unter denen Scham und Ekel besonders zu nennen seien, eine außerordentliche, das bürgerlich-übliche Maß überschreitende Anspannung und Leidenschaft, und, in den Untergründen der Seele geführt, verhindere der Kampf zwischen ihnen jene Einfriedung, Sicherung und Sittigung der irrenden Triebe, die zur üblichen Harmonie, zum vorschriftsmäßigen Liebesleben führe. Dieser Widerstreit zwischen den Mächten der Keuschheit und der Liebe – denn um einen solchen handle es sich –, wie gehe er aus? Er endige scheinbar mit dem Siege der Keuschheit. Furcht, Wohlanstand, züchtiger Abscheu, zitterndes Reinheitsbedürfnis, sie unterdrückten die Liebe, hielten sie in Dunkelheiten gefesselt, ließen ihre wirren Forderungen höchstens teilweise, aber bei weitem nicht nach ihrer ganzen Vielfalt und Kraft ins Bewußtsein und zur Betätigung zu. Allein dieser Sieg der Keuschheit sei nur ein Schein- und Pyrrhussieg, denn der Liebesbefehl lasse sich nicht knebeln, nicht vergewaltigen, die unterdrückte Liebe sei nicht tot, sie lebe, sie trachte im Dunklen und Tiefgeheimen auch ferner sich zu erfüllen, sie durchbreche den Keuschheitsbann und erscheine wieder, wenn auch in verwandelter, unkenntlicher Gestalt … Und welches sei denn nun die Gestalt und Maske, worin die nicht zugelassene und unterdrückte Liebe wiedererscheine? So fragte Dr. Krokowski und blickte die Reihen entlang, als erwarte er die Antwort ernstlich von seinen Zuhörern. Ja, das mußte er nun auch noch selber sagen, nachdem er schon {196}so manches gesagt hatte. Niemand außer ihm wußte es, aber er würde bestimmt auch dies noch wissen, das sah man ihm an. Mit seinen glühenden Augen, seiner Wachsblässe und seinem schwarzen Bart, dazu den Mönchssandalen über grauwollenen Socken, schien er selbst in seiner Person den Kampf zwischen Keuschheit und Leidenschaft zu versinnbildlichen, von dem er gesprochen hatte. Wenigstens war dies Hans Castorps Eindruck, während er wie alle Welt mit größter Spannung die Antwort darauf erwartete, in welcher Gestalt die unzugelassene Liebe wiederkehre. Die Frauen atmeten kaum. Staatsanwalt Paravant schüttelte rasch noch einmal sein Ohr, damit es im entscheidenden Augenblick offen und aufnahmefähig wäre. Da sagte Dr. Krokowski: In Gestalt der Krankheit! Das Krankheitssymptom sei verkappte Liebesbetätigung und alle Krankheit verwandelte Liebe.","What was Dr. talking about? Krokowski? In what line of thought was he moving? Hans Castorp used his wits to get the message running, which he didn't manage to do right away, since he hadn't heard the beginning and had missed more when thinking about Frau Chauchat's sagging back. It was a power...that power...in short, it was the power of love that was the issue. Of course! The topic lay in the general title of the lecture cycle, {193}and what should Dr. Krokowski then probably speak otherwise, since this was after all his area. It was a bit odd, all of a sudden, to hear a lecture on love, when otherwise there had only been talk of things like transmission gears in shipbuilding. How did one go about discussing a subject of such a brittle and secret nature in the broad daylight in front of ladies and gentlemen? dr Krokowski discussed it in a mixed mode of expression, in a style at once poetic and scholarly, ruthlessly scientific but at the same time singingly swinging in tone, which struck young Hans Castorp as somewhat untidy, although this might be the reason why the ladies had such hot cheeks and the Gentlemen shook their ears. In particular, the speaker used the word ""love"" constantly in a slightly vacillating sense, so that one never quite knew where one stood with it, and whether it meant pious or passionately carnal—which produced a slight feeling of seasickness. Never in his life had Hans Castorp heard this word uttered so often in succession as here and now, yes, when he thought about it, it seemed to him that he himself had never uttered it or heard it from someone else's mouth. That might have been a mistake - at any rate he did not think that so frequent repetition would do the word any good. On the contrary, these slippery one and a half syllables with the tongue, the lip sound and the thin vowel in the middle became very repulsive to him in the long run, an image associated with it as of watered milk - something bluish-white, limp, especially in comparison with all the strength that Dr. Krokowski actually spoke about it. For so much became clear that one could say strong pieces without driving people out of the hall, if one started like he did. He was by no means content to broach, with a kind of intoxicating tact, things which were well known but which were shrouded in silence; he shattered illusions, he relentlessly honored knowledge, he left no room for sensitive belief in the dignity of the silver hair and the angelic purity of the tender child. Incidentally, he also wore his soft fall collar with his frock coat and his sandals over his gray socks, which made a fundamental and idealistic impression, even if Hans Castorp was a bit startled by it. By using books and loose sheets lying on the table in front of him, supporting his statements with all sorts of examples and anecdotes and even reciting verses several times, Dr. Krokowski of frightening forms of love, wondrous, painful and uncanny variations of its appearance and omnipotence. Of all natural instincts, he said, it is the most vacillating and endangered, fundamentally inclined to go astray and hopelessly wrong, and that shouldn't come as a surprise. For this mighty impulse is nothing simple, it is by its very nature multifaceted, and no matter how legitimate it may be as a whole, it is composed of sheer perversities. But since one now, and rightly so, Dr. Krokowski continues, but since one correctly refuses to infer the wrongness of the whole from the wrongness of the components, one is inevitably forced to claim a part of the legality of the whole, if not its entire legality, also for the individual wrongness gain weight. That is a requirement of logic, and he asks his listeners to stick to it. Mental resistance and correctives are there, decent and regulative instincts of - he might almost have said bourgeois kind, under whose balancing and restricting effect the wrong components merge into a regular and useful whole - a nevertheless frequent and welcome process, whose However, the result (as Dr. Krokowski added somewhat dismissively) was none of the doctor and thinker's concern. In another case, on the other hand, it didn't succeed, this process didn't want to and shouldn't succeed, and who, asked Dr. Krokowski, are you able to say whether this does not perhaps mean the nobler, spiritually more precious case? In this case, both groups of forces, the urge to love as well as those opposing impulses, among which shame and disgust are to be mentioned in particular, have an extraordinary tension and passion that exceeds the usual bourgeois level, and, guided in the depths of the soul, prevent the Struggle between them that containment, security and morality of the erring instincts, which lead to the usual harmony, to the love life according to the rules. This conflict between the powers of chastity and love - for that is what it is about - how will it end? It seems to end with the victory of chastity. Fear, prosperity, chaste abhorrence, a trembling need for purity, they suppressed love, kept it chained in obscurity, allowed its confused demands at best only partially, but by far not in their full variety and force into consciousness and into activity. But this victory of chastity is only an apparent and Pyrrhic victory, because the love command cannot be gagged, it cannot be violated, suppressed love is not dead, it is alive, it continues to strive in the dark and deep secret to fulfill itself, it breaks the spell of chastity and reappear, albeit in a transformed, unrecognizable form... And what then, then, is the form and mask in which the unapproved and suppressed love reappears? So asked Dr. Krokowski and looked down the rows as if earnestly awaiting the answer from his listeners. Yes, he now had to say that himself after he had already said so many things. No one but him knew, but he would definitely know that too, you could see that in his face. With his glowing eyes, waxy pallor, and black beard, wearing monk's sandals over gray woolen socks, he himself seemed to embody the struggle between chastity and passion of which he had spoken. At least that was Hans Castorp's impression while he, like everyone else, awaited with great excitement the answer as to the form in which illicit love would return. The women hardly breathed. Prosecutor Paravant quickly shook his ear again so that it would be open and receptive at the crucial moment. Then said Dr. Krokowski: In the form of the disease! The symptom of illness is disguised love activity and all illness transformed love.","And what was Dr. Krokowski saying? What was his line of thought? Hans Castorp summoned his wits to discover, not immediately succeeding, however, since he had not heard the beginning and lost still more while musing on Frau Chauchat’s flabby back. It was about a power, the power which—in short, it was about the power of love. Yes, of course; the subject was already given out in the general title of the whole course, and, moreover, this was Dr. Krokowski’s special field; of what else should he be talking? It was a bit odd, to be sure, listening to a lecture on such a theme, when previously Hans Castorp’s courses had dealt only with such matters as geared transmission in shipbuilding. No, really, how did one go about to discuss a subject of this delicate and private nature, in broad daylight, before a mixed audience? Dr. Krokowski did it by adopting a mingled terminology, partly poetic and partly erudite; ruthlessly scientific, yet with a vibrating, singsong delivery, which impressed young Hans Castorp as being unsuitable, but may have been the reason why the ladies looked flushed and the gentlemen flicked their ears to make them hear better. In particular the speaker employed the word love in a somewhat ambiguous sense, so that you were never quite sure where you were with it, or whether he had reference to its sacred or its passionate and fleshly aspect—and this doubt gave one a slightly seasick feeling. Never in all his life had Hans Castorp heard the word uttered so many times on end as he was hearing it now. When he reflected, it seemed to him he had never taken it in his own mouth, nor ever heard it from a stranger’s. That might not be the case, but whether it were or no, the word did not seem to him to repay such frequent repetition. The slippery monosyllable, with its lingual and labial, and the bleating vowel between—it came to sound positively offensive; it suggested watered milk, or anything else that was pale and insipid; the more so considering the meat for strong men Dr. Krokowski was in fact serving up. For it was plain that when one set about it like that, one could go pretty far without shocking anybody. He was not content to allude, with exquisite tact, to certain matters which are known to everybody, but which most people are content to pass over in silence. He demolished illusions, he was ruthlessly enlightened, he relentlessly destroyed all faith in the dignity of silver hairs and the innocence of the sucking babe. And he wore, with the frock-coat, his négligé collar, sandals, and grey woollen socks, and, thus attired, made an impression profoundly otherworldly, though at the same time not a little startling to young Hans Castorp. He supported his statements with a wealth of illustration and anecdote from the books and loose notes on the table before him; several times he even quoted poetry. And he discussed certain startling manifestations of the power of love, certain extraordinary, painful, uncanny variations, which the majestic phenomenon at times displayed. It was, he said, the most unstable, the most unreliable of man’s instincts, the most prone of its very essence to error and fatal perversion. In the which there was nothing that should cause surprise. For this mighty force did not consist of a single impulse, it was of its nature complex; it was built up out of components which, however legitimate they might be in composition, were, taken each by itself, sheer perversity. But—continued Dr. Krokowski—since we refuse, and rightly, to deduce the perversity of the whole from the perversity of its parts, we are driven to claim, for the component perversities, some part at least, though perhaps not all, of the justification which attaches to their united product. We were driven by sheer force of logic to this conclusion; Dr. Krokowski implored his hearers, having arrived at it, to hold it fast. Now there were psychical correctives, forces working in the other direction, instincts tending to conformability and regularity—he would almost have liked to characterize them as bourgeois; and these influences had the effect of merging the perverse components into a valid and irreproachable whole: a frequent and gratifying result, which, Dr. Krokowski almost contemptuously added, was, as such, of no further concern to the thinker and the physician. But on the other hand, there were cases where this result was not obtained, could not and should not be obtained; and who, Dr. Krokowski asked, would dare to say that these cases did not, psychically considered, form a higher, more exclusive type? For in these cases the two opposing groups of instincts—the compulsive force of love, and the sum of the impulses urging in the other direction, among which he would particularly mention shame and disgust—both exhibited an extraordinary and abnormal height and intensity when measured by the ordinary bourgeois standards; and the conflict between them which took place in the abysses of the soul prevented the erring instinct from attaining to that safe, sheltered, and civilized state which alone could resolve its difficulties in the prescribed harmonies of the love-life as experienced by the average human being. This conflict between the powers of love and chastity—for that was what it really amounted to—what was its issue? It ended, apparently, in the triumph of chastity. Love was suppressed, held in darkness and chains, by fear, conventionality, aversion, or a tremulous yearning to be pure. Her confused and tumultuous claims were never allowed to rise to consciousness or to come to proof in anything like their entire strength or multiformity. But this triumph of chastity was only an apparent, a pyrrhic victory; for the claims of love could not be crippled or enforced by any such means. The love thus suppressed was not dead; it lived, it laboured after fulfilment in the darkest and secretest depths of the being. It would break through the ban of chastity, it would emerge—if in a form so altered as to be unrecognizable. But what then was this form, this mask, in which suppressed, unchartered love would reappear? Dr. Krokowski asked the question, and looked along the listening rows as though in all seriousness expecting an answer. But he had to say it himself, who had said so much else already. No one knew save him, but it was plain that he did. Indeed, with his ardent eyes, his black beard setting off the waxen pallor of his face, his monkish sandals and grey woollen socks, he seemed to symbolize in his own person that conflict between passion and chastity which was his theme. At least so thought Hans Castorp, as with the others he waited in the greatest suspense to hear in what form love driven below the surface would reappear. The ladies barely breathed. Lawyer Paravant rattled his ear anew, that the critical moment might find it open and receptive. And Dr. Krokowski answered his own question, and said: “In the form of illness. Symptoms of disease are nothing but a disguised manifestation of the power of love; and all disease is only love transformed.”","And what was Dr. Krokowski talking about? What train of thought was he pursuing? Hans Castorp gathered his wits to try to catch up, but did not succeed right away, since he had not heard the beginning and then had missed still more of it while contemplating Frau Chauchat ’s rounded back. The subject was a force, the force . . . ah yes, the subject was the force of love. But of course, the same topic as in the title of the lecture series—what should Dr. Krokowski be talking about if not his specialty? It was indeed rather odd to hear a lecture about love, since the lectures he usually attended were about things like gear transmissions in ships. How did one go about discussing such a delicate subject, something of such a private nature, here in broad daylight, before an audience of both ladies and gentlemen? Dr. Krokowski discussed it by using a hybrid terminology, a blend of poetical and academic styles, all of it uncompromisingly scientific, but in an ornate, lilting tone, which seemed rather unsuitable to Hans Castorp, but which perhaps accounted for the flush on the ladies’ cheeks and the way the gentlemen kept flicking their ears. In particular, the orator constantly used the word “love” in a gently irresolute sense, so that one was never quite sure whether he meant its sanctified or more passionate and fleshly forms—leaving one feeling slightly nauseated and seasick. Never in his life had Hans Castorp heard this word spoken so many times in a row as he did here and now; indeed, when he thought about it, it seemed to him as if he had never spoken it himself before or heard it pass anyone else’s lips. He might have been mistaken—but at least he did not think such frequent repetition did the word any good, either. On the contrary, this slippery syllable with its lingual and labial consonants and scanty vowel in the middle really began to disgust him after a while, conjuring up for him somehow images of watery milk—something whitish-blue and insipid, particularly when compared with all the robust fodder that Dr. Krokowski was serving up. Because this much was clear, that if one went about it the way he did, one could say some very stiff things without driving people from the room. It was not enough for him to speak in tactful, intoxicating tones about matters that, although generally well known, are usually left under a veil of silence. He destroyed illusions, he was merciless in giving knowledge the honor it was due, he left no room for tender faith in the dignity of silver hair or in the angelic purity of little children. Along with his frock coat, by the way, he wore his soft, floppy collar and his sandals over gray socks, which gave the impression of some fundamental idealism, although Hans Castorp found the look rather startling. Supporting his arguments with all kinds of examples and anecdotes from the books and loose pages that lay on the table before him, even reciting poetry a few times, Dr. Krokowski discussed love’s frightening forms—bizarre, agonized, eerie mutations of its symptoms and omnipotence. Of all our natural instincts, he said, it was the most unstable and exposed, fundamentally prone to confusion and perversion—and no one should be surprised at that. Because there was nothing simple about this powerful instinct. It was by its very nature composed of many elements, and however legitimate this instinct was when regarded as a whole, each of its constituent elements was a perversion. But since, and quite rightly so, Dr. Krokowski continued, one ought not conclude that the whole was itself a perversion simply because its parts were, one was therefore compelled to enlist the legitimacy of the whole, if not its whole legitimacy, and apply it to each of the perverse parts. Logic demanded it, and he begged his listeners to keep that in mind. There were counteracting and corrective psychic factors, wholesome and ordering instincts—one might almost call them bourgeois—under whose compensating and modifying effects perverse components were fused to a consistent and useful whole; and this was, all in all, a common and welcome process, whose consequences, however (as Dr. Krokowski rather superciliously remarked), were of no importance to the physician or thinker. But in other cases that process might not succeed—would not, indeed could not, succeed—and who could say, Dr. Krokowski asked, if those psyches were not perhaps the more noble, the more precious? In such a case, to be precise, the two clusters of forces, both those of the love instinct and the impulses hostile to it, among which shame and disgust were to be noted in particular, exhibited tensions and passions that exceeded all normal bourgeois bounds; and the ensuing battle between these two forces, which was now carried out in the depths of the soul, prevented wayward instincts from being restrained, steadied, and civilized in the manner necessary for a normal, harmonious, and appropriate love life. And how did it end, this clash between the forces of chastity and love—for those were indeed the forces involved? It ended to all appearances with the triumph of chastity. Fear, conventionality, aversion born of modesty, the quivering longing for purity—all these repressed love, held it chained in darkness, at best giving in only partially to its wild demands, but certainly never permitting them a conscious, active existence in all their variety and vigor. Except that chastity only apparently triumphed, its victory was a Pyrrhic victory, because the demands of love could not be fettered, or coerced; suppressed love was not dead, it continued to live on in the dark, secret depths, straining for fulfillment—and broke the bands of chastity and reappeared, though in transmuted, unrecognizable form. And in what form or mask did suppressed and unsanctioned love reappear? Dr. Krokowski looked up and down the rows as he asked this question, as if seriously expecting an answer from his listeners. But no, he would have to provide the answer himself, though he had already provided so many. No one else knew the answer, but he would be sure to know this, too —you could see it just by looking at him. With his glowing eyes, his waxen pallor, his black beard, and those monastic sandals over gray woolen socks, he seemed to symbolize in his person the battle between chastity and passion about which he had been speaking. At least this was Hans Castorp’s impression, as he sat there expectantly waiting, along with all the others, to learn in what form unsanctioned love would reappear. The women were barely breathing. Prosecutor Paravant quickly gave his ear another flick, to make sure that it would be open and receptive. And Dr. Krokowski said: In the form of illness! Any symptom of illness was a masked form of love in action, and illness was merely transformed love."
"»Ich bin seit langer Zeit hier oben, Mynheer Peeperkorn, seit Jahren und Tagen, – genau weiß ich es nicht, wie lange, aber es sind Lebensjahre, darum sprach ich von ›Leben‹, und auch auf das ›Schicksal‹ werde ich im rechten Augenblick noch zurück{925}kommen. Mein Vetter, den ich etwas zu besuchen dachte, ein Militär, der es redlich und brav im Sinne hatte, aber das half ihm nichts, ist mir hier weggestorben, und ich bin immer noch da. Ich war nicht Militär, ich hatte einen Zivilberuf, wie Sie vielleicht gehört haben, einen handfesten und vernünftigen Beruf, der angeblich sogar in völkerverbindender Richtung wirkt, aber ich war ihm nie sonderlich verbunden, das gebe ich zu, und zwar aus Gründen, von denen ich nur sagen will, daß sie im Dunklen liegen: Sie liegen da zusammen mit den Ursprüngen meiner Empfindungen für Ihre Reisebegleiterin – ich nenne sie ausdrücklich so, um zu bekunden, daß es mir nicht einfällt, an der positiven Rechtslage rütteln zu wollen – meiner Empfindungen für Clawdia Chauchat und meines Duzverhältnisses zu ihr, das ich nie verleugnet habe, seit ihre Augen mir zuerst begegneten und es mir antaten, – es mir in unvernünftigem Sinne antaten, verstehen Sie. Ihr zuliebe und Herrn Settembrini zum Trotz habe ich mich dem Prinzip der Unvernunft, dem genialen Prinzip der Krankheit unterstellt, dem ich freilich wohl von langer Hand und jeher schon unterstand, und bin hier oben geblieben, – ich weiß nicht mehr genau, wie lange, ich habe alles vergessen und mit allem gebrochen, mit meinen Verwandten und meinem flachländischen Beruf und allen meinen Aussichten. Und als Clawdia abreiste, habe ich auf sie gewartet, immer hier oben gewartet, so daß ich nun dem Flachland völlig abhanden gekommen und in seinen Augen so gut wie tot bin. Das hatte ich im Sinn, als ich von ›Schicksal‹ sprach und mir anzudeuten erlaubte, daß es mir allenfalls zustände, mich über die gegenwärtige Rechtslage zu beklagen. Ich habe einmal eine Geschichte gelesen, – nein, ich habe sie im Theater gesehen, wie ein gutmütiger Junge – er war übrigens Militär, wie mein Vetter, – es mit einer reizenden Zigeunerin zu tun bekommt, – sie war reizend, mit einer Blume hinter dem Ohr, ein wildes, fatales Frauenzimmer, und sie tat es ihm der{926}maßen an, daß er vollständig entgleiste, ihr alles opferte, fahnenflüchtig wurde, mit ihr zu den Schmugglern ging und sich in jeder Richtung entehrte. Als er soweit war, hatte sie genug von ihm und kam mit einem Matador daher, einer zwingenden Persönlichkeit mit prachtvollem Bariton. Es endete damit, daß der kleine Soldat, kreideweiß im Gesicht und in offenem Hemd, sie vor dem Zirkus mit seinem Messer erstach, wo- rauf sie es übrigens geradezu angelegt hatte. Es ist eine ziem- lich beziehungslose Geschichte, auf die ich da komme. Aber schließlich, warum fällt sie mir ein?«","'I've been up here a long time, Mynheer Peeperkorn, years and days—I don't know exactly how long, but it's years of life, that's why I spoke of 'life', and I'll also mention 'fate' in the come back{925}at the right moment. My cousin, whom I thought of visiting, a military man who meant it honestly and well, but that didn't help him, died here and I'm still here. I wasn't in the military, I had a civilian job, as you may have heard, a solid and sensible job that is said to even work in a unifying direction, but I've never been particularly attached to it, I'll admit, for reasons one of those I just want to say that they lie in the dark: They lie there together with the origins of my feelings for your traveling companion - I call them that expressly to say that it does not occur to me to want to shake the positive legal position - of my feelings for Clawdia Chauchat and my intimate relationship with her, which I've never denied since her eyes first met me and did it to me—did it to me in an unreasonable sense, you see. For her sake and in defiance of Mr. Settembrini, I have submitted to the principle of unreasonableness, the ingenious principle of illness, which I have of course been subject to for a long time and have always been subject to, and I stayed up here - I don't remember exactly how long, I have forgotten everything and broken with everything, with my relatives and my lowland profession and all my prospects. And when Clawdia left I waited for her, always waited up here, so that now I'm utterly lost to the flatlands and as good as dead in their eyes. That's what I had in mind when I spoke of 'fate' and allowed myself to suggest that I could at best complain about the current legal situation. I read a story once - no, I saw it in the theater - how a good-natured boy - he was a military man, like my cousin - has to deal with a lovely gypsy - she was lovely, with a flower behind the ear, a wild, fatal woman, and she did it to him so much that he completely derailed, sacrificed everything to her, deserted, went with her to the smugglers and dishonored himself in every direction. By the time he was ready, she had enough of him and came up with a matador, a compelling personality with a gorgeous baritone. It ended with the little soldier, white-faced and shirtless, stabbing her with his knife in front of the circus, which, by the way, she was about to do. It's a pretty unrelated story I'm getting at here. But after all, why do I think of it?'","“I have been up here a long time, Mynheer Peeperkorn, years. How long I hardly know myself, but it has been years of my life. My cousin, to visit whom I came up, in the first instance, was a soldier, an upright and honourable soul, but that was no help to him—he died, and left me, and I remained here alone. I was no soldier, but a civilian, I had a profession, as you may have heard, a good, two-fisted job, which is even supposed to do its share in drawing together the nations of the earth—but somehow it did not draw me. I admit this freely; but the reasons for it I cannot describe otherwise than to say that they are veiled in obscurity, the same obscurity that envelops the origin of my feeling for Madame your mistress—I call her that expressly to show that I am not thinking of undermining the situation as it exists—my feeling for Clavdia Chauchat, and my intimate sense of her being, which I have had since the first moment her eyes met mine and bewitched me, enchanted me, you understand, beyond all reason. For love of her, in defiance of Herr Settembrini, I declared myself for the principle of unreason, the spirituel principle of disease, under whose ægis I had already, in reality, stood for a long time back; and I remained up here , I no longer know precisely how long. I have forgotten, broken with, everything, my relatives, my calling, all my ideas of life. When Clavdia went away, I waited here for her return, so that now I am wholly lost to life down below, and dead in the eyes of my friends. That is what I meant when I spoke of my destiny, and said there might be some justice in a complaint over my present state. I have read a story—no, I saw it in the theatre: a good-natured youth, a soldier like my cousin, who comes to know a charming gipsy— charming she was, with a flower behind her ear, a wild and fatal creature, who so bewitches him that he goes off altogether, sacrifices everything to her, deserts the colours, joins the smugglers, dishonours himself in every way. Well, when he has got so far, she for her part has had enough of him, and takes up with a matador, a forceful personality with a magnificent baritone voice. The end of it all is that the little soldier, white as a sheet, shirt open at the throat, stabs his mistress with his knife in front of the circus—which, after all, she brought upon herself. It is rather a pointless story after all: how did I come to think of it?”","And with that, Hans Castorp went on: “I have been up here for a long time, Mynheer Peeperkorn, for years and years—I don’t precisely know how long now, but they are years of my life, which was why I spoke just now of ‘life’—and I shall return to the matter of ‘fate’ at the appropriate moment. My cousin, whom I came here to visit, was a military man, an honest and good fellow, but that did not help him—he died here, leaving me behind, and here I am still. I was not a military man myself, I had chosen a civilian profession, as you have perhaps heard, a sturdy, reasonable profession, of which it is even said that it may bring nations closer together, but of which I was never particularly fond, I must admit. As to the reasons, I can only say that they lie in darkness, lie there together with the origins of my sentiments toward your traveling companion—and I expressly call her that to make clear that it would never occur to me to try to alter a legitimate state of affairs—with the origins of my sentiments toward Clavdia Chauchat and of my addressing her with only informal pronouns, a relationship that I never denied from the moment her eyes first met mine and fascinated me—fascinated me in the most irrational sense of the word, you understand. For the sake of her love and in spite of Herr Settembrini, I subordinated myself to the principle of irrationality, to the principle behind the genius of illness, to which, admittedly, I had long since, perhaps from the very start, submitted myself and to which I have remained true up here—for how long now, I no longer know, I have forgotten everything, broken off with everything, with my relatives and my profession in the flatlands, with all my prospects. And when Clavdia departed, I waited for her, just went on waiting up here, so that the flatlands is entirely lost to me now, and in its eyes I am as good as dead. That is what I meant when I spoke of ‘fate,’ and went so far as to suggest that I might possibly have cause to complain about my present situation. I once read a story—no, I saw it in the theater—about how a good-hearted young fellow, a military man like my cousin, by the way, gets involved with an enchanting Gypsy—and she was enchanting, with a flower behind her ear, a savage, mischievous creature, and he was so fascinated with her that he got completely off-track, sacrificed everything for her, deserted the colors, ran off with her to join a band of smugglers and disgraced himself in every way. And after he had done all that, she had enough of him, and came along with a matador, a compelling personality with a splendid baritone. It ended outside the bullring, with the little soldier, his face chalky white, his shirt unbuttoned, stabbing her with a knife, though you might say she as good as planned the whole thing herself. A rather pointless story, really, now that I think of it. But then, why did it occur to me?”"
"Es war also die Woche verschlungen und die Sonntagnachmittagspoststunde wieder in Kraft getreten, nicht anders, als wäre es immer noch die von vor sieben Tagen. Aufs erregendste fuhr sie fort, Gelegenheit zu machen, barg und bot in jeder Minute die Möglichkeit, mit Frau Chauchat in gesellschaftliche Beziehungen zu treten: Möglichkeiten, von denen Hans Castorp sich das Herz pressen und jagen ließ, ohne sie ins Wirkliche übertreten zu lassen. Dem standen Hemmungen entgegen, die teils militärischer, teils zivilistischer Natur waren: – teils nämlich mit der Gegenwart des ehrenhaften Joachim und mit Hans Castorps eigener Ehre und Pflicht zusammenhingen, teils aber auch in dem Gefühl ihren Grund hatten, daß gesellschaftliche Beziehungen zu Clawdia Chauchat, ge{365}sittete Beziehungen, bei denen man »Sie« sagte und Verbeugungen machte und womöglich Französisch sprach, – nicht nötig, nicht wünschenswert, nicht das Richtige seien … Er stand und sah sie lachend sprechen, genau wie Pribislav Hippe dereinst auf dem Schulhof sprechend gelacht hatte: ihr Mund öffnete sich ziemlich weit dabei, und ihre schiefstehenden graugrünen Augen über den Backenknochen zogen sich zu schmalen Ritzen zusammen. Das war durchaus nicht »schön«; aber es war, wie es war, und bei der Verliebtheit kommt das ästhetische Vernunfturteil so wenig zu seinem Recht, wie das moralische. –","So the week had swallowed up and the Sunday afternoon post hour was back in effect, no different than it had been seven days ago. In the most exciting way, she continued to create opportunities, harbored and offered every minute the opportunity to enter into social relations with Frau Chauchat: opportunities that Hans Castorp let his heart press and chase without letting them become reality. This was opposed by inhibitions which were partly of a military, partly of a civil nature: - partly connected with the presence of the honorable Joachim and with Hans Castorp's own honor and duty, but partly also based on the feeling that social relations with Clawdia Chauchat, civilized relationships in which one said ""Sie"" and made bows and possibly spoke French - were not necessary, not desirable, not the right thing ... He stood and watched her speak laughing, just as Pribislav Hippe once did in the schoolyard had laughed eloquently: her mouth opened quite wide and her slanting grey-green eyes narrowed over her cheekbones to form narrow slits. It wasn't ""nice"" at all; but it was the way it was, and when someone is in love, the aesthetic, rational judgment is no more justified than the moral one. –","Well, the week had been somehow devoured, and the hour for the Sunday afternoon post came round again, so like the other it seemed never to have changed. Like to that other, what thrilling opportunities it offered, what prospects lay concealed within it of coming into social relations with Frau Chauchat! Prospects that made the heart of young Hans Castorp leap and contract, yet without actually issuing in action; for against their doing so lay certain obstacles of a nature partly military, partly civil. In other words, they were in part the fruit of Joachim’s presence, in part the result of Hans Castorp’s own moral compunctions; but also, in part, they rested upon his sure intuition that social relations with Frau Chauchat, conventional relations, in which one made bows and addressed her as madame, and spoke French as far as possible, were not the thing at all, were neither necessary nor desirable. He stood and watched her laugh as she spoke, precisely as Pribislav Hippe had laughed as he spoke, that time in the school yard: she opened her mouth rather wide, and her slanting, grey-green eyes narrowed themselves to slits above the cheek-bones. That was, to be sure, not “beautiful”; but when one is in love, the aesthetic judgment counts for as little as the moral.","And so the week had been devoured, it was Sunday afternoon and the distribution of the mail was proceeding as if this were still the Sunday of seven days before. The procedure continued to provide the most exciting opportunities; each minute concealed and offered possibilities of coming into social contact with Frau Chauchat—and Hans Castorp let those possibilities squeeze his heart and make it flutter, but never actually let them become reality. Certain inhibitions stood in the way, some military, some civilian—which is to say, some that were due to Joachim’s honorable presence and Hans Castorp’s own sense of honor and duty; some, however, were based in the feeling that social contact with Clavdia Chauchat—a civilized relationship, with formal pronouns and bows and conversation in French perhaps—was not necessary, not desirable, not the right thing at all. He stood there and watched her smile and talk, just as Pribislav Hippe had smiled and talked in the schoolyard years before, her mouth open rather wide and her slanting gray-green eyes above her strong cheekbones narrowing to little slits. The effect was not “beautiful” at all; but it was what it was, and when a man is in love his aesthetic opinions are no more valid than his moral judgments."
"Es war rührend zu sehen, wie Hans Castorp arbeitete, um sich artig zu erweisen und seiner Schläfrigkeit Herr zu werden. Er ärgerte sich, so schlecht in Form zu sein und sah mit dem mißtrauischen Selbstbewußtsein junger Leute in dem Lächeln und dem aufmunternden Wesen des Assistenten Zeichen nachsichtigen Spottes. Er antwortete, indem er von den drei Wochen sprach, auch seines Examens erwähnte und hinzufügte, daß er, gottlob, ganz gesund sei.","It was touching to see how Hans Castorp worked to behave and to get his sleepiness under control. He was annoyed at being in such bad shape and, with the suspicious self-confidence of young people, saw the assistant's smile and encouraging demeanor as signs of indulgent mockery. He replied by talking about the three weeks, also mentioning his exams and adding that, thank God, he was quite healthy.","It was touching to see Hans Castorp labour to master his drowsiness and be polite. It annoyed him to be in such bad form, and with the self-consciousness of youth he read signs of indulgent amusement in the warmth of the Assistant’s manner. He replied, mentioning his examinations and his three weeks’ visit, and ended by saying he was, thank God, perfectly healthy.","It was touching to see how Hans Castorp struggled to be polite and master his drowsiness. He was annoyed with himself for being in such bad shape, and with the leery self-consciousness of youth he detected traces of an indulgent smirk in the assistant director’s reassuring smile. In answering, he said something about three weeks, mentioned his exams, and added that, thank God, he was perfectly healthy."
"Es war kühl, er schrieb im Paletot, in eine Decke gehüllt, mit geröteten Händen. Manchmal blickte er auf von seinem Papier, das sich mit vernünftigen und überzeugenden Sätzen bedeckte, und blickte in die vertraute Landschaft, die er kaum noch sah, dieses gestreckte Tal mit dem heute glasig-bleichen Gipfelgeschiebe am Ausgang, dem hell besiedelten Grunde, der manchmal sonnig aufglänzte, und den teils waldrauhen, teils wiesigen Lehnen, von denen Kuhgeläut kam. Er schrieb mit wachsender Leichtigkeit und verstand nicht mehr, wie er sich vor dem Brief hatte fürchten können. Im Schreiben begriff er selbst, daß nichts einleuchtender sein konnte, als seine Darlegungen, und daß sie zu Hause selbstverständlich das vollkommenste Einverständnis finden würden. Ein junger Mann seiner Klasse und in seinen Verhältnissen tat etwas für sich, wenn es sich als ratsam erwies, er machte Gebrauch von den eigens für seinesgleichen bereitgestellten Bequemlichkeiten. So gehörte es sich. Wäre er heimgereist, – man hätte ihn auf {342}seinen Bericht hin wieder heraufgeschickt. Er bat, ihm zukommen zu lassen, was er brauchte. Auch um regelmäßige Anweisung der nötigen Geldmittel bat er zum Schluß; mit 800 Mark monatlich sei alles zu decken.","It was chilly, he wrote in his paletot, wrapped in a blanket, his hands red. Sometimes he looked up from his paper, which was covered with sensible and persuasive sentences, and looked at the familiar landscape, which he hardly saw anymore, this stretched valley with the now glassy-pale mountain debris at the end, the brightly populated bottom, which sometimes gleamed in the sun, and the partly rough forest, partly meadow meadows, from which came the cowbells. He wrote with increasing ease and no longer understood how he could have been afraid of the letter. As he wrote, he himself understood that nothing could be more plausible than his explanations, and that they would, of course, find complete agreement at home. A young man of his class and circumstances did something for himself when it proved expedient, availing himself of the comforts specially made available for his own kind. That's how it should be. Had he gone home, he would have been sent up {342}upon his report. He asked that what he needed be sent to him. Finally, he also asked for regular transfers of the necessary funds; everything can be covered with 800 marks a month.","The weather was cool, he sat in his overcoat, with a rug about him, and his hands were cold. At times he looked up from the paper which he was covering with these reasonable and sensible phrases, at the landscape now so familiar he scarcely saw it any more: this extended valley with its retreating succession of peaks at the entrance—they looked pale and glassy to-day—with its bright and populous floor, which glistened when the sun shone full upon it, and its forest-clad or meadowy slopes, whence came the sound of cow-bells. He wrote with growing ease, and wondered why he had dreaded to write. For as he wrote he felt that nothing could be clearer than his presentation of the matter, and that there was no doubt it would meet with perfect comprehension at home. A young man of his class and circumstances acted for himself when it seemed advisable; he took advantage of the facilities which existed expressly for him and his like. So it was fitting. If he had taken the journey home, they would have made him come back again on hearing his report. He asked them to send what things he needed. And at the end he asked to have money sent: a monthly cheque of eight hundred marks would cover everything.","It was cool; he was wearing his overcoat, had wrapped himself in a blanket, and his hands turned red as he wrote. At times he would look up from his paper, covered with reasonable and convincing phrases, and gaze out into the familiar landscape, which he hardly noticed anymore: the long valley, its exit blocked today by pale, glassy peaks; the bright pattern of settlement along its floor, glistening now and then in the sun; and the slopes, covered partly by rugged forests, partly by meadows, from which the sound of cowbells drifted. Writing came more easily as he went along, and he no longer understood how he could possibly have been afraid of this letter. As he wrote, he came to see that nothing could be more plausible than his explanations and that of course his family at home would be in perfect agreement with them. A young man of his social class and circumstances took care of himself when that proved advisable, he made use of facilities set aside expressly for him and people like him. That was only proper. Had he returned home, they would have sent him right back up here upon hearing his report. He now asked them to send the things he needed. And in conclusion he asked that necessary funds be sent regularly. Eight hundred marks a month would take care of everything."
"»Ich schwitze etwas«, sagte er. »Willkommen, junger Mann. Im Gegenteil. Nehmen Sie Platz! Das ist ein Zeichen von Schwäche, wenn einem nach Einnahme eines warmen Getränkes sogleich – Wollen Sie mir – Ganz recht. Das Taschentuch. Ich danke sehr.« Übrigens verlor sich die Röte bald und machte der gelblichen Blässe Platz, die nach einem malignen Anfall des großartigen Mannes Gesicht zu bedecken pflegte. Das Quartanfieber war stark gewesen diesen Vormittag, in allen drei Stadien, dem kalten, dem glühenden und dem feuchten, und Peeperkorns kleine, blasse Augen blickten matt unter der idolhaften Stirnlineatur. Er sagte:","""I'm sweating a bit,"" he said. 'Welcome, young man. On the contrary. Have a seat! It's a sign of weakness if, after taking a warm drink, you immediately - Do you want me - Quite right. The handkerchief. Thank you very much.” Incidentally, the blush soon disappeared, giving way to the yellowish pallor that used to cover the great man's face after an attack of malignancy. The quartan fever had been strong this morning, in all three stages, the cold, the scorching, and the damp, and Peeperkorn's small, pale eyes looked dull beneath the idolic forehead line. He said:","“I am sweating somewhat,” he said. “Come in, young man, come in. On the contrary. Sit down. It is a sign of weakness when one takes a hot drink and sweats thereafter. Will you—quite right—a handkerchief—thank you.” The flush soon faded and gave place to the yellowish pallor which was Mynheer’s facial teint after a bad attack. The fever had been severe this morning, and in all three stages, the cold, the hot, the moist; Peeperkorn’s little eyes looked tired beneath the lined, masklike brow. He said: “It is—by all means, young man.","“I’m sweating a little,” he said. “Welcome, young man. On the contrary. Have a seat. It is a sign of weakness when one no sooner enjoys a hot drink than—Would you please? Quite, right, the handkerchief. Thanks so much.” The flush soon left his face, however, making way for the yellow pallor that usually came to the man’s face after a malign attack. The quartan fever had been fierce that morning, in all three of its’ stages—the chill, the hot flush, and the sweats—and Peeperkorn’s little pale eyes gazed out dully from under the idol-like tracery of his brow. “It is—by all means, young man,” he said."
"Später kam der Schlummer. Aber mit ihm kamen die krausen Traumbilder, noch krausere, als in der ersten Nacht, aus denen er des öfteren schreckhaft oder einem wirren Einfall nachjagend emporfuhr. Ihm träumte, er sähe Hofrat Behrens mit krummen Knien und steif nach vorn hängenden Armen die Gartenpfade dahinwandeln, indem er seine langen und gleichsam öde anmutenden Schritte einer fernen Marschmusik anpaßte. Als der Hofrat vor Hans Castorp stehenblieb, trug er eine Brille mit dicken, kreisrunden Gläsern und faselte Ungereimtes. »Zivilist natürlich«, sagte er und zog, ohne um Erlaubnis zu bitten, Hans Castorps Augenlid mit Zeige- und Mittelfinger seiner riesigen Hand herunter. »Ehrsamer Zivilist, wie ich {140}gleich bemerkte. Aber nicht ohne Talent, gar nicht ohne Talent zur erhöhten Allgemeinverbrennung! Würde mit den Jährchen nicht geizen, den flotten Dienstjährchen bei uns hier oben! Na, nun mal hoppla die Herren und los mit dem Lustwandel!« rief er, indem er seine beiden enormen Zeigefinger in den Mund steckte und so eigentümlich wohllautend darauf pfiff, daß von verschiedenen Seiten und in verkleinerter Gestalt die Lehrerin und Miß Robinson durch die Lüfte geflogen kamen und sich ihm rechts und links auf die Schultern setzten, wie sie im Speisesaal rechts und links von Hans Castorp saßen. So ging der Hofrat mit hüpfenden Tritten davon, wobei er mit einer Serviette hinter die Brille fuhr, um sich die Augen zu wischen, – man wußte nicht, was da zu trocknen war, ob Schweiß oder Tränen.","Slumber came later. But with him came the crooked dream images, even more crooked than the first night, from which he often awoke, frightened or chasing a confused idea. He dreamed that he saw Hofrat Behrens walking along the garden paths with bent knees and arms hanging stiffly in front of him, while he adapted his long and seemingly tedious steps to distant marching music. When the privy councilor stopped in front of Hans Castorp, he was wearing thick, round glasses and was rambling nonsensically. ""Civilian, of course,"" he said, and without asking permission, pulled down Hans Castorp's eyelid with the index and middle fingers of his huge hand. 'Respectable civilian, as I {140}remarked at once. But not without talent, not at all without talent for increased general combustion! Wouldn't be stingy with the little years, the brisk years of service with us up here! he called, putting his two enormous forefingers in his mouth and whistling in such a peculiarly euphonious way that the teacher and Miss Robinson, on different sides and in reduced form, flew through the air came flying and sat on either side of his shoulders, just as they sat on either side of Hans Castorp in the dining room. So the privy councilor went off with hopping steps, slipping a serviette behind his glasses to wipe his eyes—you didn't know what was there to dry, whether it was sweat or tears.","Later he went to sleep. But with sleep returned the involved dreams, even more involved than those of the first night—out of which he often started up in fright, or pursuing some confused fancy. He seemed to see Hofrat Behrens walking down the garden path, with bent knees and arms hanging stiffly in front of him, adapting his long and somehow solitary-looking stride to the time of distant march-music. As he paused before Hans Castorp, the latter saw that he was wearing a pair of glasses with thick, round lenses. He was uttering all sorts of nonsense. “A civilian, of course,” he said, and without saying by your leave, drew down Hans Castorp’s eyelid with the first and middle fingers of his huge hand. “Respectable civilian, as I saw at once. But not without talent, not at all without talent for a heightened degree of oxidization. Wouldn’t grudge us a year, he wouldn’t, just one little short year of service up here. Well, hullo-ullo! gentlemen, on with the exercise,” he shouted, and putting his two enormous first fingers in his mouth, emitted a whistle of such peculiarly pleasing quality that from opposite directions Miss Robinson and the schoolmistress, much smaller than life-size, came flying through the air and perched themselves right and left on the Hofrat’s shoulders, just as they sat right and left of Hans Castorp in the dining-room. And the Hofrat skipped away, wiping his eyes behind his glasses with a table-napkin—but whether it was tears or sweat he wiped could not be told.","Sleep did come later. But with it came dreams even more tortuous than those of the night before and from which several times he started up in fright or in pursuit of some strange fancy. He dreamed that he saw Director Behrens wandering along the paths of the garden, his knees slightly bent, his arms hanging stiffly at an angle in front of him, matching his slow and yet somehow bleak strides to the rhythm of march music in the distance. When the director came to a halt in front of Hans Castorp, he was wearing glasses with thick, circular lenses and was babbling nonsense. “Civilian, of course,” he said and without asking permission extended two fingers of his gigantic hand and pulled down Hans Castorp’s eyelid. “Respectable civilian, I could tell right off. But not without talent, certainly not without talent for raising his general metabolism. Won’t be stingy about a few little years, a few spiffing years of service with us up here. But, whoops, gentlemen, do get on with your promenade!” he cried, sticking both enormous forefingers in his mouth and giving a whistle so euphonious that the teacher and Miss Robinson, both shrunk in size, came flying through the air from different directions and sat down on the director’s shoulders, one to the right, one to the left, just as they sat on either side of Hans Castorp in the dining hall. And then the director went hopping away, all the while pushing his napkin up behind his glasses to dry his eyes—it was unclear whether this was to wipe away sweat or tears."
"»Schön, daß ich das hier noch mitmache«, sagte Hans Castorp zu seinem Vetter. »Wir haben es manchmal so elend gehabt, – es ist ja ganz, als hätten wir den Winter schon hinter uns und nun käme die gute Zeit.« Er hatte recht. Wenige Merkmale deuteten auf den wahren Sachverhalt, und auch diese waren unscheinbar. Nahm man ein paar gepflanzte Ahorne beiseite, die unten in »Platz« nur eben ihr Leben fristeten und längst mutlos ihre Blätter hatten fallen lassen, so gab es keine Laubbäume hier, deren Zustand der Landschaft das Gepräge der Jahreszeit aufgedrückt hätte, und nur die zwittrige Alpenerle, die weiche Nadeln trägt und diese wie Blätter wechselt, zeigte sich herbstlich kahl. Der übrige Baumschmuck der Gegend, ob ragend oder geduckt, war immergrünes Nadelholz, fest gegen den Winter, der, undeutlich eingeschränkt, seine Schneestürme hier über das ganze Jahr verteilen darf; und nur ein mehrfach gestufter, roströtlicher Ton über dem Forst ließ trotz dem Sommerbrande des Himmels das sinkende Jahr erkennen. Freilich waren da, näher zugesehen, noch die Wiesenblumen, die gleichfalls leise zur Sache redeten. Es gab das orchideenähnliche Knabenkraut, die staudenförmige Akelei nicht mehr, die bei des Besuchers Ankunft noch das Gehänge geschmückt hatten, und auch die wilde Nelke war nicht mehr da. Nur noch der Enzian, die kurzaufsitzende Herbstzeitlose waren zu sehen und gaben Bescheid über eine gewisse innere Frische der oberflächlich erhitzten Atmosphäre, eine Kühle, die dem Ruhenden, äußerlich fast Versengten plötzlich ans Gebein treten konnte, wie ein Frostschauer dem Fieberglühenden.","""It's nice that I'm still doing this,"" said Hans Castorp to his cousin. ""We've had it so miserably sometimes - it's as if we'd already put the winter behind us and now the good times were coming."" He was right. Few features pointed to the true facts, and even these were inconspicuous. If you put aside a few planted maples, which were just eking out a living down in ""Platz"" and had long since dropped their despondent leaves, there were no deciduous trees here whose condition had stamped the stamp of the season on the landscape, and only the hermaphrodite Alpine alder, which bears soft needles and changes them like leaves, was bare in autumn. The rest of the tree ornaments of the area, whether towering or crouching, were evergreen softwoods, strong against the winter, which, vaguely restricted, is allowed to spread its blizzards here all year round; and despite the summer blaze in the sky, only a multi-layered, rust-red tone over the forest indicated the sinking of the year. Of course, if you looked closer, there were still the meadow flowers, which also spoke quietly to the point. There was no longer the orchid-like orchid, the shrub-like columbine that had adorned the hangings when the visitor arrived, and the wild carnation was no longer there either. Only the gentian, the short-seated autumn crocus could be seen and gave an indication of a certain inner freshness in the superficially heated atmosphere, a coolness that could suddenly kick at the bones of the resting, almost scorched on the outside, like a shiver of frost on a feverish person.","“I’m glad I’m here still, for this,” said Hans Castorp to his cousin. “It has been so wretched at times, and now it is as though we had the winter behind us, and only good weather to look forward to.” He was quite right. There were indeed not many signs that pointed to the true state of the calendar; and even those there were did not strike the eye. Aside from the few oak-trees that had been set out down in the Platz, where they had just managed to survive, and long before now had despondently shed their leaves, the whole region held no deciduous trees to give the landscape an autumnal cast; only the hybrid Alpine alder, which renews its soft needles as though they were leaves, showed a wintry baldness. The other trees of the region, whether towering or stunted, were evergreen pines and firs, invincible against the assaults of this irregular winter, which might scatter its snow-storms through all the months of the year: only the many-shaded, rust-red tone that lay over the forest gave notice, despite the glowing sunshine, of a declining year. Yet, looking closer, there were the wild flowers, speaking, though softly, yet to the same effect; the meadow orchis, the bushy aquilegia were no longer in bloom, only the gentian and the lowly autumn crocus, bearing witness to the inner sharpness of the superficially heated air, that could pierce one to the bone as one sat, like a chill in fever, though one glowed outwardly from the ardour of the sun.","“I’m glad I’m still here to enjoy this,” Hans Castorp said to his cousin. “It’s been so wretched at times—and now it seems as if we already had winter behind us and the nice weather lay ahead.” And he was right. There were few signs to indicate the true state of affairs, and even those were inconspicuous. Some maples that had been planted down in Platz, but were barely surviving, had long since despondently shed their leaves; otherwise there were no hardwoods here to give the landscape the characteristic look of the season—only the hybrid Alpine alders, which drop their soft needles like leaves, were bare and autumnal. The rest of the trees adorning the region, whether tall or stunted, were evergreens steeled against winter, the boundaries of which were so vague that it could scatter snowstorms across the whole year; and only several subtle shades of rusty red that lay over the forest told of a dying year, despite the blazing sun. To be sure, if you looked more closely, there were wildflowers that gently made the same point. Gone now were the purple orchis and bushy columbine, even the wild pink, all of which had adorned the slopes at the visitor’s arrival. Only the gentian and stubby meadow crocus were still in bloom, and they attested to a freshness hidden within the superficially heated air, a chill that could suddenly go straight to the bone as you lay there singed by the sun, like an icy shiver in the midst of fever."

"»Ingenieur!« sagte Settembrini zornig und ermahnend. »Nehmen Sie sich zusammen und lassen Sie mich mit diesem liederlichen Unsinn in Ruhe! Ich weiß nichts davon und will nichts davon wissen. – Im vierundzwanzigsten, sagten Sie? Hm … gestatten Sie mir noch eine Frage oder einen unmaßgeblichen Vorschlag, wenn Sie so wollen. Da der Aufenthalt Ihnen nicht zuträglich zu sein scheint, da Sie sich körperlich und, wenn mich nicht alles täuscht, auch seelisch nicht wohl bei uns befinden, – wie wäre es denn da, wenn Sie darauf verzichteten, hier älter zu werden, kurz, wenn Sie noch heute nacht wieder aufpackten und sich morgen mit den fahrplanmäßigen Schnellzügen auf- und davonmachten?«","""Engineer!"" said Settembrini angrily and admonishingly. 'Pull yourself together and leave me alone with this slovenly nonsense! I know nothing about it and I don't want to know anything about it. - In the twenty-fourth, you said? Hmm… allow me one more question or one irrelevant suggestion if you will. Since your stay doesn't seem to be beneficial for you, since you don't feel well with us physically and, if I'm not mistaken, also mentally, how would it be if you refrained from growing older here, in short, if Packed them up again tonight and headed off on the scheduled express trains tomorrow?”","“Engineer,” Settembrini said sharply, almost angrily, “pull yourself together and stop talking this demoralized rubbish. I know nothing about it, nor do I wish to. You are in your twenty-fourth year, you say? H’m. Permit me to put another question, or rather, with your kind permission, make a suggestion. As your stay up here with us does not appear to be conducive, as you don’t feel comfortable, either physically or, unless I err, mentally, how would it be if you renounced the prospect of growing older on this spot—in short, what if you were to pack to-night, and be up and away with the first suitable train?”","“My good engineer,” Settembrini said, angrily admonishing him, “pull yourself together and leave me out of such depraved nonsense. I don’t know what you’re talking about, and I don’t want to know. In your twenty-fourth year, you say? Hmm . . . please permit me one more question, or if you will, a modest suggestion. Since your stay here appears not to be good for you—neither physically nor, if I am not mistaken, mentally—how would it be, if you were to forgo the pleasure of growing older here, in short, if you were to pack your things tonight and be on your way with one of the scheduled express trains tomorrow morning?”"
"»Erstaunlich. Gewiß, ich gestehe meine Erschütterung, ich hätte das nicht erwartet. Roma locuta. Und wie, – und wie hat es gesprochen! Vor unseren Augen hat er ein hieratisches Saltomortale vollführt, – wenn das ein Widerspruch im Beiwort ist, so hat er ihn ›zeitweilig aufgehoben‹, ah, ja! Ich wiederhole: es ist erstaunlich. Halten Sie Einwendungen für denkbar, Professor, – Einwendungen lediglich vom Standpunkt der Konsequenz? Sie bemühten sich vorhin, uns einen christlichen, auf der Zweiheit von Gott und Welt beruhenden Individualismus begreiflich zu machen und uns seinen Vorrang vor aller politisch bestimmten Sittlichkeit zu beweisen. Wenige Minuten später treiben Sie den Sozialismus bis zur Diktatur und zum Schrecken. Wie reimt sich das?«","""Astonishing. Of course, I admit my shock, I didn't expect it. Roma locuta. And how - and how it spoke! Before our eyes he performed a hieratic somersault--if that be a contradiction in the epithet, he 'suspended' it, ah, yes! I repeat: it's amazing. Do you consider objections to be conceivable, Professor—objections merely from the point of view of consequence? You tried earlier to make us understand a Christian individualism based on the duality of God and world and to show us its priority over all politically determined morality. A few minutes later you push socialism to the point of dictatorship and terror. How does that rhyme?'","I am staggered—I admit it. I had not expected this. Roma locuta. Rome has spoken, and how—how has she spoken! Herr Naphta has before our eyes performed a hieratic salto mortale— if the epithet is inconsistent, the inconsistency has been ‘temporarily abrogated’—oh, yes! I repeat, it is astounding. Could you conceive, Professor, of any possible criticism, if only on the score of consistency? A few minutes ago you were at pains to make comprehensible to us a Christian individualism based on the dualism of God and the world, and to prove its pre-eminence over all politically determined morality. And now you profess a socialism pushed to the point of dictatorship and terrorism. How do you reconcile the two things?”","“Amazing,” he said. “I certainly must admit my shock—I had not expected this. Roma locuta. And what a speech! With our very own eyes, we have witnessed a hieratic death-defying leap—and if that is a contradiction in terms, then Herr Naphta has ‘temporarily abrogated’ it. Ah, yes. I repeat, it is amazing. Can you even conceive that there might be any objections, professor—even objections based purely on consistency? You attempted a while ago to help us understand a Christian individualism founded in the dualism between God and the world, and tried to prove its preeminence over all politically determined morality. A few minutes later you are advocating a socialism that ends in dictatorship and terror. How do you reconcile the two?”"
"»Jetzt«, sagte Settembrini, der öfters hier gewesen war, »läßt es sich schüchtern an. Aber an Ort und Stelle ist es brutal um diese Jahreszeit, – machen Sie sich gefaßt, wir werden unser eigen Wort nicht verstehen.«","'Now,' said Settembrini, who had been here often, 'let's start timidly. But it's brutal on the spot at this time of year - brace yourself, we shall not understand our own word.'","“It is mild enough now,” Settembrini said. He had often been here before. “But when you come close, it is brutal, at this time of the year. You won’t be able to hear yourselves think—mark my words.”","“It sounds timid enough now,” Settembrini said, who had been here several times. “But once you’re there, it is brutal at this time of year. Just be prepared—you won’t be able to hear yourself think.”"
Naphta erwiderte mit unangenehmer Ruhe:,Naphta replied with uneasy calm:,"Naphta responded, with disagreeable composure: “My good sir, there is no such thing as pure knowledge.","“My good friend,” Naphta replied with sour composure, “there is no such thing as pure knowledge."
"In der Mischung aus Revolution und Dunkelmännertum, die Naphta da seinen Zuhörern kredenzte, antwortete ihm Herr Settembrini, überwiege der obskurantistische Beisatz in unschmackhafter Weise. Das Gefallen, das seine Sorge um die Aufklärung des Volkes erwecke, leide einige Einbuße durch die Befürchtung, daß hier vielmehr eine Instinktneigung obwalte, Volk und Welt in analphabetische Finsternis zu hüllen.","In the mixture of revolution and obscurantism that Naphta proffered to his listeners, Herr Settembrini replied that the obscurantist adjuncts were unpalatable. The pleasure that his concern for the enlightenment of the people arouses suffers some loss through the fear that there is rather an instinctive tendency to envelop the people and the world in illiterate darkness.","Herr Settembrini said that Naphta had served up to their audience a mixture of revolution and obscurantism, in which, however, the obscurantist element outweighed the other, to an unsavoury extent. Herr Settembrini was pleased to see his concern for the enlightenment of the people, but his pleasure was marred by the fear that what really actuated Herr Naphta was an instinctive tendency to involve both people and world in analphabetic darkness.","In the mixture of revolution and conspiracy that Naphta had served up to his hearers, Herr Settembrini responded, the obscurantist element had predominated in a most unsavory fashion. Although one found pleasure in Naphta’s concern for the enlightenment of the common people, that pleasure was diminished somewhat by the fear that what prevailed here was an instinctual tendency to shroud the commonfolk and the world in illiterate darkness."
"Kein Mann war hier, der Vorwitzigen auf einem Hörnchen Gefahr geblasen hätte, es sei denn, Herr Settembrini wäre dieser Mann gewesen, als er dem entschwindenden Hans Castorp durch die hohlen Hände zugerufen hatte. Dieser aber hatte Mut und Sympathie, er achtete des Zurufs in seinem Rücken nicht mehr, als er dessen geachtet hatte, der bei gewissen Schritten einst in der Faschingsnacht hinter ihm drein geklungen war. »Eh, Ingegnere, un po’ di ragione, sa!« Ach ja, du pädagogischer Satana mit deiner ragione und ribellione, dachte er. Übrigens habe ich dich gern. Du bist zwar ein Windbeutel und Drehorgelmann, aber du meinst es gut, meinst es besser und bist mir lieber als der scharfe kleine Jesuit und Terrorist, der spanische Folter- und Prügelknecht mit seiner Blitzbrille, obgleich er fast immer recht hat, wenn ihr euch zankt … euch pädagogisch um meine arme Seele rauft, wie Gott und Teufel um den Menschen im Mittelalter …","There wasn't a man here who would have warned cheeky ones on a croissant, unless that man had been Herr Settembrini when he called through his cupped hands to the disappearing Hans Castorp. But he had courage and sympathy, he paid no more heed to the call behind him than he had heeded the one that had rung behind him at certain steps on the carnival night. ""Eh, Ingegnere, un po' di ragione, sa!"" Ah yes, you pedagogical Satana with your ragione and ribellione, he thought. By the way, I like you. You may be a windbag and organ grinder, but you mean well, you mean well, and I prefer you to that hot little Jesuit terrorist, the Spanish torturer and whipper with his flash glasses, although he's almost always right when you two squabble ... pedagogically fights for my poor soul, like god and devil for people in the Middle Ages ...","No one was here to blow a warning to the rash one—unless, indeed, Herr Settembrini, with his farewell shout at Hans Castorp’s disappearing back, had been that man. But possessed by valorous desire, our youth had given the call no heed—as little as he had the steps behind him on a certain carnival night. “Eh, Ingegnere, un po’ di ragione, sa!” “ Yes, yes, pedagogic Satana, with your ragione and your ribellione” he thought. “But I’m rather fond of you. You are a wind-bag and a handorgan man, to be sure. But you mean well, you mean much better, and more to my mind, than that knife-edged little Jesuit and Terrorist, apologist of the Inquisition and the knout, with his round eye-glasses—though he is nearly always right when you and he come to grips over my paltry soul, like God and the Devil in the mediæval legends.”","There was no one here, no meddlesome fellow tooting danger on his little horn, unless it might have been Herr Settembrini, who had called out through his cupped hands to Hans Castorp as he vanished. But filled with courage and sympathy, he had paid no more attention to that call at his back than he had to the words that rang out behind him as he took certain steps on the evening of Mardi Gras: “Eh, ingegnere, un po’ di ragione, sa!” “Ah, my pedagogic Satana, with your ragione and ribellione,” he thought, “I like you. True, you’re a windbag and organ-grinder, but you mean well, mean better than that caustic little Jesuit and terrorist, that Spanish torturer and flogger with his flashing glasses. And I like you better, too, although he’s almost always right when you two argue and scuffle pedagogically for my poor soul, like God and the Devil struggling over a man in the Middle Ages.”"
"»Gut, ein Naturspiel«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Aber doch nicht nur ein Naturspiel, nicht nur Fopperei. Denn da diese Leute Schauspieler sind, müssen sie ja Talent haben, und das Talent ist selbst über Dummheit und Gescheitheit hinaus, es ist selbst ein Lebenswert. Mynheer Peeperkorn hat auch Talent, sagen Sie, was Sie wollen, und damit steckt er uns in die Tasche. Setzen Sie in eine Ecke eines Zimmers Herrn Naphta und lassen Sie ihn einen Vortrag über Gregor den Großen und den Gottesstaat halten, höchst hörenswert, – und in der andern Ecke steht Peeperkorn mit seinem sonderbaren Mund und seinen hochgezogenen Stirnfalten und sagt nichts als ›Durchaus! Erlauben Sie mir – Erledigt!‹ – Sie werden sehen, die Leute werden sich um Peeperkorn versammeln, alle um ihn, und Naphta wird ganz allein dasitzen mit seiner Gescheitheit und seinem Gottesstaat, obgleich er sich dermaßen deutlich ausdrückt, daß es einem durch Mark und Pfennig geht, wie Behrens zu sagen pflegt …«","""Okay, a game of nature,"" said Hans Castorp. “But not just a game of nature, not just fooling around. Because these people are actors, they must have talent, and talent itself is beyond stupidity and cleverness, it is itself a value in life. Mynheer Peeperkorn's got talent too, say what you want and he'll pocket us. Put Mr. Naphta in a corner of a room and have him lecture on Gregory the Great and the City of God, well worth listening to--and in the other corner Peeperkorn stands with his queer mouth and raised brow and says nothing but 'Quite! Allow me — Done!‹ — You'll see, people will gather around Peeperkorn, all around him, and Naphta will sit there all alone with his brains and his theocracy, though he puts it so plainly that it's marrow and Pfennig goes, as Behrens likes to say...""","“Very good, a freak of nature,” said Hans Castorp. “But not alone a freak of nature, not simply a hoax. For since these people are actors, they must have a gift, and the gift itself is beyond cleverness and stupidity , it is after all a value. Mynheer Peeperkom has a gift, say what you like; and thus it is he can stick us all in his pocket. Put Herr Naphta in one corner of the room, and let him deliver a discourse on Gregory the Great and the City of God —it would be highly worth listening to—and put Mynheer Peeperkorn in the other, with his extraordinary mouth and the wrinkles on his forehead, and let him not say a word except ‘By all means—capital—settled, ladies and gentlemen!’ You will see everybody gather round Peeperkorn, and Herr Naphta will be sitting there alone with his cleverness and his City of God, though he may be uttering such penetrating wisdom that it pierces through marrow and cucumber, as Behrens says—”","“Fine, a freak of nature,” Hans Castorp said. “And yet not just a freak, not just something to taunt us. For people to be actors, they must have talent, and talent is something that goes beyond stupidity and cleverness, it is itself a value for life. Mynheer Peeperkorn has talent, too, no matter what you may say, and he uses it to put us in his pocket. Set Herr Naphta in the corner of a room and have him deliver a lecture on Gregory the Great and the City of God, something well worth listening to—and in the other corner have Peeperkorn stand there with his strange mouth and a brow raised in great creases and say nothing except, ‘By all means! Permit me to say—settled!’ And you will see people gather around Peeperkorn, down to the last man, and Naphta will be left sitting there alone with his cleverness and his City of God, although he can express himself so clearly that it makes your blood and spit run cold, to use one of Behrens’s phrases.”"
Er antwortete:,He answered:,"He replied: “No, I bade him adieu up here, before they shut him away, when he had begun to smile in his beard.","“No,” he replied, “I said my good-byes to him here before they closed the casket—he was starting to smile."

"Das nordische Kind befand sich bereits in des Doktors Obhut, als Hans Castorp die mit der Visitenkarte geschmückte Tür durchschritt. An Krokowskis Seite, der, bekleidet mit seinem schwarzen Arbeitskittel, in väterlichem Sinne den Arm um ihre Schulter geschlungen hielt, erwartete sie am Fuße der Stufen, die noch von der Ebene des Souterrains in die Wohnung des Assistenten hinabführten, die Gäste und begrüßte sie mit ihm. Allerseits war diese Begrüßung von aufgeräumt-unbedenklicher Herzlichkeit getragen. Es schien Absicht, die Stimmung von jeder feierlichen Beengung frei zu halten. Laut und scherzhaft sprach man durcheinander, tauschte aufmunternde Rippenstöße und bekundete auf alle Weise seine Unbefangenheit. In Dr. Krokowskis Barte zeigten sich beständig mit jenem kernigen und zum Vertrauen auffordernden Ausdruck seine gelben Zähne, während er sein »Ich gdieße Sie!« wiederholte, und besonders taten sie das, als er Hans Castorp willkommen hieß, der schweigsam war, und dessen Miene schwankte. »Mut, mein Freund!« schien die auf- und rückwärts schüttelnde Kopfbewegung des Wirtes zu sagen, während er dem jungen Mann fast derb die Hand drückte. »Wer wird die Ohren hängen lassen? Hier gibt es nicht Duckmäusertum noch Frömmelei, sondern einzig die männliche Heiterkeit vorurteilsloser Forschung!« Dem pantomimisch so Angeredeten wurde nicht wohler davon. Wir ließen ihn sich bei seinen Vorsätzen des Durchleuchtungslaboratoriums erinnern, doch diese Ideenverbindung reicht keineswegs hin, um den Zustand seines Gemüts zu kennzeichnen. Vielmehr gemahnte dieser ihn selbst sehr lebhaft an die eigentümlich und unvergeßlich aus Übermut und Nervosität, Wißbegier, Verachtung und Andacht gemischte Verfassung, worin er sich vor Jahren befunden, als er sich, etwas {1018}bekneipt, mit Kameraden zum erstenmal angeschickt hatte, ein Mädchenhaus in Sankt Pauli zu besuchen.","The Nordic child was already in the doctor's care when Hans Castorp walked through the door decorated with the business card. At Krokowski's side, who, dressed in his black overalls, had his arm around her shoulders in a fatherly manner, she awaited the guests at the foot of the steps that led down from the basement level to the assistant's apartment and greeted them as well him. On all sides, this greeting was carried by tidy and unhesitating cordiality. The intention seemed to be to keep the mood free of any solemn constriction. They talked loudly and jokingly, exchanged encouraging nudges in the ribs and proclaimed their impartiality in every way. in dr Krokowski's beard constantly showed his yellow teeth in that pithy and confidence-inspiring expression as he repeated his 'I kiss you!' ""Courage, my friend!"" seemed to say the innkeeper's head shaking up and down as he squeezed the young man's hand almost roughly. 'Who's going to hang their ears? There is no cowardice or bigotry here, only the male cheerfulness of unprejudiced research!' We made him remember his intentions at the fluoroscopy laboratory, but this association of ideas is by no means sufficient to characterize his state of mind. On the contrary, the latter reminded him very vividly of the peculiar and unforgettable mixed state of high spirits and nervousness, thirst for knowledge, contempt and devotion in which he found himself years ago when, a bit drunk, he and his comrades had set out for the first time Visiting the girls' home in Sankt Pauli.","That child of the north was already in the doctor’s charge when Hans Castorp passed through the door with the visiting-card: the doctor, in his black tunic, his arm laid fatherly across her shoulder, stood at the foot of the stair leading from the basement floor and welcomed the guests, and she with him. Everybody greeted everybody else, with surprising hilarity and expansiveness—it seemed to be the common aim to keep the meeting pitched in a key free from all solemnity or constraint. They talked in loud, cheery voices, poked each other in the ribs, showed everyway how perfectly at ease they felt. Dr. Krokowski’s yellow teeth kept gleaming in his beard with every hearty, confidence-inviting smile; he repeated his “Wel— come” to each arrival, with special fervour in Hans Castorp’s case—who, for his part, said nothing at all, and whose manner was hesitating. “Courage, comrade,” Krokowski’s energetic and hospitable nod seemed to be saying, as he gave the young man’s hand an almost violent squeeze. No need here to hang the head, here is no cant nor sanctimoniousness, nothing but the blithe and manly spirit of disinterested research. But Hans Castorp felt none the better for all this pantomime. He summed up the resolve formed by the memories of the x-ray cabinet; but the train of thought hardly fitted with his present frame; rather he was reminded of the peculiar and unforgettable mixture of feelings—nervousness, pridefulness, curiosity, disgust, and awe—with which, years ago, he had gone with some fellow students, a little tipsy, to a brothel in Sankt-Pauli.","As Hans Castorp passed through the door with the calling card tacked decoratively to it, he found the Nordic child already under the doctor’s wing. Dressed in his black clinical smock, Krokowski was right beside her, one arm paternally flung over her shoulders; she stood waiting at the foot of the two steps that led from the basement down into the assistant’s apartments, and the two of them together greeted arriving guests. These greetings were characterized by unhesitating, expansive cheerfulness on all sides. The intent, it appeared, was to keep the mood free of any constraining solemnity. They all talked at once in loud, jocular voices, gave one another encouraging pokes in the ribs, and made a point of showing just how at ease they were. Beneath Dr. Krokowski’s beard, under that pithy expression that reassured and enjoined confidence, his yellow teeth were constantly in evidence as he repeated his “my d’gods” and were particularly visible as he welcomed Hans Castorp, who said nothing and looked unsure of himself. “Courage, my friend,” his host seemed to say, tossing his head back with a little shake and pumping the young man’s hand almost roughly, “why should anyone look down-in-the-mouth? No cant, no sticky-sweet piety here, just the manly cheerfulness of unbiased research!” But this pantomimed greeting did not make Hans Castorp feel any better. We noted that in coming to this decision, he had recalled his experience in the X-ray laboratory, and yet that association by no means suffices to describe his state of mind. Rather, it all evoked in’ him very lively memories of a unique and unforgettable hodgepodge of emotions—nervousness, playfulness, curiosity, disgust, and awe—that he had felt years before when, a little tipsy, he joined some pals and set out for the first time to visit a brothel in Sankt Pauli."

"»Das ist Fett!« sagte endgültig der Hofrat, der einen Wandschrank aufgeschlossen und ihm das Zubehör zur Kaffeebereitung entnommen hatte, eine röhrenförmige türkische Mühle, den langgestielten Kochbecher, das Doppelgefäß für Zucker und gemahlenen Kaffee, alles aus Messing. »Palmitin, Stearin, Oleïn«, sagte er und schüttete Kaffeebohnen aus einer Blechbüchse in die Mühle, deren Kurbel er zu drehen begann. »Die Herren sehen, ich mache alles selbst, von Anfang an, es schmeckt noch mal so gut. – Was dachten Sie denn? Daß es Ambrosia wäre?«","""That's fat!"" said finally the Councilor, who had unlocked a closet and taken the accessories for making coffee, a tubular Turkish grinder, the long-handled cooking mug, the double container for sugar and ground coffee, all made of brass. ""Palmitine, stearine, oleïn,"" he said, and poured coffee beans from a tin can into the grinder, whose crank he began to turn. “Gentlemen see, I do everything myself, right from the start, it tastes twice as good. - What did you think? That it was ragweed?”","He had opened a hanging cabinet, and taken thence the requisites for his coffee-making: a cylindrical Turkish mill, a long-handled pot, a double receptacle for sugar and ground coffee, all in brass. “Palmitin, stearin, olein,“ he went on, shaking the coffee berries from a tin box into the mill, which he began to turn. “You see I make it all myself, it tastes twice as good.—Did you think it was ambrosia?”","“It’s fat,” the director said with finality as he closed a cupboard from which he had extracted the utensils for brewing coffee: a cylindrical Turkish mill, a long-handled pot, a divided bowl for sugar and ground coffee—all of brass. “Palmitin, stearin, olein,” he said, shaking coffee beans from a tin box into the mill as he began to turn the crank. “As you gentlemen can see, I make it all myself, from scratch. It tastes twice as good. . . . What did you think it was? Ambrosia, perhaps?”"
"Selbst dieses letzte Wort, so viele Hindernisse es seiner mediterranen Zunge bieten mochte, hatte Herr Settembrini auf erfreuliche Art, klar, wohllautend und – man kann wohl sagen – plastisch zu Gehör gebracht. Hans Castorp antwortete nicht anders, als mit der kurzen, steifen und befangenen Verbeugung eines Schülers, der eine verweisartige Belehrung entgegennimmt. Was hätte er erwidern sollen? Dies Privatissimum, das Herr Settembrini ihm insgeheim, mit dem Rücken gegen die ganze übrige Gästeschaft und beinahe flüsternd, gehalten, hatte zu sachlichen, zu ungesellschaftlichen, zu wenig gesprächsmäßigen Charakter getragen, als daß der Takt erlaubt hätte, auch nur Beifall zu äußern. Man antwortet einem Lehrer nicht: {370}»Das haben Sie schön gesagt.« Hans Castorp hatte es wohl früher manchmal getan, gewissermaßen um das gesellschaftliche Gleichheitsverhältnis zu wahren; allein so dringlich erzieherisch hatte der Humanist noch niemals gesprochen; es blieb nichts übrig, als die Vermahnung einzustecken, – benommen wie ein Schuljunge von soviel Moral.","Even this last word, no matter how many obstacles it presented to his Mediterranean tongue, Mr. Settembrini had delivered in a pleasant way, clearly, euphoniously and - one might say - vividly. Hans Castorp answered no other than with the short, stiff and embarrassed bow of a student who receives a reprimand-like instruction. What should he have said? This privacy, which M. Settembrini kept for him in secret, with his back against the rest of the guests and almost in a whisper, was too matter-of-fact, too unsociable, too little conversational in character for the tact to have even allowed him to express applause. One does not answer a teacher: {370} ""You said that beautifully."" Hans Castorp had probably sometimes done it in the past, to a certain extent in order to preserve social equality; but the humanist had never before spoken in such an urgently pedagogical manner; there was nothing left but to pocket the admonition, - dazed like a schoolboy of so much morals.","Whatever difficulty, if any, his phrases offered Herr Setternbrini’s Mediterranean palate, he brought them out with a clarity, a euphony, one might almost say a plasticity, that was truly refreshing. Hans Castorp made no answer save the short, stiff, embarrassed bow of a pupil receiving a reprimand. What could he have said? Herr Settembrini had delivered a private lecture, almost whispered it into his ear, with his back to the rest of the people in the room; it had been so pointed, so unsocial, so little conversable in its nature, that merely to commend its eloquence seemed lacking in tact. One does not tell a schoolmaster that he has expressed himself well. Hans Castorp, indeed, had done so once or twice in the early days of their acquaintance, probably from an instinct to preserve the social equilibrium; but the humanist’s utterances had never before reached quite such a didactic pitch. There was nothing for it but to pocket the admonition, feeling as embarrassed as a schoolboy at so much moralizing.","Whatever difficulties certain phrases presented to Herr Settembrini’s Mediterranean tongue, he had expressed himself in the most delightful fashion—clearly, euphoniously, and, one may well say, graphically. Hans Castorp could only respond with the brief, stiff, and uneasy bow of a schoolboy on the receiving end of a critical lecture. What could he possibly have replied? This private homily, which Herr Settembrini had delivered surreptitiously, almost in a whisper, behind the backs of the other guests, had been too businesslike, too unsocial, too little like conversation, for him to have expressed approval in any tactful way. One does not respond to a teacher with: “You said that beautifully.” Hans Castorp had indeed done that on several previous occasions, if only to preserve some kind of social equality—but the humanist had never before spoken with such pedagogic urgency. There was nothing for him to do but swallow this scolding—like a schoolboy dazed by too much moralizing."
"Peeperkorn wollte ihr Versagen auf mangelhafte Nahrungszufuhr zurückführen. In bedeutend abreißenden Worten, mit erhobenem Zeigefinger, ließ er sich in diesem Sinne aus. Man müsse essen, ordentlich essen, um den Anforderungen gerecht werden zu können, so gab er zu verstehen, und bestellte Stärkung für die Runde, eine Kollation, Fleisch, Aufschnitt, Zunge, {851}Gänsebrust, Braten, Wurst und Schinken, – Platten voll fetter Leckerbissen, die, mit Butterkugeln, Radieschen und Petersilie garniert, prangenden Blumenbeeten glichen. Aber obgleich sie, eines vorangegangenen Abendessens ungeachtet, über dessen Gediegenheit kein Wort verloren zu werden braucht, frohen Zuspruch fanden, erklärte Mynheer Peeperkorn sie nach wenigen Bissen für »Firlefanz« – und zwar mit einem Zorn, der die beängstigende Unberechenbarkeit seiner Herrschernatur bekundete. Ja, er wurde kollerig, als jemand den Imbiß in Schutz zu nehmen wagte; sein mächtiges Haupt schwoll an, und er schlug mit der Faust auf den Tisch, indem er das alles für verdammten Quark erklärte, – worauf man denn betreten verstummte, da er am Ende als Spender und Wirt das Recht hatte, seine Gaben zu beurteilen.","Peeperkorn wanted to attribute their failure to a lack of food. In this sense, he expressed himself in eloquent words, with a raised forefinger. One must eat, eat properly, in order to be able to meet the requirements, he made it clear, and ordered refreshments for the round, a collation, meat, cold cuts, tongue, {851}goose breast, roast meat, sausage and ham - platters full of fat tidbits that, garnished with butter balls, radishes and parsley, resembled lavish flowerbeds. But though they were happily received, notwithstanding a previous supper, the goodness of which need not be squandered, Mynheer Peeperkorn, after a few bites, declared them ""frills"" - with an anger that betrayed the frightening unpredictability of his rulership. Yes, he got queasy when someone dared defend the diner; his mighty head swelled, and he banged his fist on the table, declaring it all damn quark - whereupon there was an embarrassed silence, since in the end as donor and host he had the right to judge his gifts.","Peeperkorn put down her plight to lack of nourishment. He expressed himself in this sense, with impressive disjointedness, forefinger aloft. People must nourish themselves properly, he gave them to understand, in order to do justice to life’s manifold claims. And he ordered sustenance for the company: platters of cold meat, joint and roast; tongue, goose, ham, sausage, whole dishes of délectables, all garnished with little radishes, butter-balls, and parsley, gay as flower-beds. They found a welcome, despite the lately consumed supper, which, it were superfluous to tell the reader, had lacked nothing in heartiness. But Mynheer Peeperkorn, after a few bites, dismissed the whole as “kickshaws”—dismissed them with a scorn which gave dismaying evidence of the uncertain temper of this lordly man. Yes, he waxed choleric, turned upon one of the company who tried to defend the collation. He swelled with rage, struck the table with his fist, and cursed the food for garbage, fit for the dust-bin. This reduced the offender to silence, for certainly Peeperkorn, as host and dispenser of the good cheer, might find fault with its quality if he chose.","Peeperkorn claimed her trouble was the result of insufficient nourishment. Raising one forefinger, he enlarged upon his theme in imposing, broken phrases. One must eat, eat properly, in order to give life’s demands their due, he informed them, and then ordered refreshments for everyone: a selection of meats and cold cuts, tongue, goose breast, and roast beef, sausages and ham—plates piled with delicacies and garnished with little balls of butter, radishes, and parsley until they resembled showy flowerbeds. But though they all helped themselves lustily to this repast (despite an ample supper, whose substantiality need not be described further), Mynheer Peeperkorn took only a few bites before declaring it to be “gimcrackery”—with a fury that betrayed the frightening unpredictability of such a masterful nature. And when someone tried to come to the defense of the fare, he exploded: his massive head swelled, he banged his fist on the table and pronounced it all a lot of damn garbage, reducing everyone to embarrassed silence, since he had paid for it and, as their host, could say what he pleased about his largesse."
"Settembrini sah ihn mit traurig schimmernden schwarzen Augen an. »Ingenieur,« sagte er gepreßt, »Ingenieur!« Und er nahm Hans Castorp am Arm und hielt ihn ein wenig zurück, gleichsam um hinter dem Rücken der anderen privatim auf ihn einzureden.","Settembrini looked at him with sadly shimmering black eyes. ""Engineer,"" he said tightly, ""Engineer!"" And he took Hans Castorp by the arm and held him back a little, as if to talk to him privately behind the backs of the others.","Settembrini looked at him, a melancholy gleam in his dark eye. “Engineer!” he said, restrainingly. He took Hans Castorp’s arm and drew him a little aside, as though to speak to him in private","Settembrini gazed at him with mournful, flashing black eyes. “My good engineer,” he said in a choked voice, “my good engineer. “ And he grabbed Hans Castorp by the arm and pulled him back a little from the others, as if he had some private advice to give him behind their backs."

Aber wenn ich von meinen persönlichen Neigungen mal absehe – und vielleicht brauch’ ich, genau genommen, gar nicht so ganz davon abzusehen –, so habe ich eine Menge Verständnis und Neigung für den militärischen Stand. Es hat ja eine verteufelt ernsthafte Bewandtnis damit, eine ›asketische‹, wenn Sie wollen – Sie waren vorhin so freundlich, den Ausdruck irgendwie zu gebrauchen –, und immer muß er damit rechnen, es mit dem Tode zu tun zu bekommen, – mit dem ja letzten Endes auch der geistliche Stand es zu tun hat, – womit denn sonst. Daher hat der Soldatenstand die bienséance und die Rangordnung und den Gehorsam und die spanische Ehre, wenn ich so sagen darf, und es ist ziemlich gleich, ob einer einen steifen Uniformkragen trägt oder eine gestärkte Halskrause, es kommt auf dasselbe hinaus, auf das ›Asketische‹, wie Sie vorhin so hervorragend sich ausdrückten … Ich weiß nicht, ob es mir gelingt, Ihnen meinen Gedankengang …«","{571}""So you must like my cousin's job, Mr. Naphta, and agree with his impatience to take it up...

But if I disregard my personal inclinations - and perhaps, strictly speaking, I don't need to disregard them entirely - I have a great deal of understanding and inclination for the military class 'Ascetic', if you like - you were kind enough to use the term in some way just now - and he always has to reckon with having to deal with death - with which, after all, the clergy also have to deal has, - with what else. Therefore, the military rank has the bienséance and the order of precedence and the obedience and the Spanish honor, if I may say so, and it makes little difference whether one wears a stiff uniform collar or a starched ruff, it depends the same thing, to the 'ascetic', as you put it so brilliantly just now...

As for me I am an out-and-out civilian, my cousin often reproaches me with it. I have never seen service; I am a child of peace, pure and simple, and have even sometimes thought of becoming a clergyman—ask my cousin if I haven’t said as much to him many a time! But for all that, and aside from my personal inclinations— or even, perhaps, not altogether aside from them—I have some understanding and sympathy for a military life. It has such an infernally serious side to it, sort of ascetic, as you say—that was the expression you used, wasn’t it? The military always has to reckon on coming to grip with death, just as the clergy has. That is why there is so much discipline and decorum and regularity in the army, so much ‘Spanish etiquette,’ if I may say so; and it makes no great difference whether one wears a uniform collar or a starched ruff, the main thing is the asceticism, as you so beautifully said.—I don’t know if I’ve succeeded in making my train of thought quite—”","“You must look favorably, then, on my cousin’s profession, Herr Naphta, and sympathize with his impatience to take it up.

That is where soldiers get their bienséance, and their idea of rank and obedience to authority and Spanish sense of honor, if I may put it that way.

"So empfanden dunkel alle, und wiewohl es sich hier um keine ernste und praktische Rückkehr ins Leben, sondern um eine rein sentimentale und theatralische Veranstaltung handelte, bei der man den Ausgeschiedenen eben nur sehen sollte, der Fall also lebensunbedenklich war, so fürchteten sie sich doch vor dem Angesichte dessen, an den sie dachten, und jeder hätte das Recht, einen Wunsch zu äußern, lieber dem Nächsten zugeschoben. Auch Hans Castorp, obgleich er das gutmütig {1025}liberale »Bitte – bitte!« aus der Nacht vernahm, hielt sich zurück und war im letzten Augenblick ziemlich bereit, einem anderen den Vortritt zu lassen. Da es ihm aber zu lange dauerte, so sagte er denn, den Kopf gegen den Sitzungsleiter gewandt, mit belegter Stimme:","Everyone felt that way, and although this was not a serious and practical return to life, but a purely sentimental and theatrical event, at which one was only supposed to see the departed, so the case was not life-threatening, they were still afraid before the face of him of whom they thought, and everyone would have preferred to shift the right to express a wish to his neighbor. Even Hans Castorp, although he heard the good-natured {1025}liberal ""Please - please!"" from the night, held back and was quite ready at the last moment to let someone else go first. But since it was taking too long for him, he turned his head towards the leader of the session and said in a hoarse voice:","This was what they were all obscurely feeling; and since it was here simply a question not of an actual return, but merely a theatrical staging of one, in which they should only see the departed, no more, the thing seemed humanly unthinkable; they were afraid to look into the face of him or her of whom they thought, and each one would willingly have resigned his right of choice to the next. Hans Castorp too, though there was echoing in his ears that large-hearted “Of course, of course” out of the past, held back, and at the last moment was rather inclined to pass the choice on. But the pause was too long; he turned his head toward their leader, and said, in a husky voice: “I should like to see my departed cousin, Joachim Ziemssen.”","They were all vaguely aware of this, and although they were not dealing here with a serious and authentic return to life, but a purely sentimental and theatrical performance, during which one would only see the departed person—nothing life-threatening, really —they nevertheless feared being confronted by whomever they had thought about, and each would have preferred to pass on to his neighbor the privilege of expressing such a wish. Even Hans Castorp, despite his having once heard that kind, generous “Oh, please, go ahead and look” emerge from the night, held back and at the last moment was quite prepared to let someone else go first. But it all seemed to be taking too long, and so turning his head to address the leader of the session, he said with a husky voice, “I would like to see my dead cousin, Joachim Ziemssen.”"

"»Ach«, sagte Joachim und lachte wegwerfend. »Nicht aus dem Bauche, Unsinn. Das war die Kleefeld, Hermine Kleefeld, die pfeift mit dem Pneumothorax.«","""Oh,"" said Joachim and laughed dismissively. “Not from the gut, nonsense.

That was Hermine Kleefeld, she whistles with her pneumothorax.” “With her what?”","“Oh,” Joachim said, laughing dismissively. “Not from her stomach, what nonsense.

"Unterwegs einigte er sich mit Joachim dahin, daß man in Sachen seiner Erkältung und Halsbeschwerden den Dienstweg einschlagen, das heißt also, den Bademeister anstellen wolle, die Oberin zu benachrichtigen, worauf denn für den Leidenden doch wohl etwas geschehen werde. So war es wohlgetan. Noch am Abend, gleich nach dem Diner, klopfte Adriatica bei Joachim, als Hans Castorp gerade bei ihm im Zimmer war, und erkundigte sich kreischend nach den Wünschen und Klagen des jungen Offiziers. »Halsschmerzen? Heiserkeit?« wiederholte sie. »Menschenskind, was machen Sie für Sprünge?« Und sie unternahm den Versuch, ihm durchdringend ins Auge zu blicken, wobei es nicht an Joachim lag, daß ein Ineinander-Ruhen ihrer Blicke mißlang: der ihre war es, der beiseite schweifte. Daß sie es immer wieder versuchte, wenn es ihr nun doch erfahrungsgemäß einmal nicht gegeben war, das Unternehmen durchzuführen! Mit Hilfe einer Art von metallenem Schuhlöffel, den sie aus ihrer Gürteltasche zog, sah sie dem Patienten in den Schlund, wobei Hans Castorp mit der Nachttischlampe leuchten mußte. Während sie, auf den Zehenspitzen stehend, um Joachims Zäpfchen herumspähte, sagte sie:","On the way he agreed with Joachim that in matters of his cold and sore throat they would go through official channels, that is, employ the lifeguard to notify the matron, after which something would probably be done for the sufferer. So it was well done. That evening, immediately after dinner, Adriatica knocked on Joachim's door when Hans Castorp was in his room, and shrieked and inquired about the young officer's wishes and complaints. ""Sore throat? Hoarseness?” she repeated. ""Good gracious, what are you doing?"" And she tried to look him straight in the eye, although it wasn't Joachim's fault that their eyes failed to lock: it was hers that wandered aside. That she tried again and again when experience had shown that she was unable to carry out the undertaking! With the help of a sort of metal shoehorn, which she pulled from her belt pouch, she looked down the patient's throat while Hans Castorp had to shine the bedside lamp on him. Standing on tiptoe, peering around Joachim's uvula, she said:","On the way home he and Joachim agreed that it was best to invoke the official channels in matters like colds and sore throats. In other words, they would ask the bathing-master to see the Oberin, in order that something might be done to relieve the sufferer. It was well done. That very evening, directly after dinner, Adriatica knocked at Joachim’s door, Hans Castorp being present, and asked what were the wishes of the young officer. “Sore throat? Hoarseness?” she repeated; “what sort of antics are these, young ‘un?” and undertook to pierce him with her eye. It was not Joachim’s fault that their glances failed to meet, hers swerved aside. Yet she would continue to try, though experience must have taught her it was not given her to succeed in the undertaking. With the help of a sort of metal shoehorn from her pocket, she looked at the patient’s tonsils, Hans Castorp standing by with the lamp. Rising on tiptoes to peer into Joachim’s throat, she asked: “Tell me, young ‘un, do you ever swallow the wrong way?”","On the way home, he got Joachim to agree that official channels should be opened to deal with his cold and sore throat—this meant asking the bath attendant to inform the head nurse, which would then result in something being done for his sufferings. And it proved the thing to do. That very evening, right after supper, Adriatica knocked on Joachim’s door—Hans Castorp happened to be in the room with him—and asked in her squawky voice what the young officer’s problems and wishes were. “Sore throat? Hoarseness?” she repeated. “Man alive, what sort of antics are these?” She attempted to fix him with a piercing stare, and it was not Joachim’s fault their eyes did not meet—hers were the ones that wandered off. Experience had taught her that she was not meant to execute the procedure, but she kept trying. With the aid of a sort of metal shoehorn that she pulled from the bag hanging from her belt, she looked down into the patient’s throat, asking Hans Castorp to provide light with the nightstand lamp. Standing on her tiptoes and gazing at Joachim’s uvula, she said, “Man alive, tell me—have you ever swallowed the wrong way?”"
"Das liegt auf der flachen Hand. Daß aber hier ein Unterschied waltet, liegt ebenso offen. Das Zeitelement der Musik ist nur eines: ein Ausschnitt menschlicher Erdenzeit, in den sie sich ergießt, um ihn unsagbar zu adeln und zu erhöhen. Die {817}Erzählung dagegen hat zweierlei Zeit: ihre eigene erstens, die musikalisch-reale, die ihren Ablauf, ihre Erscheinung bedingt; zweitens aber die ihres Inhalts, die perspektivisch ist, und zwar in so verschiedenem Maße, daß die imaginäre Zeit der Erzählung fast, ja völlig mit ihrer musikalischen zusammenfallen, sich aber auch sternenweit von ihr entfernen kann. Ein Musikstück des Namens »Fünf-Minuten-Walzer« dauert fünf Minuten, – hierin und in nichts anderem besteht sein Verhältnis zur Zeit. Eine Erzählung aber, deren inhaltliche Zeitspanne fünf Minuten betrüge, könnte ihrerseits, vermöge außerordentlicher Gewissenhaftigkeit in der Erfüllung dieser fünf Minuten, das Tausendfache dauern – und dabei sehr kurzweilig sein, obgleich sie im Verhältnis zu ihrer imaginären Zeit sehr langweilig wäre. Andererseits ist möglich, daß die inhaltliche Zeit der Erzählung deren eigene Dauer verkürzungsweise ins Ungemessene übersteigt, – wir sagen »verkürzungsweise«, um auf ein illusionäres oder, ganz deutlich zu sprechen, ein krankhaftes Element hinzudeuten, das hier offenbar einschlägig ist: sofern nämlich dieses Falls die Erzählung sich eines hermetischen Zaubers und einer zeitlichen Überperspektive bedient, die an gewisse anormale und deutlich ins Übersinnliche weisende Fälle der wirklichen Erfahrung erinnern. Man besitzt Aufzeichnungen von Opiumrauchern, die bekunden, daß der Betäubte während der kurzen Zeit seiner Entrückung Träume durchlebte, deren zeitlicher Umfang sich auf zehn, auf dreißig und selbst auf sechzig Jahre belief oder sogar die Grenze aller menschlichen Zeiterfahrungsmöglichkeit zurückließ, – Träume also, deren imaginärer Zeitraum ihre eigene Dauer um ein Gewaltiges überstieg, und in denen eine unglaubliche Verkürzung des Zeiterlebnisses herrschte, die Vorstellungen sich mit solcher Geschwindigkeit drängten, als wäre, wie ein Haschischesser sich ausdrückt, aus dem Hirn des Berauschten »etwas hinweggenommen gewesen wie die Feder einer verdorbenen Uhr«.","That's on the palm of your hand. But that there is a difference here is just as obvious. The time element of the music is only one thing: a section of human earthly time, into which it pours to unspeakably ennoble and exalt it. The {817}narrative, on the other hand, has two kinds of time: its own first, the musically real one, which determines its course, its appearance; secondly, however, that of its content, which is perspective, and indeed to such a different extent that the imaginary time of the narration almost, indeed completely, coincides with its musical time, but can also be as far away from it as possible. A piece of music called »Fünf-Minuten-Walzer« lasts five minutes – this and nothing else is its relationship to time. But a tale whose length of time is five minutes could, by virtue of extraordinary conscientiousness in fulfilling these five minutes, last a thousand times as long - and be very entertaining, although it would be very boring in relation to its imaginary time. On the other hand, it is possible that the substantive time of the narrative exceeds its own duration immeasurably - we say ""shortened"" to indicate an illusionary or, to put it quite clearly, a pathological element that is obviously relevant here: insofar as this If the narration employs a hermetic magic and an over-temporal perspective reminiscent of certain anomalous and clearly paranormal instances of real experience. There are records of opium smokers which state that during the brief period of his rapture the drugged man experienced dreams spanning ten years, thirty years and even sixty years or even exceeding the limit of all human possibility of experiencing time - dreams, then, whose imaginary period of time exceeded their own duration by an enormous amount, and in which an incredible shortening of the experience of time prevailed, the ideas pressed on with such speed as if, as a hashish eater puts it, ""something had been removed from the brain of the intoxicated like the pen of a spoiled watch«.","So much is clear. But it is just as clear that we have also a difference to deal with. For the time element in music is single. Into a section of mortal time music pours itself, thereby inexpressibly enhancing and ennobling what it fills. But a narrative must have two kinds of time: first, its own, like music, actual time, conditioning its presentation and course; and second, the time of its content, which is relative, so extremely relative that the imaginary time of the narrative can either coincide nearly or completely with the actual, or musical, time, or can be a world away. A piece of music called a “Five-minute Waltz” lasts five minutes, and this is its sole relation to the time element. But a narrative which concerned itself with the events of five minutes, might, by extraordinary conscientiousness in the telling, take up a thousand times five minutes, and even then seem very short, though long in relation to its imaginary time. On the other hand, the contentual time of a story can shrink its actual time out of all measure. We put it in this way on purpose, in order to suggest another element, an illusory, even, to speak plainly, a morbid element, which is quite definitely a factor in the situation. I am speaking of cases where the story practises a hermetical magic, a temporal distortion of perspective reminding one of certain abnormal and transcendental experiences in actual life. We have records of opium dreams in which the dreamer, during a brief narcotic sleep, had experiences stretching over a period of ten, thirty, sixty years, or even passing the extreme limit of man’s temporal capacity for experience: dreams whose contentual time was enormously greater than their actual or musical time, and in which there obtained an incredible foreshortening of events; the images pressing one upon another with such rapidity that it was as though “something had been taken away, like the spring from a broken watch “from the brain of the sleeper. Such is the description of a hashish eater.","That much is perfectly obvious. But that there is a difference is equally clear. The time element of music is singular: a segment of human earthly existence in which it gushes forth, thereby ineffably enhancing and ennobling life. Narrative, however, has two kinds of time: first, its own real time, which like musical time defines its movement and presentation; and second, the time of its contents, which has a perspective quality that can vary widely, from a story in which the narrative’s imaginary time is almost, or indeed totally coincident with its musical time, to one in which it stretches out over light-years. A musical piece entitled “Five Minute Waltz” lasts five minutes— this and only this defines its relationship to time. A story whose contents involved a time span of five minutes, however, could, by means of an extraordinary scrupulosity in filling up those five minutes, last a thousand times as long—and still remain short on boredom, although in relationship to its imaginary time it would be very long in the telling. On the other hand, it is possible for a narrative’s content-time to exceed its own duration immeasurably. This is accomplished by diminishment—and we use this term to describe an illusory, or, to be quite explicit, diseased element, that is obviously pertinent here: diminishment occurs to some extent whenever a narrative makes use of hermetic magic and a temporal hyperperspective reminiscent of certain anomalous experiences of reality that imply that the senses have been transcended. The diaries of opium-eaters record how, during the brief period of ecstasy, the drugged person’s dreams have a temporal scope of ten, thirty, sometimes sixty years or even surpass all limits of man’s ability to experience time—dreams, that is, whose imaginary time span vastly exceeds their actual duration and which are characterized by an incredible diminishment of the experience of time, with images thronging past so swiftly that, as one hashish-smoker puts it, the intoxicated user’s brain seems “to have had something removed, like the mainspring from a broken watch.”"
"»Aber ich versichere Sie, er kann oft ganz zusammenhängend sprechen, wenn er warm wird«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Er hat mir gelegentlich von dynamischen Drogen und asiatischen Giftbäumen erzählt, so interessant, daß es fast unheimlich war – das Interessante ist immer etwas unheimlich – und interessant war es wieder nicht so sehr an und für sich, als eigentlich nur im Zusammenhang mit seiner Persönlichkeitswirkung: die machte es zugleich unheimlich und interessant …«","""But I assure you, he can often speak coherently when he warms up,"" said Hans Castorp. 'Occasionally he told me about dynamic drugs and Asian poison trees, so interesting it was almost uncanny - the interesting is always a bit uncanny - and again it wasn't so much interesting in and of itself as really only in connection with his personality impact : she made it both scary and interesting at the same time...«","“But he can often talk as coherently as you please,” said Hans Castorp, “when he gets interested. The other day he was telling me about dynamic drugs and Asiatic poison-trees; it was so interesting it was almost uncanny—interesting things are always a bit uncanny—but the interest was not so much in what he was saying as it was taken in connexion with his personality, which made it interesting and uncanny at once.”","“But I assure you, he can speak coherently when he warms to his topic,” Hans Castorp said. “He once told me about dynamic drugs and poisonous Asian trees, and it was so interesting it was almost eerie—interesting things are always a little eerie—and yet it was interesting not in and of itself, but actually only in connection with the effect of his personality. That was what made it both eerie and interesting at the same time.”"
"Naphta bestätigte, daß Tugend und Gesundheit in der Tat kein religiöser Zustand seien. Es sei viel gewonnen, sagte er, wenn klargestellt sei, daß Religion mit Vernunft und Sittlichkeit überhaupt nichts zu tun habe. Denn, fügte er hinzu, sie habe nichts mit dem Leben zu tun. Das Leben ruhe auf Bedingungen und Grundlagen, die teils der Erkenntnislehre, teils dem moralischen Gebiet angehörten. Die ersteren hießen Zeit, Raum, Kausalität, die letzteren Sittlichkeit und Vernunft. All diese Dinge seien dem religiösen Wesen nicht nur fremd und gleichgültig, sondern sogar feindlich entgegengesetzt; denn sie seien es eben, die das Leben ausmachten, die sogenannte Gesundheit, das heiße: die Erzphilisterei und Urbürgerlichkeit, als deren absolutes, und zwar absolut geniales Gegenteil die religiöse Welt eben zu bestimmen sei. Übrigens wolle er, Naphta, der Lebenssphäre die Möglichkeit des Genies nicht völlig {697}absprechen. Es gebe eine Lebensbürgerlichkeit, deren monumentaler Biedersinn unbestreitbar sei, eine Philistermajestät, die man verehrungswürdig finden möge, sofern man festhalte, daß sie in ihrer breitbeinig aufgepflanzten Würde, Hände auf dem Rücken und Brust heraus, die inkarnierte Irreligiosität bedeute.","Naphta affirmed that virtue and health are indeed not a religious condition. Much would be gained, he said, if it were made clear that religion had absolutely nothing to do with reason and morality. Because, he added, it has nothing to do with life. Life rests on conditions and foundations that belong partly to epistemology and partly to the moral sphere. The former were called time, space, causality, the latter morality and reason. All these things are not only alien and indifferent to the religious being, but even hostile to it; because it is they that make up life, so-called health, that is, arch-philistinism and primitive bourgeoisie, of which the religious world is to be defined as the absolute, and indeed absolutely ingenious, opposite. Incidentally, he, Naphta, did not want to completely {697}deny the possibility of genius to the sphere of life. There is a bourgeois lifestyle whose monumental uprightness is indisputable, a philistine majesty that one might find worthy of worship, provided one holds that, with her feet spread apart, her hands on her back and her chest out, she signifies irreligiousness incarnate.","Naphta concurred. He said that being virtuous and healthy did not, in fact, constitute being in a state of religion at all. It would clear the air to have it plainly stated that religion had nothing to do with reason and morality. “For,” he added, “it has nothing to do with life. Life is based on conditions and built up on foundations which are partly the result of experience, and partly belong to the domain of ethics. We call the first kind time, space, and causality; the second, morality and reason. But one and all of these are not only foreign to, utterly a matter of indifference to the nature of religion; they are even hostile to it. For they are precisely what make up life—the so-called normal life, which is to say, arch Philistinism, ultra-bourgeoisiedom, the absolute antithesis of which, the very genius of antithesis to which, is the life of religion.” Naphta went on to say that he would not deny to the other sphere the possibility of genius. There was much to admire in the monumental respectability, the majestic Philistinism of the middle-class consciousness. But one must never forget that as it stood, straddle-legged, firmly planted on earth, hands behind the back, chest well out, it was the embodiment of irreligion.","Naphta agreed that virtue and health were not part of the religious condition. Much would be gained by making it clear that religion had absolutely nothing to do with reason and morality. For, he added, religion had nothing to do with life. Life was based on conditions and principles that belonged in part to epistemology and in part to ethics—the former being time, space, and causality; the latter, morality and reason. All such matters were not only foreign and of no significance to religion as such, but also inimical to it; for they were the constituents of life, or so-called health, which was to say, ultraphilistine, utter bourgeois existence—to which the religious world was ordained to be the absolute opposite, indeed the very genius of opposition. Not that he, Naphta, would want to deny the possibility of a certain genius in the sphere of life. There was a “bourgeoisiosity” of life, whose monumental genius was indisputable, a philistine majesty, which one might well consider worthy of respect, as long as one realized that as it stood there in all its dignity, legs astraddle, hands at its back, chest thrust forward, it was the incarnation of irreligiosity."
»Und Monsieur ist nicht einmal zum Begräbnis des Vetters gefahren?«,"""And monsieur didn't even go to his cousin's funeral?""",“And Monsieur did not go down to his cousin’s funeral?”,“And monsieur did not even go to his cousin’s funeral?”
"»Nichts«, sagte Joachim. »Aber du siehst so heiß aus, ich fürchte, mit deiner Senkung ist es zu Ende.«","""Nothing,"" said Joachim. ""But you look so hot, I'm afraid your subsidence is over.""","“No,” Joachim answered. “But you look so hot, I’m afraid your curve has gone up again.”","“Nothing,” Joachim said. “But you look so flushed that I’m afraid we’ve seen the end of your lowered temperature.”"
"Hans Castorp rührte in seinem Täßchen, obgleich nichts mehr darin war.","Hans Castorp stirred his cup, although there was nothing left in it.","Hans Castorp stirred his coffee-cup, though there was nothing in it.","Hans Castorp stirred his spoon in his cup, although there was nothing in it."
"»Sie scherzen. Das ist nicht mehr ernst. Unser Gespräch löst sich auf und tut es im rechten Augenblick. Wir sind zur Stelle«, sagte Settembrini und zeigte den Vettern das Häuschen, vor dessen Zaunpforte sie hielten, mit dem Stock. Es lag nahe dem Eingang von »Dorf« an der Straße, von der nur ein schmales Vorgärtchen es trennte, und war bescheiden. Wilder Wein schwang sich aus bloßliegenden Wurzeln um die Haustür und streckte einen gebogenen, an die Mauer geschmiegten Arm gegen das ebenerdige Fenster zur Rechten hin, das Schaufenster eines kleinen Kramladens. Das Erdgeschoß sei des Krämers, erklärte Settembrini. Naphtas Logis befinde sich eine Treppe hoch in der Schneiderei, und er selbst domiziliere im Dach. Es sei ein friedlicher Studio.","""You are joking. This isn't serious anymore. Our conversation dissolves and does so at the right moment. We're on the spot,' said Settembrini, pointing the cousins at the fence of the little house with the stick. It was near the entrance to ""Dorf"" on the street, separated from it only by a small front yard, and was modest. Virginia creeper swung from bare roots around the front door and stretched a crooked arm, snuggled against the wall, toward the ground-level window on the right, the window of a small general store. The ground floor was the shopkeeper's, Settembrini explained. Naphta's accommodation is upstairs in the tailor's shop, and he himself is based on the roof. It is a peaceful studio.","“You are joking, of course—you can’t mean what you say. And our discussion comes to an end at the right moment, for here we are,” Settembrini said, and pointed out to the cousins with his stick the cottage before whose gate they had paused. It stood near the beginning of the village: a modest structure, separated from the street by a narrow front garden. A wild grape-vine, springing from bare roots at the door, flung an arm along the ground-floor wall towards the display window of a tiny shop. The ground-floor, Settembrini explained, belonged to the chandler; Naphta was domiciled a floor higher up, with the tailor’s shop, and his own quarters were in the roof, where he had a peaceful little study.","“You’re joking—not even trying to be serious. Our conversation is at an end, and just in time. We’re home,” Settembrini said and for the cousins’ sake pointed with his cane to a little house before whose gate they had now halted. It was a modest structure just this side of Davos-Dorf, separated from the road only by a small yard. Rising from bared roots, wild grape twined around the front door and, clinging to the wall, stretched an arched arm toward the ground-floor window on the right, the display window of a small grocery. The ground floor belonged to the grocer, Settembrini explained. Naphta’s lodgings and the tailor’s shop were the next floor up, his own residence was in the attic—a quiet studio."
"»Mein Vetter Castorp, – Herr Settembrini.«","""My cousin Castorp, - Mr. Settembrini.""","Thus he was not surprised at the name he heard, as Joachim rose from the bench and in some embarrassment presented him: “My cousin Castorp, Herr Settembrini.”","Joachim got up from the bench somewhat flustered and introduced him, “Castorp, my cousin—Herr Settembrini.”"
"Er überschritt den Steg und setzte sich, um sich vom Anblick des Wassersturzes, des treibenden Schaums unterhalten zu lassen, dem idyllisch gesprächigen, einförmigen und doch innerlich abwechslungsvollen Geräusche zu lauschen; denn rauschendes Wasser liebte Hans Castorp ebensosehr wie Musik, ja vielleicht noch mehr. Aber kaum hatte er sichs bequem gemacht, als ein Nasenbluten ihn so plötzlich befiel, daß er seinen Anzug nicht ganz vor Verunreinigung schützen konnte. Die Blutung war heftig, hartnäckig und machte ihm wohl eine {183}halbe Stunde lang zu schaffen, indem sie ihn zwang, beständig zwischen Bach und Bank hin und her zu laufen, sein Schnupftuch zu spülen, Wasser aufzuschnauben und sich wieder flach auf den Brettersitz hinzustrecken, das feuchte Tuch auf der Nase. So blieb er liegen als endlich das Blut versiegte – lag still, die Hände hinter dem Kopf verschränkt, mit hochgezogenen Knien, die Augen geschlossen, die Ohren erfüllt vom Rauschen, nicht unwohl, eher besänftigt vom reichlichen Aderlaß und in einem Zustande sonderbar herabgesetzter Lebenstätigkeit; denn wenn er ausgeatmet hatte, fühlte er lange kein Bedürfnis, neue Luft einzuholen, sondern ließ mit stillgestelltem Leibe ruhig sein Herz eine Reihe von Schlägen tun, bis er spät und träge wieder einen oberflächlichen Atemzug aufnahm.","He crossed the footbridge and sat down to be entertained by the sight of the water fall, the foam drifting, to listen to the idyllically talkative, monotonous and yet inwardly varied noise; for Hans Castorp loved rushing water just as much as music, maybe even more. But no sooner had he settled down than a nosebleed came upon him so suddenly that he could not quite protect his suit from contamination. The bleeding was profuse, persistent, and bothered him for about half an hour, forcing him to keep pacing back and forth between the stream and the bank, rinsing his handkerchief, snorting water, and lying flat on the plank seat again stretch out, the damp cloth on your nose. So he lay when the blood finally stopped lying still, hands clasped behind his head, knees drawn up, eyes closed, ears filled with the noise, not unwell, rather mollified from copious blood-letting, and in a state of oddly diminished vitality; for when he had breathed out he felt no need for fresh air for a long time, but calmly let his heart beat in a series of beats, his body still, until late and lazily he took a superficial breath again.","He crossed the foot-bridge and sat down to regale himself with the sight of the foaming, rushing waterfall and the idyllic sound of its monotonous yet modulated prattle. For Hans Castorp loved like music the sound of rushing water—perhaps he loved it even more. But hardly had he settled himself when he was overtaken by a bleeding at the nose, which came on so suddenly he had barely time to save his clothing from soilure. The bleeding was violent and persistent, taking to stanch it nearly half an hour of going to and fro between bench and brook, snuffing water up his nostrils, rinsing his handkerchief and lying flat on his back upon the wooden seat with the damp cloth on his nose. He lay there, after the blood at length was stanched, his knees elevated, hands folded behind his head, eyes closed, and ears full of the noise of water. He felt no unpleasant sensation, the blood-letting had had a soothing effect, but he found himself in a state of extraordinarily reduced vitality, so that when he exhaled the air, he felt no need to draw it in again, and lay there moveless, for the space of several quiet heart-beats, before taking another slow and superficial breath.","He crossed the wooden bridge and sat down to enjoy the sight of the falling water and rushing foam, to listen to its idyllic chatter, a monotone filled with interior variety. Hans Castorp loved the purl of water as much as he loved music, perhaps even more. But he had no sooner made himself comfortable than his nose began to bleed—so suddenly that he was unable to keep his suit from being stained a little. The flow of blood was strong and persistent and kept him occupied for a good half hour, forcing him to run back and forth between the bench and the brook, rinsing out his handkerchief, sniffing water to rinse his nostrils, then lying down flat on the planks again, the wet cloth over his nose. There he lay quietly until the bleeding finally stopped—his hands clasped behind his head, his knees drawn up, his eyes closed, his ears filled with the rushing of the water. It was not that he felt sick, but rather that the profuse bloodletting soothed him and left him in a state of strangely reduced vitality; he would exhale, and for a long time feel no need to take in new air, but simply lie there, his inert body calmly letting his heart run through a series of beats, until at last he would lazily take another shallow breath."
"{204}Dem Assistenten war für seine Privatordinationen ein eigenes Zimmer eingeräumt, das, wie der große Untersuchungsraum, das Laboratorium, der Operationssaal und das Durchstrahlungsatelier, in dem gut belichteten Kellergeschoß des Anstaltsgebäudes gelegen war. Wir sprechen von einem Kellergeschoß, weil die steinerne Treppe, die vom Erdgeschoß dorthin führte, in der Tat die Vorstellung erweckte, daß man sich in einen Keller begebe, – was aber beinahe ganz auf Täuschung beruhte. Denn erstens war das Erdgeschoß ziemlich hoch gelegen, das Berghofgebäude aber zweitens, im ganzen, auf abschüssigem Grunde, am Berge errichtet, und jene »Keller«-Räumlichkeiten schauten nach vorn, gegen den Garten und das Tal: Umstände, durch die Wirkung und Sinn der Treppe gewissermaßen durchkreuzt und aufgehoben wurden. Denn man glaubte wohl über ihre Stufen von ebener Erde hinabzusteigen, befand sich aber drunten immer noch und wiederum zu ebener Erde oder doch nur ein paar Schuh darunter, – ein belustigender Eindruck für Hans Castorp, als er seinen Vetter, der sich vom Bademeister wiegen lassen sollte, nachmittags einmal in diese Sphäre »hinunter«-begleitete. Es herrschte klinische Helligkeit und Sauberkeit dort; alles war weiß in weiß gehalten, und in weißem Lack schimmerten die Türen, auch die zu Dr. Krokowskis Empfangszimmer, an der die Visitenkarte des Gelehrten mit einem Reißnagel befestigt war, und zu der noch eigens zwei Stufen von der Höhe des Flurganges hinabführten, so daß der dahinter liegende Raum einen gelaßartigen Charakter erhielt. Sie lag rechts von der Treppe, diese Tür, am Ende des Ganges, und Hans Castorp hatte ein besonderes Auge auf sie, während er, auf Joachim wartend, den Korridor auf und nieder ging. Er sah auch jemanden herauskommen, eine Dame, die kürzlich eingetroffen war und deren Namen er noch nicht kannte, eine Kleine, Zierliche mit Stirnlöckchen und goldenen Ohrringen. Sie bückte {205}sich tief, die Stufen ersteigend, und raffte ihren Rock, indes sie mit der anderen kleinen, beringten Hand ihr Tüchlein an den Mund preßte und darüberhin aus ihrer gebückten Haltung mit großen blassen, verstörten Augen ins Leere blickte. So eilte sie mit engen Trittchen, bei denen ihr Unterrock rauschte, zur Treppe, blieb plötzlich stehen, als besänne sie sich auf etwas, setzte sich trippelnd wieder in Lauf und verschwand im Stiegenhause, immer gebückt und ohne das Tüchlein von den Lippen zu nehmen.","{204}The assistant was given his own room for his private surgeries, which, like the large examination room, the laboratory, the operating theater and the X-ray studio, was located in the well-lit basement of the institution building. We speak of a basement because the stone staircase leading there from the ground floor did in fact give the impression of going down to a basement - but this was almost entirely based on deception. Because, firstly, the ground floor was quite high, but secondly, the Berghof building was erected as a whole on sloping ground on the mountain, and those ""cellar"" rooms looked ahead, towards the garden and the valley: circumstances, through the effect and meaning of the stairs were, so to speak, thwarted and nullified. Because you thought you were going down the steps from level ground, but below you were still and again on level ground or at least only a few shoes below - an amusing impression for Hans Castorp when he let his cousin, who was being rocked by the lifeguard should be accompanied ""down"" into this sphere once in the afternoon. Clinical brightness and cleanliness prevailed there; everything was kept white on white, and the doors shimmered in white lacquer, including those to Dr. Krokowski's reception room, to which the scholar's calling card was attached with a thumbtack, and to which two steps led down from the level of the corridor, giving the room behind it a relaxed character. It was to the right of the stairs, this door, at the end of the corridor, and Hans Castorp kept a special eye on it as he walked up and down the corridor, waiting for Joachim. He also saw someone coming out, a lady who had just arrived and whose name he didn't yet know, a small, petite woman with forelocks and gold earrings. She bent down, climbed the steps, and gathered up her skirt, while she pressed her handkerchief to her mouth with the other small, ringed hand, and from her stooped posture she looked into emptiness with large, pale, troubled eyes. So she hurried to the stairs with tight little steps that made her petticoat rustle, stopped suddenly, as if she were remembering something, started tripping again and disappeared into the stairwell, always stooping and without taking the handkerchief from her lips.","The assistant had his own office hours, in a special room, which, together with the large examination-rooms, the laboratory, the operating-rooms and x-ray studio, was in the well-lighted basement of the building. We call it the basement, for the stone steps leading down to it from the ground-floor created the impression that it was such—an erroneous impression, for not only was the ground-floor somewhat elevated, but the entire building stood on a sidehill, part way up the mountain, and these “basement” rooms faced the front, with a view of the gardens and valley, a circumstance negatived to some extent by the fact of the steps leading down to them. One descended, as one supposed, from the ground-floor, only to find oneself at the bottom still on it, or practically so. Hans Castorp amused himself with this illusion when he accompanied his cousin one afternoon down to the “bathing-master,” that Joachim might get himself weighed. A clinical brilliance and spotlessness reigned in this sphere. Everything was as white as white; the doors gleamed with white enamel; the one leading to Dr. Krokowski’s receiving-room, with the doctor’s visiting-card tacked on it, was reached by two more steps down from the corridor, which gave the room behind it an air of being more spacious and withdrawn than the rest. This door was at the end of the corridor, on your right as you came downstairs. Hans Castorp kept his eye on it as he walked up and down waiting for his cousin. He saw a lady come out, a recent arrival, whose name he did not know: a small, dainty person, with curls on her forehead, and gold ear-rings. She bent over as she mounted the stairs, and held up her frock with one beringed hand, while with the other she pressed her tiny handkerchief to her lips and, all stooped as she was, stared up over it into nothing, with great blue, distracted eyes. She hurried with small tripping steps, her petticoat rustling, to the stairs, paused suddenly as though something had occurred to her, then went on tripping upward, and disappeared, still bending over and holding her handkerchief to her mouth.","The assistant director had a private consulting room, which, like the general examination room, the laboratory, the operating room, and the X-ray room, was located in the well-lit basement of the building. We have called it a basement, but although the stone stairway leading down to it from the ground floor did indeed create the impression of a descent into a basement, this was almost entirely an illusion, the reasons for which were, first, that the ground floor sat rather high, and second, that the whole edifice had been built on a steep, mountainous slope, so that the “basement” rooms faced the front and looked out onto the garden and the valley—a state of affairs countered and negated, as it were, by the effect of the stairway. You had the sense you were descending below ground level, but in fact, once downstairs, you were right back on ground level again, or at most a foot or two below it—an effect that delighted Hans Castorp when he discovered it for the first time that afternoon as he accompanied his cousin “down” to those regions, where Joachim was scheduled to have himself weighed by the bath attendant. It was a realm where clinical brightness and cleanliness held sway, everything done in white on white, the doors glistening with white enamel—even the one to Dr. Krokowski’s reception room, to which one of the learned man ’s calling cards had been tacked and which lay two steps lower than the hallway itself, so that the room behind the open door looked rather like a suite. This door was just to the right of the stairway, at the near end of the hall, and Hans Castorp kept his eye on it as he paced up and down the corridor, waiting for Joachim. He saw someone come out, too, a lady who had arrived only recently and whose name he did not know—a small, dainty woman, with curls across her forehead and golden earrings. Gathering her skirts in one hand, she bent low as she took those two steps, and with her other small, heavily ringed hand, she pressed a handkerchief to her mouth—above it, her large, pale, distraught eyes stared at nothing. Still hunched over, she hurried toward the stairway with mincing steps that made her petticoats rustle, stopped suddenly as if pondering something, then began to mince her way up the steps, and vanished up the stairwell—still hunched over, her handkerchief still at her lips."

"Mynheer Peeperkorn war während der Rede seines Gastes in seiner zurückgeworfenen Haltung mit auf die Brust gesenktem Kopfe verharrt, so daß man hätte zweifeln können, ob Hans Castorps Worte in sein Bewußtsein drangen. Jetzt aber, allmählich, während der junge Mann sich verwirrte, begann er, sich von der Lehne aufzurichten, höher und höher, zu voller {858}Größe, während zugleich sein majestätisches Haupt rot anschwoll, seine Stirnarabesken sich hoben und spannten und seine kleinen Augen sich zu blasser Drohung erweiterten. Was bereitete sich vor? Ein Koller, gegen den der vorangegangene nur leichte Verstimmung bedeutet hatte, schien im Anzuge. Mynheers Unterlippe stemmte sich in mächtigem Grimm gegen die obere, so daß die Mundwinkel sich senkten und das Kinn vorgetrieben wurde, und langsam hob sich sein rechter Arm von der Tischplatte in Haupteshöhe und darüber hinaus, die Faust geballt, großartig ausholend zum Vernichtungsschlage gegen den demokratischen Schwätzer, der, in Schrecken gejagt und doch auch abenteuerlich erfreut durch das Bild ausdrucksvoll königlichen Zornmutes, das sich vor ihm entfaltete, Mühe hatte, Furcht und Fluchtneigung zu verbergen. Er sagte eilig zuvorkommend:","Mynheer Peeperkorn had remained in his thrown-back posture, head bowed on his chest, during the speech of his guest, so that one might have doubted whether Hans Castorp's words penetrated his consciousness. But now, gradually, while the young man became confused, he began to raise himself from the back, higher and higher, to his full height, while at the same time his majestic head swelled red, his forehead arabesques rose and strained, and his small eyes expanded into pale menace. What was preparing? A frenzy, against which the previous one had meant only slight irritation, seemed to be on the way. Mynheer's lower lip pressed against the upper lip in mighty fury, so that the corners of his mouth drooped and his chin protruded, and slowly his right arm rose from the tabletop at head height and beyond, fist clenched, grandly ready for the crushing blow against the Democrat Gossiper who, terrified and yet also wildly delighted by the picture expressively royal wrath unfolded before him, had trouble concealing fear and flight. He said hastily courteously:","Mynheer Peeperkorn, during Hans Castorp’s harangue, had sat flung back in his chair, his head still sunk on his breast. It was uncertain even whether he had been listening. But now, slowly, as the young man’s utterance grew more involved, he began to erect himself to his full sitting height, the majestic head inflamed; the pattern of furrows on his brow expanded upwards, his little eyes opened in pallid menace. Obviously a storm was brewing beside which the other had been a passing cloud. Mynheer’s under lip pressed wrathfully against the upper, the corners of his mouth drew down, the chin protruded. Slowly he raised his right arm above his head; the fist clenched and remained poised aloft, ready for summary execution upon the democratic prattler, who for his part was panic-stricken—yet not without a thrill of precarious joy at this spectacle of regal rage. He repressed an inclination to flight, and hastened to say, disarmingly: “Of course, I have failed to express my meaning.","All during his guest’s speech, Mynheer Peeperkorn had remained flung back in his chair with his head sunk to his chest, so that there was some doubt if Hans Castorp’s words had impinged on his consciousness. But now as the young man grew more confused, the older man gradually began to rear up out of his chair, taller and taller, to full size—his majestic head swelling and turning red, the arabesques on his brow rising and spreading, his little eyes growing ever larger in pale threat. What was going to happen? A temper tantrum seemed to be brewing that would make his previous outburst look like minor annoyance. Mynheer’s lower lip was braced in mighty fury against his upper lip, so that both corners of his mouth were pulled down and his chin was thrust forward, and slowly his right arm lifted above the table to the level of his head, then higher still, the fist clenched, poised to deliver an annihilating blow to this democratic chatterbox, who—both filled with terror and yet savoring the eerie sight of eloquent regal wrath unfolding before him—had difficulty hiding his fear and a panicky desire to flee. He hastily decided to try to head things off."
"»Über Würde und Würdelosigkeit,« erwiderte Naphta, »ließe sich reden. Vorderhand wäre es mir eine Genugtuung, wenn diese Zusammenhänge Ihnen Veranlassung gäben, die Freiheit {611}nicht so sehr als schöne Geste, denn als ein Problem zu begreifen. Sie stellen fest, daß die christliche Wirtschaftsmoral in ihrer Schönheit und Menschlichkeit Unfreie schafft. Ich stelle dagegen, daß die Sache der Freiheit, die Sache der Städte, wie man konkreter sagen darf, – daß diese Sache, höchst sittlich, wie sie immer sei, historisch verbunden ist mit der unmenschlichsten Entartung der Wirtschaftsmoral, mit allen Greueln des modernen Händler- und Spekulantentums, mit der Satansherrschaft des Geldes, des Geschäftes.«","'Dignity and indignity,' replied Naphta, 'may be discussed. For the time being it would be a satisfaction for me if these connections gave you a reason to see freedom {611}not so much as a nice gesture, but as a problem. They find that the Christian economic morality, in its beauty and humanity, creates slaves. I object that the cause of liberty, the cause of the cities, as one may say more concretely - that this matter, highly moral as it always is, is historically connected with the most inhuman degeneration of economic morality, with all the horrors of the modern trader - and speculation, with the satanic rule of money, of business.«","“About self-respect and the lack of it,” responded Naphta, “there is a good deal to be said. For the moment, I should be glad if the association were to make you conceive of liberty less as a beautiful gesture and more as a serious problem. You assert that Christian morality, with all its beauty and benignity, makes for servitude. And I, on the other hand, assert that the question of freedom—the question of cities, to put it more concretely—has always been a highly ethical question, and is historically bound up with the inhuman degeneration of commercial morality, with all the horrors of modern industrialism and speculation, and with the devilish domination of money and finance.”","“There is much that we might say about dignity or the lack thereof,” Naphta replied. “For now, I would be most gratified if in this context you might find reason to see freedom less as a lovely gesture and more as a problem. You maintain that the morality of Christian economics, with all its beauty and humanity, creates men who are not free. I, on the other hand, declare that the issue of freedom—or, to put it more concretely, the issue of cities—as highly moral an issue as it may be, is historically associated with a most inhuman degeneration of economic morality, with the many horrors of modern marketeering and speculation, with the satanic rule of money, with commerce.”"
"»Daß das nur keine lasterhafte Anziehungskraft für dich bekommt«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Hm, hm. Herr Settembrini hat mir unterdessen so schön die Zeit vertrieben … was übrigens gar kein Ausdruck ist. Es gilt allenfalls von euerem falschen {307}Bridge, aber Herr Settembrini hat mir die Zeit so bedeutend ausgefüllt … Als anständiger Mensch müßte man ja mit Händen und Füßen trachten, hier fortzukommen, – wo es nun schon mit falschem Bridge losgeht in euerer Mitte. Aber um Herrn Settembrini noch recht oft zu hören und mir von ihm gesprächsweise zur Hand gehen zu lassen, könnte ich beinahe wünschen, unabsehbar lange febril zu bleiben und hier bei euch festzusitzen … Am Ende muß man mir noch eine Stumme Schwester geben, damit ich nicht mogle.«","""Just so that it doesn't have a vicious attraction for you,"" said Hans Castorp. ""Hmm, hmm. In the meantime, Mr Settembrini was really amusing my time … which, by the way, is not an expression at all. At most it applies to your false {307}bridge, but Mr. Settembrini has taken up so much of my time ... As a decent person one would have to try tooth and nail to get away from here - where it is already starting with a false bridge in your midst. But in order to be able to hear Mr. Settembrini quite often and to have him give me a hand in conversation, I could almost wish to stay febrile for an indefinitely long time and be stuck here with you ... In the end I have to be given a mute sister so that I don't cheat.""","“Only so it doesn’t become a vice with you,” Hans Castorp laughed. “Ahem! Herr Settembrini has beguiled the time for me— no, that is not the proper expression, though it may be all right for your mock bridge. Herr Settembrini has filled the time for me, and given it content, whereas when mock bridge breaks out in our midst, a respectable man feels he has to fight his way through. And yet to have the privilege of listening to Herr Settembrini, to get the benefit of his good counsel, I could almost wish to keep my fever, and stop up here with you indefinitely. They would have to give me a ‘silent sister’ to measure with.”","“Just so its appeal doesn’t become a vice,” Hans Castorp said. “Yes, yes—Herr Settembrini has done a splendid job of helping me pass the time—though that’s a poor way of putting it. I suppose that could apply as well to your sham game of bridge. Whereas Herr Settembrini really did help me employ my time meaningfully. A respectable man should be trying with might and main to get out of here—particularly when he sees sham bridge games breaking out in his midst. But given the chance to listen often to Herr Settembrini and to have him lend a helping conversational hand, I think I almost might want to stay feverish indefinitely and just sit tight here with you all. It wouldn’t be long before they would have to give me a silent sister to keep me from cheating.”"
"»Sehr! Ja, dafür habe ich mich schon immer im höchsten Grade interessiert. Der menschliche Körper, für den habe ich immer hervorragend viel Sinn gehabt. Manchmal habe ich mich schon gefragt, ob ich nicht Arzt hätte werden sollen, – in gewisser Weise hätte das, glaube ich, nicht schlecht für mich gepaßt. Denn wer sich für den Körper interessiert, der interessiert sich ja auch für die Krankheit, – namentlich sogar für die, – tut er das nicht? Übrigens hat es nicht viel zu sagen, ich hätte Verschiedenes werden können. Ich hätte zum Beispiel auch Geistlicher werden können.«","""Very! Yes, I have always been extremely interested in that. The human body, I've always had a great sense for it. I've sometimes wondered if I shouldn't have been a doctor - in a way, I think that wouldn't have been a bad fit for me. After all, anyone who is interested in the body is also interested in the disease – specifically even in it – isn't that what it is? By the way, it doesn't mean much, I could have been different. I could have become a clergyman, for example.«","“Very much. Yes, I’ve always felt a good deal of interest in it. The human body— yes, I’ve always had an uncommon turn for it. I’ve sometimes asked myself whether I ought not to have been a physician —it wouldn’t have been a bad idea, in a way. Because if you are interested in the body, you must be interested in disease—specially interested, isn’t that so? But it doesn’t signify, I might have been such a lot of things—for example, a clergyman.”","“Very much. Yes, I’ve always taken a great deal of interest in it. The human body—I’ve always had a singular fondness for it. Sometimes I’ve asked myself if I shouldn’t have become a doctor. In a certain sense, I think, I would not have done badly at it. Because if a man is interested in the body, he is also interested in illness—particularly in that— isn’t he? Not that it means all that much, by the way. I could have become any number of things. I could have become a clergyman, too.”"
"Es war beklemmend, die Hand so nahe vor Augen zu haben, – man mußte sie betrachten, ob man wollte oder nicht, sie studieren in allen Makeln und Menschlichkeiten, die ihr anhafteten, als habe man sie unter dem Vergrößerungsglas. Nein, sie hatte durchaus nichts Aristokratisches, diese zu gedrungene {197}Schulmädchenhand mit den schlecht und recht beschnittenen Nägeln, – man war nicht einmal sicher, ob sie an den äußeren Fingergelenken ganz sauber war, und die Haut neben den Nägeln war zerbissen, das konnte gar keinem Zweifel unterliegen. Hans Castorps Mund verzog sich, aber seine Augen blieben haften an Madame Chauchats Hand, und eine halbe und unbestimmte Erinnerung ging ihm durch den Sinn an das, was Dr. Krokowski über die bürgerlichen Widerstände, die sich der Liebe entgegenstellten, gesagt hatte … Der Arm war schöner, dieser weich hinter den Kopf gebogene Arm, der kaum bekleidet war, denn der Stoff der Ärmel war dünner als der der Bluse, – die leichteste Gaze, so daß der Arm nur eine gewisse duftige Verklärung dadurch erfuhr und ganz ohne Umhüllung wahrscheinlich weniger anmutig gewesen wäre. Er war zugleich zart und voll – und kühl, aller Mutmaßung nach. Es konnte hinsichtlich seiner von keinerlei bürgerlichen Widerständen die Rede sein.","It was oppressive to have your hand so close to your eyes - you had to look at it, whether you wanted to or not, study it in all its flaws and humanity that clung to it, as if you were looking at it under a magnifying glass. No, there was nothing aristocratic about her at all, this squat schoolgirl hand with the ill-trimmed nails - one wasn't even sure if she was completely clean on the outer knuckles, and the skin next to the nails was bitten, that could not be in any doubt. Hans Castorp's mouth twisted, but his eyes lingered on Madame Chauchat's hand, and a half and vague memory flashed through his mind of what Dr. Krokowski had said about the bourgeois resistance that opposed love ... The arm was prettier, this arm gently bent behind the head, which was hardly clothed, because the material of the sleeves was thinner than that of the blouse - the lightest gauze, so that the arm only experienced a certain fragrant transfiguration and would probably have been less graceful without the covering. It was tender and full at the same time - and cool, by all accounts. With regard to him, there could be no question of any bourgeois resistance.","It made him uncomfortable to have the hand so close beneath his eye, to be forced to look at it whether he wished or no, to study it in all its human blemishes and imperfections, as though under a magnifying-glass. No, there was nothing aristocratic about this stubby schoolgirl hand, with the badly cut nails. He was even not quite sure that the ends of the fingers were perfectly clean; and the skin round the nails was distinctly bitten. Hans Castorp made a face; but his eyes remained fixed on Madame Chauchat’s back, as he vaguely recalled what Dr. Krokowski had been saying, about counteracting influences of a bourgeois kind, which set themselves up against the power of love.—The arm, in its gentle upward curve, was better than the hand; it was scarcely clothed, for the material of the sleeve was thinner than that of the blouse, being the lightest gauze, which had the effect of lending the arm a sort of shadowed radiance, making it prettier than it might otherwise have been. It was at once both full and slender—in all probability cool to the touch. No, so far as the arm went, the idea about counteracting bourgeois influences did not apply.","It was almost suffocating to have that hand so close to his eyes—you had to look at it, whether you wanted to or not, to study its inherent humanness and all its defects, as if you were holding a magnifying glass to it. No, it had nothing at all aristocratic about it, this stubby, school-girlish hand with the carelessly trimmed nails—you couldn’t be certain whether the knuckles toward the tips were even clean, and the cuticles were gnawed, there could no longer be any doubt about that. Hans Castorp grimaced, but his eyes remained fixed on Madame Chauchat’s hand, and a vague, halfhearted recollection passed through his mind of something Dr. Krokowski had said about corrective bourgeois forces that counteracted love. . . . But this arm was more beautiful, this arm bent gently behind the head—and was barely clad, because the fabric of the sleeve was thinner than that of the blouse, the flimsiest gossamer, which lent the arm just a hint of delicate illusion, making it even prettier than it probably would have been without any covering. It was both tender and full at the same time—and cool, one could only presume. There could be no question whatever of any counteracting bourgeois forces."

"Ein Schweigen folgte. Es wartete jeder auf eine Äußerung des anderen. Der einzelne hatte sich wohl in den letzten Tagen geprüft, wohin, zu wem seine Gedanken gingen; doch bleibt die Rückkunft Verstorbener, das heißt: die Wünschbarkeit solcher Wiederkehr immer ein verwickeltes und heikles Ding. Im Grunde und gerade heraus gesprochen besteht sie nicht, diese Wünschbarkeit; sie ist ein Irrtum; sie ist, bei Lichte besehen, genau so unmöglich, wie die Sache selbst, was sich erweisen würde, höbe die Natur die Unmöglichkeit dieser nur einmal auf; und was wir Trauer nennen, ist vielleicht nicht sowohl der Schmerz über die Unmöglichkeit, unsere Toten ins Leben kehren zu sehen, als darüber, dies gar nicht wünschen zu können.","A silence followed. Everyone waited for a statement from the other. In the last few days, the individual had probably checked where his thoughts went, to whom; but the return of the deceased, that is, the desirability of such a return, always remains a complicated and delicate matter. Basically, and to put it bluntly, this desirability does not exist; she is a mistake; viewed in the light of day, it is just as impossible as the thing itself, which would be proved if nature abolished its impossibility just once; and what we call sorrow is perhaps not so much the grief at the impossibility of seeing our dead come to life as at not being able to wish it at all.","A silence followed. Each waited for the other to speak. Individually they had probably all questioned themselves, in these last few days; they knew whither their thoughts tended. But the calling back of the dead, or the desirability of calling them back, was a ticklish matter, after all. At bottom, and boldly confessed, the desire does not exist; it is a misapprehension precisely as impossible as the thing itself, as we should soon see if nature once let it happen. What we call mourning for our dead is perhaps not so much grief at not being able to call them back as it is grief at not being able to want to do so.","Silence followed. Everyone was waiting for someone else to say something. Over the last few days, each of them had probably scrutinized the direction of his own thoughts, asked himself to whom they reached out. And yet, the return of those who have died—or better, the desirability of such a return—is always a complicated, ticklish matter. Ultimately, to put it plainly, it does not exist, this desirability. It is a miscalculation; by the light of cold day, it is as impossible as the thing itself, which would be immediately evident if nature rescinded that impossibility even once; and what we call mourning is perhaps not so much the pain of the impossibility of ever seeing the dead return to life, as the pain of not being able to wish it."

"Hochsitzend, gestoßen auf den harten Kissen des Kabrioletts, hatten sie den Wasserlauf, das schmale Geleise zurückgelassen, fuhren sie hin auf der unregelmäßig bebauten, der Eisenbahn gleichlaufenden Straße und hielten auf steinigem Platz vorm Bahnhofsgebäude von »Dorf«, das nicht viel mehr als ein Schuppen war. Hans Castorp erkannte alles mit Schrekken wieder. Seit seiner Ankunft vor dreizehn Monaten, bei einfallender Dämmerung, hatte er die Station nicht wieder gesehen. »Hier bin ich ja angekommen«, sagte er überflüssigerweise, und Joachim antwortete nur: »Tja, das bist du«, und entlohnte den Kutscher.","Sitting high, bumping into the hard cushions of the cabriolet, they had left the watercourse, the narrow track, they drove down the unevenly built road that ran parallel to the railway and stopped on the stony square in front of the station building of ""Dorf"", which was not much more than one dandruff was. Hans Castorp recognized everything with horror. He hadn't seen the station since he'd arrived at dusk thirteen months ago. ""I've arrived here,"" he said unnecessarily, and Joachim only answered: ""Well, that's you,"" and paid the driver.","Erect and bouncing on the hard cushions, they laid the watercourse behind them, the narrow-gauge track; drove along the irregularly built-up street beside the latter, and drew up in the paved square before the station of the Dorf, that was little more than a shell. Hans Castorp with a thrill recalled first impressions. Since his arrival, thirteen months before, in the twilight, he had not seen the station. “Here was where I arrived,” he remarked superfluously, to Joachim, who only said: “So you did,” and paid the coachman.","Sitting up straight, thrown back against the cabriolet’s hard cushions, they crossed the brook and then the narrow tracks, following the street running alongside them and faced by an irregular pattern of buildings, and halted now on the gravel apron in front of the Dorf railroad station, which was not much more than a shed. Hans Castorp was startled to recognize it all again; he had not seen the station since his arrival at dusk thirteen months before. “This is where I arrived,” he said superfluously. And Joachim simply replied, “Yes, so you did,” and paid the driver."
"Spielte nicht etwas von dieser Feindseligkeit auch in das Verhalten der beiden Dialektiker zu Pieter Peeperkorn hinein? Hans Castorp glaubte es zu bemerken, vielleicht weil er es boshafterweise erwartet hatte und im ganzen nicht wenig begierig gewesen war, den königlichen Stammler mit seinen beiden »Regierungsräten«, wie er sie bei sich manchmal witzweise {880}nannte, zusammenzubringen und den Effekt zu studieren. Mynheer wirkte im Freien nicht ganz so großartig wie in geschlossenem Raum. Der weiche Filzhut, den er tief in die Stirn gerückt trug, und der sein weißes Flammenhaar, seine mächtige Stirnlineatur bedeckte, verkleinerte seine Züge, ließ sie gleichsam zusammenschrumpfen und setzte selbst seine gerötete Nase in ihrer Majestät herab. Auch war sein Gehen weniger gut als sein Stehen: Er hatte die Gewohnheit, bei jedem seiner kurzen Schritte den ganzen schweren Körper und sogar auch den Kopf etwas seitwärts fallen zu lassen nach der Seite des Fußes, den er eben vorwärts setzte, was eher gutmütig-greisenhaft als königlich anmutete; ging auch meist nicht zu voller Größe aufgerichtet, wie er stand, sondern etwas zusammengesunken. Aber auch so noch überragte er Herrn Lodovico sowohl wie nun gar den kleinen Naphta um Haupteslänge, – und das war es nicht allein, weshalb seine Gegenwart so sehr, vollkommen so sehr, wie Hans Castorp es einbildungsweise vorweggenommen, auf die Existenz der beiden Politiker drückte.","Didn't some of this hostility play a part in the attitude of the two dialecticians towards Pieter Peeperkorn? Hans Castorp thought he noticed it, perhaps because he had maliciously expected it and on the whole had been quite eager to bring the royal stammerer together with his two ""government councillors,"" as he sometimes jokingly called them {880}, and to have the effect to study. Mynheer didn't look quite as great outdoors as it did indoors. The soft felt hat, which he wore pulled low over his forehead and which covered his flaming white hair and the mighty line of his forehead, reduced his features, made them shrink, as it were, and even belittled his reddened nose in its majesty. Also, his walking was less good than his standing: he was in the habit, with each of his short steps, of letting his whole heavy body and even his head fall a little sideways to the side of the foot he was just putting forward, which was rather good-natured. senile than royal; He also usually did not walk upright to his full height as he stood, but rather slumped a little. But even so, he towered over both Mr. Lodovico and now even little Naphta by a head—and that was not the only reason why his presence depressed the existence of the two politicians so much, completely so much, as Hans Castorp imagined it imaginatively .","Was there something of the same aversion in the attitude of the two dialecticians toward Pieter Peeperkorn? At least, Hans Castorp thought he discerned it, though perhaps he went out to meet it, and took malicious pleasure in watching tongue-tied majesty in contact with his two “auditors,” as, with reference to his stocktaking activities, he jestingly called them—though distinctly feeling that the word was but a definition by contraries! Mynheer, in the open, was not so impressive as in the house. He wore a soft felt hat drawn down on his brows, covering the blaze of white hair and the forehead’s extraordinary folds, reducing, as it were, the scale of his features, even the commanding large red nose. He looked better standing than walking; for he took small steps, and with each one of them shifted the full weight of his body on to the leg he had advanced—it was the comfortable gait of an old man, but it was not kingly. He stooped slightly too, or rather, shrank together; though even so he overlooked Herr Ludovico, and was a whole head taller than little Naphta. But it was not his height alone that made his presence oppressive— oh, quite as oppressive as Hans Castorp had anticipated!—to the two politicians. Yes, they suffered by comparison—so much was perceptible not only to the","And did not this animosity also play a role in the two dialecticians’ attitude toward Pieter Peeperkorn? Hans Castorp thought he noticed something of that, perhaps because he had expected it to be much worse and had been more than a little impatient to introduce the royal stammerer to his own two “viziers,” as he sometimes jokingly called them, and to study the effect. Mynheer did not seem quite as grand out in the open as in a closed room. The soft felt hat that he wore pulled down deep hid the white flames of hair and massive tracery of his brow and made his features look smaller , shrank them as it were; even his red nose lost some of its majesty. And he was less good at walking than standing. He took small steps and had a habit of letting the full weight of his great body, including the head, tilt toward the foot he had just put forward, which made him look more like a kindly, senile old man than a king. Although he always stood pulled up to full height, he did not usually walk that way, but compressed himself somehow. Even then, however, he towered over Herr Lodovico and was several heads taller than little Naphta; but that was not the only reason why his presence weighed so heavily—so overwhelmingly heavily, just as Hans Castorp had pictured it in his imagination—on the existence of the two political theorists."
"Dann sahen sie einander lächelnd an, und da nichts mehr zu sagen blieb, so kehrten sie sich erst die Schultern und dann die Rücken zu und gingen.","Then they looked at each other with a smile, and since there was nothing more to say, they turned their shoulders and then their backs and left.","They looked at each other, and smiled; then, as there remained nothing more to say, they turned, first their shoulders and then their backs, and went.","Then they looked at one another and smiled, and since there was nothing more to say, they turned away, first shoulders, then backs, and walked off."

Und dann ist es ja auch wieder nett von ihm, daß er mir so ohne weiteres Ratschläge gibt, ganz sine pecunia, wie er sich ausdrückt.

And it was nice of him to give me advice gratis like that— ‘ sine pecunia,’ as he put it. I’ll gladly undertake to do as he says, and live just as you do. After all, how else should I do while I’m up here? And it can’t do me any harm; suppose I do put on a little flesh, then, in God’s name—though it sounds a bit disgusting, you will admit.”","“Yes, healthy except for anemia,” Hans Castorp said. “That was a bit much, though, when he told me that I look green. But he’s right , it’s even obvious to me that in comparison to you folks up here I’m downright green—whereas I never really noticed it at home. And that really was very nice of him to just go ahead and offer some advice, quite sine pecunia as he put it. I’ll be happy to do as he says, and I hereby resolve to adapt my habits to yours—what else can I do as long as I’m up here with all of you? And it can’t hurt me, for heaven’s sake, to build up my protein, although that does sound disgusting, you must admit.”"
"{928}»Laß das meine Sache sein«, erwiderte Peeperkorn, »und das andere Sache der Übung und Gewohnheit! Und nun geh, junger Mann! Verlasse mich, mein Sohn!

"Unter so gemischten und wechselnden Empfindungen und Gedanken stieg er im Halbhellen, langsam sich Erhellenden in »Dorf« von der Mündung der Bobbahn auf schmalstem Pfade die Lehne hinan, erreichte den tief verschneiten Wald, überschritt die Holzbrücken, unter denen die Bahn hinablief, und stapfte auf einem Wege, der mehr ein Erzeugnis von Fußspuren, als der Schaufel war, zwischen den Stämmen weiter. Da er hastig ging, überholte er sehr bald Settembrini und Ferge, welcher mit einer Hand den Pistolenkasten unter seinem Radmantel festhielt.

Walking hastily, he very soon overtook Settembrini and Ferge, who was holding the pistol-case under his bike jacket with one hand. Hans Castorp did not hesitate to join them, and no sooner was he at their side than he saw Naphta and Wehsal, who had a slight lead.","In the dusk of that slow-brightening dawn, moved by such mingled and fluctuating hopes and feelings, he mounted the narrow path along the slope, from the village end of the bob-run; arrived at the deeply drifted woods, crossed the little wooden bridge over the course, and followed a way among the tree-trunks trodden by feet in the snow rather than cleared by any shovel. He walked fast, and very soon overtook Settembrini and Ferge, the latter holding the case of pistols with one hand under his cloak. Hans Castorp did not hesitate to join them, and, coming abreast, was aware of Naphta and Wehsal, only a few paces in advance.","And so with mixed and unsettled feelings and thoughts, and by the twilight of slowly approaching dawn, he sought out the very narrow path that started at the end of the bobsled run in Dorf; he climbed the slope, reached the woods drifted full with snow, crossed the wooden bridge beneath which the run passed, and set out between the tree trunks, trudging along a path fashioned more by footsteps than by a shovel.

Das Prinzip der Freiheit hat sich in fünfhundert Jahren erfüllt und überlebt. Eine Pädagogik, die sich heute noch als Tochter der Aufklärung versteht und in der Kritik, der Befreiung und Pflege des Ich, der Auflösung absolut bestimmter Lebensformen ihre Bildungsmittel erblickt, – eine solche Pädagogik mag noch rhetorische Augenblickserfolge davontragen, aber ihre Rückständigkeit ist für den Wissenden über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Alle wahrhaft erzieherischen Verbände haben von jeher gewußt, um was es sich in Wahrheit bei aller Pädagogik immer nur handeln kann: nämlich um den absoluten Befehl, die eiserne Bindung, um Disziplin, Opfer, Verleugnung des Ich, Vergewaltigung der Persönlichkeit. Zuletzt bedeutet es ein liebloses Mißverstehen der Jugend, zu glauben, sie finde ihre Lust in der Freiheit. Ihre tiefste Lust ist der Gehorsam.«","'I tried to introduce logic into our conversation, and you answer me with generosity. I was fairly well aware that the Renaissance gave birth to all that is called liberalism, individualism, humanistic bourgeoisie; but your 'etymological emphasis' leaves me cold, because the 'struggling', the heroic age of your ideals is long gone, these ideals are dead, today they are at least on the last legs, and the feet of those who put an end to them are already at the door. You call yourself a revolutionary, if I'm not mistaken. But if you think that the result of future revolutions will be - liberty, you are mistaken. The principle of freedom has been fulfilled and survived in five hundred years. A pedagogy that still sees itself as the daughter of the Enlightenment and sees its educational means in criticism, in the liberation and nurturing of the ego, in the dissolution of absolutely definite forms of life - such pedagogy may still achieve momentary rhetorical successes, but its backwardness is for the knowledgeable beyond any doubt. All truly educational organizations have always known what all pedagogy can really be about: namely, the absolute command, the iron bond, discipline, sacrifice, denial of the ego, violation of the personality. In the end, it is a loveless misunderstanding on the part of young people to believe that they find their joy in freedom. Your deepest lust is obedience.«","He said: “I try to introduce a little logic into the debate, and you answer me with lofty sentiments. I was already tolerably well aware that what is called liberalism—individualism the humanistic conception of citizenship—was the product of the Renaissance. But the fact leaves me entirely cold, realizing as I do that your great heroic age is a thing of the past its ideals defunct, or at least lying at their latest gasp, while the feet of those who will deal them the coup de grâce are already before the door. You call yourself, if I am not mistaken, a revolutionist. But you err in holding that future revolutions will issue in freedom. In the past five hundred years, the principle of freedom has outlived its usefulness. An educational system which still conceives itself as a child of the age of enlightenment, with criticism as its chosen medium of instruction, the liberation and cult of the ego the solvent of forms of life which are absolutely fixed—such a system may still, for a time, reap an empty rhetorical advantage; but its reactionary character is, to the initiated, clear beyond any doubt All educational organizations worthy of the name have always recognized what must be the ultimate and significant principle of pedagogy: namely the absolute mandate, the iron bond, discipline, sacrifice, the renunciation of the ego, the curbing of the personality. And lastly, it is an unloving miscomprehension of youth to believe that it finds its pleasure in freedom: its deepest pleasure lies in obedience.”","“I was attempting to introduce logic into our conversation,” he said, “and you have replied with high-mindedness. I am more or less aware that the Renaissance gave birth to what is known as liberalism, individualism, humanistic citizenship, and all that. But your emphasis on that verb leaves me cold, inasmuch as the heroic age that ‘wrested’ your ideals came to an end long ago—those ideals are dead, or at best lie twitching in their death throes, and those whom they had hoped to finish off have got their foot in the door again. You call yourself, if I am not mistaken, a revolutionary. But you are badly mistaken if you think that future revolutions will end in freedom. After five hundred years, the principle of freedom has outlived its usefulness. A pedagogic method that regards itself as a daughter of the Enlightenment and employs educational methods based on criticism, on the liberation and nursing of the ego, on the breaking down of ordained living patterns—such a pedagogy may still achieve moments of rhetorical success, but for those who know and understand, it is, beyond all doubt, sublimely backward. All institutions dedicated to genuine education have always known that there can be only one central truth in any pedagogy, and that is: absolute authority and an ironclad bond—discipline and sacrifice, renunciation of the ego and coercion of the personality. It is ultimately a cruel misunderstanding of youth to believe it will find its heart’s desire in freedom. Its deepest desire is to obey.”"
"Wie oft hatte er es betrachtet und an die Lippen gedrückt in der Zeit, die seitdem verflossen war, indem sie Veränderung gezeitigt hatte! Gewöhnung zum Beispiel an ein Leben hier oben in räumlich weiter Abwesenheit Clawdia Chauchats hatte sie gezeitigt, und zwar geschwinder, als man hätte denken sollen: die hiesige Zeit war ja besonders danach geartet und außerdem zu dem Zwecke organisiert, Gewöhnung zu zeitigen, wenn auch nur Gewöhnung daran, daß man sich nicht gewöhnte. Der klirrende Knall zu Beginn der fünf übergewaltigen Mahlzeiten war nicht mehr zu gewärtigen und trat nicht mehr ein; anderswo, in ungeheuerer Entfernung, ließ Frau Chauchat nun Türen zufallen, – eine Wesensäußerung, die mit ihrem Dasein, ihrer Krankheit auf ähnliche Art vermengt und verbunden war wie die Zeit mit den Körpern im Raum: vielleicht war das ihre Krankheit, und nichts weiter … Aber war sie unsichtbar-abwesend, so war sie doch zugleich auch unsichtbar-anwesend für Hans Castorps Sinn, – der Genius des Ortes, den er in schlimmer, in ausschreitungsvoll süßer Stunde, in einer Stunde, auf die kein friedliches kleines Lied des Flachlandes paßte, erkannt und besessen hatte, und dessen inneres Schattenbild er auf seinem seit neun Monaten so heftig in Anspruch genommenen Herzen trug.","How often had he looked at it and pressed it to his lips in the time that had elapsed since it had brought about changes! For example, she had gotten used to living up here in the distant absence of Clawdia Chauchat, and more quickly than one might have thought: the time here was particularly made for it and, moreover, organized for the purpose of getting used to it, if only Getting used to not getting used to it. The clinking bang at the beginning of the five overwhelming meals was no longer to be expected and never happened again; Elsewhere, at a tremendous distance, Mrs. Chauchat was now letting doors slam – an expression of her being that was mixed and connected with her existence, her illness, in a similar way as time was with the bodies in space: perhaps that was her illness and nothing more... But if she was invisible-absent, she was at the same time invisible-present for Hans Castorp's sense - the genius of the place, which he found in a bad, in a riotously sweet hour, in an hour for which no peaceful little song of the lowlands fit , recognized and possessed, and whose inner shadow he bore upon his heart, so engrossed for nine months.","How often had he looked at it, how often pressed it to his lips, in the time which since then had passed and brought its changes with it—such changes as, for instance, getting used to life up here without Clavdia Chauchat, getting used, that is, to her remoteness in space! Yet after all, this adaptation took place more rapidly than one might have thought possible; for was not time up here at the Berghof arranged and organized to the end that one should get very rapidly used to things, even if the getting used consisted chiefly in getting used to not getting used? No longer might he expect that rattle and crash at the beginning of each of the five mighty Berghof meals. Somewhere else, in some far-off clime, Clavdia was letting doors slam behind her, somewhere else she was expressing herself by that act, as intimately bound up with her very being and its state of disease as time is bound up with the motion of bodies in space. Perhaps, indeed, her whole disease consisted in that, and in nothing else.—But though lost to view, she was none the less invisibly present to Hans Castorp; she was the genius of the place, whom, in an evil hour, an hour unattuned to any simple little ditty of the flat-land, yet one of passing sweetness, he had known and possessed, whose shadowy presentment he now wore next his months-long-labouring heart.","How often had he looked at it and pressed it to his lips during the time that had passed since then, bringing forth its changes—changes, for instance, like getting used to life up here without Clavdia Chauchat present in a shared space. And it had happened more quickly than one would have thought: time here was especially conducive to it, was purposely organized so that you got used to things—if only used to not getting used to them. The rattling slam at the start of each of the five sumptuous meals could no longer be reckoned with, it happened no more; and now, somewhere terribly far away, Frau Chauchat was slamming doors —it was an expression of her character, intermingled and bound up with her existence and her illness, much as time was bound up with bodies in space. Perhaps that, that alone, was her illness. But although she was invisibly absent, at the same time she was also invisibly present in Hans Castorp’s mind—as the genius and guardian angel of the place, whom he had known and possessed for one wicked, riotously sweet hour, an hour quite incongruous with some delicate little song from the flatlands, and whose interior silhouette he now bore next to a heart that had been sorely overtaxed for the last nine months."
"»Sie meinen, ich sollte abreisen?« fragte Hans Castorp … »Wo ich gerade erst angekommen bin? Aber nein, wie will ich denn urteilen nach dem ersten Tage!«","“You mean I should leave?” asked Hans Castorp … “Where I just arrived? But no, how am I going to judge after the first day!«","“You mean I should go away?” Hans Castorp asked; “when I’ve hardly come? No, why should I try to judge from the first day?”","“You mean I should leave?” Hans Castorp asked. “When I’ve only just arrived? But no, how can I possibly decide about that after only one day?”"

"Dr. Krokowski begrüßte den neuen Hausgenossen mit einer gewissen heiteren, stämmigen und aufmunternden Herzhaftigkeit, als wollte er andeuten, daß Aug in Auge mit ihm jede Befangenheit überflüssig und einzig fröhliches Vertrauen am Platze sei. Er war ungefähr fünfunddreißig Jahre alt, breitschultrig, fett, bedeutend kleiner als die beiden, die vor ihm standen, so daß er den Kopf schräg zurücklegen mußte, um ihnen ins Gesicht zu sehen, – und außerordentlich bleich, von durchscheinender, ja phosphoreszierender Blässe, die noch gehoben wurde durch die dunkle Glut seiner Augen, die Schwärze seiner Brauen und seines ziemlich langen, in zwei Spitzen auslaufenden Vollbartes, der bereits ein paar weiße Fäden zeigte. Er trug einen schwarzen, zweireihigen, schon etwas abgenutzten Sakkoanzug, schwarze, durchbrochene, sandalenartige Halbschuhe zu dicken, grauwollenen Socken und einen weich überfallenden Halskragen, wie Hans Castorp ihn bis dahin nur bei einem Photographen in Danzig gesehen hatte und welcher der Erscheinung Dr. Krokowskis in der Tat ein ateliermäßiges Gepräge verlieh. Herzlich lächelnd, so daß in seinem Barte die gelblichen Zähne sichtbar wurden, schüttelte er dem jungen Manne die Hand, indem er mit baritonaler Stimme und etwas fremdländisch schleppenden Akzenten sagte:","dr Krokowski greeted the new member of the house with a certain cheerful, stout, and encouraging heartiness, as if to indicate that face to face with him any embarrassment was superfluous and that only cheerful trust was in place. He was about thirty-five years old, broad-shouldered, fat, considerably shorter than the two who stood before him, so that he had to tilt his head back to see their faces--and exceedingly pale, of a translucent, even phosphorescent pallor, which was heightened by the dark glow of his eyes, the blackness of his eyebrows and his rather long full beard ending in two points, which already showed a few white threads. He wore a black, double-breasted, somewhat worn-out jacket, black, openwork, sandal-like shoes, thick gray woolen socks, and a soft, overhanging collar such as Hans Castorp had only seen on a photographer in Danzig and which corresponded to the appearance of Dr. Krokowskis indeed gave it a studio-like character. Smiling warmly so that the yellowish teeth were visible in his beard, he shook the young man's hand, saying in a baritone voice and a somewhat foreign drawl:","Dr. Krokowski greeted the new inmate with a jovial and robust heartiness, as who should say that with him all formality was superfluous, and only jocund mutual confidence in place. He was about thirty-five years old, broad-shouldered and fleshy, much shorter than either of the youths before him, so that he had to tip back his head to look them in the face. He was unusually pale, of a translucent, yes, phosphorescent pallor, that was further accentuated by the dark ardour of his eyes, the blackness of his brows, and his rather long, full whisker, which ended in two points and already showed some white threads. He had on a black double-breasted, somewhat worn sack suit; black, open-worked sandal-like shoes over grey woollen socks, and a soft turndown collar, such as Hans Castorp had previously seen worn only by a photographer in Danzig, which did, in fact, lend a certain stamp of the studio to Dr. Krokowski’s appearance. Smiling warmly and showing his yellow teeth in his beard, he shook the young man by the hand, and said in a baritone voice, with rather a foreign drawl:","Dr. Krokowski greeted the new resident with a kind of jovial, rugged, and reassuring heartiness, as if to imply that in his presence any diffidence was quite superfluous and cheerful mutual trust the only appropriate response.

He wore a black, rather worn, double-breasted business suit and black open-worked shoes, almost sandals really, over gray woolen socks; Hans Castorp had seen a soft, floppy collar like that only once before—sported by a photographer in Danzig—and indeed it did lend something of the artist’s studio to Dr. Krokowski’s general appearance. As he shook the young man’s hand, an effusive smile revealed yellowish teeth under his beard, and in a baritone voice betraying the drawl of a foreign accent, he said, “We bid you welcome, Herr Castorp."
"Damals aber auch, unmittelbar nach dem Verscheiden der Mutter, hatte Leo die Bekanntschaft des Paters Unterpertinger gemacht. Der Sechzehnjährige saß einsam auf einer Bank in den Parkanlagen des sogenannten Margarethenkopfes, einer {667}Anhöhe westlich des Städtchens, am Ufer der Ill, von wo man einen weiten und heiteren Ausblick über das Rheintal genoß, – saß dort, verloren in trübe und bittere Gedanken über sein Geschick, seine Zukunft, als ein spazierendes Mitglied des Lehrkörpers vom Pensionat der Gesellschaft Jesu, genannt »Morgenstern«, neben ihm Platz nahm, seinen Hut neben sich legte, ein Bein unter dem Weltpriesterkleid über das andere schlug und nach einiger Lektüre in seinem Brevier eine Unterhaltung begann, die sich sehr lebhaft entwickelte und für Leos Schicksal entscheidend werden sollte. Der Jesuit, ein umgetriebener Mann von gebildeten Formen, Pädagog aus Passion, ein Menschenkenner und Menschenfischer, horchte auf bei den ersten höhnisch klar artikulierten Sätzen, mit denen der armselige Judenjüngling seine Fragen beantwortete. Eine scharfe und gequälte Geistigkeit wehte ihn daraus an, und weiterdringend stieß er auf ein Wissen und eine boshafte Eleganz des Denkens, die durch das abgerissene Äußere des jungen Menschen nur noch überraschender wurde. Man sprach von Marx, dessen »Kapital« Leo Naphta in einer Volksausgabe studiert hatte, und kam von ihm auf Hegel, von dem oder über den er ebenfalls genug gelesen, um einiges Markante über ihn äußern zu können. Sei es aus allgemeinem Hang zur Paradoxie oder aus höflicher Absicht, – er nannte Hegel einen »katholischen« Denker; und auf die lächelnde Frage des Paters, wie das begründet werden könne, da doch Hegel als preußischer Staatsphilosoph wohl recht eigentlich und wesentlich als Protestant zu gelten habe, erwiderte er: gerade das Wort »Staatsphilosoph« bekräftige, daß er im religiösen, wenn auch natürlich nicht im kirchlich-dogmatischen Sinn mit seiner Behauptung von Hegels Katholizität im Rechte sei. Denn (diese Konjunktion liebte Naphta ganz besonders; sie gewann etwas Triumphierend-Unerbittliches in seinem Munde, und seine Augen hinter den Brillengläsern blitzten auf, jedesmal, wenn er {668}sie einfügen konnte), denn der Begriff des Politischen sei mit dem des Katholischen psychologisch verbunden, sie bildeten eine Kategorie, die alles Objektive, Werkhafte, Tätige, Verwirklichende, ins Äußere Wirkende umfasse. Ihr gegenüber stehe die pietistische, aus der Mystik hervorgegangene, protestantische Sphäre. Im Jesuitentum, fügte er hinzu, werde das politisch-pädagogische Wesen des Katholizismus evident; Staatskunst und Erziehung habe dieser Orden immer als seine Domänen betrachtet. Und er nannte noch Goethe, der, im Pietismus wurzelnd und gewiß Protestant, eine stark katholische Seite besessen habe, nämlich kraft seines Objektivismus und seiner Tätigkeitslehre. Er habe die Ohrenbeichte verteidigt und sei als Erzieher ja beinahe Jesuit gewesen.","At that time, too, immediately after his mother's death, Leo had made the acquaintance of Father Unterpertinger. The sixteen-year-old sat alone on a bench in the park of the so-called Margarethenkopf, a hill west of the town, on the bank of the Ill, from where one could enjoy a wide and serene view of the Rhine valley - sat there, lost in the gloomy and bitter Thoughts about his fate, his future, when a strolling member of the faculty of the boarding school of the Society of Jesus, called ""Morning Star"", sat down next to him, laid his hat beside him, crossed one leg under the secular priest's robe and after some reading in a conversation began in his breviary, which developed very lively and was to become decisive for Leo's fate. The Jesuit, a busy man of educated forms, a passionate teacher, a knower of human nature and fisherman of human beings, listened attentively at the first mockingly articulated sentences with which the poor Jewish youth answered his questions. A sharp and tormented mentality blew out of it, and, penetrating further, he encountered a knowledge and a malicious elegance of thought made only more startling by the young man's ragged exterior. People spoke of Marx, whose Capital Leo Naphta had studied in a popular edition, and from him came Hegel, of whom or about whom he had also read enough to be able to say something striking about him. Be it from a general penchant for paradoxes or from polite intentions, he called Hegel a ""Catholic"" thinker; and to the Father's smiling question as to how this could be justified, since Hegel, as a Prussian state philosopher, must really and essentially be regarded as a Protestant, he replied: the very word ""state philosopher"" confirms that in the religious, albeit natural, was not correct in the ecclesiastical-dogmatic sense with his assertion of Hegel's catholicity. For (Naphta was particularly fond of this conjunction; it took on something triumphantly relentless in his mouth, and his eyes behind his glasses gleamed whenever he could {668} insert it), because the concept of the political is with that of the Catholic psychologically linked, they form a category that encompasses everything objective, workable, active, realizing, that has an effect on the outside. Opposite to it stands the pietistic, Protestant sphere that emerged from mysticism. In Jesuits, he added, the political-pedagogical nature of Catholicism becomes evident; This order has always regarded statecraft and education as its domains. And he also named Goethe, who, having his roots in Pietism and certainly a Protestant, had a strong Catholic side, namely by virtue of his objectivism and his doctrine of activity. He defended auricular confession and as an educator was almost a Jesuit.","And then, immediately after the mother’s passing, Leo made the acquaintance of Father Unterpertinger. The sixteen-year-old lad sat lonely on a bench in the park district of the Margaretentop, as it was called, a small height on the bank of the Ill, overlooking the town, whence one had a pleasant spreading view over the valley of the Rhine. He sat there lost in troubled and bitter thoughts of his fate and his future, when a member of the teaching staff of the Morning Star, the pensionnat of the Society of Jesus, out for a walk, sat down near him, put down his hat on the bench, crossed one leg over the other under his cassock, and after reading his breviary awhile began a conversation which waxed very lively, and proved in the end a decisive factor in Leo’s destiny. The Jesuit, a much-travelled and cultured person, a judge and fisher of men, pedagogue by passion and conviction, pricked up his ears at the scornful tone, the clearly articulated sentences, in which the poor Jewish lad answered his first questions. A keen and tortured intellect breathed in the words, and, probing further, the good father discovered a command of fact and a caustic elegance of thought made only the more surprising by the ragged exterior of the youth. They spoke of Karl Marx, whose Capital Leo had studied in a cheap edition; and passed from him to Hegel, of whom or about whom he had also read enough to be able to say something striking. Whether from a general tendency to paradox, or with intent to be courteous, he called Hegel a “Catholic thinker”; and on the father’s laughing query how that could be substantiated, since Hegel, as Prussian State philosopher, must surely be counted definitely with the Protestants, the boy replied that precisely the phrase “State philosopher” strengthened his position, and justified his characterization in a religious, though, of course, not in a churchly-dogmatic sense. For (Leo loved the conjunction, it came from his mouth with a triumphant, ruthless ring, his eyes flashing behind his spectacles every time he could bring it in) politics and Catholicism were, as conceptions, psychologically akin, both of them belonging to a category which embraced all that was objective, feasible, empirical, with an issue into active life. Opposed to it stood the Protestant, the pietistic sphere, which had its origin in mysticism. Jesuitism, he added, clearly betrayed the political, the pedagogical element in Catholicism; the Society had always regarded statecraft and education as its rightful domain. And he cited Goethe, who, rooted in Protestantism and assuredly Protestant as he was, had yet, by virtue of his objectivity and his doctrine of action, possessed a strongly Catholic side. He had defended auricular confession, and as an educator had been well-nigh Jesuitical.","It was at that same period, immediately after his mother’s demise, that sixteen-year-old Leo made the acquaintance of Father Unterpertinger. He was sitting alone on a bench in the park atop a little hill known as Margaret’s Head, just west of town and with a view to the Ill River and the wide, serene Rhine valley—was sitting there lost in gloomy, bitter thought about his fate and his future, when a strolling member of the faculty of the Morning Star, the local boarding school run by the Society of Jesus, sat down next to him, laid his hat on the bench, crossed one leg over the other under his order’s cassock, and after reading awhile in his breviary struck up a conversation, which soon turned very lively and proved decisive for Leo’s further destiny. The Jesuit, a well-traveled man with cultured manners, a pedagogue by passion, a judge of men, a fisher of men, sat up and took notice at the first sardonic, clearly articulated answers the wretched young Jewish lad gave to his questions. A caustic, tormented spirituality drifted toward him in those words; probing deeper, he discovered both knowledge and a maliciously elegant mode of thought—all the more surprising, given the young man’s tattered exterior. They spoke about Marx, whose Kapital Leo Naphta had studied in a popular edition, and then moved on to Hegel, of whom, or about whom, he had also read enough to be able to offer a few striking comments. Whether due to his general bent for paradox or out of courtesy, he called Hegel a “Catholic” thinker; and in response to the priest’s smiling question about the basis for this comment, inasmuch as Hegel was actually the state philosopher of Prussia and generally considered a Protestant, Leo had replied: the very term “state philosopher” confirmed he was correct in pointing to Hegel’s Catholicity in the religious sense, if not, of course, in regard to Church dogmatics. For (and Naphta was particularly fond of that conjunction—in his mouth it gained something triumphantly inexorable, and his eyes would flash behind his glasses whenever he could insert it), for politics and Catholicism, as concepts, were psychologically related; they formed a single category embracing all objective, actual, active, actualizing reality, and as such stood in contradiction to pietist Protestantism, which had emerged out of mysticism. The political-pedagogic nature of Catholicism, he added, was apparent in the Jesuit order, which had always regarded education and statecraft as its domains. And he also mentioned Goethe, who, though rooted in pietism and most assuredly a Protestant, had also had a strong Catholic side, evident in his objectivism, his doctrine of the active life, and his defense of private confession—as a teacher he had been virtually a Jesuit."
Die Lehrerin dachte nach.,The teacher thought.,The schoolmistress reflected.,The teacher thought hard.
"Die Vettern stimmten zu. Wahrhaftig, so sei es. Hans Castorp, gerührt von der Anrede und vom schlechten Gewissen gespornt, lobte die Äußerung in hohen Tönen, fand sie geistreich, vorzüglich und schriftstellerisch und redete Herrn Settembrini aus allen Kräften nach dem Munde. Gewiß, nur oberflächlich, ganz wie Herr Settembrini es so plastisch gesagt habe, lasse der Komfort auf dem Ozean-Steamer die Umstände und ihre Gewagtheit vergessen, und es liege, wenn er auf eigene Hand das hinzufügen dürfe, sogar eine gewisse Frivolität und Herausforderung in diesem vollendeten Komfort, etwas dem ähnliches, was die Alten Hybris genannt hätten (sogar die Alten zitierte er aus Gefallsucht), oder dergleichen, wie »Ich bin der König von Babylon!«, kurz Frevelhaftes. Auf der anderen Seite aber involviere (»involviere«!) der Luxus an Bord doch auch einen großen Triumph des Menschengeistes und der Menschenehre, – indem er diesen Luxus und Komfort auf die salzigen Schäume hinaustrage und dort kühnlich aufrecht erhalte, setze der Mensch gleichsam den Elementen den Fuß auf den Nacken, den wilden Gewalten, und das involviere den Sieg der menschlichen Zivilisation über das Chaos, wenn er auf eigene Hand diesen Ausdruck gebrauchen dürfe …","The cousins agreed. Truly so be it. Hans Castorp, touched by the salutation and spurred on by a guilty conscience, praised the utterance in high tones, found it witty, excellent and authoritative and spoke to Herr Settembrini with all his might. Certainly, only superficially, just as Mr. Settembrini so vividly said, the comfort on the ocean steamer makes you forget the circumstances and their risk, and there is even a certain frivolity and challenge, if he may add it himself this perfect comfort, something like what the ancients would have called hubris (even the ancients he quoted out of coquetry), or something like ""I am the king of Babylon!"", in short, outrageous. On the other hand, however, the luxury on board also involves (“involves”!) a great triumph of the human spirit and human honor – by carrying this luxury and comfort out onto the salty foam and boldly maintaining it there, the human being, as it were, sets the The foot on the neck of the elements, the savage forces, and that involves the victory of human civilization over chaos, if he may use the expression himself...","The cousins acquiesced. It was precisely that. Hans Castorp, touched by being once more addressed, and pricked by his conscience, praised Herr Settembrini’s words in sounding tones; pronounced them capital; said how spirited they were, how much the language of a literary man. He could not say too much. Undoubtedly, though only superficially, as Herr Settembrini, in his plastic way, had remarked, the comfort on board an ocean steamer did make one forget the element of risk in the circumstances. If he might venture to add anything, he would say it even induced a sort of light-headedness, a tempting of fate, which the ancients—in his desire to please he quoted the classics!—had called hubris. Belshazzar, King of Babylon, and that sort of thing. In short, it came close to being blasphemous. Yet, on the other hand, the luxury of an ocean-going vessel connoted (!) a majestic triumph of the human spirit, it was an honour to human kind, to launch all this comfort and luxury upon the salt sea foam and there sustain it —man thus boldly set his foot, as it were, upon the forces of nature, controlled the wild elements; and that connoted (!) the victory of civilization over chaos—if he might make so free as to employ the phrase.","The cousins agreed. It really was true. Touched by having been spoken to and spurred on by his own bad conscience, Hans Castorp had high praise for these sentiments, found them witty, choice, and literary, and made every effort to say what he thought Herr Settembrini wanted to hear. To be sure, just as Herr Settembrini had put it so graphically, the comforts on an ocean liner allowed one only superficially to forget the real situation and its dangers, and there was, if he might be permitted to add a comment of his own, even a kind of frivolous provocation about that perfect comfort, somewhat like what the ancients called hubris (in his desire to please, he was even citing the classics)—“I am the king of Babylon,” and that sort of thing—in a word, sacrilege. On the other hand, however, the luxury on board manifested (“manifested”!) a great triumph of the human spirit and human dignity—for in bearing luxury and comfort out onto the briny, foamy deep and boldly maintaining it there, man was, so to speak, setting his boot on the neck of the elements, of savage forces, and that manifested the triumph of human civilization over chaos, if he might be permitted the phrase."

"»Nein, Herr Hofrat. Aber ich kann nicht länger warten. Wenn ich nicht ganz den Anschluß verpassen will, so kann ich meine richtige Genesung hier oben nicht abwarten. Ich muß jetzt hinunter.

He had guessed her from my refusal to kiss you on the forehead in his presence.

He guessed, when I refused to kiss you on the forehead, in his presence. At this moment, his presence is rather symbolic than actual—but will you let me do it now?”","“It was impossible for me to dispute it.

"Sie überschritten den Steg, der über die Schlucht führte, worin im Sommer der jetzt in Starre verstummte Wasserfall niederging, und der so sehr zu dem malerischen Charakter des Ortes beitrug. Naphta und Wehsal gingen im Schnee vor der mit dicken weißen Kissen gepolsterten Bank auf und ab, auf der Hans Castorp einst, unter ungewöhnlich lebendigen Erinnerungen, das Ende seines Nasenblutens hatte erwarten müssen. Naphta rauchte eine Zigarette, und Hans Castorp prüfte sich, ob er ebenfalls Lust hätte, das zu tun, fand aber nicht die geringste Neigung dazu in sich vor und schloß, daß es also bei jenem erst recht auf Affektation beruhen müsse. Mit dem Wohlgefallen, das er hier stets empfand, sah er sich in der kühnen Intimität seiner Stätte um, die unter diesen eisigen {1068}Umständen nicht weniger schön war, als zu Zeiten ihrer blauen Blüte. Stamm und Gezweig der schräg ins Bild ragenden Fichte waren mit Schnee beschwert.","They crossed the footbridge that led across the gorge, into which in summer the waterfall, now silent, fell, and which contributed so much to the picturesque character of the place. Naphta and Wehsal walked up and down in the snow in front of the bench, upholstered with thick white cushions, on which Hans Castorp had once had to wait, with unusually vivid memories, for his nosebleed to stop. Naphta smoked a cigarette, and Hans Castorp checked whether he too would like to do the same, but found not the slightest inclination to do so and concluded that in the case of the former it must be based on affectation. With the pleasure he always felt here, he looked about the bold intimacy of his place, which was no less beautiful in these icy {1068}circumstances than when it was blue in bloom. The trunk and branches of the spruce, which protrudes diagonally into the picture, were weighed down with snow.","They crossed the foot-bridge over the gorge, where the waterfall hung stiff and silent. Naphta and Wehsal were walking up and down before the bench now upholstered with thick white cushions of snow: the bench on which Hans Castorp, lying to await the end of his nose-bleeding, had experienced such lively memories out of the distant past. Naphta was smoking a cigarette, and Hans Castorp questioned himself if he should do the same, but found he had no faintest desire. It seemed to him an affectation in the other. With the pleasure he always felt in these surroundings, he looked about at them in their icy state and found them not less beautiful than in the season of their blue blossom-time. The fir that jutted so boldly into the picture had its trunk and branches laden with snow.","They crossed the footbridge leading over the gorge where the waterfall, now rigid and mute, would plunge come summer, lending the spot much of its picturesque quality. Naphta and Wehsal were pacing back and forth in front of the bench, covered now with thick white pillows of snow, but on which, while waiting for a nosebleed to end, Hans Castorp had once relived uncommonly vivid memories. Naphta was smoking a cigarette, and Hans Castorp asked himself whether he would like to do the same and, finding that he had not the least desire, decided this had to be an affectation on Naphta’s part. He looked around him now, delighting as always in this boldly intimate spot, which even under these icy conditions was no less beautiful than during the season of blue blossoms. The trunk and branches of the spruce that jutted at an angle across the scene were laden with snow."
"»Siehst du wohl!« unterbrach ihn Hans Castorp rasch noch einmal. »Siehst du wohl, daß man einen Hut aufhaben soll! Es ist mir natürlich aufgefallen, daß ihr keinen tragt hier oben. Man soll aber einen aufsetzen, damit man ihn abnehmen kann, bei Gelegenheiten, wo es sich schickt. Aber was denn nun weiter?«","""You see!"" Hans Castorp quickly interrupted him again. ""You see, you should wear a hat! Of course I noticed that you're not wearing one up here. But you should put one on so that you can take it off on occasions where it is appropriate. But what next?'","“There, you see, don’t you?” Hans Castorp interrupted him again. “You see now, one ought to wear a hat. Naturally I’ve noticed that none of you do up here; but you should, so you can have something to take off when it is proper to do so. Well, but what then?”","“You see!” Hans Castorp quickly interrupted yet again. “You see, a man should always wear a hat. I’ve noticed, of course, that you people up here never wear one. But you should, so that you can tip it whenever the occasion demands. But now what happened?”"
"»Man höre den Voltairianer, den Rationalisten. Er lobt die Natur, weil sie uns auch bei fertilster Gelegenheit nicht mit mystischen Dämpfen verwirrt, sondern klassische Trockenheit wahrt. Wie hieß doch die Feuchtigkeit auf lateinisch?«","»Listen to the Voltairian, the rationalist. He praises nature because, even on the most fertile occasion, it does not confuse us with mystical fumes, but instead preserves classic dryness. What was the name of the dampness in Latin?'","“Hark to the Voltairian, the rationalist! He praises nature, because even when she has the chance she doesn’t befog us with mystic vapours, but preserves a dry and classic clarity. And yet—what is the Latin for humidity?”","Tilting his head to point at the Italian, he said with a drawl, “Just listen to our rationalist here, our Voltairian. He’s praising nature because even in her fertile phase she does not confuse us with mystic damps, but provides classical austerity. And yet, what is the Latin word for moisture?”"

Mit geistigen Dingen kann man beleidigen, aber man kann nicht damit beschimpfen. Das ist eine Maxime, die jedes Ehrengericht anneh{1060}men würde, ich kann es Ihnen bei Gott versichern. Und darum ist auch das, was Sie ihm von ›Infamie‹ und ›strenger Züchtigung‹ geantwortet haben, keine Beschimpfung, denn auch das war geistig gemeint, es hält sich alles im geistigen Bezirke und hat mit dem persönlichen überhaupt nichts zu tun, worin es einzig so etwas wie Beschimpfung gibt. Das Geistige kann niemals persönlich sein, das ist die Vervollständigung und die Erläuterung der Maxime, und deshalb –«","""Rightly so, rightly so! He insulted you with that. But he didn't insult you! That's a difference, allow me! These are abstract things, spiritual things. One can offend with spiritual things, but one cannot insult with them. That's a maxim that any court of honor would accept, I can assure you to God. And that's why what you told him about 'infamy' and 'severe punishment' is not an insult, because that too was meant spiritually, it's all in the spiritual realm and has absolutely nothing to do with the personal, what it is there's only such a thing as insults. The spiritual can never be personal, that is the completion and explanation of the maxim, and therefore -""","“Oh, justifiably, quite justifiably! He affronted you. But he did not insult you. There is a difference. Permit me to say so. It was a matter of abstractions, an intellectual disagreement. On intellectual topics he could affront you, perhaps, but not insult you. That is axiomatic, any court of honour would tell you the same, I swear to God they would. And so neither was your answer to him, about infamy and chastisement an insult; because it was in an intellectual sense, the whole affair was in the intellectual sphere, and has nothing to do with the personal, and an insult can only be personal. The intellectual can never be personal, that is the conclusion and the explanation of the axiom, and therefore—”","“And rightly so, rightly so. He did offend you. But he did not insult you! There is a difference, if you will permit me to say so. It was about abstractions, about ideas. You can offend someone with abstract ideas, but you cannot insult him with them. That’s a maxim that would be accepted in any court of honor, I can assure you of that, by God. And so what you said to him about its being ‘infamous’ and having to be ‘severely punished’ was no insult, either, because it, too, was meant intellectually. It all belongs to the realm of the intellect and has nothing to do with either of you personally, which is the only way something can be an insult. Intellectual abstractions can never be personal, that is the logical conclusion and extension of my maxim.”"
"»Gut,« sagte Joachim, »so können wir’s vorläufig machen. Und dann können wir ja auch mit dem anderen noch etwas zuwarten.«","""Good,"" said Joachim, ""we can do it like this for the time being. And then we can wait a little longer with the other one.«","“Good,” said Joachim. “We can do that for the present. And for the other matters we can wait and see.”","“Fine,” Joachim said, “that’s what we’ll do for now. And the rest of it can wait, too.”"
"So war er denn auch im Herzen einverstanden, daß der Großvater in seiner Richtigkeit und Vollkommenheit prangte, als es eines Tages hieß, Abschied von ihm zu nehmen. Das war im Saale, demselben Saal, wo sie so oft am Eßtisch einander gegenüber gesessen; in seiner Mitte lag Hans Lorenz Castorp nun auf der von Kränzen umstellten und umlagerten Bahre im silberbeschlagenen Sarge. Er hatte die Lungenentzündung durchgekämpft, hatte zäh und lange gekämpft, obgleich er doch, wie es schien, im gegenwärtigen Leben nur anpassungsweise zu Hause gewesen war, und lag nun, man wußte nicht recht ob siegreich oder überwunden, auf jeden Fall mit streng befriedetem Ausdruck und stark verändert und spitznäsig vom Kampfe auf seinem Paradebett, den Unterkörper von einer Decke verhüllt, auf welcher ein Palmzweig lag, den Kopf vom {45}seidenen Kissen hochgestützt, so daß das Kinn aufs schönste in der vorderen Einbuchtung der Ehrenkrause ruhte; und zwischen die halb von den Spitzenmanschetten bedeckten Hände, deren Finger bei künstlich-natürlicher Anordnung Kälte und Unbelebtheit nicht verhehlten, hatte man ihm ein Elfenbeinkreuz gesteckt, auf das er mit gesenkten Lidern unverwandt niederzublicken schien.","So he agreed in his heart that his grandfather should shine in his correctness and perfection when one day it was time to say goodbye to him. That was in the hall, the same hall where they so often sat opposite each other at the dining table; in his midst lay Hans Lorenz Castorp on the bier surrounded by wreaths and besieged in the silver-bound coffin. He had fought through the pneumonia, had fought long and hard, although it seemed that in his present life he had only been at home to adapt, and now, one could not be sure whether victorious or defeated, he was lying in any case with a severely pacified expression and much changed and pointy-nosed from the struggle on his parade bed, his lower body covered by a blanket on which lay a palm branch, his head propped up on the silk pillow, so that his chin rested most beautifully in the front indentation of his ruff of honor; and between his hands, half-covered by lace cuffs, whose fingers, in their artificial-natural arrangement, did not hide the cold and lifelessness, an ivory cross had been placed on him, at which he seemed to be staring fixedly with lowered eyelids.","Thus he was glad from his heart that it should be the authentic, the perfect grandfather who lay there resplendent on that day when he came to take last leave of him. It was in the room where so often they had sat facing each other at table; and now, in the centre, Hans Lorenz Castorp was lying in a silver-mounted coffin, upon a begarlanded bier. He had fought out the attack on his lungs, fought long and stoutly, despite his air of being at home in the life of the day only by dint of his powers of adaptability. One hardly knew whether he had won or lost in the struggle; but in any case there he lay, with a stern yet satisfied expression, on his bed of state. He had altered with the illness, his nose looked sharp and thin; the lower half of his body was hidden by a coverlet on which lay a palm branch; the head was lifted high by the silken pillow, so that his chin rested beautifully in the front swell of the ruff. Between the hands, half-shrouded in their lace cuffs, their visibly cold, dead fingers artfully arranged to simulate life, was stuck an ivory cross. He seemed to gaze, beneath drooping lids, steadfastly down upon it.","And so when the day came to say farewell, in his heart of hearts little Hans Castorp was relieved to see his grandfather decked out in his authentic perfection. It was in the dining room, the same room where they had so often sat across the table from one another; in the middle of the room Hans Lorenz Castorp now lay in a silver-trimmed coffin, atop a bier surrounded and besieged with wreaths. He had battled pneumonia to the end, had battled long and obstinately, even though, to all appearances, he had accommodated himself only in part to contemporary life; but now here he lay in state—one could not be sure whether triumphant or vanquished, but in any case, with a stern, satisfied look on his face, though it was greatly changed, his nose looking pinched after his struggles; his lower body shrouded under a coverlet, on which lay a palm frond; his head propped up on the silk pillow so that his chin rested most handsomely in the indentation at the front of the ceremonial ruff. And in his hands—half hidden by lace cuffs, the fingers looking cold and inanimate despite their artificially natural pose—someone had placed an ivory cross, upon which his eyes, beneath their lowered lids, seemed to be fixed."
"{287}Das war der Sonntag, der Montag. Aus Abend und Morgen wurde der dritte Tag von Hans Castorps Aufenthalt in der »Remise«, ein Wochentag ohne Auszeichnung, der Dienstag. Es war aber der Tag seiner Ankunft hier oben, er war nun rund drei Wochen an diesem Ort, und so trieb es ihn doch, den Brief nach Hause zu schreiben und seine Onkel wenigstens obenhin und für den Augenblick über den Stand der Dinge zu unterrichten. Sein Plumeau im Rücken, schrieb er auf einem Briefbogen der Anstalt, daß seine Abreise von hier sich planwidrig verzögere. Er liege mit einer fieberigen Erkältung, die von Hofrat Behrens, übergewissenhaft, wie er wohl sei, offenbar nicht ganz auf die leichte Achsel genommen werde, da er sie mit seiner, des Schreibers, Konstitution überhaupt in Zusammenhang bringe. Denn gleich bei der ersten Bekanntschaft habe der dirigierende Arzt ihn stark anämisch gefunden, und alles in allem scheine es, als ob maßgeblicherseits die von ihm, Hans Castorp, zu seiner Erholung angesetzte Frist nicht für recht ausreichend erachtet werde. Weiteres ehetunlichst. – So ist es gut, dachte Hans Castorp. Da ist kein Wort zu viel und doch hält es auf jeden Fall eine Weile vor. – Der Brief wurde dem Hausdiener übergeben, der ihn unter Vermeidung des Umweges über den Kasten unmittelbar zum nächsten fahrplanmäßigen Zug beförderte.","{287}That was Sunday, Monday. Evening and morning turned into the third day of Hans Castorp's stay in the Remise, a weekday without distinction, Tuesday. But it was the day of his arrival up here, he had been in this place for about three weeks, and so he felt compelled to write the letter home and to inform his uncles about the state of affairs, at least for the moment. With his plumeau on his back, he wrote on a letter from the institution that his departure from here was being delayed, contrary to plan. He was suffering from a fever, which Hofrat Behrens, overly conscientious as he was, obviously did not take it lightly, since he associated it with his, the writer's, constitution in general. For the doctor in charge found him severely anemic right from the first acquaintance, and all in all it seems as if the time allowed by him, Hans Castorp, for his recovery was not considered to be quite sufficient. More marriageably. - That's good, thought Hans Castorp. There is not a word too much and yet it definitely lasts a while. The letter was handed over to the porter, who took it straight to the next scheduled train, avoiding the detour via the box.","That was the Sunday, and the Monday. The evening and the morning made the third day of Hans Castorp’s sojourn in the “caboose.” It was a day without distinction, an ordinary weekday, that Tuesday—but after all, it was the day of his arrival in this place, he had been here a round three weeks, and time pressed; he would have to send a letter home and inform his uncle of the state of affairs, even though cursorily and without reference to their true inwardness. He stuffed his down quilt behind his back, and wrote upon the note-paper of the establishment, to the effect that his departure was being delayed beyond the appointed time. He was in bed with a feverish cold, which Hofrat Behrens—over-conscientious as he probably was—refused to take lightly; insisting on regarding it as immediately connected with his (Hans Castorp’s) constitution and general state of health. The physician had perceived directly he saw him that he was decidedly anæmic; and take it all in all, it seemed as though the limit he had originally set for his stay was not regarded by the authorities as long enough for a full recovery. He would write again as soon as he could.—That ’s the idea, thought Hans Castorp; not too much or too little; and whatever the issue, it will satisfy them for a while. The letter was given to the servant, with instructions that it be taken direct to the station and sent off by the earliest possible train, instead of being posted in the usual way in the house letter-box, with consequent delays.","And so Sunday, and Monday, passed. And the evening and the morning were the third day of Hans Castorp’s stay in the “stall,” a weekday with nothing to distinguish it—a Tuesday, the day of his arrival. He had been here for three weeks, and so he felt compelled to write a letter home and inform his uncle, however superficially for now, of how things stood. His pillows stuffed behind his back, he wrote on sanatorium stationery about how his scheduled departure had been delayed. He was lying in bed with a fever and a cold, which Director Behrens, being the overconscientious doctor he was, had evidently refused to take all that lightly and instead saw within the larger context of his—the letter-writer’s—general constitution. At their very first meeting, in fact, the supervising physician had found him very anemic, and in consequence of all this, it now appeared that the length of stay that he—Hans Castorp—had originally planned could no longer be regarded as sufficient. Further details as soon as possible. “Just right,” Hans Castorp thought, “not one word too many, and yet it takes care of things for a while, no matter what.” The letter was handed to the porter, who avoided the postal detour of a mailbox, and took it down to meet the next scheduled train."

"Wie lange das dauerte, wußte er nicht. Als der Zeitpunkt gekommen war, ertönte das Gong. Aber es rief noch nicht unmittelbar zur Mahlzeit, es mahnte nur, sich bereit zu machen, wie Hans Castorp wußte, und so blieb er noch liegen, bis das metallische Dröhnen zum zweitenmal anschwoll und sich entfernte. Als Joachim durch das Zimmer kam, um ihn zu holen, wollte Hans Castorp sich umziehen, aber nun erlaubte Joachim es nicht mehr. Er haßte und verachtete Unpünktlichkeit. Wie man denn vorwärts kommen wolle und gesund werden, um Dienst machen zu können, sagte er, wenn man sogar zu schlapp sei, um die Essenszeit einzuhalten. Da hatte er natürlich recht, und Hans Castorp konnte lediglich darauf hinweisen, daß er ja nicht krank, dafür aber im höchsten Grade schläfrig sei. Er wusch sich nur rasch die Hände; dann gingen sie in den Saal hinunter, zum drittenmal.","He didn't know how long that lasted. When the time came, the gong sounded. But it didn't immediately call for the meal, it was just a reminder to get ready, as Hans Castorp knew, and so he remained lying there until the metallic roar grew louder and went away a second time. When Joachim came across the room to fetch him, Hans Castorp wanted to change, but now Joachim wouldn't allow it anymore. He hated and despised unpunctuality. How do you want to get ahead and get well in order to be able to work, he said, when you're too weak to keep to mealtimes. Of course he was right, and Hans Castorp could only point out that he wasn't ill, but that he was extremely sleepy. He just washed his hands quickly; then they went down into the hall for the third time.","HOW long it lasted he could not have told. When the moment arrived, the gong sounded. But it was not the gong for the meal, it was only the dressing-bell, as Hans Castorp knew, and so he still lay, until the metallic drone rose and died away a second time. When Joachim came to fetch him, Hans Castorp wanted to change, but this Joachim would not allow. He hated and despised unpunctuality. Would he be likely, he asked, to get on, and get strong enough for the service, if he was too feeble to observe the hours for meals? Wherein he was, of course, quite right, and Hans Castorp could only say that he was not ill at all, but only utterly and entirely sleepy. He confined himself to washing his hands; and then for the third time they went down together to the dining-hall.","How long that lasted he didn’t know. At the appropriate time, the gong rang out. But, as Hans Castorp was aware, it was not the call for dinner itself, merely the warning to get ready for it; and so he lay there for a while until the metallic rumble swelled and fell away a second time. When Joachim came through the room to fetch him, Hans Castorp wanted to change first, but Joachim said it was too late and wouldn’t let him. He hated unpunctuality. How could you ever make any progress and become healthy enough for military service again, he said, if you were so weak-willed that you couldn’t make it to meals on time. He was right, of course, and Hans Castorp could only point out that he wasn’t the one who was sick, although he certainly was incredibly sleepy. He just washed his hands quickly; and they walked down to the dining hall, for the third time."
"»Gott bewahre!« sagte Hans Castorp, als er mit Joachim im Lift stand. »Das ist wirklich ein Pädagog, – er sagte es ja neulich schon selbst, daß er so eine Ader habe. Man muß furchtbar aufpassen mit ihm, daß man kein Wort zu viel sagt, sonst gibt es ausführliche Lehren. Aber hörenswert ist es ja, wie er zu sprechen versteht, jedes Wort springt ihm so rund und appetitlich vom Munde, – ich muß immer an frische Semmeln denken, wenn ich ihm zuhöre.«","""God forbid!"" said Hans Castorp as he stood in the elevator with Joachim. ""He's really a pedagogue - he said it himself the other day that he had a streak like that. You have to be extremely careful with him that you don't say a word too much, otherwise there will be detailed teachings. But it's worth hearing how he knows how to speak, every word jumps out of his mouth so round and appetizing - I always have to think of fresh rolls when I listen to him.""","“Bless us and keep us!” Hans Castorp said to Joachim, as they stood in the lift. “What a pedagogue it is! He said himself that he had the ‘pedagogic itch.’ One has to watch out with him, not to say more than one means, or he is down on you at once with all his doctrines. But after all, it is worth listening to, he talks so well; the words come jumping out of his mouth so round and appetizing—when I listen to him, I keep seeing a picture of fresh hot rolls in my mind’s eye.”","“Heaven help us!” Hans Castorp said, as he took his place beside Joachim in the elevator. “That’s your true pedagogue—he himself said not long ago that he had a pedagogic streak. You have to be awfully careful not to say one word too many, otherwise you’ll get an extensive lecture. But it is worth listening to, just the way he speaks, how each word leaps from his mouth so round and appetizing—listening to him always reminds me of fresh hot buns.”"
"Hans Castorp erklärte sich zu der Diversion bereit und bedankte sich recht schön für das ihm gewidmete Augenmerk. Den Kopf gegen die Schulter geneigt, blickte er dem davonrudernden Hofrat nach. Die Ansprache des Chefs traf genau in einen kritischen Moment; Radamanth hatte Mienen und Stimmung des Berggastes ziemlich richtig gedeutet, und sein neues Unternehmen war bestimmt – ausdrücklich dazu bestimmt, die Absicht war gar nicht geleugnet worden –, den toten Punkt zu überwinden, auf den dieser Gast sich seit kurzem gelangt fand, wie eben aus seiner Mimik zu schließen war, die deutlich an diejenige des seligen Joachim erinnerte, zur Zeit, als gewisse wilde und trotzige Entschlüsse sich in ihm vorbereitet hatten.","Hans Castorp agreed to the diversion and thanked him for the attention given to him. Tilting his head against his shoulder, he watched the privy councilor row away. The chief's speech came at a critical moment; Radamanth had read the mountain guest's expressions and mood quite correctly, and his new venture was destined-specifically destined, the intention had not been denied-to break the impasse this guest had recently found himself at, as of now From his facial expressions, which clearly recalled those of Blessed Joachim at the time when certain wild and defiant resolutions were being prepared in him.","Hans Castorp declared himself ready for the diversion, and thanked the Hofrat in due form for his efforts in his behalf. He put his head on one side and watched Behrens paddle off. It was true: the intervention had come at the critical moment, Rhadamanthus had not been far out in the description he gave of Hans Castorp’s face and air. The new undertaking was put forth—quite explicitly, there had been no attempt to wrap it up—in order to tide him over the crisis he was in, which betrayed itself by a bearing very like the departed Joachim’s, when he was mentally working himself up to a certain desperate resolve.","Hans Castorp declared himself prepared to be diverted and thanked Behrens nicely for keeping such a steady eye out. His head tilted toward one shoulder, he watched the director row away. The boss’s little speech had come at a critical moment. Rhadamanthus had been very close to the mark in interpreting his guest’s expression and mood, and his new initiative was intended—expressly intended, he did not deny it at all—to help Hans Castorp move beyond the dead standstill at which he found himself of late, as was obvious in his body language, so clearly reminiscent of Joachim’s in the days when certain wild, defiant decisions were forming inside him."

"Selbst ins Bioskop-Theater von »Platz« führten sie Karen Karstedt eines Nachmittags, da sie das alles so sehr genoß. In der schlechten Luft, die alle drei physisch stark befremdete, da sie nur das Reinste gewohnt waren, sich ihnen schwer auf die Brust legte und einen trüben Nebel in ihren Köpfen erzeugte, flirrte eine Menge Leben, kleingehackt, kurzweilig und beeilt, in aufspringender, zappelnd verweilender und wegzuckender Unruhe, zu einer kleinen Musik, die ihre gegenwärtige Zeitgliederung auf die Erscheinungsflucht der Vergangenheit anwandte und bei beschränkten Mitteln alle Register der Feierlichkeit und des Pompes, der Leidenschaft, Wildheit und girrenden Sinnlichkeit zu ziehen wußte, auf der Leinwand vor ihren {480}schmerzenden Augen vorüber. Es war eine aufgeregte Liebes- und Mordgeschichte, die sie sahen, stumm sich abhaspelnd am Hofe eines orientalischen Despoten, gejagte Vorgänge voll Pracht und Nacktheit, voll Herrscherbrunst und religiöser Wut der Unterwürfigkeit, voll Grausamkeit, Begierde, tödlicher Lust und von verweilender Anschaulichkeit, wenn es die Muskulatur von Henkersarmen zu besichtigen galt, – kurz, hergestellt aus sympathetischer Vertrautheit mit den geheimen Wünschen der zuschauenden internationalen Zivilisation. Settembrini, als Mann des Urteils, hätte die humanitätswidrige Darbietung wohl scharf verneinen, mit gerader und klassischer Ironie den Mißbrauch der Technik zur Belebung so menschenverächterischer Vorstellungen geißeln müssen, dachte sich Hans Castorp und flüsterte dergleichen seinem Vetter auch zu. Frau Stöhr dagegen, die ebenfalls anwesend war und nicht weit von den Dreien saß, erschien ganz Hingabe; ihr rotes, ungebildetes Gesicht war im Genusse verzerrt.","They even took Karen Karstedt to Platz's Bioskop Theater one afternoon because she enjoyed it all so much. In the bad air, which physically alienated all three, since they were only used to the purest things, weighed heavily on their chests and created a cloudy fog in their heads, a multitude of life shimmered, chopped up, entertaining and hasty, in a leaping, wriggling restlessness that lingers and twitches away, to a little piece of music that applied its current time structure to the phenomenal flight of the past and, with limited resources, knew how to pull out all the registers of solemnity and pomp, of passion, wildness and cooing sensuality, on the screen in front of their { 480}painful eyes over. It was an excited love and murder story that they saw, reeling off silently at the court of an oriental despot, chased events full of splendor and nakedness, full of lust for rulers and religious fury of submissiveness, full of cruelty, desire, deadly lust and of lingering vividness when to examine the musculature of hangman's arms - in short, made out of sympathetic familiarity with the secret desires of the onlooking international civilization. Settembrini, as a man of judgment, should have sharply denied the anti-human performance and, with straight and classic irony, should have castigated the misuse of technology to enliven such inhuman ideas, Hans Castorp thought to himself and whispered the same thing to his cousin. Frau Stoehr, on the other hand, who was also present and was sitting not far from the three, seemed completely devoted; her red, uneducated face was contorted with pleasure.","They even took Karen, one afternoon, to the Bioscope Theatre in the Platz—she loved it all so very much. The bad air they sat in was offensive to the three, used as they were to breathing the purest; it oppressed their breathing and made their heads feel heavy and dull. Life flitted across the screen before their smarting eyes: life chopped into small sections, fleeting, accelerated; a restless, jerky fluctuation of appearing and disappearing, performed to a thin accompaniment of music, which set its actual tempo to the phantasmagoria of the past, and with the narrowest of means at its command, yet managed to evoke a whole gamut of pomp and solemnity, passion, abandon, and gurgling sensuality. It was a thrilling drama of love and death they saw silently reeled off; the scenes, laid at the court of an oriental despot, galloped past, full of gorgeousness and naked bodies, thirst of power and raving religious selfabnegation; full of cruelty, appetite, and deathly lust, and slowing down to give a full view of the muscular development of the executioner’s arms. Constructed, in short, to cater to the innermost desires of an onlooking international civilization. Settembrini, as critic, Hans Castorp thought, and whispered as much to his cousin, would doubtless have sharply characterized what they saw as repugnant to a humanistic sense, and have scarified with direct and classic irony the prostitution of technical skill to such a humanly contemptible performance. On the other hand, Frau Stöhr, who was sitting not far from our three friends, seemed utterly absorbed; her ignorant red face was twisted into an expression of the hugest enjoyment.","They even took Karen Karstedt to the Bioscope Theater in Platz one afternoon, because that was something she truly enjoyed. Being used to only the purest air, they felt ill at ease in the bad air that weighed heavily in their lungs and clouded their minds in a murky fog, while up ahead on the screen life flickered before their smarting eyes—all sorts of life, chopped up in hurried, diverting scraps that leapt into fidgety action, lingered, and twitched out of sight in alarm, to the accompaniment of trivial music, which offered present rhythms to match vanishing phantoms from the past and which despite limited means ran the gamut of solemnity, pomposity, passion, savagery, and cooing sensuality. They watched as a rousing tale of love and murder in the court of an Oriental potentate unrolled silently before them; scene after opulent scene sped past, full of naked bodies, despotic lust, and abject servility blind in its zeal, full of cruelty, prurience, and fatal desire—and then suddenly the film slowed to linger revealingly on the muscular arm of an executioner. In short, it had been produced with a sympathetic understanding of its international audience and catered to that civilization’s secret wishes. Settembrini, as a man who formed opinions, would surely have denounced this exhibition as a denigration of humanity, and with honest, classical irony would have castigated the misuse of technology that made such cynical presentations possible—or so Hans Castorp thought, and whispered as much to his cousin. Frau Stöhr, however, who happened to be sitting not all that far from the trio, had apparently abandoned herself to the film; her red, uneducated face was contorted with pleasure."
"{80}»Womit?« fragte Hans Castorp. Er war außerordentlich erregt und wußte nicht recht in welchem Sinne. Er schwankte zwischen Lachen und Weinen, als er hinzufügte: »Du kannst nicht verlangen, daß ich euer Rotwelsch verstehe.«","{80}""With what?"" asked Hans Castorp. He was extraordinarily agitated and was not quite sure in what sense. He vacillated between laughing and crying as he added, ""You can't ask me to understand your rascal.""","“With her what?” Hans Castorp demanded. He felt wrought up, without knowing why. His voice was between laughter and tears as he added: “You can’t expect me to understand your lingo.”","“With her what?” Hans Castorp asked. He was terribly agitated, but he didn’t quite know in what sense. Wavering between laughter and tears, he added, “You can’t expect me to understand your jargon.”"
"»Ich beliebte«, sagte der Italiener und schluckte hinunter, »– ich beliebe mich dahin auszudrücken, daß ich entschlossen bin, Sie daran zu hindern, eine ungeschützte Jugend noch länger mit Ihren Zweideutigkeiten zu behelligen!«","""I wish,"" said the Italian, gulping, ""--I am content to say that I am determined to prevent you from bothering an unprotected youth any longer with your ambiguities!""","“I was pleased to say,” said the Italian, swallowing, “I am pleased to say, that I am resolved to prevent you from continuing to molest a defenceless youth with your equivocations.”","“I said—” the Italian replied, swallowing hard, “I am saying that I am determined to prevent you from molesting vulnerable youth any longer with your dubious ideas.”"
"Das war des Teufels. Schwere Verwünschungen lösten sich, unter Auslassung der Labiallaute, von Hans Castorps erstarrten {734}Lippen. Er stocherte sich zu seiner Orientierung um die Hütte herum und stellte fest, daß er sie von hinten wieder erreicht und also eine gute Stunde lang – seiner Schätzung nach – den reinsten und nichtsnutzigsten Unsinn getrieben hatte. Aber so ging es, so stand es im Buche. Man lief im Kreise herum, plagte sich ab, die Vorstellung der Förderlichkeit im Herzen, und beschrieb dabei irgendeinen weiten, albernen Bogen, der in sich selber zurückführte wie der vexatorische Jahreslauf. So irrte man herum, so fand man nicht heim. Hans Castorp erkannte das überlieferte Phänomen mit einer gewissen Befriedigung, wenn auch mit Schrecken, und schlug sich auf den Schenkel vor Grimm und Staunen, weil sich das Allgemeine in seinem eigentümlichen, individuellen und gegenwärtigen Fall so pünktlich ereignet hatte.","That was the devil. Heavy curses escaped from Hans Castorp's frozen lips, while the labial sounds were left out. He poked his way around the hut to find his bearings and found that he had reached it again from behind and had been doing what he thought was the purest and most useless nonsense for a good hour. But that's how it went, that's what it said in the book. One ran around in circles, toiled away, the idea of being beneficial in one's heart, and in doing so described some wide, silly arc that led back into itself, like the vexatory course of the year. That's how you wandered around, that's how you didn't find your way home. Hans Castorp recognized the reported phenomenon with a certain satisfaction, if dread, and slapped his thigh in anger and amazement that the general had occurred so punctually in its peculiar, individual, and present case.","That was the very devil. Hans Castorp gave vent to several heart-felt curses—of which his lips were too stiff to pronounce the labials. He examined the hut, to get his bearings, and came to the conclusion that he had approached it from the same direction as before—namely, from the rear; and therefore, what he had accomplished for the past hour—as he reckoned it—had been sheer waste of time and effort. But there it was, just as the books said. You went in a circle, gave yourself endless trouble under the delusion that you were accomplishing something, and all the time you were simply describing some great silly arc that would turn back to where it had its beginning, like the riddling year itself. You wandered about, without getting home. Hans Castorp recognized the traditional phenomenon with a certain grim satisfaction—and even slapped his thigh in astonishment at this punctual general law fulfilling itself in his particular case.","What a hell of a state of affairs! From Hans Castorp’s frozen lips came formidable curses, though with the labial sounds omitted. In order to get his bearings, he stomped his way around the hut and determined that he had arrived at the back end of it after a good hour—or so he estimated—of pure, futile folly. But that’s what the books said would happen. You ran around in a circle, toiling onward, with the feeling in your heart of doing something useful, when in fact you were tracing a wide, foolish arc that led back on itself, just as the teasing year came full circle. And so you wandered around and never found your way home. Hans Castorp took a certain satisfaction in recognizing the standard phenomenon, though it frightened him, too, and he slapped his thighs in rage and astonishment that something so universal had arrived right on schedule even in his own unique, individual situation."
"»Falsch. Geben Sie den Individuen substantiellen Charakter, denken Sie das Wesen der Dinge aus dem Allgemeinen fort in die Einzelerscheinung, wie Thomas und Bonaventura es als Aristoteliker taten, so haben Sie die Welt aus jeder Einheit mit der höchsten Idee gelöst, sie ist außergöttlich und Gott transzendent. Das ist klassisches Mittelalter, mein Herr.«","""Not correct. Give substantial character to individuals, think the essence of things away from the general into the particular, as Thomas and Bonaventure did as Aristotelians, and you have detached the world from any unity with the supreme idea, it is extra-divine and God-transcendent . This is classic Middle Ages, sir.”","“Wrong. When you postulate independent being for individuals, when you transfer the essence of things from the universal to the particular phenomenon, which Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventura, as good Aristotelians, did, then you destroy all unity between the world and the Highest Idea; you place the world outside of God and make God transcendent. That, my dear sir, is classic mediævalism.”","“False. If you posit substantial character in the individual, that is, if you transfer the essence of things from the universal to the particular, as Thomas and Bonaventura did, being true Aristotelians, you have then removed the world from its unity with the highest idea, it becomes something outside God, and so God becomes transcendent. That is classic medievalism, my dear sir.”"

"Hier schwieg Herr Settembrini. Er blieb bei dieser Allgemeinheit stehen und endete auf das bestimmteste. Es war ihm Ernst; nicht unterhaltungsweise hatte er geredet, hatte es verschmäht, seinem Partner Gelegenheit zur Anknüpfung und Gegenrede zu bieten, sondern am Ende seiner Aufstellungen die Stimme sinken lassen und einen Punkt gemacht. Er saß geschlossenen Mundes, die gekreuzten Hände im Schoß, ein Bein in der karierten Hose über das andere geschlagen, und wippte nur leicht mit dem in der Luft schwebenden Fuß, den er streng betrachtete.","Here Mr. Settembrini was silent. He stopped short at this generality and ended in the most definite way. He was serious; He hadn't talked for amusement, had scorned to offer his partner an opportunity to start things up and counter-speech, but at the end of his statements he had dropped his voice and made a point. He sat with his mouth closed, his hands crossed in his lap, one leg in his plaid trousers crossed over the other, and only slightly tapping his foot, which was floating in the air, which he regarded sternly.","Herr Settembrini left off speaking. He finished with this generalization, and made it the definite period of his discourse. He had spoken in a very serious vein and by no means with conversational intent; he even refrained from giving Hans Castorp the opportunity for a rejoinder; but simply dropped his voice at this point and concluded his remarks. He sat now with his lips closed, his hands folded in his lap, one leg in its check trouser flung over the other, slightly swinging the foot, which he regarded with an austere expression.","Herr Settembrini said no more. He had come to a halt at a generality, but had done so most definitively. He was very serious—he had not spoken in a conversational tone, had refused to allow Hans Castorp any opportunity to pick up the thread or contradict him, and had lowered his voice decisively to mark the end of his statement. He sat there with his mouth closed, his hands folded in his lap, one check-trousered leg crossed over the other, and he gazed sternly at his foot swinging gently in the air."

"»Halt!« sprach Peeperkorn, immer noch abgewandt, aber mit einer Gebärde der flachen Hand gegen seinen Unterredner. »Sollte es nicht gemein sein, daß wir so über sie sprechen?«","'Halt!' said Peeperkorn, still averted, but making a gesture of the palm of his hand towards his interlocutor. ""Shouldn't it be mean for us to talk about her like that?""","“Stop!” Peeperkorn said, still turned away, but with a gesture of the palm toward his interlocutor. “Is it not rather—common—of us to talk about her?”","“Stop!” Peeperkorn said, still looking away, but gesturing with the palm of his hand to restrain his visitor. “Isn’t it rather shabby of us to speak about her this way?”"
"Das Mittagessen war sowohl meisterhaft zubereitet wie auch im höchsten Grade ausgiebig. Die nahrhafte Suppe eingerechnet, bestand es aus nicht weniger als sechs Gängen. Dem Fisch folgte ein gediegenes Fleischgericht mit Beilagen, hierauf eine besondere Gemüseplatte, gebratenes Geflügel dann, eine Mehlspeise, die jener von gestern abend an Schmackhaftigkeit nicht nachstand, und endlich Käse und Obst. Jede Schüssel ward zweimal gereicht – und nicht vergebens. Man füllte die Teller und aß an den sieben Tischen, – ein Löwenappetit herrschte im Gewölbe, ein Heißhunger, dem zuzusehen wohl {118}ein Vergnügen gewesen wäre, wenn er nicht gleichzeitig auf irgendeine Weise unheimlich, ja abscheulich gewirkt hätte. Nicht nur die Munteren legten ihn an den Tag, die schwatzten und einander mit Brotkügelchen warfen, nein, auch die Stillen und Finsteren, die in den Pausen den Kopf in die Hände stützten und starrten. Ein halbwüchsiger Mensch am Nebentisch links, ein Schuljunge seinen Jahren nach, mit zu kurzen Ärmeln und dicken, kreisrunden Brillengläsern, schnitt alles, was er sich auf den Teller häufte, im voraus zu einem Brei und Gemengsel zusammen; dann beugte er sich darüber und schlang, indem er zuweilen mit der Serviette hinter die Brille fuhr, um sich die Augen zu wischen, – man wußte nicht, was da zu trocknen war, ob Schweiß oder Tränen.","The luncheon was both expertly prepared and plentiful in the highest degree. Including the nourishing soup, it consisted of no less than six courses. The fish was followed by a solid meat dish with side dishes, then a special vegetable platter, then roast poultry, a pastry that was just as tasty as last night's, and finally cheese and fruit. Each bowl was served twice - and not in vain. People filled the plates and ate at the seven tables - a lion's appetite reigned in the vault, a ravenous hunger that would have been a pleasure to watch if it hadn't at the same time had an uncanny, even abominable effect in some way. Not only did the lively ones, who chattered and threw bread balls at each other, show it, no, also the quiet and gloomy ones, who put their heads on their hands and stared during the breaks. A teenage boy at the next table on the left, a schoolboy his years old, with sleeves that were too short and thick, round glasses, cut everything he piled up on the plate in advance into a pulp and mess; then he bent over it and snuggled, occasionally running his serviette behind his glasses to wipe his eyes—you didn't know what was there to dry, whether it was sweat or tears.","The meal was as faultlessly prepared as it was abundant. Counting the hearty soup, it consisted of no less than six courses. After the fish followed an excellent meat dish, with garnishings, then a separate vegetable course, then roast fowl, a pudding, not inferior to yesterday evening’s, and lastly cheese and fruit. Each dish was handed twice and not in vain. At all seven tables they filled their plates and ate: they ate like wolves; they displayed a voracity which would have been a pleasure to see, had there not been something else about it, an effect almost uncanny, not to say repulsive. It was not only the light-hearted who thus laced into the food—those who chattered as they ate and threw pellets of bread at each other. No, the same appetite was evinced by the silent, gloomy ones as well, those who in the pauses between courses leaned their heads on their hands and stared before them. A half-grown youth at the next table on the left, by his years a schoolboy, with his wrists coming out of his jacket sleeves, and thick, round eye-glasses, cut all the heaped-up food on his plate into a sort of mash, then bent over and gulped it down; he reached with his serviette behind his glasses now and then and dried his eyes—whether it was sweat or tears he dried one could not tell.","The dinner was as splendidly prepared as it was lavish. Including the nourishing soup, it consisted of no fewer than six courses. The fish was followed by a superb roast with vegetables, which was followed by a salad, then roast fowl, a dumpling dessert in no way inferior to the one Hans had eaten the night before, and, finally, cheese and fruit. Each item was offered twice—and not without good effect. People filled their plates at all seven tables—they ate with the appetites of lions here in these vaulted spaces. Theirs was a hot hunger that it would have been a joy to observe, if its effect had not at the same time seemed somehow eerie, even repulsive. Not only the more lively among them displayed such hunger as they chatted and pelted one another with little pills of bread—no, but also the silent, gloomy ones, who between courses would put their heads in their hands and stare into space. At the next table on their left was an adolescent boy—still of school age, to judge by his appearance—whose coat sleeves were too short, and who wore thick, circular glasses; he chopped up everything heaped on his plate until it was a pasty hodgepodge, then bent over it and wolfed it down, now and then pushing his napkin up behind his glasses to dry his eyes—it was unclear whether this was to wipe away sweat or tears."
"»Ja, Castorp,« sagte er – und es geschah zum erstenmal, daß er {275}den jungen Mann einfach mit Nachnamen nannte –, »die Sache verhält sich so praeter-propter, wie ich sie mir schon immer gedacht hatte. Ich habe Sie auf dem Strich gehabt, Castorp, nun kann ichs Ihnen ja sagen, – von vornherein, schon seit ich zuerst die unverdiente Auszeichnung hatte, Sie kennenzulernen, – und ziemlich sicher vermutet, daß Sie im stillen ein Hiesiger wären und das auch noch einsehen würden, wie schon so mancher, der zum Spaß hier heraufkam und sich mit erhobener Nase umsah und eines Tages erfuhr, daß er gut täte – und nicht bloß ›gut täte‹, bitte mich wohl zu verstehen – hier ganz ohne unbeteiligte Neugiersallüre eine etwas ausgiebigere Station zu machen.«","""Yes, Castorp,"" he said - and it was the first time that he simply called the young man by his last name - ""the matter is as praeter-propter as I had always thought it would be. I've had you on the line, Castorp, now I can tell you - right from the start, ever since I first had the undeserved distinction of knowing you - and pretty sure suspected that you were secretly a local and that too would see, as did many a man who came up here for fun and looked around with his nose up and one day found that he was doing well - and not just 'doing well', please understand me - here, without any air of disinterested curiosity, a something to make a more extensive stop.«","“Yes, Castorp,” he said—this was the first time he had called the young man simply by his last name—“the thing works out præter propter as I thought it would. I had my suspicions—I can tell you now— from the first day I had the undeserved honour of making your acquaintance; I made a pretty shrewd guess that you were one of us and that you would find it out, like many another who has come up here on a lark and gone about with his nose in the air, only to discover, one fine day, that it would be as well for him—and not only as well, mark that—to make a more extended stay, quite without reference to the beauties of the scenery.”","“Yes, Castorp,” he said—and this was the first time he had ever addressed the young man simply by his last name—“just as I thought, the situation looks rather praeter-propter. I can admit to you now that I haven’t liked your looks from the start, not since the first time I had the undeserved honor of making your acquaintance—and was pretty sure of my guess that you were secretly one of the locals, and would finally come to appreciate the fact yourself, as has many a man before you, who came up here just for the fun of it, looked around with his nose in the air, and one fine day discovered he would do well—indeed, mark my words, would do more than well—to remain on here, for reasons having nothing to do with the seductions of mere curiosity, for a rather more extended stay.”"

"»Wahrhaftig?« fragte Dr. Krokowski, indem er seinen Kopf wie neckend schräg vorwärts stieß und sein Lächeln verstärkte … »Aber dann sind Sie eine höchst studierenswerte Erscheinung!

Was für ein Examen haben Sie abgelegt, wenn die Frage erlaubt ist?«","""Really?"" asked Dr. Krokowski, jerking his head forward as if teasingly and increasing his smile... ""But then you're a highly studyable phenomenon! I've never met a completely healthy person. What kind of exam did you take, if the question may be asked?”","“Really?” asked Krokowski, putting his head teasingly on one side. His smile grew broader. “Then you are a phenomenon worthy of study. I, for one, have never in my life come across a perfectly healthy human being. What were the examinations you have just passed, if I may ask?”","“You don’t say!” Dr. Krokowski replied, thrusting his head forward at a derisive slant and smiling more broadly. “In that case you are a phenomenon of greatest medical interest. You see, I’ve never met a perfectly healthy person before. And what kind of exams were those, if you’ll pardon the question?”"

"Es waren Stunden, mehr als zwei, wir sagen es gleich, eine kurze Unterbrechung der nun anhebenden »Arbeit« Holgers oder eigentlich des Jungfräuleins Elly mit eingerechnet, – dieser Arbeit, die sich entsetzlich in die Länge zog, so daß man endlich an einem Ergebnis zu verzagen allgemein im Begriffe war und außerdem aus purem Mitleid oft genug sich versucht fühlte, sie verzichtend abzukürzen, denn sie schien wirklich erbarmungswürdig schwer und über die zarten Kräfte zu gehen, denen sie auferlegt war. Wir Männer, wenn wir dem Menschlichen nicht ausweichen, kennen aus einer bestimmten Lebenslage dies unerträgliche Erbarmen, das lächerlicherweise von niemandem angenommen wird und wahrscheinlich gar nicht am Platze ist, dies empörte »Genug!«, das sich unserer Brust entringen will, obgleich »es« nicht genug sein will und darf und so oder so zu Ende geführt werden muß. Man versteht schon, daß wir von unserer Gatten- und Vaterschaft sprechen, vom Akt der Geburt, dem Ellys Ringen tatsächlich so unzweideutig und unverwechselbar glich, daß auch derjenige ihn wiedererkennen mußte, der ihn noch gar nicht kannte, wie der junge Hans Castorp, welcher also, da auch er dem Leben nicht ausgewichen war, diesen Akt voll organischer Mystik in solcher Gestalt kennen lernte, – in was für einer Gestalt! Und zu welchem Behufe! Und unter welchen Umständen! Unmöglich konnte man sie anders als skandalös bezeichnen, die Merkmale und Einzelheiten dieser animierten Wochenstube im Rotlicht, sowohl was die jungfräuliche Person der Wöchnerin in ihrem fließenden Schlafrock und mit ihren bloßen Ärmchen, wie auch was die weiteren Verhältnisse, die unaufhörliche leichtlebige Grammophon-Musik, das künstliche Geschwätz betraf, das der Halbkreis auf Befehl zu unterhalten suchte, die Zurufe fröhlich aufmunternder Art, die aus ihm immerfort an die {1027}Kämpfende ergingen: »Hallo, Holger! Mut! Es wird schon! Nicht nachlassen, Holger, und immer heraus damit, so wirst du’s schaffen!« Und keineswegs nehmen wir hier die Person und Lage des »Gatten« aus – wenn wir Hans Castorp, der ja den Wunsch getan, als den zugehörigen Gatten betrachten dürfen – des Gatten also, der die Knie der »Mutter« zwischen den seinen, ihre Hände in seinen hielt: diese Händchen, die so naß waren, wie der kleinen Leila ihre einst gewesen, so daß er beständig seinen Zugriff erneuern mußte, damit sie ihm nicht entglitten.","It was hours, more than two, let's say it straight away, including a short interruption of the now beginning ""work"" of Holger, or actually of the virgin Elly - this work, which dragged on terribly, so that one finally got a result was about to give up in general and, moreover, out of sheer pity often enough felt tempted to abbreviate it, for it really seemed pitifully difficult and to go beyond the delicate forces on which it was imposed. We men, if we don't avoid what is human, know from a certain situation in life that unbearable pity that, ridiculously, nobody accepts and is probably out of place, that outraged ""Enough!"" that tries to wriggle out of our breasts, although ""it « does not want to and must not be enough and must be brought to an end one way or another. You can understand that we are talking about our marriage and fatherhood, about the act of birth, which Elly's wrestling actually resembled so unequivocally and unmistakably that even those who didn't know him at all, like young Hans Castorp, who so, since he too had not avoided life, got to know this act full of organic mysticism in such a form – in what a form! And for what purpose! And under what circumstances! It was impossible to describe anything else as scandalous, the features and details of this animated nursery in the red light, both in terms of the virginal person of the woman in her flowing dressing gown and with her little bare arms, as well as in terms of the other circumstances, the incessant easy-going gramophone music, concerned the artificial gossip that the semicircle tried to keep up on command, the calls of a cheery, encouraging kind that constantly emanated from him to the {1027}combatants: ""Hello, Holger! Courage! It will be! Don't let up, Holger, and keep banging on about it, and you'll make it!' And by no means are we excluding the person and situation of the 'husband' here - if we may regard Hans Castorp, who has done the wish, as the associated husband - of Husband, then, who held ""mother's"" knees between his, her hands in his: those little hands, which were as wet as little Leila's once were, so that he had to constantly renew his grip so that they didn't slip from him .","They were hours—more than two of them, to be explicit, counting in a brief intermission in the efforts on Holger’s part which now began, or rather, on the girl Elly’s—of work so hard and so prolonged that they were all toward the end inclined to be fainthearted and despair of any result; out of pure pity, too, tempted to resign an attempt which seemed pitilessly hard, and beyond the delicate strength of her upon whom it was laid. We men, if we do not shirk our humanity, are familiar with an hour of life when we know this almost intolerable pity, which, absurdly enough no one else can feel, this rebellious “Enough, no more!” which is wrung from us, though it is not enough, and cannot or will not be enough, until it comes somehow or other to its appointed end. The reader knows we speak of our husband-and fatherhood, of the act of birth, which Elly’s wrestling did so unmistakably resemble that even he must recognize it who had never passed through this experience, even our young Hans Castorp; who, not having shirked life, now came to know, in such a guise, this act, so full of organic mysticism. In what a guise! To what an end! Under what circumstances! One could not regard as anything less than scandalous the sights and sounds in this red-lighted lying-in chamber, the maidenly form of the pregnant one, barearmed, in flowing night-robe; and then by contrast the ceaseless and senseless gramophone music, the forced conversation which the circle kept up at command, the cries of encouragement they ever and anon directed at the struggling one: “Hullo, Holger! Courage, man! It’s coming, just keep it up, let it come, that’s the way!” Nor do we except the person and situation of the “husband”—if we may regard in that light our young friend, who had indeed formed such a wish—sitting there, with the knees of the little “mother” between his own, holding in his her hands, which were as wet as once little Leila’s, so that he had constantly to be renewing his hold, not to let them slip.","These were hours—more than two, we admit it straight out, including a brief pause in the “labor” that now began for Holger, or actually, for virginal Miss Elly —hours of labor that went on so dreadfully long that they all were close to despairing of any result, and indeed were often tempted out of pure pity to forgo the experience and cut this short, for it truly seemed unmercifully hard work, beyond the fragile strength of her of whom it was demanded. We men, if we do not shirk our own humanity, are aware of a certain moment in life when we feel this same unbearable pity—to which, absurd as it seems, no one responds, presumably because it is quite out of place—when we wrestle with a suppressed, outraged “Enough!” although we know it is not yet enough, cannot, dare not, be enough, and must go on and end one way or the other. It should be clear that we are speaking about a husband’s, a father’s pity, about the act of birth, which Elly’s travails indeed so manifestly, so unmistakably resembled that even someone unfamiliar with birth would have had to have recognized it—someone like our young Hans Castorp, who, having never shirked life, now learned about that act of organic mysticism in this form. And what a form it was! And for what a purpose! And under what circumstances! Scandalous is the only word for the specific details of this animated maternity ward bathed in reddish light—from the virginal young lady in labor, with her flowing nightgown and frail, bare arms, to the incessant light favorites coming from the gramophone; to the artificial chatter that the semicircle attempted to keep going on doctor’s orders; to the constant cheery cries of encouragement to the struggling girl—“Hello, Holger! Courage! Won’t be long! Don’t give up, Holger, just let it come, you’ll do it!” And we are certainly not exempting from the scandal the person and circumstance of the “husband,” either—if we may regard Hans Castorp as the husband in this case, since it had been his wish—the husband, then, who held the knees of the “mother” clamped between his own, her hands in his, hands as wet as little Leila’s once had been, so that he constantly had to get a new grip to keep them from slipping away."
"Und siehe, das gute Glas schlug Ja. Wirklich lag etwas Gutmütig-Versöhnliches darin, wie es dies tat. Und dann begann spirit Holger zu dichten und dichtete umständlich, ausführlich und ohne Besinnen, wer weiß wie lange, – es schien, als werde er überhaupt nicht wieder zum Schweigen zu bringen sein! Es war ein durch und durch überraschendes Gedicht, das er bauchrednerisch vorbrachte, während die Umsitzenden es bewundernd mit sprachen, eine magische Dingheit, uferlos, wie das Meer, von dem es vornehmlich handelte, – Seemist in langen Haufen entlang des schmalen Strandes der weit geschwungenen Bucht des Insellandes mit steiler Dünenküste. O seht, wie sterbend grün die ungeheure Weite ins Ewige verschwebt, wo unter breiten Nebelschleierstreifen in trübem Karmesin und milchig-weichem Scheinen die Sommersonne den Untergang verzögert! Kein Mund vermöchte zu sagen, {1006}wann und wie des Wassers silbrig regsamer Widerglanz in lauter Perlmutterschimmer sich wandelte, in ein unnennbar Farbenspiel blaß-bunt-opalenen Mondsteinglanzes, das alles überzieht … Ach, heimlich, wie er entstanden, erstarb der stille Zauber. Das Meer entschlief. Jedoch die sanften Spuren des Sonnenabschieds bleiben dort drüben und draußen. Es wird nicht dunkel bis in die tiefe Nacht. Ein halbes Geisterlicht waltet im Kiefernwalde der Dünenhöhe und läßt den bleichen Sand des Grundes wie Schnee erscheinen. Täuschender Winterwald im Schweigen, knackend durchstreift von einer Eule schwerem Flug! Sei unser Aufenthalt zu dieser Stunde! So weich der Tritt, so hoch und mild die Nacht! Und langsam atmet dort unten tief das Meer und flüstert gedehnt im Traum. Verlangt dich’s, es wiederzusehen? So tritt hervor zum fahlen Gletschergehänge der Düne und steige vollends im Weichen empor, das kühl in deine Schuhe rinnt. Hart buschig fällt das Land und steil zum steinigen Strande ab, und immer geistern noch am Rande der vergehenden Weite die Reste des Tages … Laß dich hier oben im Sande nieder! Wie ist er todeskühl, wie mehlig-seidenweich! Er fließt dir aus der geschlossenen Hand in farblos-dünnem Strahl und bildet ein zartes Hügelchen bei sich im Grunde. Erkennst du dies feine Rinnen? Es ist das lautlos schmale Strömen durch die Enge des Stundenglases, des ernsten, gebrechlichen Geräts, das das Gehäuse des Klausners schmückt. Ein aufgeschlagen Buch, ein Totenschädel und im Gestell, im leicht gefügten Rahmen das dünne Doppelhohlgebläse, darin ein wenig Sand, dem Ewigen entnommen, als Zeit sein heimlich und heilig beängstend Wesen treibt …","And behold, the good glass struck Yes. There was really something good-naturedly forgiving in the way it did so. And then spirit Holger began to write poetry and wrote it laboriously, extensively and without thinking for who knows how long - it seemed as if he could never be silenced again! It was a thoroughly astonishing poem, which he ventriloquitally uttered while those around him joined in admiration, a magical thingness, shoreless, like the sea of which it was principally about, - sea dung in long heaps along the narrow beach of the wide sweeping Bay of the island country with steep dune coast. O see how dying green the immense expanse floats away into eternity, where under broad veils of mist in cloudy crimson and milky-soft shine the summer sun delays the setting! No mouth could say {1006}when and how the water's lively silvery reflection changed into a sheer mother-of-pearl shimmer, into an unnameable play of colors of pale, colorful, opal moonstone luster that covers everything ... Ah, secretly, as it arose, the silent magic died . The sea fell asleep. However, the soft traces of the sun parting remain over there and outside. It doesn't get dark until late at night. A half spirit light reigns in the pine forest of the dunes and makes the pale sand of the ground appear like snow. Deceptive winter forest in silence, roamed crackling by an owl heavy flight! Be our abode at this hour! So soft the step, so high and mild the night! And slowly down there the sea breathes deeply and whispers slowly in the dream. Do you want to see it again? So step forward to the pale glacial slopes of the dunes and climb up completely in the softness that runs coolly into your shoes. The land drops off hard, bushy and steep to the stony beach, and the remains of the day still haunt the edge of the passing expanse... Let yourself down here in the sand! How deadly cold it is, how floury and silky soft! It flows out of your closed hand in a colourless, thin stream and basically forms a gentle hillock on you. Do you recognize these fine grooves? It is the silent, narrow stream through the confines of the hourglass, the grave, frail device that adorns the hermit's case. An open book, a skull and in the frame, in the slightly joined frame, the thin double hollow fan, in it a little sand, taken from the eternal, as time drives its secret and holy frightening being ...","And lo, the good glass yielded and said yes! Truly there was something placable and good-humoured about the way it tapped. And then Holger the spirit began to poetize, and kept it up, copiously, circumstantially, without pausing for thought, for dear knows how long. It seemed impossible to stop him. And what a surprising poem it was, this ventriloquistic effort, delivered to the admiration of the circle—stuff of magic, and shoreless as the sea of which it largely dealt. Sea-wrack in heaps and bands along the narrow strand of the broad-flung bay; an islanded coast, girt by steep, cliffy dunes. Ah, see the dim green distance faint and die into eternity, while beneath broad veils of mist in dull carmine and milky radiance the summer sun delays to sink! No word can utter how and when the watery mirror turned from silver into untold changeful colour-play, to bright or pale, to spreading, opaline and moonstone gleams—or how, mysteriously as it came, the voiceless magic died away. The sea slumbered. Yet the last traces of the sunset linger above and beyond. Until deep in the night it has not grown dark: a ghostly twilight reigns in the pine forests on the downs, bleaching the sand until it looks like snow. A simulated winter forest all in silence, save where an owl wings rustling flight. Let us stray here at this hour—so soft the sand beneath our tread, so sublime, so mild the night! Far beneath us the sea respires slowly, and murmurs a long whispering in its dream. Does it crave thee to see it again? Step forth to the sallow, glacierlike cliffs of the dunes, and climb quite up into the softness, that runs coolly into thy shoes. The land falls harsh and bushy steeply down to the pebbly shore, and still the last parting remnants of the day haunt the edge of the vanishing sky. Lie down here in the sand! How cool as death it is, how soft as silk, as flour! It flows in a colourless, thin stream from thy hand and makes a dainty little mound beside thee. Dost thou recognize it, this tiny flowing? It is the soundless, tiny stream through the hour-glass, that solemn, fragile toy that adorns the hermit’s hut. An open book, a skull, and in its slender frame the double glass, holding a little sand, taken from eternity, to prolong here, as time, its troubling, solemn, mysterious essence. . .","And look there, the good glass knocked once—“yes.” There was really something kindhearted and forgiving in the way it did it. And then Holger the spirit began to recite poetry without hesitation, at great length and in immense detail, for who knew how long—it seemed as if they would never be able to silence him again. It was a thoroughly surprising poem that he offered in ventriloquist fashion, while those sitting around recited it aloud in admiration, a magical bit of reality, as limitless as the sea, which was its central theme. —Driftwood and tang flung in heaps along the narrow shore extending round the great arc of bay that rims the island’s steep-duned coast. Oh look, its vast expanse is hovering, melting, dying green into eternity, where beneath broad misty veils of murky crimson and milk-soft sheen, the summer sun delays its setting. No lips can tell when or how that nimble silver mirror turned pure mother-of-pearl, became a play of colors beyond all naming, a pale, bright, opal luster of moonstone spread everywhere. Ah, as secretly as it came, the silent magic died. The sea passed into sleep. And yet soft traces of the sun’s farewell linger beyond and above. Darkness does not fall till deep into the night. A phantom glow holds sway in piny woods along the crest of dunes and turns the pallid sand to snow. Illusive winter woods in silence, broken by the snap of heavy wings, an owl in flight. Stay and be our place of rest this hour. So soft each step, so high and mild the night. And far below, the sea is breathing in slow, protracted whispers as it dreams. Do you long to see it again? Then step up to the edge of these ashen glacial cliffs of dunes and climb, immerse yourself in softness that seeps cool into your shoes. The land falls steep with underbrush down to the rocky shore, and still the phantom scraps of day dart along the rim of that vanishing expanse. Lie down up here in the sand. How cool like death it feels, how soft like silk, like flour. You clench your hand, and it flows, a thin, colorless stream, to form a delicate mound beside you. Do you know that fine trickle? It is the soundless, slender rush through the straits of the hourglass, the stern and fragile device that adorns the hermit’s cell. An open book, a skull, and in its light constructed frame, the double hollow of frail glass, and inside it, sand extracted from eternity, to tumble here as time in holy, terrifying stealth . . ."

"»Ja, Strenge, das ist nun gerade gar nicht Ihre Sache. Da ist Ihr Vetter ein anderer Kerl, von anderem Schrot und Korn. Der weiß Bescheid. Der weiß schweigend Bescheid, verstehen Sie mich? Der hängt sich den Leuten nicht an die Rockschöße, um sich blauen Dunst und Harmlosigkeit vormachen zu lassen. Der wußte, was er tat und was er daransetzte, und ist ein Mannsbild, das sich auf Haltung versteht und aufs Maulhalten, was eine männliche Kunst ist, aber leider nicht die Sache von solchen bipedischen Annehmlichkeiten wie Sie.

Understand? He doesn’t go about hanging on to people’s coat-tails and asking them to help him pull the wool over his eyes! He knows what he did, and what he risked, and he is the kind to bite his teeth together on it. That’s the kind of thing a man, that is a man, can do: unfortunately it isn’t in the line of a fascinating biped like yourself. But I warn you, Castorp, if you are going to give way to your civilian feelings and set up a howl, I’ll simply show you the door. What we need now is a man. You understand?”","“Yes, hard on you—and that’s not up your alley. Your cousin is quite a different sort of fellow, a man cut from different cloth. He knows what’s what. He knows and says nothing, do you understand? He doesn’t go around tugging on people’s sleeves, asking to be hoodwinked with harmlessness. He knew what he was doing, what he was risking, and that’s a man for you, who knows how to keep a stiff upper lip, to keep his mouth shut, which is a manly art, but not the sort nice little bipeds like yourself can understand. But this much I’ll tell you, Castorp, if you start making a scene, raise a hue and cry and give your civilian feelings free rein , I’ll hand you your walking papers.

"»Warum nicht. Man könnte noch etwas beieinander bleiben, vielleicht ein Spielchen machen und eine Flasche Wein trinken. Was stehen Sie?« wandte sie sich an Hans Castorp. »Regen Sie sich!

"Das alles war unernst; es kam Hans Castorps geistigen Bedürfnissen sehr wenig entgegen. Ein schreckhafter Zwischenfall, der sich um diese Zeit während einer Mahlzeit ereignete, machte besonderen Eindruck auf den jungen Mann. Ein noch neuer Patient, der Lehrer Popów, ein magerer und stiller Mensch, der mit seiner ebenfalls mageren und stillen Braut am Guten Russentisch Platz gefunden hatte, erwies sich, da eben das Essen in vollem Gange war, als epileptisch, indem er einen krassen Anfall dieser Art erlitt, mit jenem Schrei, dessen dämonischer und außermenschlicher Charakter oft geschildert worden ist, zu Boden stürzte und neben seinem Stuhle unter den scheußlichsten Verrenkungen mit Armen und Beinen um sich schlug. Erschwerend wirkte, daß es ein Fischgericht war, das eben gereicht worden, so daß zu befürchten stand, Popów möchte in seiner Krampfverzückung an einer Gräte Schaden nehmen. Der Aufruhr war unbeschreiblich. Die Damen, Frau {454}Stöhr voran, aber ohne daß etwa die Frauen Salomon, Redisch, Hessenfeld, Magnus, Iltis, Levi und wie sie nun heißen mochten, ihr etwas nachgegeben hätten, wurden von den verschiedensten Zuständen betreten, so daß einige es Herrn Popów fast gleichtaten. Ihre Schreie gellten. Man sah nichts als zugekrampfte Augen, offene Münder und verdrehte Oberkörper. Eine einzelne gab stiller Ohnmacht den Vorzug. Erstickungsanfälle, da jedermann von dem wilden Ereignis im Kauen und Schlucken überrascht worden war, spielten sich ab. Ein Teil der Tischgesellschaft suchte durch die verfügbaren Ausgänge das Weite, auch durch die Verandatüren, obgleich es draußen sehr naßkalt war. Es trug aber der ganze Vorfall ein eigentümliches und außer seiner Entsetzlichkeit auch anstößiges Tonzeichen, und zwar vermöge einer allgemein sich aufdrängenden Ideenverbindung, die an den jüngsten Vortrag Dr. Krokowskis anknüpfte. Der Analytiker war nämlich bei seinen Ausführungen über die Liebe als krankheitbildende Macht gerade am letzten Montag auf die Fallsucht zu reden gekommen und hatte dies Leiden, worin die Menschheit in voranalytischen Zeiten abwechselnd eine heilige, ja prophetische Heimsuchung und eine Teufelsbesessenheit gesehen, mit halb poetischen, halb unerbittlich wissenschaftlichen Worten als Äquivalent der Liebe und Orgasmus des Gehirns angesprochen, kurz, es in einem solchen Sinne verdächtigt, daß seine Zuhörer die Aufführung des Lehrers Popów, diese Illustration des Vortrags, als wüste Offenbarung und mysteriösen Skandal verstehen mußten, so daß denn auch in dem verhüllten Entfliehen der Damen eine gewisse Schamhaftigkeit sich ausdrückte. Der Hofrat selbst war bei der Mahlzeit zugegen, und er war es, der, zusammen mit der Mylendonk und einigen jungen, handfesten Tafelgenossen, den Ekstatiker, blau, schäumend, steif und verzerrt, wie er war, aus dem Saal in die Halle schaffte, wo man die Ärzte, die Oberin und anderes Personal noch längere Zeit an {455}dem Sinnlosen hantieren sah, der dann auf einer Bahre davongetragen wurde. Ganz kurze Zeit danach aber sah man Herrn Popów stillvergnügt, in Gesellschaft seiner ebenfalls stillvergnügten Braut, wieder am Guten Russentisch sitzen und, als sei nichts geschehen, sein Mittagessen beenden!","All this was not serious; it met Hans Castorp's intellectual needs very little. A frightful incident, which occurred at a meal about this time, made a special impression on the young man. A still new patient, the teacher Popów, a thin and quiet man, who had found a seat at the Good Russian Table with his equally thin and quiet bride, turned out to be epileptic while the meal was in full swing, having a blatant seizure of this kind, fell to the ground with that scream, the demonic and extra-human character of which has often been described, and beside his chair he threw his arms and legs around with the most hideous contortions. To make matters worse, it was a fish dish that had just been served, so that there was a risk that Popów, in his convulsive ecstasy, might injure himself on a bone. The uproar was indescribable. The ladies, Frau {454}Stöhr first, but without the women Salomon, Redisch, Hessenfeld, Magnus, Iltis, Levi and whatever their names might be, having given in to her, they were overcome by the most varied of states, so that some of them Almost like Mr. Popów. Their screams shrilled. One saw nothing but clenched eyes, open mouths and contorted torsos. A single one preferred quiet swooning. Attacks of choking ensued, as everyone was caught off guard by the wild chewing and swallowing event. A part of the dinner party fled through the available exits, also through the patio doors, although it was very cold and wet outside. The whole incident, however, had a peculiar tone which, in addition to its horror, was also offensive, thanks to a general connection of ideas which was reminiscent of the most recent lecture by Dr. Krokowski's. The analyst, in his remarks on love as a disease-forming power, had just come to talk about epilepsy last Monday and had this suffering, in which mankind in pre-analytic times saw alternately a holy, even prophetic visitation and a devil's possession, with semi-poetic, addressed in semi-relentingly scientific terms as the equivalent of love and brain orgasm, in short, it suspected it in such a sense that his listeners had to understand teacher Popów's performance, this illustration of the lecture, as a wild revelation and mysterious scandal, so that too a certain modesty was expressed in the veiled escape of the ladies. The Hofrat himself was present at the meal, and it was he who, together with the Mylendonk and a few young, sturdy table comrades, carried the Ecstatic, blue, foaming, stiff and distorted as he was, out of the hall into the hall. where the doctors, the matron, and other staff could be seen handling the senseless man for a long time, who was then carried away on a stretcher. A short time later, however, Mr. Popów was seen happily sitting again at the Good Russian Table in the company of his equally happily married bride, finishing his lunch as if nothing had happened!","But none of this was really serious; it could not meet Hans Castorp’s spiritual needs. A frightful occurrence, which happened at about this time, during a meal, made a profound impression upon him. Among the newer patients was a schoolmaster named Popoff, a lean and silent man, with his equally lean and silent wife. They sat together at the “good” Russian table; and one day, while the meal was in full swing, the man was seized with a violent epileptic fit, and with that oft-described demoniac unearthly shriek fell to the floor, where he lay beside his chair, striking about him with dreadfully distorted arms and legs. To make matters worse, it was a fish dish that had just been handed, and there was ground for fear that Popoff, in his spasm, might choke on a bone. The uproar was indescribable. The ladies, Frau Stöhr in the lead, with Mesdames Salomon, Redisch, Hessenfeld, Magnus, Iltis, Levi, and the rest following hard upon, were taken in a variety of ways, some of them almost as badly as Popoff. Their yells resounded. Everywhere were twitching eyelids, gaping mouths, writhing torsos. One of them elected to faint, silently. There were cases of choking, some of them having been in the act of chewing and swallowing when the excitement began. Many of the guests at the various tables fled, through any available exit, even actually seeking the open, though the weather was very cold and damp. The whole occurrence, however, took a peculiar cast, offensive even beyond the horror of it, through an association of ideas due to Dr. Krokowski’s latest lecture. In the course of his exposition of love as a power making for disease, the psycho-analyst had touched upon the “falling sickness.” This affliction, which, in pre-analytic times, he said, men had by turns interpreted as a holy, even a prophetic visitation, and as a devilish possession, he went on to treat of, half poetically, half in ruthlessly scientific terminology, as the equivalent of love and an orgasm of the brain. In brief, he had cast such an equivocal light upon the disease that his hearers were bound to see, in Popoff’s seizure, an illustration of the lecture, an awful manifestation and mysterious scandal. The flight on the part of the ladies was, accordingly, a disguised expression of modesty. The Hofrat himself had been present at the meal; he, with Fräulein von Mylendonk and one or two more robust guests, carried the ecstatic from the room, blue, rigid, twisted, and foaming at the mouth as he was; they put him down in the hall, where the doctors, the Directress, and other people could be seen hovering over the unconscious man, whom they afterwards bore away on a stretcher. But a short time thereafter Herr Popoff, quite happy and serene, with his equally serene and happy wife, was to be seen sitting at the “good” Russian table, finishing his meal as though nothing had happened.","None of that was really serious; it said very little to Hans Castorp’s spiritual needs. A horrible incident at a meal one day, however, did make an impression on the young man. A new patient, a teacher named Popóv, a gaunt, silent fellow, who now sat at the Good Russian table next to his equally gaunt, silent young bride, turned out to be an epileptic and right in the middle of a meal had a violent fit, falling to the floor with that demonic, inhuman shriek we have all often heard described, and lay there next to his chair, flailing arms and legs about in the most ghastly writhings. What made matters worse was that the fish course had just been served, and it was feared that Popóv might choke on a bone. The uproar was indescribable. The ladies, with Frau Stöhr in the vanguard—though Mmes. Salomon, Redisch, Hessenfeld, Magnus, Iltis, Levi, et al. hardly took second place to her—fell victim to a whole variety of “conditions,” with several of them coming close to imitating Herr Popóv. Shrieks rang out—everywhere , nothing but eyes squeezed tight, mouths agape, and twisted torsos. Only one lady preferred to faint quietly. Since they had all been surprised in the middle of chewing and swallowing, choking attacks were common. Some diners made for available exits, including the doors to the veranda, although it was very damp and cold outside. The whole incident, however, took on its own unique, scandalous character, quite apart from the horror of it, primarily because most people could not help associating it with Dr. Krokowski’s most recent lecture. In his address the previous Monday (dealing, as always, with love as a force conducive to illness), the psychoanalyst had made special mention of epilepsy, which in preanalytic days had been seen variously as a holy, indeed prophetic affliction or as a sign of demonic possession, but which he described in half poetic, half ruthlessly scientific terms as the equivalent of love, an orgasm of the brain—in brief, made it sound so suspect that his audience was now forced to see Popóv’s performance as an illustration of the lecture, a dissolute revelation, a mysterious scandal. The covert flight of the ladies was therefore also an expression of a certain modesty. The director himself was present at the meal, and it was he who, together with Nurse Mylendonk and a few stalwart young diners, carried the ecstatic teacher just as he was—blue, stiff, contorted, and still foaming at the mouth—from the dining hall to the lobby, where the doctors, the head nurse, and other personnel were observed working over the unconscious man for a while, after which he was carried away on a litter. But within a very short time, Herr Popóv was seen sitting serenely beside his equally serene young wife at the Good Russian table, and he finished his midday meal as if nothing had happened."
"Das dauerte so lange, bis eine andere Geckerei zur Herrschaft gelangte und etwa das Anhäufen und unaufhörliche Verzehren von Schokolade der erdenklichsten Sorten zum guten Ton wurde. Alle Welt hatte braune Münder, und die leckersten Darbietungen der Berghofküche fanden faule und krittelnde Genießer, da die Magen mit Milka-Nut, Chocolat à la crème d’amandes, Marquis-Napolitains und goldgesprenkelten Katzenzungen gestopft und davon verstimmt waren.","This lasted until another kind of nonsense took over and, for example, the accumulation and incessant consumption of chocolate of all kinds imaginable became de rigueur. Everyone had brown mouths, and the most delicious offerings from the Berghof kitchen found lazy and quibblers, as the stomachs were stuffed with Milka-Nut, chocolate à la crème d'amandes, Marquis-Napolitains and cat's tongue sprinkled with gold and were upset by it.","Postage stamps would have their day, and give way to the next folly on the list, which might be the accumulation and endless munching of all possible brands of chocolate. Everybody’s mouth was stained brown, and the Berghof kitchen offered its most elaborate delicacies to captious and indifferent diners who had lost their appetites to Milka-nut, Chocolat à la crême d’amandes, Marquis-napolitains, and gold-besprinkled cats’ tongues.","That would continue until the next fad took over—when, for instance, the collection and incessant consumption of chocolate in every conceivable form might become the fashion. Everyone had brown lips, and the most delicious productions of the Berghof kitchens were greeted by lethargic, carping gourmets, who had already stuffed and ruined their stomachs with Milka nougats, chocolat à la crème d’amandes, Marquis napolitains, and little “cat’s tongues” sprinkled with gold."

"Am Dienstag war unser Held nun also seit einer Woche bei Denen hier oben, und so fand er denn, als er vom Morgenspaziergang zurückkehrte, in seinem Zimmer die Rechnung {200}vor, seine erste Wochenrechnung, ein reinlich ausgeführtes kaufmännisches Dokument, in einen grünlichen Umschlag verschlossen, mit illustriertem Kopf (das Berghofgebäude war bestechend abgebildet dort oben) und links seitwärts geschmückt mit einem in schmaler Kolonne angeordneten Auszuge aus dem Prospekt, worin auch der »psychischen Behandlung nach modernsten Prinzipien« in Sperrdruck Erwähnung geschah. Die kalligraphischen Aufstellungen selbst betrugen ziemlich genau 180 Franken, und zwar entfielen auf die Verpflegung nebst ärztlicher Behandlung 12 und auf das Zimmer 8 Franken für den Tag, ferner auf den Posten »Eintrittsgeld« 20 Franken und auf die Desinfektion des Zimmers 10 Franken, während kleinere Sporteln für Wäsche, Bier und den zum ersten Abendessen genossenen Wein die Summe abrundeten.","So on Tuesday our hero had been with them up here for a week, and so when he returned from the morning walk he found the bill {200} in his room, his first weekly bill, a neatly executed commercial document, in a greenish one Envelope sealed, with an illustrated head (the Berghof building was impressively depicted up there) and adorned on the left side with an excerpt from the prospectus arranged in a narrow column, in which the ""psychic treatment according to the most modern principles"" was also mentioned in block print. The calligraphic lists themselves amounted to almost exactly 180 francs, namely 12 francs for food and medical treatment and 8 francs for the room per day, as well as 20 francs for the entry fee and 10 francs for disinfecting the room, while smaller ones Sporteln for laundry, beer and the wine enjoyed at the first dinner rounded off the sum.","TUESDAY was the last day of our hero’s week up here, and accordingly he found his weekly bill in his room on his return from the morning walk. It was a clear and businesslike document, in a green envelope, with a picture of the Berghof building at the top, and extracts from the prospectus carried in a narrow column down the lefthand side of the sheet. “Psycho-analytic treatment, by the most modern methods” was called attention to by means of spaced type. The items, set down in a calligraphic hand, came to one hundred and eighty francs almost exactly: eight francs a day for his chamber, twelve for board and medical attendance, entrance fee twenty, disinfection of room ten, while small charges for laundry, beer, and the late dinner of the first evening made up the sum.","Tuesday came. Our hero had been up here for seven days now, and when he returned from his constitutional that morning, he found a bill totaling up the charges for his first week—a tidy commercial document in a green envelope, with an exquisite picture of the Berghof at the top of the page and excerpts from the brochure arranged attractively in a narrow column along the left margin, where italicized mention was also made of “psychological therapy by the most modern methods.” The list itself, done in elegant calligraphy, came to almost exactly 180 francs, which was broken down into 8 francs a day for room, 12 francs a day for board and medical treatment, plus separate entries of 20 francs “entrance fee,” and 10 francs for “disinfection of the room,” with the final total rounded out by smaller fees for laundry, beer, and the wine he had drunk at his first supper here."

"Herr Settembrini hoffte sich nicht zu täuschen in der Annahme, daß Hans Castorp dergleichen nur sage, damit man ihm widerspreche. Der junge Mann werde ihn immer bereit finden, ihm in der geistigen Abwehr solcher Anfechtungen zur Hand zu gehen. »Lebenstüchtig« sage er? Und gebrauche dies {700}Wort in einem abschätzig gemeinen Sinn? »Lebenswürdig!« Dieses Wort möge er dafür einsetzen, – und die Begriffe würden sich ihm zu wahrer und schöner Ordnung fügen. »Lebenswürdigkeit«: und sogleich, auf dem Wege leichtester und rechtmäßigster Assoziation, stelle sich auch die Idee der Liebenswürdigkeit ein, so innig nahe verwandt jener ersten, daß man sagen dürfe, nur das wahrhaft Lebenswürdige sei auch wahrhaft liebenswürdig. Beides zusammen aber, das Lebens- und also Liebenswürdige, mache das aus, was man das Vornehme nenne.","Herr Settembrini hoped not to deceive himself into assuming that Hans Castorp only said things like that so that people would contradict him. The young man will always find him ready to lend a hand in mental defense against such temptations. ""Fit for life"" did he say? And use this {700}word in a derogatory mean sense? ""Worth living!"" He may use this word for it - and the concepts would submit to him in a true and beautiful order. ""Liveliness"": and immediately, by way of the easiest and most legitimate association, the idea of lovability appears, so closely related to the first that one can say that only what is truly worthy of life is also truly lovable. But both together, the worthy of living and therefore lovable, make up what is called noble.","Herr Settembrini said he was confident Hans Castorp uttered such stuff merely for the sake of being contradicted. The young man would find him ever ready to lend a hand in the intellectual warfare, against attacks like the present. The Engineer had used the expression “fit for life”; had he intended it in a derogatory sense? To him it was synonymous with “worthy of life,” the two conceptions being perfectly harmonious, and suggesting by a natural process of association another equally beautiful, “worthy of love.” One might with truth say that he who was worthy of the one was fully worthy of the other. And both together, loveworthy and life-worthy, made up the true nobility.","Herr Settembrini hoped he was not wrong in assuming that Hans Castorp had made such a remark merely so that it could be contradicted. The young man would always find him ready to assist intellectually in warding off such assaults. “Fit for life,” had he said? And had used the term in a pejorative sense? “Worthy of life”—that was the term he should have used instead. And then his thoughts would order themselves in a true and beautiful manner. “Worthy of life”—and at once, by means of the simplest, most legitimate sort of association, one was reminded of the term “worthy of love,” which was so intimately related to the former that one could say that whatever was worthy of life was truly worthy of love. And joined together, the two terms—“worthy of love” and “worthy of life”—became what one called noble."

"Wer war Ellen Brand? Fast hätten wir vergessen, daß unsere Zuhörer es nicht wissen, während uns natürlich der Name geläufig ist. Wer sie war? Fast niemand auf den ersten Blick. Ein liebes Ding von neunzehn Jahren, Elly gerufen, flachsblond, Dänin, doch nicht einmal aus Kopenhagen, sondern aus Odense auf Fünen, woselbst ihr Vater ein Buttergeschäft besaß. Sie selbst stand im praktischen Leben, hatte schon ein paar Jahre, einen Schreibärmel über dem rechten Arm, als Beamtin der Provinzfiliale einer hauptstädtischen Bank auf einem Drehbock über dicken Büchern gesessen, – wobei sie Temperatur bekommen hatte. Der Fall war unerheblich, er hatte wohl eigentlich nur Verdachtscharakter, wenn Elly auch freilich ja zart war, zart und offenbar bleichsüchtig, – dabei unbedingt sympathisch, so daß man ihr gern die Hand auf den flachsblonden Scheitel gelegt hätte, was denn der Hofrat auch regelmäßig tat, wenn er im Speisesaal mit ihr sprach. Nordische Kühle umgab sie, eine gläsern-keusche, kindlich-jungfräuliche Atmosphäre, durchaus liebenswert, wie der volle und reine Kinderblick ihrer Blauaugen und wie ihre Sprache, die spitz, hoch und fein war, ein leicht gebrochenes Deutsch mit kleinen typischen Lautfehlern, wie »Fleich« statt »Fleisch«. An ihren Zügen war nichts Bemerkenswertes. Das Kinn war zu kurz. Sie saß am Tische der Kleefeld, die sie bemutterte.","Who was Ellen Brand? We almost forgot that our listeners don't know it, while of course the name is familiar to us. Who was she? Almost no one at first glance. A sweet little girl of nineteen, called Elly, flaxen, Danish, not even from Copenhagen but from Odense on Funen, where her father owned a butter shop. She herself was in practical life, had already been a clerk in the provincial branch of a metropolitan bank, a writing sleeve over her right arm, for a few years sitting on a trestle over thick books - during which she had developed a temperature. The case was irrelevant, it was probably only suspect, even if Elly was of course delicate, delicate and obviously anaemic, - at the same time absolutely likeable, so that one would have liked to put a hand on the flaxen hair on top of her head, which the privy councilor also regularly did did when he spoke to her in the dining room. Nordic coolness surrounded her, a glassy, chaste, childlike, virginal atmosphere, quite lovable, like the full and pure childish look of her blue eyes and like her language, which was pointed, high and fine, a slightly broken German with small typical phonetic errors, like » flesh” instead of “meat”. There was nothing remarkable about her features. The chin was too short. She sat at Kleefeld's table, who mothered her.","Who was Ellen Brand? We had almost forgotten that our readers do not know her, so familiar to us is the name. Who was she? Hardly anybody, at first glance. A sweet young thing of nineteen years, a flaxen-haired Dane, not from Copenhagen but from Odense-on-Fünen, where her father had a butter business. She herself had been in commercial life for a couple of years or so; with a sleeve-protector on her writing-arm she had sat over heavy books, perched on a revolving stool in a provincial branch of a city bank—and developed temperature. It was a trifling case, probably more suspected than real, though Elly was indeed fragile, fragile and obviously chlorotic—distinctly sympathetic too, giving one a yearning to lay one’s hand upon the flaxen head—as the Hofrat regularly did, when he spoke to her in the dining-room. A northern freshness emanated from her, a chaste and glassy, maidenly chaste atmosphere surrounded her, she was entirely lovable, with a pure, open look from childlike blue eyes, and a pointed, fine, High-German speech, slightly broken, with small typical mispronunciations. About her features there was nothing unusual. Her chin was too short. She sat at table with the Kleefeld, who mothered her.","Who was Ellen Brand?

A sweet young thing of nineteen—everyone called her Elly—with flax-blond hair, a Danish girl, not even from Copenhagen, but from Odense on the island of Fyn, where her father owned a butter factory. She knew something about real life, had in fact spent a couple of years as a clerk in a provincial branch office of a national bank, sitting on a swivel stool, a sleeve-protector on her right arm, and staring at massive tomes—and had ended up with a fever. Her case was negligible, really more suspicion than fact, even though Elly was delicate, and obviously anemic, too—but definitely a likable girl, the sort you would have loved to pat on her flax-blond head, as the director did regularly whenever he spoke to her in the dining hall. There was an aura of Nordic coolness about her, a glasslike chasteness, a virginal, childish quality that was quite attractive, as were both the full, pure look in her blue, childlike eyes and her pointed, refined way of speaking, in a slightly broken German with the typical mispronunciations of Danes—like “fleck” for “flesh.” There was nothing remarkable about her facial features. The chin was too small. She sat at the same table as Hermine Kleefeld, who mothered her."
"So Japoll, für den natürlich nicht viel zu retten war. Seine Korrekturen vermochten den schönen Kontrast von Ehre und Misere, wie er aus den Feststellungen der Gegenseite hervorging, nur oberflächlich zu stören, zumal er nicht über die Vervielfältigungstechnik der Zutawskischen Partei verfügte, sondern nur ein paar Maschinendurchschläge seiner Replik unter die Leute zu bringen wußte. Jene Protokolle dagegen, wie gesagt, erhielt jedermann, auch völlig Fernstehende erhielten sie. Naphta und Settembrini z.B. hatten sie ebenfalls zugestellt bekommen, – Hans Castorp sah sie in ihren Händen, und zu {1045}seiner Überraschung bemerkte er, daß auch sie mit verbissenen und sonderbar hingerissenen Mienen darauf niederblickten. Den heiteren Spott, den er selbst vermöge der herrschenden inneren Umstände nicht aufbrachte, von Herrn Settembrini wenigstens hatte er ihn erwartet. Aber auch über den klaren Geist des Maurers übte die umlaufende Infektion, die Hans Castorp beobachtete, offenbar eine Gewalt, die ihm das Lachen verschlug, ihn für die aufpeitschenden Reize des Ohrfeigenhandels ernstlich empfänglich machte; und außerdem verdüsterte ihn, den Mann des Lebens, sein langsam und unter foppenden Rückschlägen zum Guten, aber unaufhaltsam sich verschlechternder Gesundheitszustand, den er verwünschte, und dessen er sich ingrimmig und mit Selbstverachtung schämte, der ihn aber um diese Zeit schon alle paar Tage zwang, das Bett zu hüten.","So Japoll, for whom of course not much could be saved. His corrections only superficially disturbed the nice contrast between honor and misery, as it emerged from the findings of the other side, especially since he did not have the duplicating technology of the Zutawski party, but only knew how to get a few machine copies of his replica out to the people. On the other hand, as I said, everyone received those protocols, even people who were completely distant from us. Naphta and Settembrini, for example, had also been delivered - Hans Castorp saw them in their hands, and to {1045}his surprise he noticed that they too were looking down at them with grim and strangely entranced expressions. He had at least expected the cheerful mockery, which he himself was unable to muster because of the prevailing internal circumstances, from M. Settembrini. But the circulating infection that Hans Castorp observed apparently exerted a force on the clear mind of the bricklayer too, which stopped him from laughing and made him seriously receptive to the inciting charms of the slap trade; and besides, he, the man of life, was bedeviled by his slowly and tauntingly reversing good but inexorably declining state of health, which he cursed and was grimly and self-loathingly ashamed of, but which by this time was forcing him every few days to stay in bed.","Thus Japoll, for whom, of course, not much could be said. His defence did not greatly invalidate the elegant contrast of honour with pusillanimity presented by the document on the other side; the less because he had not the manifolding facilities disposed of by his opponents, and could only distribute a few typed duplicates of his reply. The protocol, on the contrary, everyone received, even the most uninterested. Naphta and Settembrini, for instance, had copies sent them, which Hans Castorp saw in their hands, and remarked, to his surprise, that they too perused them with bitter concentration. For him the ruling temper of the Berghof was too much—he was powerless to dissipate its mood by a burst of blithe and cleansing laughter, but this he had confidently expected to hear from Herr Settembrini. Alas, no, even the unclouded eye of the Freemason was dimmed by the prevailing spleen; it weighed on his spirit, stilling his mirth; it made him susceptible to the rasping provocation of the tale of the ear-boxing. Moreover he, the protagonist of Life, was suffering in spirit from the state of his health. Slowly, remorselessly, with deceptive interludes of brighter hope, it grew worse. He despised, he scorned it, and himself; but had reached the point where it obliged him, every few days, to take to his bed.","That was Japoll—but there wasn’t much to salvage there. His revisions only superficially disturbed the pretty contrast of honor and shabbiness apparent in the affidavits of the opposing side, particularly since he did not have at his disposal the Zutawskian party’s duplicating machinery, but could only circulate a few typed carbon copies of his rejoinder. Everyone, however, received the affidavits, even people quite removed from the matter. Naphta and Settembrini, for example, had likewise been sent copies—Hans Castorp saw them in their hands, and noted to his surprise that they, too, examined them with sour and strangely intense faces. He had at least expected Herr Settembrini to respond with the jaunty mockery he had been unable to summon himself, given his own inner state. But the infection Hans Castorp knew was going round had even influenced the Freemason’s clear intellect, robbing him of his laughter, leaving him seriously vulnerable to the inflammatory charms of slaps exchanged in the name of honor; in addition, though he had his good days, which were more like teasing setbacks, the old affirmer of life had turned gloomy watching the inexorable deterioration in his health; feeling intensely ashamed, he cursed it and despised himself when it forced him to take to his bed every few days now."
"So Naphtas scharfe Rede. Die kleine Versammlung schwieg. Die jungen Leute blickten Herrn Settembrini an. An ihm war es, sich irgendwie zu verhalten. Er sagte:",So Naphta's sharp speech. The small gathering was silent. The young people looked at Mr. Settembrini. It was up to him to act somehow. He said:,"Thus Naphta. The little group was silent. The young men looked to Herr Settembrini. It was, they felt, his affair. He said: “Astounding.","So ended Naphta’s caustic oration. The little gathering was silent. The young men looked to Herr Settembrini—they would take their cue from him. “Amazing,” he said."
"Auch Hans Castorp trank, obgleich sein Gesicht nun wie Feuer brannte. Aber am Körper war ihm noch immer kalt, und {28}eine besondere freudige und doch etwas quälende Unruhe war in seinen Gliedern. Seine Worte überhasteten sich, er versprach sich des öfteren und ging mit einer wegwerfenden Handbewegung darüber hin. Übrigens war auch Joachim in belebter Stimmung, und um so freier und aufgeräumter ging ihr Gespräch, als die summende, pochende Dame ganz plötzlich aufgestanden und davongegangen war. Sie gestikulierten beim Essen mit den Gabeln, machten, einen Bissen in der Backe, wichtige Mienen, lachten, nickten, hoben die Schultern und hatten noch nicht ordentlich hinuntergeschluckt, wenn sie schon weitersprachen. Joachim wollte von Hamburg hören und hatte das Gespräch auf die geplante Elbregulierung gebracht.","Hans Castorp drank too, although his face was now burning like fire. But his body was still cold, and there was a special joyful and yet somewhat tormenting restlessness in his limbs. His words were too hasty, he often made mistakes and dismissed them with a dismissive gesture. Incidentally, Joachim was also in a lively mood, and their conversation went all the more freely and happily when the humming, throbbing lady suddenly got up and walked away. They gestured with their forks as they ate, made important faces, biting into their cheeks, laughed, nodded, shrugged their shoulders and hadn't swallowed properly before they went on talking. Joachim wanted to hear from Hamburg and had brought the conversation to the planned regulation of the Elbe.","Hans Castorp drank too, though his face was like fire. Yet he was still cold, and felt a curious restlessness in his limbs, at once pleasurable and troubling. His words fell over each other, he often misspoke and passed it over with a deprecating wave. Joachim too was in a lively humour, and their conversation continued in a still freer and more convivial vein after the humming, tapping lady had got up suddenly and left the room. They gesticulated with their forks as they ate, nodded, shrugged their shoulders, talked with their mouths full. Joachim wanted to hear about Hamburg, and brought the conversation round to the proposed regulation of the Elbe.","Hans Castorp drank as well, although his face was burning like fire by now. But his body still seemed cold, and he felt a pleasurable and yet somehow annoying restlessness in his joints. Words tumbled out, he misspoke himself several times, but went right on with a dismissive wave of his hand. Joachim was likewise in a lively mood, and after the humming, drumming lady suddenly stood up and departed, their conversation turned even more candid and high-spirited. They gesticulated with their forks as they ate, tucked bites of food in their cheeks, looked important, laughed, nodded, shrugged, and went right on talking without even first swallowing their food properly. Joachim wanted to hear about Hamburg and brought the conversation around to plans for making the Elbe more navigable."
"»Es war sehr gütig von Ihnen«, sagte er, »und Sie haben recht. Wir waren Duzfreunde. Ich schäme mich in tiefster Seele, daß ich mich dessen schämte vor den Leuten und Umschweife gebrauchte. – Sie waren bei ihm in seinen letzten Augenblicken?«","'It was very kind of you,' he said, 'and you are right. We were first-name friends. I am ashamed in my soul that I was ashamed of it in front of people and used circumlocutions. ""You were with him in his last moments?""","“It was kind of you,” he answered, “and you are right.” He availed himself of the third person plural as used by the peoples of the cultured West. “We were brothers. I feel shamed in the depth of my soul that I tried to hide it, and used circumlocutions before other people. Were you with him at the last?”","“Very kind of you,” he said, adopting formal pronouns himself, “and it was the correct thing to do. He offered me the brotherhood of informal pronouns. I am so deeply ashamed now to say that I was embarrassed to acknowledge it in front of the others and used circumlocutions. Were you with him in the last moments?”"
"Die Mahlzeit, bei der er Frau Redisch mit erhobenem Glase grüßte, und zwar zweimal: beim Fischragout und später beim Sorbett, war dieselbe, die Hofrat Behrens am Tische Hans Castorps und seines Gastes einnahm, – er hospitierte ja immer reihum an jedem der sieben, und überall war das Gedeck an der oberen Schmalseite ihm vorbehalten. Die riesigen Hände vor seinem Teller gefaltet, saß er mit seinem geschürzten Bärtchen zwischen Herrn Wehsal und dem mexikanischen Buckligen, mit dem er Spanisch sprach – denn er beherrschte alle Sprachen, auch Türkisch und Ungarisch, – und sah mit blau quellenden, rot unterlaufenen Augen zu, wie Konsul Tienappel Frau Redisch drüben mit seinem Bordeauxglase salutierte. Später im Laufe des Essens hielt der Hofrat einen kleinen Vortrag, angefeuert dazu durch James, der ihm über die ganze Länge des Tisches hin aus dem Stegreif die Frage vorlegte, wie es sei, wenn der Mensch verwese. Der Hofrat habe doch das Körperliche studiert, der Körper sei ganz ausgesprochen seine Branche, er sei sozusagen eine Art Körperfürst, wenn man sich so ausdrükken dürfe, und nun solle er mal erzählen, wie es so zugehe, wenn der Körper sich auflöse!","The meal at which he greeted Frau Redisch with a raised glass, twice: with the fish ragout and later with the sherbet, was the same that Hofrat Behrens ate at the table of Hans Castorp and his guest - he always took turns sitting in on each of the seven and everywhere the table setting on the upper narrow side was reserved for him. His huge hands clasped in front of his plate, he sat with his little beard tucked up between Herr Wehsal and the Mexican hunchback with whom he spoke Spanish - for he spoke every language, including Turkish and Hungarian - and watched with blue, red-shot eyes , as Consul Tienappel saluted Frau Redisch over there with his Bordeaux glass. Later in the course of the meal the Councilor gave a little lecture, encouraged by James, who, down the length of the table, asked him offhand the question of what it was like when man decayed. The Hofrat had studied the physical, the body was definitely his branch, he was a kind of body prince, if one were allowed to put it that way, and now he should tell us what happens when the body dissolves!","The meal at which he saluted Frau Redisch by lifting his glass—twice in fact, during it, once at the fish and once at the sherbet—was one which the Hofrat partook of at Hans Castorp’s table, in the course of his turn round the seven, at each of which his place at the upper end was reserved. He sat folding his giant hands between Herr Wehsal and the hunch-backed Mexican, with whom he spoke Spanish, for he could talk in almost any language, even Turkish and Hungarian. He sat, with his little onesided moustache and his blue, goggling, bloodshot eyes, and looked on at Consul Tienappel saluting Frau Redisch with his glass of Bordeaux. Afterwards, as the meal progressed, the Hofrat made a little speech, incited thereunto by James, who unexpectedly asked him, down the whole length of the table, what was the process of physical decomposition. The Hofrat was at home in that field, the physical was so to speak his domain, he was the king of it; would he not tell them what happened when the body decomposed?","The meal at which he toasted Frau Redisch with his glass—twice in fact, once over fish ragout and then later over sorbet—was a meal at which Director Behrens was seated at the same table as Hans Castorp and his guest, for he regularly worked his way around all seven and there was always a place set for him at the upper end of each. He was seated between Herr Wehsal and the hunchbacked Mexican, with whom he spoke Spanish—because he was a master of many languages, including Turkish and Hungarian—and folding his gigantic hands before his plate and hitching his moustache more askew, he watched with protruding, bloodshot, blue eyes as Consul Tienappel raised his glass of bordeaux to Frau Redisch at her table. Later in the course of the meal, the director gave a little lecture, having been prodded to do so when, from the other end of the table, James had asked him out of the blue what happened, exactly, when, a body decayed—the director had studied anatomy, and the human body was most decidedly his business, he was, so to speak, a prince of the body, if one could put it that way, and so would he now please explain the process by which the body decomposed."
"{1022}Das Medium, so setzte Dr. Krokowski sein Vorwort fort, das er offenbar an Hans Castorp besonders richtete, bedürfe der Einschläferung durch ihn, den Arzt, nicht länger. Sie falle, wie der Kontrolleur schon merken werde, von selbst in Trance, und, dies geschehen, spreche ihr Schutzgeist, der bekannte Holger, aus ihr, an den man sich auch – und nicht an sie – mit seinen Wünschen zu wenden habe. Übrigens sei es irrtümlich und könne Mißlingen zeitigen, zu glauben, man müsse Willen und Gedanken mit Gewalt auf das gewärtigte Phänomen versammeln. Im Gegenteil sei eine halb zerstreute und gesprächige Aufmerksamkeit das Gebotene. Hans Castorp möge vor allem darauf bedacht sein, die Extremitäten des Mediums in untadeliger Obhut zu halten.","{1022}The medium, as Dr. Krokowski continued his foreword, which he apparently specifically addressed to Hans Castorp, and he, the doctor, no longer needed to put him to sleep. As the inspector will notice, she falls into a trance of her own accord, and when this happens, her guardian spirit, the well-known Holger, speaks out of her, to whom one should also - and not to her - turn with one's wishes. Besides, it is erroneous and can lead to failure to believe that one must force will and thoughts on the expected phenomenon. On the contrary, a half-distracted and talkative attention is what is required. Above all, Hans Castorp may be careful to keep the extremities of the medium in impeccable care.","The medium, Dr. Krokowski went on, obviously addressing his words to Hans Castorp in particular, no longer needed to be put in the trance by the physician. She fell into it herself, as the control would see, and once she had done so, it would be her guardian spirit Holger, who spoke with her voice, to whom, and not to her, they should address themselves. Further, it was an error, which might result in failure, to suppose that one must bend mind or will upon the expected phenomena. On the contrary, a slightly diffused attention, with conversation, was recommended. And Hans Castorp was cautioned, whatever else he did, not to lose control of the medium’s extremities.","The medium, Dr. Krokowski noted, continuing an introduction evidently addressed in particular to Hans Castorp, no longer needed to be put into a trance by the attending physician. As the gentleman monitoring her would doubtless soon notice, she fell into that state all on her own, and once this occurred, her attendant spirit, known to them as Holger, would speak through her, and it was to him—and not to her—that one was to address one ’s wishes. It was a common error, by the way, an error that could even bring about failure, to believe one had to concentrate one’s will and thoughts on the prospective phenomenon. On the contrary, it was best to diffuse one’s attention somewhat, even quiet conversation was useful. Hans Castorp should, however, concentrate on keeping the medium’s extremities under flawless control."
"Es war eine bunte Versammlung, in der die drei Kranken, die Vettern und ihr Schützling sich umsahen. Engländer mit schottischen Mützen und weißen Zähnen sprachen Französisch mit penetrant duftenden Damen, die von oben bis unten in bunte Wolle gekleidet waren, und von denen einige in Hosen gingen. Kleinköpfige Amerikaner, das Haar glatt angeklebt, die Shagpfeife im Munde, trugen Pelze, deren Rauhseite nach außen gekehrt war. Russen, bärtig und elegant, barbarisch reichen Ansehens, und Holländer von malaischem Kreuzungstyp saßen zwischen deutschem und schweizerischem Publikum, während allerlei Unbestimmtes, französisch Redendes, vom Balkan oder der Levante, abenteuerliche Welt, für die Hans Castorp eine gewisse Schwäche an den Tag legte, und die von Joachim als zweideutig und charakterlos abgelehnt wurde, überall eingesprengt war. Kinder konkurrierten zwischendurch in scherzhaften Aufgaben, stolperten über die Bahn, am einen Fuß einen Schnee-, am anderen einen Schlittschuh, oder indem die Knaben ihre Dämchen auf Schaufeln vor sich her schoben. Sie liefen mit brennenden Kerzen, wobei Sieger war, wer sein Licht, noch brennend, zum Ziele trug, mußten im Laufe Hindernisse überklettern oder Kartoffeln mit Zinnlöffeln in aufgestellte Gießkannen lesen. Die große Welt jubelte. Man zeigte sich die reichsten, berühmtesten und anmutigsten unter den Kindern, das Töchterchen eines holländischen Multimillionärs, den Sohn eines preußischen Prinzen und einen Zwölfjährigen, der den Namen einer weltbekannten Champagnerfirma trug. Die arme Karen jubelte ebenfalls und hustete dabei. Sie klatschte vor Freude in ihre Hände mit den offenen Fingerspitzen. Sie war so dankbar.","It was a motley gathering, in which the three patients, the cousins and their protégé looked around. Englishmen in Scottish caps and white teeth spoke French to pungently scented ladies dressed from head to toe in brightly colored wool, some of whom wore breeches. Small-headed Americans, hair glued down, shag pipe in mouth, wore furs rough side out. Russians, bearded and elegant, barbarously rich in reputation, and Dutchmen of the Malay hybrid type sat between the German and Swiss audience, while all sorts of vague things, speaking French, from the Balkans or the Levant, an adventurous world for which Hans Castorp showed a certain weakness, and which was rejected by Joachim as ambiguous and characterless, was sprinkled everywhere. In between, children competed in fun tasks, stumbling across the track, one foot on a snow skate and the other an ice skate, or the boys pushed their ladies on shovels in front of them. They ran with burning candles, and the winner was whoever carried his candle to the finish while it was still burning, had to climb over obstacles or pick potatoes with pewter spoons into watering cans. The big world cheered. They showed the richest, most famous and most graceful of children, the daughter of a Dutch multi-millionaire, the son of a Prussian prince and a twelve-year-old who bore the name of a world-famous champagne company. Poor Karen cheered too, coughing. She clapped her hands open fingertips in delight. She was so thankful.","It was a gay company, in which the three invalids, the cousins and their protegee, sat and looked about them. There were white-teethed Englishmen in Scotch caps, talking in French to highly-scented ladies dressed from head to foot in bright-coloured woollens —some of them even wore knickerbockers; Americans with small, neat heads, on which the hair “was plastered down, pipe in mouth, and wearing shaggy furs the skin-side out; bearded, elegant Russians, looking barbarically rich, and Malayan Dutchmen, all these sitting among the German and Swiss population, as well as a sprinkling of indeterminate types—all speaking French—perhaps from the Balkans or the Levant. Hans Castorp showed certain weakness for this motley semibarbarous world; but Joachim put it aside as mongrel and questionable. At intervals there were events for children, who staggered over the course with a snow-shoe on one foot and a ski on the other. In one race each boy pushed a girl before him on a shovel; in another the winner carried a lighted taper, and must arrive at the goal with it still burning; or must climb over obstacles in his path, or pick up potatoes with a tin spoon and deposit them in watering-pots placed along the course. Everybody was in extravagant spirits. The richest children were pointed out, the prettiest and those from well-known families: there were the little daughter of a Dutch multi-millionaire, the son of a Prussian prince, and a twelve-year-old lad who bore the name of a champagne known the world over. Young Karen was gay with the rest, and coughed persistently as she laughed; clapping for joy and very gratitude her poor hands with the running finger-ends. The cousins took her to see the bob-sleigh races as well.","It was a very colorful gathering, and the three patients—the two cousins and their protégée—looked about, taking it all in. Englishmen with very white teeth and Scotch tams conversed in French with ladies drenched in perfume and dressed from head to foot in bright-colored wools, some even in trousers. American men, their hair plastered flat against their small heads, wore their fur coats skin-side out and smoked shag-tobacco pipes. Seated among the Germans and Swiss were bearded, elegant Russians, looking barbarically rich, and Dutchmen with traces of Malayan blood—all intermixed with a sprinkling of indeterminate sorts who spoke French and came from the Balkans or the Levant, a motley set of adventurers for whom Hans Castorp had a certain weakness but whom Joachim spurned as dubious and lacking in character. There were also various crazy contests for children, who hobbled across the rink with a snowshoe on one foot, an ice skate on the other. Little boys had to push little girls ahead of them on snow shovels. There was a race with candles—the winner was the first to arrive at the goal with her flame still burning. There were obstacle courses, and races where the contestants had to carry potatoes on a tin spoon and deposit them in watering cans set at the end of the course. High society cheered. People pointed out the richest, most famous, most charming children: the daughter of a Dutch multimillionaire, the son of a Prussian prince, and a twelve-year-old lad whose name was on the label of a world-famous champagne. Poor Karen cheered as well—and coughed each time. She clapped her hands for joy, despite the open sores on her fingers. She was so grateful."
"Wenn darauf Herr Settembrini eine Pause eintreten ließ, so war klar, daß es einzig aus pädagogischer Besonnenheit geschah. Er antwortete nach gemessenem Stillschweigen:","If Mr. Settembrini then allowed a pause, it was clear that it was purely out of pedagogical prudence. After measured silence, he replied:","Herr Settembrini allowed a pause to ensue; but it was clear that he only did so out of pedagogic deliberation.

"»Adam Weishaupt organisierte seinen humanitären Geheimbund ganz nach dem Muster des Jesuitenordens durch. Er selbst war Maurer, und die angesehensten Logenmänner der Zeit waren Illuminaten. Ich spreche von der zweiten Hälfte des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts, die Settembrini nicht zögern wird, Ihnen als eine Zeit der Verderbnis seiner Gilde zu kennzeichnen. In Wirklichkeit war sie die ihrer Hochblüte, wie des ganzen geheimen Bundeswesens überhaupt, die Zeit, wo die Maurerei wahrhaft höheres Leben gewann, ein Leben, von dem sie später durch Leute vom Schlage unseres Menschheitsfreundes wieder gereinigt wurde, der damals unbedingt zu denen gehört hätte, die ihr Jesuitismus und Obskurantismus zum Vorwurf machten.«","»Adam Weishaupt organized his humanitarian secret society entirely along the lines of the Jesuit order. He himself was a mason, and the most respected lodge men of the time were Illuminati. I am speaking of the second half of the eighteenth century, which Settembrini will not hesitate to describe to you as a time of his guild's depravity. In reality, it was the peak of its heyday, like that of the whole secret alliance in general, the time when Masonry really gained a higher life, a life from which it was later cleansed again by people like our friend of humanity, who at the time would definitely have belonged to them who accused her of Jesuitism and obscurantism.«","“Adam Weishaupt formed his secret benevolent order entirely upon the model of the Society of Jesus. He himself was a Mason, and the most reputable lodge members of the time were Illuminati. I am speaking of the second half of the eighteenth century, which Settembrini would not hesitate to characterize as the period of the degeneration of his fraternity. Actually it was the period of its highest flower, as of all secret societies in general, a time when Masonry attained to a higher life, of which it was later ‘purged’ by men of the stamp of our friend of humanity here. In that time he would certainly have belonged to those who reproached it with Jesuitry and obscurantism.”","“Adam Weishaupt modeled his humanitarian secret society strictly on the Jesuit order. He was himself a Mason, and the most distinguished Masons of the period were Illuminati. I am speaking of the second half of the eighteenth century, which Settembrini would not hesitate to describe to you as a period of decline in his guild. In reality, however, it was in fullest bloom, as were secret societies in general. It was an age when Freemasonry achieved a higher life—a life of which it was later purged by people of the same sort as our philanthropist, who would most definitely have joined those who at the time accused it of Jesuitical obscurantism.”"

Kein Glied war abgestorben, keines zerbrach ihm klirrend, während er stampfte, sich schüttelte und schlug, worin er nicht säumig war, indem er zu gleicher Zeit die Sachlage gedanklich zu ergründen suchte. Ohren, Fingerspitzen und Zehen waren wohl taub, allein nicht mehr, als schon so oft beim {750}nächtlich-winterlichen Liegen in der Loge. Es gelang, die Uhr hervorzugraben. Sie ging. Sie war nicht stehen geblieben, wie sie zu tun pflegte, wenn er sie abends aufzuziehen vergaß. Sie zeigte noch nicht Fünf – bei weitem nicht. Es fehlten zwölf, dreizehn Minuten daran. Erstaunlich! Konnte es denn sein, daß er nur zehn Minuten oder etwas länger hier im Schnee gelegen und so vieles an Glücks- und Schreckensbildern und waghalsigen Gedanken sich vorgefabelt hatte, indessen das hexagonale Unwesen sich so schnell verzog, wie es gekommen? Dann hatte er anerkennenswertes Glück gehabt, unter dem Gesichtspunkt des Heimkommens. Denn zweimal hatte sein Träumen und Fabeln eine Wendung genommen, daß er belebt emporgefahren war: einmal vor Grauen und das zweitemal vor Freude. Es schien, das Leben hatte es gut gemeint mit seinem hochverirrten Sorgenkinde …","It was extremely difficult for her to free himself from the bonds that ensnared him and wanted to hold him down; but the drive that he knew how to create was stronger. Hans Castorp threw himself on his elbows, drew up his knees like a man, jerked, supported himself, and twisted himself up. He stomped the snow with his boards, wrapped his arms around his ribs and shook his shoulders, sending excited and strained glances this way and that and up at the sky where pale blue showed between veil-thin grey-blue clouds that gently drifted and revealed the narrow crescent of the moon. Light twilight. No storm, no snowfall. The mountain face over there with the fir-rough back was full and clear to see, lying in peace. shade reached halfway up; the upper half was exposed to the most delicate pink. What was there, and how was the world? Was morning? And had he lain in the snow all night without freezing to death, as was written in the book? Not a limb had died, none broke with a clatter as he stamped, shook, and hit, in which he was not slow, while at the same time trying to fathom the situation mentally. Ears, fingertips and toes were probably deaf, but no more than so often when lying in the box at night in winter. They managed to dig out the clock. She went. She hadn't stopped, as she used to do when he forgot to wind her up in the evening. She hadn't hit a five yet - not by a long shot. Twelve or thirteen minutes were missing. Astonishing! Could it be that he had only lain here in the snow for ten minutes or a little longer, imagining so many happy and terrifying images and daring thoughts, while the hexagonal monstrosity disappeared as quickly as it came? Then he had been commendably lucky, from the point of view of coming home. For twice his dreams and fables had taken such a turn that he had jumped up alive: once with horror and the second time with joy. It seemed that life had meant well with its lost problem child...","The bonds held fast that kept his limbs involved. He had a hard struggle to free himself—but the inner compulsion proved stronger. With a jerk he raised himself on his elbows, briskly drew up his knees, shoved, rolled, wrestled to his feet; stamped with his skis in the snow, flung his arms about his ribs and worked his shoulders violently, all the while casting strained, alert glances about him and above, where now a pale blue sky showed itself between grey-bluish clouds, and these presently drew away to discover a thin sickle of a moon. Early twilight reigned: no snowfall, no storm. The wall of the opposite mountain with its shaggy, tree-clad ridge stretched out before him plain and peaceful. Shadow lay on half its height, but the upper half was bathed in palest rosy light. How were things in the world? Was it morning? Had he, despite what the books said, lain all night in the snow and not frozen? Not a member was frost-bitten, nothing snapped when he stamped, shook and struck himself, as he did vigorously, all the time seeking to establish the facts of his situation. Ears, toes, finger-tips, were of course numb, but not more so than they had often been at night in his loggia. He could take his watch from his pocket—it was still going, it had not stopped, as it did if he forgot to wind it. It said not yet five—it was in fact considerably earlier, twelve, thirteen minutes. Preposterous! Could it be he had lain here in the snow only ten minutes or so, while all these scenes of horror and delight and those presumptuous thoughts had spun themselves in his brain, and the hexagonal hurly vanished as it came? If that were true, then he must be grateful for his good fortune; that is, from the point of view of a safe home-coming. For twice such a turn had come, in his dream and fantasy, as had made him start up—once from horror, and again for rapture. It seemed, indeed, that life meant well by her lone-wandering delicate child.","It turned out to be very difficult to liberate himself from the bonds that had woven around him and still tried to hold him down; but the impulse to counter them proved stronger. Hans Castorp propped himself on his elbows, valiantly pulled his knees up, tugged, shoved, wriggled himself to his feet. He stamped the snow with his skis, hugged himself, beat his ribs, shook his shoulders, while his eyes searched excitedly and eagerly here, there, everywhere in the sky, as soft blue peered through the gray-blue gauze of the clouds, now drifting aside to reveal the narrow sickle of the moon. Gentle dusk was falling. No wind, no snow. The whole mountain face opposite, including its ridge of rough firs, was visible now, lay peaceful before him. Shadows now reached halfway up it; but the upper portion was bathed in softest pink. What was happening, what was the world up to? Was it morning? Had he lain there in the snow all night without freezing to death, despite what the books said? No body parts were frostbitten, nothing broke off with a tinkle as he stamped and shook and hugged—and not feebly, either—trying at the same time to fathom his situation. Ears, fingertips, and toes were numb, but nothing more, no worse than they often were after a stay on his balcony on a winter night. He managed to pull out his watch. It was ticking. It had not stopped the way it did if he forgot to wind it of an evening. It wasn’t five yet—not by a long shot. Not for another twelve, thirteen minutes. Amazing! Could it be that he had lain there in the snow for only ten minutes or a little longer , had fantasized all those daredevil thoughts, those images of happiness and horror, while the hexagonal monster moved on as quickly as it had come? Well, then, he had been remarkably lucky in terms of getting home. Because his dreams and fantasies had twice taken a turn to bring him back to life: once in horror, the second time out of joy. It seemed that life meant well by its highly confused problem child."

"Es war zu Ende damit. Die beschämende Herabstimmung von Hans Castorps Natur war überwunden durch den Gruß, den er mit Clawdia Chauchat getauscht hatte, und ganz genau genommen, war es dies Bewußtsein, dem eigentlich seine Genugtuung galt. Ja, Joachim hatte recht gehabt: Merkurius stieg wieder! Er stieg, als Hans Castorp ihn nach dem Spaziergang zu Rate zog, auf rund 38 Grad.","That was the end of it. The shameful belittling of Hans Castorp's nature was overcome by the greeting he had exchanged with Clawdia Chauchat, and in fact it was this awareness that he was really looking for in satisfaction. Yes, Joachim was right: Mercury rose again! When Hans Castorp consulted him after the walk, it rose to around 38 degrees.","It had. The greeting he had exchanged with Clavdia Chauchat had overcome the mortifying depression; it was at bottom the consciousness of this which had lain at the root of Hans Castorp’s gratification. Yes, yes, Joachim was right , Mercurius was mounting again: when Hans Castorp consulted him, on their return from their walk, he had climbed up to 100.4°.","And it was the end. Hans Castorp’s humiliating depression had been vanquished by the greetings he had exchanged with Clavdia Chauchat, and strictly speaking, the real basis of his present satisfaction was his awareness that it had been overcome. Yes, it turned out Joachim was right: Mercury was climbing again! Home from his walk, Hans Castorp consulted him—and he promptly climbed to 100.4 degrees."
"»Um acht hole ich dich zum Frühstück«, sagte Joachim und ging.","""I'll get you for breakfast at eight,"" Joachim said and left.","“At eight o’clock I’ll come fetch you to breakfast,” Joachim said, and went.","“I’ll come by for you for breakfast at eight,” Joachim said and left."
"Es war, wenn man es weniger unternehmend anfing, als er damals getan, nicht gar so weit dorthin. Stieg man vom Ziel der Schlittlrennen in »Dorf« ein wenig die Lehne hinan, so war der malerische Ort auf dem Waldwege, dessen Holzbrücken die von der Schatzalp kommende Bobbahn überkreuzten, ohne Umwege, Operngesang und Erschöpfungspausen in zwanzig Minuten zu erreichen, und wenn Joachim durch dienstliche Pflichten, durch Untersuchung, Innenphotographie, Blutprobe, Injektion oder Gewichtsfeststellung ans Haus gefesselt war, so wanderte Hans Castorp wohl bei heiterer Witterung nach dem zweiten Frühstück, zuweilen auch schon nach dem ersten dorthin, und auch die Stunden zwischen Tee und Abend{585}essen benutzte er wohl zu einem Besuch seines Lieblingsortes, um auf der Bank zu sitzen, wo ihn einst das mächtige Nasenbluten überkommen, dem Geräusche des Gießbachs mit schrägem Kopfe zu lauschen und das geschlossene Landschaftsbild um sich her zu betrachten, sowie die Menge von blauer Akelei, die nun wieder in ihrem Grunde blühte.","It wasn't that far, if you started out less energetically than he did then. If you climbed a little up the Lehne from the finish of the toboggan race in »Dorf«, you could reach the picturesque place on the forest path, whose wooden bridges crossed the bob run coming from the Schatzalp, in twenty minutes without detours, opera singing and breaks of exhaustion, and if Joachim was tied to the house by official duties, by examination, interior photography, blood test, injection or determination of weight, Hans Castorp wandered there when the weather was clear after the second breakfast, sometimes even after the first, and also the hours between tea and evening {585 He probably used his meal to visit his favorite place, to sit on the bench where a mighty nosebleed once overcame him, to listen to the sound of the torrent with his head tilted and to look at the closed landscape around him, as well as the multitude of blue Aquilegia, which was now blooming again in its depths.","It was, if one began it a little less rashly than he had, no great distance thither. If you mounted the slope from the end of the sledge-run in the village, you could reach in some twenty minutes the picturesque spot where the wooden bridge of the path through the forest crossed above the run as it came down from the Schatzalp, provided you kept to the shortest route, did not loiter about, nor pause too long to get your breath. Hans Castorp, when Joachim was detained at home in the service of the cure, for some examination, blood-test, x-ray photography, weighing, or injection, would stroll thither in good weather, after second breakfast, or even after first; or he would employ the hours between tea and dinner in a visit to his favourite spot, to sit on the bench where once the violent nose-bleeding had overtaken him, to listen with bent head to the sound of the torrent and gaze at the secluded scene, with the hosts of blue aquilegias blooming in its depths.","It was not all that far, really, when you went about it a little less impetuously than he had done that day. If you started at the bobsled finish line in Dorf and worked your way up the slope along a forest path with several wooden bridges that crossed the run as it descended from Schatzalp, you could—omitting detours, arias, and exhausted pauses—be there in twenty minutes. And if the weather was good and Joachim was tied up at the Berghof by a checkup, X-ray, blood sample, injection, or weigh-in, Hans Castorp might hike up there after second breakfast, occasionally after first; sometimes he even used the hour between tea and supper for a visit to his favorite spot; and then he would sit down on the same bench where he had had that nasty nosebleed, tilt his head to catch the sound of the rushing brook, and enjoy the closed landscape with its banks of blue columbine blossoming once again in the meadow."
"»Lebe wohl, Mynheer Peeperkorn!« sagte Hans Castorp und stand auf. »Sie sehen, ich überwinde meine berechtigte Scheu und übe mich schon in der tollkühnen Anrede. Richtig, es ist ja finster geworden! Ich könnte mir vorstellen, daß plötzlich Herr Settembrini hereinkäme und das Licht andrehte, damit Vernunft und Gesellschaftlichkeit Platz griffen, – er hat nun einmal die Schwäche. Auf morgen! Ich gehe dermaßen vergnügt und stolz von hier fort, wie ich es mir nicht im entferntesten hätte träumen lassen. Recht gute Besserung! Es kommen nun mindestens drei fieberfreie Tage für dich, an denen Sie allen Anforderungen gewachsen sein werden. Das freut mich, als ob ich Du wäre. Gute Nacht!«","'Farewell, Mynheer Peeperkorn!' said Hans Castorp, standing up. “You see, I've overcome my justifiable shyness and am already practicing the daring form of address. That's right, it's getting dark! I could imagine that Mr. Settembrini would suddenly come in and turn on the light so that reason and sociality could take hold - he has the weakness. Here's to tomorrow! I'm leaving here more happy and proud than I could have ever dreamed. Get well soon! There are now at least three fever-free days for you, on which you will be able to cope with all requirements. That makes me happy as if I were you. Good night!""","“Farewell, Mynheer Peeperkorn,” Hans Castorp said, and rose. “Yes, it has grown dark. I can imagine Herr Settembrini coming in suddenly and turning on the light, to let reason and convention reign—it is a weakness of his. Good-bye until to-morrow. I leave you, so proud, so joyful, as I could never have dreamed it was possible for me to be. And now you will have at least three good days, and free of fever, and that rejoices me as much as though it were myself. Brother, good-night!”","“Fare thee well, Pieter Peeperkorn,” Hans Castorp said and stood up. “You see, I am overcoming my legitimate reserve and am already practicing this rash form of address. True, it has grown quite dark. I could easily imagine Herr Settembrini suddenly bursting in and turning on the light, so that reason and social order might hold sway— it’s one of his weaknesses. Till tomorrow, then. I leave so pleased and proud, beyond my wildest dreams. Do get well. You’ll have at least three days without fever now, and will be able to meet each day’s demands. That delights me as much as if I were you. Good night.”"
"»Na, so eine Art von Unterschied bleibt da ja immerhin. Leben ist, daß im Wechsel der Materie die Form erhalten bleibt.«","'Well, there's still a kind of difference. Life is that the form is preserved in the change of matter.«","“Oh, well, after all, there is some sort of difference. Life is life which keeps the form through change of substance.”","“Well, there’s a certain difference all the same. Life means that the form is retained even though matter is being transformed.” “But why retain the form?”"
"»Nein, warum Abschied?« wich Hans Castorp aus. Er wich nicht nur figürlich aus, mit seinen Worten, sondern auch körperlich, indem er mit dem Oberkörper einen Bogen beschrieb, und hielt sich an die Lehrerin, Fräulein Engelhart, die eben kam, sie zu holen. Der Hofrat verzapfe im Klavierzimmer mit eigener Hand einen Fastnachtspunsch, den die Verwaltung gestiftet habe, meldete sie. Die Herren, sagte sie, möchten gleich kommen, wenn sie auch noch ein Glas zu erwischen wünschten. So gingen sie hinüber.","""No, why farewell?"" Hans Castorp evaded. Not only did he dodge physically, with his words, but also physically, describing an arc with his upper body, and he held on to the teacher, Fraulein Engelhart, who had just come to fetch her. She reported that the privy councilor was pouring a carnival punch with his own hand in the piano room, which the administration had donated. The gentlemen, she said, would like to come right away if they wanted to get a glass too. So they went over.","“A parting? No—why?” Hans Castorp evaded him—not only in words, but in action, for he turned as he spoke, describing a curve with the upper part of his body, and came to a stop before Fräulein Engelhart, who had just entered to fetch them. She said that a carnival punch, contributed by the management, was being dispensed by no less a person than the Hofrat himself, and bade them come if they cared for a glass. So they went together.","“No—why should it be a farewell?” Hans Castorp said, ducking the issue, not just in a metaphorical sense with his words, but also physically, swinging his upper body around in a wide curve and taking the arm of Fräulein Engelhart, who had come to fetch them. The director was personally tapping a bowl of carnival punch that had been donated by the management, she reported. The gentlemen, she said, would have to come with her at once if they hoped to have a glass of it. And so they left together."
"»Nun, es ist genug«, erklärte Herr Settembrini mit leicht bebender Stimme, indem er Tasse und Teller von sich schob, die übrigens leer waren, und sich vom seidenen Sofa erhob. »Es ist genug für heute, genug für einen Tag, wie mir scheint. Professor, wir danken für die schmackhafte Bewirtung, für das sehr spirituelle Gespräch. Meine Freunde vom Berghof hier ruft die Kur, und ich habe den Wunsch, ihnen, bevor sie gehen, meine Klause droben zu zeigen. Kommen Sie, meine Herren! Addio, Padre!«","""Well, that's enough,"" declared Mr. Settembrini in a slightly trembling voice, pushing away his cup and plate, which were empty, and getting up from the silk sofa. 'It's enough for today, enough for one day it seems to me. Professor, we thank you for the tasty hospitality, for the very spiritual conversation. The cure is calling my friends from the Berghof here, and I want to show them my hermitage upstairs before they leave. Come, gentlemen! Addio, Padre!'","“Well, that is enough,” declared Herr Settembrini, in a voice that trembled slightly, pushing away his cup and plate—they were empty by now—and rising from the satin sofa. “Enough for to-day, enough for a whole day, I should think. Our thanks, Professor, for the delicious entertainment, and for the very spirituel discourse. My young friends here from the Berghof are summoned by the service of the cure, and I should like, before they go, to show them my cell up above. Come, gentlemen. Addio, Padre!”","“Well, then, enough,” Herr Settembrini declared with a slight quiver in his voice, pushing his plate and cup away—both empty now—and getting up from the silk sofa. “That is enough for today, enough for any one day, it seems to me. Professor, we thank you both for the tasty hospitality and the very scintillating conversation. The rest cure calls my friends back to the Berghof, but before they go, I would like to show them my monk’s cell upstairs. Come, gentlemen. Addio, padre!”"
"»Die Unverständlichkeit Ihrer Äußerung, Ingenieur,« antwortete ihm Settembrini, »läßt ihre Tadelhaftigkeit durchschimmern. Das Erlebnis des Todes muß zuletzt das Erlebnis des Lebens sein, oder es ist nur ein Spuk.«","""The incomprehensibility of what you said, engineer,"" Settembrini answered him, ""makes your culpability shine through. The experience of death must ultimately be the experience of life, or it is only a spook.""","“Your remark is incomprehensible,” Settembrini answered him, “which doesn’t prevent it from being at the same time silly. Either the experience of death must be the last experience of life, or else it must be a bugaboo, pure and simple.”","“Your statement is incoherent, my good engineer,” Settembrini said in reply, “yet its reprehensibility still shines through. The experience of death must ultimately be the experience of life, or else it is only a wraith.”"
"»Ziehen Sie es trotzdem in Erwägung!« sagte Settembrini lächelnd. »Die Musik ist unschätzbar als letztes Begeisterungsmittel, als aufwärts und vorwärts reißende Macht, wenn sie den Geist für ihre Wirkungen vorgebildet findet. Aber die Literatur muß ihr vorangegangen sein. Musik allein bringt die Welt nicht vorwärts. Musik allein ist gefährlich. Für Sie persönlich, Ingenieur, ist sie unbedingt gefährlich. Ich sah es sofort an Ihren Gesichtszügen, als ich kam.«","""Consider it anyway!"" Settembrini said, smiling. “Music is invaluable as a last resort, as a force that sweeps upwards and forwards, when it finds the spirit preordained for its effects. But literature must have preceded it. Music alone does not move the world forward. Music alone is dangerous. For you personally, engineer, it is absolutely dangerous. I saw it in your features as soon as I came.""","“Pray do not, on that account, refuse to entertain it,” Settembrini said with a smile. “Music, as a final incitement to the spirit of men, is invaluable—as a force which draws onward and upward the spirit she finds prepared for her ministrations. But literature must precede her. By music alone the world would get no further forward. Alone, she is a danger. For you, personally, Engineer, she is beyond all doubt dangerous. I saw it in your face as I came up.”","“Please consider it, nevertheless,” Settembrini said with a smile. “Music is invaluable as the ultimate means for awakening our zeal, a power that draws the mind trained for its effects forward and upward. But literature must precede it. By itself, music cannot draw the world forward. By itself, music is dangerous. And for you in particular, my good engineer, it is absolutely dangerous. I read that at once from your face as I arrived just now.”"
"Spät, nach der Abendgeselligkeit, nach Abzug der Menge, war seine beste Zeit. Dann blieb er im Salon oder kehrte heimlich dorthin zurück und musizierte allein bis tief in die Nacht. Die Ruhe des Hauses damit zu stören, brauchte er weniger zu fürchten, als er anfangs geglaubt hatte tun zu müssen, denn die Tragkraft seiner Geistermusik hatte sich ihm als von geringer {974}Reichweite erwiesen: so Staunenswertes die Schwingungen nahe ihrem Ursprung bewirkten, so bald ermatteten sie, schwach und scheinmächtig wie alles Geisterhafte, ferner von ihm. Hans Castorp war allein mit den Wundern der Truhe in seinen vier Wänden, – mit den blühenden Leistungen dieses gestutzten kleinen Sarges aus Geigenholz, dieses mattschwarzen Tempelchens, vor dessen offener Flügeltür er im Sessel saß, die Hände gefaltet, den Kopf auf der Schulter, den Mund geöffnet, und sich von Wohllaut überströmen ließ.","Late, after the evening social, after deducting the crowd, was his best time. Then he stayed in the salon or returned there secretly and played music alone until late at night. He needn't fear disturbing the peace of the house less than he had initially thought he had to do, because the carrying power of his spirit music had proved to be of short {974}range: as astonishing as the vibrations caused near their origin, so soon they grew weary, weak and illusory like everything ghostly farther from him. Hans Castorp was alone with the wonders of the chest in his four walls, - with the flourishing achievements of this clipped little coffin made of violin wood, this matt black temple, in front of whose open double doors he sat in the armchair, his hands folded, his head on his shoulder, the Mouth opened and let the euphony overflow.","Evening, after the social quarter-hour, when the guests were gone, was his best time. He remained in the salon, or returned stealthily thither, and played until deep in the night. He found there was less danger than he had feared of disturbing the nightly rest of the house; for the carrying power of this ghostly music proved relatively small. The vibrations, so surprisingly powerful in the near neighbourhood of the box, soon exhausted themselves, grew weak and eerie with distance, like all magic. Hans Castorp was alone among four walls with his wonder-box; with the florid performance of this truncated little coffin of violin-wood, this small dull-black temple, before the open double doors of which he sat with his hands folded in his lap, his head on one side, his mouth open, and let the harmonies flow over him.","Late evening, after the social gathering, when the crowd had left, was his best time. Then he would stay behind alone in the salon or stealthily return to play music until well into the night. It turned out he had less reason to fear disturbing the peace than he had first thought, for he found that his ghostly music carried over only a limited range. The vibrations produced amazing effects near their source, but like all ghostly things, quickly languished with distance, grew feeble, their powers merely illusory. Within these four walls, Hans Castorp was alone with the wonders of his apparatus—with the lush achievements of this little truncated coffin of fiddlewood, this small, dull-black temple with its doors flung wide, before which he would sit in an armchair, hands folded, head on one shoulder, mouth open, letting the fullness of harmony spill over him."
"»Ge-statten Sie mir … Ich weiß, was Sie sagen wollen. Sie wollen sagen, daß Sie es so ernst nicht gemeint haben, daß die von Ihnen vertretenen Anschauungen nicht ohne Weiteres die Ihren sind, sondern daß Sie gleichsam nur eine der möglichen und in der Luft schwebenden Anschauungen aufgriffen, um sich unverantwortlicherweise einmal darin zu versuchen. So entspricht es Ihrem Alter, welches männlicher Entschlossenheit noch entraten und vorderhand mit allerlei Standpunkten Versuche anstellen mag. Placet experiri«, sagte er, indem er das c von »Placet« weich, nach italienischer Mundart sprach. »Ein guter Satz. Was mich stutzig macht, ist eben nur die Tatsache, daß Ihr Experiment sich gerade in dieser Richtung bewegt. Ich bezweifle, daß hier Zufall waltet. Ich befürchte das Vorhandensein einer Neigung, die sich charaktermäßig zu befestigen droht, wenn man ihr nicht entgegentritt. Darum fühle ich mich verpflichtet, Sie zu korrigieren. Sie äußerten, Krankheit {151}mit Dummheit gepaart sei das Trübseligste auf der Welt. Ich kann Ihnen das zugeben. Auch mir ist ein geistreicher Kranker lieber als ein schwindsüchtiger Dummkopf. Aber mein Protest beginnt, wenn Sie Krankheit mit Dummheit im Verein gewissermaßen als einen Stilfehler betrachten, als eine Geschmacksverirrung der Natur und ein Dilemma für das menschliche Gefühl, wie Sie sich auszudrücken beliebten. Wenn Sie Krankheit für etwas so Vornehmes und – wie sagten Sie doch – Ehrwürdiges zu halten scheinen, daß sie sich mit Dummheit schlechterdings nicht zusammenreimt. Dies war ebenfalls Ihr Ausdruck. Nun denn, nein! Krankheit ist durchaus nicht vornehm, durchaus nicht ehrwürdig, – diese Auffassung ist selbst Krankheit oder sie führt dazu. Vielleicht rufe ich am sichersten Ihren Abscheu gegen sie wach, wenn ich Ihnen sage, daß sie betagt und häßlich ist. Sie rührt aus abergläubisch zerknirschten Zeiten her, in denen die Idee des Menschlichen zum Zerrbild entartet und entwürdigt war, angstvollen Zeiten, denen Harmonie und Wohlsein als verdächtig und teuflisch galten, während Bresthaftigkeit damals einem Freibrief zum Himmelreich gleichkam. Vernunft und Aufklärung jedoch haben diese Schatten vertrieben, welche auf der Seele der Menschheit lagerten, – noch nicht völlig, sie liegen noch heute im Kampfe mit ihnen; dieser Kampf aber heißt Arbeit, mein Herr, irdische Arbeit, Arbeit für die Erde, für die Ehre und die Interessen der Menschheit, und täglich aufs neue gestählt in solchem Kampfe, werden jene Mächte den Menschen vollends befreien und ihn auf den Wegen des Fortschrittes und der Zivilisation einem immer helleren, milderen und reineren Lichte entgegenleiten.«","“Allow me… I know what you're saying. You want to say that you didn't mean it that seriously, that the views you represent are not necessarily your own, but that you just picked up one of the possible views that were floating in the air in order to irresponsibly try your hand at it. So it corresponds to your age, which still lacks manly determination and may make experiments with all kinds of points of view for the time being. Placet experiri,' he said, pronouncing the c of 'placet' softly, in the Italian dialect. 'A good sentence. What puzzles me is just the fact that your experiment is moving in this direction. I doubt that coincidence rules here. I fear the existence of a tendency that threatens to take root in character if left unchecked. So I feel obliged to correct you. They said that illness {151}paired with stupidity was the saddest thing in the world. I can tell you that. I, too, prefer a witty patient to a consumptive fool. But my protest begins when you regard sickness combined with stupidity as a kind of stylistic error, an aberration in taste of nature, and a dilemma for human feeling, as you choose to express it. If you seem to think of sickness as something so noble and, how did you put it, venerable that it just doesn't go together with stupidity at all. This was also your expression. Well then, no! Illness is by no means noble, by no means venerable - this conception is itself illness, or it leads to it. Perhaps the safest way to arouse your disgust for her is to tell you that she is old and ugly. It stems from superstitious contrite times, in which the idea of what was human was degenerated into a caricature and degraded, anxious times in which harmony and well-being were considered suspicious and devilish, while resilience was then tantamount to a license to the kingdom of heaven. Reason and enlightenment, however, have driven away these shadows that lay on the soul of mankind - not yet completely, they are still fighting with them today; But this fight means work, my lord, earthly work, work for the earth, for the honor and interests of mankind, and hardened daily anew in such a fight, those powers will completely liberate man and set him on the path of progress and lead civilization towards an ever brighter, milder and purer light.«","“Permit me. I know what you would say: that the views you represent are not, of necessity, your own; that you have only chanced upon that one of all the possible ones there are, as it were, in the air, and you try it on, without personal responsibility. It befits your time of life, thus to avoid the settled convictions of the mature man, and to make experiments with a variety of points of view. Placet experiri,” he quoted, giving the Italian pronunciation to the c. “That is a good saying. But what troubles me is that your experiment should lead you in just this direction. I doubt if it is a question of sheer chance. I fear the presence of a general tendency, which threatens to crystallize into a trait of character, unless one makes head against it. I feel it my duty, therefore, to correct you. You said that the sight of dullness and disease going hand in hand must be the most melancholy in life. I grant you, I grant you that. I too prefer an intelligent ailing person to a consumptive idiot. But I take issue where you regard the combination of disease with dullness as a sort of aesthetic inconsistency, an error in taste on the part of nature, a ‘dilemma for the human feelings,’ as you were pleased to express yourself. When you professed to regard disease as something so refined, so— what did you call it?—possessing a ‘certain dignity’—that it doesn’t ‘go with’ stupidity. That was the expression you used. Well, I say no! Disease has nothing refined about it, nothing dignified. Such a conception is in itself pathological, or at least tends in that direction. Perhaps I may best arouse your mistrust of it if I tell you how ancient and ugly this conception is. It comes down to us from a past seething with superstition, in which the idea of humanity had degenerated and deteriorated into sheer caricature; a past full of fears, in which well-being and harmony were regarded as suspect and emanating from the devil, whereas infirmity was equivalent to a free pass to heaven. Reason and enlightenment have banished the darkest of these shadows that tenanted the soul of man—not entirely, for even yet the conflict is in progress. But this conflict, my dear sirs, means work, earthly labour, labour for the earth, for the honour and the interests of mankind; and by that conflict daily steeled anew, the powers of reason and enlightenment will in the end set humanity wholly free and lead it in the path of progress and civilization toward an even brighter, milder, and purer light.”","“Per-mit me, please, to continue. I know what you wish to say. You wish to say that you did not mean to be taken so seriously, that the view you have advocated is not yours per se, but rather merely one possible view out of many hovering in the air, as it were, which you then seized upon in order to have an irresponsible go at it. It is characteristic of your years to eschew manly resolve in favor of temporary experimentation with all sorts of standpoints. Placet experiri,” he said, pronouncing the c of placet with the soft Italian ch. “A fine maxim. But what disconcerts me is simply that your experiment has taken precisely the direction it has. I doubt this is purely accidental. I fear the presence of a tendency that threatens to become an indelible trait of character unless one opposes it head-on. Which is why I feel it my duty to correct you. You suggested that the combination of sickness and stupidity is the most pitiful thing in the world. I will grant you that much. I, too, prefer a clever invalid to a consumptive idiot. But my protest begins at the point where you regard the conjunction of illness and stupidity as a kind of stylistic blunder, as an aberration of taste on the part of nature and a ‘dilemma for our human emotions’—as you chose to express it. At the point where, or so it appears, you consider illness to be so elegant or—as you put it—so ‘venerable’ that there is absolutely ‘no rhyme or reason’ why it and stupidity should belong together. Those, too, are your words. In that case, no! Illness is definitely not elegant, and certainly not venerable—such a view is itself a sickness, or leads to it. Perhaps I can best arouse your abhorrence of that idea by telling you that it is outdated and ugly. It comes from an era of superstitious contrition, when the idea of humanity was demeaned and distorted into a caricature, a fearful era, when harmony and health were considered suspicious and devilish, whereas infirmity in those days was as good as a passport to heaven. Reason and enlightenment, however, have banished those shadows, which once lay encamped in the human soul—not entirely, however, for even today the battle is still being waged. That battle, however, is called work, sir, earthly labor, work for the earth, for the honor and interests of humankind. And steeled by each new day in battle, the powers of reason and enlightenment will liberate the human race entirely and lead it forth on paths of progress and civilization toward an ever brighter, milder, and purer light.”"
"Wehsal, der zugezogen wurde, teilte mit, Naphta habe sich schon geäußert, nämlich dahin, er wolle keinen Arzt. Er gehe an jenen Ort nicht, um sich salben und wickeln zu lassen, sondern um sich zu schlagen und zwar sehr ernsthaft. Was nachher komme, sei ihm gleichgültig und werde sich finden. Das schien eine finstere Kundgebung, die aber Hans Castorp so zu deuten sich bemühte, als sei Naphta der stillen Meinung, ein Arzt werde nicht nötig sein. Hatte nicht auch Settembrini durch den zu ihm entsandten Ferge sagen lassen, man solle die Frage absetzen, sie interessiere ihn nicht? Es war nicht ganz unvernünftig, zu hoffen, die Gegner möchten im Grunde einig sein in dem Vorsatz, es zu keinem Blutvergießen kommen zu lassen. Man hatte zweimal geschlafen seit jenem Wortwechsel und würde es ein drittes Mal tun. Das kühlt, das klärt, dem Zuge der Stunden hält eine bestimmte Gemütsverfassung nicht ungewandelt stand. Morgen früh, das Schießzeug in der Hand, würde keiner der Streitbaren noch der Mann sein, der er am Abend des Zwistes gewesen. Höchstens mechanisch noch und ehrenzwangsweise, nicht nach gegenwärtigem freien Willen würden sie handeln, wie sie damals aus Lust und Überzeugung gehandelt hätten; und eine solche Verleugnung ihres aktuellen Selbst zugunsten dessen, was sie einmal gewesen, mußte sich irgendwie ja verhüten lassen!","Wehsal, who was called in, said Naphta had already said he didn't want a doctor. He does not go to that place to be anointed and swaddled, but to be beaten and very seriously. He doesn't care what comes after and will find out. It seemed a sinister statement, but Hans Castorp tried to interpret it as if Naphta was of the quiet opinion that a doctor would not be necessary. Hadn't Settembrini also sent word to Ferge, who had been sent to see him, that the question should be dropped, he wasn't interested in it? It was not entirely unreasonable to hope that the opponents would be fundamentally united in their resolve not to shed blood. They had slept twice since that exchange and would do it a third time. That cools, that clarifies, the course of the hours does not withstand a certain state of mind unchanged. Tomorrow morning, gun in hand, would be none of the quarrelsome, nor the man he was on the night of the quarrel. At most they would act mechanically and under the obligation of honor, not according to present free will, as they would have acted then out of pleasure and conviction; and such a denial of her actual self in favor of what she once was had to be prevented somehow!","Wehsal, who was present, announced that Naphta had already expressed himself to the effect that he wanted no doctor. He was not going to the meeting-place to be salved and bandaged, but to lay about him, and that in grim earnest. It sounded a sinister declaration enough; but Hans Castorp tried to interpret it as meaning that Naphta felt there would be no need of a physician. Ferge too bore back a message from Herr Settembrini, that they might dispose of the question , it did not interest him. It was thus not unreasonable to hope that both antagonists had resolved not to let it come to the shedding of blood. Two nights had passed since the quarrel, and there would be yet a third. Time cools, time clarifies; no mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours. In the early dawn, standing weapon in hand, neither of the combatants would be the same man as on the evening of the quarrel. They would be going through it, if at all, mechanically, in obedience to the demands of honour, not, as they would have at first, of their own free will, desire, and conviction; and such a denial of their actual selves in favour of their past ones, it must somehow be possible to prevent.","Wehsal, who was brought in for consultation, informed them that Naphta had stated he did not want a doctor present. He was not going up there to be salved and bandaged, but to engage in the fray, and with serious intent. He did not care what happened afterward, what would be would be. That sounded like a rather grim pronouncement, but Hans Castorp tried to interpret it to mean that Naphta secretly believed no doctor would be needed. And had not Settembrini also let it be known by way of Ferge that they should set the question aside, that it did not interest him? It was not too unreasonable to hope that the adversaries were agreed in their intention not to let it come to actual bloodletting. They had both had two nights to sleep on it since their exchange, and would have yet a third. Tempers cool, minds clear, certain moods do not remain unaltered with the passage of time. The next morning, pistol in hand, neither of the combatants would be the same man he had been on the evening of their quarrel. At worst, they would go through the motions, meet the demands of honor, but not act on the fleeting urges of free will, not behave out of conviction and passion as they had then. Somehow it had to be possible to prevent them from denying their real selves just to indulge the selves they had displayed in Monstein."
"Das war mit Bedeutung gesagt, unzweifelhaft. Hans Castorp betrat in Verwirrung sein Zimmer. Wußte Settembrini, wie es um ihn stand? Wahrscheinlich hatte er ihm erzieherisch nach{340}gespürt und die Wege verfolgt, die seine Augen gingen. Hans Castorp war zornig auf den Italiener und auch auf sich selbst, weil er unbeherrschterweise den Stich herausgefordert hatte. Während er sein Schreibzeug zusammensuchte, um es mit in die Liegekur zu nehmen – denn nun galt kein Zögern mehr, der Brief nach Hause, der dritte, wollte geschrieben sein –, fuhr er fort, sich zu ärgern, murmelte dies und das vor sich hin gegen diesen Windbeutel und Räsonneur, der sich in Dinge mischte, die ihn nichts angingen, während er selbst die Mädchen auf der Straße anträllerte, – und fühlte sich zu der schriftlichen Arbeit gar nicht mehr aufgelegt, – dieser Drehorgelmann hatte ihm mit seinen Anspielungen förmlich die Stimmung dazu verdorben. Aber so oder so, er mußte Winterzeug haben, Geld, Wäsche, Schuhwerk, kurz alles, was er mitgenommen haben würde, wenn er gewußt hätte, daß er nicht für drei Hochsommerwochen, sondern … sondern für eine noch unbestimmte Frist kam, die aber jedenfalls ein Stück in den Winter hineinreichen, ja, wie bei Uns hier oben die Begriffe und Zeitverhältnisse nun einmal waren, ihn wohl gar einschließen würde. Dies eben wollte, wenigstens als Möglichkeit, nach Hause mitgeteilt sein. Es galt diesmal ganze Arbeit zu tun, Denen dort unten reinen Wein einzuschenken und weder sich noch ihnen länger etwas vorzumachen …","That was said with meaning, undoubtedly. Hans Castorp entered his room in confusion. Did Settembrini know how things were with him? He probably traced him educationally and followed the paths his eyes took. Hans Castorp was angry with the Italian and also with himself for uncontrollably inviting the stab. While he gathered his writing things to take with him to the rest cure – because now there was no more hesitation, the letter home, the third, had to be written – he continued to get angry, mumbling this and that to himself against this windbag and reasoner, who meddled in things that did not concern him while he himself sang at the girls in the street - and no longer felt in the mood for the written work - this barrel-organ man literally had him with his allusions mood spoiled. But one way or the other, he had to have winter gear, money, underwear, shoes, in short, everything he would have taken with him if he had known that he was not coming for three midsummer weeks, but ... but for an undetermined period of time, but that anyway extend a bit into the winter, yes, as the concepts and time conditions were with us up here, would probably even include it. This, at least as a possibility, wanted to be communicated home. This time there was a lot of work to be done, to give those down there the right wine and not to fool yourself or them any longer ...","He had said that of malice aforethought, undoubtedly. Hans Castorp walked into his own room in confusion. Was Settembrini aware of his state? Very likely, like the schoolmaster he was, he had been spying on him, and seen which way his eyes were going. Hans Castorp was angry with the Italian and also with himself, for having by his lack of self-control invited the thrust. He took up his writing materials to carry them with him into the balcony—for now it was no more use; the letter home, the third letter, must be written—and as he did so he went on whipping up his anger, muttering to himself about this windbag and logic chopper, who meddled with matters that were no concern of his, and chirruped to the girls in the street. He felt quite disinclined to the effort of writing, the organ-grinder had put him off it altogether, with his innuendo. But no matter what his feelings, he must have winter clothing, money, footwear, linen—in brief, everything he might have brought with him had he known he was coming, not for three short summer weeks, but for an indefinite stay which was certain to last for a piece into the winter—or rather, considering the notions about time current up here, was quite likely to last all the winter. It was this he must let them know at home, even if only as a possibility; he must tell the whole story, and not put them, or himself, off any longer with pretexts.","No doubt about it, he had meant something by that. Hans Castorp entered his room in confusion. Did Settembrini know what was going on with him? Presumably he had been spying on him for educational reasons, taking careful note of where his eyes were directed. Hans Castorp was angry at the Italian, and at himself, too, because it was his own lack of self-control that had provoked the gibe. He gathered up some writing materials to take out with him for his rest cure—because there could be no more delays, a letter home, his third, would have to be written—and went on being angry, muttering things about this windbag and quibbler, who was sticking his nose into things that were none of his business, but who hummed little songs at girls in public. By now, he no longer felt like taking up the task of writing. This organ-grinder and his insinuations had definitely spoiled the mood for it. But one way or the other, he had to have winter clothes, money, underwear, shoes—everything, in fact, that he would have brought with him had he known he would be here not for just three weeks at the height of summer, but . . . but for a still-undetermined period, which, no matter what, was sure to last into some of winter, indeed, given assumptions and circumstances up here, would very probably include the whole season. And that, or at least the possibility of it, would have to be shared with his family. It would require real work this time—making a clean breast of things and no longer pretending otherwise to himself or them."
Das gab eine Pause. Die Vettern zeigten größte Betroffenheit. Hans Castorp rief:,That gave a pause. The cousins showed great dismay. Hans Castorp shouted:,A pause ensued. The cousins displayed the greatest astonishment. Hans Castorp cried out: “What! Good,There was a pause. The cousins were obviously taken aback. “What? Good God in heaven!” Hans Castorp exclaimed.
"Das mag abenteuerlich klingen, ist aber so weit entfernt, unerhört oder unwahrscheinlich zu sein, daß es vielmehr unter bestimmten Bedingungen jederzeit jedem von uns begegnen kann: nichts würde uns, solche Bedingungen vorausgesetzt, vor dem Versinken in tiefste Unwissenheit über den Zeitverlauf und also über unser Alter bewahren. Die Erscheinung ist möglich kraft des Fehlens jedes Zeitorgans in unserem Innern, kraft also unserer absoluten Unfähigkeit, den Ablauf der Zeit von uns aus und ohne äußeren Anhalt auch nur mit annähernder Zuverlässigkeit zu bestimmen. Bergleute, verschüttet, abgeschnitten von jeder Beobachtung des Wechsels von Tag und Nacht, veranschlagten bei ihrer glücklichen Errettung die Zeit, die sie im Dunklen, zwischen Hoffnung und Verzweiflung zugebracht hatten, auf drei Tage. Es waren deren zehn gewesen. Man sollte meinen, daß in ihrer höchst beklommenen Lage die Zeit ihnen hätte lang werden müssen. Sie war ihnen auf weniger als ein Drittel ihres objektiven Umfanges zusammengeschrumpft. Es scheint demnach, daß unter verwirrenden Bedingungen die menschliche Hilflosigkeit eher geneigt ist, die Zeit in starker Verkürzung zu erleben, als sie zu überschätzen.","This may sound fantastic, but it is so far from being unheard of or improbable that it can happen to any of us at any time under certain conditions: nothing would save us, assuming such conditions, from sinking into deepest ignorance about the passage of time and therefore about preserve our age. The phenomenon is possible by virtue of the absence of any organ of time within us, that is, by virtue of our absolute inability to determine the passage of time from within ourselves and without any external reference, even with approximate reliability. Miners, buried, cut off from any observation of the alternation of day and night, estimated the time they had spent in the dark, between hope and despair, at their lucky rescue at three days. There had been ten of them. One would think that in their most distressed position they should have had a long time. It had shrunk to less than a third of its objective size. It seems, then, that under bewildering conditions human helplessness is more apt to experience time greatly reduced than to overestimate it.","All which may sound preposterous; yet there are conditions under which nothing could keep us from losing account of the passage of time, losing account even of our own age; lacking, as we do, any trace of an inner time-organ, and being absolutely incapable of fixing it even with an approach to accuracy by ourselves, without any outward fixed points as guides. There is a case of a party of miners, buried and shut off from every possibility of knowing the passage of day or night, who told their rescuers that they estimated the time they had spent in darkness, flickering between hope and fear, to be some three days. It had actually been ten. Their high state of suspense might, one would think, have made the time seem longer to them than it actually was, whereas it shrank to less than a third of its objective length. It would appear, then, that under conditions of bewilderment man is likely to under-rather than over-estimate time.","That may sound bizarre, but it is far from improbable or unprecedented, and given certain conditions it can happen to any of us at any time; under such conditions, nothing could prevent us from sinking into profound ignorance about the passage of time and so about our own age. The phenomenon is possible because we lack an internal organ for time, because, that is, if left on our own without external clues, we are totally incapable of even approximate reliability when estimating elapsed time. A group of miners buried by a cave-in, and cut off from observing the sequence of day and night, were rescued at last and guessed the period of time they had spent in the dark, between hope and despair, at three days. And it had been ten. One would think that in such an agonizing situation time would have had to have seemed longer to them. And yet it had shrunk to less than a third of its objective proportions. And judging from that, it appears that under confusing conditions, man in his helplessness tends to experience time in a greatly diminished form rather than to overestimate it."
"»Ja, dazu hat sie wohl eine Neigung. Und so viel kann ich dir zugeben«, setzte Hans Castorp an und wollte eben auf die Chaldäer zurückkommen, die ebenfalls Krieg geführt und Babylonien erobert hätten, obgleich sie Semiten und also beinahe Juden gewesen seien, – als beide gleichzeitig gewahr wurden, daß zwei Herren, die dicht vor ihnen gingen, die Köpfe nach ihnen wandten, aufmerksam gemacht durch ihre Reden, gestört in eigener Unterhaltung.","'Yes, she seems to have a tendency to do that. And I can admit that much,« Hans Castorp began and was just about to return to the Chaldeans, who had also waged war and conquered Babylonia, although they were Semites and therefore almost Jews - when both realized at the same time that two masters , who walked close in front of them, turned their heads towards them, attracted attention by their speeches, disturbed in their own conversation.","“Yes, it has a tendency that way, I admit. And I’ll go so far as to say,” began Hans Castorp, and was about to return to the Chaldeans, who had carried on wars too, and conquered Babylonia, even if they were a Semitic people, which was almost the same as saying they were Jews—when the cousins became simultaneously aware that two gentlemen, walking close in front of them, had been attracted by what they were saying and interrupted their own conversation to look around.","“Yes, it has that tendency. I’ll grant you that much,” Hans Castorp added, intending to return to the Chaldeans, who had also waged war and conquered Babylon, although they were Semites, and so practically Jews—when both of them at the same time noticed two gentlemen just ahead, who had heard them talking and interrupted their conversation now to turn and look back."
"Am doppelten Schreibtisch vorm Fenster saß Dr. Krokowski, bleich gegen sein schwarzes Lüsterhemd, die Ellenbogen auf der Platte, in der einen Hand die Feder, die andere im Bart, vor sich Papiere, wahrscheinlich den Krankenakt, und blickte den Eintretenden mit dem stumpfen Ausdruck einer Persönlichkeit, die nur assistierenderweise anwesend ist, entgegen.","At the double desk in front of the window sat Dr. Krokowski, pale against his black chandelier shirt, elbows on the platter, pen in one hand, beard in the other, papers in front of him, probably the medical record, and looked at the newcomer with the dull expression of a personality who is only present as an assistant , opposite.","Dr. Krokowski was sitting at the double-barrelled writing-table by the window. He wore his usual black alpaca shirt, setting off the pallor of his face; his elbows rested on the table, in one hand a pen, the other fingering his beard; while before him lay various papers, probably the documents in reference to the patients to be examined. He looked at the cousins as they entered, but it was with the idle glance of a person who is present only in an auxiliary capacity.","At the double desk beside the window sat Dr. Krokowski, looking pale against his shiny black smock—elbows propped on the desktop, a pen in one hand, the other buried in his beard. There were papers spread out before him, the patient’s records presumably, and as the two men entered, he looked up at them with the dulled expression of a distinguished personage who is there merely to assist."

"Es war sonderbar, was die beiden Tischnachbarn da trieben. Beide wußten, daß sie doppelt und dreifach logen, daß Hans Castorp nur, um von Frau Chauchat sprechen zu können, die Lehrerin mit ihr neckte, dabei aber ein ungesundes und übertragenes Vergnügen darin fand, mit dem alten Mädchen zu schäkern, – welches ihrerseits darauf einging: erstens aus kupplerischen Gründen, dann auch, weil sie sich dem jungen Manne zu Gefallen wohl wirklich etwas in Frau Chauchat vergafft hatte, und endlich, weil sie es kümmerlich genoß, sich irgend{212}wie von ihm necken und rot machen zu lassen. Dies wußten sie beide von sich und vom anderen und wußten auch, daß jeder es von sich und vom anderen wisse, und das alles war verwickelt und unsauber. Aber obgleich Hans Castorp von verwickelten und unsauberen Dingen im ganzen angewidert wurde und sich auch in diesem Falle davon angewidert fühlte, so fuhr er doch fort, in dem trüben Elemente zu plätschern, indem er sich zur Beruhigung sagte, daß er ja nur zu Besuch hier oben sei und demnächst wieder abreisen werde. Mit erkünstelter Sachlichkeit beurteilte er kennerhaft das Äußere der »lässigen« Frau, stellte fest, daß sie von vorn gesehen entschieden jünger und hübscher wirke als im Profil, daß ihre Augen zu weit auseinander lägen und ihre Haltung viel zu wünschen übriglasse, wofür allerdings ihre Arme schön und »weich geformt« seien. Und indem er dies sagte, suchte er das Zittern seines Kopfes zu verbergen, wobei er aber nicht nur erkennen mußte, daß die Lehrerin seine vergebliche Anstrengung bemerkte, sondern auch mit dem größten Widerwillen die Wahrnehmung machte, daß sie selber ebenfalls mit dem Kopfe zitterte. Auch war es nichts als Politik und unnatürliche Schlauheit gewesen, daß er Frau Chauchat als »schöne Minka« bezeichnet hatte; denn so konnte er weiter fragen:","It was strange what the two table neighbors were doing there. Both knew that they lied twofold and threefold, that Hans Castorp only teased the teacher in order to be able to speak of Frau Chauchat, but at the same time found an unhealthy and transferred pleasure in flirting with the old girl - which in turn followed firstly for procuring reasons, then also because she had really fallen in love with Mrs. Chauchat to please the young man, and finally because she miserably enjoyed being teased and turned red in some way by him . They both knew this about themselves and each other and also knew that everyone knew it about themselves and each other, and it was all complicated and messy. But although Hans Castorp was on the whole disgusted by intricate and untidy matters, and felt disgusted by them in this case too, he went on splashing about in the gloomy element, reassuring himself that he was only here on a visit upstairs and will be leaving again soon. With feigned objectivity, he expertly assessed the ""lazy"" woman's appearance, noting that seen from the front she looked decidedly younger and prettier than in profile, that her eyes were too wide apart, and that her posture left much to be desired, although her arms did be beautiful and ""softly shaped."" And as he said this, he tried to hide the trembling of his head, not only realizing that the teacher noticed his futile effort, but also noticed with the greatest reluctance that she herself was trembling with her head. Also, it had been nothing but politics and unnatural cleverness that he had called Frau Chauchat ""beautiful Minka""; because then he could continue to ask:","It was an extraordinary game the two of them were playing; each perfectly aware that they lied and double-lied, each knowing that Hans Castorp teased the schoolmistress only in order to be able to talk about Frau Chauchat. He took a morbid and extravagant pleasure in thus trifling with Fräulein Engelhart, and she on her side reciprocated; first out of a natural instinct to be the go-between in a love-affair, secondly because to oblige Hans Castorp she had actually contrived to fall victim to Frau Chauchat’s charms; and finally because she felt a pathetic joy in having him tease her and make her blush. He well knew, and she well knew, all this about each other and themselves; each knew that the other knew and that the whole situation was equivocal and almost questionable. Equivocal and questionable situations were, in general, repugnant to Hans Castorp’s taste, and the present one was no exception. He felt disgusted, yet for all that he went on fishing in these troubled waters, quieting his conscience with the assurance that he was only up here on a visit and would soon be leaving. He pronounced upon the young woman’s charms with the air of a connoisseur; said she was “sloppy,” that she looked younger and prettier full face than profile; that her eyes were too far apart; that she carried herself in a way that left much to be desired; that her arms, on the other hand, were pretty and soft-looking. He felt his head shaking as he talked; he tried to suppress the trembling, and realized not only that the schoolmistress must see his efforts, but, with profound disgust, that her head was actually shaking too! But he went on—he had purposely called Frau Chauchat Mistress Mary, in order that he might put the question of her name; so now he said: “I suppose her name is not Mary at all; do you know what it is?","What a strange game these two tablemates were playing. Both of them knew that their lies had double and triple twists—that Hans Castorp teased the teacher just so he could talk about Frau Chauchat, but that at the same time he took unwholesome delight in flirting with the old maid; and that for her part, she welcomed all this: first, because it allowed her to play the matchmaker, and second, because she probably had become smitten with Frau Chauchat, if only to please the young man, and finally, because she took some kind of wretched pleasure in being teased and made to blush. They both knew this about themselves and each other, and they also knew that each of them knew this about themselves and one another—and that it was all tangled and squalid. But although Hans Castorp was usually repelled by tangled and squalid affairs and even felt repelled in this instance as well, he continued to splash about in these murky waters, taking consolation in the certainty that he was here only on a visit and would soon be leaving. Affecting a businesslike tone, he offered his expert opinion about the appearance of this “careless” woman, that she looked decidedly younger and prettier in full face than in profile, that her eyes were set too far apart, that her posture left a great deal to be desired, although he did have to admit that her arms were beautiful and “softly formed.” And as he was saying all this, he attempted to hide his wobbling head—and all the while he was not only aware that the teacher had spotted his futile attempts to do so, but he also realized to his profound disgust that she, too, suffered from the same tremor. It was also a purely political tactic, a bit of unnatural cunning, that he had called Frau Chauchat “lovely Minka,” since it allowed him to continue: “I call her ‘Minka,’ although I don’t know what her real name is, actually."
"»Das machst du ja ausgezeichnet«, sagte Hans Castorp.","""You're doing excellently,"" said Hans Castorp.",“How well you do that!” Hans Castorp said.,"“You do that very well,” Hans Castorp said."
Beide verwunderten sich aufs höchste.,Both were amazed.,The cousins were aghast.,They were both totally taken aback.
»Du steckst heute voller Poesie und Versen. Was ist nun das wieder für eine Lilli? War Adam also zweimal verheiratet? Ich hatte keine Ahnung …«,"“You are full of poetry and verse today. What kind of Lilli is that again? So was Adam married twice? I had no Idea …""","Hans Castorp said—and he too addressed his companion with the licence of the season, and said thou to him: “Dear me, you’re full of poetry to-night. What Lily do you mean? Did Adam marry more than once? I didn’t know it.”","“You’re full of poetry and verses this evening,” Hans Castorp said. “What’s all this about Lilli? You mean Adam was married twice? That’s the first I’ve heard of it.”"
"Hans Castorp maß 37,7 nach dem Empfang dieser Nachricht. Weit mehr noch, als die Besuche, die Frau Chauchat empfing, schmerzten und beunruhigten ihn diejenigen, die sie machte. Frau Chauchats Privat- und Eigenleben als solches an und für sich und schon unabhängig von seinem Inhalt hatte angefangen, ihm Schmerz und Unruhe zu bereiten, und wie sehr mußte sich beides erst verschärfen, da ihm Mehrdeutigkeiten über {318}diesen Inhalt zu Ohren kamen! Zwar schien es allgemein möglich, daß die Beziehungen des russischen Besuchers zu seiner Landsmännin nüchterner und harmloser Natur waren; aber Hans Castorp war seit einiger Zeit geneigt, Nüchternheit und Harmlosigkeit für Schnickschnack zu halten, – wie er sich denn auch nicht überwinden oder bereden konnte, die Ölmalerei als Beziehung zwischen einem forsch redenden Witwer und einer schmaläugig-leisetreterischen jungen Frau für etwas anderes anzusehen. Der Geschmack, den der Hofrat mit der Wahl seines Modells bekundete, entsprach zu sehr seinem eigenen, als daß er hier an Nüchternheit hätte glauben können, worin ihn die Vorstellung von des Hofrats blauen Backen und seinen rot geäderten Quellaugen denn auch nur wenig unterstützte.","Hans Castorp measured 37.7 after receiving this message. Far more than the visits Mrs. Chauchat received, those she made grieved and troubled him. Mrs. Chauchat's private and personal life as such in and of itself and independently of its content had begun to cause him pain and uneasiness, and how much both must first become more acute, since ambiguities about {318}this content reached his ears! To be sure, it seemed generally possible that the relations of the Russian visitor to his compatriot were of a sober and harmless nature; but Hans Castorp had for some time been inclined to regard sobriety and harmlessness as frills - just as he could not bring himself or persuade himself to regard oil painting as the relationship between a brisk-talking widower and a narrow-eyed, soft-spoken young woman as something else. The taste that the privy councilor expressed in his choice of model corresponded too closely to his own for him to believe in sobriety, in which the idea of the privy councilor's blue cheeks and red-veined bulging eyes did little to help him.","Hans Castorp measured 99.7° as a result of this communication. The visits Frau Chauchat received upset him far less than these she made. Her personal and private life—quite aside from what went on in it—had begun to be a source of anguish and unrest; how much keener, then, were his feelings when he heard such questionable things about the way she spent her time! Speaking generally, it was altogether possible that her relations with the Russian visitor had a disinterested and harmless character. But Hans Castorp had been for some time now inclined to reject harmless and disinterested explanations as being in the nature of “twaddle”; nor could he regard in any other light this oil-painting, considered as a bond of interest between a widower with a robust vocabulary and a narrow-eyed, soft-stepping young female. The taste displayed by the Hofrat in his choice of a model was too like Hans Castorp’s own for him to put great faith in the disinterested character of the affair, and the thought of the Hofrat’s purple cheeks and bloodshot, goggling eyes only strengthened his scepticism.","Immediately after hearing this news, Hans Castorp took his temperature—it was 99.9 degrees. He was far more worried and pained by the visits that Frau Chauchat paid than by those she received. Her private life—as a topic in and of itself and apart from what happened in it—had already begun to cause him pain and worry, and those same feelings could only intensify once rumors reached him of what was actually happening in her life. Granted, it was perfectly likely that the relationship between the Russian visitor and his countrywoman was quite sober and harmless; but for some time now, Hans Castorp had found himself regarding sobriety and harmlessness as twiddle-twaddle—just as he could not convince himself that oil painting was anything but an excuse for a relationship between an overenergetic, garrulous widower and a narrow-eyed, pussyfooting young woman. The taste the director displayed in his choice of models corresponded all too closely to his own for him to believe there was anything sober about it—and to reinforce his opinion, he needed only to picture the director’s purple cheeks and bloodshot pop-eyes."
"Alle erstarrten. War das ein Überfall? Stand Dr. Krokowski draußen, um die verbotene Sitzung aufzuheben? Man schaute betreten, man gewärtigte den Eintritt des Hintergangenen. Da schlug es krachend mitten auf den Tisch, wiederum wie mit voller Faust und gleichsam um klarzustellen, daß auch der erste Schlag nicht von außen, sondern von innen gefallen war.","Everyone froze. Was that a robbery? booth dr Krokowski out to lift banned session? One looked embarrassed, one expected the entry of the betrayed. Then it hit the middle of the table with a bang, again as if with a full fist and as it were to make it clear that the first blow had not fallen from the outside but from the inside.","They all jumped. Was it a surprise? Was Dr. Krokowski standing without, come to break up the forbidden session? They looked up guiltily, expecting the betrayed one to enter. But then came a crashing knock on the middle of the table, as if to testify that the first knock too had come from the inside and not the outside of the room.","They all froze. Was it a raid? Was Dr. Krokowski standing out there ready to break up their forbidden meeting? They stared at one another in chagrin, waiting for the outmaneuvered assistant to enter. But then came a bang from the middle of the table, another thump of a fist, as if to make clear that the first knock, too, had not come from the hall, but from inside the room."
"Nun, so viel, meinte Hans Castorp, war absolut zuzugeben, daß innerhalb des Gegensatzes von Körper und Geist der Körper zweifellos das böse, teuflische Prinzip … verkörperte, haha, also verkörperte, insofern als der Körper natürlich Natur war – natürlich Natur, das war auch nicht schlecht! – und als die Natur in ihrem Gegensatz zum Geiste, zur Vernunft entschieden böse war, – mystisch böse, so konnte man sagen, wenn man auf Grund seiner Bildung und seiner Kenntnisse etwas riskierte. Diesen Gesichtspunkt festgehalten, war es dann aber nur folgerecht, den Körper dementsprechend zu behandeln, nämlich ihm Disziplinierungsmittel angedeihen zu lassen, die man ebenfalls, wenn man noch einmal etwas riskierte, als mystisch {687}böse bezeichnen konnte. Vielleicht, daß Herr Settembrini, wenn er damals, als die Schwäche seines Körpers ihn gehindert hatte, zum Fortschrittskongreß nach Barcelona zu fahren, eine heilige Elisabeth zur Seite gehabt hätte …","Well, that much, thought Hans Castorp, was absolutely to be admitted, that within the antithesis of body and mind, the body undoubtedly embodied the evil, devilish principle ... embodied, ha ha, embodied, inasmuch as the body was naturally nature - naturally nature, that was not bad either! - and when nature, in its opposition to spirit, to reason, was decidedly evil - mystically evil, one could say if one risked something on the basis of one's education and knowledge. Holding on to this point of view, it was then only logical to treat the body accordingly, namely to bestow upon it means of disciplining which, if one again risked something, could also be described as mystically {687}evil. Perhaps Mr. Settembrini, if he had had a Saint Elizabeth at his side when the weakness of his body prevented him from going to Barcelona for the Congress of Progress...","Well, anyhow, Hans Castorp considered, so much was granted: that in the antithesis between body and soul it was undoubtedly the body which embodied—the body embodied, that wasn’t so bad, was it?—the evil principle; in so far as the body was naturally nature—pretty good, too, that!—and nature, being diametrically opposed to the spirit and reason, was by that fact intrinsically evil— mystically evil, one might say, if it didn’t sound like showing off! But it followed from this that the body should be treated accordingly, and made to profit from disciplinary methods, which might also be called mystically evil. Herr Settembrini, for instance, that time when the weakness of the flesh had prevented him from attending the Congress for the Advancement of Civilization at Barcelona, ought to have had a Saint Elizabeth at his side—!","Well, in any case, Hans Castorp remarked, it was absolutely certain that within the polarity of body and mind, the body doubtless embodied—ha ha—embodied the evil, devilish principle, because the body was part of nature, naturally—naturally part of nature, that wasn’t bad, either—and nature, in contradistinction to the mind, to reason, was doubtless evil— mystically evil, one might say, if one dared employ a little of one’s education and knowledge. And having once established that point of view, it was only logical, then, to treat the body accordingly, to bestow upon it certain disciplinary methods, which, if one dared take another risk, might likewise be called mystically evil. Perhaps, if Herr Settembrini had had a Saint Elizabeth at his side back then, when the infirmities of his body had prevented him from attending the convention for progress in Barcelona, why then . . ."
"Joachim fragte, ob die Ärzte schon durchgekommen seien. Ja, zum erstenmal seien sie dagewesen, antwortete jemand, – sie hätten den Saal verlassen fast in dem Augenblick, als die Vettern gekommen seien. Dann wollten sie gehen und nicht warten, meinte Joachim. Eine Gelegenheit zur Vorstellung werde sich im Laufe des Tages ja finden. Aber an der Tür wären sie fast mit Hofrat Behrens zusammengestoßen, der, gefolgt von Dr. Krokowski, im Geschwindschritt hereinkam.","Joachim asked if the doctors had come through yet. Yes, they had been there for the first time, someone answered, - they had left the room almost as soon as the cousins had arrived. Then they wanted to go and not wait, said Joachim. There will be an opportunity to introduce yourself during the day. But at the door they almost collided with Hofrat Behrens, who, followed by Dr. Krokowski, came in at a brisk pace.","Joachim asked whether the doctors had come through. Yes, someone answered, they had been there once and left the room just as the cousins entered. Then it would be better not to wait, Joachim thought. An opportunity for introducing his cousin would surely come in the course of the day. But at the door they nearly ran into Hofrat Behrens, as he entered with hasty steps, followed by Dr. Krokowski.","Joachim asked whether the doctors had been through yet. Yes, they had been there once already, someone replied, but had left the dining hall at almost the same moment the cousins arrived. Then they might as well not wait, Joachim said. There would be an opportunity in the course of the day to make the introductions. But at the door they almost collided with Director Behrens, who came striding through it at high speed, followed by Dr. Krokowski."
"{127}»Hältst du es für möglich,« fragte Hans Castorp, »daß er Ernst macht mit seiner ›glatten Sache‹, wie er sich ausdrückt, und sich einen Fremdkörper appliziert?«","{127}""Do you think it's possible,"" asked Hans Castorp, ""that he is serious about his 'slippery business', as he puts it, and applies a foreign body to himself?""","“Do you think he would really do it—put a bullet into himself? It’s a ‘very simple matter,’ to use his own words.”","“Do you really think it possible,” Hans Castorp asked, “that he’s serious about applying that foreign object, ‘slick as a whistle,’ as he puts it?”"
"»Das«, antwortete Behrens, »ist eine organisierte Injektionsspritze. Oder, anders herum aufgefaßt, eine mechanische Kopie des Beißzeugs der Brillenschlange. Sie verstehen? – Sie scheinen nicht zu verstehen«, sagte er, da Hans Castorp fortfuhr, benommen auf das bizarre Instrument niederzublicken. »Das sind die Zähne. Sie sind nicht ganz massiv, sie sind von einem Haarrohr, einem ganz feinen Kanal durchzogen, dessen Austritt Sie hier vorn etwas oberhalb der Spitzen ganz deutlich sehen können. Natürlich sind die Röhrchen auch hier an der Zahnwurzel offen, und da kommunizieren sie mit dem Ausführungsgang der Gummidrüse, der in dem elfenbeinernen Mittelteil verläuft. Beim Zubiß federn die Zähne etwas einwärts, das ist deutlich, und üben auf das Reservoir einen Druck, der den Inhalt in die Kanäle preßt, so daß in dem Augenblick, wo die Spitzen ins Fleisch fassen, die Dosis auch schon in die Blutbahn schießt. Es ist ganz einfach, wenn man es so vor Augen hat. Man muß nur darauf kommen. Wahrscheinlich ist es nach seinen persönlichen Angaben hergestellt.«","'That,' answered Behrens, 'is an organized hypodermic syringe. Or, to put it the other way round, a mechanical copy of the spectacled snake's teeth. You understand? – You don't seem to understand,' he said, as Hans Castorp continued to gaze dazedly down at the bizarre instrument. “Those are the teeth. They are not quite massive, they are traversed by a hair tube, a very fine canal, the exit of which you can clearly see here in front a little above the tips. Of course, the tubes are also open here at the root of the tooth, and there they communicate with the excretory duct of the rubber gland, which runs in the ivory middle part. When you bite, the teeth spring inwards, that's obvious, and exert pressure on the reservoir, which presses the contents into the canals, so that the moment the tips touch the flesh, the dose shoots into the bloodstream. It's very simple when you put your mind to it. You just have to figure it out. It was probably made according to his personal specifications.""","“That,” answered Behrens, “is an organized hypodermic syringe. Or, if you like, it is a copy of the mechanism of the cobra’s bite. Understand? You don’t seem to,” he went on, as Hans Castorp continued to stare at the bizarre little instrument. “These are the teeth. They are not solid all the way, there is a canal inside, the thickness of a hair; you can see the issue of it quite plainly, here just above the point. They are also open at the base, of course, and communicate with the excretory duct of the bulb, which runs into the ivory middle part. When the teeth bite, they sink in a little, and the pressure on the reservoir shoots the contents into the canals, so that the poison gets into circulation the moment the fangs sink in the flesh. Perfectly simple, when you see it like that; you just have to get the idea. He probably had it made after his own design.”","“That,” Behrens replied, “is a well-constructed hypodermic syringe. Or, to put it another way, a mechanical copy of the dentures of the spectacled cobra. Do you understand? You don’t look as if you understand,” he said, while Hans Castorp continued to stare in dazed amazement at the bizarre instrument. “Those are the fangs. They are not that massive, but they come equipped with a capillary, a very tiny channel, that emerges here, as you can clearly see, just above the tip. And of course, these channels have an opening at the root of the fang as well, which is connected to the rubber gland by a duct running through this ivory middle section. When the bite is made, the other teeth are pushed back a little, as you can clearly see, and exert pressure on the reservoir, pressing its contents into the channels, so that the moment the fangs enter the flesh, the dose is injected into the bloodstream. It’s quite simple, once you can actually see it. Someone just has to come up with the idea. It was probably produced according to his own specifications.”"
"Wir wollen es so stellen: Ein geistiger, das heißt ein bedeutender Gegenstand ist eben dadurch »bedeutend«, daß er über sich hinausweist, daß er Ausdruck und Exponent eines Geistig-Allgemeineren ist, einer ganzen Gefühls- und Gesinnungswelt, welche in ihm ihr mehr oder weniger vollkommenes Sinnbild gefunden hat, – wonach sich denn der Grad seiner Bedeutung bemißt. Ferner ist die Liebe zu einem solchen Gegenstand ebenfalls und selbst »bedeutend«. Sie sagt etwas aus über den, der sie hegt, sie kennzeichnet sein Verhältnis zu jenem Allgemeinen, jener Welt, die der Gegenstand vertritt, und die in ihm, bewußt oder unbewußt, mitgeliebt wird.","We want to put it this way: A spiritual, that is, an important object is ""significant"" precisely because it points beyond itself, that it is the expression and exponent of something spiritually more general, of a whole world of feelings and attitudes, which in it is more her or has found a less perfect symbol, - according to which the degree of its importance is measured. Further, love of such an object is also and itself ""significant."" It says something about the person who cherishes it, it characterizes his relationship to that universal, that world which the object represents and which he, consciously or unconsciously, loves with him.","But to make clear what this last one, the old “Linden-tree,” meant to him, is truly a ticklish endeavour; requiring great delicacy of emphasis if more harm than good is not to come of the undertaking. Let us put it thus: a conception which is of the spirit, and therefore significant, is so because it reaches beyond itself to become the expression and exponent of a larger conception, a whole world of feeling and sentiment, which, whether more or less completely, is mirrored in the first, and in this wise, accordingly, the degree of its significance measured. Further, the love felt for such a creation is in itself “significant”: betraying something of the person who cherishes it, characterizing his relation to that broader world the conception bodies forth—which, consciously or unconsciously, he loves along with and in the thing itself.","But it is, we must admit, a very tricky task to explain what this last work, this song, this old “linden tree,” meant to him, and the greatest care must be given to nuance, if we are not to do more harm than good. Let us put it this way: an object created by the human spirit and intellect, which means a significant object, is “significant” in that it points beyond itself, is an expression and exponent of a more universal spirit and intellect, of a whole world of feelings and ideas that have found a more or less perfect image of themselves in that object—by which the degree of its significance is then measured. Moreover, love for such an object is itself equally “significant.” It says something about the person who feels it, it defines his relationship to the universe, to the world represented by the created object and, whether consciously or unconsciously, loved along with it."
"Er steckte es zu sich, ohne von der Erscheinung Aufhebens zu machen. Man war um Ellen Brand beschäftigt, die immer noch in der beschriebenen Haltung, blinden Blickes und mit sonderbar geziertem Gesichtsausdruck an ihrem Platze saß. Herr Albin blies sie an und ahmte vor ihrem Gesichtchen die aufwärts fächelnde Handbewegung Dr. Krokowskis nach, worauf sie sich ermunterte und – unklar, warum – ein wenig weinte. Man streichelte, tröstete sie, küßte sie auf die Stirn und schickte sie schlafen. Die Levi erklärte sich bereit, die Nacht bei Frau Stöhr zu verbringen, da die tiefstehende Frau vor Grauen nicht wußte, wie sie ins Bett kommen sollte. Hans Castorp, seinen Apport in der Brusttasche, hatte nichts dagegen, den ausgearteten Abend mit den anderen Herren auf Albins Zimmer mit einem Kognak zu beschließen, denn er fand, daß Vorkommnisse gleich diesen zwar weder auf das Herz noch auf den Geist, wohl aber auf die Magennerven Wirkung übten – und zwar eine nachhaltige Wirkung, so, wie der Seekranke wohl noch am Lande stundenlang die übelkeiterregenden Schwankungen zu spüren meint.","He put it in his pocket without making a fuss about the appearance. People were busy around Ellen Brand, who was still sitting in her place in the position described, blind-eyed and with a strangely affected expression on her face. Herr Albin blew on her and imitated the upward fanning hand movement of Dr. Krokowskis, whereupon she encouraged herself and - it is unclear why - cried a little. She was stroked, comforted, kissed on the forehead and sent to sleep. Levi agreed to spend the night with Frau Stoehr, since the low-lying woman was so terrified that she didn't know how to get into bed. Hans Castorp, his duffel bag in his breast pocket, didn't mind ending the degenerate evening with the other gentlemen in Albin's room with a cognac, because he found that incidents like these didn't affect the heart or the mind, but they did the stomach nerves exerted an effect - and a lasting effect, just as the seasick person thinks he can still feel the nauseating fluctuations for hours on land.","He put it into his pocket, unobservably. The others were busied about Ellen Brand, who remained sitting in her place in the same state, staring vacantly, with that curious simpering expression. Herr Albin blew in her face and imitated the upward sweeping motion of Dr. Krokowski, upon which she roused, and incontinently wept a little. They caressed and comforted her, kissed her on the forehead and sent her to bed. Fräulein Levi said she was willing to sleep with Frau Stöhr, for that abject creature confessed she was too frightened to go to bed alone. Hans Castorp, with his retrieved property in his breast pocket, had no objection to finishing off the evening with a cognac in Herr Albin’s room. He had discovered, in fact, that this sort of thing affected neither the heart nor the spirits so much as the nerves of the stomach—a retroactive effect, like seasickness, which sometimes troubles the traveller with qualms hours after he has set foot on shore.","He put it in his pocket without any fuss. The others were busy with Ellen Brand, whose pose had not changed—she was still sitting in her chair, staring vacantly ahead, a strangely affected expression on her face. Herr Albin blew on her and imitated Dr. Krokowski’s gesture, that casual upward fanning of the hand in front of her face, which roused her. She began—who knew why?—to weep softly. They petted her, comforted her, kissed her brow, and sent her to bed. Fräulein Levi declared she was willing to spend the night with Frau Stöhr, since that limited lady was so frightened that she did not know how she could ever go to sleep. Hans Castorp, his apported object in his breast pocket, had no objection to ending an evening gone awry over a cognac shared with the other gentlemen in Herr Albin’s room, for he found that the effect of events like these was not as hard on his heart or mind as on his stomach—and the effect lasted, too, like that nauseating sway that seasick people claim they can still feel for hours after they have set foot on land."
"Erlosch? Frau Stöhr, nicht mehr zu halten, schrie Hi und Hu, denn sie hatte es knipsen hören. Das Licht war nicht ausgegangen, es war abgedreht worden, von einer Hand, die man sehr schonend kennzeichnete, wenn man sie eine fremde Hand nannte. War es Holgers Hand? Er war so sanft, so diszipliniert und poetisch gewesen bis dahin; jetzt aber hatte sein Wesen begonnen, in Büberei und Schabernack auszuarten. Wer stand dafür, daß eine Hand, die Faustschläge gegen Tür und Möbel führte und bübisch das Licht ausdrehte, nicht irgendjemandem an die Gurgel fuhr? Im Finstern rief man nach Zündhölzern, nach einer Taschenlaterne. Die Levi kreischte auf, man habe sie am Stirnhaar gezogen. Vor Angst schämte Frau Stöhr sich nicht, laut zu Gott zu beten. »Ach du Herr, noch diesmal!« schrie sie und wimmerte, es möge Gnade vor Recht ergehen, obgleich man die Hölle versucht habe. Dr. Ting-Fu war es, der den gesunden Gedanken faßte, das Deckenlicht einzuschalten, so daß alsbald das Zimmer in Klarheit lag. Während man feststellte, daß das Nachttischlämpchen in der Tat nicht zufällig ausgegangen, sondern abgedreht worden war, und daß man nur den verborgenerweise geschehenen Handgriff menschlich zu wiederholen brauchte, um es wieder zum Brennen zu bringen, erfuhr Hans Castorp persönlich und in der Stille eine Überraschung, die er als besondere Aufmerksamkeit der hier sich kundgebenden kindischen Dunkelheiten auffassen mochte. Auf seinen Knieen lag ein leichter Gegenstand, das »Souvenir«, das einst seinen Onkel erschreckt hatte, als er es von des Neffen Kommode genommen: das gläserne Diapositiv, das {1010}Clawdia Chauchats Innenporträt zeigte, und das bestimmt nicht er, Hans Castorp, in dieses Zimmer eingeführt hatte.","extinguished? Frau Stöhr, unable to hold back, yelled Hi and Hu, because she had heard a snap. The light hadn't gone out, it had been turned off by a hand that was marked very carefully when you called it a stranger's hand. Was it Holger's hand? He had been so gentle, so disciplined, and poetic up until then; but now his character had begun to degenerate into rascality and practical jokes. Who was to ensure that a hand that punched the door and the furniture and turned out the light like a boy didn't go for someone's throat? In the dark people called for matches, for a pocket lantern. Levi screamed that her forehead hair had been pulled. Fearful, Frau Stöhr was not ashamed to pray aloud to God. ""Oh my lord, this time again!"" she cried, whimpering that mercy should prevail, though hell had been tried. dr It was Ting-Fu who had the sane thought of turning on the overhead light, so that the room was clear. While it was discovered that the bedside lamp had not actually gone out by accident, but had been turned off, and that one only had to humanly repeat the operation that had been done in secret to bring it back on, Hans Castorp experienced a surprise personally and in silence , which he might take as a special attention to the childish obscurities that are manifested here. On his knees lay a light object, the ""souvenir"" that had once frightened his uncle when he took it from his nephew's dresser: the glass slide that showed Clawdia Chauchat's interior portrait, and that certainly wasn't him, Hans Castorp , introduced into this room.","Went out? Frau Stöhr, beside herself, made great outcry, for she had heard the switch turned. The light, then, had not gone out, but been put out, by a hand—a hand which one characterized afar off in calling it a “strange” hand. Was it Holger’s? Up to then he had been so mild, so tractable, so poetic—but now he seemed to degenerate into clownish practical jokes. Who knew that a hand which could so roundly thump doors and tables, and knavishly turn off lights, might not next catch hold of someone’s throat? They called for matches, for pocket torches. Fräulein Levi shrieked out that someone had pulled her front hair. Frau Stöhr made no bones of calling aloud on God in her distress: “O Lord, forgive me this once!” she moaned, and whimpered for mercy instead of justice, well knowing she had tempted hell. It was Dr. Ting-Fu who hit on the sound idea of turning on the ceiling light; the room was brilliantly illuminated straightway. They now established that the lamp on the night-table had not gone out by chance, but been turned off, and only needed to have the switch turned back in order to burn again. But while this was happening, Hans Castorp made on his own account a most singular discovery, which might be regarded as a personal attention on the part of the dark powers here manifesting themselves with such childish perversity. A light object lay in his lap; he discovered it to be the “souvenir” which had once so surprised his uncle when he lifted it from his nephew’s table: the glass diapositive of Clavdia Chauchat ’s x-ray portrait. Quite uncontestably he, Hans Castorp, had not carried it into the room.","Went out? There was no holding Frau Stöhr back now, she raised a hue and cry—she had heard the switch. The bulb had not burned out, it had been turned off, by a hand, which to describe as strange would be to put it mildly. Was it Holger’s hand? He had been so gentle, so disciplined, and poetic up till then; but now he was degenerating into a low practical jokester. Who could guarantee that a hand that banged its fist against doors and furniture, that impishly switched off lights, might not also pack someone by the throat? Voices in the dark called out for matches, for flashlights. Fräulein Levi screeched that someone had pulled her hair. In her panic, Frau Stöhr was not ashamed of breaking into prayer. “Oh Lord, just this once!” she screamed and then whimpered for Him to be more merciful than just, even though they had been flirting with hell. It was Dr. Ting-Fu who came up with the sound idea of turning on the ceiling light—and at once the room was bathed in bright clarity. And while they established that the nightstand lamp had not burned out but had been turned off—it took only a very human flip of the switch to undo the covert maneuver and make it burn again— Hans Castorp quietly made a surprising discovery of his own, which might be seen as evidence that the childish dark powers manifesting themselves here had paid him particular attention. Across his knees was an object, the “souvenir” that had frightened his uncle the day he had picked it up off his nephew’s chest of drawers: the glass negative that revealed the portrait of Clavdia Chauchat’s interior and that he, Hans Castorp, had most definitely not brought into the room."
"»Ich bemerke vor allem mit Unmut, daß Sie schon wieder Weltentzweiung treiben.«","""It is above all with displeasure that I notice that you are again driving world division.""","“And what I am calling your attention to is the fact, which I observe with indignation, that you are still dividing the world up into opposing factions.”","“What I observe, with some annoyance, is that you are once again dividing the world in two.”"
"»Genau so!« rief Hans Castorp in aufrichtiger Begeisterung. »Tadellos ausgedrückt bis aufs i-Tüpfelchen, Herr Settembrini! Mit dem Tode –! Ich wußte es ja, daß Sie als Literat …«","""Exactly like that!"" exclaimed Hans Castorp in sincere enthusiasm. 'Perfectly expressed, Mr Settembrini! With death! I knew that you, as a man of letters...""","“Precisely!” cried Hans Castorp, in honest enthusiasm. “You have expressed it to a T, Herr Settembrini. Contact with death! I was sure that you, as a literary man—”","“Precisely,” Hans Castorp exclaimed with genuine enthusiasm. “You’ve put it perfectly, dotted the i and crossed the t, Herr Settembrini. Contacts with death! I know that as a man of letters you . . .”"
"Und da auch Frau Chauchat schon auf ihre Zimmertür zuging, so ließ Peeperkorn den Widerspenstigen ziehen, indem er ihm freilich noch eine Weile über die eigene Schulter und die des Malaien mit angezogenem Faltenwerk nachblickte, erstaunt über eine Unbotmäßigkeit, auf die seine Herrschernatur nicht zu stoßen gewohnt sein mochte.","And since Frau Chauchat was already heading for her room door, Peeperkorn let the stubborn man go, although he looked after him for a while longer over his own shoulder and that of the Malayan with drawn-up folds, astonished at an insubordination that his sovereign nature did not encounter might be used to.","Frau Chauchat, for her part, was moving toward her door; Peeperkorn gave way, and let the unwilling suitor go, though looking at him awhile over his and the Malay’s shoulders, his wrinkled brows drawn high in astonishment at an insubordination his kingly temper was seldom called upon to brook.","And since Frau Chauchat was already moving toward the door to the room, Peeperkorn let this headstrong young man go, although he stared after him for a good while, gazing over both his own shoulder and the Malayan ’s , his brow deeply creased in amazement at such an act of insubordination, to which his royal nature was quite unaccustomed."
"»Mein Herr, die Demokratie hat selbst vom Kreml mehr zu hoffen, als von der Hofburg, und es ist eine Schande für das Land Luthers und Gutenbergs –«","""My lord, democracy has more to hope for even from the Kremlin than from the Hofburg, and it is a disgrace to the country of Luther and Gutenberg -""","“Democracy, my friend, has more to hope from the Kremlin than she has from the Hofburg; and it is disgraceful for the country of Luther and Gutenberg—”","“Democracy, my dear sir, has more to hope for from the Kremlin than from the Hofburg, and it is a disgrace that the land of Luther and Gutenberg—”"
"Er beriet sofort mit Ferge den Punkt, der sich als sehr schwierig erwies. Radamanth war zwar Korpsstudent gewesen, aber {1064}unmöglich konnte man den Chef der Anstalt um Unterstützung einer solchen Ungesetzlichkeit angehen, zumal es sich um Patienten handelte. Überhaupt bestand kaum Hoffnung, daß man hier einen Arzt werde ausfindig machen, der bereit sein würde, zu einem Pistolenduell zwischen zwei Schwerkranken die Hand zu bieten. Krokowski angehend, so war nicht einmal sicher, ob dieser spirituelle Kopf überhaupt sehr fest in der Wundbehandlung sei.","He immediately consulted with Ferge on what proved to be a very difficult point. Radamanth had been a corps student, but {1064}there was no way the head of the institution could be approached for support for such illegality, especially when it came to patients. In general, there was little hope that a doctor would be found here who would be willing to offer a hand in a pistol duel between two seriously ill patients. As far as Krokowski was concerned, it wasn't even certain whether this spiritual head was very firm in wound treatment at all.","He immediately advised with Ferge, who foresaw great difficulty. Rhadamanthus himself was an old corps-student; but it would be impossible to ask the head of the establishment to act in an illegal affair, and between patients to boot. It was scarcely likely a doctor could be found who would be willing to lend a hand in a pistol duel between two severe cases. As for Krokowski, for all his brain, it was a question whether the technique of wound treatment would be his strong point.","He immediately consulted with Ferge on this issue, for which there was no simple solution. Rhadamanthus had been a member of a dueling fraternity, but they could not possibly approach the head of the sanatorium and ask him to abet them in an illegal act, particularly since patients were involved. There was hardly any hope of locating a doctor who would be prepared to offer a hand in a duel with pistols between two seriously ill men. As for Krokowski, it was not even certain whether the spiritualist had any expertise in treating wounds."
"»Sie sind es, Herr Settembrini! Das ist ja freundlich. Ha, ha, ›Refektorium‹? Da haben Sie gleich wieder einen Witz gemacht. Nehmen Sie den Stuhl, bitte. Sie stören mich keine Spur. Ich lag da und sinnierte, – sinnieren ist schon viel zu viel gesagt. Ich war einfach zu faul, das Licht anzudrehen. Danke vielmals, es geht mir subjektiv so gut wie normal. Mein Schnupfen ist beinahe behoben durch die Bettruhe, aber er soll ja eine sekundäre Erscheinung sein, wie ich allgemein höre. Die Temperatur ist eben immer noch nicht, wie sie sein sollte, mal 37,5, mal 37,7, das hat sich in diesen Tagen noch nicht geändert.«","'It's you, Mr Settembrini! That's friendly. Ha, ha, 'Refectory'? Then you made a joke again. Take the chair, please. You don't bother me one bit. I lay there and pondered - pondering is already saying too much. I was just too lazy to turn on the light. Thank you very much, subjectively I'm doing as well as normal. My cold is almost gone with bed rest, but it's supposed to be a secondary phenomenon from what I've heard. The temperature is still not what it should be, sometimes 37.5, sometimes 37.7, that hasn’t changed in the last few days.«","“Ah, that is you, Herr Settembrini! How friendly of you! Refectory— oh, I say, that is good! Always at your jokes—but do sit down. You are not disturbing me in the least. I was lying there musing— no, musing is too much to say. I was simply too lazy to turn on the light. Thanks very much, I am subjectively as good as normal, and my cold is much better from lying in bed. But it was a secondary phenomenon, so everybody tells me. My temperature is still not what it should be, I have 99.5° to 99.7°, all the time.”","“It’s you, Herr Settembrini. How kind of you. Ha, ha—‘refectory’? Another one of your jokes. Please, have a chair. You’re not disturbing me in the least. I’ve been lying here musing—and musing is probably an exaggeration. I was simply too lazy to turn on the light. Thanks so much , I’m feeling almost normal, subjectively at least. My cold is almost gone, thanks to the bed rest, but it’s apparently only a secondary phenomenon, or so I’ve been told. My temperature still is not quite what it should be—sometimes ninety-nine point five, sometimes ninety-nine point nine. That hasn’t changed in the past few days.”"
"»Du kannst dir denken,« sagte Joachim und seufzte wieder, »wie unangenehm mir die Sache ist! Was soll denn jetzt werden? Natürlich fühle ich mich doch sozusagen verantwortlich. Du kommst hier herauf, um mich zu besuchen, und ich führe dich ein hier oben, und nun sitzt du fest, und niemand weiß, wann du wieder loskommst und deine Stelle antreten kannst. Du mußt einsehen, daß mir das im höchsten Grade peinlich ist.«","""You can imagine,"" said Joachim and sighed again, ""how uncomfortable this is for me! What's going to happen now? Of course I feel responsible, so to speak. You come up here to see me and I introduce you up here and now you're stuck and nobody knows when you'll be able to get out and start your job. You must see that I am extremely embarrassed.”","“You can see how unpleasant the thing is for me,” Joachim said, sighing again. “What is to happen now? I feel in a way responsible. You come up here to pay me a visit, I take you in, and here you are, and who knows when you can get away and go into your position down below? You must see how extremely painful that is to me.”","“You can imagine,” Joachim said with another sigh, “how unpleasant the whole affair is for me. What’s going to happen now? Of course I feel more or less responsible. You come up here to visit me, and I introduce you to life up here, and now here you sit, and no one knows when you’ll be able to get away again and start your career. You must realize how terribly embarrassing this is for me.”"
"Hiernach schien unserem Abenteurer vieles geordnet, und mit beschwichtigtem Gemüt, wenn auch geplagt von Husten und Schnupfendumpfheit, lebte er abwartend in den Tag hinein, den vielfach in kurze Stückchen geteilten und in seiner feststehenden Einförmigkeit weder kurz- noch langweiligen Normaltag, der immer derselbe war. Morgens trat nach mächtigem Anklopfen der Bademeister herein, ein nerviges Individuum namens Turnherr, mit aufgerollten Hemdärmeln, hochgeäderten Unterarmen und einer gurgelnden, schwer behinderten Sprechart, der Hans Castorp, wie alle Patienten, mit seiner Zimmernummer anredete und ihn mit Alkohol abrieb. {288}Nicht lange nach seinem Abgang erschien Joachim, fertig angezogen, um Guten Morgen zu sagen, nach seines Vetters Sieben-Uhr-früh-Temperatur zu fragen und seine eigene mitzuteilen. Während er drunten frühstückte, tat Hans Castorp, sein Plumeau im Rücken, mit dem Appetit, den eine neue Lebenslage erzeugt, dasselbe –, kaum gestört durch den geschäftig-geschäftsmäßigen Einbruch der Ärzte, die um diese Zeit den Speisesaal passiert hatten und ihren Rundgang durch die Zimmer der Bettlägrigen und Moribunden im Geschwindschritt zurücklegten. Den Mund voll Eingemachtem, bekundete er, »schön« geschlafen zu haben, sah über den Rand seiner Tasse hin zu, wie der Hofrat, der seine Fäuste auf die Platte des Mitteltisches stemmte, rasch die dort aufliegende Fiebertabelle prüfte, und erwiderte gleichmütig gedehnten Tones den Morgengruß der Abziehenden. Dann zündete er sich eine Zigarette an und sah Joachim schon von seinem morgentlichen Dienstgang wieder zurückkehren, wenn er kaum gedacht hatte, daß er fortgegangen sei. Wieder plauderten sie dies und das, und der Zeit-Zwischenraum bis zum zweiten Frühstück – Joachim hielt Liegekur unterdessen – war so kurz, daß selbst ein ausgemachter Hohlkopf und Geistesarmer es nicht zur Langenweile gebracht haben würde, – während doch Hans Castorp an den Eindrücken seiner ersten drei Wochen hier oben reichlich zu zehren, auch seine gegenwärtige Lebenslage und was etwa daraus werden mochte, innerlich zu bearbeiten hatte und der beiden dicken Bände einer illustrierten Zeitschrift kaum bedurft hätte, die, der Anstaltsbibliothek entstammend, auf seinem Nachttisch lagen.","After this, everything seemed to be in order for our adventurer, and with a calm mind, although plagued by coughing and a dull sniffle, he waited and waited for the day, which was often divided into short pieces and, in its fixed uniformity, neither short nor boring normal day, which was always the same . In the morning, after a mighty knock, the lifeguard came in, an annoying individual named Turnherr, with rolled-up shirt sleeves, high-veined forearms and a gurgling, severely disabled way of speaking, who, like all patients, addressed Hans Castorp with his room number and rubbed him down with alcohol. {288}Not long after his departure, Joachim appeared, fully dressed, to say good morning, to ask about his cousin's seven o'clock temperature, and to share his own. While he was having breakfast downstairs, Hans Castorp, his plumeau behind him, with the appetite that a new situation creates, did the same - hardly disturbed by the bustling businesslike break-in of the doctors, who at this time had passed the dining-room and were making their rounds walked across the rooms of the bedridden and moribund at a rapid pace. Mouth full of preserves, he said he had slept ""nicely,"" looked over the rim of his cup as the privy councilor, who was pressing his fists on the top of the central table, quickly checked the temperature table there, and replied in an indifferent, drawn-out tone the morning greeting of those leaving. Then he lit a cigarette and saw Joachim returning from his morning's work, when he had scarcely thought that he had left. Again they chatted this and that, and the interval of time until the second breakfast - Joachim was meanwhile taking a rest cure - was so short that even a decidedly hollow head and mentally poor would not have gotten bored - while Hans Castorp was still working on the impressions of his the first three weeks up here, also had to deal with his current life situation and what might become of it and would hardly have needed the two thick volumes of an illustrated magazine, which, coming from the institution's library, lay on his bedside table.","Our adventurous youth felt much relieved to have set affairs in such good train— if likewise a good deal plagued by his cough and the heavy-headedness caused by his catarrh—and now he began to live each day as it came—a day which never varied, which was always broken up into a number of sections, and which, in its abiding uniformity, could not be said either to pass too fast or to hang too heavy on the hands. In the morning the bathing-master would give a mighty thump on the door and enter—a nervous individual named Turnherr, who wore his sleeves rolled up, and had great standing veins upon his forearms, and a gurgling, impeded speech. He addressed Hans Castorp, as he did all the patients, by the number of his room, and rubbed him with alcohol. Not long after he left, Joachim would appear ready dressed, to greet his cousin, inquire after his seven o’clock temperature, and communicate his own. While he breakfasted below, Hans Castorp did the same above, his down quilt tucked behind his back, in enjoyment of the good appetite a change engenders. He was scarcely disturbed by the bustling and businesslike entrance of the two physicians, who at this hour made a hurried round of the dining-hall and the rooms of the bedridden and moribund. Hans Castorp, with his mouth full of jam, announced himself to have slept “splendidly” and looked over the rim of his cup at the Hofrat, who leaned with his fists on the centre table, and hastily scanned the fever chart. Both physicians wished him good-morning, and he responded in an unconcerned drawl as they went out. Then he lighted a cigarette, and beheld Joachim returning from the morning walk, almost before he realized his departure. Again they chatted of this and that; Joachim went to lie down until second breakfast, and the interval seemed so short that even the emptiest-headed could hardly have felt bored. Hans Castorp, indeed, had so much food for thought in the events of the past three weeks, so much to ponder in his present state and what might come of it, that although two bound volumes of an illustrated periodical from the Berghof library lay upon his night-table, he had no need to resort to them.","This done, our adventurer felt he had put things in general good order and his mind was at ease; and although tormented by the cough and stuffy head of a cold, he lived each day as it came—each normal day, its established sameness divided into little segments, neither diverting nor boring, and always the same. Each morning there would be a robust knock on his door, and the bath attendant would enter, a sinewy fellow named Turnherr, with rolled-up sleeves and heavily veined forearms. In a gurgling voice with a serious impediment, he would address Hans Castorp—as he did all the patients—by his room number and then proceed to rub him down with alcohol. Not long after he left, Joachim would appear, already dressed by then, to say good morning and ask his cousin about his seven o’clock temperature and inform him of his own. While Joachim was eating his breakfast downstairs, Hans Castorp would sit up, pillows stuffed behind his back, and do the same, with the healthy appetite that a change in life can bring—and would be disturbed hardly at all by the bustling, businesslike invasion of the doctors, who by this time had passed through the dining hall and were now making their rounds, moving at double time through the rooms of the bedridden and moribund. His mouth full of jam, he would announce that he had slept “quite well” and gaze across the rim of his cup at the director, who was standing in the center of the room, one fist braced against the table, hastily scanning the temperature chart; he would respond in a calm, drawling voice as they wished him good morning and departed. He would light a cigarette, and before he had even realized that Joachim was gone, here would come his cousin, already back from his morning constitutional. They would chat about one thing or another, and the time until second breakfast, which Joachim faithfully used for a rest cure, was so brief that even a downright dimwit or lamebrain could not have managed to be bored, whereas it gave Hans Castorp an opportunity to feast on his impressions of the first three weeks up here and to meditate on his current situation and what it perhaps might lead to—so that he had almost no use for the two thick illustrated magazines from the sanatorium library that lay on his nightstand."
"Er stieß sich ab, schlürfte auf seinen Kufen fort, fuhr am Waldrande den dicken Schneebelag der Schräge ins Neblige hinunter und trieb sich, steigend und gleitend, ziellos und gemächlich, weiter in dem toten Gelände umher, das mit seinen leeren, welligen Gebreiten, seiner Trockenvegetation, die aus einzelnen, dunkel hervorstechenden Latschenbüschen bestand, und seiner Horizontbegrenzung von weichen Erhebungen so auffallend einer Dünenlandschaft glich. Hans Castorp nickte zufrieden mit dem Kopf, wenn er stand und sich an dieser Ähnlichkeit weidete; und auch den Brand seiner Miene, die Neigung zum Gliederzittern, die eigentümliche und trun{724}kene Mischung von Aufregung und Müdigkeit, die er spürte, duldete er mit Sympathie, da dies alles ihn an nah verwandte Wirkungen der ebenfalls aufpeitschenden und zugleich mit schlafbringenden Stoffen gesättigten Seeluft vertraulich erinnerte. Er empfand mit Genugtuung seine beschwingte Unabhängigkeit, sein freies Schweifen. Vor ihm lag kein Weg, an den er gebunden war, hinter ihm keiner, der ihn so zurückleiten würde, wie er gekommen war. Es hatte anfangs Stangen, eingepflanzte Stöcke, Schneezeichen gegeben, aber absichtlich hatte er sich bald von ihrer Bevormundung freigemacht, da sie ihn an den Mann mit dem Hörnchen erinnerten und seinem inneren Verhältnis zur großen Winterwildnis nicht angemessen schienen.","He pushed off, shuffled on his skids, rode down the thick snow cover of the incline into the mist at the edge of the forest and drifted, climbing and gliding, aimlessly and leisurely, further about in the dead terrain, which with its empty undulating expanses, his Dry vegetation, consisting of individual, dark pine bushes that stand out, and its horizon delimitation of soft elevations so strikingly resembled a dune landscape. Hans Castorp nodded his head contentedly when he stood and gloated over this resemblance; and also the burning of his face, the tendency to tremble in his limbs, the peculiar and drunken mixture of excitement and fatigue he felt, he tolerated with sympathy, since all this had closely related effects to the likewise stimulating and at the same time sleep-inducing effects substances saturated with sea air confidentially remembered. He felt gratified by his elated independence, his free roaming. There was no path before him to bind him, and no path behind him that would lead him back as he had come. At first there had been poles, planted sticks, snow signs, but he had soon deliberately freed himself from their tutelage, since they reminded him of the man with the squirrel and did not seem appropriate to his inner relationship to the great winter wilderness.","He pushed off again, shuffling through the deep snow on his flexible runners, along the edge of the wood, down the slope, up again at random, to his heart’s content, about and into this lifeless land. Its empty, rolling spaces, its dried vegetation of single dwarf firs sticking up through the snow, bore a striking resemblance to a scene on the dunes. Hans Castorp nodded as he stood and fixed the likeness in his mind. Even his burning face, his trembling limbs, the peculiar and half-intoxicated mingled sensations of excitement and fatigue were pleasurable, reminding him as they did of that familiar feeling induced by the sea air, which could sting one like whips, and yet was so laden with sleepy essences. He rejoiced in his freedom of motion, his feet were like wings. He was bound to no path, none lay behind him to take him back whence he had come. At first there had been posts, staves set up as guides through the snow— but he had soon cut free from their tutelage, which recalled the coastguard with his horn, and seemed inconsistent with the attitude he had taken up toward the wild.","He pushed off, skidding forward on his wooden runners, and headed first along the edge of the woods and then down across the deep snow of the slope into the fog below; rising and falling, skiing effortlessly with no particular goal, he moved through the dead terrain, which with its bare, billowy expanses, dry vegetation of dark, solitary, jutting scrub pines, and horizon bounded by soft swells, bore a striking resemblance to a landscape of dunes. Hans Castorp nodded his head in satisfaction when he stopped to feast his eyes on the similarity; his face stung, his limbs tended to tremble, and a peculiar, intoxicating blend of excitement and weariness came over him, but he found it all quite tolerable because it was so familiar, reminding him of the stimulating, yet sleep-inducing effects of air drenched with the sea. He was delighted by this freedom to roam, by his own winged independence. No path ahead demanded he follow it, and none lay behind him either, to lead him back the way he had come. At first he had left tracks in the snow with his poles, planting them deep, but very soon he quite intentionally freed himself of their tutelage, because it reminded him of the man blowing his little horn and seemed inconsistent with his own innermost feelings for this vast winter wilderness."
"»Da hast du recht«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Er hat sogar etwas Strenges, – es wird einem öfter ganz ungemütlich, weil man sich – sagen wir mal: kontrolliert fühlt, doch, das ist gar keine schlechte Bezeichnung. Willst du glauben, daß ich immer das Gefühl hatte, er wäre nicht einverstanden damit, daß ich mir Decken zum Liegen gekauft habe, er hätte etwas dagegen und hielte sich irgendwie darüber auf?«","""You're right,"" said Hans Castorp. 'There's even something severe about him - it often makes you uncomfortable because you feel - let's say controlled, but that's not a bad name at all. Do you want to believe that I always got the feeling that he didn't approve of my buying blankets to lie on, that he objected and somehow brooded over it?'","“You are right, there,” Hans Castorp answered. “He’s even austere; he makes one feel rather uncomfortable, as if you were—well, shall I say as if you were being taken to task? That’s not such a bad way to describe it. Can you believe it, I had the feeling he was not at all pleased at my buying the blankets? He had something against it, and he kept dwelling on it.”","“You’re right,” Hans Castorp said. “There’s even something rigorous about him. It often makes you quite uneasy because you feel, let’s call it, controlled—controlled, that’s not a bad word for it. Would you believe that I had the definite feeling that he didn’t approve of my having bought those blankets for the rest cure, was against it and ridiculed it somehow?”"
"Man wird urteilen, der Erzähler trage dick und romantisch auf, indem er den Namen des Stumpfsinns mit dem des Dämonischen in Verbindung bringe und ihm die Wirkung mystischen Grauens zuschreibe. Und dennoch fabeln wir nicht, sondern halten uns genau an unseres schlichten Helden persönliches Erlebnis, dessen Kenntnis uns auf eine Weise, die sich freilich der Untersuchung entzieht, gegeben ist, und das schlechthin den Beweis liefert, daß Stumpfsinn unter Umständen solchen Charakter gewinnen und solche Gefühle einflößen kann. Hans Castorp blickte um sich … Er sah durchaus Unheimliches, Bösartiges, und er wußte, was er sah: Das Leben ohne Zeit, das sorg- und hoffnungslose Leben, das Leben als stagnierend betriebsame Liederlichkeit, das tote Leben.","It will be judged that the narrator is laying it on thickly and romantically, associating the name of dullness with that of the demonic and attributing to it the effect of mystical horror. And yet we do not fable, but stick closely to the personal experience of our humble hero, knowledge of which is given to us in a way which, of course, evades investigation, and which provides absolute proof that stupidity can acquire such a character under certain circumstances can induce feelings. Hans Castorp looked around ... He saw something uncanny, evil, and he knew what he saw: life without time, the carefree and hopeless life, life as stagnant, busy slovenliness, dead life.","The reader will accuse the writer of laying it on pretty thick when he associates two such ideas as these, and ascribes to mere staleness a mystical and supernatural character. But we are not indulging in flights of fancy. We are adhering strictly to the personal experience of our simple-minded hero, which in some way defying exact definition it has been given us to know, and which indicates that when all the uses of this world unitedly become flat, stale, and unprofitable, they are actually possessed by a demonic quality capable of giving rise to the feelings we have described. Hans Castorp looked about him. He saw on every side the uncanny and the malign, and he knew what it was he saw: life without time, life without care or hope, life as depravity, assiduous stagnation; life as dead.","The demon’s name was Stupor. It will be said that the narrator is laying it on too thick, being too romantic in associating stupor with demonic forces, even ascribing to it some sort of mystic horror. And yet we are not fabricating tales here, but are keeping exactly to our prosaic hero’s personal experience—knowledge of which has been granted to us in ways that, to be sure, elude all investigation, but that plainly prove that under certain circumstances stupor can take on such character and instill such feelings. Hans Castorp looked around him—and what he saw was indeed uncanny and malicious. And he knew what it was he saw: life without time, without care or hope, life as a stagnating hustle-bustle of depravity, dead life."
"Sie kam, er hörte ihre Schritte, ihr Kleid hinter sich, sie war neben ihm, fächelte mit einem Brief, den sie an einer Ecke hielt, in der Luft hin und her und sagte mit ihrer Pribislavstimme:","She came, he heard her footsteps, her dress behind him, she was next to him, fanning the air with a letter she held on a corner and saying in her Pribislav voice:","She came, he heard her approaching step and the sound of her frock; fanning the air with a letter she held by one corner, and saying, in her Pribislav voice: “The porter has gone.","And here she came, he heard her footsteps, her dress trailing behind; she was beside him, she was holding a letter by one corner and waving it back and forth in the air, and she said in her Pribislav voice: “The concierge is gone."
"Seitdem hatte dieser Sinnen- und Geistestrug weit größeren Maßstab angenommen. Die Zeit, sei ihr subjektives Erlebnis auch abgeschwächt oder aufgehoben, hat sachliche Wirklichkeit, sofern sie tätig ist, sofern sie »zeitigt«. Es ist eine Frage für Berufsdenker – und nur aus jugendlicher Anmaßung hatte also Hans Castorp sich einmal damit eingelassen –, ob die hermetische Konserve auf ihrem Wandbort außer der Zeit ist. Aber wir wissen, daß auch am Siebenschläfer die Zeit ihr Werk tut. Ein Arzt beglaubigt den Fall eines zwölfjährigen Mädchens, das eines Tages in Schlaf verfiel und dreizehn Jahre darin verharrte, – wobei sie aber kein zwölfjähriges Mädchen blieb, sondern unterdessen zum reifen Weibe erblühte. Wie könnte es anders sein. Der Tote ist tot und hat das Zeitliche gesegnet; er hat viel Zeit, das heißt: er hat gar keine, – persönlich genommen. Das hindert nicht, daß ihm noch Nägel und Haare wachsen, und daß alles in allem – aber wir wollen die burschikose Redensart nicht wiederholen, die Hans Castorp einmal in diesem Zusammenhange gebraucht, und an der Joachim damals flachländischen Anstoß genommen hatte. Auch Castorp wuchsen Haare und Nägel, sie wuchsen schnell, wie es schien, er saß so oft in {822}den weißen Mantel gehüllt auf seinem Operationsstuhl beim Coiffeur in der Hauptstraße vom Dorf und ließ sich das Haar schneiden, weil an den Ohren sich wieder Fransen gebildet hatten, – er saß eigentlich immer dort, oder vielmehr, wenn er saß und mit dem schmeichelnd-gewandten Angestellten plauderte, der sein Werk an ihm tat, nachdem die Zeit das ihre getan; oder wenn er an seiner Balkontür stand und sich mit Scherchen und Feile, seinem schönen Samtnecessaire entnommen, die Nägel kürzte, – flog plötzlich mit einer Art von Schrecken, dem neugieriges Ergötzen beigemischt war, jener Schwindel ihn an: ein Schwindel in des Wortes schwankender Doppelbedeutung von Taumel und Betrug, das wirbelige Nicht-mehr-unterscheiden von »Noch« und »Wieder«, deren Vermischung und Verwischung das zeitlose Immer und Ewig ergibt.","Since then, this sense and mental deception had assumed far greater proportions. Time, whether its subjective experience is weakened or abolished, has objective reality insofar as it is active, insofar as it ""times"". It is a question for professional thinkers - and it was only out of youthful presumption that Hans Castorp once got involved - whether the hermetically sealed preserve on your wall board is out of time. But we know that time also does its work on the dormouse. A doctor certifies the case of a twelve-year-old girl who fell asleep one day and remained asleep for thirteen years - although she did not remain a twelve-year-old girl, but meanwhile blossomed into a mature woman. How could it be any different. The dead is dead and has passed away; he has a lot of time, that is to say: he has none at all - personally. That doesn't prevent him from growing nails and hair, and that all in all - but we don't want to repeat the boyish expression that Hans Castorp once used in this connection, and which Joachim had at the time taken a prickly offense at. Castorp's hair and nails grew too, they seemed to grow fast, he often sat in his operating chair at the hairdresser's in the main street of the village, wrapped in his white coat, and had his hair cut because his ears were falling apart again fringes had formed--he actually always sat there, or rather when he sat and chatted with the flatteringly dexterous clerk who did his work on him after time had done its own; or when he stood at his balcony door and shortened his nails with scissors and file, taken from his beautiful velvet toiletry bag, - suddenly that dizziness flew at him with a kind of terror mixed with curious amusement: a dizziness in the word's fluctuating double meaning of dizziness and deceit, the turbulent no-longer-distinguishing between ""still"" and ""again"", the mixing and blurring of which results in the timeless always and eternity.","Since then, however, the deception upon his senses and his mind had assumed much larger proportions. Time, however weakened the subjective perception of it has become, has objective reality in that it brings things to pass. It is a question for professional thinkers—Hans Castorp, in his youthful arrogance, had one time been led to consider it—whether the hermetically sealed conserve upon its shelf is outside of time. We know that time does its work, even upon Seven-Sleepers. A physician cites a case of a twelve-year-old-girl, who fell asleep and slept thirteen years; assuredly she did not remain thereby a twelve-year-old girl, but bloomed into ripe womanhood while she slept. How could it be otherwise? The dead man—is dead; he has closed his eyes on time. He has plenty of time, or personally speaking, he is timeless. Which does not prevent his hair and nails from growing, or, all in all—but no, we shall not repeat those free-and-easy expressions used once by Joachim, to which Hans Castorp, newly arrived from the flat-land, had taken exception. Hans Castorp’s hair and nails grew too, grew rather fast. He sat very often in the barber’s chair in the main street of the Dorf, wrapped in a white sheet, and the barber, chatting obsequiously the while, deftly performed upon the fringes of his hair, growing too long behind his ears. First time, then the barber, performed their office upon our hero. When he sat there, or when he stood at the door of his loggia and pared his nails and groomed them, with the accessories from his dainty velvet case, he would suddenly be overpowered by a mixture of terror and eager joy that made him fairly giddy. And this giddiness was in both senses of the word: rendering our hero not only dazed and dizzy, but flighty and light-headed, incapable of distinguishing between “now” and “then,” and prone to mingle these together in a timeless eternity.","Since then, this deception of mind and senses had assumed much larger dimensions. Time, although the subjective experience of it may be weakened or even abrogated, is an objective reality to the extent that it is active and “brings forth.” Are hermetically sealed preserves on the shelf outside of time? That is a question for the professional philosopher—and it was only out of youthful presumption that Hans Castorp had got himself mixed up in the topic. We do know that time does its work even on a hibernating dormouse. A physician has attested to the case of a twelve-year-old girl who fell asleep one day, and remained asleep for thirteen years—during that time, however, she did not remain a twelve-year-old girl, but grew into an adult female. How could it be otherwise? The dead man is dead and has left our temporal world behind; he has a lot of time, which is to say, he has none at all—personally speaking. That does not prevent his nails and hair from growing, or that all in all—but we shall not repeat the slang idiom that Joachim once used in this same context and that at the time offended Hans Castorp’s flatland sensitivities. His hair and nails were growing, too, growing quickly it seemed, because a fringe of hair kept overlapping the edges of the ears; and he frequently sat, a white cape wrapped around him, in the adjustable chair in the barber shop on the main street of Dorf and had his hair cut—he was forever sitting there, it seemed. Or rather, when Hans Castorp sat there and chatted away with the fawning barber deftly doing his work, after time had done its, or when he stood at his balcony door and cut his nails with the shears and file he had taken from a pretty velvet etui, he was suddenly overcome with the old dizziness that was mixed with a scary sense of curious delight, an ambiguous dizziness that made him feel not only unsteady, but also beguiled by his whirling inability to differentiate between “still” and “again,” out of whose blurred jumble emerge the timeless “always” and “ever.”"
"»Diese kleine Rache«, fuhr Hans Castorp fort, »war mir am Ende zu gönnen, denn so weit ich in Frage komme, habe ich wirklich einigen Grund, mich zu beklagen, – nicht über Clawdia und nicht über Sie, Mynheer Peeperkorn, aber mich allgemein zu beklagen, meines Lebens und Schicksals wegen, und da ich die Ehre Ihres Vertrauens genieße und dies eine so durch und durch eigentümliche Dämmerstunde ist, so will ich mich wenigstens andeutungsweise darüber zu äußern versuchen.«","'This little revenge,' continued Hans Castorp, 'was in the end to be indulged, for as far as I can go I really have some cause for complaint - not about Clawdia and not about you, Mynheer Peeperkorn, but to complain in general, because of my life and fate, and since I enjoy the honor of your trust and this is such a thoroughly peculiar twilight hour, I will try to express myself at least in outline.”","“This little revenge,” went on Hans Castorp, “was granted me at the end, because, so far as I personally am concerned, I have a quarrel after all, not with Clavdia, not with you, Mynheer Peeperkorn, but with my lot in general, my destiny. I will try to tell you about it, in so far as I can, now that I am secure in the honour of your confidence, and in this altogether exceptional and extraordinary twilight hour.”","“For if I matter here at all, I truly have some reason to complain—not about Clavdia and not about you, Mynheer Peeperkorn, but to complain in general, about my life and fate. And since I enjoy the honor of your confidence and this has turned out to be such a thoroughly exceptional twilight hour, I would like at least to attempt to indicate what I mean.”"

"Aber nicht nur ein italienischer Patriot war Großvater Settembrini gewesen, sondern Mitbürger und Mitstreiter aller nach Freiheit dürstenden Völker. Denn nach dem Scheitern eines gewissen Hand- und Staatsstreichversuches, den man in Turin unternommen, und an dem er mit Wort und Tat beteiligt gewesen, nur mit genauer Not den Häschern des Fürsten Metternich entkommen, hatte er die Zeit seiner Verbannung dazu benutzt, in Spanien für die Konstitution und in Griechenland für die Unabhängigkeit des hellenischen Volkes zu kämpfen und zu bluten. Hier war Settembrinis Vater zur Welt gekommen, – weshalb er denn wohl auch ein so großer Humanist und Liebhaber des klassischen Altertums geworden war, – geboren übrigens von einer Mutter deutschen Blutes, denn Giuseppe hatte das Mädchen in der Schweiz geheiratet und bei seinen weiteren Abenteuern mit sich geführt. Später, nach zehnjähriger Landflüchtigkeit, hatte er in die Heimat zurückkehren können und zu Mailand als Advokat gewirkt, keineswegs aber darauf verzichtet, die Nation durch das gesprochene und geschriebene Wort, in Vers und Prosa zur Freiheit und zur Herstellung der einheitlichen Republik aufzurufen, staatsumwälzende Programme mit leidenschaftlich diktatorischem Schwung zu entwerfen und klaren Stiles die Vereinigung der befreiten Völker zur Errichtung des allgemei{235}nen Glückes zu verkünden. Eine Einzelheit, deren Settembrini, der Enkel, erwähnte, machte besonderen Eindruck auf den jungen Hans Castorp: daß nämlich Großvater Giuseppe sich zeit seines Lebens ausschließlich in schwarzer Trauerkleidung unter seinen Mitbürgern gezeigt habe, denn er sei ein Leidtragender, habe er gesagt, um Italien, sein Vaterland, das in Elend und Knechtschaft dahinschmachte. Bei dieser Nachricht mußte Hans Castorp, wie er es übrigens schon vorher ein paarmal vergleichend getan hatte, an seinen eigenen Großvater denken, der ebenfalls, solange der Enkel ihn kannte, sich allezeit schwarz getragen hatte, aber in gründlich anderem Sinne, als dieser Großvater hier: an die altmodische Tracht dachte er, mit der Hans Lorenz Castorps eigentliches, einer vergangenen Zeit angehöriges Wesen sich behelfsweise und unter Andeutung seiner Unzugehörigkeit der Gegenwart angepaßt hatte, bis es im Tode zu seiner wahren und angemessenen Gestalt (mit der Tellerkrause) feierlich eingegangen war. Zwei auffallend verschiedenartige Großväter waren das wahrhaftig gewesen! Hans Castorp dachte darüber nach, indes seine Augen sich festsahen und er vorsichtig den Kopf schüttelte, so, daß es ebensogut als ein Zeichen der Bewunderung für Giuseppe Settembrini, wie auch als Befremdung und Verneinung gedeutet werden konnte. Auch hütete er sich redlich, das Fremdartige zu verurteilen, sondern hielt sich an, es bei Vergleich und Feststellung bewenden zu lassen. Er sah den schmalen Kopf des alten Hans Lorenz im Saale sich sinnend über das schwachgoldene Rund der Taufschale, des stehend-wandernden Erbstückes neigen, – gerundeten Mundes, denn seine Lippen bildeten die Vorsilbe »Ur«, diesen dumpfen und frommen Laut, der an Orte erinnerte, an denen man in eine ehrerbietig vorwärts wiegende Gangart verfiel. Und er sah Giuseppe Settembrini, die Trikolore im Arm, mit geschwungenem Säbel und den schwarzen Blick gelobend gen Himmel gewandt, einer Schar von Freiheits{236}kämpfern voran gegen die Phalanx des Despotismus stürmen. Beides hatte wohl seine Schönheit und Ehre, dachte er, um Billigkeit desto mehr bemüht, als er sich persönlich oder halb persönlich ein wenig Partei fühlte. Denn Großvater Settembrini hatte ja um politische Rechte gestritten, seinem eigenen Großvater aber oder doch dessen Vorvätern hatten ursprünglich alle Rechte gehört, und die Krapüle hatte sie ihnen im Laufe von vier Jahrhunderten mit Gewalt und Redensarten entrissen … Da waren sie nun beide immer in Schwarz gegangen, der Großvater im Norden und der im Süden, und beide zu dem Zweck, einen strengen Abstand zwischen sich und die schlechte Gegenwart zu legen. Aber der eine hatte es aus Frömmigkeit getan, der Vergangenheit und dem Tode zu Ehren, denen sein Wesen angehörte; der andere dagegen aus Rebellion und zu Ehren eines frömmigkeitsfeindlichen Fortschritts. Ja, das waren zwei Welten oder Himmelsgegenden, dachte Hans Castorp, und wie er gleichsam zwischen ihnen stand, während Herr Settembrini erzählte, und prüfend bald in die eine, bald in die andere blickte, so, meinte er, habe er es schon einmal erfahren. Er erinnerte sich einer einsamen Kahnfahrt im Abendzwielicht auf einem holsteinischen See, im Spätsommer, vor einigen Jahren. Um sieben Uhr war es gewesen, die Sonne war schon hinab, der annähernd volle Mond im Osten über den buschigen Ufern schon aufgegangen. Da hatte zehn Minuten lang, während Hans Castorp sich über die stillen Wasser dahinruderte, eine verwirrende und träumerische Konstellation geherrscht. Im Westen war heller Tag gewesen, ein glasig nüchternes, entschiedenes Tageslicht; aber wandte er den Kopf, so hatte er in eine ebenso ausgemachte, höchst zauberhafte, von feuchten Nebeln durchsponnene Mondnacht geblickt. Das sonderbare Verhältnis hatte wohl eine knappe Viertelstunde bestanden, bevor es sich zugunsten der Nacht und des Mondes ausgeglichen, und mit heiterem Staunen waren Hans Castorps geblen{237}dete und vexierte Augen von einer Beleuchtung und Landschaft zur anderen, vom Tage in die Nacht und aus der Nacht wieder in den Tag gegangen. Daran also mußte er denken.","But Grandfather Settembrini was not only an Italian patriot, but a fellow citizen and comrade-in-arms of all peoples thirsting for freedom. Because after the failure of a certain attempted coup d'etat in Turin, in which he was involved in word and deed, only having escaped Prince Metternich's captors with great difficulty, he had used the time of his banishment to go to Spain to fight and bleed for the constitution and in Greece for the independence of the Hellenic people. This is where Settembrini's father was born - which is probably why he became such a great humanist and lover of classical antiquity - born, by the way, of a mother of German blood, because Giuseppe had married the girl in Switzerland and accompanied her on his further adventures guided. Later, after ten years of fleeing the country, he was able to return home and work as a lawyer in Milan, but by no means refrained from calling on the nation through the spoken and written word, in verse and prose, to freedom and the establishment of a unified republic, programs that would revolutionize the state to design with passionate dictatorial verve and to announce in a clear style the unification of the liberated peoples for the establishment of general happiness. One detail mentioned by Settembrini, the grandson, made a special impression on the young Hans Castorp: namely, that all his life grandfather Giuseppe appeared among his fellow citizens only in black mourning clothes, for he was a mourner, he said, for Italy , his fatherland languishing in misery and bondage. When he heard this news, Hans Castorp had to think of his own grandfather, as he had done a couple of times before, who had also always worn black as long as the grandson had known him, but in a completely different sense than this grandfather here : He thought of the old-fashioned costume with which Hans Lorenz Castorp's real being, belonging to a bygone era, had temporarily adapted itself to the present, hinting at its non-belonging, until it had solemnly assumed its true and appropriate form (with the plate ruff) in death . It really had been two strikingly different grandfathers! Hans Castorp thought about it, while his eyes locked and he shook his head cautiously, so that it could be interpreted as a sign of admiration for Giuseppe Settembrini as well as alienation and denial. He also honestly took care not to condemn what was strange, but instead insisted on making comparisons and determinations. He saw the narrow head of old Hans Lorenz in the hall leaning musingly over the pale golden round of the baptismal font, the heirloom standing and wandering - rounded mouth, for his lips formed the prefix ""Ur"", that dull and pious sound that means in places remembered, at which one fell into a respectful, forward-swaying gait. And he saw Giuseppe Settembrini, the tricolor in his arm, with a curved saber and his black eyes vowing heavenward, leading a crowd of freedom fighters to storm against the phalanx of despotism. Both had their beauty and honor, he thought, striving to be fair all the more because he personally or semi-personally felt a little partisan. Because grandfather Settembrini had fought for political rights, but his own grandfather, or at least his forefathers, had originally owned all the rights, and the Krapules had snatched them from them over the course of four centuries with violence and rhetoric... So they both always wore black , the grandfather in the north and the grandfather in the south, both for the purpose of putting a strict distance between himself and the bad present. But one had done it out of piety, to honor the past and death to which his nature belonged; the other, on the other hand, out of rebellion and in honor of anti-pious progress. Yes, those were two worlds or parts of the heavens, thought Hans Castorp, and the way he stood between them as it were while Herr Settembrini was telling the story, examining now one and now the other, he thought he had experienced it before . He remembered a lonely boat trip in the twilight on a Holstein lake, in late summer, a few years ago. It was seven o'clock, the sun had already set, the almost full moon had already risen over the bushy banks in the east. For ten minutes, while Hans Castorp rowed himself along the still waters, a confusing and dreamy constellation had prevailed. It had been broad daylight in the west, a glassy, sober, decided daylight; but if he turned his head, he had looked into an equally clear, highly enchanting moonlit night, interspersed with damp mists. The strange relationship had existed for almost a quarter of an hour before it evened itself out in favor of the night and the moon, and Hans Castorp's dazzled and bewildered eyes moved from one light and landscape to the other, from day to night and with cheerful amazement out of the night into the day. So that was what he had to think about.","But Grandfather Giuseppe had been not only an Italian patriot. He had been fellow citizen and brother-in-arms to any people struggling for its liberties. Thus after the shipwreck of a certain plot hatched in Turin for the overthrow of the military and civil government, a plot in which he had been deeply involved, he had escaped by a hair’s breadth the clutches of Metternich’s hirelings, and spent the time of his exile fighting and bleeding, first in Spain for the cause of constitutionalism, then in Greece for the independence of the Hellenic peoples. It was in Greece that Settembrini’s father had seen the light—which probably accounted for his being a humanist and lover of classical antiquity. His mother had been of German stock; Settembrini had married her in Switzerland and taken her about with him in his further adventurous career. He had been allowed, after ten years of exile, to return to Milan, where he had practised his profession, without for a moment ceasing to labour, with voice and pen, in verse and prose, for the establishment of a united republic, and to draw up subversive programmes characterized by dictatorial ardour, in which were promulgated in the clearest style the unification of the liberated people and the attainment of general felicity. One detail mentioned by the grandson made a profound impression upon Hans Castorp: Grandfather Giuseppe, to the day of his death, wore black—in token, he said, of his mourning for the state of the fatherland, languishing in misery and servitude. Hans Castorp, at this piece of information, thought of his own grandfather, as he had once or twice before during Settembrini’s narrative. He too, for as long as his grandson had known him, wore black clothes. But for how different a reason! Hans Lorenz Castorp had worn the quaint old fashion to indicate his oneness with a bygone time and his essential lack of sympathy with the present; worn it up to the end of his days, when he had returned in death to his true and adequate presentment—with the starched ruff. Certainly these were two strikingly different kinds of grandfather! Hans Castorp pondered, his eyes fixed in a stare, cautiously shaking his head in a way that might as well be taken for a sign of admiration for Giuseppe Settembrini as for the opposite. He honourably refrained from judging what he did not understand, but simply made mental note of the contrast and let it go at that. He could see the narrow head of old Hans Lorenz, as it bent musing over the pale gold rim of the christening basin, that symbol of the passing and the abiding, of continuity through change. He had his mouth open; Hans Castorp knew the words great-great-great were about to issue from it, the sombre syllables which always reminded him of places where one walked with bent head and reverent gait. And then he saw Giuseppe Settembrini, with the tricolour on his arm, waving his sabre and breathing a vow to Heaven with dark gaze flung aloft, as he stormed the heights of despotism at the head of a liberty-loving host. Well, he thought, each of them had his fine and splendid side—he made the greater effort to be fair, because he knew himself to be partisan, on personal or partly personal grounds. For Grandfather Settembrini had fought to obtain political rights; whereas the other grandfather—or his ancestors—had originally had all the rights, and the scoundrels had taken them away from him, in the course of the centuries, by violence or pettifoggery. So both grandfathers had worn mourning, the one in the north and the one in the south, and both in the same idea; namely, to put a great gulf between them and the evil present. But whereas the one had assumed it in token of his pious reverence for the past and the dead, to whom he felt himself with his whole being to belong, the other had worn it as a sign of rebellion, in the name of progress, and in a spirit of hostility toward the past. Yes, these were two different worlds. As Herr Settembrini talked, and Hans Castorp stood, as it were, between them and cast his critical eye upon one and upon the other, they called back to his conscious mind a scene from his own past life. He saw himself rowing on a lake in Holstein, one late summer evening; the sun was down, the almost full moon rising above the bushes that bordered the lake. He rowed alone and slowly over the quiet waters, gazing to right and left at a scene fantastic as any dream. In the west it was still broad day, with a fixed and glassy air; but in the east he looked into a moonlit landscape, wreathed in the magic of rising mists and equally convincing to his bewildered sense. The strange combination lasted some brief quarter-hour before the balance finally settled in favour of night and the moon; all that time Hans Castorp’s dazzled eyes went shifting in lively amazement from one scene to the other: from day to night and back again to day. The picture returned to him now.","But Settembrini’s grandfather had been not only an Italian patriot, but also a fellow citizen and brother-in-arms with all peoples thirsting for freedom. For after the failure of a certain plot to overthrow the state in Turin, in which he had been involved both in word and deed, he very narrowly escaped Prince Metternich’s hirelings and spent the years of his banishment fighting and bleeding for a constitution in Spain and the independence of the Hellenic peoples. It was in Greece that Settembrini’s father had first seen the light of the world—which probably explained why he was such a great humanist and lover of classical antiquity—born, by the way, of a mother with German blood, a girl whom Giuseppe had married in Switzerland and taken along with him throughout the course of his adventures. Later, after ten years of exile, he was able to return to his native land and work as a lawyer in Milan, but that in no way prevented him from continuing to call—with voice and pen, in verse and prose—for the freedom and unity of his country, to draft revolutionary programs with passionate autocratic élan and to proclaim in a lucid style that liberated peoples must unite and forge their universal happiness. Grandson Settembrini mentioned one detail that made a special impression on young Hans Castorp: Grandfather Giuseppe had worn only black when appearing among his fellow citizens, because, as he said, he was in mourning for Italy, his fatherland, which languished in misery and bondage. As had been the case with several items in the story, this piece of information reminded Hans Castorp of his own grandfather, who likewise had worn black all the years his grandson had known him, although for reasons profoundly different from those of this grandfather here; Hans Castorp thought now of those old-fashioned clothes, the makeshift adaptation by which Hans Lorenz Castorp’s true nature, belonging to a time long past, had indicated its dislike of the present, until in death he had solemnly returned to the form appropriate to him—in Spanish ruff. Those had indeed been two spectacularly different grandfathers! And as Hans Castorp thought about it, he closed his eyes tight and shook his head cautiously, which could just as easily have been taken as an expression of admiration for Giuseppe Settembrini as of dismay and rejection. And he honestly did attempt not to judge what was alien to him, but simply to define and compare. He was back in the “den” and saw Hans Lorenz’s narrow head bent down over the pale golden circle of the baptismal bowl, that abiding, mutable heirloom; and he saw him round his lips to form the syllable “great,” that pious, somber sound that reminded you of places where as you walked you fell into a reverential, forward rocking motion. And he saw Giuseppe Settembrini—the tricolor in one hand, a swinging saber in the other, black eyes turned heavenward to seal his vow—at the head of a troop of revolutionaries storming the phalanx of despotism. Each had his beauty and honor, he thought, trying all the harder to be fair because he knew his own personal or partly personal biases. Grandfather Settembrini had struggled for political rights—but his own grandfather, or at least his ancestors, had originally possessed all those rights, which over the course of four centuries the rabble had wrested from them by force and slogans. And so they had both worn black, the grandfather in the North and the one in the South, and both for the purpose of drawing a strict line between themselves and the evil present. But the one had done so to show his reverence for the past and to honor death, to which his whole being already belonged; the other, in contrast, had done so out of rebellion and a belief in irreverent progress. “Yes, those were two worlds, two opposing points of the compass,” Hans Castorp thought, and as Herr Settembrini went on talking, he stood there halfway between them, so to speak, casting a critical eye first on the one and then the other; and it seemed to him that he had experienced all this once before. He remembered a lonely boat ride on a lake in Holstein several years before—in late summer, at twilight. It had been around seven o’clock, the sun had set, an almost full moon had already risen above the wooded shore to the east. And for ten minutes, while Hans Castorp rowed across the still water, it all became a baffling, dreamlike scene. Bright daylight reigned in the west—glassy, cool, definitive light; but if he turned his head, he found himself gazing into utterly magical moonlit night draped in a web of mist. This strange condition was held in balance for almost a quarter of an hour before it tipped in favor of night and the moon, and all the while Hans Castorp’s dazzled and bewildered eyes moved in serene amazement between one landscape and luminary and the other, from day to night and out of night back into day. It all came back to him now."

"»Herr Settembrini ist Literat«, sagte Joachim erläuternd und etwas verlegen. »Er hat für deutsche Blätter den Nachruf für Carducci geschrieben, – Carducci, weißt du.« Und er wurde noch verlegener, da sein Vetter ihn verwundert ansah und zu sagen schien: Was weißt denn du von Carducci?

Neither do I, I should think.","“Herr Settembrini is a literary man,” Joachim explained, rather self-consciously. “He wrote the obituary notices of Carducci for the German papers—Carducci, you know.” He got more self-conscious still, for his cousin looked at him in amazement, as though to say: “Carducci? What do you know about him? Not any more than I do, I’ll wager.”","“Herr Settembrini is a literary man,” Joachim said, explaining with some embarrassment. “He wrote the obituary of Carducci for the German papers—Carducci, you know.” And he grew even more embarrassed when his cousin looked at him in amazement as if to say: “What do you know about Carducci? About as much as I do, I bet.”"
Hans Castorp hatte sich seinem Vetter heftig zugewandt. »War das die Hujus?« fragte er aufgebracht. »Und wieso: ›aus dem Keller‹?«,"Hans Castorp had turned violently to his cousin. ""Was that the Hujus?"" he asked angrily. ""And why: 'from the basement'?""",Hans Castorp had turned with violence to face his cousin. “Was that the Hujus?” he asked abruptly. “And how do you mean—out of a cellar?”,Hans Castorp had turned abruptly to face his cousin. “And was that the Hujus girl?” he asked in exasperation. “But why ‘from a deep cellar’?”
"»Du siehst, es hat mir nichts gemacht, ich bin ganz gut mit ihr fertig geworden. Ich werde überhaupt mit solchen Leuten ganz gut fertig, glaube ich, ich verstehe mich von Natur auf den Umgang mit ihnen, – meinst du nicht auch? Ich glaube sogar, {168}ich komme mit traurigen Menschen im ganzen besser aus, als mit lustigen, weiß Gott, woran es liegt, vielleicht daran, daß ich doch Waise bin und meine Eltern so früh verloren habe, aber wenn die Leute ernst und traurig sind und der Tod im Spiele ist, das bedrückt mich eigentlich nicht und macht mich nicht verlegen, sondern ich fühle mich dabei in meinem Element und jedenfalls besser, als wenn es so forsch zugeht, das liegt mir weniger. Neulich dachte ich: Es ist doch eine Albernheit von den hiesigen Damen, sich dermaßen vor dem Tode zu graulen und allem, was damit zusammenhängt, daß man sie ängstlich davor bewahren muß und das Viatikum bringt, wenn sie gerade essen. Nein, pfui, das ist läppisch. Siehst du nicht ganz gern einen Sarg? Ich sehe ganz gern mal einen. Ich finde, ein Sarg ist ein geradezu schönes Möbel, schon wenn er leer ist, aber wenn jemand darin liegt, dann ist es direkt feierlich in meinen Augen. Begräbnisse haben so etwas Erbauliches, – ich habe schon manchmal gedacht, man sollte, statt in die Kirche, zu einem Begräbnis gehen, wenn man sich ein bißchen erbauen will. Die Leute haben gutes schwarzes Zeug an und nehmen die Hüte ab und sehen auf den Sarg und halten sich ernst und andächtig, und niemand darf faule Witze machen, wie sonst im Leben. Das habe ich sehr gern, wenn sie endlich mal ein bißchen andächtig sind. Manchmal habe ich mich schon gefragt, ob ich nicht Pastor hätte werden sollen, – in gewisser Weise hätte das, glaube ich, nicht schlecht für mich gepaßt … Hoffentlich habe ich keinen Fehler im Französischen gemacht bei dem, was ich sagte?«","""You see, it didn't bother me, I dealt with her quite well. I get along with people like that quite well, I think, I know how to deal with them by nature - don't you think so? I even think {168}I get along better with sad people than with happy ones, God knows why, maybe because I'm an orphan and lost my parents so early, but when the people are serious and sad and death is involved, that doesn't really depress me and doesn't make me embarrassed, but I feel in my element and in any case better than when things are so bold, that suits me less. The other day I thought: It's just silly for the ladies here to be so terrified of death and everything that has to do with it that they have to be anxiously protected from it and brought the Viatikum when they're eating. No, ugh, that's silly. Don't you like to see a coffin? I'd love to see one. I think a coffin is an almost beautiful piece of furniture even when it's empty, but when someone's in it it's directly celebratory to me. There's something edifying about funerals—I've sometimes thought that if you want to edify yourself a little, you should go to a funeral instead of to church. People wear good black stuff and take off their hats and look at the coffin and keep themselves serious and reverent, and nobody's allowed to make silly jokes like the rest of life. I like that very much when they are finally a little devout. I've sometimes wondered if I shouldn't have been a pastor - in a way I don't think that would have suited me badly... I hope I didn't make a mistake in French in what I said?'","But Hans Castorp said as they walked on: “You see, I didn’t mind it at all, I got on with her quite well; I always do with such people; I understand instinctively how to go at them— don’t you think so? I even think, on the whole, I get on better with sad people than with jolly ones—goodness knows why. Perhaps it’s because I’m an orphan, and lost my parents early ; but when people are very serious, or down in the mouth, or somebody dies, it doesn’t deject or embarrass me; I feel quite in my element, a good deal more so than when everything is going on greased wheels. I was thinking just lately that it is pretty flat of the women up here to take on as they do about death and things connected with death, so that they take such pains to shield them from contact with it, and bring the Eucharist at meal-times, and that. I call it very feeble of them. Don’t you like the sight of a coffin? I really do. I find it a handsome piece of furniture, even empty; when someone is lying in it, then, in my eyes, it is positively sublime. Funerals have something very edifying; I always think one ought to go to a funeral instead of to church when one feels the need of being uplifted. People have on good black clothes, and they take off their hats and look at the coffin, and behave serious and reverent, and nobody dares to make a bad joke, the way they do in ordinary life. It’s good for people to be serious, once in a way. I’ve sometimes asked myself if I ought not to have become a clergyman— in a certain way it wouldn’t have suited me so badly.—I hope I didn’t make any mistake in my French?”","I managed very nicely with her. I can handle people like that very nicely in general. I believe I have a natural understanding of how to deal with them—don’t you think so, too? I even think that on the whole I get along with sad people better than with happy ones—God only knows why, perhaps because I am an orphan and lost my parents so early on. But when people are serious and sad or if death is involved, it doesn’t really depress or embarrass me. Instead, I feel in my element somehow, or at least better than when things are just chugging right along—I’m less good at that. I was thinking only recently that it’s really foolish the way the local ladies carry on about death and things connected with it, that everyone is so skittish, protecting them and making sure the last rites are brought while they’re downstairs eating. No, phooey! That’s silly. Don’t you love to look at coffins? I’ve always enjoyed looking at one now and then. I think of a coffin as an absolutely lovely piece of furniture, even when it’s empty, and if there’s someone lying in it, it’s really quite sublime in my eyes. There’s something so edifying about funerals—I’ve sometimes thought that when we need a little spiritual uplift, we should attend funerals rather than church. People wear their best black clothes and take their hats off and gaze at the coffin and seem so serious and devout—and no one dares make bad jokes, the way they normally do. I really do like it for people to be a little more devout once in a while. Sometimes I’ve asked myself if I shouldn’t have been a pastor —in some ways I don’t think I would have made a bad one. . . .I hope there weren’t any mistakes in my French when I answered—were there?”"
"Verglichen mit solchen Erscheinungen also konnte Mynheer Peeperkorn fast farblos wirken.

Man sah das Leben und Treiben in einem Eingeborenendorf von Neumecklenburg, einen Hahnenkampf auf Borneo, nackte Wilde, die auf Nasenflöten bliesen, das Einfangen wilder Elefanten, eine Zeremonie am siamesischen Königshof, eine Bordellstraße in Japan, wo Geishas hinter hölzernen Käfiggittern saßen. Man sah vermummte Samojeden im Renntierschlitten durch eine nordasiatische Schneeöde kutschieren, russische Pilger zu Hebron anbeten, an einem persischen Delinquenten die Bastonade vollziehen. Man war zugegen bei alldem; der Raum war vernichtet, die Zeit zurückgestellt, das Dort und Damals in ein huschendes, gaukelndes, von Musik umspieltes Hier und Jetzt verwandelt. Ein junges marokkanisches Weib, in gestreifter Seide, aufgeschirrt mit Ketten, Spangen und Ringen, die strotzende Brust halb entblößt, ward plötzlich in Lebensgröße angenähert. Ihre Nüstern waren breit, ihre Augen voll tierischen Lebens, ihre Züge in Bewegung; sie lachte mit weißen Zähnen, hielt eine ihrer Hände, deren Nägel heller schienen, als das Fleisch, als Schirm über die Augen und winkte mit der anderen ins Publikum. Man starrte verlegen in das Gesicht des reizvollen Schattens, der zu sehen schien und nicht sah, der von den Blicken gar nicht berührt wurde, und dessen Lachen und Winken nicht die Gegenwart meinte, sondern im Dort und Damals zu Hause war, so daß es sinnlos gewesen wäre, es zu erwidern. Dies mischte, wie {482}gesagt, der Lust ein Gefühl der Ohnmacht bei. Dann verschwand das Phantom. Leere Helligkeit überzog die Tafel, das Wort »Ende« ward darauf geworfen, der Zyklus der Darbietungen hatte sich geschlossen, und stumm räumte man das Theater, während von außen neues Publikum hereindrängte, das eine Wiederholung des Ablaufs zu genießen begehrte.","The despot died under the knife with an open-mouthed roar that was not heard. Pictures from all over the world were then seen: the President of the French Republic in top hat and great cordon, from the seat of the landau, responding to a speech of welcome; the Viceroy of India at the wedding of a Rajah; the German crown prince in a barracks courtyard in Potsdam. You saw life and activity in a native village of Neumecklenburg, a cockfight in Borneo, naked savages blowing nose flutes, the capture of wild elephants, a ceremony at the Siamese royal court, a brothel street in Japan where geishas sat behind wooden cage bars. One saw hooded Samoyeds driving in reindeer sleighs through a North Asian snowy wasteland, Russian pilgrims worshiping at Hebron, bastinating a Persian delinquent. One was present at all this; space was destroyed, time put back, the there and then transformed into a scurrying, jiggling here and now surrounded by music. A young Moroccan woman, in striped silk, harnessed with chains, clasps, and rings, her bulging breast half bared, was suddenly approached to life size. Her nostrils were wide, her eyes full of animal life, her features moving; she laughed with white teeth, holding one of her hands, whose nails seemed lighter than flesh, as a screen over her eyes, and waved the other to the audience. One stared in embarrassment into the face of the attractive shadow, who seemed to see and not see, who was not touched by the looks at all, and whose laughter and wave did not mean the present, but was at home in the there and then, so that it makes no sense would have been to reply. This, as {482}said, mixed pleasure with a feeling of powerlessness. Then the phantom disappeared. Empty brightness covered the table, the word ""End"" was thrown at it, the cycle of performances had come to an end, and the theater was silently cleared while new audiences crowded in from outside, who desired to enjoy a repetition of the process.","The despot died beneath the knife, with a soundless shriek. Then came scenes from all parts of the world: the President of the French Republic, in top-hat and cordon, sitting in a landau and replying to a speech of welcome; the Viceroy of India, at the wedding of a rajah; the German Crown Prince in the courtyard of a Potsdam garrison. There was a picture of life in a New Mecklenburg village; a cock-fight in Borneo, naked savages blowing on nose-horns, a wild elephant hunt, a ceremony at the court of the King of Siam, a courtesans’ street in Japan, with geishas sitting behind wooden lattices; Samoyeds bundled in furs, driving sledges drawn by reindeer through the snowy wastes of Siberia; Russian pilgrims praying at Hebron; a Persian criminal under the knout. They were present at all these scenes; space was annihilated, the clock put back, the then and there played on by music and transformed into a juggling, scurrying now and here. A young Moroccan woman, in a costume of striped silk, with trappings in the shape of chains, bracelets, and rings, her swelling breasts half bared, was suddenly brought so close to the camera as to be life-sized; one could see the dilated nostrils, the eyes full of animal life, the features in play as she showed her white teeth in a laugh, and held one of her hands, with its blanched nails, for a shade to her eyes, while with the other she waved to the audience, who stared, taken aback, into the face of the charming apparition. It seemed to see and saw not, it was not moved by the glances bent upon it, its smile and nod were not of the present but of the past, so that the impulse to respond was baffled, and lost in a feeling of impotence. Then the phantom vanished. The screen glared white and empty, with the one word Finis written across it. The entertainment was over, in silence the theatre was emptied, a new audience took the place of that going out, and before their eager eyes the cycle would presently unroll itself again.","The despot was dispatched by a knife, his mouth opened for a bellow that no one heard. They now saw pictures from all over the world: the top-hatted president of the French republic reviewing a long cordon, then sitting in his landau to reply to a welcoming speech; the viceroy of India at the wedding of a rajah; the German crown prince on a barracks drill field in Potsdam. They observed the life and customs of an aboriginal village on New Mecklenburg, a cockfight on Borneo, naked savages blowing on nose flutes, the capture of wild elephants, a ceremony at the Siamese royal court, a street of brothels in Japan with geishas sitting caged behind wooden lattices. They watched Samoyeds bundled in furs driving sleds pulled by reindeer across the snowy wastes of northern Asia, Russian pilgrims praying at Hebron, a Persian criminal being bastinadoed. They were present at each event—space was negated, time turned back, “then and there” transformed by music into a skittering, phantasmagoric “here and now.” A young Moroccan woman dressed in striped silk and harnessed with chains, bangles, and rings, her swelling breasts half-bared, was suddenly brought nearer until she was life-size. Her nostrils were flared wide, her eyes full of animal life, her features vivacious; she laughed, showing her white teeth, held up one hand—the nails seemed lighter than her skin—to shield her eyes, and waved at the audience with the other. People stared in bewilderment at the face of this charming specter, who seemed to see them and yet did not, who was not at all affected by their gaze, and whose laughter and waves were not meant for the present, but belonged to the then and there of home—it would have been pointless to respond. And so, as noted, their delight was mixed with a sense of helplessness. Then the phantom vanished. A bright void filled the screen, the word Finis was projected on it, this cycle of entertainments was over, and the people left the theater in silence as a new audience pushed its way in, eager to enjoy another roll of the reels."
"»Ich wiederhole, Ingenieur, daß Sie ein Schalk sind«, sagte der Italiener. Er empfahl sich in den angenehmsten Formen. Mit seinem Vetter allein geblieben, seufzte Hans Castorp auf.","""I repeat, Engineer, that you are a rogue,"" said the Italian. He recommended himself in the most agreeable forms. Left alone with his cousin, Hans Castorp sighed.","“I repeat, Engineer, you are a wag,” said the Italian. He took leave gracefully and went. Alone with his cousin, Hans Castorp heaved a sigh.","“I repeat, my good engineer, you are a wag,” the Italian said. He took leave of them very courteously. Left alone with his cousin, Hans Castorp heaved a great sigh."
"»Eher«, erwiderte Joachim. »Wir warten auch schon fast eine halbe Stunde.«","""Rather,"" replied Joachim. ""We've been waiting for almost half an hour.""","“Rather,” responded Joachim. “We have been waiting nearly half an hour already.”",“Rather!” Joachim replied. “We’ve been waiting almost a half hour now.”
"Auch diese Entdeckung also setzte dem jungen Hans Castorp nicht wenig zu, obgleich die klägliche Schaubegier des Mannheimers ihn nicht in dem Sinne beunruhigen konnte, wie der Privatverkehr Clawdia Chauchats mit Hofrat Behrens, einem ihm an Alter, Person und Lebensstellung so übergeordneten Mann. Clawdia kümmerte sich gar nicht um den Mannheimer, – es wäre Hans Castorps innerer Geschärftheit nicht entgangen, wenn es der Fall gewesen wäre, und nicht der widrige Stachel der Eifersucht war es also in diesem Falle, den er in der Seele spürte. Aber er erprobte alle Empfindungen, die Rausch und Leidenschaft eben erproben, wenn sie in der Außenwelt ihrer selbst ansichtig werden, und die das sonderbarste Gemisch aus Ekel- und Gemeinschaftsgefühlen bilden. Unmöglich, alles zu ergründen und auseinanderzulegen, wenn wir von der Stelle {320}kommen wollen. Auf jeden Fall war es viel auf einmal für seine Verhältnisse, was auch die Beobachtung des Mannheimers dem armen Hans Castorp zu durchkosten gab.","This discovery did not bother the young Hans Castorp a little, although the Mannheimer's pitiful curiosity for show did not alarm him in the same way as Clawdia Chauchat's private dealings with Hofrat Behrens, a man so superior to him in age, person and position in life. Clawdia didn't bother about the Mannheimer at all - it would not have escaped Hans Castorp's inner acuity if it had been the case, and in this case it was not the repellent thorn of jealousy that he felt in his soul. But he tested all the sensations that intoxication and passion experience when they see themselves in the outside world, and which form the strangest mixture of feelings of disgust and community. Impossible to fathom and dissect everything if we want to come from place {320}. In any case, it was a lot at once for his standards, which the observation of the Mannheimer gave poor Hans Castorp a taste of.","This discovery of his affected young Hans Castorp no little, though the plaintive, devouring gaze of the Mannheimer did not trouble his rest like the thought of Clavdia Chauchat’s private relations with Hofrat Behrens, a man so much his superior in age, person, and position. Clavdia took no interest in the Mannheimer—had she done so , it would not have escaped Hans Castorp’s perception; in this case it was not the dart of jealousy he felt pierce his soul. But he did have all the sensations which the drunkenness of passion knows, when it sees its own case duplicated in the outer world, and which form a most fantastic mixture of disgust and fellow-feeling. To explore and lay open all the windings of his emotions would keep us far too long; suffice it to say that his observation of the Mannheimer gave our poor young friend enough to think on and to suffer.","This discovery also caused young Hans Castorp no little worry, although the Mannheimer’s sad, greedy looks did not trouble him as much as the private relations between Clavdia Chauchat and Director Behrens—a man very much his superior in age, character, and position. Clavdia paid no attention to the man from Mannheim—if she had, it certainly would not have escaped Hans Castorp’s sharpened instincts. And so it was not the nasty thorn of jealousy that pricked his soul in this case. But he did explore all the feelings that intoxication and passion can explore once they catch a glimpse of themselves in the world outside, feelings that are the strangest mixture of disgust and shared emotions. If we are to get on with our story, however, it will be impossible to fathom and analyze all of that. In any case, the added emotional experience of observing the patient from Mannheim was almost too much for a man like poor Hans Castorp to have to deal with all at once."
"Die schlaffen Hautsäcke unter ihren jettschwarzen Augen waren so groß und schwer, wie er es noch bei keinem Menschen gesehen. Ein leiser, welker Duft ging von ihr aus. Es war ihm sanft und ernst um das Herz.","The sagging sacks of skin under her jet-black eyes were bigger and heavier than anyone else had ever seen. A faint, withered scent emanated from her. His heart was gentle and serious.",The lax pouches of skin under her jet-black eyes were larger and heavier than he had ever seen. She exhaled a faint odour as of fading flowers. A mild and pensive feeling stole about his heart.,"The drooping bags of skin under her jet-black eyes were larger and heavier than any he had ever seen. A faint, wilted odor came from her. A mild, grave warmth stole over his heart."
"»Ich dachte nur,« sagte Hans Castorp, »das Fieber käme von meinem Katarrh.«","""I just thought,"" said Hans Castorp, ""that the fever was from my catarrh.""","“I thought,” Hans Castorp said, “that the fever came from my cold.”","“I just assumed,” Hans Castorp said, “the fever came from my catarrh.”"
"So denn auch an Hans Castorps Tage. Sie hatte ihm wohl beim Essen einmal bedeutlich zuzuzwinkern versucht, aber da er dem Zeichen mit leerer Miene begegnet war, hatte sie sich schleunig zurückgezogen. Auch Joachim hatte gegen den Vetter geschwiegen, und doch war er des Datums wohl eingedenk gewesen, an dem er den Zu-Besuch-Kommenden von Station »Dorf« abgeholt hatte. Aber Joachim, zum Reden von Natur schon nicht sehr geneigt, bei weitem nicht so, wie Hans Castorp es wenigstens hier oben geworden, von Humanisten und Rabulisten ihrer Bekanntschaft ganz zu schweigen, – Joachim hatte sich in letzter Zeit eine besondere und auffallende Schweigsamkeit angeeignet, nur Einsilbigkeiten kamen noch über seine Lippen, aber in seiner Miene arbeitete es. Es war klar, daß sich für ihn mit Station »Dorf« andere Vorstellungen verbanden als die des Abholens und der Ankunft … Er stand in regem Briefwechsel mit dem Flachlande. Entschlüsse reiften in ihm. Vorbereitungen, die er traf, näherten sich ihrem Abschluß.","So then also in Hans Castorp's days. She must have tried to wink at him once while eating, but since he had met the sign with a blank expression, she had quickly withdrawn. Joachim, too, had kept silent about his cousin, and yet he had remembered the date on which he had picked up the visitor from the ""Village"" station. But Joachim, by nature not very inclined to talk, not nearly as much as Hans Castorp has become at least up here, not to mention humanists and ruffians of their acquaintance - Joachim had recently acquired a special and striking taciturnity, only monosyllabic words escaped his lips, but his expression was working. It was clear that for him station ""Village"" had other ideas than picking up and arriving... He was in lively correspondence with the lowlands. Decisions matured in him. Preparations he made were nearing completion.","Thus also on Hans Castorp’s anniversary. She may have even tried to nod at him meaningfully, at table; but encountering a vacant stare dexterously withdrew. Joachim too had kept silence, though he probably had clearly in mind the date on which he had fetched the guest from the Dorf station. Joachim was ever by nature taciturn; had always talked less than his cousin, even before they came up here— there had never been any comparison between him and the humanists and controversialists of their acquaintance—and in these days his silence had assumed heroic proportions, only monosyllables passed his lips. His manner, however, spoke volumes. It was plain that in his mind the Dorf station was associated with another order of ideas than those of arrival or meeting people. He was conducting a lively correspondence with the flatland; his resolve was ripening, his preparations drawing to a head.","It was the same on Hans Castorp’s anniversary. She had indeed tried to give him a meaningful wink at breakfast, but when his only response was a vacant stare, she quickly pulled back. Even Joachim had said nothing to his cousin, although he was well aware of the date on which he had met his “three-week guest” at the station in Dorf. Joachim was not very talkative by nature—definitely not as talkative as Hans Castorp had become up here, not to mention certain humanists and humbugs of their acquaintance—but the silence he had adopted of late was peculiar and impressive. Only monosyllables passed his lips—while the muscles in his face worked hard. It was clear that for him the station at Dorf was associated with more than arrivals or meeting guests. He was corresponding regularly with the flatlands now. Decisions were ripening within him. The preparations he was making were almost concluded."
"Man lachte, und da der Humanist auffahren wollte, erzählte Hans Castorp rasch von Schlägen, die er selbst einst empfangen: auf seinem Gymnasium war in den unteren Klassen diese Strafe teilweise noch getätigt worden, es waren Reetstöcke vorhanden gewesen, und wenn auch die Lehrer an ihn nicht Hand hatten legen mögen, gesellschaftlicher Rücksicht halber, so war er doch von einem stärkeren Mitschüler einmal geprügelt worden, einem großen Flegel, mit dem biegsamen Stock auf die Oberschenkel und die nur mit Strümpfen bekleideten Waden, und das hatte ganz schmählich weh getan, infam, unvergeßlich, geradezu mystisch, unter schändlich innigem Stoßschluchzen waren ihm die Tränen nur so hervorgestürzt vor Wut und ehrlosem Wehsal – Herr Wehsal mochte freundlichst das Wort entschuldigen –, und Hans Castorp hatte denn auch gelesen, daß in Zuchthäusern bei Empfang der Prügelstrafe die stärksten Raubmörder wie kleine Kinder flennten.","People laughed, and since the humanist wanted to burst out, Hans Castorp quickly told of the beatings he himself had once received: this punishment had sometimes still been imposed in the lower classes at his grammar school, there had been thatched sticks, even if the teachers were on had not wanted to lay hands on him, out of social consideration, he had been beaten by a stronger classmate, a big lout, with a flexible stick on his thighs and his calves, which were only clad in stockings, and that had hurt terribly, infamous, unforgettable, downright mystical, with shameful, heartfelt sobs, his tears had spurted out of anger and dishonorable misery - Mr. Wehsal would kindly excuse the word - and Hans Castorp had also read that in prisons the strongest are when they receive beatings Murderers cried like little children.","Everybody laughed; but while the humanist was bringing up his guns, Hans Castorp hastily began to talk about a beating he had once received, when he was in one of the lower forms in the gymnasium, where this form of punishment still survived to some extent, and there were always switches on hand. His, Hans Castorp’s social position had been too good for the masters to venture to lay hands on him; but he had once been whipped by a stronger pupil, a big lout of a fellow who had laid on with the flexible switch across Hans Castorp’s thin-stockinged calves. It had hurt so confoundedly— so “mystically”—that he had fairly sobbed for rage, and the tears had ignominiously flowed down. And he recalled having read that in the penitentiaries, when men are flogged, the most hardened reprobates will blubber like little children.","They all laughed, and before the humanist could fly off the handle, Hans Castorp quickly told about a thrashing he had once received—a punishment still administered sometimes in the lower grades of his high school, where there had been riding crops in every room; and although social disparities had prevented teachers from laying a hand on him, he had once been thrashed by a bigger classmate, a lout of a fellow, who had applied the supple switch to his thighs and calves, right through his thin stockings, and it had hurt something awful, he would never forget, it had been beastly, almost mystical, and to his shame he had heaved great sobs and hot tears of rage and agony had flowed—and here Hans Castorp begged Herr Wehsal’s pardon for using the obscure word “Wehsal” for “agony.” He had also read that even the strongest cutthroats, when they were flogged in prison, blubbered like children."
"Er ließ seine Zeitung langsam sinken und schob das Gesicht etwas höher, so daß sein Kopf weiter oben, nur mit dem Haarwirbel an der steilen Stuhllehne lag. Er schloß sogar die Augen ein wenig, tat sie aber gleich wieder auf, um sie schräg aufwärts, in der Richtung, die seinem Blick durch die Haltung seines Kopfes gewiesen war, irgendwohin ins Leere zu richten. Der Gute, man hätte sagen mögen, sein Ausdruck habe fast etwas Seherisches und Somnambules. Er wünschte, sie möchte noch einmal fragen, doch das geschah nicht. So war er nicht einmal sicher, ob sie noch hinter ihm stände, als er nach geraumer Zeit, mit sonderbarer Verspätung und halber Stimme zur Antwort gab:","He slowly lowered his newspaper and pushed his face a little higher so that his head was higher up, only with the tangle of hair on the steep chair arm. He even closed his eyes a little, but immediately opened them again to aim them obliquely upwards, in the direction indicated by the position of his head, somewhere in the void. The good one, one might have said that his expression had something almost visionary and somnambulistic about it. He wished she would ask again, but she didn't. So he wasn't even sure if she was still standing behind him when he answered after a while, with a strange delay and half a voice:","Slowly he let his newspaper fall, and turned his face up a little, so that the crown of his head came against the straight back of his chair. He even closed his eyes, but quickly opened them, and gazed somewhere into space— the expression on the poor wight’s face was well-nigh that of a sleep-walker, or clairvoyant. He wished she might ask again, but she did not, he was not even sure she still stood behind him, when, after all that pause, so tardily and with scarce audible voice he answered: “He is dead.","He slowly lowered his newspaper and lifted his face a little higher so that his head was raised, but with only his cowlick touching the straight chairback. He even closed his eyes a little, but immediately opened them again, and without changing the position of his head directed his gaze up and to one side into nowhere. Poor fellow—one might have been tempted to say he had the look of a clairvoyant or a sleepwalker. He wanted to hear the question repeated, but that did not happen. And so he was not even certain whether she was still standing behind him, when after a considerable pause he belatedly answered in almost a whisper: “"
"- Täglich ging Joachim zum Pinseln. Es war ein schöner Herbst, in weißen Flanellhosen zum blauen Rock kam er öfters verspätet von der Behandlung zum Essen, proper und militärisch, grüßte knapp, freundlich und männlich zusammengenommen, indem er seiner Säumigkeit wegen um Pardon bat, und setzte sich zu seiner Mahlzeit nieder, die man ihm jetzt besonders bereitete, da er bei der gewöhnlichen Kost, der Verschluckungsgefahr wegen, nicht mitkam: er erhielt Suppen, Haschees und Brei. Schnell hatten die Tischgenossen die Lage begriffen. Sie erwiderten seinen Gruß mit nachdrücklicher Höflichkeit und Wärme, indem sie ihn »Herr Leutnant« anredeten. In seiner Abwesenheit befragten sie Hans Castorp, und auch von den anderen Tischen kam man zu ihm und fragte. Frau Stöhr kam mit gerungenen Händen und lamentierte ungebildet. Aber Hans Castorp antwortete nur einsilbig, räumte den Ernst des Zwischenfalles ein, leugnete jedoch bis zu einem gewissen Grade, tat es ehrenhalber, aus dem Gefühle, Joachim nicht vorzeitig preisgeben zu dürfen.","- Joachim went to brush every day. It was a beautiful autumn, in white flannel pants with a blue coat he often came late from treatment to dinner, proper and military, greeted curtly, friendly and manly, asking for pardon because of his delay, and sat down to his meal , which was specially prepared for him now that he couldn't keep up with the usual fare because of the danger of choking: he was given soup, hash and porridge. The table companions quickly understood the situation. They returned his greeting with emphatic courtesy and warmth, addressing him ""Leutenant."" In his absence they questioned Hans Castorp, and people from the other tables came up to him and asked questions. Frau Stohr came with wringed hands and lamented uneducated. But Hans Castorp only answered in monosyllables, admitted the seriousness of the incident, but denied it to a certain extent, did it out of honor, out of the feeling that he should not be allowed to give up Joachim prematurely.","Daily Joachim went to be painted, in the fine autumn weather. In white flannel trousers and blue blazer, he would come back late from his treatment, neat and military; would enter the dining-room, make his little bow, courteous and composed, in excuse of his tardiness, and sit down to his meal, which was specially prepared, for he no longer ate the regular food, on account of the danger of choking; he received minces and broths. His table-mates grasped quickly the state of affairs. They returned his greetings with unusual warmth, and addressed him as Lieutenant. When he was not there they asked after him of Hans Castorp; and even people from the other tables came up to inquire. Frau Stöhr wrung her hands, and exhausted herself in vulgar lamentations. But Hans Castorp replied only in monosyllables, admitted the seriousness of the affair, yet to a certain extent made light of it, in the honourable design not to betray his cousin untimely.","Every day Joachim went to have his throat painted. It was a beautiful autumn; his treatments often meant that he came late to dinner in his white flannels and blue coat, looking proper and military, offering curt, friendly, manly, unruffled greetings, begging to be excused for his tardiness, and then sitting down to his meal, which was now prepared especially for him since he could not eat the regular menu for fear of choking. He was served soups, stews, and porridges. His tablemates were quick to realize the situation. They responded to his greetings with poignant courtesy and warmth, addressing him as “Herr Lieutenant.” In his absence they asked Hans Castorp about him, and people even came over from other tables to ask. Frau Stöhr arrived wringing her hands and making uncultured lamentation. But Hans Castorp replied only in monosyllables, admitted the seriousness of the situation, but also lied to a certain extent—though honorably, out of a sense that one ought not to abandon Joachim so soon."
"James Tienappel, den Hans Castorp abwechselnd »Onkel James« und einfach nur »James« anredete, war ein langbeiniger Herr von gegen Vierzig, gekleidet in englische Stoffe und blütenhafte Wäsche, mit kanariengelbem, gelichtetem Haar, nahe beisammenliegenden blauen Augen, einem strohigen, gestutzten, halb wegrasierten Schnurrbärtchen und bestens gepflegten Händen. Gatte und Vater seit einigen Jahren, ohne darum genötigt gewesen zu sein, die geräumige Villa des alten Konsuls am Harvestehuder Weg zu verlassen, – vermählt mit einer Angehörigen seines Gesellschaftskreises, die ebenso zivilisiert und fein, von ebenso leiser, rascher und spitzig-höflicher Sprechweise war wie er selbst, gab er zu Hause einen sehr energischen, umsichtigen und bei aller Eleganz kalt sachlichen Geschäftsmann ab, nahm aber in fremdem Sittenbereich, auf Reisen, etwa im Süden des Landes, ein gewisses überstürztes Entgegenkommen in sein Wesen auf, eine höflich eilfertige Bereitwilligkeit zur Selbstverleugnung, in der sich nichts weniger als eine Unsicherheit der eigenen Kultur, sondern im Gegenteil {653}das Bewußtsein ihrer starken Geschlossenheit bekundete, nebst dem Wunsche, seine aristokratische Bedingtheit zu korrigieren und selbst inmitten von Lebensformen, die er unglaublich fand, nichts von Befremdung merken zu lassen. »Natürlich, gewiß, selbstvers-tändlich!« beeilte er sich zu sagen, damit niemand denke, er sei zwar fein, aber beschränkt. Hierher gekommen nun freilich in einer bestimmten sachlichen Sendung, nämlich mit dem Auftrage und der Absicht, energisch nach dem Rechten zu sehen, den säumigen jungen Verwandten, wie er sich innerlich ausdrückte, »loszueisen« und daheim wieder einzuliefern, war er sich doch wohl bewußt, auf fremdem Boden zu operieren, – schon im ersten Augenblicke empfindlich von der Ahnung berührt, daß eine Welt und Sittensphäre ihn als Gast aufgenommen habe, die an geschlossener Selbstsicherheit seiner eigenen nicht nur nicht nachstand, sondern sie sogar noch darin übertraf, so daß seine Geschäftsenergie sofort in Zwiespalt mit seiner Wohlerzogenheit geriet und zwar in einen sehr schweren; denn die Selbstgewißheit der Wirtssphäre erwies sich als wahrhaft erdrückend.","James Tienappel, whom Hans Castorp addressed alternately 'Uncle James' and just 'James', was a long-legged gentleman of about forty, dressed in English fabrics and flower-like linen, with canary-yellow thinning hair, blue eyes set close together, a strawy, cropped one , half-shaved mustache and perfectly manicured hands. Husband and father for a few years without having to leave the old Consul's spacious villa on Harvestehuder Weg - married to a member of his social circle who was just as civilized and refined, spoke just as quietly, quickly and pointedly and politely was like himself, at home he made a very energetic, prudent and, for all his elegance, coldly matter-of-fact businessman, but in foreign customs, when traveling, for example in the south of the country, he took on a certain hasty concession, a polite hasty manner Readiness for self-denial, in which nothing less than an insecurity of one's own culture was expressed, but on the contrary {653}the consciousness of its strong unity, together with the wish to correct its aristocratic conditionality and even in the midst of forms of life that he found incredible, nothing to let notice of alienation. ""Of course, of course, of course!"" he hastened to say, lest any one think that he was subtle, though subtle. Of course, he was well aware that he had come here on a specific business mission, namely with the assignment and the intention of energetically seeing to it that things were going well, ""unlocking"" the defaulting young relatives, as he put it inwardly, and delivering them back home, as he was well aware to operate on foreign soil, - from the very first moment he was sensitively touched by the suspicion that a world and moral sphere had received him as a guest, which not only was not inferior to his own in closed self-confidence, but even surpassed it, so that his business energy immediately at odds with his good manners, and a very serious one at that; for the self-assurance of the host sphere turned out to be truly overwhelming.","James Tienappel, whom Hans Castorp addressed by turns as Uncle James and James, was a long-legged man close to the forties, dressed in good English suiting and florid linen; with thinnish canary-yellow hair, blue eyes set close together, a closeclipped, straw-coloured moustache, and carefully manicured hands. He had continued to live in the old Consul’s roomy villa in Harvestehuder Way, though he had been a husband and father for some years, having taken a wife from his own social sphere, of his own highly civilized and elegant type, with the same soft, quick, pointedly polite manner of speech. In his own sphere he passed for a very energetic, cautious and— despite his refined ways—coldly practical man of business. But outside it—when he travelled south, for instance—he displayed a kind of eager pliancy, a quick and friendly readiness to step outside his own personality, which was by no means a sign of the insecurity of his own culture, but rather betrayed a conviction of its sufficiency, and a desire to correct his own aristocratic limitations; it evidenced a wish not to show surprise at new ways, even when he found them extraordinary past belief. “Certainly, of course,” he would hasten to remark, so that nobody might say of him that with all his elegance he was limited. He had come up here on a definite practical mission, to see how matters stood with his dilatory young kinsman, to “prize him loose,” as he put it to himself, and take him back home. But he was conscious that he was operating on foreign territory; and the first few minutes up here had made him suspect that he was a guest in a sphere quite foreign to him, and more instead of less self-assured than his own. His business instincts conflicted with his good breeding—the more keenly the more he was aware of the self-confident poise of the institutional life.","James Tienappel, whom Hans Castorp addressed by turns as “Uncle James” or simply “James,” was a long-legged gentleman nearing forty, who wore English suits and linens white as cherry blossoms; he had thinning, canary-yellow hair, very close-set blue eyes, a straw-colored moustache trimmed so close that it was almost not there, and perfectly manicured hands. A husband and father now for several years, he had not, however, been required to leave the old consul’s roomy villa on Harvestehuder Weg. He was married to a woman who had come from his own social circle, a lady as civilized and refined as he, who spoke in the same soft, rapid, pointedly polite fashion. At home he gave the impression of a very energetic, prudent, and—despite his elegance—cold, practical man of business; but when traveling in regions whose customs were strange to him, in the south of Germany, for instance, he was all too quick to be polite and self-effacing and assumed a certain impetuous amiability, which was in no way the result of insecurity about his own culture, but on the contrary reflected both an awareness of its solid integrity and a desire to improve on his own aristocratic tendencies—even amid customs he found simply incredible, he would show no surprise whatever. “Naturally, but of course, to be sure,” he was always prompt to say, so that no one would think that, although he might be quite refined, he was rather narrow-minded. Having come here on a definite practical mission— that is, for the express purpose of having an energetic look around, of checking up on his “lackadaisical” young relative, as he put it, of “prying him loose” and taking him home—he was quite aware that he was operating on foreign soil; and from the first moment, he had been acutely sensitive to a suspicion that he was now the guest of a world, a social community, with a self-assurance as intact as that of the world from which he came, indeed surpassing it in that regard, so that his business energies were at once in conflict with his good breeding—in very serious conflict, because the self-assurance of the world of his hosts turned out to be truly overwhelming."
"Ein Frostschauer überlief ihn, – einer und dann mehrere rasch hintereinander. Hans Castorp sprang auf und lief zum Wandthermometer, als gelte es, ihn in flagranti zu ertappen. Nach Réaumur waren neun Grad im Zimmer. Er faßte die Röhren an und fand sie tot und kalt. Er murmelte etwas Ungeordnetes, des Inhalts, wenn auch August sei, so sei es doch {137}eine Schande, daß nicht geheizt werde, denn nicht auf den Monatsnamen komme es an, den man eben schreibe, sondern auf die herrschende Temperatur, und die sei so, daß ihn friere wie einen Hund. Aber sein Gesicht brannte. Er setzte sich wieder, stand nochmals auf, bat murmelnd um Erlaubnis, Joachims Bettdecke nehmen zu dürfen und breitete sie sich, im Stuhle sitzend, über den Unterkörper. So saß er, hitzig und fröstelnd, und quälte sich mit der widerlich schmeckenden Zigarre. Ein großes Elendsgefühl überkam ihn; ihm war, als sei es ihm noch nie im Leben so schlecht ergangen. »Das ist ja ein Elend!« murmelte er. Dazwischen aber berührte ihn plötzlich ein ganz absonderlich ausschweifendes Gefühl der Freude und Hoffnung, und als er es empfunden hatte, saß er nur noch da, um zu warten, ob es nicht vielleicht wiederkäme. Es kam aber nicht wieder; nur das Elend blieb. Und so stand er denn schließlich auf, warf Joachims Decke aufs Bett zurück, murmelte verzerrten Mundes etwas wie »Gute Nacht!« und »Erfriere nur nicht!« und »Zum Frühstück holst du mich ja wohl wieder« und schwankte über den Korridor in sein Zimmer hinüber.","A shiver of frost ran over him--one, and then several in rapid succession. Hans Castorp jumped up and ran to the wall thermometer as if to catch him red-handed. According to Réaumur, the room was nine degrees. He touched the tubes and found them dead and cold. He murmured something disorderly, the content, although it was August, it was a shame that there was no heating, because it didn't depend on the name of the month that you just wrote, but on the prevailing temperature, and that be so that he freezes like a dog. But his face burned. He sat down again, stood up again, murmured his permission to take Joachim's blanket and, sitting in the chair, spread it over his lower body. So he sat, hot and shivering, and tormented himself with the disgusting-tasting cigar. A great feeling of misery came over him; he felt as if he had never had it so bad in his life. ""What a misery!"" he murmured. In between, however, he was suddenly touched by a very peculiar, extravagant feeling of joy and hope, and when he had felt it, he just sat there to wait to see if it might not come again. But it didn't come back; only misery remained. And so he finally got up, threw Joachim's blanket back on the bed, mumbled something like ""Good night!"" and ""Don't freeze to death!"" and ""You'll fetch me back for breakfast,"" and staggered across the corridor to his room over.","A shiver ran over him, then several, one after the other. Hans Castorp sprang up and ran to the thermometer on the wall, as if to catch it in flagrante. According to the mercury, there were fifty degrees of heat in the room. He clutched the radiator; it was cold and dead. He murmured something incoherent, to the effect that it was a scandal to have no heating, even if it was August. It wasn’t a question of the name of the month, but of the temperature that obtained, which was such that actually he was as cold as a dog. Yet his face burned. He sat down, stood up again, and with a murmured request for permission fetched Joachim’s coverlet and spread it out over himself as he sat in the chair. And thus he remained, hot and cold by turns, torturing himself with his nauseous cigar. He was overcome by a wave of wretchedness; it seemed to him he had never in his life before felt quite so miserable. “I feel simply wretched,” he muttered. And suddenly he was moved by an extraordinary and extravagant thrill of joy and suspense, of which he was so conscious that he sat motionless waiting for it to come again. It did not—only the misery remained. He stood up at last, flung Joachim’s coverlet on the bed, and got something out that sounded like a good-night: “Don’t freeze to death; call me again in the morning,” his lips hardly shaping the words; then he staggered along the corridor to his own room.","He felt a chill and shivered—first once, then several times. Hans Castorp leapt up and ran over to the wall thermometer as if hoping to catch it flagrante delicto. It read fifty-two degrees Fahrenheit. He felt the pipes of the radiator; they were cold and dead. He muttered something incoherent, rambling on to the effect that even if it was August, it would be no disgrace to heat the place, because it wasn’t a matter of the month, but of the temperature, and right now it was so low that he was freezing to death. But his face was burning. He sat back down, then stood up again, muttered a request to use the blanket from Joachim’s bed, spread it over his legs, and went back to sitting—flushed, chilled, and tormenting himself with the disgusting taste of his cigar. A wave of misery swept over him—it seemed as if he had never felt this miserable in all his life. “This is wretched,” he murmured. But suddenly, a curiously extravagant sense of joy and hope stirred within him, and he sat up, waiting to see if it would return. But it didn’t; only the misery remained. Finally he stood up, tossed Joachim’s blanket back on the bed, and with wrenched lips he muttered something that sounded like: “Good night. Don’t freeze out there, and call me again for breakfast”—and staggered out to the corridor and into his room."
"Zum militärischen Dienst wurde er seinerseits nicht herangezogen. Seine innere Natur widerstrebte dem und wußte es zu verhindern. Auch mochte wohl sein, daß Stabsarzt Dr. Eberding, der am Harvestehuder Weg verkehrte, von Konsul Tienappel gesprächsweise gehört hatte, daß der junge Castorp in der Nötigung sich zu bewaffnen eine empfindliche Störung seiner soeben auswärts begonnenen Studien erblicken würde.","For his part, he was not called up for military service. His inner nature opposed this and knew how to prevent it. It might also be that staff physician Dr. Eberding, who frequented Harvestehuder Weg, had heard from Consul Tienappel that young Castorp would see the need to arm himself as a serious disruption to his studies that had just begun abroad.","To military service he was not inclined. His being revolted against it, and found ways of making difficulties. It may be, too, that Staff Medical Officer Dr. Eberding, who visited at Harvestehuderstrasse, heard from Consul Tienappel, in the course of conversation, that young Castorp was leaving home to begin his technical studies, and would find a call to the colours a very sensible interruption to his labours.","He was not attracted to military service himself. Something deep within him resisted the idea, and he knew how to avoid it. It may also be that Dr. Eberding, the staff surgeon, who was a regular on Harvestehuder Weg, had heard in casual conversation with Consul Tienappel that young Castorp, having just left for the university, would regard being forced to bear arms as a serious disruption in his studies."

"Hans Castorp wußte, warum er Herrn Settembrini zuhörte, nicht ausdrücklich, aber er wußte es. Etwas wie Pflichtgefühl war dabei, außer jener Ferien-Verantwortungslosigkeit des Reisenden und Hospitanten, der sich gegen keinen Eindruck verhärtet und die Dinge an sich herankommen läßt, in dem Bewußtsein, daß er morgen oder übermorgen wieder die Flügel lüften und in die gewohnte Ordnung zurückkehren wird: – etwas wie eine Gewissensvorschrift also, und zwar, um genau zu sein, die Vorschrift und Mahnung eines irgendwie schlechten Gewissens, bestimmte ihn, dem Italiener zuzuhören, ein Bein über das andere geschlagen und an seiner Maria Mancini ziehend, oder wenn sie zu dritt vom Englischen Viertel gegen den Berghof emporstiegen.","Hans Castorp did not specifically know why he was listening to Herr Settembrini, but he did. There was something like a sense of duty, apart from that holiday irresponsibility of the traveler and visitor who refuses to react to any impressions and lets things come to him, in the knowledge that tomorrow or the day after he will lift his wings again and return to his usual order : – something like a precept of conscience, to be precise, the precept and admonition of a somehow bad conscience, made him listen to the Italian, one leg crossed and tugging at his Maria Mancini, or if they were three climbed up from the English Quarter towards the Berghof.","Hans Castorp knew—without putting it into so many words—why he lent an ear to Herr Settembrini. Partly it was out of a sense of duty; though also out of that holiday mood of taking everything as it came, rejecting nothing, in the knowledge that in another day or so he would spread his wings and fly back to the wonted order of things. Yes, he knew it was largely the promptings of conscience to which he hearkened; to be precise, the promptings of a conscience not altogether easy—as he sat listening to the Italian, one leg crossed over the other, drawing at his Maria Mancini; or when the three of them climbed the hill from the English quarter.","Hans Castorp knew why he listened to Herr Settembrini, not in so many words, but he knew. It was partly out of a sense of duty—but it was also the irresponsibility of the vacationer and visitor who does not wish to harden himself against new impressions and takes things as they come, well aware that tomorrow or the day after he will spread his wings and return to his accustomed routine. But conscience—or more precisely, the qualms of a conscience uneasy for some reason—demanded that he listen to the Italian, whether he was sitting there with one leg crossed over the other, puffing on his Maria Mancini, or all three of them were on their way back from the English quarter, climbing the hill to the Berghof."
"Hans Castorp, im Gedränge, sah über Joachims Schulter einem Zeichnenden zu, indem er sich mit dem Ellbogen auf diese Schulter stützte, sein Kinn mit allen fünf Fingern erfaßt hielt und die andere Hand in die Hüfte stemmte. Er redete und lachte. Er wollte ebenfalls zeichnen, verlangte laut danach und erhielt den Bleistift, ein schon ganz kurzes Ding, man konnte ihn nur noch mit Daumen und Zeigefinger führen. Er schimpfte auf den Stummel, das blinde Gesicht zur Decke erhoben, schimpfte laut und verfluchte die Undienlichkeit des Stiftes, indem er mit fliegender Hand einen gräulichen Unsinn auf den Karton warf, schließlich sogar diesen verfehlte und auf das Tischtuch geriet. »Das gilt nicht!« rief er in das verdiente Gelächter hinein. »Wie soll man mit einem solchen – zum Teufel damit!« Und er warf den beschuldigten Stummel in die Punschbowle. »Wer hat einen vernünftigen Bleistift? Wer leiht mir einen? Ich muß noch einmal zeichnen! Einen Bleistift, einen Bleistift! Wer hat noch einen?« rief er nach beiden Seiten aus, den linken Unterarm noch auf die Tischplatte gestützt und die rechte Hand hoch in der Luft schüttelnd. Er bekam keinen. Da wandte er sich um und ging ins Zimmer hinein, indem er zu rufen fortfuhr, – ging gerade auf Clawdia Chauchat zu, die, wie er gewußt hatte, nicht weit von der Portiere zum kleinen Salon stand und von hier aus dem Treiben am Bowlentisch lächelnd zugesehen hatte.","Hans Castorp, in the crowd, watched a draftsman over Joachim's shoulder, leaning on his shoulder with his elbow, holding his chin with all five fingers and resting his other hand on his hip. He talked and laughed. He also wanted to draw, asked loudly for it and was given the pencil, which was already a very short thing, you could only guide it with your thumb and forefinger. He cursed the stub, his blind face raised to the ceiling, cursed loudly and cursed the inconvenience of the pen, throwing a ghastly nonsense on the box with flying hands, finally missing even it and ending up on the tablecloth. ""That doesn't count!"" he cried into the deserved laughter. ""How should one do with such a - the hell with it!"" And he threw the accused stub into the punch bowl. 'Who's got a decent pencil? Who lends me one? I have to draw again! A pencil, a pencil! he called out to both sides, left forearm still resting on the tabletop and right hand shaking high in the air. He didn't get one. Then he turned and went into the room, continuing to call out—went straight up to Clavdia Chauchat, who, as he had known, was standing not far from the doorman in the little drawing-room, and from there smiling at the goings-on at the bowling table had watched.","Hans Castorp stood in the thick of the crowd, at Joachim’s back, watching. He rested his elbow on his cousin’s shoulder and supported his chin with all five fingers of that hand, his other arm set akimbo on his hip. He was talking and laughing, anxious to try his skill; asked on all sides for a pencil, and at length received a stump of a thing, hardly to be held between thumb and forefinger. Then he shut his eyes, lifted his face to the ceiling, and drew, all the time uttering objurgations against the pencil, some horrible inanity upon the paper, in his haste spoiling even this, and running off the paper on to the tablecloth. “That doesn’t count!” he cried as his audience burst out in well-merited jeers. “What can you do with a pencil like that—deuce take it!” and he flung the offending morsel into the punch-bowl. “Has anybody a decent one? Who will lend me a pencil? I must have another try. A pencil, a pencil, who has a pencil?” he shouted, leaning with his left hand on the table, and shaking the other high in the air. There was no answer. Then he turned and, passing through the room, went straight up to Clavdia Chauchat, who, as he was well aware, was standing near the door of the little salon, watching with a smile the throng round the punchtable.","Hans Castorp joined the crowd to watch a contestant, stood looking over Joachim’s shoulder, propping one elbow against it while holding his chin tight in all five fingers, his other hand braced at his hip. He talked and laughed. He wanted to draw, too, demanded loudly he be allowed to, and was given the pencil, already just a stump of a thing that you could barely hold between your thumb and forefinger. He cursed the pencil, raised his head toward the ceiling and closed his eyes; loudly damning the useless pencil again and cursing just in general, he hastily drew some atrocity on the paper, at one point missing it entirely and ending up on the tablecloth. “That doesn’t count!” he shouted amid well-deserved laughter. “How can I possibly draw with a thing like that—to hell with it!” And he tossed the offending stump into the punch bowl. “Who has a decent pencil? Who’ll lend me one? I have to try again. A pencil, a real pencil! Does anyone have a pencil?” he called out to all sides, keeping his left forearm propped against the tabletop, but raising his right hand and shaking it in the air. No one had a pencil for him. He turned around and walked back into the room, continuing to shout—headed directly toward Clavdia Chauchat, who, as he well knew, was standing just beyond the portieres in the little salon, smiling and watching the goings-on around the punch bowl."
"Kann man die Zeit erzählen, diese selbst, als solche, an und für sich? Wahrhaftig, nein, das wäre ein närrisches Unterfangen! Eine Erzählung, die ginge: »Die Zeit verfloß, sie verrann, es strömte die Zeit« und so immer fort, – das könnte gesunden Sinnes wohl niemand eine Erzählung nennen. Es wäre, als wollte man hirnverbrannterweise eine Stunde lang ein und denselben Ton oder Akkord aushalten und das – für Musik ausgeben. Denn die Erzählung gleicht der Musik darin, daß sie die Zeit erfüllt, sie »anständig ausfüllt«, sie »einteilt« und macht, daß »etwas daran« und »etwas los damit« ist – um mit der wehmütigen Pietät, die man Aussprüchen Verstorbener widmet, Gelegenheitsworte des seligen Joachim anzuführen: längst verklungene Worte, – wir wissen nicht, ob sich der Leser noch ganz im klaren darüber ist, wie lange verklungen. Die Zeit ist das Element der Erzählung, wie sie das Element des Lebens ist, – unlösbar damit verbunden, wie mit den Körpern im Raum. Sie ist auch das Element der Musik, als welche die Zeit mißt und gliedert, sie kurzweilig und kostbar auf einmal macht: verwandt hierin, wie gesagt, der Erzählung, die ebenfalls (und anders als das auf einmal leuchtend gegenwärtige und nur als Körper an die Zeit gebundene Werk der bildenden Kunst) nur als ein Nacheinander, nicht anders denn als ein Ablaufendes sich zu geben weiß, und selbst, wenn sie versuchen sollte, in jedem Augenblick ganz da zu sein, der Zeit zu ihrer Erscheinung bedarf.","Can one narrate time, this itself, as such, in and for itself? Truly, no, that would be a foolish undertaking! A story that went: “Time passed, it ran away, time flowed” and so on and on—no one with a healthy mind could call that a story. It would be like wanting to insanely endure the same note or chord for an hour and pass it off as music. For narration is like music in that it fills time, ""fills it up properly,"" ""divides"" it, and makes ""something about it"" and ""something wrong with it""—to do with the melancholy piety that one pays to expressions of the dead dedicates to citing occasional words of the blessed Joachim: words that have long since faded away - we do not know whether the reader is still quite clear about how long faded away. Time is the element of the story, as it is the element of life - inseparably connected with it, as with the bodies in space. It is also the element of music, as which measures and structures time, making it entertaining and precious all at once: related here, as I said, to narration, which also (and unlike what is suddenly luminously present and only as a body to the time-bound work of fine art) only knows how to present itself as a succession, nothing other than as something elapsing, and even if it should try to be completely there at every moment, which requires time for its appearance.","CAN one tell—that is to say, narrate—time, time itself, as such, for its own sake? That would surely be an absurd undertaking. A story which read: “Time passed, it ran on, the time flowed onward” and so forth—no one in his senses could consider that a narrative. It would be as though one held a single note or chord for a whole hour, and called it music. For narration resembles music in this, that it fills up the time. It “fills it in” and “breaks it up,” so that “there’s something to it,” “something going on”—to quote, with due and mournful piety, those casual phrases of our departed Joachim, all echo of which so long ago died away. So long ago, indeed, that we wonder if the reader is clear how long ago it was. For time is the medium of narration, as it is the medium of life. Both are inextricably bound up with it, as inextricably as are bodies in space. Similarly, time is the medium of music; music divides, measures, articulates time, and can shorten it, yet enhance its value, both at once. Thus music and narration are alike, in that they can only present themselves as a flowing, as a succession in time, as one thing after another; and both differ from the plastic arts, which are complete in the present, and unrelated to time save as all bodies are, whereas narration—like music—even if it should try to be completely present at any given moment, would need time to do it in.","Can one narrate time—time as such, in and of itself? Most certainly not, what a foolish undertaking that would be. The story would go: “Time passed, ran on, flowed in a mighty stream,” and on and on in the same vein. No one with any common sense could call that a narrative. It would be the same as if someone took the harebrained notion of holding a single note or chord for hours on end—and called it music. Because a story is like music in that it fills time, “fills it up so nice and properly,” “divides it up,” so that there is “something to it,” “something going on”—to quote, with the melancholy reverence one shows to statements made by the dead, a few casual comments of the late Joachim, phrases that faded away long ago, and we are not sure if the reader is quite clear just how long ago that was. Time is the element of narration, just as it is the element of life—is inextricably bound up with it, as bodies are in space. It is also the element of music, which itself measures and divides time, making it suddenly diverting and precious; and related to music, as we have noted, is the story, which also can only present itself in successive events, as movement toward an end (and not as something suddenly, brilliantly present, like a work of visual art, which is pure body bound to time), and even if it would try to be totally here in each moment, would still need time for its presentation."
"»Kann ich Ihnen auch nicht sagen, wo sie den aufgegabelt hat«, erklärte er. »Eine Reisebekanntschaft offenbar, von den Pyrenäen her, nehme ich an. Tja, den müssen Sie nun erst mal in Kauf nehmen, Sie enttäuschter Seladon, hilft Ihnen alles {829}nichts. Dicke Freundschaft, verstehen Sie. Wie es scheint, haben sie sogar gemeinsame Reisekasse. Der Mann ist schwer reich, nach allem, was ich höre. Kaffeekönig in Ruhestand, müssen Sie wissen, malaiischer Kammerdiener, opulente Umstände. Übrigens kommt er bestimmt nicht zum Spaß, denn außer einer gehörigen alkoholischen Verschleimung scheint malignes Tropenfieber vorzuliegen, Wechselfieber, verstehen Sie, verschleppt, hartnäckig. Sie werden Geduld mit ihm haben müssen.«","""I can't tell you where she picked it up either,"" he explained. 'A travel acquaintance, apparently, from the Pyrenees, I assume.

"Es war ein kühler, bedeckter Morgen – gegen halb neun Uhr. {180}Wie er es sich vorgenommen, atmete Hans Castorp tief die reine Frühluft, diese frische und leichte Atmosphäre, die mühelos einging und ohne Feuchtigkeitsduft, ohne Gehalt, ohne Erinnerungen war … Er überschritt den Wasserlauf und das Schmalspurgeleise, gelangte auf die unregelmäßig bebaute Straße, verließ sie gleich wieder und schlug einen Wiesenpfad ein, der nur ein kurzes Stück zu ebener Erde lief und dann schräg hin und ziemlich steil den rechtsseitigen Hang emporführte. Das Steigen freute Hans Castorp, seine Brust weitete sich, er schob mit der Stockkrücke den Hut aus der Stirn, und als er, aus einiger Höhe zurückblickend, in der Ferne den Spiegel des Sees gewahrte, an dem er auf der Herreise vorübergekommen war, begann er zu singen.","It was a cool, overcast morning - about eight-thirty. {180}As he had planned, Hans Castorp breathed deeply the pure morning air, this fresh and light atmosphere, which went in effortlessly and was without the scent of moisture, without content, without memories ... He crossed the watercourse and the narrow-gauge railway, reached the irregularly built-up area left the street immediately and took a meadow path that ran only a short distance on the ground and then led diagonally and rather steeply up the slope on the right. Hans Castorp was delighted at the climb, his chest expanded, he pushed his hat off his forehead with his crutch, and when, looking back from a certain height, he saw in the distance the mirror of the lake he had passed on the journey down, he began him to sing.","It was about nine o’clock of a cool morning, with a covered sky. According to programme, Hans Castorp drew in deep draughts of the pure morning air, the fresh, light atmosphere that breathed in so easily, that held no hint of damp, that was without associations, without content. He crossed the stream and the narrow-gauge road to the street, with its scattered buildings; but left this again soon to strike into a meadow path, which went only a short way on the level and then slanted steeply up to the right. The climbing rejoiced Hans Castorp’s heart , his chest expanded, he pushed his hat back on his forehead with the crook of his stick; having gained some little height he looked back, and, seeing in the distance the mirror-like lake he had passed on his journey hither, he began to sing.","It was almost half past eight on a cool, cloudy morning. As he had planned, Hans Castorp breathed deeply of fresh, light, early-morning air that went so easily into the lungs and had neither odor nor moisture nor content, that evoked no memories. He crossed the brook and the narrow-gauge tracks, came out on the main road with its irregular pattern of buildings, and left it almost at once for a meadow path, which ran on level ground for only a short while and then led up the slope on his right at a rather steep angle. Hans Castorp enjoyed the climb; his chest expanded, he pushed his hat back from his brow with his cane, and when from a good height he looked back around and saw in the distance the surface of the lake his train had passed on arrival, he began to sing."
"Solche Erzeugnisse also waren es, die Kamerad Krokowski bei der Arbeit mit den Seinen letztlich anstrebte. Stämmig und kernig lächelnd, zu fröhlichem Vertrauen auffordernd, strebte er sie an, heimisch für seine untersetzte Person im Sumpfig-Verdächtigen und Untermenschlichen und ein rechter Führer denn also, sogar für Zaghafte und Zweifelvolle in diesen Bezirken. Auch schien, dank Ellen Brands außerordentlichen Gaben, die zu entwickeln, zu züchten er sich angelegen sein ließ, der Erfolg ihm zu lächeln, nach allem, was Hans Castorp erfuhr. Berührungen einzelner Teilnehmer durch materialisierte Hände hatten sich ereignet. Staatsanwalt Paravant hatte aus der Transzendenz eine derbe Backpfeife empfangen und mit wissenschaftlicher Heiterkeit quittiert, ja, vor Begier sogar noch die andere Backe hingehalten, – ungeachtet seiner Eigenschaften als Kavalier, Jurist und Alter Herr einer schlagenden Verbindung, welche alle ihn zu einem ganz anderen Verhalten würden genötigt haben, wäre der Streich vitaler Herkunft gewesen. A. K. Ferge, dieser schlichte Dulder, dem alles Höhere fernlag, hatte eines Abends ein solches Geisterglied in seiner eigenen Hand gehalten und durch den Tastsinn die Richtigkeit und Vollständigkeit seiner Bildung festgestellt, worauf es sich seinem Griff, der herzhaft in den Grenzen des Respektes gewesen war, auf nicht genau zu beschreibende Weise entzogen {1015}hatte. Es dauerte geraume Frist, wohl zweieinhalb Monate, bei zwei Sitzungen wöchentlich, bis eine Hand so hinterweltlicher Herkunft, rötlich angestrahlt von einem mit rotem Papier verdunkelten Tischlämpchen – eines jungen Mannes Hand, wie es hatte scheinen wollen, – über der Tischplatte fingernd sich allen Blicken dargestellt und in einer irdenen Schüssel mit Mehl ihre Spur hinterlassen hatte. Aber nur acht Tage später geschah es, daß eine Gruppe von Mitarbeitern Dr. Krokowskis, Herr Albin, die Stöhr, das Ehepaar Magnus, noch gegen Mitternacht mit allen Anzeichen verzerrter Begeisterung und fieberigen Entzückens in Hans Castorps Balkonloge erschien und dem in beißendem Froste Dämmernden in fliegendem Durcheinander berichtete, Ellys Holger habe sich sehen lassen, über der Schulter der Somnambulen habe sein Kopf sich gezeigt, er habe wirklich »schöne braune, braune Locken« gehabt und so unvergeßlich sanft und melancholisch gelächelt, bevor er verschwand!","Such products were what comrade Krokowski ultimately aimed for when working with his family. Burly and pithy smiling, inviting cheerful confidence he aspired to, native to his squat persona in the swampy-suspect and subhuman, and a right guide then, even to the timid and doubtful in those precincts. Also, thanks to Ellen Brand's extraordinary gifts, which he took it upon himself to develop and breed, success seemed to smile on him, after all that Hans Castorp found out. Touches of individual participants by materialized hands had occurred. Prosecutor Paravant had received a harsh slap in the face from transcendence and acknowledged it with scientific amusement, yes, even turned the other cheek out of desire - regardless of his qualities as a cavalier, lawyer and old gentleman of a striking connection, all of which led him to a completely different behavior would have needed if the prank had been of vital origin. AK Ferge, this simple sufferer, who was far removed from anything higher, had held such a spirit member in his own hand one evening and ascertained by touch the correctness and completeness of its formation, whereupon he seized his grip, which had been hearty within the bounds of respect , {1015}had withdrawn in a way that cannot be described precisely. It took a long time, probably two and a half months, with two sessions a week, until a hand of such inscrutable origin, illuminated reddishly by a table lamp shaded with red paper - a young man's hand, it seemed - fingering over the tabletop caught everyone's attention depicted and left their mark in an earthenware bowl of flour. But just eight days later it happened that a group of associates of Dr. The Krokowskis, Herr Albin, the Stöhrs, the Magnus couple, appeared in Hans Castorp’s balcony box around midnight with all the signs of distorted enthusiasm and feverish delight and reported to the man, who was dozing in the biting frost in a flurry of confusion, that Ellys Holger had been seen, over the shoulder of the His head showed itself to somnambulists, he really had ""beautiful brown, brown curls"" and smiled so unforgettably, softly and melancholically, before he disappeared!","Such manifestations it was that Comrade Krokowski, with the assistance of his followers, was latterly striving to produce; sturdily, with his ingratiating smile, challenging their cordial confidence, thoroughly at home, for his own person, in this questionable morass of the subhuman, and a born leader for the timid and compunctious in the regions where they now moved. He had laid himself out to develop and discipline the extraordinary powers of Ellen Brand and, from what Hans Castorp could hear, fortune smiled upon his efforts. Some of the party had felt the touch of materialized hands. Lawyer Paravant had received out of transcendency a sounding slap on the cheek, and had countered with scientific alacrity, yes, had even eagerly turned the other cheek, heedless of his quality as gentleman, jurist, and onetime member of a duelling corps, all of which would have constrained him to quite a different line of conduct had the blow been of terrestrial origin. A. K. Ferge, that good-natured martyr, to whom all “highbrow” thought was foreign, had one evening held such a spirit hand in his own, and established by sense of touch that it was whole and well shaped. His clasp had been heart-felt to the limits of respect; but it had in some indescribable fashion escaped him. A considerable period elapsed, some two months and a half of biweekly sittings, before a hand of other-worldly origin, a young man’s hand, it seemed, came fingering over the table, in the red glow of the papershaded lamp, and, plain to the eyes of all the circle, left its imprint in an earthenware basin full of flour. And eight days later a troop of Krokowski’s workers, Herr Albin, Frau Stöhr, the Magnuses, burst in upon Hans Castorp where he sat dozing toward midnight in the biting cold of his balcony, and witn every mark of distracted and feverish delight, their words tumbling over one another, announced that they had seen Elly’s Holger—he had showed his head over the shoulder of the little medium, and had in truth “beautiful brown, brown curls.” He had smiled with such unforgettable, gentle melancholy as he vanished!","Such were the results, then, that Comrade Krokowski worked hard to produce with the help of his followers. With a rugged, pithy smile he cheerfully bade them trust him as he strove to make them feel at home in these swampy, suspicious, and subhuman regions, enjoined them to see in his stout person a true leader, even for the timid and those dubious about such matters. And thanks to Ellen Brand’s extraordinary talents, which he had made it his business to develop and cultivate, success smiled on him—to judge from everything Hans Castorp heard. Various participants had been touched by materialized hands. Prosecutor Paravant had been given a hefty slap on the cheek from the transcendent world, and had received it with scientific amusement, had even eagerly turned the other cheek—despite his being a cavalier, lawyer, and alumnus of a dueling fraternity, all of which would have demanded quite different conduct had the blow’s origin been from the world of the living. A. K. Ferge, the simple martyr to whom all higher things were foreign, had held such a ghostly hand in his own hand one evening and had determined by touch that it was well formed and whole, whereupon, by some means he could not quite describe, it had withdrawn itself from his grip, which though hearty had been quite within the bounds of respect. It took a good while, some two and a half months, with two sittings per week, until a hand of otherworldly origins appeared for all to see, a young man’s hand—or so it seemed under the reddish light of a ceiling lamp covered with red paper—that fingered its way across the tabletop and left traces in an earthen bowl of flour. But only eight days later, a group of Dr. Krokowski’s assistants—Herr Albin, Frau Stöhr, Herr and Frau Magnus—appeared around midnight on Hans Castorp’s balcony, where he had lain dozing in the biting chill; and with all the signs of distracted excitement and feverish delight, they told him in a hasty jumble of voices that Elly’s Holger had let himself be seen, had shown his head above the shoulder of that somnambulant lady—and he really did have “beautiful brown, brown locks”—and had smiled an unforgettably gentle and melancholy smile before vanishing."
"»Aber nein, pfui, Herr Castorp! Das ist nicht schön von Ihnen, daß Sie mich so in Verlegenheit bringen mit Ihren Anspielungen. Alle merken es ja, daß wir es auf sie abgesehen haben, und daß Sie mir Dinge sagen, über die ich rot werden muß …«","“But no, fie, Herr Castorp! It's not nice of you to embarrass me with your allusions. Everyone can tell that we're after them and that you're telling me things that make me blush...""","And the schoolmistress, who really had blushed and tucked her head down over her cup, would mumble out of the left-hand corner of her mouth: “Shame on you, Herr Castorp! It really is too bad of you to embarrass me like this. Everyone can see we are talking about her and that you have said something to make me get red.”","And the teacher, who had indeed blushed and was now bent deep over her cup, whispered out of the left corner of her mouth, “Shame, shame, Herr Castorp. It isn’t at all nice of you to embarrass me with your insinuations. Everyone has already noticed that it’s her we’re talking about and that you’re saying things to make me blush.”"
"»Oh, es gibt noch eine Menge ähnlich bedeutender Titel für die Hoch- und Templergrade der Strikten Observanz. Wir haben da einen Vollkommenen Meister, einen Ritter vom Osten, einen Großen Oberpriester, und der einunddreißigste Grad heißt sogar der ›Erhabene Fürst des königlichen Geheimnisses‹. Sie bemerken, daß alle diese Namen auf Beziehungen zur morgenländischen Mystik deuten. Das Wiedererscheinen des {769}Templers selbst bedeutete nichts anderes, als die Aufnahme solcher Beziehungen, tatsächlich den Einbruch irrationalen Gärstoffes in eine Ideenwelt vernünftig-nützlicher Gesellschaftsverbesserung. Dadurch gewann das Maurertum einen neuen Reiz und Glanz, der den Zulauf erklärt, dessen es sich damals erfreute. Es zog sämtliche Elemente an sich, die der Vernünftelei des Jahrhunderts, seiner humanen Auf- und Abgeklärtheit müde waren und nach stärkeren Lebenstränken durstig. Der Erfolg des Ordens war derart, daß die Philister klagten, er entfremde die Männer dem häuslichen Glück und der weiblichen Würde.«","'Oh, there are plenty of similarly significant titles for the High and Templar degrees of the Strict Observance. We have a Perfect Master, a Knight of the East, a Great High Priest, and the thirty-first grade is even called the Exalted Prince of Royal Secrets. You notice that all these names point to ties to oriental mysticism. The reappearance of the {769}Templar himself meant nothing other than the establishment of such relationships, in fact the incursion of irrational ferment into a world of ideas of rationally useful social improvement. This gave Masonry a new charm and splendor which explains the popularity it enjoyed at the time. It attracted all elements that were tired of the rationality of the century, its humane enlightenment and serenity, and thirsty for stronger potions of life. Such was the success of the order that the Philistines complained that it alienated men from domestic happiness and womanly dignity.”","“Oh, there are a host more such titles in the upper reaches of the Knights Templars. There are a Past Grand Master, a Knight of the East, a Grand High-priest—the thirtyfirst degree is called Noble Prince of the Royal Mysteries. You observe that all these names have reference to oriental mysticism. The reappearance of the Templars, indeed, means nothing else than the entrance of such conceptions, the presence of irrational ferments in a world given over to rational-utilitarian ideas of social improvement. This it was which lent Freemasonry a new brilliance and charm, and explains the great number of recruits to it at that period of its history. It drew to itself all the elements which were weary of the rationalistic twaddle of the century, and thirsting for a stronger draught of life. The success of the order was such that the Philistine complained of it for estranging men from domestic happiness and destroying their reverence for women.”","“Oh, there are a whole lot of similar imposing titles for the higher degrees in the Grand and Templar lodges of the strict charges. There is a Perfect Master, a King of the East, a Grand High Priest, and the thirty-first degree is called Exalted Prince of the Royal Mysteries. You will note that all these names bear some connection to Oriental mysticism. The reemergence of the Templars had meant nothing less than the establishment of such connections; it had introduced the ferment of irrationality into an intellectual world concerned with rational, practical social improvement. All of which gave Freemasonry a new fascination and luster, which explains the increased popularity it enjoyed at the time. It attracted various elements who were weary of their century’s sophistries, of its humane, dispassionate enlightenment, and were thirsty for stronger elixirs. The order’s success was such that the philistines complained that it was alienating men from domestic bliss and a reverence for women.”"
"»Sehen Sie, wie klein und blank er ist,« sagte Herr Albin, »aber wenn ich hier drücke, so beißt er zu …« Ein neues Gekreisch. »Er ist natürlich scharf geladen«, fuhr Herr Albin fort. »In dieser Scheibe hier stecken die sechs Patronen, die dreht sich bei jedem Schuß um ein Loch weiter … Übrigens halte ich mir das Ding nicht zum Spaß«, sagte er, da er bemerkte, daß die Wirkung sich abnutzte, ließ den Revolver in die Brusttasche gleiten und setzte sich wieder mit übergeschlagenem Bein auf seinen Stuhl, indem er sich eine frische Zigarette anzündete. »Durchaus nicht zum Spaß«, wiederholte er und preßte die Lippen zusammen.","'See how small and bare he is,' said Herr Albin, 'but if I press here he bites...' Another screech. 'It's loaded, of course,' Mr Albin went on. ""There are six cartridges in this disc, which rotates one hole with every shot ... By the way, I don't keep this thing for fun,"" he said, noticing that the effect was wearing off, and put the revolver in the pocket and sat back in his chair, cross-legged, lighting a fresh cigarette. ""Not for fun at all,"" he repeated, pursing his lips.","“Look how little and shiny he is,” said Herr Albin. “But when I press him here, then he bites.” Another outcry. “Of course, he is loaded—to the hilt,” he continued. “In this disk here are the six cartridges. It turns one hole at each shot. But I don’t keep him merely for a joke,” he said noticing that the sensation was wearing off. He let the revolver slip into his breast pocket, sat down again, flung one leg over the other, and lighted a fresh cigarette. “Certainly not for a joke,” he repeated, and compressed his lips.","“Look how small and shiny it is,” Herr Albin said, “but if I press right here—it will bite.” New shrieks. “It’s loaded with live ammunition, of course,” Herr Albin continued. “There are six cartridges in this cylinder here, which moves ahead one chamber with every shot. And by the by, I don’t keep this thing just for fun,” he said, noticing that the effect was wearing off. He slipped the revolver back into his breast pocket, sat back down on his chair, crossed his legs, and lit another cigarette. “Definitely not just for fun,” he repeated, pressing his lips together."
"»Man sieht, es gibt eine Art, zu verallgemeinern, die den Gegenstand persönlich färbt. Sie hätten Lust, zu töten?«","“You see, there is a way of generalizing that personalizes the subject. Would you like to kill?”","Herr Ferge breathed a sigh, Settembrini shrewdly remarked: “There is a kind of generalization that has a distinctly personal cast. Have you ever had a desire to commit murder?”","Settembrini responded with a subtle remark: “It seems some generalizations reflect on the person making them. You feel a desire to kill, do you?”"
"Er freute sich seiner Errungenschaft, vor welcher die Unzugänglichkeit sich auftat und Hindernisse fast zunichte wurden. Sie umgab ihn mit erwünschter Einsamkeit, der erdenklich tiefsten sogar, einer Einsamkeit, die das Herz mit Empfindungen des menschlich Wildfremden und Kritischen berührte. Da war wohl zu seiner einen Seite ein Tannenabsturz hinab in Schneedunst und andererseits ein Felsenaufstieg mit ungeheueren, zyklopischen, gewölbten und gebuckelten, Höhlen und {717}Kappen bildenden Schneemassen. Die Stille, wenn er regungslos stehen blieb, um sich selbst nicht zu hören, war unbedingt und vollkommen, eine wattierte Lautlosigkeit, unbekannt, nie vernommen, sonst nirgends vorkommend. Da war kein Windhauch, der die Bäume auch nur aufs leiseste gerührt hätte, kein Rauschen, nicht eine Vogelstimme. Es war das Urschweigen, das Hans Castorp belauschte, wenn er so stand, auf seinen Stock gestützt, den Kopf zur Schulter geneigt, mit offenem Munde; und still und unablässig schneite es weiter darin, ruhig hinsinkend, ohne einen Laut.","He rejoiced in his achievement, before which inaccessibility opened up and obstacles almost came to naught. She surrounded him with the desired solitude, the deepest imaginable, a solitude that touched the heart with feelings of the completely human and critical. On one side there was a fall of fir trees in a haze of snow, and on the other an ascent of rocks with immense, cyclopean, arched and humped masses of snow forming caves and caps. The silence when he stood motionless so as not to hear himself was unconditional and complete, a padded silence, unknown, never heard, found nowhere else. There was not a breath of wind to stir the trees in the slightest, not a rustling, not a bird's call. It was the primal silence that Hans Castorp overheard as he stood there, leaning on his cane, his head on his shoulder, his mouth open; and silently and incessantly it continued to snow in it, quietly sinking down without a sound.","He rejoiced in his new resource, before which all difficulties and hindrances to movement fell away. It gave him the utter solitude he craved, and filled his soul with impressions of the wild inhumanity, the precariousness of this region into which he had ventured. On his one hand he might have a precipitous, pine-clad declivity, falling away into the mists; on the other sheer rock might rise, with masses of snow, in monstrous, Cyclopean forms, all domed and vaulted, swelling or cavernous. He would halt for a moment, to quench the sound of his own movement, when the silence about him would be absolute, complete, a wadded soundlessness, as it were, elsewhere all unknown. There was no stir of air, not so much as might even lightly sway the treeboughs; there was not a rustle, nor the voice of a bird. It was primeval silence to which Hans Castorp hearkened, when he leaned thus on his staff, his head on one side, his mouth open. And always it snowed, snowed without pause, endlessly, gently, soundlessly falling.","He reveled in the skill he had acquired, which opened up inaccessible worlds and almost obliterated barriers. It permitted him the solitude he sought, the profoundest solitude imaginable, touching his heart with a precarious savagery beyond human understanding. On one side might be a wooded ravine plunging into snowy mists, and on the other a rocky precipice with monstrous, cyclopean masses of snow that formed vaulted caves and humpbacked domes. When he would stop—not moving a muscle, so that he could not hear even himself—the silence was absolute, perfect, a padded soundlessness, like none ever known or perceived anywhere else in the world. There was not a breath of wind to brush softly against the trees, not a rustle, not the call of a bird. It was primal silence to which Hans Castorp listened as he stood there, leaning on one pole, his head tilted to the side, his mouth open; and silently, unrelentingly the snow went on falling, drifted down in a gentle hush."
"Herr Settembrini sprach sehr drollig und plastisch von dem Vater in der Ecke. Alle mußten lachen, auch Ferge, obgleich er gekränkt war durch Geringschätzung seines infernalischen Abenteuers. Der Humanist seinerseits benutzte die erregte Laune, um die Nichtachtbarkeit der Halluzinanten und überhaupt aller pazzi des weiteren zu erörtern und zu vertreten: diese Leute, meinte er, ließen sich ganz unerlaubt viel durchgehen und hätten es öfters sehr wohl in der Hand, ihrer Tollheit zu steuern, wie er selbst bei gelegentlichen Besuchen in Narrenspitälern gesehen. Denn wenn der Arzt oder ein Frem{682}der auf der Schwelle erscheine, so stelle der Halluzinierende meist seine Grimassen, sein Reden und Fuchteln ein und benehme sich anständig, solange er sich beobachtet wisse, um sich hernach wieder gehen zu lassen. Denn ein Sichgehenlassen bedeute die Narrheit zweifellos in vielen Fällen, dergestalt, daß sie als Zuflucht vor großem Kummer und als Schutzmaßnahme einer schwachen Natur gegen überschwere Schicksalsschläge diene, die klaren Sinnes zu bestehen ein solcher Mensch sich nicht zumute. Da aber könnte sozusagen jeder kommen, und er, Settembrini, habe schon manchen Narren einzig und allein durch seinen Blick, dadurch, daß er seinen Flausen eine Haltung unerbittlicher Vernunft entgegengesetzt habe, wenigstens vorübergehend zur Klarheit angehalten …","Mr. Settembrini spoke very funny and vividly about the father in the corner. Everyone had to laugh, including Ferge, although he was offended by the contempt for his infernal adventure. The humanist, for his part, used the excited mood to further discuss and defend the irreverence of hallucinants and all pazzi in general: these people, he said, let themselves get away with a lot and often had it very well in their hands to admit their madness control, as he himself has seen on occasional visits to madhouses. Because when the doctor or a stranger appears on the threshold, the hallucinating person usually stops grimacing, talking, and waving his hands and behaves decently as long as he knows he is being observed, in order to then let himself go again. For letting oneself go means foolishness in many cases, in such a way that it serves as a refuge from great grief and as a protective measure for a weak nature against extremely difficult blows of fate, which such a person does not dare to face with a clear mind. But anyone could come, so to speak, and he, Settembrini, has already brought many a fool to clarity, at least temporarily, simply by his look, by countering his nonsense with an attitude of inexorable reason...","Herr Settembrini spoke with droll and plastic effect. His picture of the father in the corner made them all laugh, even Ferge, put out though he was by the slight to his pleura-shock. Herr Settembrini took advantage of their hilarity to expatiate further on the contemptibleness of people who were subject to hallucinations, and of pazzi in general. It was his opinion that these people gave way a great deal more than they need, and often had it in their power to control their own freakishness. He had made this observation when he had visited asylums for the insane. For in the presence of the doctor, or of a stranger, the patients would mostly intermit their jabbering, grimaces, and weaving to and fro, and behave quite sensibly, as long as they felt themselves under scrutiny, only to let themselves go again afterwards. For lunacy undoubtedly in many cases meant the kind of self-abandonment which was the refuge of a weak nature against extreme distress, a defence against such overwhelming blows of destiny as it felt itself, when in its right mind, unable to cope with. But almost anybody might get in that state; and he, Settembrini, had held more than one lunatic to temporary self-control, simply by opposing to his humbuggery an air of inexorable reason.","Herr Settembrini spoke very graphically, very drolly, about the father in the corner. They all had to laugh, even Ferge, although he was still offended by the disparagement of his infernal adventure. The humanist then took advantage of this animated mood to explain further about how one ought to pay no attention to those who suffered from hallucinations, to pazzi in general, advancing the proposition that such people let themselves get carried away, quite illegitimately, and often had it within their power to control their madness, as he had himself observed on several visits to madhouses. Because whenever a doctor or a stranger appeared on the threshold, the hallucinating patient would usually cease grimacing, talking, and gesticulating and behave himself, as long as he knew he was being watched, letting himself go again only afterward. Letting oneself go, in fact, was doubtless a definition of madness in many cases, inasmuch as it was a way of fleeing from great affliction and served weak natures as a defense against the overpowering blows of fate, which such people felt they could not withstand in their right mind. But then anyone could use that excuse, so to speak; and he, Settembrini, had brought many a madman back to reality, at least temporarily, by confronting his fiddle-faddle with a pose of unrelenting reason."
"Unterdessen leitete Naphta die Ehrfurcht, die das christliche Mittelalter dem Elend des Leibes gewidmet hatte, aus der religiösen Zustimmung ab, die es dem Anblick fleischlichen Jammers gezollt hatte. Denn die Schwären des Körpers machten nicht nur dessen Gesunkenheit augenfällig, sondern entsprachen auch der venenosen Verderbtheit der Seele auf eine erbauliche und geistliche Genugtuung erweckende Weise, – während Leibesblüte eine irreführende und das Gewissen beleidigende Erscheinung war, welche durch tiefe Erniedrigung vor der Bresthaftigkeit zu verleugnen man äußerst guttat. Quis me liberabit de corpore mortis hujus? Wer wird mich befreien aus dem Körper dieses Todes? Das war die Stimme des Geistes, welche auf ewig die Stimme wahrer Menschheit war.","Meanwhile, Naphta derived the reverence which the Christian Middle Ages had devoted to the misery of the body from the religious approval they had accorded to the sight of carnal woes. For the ulcers of the body not only made its sunkenness conspicuous, but also corresponded to the venous depravity of the soul in a way that aroused edification and spiritual satisfaction - while the blooming of the body was a misleading and conscience-offending phenomenon, which was to be denied by deep humiliation in the face of stubbornness one extremely good deed. Quis me liberabit de corpore mortis hujus? Who will deliver me from the body of this death? That was the voice of the spirit, which was the voice of true humanity forever.","Naphta, continuing, derived the reverence which the Christian Middle Ages paid to physical suffering from the fact that it acquiesced on religious grounds in the sight of the anguish of the flesh. For the wounds of the body not only emphasized its sunken state, they also corresponded in the most edifying manner to the envenomed corruption of the soul, and thereby gave rise to emotions of true spiritual satisfaction: whereas blooming health was a misleading phenomenon, insulting to the conscience of man and requiring to be counteracted by an attitude of debasement and humility before physical infirmity, which was infinitely beneficial to the soul. Quis me liberabit de corpore mortis huius? Who will deliver me from the body of this death? There spoke the voice of the spirit, which was eternally the voice of true humanity.","Naphta now proceeded to prove that the awe in which the Christian Middle Ages had held the suffering human body was derived from religious affirmation in the face of the afflictions of the flesh. For festering sores were not only conspicuous reminders of the body’s sunken state, but also, in reflecting the venomous corruption of the soul, they awakened a desire for edifying spiritual compensation; whereas the bloom of health was a deceptive phenomenon, an offense to the conscience that it was best to disavow by bowing low in profound humility before human frailty. Quis me liberabit de corpore mortis huius? Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? That was the voice of the Spirit, and it would be the voice of true humanity for all eternity."
"»Blutpfropf? Na, es ist ja schon lange her. Und Ihr Herr Vater?«","“Blood clot? Well, it's been a long time. And your father?'","“A blood-clot, eh? Well, that’s a long time ago. And your father?”","“A blood clot? Well, it was long ago in any case. And your good father?”"
"»Wir sind im Begriffe, Herr Hofrat. Ich habe ja morgen Untersuchung, und da wollten wir fragen, ob Sie die Güte hätten, auch meinen Vetter gleich einmal dranzunehmen. Es handelt sich darum, ob er Dienstag wird reisen können …«","“We are about to, Herr Hofrat. I have an examination tomorrow, and we wanted to ask if you would be so kind as to take my cousin right away. The question is whether he will be able to travel on Tuesday…”","Both cousins laughed, and Joachim answered, heels together: “We were just going to, Herr Hofrat. I have my examination to-morrow, and we wanted to ask if you would be so kind as to look my cousin over as well. The question is whether he will be well enough to travel on Tuesday.”","They both laughed, and clicking his heels, Joachim responded, “We were just about to do that, Director Behrens. I have my checkup tomorrow, and we wanted to ask if you would be so kind as to fit my cousin in at the same time. We’re concerned whether he will be well enough to travel on Tuesday.” “N. s. s. t. d.!”"
"»Auf den Bergen wohnt die Freiheit!« sang Hans Castorp leichtsinnig. »Sage mir erst mal, was Freiheit ist«, fuhr er sprechend fort. »Naphta und Settembrini stritten vorhin ja auch darüber und kamen zu keiner Einigung. ›Freiheit ist das Gesetz der Menschenliebe!‹ sagt Settembrini, und das klingt nach seinem Vorfahren, dem Carbonaro. Aber so tapfer der Carbonaro war, und so tapfer unser Settembrini selber ist, …«","»Freedom lives on the mountains!« sang Hans Castorp carelessly. ""First tell me what freedom is,"" he went on speaking. 'Naphta and Settembrini were arguing about it earlier and didn't come to an agreement. ›Freedom is the law of philanthropy!‹ says Settembrini, and that sounds like his ancestor, the Carbonaro. But as brave as Carbonaro was, and as brave as our Settembrini himself is...""","“ ‘Of old sat Freedom on the heights,’ ” quoted Hans Castorp airily. “Tell me first what freedom is,” he went on. “Naphta and Settembrini disputed over it a good deal without coming to any conclusion. Settembrini says it is the law of love of one’s kind; that sounds like his ancestor, the Carbonaro. But however valiant he was, and however valiant our Settembrini himself is—”","“ ‘Freedom dwells within the mountains!’ ” Hans Castorp intoned giddily. “First tell me what freedom is,” he went on in normal tones. “Naphta and Settembrini were arguing about just that and couldn’t agree. ‘Freedom is the law of brotherly love,’ Settembrini says, and that sounds like it comes from his ancestor, the Carbonaro. But however brave that Carbonaro was, and our Settembrini himself may be—”"
"Dies also war, nach Joachims annähernd genauer Kalkulation, der Hergang des Gespräches gewesen, und so sagte er nichts und stellte eben nur schweigend fest, daß Hans Castorp sich seinen die Abreise vorbereitenden Schritten nicht anschloß. Wieviel hatte aber auch der gute Joachim mit sich selber zu tun! Er konnte sich wirklich um Schicksal und Verbleib des Vetters nicht weiter kümmern. Ein Sturm wogte in seiner Brust, – man kann es sich denken. Nur gut, vielleicht, daß er sich nicht mehr maß, sondern sein Instrument, angeblich, indem er es hatte fallen lassen, zerbrochen hatte: Messungen hätten beirrende Ergebnisse zeitigen mögen, – so furchtbar aufgeregt, bald dunkel glühend, bald bleich vor Freude und Spannung, wie Joachim war. Er konnte nicht mehr liegen; den ganzen Tag ging er in seinem Zimmer auf und ab, wie Hans Castorp hörte: zu all den Stunden, viermal am Tage, in welchen auf »Berghof« die Horizontale herrschte. Anderthalb Jahre! Und nun hinunter ins Flachland, nach Hause, nun wirklich zum Regiment, wenn auch nur mit halber Erlaubnis! Das war {637}keine Kleinigkeit, in keinem Sinne, Hans Castorp fühlte es dem ruhelos wandernden Vetter nach. Achtzehn Monate, den vollen Jahreszirkel und dann die Hälfte noch einmal durchlaufen hier oben, tief eingelebt, eingefahren in dieses Ordnungsgeleis, diesen unverbrüchlichen Lebensgang, den er in siebenmal siebenzig Tagen zu allen Gezeiten erprobt, – und nun nach Haus in die Fremde, zu den Unwissenden! Welche Akklimatisationsschwierigkeiten mochten da drohen? Und durfte man sich wundern, wenn Joachims große Aufregung nicht nur aus Freude bestand, sondern auch Bangigkeit, Weh des Abschieds vom durch und durch Gewohnten ihn durch sein Zimmer trieb? – Von Marusja hier ganz zu schweigen.","According to Joachim's more or less exact calculation, this was the course of the conversation, and so he said nothing and merely stated silently that Hans Castorp did not follow his steps in preparing for his departure. But how much did good Joachim have to do with himself! He really couldn't bother about the fate and whereabouts of his cousin. A storm surged in his breast - one can imagine it. It was a good thing, perhaps, that he no longer measured himself, but had broken his instrument, allegedly by dropping it: measurements could have produced misleading results - so terribly excited, sometimes glowing darkly, sometimes pale with joy and excitement , as was Joachim. He could lie no more; All day long he paced up and down his room, as Hans Castorp heard: during all those hours, four times a day, when the horizontal ruled at Berghof. A year and a half! And now down to the lowlands, home, really to the regiment, if only with half permission! That was no small thing, in any sense, Hans Castorp felt for his restlessly wandering cousin. Eighteen months, going through the full cycle of the year and then half again up here, deeply settled, drawn into this orderly track, this unbreakable course of life, which he tests in seven times seventy days at all tides - and now home abroad, to the ignorant! What difficulties in acclimatization might there be? And should one be surprised if Joachim's great excitement consisted not only of joy, but also anxiety, the pain of saying goodbye to what was thoroughly familiar, drove him through his room? – Not to mention Marusja here.","All of this corresponded pretty accurately to Joachim’s guess. He said nothing, only noting in silence that Hans Castorp made no move to join in his preparations for departure. But the good Joachim was busy enough, in all conscience, with his own affairs. He had no more time to concern himself with his cousin’s fate or further sojourn. Within his own bosom the tempest raged. It was as well he no longer took his temperature—he had , so he said, let his instrument fall, and broken it—for the thermometer might have given contrary counsel: so fearfully wrought up was he, now darkly glowing, now pale with joyful agitation. He could no longer lie still in the cure; Hans Castorp heard how he went up and down all day in his room, throughout those hours, four times each day, when all over House Berghof the horizontal obtained. A year and a half it had been. And now at last, at last, he was off for the flat-land, for home and his regiment! Even though with only half a discharge. It was no trifling event—Hans Castorp’s heart went out to his cousin as he heard his restless pacing. Eighteen months, the wheel full circle and halfway round again, he had lived up here, deep, deep into the life of the place, the inviolable ebb and flow of it, for seven times seventy days; and now he would go down to live among strangers and the uninitiate. What difficulties would he not have, to acclimatize himself? Would it be surprising if Joachim’s agitation consisted only in part of joyful emotion, and also in part of dread—if it was not also the pang of parting with all this familiar life that made him stride thus up and down his room? We leave Marusja out of account.","Joachim guessed that this was the course their conversation had taken, and his guess was fairly accurate; and so he said nothing and simply observed in silence that, unlike himself, Hans Castorp was not making any preparations for departure. And dear old Joachim had enough to do just looking after himself. He really could not worry about his cousin’s whereabouts or fate. As is easy to imagine, a storm was raging in his breast. It was a good thing, perhaps, that he no longer kept track of his temperature, having— so he claimed—dropped his thermometer and broken it. Such measurements might well have brought forth disconcerting results—particularly given Joachim’s dreadfully excited state, in which he would by turns flush darkly with joy and grow pale with anticipation. He could no longer lie still; Hans Castorp heard him pacing his room four times a day, during those hours when the rest of the Berghof assumed the horizontal position. A year and a half! And now it was back down to the flatlands, back home, where he would actually join his regiment—even if only with semipermission. It was no small matter, definitely not. Listening to that restless pacing, Hans Castorp could certainly sympathize with his cousin. Joachim had lived up here for eighteen months—a year come full circle, and half again—had profoundly settled in, become accustomed to the routine, to the undeviating path of life here, had walked it seventy times seven times, in all seasons. And now he was to return home, to an alien land, to ignorant people. What difficulties in acclimatization awaited one there? Was it any wonder, then, that Joachim’s excitement consisted not just of joy but also of fear, that the anguish of saying farewell to everything familiar kept him pacing his room?—And that is without even mentioning Marusya."
"Die Herren speisten zusammen im Berghof-Restaurant, nachdem Hans Castorp den Gast in Joachims Zimmer eingeführt und ihm Gelegenheit gegeben hatte, sich etwas zu erfrischen. Mit H2CO sei das Zimmer geräuchert worden, sagte Hans Castorp, – ebenso gründlich, wie wenn nicht wilde Abreise von dort gehalten worden wäre, sondern eine ganz andere, kein exodus, sondern ein exitus. Und da der Onkel sich nach dem Sinn erkundigte: »Jargon!« sagte der Neffe. »Ausdrucksweise!« sagte er. »Joachim ist desertiert, – zur Fahne desertiert, das gibt es auch. Aber mach’, damit du noch warmes Essen bekommst!« Und so saßen sie denn im behaglich erwärmten Restaurant einander gegenüber, an erhöhtem Platz. Die Zwer{649}gin bediente sie hurtig, und James ließ eine Flasche Burgunder kommen, die, in einem Körbchen liegend, aufgestellt wurde. Sie stießen an und ließen sich von der milden Glut durchrinnen. Der Jüngere sprach von dem Leben hier oben im Wandel der Jahreszeiten, von einzelnen Erscheinungen des Speisesaals, vom Pneumothorax, dessen Wesen er erklärte, indem er den Fall des gutmütigen Ferge heranzog und sich über die grasse Natur des Pleura-Choks verbreitete, auch der drei farbigen Ohnmachten gedachte, in die Herr Ferge gefallen sein wollte, der Geruchshalluzination, die beim Chok eine Rolle gespielt und des Gelächters, das er im Abschnappen ausgestoßen. Er bestritt die Kosten der Unterhaltung. James aß und trank stark, wie er es gewohnt war und mit überdies noch durch Reise und Luftwechsel geschärftem Appetit. Dennoch unterbrach er sich zuweilen in der Nahrungsaufnahme, – saß, den Mund voller Speisen, die er zu kauen vergaß, Messer und Gabel im stumpfen Winkel über dem Teller stillgestellt, und betrachtete Hans Castorp unverwandt, scheinbar ohne es zu wissen, auch ohne daß jener sich weiter empfindlich dafür gezeigt hätte. Geschwollene Adern zeichneten sich an Konsul Tienappels mit dünnem blonden Haar bedeckten Schläfen ab.","The gentlemen dined together in the Berghof restaurant after Hans Castorp had introduced the guest to Joachim's room and given him the opportunity to refresh himself. The room had been smoked with H2CO, said Hans Castorp - just as thoroughly as if there had not been a wild departure from there, but a completely different one, not an exodus but an exitus. And when the uncle asked what it meant: ""Jargon!"" said the nephew. he said. »Joachim deserted – deserted to join the flag, that also exists. But do it, so that you can still get warm food!« And so they sat opposite each other in the comfortably warmed restaurant, in a higher place. The dwarf served them swiftly, and James sent for a bottle of Burgundy, which was placed in a basket. They clinked glasses and let the mild glow wash through them. The younger spoke of life up here through the changing of the seasons, of individual phenomena in the dining room, of pneumothorax, the nature of which he explained, using the case of the good-natured Ferge and elaborating on the grass nature of the pleural choke, the three too thought of the colored swoons Mr. Ferge claimed to have fallen into, the olfactory hallucination that played a part in the choke, and the laughter he let out in the snap. He defrayed the cost of the entertainment. James ate and drank heavily, as was his wont, and with an appetite whetted by travel and fresh air. Nevertheless, he occasionally interrupted himself while eating - sat with his mouth full of food that he forgot to chew, the knife and fork placed at an obtuse angle over the plate, and stared intently at Hans Castorp, apparently without knowing it, even without the latter would have continued to be sensitive to it. Swollen veins stood out on Consul Tienappel's temples, which were covered with thin blond hair.","The gentlemen supped together in the restaurant, after Hans Castorp had conducted his relative to his room and given him a chance to get a wash-up. It had been fumigated with H2CO, he explained, quite as thoroughly as though the late tenant had not gone off without leave, but in quite a different way—an exit instead of an exodus. The uncle inquired what he meant. “Jargon,” said Hans Castorp. “A way we have in the service. Joachim deserted—deserted to the colours—funny, but it can be done. But make haste, or we shall get nothing hot to eat.” In the warm, well-lighted restaurant they sat down facing each other at the raised table in the window. The dwarf waitress served them nimbly, and James ordered a bottle of burgundy, which was presented lying in a basket. They touched glasses, and the grateful glow ran through their veins. The younger talked of life up here, of the events the changing seasons brought in their course, of various personalities among the patients, of the pneumothorax, the functioning of which he explained at length, describing the ghastly nature of the pleura-shock, and citing the case of the good-natured Herr Ferge, with the threecoloured fainting-fits, the hallucinatory stench, and the diabolic laughing-fit when they felt over the pleura. He paid for the meal. James ate and drank heartily, as was his custom—with an appetite still further sharpened by his journey and the change of air. But he intermitted the process several times, sat with his mouth full of food and forgot to chew, holding his knife and fork at an obtuse angle above his plate and regarding Hans Castorp with a fixed stare. He seemed unaware that he did this, nor did the other give sign of remarking it. Consul Tienappel’s temples, covered with thin blond hair, showed swollen veins.","The gentlemen dined together in the Berghof’s restaurant, after Hans Castorp had shown his guest to Joachim’s room and given him a chance to tidy himself up a bit. The room had been fumigated with H2CO, Hans Castorp said—just as thoroughly as if it had not been a case of a fraudulent departure, but a departure of a very different sort, not an exodus, but an exitus. And when his uncle asked him what he meant, the nephew replied, “Jargon. Our way of putting things. Joachim deserted—deserted to the colors. That’s possible, too. But hurry now, otherwise you won’t get a hot meal.” And so now there they sat across from one another at the raised table in the cozy warmth of the restaurant. The dwarf promptly arrived to serve them, and James ordered a bottle of burgundy, which was placed on the table cradled in a basket. They toasted glasses and let the gentle glow course through them. The younger man spoke about life up here and the change of seasons, about certain people they would see in the dining hall, about pneumothorax, explained about the operation, mentioning good-natured Ferge’s case in particular and expounding on the ghastly nature of pleural shock—the green, brown, and purple faints Herr Ferge claimed to have experienced, the hallucinated odor that was part of the shock, the burst of laughter as he blacked out. He paid for their meal. As was his custom, James ate and drank heartily, his appetite having been whetted even more by the trip and the change of air. But from time to time he broke off taking nourishment; and he would sit there, his mouth full of food he had forgotten to chew, his knife and fork dangling idly at a low angle over his plate, and fix his eyes on Hans Castorp, apparently without even being aware of it—not that his nephew seemed to mind. The veins at Consul Tienappel’s temples, just below his thinning blond hair, were swollen."
"Wir wissen nicht, ob man es ihm zugute halten soll, daß die Umstände seinem Mangel an gutem Willen – wenn man nicht geradezu von seinem bösen Willen reden will – so sehr zustatten kamen. Als Frau Chauchat wiedergekehrt war (anders, als Hans Castorp es sich hatte träumen lassen – aber davon an seinem Orte), hatte wieder einmal Adventszeit geherrscht und der kürzeste Tag, Wintersanfang also, astronomisch gesprochen, in naher Aussicht gestanden. In Wirklichkeit aber, von theoretischer Anordnung abgesehen, in Hinsicht auf Schnee und Frost, hatte man damals Gott weiß wie lange schon wieder Winter gehabt, ja, dieser war allezeit nur ganz vorübergehend unterbrochen gewesen, von brennenden Sommertagen mit einer Himmelsbläue von so übertriebener Tiefe, daß sie ins Schwärzliche spielte, – von Sommertagen also, wie sie übrigens auch in den Winter fielen, wenn man den Schnee beiseite ließ, der übrigens auch in jedem Sommermonat fiel. Wie oft hatte Hans Castorp mit dem seligen Joachim über diese große Konfusion geschwatzt, welche die Jahreszeiten vermengte, sie durcheinander warf, das Jahr seiner Gliederung beraubte und es dadurch auf eine langweilige Weise kurzweilig oder auf eine {821}kurzweilige Weise langweilig machte, so daß von Zeit, einer frühen und mit Ekel getanen Äußerung Joachims zufolge, überhaupt nicht die Rede sein konnte. Was eigentlich vermengt und vermischt wurde bei dieser großen Konfusion, das waren die Gefühlsbegriffe oder die Bewußtseinslagen des »Noch« und des »Schon wieder«, – eins der verwirrendsten, vertracktesten und verhextesten Erlebnisse überhaupt, und ein Erlebnis dabei, das zu kosten Hans Castorp gleich an seinem ersten Tage hier oben eine unmoralische Neigung verspürt hatte: nämlich bei den fünf übergewaltigen Mahlzeiten im lustig schablonierten Speisesaal, wo denn ein erster Schwindel dieser Art, vergleichsweise unschuldig noch, ihn angewandelt hatte.","We do not know whether to give him credit for the fact that his lack of good will - if one does not want to speak outright of his bad will - is so favored by circumstances. When Mrs. Chauchat returned (different from what Hans Castorp had dreamed of - but about it at his place), it was Advent again and the shortest day, the beginning of winter, astronomically speaking, was imminent. In reality, however, apart from the theoretical arrangement, with regard to snow and frost, God knows how long it had been winter again at that time, yes, this had always been interrupted only very temporarily, by burning summer days with a blue sky of such exaggerated depth that that it played into the blackness - that is, of summer days, just as they also fell in winter, if one left aside the snow, which incidentally also fell in every summer month. How often had Hans Castorp chatted with the late Joachim about this great confusion which mixed up the seasons, threw them together, robbed the year of its structure and thereby made it boringly entertaining or boringly boring, so that according to an early statement made with disgust by Joachim, there could be no question of time at all. What was actually mixed up and mixed up in this great confusion were the emotional concepts or the states of mind of ""Noch"" and ""Again"" - one of the most confusing, complicated and bewitched experiences ever, and an experience to taste it Hans Castorp had felt an immoral tendency on his very first day up here: namely during the five overwhelming meals in the merrily stenciled dining room, where a first swindle of this kind, comparatively innocent, had attacked him.","We do not know whether we may count it in his favour that circumstances advantaged his lack of inclination, or perhaps we ought to say his disinclination. When Frau Chauchat came back—under circumstances very different from those Hans Castorp had imagined, but of that in its place—when she came back, it was the Advent season again, and the shortest day of the year; the beginning of winter, astronomically speaking, was at hand. Apart from arbitrary time-divisions, and with reference to the quantity of snow and cold, it had been winter for God knows how long, interrupted, as always all too briefly, by burning hot summer days, with a sky of an exaggerated depth of blueness, well-nigh shading into black; real summer days, such as one often had even in the winter, aside from the snow—and the snow one might also have in the summer! This confusion in the seasons, how often had Hans Castorp discussed it with the departed Joachim! It robbed the year of its articulation, made it tediously brief, or briefly tedious, as one chose to put it; and confirmed another of Joachim’s disgusted utterances, to the effect that there was no time up here to speak of, either long or short. The great confusion played havoc, moreover, with emotional conceptions, or states of consciousness like “still” and “again”; and this was one of the very most gruesome, bewildering, uncanny features of the case. Hans Castorp, on his first day up here, had discovered in himself a hankering to dabble in that uncanny, during the five mighty meals in the gaily stenciled dining-room; when a first faint giddiness, as yet quite blameless, had made itself felt.","We do not know if he should be exonerated because circumstances favored his lack of good intentions—that is, if one chooses not to speak of his bad intentions. Frau Chauchat’s return (and her return had been very different from anything Hans Castorp had dreamed—but of that at the appropriate time) had coincided with a return of the season of Advent and the year’s shortest days; the beginning of winter, astronomically speaking, had been imminent. In reality, however—that is, apart from any theoretical system—in terms of snow and cold, it had been winter now for God knew how long; winter had been interrupted, as always, only very briefly by scorching summer days with a sky whose blue was so inordinately deep that it verged on black—by summer days, then, that could occur in the midst of winter, too, if you ignored the snow, which, by the by, could also fall at any time during summer. How often Hans Castorp had chatted with the late Joachim about the grand confusion that mixed up the seasons higgledy-piggledy, robbing the year of its divisions and making it diverting in a boring sort of way, or boring in a diverting sort of way, until, as the late Joachim had put it out of pure disgust early on, there was no time as such. What got mixed up so higgledy-piggledy in this grand confusion were those emotional concepts and states of consciousness that define “still” and “again”—which is one of the most bewildering, perplexing, and bewitching experiences there is. And from his very first day up here Hans Castorp had felt an immoral appetite to taste that experience—in particular at the five prodigious meals in the cheerfully stenciled dining hall, where he had had his first slight, and relatively innocent, dizzy spell of this sort."
"Was aber der Welt Naphtas und derjenigen Joachims namentlich gemeinsam war, das war ihr Verhältnis zum Blute und ihr Axiom, daß man seine Hand nicht solle davon zurückhalten: darin besonders stimmten sie als Welten, Orden und Stände hart überein, und für ein Kind des Friedens war es sehr hörenswert, wie Naphta von kriegerischen Mönchstypen des Mittelalters erzählte, welche, asketisch bis zur Erschöpfung und dabei voll geistlicher Machtbegier, des Blutes nicht hatten schonen wollen, um den Gottesstaat, die Weltherrschaft des Übernatürlichen herbeizuführen; von streitbaren Tempelherren, die den Tod im Kampf gegen die Ungläubigen für verdienstvoller als den im Bette geachtet hatten und, um Christi willen getötet zu werden oder zu töten, für kein Verbrechen, sondern für höchsten Ruhm. Nur gut, wenn Settembrini bei diesen Reden nicht zugegen war! Er gab sonst nur wieder den störenden Drehorgelmann ab und schalmeite Frieden, – obgleich da doch der heilige National- und Zivilisationskrieg gegen Wien war, zu dem er durchaus nicht nein sagte, während freilich Naphta nun gerade diese Passion und Schwäche mit Hohn und Verachtung strafte. Wenigstens solange der Italiener von solchen Gefühlen warm war, führte er eine christliche Weltbürgerlichkeit dagegen ins Feld, wollte jedes Land, und auch wieder kein einziges, Vaterland nennen und wiederholte schneidend das Wort eines Ordensgenerals namens Nickel, dahin lautend, die Vaterlandsliebe sei »eine Pest und der sicherste Tod der christlichen Liebe«.","But what the world of Naphta and that of Joachim had in common was their relationship to blood and their axiom that one should not hold back one's hand from it: in this they particularly agreed as worlds, orders and estates, and for a child of peace Was it very worth hearing how Naphta talked about warlike monk types of the Middle Ages who, ascetic to the point of exhaustion and at the same time full of spiritual lust for power, did not want to spare their blood in order to bring about the theocracy, the world domination of the supernatural; of pugnacious Templars, who counted death in battle against unbelievers more meritorious than death in bed, and to be put to death, or to put to death, for Christ's sake, no crime, but the highest glory. Just as well if Settembrini wasn't present at these speeches! Otherwise he only acted as a troublesome organ grinder and sworn peace, - although there was the holy national and civil war against Vienna, to which he did not say no at all, while Naphta, of course, punished precisely this passion and weakness with scorn and contempt. At least as long as the Italians were warm with such feelings, he led against it a Christian cosmopolitanism, wanted to call every country, and then not a single one, fatherland and scathingly repeated the words of a general of the order named Nickel, who said that love of fatherland was “a plague and the surest death of Christian love"".","But what Naphta’s and Joachim’s worlds had most of all in common was their attitude towards the shedding of blood, their axiom that one must not hold back one’s hand. Therein, as worlds, as orders, as states of society, they were in stern accord. The child of peace would listen with avidity to Naphta’s stories of the warlike monks of the Middle Ages, who, ascetic to the point of physical exhaustion, and filled with a ghostly lust of power, had been unsparing in bloodshed to the end of establishing the kingdom of God and its supernal overlordship; of the warlike Templars, who had held it of far greater worth to die in battle with the infidel than in their beds, and no crime but the highest glory, to kill or be killed for Christ’s sake. Luckily, Settembrini had not been present at that conversation. He continued to fill the rôle of organ-grinder, and sang the praises of peace to harp and psaltery, but there was always the holy war against Vienna, to which he never said nay, though Naphta visited his foible with scorn and contempt, and when the Italian was glowing with passionate feeling, would lead the bourgeoisie of all Christendom into the field against him, swearing that every country, or else no country at all, was his fatherland, and repeating with cutting effect the phrase of a general of the Society, named Nickel, according to which our love of country was “a plague, and the certain death of Christian love.”","But Naphta’s and Joachim’s worlds had something else special in common: their relationship to blood and the axiom that one should not refrain from shedding it. On that they were in fierce agreement—as worlds, as orders, as professions; and a child of peace found it worth his while to listen to Naphta talk about the martial monks of the Middle Ages, who, although ascetics to the point of exhaustion, were likewise filled with a spiritual lust for power and did not refrain from bloodshed in order to bring about the City of God and its transcendent world dominion; or about belligerent Knights Templar, who considered death in battle against unbelievers more meritorious than death in one’s bed and for whom slaying and being slain for the sake of Christ was no crime, but the highest glory. It helped if Settembrini was not present for such lectures. Otherwise, he played the role, as always, of the bothersome organ-grinder and trumpeted peace, even though he remained hardly averse to his holy, civilizing, patriotic war against Vienna—and Naphta, of course, was sure to repay such passion and weakness with sarcasm and disdain. In any case, whenever the Italian warmed to that cause, Naphta would champion a Christian world citizenship, claim every land and no land as his fatherland, and caustically recall the phrase of Nickel, a former general of the order, who declared patriotism “a plague and the surest death of Christian charity.”"

"»Die hat Rasse«, sagte der Hofrat, indem er seine Marke hinreichte. »Temperament, wissen Sie, Saft und Kraft. St. Felix-Brasil, ich habe es immer mit diesem Charakter gehalten. Ein rechter Sorgenbrecher, brennt ein wie Schnaps, und namentlich gegen das Ende hat sie was Fulminantes. Einige Zurückhaltung im Verkehr wird empfohlen, man kann nicht eine an der anderen anzünden, das geht über Manneskraft. Aber lieber mal einen ordentlichen Happen, als den ganzen Tag Wasserdampf …«","""She has race,"" said the Hofrat, handing over his badge. 'Temperament, you know, vigor and energy. St. Felix-Brasil, I've always stuck with this character. A real worry breaker, burns like schnapps, and especially towards the end it has something brilliant. Some restraint in dealings is recommended, one cannot light one at the other, that is beyond manpower. But I'd rather have a good bite than steam all day...""","“There’s a thorough-bred for you,” the Hofrat said, as he displayed his brand. “Temperament, you know, juicy, got some guts to it. St. Felix, Brazil—I’ve always stuck to this sort. Regular ‘begone, dull care,’ burns like brandy, has something fulminating toward the end. But you need to exercise a little caution—can’t light one from the other, you know—more than a fellow can stand. However, better one good mouthful than any amount of nibbles.”","“She has good breeding,” the director said, holding out his brand. “Vivacious, you know, vim and vigor. Saint Felix-Brazil, I’ve always stuck to that sort. Soothes one’s cares away, catches fire like brandy, but, all the same, she packs something of a wallop toward the end. A little caution is in order—you can’t light one from the other. Would take more of a man than I. But I’d rather have a hearty snack than a whole day of tasteless air.”"
"Das ist ja ein rechter Windbeutel, dachte Hans Castorp, und dabei blieb er auch, als Settembrini nach seiner galanten Anwandlung wieder zu medisieren begann. Hauptsächlich hatte er es auf Hofrat Behrens abgesehen, stichelte auf den Umfang seiner Füße und hielt sich bei seinem Titel auf, den er von einem an Gehirntuberkulose leidenden Prinzen erhalten habe. Von dem skandalösen Lebenswandel dieses Prinzen spreche noch heute die ganze Gegend, aber Radamanth habe ein Auge zugedrückt, beide Augen, jeder Zoll ein Hofrat. Ob die Herren übrigens wüßten, daß er der Erfinder der Sommersaison sei? Ja, er, und kein anderer. Dem Verdienste seine Krone. Früher hätten im Sommer nur die Treuesten der Treuen in diesem Tale ausgeharrt. Da habe »unser Humorist« mit unbestechlichem Scharfblick erkannt, daß dieser Mißstand nichts als die Frucht eines Vorurteils sei. Er habe die Lehre aufgestellt, daß, wenigstens soweit sein Institut in Frage komme, die sommerliche Kur nicht nur nicht weniger empfehlenswert, sondern sogar besonders wirksam und geradezu unentbehrlich sei. Und er habe dieses Theorem unter die Leute zu bringen gewußt, habe populäre Artikel darüber verfaßt und sie in die Presse lanciert. Seitdem gehe das Geschäft im Sommer so flott wie im Winter. »Genie!« sagte Settembrini. »In-tu-i-tion!« sagte er. Und dann {98}hechelte er die übrigen Heilanstalten des Platzes durch und lobte auf beißende Art den Erwerbssinn ihrer Inhaber. Da sei Professor Kafka … Alljährlich, zur kritischen Zeit der Schneeschmelze, wenn viele Patienten abzureisen verlangten, finde Professor Kafka sich gezwungen, rasch noch auf acht Tage zu verreisen, wobei er verspreche, nach seiner Rückkehr die Entlassungen vorzunehmen. Dann aber bleibe er sechs Wochen aus, und die Ärmsten warteten, wobei sich, am Rande bemerkt, ihre Rechnungen vergrößerten. Bis nach Fiume lasse man Kafka kommen, er aber reise nicht, bevor man fünftausend gute Schweizer Franken sichergestellt, worüber vierzehn Tage vergingen. Einen Tag nach der Ankunft des Celebrissimo sterbe alsdann der Kranke. Was Doktor Salzmann betreffe, so sage er dem Professor Kafka nach, daß er seine Spritzen nicht rein genug halte und den Kranken Mischinfektionen beibringe. Er fahre auf Gummi, sage Salzmann, damit seine Toten ihn nicht hörten, – wogegen wiederum Kafka behaupte, bei Salzmann werde den Patienten »des Rebstocks erheiternde Gabe« in solchen Mengen aufgenötigt – nämlich ebenfalls behufs Abrundung ihrer Rechnungen –, daß die Leute wie die Fliegen stürben, und zwar nicht an Phthise, sondern an Trinkerleber …","That's a real windbag, thought Hans Castorp, and he stuck to it when Settembrini began to meditate again after his gallant tirade. Mainly he had his eye on Hofrat Behrens, teasing the girth of his feet and dwelling on his title, which he had received from a prince suffering from cerebral tuberculosis. The whole area is still talking about the scandalous way of life of this prince, but Radamanth turned a blind eye, both eyes, every inch a privy councillor. By the way, did the gentlemen know that he was the inventor of the summer season? Yes, he, and no other. The crown of merit. In the past, only the most loyal of the loyal would have stayed in this valley during the summer. Then ""our humorist"" recognized with incorruptible perspicacity that this abuse was nothing but the fruit of a prejudice. He had established the theory that, at least as far as his institute was concerned, the summer cure was not only no less recommendable, but actually particularly effective and downright indispensable. And he knew how to get this theorem among the people, wrote popular articles about it and launched them in the press. Since then, business has been going as well in summer as it does in winter. ""Genius!"" said Settembrini. ""In-tu-i-tion!"" he said. And then {98} he panted through the other sanatoriums in the square and scathingly praised the earning sense of their owners. There is Professor Kafka ... Every year, at the critical time of the snowmelt, when many patients demand to leave, Professor Kafka finds himself forced to leave quickly for eight more days, promising to carry out the discharges when he returns. But then he stays away for six weeks, and the poorest people wait, which, by the way, increases their bills. Kafka was allowed to come as far as Fiume, but he did not travel until five thousand good Swiss francs were secured, which took fourteen days. A day after the arrival of the Celebrissimo the sick man died. As for Doctor Salzmann, he said after Professor Kafka that he didn't keep his syringes clean enough and that he taught the patients mixed infections. He rides on rubber, Salzmann says, so that his dead don't hear him - whereas Kafka, on the other hand, maintains that at Salzmann's patients ""the vine's exhilarating gift"" is forced upon the patients in such quantities - namely also for the purpose of rounding off their calculations - that people like them Flies were dying, and not of phthisis, but of drinking liver...","“What a windbag it is,” Hans Castorp thought. He remained of that opinion still, after the Italian had recovered from his attack of gallantry and begun to scoff again. His animadversions were chiefly directed upon Herr Hofrat Behrens: he jeered at the size of his feet, and at the title he had received from a certain prince who suffered from tuberculosis of the brain. Of the scandalous courses of that royal personage the whole neighbourhood still talked; but Rhadamanthus had shut his eye—both eyes, in fact—and behaved every inch a Hofrat. Did the gentlemen know that he—the Hofrat—had invented the summer season? He it was, and no other. One must give the devil his due. There had been a time when only the faithfullest of the faithful had spent the summer in the high valley. Then our humourist, with his unerring eye, had perceived that this neglect was simply the result of unfortunate prejudice. He got up the idea that, so far at least as his own sanatorium was concerned, the summer cure was not only not less to be recommended than the winter one, it was, on the contrary, of great value, really quite indispensable. And he knew how to get this theory put about, to have it come to people’s ears; he wrote articles on the subject and launched them in the press—since when the summer season had been as flourishing as the winter one. “Genius!” said Settembrini. “In-tu-ition!” He went on to criticize the proprietors of all the other sanatoria in the place, praising their acquisitive talents with mordant sarcasm. There was Professor Kafka. Every year, at the critical moment, when the snow began to melt, and several patients were asking leave to depart, he would suddenly find himself obliged to be away for a week, and promise to take up all requests on his return. Then he would stop away for six weeks, while the poor wretches waited for him, and while, incidentally, their bills continued to mount. Kafka was once sent for to go to Fiume for a consultation, but he would not go until he was guaranteed five thousand good Swiss francs; and thus two weeks were lost in pourparlers. Then he went; but the day after the arrival of the great man, the patient died. Dr. Salzmann asserted that Kafka did not keep his hypodermic syringes clean, and his patients got infected one from the other. He also said he wore rubber soles, that his dead might not hear him. On the other hand, Kafka told it about that Dr. Salzmann’s patients were encouraged to drink so much of the fruit of the vine—for the benefit of Dr. Salzmann’s pocket-book—that they died off like flies, not of phthisis but cirrhosis of the liver.","“What a windbag,” Hans Castorp thought, and did not change his mind when Settembrini moved on from this fit of flirtation and returned to casting aspersions. His primary object was Director Behrens—he sneered at the size of the man’s feet and lingered over his title of Hofrat, which had been bestowed on him by a prince suffering from tuberculosis of the brain. The prince’s scandalous behavior was still the talk of the valley, but Rhadamanthus had simply winked an eye, both eyes—every inch a Hofrat. Did the gentlemen know, by the way, that Behrens had been the inventor of the summer season? Yes, he and he alone. Honor to whom honor is due. In days past, only the most faithful of the faithful had held out over the summer in this valley. But then “our humorist” with his incorruptibly keen eye had realized that this unhappy state of affairs was nothing less than the fruit of prejudice. He had set forth the theory that, at least as far as his institution was concerned, the summer cure was to be recommended no less than the winter, that it was especially efficacious, indeed absolutely indispensable. And he had known how to spread his theory among the public—among other methods, by writing popular articles that he had then passed on to the press. And since then business in summer was as lively as that in winter. “A genius!” Settembrini said. “What in-tu-i-tion!” he said. And then he scoffed at the other sanatoriums in town and sarcastically praised the business acumen of their owners. There was Professor Kafka—every year, at the critical moment of thaw, when a great many patients demanded to leave, Professor Kafka would suddenly be called away for a week or so, promising to take care of discharges on his return. But then he would stay away for six weeks while the poor things waited—and, let it be noted, their bills increased. Kafka had once been summoned to consult on a case in Fiume, but he refused to depart before he had been assured of a fee of five thousand Swiss francs, and that had taken a good two weeks. The day after the celebrissimo’s arrival, the patient had died. And as for Dr. Salzmann, he claimed that Professor Kafka did not keep his syringes sterile and infected his patients with other diseases. He glided on rubber soles, so Salzmann said, to keep the dying from hearing his approach. Whereas Kafka claimed that Salzmann demanded his patients drink “the vine’s gladdening gift” in such quantities—likewise with a view to rounding off their bills—that people were dying like flies, and not of phthisis, but of cirrhosis."

"»Es ist überhaupt keine Zeit«, sagte Hans Castorp mit schwerer Zunge. Aber er ging doch mit, etwas gebückt und steifbei{30}nig, wie ein Mensch, der von Müdigkeit förmlich zu Boden gezogen wird, – nahm sich jedoch gewaltsam zusammen, als er in der nur noch matt erleuchteten Halle Joachim sagen hörte:","""There's no time at all,"" said Hans Castorp with a heavy tongue. But he went along anyway, stooping a bit and stiff-legged, like a person who is literally being pulled to the ground by tiredness—however, he pulled himself together when he heard Joachim say in the dimly lit hall:","quoth Hans Castorp, thick-tongued. He went with his cousin, rather bent and stiff in the knees, like a man bowed to the earth with fatigue.","“It’s not time for anything,” Hans Castorp said with a thick tongue. But he joined his cousin all the same, walking on stiff legs and bent so low that he looked like a man being dragged toward the floor by weariness."
"Ja, ja, sagte Hans Castorp, wohl wahr, sein Vetter und er, sie seien wohl mehr oder weniger bedrohte Naturen. Es sei die Geschichte mit den Sorgenkindern des Lebens, er verstehe. Aber demgegenüber könne man ja Petrarca anführen mit seinem Wahlspruch, Herr Settembrini wisse schon, und hörenswert sei es doch unter allen Umständen, was Naphta so vorbringe: man müsse gerecht sein, das mit der kommunistischen Zeit, für deren Ablauf niemand eine Prämie bekommen dürfe, sei vorzüglich gewesen, und dann habe es ihn auch sehr interessiert, einiges über Pädagogik zu hören, was er ohne Naphta wohl nie zu hören bekommen hätte …","Yes, yes, said Hans Castorp, it's true, he and his cousin are more or less endangered. It was the story with the problem children of life, he understood. But on the other hand one could quote Petrarch with his motto that Mr. Settembrini already knows and it is worth listening to what Naphta put forward: one must be fair with the communist period, for the end of which no one should receive a bonus, was excellent, and then he was also very interested in hearing some things about pedagogy, which he probably would never have heard without Naphta ...","Hans Castorp rejoined that it was probably all true; he and his cousin were naturally more or less prone to such dangers—it was the same old story about the delicate child of life, he understood perfectly. But on the other hand, one might cite Petrarch and his maxim, which was familiar to Herr Settembrini. And after all it was worth listening to, all that Naphta had to say. One must admit that that about the communistic period, when no one would be allowed to receive interest, was first-rate; also some of the things he said about education which he, Hans Castorp, would probably never otherwise have got to hear.","Yes, yes, Hans Castorp said, that was probably true, his cousin and he, they were more or less prone to such spiritual dangers. It was the old story of life’s problem children—he understood. But on the other hand, one could just as easily quote that old motto of Petrarch’s, Herr Settembrini knew the one he meant. But in any case, the ideas Naphta advanced were well worth listening to: one had to be just. That part about communistic time, and how no one should be paid a bonus simply because it passed—that had been excellent. And then it had been very interesting to hear certain ideas on pedagogy, about which he probably would never have known a thing without Naphta."
"So sprachen sie miteinander, und wie im Traum hörte Hans Castorp zu. Daß Joachim mit Frau Chauchat sprach, war beinahe dasselbe, wie wenn er selbst mit ihr gesprochen hätte, – wenn freilich auch wieder etwas ganz und gar anderes. Das »Eher« hatte Hans Castorp beleidigt, es kam ihm frech und mindestens befremdend gleichmütig vor in Anbetracht der Umstände. Aber Joachim konnte am Ende so sprechen, – er konnte überhaupt mit ihr sprechen und tat sich vielleicht vor ihm noch etwas zugute darauf mit seinem kecken »Eher«, – ungefähr wie er selbst vor Joachim und Settembrini sich aufgespielt hatte, als man ihn gefragt, wie lange er zu bleiben gedenke und er »drei Wochen« geantwortet hatte. An Joachim, obgleich er die Zeitung vor das Gesicht gehalten, hatte sie sich gewandt mit ihrer Anrede, – gewiß weil er der älter Eingesessene, ihr länger von Ansehen Bekannte war; aber doch auch aus {324}jenem anderen Grunde, weil ein Verkehr auf gesittetem Fuße, ein artikulierter Austausch in ihrem Falle am Platze war und nichts Wildes, Tiefes, Schreckliches und Geheimnisvolles zwischen ihnen waltete. Hätte jemand Braunäugiges mit Rubinring und Orangenparfüm hier mit ihnen gewartet, so wäre es an ihm, Hans Castorp, gewesen, das Wort zu führen und »Eher« zu sagen, – unabhängig und rein, wie er ihr gegenüberstand. »Gewiß, eher unangenehm, wertes Fräulein!« hätte er gesagt und vielleicht sein Taschentuch mit einem Schwung aus der Brusttasche gezogen, um sich zu schneuzen. »Bitte, Geduld zu üben. Wir sind in keiner besseren Lage.« Und Joachim hätte gestaunt über seine Leichtlebigkeit, – wahrscheinlich aber, ohne sich ernstlich an seine Stelle zu wünschen. Nein, auch Hans Castorp war nicht eifersüchtig auf Joachim, wie die Dinge lagen, obgleich dieser es war, der mit Frau Chauchat sprechen durfte. Er war einverstanden damit, daß sie sich an ihn gewandt hatte; sie hatte den Umständen Rechnung getragen, indem sie es tat, und so zu erkennen gegeben, daß sie sich dieser Umstände bewußt war … Sein Herz hämmerte.","So they talked to each other, and Hans Castorp listened as if in a dream. The fact that Joachim spoke to Frau Chauchat was almost the same as if he had spoken to her himself—although it was something entirely different. The ""rather"" had offended Hans Castorp, it struck him as impudent and at least strangely indifferent in view of the circumstances. But in the end Joachim was able to speak like that - he could talk to her at all and perhaps even prided himself on it with his bold ""Rather"" - roughly as he had acted out in front of Joachim and Settembrini when they asked him how long he intended to stay and he had replied ""three weeks."" She had addressed her address to Joachim, although he was holding the newspaper in front of his face—certainly because he was the older resident and had known her for a long time; but also for that other reason, because civilized intercourse, an articulated exchange, was in place in their case, and nothing wild, deep, terrible, and mysterious held sway between them. If someone with brown eyes and a ruby ring and orange perfume had been waiting here with them, it would have been up to him, Hans Castorp, to speak and say ""rather"" - independent and pure, as he faced her. ""Certainly, rather unpleasantly, Fraulein!"" he would have said, and perhaps pulled his handkerchief out of his breast pocket with a flourish to blow his nose. 'Please be patient. We're in no better position.' And Joachim would have been amazed at his easygoingness – but probably without seriously wanting to be in his place. No, Hans Castorp wasn't jealous of Joachim either, the way things were, although it was Joachim who was allowed to speak to Frau Chauchat. He agreed that she had approached him; she had taken the circumstances into account by doing so, thus showing that she was aware of the circumstances... His heart was pounding.","Thus they conversed, and Hans Castorp listened as in a dream. For his cousin to speak to Frau Chauchat was almost the same as his doing it himself—and yet how altogether different! That “Rather” had affronted him, it sounded odd and brusque, if not worse, in view of the circumstances. To think that Joachim could speak to her like that—to think that he could speak to her at all!—and very likely he prided himself on his pert “Rather”—much as Hans Castorp had played up before Joachim and Settembrini when he was asked how long he meant to stay, and answered: “Three weeks.” It was to Joachim, though he had the paper in front of his nose, that she had turned with her question; because he was the older inhabitant of course, whom she had known longer by sight; but perhaps for another reason as well, because they two might meet on a conventional footing and carry on an ordinary conversation in articulate words; because nothing wild and deep, mysterious and terrifying, held sway between them. Had it been somebody brown-eyed, with a ruby ring and orange perfume, who sat here waiting with them, it would have been his, Hans Castorp’s, part to lead the conversation and say: “Rather” in the purity and detachment of his sentiments. “Yes, madame, certainly rather unpleasant,” he would have said; and might have taken his handkerchief out of his breast pocket with a flourish, and blown his nose. “Have patience, our case is no better than yours.” How surprised Joachim would have been at his fluency—but without seriously wishing himself in Hans Castorp’s place. No, and Hans Castorp was not jealous of Joachim for being able to talk to Frau Chauchat. He was satisfied that she should have addressed herself to his cousin; it showed that she recognized the situation for what it was.—His heart pounded.","The two of them conversed, and Hans Castorp listened as if in a dream. For Joachim to speak with Frau Chauchat was almost the same as if he himself were speaking with her—though, of course, totally different, too. Hans Castorp had been offended by Joachim’s “Rather!”—it had sounded so impertinent, or at least oddly indifferent under the circumstances. But the main thing was that Joachim spoke, that he was able to speak to her at all and perhaps was even showing off a little for his cousin with his impertinent “Rather!”—just as Hans Castorp had himself showed off for Joachim and Settembrini when he had been asked how long he intended to stay and had said, “Three weeks.” She had turned to address Joachim, despite the magazine he was holding up in front of his face—because he was a long-term resident, of course, and so she had known him longer, at least by sight. Although there was that other reason, too: a polite social conversation, an articulated exchange was quite appropriate for them, because no savage, profound, terrible secret existed between them. Had someone brown-eyed, with a ruby ring and orange-blossom perfume, been waiting here with them, it would have been up to him, Hans Castorp, to speak up and say, “Rather!”—to stand across from her so sovereign and correct. Although he would have said, “Certainly, mademoiselle, rather unpleasant,” and perhaps have pulled his handkerchief from his breast pocket with a little flourish and blown his nose. “Please, be patient. We’re in the same situation ourselves.” And Joachim would have been amazed at his easygoing manner—presumably, however, without seriously wanting to have changed places with him. No, given the situation, Hans Castorp was not jealous of Joachim, either, even though it was he who had spoken with Frau Chauchat. It did not bother him that she had turned to Joachim; she had taken the circumstances into account in doing so, thereby making it clear that she was aware of those circumstances. His heart was pounding."
"Rechts seitwärts in einiger Entfernung nebelte Wald. Er wandte sich dorthin, um ein irdisches Ziel vor Augen zu haben, statt weißlicher Transzendenz, und fuhr plötzlich ab, ohne daß er im geringsten eine Geländesenkung hatte kommen sehen. Die Blendung verhinderte jedes Erkennen der Bodengestaltung. Man sah nichts; alles verschwamm vor den Augen. Ganz unerwartet hoben Hindernisse ihn auf. Er überließ sich dem Gefälle, ohne mit dem Auge den Grad seiner Neigung zu unterscheiden.","To the right, some distance away, forest was foggy. He turned there to have an earthly goal in mind instead of whitish transcendence, and suddenly he drove off without seeing the slightest drop in terrain coming. The glare prevented any recognition of the floor design. One saw nothing; everything blurred before the eyes. Unexpectedly, obstacles picked him up. He surrendered to the incline without visual discernment of the degree of his incline.","A wood loomed, misty, far off to the right. He turned that way, to the end of having some goal before his eyes, instead of sheer white transcendence; and made toward it with a dash, not remarking an intervening depression of the ground. He could not have seen it, in fact; everything swam before his eyes in the white mist, obliterating all contours. When he perceived it, he gave himself to the decline, unable to measure its steepness with his eye.","A foggy wood emerged a little way ahead on his right. He turned toward it to have some earthly goal before his eyes, instead of white transcendence—and suddenly he was racing downward, though he had seen no dip in the terrain. The blinding light prevented his making out any sort of contour; he could see nothing really, everything blurred before his eyes. Obstacles could rise up unexpectedly right in front of him. Unable to make out the angle of decline, he let the slope pull him downward."
"»Meinst du? Ja, das ist noch gar nicht mal sicher. Ich habe immer den Eindruck, daß es ihm nicht ganz allein um die Lehren zu tun ist, vielleicht um sie erst in zweiter Linie, sondern besonders um das Sprechen, wie er die Worte springen und rollen läßt … so elastisch, wie Gummibälle … und daß es ihm gar nicht unangenehm ist, wenn man namentlich auch darauf achtet. Bierbrauer Magnus ist ja wohl etwas dumm mit seinen ›schönen Charakteren‹, aber Settembrini hätte doch sagen sollen, worauf es denn eigentlich ankommt in der Literatur. Ich mochte nicht fragen, um mir keine Blöße zu geben, ich verstehe mich ja auch nicht weiter darauf und hatte bis jetzt noch nie einen Literaten gesehen. Aber wenn es nicht auf die schönen Charaktere ankommt, so kommt es offenbar auf die schönen Worte an, das ist mein Eindruck in Settembrinis Gesellschaft. {156}Was er für Vokabeln gebraucht! Ganz ohne sich zu genieren spricht er von ›Tugend‹ – ich bitte dich! Mein ganzes Leben lang habe ich das Wort noch nicht in den Mund genommen, und selbst in der Schule haben wir immer bloß ›Tapferkeit‹ gesagt, wenn ›virtus‹ im Buche stand. Es zog sich etwas zusammen in mir, das muß ich sagen. Und dann macht es mich etwas nervös, wenn er so schimpft, auf die Kälte und auf Behrens und auf Frau Magnus, weil sie Eiweiß verliert, und kurz, auf alles. Er ist ein Oppositionsmann, darüber war ich mir gleich im klaren. Er hackt auf alles Bestehende, und das hat immer etwas Verwahrlostes, ich kann mir nicht helfen.«","""Do you think? Yeah, that's not even certain. I always have the impression that he is not solely concerned with the teachings, perhaps with them only secondarily, but especially with the speaking, how he lets the words bounce and roll ... as elastic as rubber balls ... and that it is not at all uncomfortable for him, if you also pay attention to it by name. Beer brewer Magnus is probably a bit stupid with his 'beautiful characters', but Settembrini should have said what is actually important in literature. I didn't want to ask, so as not to expose myself, I don't know much about it either, and up until now I had never seen a man of letters. But if it's not the beautiful characters that count, it's obviously the beautiful words that count, that's my impression in Settembrini's company. {156}What vocabulary he uses! Without any embarrassment he speaks of 'virtue' - please! I've never said the word in my life, and even at school we always just said 'bravery' when 'virtus' was in the book. Something tightened inside me, I have to say. And then it makes me a little nervous when he scolds like that, at the cold and at Behrens and at Frau Magnus because she is losing protein, and in short, at everything. He's an opposition man, I knew that straight away. He hacks into everything that already exists, and there's always something unkempt about it, I can't help it.""","“Think so? I’m not so sure. I get the impression that it is not simply and solely for the sake of edifying us that he talks; perhaps that’s only a secondary motive. The important one, I feel sure, is the talk itself, the way he makes his words roll out, so resilient, just like a lot of rubber balls! He is very pleased when you notice the effect. I suppose Magnus, the brewer, was rather stupid, after all, with his ‘beautiful characters’; but I do think Settembrini might have said what the point really is in literature. I did not like to ask, for fear of putting my foot in it; I am not just clear about it, and this is the first time I have ever known a literary man. But if it isn’t the beautiful characters, then obviously it must be the beautiful words, and that is the impression I get from being in Settembrini’s society. What a vocabulary! and he uses the word virtue just like that, without the slightest embarrassment. What do you make of that? I’ve never taken the word in my mouth as long as I’ve lived; in school, when the book said ‘ virtus,’ we always just said ‘valour’ or something like that. It certainly gave me a queer feeling in my inside, to hear him. And it makes me nervous to hear him scolding, about the cold, and Behrens, and Frau Magnus because she is losing weight, and about pretty well everything. He is a born objector, I saw that at once, down on the existing order; and that always gives me the impression that the person is spoilt—I can’t help it.”","“Do you think so? Well, I’m not so certain about that. I always have the impression that what is really important to him is not the lecture itself—perhaps that’s only secondary—but more especially the speaking of it, the way he lets his words roll and bounce, like little rubber balls. And that he isn’t at all displeased, in fact, if you pay attention to that, too. Magnus the brewer is certainly a little silly with his ‘beautiful characters,’ but Settembrini should have said what literature is actually about. I didn’t want to ask for fear of leaving myself wide open. I don’t really understand much more about it myself, and I’ve never met a literary man before. But if it’s not a matter of beautiful characters, then evidently it’s a matter of beautiful words, that’s my impression when I’m around Settembrini. And what a vocabulary! He’s not the least embarrassed to use words like ‘virtue’—I mean, really! That word has never passed my lips once in all my life—even in Latin class we always just translated virtus as ‘bravery.’ It made me wince deep inside, let me tell you. And besides, it makes me a little nervous the way he squawks about the cold and Behrens and Frau Magnus, who’s losing protein—about almost everything in fact. He’s a professional naysayer, that much was clear to me right off. He hacks away at everything around him, and I can’t help it —that always makes things rather untidy and disorderly.”"

"Hier lagen ausschließlich Repräsentationsräume, eingerechnet das helle, mit Stuck verzierte Eßzimmer, dessen drei weinrot verhangene Fenster auf das rückwärtige Gärtchen blickten, und wo während der achtzehn Monate Großvater und Enkel alltäglich um 4 Uhr allein miteinander zu Mittag aßen, bedient von dem alten Fiete mit den Ohrringen und den silbernen Knöpfen am Frack, der zu diesem Frack eine ebensolche battistene Halsbinde trug, wie der Hausherr selbst, auch auf ganz ähnliche Art das rasierte Kinn darin barg, und den der Großvater duzte, indem er plattdeutsch mit ihm sprach; nicht scherzender Weise – er war ohne humoristischen Zug –, sondern in aller Sachlichkeit und weil er es überhaupt mit Leuten aus dem Volk, mit Speicherarbeitern, Postboten, Kutschern und Dienstboten so hielt. Hans Castorp hörte es gern, und sehr gern hörte er auch, wie Fiete antwortete, ebenfalls platt, indem er sich beim Servieren von links hinter seinem Herrn herumbeugte, um ihm in das rechte Ohr zu sprechen, auf dem der Senator bedeutend besser hörte als auf dem linken. Der Alte verstand und nickte und aß weiter, sehr aufrecht zwischen der hohen Mahagonilehne des Stuhles und dem Tisch, kaum über den Teller gebeugt, und der Enkel, ihm gegenüber, betrachtete still, mit tiefer und unbewußter Aufmerksamkeit, die knappen, {36}gepflegten Bewegungen, mit denen die schönen, weißen, mageren alten Hände des Großvaters mit den gewölbten, spitz zulaufenden Nägeln und dem grünen Wappenring auf dem rechten Zeigefinger einen Bissen aus Fleisch, Gemüse und Kartoffeln auf der Gabelspitze anordneten und unter einem leichten Entgegenneigen des Kopfes zum Munde führten. Hans Castorp sah auf seine eigenen, noch ungeschickten Hände und fühlte darin die Möglichkeit vorgebildet, späterhin ebenso wie der Großvater Messer und Gabel zu halten und zu bewegen.","Here were only representative rooms, including the bright dining room decorated with stucco, whose three wine-red curtained windows looked out onto the back garden, and where for eighteen months grandfather and grandson ate lunch together every day at 4 a.m., served by old Fiete the earrings and the silver buttons on the tailcoat, which wore the same battistene necktie as the master of the house himself, and also hid his shaved chin in it in a very similar way, and which the grandfather used to speak to him in Low German; not in a joking way - he was not humorous - but in all objectivity and because that was how he treated people from the common people, with warehouse workers, postmen, coachmen and servants. Hans Castorp liked to hear it, and he was also very happy to hear how Fiete answered, also flatly, as he was serving, leaning around from the left behind his master to speak into his right ear, in which the senator heard much better than before the left. The old man understood and nodded and went on eating, very upright between the high mahogany back of the chair and the table, barely bending over the plate, and the grandson opposite him silently, with deep and unconscious attention, watched the slender, well-groomed ones Movements with which the grandfather's beautiful, white, thin old hands, with the curved, pointed nails and the green coat of arms ring on the right index finger, arranged a bite of meat, vegetables and potatoes on the tip of the fork and with a slight tilt of the head to the mouth led. Hans Castorp looked at his own hands, which were still clumsy, and felt in them the possibility of later holding and moving knives and forks like his grandfather.","In the parterre were chiefly reception-rooms, and a very light and cheerful diningroom, with walls decorated in stucco. Its three windows, draped with wine-coloured curtains, looked out on the back garden. In this room, daily, at four o’clock, for the space of eighteen months, grandfather and grandson dined together, served by old Fiete, who had ear-rings in his ears and silver buttons on his livery, also a batiste neckcloth like his master’s, in which he buried his shaven chin just as Hans Lorenz Castorp did in his. Grandfather said thou to him and addressed him in dialect—not with any humorous intent, for he had no bent that way, but in all seriousness, and because it was his custom so to do in his dealings with the common people—the warehouse hands, postmen, coachmen, and servants. Hans Castorp liked to hear it, and very much he liked to hear Fiete reply, in dialect too, bending over as he served and speaking into his master’s left ear, for the Senator could hear much better on that side. The old man would listen and nod and go on eating, sitting erect between the table and the high back of his mahogany chair, and scarcely at all bending over his plate. And his grandson, opposite, watched in silence, with deep, unconscious concentration, Grandfather’s beautiful, thin, white old hands, with their pointed nails, and, on the right forefinger, the green seal ring with the crest; watched the small, deft, practised motions with which they arranged a mouthful of meat, vegetable, and potato on the end of his fork, and with a slight inclination of the head conveyed it to his mouth. Then he would look at his own hands, and their still clumsy movements, and see in them the hope foreshadowed of one day holding and using his knife and fork as Grandfather did.","The first floor was taken up exclusively by formal rooms, including the bright dining room—with its ornamental plaster and three windows hung with burgundy curtains and looking out on the little back garden—where during those eighteen months the grandfather and grandson dined together daily at four in the afternoon, served by old Fiete, who had rings in both ears, silver buttons on his swallowtail coat, and a batiste necktie exactly like the one worn by his master, in which, also in imitation of his master, he buried his clean-shaven chin, and whom the grandfather always addressed familiarly in Plattdeutsch, not for any comical effect (for he was a man without humor) but quite matter-of-factly, just as he did whenever he dealt with the commonfolk—warehouse workers, messengers, coachmen, or servants. Hans Castorp enjoyed listening to the dialect, and also enjoyed Fiete’s answers, likewise in Plattdeutsch, delivered while serving from the left and bending around behind his master to speak into his right ear, out of which the senator heard considerably better than the left. The old man understood and nodded and went on eating, sitting very erect between the high mahogany back of his chair and the table, barely bending forward to his plate; and his grandson, seated opposite, would watch with silent, profound, and unconscious attention as his grandfather’s hands—beautiful, white, gaunt, aged hands, with rounded, sharply tapered fingernails and a green signet ring on the right forefinger—arranged a bite of meat, vegetable, and potato on the tip of the fork with a few practiced motions and guided it to the mouth with just the least forward tip of the head. Hans Castorp looked down at his own still awkward hands and sensed stored within them the possibility that one day he would hold and use his knife and fork as adeptly as his grandfather."
"Ein freier Eckplatz winkte glücklicherweise in der Nähe der Tür. Er stahl sich seitlich darauf und nahm eine Miene an, als hätte er hier schon immer gesessen. Das Publikum, mit erster Aufmerksamkeit an Dr. Krokowskis Lippen hängend, beachtete ihn kaum; und das war gut, denn er sah schrecklich aus. Sein Gesicht war bleich wie Leinen und sein Anzug mit Blut befleckt, so daß er einem von frischer Tat kommenden Mörder glich. Die Dame vor ihm freilich wandte den Kopf, als er sich setzte, und musterte ihn mit schmalen Augen. Es war Madame Chauchat, er erkannte sie mit einer Art von Erbitterung. Aber das war doch des Teufels! Sollte er denn nicht zur Ruhe kom{191}men? Er hatte gedacht, hier still am Ziele sitzen und sich ein wenig erholen zu können, und da mußte er sie nun gerade vor der Nase haben, – ein Zufall, über den er sich unter anderen Umständen ja möglicherweise gefreut hätte, aber müde und abgehetzt, wie er war, was sollte es ihm da? Es stellte nur neue Anforderungen an sein Herz und würde ihn während des ganzen Vortrags in Atem halten. Genau mit Pribislavs Augen hatte sie ihn angesehen, in sein Gesicht und auf die Blutflecke seines Anzugs geblickt, – ziemlich rücksichtslos und zudringlich übrigens, wie es zu den Manieren einer Frau paßte, die mit den Türen warf. Wie schlecht sie sich hielt! Nicht wie die Frauen in Hans Castorps heimischer Sphäre, die aufrechten Rückens den Kopf ihrem Tischherrn zuwandten, indes sie mit den Spitzen der Lippen sprachen. Frau Chauchat saß zusammengesunken und schlaff, ihr Rücken war rund, sie ließ die Schultern nach vorne hängen, und außerdem hielt sie auch noch den Kopf vorgeschoben, so daß der Wirbelknochen im Nackenausschnitt ihrer weißen Bluse hervortrat. Auch Pribislav hatte den Kopf so ähnlich gehalten; er jedoch war ein Musterschüler gewesen, der in Ehren gelebt hatte (obgleich nicht dies der Grund gewesen war, weshalb Hans Castorp sich den Bleistift von ihm geliehen hatte), – während es klar und deutlich war, daß Frau Chauchats nachlässige Haltung, ihr Türenwerfen, die Rücksichtslosigkeit ihres Blickes mit ihrem Kranksein zusammenhingen, ja, es drückten sich darin die Ungebundenheit, jene nicht ehrenvollen, aber geradezu grenzenlosen Vorteile aus, deren der junge Herr Albin sich gerühmt hatte …","Luckily, a free corner seat beckoned near the door. He stole sideways onto it and assumed an expression as if he had always sat here. The audience, with first attention to Dr. Krokowski's lips drooped, barely paying attention to him; and that was good, because he looked awful. His face was as pale as linen and his suit stained with blood so that he resembled a red-handed murderer. The lady in front of him, however, turned her head as he sat down and examined him with narrowed eyes. It was Madame Chauchat, he recognized her with a kind of bitterness. But that was the devil! Shouldn't he be able to {191}rest? He had thought that he could sit here quietly at his destination and recover a little, and now he must have her right in front of his nose - a coincidence which under other circumstances he might have been happy about, but tired and harried, as he was, what should he do there? It only made new demands on his heart and would keep him on edge throughout the lecture. She had looked at him with Pribislav's eyes, looking at his face and the bloodstains on his suit - quite ruthlessly and importunately, by the way, as befitted the manners of a woman who threw doors. How badly she was holding up! Not like the women in Hans Castorp's home sphere, who, with their backs erect, turned their heads to their table host while speaking with the tips of their lips. Mrs. Chauchat sat slumped and limp, her back was round, her shoulders slumped forward, and she also held her head forward so that the vertebral column protruded in the neckline of her white blouse. Pribislav too had held his head in a similar way; he, however, had been a model pupil, living with honor (although that was not the reason why Hans Castorp had borrowed the pencil from him), - while it was plain and plain that Mrs. Chauchat's careless attitude, her door-throwing, the ruthlessness of her gaze was connected with her illness, yes, it expressed the independence, those not honorable but almost limitless advantages of which young Herr Albin had boasted ...","LUCKILY there was a vacant seat in the corner, near the door. He slipped into it and assumed an air of having been here from the beginning. The audience, hanging rapt on Dr. Krokowski’s lips, paid him no heed—which was as well, for he looked rather ghastly. His face white as a sheet, his coat spotted with blood—he might have been a murderer stealing from his crime. The lady in front of him did, indeed, turn her head as he sat down, and measured him with narrow eyes. With a sense of exasperation he recognized Madame Chauchat. Deuce take it—was he never to have a moment’s peace? He had thought that, having arrived at his goal, he could sit here quietly and rest a little; and now he had to have her under his nose. In other circumstances he might conceivably have found her nearness rather pleasant than otherwise. But now, worn out and harassed as he felt, what was it to him? It could only make new demands on his heart and keep him from drawing a long breath during the whole lecture. With Pribislav’s very eyes she had looked at him, and at the spots of blood on his coat; her look had been rather bold and ruthless too, as a woman’s would be who let doors bang behind her. How badly she held herself! Not like the ladies of Hans Castorp’s social sphere, who sat erect at their tables, turned their heads towards their lords and masters, and spoke with mincing correctness. Frau Chauchat sat all relaxed, with drooping shoulders and round back; she even thrust her head forward until the vertebra at the base of the neck showed prominently above the rounded décollétage of her white blouse. Pribislav had held his head like that. But he had been a model pupil and full of honours (which was not the reason why Hans Castorp had borrowed his pencil), whereas it was abundantly clear that Frau Chauchat’s bad carriage, her doorslamming, and the directness of her gaze all had to do with her physical condition; yes, were even expressive of that want of restraint in which young Herr Albin rejoiced, which was not honourable at all, yet possessed boundless advantages all its own.","Luckily there was a corner seat available near the door. He sidled down into it and put on a face as if he had been there all along. The audience was listening attentively to Dr. Krokowski’s every word and paid Hans Castorp barely any notice. And that was a good thing, because he looked dreadful. His face was as pale as linen and his suit was bloodstained, so that he looked like a murderer fresh from his awful deed. The lady in front of him did turn her head as he sat down, studying him with her narrow eyes. It was Madame Chauchat, he realized with something like indignation. What a hell of a thing to have happen! Wasn’t he ever going to be able to calm down? He had thought that, having arrived at his goal, he could sit there quietly and recover a little, and now he had to have her right in front of his nose— a coincidence that might possibly have pleased him under other circumstances, but what good did it do him in his weary, frazzled state? It only made new demands of his heart, and he would be preoccupied and tense all through the lecture. She had looked at him with eyes exactly like Pribislav’s, staring into his face and at the bloodstains—a rather impolite, brazen stare, by the way, that matched the manners of a woman who slammed doors. What awful posture she had! Not like the women in Hans Castorp’s social circle at home, who sat straight-backed at the table and turned only their heads to speak with pursed lips to gentlemen on either side. Frau Chauchat sat in a limp slouch, her back rounded, her shoulders drooping forward, and at the same time she thrust her head out so that her neck bones were visible above the collar line of her white blouse. Pribislav had held his head like that, too; but he had been a model student and led a life full of honors (although that had not been the reason why Hans Castorp had borrowed a pencil from him)—whereas it was all too clear that Frau Chauchat’s careless posture, her door-slamming, and her brazen stares were bound up with her illness, that in fact they were all expressions of that same license young Herr Albin had praised, the advantages of which, if not honorable, were at least almost endless."
"Das dauerte ein Jahr, bis es auf jenen abenteuerlichen Höhepunkt gelangte, dann dauerte es noch ein Jahr, dank der bewahrenden Treue Hans Castorps, und dann hörte es auf – und zwar ohne daß er mehr von der Lockerung und Auflösung der Bande merkte, die ihn an Pribislav Hippe knüpften, als er von ihrer Entstehung gemerkt hatte. Auch verließ Pribislav, infolge der Versetzung seines Vaters, Schule und Stadt; aber das beachtete Hans Castorp kaum noch; er hatte ihn schon vorher {187}vergessen. Man kann sagen, daß die Gestalt des »Kirgisen« unmerklich aus Nebeln in sein Leben getreten war, langsam immer mehr Deutlichkeit und Greifbarkeit gewonnen hatte, bis zu jenem Augenblick der größten Nähe und Körperlichkeit, auf dem Hofe, eine Weile so im Vordergrunde gestanden hatte und dann allmählich wieder zurückgetreten und ohne Abschiedsweh in den Nebeln entschwunden war.","It lasted a year before it reached that adventurous climax, then it lasted another year, thanks to Hans Castorp's continued loyalty, and then it stopped - and he did so without him noticing any more of the loosening and dissolving of the ties that bound him linked to Pribislav Hippe when he noticed that they were being created. Pribislav also left school and town as a result of his father's transfer; but Hans Castorp hardly noticed that anymore; he had {187}forgotten him before. One can say that the figure of the ""Kirghiz"" entered his life imperceptibly out of the mists, slowly gaining more and more clarity and tangibility, up to that moment of greatest closeness and physicality, on the farm, which had been in the foreground for a while and then gradually stepped back and disappeared into the mists without a pang of farewell.","The affair had lasted a year, up to that intrepid and culminating moment; after which, thanks to Hans Castorp’s constancy of spirit, it lasted another. Then it was over. And it is a fact that he marked no more the loosening and dissolving of the bond which united him to Pribislav than he had previously marked its beginnings. Moreover, in consequence of his father’s taking another position, Pribislav left the school and the city; but that was all one to Hans Castorp; he had already forgotten him before he went. One may put it that the figure of the “Kirghiz” had glided out of the mist into Hans Castorp’s life, and slowly grown vivid and tangible there, up to that moment of the greatest nearness and corporeity, in the school court; had stood awhile thus in the foreground, then slowly receded, and, with no pain of parting, dissolved again into the mist.","And so things continued for a year, until that adventurous high-point; and another year passed as well—the result of Hans Castorp’s abiding loyalty. And then it was all over—without his ever noticing the loosening and breaking of the bonds that tied him to Pribislav Hippe, any more than he had noticed their strengthening. Pribislav left the school and the city, too, when his father was transferred. But Hans Castorp barely noticed, he had already forgotten him by then. One might say that the figure of this “Kirghiz” emerged imperceptibly out of the fog and into his life, slowly taking on clarity and palpability, until the moment when he was most near, most physically present, there in the schoolyard, stood there in the foreground for a while, and then gradually receded and vanished again into the fog, without even the pain of farewell."
"Es flüstere ihr zu, sagte sie. Es werde ihr zugeflüstert, was sie zu tun habe, leise, aber ganz scharf und deutlich.","It whispers to her, she said. It is whispered to her what she has to do, quietly, but very sharply and clearly.","Something whispered to her, she said. It whispered and told her what to do, softly, but quite clearly and distinctly.","It came in whispers. It was whispered to her what she had to do, very softly, but quite clearly and distinctly."

"»Ça suffit … Parler«, fuhr Hans Castorp fort, »– pauvre affaire! Dans l’éternité, on ne parle point. Dans l’éternité, tu sais, on fait comme en dessinant un petit cochon: on penche la tête en arrière et on ferme les yeux.«","""Ça suffit ... Parler,"" continued Hans Castorp, ""- pauvre affaire! Dans l'éternité, on a parle point. Dans l'éternité, tu sais, on fait comme en dessinant un petit cochon: on penche la tête en arrière et on ferme les yeux.«","“Ça suffit.—Parler,” went on Hans Castorp, “pauvre affaire! Dans l’éternité, on ne parle point. Dans l’éternité, tu sais, on fait comme en dessinant un petit cochon: on penche la tête en arrière et on ferme les yeux.”","“That will do. Speech—” Hans Castorp continued, “what a poor business it is! In eternity, people won’t speak at all. Eternity, you see, will be like drawing that piglet: you’ll turn your head away and close your eyes.”"
"Nachdem er ihn getrunken, verfuhr er, wie folgt. Er dämmte mit der Hand die Unterhaltung zurück, schuf Stille, wie der Dirigent, der das Durcheinander der stimmenden Instrumente zum Schweigen bringt und sein Orchester, kulturell gebietend, zum Beginn der Aufführung sammelt, – denn da sein großes, vom weißen Haar umflammtes Haupt mit den blassen Augen, {832}den mächtigen Stirnfalten, dem langen Kinnbart und dem bloßliegenden wehen Munde darüber unstreitig bedeutend wirkte, so fügte alles sich seiner Gebärde. Alle verstummten, sahen ihn lächelnd an, warteten, und da und dort nickte einer ihm zur Ermunterung lächelnd zu. Er sagte mit ziemlich leiser Stimme:","After drinking it, he proceeded as follows. He held back the conversation with his hand, created silence, like the conductor who silences the jumble of tuning instruments and who, culturally commanding, gathers his orchestra at the beginning of the performance - because there his big head, surrounded by white hair, is there too the pale eyes, {832}the powerful forehead wrinkles, the long goatee and the exposed sore mouth above it indisputably made a significant impression, everything conformed to his gesture. Everyone fell silent, smiled at him, waited, and here and there someone nodded and smiled at him for encouragement. He said in a rather low voice:","After the draught he would proceed thus, choking off with one hand the conversation, making a silence round him, as a conductor hushes the confused sounds of tuning instruments and collects his orchestra to begin a number; mastering at will any situation, for could anything resist that regal head, with its aureole of white hair and its pallid eyes, the great folds of the brows, the long whisker and shaven raw upper lip? They were silent, they looked at him and smiled, they waited, anticipatorily nodding. He spoke.","and, having accomplished nothing, turn back to his coffee, which he had them brew extra-strong for him in a machine he had brought with him. And after he had taken a sip, he would continue as follows: restraining further conversation with one hand, he created silence the way a conductor hushes the cacophony of instruments being tuned and with a commanding, cultured gesture summons his orchestra to begin the concert; for his large head with its encircling flames of white hair, with its pale eyes, deeply creased brow, long beard, and exposed, pained lips looked so unquestionably imposing that everyone obeyed his gesture. They all fell silent, smiled, and looked at him expectantly; here and there someone would add a nod of encouragement to his smile. In a rather low voice, he said, “Ladies and gentlemen."
"Wie so die Jährchen wechselten, begann etwas umzugehen im Hause Berghof, ein Geist, dessen unmittelbare Abstammung von dem Dämon, dessen bösartigen Namen wir genannt haben, Hans Castorp ahnte. Mit der unverantwortlichen Neugier des Bildungsreisenden hatte er diesen Dämon studiert, ja, bedenkliche Möglichkeiten in sich vorgefunden, an dem ungeheuerlichen Dienste, den die Mitwelt ihm widmete, ausgiebig teilzunehmen. Dem Wesen zu frönen, das jetzt um sich griff, nachdem es übrigens, genau wie das alte, keimweise und da und dort sich andeutend schon immer vorhanden gewesen, war er nach seiner Gemütsart wenig geschaffen. Trotzdem bemerkte er mit Schrecken, daß auch er, sobald er sich ein wenig gehen ließ, in Miene, Wort und Gehaben einer Infektion unterlag, der niemand in der Runde sich entzog.","As the years passed, something began to happen in the Berghof house, a spirit whose direct descent from the demon whose malicious name we have given Hans Castorp suspected. He had studied this demon with the irresponsible curiosity of an educational traveller, indeed found dubious possibilities within himself to participate extensively in the outrageous service that his contemporaries devoted to him. Indulging in the being that was now spreading, after it, like the old one, had always existed as a germ and hinted at it here and there, he was little suited to his disposition. Nevertheless, he noticed with horror that as soon as he let himself go a little, his face, speech and behavior succumbed to an infection from which no one in the group escaped.","WITH the swift-changing years, a spirit began to walk in House Berghof: a spirit of immediate descent, or so Hans Castorp surmised, from that other demon whose baleful name we have spoken. With the facile curiosity of inquiring youth on its travels, he had studied this new demon, yes, had even discovered in himself an alarming aptitude, in common with the rest of the world up here, to pay him extensive homage. This new evil genius had, like the other, always been present, as it were, in the germ, but now it began to spread itself; Hans Castorp had by nature no great predilection for becoming its slave; yet with something like horror he observed that even he, when he let himself go ever so little, fell victim to a contagion so general that scarce anyone in the circle escaped it.","And as one little year succeeded another, a ghost began to walk the Berghof, one whom Hans Castorp suspected was a direct descendent of that demon we have already called by its malicious name. With the irresponsible curiosity of the tourist thirsting for knowledge, he had studied that old demon, indeed had found potentialities within himself for lively participation in the monstrous acts of homage paid to it by the world all about him. Like the old demon, this new one had always been around, sprouting up here and there to hint at its presence, but as it spread now, it became clear that by temperament Hans Castorp was less suited for worship of this creature. All the same, the moment he let himself go the least little bit, he noted to his horror that his words, gestures, and expression, too, had succumbed to an infection no one in the place could escape."
»Sie langweilen sich nicht mit Ihrem Monismus?«,"""You're not bored with your monism?""",“Doesn’t your monism rather bore you?”,“Doesn’t your monism bore you?”
"»Meine Herren,« sagte er bedrängt, »keine Übereilungen! Es ist trotz allem meine Pflicht …«","'Gentlemen,' he said urgently, 'no haste! It is my duty, after all...""","“Gentlemen,” he said, choking, “don’t be hasty. It is my duty, after all—”","“Gentlemen,” he said, disconcerted, “let’s not be hasty. Above all else, it is my duty—”"
"»Ich nehme an, daß es mit meinem Französisch etwas gehapert hat«, wich Hans Castorp aus. »Woher soll ichs am Ende auch haben. Aber im rechten Augenblick fliegt einen ja manches an, und so ging es denn mit der Verständigung doch ganz leidlich.«","""I assume that my French was a bit lacking,"" Hans Castorp evaded. “After all, where am I supposed to get it from? But at the right moment something comes up, and so communication went quite well.«","“I’m afraid my French was rather lame,” Hans Castorp answered evasively. “I haven’t had much occasion to use it. But the words somehow come into one’s mind when one needs them—so we understood each other tolerably well.”","“I suppose my French was a little weak,” Hans Castorp said evasively. “But how could it be all that good, really? Somehow a few things do come to you at just the right moment, and so we managed to communicate fairly well.”"
"Sie hatten beste Fahrt. Die Pferde, muntere Blessen alle vier, gedrungen, glatt und satt, schlugen in festem Takt die gute Straße, die noch nicht staubte. Felsentrümmer, in deren Fugen Gras und Blumen sprossen, traten zuweilen an ihren Rand, Telegraphenstangen flohen zurück, Bergwälder stiegen auf, anmutige Kurven, die man anstrebte und zurücklegte, unterhielten die Wegesneugier, und immer dämmerte teilweis noch verschneites Gebirge in sonniger Fernsicht. Das gewohnte Talgebiet war verlassen, die Verrückung der alltäglichen Szene erfrischte das Gemüt. Bald hielt man am Waldesrand: Von hier aus wollte man zu Fuß den Ausflug fortsetzen und das Ziel gewinnen, – ein Ziel, mit dem man schon des längeren, ohne es anfangs gewahr geworden zu sein, in schwachem, aber sich stetig verstärkendem sinnlichen Kontakte stand. Ein fernes Geräusch wurde allen bewußt, sobald die Fahrt eingestellt war, ein leises, zuweilen der Wahrnehmung noch wieder entkommendes Zischen, Schüttern und Brausen, das zu unterscheiden man einander aufforderte, und auf das man gefesselten Fußes horchte.","You had the best ride. The horses, all four of them cheerfully blazed, stocky, smooth and well fed, beat the good road, which was not yet dusty, in a steady rhythm. Rubble rocks, in whose gaps grass and flowers sprouted, sometimes came to their edge, telegraph poles fled back, mountain forests rose, graceful curves that one strived for and covered, entertained one's curiosity about the way, and mountains, some of which were still snow-covered, always dawned in a sunny distant view. The usual valley area was deserted, the disarray of the everyday scene refreshed the spirit. Soon they stopped at the edge of the forest: from here they wanted to continue the excursion on foot and reach their goal - a goal with which they had for a long time, without being aware of it at first, been in weak but steadily increasing sensual contact . Everyone became aware of a distant sound as soon as the journey had stopped, a soft hissing, shaking and roaring, which at times still escaped perception, which one asked one another to distinguish and which one listened to with bound feet.","It was a delightful drive. The horses, all four of them sturdy, glossy, well-fed beasts, with a blaze on each forehead, covered the excellent road at a steady pace. There was no dust. The route was bordered here and there by crumbling rock tufted with grass and flowers. Telegraph-poles flew past. Their way wound along the mountain forests in pleasant curves that invited the interest and led it on; in the sunny distance glimmered mountain heights still partly covered with snow. They left behind their own accustomed valley, and the change of scene refreshed their spirits. At the edge of the forest they drew up, having decided to cover on foot the remainder of the distance to the goal they had in mind—a goal of which they had been for some time aware, by reason of the sound that came to their ears, at first scarcely perceptible, but steadily increasing in volume. They all heard, directly they dismounted, that far-away, sibilant, vibrating roar, that distant murmuring of water, as yet so faint that they would suddenly lose the sound and pause to listen again.","The drive was perfect. The horses, all four of them, were spirited, sturdy, smooth, and well fed, each with a blaze on its forehead, and their hooves banged out a steady rhythm against the road, a good surface, still without any dust. Here and there along its shoulders were piles of rock with grass and flowers sprouting from the cracks; telegraph poles hurried past and were left behind; mountain forests rose up; gentle curves loomed ahead and were taken, each arousing new expeditionary curiosity; and always in the sunny distance was a hint of mountains, some still snowcapped. They had left their own familiar valley behind, and the absence of everyday scenes refreshed them. Soon they stopped at the edge of a wood—they would have to continue their excursion from here on foot if they were to reach their goal, a goal with which they had been in contact for some time now. Without their even having realized it, their ears had picked it up, very tenuous at the start, but steadily increasing. They all heard the distant sound now that the carriages had stopped: a soft hiss, that at times slipped below the threshold of hearing, a trembling surge, to which each called the other’s attention as they stood there rooted in place."
"{557}Er pflückte von all der Lieblichkeit, trug Sträuße heim, ernsten Sinnes und nicht sowohl zum Schmuck seines Zimmers, als zur streng wissenschaftlichen Bearbeitung, wie er es sich vorgesetzt. Einiges floristische Rüstzeug war angeschafft, ein Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Botanik, ein handlicher kleiner Spaten zum Ausheben der Pflanzen, ein Herbarium, eine kräftige Lupe; und damit wirtschaftete der junge Mann in seiner Loggia, – sommerlich gekleidet nun wieder, in einen der Anzüge, die er damals gleich mit sich heraufgebracht, – auch dies ein Merkmal der Jahresrundung.","{557}He plucked from all the loveliness, took bouquets home, serious in mind and not so much to decorate his room as for the strictly scientific treatment, as he intended. Some floristic equipment had been acquired, a textbook on general botany, a handy little spade for digging up the plants, a herbarium, a powerful magnifying glass; And with that the young man worked in his loggia – now dressed for summer again, in one of the suits that he had brought up with him at the time – this too is a characteristic of the rounding of the year.","Hans Castorp gathered a bunch of all this loveliness and took it to his room; by no means with the idea of decoration, but of set and serious scientific intent. He had assembled an apparatus to serve his need: a botanical text-book, a handy little trowel to take up roots, a herbarium, a powerful pocket-lens. The young man set to work in his loggia, clad in one of the light summer suits he had brought up with him when he came—another sign that his first year was rounding out its course.","He gathered up these delights, brought bouquets home, but for serious purposes—less to decorate his room than to follow through on his plan and study them with a strictly scientific eye. He had bought some paraphernalia for his project: a book on general botany, a handy trowel for digging up plants, a herbarium, a powerful magnifying glass; and the young man went to work on his balcony, dressed for summer again now, in one of the suits he had brought with him at the very start— this, too, another token that the year had come full circle."
"»Je le sais, madame«, antwortete Hans Castorp gedämpft. »Et je le regrette beaucoup.«","""Je le sais, madame,"" answered Hans Castorp quietly. ""Et je le regrette beaucoup.""","“Je le sais, madame,” Hans Castorp answered gently, “et je le regrette beaucoup.”","“Je le sais, madame,” Hans Castorp replied in a muted voice. “Et je le regrette beaucoup.”"
"»Sehr wahr, die Plastik«, sagte Hans Castorp, während sie hinübergingen, und vergaß, das Bild wieder aufzuhängen oder abzustellen: er nahm es mit, trug es bei Fuß ins anstoßende Zimmer. »Sicher, so eine griechische Venus oder so ein Athlet, da zeigt sich das Humanistische zweifellos am deutlichsten, es ist wohl im Grunde das Wahre, die eigentlich humanistische Art von Kunst, wenn man es sich überlegt.«","""Very true, the sculpture,"" said Hans Castorp as they walked over, and forgot to put the picture up again or put it down: he took it with him and carried it by foot into the adjoining room. ""Certainly, a Greek Venus or an athlete like that, that's where the humanistic shows itself most clearly, it's basically the truth, the actually humanistic kind of art, if you think about it.""","“Quite right, sculpture,” Hans Castorp said, as they went. He forgot either to hang up or put down the picture he had been holding, but tugged it with him into the neighbouring room. “Certainly a Greek Venus or athlete is more humanistic, it is probably at bottom the most humanistic of all the arts, when one comes to think about it!”","“That’s very true, about sculpture,” Hans Castorp said as they moved away; and forgetting to rehang the painting or even to set it aside, he carried it with him, trailing it behind him into the adjoining area. “Certainly the humanist element is revealed most clearly in a Greek Venus or some athlete. When you stop and consider, it is, after all, the true, genuine humanist form of art.”"
"Soviel vom Liede und seinem Vortrag. Wir mögen uns wohl schmeicheln, es sei uns in früheren Fällen gelungen, unseren Zuhörern ein ungefähres Verständnis für die intime Teil{987}nahme einzuflößen, die Hans Castorp den Vorzugs-Programmnummern seiner nächtlichen Konzerte entgegenbrachte. Allein begreiflich zu machen, was diese letzte, dies Lied, der alte »Lindenbaum« ihm bedeutete, das ist nun freilich ein Unternehmen der kitzlichsten Art, und höchste Behutsamkeit der Intonation ist vonnöten, wenn nicht mehr verdorben, als gefördert werden soll.","So much for the song and its performance. We may well flatter ourselves that in earlier cases we have succeeded in instilling in our listeners a vague understanding of the intimate interest {987}that Hans Castorp took for the preferred program numbers of his nocturnal concerts. Just to make understandable what this last, this song, the old ""Lindenbaum"" meant to him, that is of course an undertaking of the most ticklish kind, and the utmost caution of the intonation is necessary, if it is not to spoil it more than it is to be encouraged.","So much for the song, and the rendering of it. For the earlier selections, we may flatter ourselves, perhaps, that we have been able to communicate to the reader some understanding, more or less precise, of Hans Castorp’s intimate emotional participation in the chosen numbers of his nightly programme. But to make clear what this last one, the old “Linden-tree,” meant to him, is truly a ticklish endeavour; requiring great delicacy of emphasis if more harm than good is not to come of the undertaking.","But enough of the song and this rendition of it. We would like to flatter ourselves that in our previous examples we succeeded in awakening in our listeners a general understanding of the intimate sympathy with which Hans Castorp approached his evening concerts. But it is, we must admit, a very tricky task to explain what this last work, this song, this old “linden tree,” meant to him, and the greatest care must be given to nuance, if we are not to do more harm than good."
"»Radames, Radames!« hörte man den unerbittlichen Ankläger zum drittenmal. »Dem Vaterlande, der Ehre und dem Könige brachst du deinen Eid.« – »Rechtfertige dich!« scholl es aufs neue. Und: »Felonie!« erkannte endgültig und mit Schauder die Priesterschaft, nachdem sie aufmerksam gemacht wor{977}den, daß Radames absolut stillschwieg. So konnte denn das Unausbleibliche nicht ausbleiben, daß der Chor, der stimmlich gleich beieinander geblieben war, dem Missetäter für Recht verkündete, sein Los sei erfüllt, er sterbe den Tod der Verfluchten, unter dem Tempel der zürnenden Gottheit habe er lebend ins Grab einzugehen.","""Radames, Radames!"" came the implacable accuser for the third time. ""You broke your oath to the fatherland, honor and the king."" ""Justify yourself!"" it rang out again. And: ""Felonia!"" recognized the priesthood finally and with a shudder, after they had been made aware that Radames was absolutely silent. So it was inevitable that the chorus, which remained vocally the same, proclaimed to the criminal that his lot had been fulfilled, he would die the death of the cursed, and under the temple of the angry deity he had to enter the grave alive.","“Radames, Radames,” for the third time comes the inexorable voice. “ To Fatherland, to honour and thy King, thy oath thou hast broken”—“Justify thyself,” resounded again. And finally, for the third time, “Fellonia,” the priestly chorus proclaims, after noting that Radames has again remained absolutely silent. So then there is nothing for it: the chorus announces the evil-doer for judgment, proclaims that his doom is sealed, that he must die the death of a deserter and be buried alive beneath the temple of the offended deity.","“Radames, Radames,” his remorseless accuser says for the third time. “You were false to your country, your king, your honor. ”—The cry of “Defend yourself!” rings out anew. And finally, after once again being told that Radames has said not a single word , the priests announce their final, ominous verdict of “Treason!” And so the unavoidable cannot be avoided, and the chorus, their voices still in close harmonies, announce the sentence—his doom is sealed, he is to die the death of the damned, is to be buried alive in a grave beneath the temple of their angry god."

"Fünfmal täglich kam an den sieben Tischen einhellige Unzufriedenheit zum Ausdruck mit dem Witterungscharakter des diesjährigen Winters. Man urteilte, daß er seine Verpflichtungen als Hochgebirgswinter sehr mangelhaft erfülle, daß er die meteorologischen Kurmittel, denen die Sphäre ihren Ruf verdankte, durchaus nicht in dem Umfange bereitstelle, wie der Prospekt es verhieß, wie Langjährige es gewohnt waren und Neulinge es sich ausgemalt hatten. Gewaltige Ausfälle an Sonne waren zu verzeichnen, an Sonnenstrahlung, diesem wichtigen Heilfaktor, ohne dessen Mithilfe die Genesung sich zweifellos verzögerte … Und wie nun Herr Settembrini auch über die Aufrichtigkeit denken mochte, mit der die Berggäste ihre Genesung und ihre Rückkehr aus der »Heimat« ins Flachland betrieben: jedenfalls verlangten sie ihr Recht, jedenfalls wollten sie auf ihre Kosten kommen, auf diejenigen, die ihre Eltern, ihre Gatten für sie bestritten, und so murrten sie in ihren Gesprächen bei Tisch, im Lift und in der Halle. Auch zeigte die Oberleitung ein volles Einsehen in ihre Verpflichtung zu Aushilfe und Schadenersatz. Ein neuer Apparat für »künstliche Höhensonne« wurde angeschafft, da die beiden schon vorhandenen der Nachfrage derer nicht genügten, die sich auf elektrischem Wege braun brennen lassen wollten, was die jungen Mädchen und Frauen gut kleidete und der Männerwelt trotz horizontaler Lebensweise ein prächtig sportliches und erobererhaftes Ansehen verlieh. Ja, dies Ansehen trug Früchte im Wirklichen; die Frauen, obwohl völlig im klaren über die technisch-kosmetische Herkunft dieser Männlichkeit, waren dumm oder ausgepicht genug, auf Sinnentrug hinlänglich ver{707}sessen, um sich von der Illusion berauschen und weiblich hinnehmen zu lassen. »Mein Gott!« sagte Frau Schönfeld, eine rothaarige und rotäugige Kranke aus Berlin, abends in der Halle zu einem Kavalier mit langen Beinen und eingefallener Brust, der sich auf seiner Karte als »Aviateur diplômé et Enseigne de la Marine allemande« bezeichnete und mit dem Pneumothorax versehen war, übrigens zum Mittagessen im Smoking erschien und dies Kleidungsstück abends wieder ablegte, behauptend, bei der Marine sei das so Vorschrift, – »mein Gott!« sagte sie, indem sie den Enseigne gierig betrachtete, »wie herrlich braun er ist von Höhensonne! Wie ein Adlerjäger sieht er aus, dieser Teufel!« – »Wart, Nixe!« flüsterte er im Lift an ihrem Ohr, so daß eine Gänsehaut sie überlief, »Sie werden mir büßen müssen für Ihr verderbliches Augenspiel!« Und über die Balkons, an den gläsernen Scheidewänden vorbei, fand der Teufel und Adlerjäger den Weg zur Nixe …","Unanimous dissatisfaction with the weather conditions of this year's winter was expressed at the seven tables five times a day. It was judged that it was very inadequately fulfilling its obligations as a high mountain winter, that it was not providing the meteorological cures to which the sphere owed its reputation at all to the extent promised in the prospectus, as long-timers were used to and newcomers had imagined . Huge losses of sun were recorded, of solar radiation, that important healing factor, without whose help the recovery would undoubtedly be delayed ... And how Mr. Settembrini might think of the sincerity with which the mountain guests their recovery and their return from ""home"" driven to the lowlands: in any case they demanded their rights, in any case they wanted to get their money's worth, from those who denied their parents, their husbands, and so they grumbled in their conversations at table, in the elevator and in the hall. The overhead management also showed full understanding of their obligation to provide temporary assistance and compensation. A new apparatus for ""artificial sunlamps"" was purchased, since the two existing ones did not meet the demand of those who wanted to be tanned electrically, which dressed the young girls and women well and offered the men a splendidly sporty and conquering reputation. Yes, this reputation bore fruit in reality; the women, although fully aware of the technical-cosmetic origin of this masculinity, were stupid enough or keen enough, obsessed enough with sense deception, to allow themselves to be intoxicated by the illusion and to be accepted as feminine. ""My God!"" said Frau Schönfeld, a red-haired and red-eyed patient from Berlin, that evening in the hall to a cavalier with long legs and a sunken chest, who described himself on his card as ""Aviateur diplômé et Enseigne de la Marine allemande"" and pneumothorax, incidentally showed up to lunch in a tuxedo, and took that off in the evening, claiming it was a Navy regulation—""My God!"" she said, looking greedily at the Enseigne, ""how lovely a brown he is from mountain sun! He looks like an eagle hunter, this devil!« – »Wait, Nixe!« he whispered in the elevator to her ear, so that goosebumps ran over her, »You will have to pay me for your fatal eye game!« And over the balconies, past the glass partitions, the devil and eagle hunter found his way to the mermaid...","DAILY, five times a day, the guests expressed unanimous dissatisfaction with the kind of winter they were having. They felt it was not what they had a right to expect of these altitudes. It failed to deliver the renowned meteorological specific in anything like the quantity indicated by the prospectus, quoted by old inhabitants, or anticipated by new. There was a very great failure in the supply of sunshine, an element so important in the cures achieved up here that without it they were distinctly retarded. And whatever Herr Settembrini might think of the sincerity of the patients’ desire to finish their cure, leave “home” and return to the flat-land, at any rate they insisted on their just dues. They wanted what they were entitled to, what their parents or husbands had paid for, and they grumbled unceasingly, at table, in lift, and in hall. The management showed a consciousness of what it owed them by installing a new apparatus for heliotherapy. They had two already, but these did not suffice for the demands of those who wished to get sunburnt by electricity—it was so becoming to the ladies, young and old, and made all the men, though confirmed horizontallers, look irresistibly athletic. And the ladies, even though aware of the mechanicocosmetical origin of this conquering-hero air, were foolish enough to be carried away by it. There was Frau Schönfeld, a red-haired, red-eyed patient from Berlin. In the salon she looked thirstily at a long-legged, sunken-chested gallant, who described himself on his visiting-card as “Aviateur diplomé et Enseigne de la Marine allemande.” He was fitted out with the pneumothorax and wore “smoking” at the midday meal but not in the evening, saying this was their custom in the navy. “My God,” breathed Frau Schönfeld at him, “what a tan this demon has—he gets it from the helio—it makes him look like a hunter of eagles!” “Just wait, nixie!” he whispered in her ear, in the lift, “I’ll make you pay for looking at me like that!” It made gooseflesh and shivers run over her. And along the balconies, past the glass partitions, the demon eagle-hunter found his way to the nixie.","Five times a day, the diners at all seven tables expressed unanimous dissatisfaction with this year’s winter. They were of the opinion that it was very negligent in fulfilling its duties as an Alpine winter and had failed to provide the meteorological medicine for which these regions were famous, in the quantities promised by the brochure, familiar to long-termers, and envisioned by newcomers. A massive deficit in sunlight—a significant factor in the cure—was noted; without those helpful rays, recuperation was doubtless retarded. And whatever Herr Settembrini might think of the sincerity with which these mountain guests went about getting well so that they could leave “home” and return to the flatlands, they did at any rate demand their rights, wanted full value for the money spent by their parents or spouses; and so they grumbled in the dining hall, the elevator, and the lobby. And management proved quite sensible about accommodating its guests and compensating for their losses. Another apparatus for “artificial sunlight” was purchased, since the two in service could not meet the demands of those who expected electricity to help them get a tan—a color that flattered the young girls and women and gave the men a splendidly, irresistibly athletic look despite their horizontal lifestyle. That look reaped its rewards in reality, too; the women, although fully aware of the purely cosmetic and technical origin of such virility, were foolish—or hardened—enough that they gladly chose to be deceived, to be carried away by the illusion, to let it capture their feminine hearts. “My God,” a red-haired, red-eyed patient from Berlin remarked one evening in the lobby. It was Frau Schönfeld, and she was speaking about a cavalier with long legs and a sunken chest—he had already undergone pneumothorax—whose calling card read “Aviateur diplômé et Enseigne de la Marine allemande” and who always appeared at dinner in formal dress, though never at supper, as per navy regulations, or so he claimed. “My God,” she said, voraciously eyeing the ensign, “what a marvelous tan the fellow has from the sunlamp. Looks as if he’s been out hunting eagles, the devil does.” And in the elevator he gave her goose bumps, bending down to her ear and whispering, “Just wait, you nymph! You’ll pay for that devastating glance you shot my way!” And skirting the glass panels of balconies, the devil and eagle-hunter found his way to the nymph."

"Dies also könnte wundernehmen; und doch ist es in der Ordnung und entspricht den Gesetzen des Erzählens und Zuhörens. Denn in der Ordnung ist es und diesen Gesetzen entspricht es, daß uns die Zeit genau so lang oder kurz wird, für unser Erlebnis sich genau ebenso breit macht oder zusammenschrumpft, wie dem auf so unerwartete Art vom Schicksal mit Beschlag belegten Helden unserer Geschichte, dem jungen Hans Castorp; und es mag nützlich sein, den Leser in Ansehung des Zeitgeheimnisses auf noch ganz andere Wunder und Phänomene, als das hier auffallende, vorzubereiten, die uns in seiner Gesellschaft zustoßen werden. Für jetzt genügt es, daß jedermann sich erinnert, wie rasch eine Reihe, ja eine »lange« Reihe von Tagen vergeht, die man als Kranker im Bette verbringt: es ist immer derselbe Tag, der sich wiederholt; aber da es {280}immer derselbe ist, so ist es im Grunde wenig korrekt, von »Wiederholung« zu sprechen; es sollte von Einerleiheit, von einem stehenden Jetzt oder von der Ewigkeit die Rede sein. Man bringt dir die Mittagssuppe, wie man sie dir gestern brachte und sie dir morgen bringen wird. Und in demselben Augenblick weht es dich an – du weißt nicht, wie und woher; dir schwindelt, indes du die Suppe kommen siehst, die Zeitformen verschwimmen dir, rinnen ineinander, und was sich als wahre Form des Seins dir enthüllt, ist eine ausdehnungslose Gegenwart, in welcher man dir ewig die Suppe bringt. Mit Bezug auf die Ewigkeit aber von Langerweile zu sprechen, wäre sehr paradox; und Paradoxe wollen wir meiden, besonders im Zusammenleben mit diesem Helden.","So this might surprise you; and yet it is in order and conforms to the laws of storytelling and listening. Because it is in order and it corresponds to these laws that time becomes just as long or short for us, expands or shrinks for our experience just as much as the hero of our story, who was so unexpectedly seized by fate, the young Hans Castorp; and it may be useful, with regard to the mystery of the time, to prepare the reader for quite different miracles and phenomena than those striking here, which will happen to us in his society. For now it suffices that everyone remembers how quickly a series, indeed a ""long"" series of days pass that one spends as a sick person in bed: it is always the same day that repeats itself; but since it is always the same, it is basically not correct to speak of ""repetition""; there should be talk of oneness, of a standing now or of eternity. They bring you the midday soup, just as it was brought to you yesterday and will be brought to you tomorrow. And at the same moment it blows at you - you don't know how and from where; you feel dizzy as you see the soup coming, the tenses blur, flow into one another, and what is revealed to you as the true form of being is an unexpanded present in which the soup is brought to you forever. But to speak of boredom with reference to eternity would be very paradoxical; and we want to avoid paradoxes, especially in living with this hero.","Which is perhaps surprising; yet quite in order, and conformable to the laws that govern the telling of stories and the listening to them. For it is in accordance with these laws that time seems to us just as long, or just as short, that it expands or contracts precisely in the way, and to the extent, that it did for young Hans Castorp, our hero, whom our narrative now finds visited with such an unexpected blow from the hand of fate. It may even be well at this point to prepare the reader for still other surprises, still other phenomena, bearing on the mysterious element of time, which will confront us if we continue in our hero’s company. For the moment we need only recall the swift flight of time—even of a quite considerable period of time—which we spend in bed when we are ill. All the days are nothing but the same day repeating itself—or rather, since it is always the same day, it is incorrect to speak of repetition; a continuous present, an identity, an everlastingness—such words as these would better convey the idea. They bring you your midday broth, as they brought it yesterday and will bring it to-morrow; and it comes over you—but whence or how you do not know, it makes you quite giddy to see the broth coming in—that you are losing a sense of the demarcation of time, that its units are running together, disappearing; and what is being revealed to you as the true content of time is merely a dimensionless present in which they eternally bring you the broth. But in such a connexion it would be paradoxical to speak of time as passing slowly; and paradox, with reference to such a hero, we would avoid.","That may well cause amazement—and yet it is perfectly in order and corresponds to the laws of how stories are told and listened to. Because both good order and the laws of narrative require that our experience of time should seem long or short, should expand or shrink, in the same way it does for the hero of our story, for young Hans Castorp, who quite unexpectedly has found himself impounded by fate. It may also be useful to prepare the reader for other wonders and phenomena that are connected with the mystery of time and that we shall encounter while in his company—quite apart from this striking instance. But for now it is enough for us to remind everyone how quickly a number of days, indeed a great number, can pass when one spends them as a patient in bed. It is always the same day—it just keeps repeating itself. Although since it is always the same day, it is surely not correct to speak of “repetition.” One should speak of monotony, of an abiding now, of eternalness. Someone brings you your midday soup, the same soup they brought you yesterday and will bring again tomorrow. And in that moment it comes over you —you don’t know why or how, but you feel dizzy watching them bring in the soup. The tenses of verbs become confused, they blend and what is now revealed to you as the true tense of all existence is the “inelastic present,” the tense in which they bring you soup for all eternity. But one can’t speak of boredom, because boredom comes with the passing of time—and that would be a paradox in relation to eternity. And we want to avoid paradoxes, particularly if we are to live with our hero."

"In diesem Geiste schrieb er denn, unter Beobachtung der Technik, die er Joachim mehrmals hatte üben sehen: im Liegestuhl, mit dem Füllfederhalter, die Reisemappe auf den hochgezogenen Knien. Er schrieb auf einem Briefbogen der Anstalt, von denen ein Vorrat in der Tischschublade bereit lag, an James Tienappel, der ihm unter den drei Onkels am nächsten stand, und bat ihn, den Konsul zu unterrichten. Er sprach von einem leidigen Zwischenfall, von Befürchtungen, die sich bewahrheitet hätten, von der ärztlicherseits erklärten Notwendigkeit, einen Teil des Winters, vielleicht den ganzen hier oben {341}zu verbringen, denn Fälle wie der seinige seien oft hartnäckiger als solche, die sich pompöser anließen, und es gelte doch, nachdrücklich einzugreifen und beizeiten ein für allemal vorzubauen. Unter diesem Gesichtspunkt, meinte er, sei es ja ein Glück und eine günstige Fügung, daß er zufällig jetzt heraufgekommen und veranlaßt worden sei, sich untersuchen zu lassen; denn sonst wäre er wohl noch lange über seinen Zustand im unklaren geblieben und später vielleicht auf viel empfindlichere Art darüber belehrt worden. Was die voraussichtliche Dauer der Kur betreffe, so möge man sich nicht wundern, daß er sich wahrscheinlich den Winter werde um die Ohren schlagen müssen und kaum früher als Joachim in die Ebene werde zurückkehren können. Die Zeitbegriffe seien hier andere, als die sonst wohl für Badereisen und Kuraufenthalte gültigen; der Monat sei sozusagen die kleinste Zeiteinheit, und einzeln spiele er gar keine Rolle …","It was in this spirit that he wrote, observing the technique that he had seen Joachim practice several times: in a deck chair, with a fountain pen, the briefcase on his knees. He wrote to James Tienappel, who was closest to him of the three uncles, on a letter from the institution, a supply of which lay ready in the desk drawer, and asked him to brief the consul. He spoke of an unfortunate incident, of fears that had come true, of the need, declared by the doctor, to spend part of the winter, perhaps all of it, up here {341}, because cases like his were often more stubborn than those that more pompous, and yet it is important to intervene vigorously and to take action once and for all in good time. From this point of view, he said, it was fortunate and fortunate that he had happened to come up here and be asked to be examined; for otherwise he would have remained in the dark about his condition for a long time and perhaps later been informed about it in a much more sensitive way. As far as the probable duration of the cure is concerned, one should not be surprised that he will probably have to beat the winter out of his head and will be able to return to the plains scarcely before Joachim. The concepts of time here are different from those that are otherwise valid for bathing trips and spa stays; the month is, so to speak, the smallest unit of time, and individually it plays no role at all ...","In this spirit, then, he wrote, practising the technique he had so often seen Joachim practise; with a fountain-pen, in his deck-chair, with his knees drawn up and the portfolio laid upon them. He wrote upon the letter-paper of the establishment, of which he kept a supply in his table drawer, to James Tienappel, who stood closest to him among the three uncles, and asked him to pass the news on to the Consul. He spoke of an unfortunate occurrence, of suspicions that had proved justified, of the medical opinion that it would be best for him to remain where he was for a part, perhaps for all of the winter, since cases like his often proved more obstinate than those that began more alarmingly and it was clearly advisable to go after the infection energetically and root it out once for all. From this point of view, he considered, it had been a most fortunate circumstance that he had chanced to come here, and been induced to submit to an examination, for otherwise he might have remained for some time in ignorance of his condition, and been apprised of it later and more alarmingly. As for the length of time which would probably be required for the cure, they must not be surprised to hear the whole winter might easily slip away before his return—in short, that he might come down hardly earlier than Joachim. Ideas about time were different up here from those ordinarily held about the length of stay at the baths, or at an ordinary cure. The smallest unit of time, so to speak, was the month, and a single month was almost no time at all.","And it was in this spirit that he wrote, making use of a technique he had frequently seen Joachim employ—sitting in his lounge chair, with his fountain pen in hand and a writing case against his raised knees. He wrote on sanatorium stationery, taken from an ample supply in his table drawer, to James Tienappel, the uncle to whom he felt closest of the three, and asked him to inform the consul. He spoke of an unforeseen vexation, of misgivings that had proved justified, of the necessity, on good medical advice, of spending a part of the winter, and perhaps all of it, up here, since cases such as his own were often more stubborn than those that began more spectacularly and since the important thing, really, was to intervene decisively and so arrest his case’s progress for good and all. Seen from this angle, he suggested, it was a stroke of fortune, a happy turn of fate, that he had chanced to come up here and had occasion to be examined; because otherwise he would probably have remained unaware of his condition much longer and perhaps have learned of it in a much more distressing fashion. As for the estimated time of his cure, one should not be surprised if he might have to make a winter of it and would be able to return to the plains hardly any earlier than Joachim. Notions of time here were different from those applicable to trips to the shore or stays at a spa. The month was, so to speak, the shortest unit of time, and a single month played no role at all."
"»Merci«, sagte sie mit einer rasselnden Aussprache, die sonderbar zu der Gebrochenheit ihres Wesens stimmte, und der eine Winkel ihres großen Mundes hing tragisch tief hinab. Dann zog sie die Hand unter die Mantille zurück, neigte den Kopf und machte sich wieder ans Wandern. Hans Castorp aber sagte im Weitergehen:","""Merci,"" she said in a rattling pronunciation oddly suited to the brokenness of her nature, and one corner of her large mouth hung tragically low. Then she drew her hand back under her mantilla, bowed her head, and began walking again. But Hans Castorp said as he walked on:","“Merci,” she said, with a loose, clacking pronunciation, oddly consonant with her broken appearance. Her large mouth drooped tragically at one corner. She drew her hand back beneath her mantle, inclined her head, and turned away. But Hans Castorp said as they walked on: “You see, I didn’t mind it at all, I got on with her quite well; I always do with such people; I understand instinctively how to go at them—","“Merci,” she said with a clanking accent that stood in strange contrast to her fragility, and one corner of her large mouth drooped tragically low. Then she pulled her hand back up under the mantilla, nodded, and turned to take up her wanderings again. As they walked on, Hans Castorp said, “You see, it didn’t bother me at all."
"Der Rest des Sonntags bot nichts Außerordentliches, abgesehen vielleicht von den Mahlzeiten, die, da sie reicher als gewöhnlich nicht wohl gestaltet werden konnten, wenigstens eine erhöhte Feinheit der Gerichte aufwiesen. (Zum Mittagessen gab es ein Chaud-froid von Hühnern, mit Krebsen und halbierten Kirschen verziert; zum Gefrorenen Patisserie in {178}Körbchen, die aus gesponnenem Zucker geflochten waren, und dann auch noch frische Ananas.) Abends, nachdem er sein Bier getrunken, fühlte Hans Castorp sich noch erschöpfter, frostiger und schwerer von Gliedern, als die Tage vorher, sagte seinem Vetter schon gegen neun Uhr gute Nacht, zog eilig das Federbett bis über das Kinn und schlief ein wie erschlagen.","The rest of Sunday offered nothing extraordinary, apart perhaps from the meals, which, since they could not be made richer than usual, at least showed an increased delicacy of the dishes. (For lunch there was a chaud-froid of chicken decorated with crabs and halved cherries; for frozen patisserie in wicker baskets of spun sugar, and then fresh pineapple too.) In the evening after he'd had his beer , Hans Castorp felt even more exhausted, chilly and heavier than the day before, said good night to his cousin around nine o'clock, hurriedly pulled the feather bed over his chin and fell asleep like a dead man.","The Sunday was not further remarkable, except perhaps for the meals, which, since they could not well be more abundant than they already were, displayed greater refinement in the menu. At luncheon there was a chaud-froid of chicken, garnished with crayfish and stoned cherries; with the ices came pastry served in baskets of spun sugar, and fresh pineapple besides. In the evening, after he had drunk his beer, Hans Castorp felt heavier in the limbs and more chilled and exhausted than on the day before; toward nine o’clock he bade his cousin good-night, drew his plumeau up to his chin, and slept like the dead.","In other respects Sunday offered nothing out of the ordinary, apart perhaps from the meals, which, since they could hardly be more sumptuous, were at least marked by a refinement in the cuisine. (Dinner included a chaudfroid of chicken, garnished with shrimps and halved cherries; ices with pastries in little baskets of spun sugar; even fresh pineapple.) After drinking his beer that evening, Hans Castorp felt more exhausted, chilled, and torpid than on any day thus far; he said good night to his cousin a little before nine, quickly slipped in under his comforter, pulling it up over his chin, and fell dead asleep."
"Sonst wurde Hans Castorp in diesen Tagen nur noch mit der schwarzbleichen Dame bekannt, jener Mexikanerin, die er im Garten gesehen hatte und die »Tous les deux« genannt wurde. Es geschah wirklich, daß auch er aus ihrem Munde die trübselige Formel hörte, die ihr zum Spitznamen geworden war; aber da er sich vorbereitet hatte, so bewahrte er gute Haltung dabei und konnte nachher zufrieden mit sich sein. Die Vettern trafen sie vor dem Hauptportal, als sie nach dem ersten Frühstück den vorgeschriebenen Morgenspaziergang antraten. In ein schwarzes Kaschmirtuch gehüllt, mit krummen Knien und {167}langen, ruhelos wandernden Tritten erging sie sich dort, und gegen den schwarzen Schleier, der um ihr silbern durchzogenes Haar geschlungen und unter dem Kinn zusammengebunden war, schimmerte mattweiß ihr alterndes Gesicht mit dem großen, verhärmten Munde. Joachim, ohne Hut wie gewöhnlich, begrüßte sie durch Verneigung, und sie dankte langsam, während beim Schauen die Querfalten in ihrer engen Stirn sich vertieften. Sie blieb stehen, da sie ein neues Gesicht bemerkte, und erwartete, leise mit dem Kopfe nickend, die Annäherung der jungen Leute; denn offenbar hielt sie es für notwendig zu hören, ob der Fremde von ihrem Schicksal wisse, und seine Äußerung darüber entgegenzunehmen. Joachim stellte seinen Vetter vor. Sie reichte dem Gast aus der Mantille heraus die Hand, eine magere, gelbliche, hoch geäderte, mit Ringen geschmückte Hand, und fuhr fort, ihn nickend anzublicken. Dann kam es:","Otherwise Hans Castorp only became acquainted with the black-pale lady, the Mexican woman he had seen in the garden and who was called ""Tous les deux"". It really so happened that he, too, heard from her lips the sad formula which had become her nickname; but since he had prepared himself, he maintained good composure and afterwards could be content with himself. The cousins met them in front of the main portal as they set out for the prescribed morning walk after their first breakfast. Wrapped in a black cashmere shawl, with bent-knees and long, restlessly wandering feet, she slouched there, and against the black veil that was wrapped around her silver-streaked hair and tied under her chin, her aging face gleamed dull white with the big, pinched mouth. Joachim, without his hat as usual, greeted her with a bow, and she slowly thanked her, while the cross lines in her narrow forehead deepened as she looked. She stopped, noticing a new face, and nodding her head softly, awaiting the young people's approach; for evidently she considered it necessary to hear whether the stranger knew of her fate, and to receive his statement about it. Joachim introduced his cousin. She extended her hand to the guest from inside the mantilla, a skinny, yellowish, highly veined, ringed hand, and continued to look at him, nodding. Then it came:","Hans Castorp made but one other acquaintance in these days: the pale, black-clad Mexican lady he had seen in the garden, whose nickname was Tous-les-deux. It came to pass that he heard from her own lips the tragic formula; and being forearmed, preserved a suitable demeanour and was satisfied with himself afterwards. The cousins met her before the front door, as they were setting forth on their prescribed walk after early breakfast. She was restlessly ranging there, with her pacing step, her legs bent at the knee-joints, wrapped in a black cashmere shawl, a black veil wound about her disordered silver hair and tied under her chin, her ageing face, with the large writhen mouth, gleaming dead-white against her mourning. Joachim, bare-headed as usual, greeted her with a bow, which she slowly acknowledged, the furrows deepening in her narrow forehead as she looked at him. Then, seeing a new face, she paused and waited, nodding gently as they came up to her; obviously she found it of importance to learn if the stranger was acquainted with her sad case, and to hear what he would say about it. Joachim presented his cousin. She drew her hand out of her shawl and gave it to him, a veined, emaciated, yellowish hand, with many rings, as she continued to gaze in his face. Then it came: “Tous les dé, monsieur,” she said.","The only other person whom Hans Castorp met during these first days was the pale lady in black, the Mexican woman, whom he had seen in the garden and who was known as Tous-les-deux. And indeed it came to pass that he himself heard her lips form the mournful phrase that had become her nickname. But since he was now prepared for it, he maintained his demeanor and afterward found he was quite satisfied with his behavior. The cousins met her at the front door as they stepped out after early breakfast for their morning constitutional. Veiled in a black cashmere scarf, her knees slightly bent, she was strolling aimlessly in long, restless strides; and her aging face, with its large, careworn mouth, shimmered dull white against the black veil she had wound around her silver-streaked hair and tied beneath her chin. Joachim, bareheaded as usual, greeted her with a bow, and she looked up and slowly acknowledged him while the long creases deepened on her narrow brow. Noticing a new face, she stopped, and gently nodding her head, she waited for the young men to approach, because she apparently felt it necessary to learn whether the stranger knew of her fate and to accept his condolences. Joachim presented his cousin. From under her mantilla she extended a hand to the visitor—a skinny, yellowish, heavily veined hand, adorned with rings—and went on looking at him and nodding. Then it happened: “Tous les dé, monsieur,” she said."
"»Du bist empfindlich? Laß das. Wir wollen die Empfindlichkeit zum Teufel schicken, – bist du einverstanden?

Ich habe mich geärgert an deinem Phlegma, und daß du dich auf so guten Fuß mit ihm stelltest um deines egoistischen Erlebnisses willen. Dennoch hat es mich gefreut, und ich war dir dankbar, daß du ihm Ehrfurcht erwiesest … Es war viel Loyalität in deinem Betragen, und wenn auch etwas Impertinenz mit unterlief, so mußte ich sie dir am Ende zugute halten.«","""Are you sensitive? Don't do that. We want to send sensitivity to hell - do you agree? I've been touchy at times too, I'll admit it, since we're sitting together this evening.

"»Sicher«, antwortete Joachim. »Den Wind, den kennen wir. Wenn der kommt, dann gibt es Schlittenbahn.«","""Sure,"" answered Joachim. “We know the wind.

"»Jetzt sprichst du ungenial und ganz konventionell, Clawdia. Das ist ja nur eine Redensart. Wie Settembrini kannst du es nicht meinen und wie denn sonst.

Gut, dafür war er Soldat. Aber ich bin keiner, ich bin Zivilist, für mich wäre es Fahnenflucht, zu tun, wie er, und partout, trotz Radamanths Verbot, im Flachlande so ganz direkt dem Nutzen und dem Fortschritt dienen zu wollen.

Well, that's why he was a soldier. But I'm not one, I'm a civilian, for me it would be desertion to do as he did, and to want to serve the interests and progress of the plains so directly, in spite of Radamanth's prohibition. That would be the greatest ingratitude and disloyalty to sickness and genius, and to my love for you, from which I have old scars and new wounds, and for your arms that I know—though I admit it was only in a dream , in an ingenious dream that I got to know her, so that of course you will not have any consequences, obligations or restrictions on your freedom...""","“Now that, Clavdia, is not spirituel— it even sounds conventional. You are just talking. You can’t mean it in Settembrini’s sense—and however else, then? I cannot take it seriously. I will not go off without permission, like my poor cousin, who, as you said he would, died because he tried to do service down below, and who knew himself, I suppose, that he would die, but preferred death to doing service up here any longer. Well, it was for that he was a soldier. But I am not. I am a civilian, for me it would be deserting the colours to do what he did, and go and serve the cause of progress down in the flat-land, despite what Behrens says. It would be the greatest disloyalty and ingratitude, to the illness, and its spirituel quality, and to my love for you, of which I bear scars both old and new—and to your arms I know so well, even admitting that it was in a dream, a highly spirituel dream , that I learned to know them, and that you had no responsibility for my dream, and were not bound by it, nor your freedom infringed on—”","“And now there is no genius whatever about you. You are speaking quite conventionally, Clavdia. Those are phrases. You can’t mean that the way Settembrini does; but if not, how do you mean it? You said it just for something to say, I cannot take it seriously. I shall not undertake a wild departure, like my poor cousin, who died, just as you predicted he would, trying to do his duty in the flatlands, and who probably knew himself that he would die, but preferred that to continuing his rest-cure duties here. Fine, that’s why he was a soldier. But I am not, I am a civilian. For me it would be deserting the colors to do what he did, to go down to the flatlands at all costs, despite Rhadamanthus’s prohibition, and try to be of use and serve progress. That would be base ingratitude and the worst disloyalty to my illness and to genius and to my love for you, from which I bear both old scars and new wounds, and to those arms of yours, that I know well—though I must admit it was only in our dream, a dream with a touch of genius, that I came to know them, which certainly implies no consequences or duties for you, no limitations on your freedom.”"

"Übrigens stand der Zorn, so unbegreiflich er anmuten mochte, ihm vortrefflich zu Gesichte, wie namentlich Hans Castorp sich bekennen mußte. Er entstellte ihn keineswegs, verkleinerte ihn nicht, wirkte in seiner Unbegreiflichkeit, die mit den genossenen Weinmengen in Beziehung zu setzen niemand in seinem Herzen sich unterstand, so groß und königlich, daß alle sich duckten und jedermann sich hütete, von den Fleischwaren noch einen Bissen zu nehmen. Frau Chauchat war es, die ihren Reisegefährten beschwichtigte. Sie streichelte seine breite, nach dem Schlag auf dem Tisch ruhende Kapitänshand und meinte schmeichelnd, man könnte ja etwas anderes bestellen, ein warmes Gericht, wenn er wolle, und wenn der Küchenchef noch dafür zu gewinnen sein werde. »Mein Kind,« sagte er, »– gut.« Und mühelos, in voller Würde fand er den Übergang von schwerem Koller zu einem gemäßigten Zustande, indem er Clawdias Hand küßte. Er wollte Omeletten für sich und die Seinen, – für jedermann eine gute Kräuter-Omelette, damit man den Anforderungen gerecht werden könne. Und er schickte mit der Bestellung einen Hundertfranken{852}schein in die Küche, um das Personal zum Unterbrechen des Feierabends zu bestimmen.","Incidentally, the anger, however incomprehensible it might seem, suited him admirably, as Hans Castorp in particular had to admit. He in no way distorted it, did not diminish it, in his incomprehensibility, which no one in his heart dared to relate to the amount of wine consumed, seemed so grand and royal that everyone ducked and everyone was careful not to take another bite of the meat gain weight. It was Mrs. Chauchat who reassured her traveling companion. She stroked his broad captain's hand, which was still on the table after the smack on the table, and said flatteringly that one could order something else, a warm dish, if he wanted, and if the chef could still be persuaded to do it. ""My child,"" he said, ""--well."" And effortlessly, with all dignity, he found the transition from severe raving to a moderate state by kissing Clawdia's hand. He wanted omelettes for himself and his family - a good herb omelette for everyone so that the demands could be met. And he sent a hundred-franc note to the kitchen with the order to tell the staff to take a break from work.","But his rage, however disproportionate, became him magnificently, Hans Castorp saw that. It did not misrepresent or render him petty: it wrought his incoherence, which no one in the group could have had the heart to connect with the mixture of wine he had drunk, to so royal a pitch that they all with one accord agreed, and took not another bite of the offending viands. Frau Chauchat set to work to mollify her companion’s mood. She stroked his great sea-captain’s hand, as it rested on the cloth after the blow he had struck, and said cajolingly that they might order something else, a hot dish, perhaps, if the chef could be won over. “Very good, my child,” Peeperkorn said, assuaged. And passed, without abating his dignity, from a full torrent of wrath to a state of appeasement, as he took Clavdia’s hand and kissed it. He ordered omelets for himself and the company, for each person a fine large omelette aux fines herbes, to help them do justice to the demands life made on them. And accompanied the order with a hundred-franc note as a sweetener for the staff.","Anger, incomprehensible though it might be, looked splendid on him, by the way, as Hans Castorp in particular was forced to admit. It did not distort his features or diminish him as a man, and its very incomprehensibility—and no one would have had the impudence to attribute it to the quantities of wine he had enjoyed—lent him something grand and majestic, so that they all deferred to him and did not attempt another bite of food. It was Frau Chauchat who calmed her traveling companion. She patted his broad captain’s hand, still resting on the table where it had fallen, and coaxed him with the suggestion that one could always order something else, something warm, if he liked and if the chef could be talked into it. “My child,” he said, “fine.” And retaining his full dignity, he made an effortless transition from rage to composure and kissed Clavdia’s hand. He would like omelets for himself and his friends—a good omelette aux fines herbes for everyone, so that they might all give life’s demands their due. He sent a hundred francs along with his order to convince the kitchen staff to return to work."
"Es half dem guten Joachim nichts, er mußte mithalten. Hans Castorps Antrieb und charitativer Unternehmungsgeist war stärker als seines Vetters Abneigung, welche dieser höchstens durch Schweigen und Niederschlagen der Augen geltend machen konnte, da er sie, ohne Mangel an Christentum zu bekunden, nicht zu begründen gewußt hätte. Hans Castorp sah das sehr wohl und zog seinen Nutzen daraus. Er verstand auch genau den militärischen Sinn dieser Unlust. Aber wenn er selbst sich nun doch belebt und beglückt fühlte durch solche {460}Unternehmungen, und wenn sie ihm förderlich schienen? Dann mußte er über Joachims stillen Widerstand eben hinwegschreiten. Er erwog mit ihm, ob man auch dem jungen Fritz Rotbein Blumen schicken oder bringen könne, obgleich dieser Moribundus männlichen Geschlechtes war. Er wünschte sehr, es zu tun; Blumen, fand er, gehörten dazu; der Streich mit der Hortensie, die violett und wohlgeformt gewesen war, hatte ihm ausnehmend gefallen; und so entschied er denn, daß Rotbeins Geschlecht durch seinen finalen Zustand ausgeglichen werde, und daß er, um Blumenspenden entgegenzunehmen, auch nicht Geburtstag zu haben brauche, da Sterbende ohne weiteres und in Permanenz wie Geburtstagskinder zu behandeln seien. So gesonnen, suchte er mit dem Vetter denn wieder die erdig-warme Duftatmosphäre des Blumengeschäftes auf und trat bei Herrn Rotbein mit einem frisch besprengten und duftenden Rosen-, Nelken- und Levkoiengebinde ein, geführt von Alfreda Schildknecht, die die jungen Leute gemeldet hatte.","It didn't help the good Joachim, he had to keep up. Hans Castorp's drive and charitable spirit of enterprise were stronger than his cousin's dislike, which the latter could only assert by remaining silent and casting down his eyes, since he would not have been able to justify it without professing a lack of Christianity. Hans Castorp saw this very well and took advantage of it. He also understood exactly the military meaning of this reluctance. But what if he himself felt invigorated and happy through such undertakings, and if they seemed beneficial to him? Then he had to step over Joachim's silent resistance. He discussed with him whether flowers could also be sent or brought to young Fritz Rotbein, although this moribundus was male. He wished very much to do it; Flowers, he thought, were part of it; he had particularly liked the trick with the hydrangea, which had been violet and shapely; and so he decided that Rotbein's sex would be balanced by his final condition, and that he didn't need to have a birthday to accept donations of flowers either, since the dying were to be treated readily and permanently as birthday children. With this attitude, he and his cousin went back to the earthy, warm and fragrant atmosphere of the flower shop and entered Herr Rotbein's with a freshly sprinkled and fragrant bouquet of roses, carnations and levkoia, led by Alfreda Schildknecht, who had reported the young people.","Nothing for it but that the good Joachim must go along. Hans Castorp’s charitable impulse was stronger than his cousin’s distaste; which the latter, moreover, could only manifest by silence and averted eyes, since he could not stand for it except by betraying a lack of Christian feeling. Hans Castorp saw that very well, and drew advantage from it. Equally he perceived the military grounds for the distaste; but if he himself felt the happier and stronger for such undertakings, if they seemed to him conducive to good ends? In that case, he must simply override Joachim’s silent disapproval. He deliberated with his cousin whether they might send or bring flowers to Fritz Rotbein, he being a man. He desired to do so. Flowers, he felt, were proper to the occasion, and the purchase of the pretty, well-shaped purple hortensia had greatly pleased him. He came to the conclusion that Fritz Rotbein’s sex was, so to speak, neutralized by his mortal state; also that there was no need of a birthday to serve as excuse, since the dying are to be treated as though in enjoyment of a permanent birthday. Thus minded, he sought once more with his cousin the warm, earthy, scentladen air of the flower-shop, and brought back a dewy fragrant bunch of roses, wallflowers, and carnations, with which they entered Herr Rotbein’s room, ushered by Alfreda Schildknecht.","There was nothing for it—good Joachim would have to come along. Hans Castorp’s impulse for altruistic enterprise was stronger than his cousin’s reluctance—manifest primarily in Joachim’s silence and lowered gaze—because, barring an admission of a lack of Christian charity, he had no cogent explanation to offer. Hans Castorp saw that clearly, and used it to his advantage. He understood very well the military nature of that reluctance. But what if he himself felt excited and pleased by such plans, what if he found them useful? Why then, he would have to ignore Joachim’s silent resistance. He discussed with him whether they ought to send young Fritz Rotbein flowers as well, or perhaps take some with them, even though they were dealing with a moribund male. He wanted very much to do it; flowers, he said, were simply proper; he had been especially pleased by his hydrangea gambit—the purple blossoms, the nice full shape. And so he decided that Rotbein’s sex was offset by his terminal condition and that a gift of flowers did not require a birthday, particularly since a dying person surely ought to be treated as if every day were his birthday. And with that in mind and his cousin at his side, he again sought out the warm, earthy-scented air of the flower shop; carrying a dewy bouquet of fragrant roses, carnations, and wallflowers, he entered Herr Rotbein’s room, ushered in by Alfreda Schildknecht, who had first announced the two young men’s visit."
"»Seht ihr?« dachte Hans Castorp. Und er fügte das Postskriptum hinzu: »Der Brief hat mich doch angestrengt. Ich messe 37,8. Ich sehe, daß ich mich vorläufig sehr ruhig verhalten muß. Ihr müßt entschuldigen, wenn ich selten schreibe.« Dann lag er und hob seine Hand gegen den Himmel, das Innere nach außen, so, wie er sie hinter den Leuchtschirm gehalten. Aber das Himmelslicht ließ ihre Lebensform unberührt, sogar noch dunkler und undurchsichtiger wurde ihr Stoff vor seiner Helle, und nur ihre äußersten Umrisse zeigten sich rötlich durchleuchtet. Es war die Lebenshand, die er zu sehen, zu säubern, zu benutzen gewohnt war – nicht jenes fremde Gerüst, das er im Schirme erblickt –, die analytische Grube, die er damals offen gesehen, hatte sich wieder geschlossen.","""See?"" thought Hans Castorp. And he added the postscript: 'The letter was a strain on me. I measure 37.8. I see that for the time being I must behave very calmly. You must excuse me if I seldom write.” Then he lay and raised his hand toward the sky, inside out, just as he held it behind the fluorescent screen. But the light of heaven left their form of life untouched, their substance became even darker and more opaque in front of its brightness, and only their outermost outlines showed reddish light. It was the hand of life that he was accustomed to seeing, cleaning, using - not that alien scaffolding that he sees on the screen - the analytical pit that he saw open at the time had closed again.","“Look at that,” he thought; and added a postscript to his letter: “It did strain me rather, after all, to write this. My temperature is 100°. I see that I must be very quiet, for the present. You must excuse me if I don’t write often.” Then he lay back, and held up his hand toward the light, palm outward, as he had held it behind the lightscreen. But the light of day did not encroach upon its living outline; rather it looked more substantial and opaque for its background of bright air, only its outer edges were rosily illuminated. This was his living hand, that he was used to see, to use, to wash— not that uncanny scaffolding which he had beheld through the screen. The analytic grave then opened was closed again.","“You see?” Hans Castorp thought. And he added a postscript: “This letter has been quite an effort. My temperature stands at a hundred degrees. I see that for the time being I shall have to keep very quiet. You will have to excuse me if I do not write often.” Then he lay back and lifted a hand to the sky, palm out, just as he had held it behind the fluorescent screen. But daylight had no effect on its living form, the stuff of it grew even darker and more opaque against the brightness and just its outer edge shone reddish. It was the living hand he was accustomed to seeing, washing, using—not the alien scaffold he had seen in the screen. The analytical pit he had seen open up before him that day had closed again."
"Diese Zumutung, man solle sein Gesicht befühlen, paßte ganz und gar nicht zu Hans Castorps Natur und berührte ihn selber peinlich. Joachim ging auch nicht darauf ein, sondern sagte nur:","This impertinence that one should feel his face did not at all suit Hans Castorp's nature and affected him embarrassingly. Joachim didn't respond either, he just said:","This demand was entirely foreign to the young man’s nature—so much so that he himself was disagreeably impressed as he heard himself make it. Joachim did not take up the offer, but merely said: “That is the air—it doesn’t mean anything; Behrens himself is purple in the face all day long.","The suggestion that someone feel his face was not at all typical of Hans Castorp, and even he was embarrassed by it. Joachim did not acknowledge it, but merely said, “It’s the air here, it doesn’t mean anything."
"»Man weiß nicht, ob man das Umgekehrte wünschen soll«, sagte Settembrini. »Daß Sie die Baisers allein genossen und die Liegekur mit dem Hauptmann Miklosich ausgeübt hätten …«","""One does not know whether one should wish the opposite,"" said Settembrini. ""That you enjoyed the meringues alone and practiced the rest cure with Captain Miklosich...""","“One asks oneself, had it not been better the other way about,” Settembrini went on; “you enjoying the kisses by yourself, and the rest-cure with Captain Miklosich—”","“One really cannot say whether one might not prefer it the other way around,” Settembrini said, “so that you could have enjoyed your meringues alone and taken your rest cure with Captain Miklosich.”"
"Der Schrecken aller war teils freudiger, teils banger Art. Frau Stöhr erklärte weinerlich, lieber aufhören zu wollen, doch wurde ihr bedeutet, daß sie sich früher hätte prüfen müssen und sich nun still zu verhalten habe. Die Dinge schienen in Fluß zu kommen. Man stipulierte, daß, um ja und nein zu antworten, das Glas nicht erst die Buchstaben sollte anlaufen müssen, {1003}sondern sich mit ein- und zweimaligem Aufschlagen begnügen möge.","Everyone's terror was partly joyful, partly apprehensive. Frau Stohr tearfully declared that she would rather stop, but she was told that she should have checked herself earlier and now had to keep quiet. Things seemed to be moving. It was stipulated that, in order to answer yes and no, the glass should not first have to tarnish the letters, {1003}but should be content with hitting it once or twice.","They were all startled; favourably, yet with some alarm. Frau Stöhr whimpered that she would like to stop, but they told her she should have thought of that before, she must just keep quiet now. Things seemed in train. They stipulated that, in order to answer yes or no, the glass need not run to the letters, but might give one or two knocks instead.","The start it gave them all was partly of fright, partly of joy. Frau Stöhr whimpered she wanted to stop, but it was made clear to her that she should have thought of that before and was to keep quiet. Things were under way now, or so it seemed. They stipulated that for a yes or no, the glass would not have to point to letters, but could simply reply with one or two knocks."
"»Hör mal,« sagte Joachim, »was hast du denn? Ich glaube, es greift dich an hier bei uns?«","""Listen,"" said Joachim, ""what's the matter with you? I think it's attacking you here with us?""","“I say,” Joachim said, “what’s the matter with you? Seems to me it goes to your head to be up here with us!”","“Listen here,” Joachim said, “what’s wrong with you? I think being up here with us is getting to you.”"
"Denn es war da ein anderer Mann, – zu entlarven gab es nichts, was ihn betraf, der Fall war klar. Dieser Mann hieß Sonnenschein, und da man nicht schmutziger heißen konnte, so bildete Sonnenscheins Person vom ersten Tage an die Puschel, die vor Wiedemanns Nase hing, auf die er kurz und boshaft schielte, und nach der er mit der Hand schlug, fast weniger, um sie zu verjagen, als um sie ins Pendeln zu versetzen, damit sie ihn desto besser reize.","Because there was another man there - there was nothing to expose as far as he was concerned, the case was clear. This man's name was sunshine, and since one couldn't be called dirtier, sunshine's person from the very first day was the pom-pom that hung in front of Wiedemann's nose, at which he briefly and maliciously squinted and at which he slapped his hand, almost less, to chase her away, than to set her in motion, so that she could irritate him the better.","For there was another man. No possibility of concealing what he was, the case was clear. The man’s name was Sonnenschein, than which he could bear no filthier; and thus he became for Wiedemann the punching-ball in front of his nose, at which he squinted with his threatening glare, at which he struck, not so much to drive it away as to set it in motion that it might rasp his nerves the more. Sonnenschein, like the other, was a business man born and bred. He too was","For there was another man present—and there was nothing about him that needed unmasking, the case was clear. The man’s name was Sonnenschein; and since one could not have a filthier name than that, from Wiedemann’s very first day here Sonnenschein became the tassel in front of his nose, at which he squinted furtively and maliciously, batting at it with his hand, less to push it aside than to start it swinging so that it could annoy him all the more."
"Nun, meinte Hans Castorp, als die Kleefeld es ihm erzählte, das habe doch einigen Verstand, es lasse sich hören. Die Erscheinung hier, der Todesfall dort, – immerhin, da sei ein gewisser achtbarer Zusammenhang zu ersehen. Und er willigte ein, an einem spiritistischen Gesellschaftsspiel, einem Glasrükken, teilzunehmen, das man aus Ungeduld, unter heimlicher Umgehung von Dr. Krokowskis eifersüchtigem Verbot, mit Ellen Brand zu veranstalten beschlossen hatte.","Well, said Hans Castorp when Kleefeld told him, that had some sense, that one could listen to it. The apparition here, the death there - nevertheless, there is a certain respectable connection to be seen. And he agreed to take part in a spiritistic parlor game, a glass back, which, impatiently, was secretly bypassed by Dr. Krokowski's jealous ban on hosting with Ellen Brand.","Hans Castorp, when Fräulein Kleefeld related this to him, expressed the view that there was some sort of sense in it: the apparition here, the death there—after all, they did hang together. And he consented to be present at a spiritualistic sitting, a tabletipping, glass-moving game which they had determined to undertake with Ellen Brand, behind Dr. Krokowski’s back, and in defiance of his jealous prohibition.","Well, Hans Castorp replied, when Fräulein Kleefeld told him all this, that made some sense, it sounded plausible. A vision here, a death there—at least you could see some sort of satisfactory connection. And he agreed to take part in a spiritualistic parlor game, a séance performed with a moving glass, that the others, having lost patience with Dr. Krokowski’s jealous prohibitions concerning Ellen Brand, had decided to hold secretly behind his back."
"Von diesen Zweifeln und Erwägungen sprach Hans Castorp auf seine Weise einiges aus, als er mit Joachim vom »Berghof« und seinem ärztlichen Leiter schwatzte, aber Joachim bemerkte dagegen, man wisse ja gar nicht, ob Hofrat Behrens heute noch selber Patient sei, – wahrscheinlich sei er schon längst genesen. Daß er hier zu praktizieren begonnen hatte, war lange her, – er hatte es eine Weile auf eigene Hand getrieben und sich als feinhöriger Auskultator wie auch als sicherer Pneumotom rasch einen Namen gemacht. Dann hatte der »Berghof« sich seiner Person versichert, das Institut, mit dem er nun bald seit einem Jahrzehnt so eng verwachsen war … Dort hinten, am Ende des nordwestlichen Flügels, lag seine Wohnung (Dr. Krokowski hauste nicht weit davon), und jene altadelige Dame, die Schwester-Oberin, von der Settembrini so höhnisch gesprochen und die Hans Castorp bisher nur flüchtig gesehen hatte, stand dem kleinen Witwerhaushalte vor. Im übrigen war der Hofrat allein, denn sein Sohn studierte an reichsdeutschen Universitäten, und seine Tochter war schon vermählt: nämlich an einen Advokaten im französischen Teile der Schweiz. Der junge Behrens kam in den Ferien zuweilen zu Besuch, was sich während Joachims Aufenthalt schon einmal ereignet hatte, und er sagte, die Damen der Anstalt seien dann sehr bewegt, die Temperaturen stiegen, Eifersüchteleien führten zu Zank und Streit auf den Liegehallen, und erhöhter Zudrang herrsche zu Dr. Krokowskis besonderer Sprechstunde …","Hans Castorp expressed some of these doubts and considerations in his own way when he chatted with Joachim from the ""Berghof"" and his medical director, but Joachim remarked that it was not known at all whether Hofrat Behrens was still a patient himself - probably he had long since recovered. It was a long time since he had started practicing here - he had done it on his own for a while and quickly made a name for himself as a sensitive auscultator as well as a reliable pneumotome. Then the ""Berghof"" had assured himself of his person, the institute with which he had grown so closely for almost a decade ... Back there, at the end of the north-west wing, was his apartment (Dr. Krokowski lived not far from it), and that old-noble lady, the sister-superintendent, of whom Settembrini had spoken so derisively and whom Hans Castorp had hitherto only glimpsed, headed the small widower's household. For the rest, the privy councilor was alone, for his son was studying at German universities, and his daughter was already married to a lawyer in the French part of Switzerland. Young Behrens sometimes came to visit during the holidays, which had happened once before during Joachim's stay, and he said that the ladies of the institution were then very moved, the temperature rose, jealousies led to quarrels and arguments in the lying-in halls, and increased There is a rush to Dr. Krokowski's special consultation hour...","Hans Castorp expressed some of these doubts and speculations, as he and Joachim gossiped about the Berghof and its professional head. But Joachim answered that nobody knew whether the Hofrat was still a patient—he was probably long since cured. It was ages ago that he had first begun to practise here; independently at first, and early winning a name for himself as an extraordinarily gifted auscultator and skilful surgeon. Then the Berghof had secured him; it would soon be ten years that he had been in intimate association with it. His private residence was in the end of the north-west wing of the building (Dr. Krokowski’s was not far off), and that lady of the lofty lineage, the nursing sister and directress of the establishment, of whom Settembrini had made such utter fun, and whom thus far Hans Castorp had scarcely seen, presided over the small household. The Hofrat was otherwise alone, for his son was at the university and his daughter already married, to a lawyer in one of the French cantons. Young Behrens sometimes visited his father in the holidays; he had done so once during Joachim’s time up here. The ladies, he related, had been quite thrilled; their temperatures had gone up, petty jealousies had led to bickering and quarrels in the rest-hall and an increase of visits to Dr. Krokowski’s private office.","In his own way, Hans Castorp expressed some of these same doubts and considerations as he chatted with Joachim about the Berghof and its supervising physician; but Joachim countered that one had no way of knowing if Director Behrens was still a patient himself nowadays—presumably he had recovered long ago. It was ages now since he first began to practice here—on his own at first, quickly making a name for himself as both a specialist with a fine ear for auscultation and a surehanded lung surgeon. And then the Berghof had secured his services, and in the course of what would soon be a decade now, his life had become intimately interwoven with that of the sanatorium. His residence was back there, at the far end of the northwest wing— Dr. Krokowski lived close by. That lady of noble lineage, the head nurse of whom Settembrini had spoken so scornfully and whom Hans Castorp had seen only fleetingly a few times, was in charge of the widower’s household. The director lived alone, by the way—his son was studying at a university in imperial Germany and his daughter was already married, to a lawyer in the French part of Switzerland. Young Behrens came home on vacation now and then, and had in fact been there once already during Joachim’s stay; and he told how it had been such a thrill for the ladies of the sanatorium—temperatures rose, little jealousies erupted into spats and skirmishes in the public lounging area, and a press of patients had appeared for Dr. Krokowski’s private consultations."
"Es war nachmittags um drei Uhr. Bald nach Tische hatte er sich aufgemacht, um einen Teil der Großen Liegekur und die Vespermahlzeit zu schwänzen und vor Dunkelwerden zurück zu sein.

Er hatte etwas Schokolade in der Tasche seiner Breeches und eine kleine Flasche mit Portwein in der Westentasche.",It was three o'clock in the afternoon. Soon after dinner he had set out in order to skip part of the long rest cure and the vesper meal and be back before dark. He felt bliss at the thought that he had several hours of roaming about the great outdoors ahead of him. He had some chocolate in the pocket of his breeches and a small bottle of port in his vest pocket.,"It was three in the afternoon. He had set out soon after luncheon, with the idea of cutting part of the long rest-cure, and tea as well, in order to be back before dark. He had brought some chocolate in his breeches pocket, and a small flask of wine; and told himself exultantly that he had still several hours to revel in all this grandeur.","It was three o’clock in the afternoon. He had set out shortly after dinner, intending to cut most of the main rest cure and tea as well and still be back by nightfall.

He had some chocolate in his breeches pocket and had slipped a little bottle of port into his vest."
"»Glaub’ ich. Na?« wiederholte der Hofrat seine Aufforderung. Von sich aus fügte er hinzu: »Niedlich, was?«","""I think. Well?” repeated the Hofrat. Of his own accord he added, ""Cute, isn't it?""","“I believe you,” said the Hofrat. “Well?” he repeated his inquisition; and even added, of his own motion: “Pretty nice, what?”","“I can well believe it. And—?” the director said, pressing him again. And now he volunteered something of his own: “ Rather nice, eh?”"
"Der Humanist hatte bei seinen leisen Ermahnungen den Kopf eindringlich geschüttelt. Er schwieg mit niedergeschlagenen Augen und zusammengezogenen Brauen. Es war unmöglich, ihm scherzhaft und ausweichend zu antworten, wie Hans Castorp es zu tun gewohnt war und wie er es auch jetzt einen Augenblick als Möglichkeit erwog. Auch er stand mit gesenkten Lidern. Dann hob er die Schultern und sagte ebenso leise:","The humanist had shook his head emphatically at his soft admonitions. He said nothing, eyes downcast and brow furrowed. It was impossible to answer him jokingly and evasively, as Hans Castorp was used to doing and as he now for a moment considered it a possibility. He, too, stood with lowered lids. Then he shrugged his shoulders and said just as softly:","The humanist had uttered these admonitions in the same low voice, shaking his head impressively. He finished with drawn brows and eyes directed toward the ground. To answer him slightly or jestingly, as Hans Castorp would once have done, was out of the question. The young man weighed that possibility for a second, standing with lowered lids. Then he lifted his shoulders and spoke, no louder than Herr Settembrini: “What shall I do?”","While he whispered his warnings, the humanist shook his head urgently back and forth. He fell silent now, scowling, with eyes lowered. It was impossible to reply with a quip or some other evasion, as was Hans Castorp’s usual method—though he did weigh the possibility for just a moment. His eyes were directed at the floor, too. Lifting his shoulders, he asked just as softly, “What should I do?”"
"Wir wissen, daß er der Mathematik oblag, wissen es vom {954}Hofrat selbst und kennen auch die züchtige Triebfeder dieser Hingabe, deren kühlende, den Fleischesstachel stumpfende Wirkung wir haben preisen hören, und deren allgemeinere Nachfolge gewisse Maßregeln, die man neuerdings zu treffen sich gezwungen gesehen hatte, wahrscheinlich unnötig gemacht haben würde. Sie bestanden hauptsächlich in der Abriegelung aller Balkondurchgänge, an den nicht ganz bis zur Brüstung reichenden Milchglasscheidewänden vorbei, durch kleine Türen, die zur Nacht durch den Bademeister unter populärem Schmunzeln verschlossen wurden. Sehr gesucht waren seitdem die Zimmer im ersten Stock über der Veranda, wo man nach Übersteigung der Balustrade über das vorspringende Glasdach hin, unter Vermeidung der Türchen, von Abteil zu Abteil gelangen konnte. Des Staatsanwalts wegen aber hätte die disziplinäre Neuerung überhaupt nicht eingeführt zu werden brauchen. Die schwere Anfechtung, die von der Erscheinung jener ägyptischen Fatme auf Paravant ausgegangen, war längst überwunden, und sie war die letzte gewesen, die seinem natürlichen Teil zu schaffen gemacht. Mit verdoppelter Inbrunst hatte er sich seitdem der klaräugigen Göttin in die Arme geworfen, von deren kalmierender Macht der Hofrat so Sittliches zu sagen wußte, und das Problem, dem bei Tag und Nacht all sein Sinnen gehörte, an das er all jene Persistenz, die ganze sportliche Zähigkeit wandte, mit der er ehemals, vor seiner oft verlängerten Beurlaubung, welche in völlige Quieszierung überzugehen drohte, die Überführung armer Sünder betrieben hatte, – war kein anderes als die Quadratur des Kreises.","We know that he was in charge of mathematics, we know it from the court councilor himself and we also know the chaste driving force of this devotion, the cooling effect of which, blunting the thorn in the flesh, we have heard praised, and the more general succession of certain measures that have recently been taken had felt compelled would probably have made unnecessary. They consisted mainly in the sealing off of all balcony passages, past the frosted glass partitions that didn't quite reach the balustrade, with small doors that were locked at night by the lifeguard to a popular smile. Since then, the rooms on the first floor above the veranda, where one could climb the balustrade over the protruding glass roof and avoid the small doors, from one compartment to the next, were in great demand. For the sake of the public prosecutor, however, the disciplinary innovation need not have been introduced at all. The severe temptation that emanated from the appearance of that Egyptian Fatme on Paravant had long since been overcome, and it had been the last to trouble his natural part. Since then he had thrown himself into the arms of the clear-eyed goddess with redoubled fervor, about whose calming power the privy councilor knew such moral things to say, and the problem to which all his thoughts belonged, day and night, to which he attached all that persistence, the whole sporting tenacity with which he had formerly pursued the conviction of poor sinners before his often prolonged leave of absence, which threatened to turn into complete squeaking, - was nothing other than squaring the circle.","We know on the authority of the Hofrat that Lawyer Paravant studied mathematics; we know too the disciplinary grounds of his devotion to that branch of learning, and its virtue in cooling and dulling the edge of fleshly lusts. If the guests of the Berghof had more generally applied themselves to the same study, the necessity for certain recent rulings would most likely have been obviated. The chief of these dealt with the passage across the balconies, at the end of the white glass partitions that did not quite reach to the balustrade. These were now extended by means of little doors, which the bathing-master had it in charge to lock every night—and did so, to a general accompaniment of smirks and sniggers. Since that time, the chambers in the first storey had become popular, because they afforded a passage across the verandah roof beyond the balustrade. But this disciplinary departure had not been introduced on Lawyer Paravant’s account. He had long since overcome the severe attack caused by the presence of the Egyptian Fatme, and she had been the last to challenge his natural man. Since her time he had flung himself with redoubled conviction into the arms of the clear-eyed goddess, of whose soothing powers Hofrat Behrens had so morally discoursed. There was one problem to which day and night he devoted all his brains, all the sporting pertinacity which once—before the beginning of this prolonged and enforced holiday, that even threatened at times to end in total quiescence—had gone to the convicting of criminals. It was—the squaring of the circle.","We know that he studied mathematics—know it from the director himself—and recall the chaste motive behind his devotion to the discipline, whose cooling effects and ability to blunt the thorn in the flesh we have heard praised and whose more general rewards would probably have rendered unnecessary certain measures that the authorities had recently been forced to adopt. Chief among these had been the barricading of the passage from balcony to balcony—there where the milk-glass partitions did not quite reach the railing—with little doors that were locked at night by the bath attendant, amid general smirks and sniggers. Since then, demand had grown considerably for second-floor apartments, from where, after climbing over the railing, one could avoid the little doors and move from room to room by way of the projecting glass roof of the veranda below. These disciplinary reforms would certainly not have had to have been introduced on the prosecutor’s account. The severe temptation that had coincided with the arrival of his Egyptian Fatima had long since been overcome, was indeed the last of its sort to tax Paravant’s system. After that, he threw himself with redoubled fervor into the arms of the clear-eyed goddess, about whose soothing powers Director Behrens had so many virtuous things to say; and the problem that consumed his every thought day and night, to which he devoted all the persistence, all the sportsman’s tenacity he had once brought to the conviction of poor sinners—back in the days before his frequently extended leave of absence, which now threatened to become permanent retirement—that problem was nothing less than the squaring of the circle."
"»Mehrere sicher«, antwortete Joachim. »Aber sie werden diskret behandelt, verstehst du, man erfährt nichts davon oder nur gelegentlich, später, es geht im strengsten Geheimnis vor sich, wenn einer stirbt, aus Rücksicht auf die Patienten und namentlich auch auf die Damen, die sonst leicht Zufälle bekämen. Wenn neben dir jemand stirbt, das merkst du gar nicht. Und der Sarg wird in aller Frühe gebracht, wenn du noch schläfst, und abgeholt wird der Betreffende auch nur zu solchen Zeiten, zum Beispiel während des Essens.«","""Several for sure,"" answered Joachim. “But they are treated discreetly, you know, you don’t find out about it, or only occasionally, later, when someone dies it’s all done in the strictest of secrets, out of consideration for the patients and especially for the ladies, who would otherwise easily have coincidences. If someone dies next to you, you don't even notice. And the coffin is brought early in the morning while you are still asleep, and the person in question is only picked up at such times, for example during the meal.”","“Several, certainly,” answered Joachim. “But they are very discreetly managed, you understand; you hear nothing of them, or only by chance afterwards; everything is kept strictly private when there is a death, out of regard for the other patients, especially the ladies, who might easily get a shock. You don’t notice it, even when somebody dies next door. The coffin is brought very early in the morning, while you are asleep, and the person in question is fetched away at a suitable time too—for instance, while we are eating.”","“Several, certainly,” Joachim replied. “But they deal with them discreetly, you see, so you don’t hear about them, or only occasionally, later on. When someone dies it’s kept a strict secret, out of consideration for the other patients, in particular the ladies, who might easily go to pieces. If someone dies right next door, you don’t even notice it. The coffin is brought in early in the morning while you’re still sleeping, and then the party in question is removed only at another more suitable time—during meals, for instance.”"

"»Man kennt Sie als Schalk, Ingenieur. Ihre Art, das Gute freundschaftlich zu necken, läßt mich keineswegs an Ihrer Liebe zu ihm verzweifeln. Sie wissen selbstverständlich, daß nur diejenige Auflehnung des Geistes gegen das Natürliche ehrenhaft zu nennen ist, die die Würde und Schönheit des Menschen im Auge hat, nicht diejenige, welche, wenn sie seine Entwürdigung und Erniedrigung nicht bezweckt, sie doch jedenfalls nach sich zieht. Sie wissen auch, welche entmenschte Greuel, welche mordgierige Unduldsamkeit die Epoche, der das Artefakt da hinter mir sein Dasein verdankt, gezeitigt hat. Ich brauche Sie nur an den entsetzlichen Typ der Ketzerrichter, an die blutige Figur eines Konrad von Marburg etwa, zu erinnern und an seine infame Priesterwut gegen alles, was der Herrschaft des Übernatürlichen entgegenstand. Sie sind weit entfernt, Schwert und Scheiterhaufen als Instrumente der Menschenliebe anzuerkennen …«","“You're known as a rascal, engineer. Your way of teasing the good in a friendly way doesn't make me despair of your love for him. You know, of course, that only that rebellion of the spirit against the natural is to be called honorable which has the dignity and beauty of man in mind, not that which, if it does not aim to degrade and humiliate him, nevertheless leads to it in its wake. You also know what inhuman horrors, what murderous intolerance the epoch to which the artefact behind me owes its existence has produced. I only need to remind you of the dreadful type of heretic judge, the bloody figure of Konrad von Marburg, for example, and his infamous priestly fury against everything that opposed the rule of the supernatural. You are far from recognizing the sword and the pyre as instruments of philanthropy...""","“We all know you for a wag, Engineer: but your sly quips at the expense of the true, the good, and the beautiful will never make me doubt your fundamental love of them. You are aware, of course, that there is only one sort of revolt against nature which may be called honourable; that which revolts in the name of human beauty and human dignity. All others bring debasement and degradation in their train, even when not directed to that end. And you know, too, what inhuman atrocities, what murderous intolerance were displayed by the century to which the production behind me owes its birth. Look at that monstrous type, the inquisitor—for instance, the sanguinary figure of Conrad von Marburg—and his infamous zeal in the persecution of everything that stood in the way of supernatural domination! You are in no danger of acclaiming the sword and the stake as instruments of human benevolence!”","But when Hans Castorp blushed at this, he went on charmingly, “You are known to be a wag, my good engineer. Despite your amiable scoffing at the Good, I do not doubt in the least that you also love it. You know yourself, of course, that the only intellectual protest against nature that can be called honorable is one that keeps in mind the dignity and beauty of man and never one that, even if it does not aim at man’s degradation and debasement, nevertheless accomplishes just that. You are also aware what inhuman abominations, what bloodthirsty intolerance—without which the artifact behind me would not exist—that epoch brought forth. I need only remind you of those who persecuted heretics, dreadful inquisitors like the bloody Konrad of Marburg with his foul priestly rage against everything that resisted his heavenly rule. You, I am sure, would never approve of the sword or the stake as an instrument of brotherly love.”"
"Man war miteinander bis zum »Berghof« hinaufgegangen; dann hatten die drei, die dort wohnten, die Auswärtigen bis vor ihr Häuschen zurückbegleitet, und dort stand man noch lange im Schnee, indes Naphta und Settembrini sich stritten, – pädagogischerweise, wie Hans Castorp wohl wußte, und um die Bildsamkeit lichtsuchender Jugend zu bearbeiten. Für Herrn Ferge waren das alles viel zu hohe Dinge, wie er wiederholt zu verstehen gab, und Wehsal zeigte sich wenig beteiligt, seitdem nicht mehr von Prügeln und Folter die Rede war. Hans Castorp grub gesenkten Hauptes mit dem Stocke im Schnee und bedachte die große Konfusion.","They had walked up to the ""Berghof"" together; then the three who lived there escorted the foreigners back to their little house, and there they stood in the snow for a long time, while Naphta and Settembrini argued - pedagogically, as Hans Castorp well knew, and to work on the plasticity of light-seeking youth . For Mr. Ferge it was all far too high a point, as he repeatedly admitted, and Wehsal showed little concern since the beatings and torture were no longer mentioned. Hans Castorp dug in the snow with his head bowed and considered the great confusion.","They had got up meantime to the Berghof. Then the three who lived there walked back with the others as far as their door, where they stood about in the snow for some further while, and Settembrini and Naphta continued to dispute. It was apparent to Hans Castorp that their zeal was the zeal of the schoolmaster, bent on making an impression upon his plastic mind. Herr Ferge reiterated that it was all too much for him; while Wehsal, so soon as they had got off the themes of torture and corporal punishment, showed small interest. Hans Castorp stood with bent head and burrowed with his stick in the snow, pondering the vasty confusion of it all.","They had walked together all the way to the Berghof; and then the three who lived there accompanied the other two back to their little house, where they all stood outside in the snow for a long time while Naphta and Settembrini continued their argument—for pedagogic purposes, as Hans Castorp well knew, in order to shape the impressionable minds of youth in search of light. All these things were much too high for Herr Ferge, however, and Wehsal proved less interested once the subject was no longer flogging or torture. Hans Castorp probed the snow with his cane, hung his head, and pondered the great confusion."
"So tat er. Das großmächtige Antlitz war gelb, die Augen blickten blaß unter angezogener Stirnlineatur, der Ausdruck der zerrissenen Lippen war bitter. Sie lasen einer in des anderen Augen, der große alte und der unbedeutende junge Mann, indem der eine fortfuhr, den anderen am Handgelenk zu halten. Endlich sprach Peeperkorn leise:","So he did. The mighty face was yellow, the eyes looked pale under drawn-out forehead lines, the expression on the torn lips was bitter. They read into each other's eyes, the tall old man and the insignificant young man, each continuing to hold the other by the wrist. At last Peeperkorn spoke softly:","He did so. The great man’s face was yellow, the eyes pale beneath the forehead’s heavy folds, a bitter expression sat on the wounded lips. They looked each other in the eye, the splendid old man and the insignificant young one, and Peeperkorn continued to hold Hans Castorp by the wrist.","Which he did. The majestic countenance was yellow, with pale eyes gazing out from under the raised tracery of the brow; the expression on the ragged lips was bitter. Each read the other’s eyes—the grand old man and the insignificant young man, the former still with a grasp on the latter’s wrist. At last Peeperkorn said softly: “You were Clavdia’s lover during her previous stay here.”"
»Das Grab?«,"""The grave?""",“The grave?”,“The grave?”
"Denn hinter der Stirn waren Gedanken oder Halbgedanken, die den Bildern und Gesichten ihre zu weit gehende Süßigkeit eigentlich erst verliehen, und die sich auf Madame Chauchats Nachlässigkeit und Rücksichtslosigkeit bezogen, auf ihr Kranksein, die Steigerung und Betonung ihres Körpers durch die Krankheit, die Verkörperlichung ihres Wesens durch die Krankheit, an der er, Hans Castorp, laut ärztlichen Spruches nun teilhaben sollte. Er begriff hinter seiner Stirn die abenteuerliche Freiheit, mit der Frau Chauchat durch ihr Umblicken und Lächeln die zwischen ihnen bestehende gesellschaftliche Unbekanntschaft außer acht ließ, so, als seien sie überhaupt keine gesellschaftlichen Wesen und als sei es nicht einmal nötig, daß sie miteinander sprächen … und ebendies war es, worüber er erschrak: in demselben Sinne erschrak wie damals im Untersuchungszimmer, als er von Joachims Oberkörper eilig suchend zu seinen Augen emporgeblickt hatte, – mit dem Unterschiede, daß damals Mitleid und Sorge die Gründe seines Erschreckens gewesen, hier aber ganz anderes im Spiele war.","Because behind the forehead were thoughts or half-thoughts that really gave the pictures and visions their far-reaching sweetness, and that related to Madame Chauchat's carelessness and ruthlessness, to her being ill, the increase and emphasis on her body through illness, to embodiment of their nature through the illness in which he, Hans Castorp, according to the medical verdict, should now be a part. Behind his forehead he understood the adventurous freedom with which Mrs. Chauchat, by looking around and smiling, ignored the social unfamiliarity that existed between them, as if they were not social beings at all and as if it was not even necessary for them to speak to each other... And that was exactly what frightened him: in the same sense he was frightened in the same way as when he looked up from Joachim’s upper body to his eyes in a hurried search – with the difference that at that time pity and concern were the reasons for his fright, but here it was completely something else was at stake.","Thoughts that had to do with Madame Chauchat’s recklessness and abandon, her ailing state, the heightening and accentuation of her physical parts by disease, the corporealization, so to speak, of all her being as an effect of disease—an effect in which he, Hans Castorp, by the physician’s verdict, was now to share. He comprehended the grounds of her audacity, her total disregard in smile and glance of the fact that no social relation existed between them, that they did not even know each other; it was as though they belonged to no social system, as though it were not even necessary that they should speak to each other! Precisely this it was that frightened Hans Castorp ; for frightened he was, in the same sense as when, in the consulting-room, he had looked from Joachim’s nude body with panic-stricken searching up to his eyes—only that then the grounds of his fear had been pity and concern, whereas here something quite different was in play.","For behind his brow were the thoughts or half-thoughts that first conferred true cloying sweetness to his visions and images, thoughts that centered on Madame Chauchat’s carelessness and brazenness, on the illness that accentuated and enhanced her body, the illness that embodied her very being and that he now shared with her according to medical dictum. The realization formed behind his brow that Madame Chauchat was taking utter license with those looks and smiles, totally disregarding their not being social acquaintances—as if they were not social creatures at all, as if there were no need for them even to speak to one another. And that was what terrified him, in the same way he had been terrified that day down in the examination room, when he had rapidly shifted his searching glance from Joachim’s naked upper torso to his eyes—the difference being that it was pity and worry that had been the source of his terror then, whereas other factors were involved here."
"»Mynheer Peeperkorn! Es widersteht mir im höchsten Grade, Sie zu belügen, und ich suche nach einer Möglichkeit, das zu vermeiden. Es ist nicht leicht. Ich prahle, wenn ich Ihre Feststellung bestätige, und ich lüge, wenn ich sie leugne. Das ist so zu verstehen. Ich habe lange Zeit, sehr lange Zeit mit Clawdia – verzeihen Sie – mit Ihrer gegenwärtigen Reisebegleiterin zusammen in diesem Hause gelebt, ohne sie gesellschaftlich zu kennen. Das Gesellschaftliche schied aus in unseren Beziehungen oder in meinen Beziehungen zu ihr, von denen ich sagen will, daß ihr Ursprung im Dunklen liegt. Ich habe Clawdia in meinen Gedanken nie anders als Du genannt und auch in Wirklichkeit nie anders. Denn der Abend, an dem ich gewisse {920}pädagogische Fesseln, von denen schon kurz die Rede war, abstreifte und mich ihr näherte – unter einem Vorwand, der mir von früher her nahe lag –, war ein maskierter Abend, ein Faschingsabend, ein unverantwortlicher Abend, ein Abend des Du, in dessen Verlauf das Du auf traumhafte und unverantwortliche Weise vollen Sinn gewann. Er war aber zugleich der Vorabend von Clawdias Abreise.«","“Mynheer Peeperkorn! I am extremely reluctant to lie to you and am looking for a way to avoid it. It's not easy. I brag when I confirm your statement and lie when I deny it. That is to be understood. I have lived with Clawdia - forgive me - in this house with your present traveling companion for a long, very long time, without knowing her socially. The social was absent in our relationships or in my relationships with her, of which I would like to say that their origin is obscure. I never called Clawdia anything other than you in my mind, and never anything else in reality. Because the evening on which I shed certain {920}pedagogical chains, which I have already briefly mentioned, and approached her - under a pretext that was close to my mind from before - was a masked evening, a carnival evening, a irresponsible evening, an evening of you, in the course of which the you took on full meaning in a dreamlike and irresponsible way. But it was also the eve of Clawdia's departure.""","Hans Castorp bowed his head once more but lifted it again straightway, took a deep breath, and began: “Mynheer Peeperkorn! It is in the highest degree repugnant to me to tell you a lie. I am searching for a means of avoiding it, but this is not easy. I should be boasting if I say yes, lying if I say no. Let me explain in what sense this is to be taken. I lived a long time, oh, a very long time in this house with Clavdia— I beg pardon, with the present companion of your travels—before making her acquaintance. Our relations—or, rather, my relation to her was never the social one; I can only say of it that its beginnings are shrouded in darkness. In my thoughts I have never named Clavdia but with the thou—and never in reality either. For on the evening when, casting off certain pedagogic restraints of which we were speaking, I made bold to approach her, upon a pretext furnished me by the long-ago past, it was carnival. It was an evening of masks and freedom, an irresponsible hour, when the thou was in force, and by the power of magic and dreams, somehow had—full sway. And—it was also the eve of Clavdia’s departure.”","“Mynheer Peeperkorn,” he said, “I would find it most repugnant to lie to you, and I am seeking some way to avoid doing so. It is not easy. I would be boasting if I were to confirm your observation, and I would be lying if I were to deny it. The matter should be seen as follows. For a long time, a very long time, I lived here at the Berghof with Clavdia—excuse me—with your current traveling companion without knowing her socially. Our relationship, or my relationship to her, precluded any social element; indeed I must say its beginnings lie in darkness. In my own mind, at least, I never addressed Clavdia except by that name and with informal pronouns—or indeed in reality, either. For the evening when I cast aside certain pedagogic fetters, of which we were just speaking, and approached her—under a pretense suggested to me by a past experience—was an evening of masks and disguises. It was Mardi Gras, an irresponsible evening, an evening of first names, in the course of which, in a manner both irresponsible and dreamlike, the use of informal pronouns achieved its full meaning. It was likewise the evening before Clavdia’s departure.”"
»Selbstvers-tändlich!« sagte der Konsul. »Ich danke verbindlichst!« Und am nächsten Morgen war er verschwunden.,"""Of course!"" said the Consul. ""Thank you very much!""

"»Nein, nein,« sagte er, »bleiben wir bei den Decken! Ich werde unten schon wieder Verwendung für sie haben, und Decken hat man ja überall, es ist weiter nichts so Besonderes oder Aufregendes dabei. Aber so ein Pelzsack ist etwas gar zu Spezielles, – versteh’ mich recht, wenn ich mir einen Pelzsack {146}anschaffe, käme ich mir selber vor, als ob ich mich hier häuslich niederlassen wollte und schon gewissermaßen zu euch gehörte … Kurz, ich will nichts weiter sagen, als daß es ja absolut nicht lohnen würde, für die paar Wochen eigens einen Pelzsack zu kaufen.«","'No, no,' he said, 'let's stick to the blankets! I'll have use for them again downstairs, and blankets are everywhere, nothing else special or exciting about it. But such a fur sack is something too special - understand me correctly, if I bought a fur sack {146}, I would feel as if I wanted to settle down here and already belonged to you, so to speak... In short, me I don't want to say anything more than that it wouldn't be worth buying a fur sack for the few weeks.""","“No, no,” he said, “we’ll stop at the covers. I’ll have use for them down below, and everybody has covers; there’s nothing strange or exciting about them. But a fur sack is altogether too special—if I buy one, it is as if I were going to settle down here, as if I belonged, understand what I mean? No, for the present we’ll let it go at that; it would absolutely not be worth while to buy a sack for the few weeks I’m up here.”","“No, no,” he said, “we’ll just stick to blankets. I’ll find some use for them again down below—people have blankets everywhere. There’s nothing so special or sensational about blankets. But a fur-lined sleeping bag is much too distinctive —you see what I mean? I’d feel as if I were planning to make myself at home here for good, as if I’d become one of you, so to speak. So then, I’ll not say anything more about it, except that there would be absolutely no point in my buying a sleeping bag for just these few weeks.”"
"»Sie wollen immer alles harmlos haben, Castorp, so sind Sie. Sie sind gar nicht abgeneigt, sich auch einmal mit Nichtharmlosigkeiten einzulassen, aber dann behandeln Sie sie, als ob sie harmlos wären, und damit glauben Sie sich vor Gott und Menschen angenehm zu machen. Sie sind eine Art von Feigling und Duckmäuser, Mensch, und wenn Ihr Vetter Sie einen Zivilisten nennt, so ist das noch sehr euphemistisch ausgedrückt.«","'You always want everything harmless, Castorp, that's who you are. You are not at all averse to getting involved with non-harmful things, but then you treat them as if they were harmless, and by doing so you think you are making yourself agreeable before God and man. You're kind of a coward and a coward, man, and when your cousin calls you a civilian that's a very euphemistic way of putting it.""","“You are always for having everything harmless, Castorp—that is the nature of you. You rather like mixing in matters that are not harmless, but you treat them as though they were and think to find favour in the eyes of God and man. You’re a bit of a hypocrite, Castorp, and a bit of a coward; your cousin puts it very euphemistically when he calls you a civilian.”","“You want everything to be harmless, Castorp, that’s the sort of fellow you are. You’re not at all averse to getting involved in things that are not harmless, but then you treat them as if they were, and you think that will ingratiate you with God and man. You’re something of a coward, man, a phony, and if your cousin calls you a civilian, that’s merely a very euphemistic way of putting it.”"
"»Ich gehe ja nun auch«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Ich habe noch eine Menge Gedanken über die Zeit im Kopf, – es ist ein ganzer Komplex, kann ich wohl sagen. Aber ich will dich jetzt nicht damit aufregen, da du sowieso zuviel Striche hast. Ich werde es schon alles behalten, und wir können später darauf zurückkommen, vielleicht nach dem Frühstück. Wenn es Frühstückszeit ist, rufst du mich wohl. Ich gehe jetzt auch in die Liegekur, es tut ja nicht weh, gottlob.« Und damit ging er an der gläsernen Scheidewand vorbei in seine eigene Loge hinüber, wo gleichfalls ein Liegestuhl nebst Tischchen aufgeschlagen war, holte sich »Ocean steamships« und sein schönes, weiches, dunkelrot und grün gewürfeltes Plaid aus dem reinlich aufgeräumten Zimmer und ließ sich nieder.","""I'm going now too,"" said Hans Castorp. 'I've still got a lot of thoughts about time in my head - it's quite a complex, I daresay. But I don't want to upset you with that now, since you've got too many lines anyway. I'll keep it all and we can come back to it later, maybe after breakfast. When it's breakfast time, you'll probably call me. I'm going to the rest cure now too, it doesn't hurt, thank God."" And with that he went past the glass partition into his own box, where a deck chair and table were also set up, and got ""Ocean steamships"" and his nice one , soft, dark red and green checked plaid out of the clean, tidy room and sat down.","“I’ll go now,” said Hans Castorp. “I’ve still a great many ideas in my head about the time—a whole complex, if I may say so. But I won’t excite you with them now , you’ve too many degrees as it is. I’ll keep them all and return to them later, perhaps after breakfast. You will call me when it is time, I suppose. I’ll go now and lie down; it won’t hurt me, thank goodness.” With which he passed round the glass partition into his loggia, where stood his own reclining-chair and side-table. He fetched Ocean Steamships and his beautiful, soft, dark-red and green plaid from within the room, which had already been put into perfect order, and sat himself down.","“And I’ll go now,” Hans Castorp said. “My head is full of all kinds of ideas about time—a whole complex of thoughts, let me tell you. But I don’t want to get you worked up over them, not when your temperature’s already too high. I’ll keep it all in mind, and we can talk about it later then, after second breakfast perhaps. You will call me when it’s time to eat? I’ll go take my rest cure now, too —it can’t hurt, thank goodness.” And with that he slipped past the glass divider across to his own balcony, where someone had placed an unfolded lounge chair and a table. He fetched his Ocean Steamships and his traveling blanket, a lovely plaid of dark reds and greens, and noticed that his room had been nicely tidied up. And now he stretched out."
"Aber was bedeutete all dieses Unwissen im Vergleich mit der Ratlosigkeit, in der man vor Erscheinungen wie der des Gedächtnisses oder jenes weiteren und erstaunlicheren Gedächtnisses stand, das die Vererbung erworbener Eigenschaften hieß? Die Unmöglichkeit, auch nur die Ahnung einer mechanischen Erklärbarkeit solcher Leistungen der Zellsubstanz zu fassen, war vollkommen. Der Samenfaden, der zahllose und verwickelte Art- und Individualeigenschaften des Vaters auf das Ei übertrug, war nur mikroskopisch sichtbar, und auch die stärkste Vergrößerung reichte nicht hin, ihn anders denn als homogenen Körper erscheinen zu lassen und die Bestimmung seiner Abkunft zu ermöglichen; denn bei einem Tier sah er aus wie beim anderen. Das waren Organisationsverhältnisse, die zu der Annahme zwangen, daß es sich mit der Zelle nicht anders verhielt als mit dem höheren Leib, den sie aufbaute; daß also auch sie schon ein übergeordneter Organismus war, der sei{428}nerseits und wiederum sich aus lebenden Teilungskörpern, individuellen Lebenseinheiten zusammensetzte. Man schritt also vom angeblich Kleinsten zum abermals Kleineren vor, man löste notgedrungen das Elementare in Unterelemente auf. Kein Zweifel, wie das Tierreich aus verschiedenen Spezies von Tieren, wie der tierisch-menschliche Organismus aus einem ganzen Tierreich von Zellenspezies, so bestand derjenige der Zelle aus einem neuen und vielfältigen Tierreich elementarer Lebenseinheiten, deren Größe tief unter der Grenze des mikroskopisch Sichtbaren lag, die selbsttätig wuchsen, selbsttätig, nach dem Gesetz, daß jede nur ihresgleichen hervorbringen konnte, sich vermehrten und nach dem Grundsatz der Arbeitsteilung gemeinsam der nächsthöheren Lebensordnung dienten.","But what was all this ignorance compared with the perplexity one faced in the face of phenomena like memory, or that wider and more amazing memory called the inheritance of acquired traits? The impossibility of grasping even the faintest idea that such achievements of the cell substance could be mechanically explained was complete. The seminal thread, which transmitted innumerable and intricate species and individual characteristics of the father to the egg, was visible only under the microscope, and even the highest magnification was not sufficient to make it appear anything but a homogeneous body and to enable its parentage to be determined; for in one animal it looked like in another. These were organizational conditions which forced the assumption that the cell was no different from the higher body it was building; that it was also a superordinate organism, which in turn was made up of living parts, individual life units. So one progressed from the supposedly smallest to the smaller again, one was forced to break down the elementary into sub-elements. No doubt, as the animal kingdom consisted of different species of animals, like the animal-human organism consisted of a whole animal kingdom of cellular species, so that of the cell consisted of a new and varied animal kingdom of elementary life-units, the size of which was well below the limit of the microscopically visible, which grew automatically, automatically, according to the law that each could only produce its own kind, multiplied and, according to the principle of the division of labour, together served the next higher order of life.","But what was all this ignorance, compared with our utter helplessness in the presence of such a phenomenon as memory, or of that other more prolonged and astounding memory which we called the inheritance of acquired characteristics? Out of the question to get even a glimpse of any mechanical possibility of explication of such performances on the part of the cell-substance. The spermatozoon that conveyed to the egg countless complicated individual and racial characteristics of the father was visible only through a microscope; even the most powerful magnification was not enough to show it as other than a homogeneous body, or to determine its origin; it looked the same in one animal as in another. These factors forced one to the assumption that the cell was in the same case as with the higher form it went to build up: that it too was already a higher form, composed in its turn by the division of living bodies, individual living units. Thus one passed from the supposed smallest unit to a still smaller one; one was driven to separate the elementary into its elements. No doubt at all but just as the animal kingdom was composed of various species of animals, as the human-animal organism was composed of a whole animal kingdom of cell species, so the cell organism was composed of a new and varied animal kingdom of elementary units, far below microscopic size, which grew spontaneously, increased spontaneously according to the law that each could bring forth only after its kind, and, acting on the principle of a division of labour, served together the next higher order of existence.","But even so, what was such ignorance in comparison with our confusion when confronted by phenomena like memory—or the even more astounding extended memory that allowed acquired characteristics to be inherited? Anything like a mechanical explanation for these achievements of protoplasm was completely out of the question. Sperm, which transferred the countless, complicated individual and racial characteristics of the father to the egg, was visible only under a microscope; and even the most powerful magnification did not suffice to determine its genesis or allow it to be seen as anything but a homogeneous body—for the sperm of one animal looked like that of every other. Such structural factors forced one to assume that a single cell was no different from the higher life-form of which it was a building block, that it, too, was a higher organism, yet another composite made up of discrete units of life, individual living entities. One progressed from the ostensibly smallest unit to something smaller still, one was compelled to split something elemental into yet more basic elements. No doubt just as the animal kingdom consisted of various species of animals, just as the organism of the human animal consisted of a whole animal kingdom of cell species, so, too, the cell consisted of a new and diverse animal kingdom of elemental, submicroscopic living entities that grew independently, multiplied independently according to the law that each can only produce its own kind, and cooperated by division of labor to serve the next higher level of life."
"Es war nicht ganz zu vermeiden, daß Hans Castorp in das dem seinen so nahe Gesicht des eng von ihm gefesselten jungfräulichen Wunderkindes blickte. Ihre Augen begegneten sich, aber Ellys glitten ab und nieder, zum Zeichen einer Schamhaftigkeit, die nach Lage der Dinge wohl begreiflich war, und sie lächelte dazu ein wenig geziert, mit schrägem Kopfe und leicht gespitzten Lippen, wie neulich bei der Glasséance. Übrigens flog noch eine andere und weitläufigere Erinnerung ihren Aufseher an bei dieser stillen Ziererei. So ungefähr, fiel ihm ein, hatte Karen Karstedt gelächelt, als er mit Joachim und ihr an der noch unaufgemachten Bettstatt des Friedhofs von »Dorf« gestanden hatte …","It was unavoidable that Hans Castorp looked into the face of the virgin child prodigy who was so tightly bound by him. Their eyes met, but Elly's slid down and down, in a sign of a modesty that was understandable given the state of things, and she smiled a little prettily, with tilted head and slightly pursed lips, like the other day at the Glasséance. Incidentally, another and more distant memory flew to her keeper at this quiet fuss. It occurred to him that Karen Karstedt had smiled more or less as he stood with Joachim and her at the still unopened bed in the cemetery of ""Dorf"" ...","Unavoidable that Hans Castorp should look into the face of the young prodigy, fixed as it was so immediately before his own. Their eyes met—but Elly’s slipped aside and gazed with natural self-consciousness in her lap. She was smiling a little affectedly, with her lips slightly pursed, and her head on one side, as she had at the wineglass seance. And Hans Castorp was reminded, as he saw her, of something else: the look on Karen Karstedt’s face, a smile just like that, when she stood with Joachim and himself and regarded the unmade grave in the Dorf graveyard.","Hans Castorp could not avoid staring now and then straight into the face of the virginal child prodigy confined directly in front of him. Their eyes met, but Elly’s slid down and off to one side in token of a modesty that was quite understandable given the situation; and she offered a little affected smile as well, tilting her head and pursing her lips slightly, just as she had recently at the séance with the glass. As a matter of fact, the sight of this demure affectation aroused another, more distant memory in her monitor—it reminded him more or less of the way Karen Karstedt had smiled as she had stood with him and Joachim beside her still-undug grave in the Dorf cemetery."
"»Nun wollen wir wenigstens hoffen,« sagte Joachim, »daß du dich erholt hast bei uns und die Erfrischung spürst, wenn du hinunterkommst.«","""Now let's at least hope,"" said Joachim, ""that you have recovered with us and that you will feel refreshed when you come downstairs.""","“At least.” Joachim said more than once in these days, “let us hope it has done you good to be up here, and that you will feel the benefit when you are at home again.”","“Well, at least we can hope,” Joachim said, “that you’ve recuperated here with us and will feel refreshed once you’re back down.”"

"{731}Wirklich war er schon stark mitgenommen und bekämpfte die beginnende Unklarheit seines Sensoriums auf unklare und fieberhafte Art. Er erschrak nicht so, wie er gesunderweise hätte erschrecken sollen, als er gewahrte, daß er schon wieder von der ebenen Bahn abgekommen war: diesmal offenbar nach der anderen Seite, dorthin, wo die Halde sich senkte. Denn er fuhr ab, bei schrägem Gegenwinde, und obgleich er das vorderhand nicht hätte tun dürfen, war es für den Augenblick das Bequemste. »Schon recht«, dachte er. »Weiter unten werde ich wieder Richtung nehmen.« Und das tat er oder glaubte es zu tun, oder glaubte es auch selber nicht recht, oder, noch bedenklicher, es fing an, ihm gleichgültig zu werden, ob er es tat oder nicht. So wirkten die zweideutigen Ausfälle, die er nur matt bekämpfte. Jene Mischung aus Müdigkeit und Aufregung, die den vertrauten Dauerzustand eines Gastes bildete, dessen Akklimatisation in der Gewöhnung daran bestand, daß er sich nicht gewöhnte, hatte sich in ihren beiden Bestandteilen so weit verstärkt, daß von einem besonnenen Verhalten gegen die Ausfälle nicht mehr die Rede sein konnte. Benommen und taumelig, zitterte er vor Trunkenheit und Exzitation, sehr ähnlich wie nach einem Kolloquium mit Naphta und Settembrini, nur ungleich stärker; und so mochte es kommen, daß er seine Trägheit im Bekämpfen der narkotischen Ausfälle mit betrunkenen Reminiszenzen an solche Erörterungen beschönigte, – trotz seiner verächterischen Empörung gegen das Zugedecktwerden durch hexagonale Regelmäßigkeit etwas in sich hineinfaselte, des Sinnes oder Unsinnes: das Pflichtgefühl, das ihn anhalten wolle, die verdächtigen Herabminderungen zu bekämpfen, sei nichts als bloße Ethik, das heiße schäbige Lebensbürgerlichkeit und irreligiöse Philisterei. Wunsch und Versuchung, sich niederzulegen und zu ruhen, beschlichen in der Gestalt seinen Sinn, daß er sich sagte, es sei wie bei einem Sandsturm in der Wüste, der die Araber veranlasse, sich aufs {732}Gesicht zu werfen und den Burnus über den Kopf zu ziehen. Nur eben den Umstand, daß er keinen Burnus habe und daß man eine wollene Weste nicht recht über den Kopf ziehen könne, empfand er als Einwand gegen ein solches Verhalten, obgleich er kein Kind war und aus mancherlei Überlieferung ziemlich genau Bescheid wußte, wie man erfriert.","{731}He was already badly affected and fought the beginning vagueness of his sensorium in a vague and feverish way. He was not frightened in the way he should have been in good health when he realized that he had again strayed from the level path: this time apparently to the other side, to where the heap lowered. Because he was leaving against a slanting headwind, and although he shouldn't have done so for the time being, it was most convenient for the moment. ""That's right,"" he thought. ""I'll take my direction further down."" And he did, or thought he was doing it, or didn't really believe it himself, or, more worryingly, he was beginning to care less whether he was doing it or not. This is how the ambiguous failures, which he fought only weakly, looked like. That mixture of tiredness and excitement, which formed the familiar permanent state of a guest whose acclimatization consisted in getting used to the fact that he did not get used to it, had intensified in both of its components to such an extent that a level-headed attitude towards the failures was no longer the speech could be. Dazed and dizzy, he trembled with drunkenness and excitement, very much like after a colloquium with Naphta and Settembrini, only much more so; and so it might come about that he embellished his inertia in combating the narcotic failures with drunken reminiscences of such discussions--in spite of his contemptuous indignation at being covered up by hexagonal regularity, babbled something to himself, sense or nonsense: the sense of duty that kept him Wanting to combat the suspected degradations is nothing but mere ethics, which means shabby middle-class life and irreligious philistinism. Desire and temptation to lie down and rest crept into his mind in such a way that he told himself it was like a sandstorm in the desert causing the Arabs to throw themselves on their faces and put their burnoos on their faces pulling head. The only objection to such behavior was the fact that he didn't have a burnous and that you couldn't really pull a woolen waistcoat over your head, although he wasn't a child and, from various sources, knew pretty well how you freeze to death .","In truth, he was already affected, and his struggle against oncoming sensory confusion was feverish and abnormal. He should have been more alarmed on discovering that he had already declined from the level course—this time apparently on the other slope. For he had pushed off with the wind coming slantwise at him, which was ill-advised, though more convenient for the moment. “Never mind,” he thought, “I’ll get my direction again down below.” Which he did, or thought he did— or, truth to tell, scarcely even thought so; worst of all, began to be indifferent whether he had done or no. Such was the effect of an insidious double attack, which he but weakly combated. Fatigue and excitement combined were a familiar state to our young man—whose acclimatization, as we know, still consisted in getting used to not getting used; and both fatigue and excitement were now present in such strength as to make impossible any thought of asserting his reason against them. He felt as often after a colloquy with Settembrini and Naphta, only to a far greater degree: dazed and tipsy, giddy, a-tremble with excitement. This was probably why he began to colour his lack of resistance to the stealing narcosis with half-maudlin references to the latest-aired complex of theories. Despite his scornful repudiation of the idea that he might lie down and be covered up with hexagonal symmetricality, something within him maundered on, sense or no sense: told him that the feeling of duty which bade him fight against insidious sensory appeasements was a purely ethical reaction, representing the sordid bourgeois view of life, irreligion, Philistinism; while the desire, nay, craving, to lie down and rest, whispered him in the guise of a comparison between this storm and a sand-storm on the desert, before which the Arab flings himself down and draws his burnous over his head. Only his lack of a burnous, the unfeasibility of drawing his woollen waistcoat over his head, prevented him from following suit— this although he was no longer a child, and pretty well aware of the conditions under which a man freezes to death.","In reality he was already badly battered, and was struggling against his incipient sensory muddle—but in a muddled and feverish way. And when he discovered that once again he had left the level stretch much too soon, this time on the other side, it seemed, where the slope fell away, he was not as frightened as he would have been in a healthy state. For with the wind coming at him on a slant, he had set off downhill again, which he ought not to have done now—but that seemed easiest at the moment. “It’s all right,” he thought, “I’ll get my bearings again once I’m down there.” Which is what he did, or so he thought, or perhaps he was not really sure—or, what was more ominous, began not to care whether he did or not. All this came from those ambiguous attacks, which he fought off only feebly now. The familiar blend of languor and excitement—which was the constant condition of a Berghof guest whose acclimatization consisted of his getting used to not getting used to things—had grown so strong in both component parts that it was no longer even a question of his taking prudent action against such attacks. Dazed and giddy, he quivered with exhilaration, just as he often did after a colloquy with Naphta and Settembrini, except this time the feeling was incomparably stronger—which may have been how he came to excuse his own inertia in fighting off such attacks of self-narcosis by reminiscing drunkenly about their discussions. And so despite his disdain and outrage at the idea of being covered up by hexagonal symmetry, he began to babble away to himself, be it sense or nonsense: this feeling of duty that kept telling him to fight off any suspicious diminishing of his senses—it was mere ethics, just a shabby bourgeoisiosity of life, philistine irreligiosity. The desire, the temptation, to lie down and rest crept into his mind disguised as the notion that in desert sandstorms an Arab threw himself on his face and covered his head with his burnous. The only objection he could find to following that example was that he had no burnous and could not very easily pull his woolen vest up over his head—although he was certainly no child and knew from several sources pretty much how people froze to death."
"»Gegensätze,« sagte Naphta, »mögen sich reimen. Ungereimt ist nur das Halbe und Mediokre. Ihr Individualismus, wie ich mir schon anzumerken erlaubte, ist eine Halbheit, ein Zugeständnis. Er korrigiert Ihre heidnische Staatssittlichkeit durch ein wenig Christentum, ein wenig ›Recht des Individuums‹, ein wenig sogenannte Freiheit, das ist alles. Ein Individualismus dagegen, der von der kosmischen, der astrologischen Wichtig{610}keit der Einzelseele ausgeht, ein nicht sozialer, sondern religiöser Individualismus, der das Menschliche nicht als Widerstreit von Ich und Gesellschaft, sondern als den von Ich und Gott, von Fleisch und Geist erlebt, – ein solcher, eigentlicher Individualismus verträgt sich mit bindungsvollster Gemeinschaft recht wohl …«","'Opposites,' said Naphta, 'may rhyme. Only half and mediocre is inconsistent. Your individualism, as I have already pointed out, is half-hearted, a concession. He corrects your pagan state morality with a little Christianity, a little 'rights of the individual', a little so-called liberty, that's all. An individualism, on the other hand, which starts from the cosmic, astrological importance of the individual soul, a not social, but religious individualism, which does not see the human as a conflict between ego and society, but as that of ego and God, of flesh and Spirit experienced, - such a real individualism goes well with the most binding community...""","“Opposites,” said Naphta, “may be consistent with each other. It is the middling, the neither-one-thing-nor-the-other that is preposterous. Your individualism, as I have already taken the liberty of remarking, is defective. It is a confession of weakness. It corrects its pagan State morality by the admixture of a little Christianity, a little ‘rights of man,’ a little so-called liberty—but that is all. An individualism that springs from the cosmic, the astrological importance of the individual soul, an individualism not social but religious, that conceives of humanity not as a conflict between the ego and society, but as a conflict between the ego and God, between the flesh and the spirit—a genuine individualism like that sorts very well with the most binding communism.”","“Opposites,” Naphta said, “may very well be reconciled. But what is mediocre and makeshift will never be. Your individualism, as I made bold to remark before, is a makeshift thing, a series of concessions. It corrects your heathen state morality with a little Christianity, a little ‘individual rights,’ a little so-called freedom, that is all. Whereas an individualism that proceeds from the cosmic, astrological importance of the individual soul, an individualism that is not social, but religious, that experiences its humanity not as a contradiction between self and society, but between self and God, between flesh and Spirit—such a genuine individualism can be reconciled very nicely with a community rich in ties of commitment and obligation.”"
"»Ja, so kann man sagen. Aber neulich, es ist nun, warte mal, möglicherweise acht Wochen her –«","“Yes, you can say that. But the other day, it's been, wait a minute, maybe eight weeks -""","“Yes—for the most part.

"Es war also 4 Uhr, wenn der Assistent wieder auf den Balkon zurücktrat, – das heißt tiefer Nachmittag! Plötzlich und eh mans gedacht, war es tiefer Nachmittag, – der sich übrigens ungesäumt ins annähernd Abendliche vertiefte: denn bis der Tee getrunken war, drunten im Saal und auf Nummer 34, ging es stärkstens auf 5 Uhr und, bis Joachim von seinem dritten Dienstgange zurückkehrte und bei seinem Vetter wieder vorsprach, immerhin so stark auf 6, daß sich die Liegekur bis zum Abendessen, wenn man nur ein wenig rund rechnete, wieder auf eine Stunde beschränkte, – eine spielend aus dem Felde zu schlagende Zeitgegnerschaft, wenn man Gedanken im Kopf und außerdem einen ganzen orbis pictus auf dem Nachttische hat.","So it was 4 o'clock when the assistant stepped back onto the balcony - that means deep in the afternoon! Suddenly, and before you thought it, it was late afternoon – which incidentally deepened almost immediately into evening: because by the time tea was drunk, down in the hall and at number 34, it was getting to 5 a.m. and by the time Joachim left his third round of work returned and called on his cousin again, at least so much to 6 that the rest cure until dinner, if you just calculated a little, was again limited to an hour - a time opponent that can easily be beaten out of the field, if you think in the head and also has a whole orbis pictus on the bedside table.","The Assistant would return along the balconies at four o’clock or thereabouts, that is to say mid-afternoon. Yes, thus suddenly, before one realized it, there one was, in the very deep of the afternoon, and steadily still deepening on toward twilight. Before tea was finished drinking, up above and down below, it was well on the way toward five o’clock; and by the time Joachim returned from his third daily round and looked in on his cousin, it would be near enough to six to reduce the remaining rest period to no more than a single hour—reckoned always in round numbers. It was an easy matter to kill that much time, if one had ideas in one’s head, and a whole orbis pictus on the table to boot.","And so by the time the assistant stepped back out onto the balcony, it was four o’clock—which meant late, late afternoon. Suddenly and before you even realized it, it was late afternoon, which would deepen now seamlessly into oncoming evening. And by the time tea had been taken, both in the dining room below and in room 34, it was very close to five o’clock; and by the time Joachim had returned from his third obligatory walk and had dropped in on his cousin again , it was so close to six o’clock that, once you rounded it off a little, the time left in the rest cure until supper was reduced to just one hour—and it was child’s play to drive such paltry forces of opposing time from the field of battle, particularly if you had thoughts in your head and an orbis pictus on the nightstand."
"Sie war nahezu hübsch, hatte klare, etwas zu ausgeprägte, aber angenehme Züge und ein kleines Doppelkinn. Aber ihre Lippen waren bläulich, und auch die Nasenspitze wies diese Tönung auf, zweifellos infolge Luftmangels.

Ihr Hals war mädchenhaft, mit »Salzfässern« über den zarten Schlüsselbeinen, und auch die Brust, unter dem Linnen von Gelächter und Atemnot in unruhig knapper und ringender Bewegung gehalten, schien zart und jung. Hans Castorp beschloß, auch ihr schöne Blumen zu schicken oder zu bringen, aus den Export{465}gärtnereien von Nizza und Cannes, besprengte und duftende.

"{882}»Soll geschehen, Herr Settembrini. Soll absolut geschehen. Nein, Sie sehen mich gar nicht auf der Jagd nach Paradoxen mit meinem mot. Es war mir nur darum zu tun, auf die gro- ßen Schwierigkeiten hinzuweisen, die die Bestimmung von ›Dummheit‹ und ›Gescheitheit‹ … bereitet. Also: bereitet, nicht wahr? Das ist so schwer auseinander zu halten, das geht so sehr ineinander über … Ich weiß wohl, Sie hassen das mystische guazzabuglio und sind für den Wert, das Urteil, das Werturteil, und da gebe ich Ihnen ganz recht. Aber das mit der ›Dummheit‹ und der ›Gescheitheit‹, das ist zuweilen ein komplettes Mysterium, und es muß doch erlaubt sein, sich um Mysterien zu kümmern, vorausgesetzt, daß das ehrliche Bestreben vorhanden ist, ihnen nach Möglichkeit auf den Grund zu kommen. Ich frage Sie folgendes. Ich frage Sie: Können Sie leugnen, daß er uns alle in die Tasche steckt? Ich drücke es derb aus, und doch können Sie es, soviel ich sehe, nicht leugnen. Er steckt uns in die Tasche, und irgendwoher kommt ihm das Recht zu, sich über uns lustig zu machen. Woher? Wieso? Inwiefern? Natürlich nicht vermöge seiner Gescheitheit. Ich gebe zu, daß von Gescheitheit kaum die Rede sein kann. Er ist ja vielmehr ein Mann der Undeutlichkeit und des Gefühls, das Gefühl ist geradezu seine Puschel, – verzeihen Sie den umgangssprachlichen Ausdruck! Ich sage also: Nicht vor Gescheitheit steckt er uns in die Tasche, das heißt nicht aus geistigen Gründen, – Sie würden sich das verbitten, und wirklich, es scheidet aus. Aber doch auch nicht aus körperlichen! Doch nicht seiner Kapitänsschultern wegen, in Hinsicht auf rohe Brachialgewalt und weil er jeden von uns mit der Faust niederstrecken könnte, – er denkt gar nicht daran, daß er das könnte, und wenn er mal daran denkt, so genügen ein paar zivilisierte Worte, um ihn zu beschwichtigen … Also auch nicht aus körperlichen. Und doch spielt ganz ohne Zweifel das Körperliche eine Rolle dabei, – nicht im brachialen Sinne, son{883}dern in einem andern, im mystischen, – sobald das Körperliche eine Rolle spielt, wird die Sache mystisch –; und das Körperliche geht ins Geistige über, und umgekehrt, und sind nicht zu unterscheiden, und Dummheit und Gescheitheit sind nicht zu unterscheiden, aber die Wirkung ist da, das Dynamische, und wir werden in die Tasche gesteckt. Und dafür ist uns nur ein Wort an die Hand gegeben, und das heißt ›Persönlichkeit‹. Man braucht es wohl auch vernünftigerweise, so, wie wir alle Persönlichkeiten sind, – moralische und juristische und was noch für Persönlichkeiten. Aber nicht so ist es hier gemeint. Sondern als ein Mysterium, das über Dummheit und Gescheitheit hinausliegt, und um das man sich doch muß kümmern dürfen, – teils um ihm nach Möglichkeit auf den Grund zu kommen und teils, soweit das nicht möglich ist, um sich daran zu erbauen. Und wenn Sie für Werte sind, so ist die Persönlichkeit am Ende doch auch ein positiver Wert, sollte ich denken, – positiver als Dummheit und Gescheitheit, im höchsten Grade positiv, absolut positiv, wie das Leben, kurzum: ein Lebenswert und ganz danach angetan, sich angelegentlich darum zu kümmern. Das meinte ich Ihnen erwidern zu sollen auf das, was Sie von Dummheit sagten.«","{882}""It shall be done, Mr. Settembrini. Should absolutely happen. No, you don't see me hunting for paradoxes with my mot at all. I was only interested in pointing out the great difficulties that the determination of 'stupidity' and 'cleverness' ... causes. So: ready, right? It's so hard to tell apart, it's so intertwined... I know you hate the mystical guazzabuglio and you're for value, judgment, value judgement, and I totally agree with you. But the thing about ""stupidity"" and ""cleverness"" is sometimes a complete mystery, and it must be permissible to bother with mysteries provided there is an honest effort to get to the bottom of them if possible . I ask you the following. I ask you: can you deny that he is putting all of us in his pockets? I put it bluntly, and yet, as far as I can see, you cannot deny it. He's pocketing us, and somewhere he's got the right to make fun of us. Where from? How so? In what way? Not because of his cleverness, of course. I admit that one can hardly speak of cleverness. Rather, he is a man of indistinctness and feeling, the feeling is almost his pom poms - pardon the colloquial expression! So I say: He doesn't put us in his pocket because of his cleverness, that means not for intellectual reasons - you wouldn't want that, and really, it's out of the question. But not for physical reasons either! But not because of his captain's shoulders, in terms of brute force, and because he could punch any one of us down--he doesn't even think he could, and when he does think a few civilized words will suffice to appease him… So not for physical reasons either. And yet, quite without a doubt, the physical plays a part in it - not in the brute sense, but in another, in the mystical sense - as soon as the physical plays a part, the thing becomes mystical -; and the physical goes into the mental, and vice versa, and are indistinguishable and stupid and clever are indistinguishable, but the effect is there, the dynamic, and we get pocketed. And we've only been given one word for that, and that's 'personality'. It is probably also needed in a reasonable way, just as we are all personalities - moral and legal and what other personalities. But that is not what is meant here. But as a mystery that is beyond stupidity and cleverness, and which one must be allowed to concern oneself with, partly in order to get to the bottom of it if possible and partly, insofar as that is not possible, in order to edify oneself. And if you're for values, personality is a positive value after all, I should think - more positive than stupidity and cleverness, positive in the highest degree, absolutely positive, like life, in short: a value in life and all about it to take care of it properly. That's what I thought I should say in reply to what you said about stupidity.""","“I won’t indeed, Herr Settembrini. I certainly will not. No, my mot was not in the nature of paradox, I assure you. I only meant to indicate the difficulty I really find in distinguishing between stupidity and cleverness. It is so hard to draw a line—one goes over into the other.—I know you hate all that mystical guazzabuglio ; you are all for values, judgment, and judgment of values; and I’m sure you are right. But this about stupidity and—on my honour, it’s a complete mystery; and after all, it is allowable to think about mysteries, isn’t it, so long as one is honestly bent on getting to the bottom of them? But I ask you. Can you deny that he puts us all in his pocket? That’s expressing it crudely, perhaps—but, so far as I can see, you can’t deny it. He puts us all in his pocket; somehow or other, he has the right to laugh at us all—but where does he get it? Where does it come from? How does he do it? Certainly it’s not that he’s so clever. I admit that you can’t talk about his cleverness. He’s inarticulate—it’s more feeling with him, feeling is just his mark, if you’ll excuse my language. No, as I say, it’s not out of cleverness, not on intellectual grounds at all, that he can do as he likes with us. You would be right to deny it. It isn’t the point. But not on physical either. It’s not the massive shoulders, or the strength of his biceps; not because he could knock us down if he liked. He isn’t conscious of his power; if he does take a notion, he can easily be put off it with a couple of civilized words.—So it is not physical. And yet the physical has something to do with it; not in a muscular sense— it’s something quite different, mystical; because so soon as the physical has anything to do with it, it becomes mystical, the physical goes over into the spiritual, and the other way on, and you can’t tell them apart, nor can you cleverness and stupidity. But the result is what we see, the dynamic effect—he puts us in his pocket. We’ve only one word for that—personality. We use it in another, more regular sense too, in which we are all personalities—morally, legally, and otherwise. But that is not the sense in which I am using it now. I am speaking of the mystery of personality, something above either cleverness or stupidity, and something we all have to take into account: partly to try to understand it; but partly, where that is not possible, to be edified by it. You are all for values; but isn’t personality a value too? It seems so to me, more so than either cleverness or stupidity, it seems positive and absolute, like life—in short, something quite worth while, and calculated to make us trouble about it. That’s what I wanted to say in answer to what you said about stupidity.”","“It shall be done, Herr Settembrini. Absolutely—shall be done. No, in this bon mot of mine, you do not see me in hot pursuit of paradoxes. I was merely trying to point out the great difficulty one has in defining ‘stupidity’ and ‘cleverness.’ It is so hard to keep them separate, they are so intertwined. I know very well how you hate any sort of mystical guazzabuglio and are a man who believes in values and judgments—value judgments—and I quite agree with you. But the issue of ‘stupidity’ and ‘cleverness’ is at times a complete mystery, and it must be permissible to concern oneself with mysteries, always presuming it is an honest attempt to get to the bottom of them, if possible. Let me ask you this question: Can you deny that he has us all in his pocket? I’m putting it crudely, and yet, as nearly as I can tell, you cannot deny it. He puts us in his pocket, and somehow or other he has the right to make fun of us all. But why? And how? And where does it come from? It is certainly not a matter of his cleverness. One can hardly speak of cleverness in this case, I admit. He is much more a man of fuzziness and feelings, feelings are his cup of tea, so to speak—if you’ll forgive me the colloquial phrase. What I am saying is this: it is not by way of cleverness that he puts us in his pocket, not through intellectual prowess. You wouldn’t stand for that. And it really is out of the question. But surely it is not physical prowess, either! It cannot be because of his broad captain’s shoulders, or any raw brute force, or because he could lay any one of us flat with his fist—it would never occur to him that he could, and if it did, why, a few civilized words would calm him down. And so it’s not physical, either. And yet the physical dimension does play a role, without a doubt—not in the sense of brute strength, but in another, more mystical sense—the moment anything physical plays a role, things always get mystical. And the physical merges into the intellectual, and vice versa, and cannot be differentiated, and stupidity and cleverness cannot be differentiated. But the effect is there, the dynamic effect, and we find ourselves stuck in his pocket. And for that we have only one word at hand, and that word is ‘personality.’ We use the word in another, perfectly reasonable sense, too: we are all personalities—moral and legal and all those other sorts of personalities. But that is not what I mean. I’m talking about a mystery that extends beyond stupidity and cleverness, and that is what we need to concern ourselves with—partly to get to the bottom of it, if possible, and partly, to the extent that it is not possible, to edify ourselves. And if you are for values, then, in the end, personality is a positive value, too, I should think—a more positive value than stupidity or cleverness, positive in the highest degree, absolutely positive, like life itself—in short, a value for life and in that sense suitable for our earnest consideration. And that’s how I thought I should respond to what you said about stupidity.”"
"{282}»Erlaube mir!« sagte Hans Castorp, immer die Hände unter dem Kopf. »Was machst denn du dir für Kopfzerbrechen? Das ist doch Unsinn. Bin ich heraufgekommen, um dich zu besuchen? Auch; aber in erster Linie doch schließlich, um mich zu erholen, auf Vorschrift von Heidekind. Na, und nun zeigt sich eben, daß ich erholungsbedürftiger bin, als er und wir alle uns haben träumen lassen. Ich bin ja wohl nicht der erste, der glaubte, hier eine Stippvisite zu machen, und für den es dann anders kam. Denke doch nur zum Beispiel an Tous les deux’ zweiten Sohn, und wie es den hier denn doch noch ganz anders getroffen hat, – ich weiß nicht, ob er noch lebt, vielleicht haben sie ihn abgeholt während einer Mahlzeit. Daß ich etwas krank bin, ist mir ja eine Überraschung, ich muß mich erst darein finden, mich hier als Patient und richtig als einer von euch zu fühlen, statt, wie bisher, nur als Gast. Und dann überrascht es mich doch auch wieder fast gar nicht, denn so recht prachtvoll instand habe ich mich eigentlich niemals gefühlt, und wenn ich denke, wie früh meine beiden Eltern gestorben sind, – woher sollte die Pracht denn schließlich auch kommen! Daß du einen kleinen Knacks hast, nicht wahr, wenn er nun auch so gut wie kuriert ist, darüber machen wir uns ja alle nichts vor, und also kann es ja sein, daß es ein bißchen in unsrer Familie liegt, Behrens wenigstens machte so eine Bemerkung. Jedenfalls liege ich hier schon seit gestern und überlege mir, wie mir doch eigentlich immer zumute war und wie ich mich zu dem Ganzen verhielt, zum Leben, weißt du, und seinen Anforderungen. Ein gewisser Ernst und eine gewisse Abneigung gegen robustes und lautes Wesen lag immer in meiner Natur, – wir sprachen noch neulich davon, und daß ich manchmal fast Lust gehabt hätte, geistlich zu werden, aus Interesse für traurige und erbauliche Dinge, – so ein schwarzes Tuch, weißt du, mit einem silbernen Kreuz darauf oder R. I. P. … Requiescat in pace … das ist eigentlich das schönste Wort und mir viel sympathischer {283}als ›Hoch soll er leben‹, was doch mehr ein Radau ist. Das alles, denke ich mir, kommt wohl daher, daß ich selbst einen Knacks habe und mich von Anfang an auf die Krankheit verstehe, – es zeigt sich bei dieser Gelegenheit. Aber wenn es sich nun doch so verhält, so kann ich ja von Glück sagen, daß ich heraufgekommen bin und mich habe untersuchen lassen; du brauchst dir nicht die geringsten Vorwürfe deswegen zu machen. Denn du hast ja gehört: wenn ich es im Flachland noch eine Weile so weiter getrieben hätte, so wäre womöglich mir nichts dir nichts mein ganzer Lungenlappen zum Teufel gegangen.«","{282}""Allow me!"" said Hans Castorp, always keeping his hands under his head. ""What's your headache? That's nonsense. did I come up to see you? Also; but primarily in order to recover, as instructed by Heidekind. Well, and now it turns out that I need more rest than he and we all dreamed of. I'm probably not the first who thought I was making a flying visit here, and then things turned out differently. Just think, for example, of Tous les deux's second son, and how it happened to him quite differently - I don't know if he's still alive, maybe they picked him up during a meal. It's a surprise to me that I'm a bit ill, I first have to get used to feeling like a patient here and really like one of you, instead of just being a guest like before. And then it doesn't surprise me at all, because I've actually never felt in such splendid condition, and when I think how early both my parents died - where was the splendor supposed to come from after all! We don't kid ourselves that you've got a little crack, even if it's as good as cured now, and so it may well be that it runs a bit in our family, Behrens at least made one of those Comment. Anyway, I've been lying here since yesterday, thinking about how I always felt and how I related to the whole thing, to life, you know, and its demands. A certain seriousness and a certain aversion to robust and noisy beings was always in my nature - we were still talking about it the other day, and that sometimes I almost felt like becoming a clergyman out of interest in sad and edifying things - such a black one Cloth, you know, with a silver cross on it or RIP ... Requiescat in pace ... that's actually the most beautiful word and I like it a lot more than 'He shall live high', which is more of a row. All this, I think to myself, is probably due to the fact that I myself have a crack and understand the disease from the start - it shows on this occasion. But if that's the case, then I can say I'm lucky that I came up and had myself examined; you don't need to blame yourself in the slightest for that. Because you have heard that if I had carried on like this in the lowlands for a while, it might have gone to the devil, not a thing, my whole lobe of lung.”","“Just a moment,” said Hans Castorp, without removing his hands from their clasped position behind his neck. “Surely it is unreasonable for you to break your head over it. Did I come up here to visit you? Well, of course in a way I did; but after all, the principal reason was to get the rest Heidekind prescribed. Well, and now it appears I need more of a rest than he or any of us dreamed. I am not the first who thought of making a flying visit up here for whom it fell out differently. Remember about Tousles-deux’s second son, and how it turned out with him —I don’t know whether he is still alive or not; perhaps they have fetched him away already, while we were sitting at our meal. That I am somewhat infected is naturally a great surprise to me; I must get used to the idea of being a patient and one of you, instead of just a guest. And yet in a way I am scarcely surprised, for I never have been in such blooming health, and when I think how young both my parents were when they died, I realize that it was natural I shouldn’t be particularly robust! We can’t deny that you had a weakness that way; we make no bones of it, even if it is as good as cured now, and it may easily be that it runs a little in the family, as Behrens suggested. Anyhow, I have been lying here since yesterday thinking it all over, considering what my attitude has been, how I felt toward the whole thing, to life, you know, and the demands it makes on you. A certain seriousness, a sort of disinclination to rough and noisy ways, has always been a part of my nature; we were talking about that lately, and I said I sometimes should have liked to be a clergyman, because I took such an interest in mournful and edifying things—a black pall, you know, with a silver cross on it, or R. I. P.— requiescat in pace, you know. That seems to me the most beautiful expression—I like it much better than ‘He’s a jolly good fellow,’ which is simply rowdy. I think all that comes from the fact that I have a weakness myself, and always felt at home with illness—the way I do now. But things being as they are, I find it very lucky that I came here, and that I was examined. Certainly you have no call to reproach yourself. You heard what he said: if I were to go down and continue as I have been, I should have the whole lobe at the devil before I could say Jack Robinson.”","“I beg your pardon,” Hans Castorp said, his hands still clasped behind his head. “What are you getting in such a stew about? That’s simply nonsense. Did I come up here to visit you? Yes, that too. But the primary reason, after all, was to take a vacation, on orders of Dr. Heidekind. Well, and now it turns out that I needed a vacation a lot more than he or any of us dreamed I did. I’m surely not the first person who thought he was just dropping by for a visit, and then had things turn out differently. Just think of Tous-les-deux’s second son, and how it turned out very differently for him, too. I don’t know whether he’s even still alive, perhaps they removed the body during a meal one day. I really am surprised to learn that I’m a little ill, but I’ll just have to get used to being a patient here, to actually being one of you, instead of merely the visitor I’ve been until now. But, then again, I’m not that surprised, either, because I’ve never really felt all that splendidly healthy, and when I think of how both my parents died young—then where was such splendid health supposed to come from? That you’ve got a little problem yourself—although it’s as good as cured now—why, none of us has ever pretended otherwise. So it may well be that it runs in the family a little—Behrens at least dropped a hint to that effect. At any rate, I’ve been lying here since yesterday asking myself just how I’ve always felt about it all, what my attitudes are, you know, about the whole thing, about life and its demands. I’ve always been rather serious by nature, with a certain aversion to anything loud or robust. We were speaking about the same thing here not long ago, about how I’ve sometimes almost wished I had become a clergyman, what with my interest in sad, edifying things—you know, like a black funeral pall with a silver cross and R.I.P. on it. Resquiescat in pace—that’s the loveliest phrase, and I find it personally much more appealing than something rowdy like ‘he’s a jolly good fellow.’ It all comes, I think, from my having a little problem myself and having understood something about illness from the start—which has all become apparent now. But since that’s how things have turned out, I can only say it was a lucky thing I came up here and got myself examined. You don’t have to reproach yourself for anything. You heard him say yourself that if I had stayed down below and continued my life just as before, it’s quite possible my whole pulmonary lobe would have gone, willy-nilly, to the devil.”"
"»Ja, vorhin, als wir fortgingen. Es war beinahe so etwas wie eine Konsultation, aber sine pecunia, wissen Sie. Er sah gleich, daß ich ziemlich anämisch bin. Und dann riet er mir, hier ganz so zu leben, wie mein Vetter, viel auf dem Balkon zu liegen, und messen soll ich mich auch gleich mit, hat er gesagt.«","'Yes, earlier when we were leaving. It was almost a consultation, but sine pecunia, you know. He saw right away that I'm pretty anemic. And then he advised me to live here like my cousin, to lie on the balcony a lot, and he said I should measure myself too.«","“Yes, just now, as we came out. It was almost like a professional visit—but gratis, you know— sine pecunia. He saw at once that I am anæmic. He advised me to follow my cousin’s regimen entirely: to lie out on the balcony a good deal—he even said I should take my temperature.”","“Yes, just now, as we were leaving for our walk. It was almost a kind of consultation, but sine pecunia, you know. He immediately noticed that I am rather anemic. And suggested that I should adopt my cousin’s style of life here—lie out on the balcony a great deal, even said I should measure my temperature, too.”"
"Settembrini fragte ihn, ob er, seinesteils, in betreff der Sterne jenen Glauben hege. Worauf er antwortete, er behalte sich jede Demut und Freiheit der Skepsis vor. Daraus war wieder einmal zu ersehen, was er unter »Freiheit« verstand, und wohin ein solcher Begriff davon zu führen vermochte. Und wenn nur nicht Herr Settembrini Grund gehabt hätte, zu fürchten, Hans Castorp möchte das alles hörenswert finden!","Settembrini asked him if, for his part, he had that belief about the stars. To which he replied that he reserved all humility and freedom of skepticism. From this it was once again evident what he meant by ""freedom"" and where such a concept could lead to. And if only Herr Settembrini hadn't had reason to fear that Hans Castorp might find it all worth hearing!","Settembrini asked him if that about the stars represented his own personal belief. He answered that on this point he reserved to himself the freedom, and the humblemindedness, of doubt. From which again it might be seen what he understood by freedom, and whither such a conception of it might lead. If only Herr Settembrini had not ground for the fear that Hans Castorp found all this highly worth listening to!","Settembrini asked him if he himself entertained such a belief about the stars. To which he replied that in that regard he would maintain all due humility and the freedom of skepticism. From which it once again became clear what he understood by “freedom” and to what conclusions such an understanding might lead. And, oh, if only Herr Settembrini had not had reason to fear Hans Castorp would find it all worth listening to."
"Nun wußte man es, wenn auch wohl nicht alle es ganz zu würdigen vermochten. Ein Seufzer ging durch den Saal, und Staatsanwalt Paravant nickte bedeutsamen Beifall, während Dr. Krokowski fortfuhr, seine These zu entwickeln. Hans Castorp seinerseits senkte den Kopf, um zu bedenken, was er gehört hatte, und sich zu erforschen, ob er es verstünde. Aber ungeübt, wie er war in solchen Gedankengängen, und außerdem wenig geisteskräftig infolge seines unbekömmlichen Spazierganges, war er leicht abzulenken und wurde dann auch sogleich abgelenkt durch den Rücken vor ihm und den zugehörigen Arm, der sich hob und rückwärts bog, um mit der Hand, dicht vor Hans Castorps Augen, von unten das geflochtene Haar zu stützen.","Now it was known, even if not everyone was able to fully appreciate it. A sigh went through the room and Prosecutor Paravant nodded significant applause while Dr. Krokowski went on to develop his thesis. For his part, Hans Castorp bowed his head to consider what he had heard and to see if he understood. But untrained as he was in such trains of thought, and besides having little mental strength as a result of his unwholesome walk, he was easily distracted and was then immediately distracted by the back in front of him and the accompanying arm, which rose and bent backwards, around with the hand , close to Hans Castorp's eyes, to support the plaited hair from below.","So now they knew—though very probably not all of them were capable of an opinion on what they heard. A sigh passed through the assemblage, and Lawyer Paravant weightily nodded approbation as Krokowski proceeded to develop his theme. Hans Castorp for his part sat with bowed head, trying to reflect on what had been said and test his own understanding of it. But he was unpractised in such exercises, and rendered still further incapable of mental exertion by the unhappy effect of the walk he had taken. His thoughts were soon drawn off again by the sight of Frau Chauchat’s back, and the arm appertaining, which was lifting and bending itself, close before Hans Castorp’s eyes, so that the hand could hold the braids of hair.","And so now they knew, even if not all of them were able fully to appreciate the knowledge. A sigh went through the room, and Prosecutor Paravant nodded his weighty approval while Dr. Krokowski continued to elaborate his thesis. For his part, Hans Castorp lowered his head to think about what he had heard and to explore whether he really understood it. But being unpracticed in such discursive reasoning and anything but intellectually alert after his unsalutary walk, he was easily diverted, and was in fact diverted almost immediately by the round back in front of him and by the arm extending from it, which lifted and reached back, so that the hand—now right before Hans Castorp’s eyes—could tuck at the braid of hair."
"»Nun, dann geben Sie schon wenigstens eine Papyros, verlorener Mensch!« sagte sie, indem sie sich ihm gegenüber neben den Kamin auf die mit einem leinenen Kissen belegte Bank setzte, ein Bein über das andere legte und die Hand ausstreckte. »Es scheint, damit sind Sie versehen.« Und sie nahm nachlässig und ohne zu danken aus seiner silbernen Dose die Zigarette, die er ihr entgegenschob, und bediente sich an dem Taschenfeuerzeug, das er vor ihrem vorgebeugten Gesichte spielen ließ. In diesem trägen »Geben Sie schon!«, diesem Nehmen ohne Dank lag Üppigkeit der verwöhnten Frau, überdies aber der Sinn menschlicher, oder besser gesagt: »mähnschlicher« Gemeinsamkeit und Besitzgenossenschaft, einer wilden und weichen Selbstverständlichkeit des Gebens und Nehmens. Er kritisierte es bei sich in verliebtem Sinn. Dann sagte er:","""Well, then at least give me a papyrus, lost man!"" she said, sitting down on the linen-cushioned bench opposite him by the fireplace, crossing one leg over the other and holding out her hand. ""It seems you are provided with that."" And carelessly and without a word of thanks she took the cigarette from his silver box, which he pushed towards her, and used the pocket lighter which he played in front of her bent face. In this lazy ""Give it!"", this taking without gratitude, there was the luxury of the spoiled woman, but also the sense of human, or rather ""manly"" community and ownership, a wild and soft naturalness of giving and taking. He criticized it at himself in amorous sense. Then he said:","“Well, then, lost soul, at least give me a papiros,” said she, and sat down opposite him on a bench with a linen cushion, one leg over the other. She stretched out her hand. “With those, at least, you are provided.” She took a cigarette, negligently, from the silver case he held out to her, and availed herself of his little pocket-device, the flame of which lighted up her face. The indolent “Give me a cigarette,” the taking it without thanks, bespoke the spoiled, luxurious female; yet even more it betokened a human companionship and mutual “belonging,” an unspoken give and take which came both thrilling and tender to his love-lorn sense. He said: “Yes, I always have them.","“Well, then, at least give me a papyrosa, my lost young man,” she said, sitting down opposite him next to the stove, on a bench cushioned with a linen pillow. She crossed one leg over the other and held out her hand. “It seems you come equipped with those.” And without a word of thanks, she nonchalantly took a cigarette from the silver case he held out to her, then accepted a light from the pocket lighter he let flicker before her face as she leaned forward. There was a voluptuousness in this spoiled woman’s “do give me,” in the way she took without a word of thanks; but beyond that, there was also a sense of mutual human—or better, humane—interests, of sharing, of a naturalness, at once both savage and tender, in the act of giving and taking. With the critical eye of a lover, he remarked on all this to himself. Then he said, “Yes, always have those."
"»Höchst ärgerlich,« sagte Joachim, »ist das und beinahe peinlich. Erkältungen, mußt du wissen, sind hier nicht reçus, man leugnet sie, sie kommen offiziell bei der großen Lufttrockenheit nicht vor, und als Patient würde man übel anlaufen bei Behrens, wenn man sich erkältet melden wollte. Aber bei dir ist es ja etwas anderes, du hast am Ende das Recht dazu. Es wäre doch gut, wenn wir den Katarrh noch abschneiden könnten, im {253}Flachlande kennt man ja Praktiken, hier aber – ich zweifle, ob man sich hier genügend dafür interessieren wird. Krank soll man hier lieber nicht werden, es kümmert sich niemand darum. Das ist eine alte Lehre, du erfährst es nun auch noch zu guter Letzt. Als ich ankam, war hier eine Dame, die hielt sich die ganze Woche ihr Ohr und jammerte über Schmerzen, und schließlich sah Behrens es an. ›Sie können ganz beruhigt sein,‹ sagt’ er, ›tuberkulös ist es nicht.‹ Dabei hatte es sein Bewenden. Ja, wir müssen sehn, was sich tun läßt. Ich werde es morgen früh dem Bademeister sagen, wenn er zu mir kommt. Das ist der Dienstweg, und er wird es schon weitergeben, so daß dann doch vielleicht etwas für dich geschieht.«","""It's extremely annoying,"" said Joachim, ""and almost embarrassing. Colds, you must know, aren't a problem here, they're denied, they don't officially happen because of the extreme dryness of the air, and as a patient you'd get a bad run at Behrens if you wanted to report a cold. But it's different for you, you have the right to do so in the end. It would be good if we could still cut off the catarrh, {253}practices are known in the lowlands, but here - I doubt whether there will be enough interest in it here. You shouldn't get sick here, nobody cares. That's an old lesson, you'll learn it now at last. When I arrived there was a lady here who was holding her ear all week and moaning about the pain, and finally Behrens looked at it. 'You can rest easy,' he says, 'it's not tubercular.' That was as far as it went. Yes, we must see what can be done. I'll tell the lifeguard in the morning when he comes to me. That's the official channel, and he'll pass it on, so maybe something will be done for you.""","“Very vexatious,” Joachim said, “and most unfortunate. Colds, you know, are not the thing at all, up here; they are not reçus. The authorities don’t admit their existence; the official attitude is that the dryness of the air entirely prevents them. If you were a patient, you would certainly fall foul of Behrens, if you went to him and said you had a cold. But it is a little different with a guest,—you have a right to have a cold if you want to. It would be good if we could check the catarrh. There are things to do, down below, but here—I doubt if anyone would take enough interest in it. It is not advisable to fall ill up here; you aren’t taken any notice of. It’s an old story—but you are coming to hear it at the end. When I was new up here, there was a lady who complained of her ear for a whole week and told everybody how she suffered. Behrens finally looked at it. ‘ Make yourself quite easy, madame,’ he said; ‘it is not tubercular.’ That was an end of the matter! Well, we must see what can be done. I will speak to the bathing-master early to-morrow morning, when he comes to my room. Then it will go through the regular channels, and perhaps something will come of it.”","“Very annoying,” Joachim said, “almost embarrassing, really. You should know that colds are not reçus here. It is denied that they exist , they do not occur—the air is officially much too dry here. And you won’t have much success as a patient if you go to Behrens with a cold. But it’s different with you, after all, you have a right to catch cold. It would be good if we could fend off your catarrh somehow—there are the methods practiced in the flatlands. But here—well, I doubt if they’ll be interested up here. It’s better not to get sick here, no one pays you any attention. It’s a well-known fact, but you’re learning it at the end of your stay. When I arrived there was a lady here who kept one hand pressed to her ear for a whole week, complaining of the pain, and finally Behrens took a look at it. ‘You can set your mind at ease,’ he said, ‘it’s not tubercular.’ And that was that. Yes, we’ll have to see what can be done. I’ll mention it to the bath attendant tomorrow morning when he comes for my massage. That’s the usual official channel—he’ll pass it on, and perhaps we can do something for you then.”"
"»Zugesteckt? Da der Bedarfsfall vorlag, habe ich ihr eines abgekauft.«","»Put it on? As the need arose, I bought one from her.«","“Slipped me—? Since the occasion arose, I bought one from her.”","“Slipped me one? Since I needed it, I bought one from her.”"
"Er war fertig mit Joachim, steckte sein Hörrohr in die Kitteltasche und rieb sich mit der riesigen Linken die beiden Augen, wie er zu tun pflegte, wenn er »abfiel« und melancholisch war. Halb mechanisch und zwischendurch gähnend vor Mißlaune sagte er sein Sprüchlein her:","He was done with Joachim, put his ear-trumpet in his coat pocket and rubbed both his eyes with his huge left hand, as he did when he ""fell off"" and was melancholic. Half mechanically and occasionally yawning in a bad mood, he said his little saying:","He finished with Joachim, thrust his stethoscope in the pocket of his smock, and rubbed his eyes with both huge hands, as was his habit when he had “backslidden” and become melancholy. Half mechanically, between yawns, he reeled off his patter:","He was finished now with Joachim; he slipped his stethoscope into the pocket of his smock and rubbed both eyes with his gigantic left hand—a habit of his when he “faded” and felt melancholy. Half-mechanically and between moody yawns, he rattled off his sales talk: “Well, Ziemssen, keep your chin up."
"Es war nichts gewesen mit dem Kavaliersgruß von Tisch zu Tisch. Clawdias Augen waren bei der »Vorstellung« über Hans Castorps Person wie über seinen ganzen Ort in fernere Gegenden des Saales hinweggeschweift; bei der folgenden Zusammenkunft im Speisesaal war es nicht anders gewesen; und je mehr Mahlzeiten vergingen, ohne daß die Blicke sich anders begegnet wären, als in einem blinden und gleichgültigen Hinstreifen von Frau Chauchats Seite, wenn sie sich während des Essens einmal umwandte, desto unpassender wurde es, den Kavaliersgruß noch anzubringen. Während der kurzen Abendgeselligkeit hielten die Reisegefährten sich in dem kleinen Salon: Auf dem Sofa saßen sie nebeneinander, im Kreise ihrer Tischgenossen, und Peeperkorn, dessen großartiges Angesicht hochgerötet gegen die Weiße seines flammenden Haars und seines Kinnbartes abstach, trank die Flasche Rotwein zu Ende, die er sich zum Diner hatte geben lassen. Zu jeder Hauptmahlzeit trank er eine, auch anderthalb oder zwei, zu schweigen von dem »Brote«, mit dem er schon beim ersten Frühstück begann. Offenbar war der königliche Mann der Labung in ungewöhnlichem Grade bedürftig. Auch in Gestalt von extrastarkem Kaffee führte er sie sich mehrmals am Tage zu: nicht nur in der {839}Frühe, sondern auch mittags trank er ihn aus großer Tasse, – nicht nach der Mahlzeit, sondern während ihrer und neben dem Wein. Beides, hörte Hans Castorp ihn sagen, sei gut gegen das Fieber, – von aller labenden Wirkung ganz abgesehen, sehr gut gegen sein intermittierendes Tropenfieber, das ihn schon am zweiten Tage für mehrere Stunden an Zimmer und Bett fesselte. Quartanfieber nannte der Hofrat es, da es den Holländer ungefähr viertägig anwandelte: erst als ein Klappern, dann als ein Glühen und dann als ein Schwitzen. Auch eine geschwollene Milz sollte er davon haben.","There had been nothing with the cavalier salute from table to table. During the 'representation', Clawdia's eyes had swept over Hans Castorp's person and his entire town to distant parts of the hall; the following meeting in the dining room was no different; and the more meals went by without our eyes meeting in anything other than a blind and indifferent glance at Frau Chauchat's side when she turned around during the meal, the more inappropriate it became to add the gentleman's salute. During the brief evening socializing, the traveling companions stayed in the small salon: they sat side by side on the sofa, surrounded by their table companions, and Peeperkorn, whose magnificent face was flushed against the whiteness of his flaming hair and goatee, finished the bottle of red wine. which he had asked for dinner. With every main meal he drank one, even one and a half or two, not to mention the ""sandwich"" he started with at first breakfast. Apparently the royal man was in unusual need of refreshment. He also took it several times a day in the form of extra-strong coffee: not only in the {839}morning, but also at midday he drank it from a large cup - not after the meal, but during it and alongside the wine. Both, Hans Castorp heard him say, are good for the fever - apart from all refreshing effects, very good for his intermittent tropical fever, which tied him to his room and bed for several hours on the second day. The councilor called it quartan fever, since it got the Dutchman about for four days: first as a rattle, then as a glow, and then as a sweat. He should also have a swollen spleen from it.","As for that courtly salute from table to table—nothing came of it. Clavdia’s eyes, when she presented herself, had passed over Hans Castorp’s person and his whole vicinity, and rested upon the far corner of the room. At the next meal it was the same. And the more meals passed without any response to his gaze than this blank and indifferent passing-over, the more impracticable became the project of the courtly salute. After supper the two travelling-companions sat in the small salon, on the sofa together, surrounded by their table-mates; and Peeperkorn, his magnificent visage flaming against the flashing white of hair and beard, drank out the bottle of red wine he had ordered at table. At each of the main meals he drank one, or two, or two and a half bottles, in addition to the “bread” which he took even at early breakfast. Obviously the system of this kingly man stood in more than common need of moistening. He took in fluid likewise in the form of extra-strong coffee, many times a day, drinking it out of a large cup, even after dinner—or rather, he drank it during dinner, along with the wine. Wine and coffee, Hans Castorp heard him say, were both good for fever—quite aside from their cordial and refreshing properties—very good against the intermittent tropical fever which had kept him in bed for several hours the second day after he arrived. The Hofrat called it quartan fever: it took the Dutchman about every fourth day, first with a chill, then with a fever, then with a mighty sweat. He was said to have also an inflamed spleen, from the same cause.","Nothing came of the cavalier’s greeting from table to table. In “presenting” herself, Clavdia had let her eyes sweep right past Hans Castorp and all the farther regions of the room; nothing happened at their next meeting in the dining hall, either; and the more meals that passed without his eye meeting hers—unless you counted Frau Chauchat’s blind, sweeping, impassive gaze if she happened to turn around during a meal—the more unsuitable it would have been to attempt his cavalier’s greeting. During the brief evening social gatherings, the two traveling companions kept to the little salon. They sat side by side on the sofa surrounded by their tablemates; and Peeperkorn, whose magnificent countenance stood out bright red against the white of his flaming hair and beard, drank the rest of the bottle of red wine he had ordered for dinner. He drank a bottle at every main meal, sometimes one and a half, even two, not to mention the “bread,” with which he started every meal, including first breakfast. Apparently this regal man required unusual amounts of regalement. He likewise found regalement in extra-strong coffee, which he drank several times a day—not just in the morning, but at noon from a large cup, and not just after the meal, but during it, along with his wine. Both wine and coffee, Hans Castorp heard him say, were good for fever— quite apart from their regaling effect, they were very good for his intermittent attacks of tropical fever, one of which kept him bedfast in his room for several hours the second day after his arrival. Quartan fever, the director called it, because it struck the Dutchman down approximately every fourth day—it started with chattering teeth, then came a hot flush, and finally the sweats. It was said that he had a swollen spleen from it as well."
"Herr Settembrini dankte für die Gedächtnisstärkung. Die Figur des Mönches Ilsan aus dem »Rosengarten« behalte viel Erquickliches gegenüber dem hier gepriesenen Grabesaristo{890}kratismus, und wenn er, Redner, kein Freund des deutschen Reformators sei, auf den eine Anspielung geschehen, so finde man ihn doch glühend bereit, alles, was an demokratischem Individualismus seiner Lehre zugrunde liege, gegen jederlei geistlich-feudale Herrschaftsgelüste über die Persönlichkeit in Schutz zu nehmen.","Mr. Settembrini thanked for the memory booster. The figure of the monk Ilsan from the »Rosengarten« has a lot to cheer about compared to the sepulchral aristocracy {890}praised here, and even if he, speaker, is not a friend of the German reformer to whom an allusion has been made, one finds him glowingly ready to protect everything that underlies his teaching in terms of democratic individualism against all kinds of clerical-feudal desires to rule over the personality.","Herr Settembrini thanked him for jogging his memory. The figure of the monk Ilsan in the Rosengarten he did indeed find refreshing by comparison with this muchlauded aristocracy of the grave. He, the speaker, was no friend to the German Reformation; but they would find him ever ready to defend whatever of democratic individualism there was in its teaching, against any and every clerical and feudal craving for dominion over the individual.","Herr Settembrini thanked him for jogging his memory. The figure of the monk Ilsan in the epic Rosengarten contained a great many refreshing traits when compared with the graveyard aristocracy so highly praised here; and if he, Settembrini, was no friend of the German reformer to whom allusion had been made, they would nevertheless find him ready fervently to defend a doctrine based on democratic individualism against any sort of spiritual and feudal yearnings to dominate the personality."
"Nachdenklich teilnehmend blickte Hans Castorp auf sie hinab, und ihm war, als verdunkele ihre traurige Erscheinung die Morgensonne. Gleichzeitig aber faßte er noch etwas anderes {63}auf, etwas Hörbares, Geräusche, die aus dem Nachbarzimmer zur Linken, dem Zimmer des russischen Ehepaars, nach Joachims Angabe, kamen und gleichfalls nicht zu dem heiteren, frischen Morgen passen wollten, sondern ihn irgendwie klebrig zu verunreinigen schienen. Hans Castorp erinnerte sich, daß er schon gestern abend dergleichen vernommen, doch hatte seine Müdigkeit ihn gehindert, darauf zu achten. Es war ein Ringen, Kichern und Keuchen, dessen anstößiges Wesen dem jungen Mann nicht lange verborgen bleiben konnte, obgleich er sich anfangs aus Gutmütigkeit bemühte, es harmlos zu deuten. Man hätte dieser Gutmütigkeit auch andere Namen geben können, zum Beispiel den etwas faden der Seelenreinheit, oder den ernsten und schönen der Schamhaftigkeit, oder die herabsetzenden Namen der Wahrheitsunlust und der Duckmäuserei, oder selbst den einer mystischen Scheu und Frömmigkeit, – von alledem war etwas in Hans Castorps Verhalten zu den Geräuschen nebenan, und physiognomisch drückte es sich aus in einer ehrbaren Verfinsterung seiner Miene, so, als dürfe und wolle er von dem, was er da hörte, nichts wissen: einem Ausdruck von Sittsamkeit, der nicht ganz originell war, den er aber bei bestimmten Gelegenheiten anzunehmen pflegte.","Hans Castorp looked down at her with thoughtful sympathy, and it seemed to him that her sad appearance was darkening the morning sun. At the same time, however, he perceived something else {63}, something audible, noises that came from the neighboring room on the left, the room of the Russian couple, according to Joachim, and likewise did not want to go with the bright, fresh morning, but somehow with it seemed sticky to contaminate. Hans Castorp remembered hearing something like that last night, but his tiredness prevented him from paying attention. It was a wrestling, giggling, and panting whose offensive nature could not remain hidden from the young man for long, although at first, out of good nature, he tried to interpret it harmlessly. One could have given this good-naturedness other names, for example the somewhat insipid of purity of soul, or the serious and beautiful of modesty, or the disparaging names of apathy for truth and cowardice, or even that of a mystical shyness and piety—there was something of all of that in Hans Castorp's attitude towards the noises next door, and physiognomically it was expressed in a respectable darkening of his expression, as if he shouldn't and didn't want to know anything about what he was hearing: an expression of modesty that wasn't entirely original , which he used to adopt on certain occasions.","He looked down upon her with pensive sympathy; it seemed to him the sad apparition darkened the morning sunshine. But in the same instant he became aware of something else, something audible: certain noises penetrating to his hearing from the room on the left of his own, which was occupied, Joachim had said, by a Russian couple. Again he felt a discrepancy; these sounds no more suited the blithe freshness of the morning than had the sad sight in the garden below—rather they seemed to befoul the air, make it thick, sticky. Hans Castorp recalled having heard similar sounds the evening before, though his weariness had prevented him from heeding them: a struggling, a panting and giggling, the offensive nature of which could not long remain hidden to the young man, try as he good-naturedly did to put a harmless construction on them. Perhaps something more or other than good nature was in play, something to which we give a variety of names, calling it now purity of soul, which sounds insipid; again by that grave, beautiful name of chastity; and yet again disparaging it as hypocrisy, as “hating to look facts in the face”; even ascribing it to an obscure sense of awe and piety—and, in truth, something of all these was in Hans Castorp’s face and bearing as he listened. He seemed to be practising a seemly obscurantism; to be mentally drawing the veil over these sounds that he heard; to be telling himself that honour forbade his taking any cognizance of them, or even hearing them at all—it gave him an air of propriety which was not quite native, though he knew how to assume it on occasion.","Hans Castorp gazed down at her in thoughtful sympathy, and it seemed as if her sad appearance darkened the morning sun. Simultaneously, however, he perceived something else, something audible, coming from the adjoining room on his left, the room with the Russian couple, so Joachim had said—noises that were likewise ill suited to this cheerful, fresh morning, that tainted it, making it seem sultry somehow. Hans Castorp remembered that he had heard the same sounds the night before, but had been too tired to pay them any attention. Giggles, gasps, grapplings—there was no disguising the indelicate nature of the sound, although in his kindheartedness the young man at first tried hard to give it a harmless interpretation. One could use other terms for his kindheartedness—an insipid phrase like “purity of soul,” for instance, or a more serious and beautiful word like “modesty,” or disparaging words such as “avoidance of the truth” and “hypocrisy,” or even a phrase about “the mystic piety of shyness”—and Hans Castorp’s reaction to the sounds from the adjoining room combined something of them all and was visible now as a shadow of respectability that darkened his face, as if he should not know and did not want to know anything about what he heard there. It was an expression of propriety—not exactly original, but one he was in the habit of assuming under certain circumstances."

"Köstlich, daß Herr Settembrini sich wieder einmal für einen Individualisten hielt! Um es zu sein, mußte man jedoch den Unterschied von Sittlichkeit und Glückseligkeit kennen, was bei dem Herrn Illuminaten und Monisten schlechterdings nicht der Fall war. Wo das Leben stupiderweise als Selbstzweck angenommen und nach einem darüber hinausgehenden Sinn und Zweck gar nicht gefragt wurde, da herrschte Gattungs- und Sozialethik, Wirbeltiermoralität, aber kein Individualismus, – als welcher einzig und allein im Bereich des Religiösen und Mystischen, im sogenannten »sittlich ungeordneten All«, zu Hause war. Was sie denn sei und wolle, die Sittlichkeit des Herrn Settembrini! Sie sei lebengebunden, also nichts als nützlich, also unheroisch in erbarmungswürdigem Grade. Sie sei dazu da, daß man alt und glücklich, reich und gesund damit {699}werde und damit Punktum. Diese Vernunft- und Arbeitsphilisterei gelte ihm als Ethik. Was dagegen Naphta betreffe, so erlaube er sich wiederholt, sie als schäbige Lebensbürgerlichkeit zu kennzeichnen.","It's wonderful that Mr. Settembrini should once again think of himself as an individualist! To be so, however, one had to know the difference between morality and happiness, which was absolutely not the case with the Illuminati and Monist. Where life was stupidly accepted as an end in itself and no questions were asked about a meaning and purpose that went beyond it, there prevailed species and social ethics, vertebrate morality, but no individualism - as which only in the area of the religious and mystical, in the so-called ""moral disordered universe,” was at home. What is it and what it wants, Herr Settembrini's morality! It is life-bound, so nothing but useful, so unheroic to a pitiable degree. It is there to make you old and happy, rich and healthy with it, and that's the point. This philistinism of reason and labor is what he sees as ethics. On the other hand, as far as naphtha is concerned, he repeatedly takes the liberty of characterizing it as shabby bourgeois life.","It was delicious, Herr Settembrini’s thinking of himself as an individualist! For to be that, one had at least to recognize the difference between morality and blessedness, which our honoured illuminant and monist most certainly did not! A society in which life was stupidly conceived as an end in itself, with no questions asked about its ulterior meaning and purpose, was governed by a tribal and social ethic, indeed, a vertebrate morality, if you liked, but certainly not by individualism. For individualism belonged, singly and solely, in the realm of the religious and mystical, in the so-called “morally chaotic All.” And this morality of Herr Settembrini’s, what was it, what did it want? It was life-bound, and thus entirely utilitarian; it was pathetically unheroic. Its end and aim was to make men grow old and happy, rich and comfortable—and that was all there was to it. And this Philistine philosophy, this gospel of work and reason, served Herr Settembrini as an ethical system. As far as he, Naphta, was concerned, he would continue to deny that it was anything but the sheerest and shabbiest bourgeoisiedom.","How charming—Herr Settembrini was back to calling himself an individualist. To be that, however, one needed to know the difference between morality and blessedness, which the gentleman, as a good illuminatus and monist, most certainly did not. Wherever life was stupidly regarded as an end in itself, with no questions asked about a meaning or purpose beyond it, what one found were social ethics, species ethics, vertebrate ethics, but not individualism—that resided solely in the realm of the religious and mystical, in that so-called chaotic void. Just what was Herr Settembrini’s morality, what was its point? It was bound to life, and so merely utilitarian— unheroic, miserably so. Its sole objective was for a person to grow old, rich, happy, and healthy—period; he considered a philistine gospel of reason and work to be ethics. But as far as he, Naphta, was concerned, he once again took the liberty of calling that a shabby bourgeoisiosity of life."

"»Na«, dachte Hans Castorp, »das ist auch so ein pythischer Spruch! Kneift man die Lippen zusammen, nachdem man ihn hingesetzt, so herrscht Einschüchterung für den Augenblick … «","""Well,"" thought Hans Castorp, ""that's another Pythian saying! If you purse your lips after setting him down, there's intimidation for the moment...""","“Goodness,” thought Hans Castorp, “but that was a Pythian remark! Made like that with the lips snapped together afterwards , it quite staggers one—for the moment , that is.”","“Well,” Hans Castorp thought, “there’s a Delphic remark for you. And if you purse your lips tight after delivering it, that will certainly intimidate everyone for a bit.”"

Isn’t that so?”"
"Beide Ärzte verabfolgten dies Heilmittel, bald dieser, bald jener, aber der Hofrat tat es als Virtuos, mit einem Schwung, indem er beim Einstich zugleich abdrückte. Übrigens kümmerte er sich nicht um die Stelle, wohin er stach, so daß der Schmerz zuweilen des Teufels war und der Punkt noch lange brennend verhärtet blieb. Ferner wirkte die Injektion stark angreifend auf den Gesamtorganismus, erschütterte das Nervensystem wie eine Gewaltleistung sportlicher Art, und das zeugte für die ihr innewohnende Kraft, die sich auch darin bekundete, daß sie unmittelbar, für den Augenblick, die Temperatur sogar erhöhte: so hatte der Hofrat es vorausgesagt, und so geschah es denn auch, gesetzmäßig und ohne daß es an der vorausgesagten Erscheinung etwas zu beanstanden gab. Die Prozedur war rasch abgetan, war man nur erst einmal an der Reihe; im Handumdrehen hatte man sein Gegengift unter der Haut, sei es des Schenkels oder Armes. Ein paarmal aber, wenn der Hofrat sich eben aufgelegt und vom Tabak nicht getrübt zeigte, kam es anläßlich der Injektion doch zu einem kleinen Gespräch mit ihm, das Hans Castorp etwa wie folgt zu lenken wußte:","Both doctors administered this remedy, now this one, now that one, but the Hofrat did it like a virtuoso, with a flourish, by pulling the trigger at the same time as the puncture. Besides, he paid no attention to the spot where he stabbed, so that at times the pain was of the devil and the point remained burning hard for a long time. Furthermore, the injection had a strong attack on the entire organism, shook the nervous system like a violent act of a sporting nature, and that testified to its inherent power, which also manifested itself in the fact that it immediately, for the moment, even increased the temperature: that's how he had Hofrat predicted it, and so it happened, according to the law and without there being anything to object to about the predicted appearance. The procedure was quickly done once it was your turn; in the twinkling of an eye one had one's antidote under the skin, be it thigh or arm. A couple of times, however, when the Hofrat showed himself to be in a good mood and not bothered by the tobacco, there was a small conversation with him on the occasion of the injection, which Hans Castorp managed to steer something like this:","These were given by either physician indifferently; but the Hofrat performed the operation like a virtuoso, with a fine sweep, squeezing the little syringe at the very moment he pressed the point home. And he cared not a doit where he thrust his needle, so that the pain was often acute, and the spot hard and inflamed long afterwards. The effect of the inoculations on the entire organism was very noticeable, the nervous system reacted as after hard muscular exertion; and their strength was displayed in the heightened fever which was their immediate result. The Hofrat had said they would have this effect, and so it fell out. The whole affair, each time, took but a second; one after another, the row of patients received their dosage, in thigh or arm, and turned away. But once or twice, when the Hofrat was in a more lively mood, not depressed by the tobacco he had smoked, Hans Castorp came to speech with him, and conducted the brief conversation somewhat as follows:","Both doctors administered the drug, sometimes the one, sometimes the other, although the director was a virtuoso at it, inserting the needle and squeezing the syringe in one flourish. He paid no attention, however, to where he was sticking the needle, so that it could hurt like hell, leaving a little hardened spot that stung for a long time. The injections were also very hard on the entire system, as much a shock to the nerves as a major athletic feat would have been, which was a token of their inherent potency, likewise evidenced by an immediate, though momentary, rise in temperature. The director had predicted it all, and it all happened as per regulation, with no deviations from the norm worth mentioning. When it finally came your turn, the procedure was quickly taken care of; quick as a flash the antitoxin was under your skin, either in the thigh or arm. Now and then, when the director was in the mood and not melancholy from tobacco, he might actually use the occasion of an injection for a little conversation, which Hans Castorp knew how to steer along the following lines:"
"»Wann ist denn wieder Liegekur?« fragte er, als sie das Haus verließen. »Das ist das Beste hier, soviel ich sehe. Ich wollte, ich läge schon wieder auf meinem vorzüglichen Stuhl. Gehen wir weit spazieren?«","""When is the rest cure again?"" he asked as they left the house. 'This is the best here as far as I can see. I wish I were lying in my excellent chair again. shall we go for a long walk?”","“When do we lie down again?” he asked, as they left the house. “It’s the best thing up here, so far as I can see. I wish I were back again in my comfortable chair. Do we take a long walk?”","“When is the next rest cure?” he asked as they left the building. “That’s the best thing here, as far as I can see. I wish I were lying in my splendid lounge chair again right now. Are we going to walk far?”"
"»Was haben Sie hier zu suchen!« herrschte der Hofrat ihn mit quellenden Augen an. »Soll ich Ihnen ein Extra-Exemplar der Hausordnung aushändigen lassen? Meines Wissens ist Liegekur. Ihre Kurve und die Platte geben Ihnen gar kein besonderes Recht, den Freiherrn zu spielen. Man sollte hier irgendwo so eine göttliche Diebsscheuche anbringen lassen, die Leute, die zwischen zwei und vier im Garten Libertinage treiben, mit Aufspießung bedroht! Was wollen Sie eigentlich?«","""What are you doing here?"" the privy councilor snapped at him, his eyes bulging. 'Would you like me to give you an extra copy of the house rules? To my knowledge rest cure. Your curve and the plate don't give you any special right to play the baron. They should have some godly scarecrow up here somewhere that threatens people who practice libertinism in the garden between the ages of two and four with impaling! What is it you want?'","“What are you doing here?” demanded the Hofrat, and goggled his eyes. “Shall I get an extra-special copy of the house rules printed for you? Seems to me this is the rest period. Your curve and your x-ray don’t justify you in playing the independent gentleman, so far as I know. I ought to set up a scarecrow to gobble up people who have the cheek to come down and walk about in the garden at this hour.” “Herr Hofrat, I absolutely must speak to you for a moment.”","“What are you doing here?” the director snapped, his eyes bulging. “Should I have someone give you a special copy of the house rules? As far as I know, it’s main rest cure. Your fever chart and your X-ray give you no particular right to go free-lance. We should erect a statue out here somewhere, a scarecrow divinity who will skewer anyone philandering about between two and four. Just what do you want?”"
"Settembrini hatte die letzten Worte, dicht vor Hans Castorp stehend, fast ohne Ton und sehr rasch gesprochen, um fertig zu werden. Entsatz näherte sich für Hans Castorp: Joachim betrat, zwei Postkarten in der Hand, das Lesezimmer, die Rede des Literaten brach ab, und die Gewandtheit, mit der sein Ausdruck ins gesellschaftlich Leichte hinüberwechselte, verfehlte nicht ihren Eindruck auf seinen Schüler, – wenn man Hans Castorp so nennen konnte.","Settembrini had spoken the last words, standing close to Hans Castorp, almost silently and very quickly, in order to finish. Relief approached for Hans Castorp: Joachim, two postcards in hand, entered the reading room, the writer's speech broke off, and the dexterity with which his expression changed to something socially easy did not fail to impress his pupil - if one Hans Castorp could call it that.","These last words Settembrini had uttered standing close to Hans Castorp, very rapidly and tonelessly, as though to make an end of the subject. Succour was nigh for the youth: Joachim entered the reading-room, with two postcards in his hand. The Italian broke off; and the dexterity with which he altered his tone for one in a lighter and fitting social key was not lost upon his pupil—if so Hans Castorp may be called.","Settembrini had been standing very close to Hans Castorp as he spoke these final words in an almost flat tone of voice, hurrying to finish before reinforcements for Hans Castorp’s side arrived—Joachim had just entered the reading room, two postcards in hand. The man of letters said no more, and the ease with which he changed now to a light conversational tone did not fail to make an impression on his student—if one can call Hans Castorp that."
"»Oh, nett«, erwiderte Hans Castorp. »Doch, ich war ziemlich weit. Aber ich muß gestehen, es hat mir weniger gut getan, als ich erwartete. Es war wohl verfrüht oder überhaupt verfehlt. Ich werde es vorläufig nicht wieder tun.«","""Oh, nice,"" replied Hans Castorp. 'Yes, I was quite far. But I have to admit it didn't do me as well as I expected. It was probably premature or missed altogether. I won't do it again for the time being.""","“Oh, very nice,” Hans Castorp answered. “Yes, I went rather a long way. But I must confess, it did me less good than I thought it would. I won’t repeat it for the present.”","“Oh, nice,” Hans Castorp replied. “But I did walk rather far. And I must admit it did me less good than I expected. It was perhaps a little too soon for it, or maybe just the wrong idea altogether. I’ll not be doing it again right away.”"
"All dieser Zartsinn, wie gesagt, erschien nun hinfällig da{837}durch, daß ihm die Freiwilligkeit und damit alle Verdienstlichkeit genommen war. Die Gegenwart Mynheer Peeperkorns schaltete die Möglichkeit einer Taktik, die nicht in äußerster Zurückhaltung bestanden hätte, allzu gründlich aus. Hans Castorp hatte am Abend der Ankunft von seiner Loge aus den Schlitten, auf dessen Bock neben dem Kutscher der malaiische Kammerdiener saß, ein gelbes Männchen mit einem Pelzkragen auf dem Überzieher und in steifem Hut, im Schritt die Wegschleife heraufkommen sehen, und zuseiten Clawdias im Fond hatte, Hut in der Stirn, der Fremde gesessen. Diese Nacht hatte Hans Castorp wenig geschlafen. Am Morgen hatte es keine Schwierigkeiten bereitet, den Namen des verwirrenden Mitkömmlings zu erfahren, mit der Nachricht als Dreingabe, daß beide im ersten Stockwerk nachbarliche Vorzugsräumlichkeiten bezogen hätten. Dann war das erste Frühstück gekommen, bei dem er, zeitig an seinem Platze und blaß genug, auf das Zufallen der Glastür gewartet hatte. Es war ausgeblieben. Clawdias Eintritt hatte sich lautlos vollzogen, denn hinter ihr hatte Mynheer Peeperkorn die Glastür geschlossen, – groß, breit und hochgestirnt, weiß umlodert das mächtige Haupt, war er den Spuren der Reisegefährtin gefolgt, die sich mit vertrautem Katzentritt, vorgeschobenen Kopfes, ihrem Tisch genähert hatte. Ja, sie war es, unverändert. Programmwidrig und selbstvergessen umfaßte Hans Castorp sie mit seinem übernächtigen Blick. Es war ihr rötlichblondes, nicht weiter kunstreich frisiertes, sondern in einfacher Flechte um den Kopf gelegtes Haar, es waren ihre »Steppenwolfslichter«, ihre Nackenrundung, ihre Lippen, die voller erschienen, als sie waren, vermöge jener Betonung der Wangenknochen, die eine anmutige Höhlung der Wangen selbst bewirkte … Clawdia! dachte er erschauernd, – und er faßte den Unerwarteten ins Auge, nicht ohne ein spöttisch-trotziges Kopfaufwerfen gegen die maskenhafte Großartigkeit seiner Erscheinung, nicht ohne die Auf{838}forderung an sein Herz, sich lustig zu machen über die Großmächtigkeit eines gegenwärtigen Besitzrechtes, das durch gewisse Vergangenheiten in ein recht schiefes Licht gesetzt wurde: gewisse Vergangenheiten in der Tat, nicht dunkel unsichere, auf dem Gebiet der dilettantischen Ölmalerei gelegen, wie sie ihn selbst wohl zu beunruhigen vermocht hatten … Auch ihre Art, vor dem Platznehmen gegen den Saal hin lächelnd Front zu machen, sich gleichsam der Gesellschaft zu präsentieren, hatte Frau Chauchat bewahrt, und Peeperkorn leistete ihr Gefolgschaft darin, indem er schräg hinter ihr stehend die kleine Zeremonie sich vollziehen ließ, um sich danach an seinem Tischende zu Clawdias Seite niederzulassen.","All this delicacy, as I said, now seemed obsolete because it was deprived of its voluntary nature and thus of all merit. The presence of Mynheer Peeperkorn all too thoroughly eliminated the possibility of any tactic that would not have involved extreme restraint. On the evening of his arrival, Hans Castorp had seen from his box the sleigh, on whose box the Malayan valet was sitting next to the coachman, a little yellow man with a fur collar on his overcoat and in a stiff hat, coming up the path loop at a walk, and at Clawdia’s side in the The stranger was sitting behind him, his hat on his forehead. That night Hans Castorp had slept little. In the morning there had been no difficulty in learning the name of the confusing fellow, with the added bonus that both had moved into adjoining privileged quarters on the first floor. Then the first breakfast had come, when he had been at his place early and pale enough, waiting for the glass door to slam shut. It hadn't happened. Clawdia's entrance had been silent, for behind her Mynheer Peeperkorn had closed the glass door - tall, broad and high-starred, white blazing around the mighty head, he had followed in the footsteps of the traveling companion, who approached her table with the familiar cat's footsteps, head thrust forward had. Yes, it was, unchanged. Contrary to the program and oblivious to himself, Hans Castorp embraced her with his bleary-eyed gaze. It was her reddish-blond hair, not elaborately styled but simply braided around her head, it was her ""Steppenwolf lights"", the curve of her neck, her lips, which appeared fuller than they were because of that emphasis on the cheekbones, which is a graceful one Concavity of the cheeks themselves caused... Clawdia! he thought, shuddering - and he looked at the unexpected man, not without a mockingly defiant raising of his head at the mask-like magnificence of his appearance, not without a challenge to his heart to make fun of the mighty power of a present property right, which was cast in a rather crooked light by certain pasts: certain pasts indeed, not obscurely uncertain ones, situated in the field of amateurish oil painting, as they had probably been able to unsettle him himself ... Also her manner before taking a seat towards the hall Mrs. Chauchat had kept her face smiling, presenting herself, as it were, to society, and Peeperkorn followed her in this, standing at an angle behind her, allowing the little ceremony to be performed, and then settling down at his end of the table by Clawdia's side.","All this fine feeling, now, had become null and void— Hans Castorp’s conduct being deprived of choice, and therewith of merit. The presence of Mynheer Peeperkorn effectively disposed of any tactics save utter aloofness. On the evening of the arrival, Hans Castorp had seen from his loge the sleigh come up the winding drive. On the box next the coachman sat the Malayan valet, a yellow little man with a fur collar to his overcoat, and a bowler hat. At the back, his hat over his brows, sat the stranger, beside Clavdia. That night Hans Castorp got little sleep. Next morning he heard for the asking the name of the mysterious new arrival; heard likewise that the two travellers occupied neighbouring suites on the first floor. He was early at breakfast, and sat in his place erect but pale, awaiting the slamming of the glass door. It did not come. Clavdia’s entrance was noiseless; for Mynheer Peeperkorn closed the door behind her—tall and broad, his white hair flaring above his lofty brow, he followed the familiar gliding tread of his companion, as with head stuck out before her she slipped to her chair. Yes, she was unchanged. Regardless of his programme, Hans Castorp devoured her, with his sleep-weary eyes. There was the red-blond hair, no more elaborately dressed than of yore, wound in the same simple braid about her head; there were the “prairie-wolf’s eyes,” the rounding neck, the lips that seemed fuller than they actually were, thanks to the prominent cheek-bones, which gave the cheeks that exquisite flat or slightly concave look.—Clavdia! he thought, and thrilled. He fixed his eyes on the unexpected guest; not without a toss of the head for the splendid masklike impression the person made; not without summoning a sneer at pretensions which, however justified by present possession, were invalidated by the past—by certain very definite events in the past—for instance in the field of amateur portraiture. Hans Castorp knew, for had not those events visited himself with justifiable pangs?—Even her way of turning, before she sat down, to present herself, as it were, to the room, she had as of yore. Mynheer Peeperkorn assisted at the little ceremony, standing behind her while it took place, and then seating himself at Clavdia’s side.","But, as noted, all this delicacy seemed futile now, since his actions had been robbed of their spontaneity and thus of any value. The presence of Mynheer Peeperkorn completely ruled out the possibility of any tactics except those of uttermost reserve. Hans Castorp had been sitting on his balcony on the evening of their arrival, had watched the sleigh move slowly up the looping driveway, and had seen the driver on his box, beside him the Malayan valet, a little yellow-skinned man wearing a bowler and sporting a fur collar on his overcoat—and sitting in back, at Clavdia’s side, the stranger, his hat pulled down over his eyes. Hans Castorp had not slept much that night. The next morning he had no difficulty learning the name of this unsettling fellow traveler, including the gratis news that the two of them had taken adjoining rooms on the second floor. Then had come first breakfast, during which he had sat at his place, waiting with a pale face for the glass door to slam. It did not. Clavdia’s entrance took place silently, because Mynheer Peeperkorn closed the glass door behind her; tall, broad-shouldered, the high brow of his mighty head encircled by white flames, he followed in the footsteps of his traveling companion, who, head thrust slightly forward, moved toward her table with her familiar catlike gait. Yes, it was she, unchanged. Forgetting himself and his plan, Hans Castorp held her in his sleepy gaze. That was her reddish-blond hair, no more elegantly coiffed than usual, just a simple braid wound around her head; those were her “lone-wolf eyes,” her rounded neck, her lips, which seemed fuller than they were because they were accented by cheekbones that gave a charming concavity to her cheeks. “Clavdia!” he thought with a shudder. And he looked her unexpected companion directly in the eye, not without a defiant toss of his head to mock the masklike face and the grandeur of the figure, not without challenging his own heart to make fun of this exalted personage, whose current rights of possession were cast in a very odd light by certain past events: certain past events, indeed—not dark, uncertain events from the realms of amateur portraits, which had had the power to disquiet him at one time. Frau Chauchat still had the same way of smiling and standing at attention, as if presenting herself to society before taking her seat; and Peeperkorn devotedly stood behind her and a bit to one side as she performed her little ceremony, and then took his own seat next to her at the end of the table."
"»Nein, ich muß jetzt abreisen, Herr Hofrat, in acht Tagen.«","""No, I have to leave now, Herr Hofrat, in a week.""","“No, I must leave now, Herr Hofrat, in a week, that is.”","“No, sir, I have to leave now—one week from today.”"
"{155}»Ah, Decken, Liegekur«, sagte Settembrini. »So, so, so. Ei, ei, ei. In der Tat: Placet experiri!« wiederholte er mit italienischer Aussprache und verabschiedete sich, denn sie hatten, begrüßt von dem hinkenden Concierge, das Sanatorium betreten, und in der Halle schwenkte Settembrini in die Konversationsräume ab, um vor Tische die Zeitungen zu lesen, wie er sagte. Die zweite Liegekur schien er schwänzen zu wollen.","{155}""Ah, blankets, rest cure,"" said Settembrini. “Well, well, well. Oh, oh, oh. In fact: placet experiri!' he repeated in Italian and said goodbye, for they had entered the sanatorium, greeted by the limping concierge, and in the hall Settembrini veered off into the conversation rooms to read the newspapers at the tables, as he said. He seemed to want to skip the second rest cure.","“Ah ha! Blankets—the cure,” Settembrini said. “Yes, yes. In fact: placet experiri,” he repeated, with his Italian pronunciation, and took his leave, for their conversation had brought them to the door of the sanatorium, where they greeted the lame concierge in his lodge. Settembrini turned off into one of the sitting-rooms, to read the newspapers before luncheon. He evidently meant to cut the second rest period.","“Ah, blankets, rest cure,” Settembrini said. “Yes, yes, yes. I see, I see, I see. Indeed: placet experiri!” he repeated, pronouncing it with his Italian c; and now he took his leave, for they had arrived at the sanatorium, where they were greeted by the limping concierge. Once they were in the lobby, Settembrini turned off into one of the social rooms to read the papers before dinner, as he said. He apparently intended to play hooky from the second rest cure."
"Den jungen Hans Castorp belebte der schöne Morgen. Auch hatten in der Depression seine Seelenkräfte sich heimlich ausgeruht, und klar leuchtete vor seinem Geist die Gewißheit, daß der Augenblick gekommen war, da der Bann, der auf ihm gelegen, gebrochen werden sollte. So griff er aus, den keuchenden, auch sonst widerstrebenden Joachim mit sich ziehend, und vor der Biegung des Weges, wo er eben ward und rechtshin den bewaldeten Hügel entlang führte, hatten sie Frau Chauchat so gut wie erreicht. Da verlangsamte Hans Castorp das Tempo wieder, um nicht in einem von Anstrengung verwilderten Zustand sein Vorhaben auszuführen. Und jenseits des Wegknies, zwischen Abhang und Bergwand, zwischen den rostig gefärbten Fichten, durch deren Zweige Sonnenlichter fielen, trug es sich zu und begab sich wunderbar, daß Hans Castorp, links von Joachim, die liebliche Kranke überholte, daß er mit männlichen Tritten an ihr vorüber ging, und in dem Augenblick, da er sich rechts neben ihr befand, mit einer hutlosen Verneigung und einem mit halber Stimme gesprochenen »Guten Morgen« sie ehrerbietig (wieso eigentlich: ehrerbietig) begrüßte und Antwort von ihr empfing: mit freundlicher, nicht weiter erstaunter Kopfneigung dankte sie, sagte auch ihrerseits guten Morgen in seiner Sprache, wobei ihre Augen lächelten, – und das alles war etwas anderes, etwas gründlich und beseligend anderes als der Blick auf seinen Stiefel, es war ein Glücksfall und eine Wendung der Dinge zum Guten und Allerbesten, ganz beispielloser Art und fast die Fassungskraft überschreitend; es war die Erlösung.","The beautiful morning revived young Hans Castorp. His mental powers had also secretly rested during the depression, and the certainty that the moment had come when the spell that had hung over him was to be broken shone clearly before his mind. So he reached out, dragging the panting, otherwise reluctant Joachim with him, and before the bend in the path, where it leveled off and led to the right along the wooded hill, they had almost reached Frau Chauchat. Then Hans Castorp slowed down again so as not to carry out his project in a state wild with exertion. And on the other side of the bend in the path, between the slope and the mountain wall, between the rusty-colored spruce trees, through whose branches sunlight fell, it happened and happened wonderfully that Hans Castorp, to Joachim's left, overtook the lovely sick woman, that he with manly steps passed her, and the moment he was on her right, with a hatless bow and a half-voiced ""Good morning,"" he greeted her respectfully (why actually: respectfully) and received her answer: kindly, no bowing her head in astonishment, she thanked her, and in turn said good morning in his language, with a smile on her eyes - and all this was something different, something thoroughly and blissfully different from the look at his boot, it was a stroke of luck and a turn of things to the The good and the very best, of an unparalleled nature and almost exceeding one's comprehension; it was salvation.","The lovely morning made Hans Castorp sprightly. And his soul, in that period of black depression, had secretly assembled its powers. He felt a sure intuition that the moment was come to break the ban. He strode on, dragging the panting and reluctant Joachim in his train, and they had as good as overtaken Frau Chauchat, at the point where the path grew level and turned to the right along the wooded hillock. Here the young man slackened his pace, not to be breathless with exertion in the moment of carrying out his purpose. And just beyond the bend in the path, between mountain and precipice, where the sunlight slipped athwart the boughs of the rust-coloured firs, it actually fell out, the wonder came to pass, that Hans Castorp, on Joachim’s left, overtook the fragile fair one, he went by her with a manly stride, and then, at the moment when he was beside her, on her right, greeted her with a profoundly respectful, hatless inclination of the head, and a murmured “good-morning,” to which she answered by a friendly bow, that showed no trace of surprise, and a good-morning in her turn. She said it in Hans Castorp’s mother-tongue, and smiled with her eyes. And all that was something different, something fundamentally and blessedly other than that look she had bent upon his boots—it was a gift of fortune, an unexampled turn in affairs, a joy well-nigh beyond comprehending, it was the blessed release.","Young Hans Castorp felt invigorated by the beautiful morning. In his depressed mood, his inner energies had quietly recovered some strength, too, and his mind was illumined with the clear certainty that the moment had come to break the spell that had been cast over him. And so he stepped on ahead, pulling a gasping and generally reluctant Joachim with him, and by the time they reached the point where the path leveled out and turned off to the right, they had almost pulled even with Frau Chauchat. Hans Castorp now slowed the pace again so that he would not look too outlandish from his exertions when carrying out his plan. And just beyond the dogleg in the path, between slope above and drop-off below, among rusty-hued pines with sunlight filtering through the branches, it happened—everything worked out marvelously. Hans Castorp, walking on Joachim’s left, caught up with his adorable patient and began to pass her on the right with manly strides. At the moment when he was just even with her, he made a hatless bow and whispered, “ Good morning,” in a low voice of reverent greeting (but why “reverent,” really?)—and heard her respond in kind, wishing him good morning in his own language; her eyes smiling, she acknowledged him with a friendly, not particularly surprised nod. And it was all so different, so totally and blissfully different from that glance at his boots —it was a stroke of good fortune, a turn for the better, indeed for the best, an unparalleled event almost beyond comprehension. It was the longed-for release."
"»Gut, damals kamen wir im Plaudern, wie es gottlob des öfteren geschieht, auf höhere Gegenstände. Ich glaube gar, wir sprachen von Tod und Leben, von den Würden des Todes, insofern er Bedingung und Zubehör des Lebens ist, und von der Fratzenhaftigkeit, der er verfällt, wenn der Geist ihn abscheulicherweise als Prinzip isoliert. Meine Herren!« fuhr Herr Settembrini fort, indem er dicht vor die beiden jungen Leute hintrat, Daumen und Mittelfinger der Linken gabelförmig gegen sie spreizte, gleichsam, um sie zur Aufmerksamkeit zusammenzufassen, und den Zeigefinger der Rechten mahnend erhob … »Prägen Sie sich ein, daß der Geist souverän ist, sein Wille ist frei, er bestimmt die sittliche Welt. Isoliert er dualistisch den Tod, so wird derselbe durch diesen geistigen Willen wirklich und in der Tat, actu, Sie verstehen mich, zur eigenen, dem Leben entgegengesetzten Macht, zum widersacherischen Prinzip, zur großen Verführung, und sein Reich ist das der Wollust. Sie fragen mich, warum der Wollust? Ich antworte Ihnen: weil er löst und erlöst, weil er die Erlösung ist, aber nicht {621}die Erlösung vom Übel, sondern die üble Erlösung. Er löst Sitte und Sittlichkeit, er erlöst von Zucht und Haltung, er macht frei zur Wollust. Wenn ich Sie warne vor dem Manne, dessen Bekanntschaft ich Ihnen ungern vermittelte, wenn ich Sie auffordere, im Verkehr und Diskurs mit ihm Ihre Herzen dreimal mit Kritik zu umgürten, so geschieht es, weil alle seine Gedanken wollüstiger Art sind, denn sie stehen unter dem Schutze des Todes, – einer höchst liederlichen Macht, wie ich Ihnen damals sagte, Ingenieur, – ich erinnere mich wohl meines Ausdrucks, ich behalte tüchtige und treffliche Äußerungen, die zu tun ich Gelegenheit fand, stets im Gedächtnis –, einer gegen Gesittung, Fortschritt, Arbeit und Leben gerichteten Macht, vor deren mephitischem Hauch junge Seelen zu schützen des Erziehers vornehmste Pflicht ist.«","“Well, in those days we came to higher subjects in chatting, as often happens, thank God. I even think we spoke of life and death, of the dignities of death insofar as it is a condition and accessory of life, and of the grotesqueness it falls to when the spirit hideously isolates it as a principle. Gentlemen!” continued Mr. Settembrini, stepping close in front of the two young people, spreading the thumb and middle finger of his left hand in a fork towards them, as if to gather them together for attention, and raising the index finger of his right warningly… “Memorize it that the spirit is sovereign, its will is free, it determines the moral world. If he isolates death dualistically, it becomes real through this spiritual will and in fact, actu, you understand me, a power opposed to life, an adversarial principle, a great seduction, and its realm is that of lust. You ask me why the lust? I answer you: because he redeems and redeems, because he is salvation, but not salvation from evil, but evil salvation. It loosens custom and morality, it redeems from discipline and attitude, it frees one to voluptuousness. If I warn you against the man whose acquaintance I was reluctant to introduce you to, if I ask you to gird your hearts with criticism three times in intercourse and discourse with him, it is because all his thoughts are of a lustful nature, for they are submissive the protection of death, - a most slovenly power, as I told you then, engineer - I remember my expression well, I always keep in mind competent and excellent utterances which I found opportunity to make - one against civility, power directed towards progress, work and life, against whose Mephitic breath it is the educator's foremost duty to protect young souls.«","“Good. We fell into talk, as we have often done, I rejoice to say, and upon somewhat elevated subjects. We spoke, I believe, of life and death: of the dignity of death in so far as it is the condition and appurtenance of life, and the grotesqueness into which it declines so soon as the mind erects it into an independent principle. Young men,” went on Herr Settembrini, standing close to the two, with the thumb and middle finger of his left hand splayed out like a fork, as if to collect their attention, while he raised the forefinger of his right in warning, “imprint it upon your minds: the mind is sovereign. Its will is free, it conditions the moral world. Let it once dualistically isolate death, and death will become, in actual fact, actu, by this mental act of will, you understand me, a power in itself, the power opposed to life, the inimical principle, the great temptation; whose kingdom is the kingdom of the flesh. You ask me why of the flesh? I answer you: because it unlooses and delivers, because it is deliverance—yet not deliverance from evil, but deliverance by evil. It relaxes manners and morals, it frees man from discipline and restraint, it abandons him to lust. If I warn you against this man, whose acquaintance with you I have unwillingly brought about, if I exhort you to go thrice-armed with a critical spirit in all your dealings with him, it is because all his thoughts are voluptuous, and stand under the ægis of death—and death is the most dissolute of powers, as I told you then, Engineer—I well remember my words, for I never fail to retain in my mind any good and telling phrase I may have chanced to avail myself of—a power hostile to civilization and progress, to work and to life, against whose mephitic breath it is the noblest task of the teacher to shield the mind of youth.”","“Good. And we started to chat—as happens frequently, thank God—about higher things. I believe, in fact, we spoke about life and death, about the dignity of death, to the extent that it is a constituent and prerequisite of life, and about how it can degenerate into something grotesque if we commit the abominable error of isolating it as an intellectual principle. Gentlemen,” Herr Settembrini continued now, stepping very near to the young men, spreading the thumb and middle finger of his left hand into a wide fork, as if to concentrate their attention, and raising the forefinger of his right hand in warning, “imprint this on your minds: the intellect is sovereign, its will is free, it defines the moral world. If it isolates death in a dualistic fashion, then by that act of intellectual will, death becomes real in actual fact—actu, do you understand? It becomes a force of its own opposed to life, an antagonistic principle, the great seduction—and its kingdom is lust. And why lust, you ask? And I reply: Because it loosens and delivers, because it is a deliverance, and not deliverance from evil, but evil deliverance. It loosens morals and morality, it delivers from discipline and self-control, liberates for lust. In warning you about this man, with whom I have unwillingly made you acquainted, in demanding that you gird yourselves three times round with a critical spirit when you are dealing with him and discussing things, I do so because all his thoughts are of lust; they stand under the aegis of death, a most depraved force—just as I told you that day, my good engineer, I very clearly recall using that phrase, for I always keep in mind useful and apt words I have used on occasion—a most depraved force directed against morals, progress, labor, and life. And it is the sublime duty of the pedagogue to defend young souls against its mephitic breath.”"
"Auch Hans Castorp schwieg denn also. In seinem Plumeau sitzend, wandte er den Kopf zur Wand und trommelte leicht mit den Fingerspitzen auf der Steppdecke. Er kam sich belehrt, zurechtgewiesen, ja gescholten vor, und in seinem Schweigen lag viel kindliche Verstocktheit. Die Gesprächspause dauerte ziemlich lange.","So Hans Castorp was also silent. Sitting in his plumeau, he turned his head to the wall and lightly drummed his fingertips on the quilt. He felt instructed, rebuked, even scolded, and there was much childish obduracy in his silence. The pause in the conversation lasted quite a long time.","Hans Castorp too preserved silence. He leaned back in his plumeau, turned his head to the wall, and drummed with his finger-ends on the coverlet. He felt set to rights, chidden, corrected; in his silence there was no little childish obstinacy. The pause lasted some time.","Hans Castorp was silent, too. Sitting up against his pillows, he turned his face toward the wall and drummed his fingertips lightly on his comforter. He felt he had been lectured to, corrected, even scolded, and there was a great deal of childish sullenness in his silence. This pause continued for some time."
"Wunderlich hin und her laufende Beziehungen! Es reizt uns, ihre verschlungenen Fäden einen Augenblick allgemein sichtbar zu machen, so, wie Hans Castorp selbst sie auf diesen Spa{878}ziergängen verschmitzten und lebensfreundlichen Auges betrachtete. Da war der elende Wehsal, der Frau Chauchats schwelend begehrte und Peeperkorn und Hans Castorp niedrig verehrte, den einen um der herrschenden Gegenwart, den anderen um der Vergangenheit willen. Da war Clawdia Chauchat ihrerseits, die anmutig weich schreitende Kranke und Reisende, die Hörige Peeperkorns, und zwar gewiß aus Überzeugung, gleichwohl aber immer etwas beunruhigt und innerlich spitzig, den Ritter einer fernen Faschingsnacht auf so gutem Fuße mit ihrem Gebieter zu sehen. Erinnerte diese Irritation nicht in etwas an diejenige, die ihr Verhältnis zu Herrn Settembrini bestimmte? Zu diesem Schönredner und Humanisten, den sie nicht leiden konnte und den sie hochmütig und unmenschlich nannte? Zu des jungen Hans Castorp erzieherischem Freunde, den sie gar zu gern darüber zur Rede gestellt hätte, was für Worte es gewesen seien, die er in seinem mediterranen Idiom, wovon sie so wenig eine Silbe verstand wie er von dem ihren, nur mit weniger sicherer Geringschätzung, dem konvenablen jungen Deutschen nachgesandt hatte, diesem hübschen kleinen Bourgeois von guter Familie und mit einer feuchten Stelle, als er damals im Begriffe gewesen war, sich ihr zu nähern? Hans Castorp, verliebt, wie man zu sagen pflegt »über beide Ohren«, doch nicht im vergnügten Sinn dieser Redensart, sondern so, wie man liebt, wenn der Fall verboten und unvernünftig liegt und sich keine friedlichen kleinen Lieder des Flachlandes darauf singen lassen, – arg verliebt also und damit abhängig, unterworfen, leidend und dienend, war doch der Mann, in der Sklaverei sich hinlängliche Verschmitztheit zu bewahren, um ganz gut zu wissen, welchen Wert seine Ergebenheit für die schleichende Kranke mit den bezaubernden Tatarenschlitzen etwa haben und behalten mochte: einen Wert, auf den sie, wie er bei sich in aller leidenden Unterworfenheit hinzufügte, aufmerksam gemacht werden konnte durch das Verhalten Herrn {879}Settembrinis zu ihr, das ihren Argwohn nur zu offen bestätigte, nämlich so ablehnend war, wie humanistische Höflichkeit es nur irgend gestattete. Das Schlimme, oder, in Hans Castorps Augen, eher Vorteilhafte war, daß sie in ihren Beziehungen zu Leo Naphta, auf die sie doch Hoffnungen gesetzt, die rechte Entschädigung auch nicht fand. Zwar stieß sie hier nicht auf jene grundsätzliche Verneinung, die Herr Lodovico ihrem Wesen entgegensetzte, und die Gesprächsbedingungen lagen günstiger: sie unterhielten sich zuweilen gesondert, Clawdia und der scharfe Kleine, über Bücher, über Probleme der politischen Philosophie, in deren radikaler Behandlung sie übereinstimmten; und Hans Castorp nahm treuherzig teil daran. Aber eine gewisse aristokratische Einschränkung des Entgegenkommens, das der Emporkömmling, vorsichtig wie alle Emporkömmlinge, ihr bezeigte, mochte ihr doch bemerklich werden; sein spanischer Terrorismus stimmte im Grunde mit ihrer türenwerfend vagierenden »Mähnschlichkeit« wenig überein; und hinzu kam als Letztes und Feinstes eine leichte, schwer greifbare Gehässigkeit, die sie mit weiblichem Spürsinn von seiten beider Widersacher, Settembrinis und Naphtas, sich mußte entgegenwehen fühlen (so gut, wie ihr Faschingsritter selber sie wehen fühlte), und die ihren Grund in den Beziehungen beider zu ihm, Hans Castorp, hatte: die Mißstimmung des Erziehers gegen die Frau als störendes und ablenkendes Element, diese stille und ursprüngliche Gegnerschaft, die sie vereinigte, weil ihre pädagogisch verdichtete Zwietracht sich darin aufhob.","Whimsical back and forth relationships! We are tempted to make their intertwined threads generally visible for a moment, just as Hans Castorp himself observed them on these walks with a mischievous and life-loving eye. There was the wretched sorrow that smoldered in Frau Chauchat's lust and despised Peeperkorn and Hans Castorp, one for the sake of the prevailing present, the other for the sake of the past. There was Clawdia Chauchat in her turn, the gracefully soft-striding invalid and traveller, Peeperkorn's thrall, and indeed out of conviction, but always a little disturbed and inwardly sharp, to see the knight of a far-off Mardi Gras night on such good terms with her master. Wasn't that irritation somewhat reminiscent of the one that characterized her relationship with Mr. Settembrini? To this smooth talker and humanist whom she disliked and whom she called arrogant and inhuman? To the educational friend of young Hans Castorp, whom she would have liked to confront about what kind of words he had used in his Mediterranean idiom, of which she understood as little as a syllable as he understood hers, only with less certainty Contempt that the agreeable young German had forwarded, that pretty little bourgeois of good family and with a wet spot, when he was then about to approach her? Hans Castorp, in love, as they say, ""over both ears,"" not in the merry sense of this expression, but in the way one loves when the case is forbidden and unreasonable and no peaceful little songs of the lowlands can be sung to it, – so badly in love and therefore dependent, submissive, suffering and serving, was the man who in slavery retained sufficient mischievousness to know quite well what value his devotion to the creeping patient with the enchanting Tartar slits have and keep liked: a value to which, as he added to himself in all suffering submission, she could be made aware by Mr. {879}Settembrini's behavior towards her, which only too openly confirmed her suspicions, namely, was as dismissive as humanistic politeness only allowed it. The bad thing, or, in Hans Castorp's eyes, rather the good thing, was that she didn't find the right compensation in her relationship with Leo Naphta, on which she had pinned her hopes. It is true that she did not encounter that fundamental negation that Herr Lodovico opposed to her nature, and the conditions for the conversation were more favorable: they sometimes talked separately, Clawdia and the sharp little one, about books, about problems of political philosophy, in the radical treatment of which they agreed ; and Hans Castorp faithfully took part in it. But she might notice a certain aristocratic restraint in the courtesy which the upstart, cautious like all upstarts, showed her; his Spanish terrorism basically had little in common with their flamboyant ""similarity""; And last but not least, there was a light, hard-to-grasp spitefulness, which she had to feel countered with feminine intuition on the part of both adversaries, Settembrini and Naphtas (as good as her carnival knight himself felt it countered), and which had its reason in The relationship between the two of them to him, Hans Castorp, had: the educator's dissatisfaction with the woman as a disturbing and distracting element, this quiet and original opposition that united them because their pedagogically concentrated discord was dissolved in it.","Again, how involved were the relations between the various members of our group! Let us con them a little, as Hans Castorp himself did, with shrewd, yet friendly eye, as they went their ways together. There was the unhappy Wehsal, consumed by his louring passion for Frau Chauchat; who grovelled before Peeperkorn and Hans Castorp, the one on grounds of the past, the other for the sake of the compelling present. And there was Clavdia Chauchat herself, charming, soft-stepping invalid, the property of Peeperkorn—surely by choice and conviction, yet uneasy and sharptongued to see her carnival cavalier on such good terms with her sovereign lord. The irritation was probably the same in kind as that which coloured her feeling toward Herr Settembrini, the humanist and haranguer, whom she could not abide, calling him arrogant, not “hu— man.” Dearly would she have liked to ask this mentor of Hans Castorp’s the meaning of certain words in his own Mediterranean tongue, of which, though less contemptuously, she was as ignorant as he of hers: the words he had flung after the altogether nice young German, quite correct and of good family, on that carnival night when at length he had summoned courage to approach her.—Hans Castorp was in love up to his ears, so much was true; not in the accepted blissful sense, but as one loves when the case is out of all reason, and cannot be celebrated in any pretty little flat-land ditties we know of. He was badly smitten, quite subjugated, endured all the orthodox pangs; yet was the man to retain, even in his slavery, a certain sense of proportion, which told him that his devotion was worth something to the fair one with the Tartar eyes; not too blind in his abasement to measure its worth by Settembrini’s own attitude toward her. The Italian was as distant as the dictates of humanistic courtesy would permit; while she was only too obviously piqued by his bearing. The position with regard to Leo Naphta was scarcely more—or, from Hans Castorp’s point of view, scarcely less—favourable. True, there was here no fundamental antagonism such as set Herr Ludovico’s being against hers and all its works. Also, the language difficulty was less, and they sometimes strolled and talked apart, Clavdia and the knife-edged little man; discussed books, and questions of political philosophy, upon which both held radical views. Hans Castorp, in his simplicity, would sometimes take part. Yet Frau Chauchat could not but be aware of a certain haughty aloofness in Naphta’s bearing. Its source was the caution of the parvenu, a feeling of insecurity in this unfamiliar society. But in truth his Spanish terrorism had little in common with her roving, door-slamming, all-too-human humanity. And there was moreover the subtle, scarcely perceptible animosity felt by both pedagogues on the score of this disturbing female element that came between them and their fledgling, and united them in an unspoken, primitive hostility, at least as potent as their long-standing conflict with each other. If Hans Castorp was aware of these sentiments they could hardly escape his charmer’s feminine intuition.","What a strange interweaving of relationships it was! We are intrigued by the idea of making that tangle of threads visible to all for just a moment, much as Hans Castorp himself was able to observe it with a shrewd and life-affirming eye on their walks together. There was miserable Wehsal, whose desire for Frau Chauchat continued to smolder and who humbly revered Peeperkorn and Hans Castorp, the former for his command of the present, the latter for events in the past. There was Clavdia Chauchat herself, that charming, softly treading patient and traveler, who was Peeperkorn’s vassal, by choice and conviction, to be sure—yet the sight of a cavalier from a long-ago Mardi Gras night on such good terms with her lord and master always made her somewhat uneasy, honing her emotions to a point. But was not the annoyance she felt in this regard somehow reminiscent of her relationship to Settembrini, young Hans Castorp’s pedagogic friend? To that eloquent orator and humanist, whom she could not stand and called arrogant and inhumane? How she would have loved to have confronted him and demanded to know what those words (spoken in his Mediterranean tongue, of which she understood not a syllable more than he of hers, though with none of his supercilious contempt)—what those words had been that he had called after the agreeable young German, just as the lad was about to approach her that night, this pretty little bourgeois lad who came from a good family and had a moist spot? Hans Castorp—“head over heels in love,” as people say, and yet not in the happy sense of the idiom, but as one loves when it is forbidden and unreasonable, when there are no calm little songs from the flatlands to be sung, terribly in love, dependent, subjugated, suffering and serving—was nevertheless a man who remained shrewd enough amid his slavery to know exactly what his devotion was worth, and would continue to be worth, to the slinking patient with the enchanting “Tartar slits”; and she could be constantly reminded of its worth, or so he told himself despite his suffering subjugation, by the behavior of Herr Settembrini, who only too openly confirmed her own suspicions by attitudes as dismissive toward her as humanistic courtesy allowed. The worst pan—or, in Hans Castorp’s eyes, the best—was that she did not find any real compensation, either, in her relationship to Leo Naphta, in whom she had set some hope. Granted, she did not have to deal here with Herr Lodovico’s fundamental repudiation of her character, and the essentials for conversation were somewhat more favorable, so that the two of them, Clavdia and the caustic little man, would sometimes move away from the others to talk: about books, about questions of political philosophy, where they found agreement in radical answers; and Hans Castorp sometimes ingenuously joined in as well. Yet she could not help noticing that the parvenu, being a cautious man like all parvenus, showed a certain aristocratic restraint toward her; his Spanish terrorism ultimately had little in common with her own door-slamming, vagabonding “humaneness.” And last and subtlest of all, there was a gentle malice that was hard to define, but which she, with a woman’s heightened awareness, surely had to feel drifting toward her from both adversaries, Settembrini and Naphta (and indeed her Mardi Gras cavalier felt it as well), and which had its origin in their relationship to Hans Castorp: the pedagogue’s inherent ill will toward women as a disruptive and distracting element, a silent and primal hostility that united the two men by abrogating their intense pedagogic rivalry."
"»Sicuro, – wenn es sich dabei um die respektable Leidenschaft der Welterprobung handelt und nicht um Liederlichkeit. Sie sprachen von ›Hybris‹, Sie bedienten sich dieses Ausdrucks. Aber die Hybris der Vernunft gegen die dunklen Gewalten ist höchste Menschlichkeit, und beschwört sie die Rache neidischer Götter herauf, per esempio, indem die Luxusarche scheitert und senkrecht in die Tiefe geht, so ist das ein Untergang in Ehren. Auch die Tat des Prometheus war Hybris, und seine Qual am skythischen Felsen gilt uns als heiligstes Martyrium.

The act of Prometheus was also hubris, and his torment on the Scythian rock is our most sacred martyrdom.

Der große Stumpfsinn,The big stupid,The Great God Dumps,THE GREAT STUPOR
"Von Trauer zu reden, wäre Schönfärberei, doch zeigten Hans Castorps Augen in jenen Tagen immerhin einen Ausdruck, der sinnender war als gewöhnlich. Dieser Sterbefall, dessen Gefühlsbedeutung niemals mächtig gewesen wäre und durch abenteuerliche Jährchen der Entfremdung auf fast nichts herabgemindert worden war, er kam doch dem Zerreißen noch {1074}einer Bindung, noch einer Beziehung zur unteren Sphäre gleich, gab dem, was Hans Castorp mit Recht die Freiheit nannte, letzte Vollständigkeit. Wirklich war in der späten Zeit, von der wir sprechen, jede Fühlung zwischen ihm und dem Flachlande restlos aufgehoben. Er schrieb keine Briefe dorthin und empfing keine. Er bezog Maria Mancini nicht mehr von dort. Er hatte hier oben eine Marke gefunden, die ihm zusagte, und der er nun ebenso Treue trug wie einst jener Freundin: ein Fabrikat, das selbst dem Polarforscher im Eise über die ärgsten Strapazen hinweggeholfen hätte, und mit dem versehen, man einfach wie am Meere lag und es aushalten konnte, – eine besonders gut gepflegte Sandblattzigarre, namens »Rütlischwur«, etwas gedrungener, als Maria, mausgrau von Farbe, mit einem bläulichen Leibring, sehr fügsam und mild im Charakter und zu schneeweißer, haltbarer Asche, in welcher die Adern des Deckblattes stehen blieben, so gleichmäßig sich verzehrend, daß sie dem Genießenden statt einer fließenden Sanduhr hätte dienen können und ihm nach seinen Bedürfnissen auch so diente, denn seine Taschenuhr trug er nicht mehr. Sie stand, sie war ihm eines Tages vom Nachttisch gefallen, und er hatte davon abgesehen, sie wieder in messenden Rundlauf setzen zu lassen, – aus denselben Gründen, weshalb er auch auf den Besitz von Kalendern, sei es zum täglichen Abreißen, sei es zur Vorbelehrung über den Fall der Tage und Feste, schon längst verzichtet hatte: aus Gründen der »Freiheit« also, dem Strandspaziergange, dem stehenden Immer-und-Ewig zu Ehren, diesem hermetischen Zauber, für den der Entrückte sich aufnahmelustig erwiesen, und der das Grundabenteuer seiner Seele gewesen, dasjenige, worin alle alchymistischen Abenteuer dieses schlichten Stoffes sich abgespielt hatten.","To speak of grief would be glossing over it, but at least in those days Hans Castorp's eyes showed an expression that was more pensive than usual. This death, whose emotional significance would never have been powerful and had been reduced to almost nothing by adventurous years of estrangement, it was tantamount to the tearing of another bond, another relationship to the lower sphere, gave what Hans Castorp rightly called freedom, ultimate completeness. In fact, in the late period of which we are speaking, all contact between him and the lowlands was completely abolished. He wrote no letters there and received none. He no longer referred Maria Mancini from there. He had found a brand up here that appealed to him, and to which he was now just as faithful as that girlfriend once was: a make that would have helped even the polar explorer in the ice over the worst hardships, and provided with it, you just like at sea lay and could endure it, - a particularly well cared for sand leaf cigar, called ""Rütlischwur"", somewhat stockier than Maria, mouse-grey in color, with a bluish body ring, very docile and mild in character and to snow-white, durable ash, in which the veins of the wrapper, consuming itself so evenly that it could have served the connoisseur instead of a flowing hourglass and served him according to his needs, because he no longer wore his pocket watch. It stood, it had fallen off his bedside table one day, and he had refrained from having it put back into measuring circulation - for the same reasons that he also insisted on the possession of calendars, be it for daily tearing off, be it for preliminary instruction about the fall of the days and festivals, had long since renounced: for reasons of ""freedom,"" that is, the walk on the beach, in honor of the standing forever and ever, this hermetic magic, for which the enraptured proved to be receptive, and who that The basic adventure of his soul was that in which all the alchemical adventures of this simple substance took place.","To speak of sorrow would be disingenuous. Yet in these days Hans Castorp’s eyes did wear an expression more musing than common. This death, which could at no time have moved him greatly, and after the lapse of years could scarcely move him at all, meant the sundering of yet another bond with the life below; gave to what he rightly called his freedom the final seal. In the time of which we speak, all contact between him and the flat-land had ceased. He sent no letters thither, and received none thence. He no longer ordered Maria Mancini, having found a brand up here to his liking, to which he was now as faithful as once to his old-time charmer: a brand that must have carried even a polar explorer through the sorest and severest trials; armed with which, and no other solace, Hans Castorp could lie and bear it out indefinitely, as one does at the sea-shore. It was an especially well cured brand, with the best leaf wrapper, named “Light of Asia”; rather more compact than Maria, mouse-grey in colour with a blue band, very tractable and mild, and evenly consuming to a snow-white ash, that held its shape and still showed traces of the veining on the wrapper; so evenly and regularly that it might have served the smoker for an hour-glass, and did so, at need, for he no longer carried a timepiece. His watch had fallen from his night-table; it did not go, and he had neglected to have it regulated, perhaps on the same grounds as had made him long since give up using a calendar, whether to keep track of the day, or to look out an approaching feast: the grounds, namely, of his “freedom.” Thus he did honour to his abiding-everlasting, his walk by the ocean of time, the hermetic enchantment to which he had proved so extraordinarily susceptible that it had become the fundamental adventure of his life, in which all the alchemistical processes of his simple substance had found full play.","It would be disingenuous to speak of mourning, but all the same, for a while the expression in Hans Castorp’s eyes was more pensive than usual. This death, which would never have been of great emotional consequence to Hans Castorp—and indeed after an estrangement of so many adventurous little years, all emotional content had been reduced to almost nothing—seemed to him nevertheless very like the breaking of yet another tie, a last connection, to the world below, bringing to perfection what he so rightly called his freedom. In truth, in the recent past of which we speak, there had been a total abrogation of every emotional bond between him and the flatlands. He wrote and received no letters. He no longer ordered his Maria Mancinis from there. He had found another brand up here, one that suited him and to which he was now as faithful as he had once been to his former girlfriend—a brand that would even have helped polar explorers get over their worst hardships in the ice and that when you smoked it made you feel as if you were lying on the beach and would be able to carry on. It had an especially well cured wrapper and was named Oath of Rütli; somewhat stubbier than Maria, mouse gray in color with a bluish band, it was very tractable and mild by nature; it had a snow-white durable ash that still showed the veins of the wrapper. It drew so evenly that it could easily have served as an hourglass for the man enjoying it, and indeed, given Hans Castorp’s needs, did serve as such, for he no longer carried his pocket watch. It had stopped, having fallen from his nightstand one day, and he had refrained from having it put into measuring rotation again—for the same reasons he had long ago dispensed with calendars, whether the kind you tear off each day or the kind that provide an instructive preview of days and feasts, for reasons of “freedom,” that is. It was his way of honoring the stroll by the shore, the abiding ever-and-always, the hermetic magic, to which, once withdrawn from the world, he had proved so susceptible—the magic that had been his soul’s fundamental adventure, in which all the alchemistic adventures of that simple stuff had been played out."
"»Tempo, Tempo«, sagte er und richtete seine quellenden Augen auf die Wanduhr. »Un poco più presto, Signori! Wir sind nicht ganz ausschließlich für Eure Hochwohlgeboren vorhanden.«","""Tempo, Tempo,"" he said, turning his bulging eyes to the clock on the wall. ""Un poco più presto, Signori! We do not exist entirely exclusively for your Highness.'","“Tempo, tempo,” said he, directing his goggling gaze to the clock on the wall. “Un poco piu presto, signori!

"Dann schien es dem Träumenden, als befinde er sich auf dem Schulhof, wo er so viele Jahre hindurch die Pausen zwischen den Unterrichtsstunden verbracht, und sei im Begriffe, sich von Madame Chauchat, die ebenfalls zugegen war, einen Bleistift zu leihen. Sie gab ihm den rotgefärbten, nur noch halblangen in einem silbernen Crayon steckenden Stift, indem sie Hans Castorp mit angenehm heiserer Stimme ermahnte, ihn ihr nach der Stunde bestimmt zurückzugeben, und als sie ihn ansah, mit ihren schmalen blaugraugrünen Augen über den breiten Backenknochen, da riß er sich gewaltsam aus dem Traum empor, denn nun hatte er es und wollte es festhalten, woran und an wen sie ihn eigentlich so lebhaft erinnerte. Eilig brachte er die Erkenntnis für morgen in Sicherheit, denn er fühlte, daß Schlaf und Traum ihn wieder umfingen, und sah sich alsbald in der Lage, Zuflucht vor Dr. Krokowski suchen zu müssen, der ihm nachstellte, um Seelenzergliederung mit ihm vorzunehmen, wovor Hans Castorp eine tolle, eine wahrhaft unsinnige Angst empfand. Er floh vor dem Doktor behinderten Fußes an den Glaswänden vorbei durch die Balkonlogen, {141}sprang mit Gefahr seines Lebens in den Garten hinab, suchte in seiner Not sogar die rotbraune Flaggenstange zu erklettern und erwachte schwitzend in dem Augenblick, als der Verfolger ihn am Hosenbein packte.","Then it seemed to the dreaming that he was in the schoolyard, where he had spent the breaks between lessons for so many years, and was about to borrow a pencil from Madame Chauchat, who was also present. She gave him the red-colored pen, which was only half a length in a silver crayon, admonishing Hans Castorp in a pleasantly hoarse voice to give it back to her after the lesson, and when she looked at him with her narrow blue-grey-green eyes over the broad cheekbones, then he pulled himself violently out of the dream, because now he had it and wanted to hold on to what and who she actually reminded him of so vividly. He hurriedly brought the knowledge to safety for tomorrow, for he felt that sleep and dreams were enfolding him again, and was soon able to seek refuge from Dr. Having to look for Krokowski, who was after him in order to dissect his soul, which made Hans Castorp feel a mad, truly senseless fear. He fled from the doctor with a disabled foot, past the glass walls through the balcony boxes, {141}jumped down into the garden at the risk of his life, in his distress even tried to climb the reddish-brown flagpole and woke up sweating the moment his pursuer caught him pant leg grabbed.","Then it seemed to the dreamer that he was in the school courtyard, where for so many years through he had spent his recesses, and was in the act of borrowing a leadpencil from Madame Chauchat, who seemed to be there too. She gave him a halflength red pencil in a silver holder, and warned him in an agreeable, husky voice to be sure to return it to her after the hour. And as she looked at him—with her narrow, blue-grey eyes above the broad cheek-bones—he tore himself by violence away from his dream, for now he had it fast and meant to hold it, of what and whom she so vividly reminded him. Hastily he fixed this occurrence in his mind, to have it fast for the morrow. Then sleep and dream once more overpowered him, and he saw himself in the act of flight from Dr. Krokowski, who had lain in wait for him to undertake some psychoanalysis. He fled from the doctor, but his feet were leaden; past the glass partitions, along the balconies, into the garden; in his extremity he tried to climb the red-brown flagstaff—and woke perspiring at the moment when the pursuer seized him by his trouser-leg.","And now as he dreamed on, it seemed to him that he was in the same schoolyard where he had spent his recesses for so many years, and he was just about to borrow a drawing pencil from Madame Chauchat, who also happened to be present. She gave him a reddish one, about half the normal length, in a silver holder, but at the same time she warned Hans Castorp in a pleasantly husky voice that he definitely had to give it back to her after class, and looked at him with her narrow, bluish-gray-green eyes set above broad cheekbones, and he tore himself out of his dream—because he had it now and wanted to hold on to it: the person and situation that she had so vividly reminded him of. He quickly made sure he would remember it the next morning, because he could feel sleep and dreams enfolding him again; and he soon realized that he was trying to get away from Dr. Krokowski, who was lying in ambush for him in hope of subjecting his psyche to dissection, which aroused in Hans Castorp wild, truly mad terror. His foot was injured and he limped as he fled from the doctor down along the balconies, squeezing past the glass partitions, and he took a possibly fatal leap down into the garden and in his distress tried to climb the reddish-brown flagpole—and woke up in a sweat just as his pursuer grabbed him by the trouser leg."
»Und Sie lieben Madame?« fragte Mynheer plötzlich und wandte dem Besucher sein Königsantlitz mit dem weh zerrissenen Munde und den kleinen blassen Augen unter dem Stirnarabeskenwerk zu … Hans Castorp erschrak. Er stammelte:,"""And you love Madame?"" asked Mynheer suddenly, turning his kingly visage with the torn mouth and the small pale eyes under the forehead arabesque work to the visitor... Hans Castorp was startled. He stammered:","“And you love Madame?” Mynheer suddenly asked. He turned toward his visitor that kingly countenance, with the sore, writhen mouth and the pale little eyes under the arabesque of lines on the brow. Hans Castorp started. He stammered: “I—that is—I feel great respect for Frau Chauchat, certainly, in her character as—”","“And you love Madame, do you not?” Mynheer suddenly asked, turning toward his guest a regal countenance with painfully ragged lips and pale little eyes under a brow full of arabesques. In his shock, Hans Castorp stammered, “You asked if—that is—but of course I respect Frau Chauchat in her position as—”"
"Joachim wußte das nicht. Sie legten ab und betraten zum zweiten Male den Speisesaal, wo die Mahlzeit schon wieder in vollem Gange war.","Joachim didn't know that. They cast off and entered the dining room for the second time, where the meal was already in full swing.","Joachim did not know. They entered the dining-room, where the meal was again in full swing.","Joachim did not know. They hung up their coats and for the second time today they entered the dining hall, where the meal was in full swing."
"{42}Senator Castorp war hager und hochgewachsen. Die Jahre hatten ihm Rücken und Nacken gekrümmt, aber er suchte die Krümmung durch Gegendruck auszugleichen, wobei sein Mund, dessen Lippen nicht mehr von Zähnen gehalten wurden, sondern unmittelbar auf dem leeren Zahnfleisch ruhten (denn sein Gebiß legte er nur zum Essen an), sich auf würdig-mühsame Art nach unten zog, und hierdurch eben, wie auch wohl als Mittel gegen eine beginnende Unfestigkeit des Kopfes, kam die ehrenstreng aufgeruckte Haltung und Kinnstütze zustande, die dem kleinen Hans Castorp so zusagte.","{42}Senator Castorp was thin and tall. The years had curved his back and neck, but he tried to correct the curve by counter-pressure, his mouth, whose lips were no longer held by teeth but rested directly on empty gums (for he only used his teeth to eat), pulled himself down in a dignified, tedious way, and through this, as well as a remedy against an incipient infirmity of the head, the upright posture and chin rest came about, which little Hans Castorp so liked.","Senator Castorp was tall and lean. The years had bent his back and neck, but he tried to counteract the curvature by pressure in another direction; drawing down his mouth with sedulous dignity, though the lips were shrunken against the bare gums, for he had lost all his teeth, and put in the false ones only to eat. It was this posture also which helped to steady an incipient shaking of the head, gave him his look of being sternly reined up, and caused him to support his chin on his neckcloth in the manner so congenial to little Hans Castorp’s taste.","Senator Castorp was tall and gaunt. The years had bent his back and neck, but he attempted to compensate for this by pressing against the curvature, which pulled down the corners of his mouth in a kind of painful dignity, while the lips, with no supporting teeth behind them, rested on bare gums—he wore his dentures only to eat—and this counterpressure, which presumably also helped him steady his head (because it had begun to shake of late), was probably what caused him to carry himself with an austere, forward tilt and to prop his chin in the way that so pleased little Hans."
"»Wir müssen nun aber in die Liegekur«, sagte Joachim besonnen.","""But now we have to take a rest cure,"" said Joachim calmly.","“I think,” Joachim said thoughtfully, “that we ought to be going to lie down.”","“We must return to our rest cure, however,” Joachim said circumspectly."
"Hans Castorp trat vor, um ein paar davon auf seinen Ärmel fallen zu lassen und sie mit den Kenneraugen des Liebhaberforschers zu betrachten. Sie schienen formlose Fetzchen, aber er hatte mehr als einmal ihresgleichen unter seiner guten Linse gehabt und wußte wohl, aus was für zierlichst genauen kleinen Kostbarkeiten sie sich zusammensetzten, Kleinodien, Ordenssternen, Brillantagraffen, wie der getreueste Juwelier sie nicht reicher und minuziöser hätte herstellen können, – ja, es hatte mit all diesem leichten, lockeren Puderweiß, das in Massen den Wald beschwerte, das Gebreite bedeckte, und über das seine {723}Fußbretter ihn trugen, denn doch eine andere Bewandtnis als mit dem heimischen Meersande, an den es erinnerte: das waren bekanntlich nicht Steinkörner, woraus es bestand, es waren Myriaden im Erstarren zu ebenmäßiger Vielfalt kristallisch zusammengeschossener Wasserteilchen, – Teilchen eben der anorganischen Substanz, die auch das Lebensplasma, den Pflanzen-, den Menschenleib quellen machte, – und unter den Myriaden von Zaubersternchen in ihrer untersichtigen, dem Menschenauge nicht zugedachten, heimlichen Kleinpracht war nicht eines dem anderen gleich; eine endlose Erfindungslust in der Abwandlung und allerfeinsten Ausgestaltung eines und immer desselben Grundschemas, des gleichseitig-gleichwinkligen Sechsecks, herrschte da; aber in sich selbst war jedes der kalten Erzeugnisse von unbedingtem Ebenmaß und eisiger Regelmäßigkeit, ja, dies war das Unheimliche, Widerorganische und Lebensfeindliche daran; sie waren zu regelmäßig, die zum Leben geordnete Substanz war es niemals in diesem Grade, dem Leben schauderte vor der genauen Richtigkeit, es empfand sie als tödlich, als das Geheimnis des Todes selbst, und Hans Castorp glaubte zu verstehen, warum Tempelbaumeister der Vorzeit absichtlich und insgeheim kleine Abweichungen von der Symmetrie in ihren Säulenordnungen angebracht hatten.","Hans Castorp stepped forward to let a few fall onto his sleeve and examine them with the expert eyes of the amateur researcher. They seemed shapeless scraps, but he had had more than one of their kind under his good lens and knew well what delicate, precise little treasures they were composed of, gems, medals, diamonds, such as the most faithful jeweler could not have produced more richly and meticulously , - yes, with all this light, fluffy powdery white that weighed down the forest in masses, covered the area, and over which its {723}footboards carried it, it had a different meaning than with the native sea sand, to which it remembered: as is well known, those were not stone grains what it consisted of, they were myriads of water particles solidifying into an even variety of crystals shot together - particles of precisely the inorganic substance that also made the life plasma, the plant, the human body swell - and among the myriads of magic asterisks in their inscrutable, secret splendor not intended for the human eye was not one like the other; there was an endless love of invention in the modification and finest development of one and always the same basic scheme, the equilateral hexagon of equal angles; but in itself each of the cold products was of unconditional symmetry and icy regularity, yes, this was the uncanny, contradictory and life-hostile thing about it; they were too regular, the substance arranged for life was never to this degree, life shuddered at the exact correctness, it felt it to be deadly, as the secret of death itself, and Hans Castorp thought he understood why temple builders of the past deliberately and had secretly introduced small deviations from symmetry in their column orders.","Hans Castorp put out his arm and let some of them come to rest on his sleeve; he viewed them with the knowing eye of the nature-lover. They looked mere shapeless morsels; but he had more than once had their like under his good lens, and was aware of the exquisite precision of form displayed by these little jewels, insignia, orders, agraffes— no jeweller, however skilled, could do finer, more minute work. Yes, he thought, there was a difference, after all, between this light, soft, white powder he trod with his skis, that weighed down the trees, and covered the open spaces, a difference between it and the sand on the beaches at home, to which he had likened it. For this powder was not made of tiny grains of stone; but of myriads of tiniest drops of water, which in freezing had darted together in symmetrical variation—parts, then, of the same anorganic substance which was the source of protoplasm, of plant life, of the human body. And among these myriads of enchanting little stars, in their hidden splendour that was too small for man’s naked eye to see , there was not one like unto another; an endless inventiveness governed the development and unthinkable differentiation of one and the same basic scheme, the equilateral, equiangled hexagon. Yet each, in itself—this was the uncanny, the anti-organic, the life-denying character of them all—each of them was absolutely symmetrical, icily regular in form. They were too regular, as substance adapted to life never was to this degree—the living principle shuddered at this perfect precision, found it deathly, the very marrow of death —Hans Castorp felt he understood now the reason why the builders of antiquity purposely and secretly introduced minute variation from absolute symmetry in their columnar structures.","Hans Castorp stepped out from under the tree to let a few fall on his sleeve and to examine them with the connoisseur’s expert eye. They looked like shapeless tatters, but more than once he had held his good magnifying glass up to them and knew that they were collections of dainty, precise little jewels: gemstones, star insignia, diamond brooches— no skilled jeweler could have produced more delicate miniatures. Yes, there was something special about this light, loose, powdery white stuff that weighed down the trees, covered the breadth of the land, and carried him along on his skis, something that made it different from the sand on the shore at home, of which it had reminded him. It was not made up of tiny grains of rock, but, as everyone knew, consisted of myriads of water droplets, violently gathered up and frozen into manifold, symmetrical crystals—little pieces of an inorganic substance, the wellspring of protoplasm, of plants and human beings; and among all those myriads of magical stars in their secret, minuscule splendor never intended for the human eye, no two were alike. It was all the result of an endless delight in invention, in the subtlest variation and embellishment of one basic design: the equilateral, equiangular hexagon. And yet absolute symmetry and icy regularity characterized each item of cold inventory. Yes, that was what was so eerie —it was anti-organic, hostile to life itself. Snowflakes were too regular; when put into the service of life, the same substance was never so regular as that. Life shuddered at such perfect precision, regarded it as something deadly, as the secret of death itself; and Hans Castorp thought he understood why the architects of ancient temples had intentionally and covertly built little deviations from symmetry into their rows of columns."
"Donnerwetter, dachte Hans Castorp bestürzt und beschämt, das ist ja eine Arie! Womit habe ich denn das herausgefordert? Etwas trocken kommt es mir übrigens vor. Und was er nur immer mit der Arbeit will. Immer hat er es mit der Arbeit, obgleich es doch wenig hierher paßt. Und er sagte:","Great weather, thought Hans Castorp, dismayed and ashamed, that's an aria! How did I challenge that? By the way, it seems a little dry to me. And whatever he wants with work. He's always concerned with work, although it doesn't quite fit here. And he said:","“Lord bless us,” thought Hans Castorp, in shamefaced consternation. “What a homily! How, I wonder, did I call all that down on my head? I must say, I find it rather prosy. And why does he talk so much about work all the time? It is his constant theme; not a very pertinent one up here, one would think.” Aloud he said: “How beautifully you do talk, Herr Settembrini!","“Damnation,” Hans Castorp thought, both bewildered and abashed, “that was a regular aria! How did I provoke that? Although it all seems a little dry to me. And what is this fixation he has about work? He’s always going on about work, although it really does not fit all that well here.” And aloud he said, “Very fine, Herr Settembrini."
"Ja, hier. Margarete, Gebet des Valentin. Bitte sehr. Sie hatte ausnahmsweise im leichten Album gesteckt und nicht im grünen Arien-Album Nummer II, wohin sie nach der Organisation gehörte. Sie war zufälligerweise, außerordentlicherweise, schlampigerweise, erfreulicherweise unter die Allotria geraten und brauchte nur eingelegt zu werden.","Yes here. Margaret, Valentine's prayer. Here you go. She was exceptionally in the light album and not in the green arias album number II, where she belonged according to the organization. It had accidentally, extraordinarily, sloppily, happily fallen under the Allotria and needed only to be pickled.","Hans Castorp asked. “Yes, here it is, Faust, Valentine’s Prayer.” It had been stuck by mistake in the album of light music, not in the green album of arias, where it belonged; quite by chance—or mismanagement or carelessness, in any case luckily—it had partaken of the general topsyturvyness, and here it was, needing only to be put on.","Yes, here. Faust, “Valentin’s Prayer.” Here, he could see for himself. Somehow it had got put into the album of light favorites, rather than in the green album of arias, number two, where it properly belonged. How extraordinary, how fortunate, by accident or carelessness it had landed in the frothier stuff and only needed to be put on."
"»Nein, so noch nicht. Das sind so Vorgesetzten-Anfälle. Das einzig Richtige ist, daß man sie in einwandfreier Haltung über sich ergehen läßt. Er war ja natürlich gereizt durch die Geschichte mit Polypraxios und der Nölting. Aber hast du gesehen,« fuhr Joachim fort, und man merkte, wie die Freude darüber, daß er seine Sache durchgefochten, in ihm aufstieg und ihm die Brust beengte, »hast du gesehen, wie er klein beigab und kapitulierte, als er einsah, daß es mein Ernst war? Man muß nur Schneid zeigen, sich nur nicht zudecken lassen. Nun habe ich sozusagen Erlaubnis, – er selbst hat gesagt, daß ich mich wahrscheinlich herausbeißen werde, – und über acht Tage reisen … in drei Wochen bin ich beim Regiment«, verbesserte er sich, indem er Hans Castorp aus dem Spiele ließ und seine freudebebende Aussage auf die eigene Person beschränkte.","'No, not yet. Those are boss fits. The only right thing to do is to let them endure you in impeccable posture. Of course he was irritated by the story about Polypraxios and Nölting. But did you see,"" continued Joachim, and one noticed how the joy at having fought his cause welled up in him and constricted his chest, ""did you see how he gave in and capitulated when he saw that I was serious? You just have to show courage, just don't let yourself be covered up. Now I've got permission, so to speak - he himself said I'll probably have a hard time - and I'll be traveling for eight days... in three weeks I'll be with the regiment,' he corrected himself, leaving Hans Castorp out of the game and his elated Statement limited to himself.","“No, not like that. But the authorities sometimes get these attacks. The important thing is to behave with dignity and let them pass over. He was irritated about the business with Polypraxios and Emmy Nolting. But did you see,” Joachim went on, and the joy of having fought and won his battle mounted in him and almost took away his breath, “did you see how he gave in and showed no more fight, directly he saw I was in earnest? All one has to do is to show some pluck, and not let oneself be shouted down. Now I’ve even got a sort of leave—at least, he said himself I’ll probably pull out of it—and I’m travelling in a week— in three weeks I’ll be with the colours,” he finished, altering his phrase, and confining the joy that trembled in his voice to his own affairs, without reference to Hans Castorp’s.","“No, never like that. But superiors throw temper tantrums. The only thing to do is maintain perfect composure and let it pass right over you. He was upset, of course, by the Polypraxios-Nölting affair. But did you see,” Joachim went on, and his joy at having fought the good fight rose visibly, making him catch his breath, “did you see how he backed off and capitulated when he realized that I was serious? All you have to do is show your spunk and not let them get the upper hand. And now I’ve been given permission more or less—he said himself that I’d probably make the grade—to leave a week from today.” And correcting himself, he added, “To be with my regiment inside of three weeks.” He did not even mention his cousin, but restricted his exuberant comments to his own fate."
"»Laryngea«, bestätigte Behrens. »Schnell fortschreitende Zerstörung. Und mit der Luftröhrenschleimhaut sieht es auch schon böse aus. Kann sein, daß das Kommandogeschrei im Dienst da einen locus minoris resistentiae geschaffen hat. Aber gefaßt sein müssen wir auf solche Diversionen ja immer. Wenig Aussicht, mein Junge; eigentlich wohl gar keine. Selbstverständlich soll alles versucht werden, was gut und teuer ist.«","""Laryngea,"" Behrens confirmed. 'Rapidly advancing destruction. And the tracheal mucosa is already looking bad. It may be that the shouting of commands on duty has created a locus minoris resistentiae. But we always have to be prepared for such diversions. Little prospect, my boy; actually probably none at all. Of course everything that is good and expensive should be tried.«","“Laryngea,” Behrens assented. “Breaking down fast. The mucous membrane of the trachea looks bad too. Maybe yelling commands in the service set up a locus minoris resistentiæ there. But we must always be ready for such little diversions. Not much hope, my lad; really none at all, I suppose. Of course, we’ll try everything that’s good and costs money.”","“Laryngeal tuberculosis,” Behrens confirmed. “Rapid deterioration. And the tracheal membranes are already looking nasty, too. It may be that shouting orders at drill could have created a locus minoris resistentiae.

"Wiedemann hatte einen kurzen, lauernden Blick. Es sah tatsächlich und unbildlich so aus, als hinge dicht vor seiner Nase eine Puschel, auf die er boshaft schielte, und hinter der er nichts mehr sah. Die Mißidee, die ihn ritt, war zu einem juckenden Mißtrauen, einer rastlosen Verfolgungsmanie geworden, die ihn trieb, Unreinheit, die sich in seiner Nähe versteckt oder verlarvt halten mochte, hervorzuziehen und der Schande zuzuführen. Er stichelte, verdächtigte und geiferte, wo er ging und stand. Und kurz, das Betreiben der Anprangerung alles Lebens, das nicht den Vorzug besaß, der sein einziger war, füllte seine Tage aus.","Wiedemann had a brief, lurking look. It looked real and unreal, as if there was a pom pom hanging right in front of his nose, at which he squinted maliciously and behind which he couldn't see anything. The misconception that rode him had become an itching distrust, a restless mania for persecution, which drove him to draw out and bring to shame any impurity that might be hidden or disguised near him. He teased, suspected and ranted wherever he went. And in short, the pursuit of the denunciation of all life that did not possess the virtue that was his only one filled his days.","Wiedemann had a quick, threatening glance. It was literally as though he had a punching-ball hanging close in front of his nose, and squinted at it, seeing nothing whatever beyond. The prejudice that haunted him was grown to an itch, a ceaseless persecution-mania, which led him to smell out the vileness hidden or disguised in his neighbourhood and hold it up to scorn. Wherever he went, he suspected, he gibed, he vented his spleen; in short, his days were filled with hunting out and hounding down all his fellow-creatures who did not possess that inestimable advantage which was the only one he had.","Wiedemann had a quick, furtive glance. He truly looked as if a very real tassel were dangling just in front of his nose and he was constantly squinting at it, was unable to see beyond it. The erroneous belief that possessed him had become an itch of mistrust, a restless paranoia that drove him to pluck out any uncleanness that lay hidden or disguised in his vicinity, to hold it up to public disgrace. He taunted, he cast suspicions, he foamed at the mouth wherever he went. And in short, his days were filled with exposing to ridicule every form of life that did not possess the one merit he could call his own."

Da sie sie aber »behandeln« kann, so ist klar, daß die Zeit, die das Element der Erzählung ist, auch zu ihrem Gegenstande werden kann; und wenn es zuviel gesagt wäre, man könne »die Zeit erzählen«, so ist doch, von der Zeit erzählen zu wollen, offenbar kein ganz so absurdes Beginnen, wie es uns anfangs scheinen wollte, – so daß denn also dem Namen des »Zeitromans« ein eigentümlich träumerischer Doppelsinn zukommen könnte. Tatsächlich haben wir die Frage, ob man die Zeit erzählen könne, nur aufgeworfen, um zu gestehen, daß wir mit laufender Geschichte wirklich dergleichen vorhaben. Und wenn wir die weitere Frage streiften, ob die um uns Versammelten sich noch ganz im klaren darüber seien, wie lange es gegenwärtig her ist, daß der unterdessen verstorbene ehrliebende Joachim jene Bemerkung über Musik und Zeit ins Gespräch flocht (die übrigens von einer gewissen alchimistischen Steigerung seines Wesens zeugt, da solche Bemerkungen eigentlich nicht in seiner braven Natur lagen), – so wären wir wenig erzürnt gewesen, zu hören, daß man sich wirklich im Augenblick nicht mehr so recht im klaren darüber sei: wenig erzürnt, ja zufrieden aus dem einfachen Grunde, weil die allgemeine Teilnahme an dem Erleben unseres Helden natürlich in unserem Interesse liegt, und weil dieser, Hans Castorp, in beregtem Punkte durchaus nicht ganz fest war, und zwar schon längst nicht mehr. Das gehört zu seinem Roman, einem Zeitroman, – so – und auch wieder so genommen.","{818}Like these dreams of vice, the narration is able to go to work over time, it is able to treat them in a similar way. But since she can ""treat"" them, it is clear that time, which is the element of the story, can also become its object; and if it were said too much that one could ""tell the time,"" then wanting to tell about the time is obviously not quite as absurd a beginning as it seemed to us at first - so that the name of the ""Zeitromans ' could have a peculiarly dreamy ambiguity. In fact, we raised the question of being able to tell time only to admit that we really intend to do that with running history. And if we touched on the further question of whether those gathered around us were still fully aware of how long it is currently since the honor-loving Joachim, who has meanwhile passed away, weaved that remark about music and time into the conversation (which, by the way, was made by a certain alchemist heightening of his nature shows that such remarks were not really in his good nature) - so we would not have been angry to hear that at the moment one was really not really clear about it: not very angry, even satisfied with the The simple reason is that general participation in the experience of our hero is of course in our interest, and because he, Hans Castorp, was by no means firm on an animated point, and hasn't been for a long time. It's part of his novel, a period novel, - taken like that - and again taken like that.","Thus, or in some such way as in these sinister dreams, can the narrative go to work with time; in some such way can time be dealt with in a tale. And if this be so, then it is clear that time, while the medium of the narrative, can also become its subject. Therefore, if it is too much to say that one can tell a tale of time, it is none the less true that a desire to tell a tale about time is not such an absurd idea as it just now seemed. We freely admit that, in bringing up the question as to whether the time can be narrated or not, we have done so only to confess that we had something like that in view in the present work. And if we touched upon the further question, whether our readers were clear how much time had passed since the upright Joachim, deceased in the interval, had introduced into the conversation the above-quoted phrases about music and time— remarks indicating a certain alchemistical heightening of his nature, which, in its goodness and simplicity, was, of its own unaided power, incapable of any such ideas —we should not have been dismayed to hear that they were not clear. We might even have been gratified, on the plain ground that a thorough-going sympathy with the experiences of our hero is precisely what we wish to arouse, and he, Hans Castorp, was himself not clear upon the point in question, no, nor had been for a very long time—a fact that has conditioned his romantic adventures up here, to an extent which has made of them, in more than one sense, a “time-romance.”","A narrative, then, can set to work and deal with time in much the same way as those depraved dreams. But since it can “deal” with time, it is clear that time, which is the element of the narrative, can also become its subject; and although it would be going too far to say that one can “narrate time,” it is apparently not such an absurd notion to want to narrate about time—so that a term like “time novel” may well take on an oddly dreamlike double meaning. And indeed we posed the question about whether one could narrate time precisely in order to say that we actually have something like that in mind with this ongoing story. And in touching upon the wider question of whether those gathered around us were quite clear about how long it had actually been since the now-deceased, honor-loving Joachim wove those comments about time and music into a conversation (which in fact revealed a certain alchemistic enhancement of his own character, since such remarks were not part of his upright nature), we would hardly have been irritated to learn that our readers really were no longer quite clear about the matter at the moment—hardly irritated, indeed we would be content, for the simple reason that a general sympathy for our hero and his experiences naturally lies in our own interest. And he, Hans Castorp, was not quite certain about the matter himself, and had not been for a good while. That uncertainty is very much part of his novel, a “time novel”—whether taken in one sense or the other."
"»Spukhaft, was? Ja, ein Einschlag von Spukhaftigkeit ist nicht zu verkennen.«","""Spooky, isn't it? Yes, there is an unmistakable touch of spooky.«","The Hofrat said: “Spooky, what? Yes, there’s something distinctly spooky about it.” He closed off the current.","The director said, “Spooky, isn’t it? Yes, there’s no mistaking that whiff of spookiness.”"
Und was bist du für ein Emissär? dachte Hans Castorp. Laut sagte er:,And what kind of emissary are you? thought Hans Castorp.

"Aufs bestimmteste hatte er erwartet, daß er sogleich in Schlaf sinken werde, doch stellte sich das als Irrtum heraus, und seine Lider, die er vorhin kaum offenzuhalten vermocht hatte, – jetzt {138}wollten sie durchaus nicht geschlossen bleiben, sondern öffneten sich unruhig zuckend, sobald er sie senkte. Es war noch nicht seine gewohnte Schlafenszeit, sagte er sich, und dann hatte er wohl tagüber zuviel gelegen. Auch wurde draußen ein Teppich geklopft, – was ja wenig wahrscheinlich und in der Tat überhaupt nicht der Fall war; sondern es erwies sich, daß sein Herz es war, dessen Schlag er außer sich und weit fort im Freien hörte, genau so, als werde dort draußen ein Teppich mit einem geflochtenen Rohrklopfer bearbeitet.","He had most definitely expected that he would fall asleep immediately, but that turned out to be a mistake, and his eyelids, which he had scarcely been able to keep open before, now they would not remain closed at all, but opened restlessly twitching as he lowered them. It wasn't his usual bedtime yet, he told himself, and then he must have slept too much during the day. A carpet was also being beaten outside - which was unlikely and in fact not the case at all; but it turned out that it was his heart whose beating he heard far and wide in the open air, just as if a carpet was being beaten with a plaited reed beater out there.","He had thought to fall asleep at once, but he was wrong. His eyelids, which he had scarcely been able to hold up, now declined to close; they twitched rebelliously open whenever he shut them. He told himself that it was not his regular bed-time; that during the day he had probably rested too much. Someone seemed to be beating a carpet out of doors—which was not very probable, and proved not to be the case, for it was the beating of his own heart he heard, quite outside of himself and away in the night, exactly as though someone were beating a carpet with a wicker beater.","He had been certain that he would sink into sleep at once, but it turned out he was wrong, and whereas he had barely been able to keep his eyes open before, they simply would not remain closed now, but kept fluttering open restlessly the moment he shut them. It was not his normal bedtime, he told himself, and then, of course, he had napped too often during the day. And someone was beating a carpet outside—which was less than probable and indeed not the case. It turned out that it was his heart that he heard pounding somewhere far in the distance outside—just as if someone were walloping a rug with a wicker carpet-beater."
"Korpsstudentischen Tonfalles hatte sie erklärt, den eigentlichen Ursachen der Unsolidität von Hans Castorps Wärmehaushalt auf der Spur zu sein, Ursachen, denen nach ihrer wissenschaftlichen Aussage so unschwer beizukommen sein würde, daß Heilung, legitime Entlassung ins Flachland plötzlich in nahe Aussicht gerückt schienen. Des jungen Mannes Herz schlug hoch, von mannigfachen Empfindungen bestürmt, als er zum Aderlasse den Arm hinstreckte. Blinzelnd und leicht erblassend bewunderte er das herrliche Rubinrot seines Lebenssaftes, der steigend den klaren Behälter füllte. Der Hofrat selbst, assistiert von Doktor Krokowski und einer Barmherzigen Schwester, vollzog die kleine, aber weittragende Operation. {962}Danach verging eine Reihe von Tagen, beherrscht für Hans Castorp von der Frage, wie das Hingegebene, außerhalb seiner, unter den Augen der Wissenschaft sich bewähren werde.","In the tone of a corps student she had explained that she was on the trail of the real causes of Hans Castorp's unstable heat balance, causes which, according to her scientific statement, would be so easy to get at that a cure and legitimate release to the lowlands suddenly seemed imminent. The young man's heart beat fast, assailed by manifold emotions, as he stretched out his arm to bleed. Blinking and paling slightly, he admired the glorious ruby red of his lifeblood, which increasingly filled the clear container. The Hofrat himself, assisted by Doctor Krokowski and a Sister of Mercy, carried out the small but far-reaching operation. {962}After that, a number of days passed, dominated for Hans Castorp by the question of how what was given would prove itself outside of him in the eyes of science.","They had declared, the heads, in the accents of a corps-student, that they were on track of the actual causes of the instability of Hans Castorp’s heating economy. And those causes, according to their scientific pronouncement, were so easy to come at that a veritable cure and legitimate dismissal to the flat-land had leaped into the foreground. The young man’s heart throbbed stormily with manifold emotions, when he stretched out his arm for the blood-letting. Going slightly pale, and blinking, he expressed his admiration for the splendid ruby colour of his life-blood, as it mounted in the glass container. The Hofrat himself, assisted by Dr. Krokowski and a Sister of Mercy, performed the slight but portentous operation. Then passed several days, occupied in Hans Castorp’s mind with the question how this blood of his, this part of himself, would behave out of his control and under the eye of science.","In its fraternity jargon and cadence, medical authority had announced the true cause for the waywardness of Hans Castorp’s body temperature and offered its scientific opinion that the cause would not be difficult to overcome and that a cure and authorized release back to the flatlands suddenly loomed ahead in the near future. Assailed by manifold sensations, the young man’s heart pounded hard as he held out his arm to give blood, and he turned slightly pale as he admired the splendid ruby red of the sap of life rising to fill glass tubes. Assisted by Dr. Krokowski and a Sister of Mercy, the director himself performed this little operation with its far-reaching consequences. Then came a series of days that for Hans Castorp were dominated by one question: once outside his body, would what he had given pass the test under the eye of science?"

"Vorderhand war seine Neugier gestillt. Holgers Gedicht war ja im Augenblick nicht übel gewesen, aber die vorausgeahnte innere Hoffnungslosigkeit und Abgeschmacktheit des Ganzen hatte sich ihm doch so unverkennbar aufgedrängt, daß es, so dachte er, bei diesen wenigen Flocken Höllenfeuers, die ihn angestoben, sein Bewenden haben mochte. Herr Settembrini, wie sich denken läßt, bestärkte ihn aus allen Kräften in diesem Vorsatz, als Hans Castorp ihm von seinen Erlebnissen erzählte. »Das,« rief er, »war alles, was noch gefehlt hatte! O Elend, Elend!« Und kurzerhand erklärte er die kleine Elly für eine abgefeimte Betrügerin.","For the time being his curiosity was satisfied. Holger's poem hadn't been bad at the moment, but the foreboding inner hopelessness and senselessness of the whole thing had so unmistakably forced itself on him that, he thought, it might have been content with these few flakes of hellfire that spurred him on. Herr Settembrini, as you can imagine, encouraged him with all his strength in this resolution when Hans Castorp told him about his experiences. ""That,"" he cried, ""was all that was missing! O misery, misery!' And without further ado he declared little Elly to be a wily swindler.","His curiosity was for the time quenched. Holger’s poem had not been so bad; but the anticipated futility and vulgarity of the scene as a whole had been so unmistakable that he felt quite willing to let it go at these few vagrant sparks of hell-fire. Herr Settembrini, to whom he related his experiences, strengthened this conviction with all his force. “That,” he cried out, “was all that was lacking. Oh, misery, misery!” And cursorily dismissed little Elly as a thorough-paced impostor.","His curiosity was satisfied for now. Holger’s poem had really not been bad, but, as he had suspected, the hopelessness and preposterousness of the whole affair had borne down upon him so forcefully that even those few flakes of brimstone that had drifted his way were quite sufficient, he decided. When Hans Castorp told Herr Settembrini about his experiences, his mentor, as might be imagined, reinforced him in this resolve with might and main. “That,” he cried, “was all you needed. Oh, calamity and desolation!” And on the spot he declared little Elly to be a cunning fraud."
"»Ja, als Volontär. Ich habe gebeten, mich vorläufig auf der Werft zu entschuldigen. Sie müssen nicht denken, daß deswegen da Verzweiflung herrscht. Die können sich beliebig lange auch ohne Volontär behelfen.«","»Yes, as a volunteer. I have asked for a preliminary apology to the shipyard. You don't have to think that's why there's desperation. They can manage as long as they like without a volunteer.«","“Yes, as volunteer apprentice. I have asked them to excuse me for the present. You must not imagine they are in despair over my defection. They can carry on indefinitely without an assistant.”","“Yes, as an unsalaried engineer-in-training. I asked them to excuse me from my duties on the dock for now. You mustn’t suppose they are in any despair about it. They can get along without a trainee for as long as necessary.”"
"Es blieb zweifelhaft, in welchem Sinn sie über des Hofrats Erklärung so perlend lachte, – ob nur ihrer »Grobheit« wegen und weil sie nicht daran glaubte, oder obgleich sie daran glaubte – denn das mußte sie doch wohl tun –, aber die Sache selbst, das heißt die Lebensgefahr, in der sie schwebte, eben nur furchtbar komisch fand. Hans Castorp hatte den Eindruck, daß dies letztere zutreffe, und daß sie wirklich nur aus kindischem Leichtsinn und dem Unverstand ihres Vogelhirns perle, trillere und tiriliere, was er mißbilligte. Trotzdem schickte er ihr Blumen, sah aber auch die lachlustige Frau Zimmermann nicht wieder. Denn nachdem sie noch einige Tage lang unter Sauerstoff gehalten worden, war sie im Arm ihres telegraphisch herbeigerufenen Gatten denn richtig gestorben, – eine Gans in Folio, wie der Hofrat, von dem Hans Castorp es hörte, von sich aus hinzufügte.","It remained doubtful in what sense she laughed so sparklingly at the Hofrat's declaration - whether only because of her ""rudeness"" and because she did not believe in it, or although she believed in it - for that was what she had to do - but the matter itself , that is, the mortal danger she was in just found terribly funny. Hans Castorp had the impression that the latter was true, and that she was really just beading, trilling and trilling out of childish carelessness and the ignorance of her bird brain, which he disapproved of. Nevertheless, he sent her flowers, but he never saw the laughing Frau Zimmermann again. For after she had been kept on oxygen for a few more days, she had really died in the arms of her husband, who had been summoned by telegram—a goose in folio, as the privy councilor, from whom Hans Castorp heard it, added of his own accord.","It remained unclear what aspect of Behrens’s outburst had made her laugh; whether his brusqueness, and because she did not believe what he said, or whether she did believe it— as indeed she must, it would seem—and quite simply found the fact of her imminent danger “too funny for words.” Hans Castorp got the impression that it was the latter; and that she was pealing, trilling, and cascading with laughter only out of childish irresponsibility and the incomprehension of her birdlike brain. He disapproved. He sent her some flowers, but never again beheld the laughter-loving lady—who, indeed, after she had sustained life upon oxygen for some days, expired in the arms of her hurriedly summoned husband. “As big a goose as they make them,” the Hofrat called her, in telling Hans Castorp of her death.","It was not clear why the director’s comments had sent her into gales of laughter. Was it because he had “turned the air blue” and she did not really believe him—or that she did believe him, as she surely must, but found the state of “hovering between life and death” too funny for words? Hans Castorp had the impression that the latter was the case and that these sparkling trills and grace notes of laughter were due solely to childish giddiness and silly ignorance—and he did not approve. He sent her flowers all the same—but never saw gleeful Frau Zimmermann again, either. For after being kept under oxygen for several days, she had died in the arms of her husband, who had been called to her bedside by telegram. “A jumbo-size goose,” the director had volunteered in summary when he told Hans Castorp the news."
"»Da klingt es etwas dumpfer als hier«, sagte Hans Castorp.","""It sounds a bit duller there than here,"" said Hans Castorp.","Hofrat tapped by turns on Hans Castorp’s left side, first above and then lower down. “It sounds rather duller there,” said Hans Castorp.","“It sounds a bit more hollow there,” Hans Castorp said."
"Will man glauben, daß unser schlichter Held nach so und so vielen Jährchen hermetisch-pädagogischer Steigerung tief genug ins geistige Leben eingetreten war, um sich der »Bedeutsamkeit« seiner Liebe und ihres Objektes bewußt zu sein? Wir behaupten und erzählen, daß er es war. Das Lied bedeutete ihm viel, eine ganze Welt und zwar eine Welt, die er wohl lieben mußte, da er sonst in ihr stellvertretendes Gleichnis nicht so vernarrt gewesen wäre. Wir wissen, was wir sagen, wenn wir – vielleicht etwas dunklerweise – hinzufügen, daß sein Schicksal sich anders gestaltet hätte, wenn sein Gemüt den Reizen der Gefühlssphäre, der allgemein geistigen Haltung, die das Lied auf so innig-geheimnisvolle Weise zusammenfaßte, nicht im höchsten Grade zugänglich gewesen wäre. Eben dieses Schicksal aber hatte Steigerungen, Abenteuer, Einblicke mit sich gebracht, Regierungsprobleme in ihm aufgeworfen, die ihn zu {988}ahnungsvoller Kritik an dieser Welt, diesem ihrem allerdings absolut bewunderungswürdigen Gleichnis, dieser seiner Liebe reif gemacht hatten und danach angetan waren, sie alle drei unter Gewissenszweifel zu stellen.","Does one want to believe that our humble hero, after so many years of hermetic and pedagogical intensification, had entered deep enough into spiritual life to be conscious of the ""significance"" of his love and its object? We claim and tell that it was him. The song meant a lot to him, a whole world, and a world he must have loved or he wouldn't have been so infatuated with its vicarious simile. We know what we are saying when we add, perhaps somewhat obscurely, that his fate would have been different if his mind had not been in the grip of the charms of the emotional sphere, of the general mental attitude that the song so intimately and mysteriously summed up would have been accessible to the highest degree. But precisely this fate had brought with it escalations, adventures, insights, government problems raised in him, which had made him anticipatory criticism of this world, this, of course, absolutely admirable parable, this of his love and then he was attracted to her to put all three under doubt of conscience.","May we take it that our simple hero, after so many years of hermetic-pedagogic discipline, of ascent from one stage of being to another, has now reached a point where he is conscious of the “meaningfulness” of his love and the object of it? We assert, we record, that he has. To him the song meant a whole world, a world which he must have loved, else he could not have so desperately loved that which it represented and symbolized to him. We know what we are saying when we add—perhaps rather darkly—that he might have had a different fate if his temperament had been less accessible to the charms of the sphere of feeling, the general attitude of mind, which the lied so profoundly, so mystically epitomized. The truth was that his very destiny had been marked by stages, adventures, insights, and these flung up in his mind suitable themes for his “stock-taking” activities, and these, in their turn, ripened him into an intuitional critic of this sphere, of this its absolutely exquisite image, and his love of it. To the point even that he was quite capable of bringing up all three as objects of his conscientious scruples!","Does anyone believe that our ordinary hero, after a certain number of years of hermetic and pedagogic enhancement, had penetrated deeply enough into the life of the intellect and the spirit for him to be conscious of the “significance” of this object and his love for it? We assert, we recount, that he had. The song meant a great deal to him, a whole world—a world that he evidently must have loved, or otherwise he would not have been so infatuated with the image that represented it. We know what we are saying when we add—perhaps somewhat darkly—that his fate might have been different if his disposition had not been so highly susceptible to the charms of the emotional sphere, to the universal state of mind that this song epitomized so intensely, so mysteriously. But that same fate had brought with it enhancements, adventures, and insights, had stirred up inside him the problems that came with “playing king,” all of which had matured him into an intuitive critic of this world, of this absolutely admirable image of it, of his love for it—had made him capable, that is, of observing all three with the scruples of conscience."
"Recht vergebens, versetzte Naphta, rufe Herr Settembrini die Einfalt jener morgendlichen Zeiten zu seiner Hilfe auf, – die Siegerin, die ihre Schöpferkraft noch in der Dämonisierung des Überwundenen bewährt habe. Übrigens seien die Lehrer der jungen Kirche nicht müde geworden, vor den Lügen der alten Philosophen und Dichter zu warnen, insonderheit davor, sich mit der üppigen Beredsamkeit des Virgil zu beflecken, und heute, wo wieder ein Zeitalter zu Grabe sinke, abermals ein proletarischer Morgen tage, sei wahrhaftig die Stunde günstig, ihnen nachzufühlen! So möge denn, um alles zu beantworten, Herr Lodovico auch überzeugt sein, daß er, Redner, sein bißchen bürgerliche Beschäftigung, worauf jener anzuspielen die Güte gehabt habe, mit aller gebotenen reservatio mentalis betreibe und sich nicht ohne Ironie in einen klassisch-rhetorischen Erziehungsbetrieb einordne, dessen Lebensdauer ein Sanguiniker allenfalls noch nach Jahrzehnten berechnen möge.","It was in vain, replied Naphta, that M. Settembrini called upon the simplicity of those early mornings to help him—the victor who had proved her creative powers by demonizing the vanquished. Incidentally, the teachers of the early church never tired of warning against the lies of the old philosophers and poets, especially against smearing themselves with the lavish eloquence of Virgil, and today, when another age is sinking to the grave, another proletarian tomorrow days, truly be the right hour to empathize with them! So, in order to answer everything, Mr. Lodovico may also be convinced that he, a speaker, pursues his bit of civil occupation, to which he was kind enough to allude, with all the necessary reservations and not without irony in a classical-rhetorical educational establishment classify, whose lifespan a sanguine may at best calculate after decades.","It was vain, Naphta responded, for Herr Settembrini to invoke the simplicity of those primitive times, the victorious element which preserved its creative vitality even while endowing that which it conquered with a demonic quality. But in truth, the Fathers of the early Church were never weary of warning the faithful against the lies of the old philosophers and poets, in particular of cautioning them not to be corrupted by the voluptuous eloquence of Virgil; and to-day, at a time when again an age is declining to its fall, and we see the approaching dawn of another proletarian morn, the time is ripe to feel with them. Finally, in order to leave nothing unanswered, Herr Ludovico might be assured that he, the speaker, did his duty by the small civilian task which Herr Settembrini had been so kind as to mention, with all due reservatio mentalis; though there was indeed a certain irony in his conforming to the standards of a classic and rhetorical educational system, whose survival the most optimistic observer could not predicate for more than a few decades.","It was all in vain, Naphta responded, that Herr Settembrini appealed to the naiveté of those victorious morning years of Christianity—which had only proved its creative force by making demons of those it conquered. Moreover, the teachers of the early Church had never wearied of warning people against the lies of the philosophers and poets of antiquity, and in particular against sullying themselves with the lush eloquence of a Virgil. Indeed, the present day, when once again one age was heading for the grave even as a proletarian age was dawning, was a particularly appropriate time for respecting such sentiments. And as for the rest of his charge, Herr Lodovico could be sure that he, Naphta, pursued his modicum of bourgeois activity, to which the former had been kind enough to allude, with all due reservatio mentalis and that he recognized a certain irony in having found a niche in an educational institution devoted to classical rhetoric, a pedagogy whose life span even the most sanguine would estimate only in decades."

"Luise Ziemßen hatte dieselben schönen, schwarzen und sanften Augen wie Joachim. Ihr ebenfalls schwarzes, mit Weiß aber schon stark vermischtes Haar war durch ein fast unsichtbares Schleiernetz in Form und Sitz befestigt, und das paßte zu ihrer Wesenshaltung überhaupt, die besonnen, freundlich gemessen und sanft zusammengenommen war und ihr bei deutlicher Geistesschlichtheit eine angenehme Würde verlieh. Es war klar, und Hans Castorp wunderte sich auch nicht darüber, daß sie sich auf Joachims Lustigkeit, auf den raschen Gang seiner Atmung und seiner sich überstürzenden Rede, Erscheinungen, die zu seinem Verhalten zu Hause und auf der Reise wahrscheinlich in Widerspruch standen und tatsächlich seiner Lage widersprachen, nicht verstand und gewissermaßen Anstoß daran nahm. Dieser Einzug erschien ihr traurig, und sie glaubte sich dementsprechend halten zu sollen. In die Empfindungen Joachims, turbulente Empfindungen der Heimkehr, die im Augenblick alles Entgegenstehende trunken überwogen und durch das Wiederatmen der Luft, unserer unvergleichlich leichten, nichtigen und erhitzenden Luft hier oben, wohl noch befeuert wurden, konnte sie sich nicht finden, sie waren ihr undurchsichtig. »Mein armer Junge«, dachte sie, und {759}dabei sah sie den armen Jungen sich mit seinem Vetter einer ausgelassenen Fröhlichkeit hingeben, hundert Erinnerungen auffrischen, hundert Fragen stellen und sich mit der Antwort lachend in den Stuhl zurückwerfen. Mehrmals sagte sie: »Aber, Kinder!« Und was sie schließlich sagte, sollte erfreut kommen, kam aber mit Befremdung und leisem Tadel: »Joachim, wahrhaftig, so habe ich dich lange nicht gesehen. Es scheint, wir müßten hierher fahren, damit du wieder wärest wie am Tag deiner Beförderung.« Worauf es denn freilich mit Joachims Lustigkeit zu Ende war. Seine Stimmung schlug um, er kam zur Besinnung, schwieg, aß nichts vom Nachtisch, obgleich es ein überaus leckeres Schokolade-Soufflé mit Schlagrahm war, das erschien, (Hans Castorp hielt sich statt seiner daran, obgleich seit Abschluß des übergewaltigen Diners erst eine Stunde vergangen war) und blickte endlich überhaupt nicht mehr auf, offenbar weil er Tränen in den Augen hatte.","Luise Ziemssen had the same beautiful, black, gentle eyes as Joachim. Her hair, which was also black but already heavily mixed with white, was fixed in shape and position by an almost invisible net of veils, and that suited her demeanor in general, which was level-headed, friendly measured and gently gathered and gave her a pleasant dignity despite her clear mental simplicity. It was clear, and Hans Castorp wasn't surprised either, that she was referring to Joachim's jollity, the rapid pace of his breathing and his hasty speech, phenomena which probably and in fact contradicted his behavior at home and on the journey contradicted his situation, did not understand and, to a certain extent, took offense at it. This arrival seemed sad to her, and she thought she should hold herself accordingly. She could not find her way into Joachim's feelings, turbulent feelings of returning home, which at the moment intoxicatedly outweighed everything that stood in the way and were probably fueled by breathing the air again, our incomparably light, empty and heating air up here, they were opaque to her . ""My poor boy,"" she thought, and as she did so she saw the poor boy and his cousin indulging in hilarity, refreshing a hundred memories, asking a hundred questions, and laughingly throwing themselves back in the chair with the answer. She said several times: ""But, children!"" And what she finally said was supposed to come out pleased, but came with dismay and gentle reproach: ""Joachim, really, I haven't seen you like that for a long time. It seems we have to drive here so that you're back to where you were on the day you were promoted.' Whereupon Joachim's merriment came to an end, of course. His mood changed, he came to his senses, was silent, didn't eat any dessert, although it was an extremely delicious chocolate soufflé with whipped cream that appeared (Hans Castorp stuck to it instead, although it was only an hour since the end of the overwhelming dinner passed) and finally didn't look up at all, apparently because he had tears in his eyes.","Louisa Ziemssen had the same gentle and beautiful dark eyes as Joachim. Her hair, that was quite as black, but mingled now with many threads of grey, was confined by a nearly invisible net; an arrangement characteristic of the mild and measured composure of her personality, which was simple, and at the same time dignified and pleasing. Hans Castorp felt no surprise to see that she was puzzled, even a little put out, by Joachim’s liveliness, his rapid breathing and headlong talk, which were probably foreign to his manner either at home or on the journey, besides giving the lie to his actual condition. For herself she was impressed with the sadness of this return, and would have found a subdued bearing more suitable. How could she enter into Joachim’s turbulent emotions, due in part to the sensation that he was come home, which for the moment outweighed all else, and in part to the stimulus of the incomparably light, empty, yet kindling air he was once breathing? All that was totally dark to her. “My poor lad,” she thought, as she watched him and his cousin abandoned to mirth, telling each other a hundred anecdotes, asking each other a hundred questions, throwing themselves back in their chairs with peals of laughter. “Children, children!” she protested more than once; and finally levelled a mild reproof at behaviour which might rather have gladdened her heart: “Why, Joachim, I have not seen you like this for many a long day. It seems as though you needed to come back here to be as you were on the day of your promotion.” No more was needed to quench Joachim’s lively mood. He turned completely round, fell silent and ate none of the sweet, though it was most toothsome, a chocolate soufflé with whipped cream. Hans Castorp did what he could in his cousin’s stead, though his own hearty dinner was only an hour behind him. Joachim looked up no more—obviously because his eyes were full of tears.","Luise Ziemssen had the same beautiful, black, gentle eyes as Joachim. Her hair was black, too, though mixed with gray now, the coiffure held firmly in place by an almost invisible hairnet, befitting, somehow, her whole personality—which was composed, gently restrained, and friendly in a formal sort of way—and lending a certain dignity to her obviously simple nature. It was clear, as Hans Castorp was not surprised to discover, that she did not understand, was in fact slightly offended by Joachim’s good cheer, his rapid breathing, his impulsive words—behavior that presumably contradicted his disposition at home or during the trip. Their arrival here was a sad one for her, and she believed she should act accordingly. She could not reconcile herself to Joachim’s turbulent emotions, to his sense of having returned home, which for the moment outweighed everything else and inspired him to breathe drunkenly of the old air again—our incomparably light, empty, incendiary air up here. This was all obscure to her. “My poor boy,” she thought, and watched while her poor boy abandoned himself to exuberant exchanges with his cousin, reliving a hundred memories, asking a hundred questions, and throwing himself back in his chair with a laugh at every answer. Several times she said, “Now, children!” And then finally she said something meant to sound happy, but it emerged as a dismayed, gentle rebuke: “ I’ve truly not seen you like this for ages, Joachim. It seems we had to travel all the way here to get you back to how you were on the day of your promotion. “ Which, of course, put an end to Joachim’s exuberance. His mood turned sour, he came back to earth, fell silent, ate none of his dessert, even though a very tasty chocolate soufflé with whipped cream was served (but Hans Castorp ate it for him, though only an hour had passed since his more than ample supper), and finally did not even dare look up—quite probably because of the tears in his eyes."
"{15}»Doch, du bist da. Dies ist das Dorf. Zum Sanatorium ist es näher von hier. Ich habe ’nen Wagen mit. Gib mal deine Sachen her.«","{15}""Yes, you are there. This is the village. It is closer to the sanatorium from here. I have a car with me. Give me your things.""","“Oh, yes, you are. This is the village. It is nearer to the sanatorium from here. I have a carriage. Just give us your things.”",“Sure you are. This is Davos-Dorf. The sanatorium’s closer from here. I’ve got a carriage. Hand me your things.”
"So redete nur einer, ein Störender. Hans Castorp fuhr zusammen und wandte sich Herrn Settembrini zu, der lächelnd vor ihm stand. Es war das feine und humanistische Lächeln, mit dem er dereinst bei der Bank am Wasserlauf den Ankömmling zuerst begrüßt hatte, und wie damals schämte Hans Castorp sich, als er es sah. Aber wie oft er auch im Traume den »Drehorgelmann« von der Stelle zu drängen gesucht hatte, weil er »hier störe«, – der wachende Mensch ist besser als der träumende, und nicht nur zu seiner Beschämung und Ernüchterung wurde Hans Castorp dieses Lächelns wieder ansichtig, sondern auch mit Gefühlen dankbarer Bedürftigkeit. Er sagte:","Only one person spoke like that, a disturber. Hans Castorp started and turned to Mr. Settembrini, who was standing in front of him smiling. It was the fine and humanistic smile with which he had once greeted the newcomer at the bank by the watercourse, and Hans Castorp was ashamed when he saw it, just as he had been then. But no matter how often in his dreams he had tried to shove the ""organ grinder"" from his place because he was ""interfering here"" - the waking person is better than the dreaming one, and it was not only to his embarrassment and disillusionment that Hans Castorp regained this smile perspective, but also with feelings of grateful neediness. He said:","Only one person could talk like that—and he a disturber of Hans Castorp’s peace. The young man started and turned toward Herr Settembrini, who stood there smiling the same fine, humanistic smile that had sat upon his features when he greeted the newcomer, at the bench by the watercourse. Now, as then, it mortified Hans Castorp. We know how often, in his dreams, he had sought to drive away the organ-grinder as an element offensive to his peace; but the waking man is more moral than the sleeping, and, as before, the sight of that smile not only had a sobering effect upon Hans Castorp, but gave him a sense of gratitude, as though it had responded to his need.","Only one person talked like that, one bothersome person. Hans Castorp winced and turned toward Herr Settembrini, who stood smiling before him. It was his delicate, humanist smile, the one with which he had first greeted the newcomer on the bench beside the water trough—and just as on that day, Hans Castorp now felt ashamed of himself. But despite the many times he had tried to push the “organ-grinder” away for bothering him in his dreams, the waking man proved a better person than the dreaming. The sight of that smile not only shamed and sobered Hans Castorp, but also awakened a sense of gratitude for needs met. “Dispatches?” he said."
{509}»Man weiß hier voneinander.«,"{509}""One knows about each other here.""","“We all know about each other, up here.”",“We all know about one another here.”
"Es lag aber so – und Hans Castorp wußte das auch genau –, daß die blamable Erscheinung, mit der er kämpfte, nicht nur körperlicher Herkunft, nicht nur auf die hiesige Luft und die Anstrengung der Akklimatisation zurückzuführen war, sondern eine innere Erregung ausdrückte und mit jenen Spannungen und Sehenswürdigkeiten selbst unmittelbar zusammenhing.","But it was so - and Hans Castorp knew this too well - that the embarrassing appearance with which he struggled was not only of physical origin, not only due to the local air and the effort of acclimatization, but also expressed an inner excitement and with those tensions and sights themselves.","But the truth was—and Hans Castorp was entirely aware of it—that the absurd manifestation against which he struggled was not solely physical in its origin, not wholly to be accounted for by the air up here and the efforts his system made to adjust itself. Rather was it the outward expression of his inner stimulation, and bore directly upon those very episodes and diversions.","But the fact was—and Hans Castorp knew it only too well—that this deplorable phenomenon with which he was struggling was not merely of organic origin, was not attributable solely to the local air or the strain of adjusting to it, but was also the expression of an inner excitement and was bound up intimately with those same sights and tensions."
"Sie rückte kurz den Kopf gegen ihn, die Augen geschlossen, wie mit einem kleinen Winken. Er führte die Lippen an ihre Stirn. Die braunen Tieraugen des Malaien überwachten die Szene seitwärts gerollt, so daß sie ihr Weißes zeigten.","She tilted her head against him briefly, eyes closed, as if with a little wave. He brought his lips to her forehead. The Malayan's animal brown eyes surveyed the scene, rolled sideways to show their whites.","She moved her head toward him, in a little nod, the eyes closed. He pressed his lips on her brow. The brown, doglike eyes of the Malay servant watched the scene, rolling sidewise, until the whites showed.","She thrust her head slightly toward him, eyes closed, as if just blinking. He put his lips to her brow. The Malayan watched this little scene, rolling his brown animal eyes to one side until the whites showed."
"»Es ist ja vorläufig nur eine Hypothese«, sagte Hans Castorp schlaff.","""It's only a hypothesis for the time being,"" said Hans Castorp lazily.","“It is only a hypothesis for the moment, isn’t it?” Hans Castorp said languidly.","“It is only a hypothesis so far,” Hans Castorp said languidly."
"»Wenn das eine Frage ist«, versetzte Hans Castorp, »und wenn ich sie bejahe, so soll das vor allen Dingen nicht heißen, daß ich den enormen Vorzug Ihrer Bekanntschaft nicht zu schätzen wüßte, denn dieser Vorzug ist ja mit der Enttäuschung, von der Sie sprechen, untrennbar verbunden.«","""If that's a question,"" replied Hans Castorp, ""and if I answer it in the affirmative, that doesn't mean above all that I don't appreciate the enormous advantage of your acquaintance, because this advantage goes hand in hand with the disappointment of to whom you speak are inextricably linked.""","“If you put the question,” responded Hans Castorp, “and if I answer yes, my answer must not be taken to mean that I did not know how to value the enormous privilege of knowing you; for that privilege was indissolubly bound up with the suffering.”","“If that is meant as a question,” Hans Castorp replied, “and if I were to respond to it in the affirmative, that should in no way imply that I do not know how to value the enormous privilege of your acquaintance, for that privilege is inseparably bound up with the disappointment of which you speak.”"
Sie sprach wieder:,She spoke again:,She spoke again: “Mine was for a quarter to four.,"She now continued, “Mine is for three forty-five."
"»Das kann man nicht wissen!« sagte Joachim. »Das ist es ja eben, daß man das gar nicht wissen kann! Du sollst ja früher schon Stellen gehabt haben, um die sich niemand gekümmert hat und die ganz von selbst verheilt sind, so daß du jetzt nur noch ein paar gleichgültige Dämpfungen davon hast. So wäre es möglicherweise auch mit der feuchten Stelle gegangen, die du jetzt haben sollst, wenn du nicht zufällig zu mir heraufgekommen wärst, – man kann es nicht wissen!«","""You can't know that!"" said Joachim. ""That's the thing, that you can't know it at all! You are said to have had spots in the past that no one bothered about and which healed by themselves so that now you only have a few indifferent dull patches of them. It might have been the same with the wet spot you're supposed to have if you hadn't accidentally come up to me - one never knows!""","“You can’t tell,” Joachim said. “That is just what you never can tell. They said you had already had places, of which nobody took any notice and they healed of themselves, and left nothing but a few trifling dullnesses. It might have been the same way with the moist spot you are supposed to have now, if you hadn’t come up here at all. One can never know.”","“You can’t be sure of that!” Joachim said. “And that’s just it—that you can’t be sure at all. He claims you had some spots before that no one paid any attention to and they healed by themselves, so that all you have left are a few unimportant muffled tones. The same thing might have happened with this moist spot you’ve got now if you hadn’t happened to come up to visit me—you just can’t be sure.”"
"War das klug gehandelt? Hofrat Behrens hob Schultern und Arme auf und ließ die letzteren geräuschvoll gegen die Schenkel zurückfallen. Spätestens im Herbst, sagte er, werde Frau Salomon wieder da sein, – dann aber auf immer. Würde er recht behalten? Wir werden sehen, wir sind noch auf längere Erdenzeit an diesen Lustort gebunden. Aber der Fall Salomon war also durchaus nicht der einzige seiner Art. Die Zeit zeitigte Veränderungen, – sie hatte das ja immer getan, aber allmählicher, nicht so auffallend. Der Speisesaal wies Lücken auf, Lücken an allen sieben Tischen, am Guten Russentisch wie am Schlechten, an den längs- wie an den querstehenden. Nicht gerade, daß dies von der Frequenz des Hauses ein zuverlässiges Bild gegeben hätte; auch Ankünfte, wie jederzeit, hatten stattgefunden; die Zimmer mochten besetzt sein, aber da handelte es sich eben um Gäste, die durch finalen Zustand in ihrer Freizügigkeit eingeschränkt waren. Im Speisesaal, wie wir sagten, fehlte manch einer dank noch bestehender Freizügigkeit; manch einer aber tat es sogar auf eine besonders tiefe und hohle Weise, wie Dr. {544}Blumenkohl, der tot war. Immer stärker hatte sein Gesicht den Ausdruck angenommen, als habe er etwas schlecht Schmekkendes im Munde; dann war er dauernd bettlägrig geworden und dann gestorben, – niemand wußte genau zu sagen, wann; mit aller gewohnten Rücksicht und Diskretion war die Sache behandelt worden. Eine Lücke. Frau Stöhr saß neben der Lücke, und sie graute sich vor ihr. Darum siedelte sie an des jungen Ziemßen andere Seite über, an den Platz Miß Robinsons, die als geheilt entlassen worden, gegenüber der Lehrerin, Hans Castorps linksseitiger Nachbarin, die fest auf ihrem Posten geblieben war. Ganz allein saß sie derzeit an dieser Tischseite, die übrigen drei Plätze waren frei. Student Rasmussen, der täglich dümmer und schlaffer geworden, war bettlägrig und galt für moribund; und die Großtante war mit ihrer Nichte und der hochbrüstigen Marusja verreist, – wir sagen »verreist«, wie alle es sagten, weil ihre Rückkehr in naher Zeit eine ausgemachte Sache war. Zum Herbst schon würden sie wieder eintreffen, – war das eine Abreise zu nennen? Wie nah war nicht Sommersonnenwende, wenn erst einmal Pfingsten gewesen war, das vor der Türe stand; und kam der längste Tag, so gings ja rapide bergab, auf den Winter zu, – kurzum, die Großtante und Marusja waren beinahe schon wieder da, und das war gut, denn die lachlustige Marusja war keineswegs ausgeheilt und entgiftet; die Lehrerin wußte etwas von tuberkulösen Geschwüren, die die braunäugige Marusja an ihrer üppigen Brust haben sollte, und die schon mehrmals hatten operiert werden müssen. Hans Castorp hatte, als die Lehrerin davon sprach, hastig auf Joachim geblickt, der sein fleckig gewordenes Gesicht über seinen Teller geneigt hatte.","Was that a wise move? Hofrat Behrens raised his shoulders and arms and let the latter fall noisily against his thighs. By autumn at the latest, he said, Frau Salomon will be back - but then forever. Would he be right? We shall see that we are bound to this place of pleasure for a longer period of time. But the case of Salomon was by no means the only one of its kind. Time brought about changes - it always had, but more gradually, not so conspicuously. There were gaps in the dining room, gaps at all seven tables, at the good Russian table as at the bad, at the lengthways and at the sideways. Not that this gave a reliable picture of the frequency of the house; arrivals, as always, had taken place; the rooms might be occupied, but these were guests who were restricted in their freedom of movement due to their final condition. In the dining room, as we said, many a person was missing thanks to the freedom of movement that still existed; but some even did it in a particularly deep and hollow way, as Dr. {544}cauliflower that was dead. More and more his face had taken on the expression as if he had something bad-tasting in his mouth; then he had become bedridden and then died—no one knew exactly when; the matter had been treated with all the usual consideration and discretion. A gap. Frau Stohr sat next to the gap and she dreaded it. So she moved to young Ziemssen's other side, to Miss Robinson's place, who had been dismissed as cured, opposite the teacher, Hans Castorp's left-hand neighbor, who had remained firmly at her post. All alone she was currently sitting on this side of the table, the other three seats were free. Student Rasmussen, who was getting duller and weaker every day, was bedridden and considered moribund; and the great-aunt was away with her niece and the high-breasted Marusja—we say ""away,"" as everyone said, because her return was a foregone conclusion in the near future. They would arrive again in the fall - could that be called a departure? How close was the summer solstice, once Pentecost was at hand; And when the longest day came, winter quickly went downhill – in short, the great-aunt and Marusja were almost back, and that was good, because the laughable Marusja was by no means healed and detoxified; the teacher knew something about tuberculous ulcers that brown-eyed Marusja was supposed to have on her voluptuous breast, and which had had to be operated on several times. When the teacher talked about it, Hans Castorp glanced hastily at Joachim, who had bent his blotchy face over his plate.","Was that well done? Hofrat Behrens raised shoulders and arms, and let the latter fall with a clap against his sides. At latest, he said, Frau Salomon would be back in the autumn—and for good and all. We shall be able to test the truth of his prophecy, for we are destined to spend yet much earthly time at this pleasure resort. But the Salomon case was far from being the only one of its kind. Time brought about many changes. Time always did—but more gradually, in the rule, not so strikingly. There were gaps at the tables, all seven of them, at the “good” as well as at the “bad” Russian table, and at those that stood transversely to the room. Not that this alone would have given an exact or fair picture of the situation; for there were always arrivals, as well as leave-takings, the bedrooms might be full—though there one dealt with patients whose condition had finally put an end to their exercising any choice in the matter. The gaps in the diningroom were partly due to the exercise of choice; but some of them yawned in a particularly hollow manner—as, for instance, at Dr. Blumenkohl’s place—he being dead. That expression he wore, as of something bad-tasting in the mouth, had grown more and more pronounced. Then he became permanently bedridden, and then he died—no one knew precisely when, his affair being disposed of with the usual tact and delicacy. A gap. Frau Stöhr sat next it—it made her shudder, so she moved over to Joachim Ziemssen’s other side, in the room of Miss Robinson, discharged cured, and opposite the schoolmistress, Hans Castorp’s neighbour, still faithful to her post. The latter was sitting, for the time, alone on her side of the table, for the other three places were free. The student Rasmussen had grown daily thinner and weaker, he was now bedridden, probably moribund. The great-aunt, with her niece and the fullbreasted Marusja, had gone a journey—that was the usual way to put it, because everybody knew they would be back again. They would certainly be back by autumn, so you could hardly say they had left. The summer solstice—once Whitsuntide was past—stood immediately before them; and after the longest day in the year they would go downhill with a rush, toward winter. At that rate the great-aunt and Marusja were as good as back again—which was as it should be, for the lively Marusja was very far from being cured, and the schoolmistress knew positively that the brown-eyed one had tuberculous ulcers on her swelling bosom, which had more than once already necessitated an operation. Hans Castorp, as Fräulein Engelhart said this, gave a hasty glance at Joachim bending sedulously over his plate a face gone all mottled.","Was that a wise thing to do? Director Behrens threw his arms above his shoulders and let them fall, noisily slapping his thighs. By autumn at the latest, he said, Frau Salomon would be back again—but then for good. Would he be proved right? We shall see—for we are bound to this cozy resort for many earthly days yet. But Frau Salomon’s case was certainly not the only one of its kind. Time brought forth changes—just as it always had, but those changes had been more gradual, not so striking. There were gaps now in the dining hall, at all seven tables, at both the Good and Bad Russian tables, at those set both lengthwise and crosswise. One could not, however, have gained from this fact a complete picture of the hotel’s occupancy rate; there had been arrivals as well, just as at any time of the year; rooms might very well be occupied, but by guests whose freedom of movement was limited by the final stages of their condition. But in the dining hall, as we have said, some persons were missing because they still had such freedom of movement. And others left a gap, a void, much more profound—like Dr. Blumenkohl, who was dead. That look on his face, as if he had something foul-tasting in his mouth, had become more and more pronounced; then he had been confined to his bed, and then he died—no one knew exactly when; the matter was handled with customary tact and discretion. A gap. Frau Stöhr sat next to the gap, and it made her shudder. And so she moved to the other side of young Ziemssen, to the place previously belonging to Miss Robinson, who had been released as cured; across from her now was the teacher, who still sat on Hans Castorp’s left, having held faithfully to her post. She was all alone on her side of the table, where three more places were now free. Rasmussen the student, who had daily grown thinner and more listless, was now bedridden and considered moribund; and the great-aunt had gone on a trip with her niece and Marusya of the prominent breasts. We say “on a trip,” because that is what everyone said, since it was understood that they would be returning soon enough. They would be back by autumn at the latest—how could one call that a departure? And how very near Midsummer Night already was, especially with Pentecost just around the corner; and once the longest day had come and gone, the year raced downhill from there, toward winter—so that in a way the great-aunt and Marusya were as good as back again. And that was a fine thing, because laughter-loving Marusya was not cured and detoxified by any means; Fräulein Engelhart knew all about some tubercular tumors brown-eyed Marusya had on her full bosom, which had been operated on several times already. And when the teacher shared this information, Hans Castorp glanced furtively at Joachim, whose face had turned blotchy and was bent down over his plate."
"»Ich?« wiederholte sie wieder mit einem Erstaunen, das etwas anderem mehr als seiner Forderung zu gelten schien. In einer gewissen Verwirrung lächelnd blieb sie noch stehen, folgte aber dann seiner magnetisierenden Rückwärtsbewegung ein paar Schritte gegen den Bowlentisch.","""Me?"" she repeated again, with an astonishment that seemed to apply to something other than his demand. Smiling in a certain confusion, she remained standing, but then followed his magnetizing backward movement a few steps towards the bowling table.","“I?” she said again, with an inflection of surprise which seemed to have reference to something else than his invitation. She stood a moment in smiling confusion, then as if magnetized followed him a few steps toward the punch-table.","“Do you mean me?” she said again, and this time her astonishment seemed directed at more than his request. At first she stood there smiling in some confusion, but then, as if pulled by a magnetic force, followed him as he backed away toward the punch table."
"»Der Irrtum der Literaten besteht in dem Glauben, daß nur der Geist anständig mache. Es ist eher das Gegenteil wahr. Nur wo kein Geist ist, gibt es Anständigkeit.«",»The error of the literati consists in the belief that only the spirit makes decent. Rather the opposite is true. There is decency only where there is no spirit.«,sententiously added: “The mistake you literary men make is in thinking that only the spirit makes for virtue. It is nearer the truth to say that only where there is no spirit is there true virtue.”,“The error of literary men is to believe that only the Spirit makes us respectable. The opposite is closer to the truth. Only where there is no Spirit are we respectable.”

But you misunderstand me, the natural event I am talking about is not current, it happened about a hundred and fifty years ago...""","“You misunderstand me. En passant, let me say it is a pity, and very indicative of the spirit of this place, that you neglect to read the papers. But you misunderstand me, the convulsion of nature to which I refer is not modern. It took place some hundred and fifty years ago.”","“You misunderstand me. Nevertheless, I would note that it is regrettable—though characteristic of the institution—that you have neglected to read what the press has to say.

"Das war nicht schlecht. Ob er etwa verlange, daß das unselige Opfer der Gesellschaft sich ernstlich schuldig fühle und den Weg zur Blutbühne aus Überzeugung gehe?",That was not bad. Did he demand that the unfortunate victim of society feel seriously guilty and go to the blood stage out of conviction?,"It could only add to its authority and its awfulness. Oh, so he demanded that the unhappy victim of social maladjustment be convinced of his own sinfulness, and tread in full conviction the path to the scaffold?","Not bad. So he was demanding that society’s unlucky victims should feel terribly guilty and enter the bloody arena out of personal conviction, was that it?"
"»Ihr habt sie,« rief Settembrini, »ihr habt sie studiert, daß ihr {785}schwitztet, diese alten Dichter und Philosophen, habt euch ihr kostbares Erbe anzueignen versucht, wie ihr das Material der antiken Bauwerke für eure Bethäuser benutztet! Denn ihr fühltet wohl, daß ihr aus eigener Kraft eurer proletarischen Seele keine neue Kunstform hervorzubringen vermöchtet und hofftet, das Altertum mit seinen eigenen Waffen zu schlagen. So wird es wieder, so wird es immer gehen! Euere ungehobelte Morgendlichkeit wird sich in die Schule begeben müssen bei dem, was zu verachten ihr euch und andere bereden möchtet; denn ohne Bildung bestündet ihr nicht vor dem Angesicht der Menschheit, und es gibt nur eine Bildung: diejenige, die ihr die bürgerliche nennt, und die die menschliche ist!« Eine Frage von Jahrzehnten – das Ende des humanistischen Erziehungsprinzips? Nur Höflichkeit hinderte Herrn Settembrini, in ein ebenso sorgloses wie spöttisches Gelächter auszubrechen. Ein Europa, das sein Ewigkeitsgut zu wahren wisse, werde über proletarische Apokalypsen, die man da und dort zu erträumen beliebe, in Gemütsruhe zur Tagesordnung klassischer Vernunft übergehen.","""You have them,"" cried Settembrini, ""you studied them, so that you sweated, those old poets and philosophers, you tried to appropriate their precious inheritance, just as you used the material of ancient buildings for your houses of prayer! For you well felt that you could not bring forth a new art form with the strength of your proletarian soul and hoped to defeat antiquity with its own weapons. It will be like this again, it will always be like this! Your uncouth morningness will have to go to school in what you would like to talk about despising yourselves and others; for without education you would not exist in the face of mankind, and there is only one education: what you call bourgeois education and which is humane!« A question of decades - the end of the humanistic principle of education? Only politeness prevented Mr. Settembrini from bursting into a laugh that was as careless as it was mocking. A Europe that knows how to protect its eternity good will go over proletarian apocalypses that one can dream up here and there in peace of mind to the agenda of classical reason.","“You studied them,” Settembrini cried out, “you studied them till you sweated, those old poets and philosophers; you have sought to make their priceless heritage your own, as you used the building-stones of their monuments to erect your churches. For well you knew that your proletarian soul could of its own strength bring no art form to birth; and you hoped to defeat antiquity with its own weapons. So it will ever be, history will repeat itself. Your crude immaturity must go to school to the power which you would like to persuade yourself and others to despise; for without discipline you could not endure in the sight of man, and there is but one kind, that which you call the bourgeois, but which is in reality the human.” Herr Settembrini went on. A matter of decades? The end of the humanistic principles of education? Only politeness prevented him from a burst of laughter both unaffected and mocking. A Europe that knew how to preserve its immortal treasures would serenely pass over any proletarian apocalypse of which it here and there pleased people to dream and resume its ordered programme of the reign of classic reason.","“You Christians studied them,” Settembrini exclaimed, “studied the classical poets and philosophers until you broke out in a sweat, attempted to make their precious heritage your own, just as you used the stones of their ancient edifices for your meeting houses. Because you were well aware that no new art could come from your own proletarian souls and hoped to defeat antiquity with its own weapons. And so it will be again, so it will always be. And you with your crude visions of a new morning will likewise have to be taught by those whom —so at least you would like to persuade yourselves, and others—you despise. For without education you cannot prevail before humanity, and there is only one kind of education—you call it bourgeois, but in fact it is human.” A question of decades—until the end of humanistic education? Only good manners prevented Herr Settembrini from breaking into mocking, carefree laughter. A Europe that knew how to preserve its eternal treasures would coolly, calmly proceed with the agenda of classical reason and ignore any proletarian apocalypses that might be envisioned here or there."
"Hans Castorp und Joachim wandten die Köpfe von Settembrini zu Naphta, der erstere schneller, als der andere. Naphta antwortete:","Hans Castorp and Joachim turned Settembrini's heads to Naphta, the former faster than the other. Naphta replied:","Hans Castorp and Joachim—the first faster than the second—turned their heads from Settembrini to Naphta. Naphta replied: “There can be no such triumphs as those you speak of; for the authority is man himself—his interests, his worth, his salvation—and thus between it and truth no conflict is possible.","Heads turned from Settembrini to Naphta— Hans Castorp’s more quickly than Joachim’s. “Such a triumph is an impossibility,” Naphta replied, “because the authority is man himself—his interests, his dignity, his salvation—and there can be no contradiction between man and truth."
"Joachims Überführung in die Heimat war beschlossene Sache, und Haus Berghof sorgte für alles, was dazu erforderlich war und sonst schicklich und stattlich schien, – Mutter und Vetter brauchten sich kaum zu regen. Am nächsten Tage, in seinem seidenen Manschettenhemd, Blumen auf der Decke, ruhend in matter Schneehelligkeit, war Joachim noch schöner geworden als unmittelbar nach dem Übertritt. Jede Spur der Anstrengung war nun aus seinem Gesicht gewichen; erkaltet, hatte es sich zu reinster, schweigender Form befestigt. Kurzes Gekräusel seines dunklen Haares fiel in die unbewegliche, gelbliche Stirn, die aus einem edlen, aber heiklen Stoff zwischen Wachs und Marmor gebildet schien, und in dem ebenfalls etwas gekrausten Bart wölbten die Lippen sich voll und stolz. Ein antiker Helm hätte diesem Haupte wohl angestanden, wie mehrere der Besucher meinten, die sich zum Abschiede einfanden.","Joachim's transfer home was a done deal, and the Berghof house took care of everything that was necessary and otherwise seemed fitting and stately - mother and cousin hardly had to move. The next day, in his silk shirt with cuffs, flowers on the blanket, resting in the dull snowy brightness, Joachim had become even more beautiful than immediately after the conversion. All trace of the effort was now gone from his face; cooled, it had settled into the purest, most silent form. Short curls of his dark hair fell over his immobile, yellowish forehead, which seemed to be made of a noble but delicate material between wax and marble, and his lips arched full and proud in his beard, which was also somewhat frizzy. An antique helmet would have suited this head, as several of the visitors who came to say goodbye thought.","It had been decided to take Joachim home; and House Berghof assumed the arrangements, doing all that was necessary or that could add to the dignity or stateliness of the occasion. Mother and cousin needed not to lift a finger. By next day Joachim lay in his silk dress-shirt, with flowers about him on the coverlet, looking, in the midst of all this white, more beautiful than immediately after death. Every trace of strain was gone from the features, they had composed themselves, growing cold, into a silent purity of form. Curling dark locks fell upon the yellowish brow, that seemed to be of some fine brittle stuff between wax and marble; through the crisp hair of the beard, the lips showed full and curling. An antique helmet would have become this head—as many of the guests remarked, who came to take last leave of Joachim.","It was agreed that Joachim should be returned home, and the Berghof took care of all arrangements necessary for the transport and whatever else seemed fitting and stately. His mother and cousin barely had to lift a finger. By morning, Joachim lay on his bed dressed in a ruffled shirt and with flowers placed beside him, and in the bright light reflected off the snow he looked even more handsome than he had at his passing. Every trace of strain was gone from his face; it had stiffened as it turned cold and was now pure, silent form. Little dark curls fell down across his immobile, yellowish brow, which looked as if it were made of some noble, yet delicate material halfway between wax and marble, and the arch of his lips was full and proud under his slightly curly moustache. An antique helmet would have looked good on that head, as was noted by several visitors who came by to say farewell."
"Dies war des Hofrats Art und Weise, Trost zu spenden. Wir wollen hoffen, daß sie der verständigen Frau Ziemßen ein bißchen wohltat; und seine Zusicherungen trafen denn ja ziemlich weitgehend auch ein. Der schwache Joachim schlief viele Stunden lang in diesen letzten Tagen, träumte auch wohl, was zu träumen ihm angenehm war, Flachländisch-Militärisches also, nehmen wir an; und wenn er erwachte und man ihn nach seinem Befinden fragte, so antwortete er, wenn auch undeutlich, stets, daß er sich wohl und glücklich fühle, – obgleich er fast keinen Puls mehr hatte und schließlich den Einstich der Injektionsspritze überhaupt nicht mehr spürte, – sein Körper war unempfindlich, man hätte ihn brennen und zwacken können, es wäre den guten Joachim bereits nicht mehr angegangen.","This was the Councilor's way of giving consolation. Let's hope that she did the sensible Frau Ziemssen a little good; and his assurances came true to a large extent. The weak Joachim slept for many hours during these last few days, and he also dreamed what he liked to dream, that is, lowland military things, let's assume; and when he woke up and was asked how he was, he always answered, though indistinctly, that he felt well and happy—although his pulse was almost gone and finally he didn’t feel the injection of the hypodermic at all— his body was insensitive, one could have burned and pinched it, it would no longer have concerned good Joachim.","Which was the Hofrat’s way of administering consolation. We may hope that the reasonable Frau Ziemssen drew comfort therefrom; his assurances, at least, were in a very large degree justified by the event. Joachim, in these days, slept many hours, out of weakness, and probably dreamed of the flat-land and the service and whatever else was pleasant to him to dream. When he roused, and they asked how he felt, he would answer a little incoherently, yet always that he felt well and happy. This though he had scarcely any pulse, and at the end could no longer feel the hypodermic needle. His body was insensitive, you might have burned or pinched the flesh, he was past feeling.","This was the director’s way of offering consolation. We shall hope it did some good with a woman as reasonable as Frau Ziemssen. And his assurances did turn out, for the most part, as predicted. In his weakened state, Joachim slept for many hours during his final days, and probably dreamed dreams he thought pleasant—of military maneuvers in the flatlands, we assume. And when he did awaken and was asked how he felt, he would always answer, though somewhat indistinctly, that he felt fine and happy—although he had hardly any pulse left and ultimately did not even notice the prick of the hypodermic. His body felt nothing; they could have burned and pinched him, it would have made no difference to Joachim at that point."

"Nicht, daß der Hofrat überrascht gewesen wäre. Er wäre es auf keinen Fall gewesen, war es aber besonders nicht, weil Hans Castorp ihn, gefragt oder ungefragt, über Joachims Ergehen auf dem laufenden gehalten und schon im Mai Bettlägerigkeit signalisiert hatte.","Not that the privy councilor was surprised. It certainly wouldn't have been him, but it certainly wasn't, because Hans Castorp, asked or not, had kept him up to date on Joachim's condition and had signaled that he was bedridden as early as May.","Not that the Hofrat was surprised, nor would have been in any case. But he had also been kept informed of Joachim’s progress; Hans Castorp told him, whether asked or unasked, and he knew that Joachim had been in bed in May.",Not that the director was in the least surprised. He would not have been in any case; Hans Castorp had kept him informed right along about Joachim’s condition—whether he had inquired or not—and the bed rest in May had been signal enough.
"»Sapristi, Ingenieur, Sie legen da philosophische Gaben an den Tag, deren ich mich gar nicht von Ihnen versehen hätte! Ihrer Theorie zufolge müßten Sie weniger gesund sein, als Sie sich den Anschein geben, da Sie offenbar Geist besitzen. Erlauben Sie mir aber, Ihnen zu bemerken, daß ich Ihren Deduktionen nicht folgen kann, daß ich sie ablehne, ja ihnen in wirklicher Feindseligkeit gegenüberstehe. Ich bin, wie Sie mich da sehen, ein wenig unduldsam in geistigen Dingen und lasse mich lieber einen Pedanten schelten, als daß ich Ansichten unbekämpft ließe, die mir so bekämpfenswert scheinen wie die von Ihnen entwickelten …«","“Sapristi, engineer, you are displaying philosophical gifts that I would not have expected from you! According to your theory, since you appear to have spirit, you must be less sane than you appear to be. But allow me to tell you that I cannot follow your deductions, that I reject them, that I am actually hostile to them. I am, as you see me, a little intolerant of spiritual things, and would rather allow myself to be scolded by a pedant than leave unchallenged views which seem to me as worthy of combat as those which you have developed...""","But now he said: “Sapristi, Engineer! You are displaying a most unexpected gift of philosophy! By your own theory, you must be yourself more ailing than you look, you are so obviously possessed of esprit. But, if you will permit me to say so, I can hardly subscribe to your deductions; I must deny them; my position is one of absolute dissent. I am, as you see, rather intolerant than otherwise in things of the intellect; I would rather be reproached as a pedant than suffer to pass unchallenged a point of view which seemed to me so untenable as this of yours.”","“Sapristi, my good engineer,” he said now, “you exhibit philosophical talents that I would never have expected of you. According to your theory, you would have to be less healthy than you give the appearance of being, since you apparently possess an intellect. Permit me to observe, however, that I cannot follow your deductions, that I reject them, indeed, that I stand in positive opposition to them. I am, as you see, a little impatient in matters intellectual and would prefer to be denounced as a pedant rather than to leave uncontested views I consider to be as deserving of refutation as those that you have formulated here.”"
"»Selbstredend«, sagte Joachim. »Wovon denn sonst. Es ist ja nun einmal sein Thema.«","""Of course,"" said Joachim. ""Of what else? After all, it's his subject.""",What did he say about it to-day?”,"“But of course,” Joachim said. “What else? It is his topic, after all.”"
"»Spöttisch? Sie meinen: boshaft. Ja, boshaft bin ich ein wenig –«, sagte Settembrini. »Mein Kummer ist, daß ich verurteilt bin, meine Bosheit an so elende Gegenstände zu verschwenden. Ich hoffe, Sie haben nichts gegen die Bosheit, Ingenieur? In meinen Augen ist sie die glänzendste Waffe der Vernunft gegen die Mächte der Finsternis und der Häßlichkeit. Bosheit, mein Herr, ist der Geist der Kritik, und Kritik bedeutet den Ursprung des Fortschrittes und der Aufklärung.« Und im Nu begann er von Petrarca zu reden, den er den »Vater der Neuzeit« nannte.","»Mocking? You mean: mischievous. Yes, I'm a little mischievous -' said Settembrini. 'My sorrow is that I am doomed to squander my wickedness on such wretched objects. I hope you don't mind the malice, Engineer? In my eyes it is reason's brightest weapon against the forces of darkness and ugliness. Malice, sir, is the spirit of criticism, and criticism is the origin of progress and enlightenment.' And in a moment he began to speak of Petrarch, whom he called 'the father of modern times'.","“A mocker? You mean I am malicious? Well, yes, perhaps I am a little,” said Settembrini. “My great complaint is that it is my fate to spend my malice upon such insignificant objects. I hope, Engineer, you have nothing against malice? In my eyes, it is reason’s keenest dart against the powers of darkness and ugliness. Malice, my dear sir, is the animating spirit of criticism; and criticism is the beginning of progress and enlightenment.” And he began to talk about Petrarch, whom he called the father of the modern spirit.","“Sarcastic? You mean malicious. Yes, I am a little malicious,” Settembrini said. “My great worry is that I have been condemned to waste my malice on such miserable objects. I hope that you have nothing against malice, my good engineer. In my eyes it is the brightest sword that reason has against the powers of darkness and ugliness. Malice, sir, is the spirit of criticism, and criticism marks the origin of progress and enlightenment.” And all of a sudden he began to speak about Petrarch, whom he called the “Father of Modernity.”"
"Von Weihnachten! Nein, daran hatte Hans Castorp noch nicht gedacht. Er hatte leicht sagen und schreiben können, daß er kraft ärztlichen Befundes mit Joachim den Winter hier werde zubringen müssen. Aber das schloß ein, wie sich nun zeigte, daß er hier Weihnachten verleben sollte, und das hatte ohne Zweifel etwas Erschreckendes für das Gemüt, schon deshalb, aber nicht ganz allein deshalb, weil er diese Zeit überhaupt noch niemals anderswo als in der Heimat, im Schoß der Familie, verlebt hatte. In Gottes Namen denn, das wollte nun in {409}den Kauf genommen sein. Er war kein Kind mehr, Joachim schien auch weiter keinen Anstoß daran zu nehmen, sondern sich ohne Weinerlichkeit damit abzufinden, und wo nicht überall und unter welchen Umständen war in der Welt schon Weihnachten begangen worden!","From Christmas! No, Hans Castorp hadn't thought of that. It was easy for him to say and write that, based on medical evidence, he would have to spend the winter here with Joachim. But that included, as it now turned out, that he was supposed to spend Christmas here, and that undoubtedly had something frightening for the mind, if only because, but not solely because he had never spent this time anywhere else than at home, in the bosom of the family. In God's name, then, {409}that wanted to be taken into account. He wasn't a child anymore, Joachim didn't seem to take offense at it either, but put up with it without weeping, and where not everywhere in the world and under what circumstances had Christmas already been celebrated!","Christmas! Hans Castorp had never once thought of it. To be sure, he had blithely said, and written, that he must spend the winter up here with Joachim, because of what the doctors had discovered to be the state of his health. But now he was startled to realize that Christmas would be included in the programme—perhaps because (and yet not entirely because) he had never spent the Christmas season anywhere but in the bosom of the family. Well, if he must he must; he would have to put up with it. He was no longer a child; Joachim seemed not to mind, or else to have adjusted himself uncomplainingly to the prospect; and, after all, he said to himself, think of all the places and all the conditions in which Christmas has been celebrated before now!","Christmas! No, Hans Castorp had not even given it a thought until now. He had found it easy to talk or write letters about his doctor’s discovery and having to spend the winter here with Joachim. But that also meant, as was now evident, that he would spend Christmas here, and without a doubt there was something unsettling about the idea, for he had never once spent the holidays anywhere but at home, in the bosom of his family. Good God —so that was part of the bargain, too. But he was no longer a child. Joachim seemed to have no trouble with the notion, had resigned himself to it without whining—and after all, Christmas had surely been celebrated around the world under a great variety of circumstances."
"»Doch nicht, Mynheer Peeperkorn. Nein, da glaube ich Sie völlig beruhigen zu können. Es ist ja von menschlichen Dingen die Rede, – das Wort ›menschlich‹ im Sinne der Freiheit und der Genialität genommen, – verzeihen Sie den möglicherweise etwas geschraubten Ausdruck, aber der Bedarfsfall brachte mich kürzlich dazu, ihn mir anzueignen.«","'No, Mynheer Peeperkorn. No, I think I can put your mind at rest completely. We're talking about human things - the word 'human' taken in the sense of freedom and genius - forgive the possibly somewhat screwed expression, but recently the need made me adopt it.""","“I don’t feel it so, Mynheer Peeperkorn. I think I can set your mind at rest on that point. These are human topics we are treating of; human in the sense that they have to do with freedom and the spirituel— you must pardon me if I use a rather ambiguous terminology, but I needed the expression lately, and made it my own.”","“Surely not, Mynheer Peeperkorn. No, I think I can set your mind at ease there. We are speaking of human realities—and thus of matters ‘humane,’ in the sense of freedom and genius, if you will forgive me the somewhat stilted phraseology. But only recently I had occasion to make use of just such terms.”"
"Hans Castorp, dessen Aufmerksamkeit nur halb beim Gespräch gewesen war, da die Person des anwesenden Kriegers und Vertreters vornehmer Wesentlichkeit, oder eigentlich der neuartige Ausdruck seiner Augen ihn beschäftigte, fuhr etwas zusammen, da er sich durch Herrn Settembrinis letzte Worte aufgerufen und angefordert fühlte, machte dann aber ein Gesicht, wie damals, als Settembrini ihn zur Entscheidung zwischen »Ost und West« feierlich hatte nötigen wollen: ein Gesicht also voller Vorbehalt und Widerspenstigkeit, und schwieg. Alles stellten sie auf die Spitze, diese zwei, wie es wohl nötig war, wenn man streiten wollte, und haderten erbittert um äußerste Wahlfälle, während ihm doch schien, als ob irgendwo inmitten zwischen den strittigen Unleidlichkeiten, zwischen rednerischem Humanismus und analphabetischer Barbarei das gelegen sein müsse, was man als das Menschliche oder Humane persönlich ansprechen durfte. Aber er sprach es nicht an, um nicht beide Geister zu ärgern, und sah, eingehüllt in Vorbehalt, wie sie weiter dahin trieben und einander feindlich behilflich waren, vom Hundertsten ins Tausendste zu kommen, nachdem Settembrini mit seinem kleinen Scherz vom Lateiner Virgil den Anstoß gegeben.","Hans Castorp, whose attention was only half focused on the conversation, since the personality of the present warrior and representative of aristocratic importance, or actually the novel expression of his eyes occupied him, started a little, since he felt called and requested by Herr Settembrini's last words, but then he made a face like he had when Settembrini had solemnly wanted to force him to decide between ""East and West"": a face full of reservation and obstinacy, and said nothing. They took everything to the extreme, these two, as was necessary if one wanted to argue, and quarreled bitterly over the most extreme cases, while it seemed to him as if that lay somewhere in the midst of the disputed insufficiencies, between rhetorical humanism and illiterate barbarism must be what one could personally address as the humane. But he didn't mention it, so as not to annoy both spirits, and he watched, shrouded in reservation, how they drifted on and hostilely helped each other to get from the hundredth to the thousandth, after Settembrini had kicked off with his little joke from the Latin Virgil given.","Hans Castorp had been only half listening to the dialogue, being preoccupied by the fundamental nobility of the soldierly representative then present—or rather by the strange new expression in his eyes. He started slightly as he felt himself challenged by Herr Settembrini’s last words, and made such a face as he had the time the humanist would have solemnly constrained him to a choice between East and West: a face full of reserve and obstinacy. He said nothing. They forced everything to an issue, these two—as perhaps one must when one differed—and wrangled bitterly over extremes, whereas it seemed to him, Hans Castorp, as though somewhere between two intolerable positions, between bombastic humanism and analphabetic barbarism, must be something which one might personally call the human. He did not express his thought, for fear of irritating one or other of them; but, wrapped in his reserve, listened to one goading the other on, each leading the other from hundredthly to thousandthly, and all because of Herr Settembrini’s original little joke about Virgil.","Hans Castorp’s attention had been directed only partly to the conversation, for he was preoccupied with the presence of a warrior, of a person who was the representative of genuine nobility, or rather with the new look in that person’s eyes, and he flinched at Herr Settembrini’s last words, sensing that they had been addressed to him and demanded an answer; but then he merely made the same face he had made the day Settembrini had solemnly tried to force him to decide between “East and West”—a face, that is, full of reservations and obstinacy—and said nothing. They carried everything to extremes, these two, as was probably necessary for the sake of argument, and squabbled fiercely over the most extreme choices, whereas it seemed to him that what one might, in a spirit of conciliation, declare truly human or humane had to lie somewhere in the middle of this intolerant contentiousness, somewhere between rhetorical humanism and illiterate barbarism. But to avoid annoying either man, he did not say this, and watched, wrapped in reservations, as they went at it, spitefully helping one another to get lost in a thousand trivialities, all because Settembrini had made a little joke about Virgil the Latin poet."
"In Wirklichkeit waren es noch andere Gründe, als nur der körperliche, die dem jungen Hans Castorp sein Vorhaben eingegeben hatten. Ihm war, als ob an seinem hitzigen Kopf, dem schlechten Geschmack, den er meistens im Munde hatte, und dem willkürlichen Klopfen seines Herzens viel weniger die Schwierigkeiten der Akklimatisation schuld seien, als solche Dinge, wie das Treiben des russischen Ehepaars nebenan, die Reden der kranken und dummen Frau Stöhr bei Tische, des Herrenreiters weicher Husten, den er täglich auf den Korridoren vernahm, die Äußerungen Herrn Albins, die Eindrücke, die er von den Verkehrssitten der leidenden Jugend empfangen hatte, der Gesichtsausdruck Joachims, wenn er Marusja betrachtete, und dergleichen Wahrnehmungen mehr. Er dachte, es müsse gut sein, dem Bannkreise des »Berghofes« einmal zu entkommen, im Freien tief aufzuatmen und sich tüchtig zu rühren, um, wenn man abends müde war, doch wenigstens zu wissen, warum. Und so trennte er sich denn unternehmend von Joachim, als dieser nach dem Frühstück seinen dienstlich abgemessenen Lustwandel nach der Bank an der Wasserrinne antrat, und marschierte stockschwenkend die Fahrstraße hinab seine eigenen Wege.","In reality, there were reasons other than physical ones that prompted young Hans Castorp to pursue his plan. He felt as if the troubles of acclimatization were much less to blame for his hot head, the bad taste he had most of the time in his mouth, and the random beating of his heart than such things as the doings of the Russian couple next door, the speeches the sick and stupid Frau Stöhr at the table, the Herrenreiter's soft cough which he heard every day in the corridors, the remarks made by Herr Albin, the impressions he had received of the manners of the suffering youth, the facial expression of Joachim when he looked at Marusja, and similar perceptions more. He thought it must be good to escape the spell of the ""Berghof"" for once, breathe deeply in the open air and move vigorously, so that when you were tired in the evening you at least knew why. And so he parted company with Joachim, when he started his officially measured stroll after breakfast to the bench by the gully, and marched down the road his own way, waving his stick.","In reality young Hans Castorp had more ground than the physical for his present resolve. His over-heated head, the prevailing bad taste in his mouth, the fitful throbbing of his heart, were, or so he felt, less evil accompaniments to the process of acclimatization than such things as the goings-on of the Russian pair next door, the table-talk of the stupid and afflicted Frau Stöhr, the gentleman rider’s pulpy cough daily heard in the corridor, the utterances of Herr Albin, the impression he received of the manners and morals of the ailing young folk about him, the expression on Joachim’s face when he looked at Marusja—these and a hundred observations more made him feel it would be good to escape awhile from the Berghof circle, to breathe the air deep into his lungs, to get some proper exercise—and then, when he felt tired at night, he would at least know why. He took leave of Joachim in a spirit of enterprise, when his cousin addressed himself, after breakfast, to the usual round as far as the bench by the watercourse; then, swinging his walking-stick, he took his own way down the road.","In reality, there were other reasons beyond the purely physical that had put this idea into young Hans Castorp’s head. It seemed to him that his difficulties in acclimatizing himself had less to do with his flushed face, or the bad taste he usually had in his mouth, or the pounding of his heart, and more with things like the activities of the Russian couple next door, the table talk of someone as sick and stupid as Frau Stöhr, the Austrian horseman’s flabby cough that he heard every day in the corridor, Herr Albin’s opinions, the impression left on him by the social customs of sickly adolescents, the expression on Joachim’s face when he looked at Marusya, and all sorts of similar matters he had observed. He thought it could only do him good to break the grip of the Berghof for once, to breathe deep of the open air, to get some real exercise, and if one was going to be exhausted of an evening, at least to know the reason why. And so after breakfast, he boldly took his departure from Joachim—who dutifully started out on his measured promenade up to the bench beside the water trough—and swinging his walking stick, he now marched off down the main road on his own."
"»Ja, es hilft alles nichts, es müssen nun Schritte geschehen. Sie erwarten dich ja zu Hause.«","»Yes, nothing helps, steps must now be taken. They're expecting you at home.""","He sat down by the bed and said, with a sigh: “Yes, it’s no good; we must act—they are expecting you down home.”",We have to do something. They’re expecting you at home.”

"Der Italiener verstummte. Hans Castorp fühlte seine schwarzen Augen, den Blick von Vernunft und Sittlichkeit, in tiefer Trauer auf sich ruhen, legte indessen noch eine Weile weiter, bevor er, die Wange in die Hand gestützt, mit der falschen und verstockten Unschuldsmiene eines bösen Kindes zu dem vor ihm stehenden Mentor aufblickte.","The Italian fell silent. Hans Castorp felt his black eyes, the gaze of reason and morality, resting on him in deep sorrow, but he continued for a while, leaning his cheek on his hand, with the false and stubborn innocent expression of a wicked child Mentor standing by him looked up.","The Italian was silent. Hans Castorp felt the black eyes, the eyes of reason and morality, bent in sorrow upon him. He played on for a while; then, resting his cheek in his hand, looked up at his mentor with the innocent, impenitent air of a naughty child.","The Italian said nothing. Hans Castorp could feel those black eyes, that gaze of reason and morality, resting in deep mourning upon him, but went right on laying out his cards for a while, before he finally laid his cheek in one hand and stared up with a naughty child’s sullen look of false innocence."
"»Nun,« sagte Joachim, »das wäre das wenigste. Du brauchst dir nur einen zu kaufen. Hier sind überall Thermometer zu haben, beinahe in jedem Laden.«","'Well,' said Joachim, 'that would be the least. You only need to buy one. There are thermometers everywhere here, almost every shop.”","“Well,” Joachim said, “that is the least of your difficulties. You can get one anywhere—they sell them in almost every shop.”","“Well,” Joachim said, “that’s no problem whatever. You need only to buy one. There are thermometers for sale here everywhere, in almost any shop.”"
"Eigentlich war der Disput von Karen Karstedt ausgegangen, der armen Karen mit den offenen Fingerspitzen, die neulich gestorben war. Hans Castorp hatte nichts von ihrer plötzlichen Verschlechterung und ihrem Exitus gewußt; sonst hätte er gern an ihrem Begräbnis kameradschaftlich teilgenommen, – bei seiner eingestandenen Vorliebe für Begräbnisse überhaupt. Aber die ortsübliche Diskretion hatte gewollt, daß er zu spät von Karens Hintritt erfahren hatte, und daß sie schon in den Garten des Puttengottes mit der schiefen Schneemütze zu endgültig horizontaler Lage eingegangen war. Requiem aeter{678}nam … Er widmete ihrem Andenken einige freundliche Worte, was Herrn Settembrini darauf brachte, sich spöttisch über Hansens charitative Betätigung, seine Besuche bei Leila Gerngroß, dem geschäftlichen Rotbein, der überfüllten Zimmermann, dem prahlerischen Sohne Tous-les-deux’ und der qualvollen Natalie von Mallinckrodt zu äußern und noch nachträglich über die teueren Blumen sich aufzuhalten, mit denen der Ingenieur diesem ganzen trostlosen und ridikülen Gelichter Devotion erwiesen habe. Hans Castorp hatte darauf hingewiesen, daß die Empfänger seiner Aufmerksamkeiten, mit vorläufiger Ausnahme der Frau von Mallinckrodt und des Knaben Teddy, ja auch ganz ernstlich gestorben seien, worauf Settembrini fragte, ob das sie etwa respektabler mache. Es gebe aber doch etwas, entgegnete Hans Castorp, was man die christliche Reverenz vor dem Elend nennen könne. Und ehe Settembrini ihn zurechtweisen konnte, begann Naphta von frommen Ausschreitungen der Liebestätigkeit zu reden, die das Mittelalter gesehen, erstaunlichen Fällen von Fanatismus und Verzückung in der Krankenpflege: Königstöchter hatten die stinkenden Wunden Aussätziger geküßt, hatten sich geradezu mit Absicht an Leprosen angesteckt und die Schwären, die sie sich zugezogen, dann ihre Rosen genannt, hatten das Wasser ausgetrunken, womit sie Eiternde gewaschen, und danach erklärt, nie habe ihnen etwas so gut geschmeckt.","Actually, the dispute had started with Karen Karstedt, the poor Karen with the open fingertips who had recently died. Hans Castorp had known nothing of her sudden deterioration and death; otherwise he would gladly have attended her funeral in a comradely manner—with his confessed fondness for funerals in general. But local discretion had meant that he had learned too late about Karen's departure and that she had already entered the garden of the putti god with the crooked snow cap in a finally horizontal position. Requiem aeter{678}nam … He dedicated a few kind words to her memory, which made Herr Settembrini scoff at Hansen's charitable activities, his visits to Leila Gerngross, the busy Rotbein, the overcrowded carpenter, the boastful son Tous-les-deux ' and to the anguished Natalie von Mallinckrodt and to dwell afterwards on the expensive flowers with which the engineer had shown devotion to this whole desolate and ridiculous bunch. Hans Castorp had pointed out that the recipients of his attentions, with the temporary exception of Frau von Mallinckrodt and the boy Teddy, had also died quite seriously, whereupon Settembrini asked whether that made them any more respectable. But there is something, replied Hans Castorp, that one could call Christian reverence for misery. And before Settembrini could rebuke him, Naphta began to speak of pious excesses of charity which the Middle Ages had seen, astounding cases of fanaticism and ecstasy in nursing: kings' daughters had kissed the fetid sores of lepers, had contracted lepers almost on purpose, and the Sores she had contracted, then called her roses, had drunk the water with which she washed those who were suppurating, and afterwards declared that nothing had ever tasted so good to them.","The discussion had grown out of a reference somebody made to Karen Karstedt, poor Karen with the open finger-ends, whose death had lately occurred. Hans Castorp had heard nothing of her sudden turn for the worse and final exit, else he would gladly have assisted at the last rites, as a comradely attention, if not simply out of his confessed liking for funerals. But the local practice of discretion had prevented him from hearing of it until too late. Karen had gone to take up the horizontal for good, in the garden of the Cupid with the crooked snow-cap. Requiem œternam. He dedicated a few friendly words to her memory, interrupted by Herr Settembrini, who began making game of his pupil’s charitable activities, his visits to Leila Gerngross, Rotbein the business man, the “overfilled” Frau Zimmermann, the braggart son of Tous-lesdeux, and the afflicted Natalie von Mallinckrodt. He censured Hans Castorp in retrospect for paying tribute in costly flowers to that dismal, ridiculous crew; and Hans Castorp replied that with the temporary exception of Frau von Mallinckrodt and the boy Teddy, the recipients of his attentions had now in all seriousness died—to which Herr Settembrini retorted by asking if that made them any more respectable. Well, after all, Hans Castorp responded, wasn’t there such a thing as Christian reverence before suffering? Before Settembrini could put him down, Naphta interposed, and began to speak of the devout excesses manifested by pious souls in the Middle Ages, astounding cases of fanatic devotion and ecstasy in the care of the sick: kings’ daughters kissing the stinking wounds of lepers, voluntarily exposing themselves to contagion and calling the ulcers they received their “roses”; or drinking the water that had been used for the cleansing of abscesses, and vowing that nothing had ever tasted so good.","Actually the dispute had started over Karen Karstedt—poor Karen with the open sores on her fingers, who had died recently. Hans Castorp had been unaware of her sudden turn for the worse and exitus; otherwise he would gladly have taken part in her burial, both out of friendship and his admitted love of funerals in general. But the local custom of discretion had meant that he learned of Karen’s demise too late and that she had already been placed in a permanent horizontal position, in the garden of the cupid whose snowy cap was cocked to one side. Requiem aeternam. He offered a few friendly words in her memory, which inspired Herr Settembrini to make sarcastic remarks about Hans’s charitable activities—his visits to Leila Gerngross, business-minded Rotbein, overblown Frau Zimmermann, the braggart son of Tous-les-deux, and the tormented Natalie von Mallinckrodt—and then went on to sneer at the expensive flowers with which the engineer had shown his devotion to such a totally wretched and ridiculous crew. Hans Castorp had then pointed out that those who had received his attentions, with the exception, for now, of Frau von Mallinckrodt and the lad named Teddy, were all quite dead; in response, Settembrini asked whether that made them any more respectable. There was such a thing, Hans Castorp replied, that one might call Christian reverence for human misery. And before Settembrini could rebuke him, Naphta began to speak of pious excesses of charity witnessed in the Middle Ages, amazing examples of fanaticism and ecstasy in the care of the sick—the daughters of kings had kissed the stinking wounds of lepers, with the express purpose of becoming infected, had called the ulcerated sores to which they exposed themselves “roses,” had drunk the water with which they had bathed those festering bodies, and had declared they had never drunk anything so tasty."
"Sie lachten, froh, daß er scherzte und Poetisches redete. Aber Settembrini setzte hinzu:","They laughed, glad that he was joking and talking poetry. But Settembrini added:","They laughed, glad that he should be pleased to jest and talk poetry. But","They laughed, happy to hear him joking and speaking poetically. But then Settembrini added, “Over a glass of wine, on the evening of Mardi Gras, my good engineer, you will recall that you more or less took your leave of me"

"Da es denn aber unmöglich war, so würde er also allein und {634}ohne Joachim hier oben weiter leben? Ja. Wie lange? Bis Behrens ihn als geheilt entließ, und zwar im Ernst, nicht so wie heute. Aber erstens war das ein Zeitpunkt, zu dessen Bestimmung man nur, wie Joachim einst bei irgendeiner Gelegenheit, in die Luft hinein die Gebärde des Unabsehbaren machen konnte, und zweitens: würde das Unmögliche dann möglicher geworden sein? Im Gegenteil eher. Und soviel war loyalerweise zuzugeben, daß eine Hand ihm geboten war, jetzt, wo das Unmögliche vielleicht noch nicht ganz so unmöglich war, wie es später sein würde, – eine Stütze und Führung für ihn, durch Joachims wilde Abreise, auf dem Wege ins Flachland, den er von sich aus in Ewigkeit nie zurückfinden würde. Wie würde humanistische Pädagogik ihn mahnen, die Hand zu ergreifen und die Führung anzunehmen, wenn die humanistische Pädagogik von der Gelegenheit erfuhr! Aber Herr Settembrini war nur ein Vertreter – von Dingen und Mächten, die hörenswert waren, aber nicht allein, nicht unbedingt; und auch mit Joachim stand es so. Er war Militär, jawohl. Er reiste ab – beinahe in dem Augenblick, wo die hochbrüstige Marusja zurückkehren sollte (am ersten Oktober kehrte sie bekanntlich zurück), während ihm, dem zivilistischen Hans Castorp, die Abreise namentlich und abgekürzt gesprochen darum unmöglich schien, weil er auf Clawdia Chauchat warten mußte, von deren Rückkehr bei weitem noch nichts verlautete. »Das ist nicht meine Auffassung«, hatte Joachim gesagt, als Radamanth ihm von Desertion gesprochen hatte, was zweifellos in Hinsicht auf Joachim nur Kohl und Geschwafel gewesen war von des verdüsterten Hofrats Seite. Aber für ihn, den Zivilisten, lagen die Dinge denn doch wohl anders. Für ihn (ja, ganz ohne Zweifel, so war es! Um diesen entscheidenden Gedanken aus seinem Gefühle emporzuarbeiten, hatte er sich heute hier ins Naßkalte gelegt) – für ihn wäre es wirklich Desertion gewesen, die Gelegenheit zu ergreifen und wilde oder halbwilde Abreise ins Flachland zu {635}halten, Desertion von ausgebreiteten Verantwortlichkeiten, die ihm aus der Anschauung des Hochgebildes, genannt Homo Dei, hier oben erwachsen, Verrat an schweren und erhitzenden, ja seine natürlichen Kräfte übersteigenden, doch abenteuerlich beglückenden Regierungspflichten, denen er hier in der Loge und am blau blühenden Orte oblag.","But since it was impossible, would he continue to live up here alone and without Joachim? Yes. How long? Until Behrens dismissed him as cured, and seriously, not like today. But, firstly, that was a point in time that one could only determine, as Joachim once did on some occasion, by making the gesture of the unforeseeable in the air, and secondly: would the impossible then have become more possible? On the contrary. And that much was to be loyally admitted, that a hand was offered to him now, when the impossible might not yet be quite so impossible as it would later be, - a support and guidance to him, through Joachim's wild departure, on the way to the lowlands who of his own accord he would never find back in eternity. How would humanistic pedagogy admonish him to reach out and take the lead when humanistic pedagogy heard of the opportunity! But Mr. Settembrini was only a representative - of things and powers worth hearing, but not alone, not necessarily; and it was the same with Joachim. He was military, yes. He left - almost at the moment when the high-breasted Marusja was supposed to return (as is well known, she returned on October 1st), while for him, the civilian Hans Castorp, it seemed impossible to leave by name and in short, because he had to wait for Clavdia Chauchat , whose return is far from being reported. ""That's not my opinion,"" Joachim had said when Radamanth had spoken to him about desertion, which, with regard to Joachim, had no doubt been nothing but gibberish on the part of the gloomy Hofrat. But for him, the civilian, things were probably different. For him (yes, without a doubt it was so! He had lain here in the cold and wet here today in order to work this crucial thought out of his feelings) - for him it would really have been desertion to seize the opportunity and wild or semi-wild departure to the {635}to keep the lowlands, desertion from widespread responsibilities that accrue to him from the contemplation of the high entity called Homo Dei, up here, betrayal of heavy and heated government duties, which even exceed his natural strength, but are adventurously gratifying, which he had to fulfill here in the Loge and at the blue blooming places.","And since it was impossible, he would live on up here, alone, without Joachim? Yes, it came to that. How long? Until Behrens discharged him cured—in earnest, that is, not as he had to-day. But that was so indefinite a time-limit that he could no more prophesy it than could Joachim, on a like occasion long ago. Again, would the impossible by then have become any more possible? On the contrary, Joachim’s rash departure did—in honesty—offer his cousin a support, now, before the impossible should become utterly so, a guide and companion on a path which of himself he would never, never find again. Ah, if one consulted humanistic pedagogy, how humanistic pedagogy would adjure him to take the hand and accept the offered guidance! But Herr Settembrini was only a representative—of things and forces worth hearing about, it was true, but not the only forces there were. And with Joachim it was the same. He was a soldier. He was leaving—almost at the very time set for the return of the high-breasted one, for it was known that she would return in October. While the departure of the civilian Hans Castorp became impossible precisely because he had to wait for Clavdia Chauchat, whose return, as yet, was not even thought of. “I don’t look at it in that light,” Joachim had answered when Rhadamanthus talked about desertion—though as far as Joachim was concerned that had probably only been some of the Hofrat’s melancholic maundering. But for him, the civilian, the thing was different. For him—ah, here was the right idea, the thought which he had set himself to evolve, as he lay out in the cold and damp—for him the real desertion would lie in his taking advantage of the occasion to dash off unlawfully—or half unlawfully—to the flat-land. It would be the abandonment of certain comprehensive responsibilities which had grown up out of his contemplation of the image called Homo Dei; it would be the betrayal of that appointed task of “stock-taking,” that hard and harassing task, which was really beyond the powers native to him, but yet afforded his spirit such nameless and adventurous joys; that task it was his duty to perform, here in his chair, and up there in his blue-blossoming retreat.","But since it was impossible, that meant he would go on living alone up here without Joachim, didn’t it? Yes. And for how long? Until Behrens discharged him as cured—in earnest, not like today. But first of all, that was a point in time so indefinite that you could only describe it, as Joachim had done on some occasion or other, with a trailing gesture of immeasurability, and second, did that make the impossible any more possible? It was more like the opposite. And to be fair, he had to admit that a hand had now been offered him, now, when the impossible was perhaps not quite so impossible as it would be later —Joachim’s wild departure could be a support, a guiding hand on the road back to the flatlands, which he would never, ever find all on his own. And what if humanistic pedagogy were to learn of this opportunity? Oh, how it would exhort him to grab that hand and accept its guidance. But Herr Settembrini was only a representative—of things and forces worth hearing about, but not without qualification, as if nothing else existed. The same applied to Joachim. He was a soldier, yes indeed. He would be departing at almost the same moment when Marusya of the prominent breasts was supposed to return (it was common knowledge that she would be back on October first); whereas for him, Hans Castorp the civilian, a departure seemed impossible, because—to put it openly and succinctly—he had to wait for Clavdia Chauchat, about whose return he had heard nothing at all. “That is not how I see it,” Joachim had said when Rhadamanthus mentioned desertion, and Joachim had doubtless interpreted it as more of the gloomy director’s hot air. But things were surely different for him as a civilian. For him—yes, no doubt about it! He had lain down here in the cold and damp today for the sole purpose of wresting this crucial insight from his mixed emotions—for him to grab this chance of a fraudulent or semifraudulent departure to the flatlands would constitute real desertion of duty, desertion from the vast responsibilities that had grown up out of his vision of the sublime image, the homo Dei, a betrayal of the hard, exciting duties of “playing king,” which though they might overtax his natural energies nevertheless made him wildly happy whenever he fulfilled them on his balcony or in the blue-blossoming meadow."
"»Nein,« sagte Joachim, »das hat er wohl nicht. Oder doch nur gerade so viel, um den Aufenthalt hier bestreiten zu können. Sein Vater war auch schon Literat, weißt du, und ich glaube, der Großvater auch.«","'No,' said Joachim, 'I suppose he didn't. Or just enough to cover your stay here. His father was a man of letters too, you know, and I think his grandfather was too.”","“No, I suppose not,” Joachim answered, “or only so much as just makes his stay possible. His father was a literary man too, you know, and, I believe, his grandfather as well.”","“No,” Joachim said, “probably not. Or just enough so that he can pay for his stay here. His father was a literary type himself, you know, and I believe the grandfather was, too.”"
"»Da sind Sie, Leutnant! Sie werden Ihren Vetter gesucht haben, – verzeihen Sie! Wir waren da in ein Gespräch geraten, – wenn mir recht ist, hatten wir sogar einen kleinen Zwist. Er ist kein übler Räsonneur, Ihr Vetter, ein durchaus nicht ungefährlicher Gegner im Wortstreit, wenn es ihm darauf ankommt.«","""There you are, Lieutenant! You must have been looking for your cousin - forgive me! We got into a conversation - if I'm right, we even had a little quarrel. He is not a bad reasoner, your cousin, a not without danger in arguments when it comes to him.”","“There you are, Lieutenant! Have you been looking for your cousin? I must apologize; we had fallen into conversation—if I am not mistaken, we have even had a slight disagreement. He is not a bad reasoner, your cousin, a by no means contemptible antagonist in an argument—when he takes the notion.”","“There you are, lieutenant. You’ve probably been looking for your cousin—forgive me. We were deep in conversation—if I’m not mistaken, in something of a little dispute. He is not a bad quibbler himself, your cousin, certainly no harmless foe in a battle of words—when he wants to be.”"
"Er war am Morgen zeitig wieder im Salon, schon vor dem Frühstück, und ließ, mit gefalteten Händen in einem Sessel sitzend, einen herrlichen Bariton aus dem Schreine zur Harfe singen: »Blick’ ich umher in diesem edlen Kreise –«. Die Harfe klang vollkommen natürlich, es war unverfälschtes und unvermindertes Harfenspiel, was der Schrein außer der schwellenden, hauchenden, artikulierenden menschlichen Stimme aus sich entließ – durchaus zum Erstaunen. Und Zärtlicheres gab es auf Erden nicht, als den Zwiegesang aus einer modernen italienischen Oper, den Hans Castorp darauf folgen ließ, – als diese bescheidene und innige Gefühlsannäherung zwischen der weltberühmten Tenorstimme, die so vielfach in den Alben vertreten war, und einem glashell-süßen kleinen Sopran, – als sein »Da mi il braccio, mia piccina« und die simple, süße, gedrängt melodische kleine Phrase, die sie ihm zur Antwort gab …","He was back in the drawing room early in the morning, before breakfast, and, sitting in an armchair with folded hands, let a wonderful baritone sing from the shrine to the harp: ""When I look around at this noble circle -"". The harp sounded perfectly natural, it was harp playing unadulterated and undiminished that the shrine emanated apart from the swelling, breathing, articulating human voice - quite to the astonishment. And there was nothing more tender on earth than the duo from a modern Italian opera that Hans Castorp followed - than this modest and intimate emotional rapprochement between the world-famous tenor voice, which was represented so often in the albums, and a crystal-clear sweet one small soprano – than his “Da mi il braccio, mia piccina” and the simple, sweet, tightly melodic little phrase she gave him in reply…","Next morning he was early in the salon, even before breakfast; and comfortably sitting with folded hands, listened to a glorious baritone voice, singing to a harp accompaniment: “Blick’ ich umher in diesem edlen Kreise.” The harp sounded perfectly natural, there was no distortion or diminution of the sound that poured out of the casket accompanying the swelling, breathing, articulating human voice—it was simply amazing! And there could be on earth nothing more tender than the next number he chose: a duet from a modern Italian opera, a simple, heartfelt mingling of emotion between two beings, one part taken by the world-famous tenor who was so well represented in the albums, the other by a crystal-clear and sweet little soprano voice; nothing more lovely than his “Da mi il braccio, mia piccina” and the simple, sweet, succinct little melodic phrase in which she replies.","He was back again in the salon early the next morning, before breakfast even; sitting down in an armchair and folding his hands in his lap, he let a splendid baritone sing to him from the cabinet: “Blick’ ich umher in diesem edlen Kreise.” And along with the swelling, breathing, articulating male voice, there came the natural sound of a harp accompaniment, absolutely authentic, not diminished in the least—perfectly amazing. And then Hans Castorp followed this with a duet from a modern Italian opera; and there could be nothing on earth more tender than the demure, intense mingling of emotions between a world-famous tenor, who was well represented in the albums, and a little soprano with a voice sweet and clear as glass—than his “Da’ mi il braccio, mia piccina,” and her answering melodic phrase, so simple, sweet, and succinct."
"Es kam vor, daß Herr Settembrini den Schüler direkt zur Rede stellte und so seine pädagogische Unruhe bekundete.","It happened that Mr. Settembrini confronted the student directly, thus showing his pedagogical unrest.","Settembrini however attacked Hans Castorp directly, and confessed to pedagogic concern.","There came a day when Herr Settembrini directly confronted his pupil, and so betrayed his own pedagogic uneasiness."

After a while Settembrini stopped, took Hans Castorp's hand, put his other hand on it and said:","The others were silent. Ferge’s good-natured moustache wagged up and down.

"»Schweigen Sie, Ingenieur!« befahl er mit einer Strenge, die auf Rechnung seiner Nervosität und Anspannung zu setzen war. »Unterrichten Sie sich, aber produzieren Sie nicht! – Das ist eine Antwort«, sagte er, wieder zu Naphta gewandt. »Sie tröstet mich wenig, aber es ist eine. Blicken wir allen Konsequenzen ins Auge … Mit der Industrie verneint der christliche Kommunismus die Technik, die Maschine, den Fortschritt. Mit dem, was Sie Händlertum nennen, dem Gelde und Geldgeschäft, das der Antike weit höher als Landwirtschaft und Handwerk galt, verneint er die Freiheit. Denn es ist ja klar, es beißt in die Augen, daß dadurch, wie im Mittelalter, alle privaten und öffentlichen Verhältnisse an den Grund und Boden gebunden werden, auch die – es fällt mir nicht eben ganz leicht, es auszusprechen – auch die Persönlichkeit. Kann nur der Boden ernähren, so ist er es allein, der Freiheit verleiht. Handwerker und Bauern, als so ehrenwert sie immer gelten mögen, – besitzen sie keinen Boden, so sind sie Hörige dessen, der welchen besitzt. Tatsächlich bestand bis tief ins Mittelalter hinein die große Menge selbst der Städte aus Hörigen. Sie haben im Gange des Gesprächs dies und das von menschlicher Würde verlauten lassen. Unterdessen verfechten Sie eine Wirtschaftsmoral, an der die Unfreiheit und Würdelosigkeit der menschlichen Persönlichkeit hängt.«","""Shut up, engineer!"" he ordered with a sternness that was due to his nervousness and tension. »Educate yourself, but don't produce! ""That's an answer,"" he said, turning back to Naphta. 'It is of little comfort to me, but it is one. Let's face all the consequences... With industry, Christian Communism denies technology, machines, progress. With what you call merchants, the money and money business, which in antiquity was far more important than agriculture and handicrafts, he denies freedom. Because it is clear, it bites your eyes, that as in the Middle Ages, all private and public relationships are tied to the land and soil, including - it's not exactly easy for me to say it - the personality as well. If only the soil can nourish, then it alone gives freedom. Artisans and peasants, no matter how honorable they may be, if they own no land, they are slaves of the one who owns it. In fact, well into the Middle Ages, the great majority of even the cities consisted of serfs. In the course of the conversation you have said this and that about human dignity. In the meantime, you advocate an economic morality to which the bondage and indignity of the human personality hang.”","“Be quiet, Engineer,” he said, with a severity probably due to nervous irritation. “Inform yourself, but don’t try to express your views. That is an answer, at least,” he said, turning to Naphta again. “It gives me cold comfort, but it is an answer. Let us examine all the consequences flowing from it. Along with industry, your Christian communism would reject machinery, technique, material progress. Along with what you call trade—money and finance, which in antiquity ranked higher than agriculture and manual labour—you reject freedom. For it is clear, so clear as to be evident to the meanest intelligence, that all social relations, public and private, would be attached to the soil, as in the Middle Ages; even—I feel some reluctance to say it—even the person of the individual. If only the soil can maintain life, then only the possession of it can confer freedom. Manual labourers and peasants, however honourable their position, if they possess no real property, can only be the property of those who do. As a matter of fact, until well on in the Middle Ages the great mass of the population, even the town-dwellers, were serfs. In the course of our discussion you have let fall various allusions to the dignity of the human being. Yet you are defending the morality of an economic system which deprives the individual of liberty and self-respect.”","“Silence, my good engineer!” he commanded with a severity attributable to his own nervous tension. “You may learn, but please do not perform.” And now turning back to Naphta he said, “That is one possible answer, but only one. It comforts me a little. But let us confront it in all its consequences. Along with industry, your Christian communism rejects technology, the machine, progress itself. In denying what you call marketeering, the world of money and finance, which antiquity valued much more than farming and handicrafts, it also denies freedom. For it is as clear as clear can be that, just as in the Middle Ages, all private and public relationships will be bound to the soil, even—and I do not find it easy to say this—even the individual personality. If only the soil can provide a living, then it alone can provide freedom. Craftsmen and peasants, no matter in what honor they may be held, own no land, they are vassals of those who do own it. Indeed, until well into the late Middle Ages, the majority of people, even those in the cities, were vassals. Here and there in the course of our discussion, you have made mention of human dignity. But now you are advocating an economic system whose morality deprives the individual of freedom and dignity.”"
"»Ich bin über anderthalb Jahre hier, Herr Hofrat. Ich kann nicht länger warten. Herr Hofrat haben ursprünglich gesagt: ein Vierteljahr. Dann ist meine Kur immer wieder viertel- und halbjahrsweise verlängert worden, und ich bin immer noch nicht gesund.«","“I've been here for over a year and a half, Herr Hofrat. I cant wait any longer. Herr Hofrat originally said: a quarter. Then my cure was extended again and again quarterly and half-yearly, and I'm still not healthy.""","He took in his stomach, and replied, repressed and curt: “I have been here a year and a half, Herr Hofrat. I cannot wait any longer. Originally it was to have been three months. Since then it has been increased, first another three, then another six, and so on, and still I am not cured.”","He tucked in his stomach and in a choked, bluff voice he said, “I have been here for a year and a half, Director Behrens. I can wait no longer. You originally told me three months, sir. My cure has been regularly extended, until another year and a quarter have now passed, and I am still not well.”"
"»M. w.!« sagte Behrens. »M. w. m. F.! Machen wir mit Vergnügen! Hätten wir längst mal machen sollen. Wenn man schon hier ist, soll man das immer mitnehmen. Aber man mag sich ja natürlich nicht aufdrängen. Also morgen um zwei, gleich wenn Sie von der Krippe kommen!«","»M w.!” said Behrens. »M w.m.f.! Let's do it with pleasure!

So tomorrow at two, just as soon as you come from the crèche!'","“A. Y. S.,” said Behrens. “At your service. With all the pleasure in life. Ought to have done it long ago. Once you are up here, why not? But one doesn’t like to seem forth-putting. Very good then, to-morrow at two—directly after grub.”","Behrens said. “No sooner said than done. With pleasure. Should have done it long ago. Once you’re up here, you might as well take advantage of the place. But, of course, we didn’t want to seem pushy about it. So there’ll be two of you tomorrow, right after you’ve put on the feed bag.”"
"So stellte der Alte, zu seinen Lebzeiten und nachher, sich dem bürgerlichen Auge dar, und wenn der kleine Hans Castorp auch nichts von Staatsangelegenheiten verstand, so machte sein still anschauendes Kinderauge im wesentlichen doch ganz dieselben Wahrnehmungen, – wortlose und also unkritische, vielmehr nur lebensvolle Wahrnehmungen, die übrigens auch später, als bewußtes Erinnerungsbild, ihr wort- und zergliederungsfeindliches, schlechthin bejahendes Gepräge durchaus bewahrten. Wie gesagt, war da Sympathie im Spiele, jene ein Glied überspringende Nächstverbundenheit und Wesensverwandtschaft, die nichts Seltenes ist. Kinder und Enkel schauen an, um zu bewundern, und sie bewundern, um zu lernen und auszubilden, was erblicherweise in ihnen vorgebildet liegt.","This is how the old man, during his lifetime and afterwards, presented himself to the bourgeois eye, and even if little Hans Castorp did not understand anything about state affairs, his quietly looking child's eyes made essentially the same perceptions - wordless and therefore uncritical, rather only lively perceptions, which incidentally also later, as a conscious memory image, retained their anti-verbal and anti-analysis, absolutely affirmative character. As I said, there was sympathy involved, that closeness and affinity that goes beyond a link, which is not uncommon. Children and grandchildren look to admire, and they admire to learn and educate what is inherited in them.","Such, in his lifetime and afterwards, was the figure the old man presented to the eye of his fellow burghers; and such, in essentials, was he also to the childish gaze of little Hans Castorp, who knew naught of affairs of state, and whose formless, uncritical judgments were rather the fruit of mere lively perceptions. Yet they persisted into later life, as the elements of a perfectly conscious memory-picture, which defied expression or analysis, but was none the less positive for all that. We repeat that natural sympathy was in play here too, the close family tie and essential intimacy which not infrequently leaps over an intervening generation.","And this was how the old man was viewed, both during his lifetime and after, by his fellow citizens; and even though little Hans Castorp understood nothing about the affairs of government, the perceptions gained by his own calm, alert child’s eye were much the same—unspoken and therefore uncritical perceptions, though enthusiastic for all that, which when they later became conscious memories retained their exclusively positive stamp, immune to all discussion or analysis. As noted, mutual sympathy was at work here, the kind of family affection and affinity of personality that not infrequently leaps a generation. Children and grandchildren observe in order to admire, and they admire in order to learn and develop what heredity has stored within them."
"Herr Settembrini preßte die Lippen zusammen, und so beeilte sich Hans Castorp hinzuzufügen, daß er selbst sich natürlich jeder Partei- und Stellungnahme enthalte, nur eben hörenswert habe er es gefunden, was Naphta über die Lust der Jugend gesagt habe. »Erklären Sie mir aber nun erst einmal eines!« fuhr er fort. »Da hat nun dieser Herr Naphta – ich sage ›dieser Herr‹, um anzudeuten, daß ich durchaus nicht unbedingt mit ihm sympathisiere, sondern mich im Gegenteil innerlich höchst reserviert verhalte –«","Herr Settembrini pressed his lips together, and so Hans Castorp hastened to add that he himself naturally refrained from any partisanship or opinion, he had just found what Naphta had said about the joys of youth worth hearing. ""But first, explain one thing to me!"" he continued. ""Now this gentleman Naphta - I say 'this gentleman' to indicate that I do not necessarily sympathize with him at all, but on the contrary inwardly am extremely reserved -""","Settembrini compressed his lips, and Hans Castorp hastened to say that, as for his own attitude, it was of course entirely non-partisan; he only meant that he had enjoyed hearing what Naphta had to say about the deepest desire of youth. “But do explain this one thing to me,” he went on. “This person—I call him that by way of showing my detachment, and that I don’t by any means altogether agree with all he says, but am inclined to make important reservations—”","Herr Settembrini pressed his lips together, and so Hans Castorp hurried to add that he himself, of course, would refrain from taking sides or endorsing any viewpoint, but he had found it worth listening to what Naphta said about the desires of youth. “But you must explain one thing for me,” he went on. “Well, your Herr Naphta— I call him ‘your Herr Naphta’ to indicate that I do not necessarily find myself in sympathy with him, but that on the contrary, my attitude is one of considerable reservation—”"

"Wirklich tauchten neue Verkleidungen auf: Damen in Herrentracht, operettenhaft und unwahrscheinlich durch ausladende Formen, die Gesichter bärtig geschwärzt mit angekohltem Flaschenkork; Herren, umgekehrt, die Frauenroben angelegt hatten, über deren Röcke sie strauchelten, wie zum Beispiel Studiosus Rasmussen, welcher, in schwarzer, jettübersäter Toilette, ein pickliges Dekolleté zur Schau stellte, das er sich mit einem Papierfächer kühlte, und zwar auch den Rücken. Ein Bettelmann erschien knickbeinig, an einer Krücke hängend. Jemand hatte sich aus weißem Unterzeug und einem Damenfilz ein Pierrotkostüm hergestellt, das Gesicht gepudert, so daß seine Augen ein unnatürliches Aussehen gewannen, und den Mund mit Lippenpomade blutig aufgehöht. Es war der Junge mit dem Fingernagel. Ein Grieche vom Schlechten Russentisch, mit schönen Beinen, stolzierte in lila Trikotunterhosen, mit Mäntelchen, Papierkrause und einem Stockdegen als spanischer Grande oder Märchenprinz daher. Alle diese Masken waren nach Schluß der Mahlzeit eilig improvisiert worden. Es litt {495}Frau Stöhr nicht länger auf ihrem Stuhl. Sie verschwand, um nach kurzer Zeit als Scheuerweib wiederzukehren, mit geschürztem Rock und aufgestülpten Ärmeln, die Bänder ihrer Papierhaube unter dem Kinn geknotet und bewaffnet mit Eimer und Besen, die sie zu handhaben begann, indem sie mit dem nassen Schrubber unter die Tische, den Sitzenden zwischen die Füße fuhr.","New disguises did appear: ladies in men's costumes, operetta-like and improbable because of their expansive forms, their faces blackened with bearded corks and charred corks; Gentlemen, conversely, who had donned women's robes over whose skirts they stumbled, such as Studiosus Rasmussen, who, in a black, jet-strewn outfit, displayed a pimply décolleté which he cooled with a paper fan, including his back. A beggar man appeared, crooked, hanging on a crutch. Someone had made a Pierrot costume out of white underwear and a lady's felt, powdered his face so that his eyes looked unnatural, and raised his mouth with lip pomade until it bled. It was the boy with the fingernail. A Greek from the bad Russian table, with beautiful legs, strutted along in lilac jersey underpants, with a little coat, paper frill and a sword stick as a Spanish grandee or fairytale prince. All these masks had been hastily improvised after the meal was over. {495}Frau Stöhr no longer suffered in her chair. She disappeared, only to return after a short while as a scrubber, with her skirt pulled up and her sleeves rolled up, the ribbons of her paper cap knotted under her chin, and armed with a bucket and broom, which she began to use, putting the wet mop under the tables, the seated between the feet.","Even as he spoke, new maskers entered: women dressed as men, with beards and moustaches of burnt cork, betraying themselves by their figures and looking like characters in comic opera ; men in women’s clothes, tripping over their skirts. Here was the student Rasmussen in a black jet-trimmed toilet, displaying a pimpled décolleté and fanning himself front and back with a paper fan; there was a Pierrot, costumed in white underwear, with a lady’s felt hat, a powdered face that gave his eyes an unnatural expression, and lips garish with blood-red pomade—the youth with the fingernail. A Greek from the “bad” Russian table, who rejoiced in beautiful legs, strutted in tights, with short cloak, paper ruff, and dagger, personating a fairy prince, or a Spanish grandee. All these costumes had been improvised since the end of the meal. Frau Stöhr could sit still no longer. She too disappeared, and presently returned dressed as a charwoman, with skirt looped up and sleeves rolled back; a paper cap tied under her chin, armed with pail and brush; she began scrubbing about under the tables, among the feet of those still sitting.","And indeed new costumes arrived now: ladies in men’s clothes, their ample curves making them look as implausible as characters in an operetta, an effect accentuated by black beards drawn on their faces with burnt cork; and vice versa, gentlemen attired in women’s clothes, tripping over their skirts—including Rasmussen the student, who wore a black, jet-trimmed gown, its décolletage revealing a pimply chest and ditto back, both of which he tried to cool with a paper fan. A knock-kneed beggar appeared, leaning on a crutch. Someone had put together a Punchinello costume out of white underwear and a lady’s felt hat—the face powdered so white that the eyes looked quite unnatural , the lips emphasized in bloody-red lipstick. (It was the young fellow with the saltcellar fingernail.) A Greek from the Bad Russian table strutted about as a Spanish grandee or fairy-tale prince with a cape, paper ruff, and sword—and a pair of purple tights to show off his handsome legs. All these costumes had been hastily improvised after the meal. Frau Stöhr could no longer bear it just to sit there. She vanished, and a short time later reappeared as a cleaning lady, with apron and rolled-up sleeves, the ribbons of her paper hat tied under her chin; she was armed with bucket and broom, which she now put to use, thrusting the wet broom under the table and swabbing between people’s feet."

"Diese Behauptung, bemerkte Settembrini bissig, sei wohl nicht ohne Seitenblick auf die »kanonische Portion« aufrecht erhalten worden, die bei jedem Testament habe abfallen müssen. Im übrigen sprach er von »Pfaffendemagogie«, nannte es die Leutseligkeit unbedingter Machtbegier, die Unterwelt in Bewegung zu setzen, wenn die Götter begreiflicherweise nichts von einem wissen wollten, und meinte, es sei der Kirche offenbar auf die Quantität der Seelen mehr angekommen, als auf ihre Qualität, was auf tiefe geistige Unvornehmheit schließen lasse.","This assertion, Settembrini remarked bitingly, was probably not maintained without a sideways glance at the ""canonical portion"" that had to be omitted with every will. He also spoke of ""cleric demagogy,"" calling it the affability of an unconditional thirst for power to set the underworld in motion when the gods, understandably, wanted nothing to do with you, and thought that the number of souls was obviously more important to the Church than it was on their quality, which suggests a deep intellectual impudence.","Settembrini bitingly remarked that he might mention, as not entirely irrelevant in this connexion, the so-called “canonical portion,” which subtracted a substantial sum from every testamentary bequest. And he spoke of priestly demagoguery, which began to vent its thirst for power in exaggerated solicitude for the under dog, when the top dog would none of it. The Church, he asserted, cared more about the quantity of souls she got hold of than their quality—which certainly reflected upon her pretensions to spiritual refinement.","Such rights, Settembrini remarked cuttingly, were probably not maintained without a sidelong glance at the “canonical share,” which had to be subtracted from every will. And then he went on to speak of “clerical demagoguery,” of the absolute lust for power that condescended to rouse the denizens of the underworld when the gods quite understandably did not wish to hear from them, and suggested that the Church was apparently more concerned with the quantity than the quality of souls saved, which indicated a profound lack of spiritual nobility."
"Hofrat Behrens war keineswegs Inhaber und Besitzer der Anstalt, – obgleich man wohl diesen Eindruck gewinnen konnte. Über und hinter ihm standen unsichtbare Mächte, die sich eben nur in Gestalt des Bureaus bis zu einem gewissen Grade manifestierten: ein Aufsichtsrat, eine Aktiengesellschaft, der anzugehören nicht übel sein mochte, da sie nach Joachims glaubwürdiger Versicherung trotz hoher Ärztegehälter und liberalster Wirtschaftsprinzipien alljährlich eine saftige Dividende unter ihre Mitglieder verteilen konnte. Der Hofrat also war kein selbständiger Mann, er war nichts als ein Agent, ein Funktionär, ein Verwandter höherer Gewalten, der erste und oberste freilich, die Seele des Ganzen, von bestimmendem Einfluß auf die gesamte Organisation, die Intendantur nicht ausgeschlossen, obgleich er als dirigierender Arzt über jede Beschäftigung mit dem kaufmännischen Teil des Betriebes natürlich erhaben war. Aus dem Nordwesten Deutschlands gebürtig, war er, wie man wußte, wider Absicht und Lebensplan vor Jahren in diese Stellung gelangt: heraufgeführt durch seine Frau, deren Reste schon längst der Friedhof von »Dorf« umfing, {202}– der malerische Friedhof von Dorf Davos dort oben am rechtsseitigen Hange, weiter zurück gegen den Eingang des Tales. Sie war eine sehr liebliche, wenn auch überäugige und asthenische Erscheinung gewesen, den Photographien nach zu urteilen, die überall in des Hofrats Dienstwohnung standen, sowie auch den Ölbildnissen zufolge, die, von seiner eigenen Liebhaberhand stammend, dort an den Wänden hingen. Nachdem sie ihm zwei Kinder geschenkt, einen Sohn und eine Tochter, war ihr leichter, von Hitze ergriffener Körper in diese Gegenden heraufgezogen worden, und in wenigen Monaten hatte seine Aus- und Aufzehrung sich vollendet. Man sagte, Behrens, der sie vergöttert habe, sei durch den Schlag so schwer getroffen worden, daß er vorübergehend in Tiefsinn und Wunderlichkeit verfallen sei und sich auf der Straße durch Kichern, Gestenspiel und Selbstgespräch auffällig gemacht habe. Er war dann nicht mehr in seinen ursprünglichen Lebenskreis zurückgekehrt, sondern an Ort und Stelle geblieben: gewiß auch darum, weil er sich von dem Grabe nicht trennen mochte; den Ausschlag aber hatte wohl der weniger sentimentale Grund gegeben, daß er selbst etwas abbekommen hatte und seiner eigenen wissenschaftlichen Einsicht nach einfach hierher gehörte. So hatte er sich eingebürgert als einer der Ärzte, die Leidensgenossen derjenigen sind, deren Aufenthalt sie überwachen; die nicht, von der Krankheit unabhängig, sie aus dem freien Stande persönlicher Intaktheit bekämpfen, sondern selber ihr Zeichen tragen, – ein eigentümlicher, aber durchaus nicht vereinzelter Fall, der ohne Zweifel seine Vorzüge wie sein Bedenkliches hat. Kameradschaft des Arztes mit dem Patienten ist gewiß zu begrüßen, und es läßt sich hören, daß nur der Leidende des Leidenden Führer und Heiland zu sein vermag. Aber ist rechte geistige Herrschaft über eine Macht denn möglich bei dem, der selber zu ihren Sklaven zählt? Kann befreien, wer selbst unterworfen ist? Der kranke Arzt bleibt ein Paradoxon für das ein{203}fache Gefühl, eine problematische Erscheinung. Wird nicht vielleicht sein geistiges Wissen um die Krankheit durch das erfahrungsmäßige nicht so sehr bereichert und sittlich gestärkt als getrübt und verwirrt? Er blickt der Krankheit nicht in klarer Gegnerschaft ins Auge, er ist befangen, ist nicht eindeutig als Partei; und mit aller gebotenen Vorsicht muß man fragen, ob ein der Krankheitswelt Zugehöriger an der Heilung oder auch nur Bewahrung anderer eigentlich in dem Sinne interessiert sein kann, wie ein Mann der Gesundheit …","Hofrat Behrens was by no means the proprietor and proprietor of the institution - although one could get that impression. Above and behind him stood invisible powers that only manifested themselves to a certain extent in the form of the office: a supervisory board, a stock company, which it might not be a bad idea to belong to, since according to Joachim's credible assurance, despite high doctors' salaries and the most liberal economic principles, they have one every year distribute hefty dividends among its members. The Hofrat was therefore not an independent man, he was nothing but an agent, a functionary, a relative of higher powers, the first and supreme of course, the soul of the whole, with a determining influence on the entire organization, the directorate not excluded, although he as the doctor in charge was of course above any occupation with the commercial part of the company. Born in north-west Germany, he was known to have gotten into this position years ago, contrary to his intention and life plan: brought up by his wife, whose remains have long since been included in the »Dorf« cemetery, {202}—the picturesque village cemetery Davos up there on the right-hand slope, further back towards the entrance of the valley. She had been a very lovely, if over-eyed and asthenic, appearance, judging from the photographs which were scattered throughout the Hofrat's official quarters, and also from the oil portraits which, by his own amateur hand, hung on the walls there. Having given him two children, a son and a daughter, her light, heat-stricken body had been drawn up to these parts, and in a few months its consumption and consumption was complete. It was said that Behrens, who adored her, was so badly hit by the blow that he temporarily lapsed into profundity and whimsy, making himself conspicuous in the street by giggling, making gestures, and talking to himself. He then did not return to his original sphere of life, but remained where he was: certainly also because he did not want to part with the grave; the deciding factor, however, was probably the less sentimental reason that he himself had suffered and, according to his own scientific insight, simply belonged here. So he had established himself as one of those doctors who are fellow sufferers of those whose stay they are supervising; who do not, independently of the illness, fight it from the free state of personal integrity, but themselves bear its mark - a peculiar, but by no means isolated case, which undoubtedly has its advantages as well as its doubts. Camaraderie between doctor and patient is certainly to be welcomed, and it can be heard that only the sufferer can be the guide and savior of the sufferer. But is right spiritual domination over a power possible with one who counts himself among its slaves? Can liberate who is himself subdued? The sick doctor remains a paradox for the simple feeling, a problematic phenomenon. Isn't his spiritual knowledge of the illness perhaps not so much enriched and morally strengthened by his experience as clouded and confused? He does not face the disease with clear opposition, he is biased, he is not unequivocal as a party; and with all due caution one must ask whether a member of the sick world can actually be interested in the healing or even preservation of others in the same sense as a man of health...","Hofrat Behrens was not—though he gave the impression of being—owner and proprietor of the establishment. Above and behind him stood invisible powers, which to a certain extent manifested their existence in the office they had just visited. They consisted of a supervisory head and a stock company—in which it was not a bad thing to hold shares, according to Joachim, since the members of it divided a fat dividend each year. The Hofrat was a dependent, he was merely an agent, a functionary, an associate of higher powers; the first and highest, of course, and the soul of the enterprise, with a well-defined influence upon it and upon the management itself— though of course as directing physician he was relieved of all preoccupation with the business side. He was a native of north-western Germany, and it was common knowledge that when he took the position, years ago, he had done so contrary to his previous intention and plans. He had come here on account of his wife—whose remains had long reposed in the village churchyard, that picturesque churchyard of Dorf Davos, which lay high up on the right-hand slope, nearer the entrance of the valley. She had been a charming person, to judge from her likenesses, though too large-eyed and asthenic-looking. Photographs of her stood about everywhere in the Hofrat’s house; even oil portraits by his own amateur hand hung on the walls. Two children, a son and a daughter, had been born; then they had brought her up here, the fragile body already fever-smitten; a few months had seen the completion of the wasting-away process. Behrens, they said, had adored her. He was brought so low by the blow that he got very odd and melancholy; people saw him gesturing, sniggering, and talking to himself, on the street. He did not go back to his original place, but remained where he was—in part, no doubt, because he could not tear himself away from her grave, but also for the less sentimental reason that he was himself in poor health and, in his own professional opinion, actually belonged here. He had settled down as one of the physicians who are companions in suffering to the patients in their care; who do not stand above disease, fighting her in the armour of personal security, but who themselves bear her mark—an odd, but by no means isolated, case, and one which has its good as well as its bad side. Sympathy between doctor and patient is surely desirable, and a case might be made out for the view that only he who suffers can be the guide and healer of the suffering. And yet—can true spiritual mastery over a power be won by him who is counted among her slaves? Can he free others who himself is not free? The ailing physician remains a paradox to the average mind, a questionable phenomenon. May not his scientific knowledge tend to be clouded and confused by his own participation, rather than enriched and morally reinforced? He cannot face disease in clear-eyed hostility to her; he is a prejudiced party, his position is equivocal. With all due reserve it must be asked whether a man who himself belongs among the ailing can give himself to the cure or care of others as can a man who is himself entirely sound.","Director Behrens was neither the owner nor the proprietor of the sanatorium—although one might get that impression. Above and behind him stood invisible forces, made manifest only to a certain degree in the management office: a board of directors, a joint-stock company—and the stock would not be a bad thing to have, because according to Joachim’s trustworthy assertions, juicy dividends were distributed annually to the shareholders, despite the high salaries paid the doctors and some very liberal business practices. The director, then, was not an independent man, but merely an agent, a functionary, an associate of those higher powers—though, of course, the highest and supreme associate here, the soul of the place, the determining factor for the whole organization, including the management office. As the supervising physician, to be sure, he stood far aloof from anything to do with the commercial side of the operation. He came from somewhere in northwestern Germany; and it was general knowledge that he had fallen into the position years ago quite by accident and without any planning on his part. He had been brought here by his wife, whose remains had long since been given over to the cemetery in Davos-Dorf—the picturesque graveyard above the village, on the right-hand slope, toward the entrance of the valley. She had been a very charming woman, if a little cross-eyed and gaunt, to judge from photos you found scattered about the director’s official residence, not to mention oil portraits of her that were hung on the walls—painted by his own amateur hand. After she had presented him with two children, a son and a daughter, they had brought her up to this valley, her body already frail and feverish, and within a few months that body had wasted away entirely. People said that Behrens, who idolized her, had been so overwhelmed by the blow that he had temporarily fallen into a strange melancholy and had been seen walking the streets giggling, gesticulating, and talking to himself. He had not returned to his former life, then, but had stayed on here—in part, to be sure, because he did not want to leave her grave behind; but the deciding, and less sentimental, factor had probably been that he had become slightly infected himself and, in his own professional opinion, actually belonged here. So he had taken up residence as one of those physicians who not only supervised people’s stay here, but also shared their sufferings, who did not battle disease from a position of personal wholeness and independence, but who bore its marks themselves. It was a curious, but certainly not unique situation, with presumably both its beneficial and dubious sides. A warm relationship between doctor and patient is certainly to be welcomed, and there is something to the proposition that only he who suffers can be the guide and healer of the suffering. But can someone truly be the intellectual master of a power to which he is himself enslaved? Can he liberate if he himself is not free? To the average person, the idea of a sick physician remains a paradox, a problematical phenomenon. Instead of being intellectually enriched and morally strengthened by his experience, may he not perhaps find that his knowledge of the disease becomes clouded and confused? He no longer stares down the illness with a hostile eye; he is a biased and hardly unequivocal foe. With all due respect, one must ask whether someone who is part of the world of illness can indeed be interested in curing or even nursing others in the same way a healthy person can."
"Dann wurde sein Wesen ablehnend, streng-unverbindlich, ja unhöflich; er ließ sich keine Fiktionen und Beschönigungen mehr nahe kommen, antwortete nicht darauf, blickte fremd vor sich hin. Namentlich nachdem der junge Pfarrer, den Luise Ziemßen berufen, und der zu Hans Castorps Bedauern keine gestärkte Krause, sondern nur Bäffchen getragen hatte, mit ihm gebetet, nahm seine Haltung amtlich-dienstliches Gepräge an, äußerte er Wünsche nur in Form kurzer Befehlsworte.","Then his manner became dismissive, strictly noncommittal, even impolite; he no longer allowed himself to be approached by fictions and euphemisms, did not answer them, looked straight ahead in an alien manner. Especially after the young pastor whom Luise Ziemssen had appointed, and who, to Hans Castorp's regret, had not worn a starched ruff but only a little bandage, had prayed with him, his attitude took on an official character, and he only expressed wishes in the form of brief commands.","After that he became austere, forbidding, even gruff; would not listen to any soothing fictions or pretence, but stared before him and made no reply. Louisa Ziemssen had sent for a young clergyman, who, to Hans Castorp’s regret, did not appear in a starched ruff, but wore bands instead. After he had prayed with Joachim, the patient assumed an official tone and air, and uttered his wishes in the form of short commands.","Then his mood turned intransigent, sternly diffident, even boorish; he would not listen to any more fibs or pretty stories, refused to answer them, and stared strangely straight ahead. Especially after the young pastor—whom Luise Ziemssen had summoned and who, to Hans Castorp’s regret, had not worn a starched ruff but only Geneva bands—arrived to pray with him, his attitude grew more officially military and his wishes were only blunt commands."
"Das war erschütternd in jedem Sinn; Hans Castorp war begeistert von der Begegnung, und zugleich spürte er etwas wie aufsteigende Angst, eine Beklemmung derselben Art, wie das Eingesperrtsein mit dem günstigen Ungefähr auf engem Raum ihm verursachte: auch dies, daß der längst vergessene Pribislav ihm hier oben als Frau Chauchat wieder begegnete und ihn mit Kirgisenaugen ansah, war wie ein Eingesperrtsein mit Unumgänglichem oder Unentrinnbarem, – in beglückendem und ängstlichem Sinn Unentrinnbarem. Es war hoffnungsreich und zugleich auch unheimlich, ja bedrohlich, und ein Gefühl der Hilfsbedürftigkeit kam den jungen Hans Castorp an, – in seinem Inneren vollzogen sich unbestimmte und instinktmäßige Bewegungen, die man als ein Sichumsehen, als ein Tasten und Suchen nach Hilfe, nach Rat und Stütze hätte ansprechen mögen; er dachte nacheinander an verschiedene Personen, an die zu denken etwa zuträglich sein mochte.","That was harrowing in every sense; Hans Castorp was enthusiastic about the encounter, and at the same time he felt something like rising fear, an oppression of the same kind as being locked up in a small space with the favorable vagueness caused him: also this, that the long-forgotten Pribislav was coming back to him up here as Frau Chauchat met him and looked at him with Kyrgyz eyes, was like being imprisoned with the inevitable or the inescapable - the inescapable in a happy and anxious sense. It was hopeful and at the same time uncanny, even threatening, and the young Hans Castorp felt a need for help - vague and instinctive movements took place inside him, which one felt as a looking around, as a groping and searching for help, for advice and support might have appealed; he thought in succession of various people who it might be beneficial to think of.","It had been staggering in the extreme. Hans Castorp thrilled at the encounter, yet experienced a mounting uneasiness like that he felt when he realized how narrow was the proximity that enclosed him and the fair Russian. That the long-forgotten Pribislav Hippe should appear to him in the guise of Frau Chauchat and look at him with those “Kirghiz” eyes—this was to be immured, not with opportunity, but with the inevitable, the unescapable, to such an extent as to fill him with conflicting emotions. It was a situation rich in hope, yet heavy with dread—it gave our young friend a feeling of helplessness, and set in motion a vague instinct to cast about, to grope and feel for help or counsel. One after another he mentally summoned up various people, the thought of whom might serve him as some sort of mental support.","It was thrilling in every sense of the word. Hans Castorp was inspired by this meeting, and at the same time he sensed something like a growing anxiety, much like that suffocating feeling of being locked up in a box together with auspicious chance; what was more, the fact that the long-forgotten Pribislav had reappeared up here as Frau Chauchat and had looked at him with Kirghiz eyes made him feel as if he were locked up together with something inevitable and inescapable—an inescapability that both cheered and alarmed him. It filled him with hope; and at the same time an eerie, even threatening sense of helplessness stole over young Hans Castorp, setting in motion a vague, instinctual groping, a search for help—one might say he was looking about deep inside himself for advice and support. He thought of various people, one after the other, hoping the mere thought of them might prove beneficial somehow."
"»Nein, ich habe ihm hier Adieu gesagt, bevor man ihn einschloß, da er anfing, zu lächeln. Du glaubst nicht, wie kalt seine Stirne war.«","'No, I said goodbye to him here before they locked him up, as he started to smile. You wouldn't believe how cold his forehead was.""","He replied: “No, I bade him adieu up here, before they shut him away, when he had begun to smile in his beard. His brow was cold— tu sais comme les fronts des morts sont froids?”","“No,” he replied, “I said my good-byes to him here before they closed the casket—he was starting to smile. You can’t believe how cold his brow was, Clavdia.”"
»Meine Mutter ist einverstanden. Es ist alles abgemacht. Ich trete ersten Oktober als Fahnenjunker bei den Sechsundsiebzigern ein.«,"'My mother agrees. It's all settled. I'm enlisting as a cadet with the seventy-six first October.""",“My mother—yes. It is all arranged. The first of October I join the seventy-sixth regiment as cornet.”,“My mother approves. It’s all arranged. I will be joining the seventy-sixth as an ensign on the first of October.”
"Auf dieses »Das ist«, »Das ist nun doch« waren überhaupt die leitend-erläuternden Äußerungen gestimmt, mit denen er unter genauen, wenn auch nachgerade etwas burlesk gewordenen Kulturgebärden seine Veranstaltung begleitete. Er hatte eine Art, den Ring, den sein gekrümmter Zeigefinger mit dem Daumen bildete, über das Ohr emporzuhalten und das Haupt schief-scherzhaft davon abzuwenden, die Gefühle erweckte, wie etwa der bejahrte Priester eines fremden Kults sie erregen würde, der mit gerafften Gewändern und wunderlicher Grazie vor dem Opferaltar tanzte. Dann wieder, breit hingelagert in seiner Großartigkeit, den Arm um die benachbarte Stuhllehne geschlungen, zwang er alle zu ihrer Bestürzung, sich mit ihm in die lebendige und durchdringende Vorstellung des Morgens zu vertiefen, eines frostigen, dunklen Wintermorgens, wenn der gelbliche Schein unserer Nachttischlampe sich durch die Fensterscheibe hinausspiegelt zwischen kahles Geäst, das draußen in eisige, krähenschreiharte Nebelfrühe starrt … Andeu{865}tungsweise wußte er diese nüchterne Alltagsanschauung so stark zu machen, daß alle erschauerten, besonders da er auch noch des eiskalten Wassers gedachte, das man sich etwa in solcher Frühe aus einem großen Schwamme über den Nacken drücke, und das er heilig nannte. Das war nur eine Abschweifung, eine beispielhafte Unterweisung in Dingen der Lebensaufmerksamkeit, ein phantastisches Impromptu, das er fallen ließ, um seine dienstliche Eindringlichkeit und Gefühlsgegenwart alsbald der festlich gelösten Nachtstunde wieder zuzuwenden. Er zeigte sich verliebt in all und jede erreichbare Weiblichkeit, wahllos und ohne Ansehen der Person. Er machte der Zwergin Anträge solcher Art, daß das krüppelhafte Wesen sein übergroßes, ältliches Gesicht in grinsende Falten legte, sagte der Stöhr Artigkeiten eines Kalibers, daß die ordinäre Frau ihre Schulter noch ärger vorbog und die Ziererei bis zur völligen Verrücktheit trieb, erbat sich von der Kleefeld einen Kuß auf seinen großen, zerrissenen Mund und scharmierte selbst mit der trostlosen Frau Magnus – dies alles unbeschadet seiner zärtlichen Ergebenheit gegen seine Reisebegleiterin, deren Hand er oft mit galanter Andacht an die Lippen führte. »Der Wein –« sagte er – »Die Frauen – – Das ist – Das ist nun doch – Erlauben Sie mir – Weltuntergang – – Gethsemane – –«","The guiding, explanatory remarks with which he accompanied his event with precise, even if by now somewhat burlesque cultural gestures, were geared towards this ""That is,"" ""That is after all."" He had a way of holding the ring, which his crooked forefinger formed with his thumb, over his ear and turning his head askance jokingly away from it, which aroused feelings as the elderly priest of a foreign cult would arouse them, one with gathered robes and strange grace danced in front of the sacrificial altar. Then again, sprawled in his magnificence, arm wrapped around the back of a neighboring chair, he forced all, to their dismay, to join him in the vivid and penetrating imagining of the morning, a chilly, dark winter morning, when the yellowish glow of our bedside lamp reflected through the window pane between bare branches, which stares outside into the icy, crow-hard early morning fog ... In hints, he knew how to make this sober everyday view so strong that everyone shuddered, especially since he also thought of the ice-cold water that one had about this early in the morning from a large sponge over the neck, and which he called sacred. That was just a digression, exemplary instruction in matters of vital awareness, a fantastic impromptu that he dropped in order to turn his official urgency and emotional presence back to the festively resolved hour of the night. He showed himself in love with all and every femininity attainable, indiscriminately and without regard to person. He made such requests to the dwarf that the crippled creature wrinkled his oversized, elderly face in grinning creases, said Stohr politeness of a caliber that the ordinary woman bent her shoulders even worse and drove the embellishment to the point of complete madness, asked of der Kleefeld kissed his large, torn mouth, and even flirted with the disconsolate Frau Magnus—all without prejudice to his tender devotion to his traveling companion, whose hand he often lifted to his lips with gallant devotion. ""The wine--"" he said--""the women---that's--that's it---permit me--end of the world--Gethsemane--""","This oft-repeated phrase set the key for all the running comment with which he accompanied his production of gesture—gesture that by now, in all conscience, had grown more than a little burlesque. He had a way of lifting that little circlet formed by thumb and forefinger to a poise above his ear, and coyly twisting his head away from it—one watched him as one might an elderly priest of some oriental cult, with the skirts of his robe snatched up, doing a dance before the sacrificial altar. Again, flung back in Olympian repose, with one arm stretched out on the back of his neighbour’s chair, he beguiled them all to their confusion, by painting a vivid and irresistible scene of a dark, frosty winter morning, when the yellow gleam of the night-lamp reveals the network of bare boughs outside the pane, rigid in the harsh and penetrating mist of early dawn. So telling was the picture, so universal its appeal—actually, they all shivered; particularly when he went on to speak of rising in such a dawn, and squeezing a great sponge filled with ice-cold water over neck and shoulders. The effective sensation he characterized as “holy.” But all this was a digression, an aside thrown out to illustrate receptivity for life; a fantastic impromptu, let fall merely to renew and reassert the whole irresistible compulsion of his presence and his sensations upon the scene of abandoned night-revelry. He made love to every female creature within reach, without discrimination or respect of person; tendering such offers to the dwarf that the crippled creature’s large old face was wreathed in smiles. He paid Frau Stöhr compliments that made the vulgar creature bridle more extravagantly than ever, and become almost senseless with affectation. He supplicated—and received—a kiss from Fräulein Kleefeld, upon his thick, chapped lips. He even coquetted with the forlorn Frau Magnus—and all this without detriment to the delicate homage he paid his companion, whose hand he would every now and then carry gallantly to his lips. “Wine—” he said, “women; they are—that is—pardon me—Gethsemane—Day of Judgment. . .”","This “that is—that is indeed—” supplied the keynote for the directive, explanatory comments with which he steered the party along—always accompanied by precise cultured gestures that were close to burlesque by now. He would typically raise the circle he made with bent forefinger and thumb to just above his ear, while coyly tilting and turning his head away—and the emotions this evoked were much like those one might feel watching an elderly priest of some alien cult hitch up his robes and dance with strange grace before the sacrificial altar. Then he would sprawl back again in all his grandeur, lay one arm across the back of a neighboring chair, and bewilder them all by demanding they plunge with him into his vivid, keen imaginings of morning—of a frosty, dark winter morning, when the yellowish glow of a nightstand lamp is mirrored in the window-pane and shines out into bare branches, stiff in the icy fog of a morning harsh with the cries of crows. With a few suggestive phrases, he could turn a prosaic everyday scene into stark reality, so that they all shivered when he now spoke of the ice-cold water in the sponge that you pressed to the back of your neck on such a morning—and called it holy. It was a mere digression, an instructive example to sensitize them to the basics of life, an impromptu fantasy, which he then dropped to turn his official and emphatic emotional engagement back to the immediate demands of the late hour’s festive abandon. He was manifestly, indiscriminately in love with each and every female in sight—without respect of person. His advances to the dwarf were such that the crippled woman grinned until her aged, oversize face was a wreath of wrinkles; he paid Frau Stöhr compliments that made the vulgar woman roll her shoulder forward even farther and turned her affectations into almost crazed antics; he asked Fräulein Kleefeld to kiss him on his great, ragged lips and charmed even disconsolate Frau Magnus—and all without any detriment to the tender devotion he showed his traveling companion, whose hand he gallantly and frequently pressed to his lips. “Wine,” he said, “women—that is—that is indeed—permit me to say—doomsday—Gethsemane—”"
»Dann ist es etwas zurückgegangen!« versetzte Hans Castorp rasch. »Es waren sechs.«,"""Then it went down a bit!"" replied Hans Castorp quickly. ""There were six.""","“Then it has gone down a little,” his cousin responded hastily. “It was six.”","“Then it’s gone down a little,” Hans Castorp responded quickly. “It was point seven.”"
"»Wann mißt du dich denn wieder?« fragte er. »Nach dem Essen? Ja, das ist gut. Da ist der Organismus in voller Tätigkeit, da muß es sich zeigen. Daß Behrens von mir verlangte, ich sollte mich ebenfalls messen, das war doch wohl nur Spaß, höre mal, – Settembrini lachte ja auch aus vollem Halse darüber, es hätte doch absolut keinen Sinn. Ich habe ja auch nicht mal ein Thermometer.«","""When are you measuring yourself again?"" he asked. 'After dinner? Yes this is good. Then the organism is in full activity, it has to show itself. The fact that Behrens asked me to measure myself too, that was probably just a joke, listen - Settembrini laughed at the top of his lungs, it made absolutely no sense. I don't even have a thermometer.""","“When do you measure again?” he asked. “After eating? Yes, that’s a good time. When the organism is in full activity, it must show itself. Behrens must have been joking when he told me to take my temperature— Settembrini laughed like anything at the idea; there’s really no sense in it , I haven’t even a thermometer.”","“When do you take your temperature again?” he asked. “After dinner? Yes, that’s a good idea. The organism is at the height of its activity, so it would register then. For Behrens to demand that I ought to take mine, too—now listen, that was surely just meant as a joke. Why, Settembrini laughed his head off at the notion. There would be absolutely no point in it. I don’t even own a thermometer.”"
{256}»Aha. Und wo haben Sie Ihr Thermometer?«,"{256}""Aha. And where is your thermometer?'",“Aha! And where is your thermometer?”,“Aha! And where is your thermometer?”
"Die Lehrer des Mittelalters wollten wissen, die Zeit sei eine Illusion, ihr Ablauf in Ursächlichkeit und Folge nur das Ergebnis einer Vorrichtung unsrer Sinne und das wahre Sein der Dinge ein stehendes Jetzt. War er am Meere spaziert, der Doktor, der diesen Gedanken zuerst empfing, – die schwache Bit{826}ternis der Ewigkeit auf seinen Lippen? Wir wiederholen jedenfalls, daß es Ferienlizenzen sind, von denen wir da sprechen, Phantasien der Lebensmuße, von denen der sittliche Geist so rasch gesättigt ist, wie ein rüstiger Mann vom Ruhen im warmen Sand. An den menschlichen Erkenntnismitteln und –formen Kritik zu üben, ihre reine Gültigkeit fraglich zu machen, wäre absurd, ehrlos, widersacherisch, wenn je ein anderer Sinn damit verbunden wäre, als derjenige, der Vernunft Grenzen anzuweisen, die sie nicht überschreitet, ohne sich der Vernachlässigung ihrer eigentlichen Aufgaben schuldig zu machen. Wir können einem Manne wie Herrn Settembrini nur dankbar sein, wenn er dem jungen Menschen, dessen Schicksal uns beschäftigt, und den er bei Gelegenheit sehr fein als ein »Sorgenkind des Lebens« angesprochen hatte, die Metaphysik mit pädagogischer Entschiedenheit als »Das Böse« kennzeichnete. Und wir ehren das Andenken eines uns lieben Verstorbenen am besten, indem wir aussprechen, daß Sinn, Zweck und Ziel des kritischen Prinzips nur eines sein kann und darf: der Pflichtgedanke, der Lebensbefehl. Ja, indem gesetzgeberische Weisheit die Grenzen der Vernunft kritisch absteckte, hat sie an ebendiesen Grenzen die Fahne des Lebens aufgepflanzt und es als die soldatische Schuldigkeit des Menschen proklamiert, unter ihr Dienst zu tun. Soll man es dem jungen Hans Castorp aufs Entschuldigungskonto setzen und annehmen, es habe ihn in seiner lästerlichen Zeitwirtschaft, seinem schlimmen Getändel mit der Ewigkeit bestärkt, daß, was ein melancholischer Schwadroneur seines militärischen Vetters »Biereifer« genannt, letalen Ausgang genommen hatte?","The teachers of the Middle Ages wanted to know that time is an illusion, that its causality and sequence are only the result of a device of our senses and that the true being of things is a standing now. Had he been walking by the sea, the doctor who first received this thought - the faint bitterness of eternity on his lips? In any case, we repeat that we are talking about holiday licenses, fantasies of leisure in life, which saturate the moral spirit as quickly as a spry man from resting on the warm sand. Criticizing the human means and forms of cognition, questioning their pure validity, would be absurd, dishonorable, contradictory if it were ever connected with a different meaning than that of assigning limits to reason that it does not exceed without itself guilty of neglecting their proper duties. We can only be grateful to a man like M. Settembrini when, with pedagogical decisiveness, he characterized metaphysics as ""evil"" in the young man whose fate concerns us, and whom he very subtly addressed on occasion as a ""problem child of life"". . And we best honor the memory of a loved one who has passed away by saying that the meaning, purpose and aim of the critical principle can and may only be one thing: the duty of thought, the command of life. Yes, while legislative wisdom critically demarcated the limits of reason, it planted the flag of life on these very limits and proclaimed it as a soldier's duty of man to do his service. Should one blame young Hans Castorp and assume that it strengthened his blasphemous management of time, his wicked dalliance with eternity, that what a melancholic swaggerer of his military cousin called ""beer zeal"" had ended fatally?","The schoolmen of the Middle Ages would have it that time is an illusion; that its flow in sequence and causality is only the result of a sensory device, and the real existence of things in an abiding present. Was he walking by the sea, the philosopher to whom this thought first came, walking by the sea, with the faint bitterness of eternity upon his lips? We must repeat that, as for us, we have been speaking only of the lawful licence of a holiday, of fantasies born of leisure, of which the wellconducted mind wearies as quickly as a vigorous man does of lying in the warm sand. To call into question our human means and powers of perception, to question their validity, would be absurd, dishonourable, arbitrary, if it were done in any other spirit than to set bounds to reason, which she may not overstep without incurring the reproach of neglecting her own task. We can only be grateful to a man like Herr Settembrini, who with pedagogic dogmatism characterized metaphysics as the “evil principle,” to the young man in whose fate we are interested, and whom he had once subtly called “life’s delicate child.” We shall best honour the memory of one departed, who was dear to us, if we say plainly that the meaning, the end and aim of the critical principle can and may be but one thing: the thought of duty, the law of life. Yes, lawgiving wisdom, in marking off the limits of reason, planted precisely at those limits the banner of life, and proclaimed it man’s soldierly duty to serve under that banner. May we set it down on the credit side of Hans Castorp’s account, that he had been strengthened in his vicious time-economy, his baleful traffic with eternity, by seeing that all his cousin’s zeal, called doggedness by a certain melancholy blusterer, had but the more surely brought him to a fatal end?","The scholastics of the Middle Ages claimed to know that time is an illusion, its flow toward objective consequences due solely to our sensory apparatus, and that the true state of things is a permanent now. Was he walking by the sea, that professor who was first struck by this notion, the faint bitter taste of eternity on his lips? In any case, we repeat that we are speaking of vacation scenes, of fantasies in moments of leisure, of which the moral intellect quickly has its fill, like a vigorous man who has rested long enough in the warm sand. For us to criticize the methods and forms by which human beings come to know things, to question their validity per se, would be absurd, dishonorable, antagonistic, if we did so for any other purpose than to point out those limits to reason that reason can never overstep without being guilty of neglecting its own tasks. We can only be grateful to a man like Herr Settembrini for characterizing metaphysics as “evil” as he once did when speaking, with his usual pedagogic decisiveness, to the young man with whose fate we are concerned and whom on one occasion he very aptly called a “problem child of life.” And we can best honor the memory of a young man, who though departed is still dear to us, by saying that the critical principle can and must have only one meaning, purpose, and goal: the idea of duty, the command given by life itself. Yes, when law-giving wisdom critically staked out the limits of reason, it also planted the flag of life at those same boundaries and proclaimed that it is man’s soldierly duty to serve beneath that banner. But Hans Castorp’s military cousin had been a “zealot”—as a melancholic show-off once said—and that had led to a fatal outcome. Might we perhaps find some excuse for our young hero’s behavior in assuming that such an outcome encouraged him in his disgraceful management of time, in his wicked dawdling with eternity?"
"»So ungefähr. Das sind Reaktionen, wissen Sie. Da aber alle Reaktionen und Reflexe von Hause aus einen Zweck haben, so vermuten wir Physiologen beinah, daß auch diese Begleiterscheinungen psychischer Affekte eigentlich zweckmäßige Schutzmittel sind, Abwehrreflexe des Körpers, wie die Gänsehaut. Wissen Sie, wie Sie eine Gänsehaut kriegen?«","'Something like that. Those are reactions, you know. But since all reactions and reflexes have an inherent purpose, we physiologists almost suspect that these side effects of psychic affects are actually useful means of protection, defensive reflexes of the body, like goose bumps. Do you know how you get goosebumps?'","“Something like that. Those are reactions, you know. But it is the nature of reactions and reflexes to have a reason for happening; we are beginning to suspect, we physiologists, that the phenomena accompanying emotion are really defence mechanisms, protective reflexes of the system. Goose-flesh, now. Do you know how you come to have goose-flesh?”","“More or less. Those are all reactions, you see.

"Wenn gewisse Anspielungen Herrn Settembrinis Hans Castorp geärgert hatten, – verwundern durfte er sich nicht darüber und hatte kein Recht, den Humanisten erzieherischer Spürsucht zu zeihen. Ein Blinder hätte bemerken müssen, wie es um ihn stand: er selbst tat nichts, um es geheimzuhalten, eine gewisse Hochherzigkeit und noble Einfalt hinderte ihn einfach, aus seinem Herzen eine Mördergrube zu machen, worin er sich immerhin – und vorteilhaft, wenn man will, – von dem dünnhaarigen Verliebten aus Mannheim und seinem schleichenden Wesen unterschied. Wir erinnern und wiederholen, daß dem Zustande, in dem er sich befand, in der Regel ein Drang und Zwang, sich zu offenbaren, eingeboren ist, ein Trieb zum Bekenntnis und Geständnis, eine blinde Eingenommenheit von sich selbst und eine Sucht, die Welt mit sich zu erfüllen, – desto befremdlicher für uns Nüchterne, je weniger Sinn, Vernunft und Hoffnung offenbar bei der Sache ist. Wie solche Leute es eigentlich anfangen, sich zu verraten, ist schwer zu sagen; sie können, scheint es, nichts tun und lassen, was sie nicht verriete, – besonders nun gar in einer Gesellschaft, von der ein urteilender Kopf bemerkt hatte, sie habe im ganzen nur zwei Dinge im Sinn, nämlich erstens Temperatur und dann – nochmals Temperatur, das heißt zum Beispiel die Frage, mit wem Frau Generalkonsul Wurmbrandt aus Wien sich für die Flatterhaftigkeit des Hauptmanns Miklosich schadlos halte: ob mit dem völlig genesenen schwedischen Recken oder mit dem Staatsanwalt Paravant aus Dortmund oder drittens mit beiden zugleich. Denn daß die Bande, die den Staatsanwalt und Frau Salomon aus Amsterdam mehrere Monate lang verknüpft hatten, nach gütlicher Übereinkunft gelöst worden waren und Frau Salomon, dem Zuge ihrer Jahre folgend, sich den zarteren Semestern zugewandt und den wulstlippigen Gänser vom Tische der {360}Kleefeld unter ihre Fittiche genommen oder, wie Frau Stöhr es in einer Art von Kanzleistil, dabei aber nicht ohne Anschaulichkeit ausdrückte, ihn »sich beigebogen« hatte, – das war sicher und bekannt, so daß folglich der Staatsanwalt freie Hand hatte, sich der Generalkonsulin wegen mit dem Schweden zu schlagen oder zu vertragen.","If certain allusions had annoyed Herr Settembrini Hans Castorp, he shouldn't have been surprised and had no right to accuse the humanist of pedagogical intuition. A blind man should have noticed how things were with him: he himself did nothing to keep it a secret, a certain generosity and noble simplicity simply prevented him from turning his heart into a den of murderers, in which he nevertheless - and advantageously, if you will , - differed from the thin-haired lover from Mannheim and his insidious nature. We remember and repeat that the condition in which he found himself usually had an inherent urge and compulsion to reveal himself, a drive to confess and confess, a blind self-absorbedness and an addiction to take the world with him to come true – the more disconcerting for us sober ones, the less sense, reason and hope there is in the matter. How such people actually begin to give themselves away is difficult to say; they can't seem to do anything that they won't betray - especially in a society that a judging mind had remarked had only two things on its mind, namely, first temperature and then - more temperature , that means, for example, the question with whom Ms. Consul General Wurmbrandt from Vienna held herself harmless for the fickleness of Captain Miklosich: whether with the fully recovered Swedish warrior or with the public prosecutor Paravant from Dortmund or, thirdly, with both at the same time. For that the ties which had bound the public prosecutor and Mrs. Salomon from Amsterdam for several months had been broken by amicable agreement and Mrs. Salomon, following the course of her years, turned to the more tender semesters and the thick-lipped geese from the {360} Kleefeld was taken under her wing or, as Frau Stöhr put it in a kind of office style, but not without clarity, ""bent over"" him - that was certain and well known, so that the public prosecutor had a free hand to ask the Consul General because of hitting or getting along with the Swede.","IF certain insinuations on Herr Settembrini’s part had angered Hans Castorp, the annoyance was quite unjustified, as also his feeling that the schoolmaster had been spying on him. A blind man must have seen how it stood with the youth; he himself did nothing to conceal his state, being prevented by a certain native and lofty simplicity. He inclined rather to wear his heart upon his sleeve, in contrast—if you like, favourable contrast—to the devotee from Mannheim, with his thin hair and furtive mien. But in general we would emphasize the fact that people in Hans Castorp’s state regularly feel a craving for self-revelation, an impulse to confess themselves, a blind preoccupation with self, and a thirst to possess the world of their own emotions, which is the more offensive to the sober onlooker, the less sense, reasonableness, or hope there lies in the whole affair. How people in this state go about to betray themselves is hard to define; but it seems they can neither do nor leave undone anything which would not have that effect—doubly so, then, in a society like that of the Berghof, where, as the critically minded Herr Settembrini once expressed it, people were possessed of two ideas, and only two: temperature—and then again temperature. By the second temperature he meant preoccupation with such questions as, for instance, with whom Frau CónsulGeneral Wurmbrandt from Vienna consoled herself for the defection of Captain Miklosich—whether with the Swedish minion, or Lawyer Paravant from Dortmund, or both. Everybody knew that the bond between the lawyer and Frau Salomon from Amsterdam, after subsisting for several months, had been broken by common consent, and that Frau Salomon had followed the leanings of her time of life and taken up with callow youth. The thick-lipped Gänser from Hermine Kleefeld’s table was for the present under her wing; she had taken him “to have and to hold,” as Frau Stöhr, in legal parlance, yet not without perspicuity, had put it—and thus Lawyer Paravant was free either to quarrel or to compound with the Swede over the favours of the Frau Consul-General, as seemed to him advisable.","Although some of Herr Settembrini’s innuendoes had annoyed Hans Castorp, there was no reason he should have been amazed by them—nor did he have any right to accuse the humanist of pedagogic spying. A blind man would have noticed how things stood with him; he had done nothing to keep it secret. Out of a certain generosity and noble simplicity of spirit, he was a man who tended to wear his heart on his sleeve, which at least distinguished him—to his advantage, if you like—from the love-sick Mannheimer with thinning hair and furtive ways. We would remind our readers that, as a rule, inherent in the condition in which Hans Castorp found himself is an urge, a compulsion, to reveal oneself, a need to be open and to confess, a blind prejudice in one’s own favor, and a rage to fill the world with oneself—and the less common sense, reason, and hope apparently involved, the more dismaying it is for those of us of a more sober temperament. It is hard to say how such people actually first come to betray themselves; they cannot, it seems, do or refrain from doing anything that does not betray them—particularly (as a certain gentleman who had no trouble forming opinions remarked) in the company of people who have only two things in their heads: the first being their temperature, the second their temperature. By the latter he meant, for instance, the question of who Frau Wurmbrandt from Vienna, the general consul’s wife, had decided would have to pay damages for her loss of fickle Captain Miklosich: the fully mended Swedish bruiser, or Prosecutor Paravant from Dortmund, or—a third possibility—both at once. Because it was certain and general knowledge that the bond linking the prosecutor and Frau Salomon from Amsterdam had, after several months, been broken by mutual agreement and that Frau Salomon, obeying the impulse of her years, had turned to a lad of a more tender age, thick-lipped Gänser from Hermine Kleefeld’s table, and had now taken him under her wing—or, as Frau Stöhr put it in her own rather picturesque legalese, had “procured.” And so the prosecutor now had a free hand either to do battle over Frau Wurmbrandt, or to come to an understanding with the Swede."

"»Urdinge, klassische Tatsachen, Sie rühren, junger Mann, mit Ihrem gewandten kleinen Wort an heilige Gegebenheiten«, erwiderte Peeperkorn. »Den Mann berauscht seine Begierde, das Weib verlangt und gewärtigt, von seiner Begierde berauscht zu werden. Daher unsere Verpflichtung zum Gefühl. Daher die entsetzliche Schande der Gefühllosigkeit, der Ohnmacht, das Weib zur Begierde zu wecken. Trinken Sie ein Glas Rotwein mit mir? Ich trinke. Mich dürstet. Die Feuchtigkeitsabgabe dieses Tages war erheblich.«","'Basic things, classic facts, you touch sacred facts with your nifty little word, young man,' replied Peeperkorn. “Man is intoxicated by his desire, woman demands and expects to be intoxicated by her desire. Hence our commitment to feeling. Hence the dreadful shame of insensibility, of powerlessness to arouse woman to desire. Have a glass of red wine with me? I drink. I am thirsty. The humidity release that day was significant.”","“Primitive—traditional mysteries you touch on there, young man, applying your glib little phrases to the sacred conditions of our existence,” responded Peeperkorn. “Man is intoxicated by his desire, woman demands and expects to be intoxicated by it. Hence our holy duty of feeling, hence the shame in unfeelingness, in powerlessness to awaken the woman to desire. Will you take a glass of red wine with me? I will drink, for I am thirsty. I have given out a considerable amount of water to-day.”","“Primal, classic questions you’ve touched on there, young man, with your apt little discourse on holy matters,” Peeperkorn responded. “Desire intoxicates the male, the female demands and expects to be intoxicated by his desire. Which is the source of our duty to feel. And the source of the terrible disgrace when feeling is lacking, when there is an inability to awaken the female to desire. Will you drink a glass of red wine with me? I drink. I thirst. My loss of fluids today was considerable.”"
"»Enorm,« sagte Hans Castorp, »enorm anschaulich ist sie gemalt, die Haut. Ich glaube, ähnlich gut gemalte ist mir nie vorgekommen. Man meint die Poren zu sehen.« Und er fuhr leicht mit dem Handrande über das Dekolleté des Bildes, das sehr weiß gegen die übertriebene Rötung des Gesichtes abstach, wie ein Körperteil, der gewöhnlich dem Lichte nicht ausgesetzt ist, und so, absichtlich oder nicht, die Vorstellung des Entblößtseins aufdringlich hervorrief, – ein jedenfalls ziemlich plumper Effekt.","'Enormous,' said Hans Castorp, 'it's painted incredibly vividly, the skin. I don't think I've ever come across anything as well painted. One seems to see the pores.” And he ran the edge of his hand lightly over the cleavage of the picture, which was very white against the exaggerated redness of the face, like a part of the body not usually exposed to the light, and so, intentionally or not , which insistently evoked the idea of being naked - a rather clumsy effect anyway.","“Enormously,” said Hans Castorp. “Simply enormously. I’ve never seen skin painted anything like so well. You can fairly see the pores.” And he ran the edge of his hand lightly over the bare neck and shoulders, the skin of which, especially by contrast with the exaggerated red of the face, was very white, as though seldom exposed. Whether this effect was premeditated or not, it was rather suggestive.","“Terribly,” Hans Castorp said, “terribly lifelike skin. I don’t think I’ve ever seen skin so well painted. It’s as if you can see the pores.” And he brushed the edge of his hand across the skin left exposed by her décolletage, which stood out very white against the exaggerated redness of the face, like a part of the body never exposed to light, evoking, whether intentionally or not, an even stronger sensation of nakedness—a rather crude effect in any case."
"Hier steht eine Erscheinung bevor, über die der Erzähler sich selbst zu wundern gut tut, damit nicht der Leser auf eigene Hand sich allzusehr darüber wundere. Während nämlich unser Rechenschaftsbericht über die ersten drei Wochen von Hans Castorps Aufenthalt bei Denen hier oben (einundzwanzig Hochsommertage, auf die sich menschlicher Voraussicht nach dieser Aufenthalt überhaupt hatte beschränken sollen) Räume und Zeitmengen verschlungen hat, deren Ausdehnung unseren eigenen halb eingestandenen Erwartungen nur zu sehr entspricht, – wird die Bewältigung der nächsten drei Wochen seines Besuches an diesem Orte kaum so viele Zeilen, ja Worte und Augenblicke erfordern, als jener Seiten, Bogen, Stunden und Tagewerke gekostet hat: im Nu, das sehen wir kommen, werden diese drei Wochen hinter uns gebracht und beigesetzt sein.","Here an apparition is imminent which the narrator does well to wonder about himself, lest the reader himself be too surprised about it. While our account of the first three weeks of Hans Castorp's stay with those up here (twenty-one midsummer days, to which human foresight this stay should have been limited) swallowed up spaces and amounts of time, the extent of which was only too great for our own half-confessed expectations corresponds, - the mastering of the next three weeks of his visit to this place will hardly require as many lines, even words and moments, as the pages, sheets, hours and days' work cost him: in no time, we see that coming, these three weeks will be be put behind us and buried.","AND now we are confronted by a phenomenon upon which the author himself may well comment, lest the reader do so in his stead. Our account of the first three weeks of Hans Castorp’s stay with “those up here”—twenty-one midsummer days, to which his visit, so far as human eye could see, should have been confined—has consumed in the telling an amount of time and space only too well confirming the author’s halfconfessed expectations; while our narrative of his next three weeks will scarcely cost as many lines, or even words and minutes, as the earlier three did pages, quires, hours, and working-days. We apprehend that these next three weeks will be over and done with in the twinkling of an eye.","And now we have a new phenomenon—about which the narrator would do well to express his own amazement, if only to prevent his readers from being all too amazed on their own. The fact is, the account of the first three weeks of Hans Castorp’s stay with “the people up here” (twenty-one days at the height of summer, to which, by all calculation, it was supposed to have been limited) has consumed quantities of space and time that correspond only too well to what the author himself expected, and indeed half confessed; the coverage of the next three weeks of the visit, however, will require about as many lines—or words, or even seconds—as the first three weeks required pages, quires, hours, and working days. We can see it coming—we’ll have those three weeks behind us and laid to rest in no time."
"Eines Abends nun aber, wie das wohl ohne besonderen Anlaß einmal geschehen mochte, hatte die Abendgeselligkeit in Halle und Zimmern sich reger als alltäglich gestaltet. Es hatte Musik {840}gegeben, Zigeunerweisen, von einem ungarischen Studenten auf der Geige keck exekutiert, worauf Hofrat Behrens, der ebenfalls mit Doktor Krokowski auf eine Viertelstunde erschienen war, irgend jemanden genötigt hatte, in der tieferen Lage des Pianinos die Melodie des »Pilgerchors« zu spielen, während er selbst, daneben stehend, den Diskant des Instrumentes auf hüpfende Art mit einer Bürste bearbeitete und so die begleitenden Violinfiguren parodierte. Das gab zu lachen. Unter großem Applaus, mit wohlwollendem Kopfschütteln, das dem eigenen Übermut galt, verließ der Hofrat danach die Konversationsräume. Die Geselligkeit aber spann sich hin, noch wurde fortmusiziert, ohne daß gesammelte Aufmerksamkeit dafür gefordert worden wäre, man saß bei Domino und Bridge mit Getränken, unterhielt sich mit den Scherzinstrumenten, und plauderte da und dort. Auch die Gesellschaft des Guten Russentisches hatte sich unter die Gruppen der Halle und des Klavierzimmers gemischt. Man sah Mynheer Peeperkorn an verschiedenen Stellen, – man konnte nicht umhin, ihn zu sehen, sein majestätisches Haupt überragte jede Umgebung, schlug sie durch königliche Wucht und Bedeutung, und wenn diejenigen, die ihn umstanden, ursprünglich nur durch das Gerücht seines Reichtums mochten angezogen worden sein, so war es doch sehr bald seine Persönlichkeit selbst und allein, an der sie hingen: lächelnd standen sie und nickten ihm zu, ermunternd und selbstvergessen; gebannt durch sein fahles Auge unter den mächtigen Stirnfalten, in Spannung gehalten durch die Eindringlichkeit seiner langnägeligen Kulturgebärden und ohne über die unverständliche Abgerissenheit, Undeutlichkeit und tatsächliche Unbrauchbarkeit dessen, was ihnen folgte, sich des leisesten Enttäuschungsgefühles bewußt zu werden.","But one evening, as might have happened without any particular reason, the evening socializing in the hall and rooms had been more lively than usual. There had been music {840}, gypsy tunes, boldly executed by a Hungarian student on the violin, whereupon Hofrat Behrens, who had also appeared for a quarter of an hour with Doctor Krokowski, had forced someone to play the melody of the » Pilgerchors« while he himself, standing next to it, worked the treble of the instrument in a hopping manner with a brush, thus parodying the accompanying violin figures. That made me laugh. The privy councilor then left the conversation room to great applause and a benevolent shake of the head in recognition of his own high spirits. But the socializing lasted, the music was still being played without requiring any concentrated attention, one sat with drinks over dominoes and bridge, conversed with the joke instruments, and chatted here and there. The company from the Good Russian Table had also mingled with the groups in the hall and the piano room. Mynheer Peeperkorn was seen in various places--one could not help but see him, his majestic head towering over all surroundings, striking them with regal might and importance, and attracted when those who stood about him originally liked only by the rumor of his wealth soon it was his personality itself and alone to which they clung: smiling they stood and nodded to him, encouraging and self-forgotten; spellbound by his pale eyes under the powerful wrinkles on his forehead, kept in tension by the intensity of his long-nailed cultural gestures and without becoming aware of the slightest feeling of disappointment about the incomprehensible fragmentation, indistinctness and actual uselessness of what followed them.","One evening the social hour happened to be livelier than usual—which it might be at any time without especial cause. A Hungarian student played spirited gipsy waltzes on his fiddle; and Hofrat Behrens, who chanced to be present for a quarter-hour with Dr. Krokowski, got somebody to play the melody of the “Pilgrims’ Chorus” on the bass notes of the piano, while he himself operated in a skipping movement with a brush over the treble, and parodied the violin counterpoint. Everybody laughed; and the Hofrat, nodding benevolent approval of his own sprightly performance, withdrew amid applause. The gaiety prolonged itself, there was more music, people sat down with drinks beside them to dominoes and bridge, trifled with the optical instruments, or stood in groups talking. Even the Russian circle mingled with the others in hall and music-room. Mynheer Peeperkorn was to be seen among them—or rather, he could not but be seen, wherever he was, his kingly head towering high above any scene, and dwarfing it by the sheer weight and majesty of his person. Those who stood about him, drawn first by the reports of the man’s wealth, soon hung absorbed upon his personality. Forgetful of all else, they stood laughing and nodding, spellbound by the pallid eye, by the brow’s mighty folds, by the compulsion of the gestures his longnailed hands performed. And never, for one moment, were they conscious of any lack in his incoherent, rhapsodic, literally futile remarks.","One evening, however, for no particular reason, the evening social in the lobby and public rooms turned more lively than usual. There had been music, Gypsy melodies, jauntily executed on the violin by a Hungarian student; and then Director Behrens, who had likewise appeared for fifteen minutes, accompanied by Dr. Krokowski, got someone to play the melody of the “Pilgrims’ Chorus” on the bass register of the piano, while he stood close by and attacked the treble with a brush that he bounced over the keys in a parody of violin arpeggios. Bursts of laughter. Shaking his head magnanimously at his own friskiness, the director then left the social rooms amid loud applause. The convivial mood continued, more music followed, but nothing that demanded their particular attention; people gathered with their drinks for dominoes and bridge, amused themselves with the optical gadgets, and stood chatting in little groups here and there. Even the people from the Good Russian table mingled with the others in the lobby and the music room. Mynheer Peeperkorn could be seen moving about—one could not avoid seeing him, for that majestic head towered above its surroundings, overwhelming everything with royal vigor and import. And although those who now gathered around him might at first have been drawn to him merely by his rumored wealth, very soon it was his personality and it alone to which they clung. Oblivious to all else, they stood there smiling and nodding encouragement. Caught in the spell of that pallid gaze from beneath those mighty creases on his brow, held in suspense by the emphatic cultured gestures of his long-nailed hands, they were not even vaguely aware of being disappointed by the incomprehensible, fragmented, muddled, indeed useless statements that followed."
"Da Luise Ziemßen sich schluchzend abgewandt hatte, war es Hans Castorp, der dem Regungs- und Hauchlosen mit der Spitze des Ringfingers die Lider schloß, ihm die Hände behutsam auf der Decke zusammenlegte. Dann stand auch er und weinte, ließ über seine Wangen die Tränen laufen, die den englischen Marineoffizier dort so gebrannt hatten, – dies klare Naß, so reichlich-bitterlich fließend überall in der Welt und zu jeder Stunde, daß man das Tal der Erden poetisch nach ihm benannt hat; dies alkalisch-salzige Drüsenprodukt, das die Nervenerschütterung durchdringenden Schmerzes, physischen wie seelischen Schmerzes, unserem Körper entpreßt. Er wußte, es sei auch etwas Muzin und Eiweiß darin.","Since Luise Ziemssen had turned away sobbing, it was Hans Castorp who closed the lids of the motionless, breathless man with the tip of his ring finger and carefully laid his hands together on the blanket. Then he, too, stood and cried, letting the tears run down his cheeks, which had so stung the English naval officer there—this clear wet, flowing so abundantly and bitterly everywhere in the world and at all hours, that the valley of the earth was poetic named after him; This alkaline-salty gland product that wrings the nerve shock of penetrating pain, physical as well as mental pain, from our body. He knew there was some mucin and albumen in it too.","Louisa Ziemssen turned sobbing away; it was Hans Castorp who bent over the moveless, breathless form, closed the eyes with the tip of his ring-finger, and laid the hands together on the coverlet. Then he too stood and wept, tears ran down his cheeks, like those that had smarted the skin of the English officer of marines: those clear drops flowing in such bitter abundance every hour of our day all over our world, till in sheer poetic justice we have named the earth we live in after them; that alkaline, salty gland-secretion, which is pressed from our system by the nervous stress of acute pain, whether physical or mental. It contained, as Hans Castorp knew, a certain amount of mucin and albumen as well.","Luise Ziemssen turned away sobbing, and so it was Hans Castorp who reached out with his ring finger to close the eyelids of the motionless form that no longer breathed, then carefully laid the hands together on the blanket. Then he stood there, too, and wept, let the tears flow down his cheeks, like those that had stung the cheeks of the English naval officer—the colorless liquid that flows at every hour everywhere in the world, so richly and bitterly that earth’s vale has poetically been named after it: an alkaline, salty liquid that our body secretes from glands when our nerves are subjected to the shock of pain, whether physical or psychological. He knew that it also contains traces of mucin and protein."
"»Ja, das ist, weiß Gott, eine nette Gelehrsamkeit. Die hätte ich gern im Dienste schon wieder verschwitzt«, erwiderte Joachim. »Aber ich habe noch Sputum«, sagte er mit einem zugleich lässigen und heftigen Achselzucken, das ihm nicht gut zu Gesichte stand, und ließ seinen Vetter etwas sehen, was er aus der {18}ihm zugekehrten Seitentasche seines Ulsters zur Hälfte herauszog und gleich wieder verwahrte: eine flache, geschweifte Flasche aus blauem Glase mit einem Metallverschluß. »Das haben die meisten von uns hier oben«, sagte er. »Es hat auch einen Namen bei uns, so einen Spitznamen, ganz fidel. Du siehst dir die Gegend an?«","'Yes, God knows that's a nice scholarship. I'd have liked to have sweated it out again while I was on duty,' replied Joachim. ""But I've still got sputum,"" he said, with a shrug that was both casual and violent, which didn't look good on him, and let his cousin see something, which he pulled half out of the side pocket of his ulster that was facing him, and at once stored again: a flat, curved bottle of blue glass with a metal stopper. ""Most of us have up here,"" he said. »It also has a name here, a nickname like that, really jolly. Are you checking out the area?”","“Fine sort of learning! God knows I wish I’d had it sweated out of my system in the service,” responded Joachim. “But I still have sputum,” he said, with a shoulder-shrug that was somehow indifferent and vehement both at once, and became him but ill. He half pulled out and showed to his cousin something he carried in the side pocket of his overcoat, next to Hans Castorp. It was a flat, curving bottle of bluish glass, with a metal cap. “Most of us up here carry it,” he said, shoving it back. “It even has a nickname; they make quite a joke of it. You are looking at the landscape?”","“Yes, a fine sort of learning, God knows. I would gladly have unlearned it all on active duty,” Joachim retorted. “But I still have sputum,” he said with a nonchalant, but somehow vehement shrug that did not suit him at all; and now he pulled something halfway out of the nearer side pocket of his ulster, showed it to his cousin, and put it away again at once—a curved, flattened bottle of bluish glass with a metal cap. “Most of us up here have one,” he said. “We even have a name for it, a kind of nickname, a joke really. Having a look at the scenery, are you?”"
"»Ist das ein Pädagog!« sagte er … »Ein humanistischer Pädagog, das muß man gestehen. Immerfort wirkt er berichtigend auf dich ein, abwechselnd in Form von Geschichten und in abstrakter Form. Und auf Dinge kommt man mit ihm zu sprechen, – nie hätte man gedacht, daß man darüber reden oder sie auch nur verstehen könnte. Und wenn ich unten im Flachlande mit ihm zusammengetroffen wäre, so würde ich sie auch nicht verstanden haben«, fügte er hinzu.","""Is that a pedagogue?"" he said ... ""A humanistic pedagogue, one has to admit that. He is always correcting you, alternately in story form and in abstract form. And you get to talk to him about things - you never thought that you could talk about them or even understand them. And if I had met him down in the plains, I should not have understood them either,' he added.","“Oh, what a schoolmaster!” he said. “A humanistic one, of course. He never leaves off setting you right—first by means of anecdote, then by abstractions. And the things one gets to talk about with him, things you would never have thought you could talk about, or even understand! And if I had met him down below,” he added, “I never should have understood.”","“What a pedagogue,” he said. “A humanist pedagogue, admittedly. He just never stops correcting you, sometimes in the form of stories and sometimes more abstractly. And you end up talking with him about things—that you never would have thought you would talk about or even understand. And if I had run into him down in the flatlands, I’m sure I would not have understood them,” he added."
"»Du hast ein neues Kleid«, sagte er, um sie betrachten zu dürfen, und hörte sie antworten:","""You have a new dress,"" he said to be allowed to look at her, and heard her answer:","“You’ve a new frock on,” he said, as an excuse for looking at her; and heard her answer.","“You’re wearing a new dress,” he said, as an excuse for gazing at her. And now he heard her answer."

"Hans Castorp war kein Knabe mehr, er hatte Gewalt über die Gefäßnerven, die sein Gesicht hätten erblassen oder erröten lassen können. Er sagte:","Hans Castorp was no longer a boy, he had power over the vascular nerves that could have turned his face pale or reddened. He said:","Hans Castorp was no raw youth, he had control over the nerves that might have made the blood rush to or leave his face. He said: “Oh, so she has emerged from behind the Caucasus again, has she?","Hans Castorp was no child, he could control the nerves to the veins that make your face turn pale or blush. He said, “Oh, her?"
"»Das sollte man nicht denken«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Sie ist so gut im Stand. Gerade für brustkrank sollte man sie nicht halten.« Und er versuchte mit dem Vetter einen flotten Blick zu tauschen, fand aber, daß Joachims sonnverbranntes Gesicht eine fleckige Färbung zeigte, wie sonnverbrannte Gesichter sie annehmen, wenn das Blut daraus weicht, und daß sein Mund sich auf ganz eigentümlich klägliche Weise verzerrt hatte, – zu einem Ausdruck, der dem jungen Hans Castorp einen unbe{113}stimmten Schrecken einflößte und ihn veranlaßte, sofort den Gegenstand zu wechseln und sich nach anderen Personen zu erkundigen, wobei er Marusja und Joachims Gesichtsausdruck rasch zu vergessen suchte, was ihm auch völlig gelang.","""You shouldn't think that,"" said Hans Castorp. ""She's in such good condition. One shouldn't take her for a chest disease."" And he tried to exchange a quick look with his cousin, but found that Joachim's sunburned face was showing a blotchy coloration, such as sunburned faces take on when that Blood spurted from it, and that his mouth had twisted in a very peculiar, pitiful way - an expression which gave young Hans Castorp a vague fright and caused him to immediately change the subject and look for other people inquire, trying to quickly forget the facial expressions of Marusja and Joachim, which he completely succeeded in doing.","“Who would have thought it?” said Hans Castorp. “She looks so very fit. Chest trouble is the last thing one would accuse her of.” He tried to catch his cousin’s eye, and saw that Joachim’s sunburnt face had gone all spotted, as a tanned complexion will when the blood leaves it with suddenness; his mouth too was pitifully drawn, and wore an expression that sent an indefinable chill of fear over Hans Castorp and made him hasten to change the subject. He hurriedly inquired about others of their tablemates and tried to forget Marusja and the look on Joachim’s face—an effort in which he presently succeeded.","“You’d never know it,” Hans Castorp said. “She’s in such good shape. You’d never take her for someone with a weak chest.” And he tried to catch his cousin’s eye, but discovered that Joachim’s tanned face looked all blotchy, the way tanned faces do when the blood rushes out of them, and that he had wrenched his mouth into a peculiar, woeful expression that gave Hans Castorp a vague fright and caused him immediately to change the subject. He asked about certain other people and tried to forget both Marusya and Joachim’s expression—and was totally successful at it."
"Da hatte Hans Castorp nun auch dies und das über Dante gehört, und zwar aus bester Quelle. Ganz fest verließ er sich nicht darauf, in Anbetracht der Windbeutelei des Vermittlers; aber hörenswert war es immerhin, daß Dante ein geweckter Großstädter gewesen sei. Und dann hörte er weiter zu, wie Settembrini von sich selber sprach und erklärte, in seiner, des Enkels Lodovico, Person nun aber hätten die Tendenzen seiner unmittelbaren Vorfahren, die staatsbürgerliche des Großvaters und die humanistische des Vaters, sich vereinigt, indem er nämlich ein Literat, ein freier Schriftsteller geworden sei. Denn die Literatur sei nichts anderes als eben dies: sie sei die Vereinigung von Humanismus und Politik, welche sich um so zwangloser vollziehe, als ja Humanismus selber schon Politik {243}und Politik Humanismus sei … Hier horchte Hans Castorp auf und gab sich Mühe, es recht zu verstehen; denn er durfte nun hoffen, Bierbrauer Magnussens ganze Unbelehrtheit einzusehen und zu erfahren, inwiefern die Literatur denn doch noch etwas anderes sei als »schöne Charaktere«. Ob, fragte Settembrini, seine Zuhörer je von Herrn Brunetto gehört hätten, Brunetto Latini, Stadtschreiber von Florenz um 1250, der ein Buch über die Tugenden und die Laster geschrieben? Dieser Meister zuerst habe den Florentinern Schliff gegeben und sie das Sprechen gelehrt sowie die Kunst, ihre Republik nach den Regeln der Politik zu lenken. »Da haben Sie es, meine Herren!« rief Settembrini. »Da haben Sie es!« Und er sprach vom »Worte«, vom Kultus des Wortes, der Eloquenz, die er den Triumph der Menschlichkeit nannte. Denn das Wort sei die Ehre des Menschen, und nur dieses mache das Leben menschenwürdig. Nicht nur der Humanismus, – Humanität überhaupt, alle Menschenwürde, Menschenachtung und menschliche Selbstachtung sei untrennbar mit dem Worte, mit Literatur verbunden – (»Siehst du wohl,« sagte Hans Castorp später zu seinem Vetter, »siehst du wohl, daß es in der Literatur auf die schönen Worte ankommt? Ich habe es gleich gemerkt.«), – und so sei auch die Politik mit ihr verbunden, oder vielmehr: sie gehe hervor aus dem Bündnis, der Einheit von Humanität und Literatur, denn das schöne Wort erzeuge die schöne Tat. »Sie hatten in Ihrem Lande,« sagte Settembrini, »vor zweihundert Jahren einen Dichter, einen prächtigen alten Plauderer, der großes Gewicht auf eine schöne Handschrift legte, weil er meinte, daß eine solche zum schönen Stile führe. Er hätte ein wenig weiter gehen sollen und sagen, daß ein schöner Stil zu schönen Handlungen führe.« Schön schreiben, das heiße beinahe auch schon schön denken, und von da sei nicht weit mehr zum schönen Handeln. Alle Sittigung und sittliche Vervollkommnung entstamme dem Geiste der Literatur, diesem Gei{244}ste der Menschenehre, welcher zugleich auch der Geist der Humanität und der Politik sei. Ja, dies alles sei eins, sei ein und dieselbe Macht und Idee, und in einen Namen könne man es zusammenfassen. Wie dieser Name laute? Nun, dieser Name setze sich aus vertrauten Silben zusammen, deren Sinn und Majestät die Vettern aber gewiß so recht noch niemals begriffen hätten, – er laute: Zivilisation! Und indem Settembrini dies Wort von den Lippen ließ, warf er seine kleine, gelbe Rechte empor, wie jemand, der einen Toast ausbringt.","Hans Castorp had now also heard this and that about Dante, and from the best source. He didn't count on it entirely, considering the gossip of the agent; but it was still worth hearing that Dante was an alert city dweller. And then he continued to listen as Settembrini spoke of himself and explained that in his person, the grandson Lodovico, the tendencies of his immediate ancestors, the civic tendencies of his grandfather and the humanistic tendencies of his father, had united in that he man of letters, had become a freelance writer. For literature is nothing other than this: it is the union of humanism and politics, which takes place all the more casually since humanism itself is politics {243}and politics is humanism ... Here Hans Castorp listened and made an effort to to understand it rightly; for he could now hope to see the complete ignorance of the brewer Magnussen and to find out to what extent literature was something other than ""beautiful characters."" Had his listeners, Settembrini asked, ever heard of Mr. Brunetto, Brunetto Latini, city clerk of Florence around 1250, who wrote a book on virtues and vices? This master first polished the Florentines and taught them to speak and the art of governing their republic according to the rules of politics. ""There you have it, gentlemen!"" Settembrini exclaimed. ""There you have it!"" And he spoke of the ""word,"" of the cult of the word, of eloquence, which he called the triumph of humanity. Because the word is the honor of man, and only this makes life worthy of man. Not only humanism - humanity in general, all human dignity, human respect and human self-respect is inseparably connected with the word, with literature - (""You see,"" said Hans Castorp later to his cousin, ""you see that in the Literature depends on the beautiful words? I noticed it straight away."") - and so politics is also connected with it, or rather: it emerges from the alliance, the unity of humanity and literature, because the beautiful word creates it beautiful act. 'You had in your country,' said Settembrini, 'two hundred years ago a poet, a splendid old chatterer, who attached great importance to a beautiful handwriting, because he thought that it led to a beautiful style. He should have gone a little further and said that a beautiful style leads to beautiful actions.' To write beautifully is almost to think beautifully, and from there it's not far to beautiful actions. All manners and moral perfection derive from the spirit of literature, this spirit of human honor, which is at the same time the spirit of humanity and politics. Yes, all this is one, is one and the same power and idea, and it can be summed up in one name. What's that name? Well, this name is made up of familiar syllables, the meaning and majesty of which the cousins had certainly never really understood - it read: Civilization! And as Settembrini let that word slip from his lips, he threw up his little yellow right hand, like one offering a toast.","Thus Hans Castorp came to hear something about Dante, and certainly from the lips of authority. He was not too much inclined to believe implicitly all Settembrini said; he considered him too much of a windbag for that. Still it was an interesting conception, this of Dante as the wide-awake citizen of a great metropolis. And now Settembrini went on to speak of himself, and to explain how the tendencies of his immediate forbears, the political from his grandfather, the humanistic from his father, had united in his own person to produce the writer and independent man of letters. For literature was after all nothing else than the combination of humanism and politics; a conjunction the more immediate in that humanism itself was politics and politics humanism. Hans Castorp did his best at this point to listen and comprehend, in the hope of finally learning wherein had consisted the crass ignorance of Magnus the brewer, and finding out what else literature actually was, above and beyond “beautiful characters.” Settembrini asked his audience whether they had ever heard of Brunetto, Brunetto Latini, a Florentine notary, who about the year 1250 had written a book on the subject of the virtues and the vices. He it was who had sharpened the wits of the Florentines, taught them the art of language, and how to guide their state according to the rules of politics. “There you have it, gentlemen, there you have it!” Settembrini cried with ardour, and enlarged upon the cult of the “word,” the art of eloquence, which he called the triumph of the human genius. For the word was the glory of mankind, it alone imparted dignity to life. Not only was humanism bound up with the word, and with literature, but so also was humanity itself, man’s ancient dignity and manly selfrespect (“You heard, didn’t you,” Hans Castorp said later to his cousin, “you heard him say that literature is a question of beautiful words? I spotted it directly”), from which it followed that politics too is bound up with the word. Or, rather, it followed directly from the union, the unity that subsisted between humanity and literature, for the beautiful word begets the beautiful deed. “Two hundred years ago,” Settembrini said, “you had a poet in your country, a magnificent old chatterbox who set great store in good handwriting because he thought it must induce a good style. He should have gone a step further and said that a good style would lead to good deeds,” Settembrini added. For writing well was almost the same as thinking well, and thinking well was the next thing to acting well. All moral discipline, all moral perfection derived from the soul of literature, from the soul of human dignity, which was the moving spirit of both humanity and politics. Yes, they were all one, one and the same force, one and the same idea, and all of them could be comprehended in one single word. This word? Ah, it was already familiar to their ears; yet he would wager the cousins had never before rightly grasped its meaning and its majesty: the word was—civilization! And as Settembrini brought it out, he flung his small, yellow-skinned right hand in the air, as though proposing a toast.","And so now Hans Castorp had heard a thing or two about Dante, and from the best of sources. Given the fact that it came from a windbag, he did not trust the information entirely, but it was worth hearing about how Dante had been a quick-witted citizen of a great city. And it was likewise worthwhile listening to Settembrini talk about himself, declaring that he, the grandson Lodovico, had united the propensities of his two immediate forebears—the political bent of his grandfather and the humanistic bent of his father—by becoming a man of letters, a free-lance writer. For literature was nothing other than the union of humanism and politics, which could come about all the more easily since humanism was already politics and politics already humanism. Hans Castorp pricked up his ears at this and took pains to understand it, because he had reason to hope that he would now be able to grasp the nature of Magnus the brewer’s crass ignorance and learn in what way literature was something totally different from “beautiful characters.” And had the cousins ever heard of a Signore Brunetto, Settembrini asked, Brunetto Latini, who had become the town clerk of Florence around 1250, and had written a book on virtue and vice? He was the great master who had first given the Florentines their polish and taught them both how to speak and the fine art of guiding their republic by the rules of politics. “There you have it, gentlemen!” Settembrini cried. “There you have it!” And he spoke now about the “Word,” about the cult of the Word, about eloquence, which he called the triumph of humanity. Because the Word was the glory of humankind, and it alone gave dignity to life. Not just humanism, but humanity itself, man’s dignity and self-respect —they were inseparable from the Word, from literature. (“You see,” Hans Castorp said later to his cousin, “you see? Literature is a matter of beautiful words. I saw that right off. “) And politics were bound up with literature, too—or rather they were derived from the oneness of humanity and literature. For the beautiful Word gave birth to the beautiful deed. “Two hundred years ago,” Settembrini said, “you had a poet in your own country, a fine old confabulator, who set great store by beautiful handwriting, because he said it leads to a beautiful style. He should have taken that one step further and said that a beautiful style leads to beautiful actions.” Writing beautifully was almost synonymous with thinking beautifully, and from there it was not far to acting beautifully. All moral conduct and all moral perfection emanated from the spirit of literature, from the spirit of human dignity, which simultaneously was also the spirit of humanity and of politics. Yes, they were all one and the same force, one and the same idea, and could be summarized in a single word. And what was that word? Well, it consisted of familiar syllables, but the cousins had probably never truly grasped their meaning and majesty. And that word was—civilization! And as Settembrini released the word from his lips, he thrust his small yellow right hand into the air, as if proposing a toast."
"»Die Dinge«, sagte er mit falschem Lächeln, »liegen hier doch etwas anders als gewöhnlich. Der Ortsgeist, möchte ich es ausdrücken, ist nicht der konventionelle. Das Vorrecht hat der Kranke, ob Mann oder Frau. Die Vorschriften der Ritterlichkeit treten dagegen zurück. Sie sind vorübergehend unpäßlich, Mynheer Peeperkorn, – eine akute Unpäßlichkeit, eine Unpäßlichkeit von Aktualität. Ihre Reisebegleiterin ist vergleichsweise gesund. Da glaube ich ganz im Sinne von Madame zu handeln, wenn ich sie in ihrer Abwesenheit ein bißchen bei Ihnen vertrete – soweit hier von Vertretung die Rede sein kann, ha, ha: – statt umgekehrt Sie bei ihr zu vertreten und ihr meine Begleitung in den Ort hinunter anzubieten. Wie käme ich auch wohl dazu, Ihrer Reisebegleiterin meine Ritterdienste aufzudrängen? Dazu habe ich gar keinen Rechtstitel und kein Mandat. Ich darf sagen, daß ich viel Sinn für positive Rechtsverhältnisse habe. Kurzum, meine Situation, finde ich, ist korrekt, sie entspricht der allgemeinen Sachlage, sie entspricht namentlich meinen aufrichtigen Empfindungen für Ihre Person, Mynheer Peeperkorn, und somit glaube ich auf Ihre Frage – denn Sie {916}richteten wohl eine Frage an mich – eine befriedigende Antwort erteilt zu haben.«","'Things,' he said with a false smile, 'are a little different from usual here. The spirit of the place, I would like to put it, is not the conventional one. The sick person, male or female, has priority. The regulations of chivalry, on the other hand, take a back seat. You are temporarily indisposed, Mynheer Peeperkorn--an acute indisposition, an indisposition of actuality. Your travel companion is comparatively healthy. I think I'm acting in Madame's best interest when I stand in for her a little while she's absent - as far as there can be a question of standing in here, ha, ha: - instead of vice versa standing in for you and my companion in the offer place down. How dare I impose my knightly services on your traveling companion? I have no legal title and no mandate to do so. I may say that I have a good sense of positive legal relationships. In short, I think my situation is correct, it corresponds to the general state of affairs, it corresponds in particular to my sincere feelings for you, Mynheer Peeperkorn, and so I believe in answer to your question - for you {916}apparently put a question to me - to have given a satisfactory answer.""","He said, with a hollow smile: “Everything up here is out of the ordinary. The spirit of the place, if I may put it so, is not conventional. The sufferer, whether man or woman, is privileged. The laws of chivalry are thus forced rather into the background. You are for the moment indisposed, Mynheer Peeperkorn, an acute indisposition. Your companion is relatively well. I think I do as Madame would wish in representing her here beside you, in her absence—in so far as there can be any talk of representing her, ha ha!—instead of representing you with her and offering to attend her into the village. How indeed should I come to be playing the cavalier to Madame? I have no title to the position, no mandate, and I have, I must admit, a strong sense of mine and thine. In short, I find my position is correct, in face of the general situation, and also the very genuine feelings I entertain for you, Mynheer Peeperkorn. You asked me, I believe, a question, and I think what I have said should be a satisfactory answer to it.”","“Things up here,” he said with a forced smile, “are different from what is usual elsewhere. The spirit of the place, if I may put it that way, is not a conventional one. The patient has priority, whether man or woman. The rules of chivalry are of secondary importance. You are temporarily indisposed, Mynheer Peeperkorn—acutely indisposed, at this very moment. Your traveling companion is relatively healthy in comparison. And so I believe that I am acting as Madame would wish by serving as her representative here with you in her absence—to the extent one can speak of representing her, ha ha—instead of serving as your representative with her and offering to accompany her down into town. And why should I even think of forcing my chivalrous services upon your traveling companion? I have neither the right nor the authorization for that. I may say that I have a good sense of what is legitimate. In short, my situation is, I think, correct; it corresponds to the general state of affairs and in particular to my own sincere regard for your person, Mynheer Peeperkorn. And so in answer to your question—for you did ask a question of me— I believe I have given you a satisfactory answer.”"
"So machte er es zuweilen. Mit einer Schlauheit, die seiner Natur eigentlich fremd war, stellte er es so hin, als bedeute Fräulein Engelharts Schwärmerei für Frau Chauchat nicht das, was sie, wie er sehr wohl wußte, in Wirklichkeit bedeutete, sondern als sei diese Schwärmerei eine selbständige, drollige Tatsache, mit welcher er, der unabhängige Hans Castorp, die alte Jungfer aus kühlem und humoristischem Abstande necken konnte. Und da er sicher war, daß seine Helfershelferin diese dreiste Verdrehung gelten und sich gefallen lassen werde, so war nichts damit gewagt.","He did that sometimes. With a cunning that was really foreign to his nature, he made it seem as if Fraulein Engelhart's crush on Frau Chauchat did not mean what he knew very well it really meant, but as if this crush was an independent, comical one A fact with which he, the independent Hans Castorp, could tease the spinster from a cool and humorous distance. And since he was sure that his accomplice would accept this brazen misrepresentation and put up with it, nothing was dared.","This was the line he sometimes took. With a cunning otherwise foreign to his nature he would make out that the schoolmistress’s ravings over Madame Chauchat were not what he very well knew them to be, but an independent phenomenon, of a quaint and amusing kind; about which he, Hans Castorp, made free to tease the old spinster, feeling his own withers unwrung. He risked nothing by this attitude, being confident that his accomplice would agree to anything he said, no matter how wide of the mark.","That is how he worked it sometimes. With a cunning that was actually foreign to him, he pretended that Fräulein Engelhart’s enthusiasm for Frau Chauchat was not in reality what he very well knew it to be, but that her enthusiasm was some neutral, droll fact that he, Hans Castorp, as an uninvolved party standing off at a cool, amused distance, could use to tease the old maid. And since he was certain that his accomplice would accept this audacious distortion and go along with it , it was not a risky tactic at all."
"Die Dame hatte einen Ort in den Pyrenäen genannt. »Hübsche oder doch reizvolle Frau. Angenehme Stimme, angenehme Bewegungen. Aber freie Manieren, nachlässig«, sagte Frau Ziemßen. »Redet uns einfach an wie alte Freunde, fragt und erzählt, obgleich Joachim, wie ich höre, eigentlich nie ihre Bekanntschaft gemacht hat. Fremdartig.«","The lady had named a place in the Pyrenees. 'Pretty or at least attractive woman. Pleasant voice, pleasant movements. But free manners, careless,' said Frau Ziemssen. 'Just talk to us like old friends, ask and tell us, although I hear Joachim never actually met her. Alien.«","The lady had mentioned a place in the Pyrenees. A pretty, or at least a charming woman. Pleasant voice, pretty gestures. But free manners, slack, Frau Ziemssen thought. “She spoke to us as though we were old friends, told about herself, asked questions, though it seems Joachim had never actually known her. I thought it rather odd.” “That is the East—and the illness,” replied Hans Castorp.","The lady had mentioned some town in the Pyrenees. “A pretty woman, quite a charming lady. Pleasant voice, pretty gestures. But very free in her manners, careless,” Frau Ziemssen remarked. “Spoke to us as if we were old friends, asked a great many questions, went on and on, although Joachim tells me he never actually made her acquaintance. Curious.” “That comes from the Asiatic East and her illness,” Hans Castorp replied."
"Er hatte nichts gesagt; aber sein Haupt erschien so unzweifelhaft bedeutend, sein Mienen- und Gestenspiel war dermaßen entschieden, eindringlich, ausdrucksvoll gewesen, daß alle und auch der lauschende Hans Castorp höchst Wichtiges vernommen zu haben meinten oder, sofern ihnen das Ausbleiben sachlicher und zu Ende geführter Mitteilung bewußt geworden war, dergleichen doch nicht vermißten. Wir fragen uns, wie einem Tauben zumute gewesen wäre. Vielleicht hätte er sich gegrämt, weil er den Fehlschluß vom Ausdruck aufs Ausgedrückte gemacht und sich eingebildet hätte, durch sein Gebrechen geistig zu kurz zu kommen. Solche Leute neigen zu Mißtrauen und Bitterkeit. Ein junger Chinese dagegen, am anderen Tischende, der des Deutschen noch wenig mächtig war und nicht verstanden, aber gehört und gesehen hatte, bekundete seine erfreute Befriedigung durch den Ruf: »Very well!« – und applaudierte sogar.","He had said nothing; but his head seemed so undoubtedly important, his facial expressions and gestures were so determined, urgent, expressive that everyone, including Hans Castorp, who was listening, thought they had heard something extremely important or, if they became aware of the lack of factual and completed information was, but did not miss such things. We wonder how a deaf man would have felt. Perhaps he would have grieved because he had made the mistake of jumping from expression to what was expressed and had imagined that his infirmity had left him mentally short-changed. Such people are prone to distrust and bitterness. On the other hand, a young Chinese at the other end of the table, who still had little command of German and did not understand it, but had heard and seen it, expressed his delighted satisfaction by shouting: ""Very well!"" - and even applauded.","He had said absolutely nothing. But look, manner, and gestures were so peremptory, perfervid, pregnant, that all, even Hans Castorp, were convinced they had heard something of high moment; or, if aware of the total lack of matter and sequence in the speech, certainly never missed it. We wonder how it might appear to a deaf person. Perhaps the impressiveness of what he saw would make him draw an altogether wrong conclusion as to what he might have heard but for his infirmity— and cause him to suffer accordingly. Such people incline to mistrust and bitterness. On the other hand, a young Chinaman at the other end of the table, who possessed too little of the language to understand what had been said, but had yet assiduously listened and looked, clapped his hands and called out: “ Très bien, très bien.”","He had said nothing; but his head had looked so incontrovertibly imposing, the play of features and gestures had been so definitive, compelling, and expressive that all of them, including eavesdropping Hans Castorp, believed that they had heard something very important or, to the extent that they were aware of the lack of anything communicated and of any thought completed, they simply did not miss it. We might ask ourselves how a deaf person would have felt. Drawing a false conclusion from the expression he saw as to the content of what was expressed, he might have fretted that because of his handicap he had missed something of intellectual substance. Such people tend to be suspicious and bitter. A young Chinese fellow, however, at the other end of the table, whose knowledge of German was scant, had not understood, but had both heard and seen, and announced his own happy satisfaction by calling out “Très bien!”—and even applauded."
"»In der Tat –«, sagte Peeperkorn und verbarg ein Lächeln, indem er mit der hohlen Hand über Mund und Kinn strich, als bestünde Gefahr, daß Frau Chauchat ihn lächeln sähe. Auch Hans Castorp lächelte diskret, und dann nickten sie beide im Einverständnis vor sich hin.","'Indeed -' said Peeperkorn, hiding a smile by cupping his hand over his mouth and chin, as if in danger of Mrs. Chauchat seeing him smile. Hans Castorp also smiled discreetly, and then they both nodded in agreement.","“True enough,” Peeperkorn said, and ran his hand over mouth and chin to conceal a smile, as though he were afraid Madame Chauchat might see it. Hans Castorp too smiled discreetly—and then they both nodded, in mutual understanding.","“Indeed—” Peeperkorn said, hiding a smile by brushing his cupped hand over mouth and chin, as if afraid Frau Chauchat might see him smiling. Even Hans Castorp smiled discreetly, and then they both nodded awhile in agreement. “One should not begrudge me my little bit of revenge,” Hans Castorp went on."
"»Ja, populär gesprochen. Etwas gelehrter gesprochen ist sie {770}Läuterung, Stoffverwandlung und Stoffveredlung, Transsubstantiation, und zwar zum Höheren, Steigerung also, – der lapis philosophorum, das mann-weibliche Produkt aus Sulfur und Merkur, die res bina, die zweigeschlechtige prima materia war nichts weiter, nichts Geringeres als das Prinzip der Steigerung, der Hinauftreibung durch äußere Einwirkungen, – magische Pädagogik, wenn Sie wollen.«","“Yes, popularly speaking. Speaking somewhat more learnedly, it is {770}purification, material transformation and material ennoblement, transubstantiation, namely to the higher, i.e. increase, - the lapis philosophorum, the male-female product of sulfur and mercury, the res bina, the two-sexed prima materia was nothing more , nothing less than the principle of intensification, of upward propulsion through external influences - magical pedagogy, if you will.«","“In the popular mind, yes. More informedly put, it was purification, refinement, metamorphosis, transubstantiation, into a higher state, of course; the lapis philosophorum, the male-female product of suiphur and mercury, the res bina, the double-sexed prima materia, was no more, and no less, than the principle of levitation, of the upward impulse due to the working of influences from without. Instruction in magic, if you like.”","“Yes, that’s the popular understanding. Put more academically, it is the purification, mutation, and refinement of matter, its transubstantiation to something higher, its enhancement, as it were. The lapis philosophorum, which is the male-female product of sulfur and mercury—the res bina, the bisexual prima materia—was nothing more and nothing less than the principle of that enhancement, the application of external influences to force matter upward: magical pedagogy if you will.”"
"Der Hofrat kam, von Schwester Berta benachrichtigt. Noch {812}vor einer halben Stunde war er dagewesen und hatte Kampfer gespritzt; nur eben den Augenblick des knappen Übertrittes hatte er verpaßt. »Tja, der hat es hinter sich«, sagte er schlicht, indem er sich mit seinem Hörrohr von Joachims stiller Brust aufrichtete. Und er drückte den beiden Anverwandten die Hände, indem er ihnen zunickte. Danach stand er noch eine Weile mit ihnen zusammen am Bett, Joachims unbewegliches, kriegerbärtiges Antlitz betrachtend. »Toller Junge, toller Kerl«, sagte er über die Schulter, indem er mit dem Kopf auf den Ruhenden wies. »Hat es zwingen wollen, wissen Sie, – natürlich war alles Zwang und Gewaltsamkeit mit seinem Dienst da unten, – febril hat er Dienst gemacht auf Biegen und Brechen. Feld der Ehre, verstehen Sie, – ist uns aufs Feld der Ehre echappiert, der Durchgänger. Aber die Ehre, das war der Tod für ihn, und der Tod – Sie könnens nach Belieben auch umdrehen, – er hat nun jedenfalls ›Habe die Ehre!‹ gesagt. Toller Bengel das, toller Kerl.« Und er ging ab, lang und gebückt, mit heraustretendem Nacken.","The privy councilor came, notified by Sister Berta. {812}Half an hour ago he had been there and injected camphor; he had just missed the moment of the narrow transition. ""Well, he's done with it,"" he said simply, straightening himself up from Joachim's still breast with his ear trumpet. And he shook hands with the two relatives, nodding to them. After that he stood with them for a while by the bed, contemplating Joachim's immobile, warrior-bearded face. ""Great boy, great fellow,"" he said over his shoulder, nodding at the reclining man. 'Wanted to force it, you know - of course everything was compulsion and violence with his service down there - February he did service by hook or by crook. Field of Honor, you understand - escaped us to the Field of Honor, the passer-by. But the honor, that was death for him, and death - you can also turn it around if you like - he said 'I have the honour!' anyway. Great brat that, great fellow.' And he walked off, long and stooped, neck sticking out.","The Hofrat came, summoned by Sister Berta. He had been there a half-hour earlier, and given a camphor injection; had scarcely been absent for more than the moment of the “short crossing.” “Ay,” said he simply, “he has it behind him now,” and lifted the stethoscope from Joachim’s breast. And he pressed both their hands, nodding his head; standing with them awhile by the bed, and looking into Joachim’s moveless visage, with the warrior beard. “Crazy young one,” he said: jerking his head towards the recumbent form. “Crazy chap. Would force it, you know—of course, that’s the way of the service down there, all force, all compulsion—he joined the service while he was febrile, he took a life-and-death chance. Field of honour, you know—slipped away from us, and now he’s dead on the field. Honour was the death of him, and death—well, you might put it the other way round too. At any rate, he’s gone—‘had the honour to take his leave.’ A madman, a crazy chap.” And he left, tall and stooped, his neck-bone very prominent.","The director came after being notified by Sister Berta. He had been there only a half hour before to give an injection of camphor, had just missed the moment of swift passing. “Yes, well, he has it behind him,” he said simply, rising back up with his stethoscope from Joachim’s quiet breast. And then he extended a hand to each relative and added a little nod. He stood for a while together with them beside the bed, gazing at Joachim’s impassive face with its warrior’s beard. “Crazy lad, crazy fellow,” he said thrusting his head back over one shoulder at the body lying there. “Wanted to force it, you see—because of course all his duties down below were force and violence—did his duty with a fever, come hell or high water. The field of honor, you see—hightailed it for the field of honor, kicked over the traces. But honor was the death of him, or—if you turn it the other way around—death did him the honor. Crazy kid he was, crazy fellow.” And he left, taking long strides and bent forward so that his neck vertebrae protruded."

"»Sonnwendfeier!« sagte Hans Castorp, »Sommersonnenwende! Bergfeuer und Ringelreihn rund um die lodernde Flamme herum mit angefaßten Händen! Ich habe es nie gesehen, aber {561}ich höre, so wird es gemacht von urwüchsigen Menschen, so feiern sie die erste Sommernacht, mit der der Herbst beginnt, die Mittagsstunde und Scheitelhöhe des Jahres, von wo es abwärts geht, – sie tanzen und drehen sich und jauchzen. Worüber jauchzen sie in ihrer Urwüchsigkeit, – kannst du dir das begreiflich machen? Worüber sind sie so ausgelassen lustig? Weil es nun abwärts geht ins Dunkel, oder vielleicht, weil es bisher aufwärts ging und nun die Wende gekommen ist, der unhaltbare Wendepunkt, Mittsommernacht, die volle Höhe, mit Wehmut im Übermut? Ich sage es, wie es ist, mit den Worten, die mir dafür einfallen. Es ist melancholischer Übermut und übermütige Melancholie, weshalb die Urwüchsigen jauchzen und um die Flamme tanzen, sie tun es aus positiver Verzweiflung, wenn du so sagen willst, zu Ehren der Eulenspiegelei des Kreises und der Ewigkeit ohne Richtungsdauer, in der alles wiederkehrt.«","""Solstice celebration!"" said Hans Castorp, ""Summer solstice! Mountain fires and rows of rings around the blazing flame with clasped hands! I've never seen it, but {561}I hear that's how primitive people do it, that's how they celebrate the first summer night, with which autumn begins, the midday hour and peak of the year, from where it goes down - they dance and spin and shout. About what do they rejoice in their originality - can you make that understandable to you? What are they so hilariously funny about? Because things are now going down into the dark, or maybe because things have been going up so far and now the turning point has come, the untenable turning point, midsummer night, the full height, with melancholy in high spirits? I say it like it is, in whatever words I can think of. It is melancholy high spirits and high-spirited melancholy that makes the primal ones cheer and dance around the flame, they do it out of positive desperation, if you will say so, in honor of the circle’s Eulenspiegelei and the directional eternity in which everything returns.”","“The feast of the solstice—midsummer night! Fires on the mountain-top, and ring-around-a-rosy about the leaping flames! I have never seen it; but they say our rude forefathers used thus to celebrate the first summer night, the night with which autumn begins, the very midday and zenith of the year, the point from which it goes downhill again: they danced and whirled and shouted and exulted—and why, really, all that primitive exultation? Can you make it out? What were they so jolly about? Was it because from then on the world went down into the dark—or perhaps because it had up till then gone uphill, and now the turning-point was reached, the fleeting moment of midsummer night and midsummer madness, the meeting-place of tears and laughter? I express it as it is, in the words that come to me. Tragic joy, triumphant sadness that was what made our ancestors leap and exult around the leaping flames: they did so as an act of homage to the madness of the circle, to an eternity without duration, in which everything recurs—in sheer despair, if you like.”","“Midsummer Night!” Hans Castorp said. “Midsummer Night celebrations, with fires and dances around the leaping flames, everyone joining hands. I’ve never seen it, but I’ve heard that’s how primitive tribes do it, celebrating the first night of summer, which is actually the beginning of autumn—the year’s high noon, its zenith, and it’s all downhill from there. They dance and whirl and cheer. And what are these primitives cheering about—can you explain that to me? Why are they so boisterous and merry? Because they are now headed back down into the dark, maybe? Or is it because things have gone uphill until now, and the turning point has come, the slippery turning point, Midsummer Night? Is it melancholy mirth at the high-point? I’m just describing it as I see it, in the words that come to mind. Melancholy mirth and mirthful melancholy— that’s the reason why those primitives are cheering and dancing around the flames. They do it out of constructive despair, if you want to put it that way, in honor of the practical joke of the circle, of eternity that has no permanent direction, but in which everything keeps coming back.”"
"Gut, gut, also Dichter. Die Verlegenheit wuchs, – eine sonderbare Verlegenheit, die den Kundgebungen unkontrollierter Gegenden des eigenen Inneren galt, aber durch die gleisnerisch-halbdingliche Gegebenheit dieser Kundgebungen doch auch wieder die Richtung ins Außen-Wirkliche erhielt. Ob Holger sich wohl und glücklich fühlte in seinem Zustande, wollte man wissen. – Das Glas schob träumerischerweise das Wort »Gelassen«. Ach so, »gelassen« also. Nun ja, man wäre von selbst nicht darauf gekommen, aber da denn das Glas so buchstabierte, fand man es wahrscheinlich und gut gesagt. – Und wie lange Holger sich denn schon in seinem gelassenen Zustande befinde? – Jetzt kam wieder etwas, worauf niemand verfallen wäre, etwas träumerisch sich selbst Gebendes. Es lautete: »Eilende Weile«. – Sehr gut! Es hätte auch »Weilende Eile« lauten können, es war ein bauchrednerischer Dichterspruch von außen, Hans Castorp namentlich fand ihn vorzüglich. Eine eilende Weile war Holgers Zeitelement, natürlich, er mußte die Frager spruchweise abfertigen, mit irdischen Worten und Maßgenauigkeiten mochte er freilich zu operieren verlernt haben. – Was wollte man also noch von ihm erfahren? Die Levi gestand ihre Neugier, zu wissen, wie Holger aussähe, beziehungsweise einst ausgesehen habe. Ob er ein schöner Jüngling sei? – Sie solle ihn selber fragen, ordnete Herr Albin an, der diesen Wissenswunsch unter seiner Würde fand. So fragte sie per du, ob spirit Holger wohl blonde Locken habe.","Good, good, so poet. The embarrassment grew - a strange embarrassment, which applied to the manifestations of uncontrolled regions of one's own inner being, but which, through the phony, half-objective givenness of these manifestations, was also directed towards external reality. They wanted to know whether Holger felt well and happy in his condition. - The glass dreamily pushed the word »calm«. Ah, so ""relaxed"". Well, you wouldn't have guessed it yourself, but since the glass spelled it that way, you thought it was probable and well said. - And how long has Holger been in his relaxed state? – Now something came up again that no one would have thought of, something dreamily self-giving. It read: ""Hasten while."" - Very well! It could also have been ""Weinde Eile,"" it was a ventriloquist poetic saying from the outside, Hans Castorp in particular thought it was excellent. A rushed while was Holger's element of time, of course, he had to deal with the questioner one by one, although he might have forgotten how to use earthly words and precise measurements. – So what else did you want to learn from him? Levi confessed her curiosity to know what Holger looked like or used to look like. Was he a handsome youth? - You should ask him yourself, ordered Mr. Albin, who found this desire for knowledge beneath his dignity. So she asked on a first-name basis whether spirit Holger had blond curls.","Good, then, a poet. The constraint increased. It was a constraint that in reality had to do with manifestations on the part of uncharted regions of their own inner, their subjective selves, but which, because of the illusory, half-actual conditions of these manifestations, referred itself to the objective and external. Did Holger feel at home, and content, in his present state? Dreamily, the glass spelled out the word tranquil. Ah, tranquil. It was not a word one would have hit upon oneself, but after the glass spelled it out, they found it well chosen and probable. And how long had Holger been in this tranquil state? The answer to this was again something one would never have thought of, and dreamily answered; it was “A hastening while.” Very good. As a piece of ventriloquistic poesy from the Beyond, Hans Castorp, in particular, found it capital. A “hastening while” was the time-element Holger lived in: and of course he had to answer as it were in parables, having very likely forgotten how to use earthly terminology and standards of exact measurement. Fräulein Levi confessed her curiosity to know how he looked, or had looked, more or less. Had he been a handsome youth? Herr Albin said she might ask him herself, he found the request beneath his dignity. So she asked if the spirit had fair hair.","Fine, fine, a poet then. The embarrassment grew—an odd embarrassment that was intended for manifestations in the uncontrolled regions of their own interiors, but, given the dissembling, semi-real quality of those manifestations, was directed instead to external reality. Someone wondered if Holger felt happy and content in his state. The glass dreamily tapped out the word “serene.” Ah yes, so he felt “serene.” Well, it was not a term they would have come up with on their own, but once the glass had spelled it out, they found it probable and nicely put. And how long had Holger been in this serene state? And now came something else no one would have hit upon, something dreamily self-revealing. It was: “Hastening while.” Very good! It could just as easily have been “whiling haste,” it was a bit of poetic ventriloquism from the beyond; Hans Castorp thought it splendid. For Holger, the element of time was a “hastening while”—but of course, he would have to deal with his questioners in a gnomic style, would surely have forgotten how to function with earthly words and exact measurements. And so what else did they want to know from him?Fräulein Levi admitted she was curious to know what Holger looked like, or if that didn’t apply, had looked like. Had he been a handsome lad? She should ask him herself, demanded Herr Albin, who found the inquiry beneath his dignity. And so she asked him, using informal pronouns, if he had curly blond hair?"
"Übrigens war sein Erkältungsfieber reine Einbildung gewesen. Der objektive Befund war der gewöhnliche, – eben der, welcher, zusammen mit den Ergebnissen der hofrätlichen Untersuchungen, den ehrliebenden Joachim hier zu einer kleinen Nachkur festhielt, bevor er wieder zur Fahne würde eilen können. Der Oktobertermin war sang- und klanglos vorübergegangen. Niemand verlor ein Wort darüber, weder der Hofrat, noch die Vettern gegeneinander: still und mit niedergeschlagenen Augen gingen sie darüber hinweg. Nach dem, was Behrens bei der Monatsuntersuchung dem seelenkundigen Famulus in die Feder diktierte und was die photographische Platte zeigte, war allzu klar, daß höchstens von einer ganz wilden Abreise hätte die Rede sein können, während es doch {794}diesmal galt, im Dienste hier oben mit eiserner Selbstzucht auszuharren, bis zum Flachlanddienste, zur Eideserfüllung dort unten endgültige Wetterfestigkeit gewonnen wäre.","By the way, his cold fever had been pure imagination. The objective findings were the usual ones - exactly the ones which, together with the results of the court councillor's investigations, detained the honor-loving Joachim here for a short follow-up cure before he could hurry back to the flag. The October date had passed without a hitch. Nobody said a word about it, neither the Hofrat nor the cousins against each other: they passed it over silently and with downcast eyes. After what Behrens dictated to the psychic Famulus during the monthly examination and what the photographic plate showed, it was all too clear that at most one could have spoken of a wild departure, whereas this time {794} it was on duty to persevere up here with iron self-discipline, until the lowland service, to fulfill the oath down there, final weatherproofness would be won.","His fever proved imaginary—at least the thermometer gave no more than the usual result, that, namely, which together with the results of the Hofrat’s examinations kept our ambitious Joachim here for his little after-cure, instead of letting him return to the colours. The October terminus had slipped by and no man named it, neither the Hofrat nor the cousins between themselves. They let it pass, in silence, with downcast eyes. From the diagnosis which Behrens dictated at the monthly examinations to the psychically expert assistant sitting at his table, and from the results shown by the photographic plate, it was all too clear that though there had once been a departure, of which the best that could be said was that it had been decidedly risky, this time there was nothing for it but iron self-discipline, until such a day as entire immunity might be won, for the fulfilment of the oath and the service of the flat-land.","He had, by the way, only imagined that his fever came from his cold—the objective findings were as usual. Along with the results of the director’s examination, this meant that honor-loving Joachim would have to stay with his little extra therapy before he could rush off to the colors again. The October deadline passed quietly. No one mentioned it—not the director and not the cousins to one another; they simply ignored it in silence with downcast eyes. To judge from what the X-ray plate showed and what Behrens dictated to his psychoanalytic aide-de-camp during Joachim’s monthly checkup, it was only too clear that there could be no question of a departure, unless it was fraudulent, because this time it was a matter of Joachim’s remaining on duty up here with iron self-discipline, until he had been made fully weatherproof—only then could he fulfill his oath by service in the flatlands."
"»Herr Settembrini, – Verzeihung. Nein, also Sie irren. Ich bin gar nicht krank.

I'm just visiting my cousin Ziemssen for a couple of weeks, and I want to take this opportunity to relax a little -""","“Herr Settembrini—I beg your pardon. No, you are mistaken. Really I am not ill. I have only come on a visit to my cousin Ziemssen for a few weeks, and shall take advantage of the opportunity to get a good rest—”","“Herr Settembrini—beg your pardon. No, you are mistaken. I am not sick at all. I’m merely visiting my cousin Ziemssen for a few weeks and using the occasion for a little relaxation myself.”"
"Der Hofrat also spiegelte, reflektierte und äugte tief und lange in Joachims Hals hinunter, worauf der Patient sich auf Hans Castorps besonderen Wunsch sogleich in dessen Balkonloge einfand, um Bericht zu erstatten. Es sei recht lästig und kitzlich gewesen, teilte er halb flüsternd mit, da gerade Hauptliegekur und Schweigegebot waltete, und schließlich habe Behrens allerlei von einem Reizungszustand gekohlt und gesagt, es müßten jeden Tag Pinselungen vorgenommen werden, gleich {796}morgen wolle er zu ätzen anfangen, er müsse nur erst das Medikament bereitstellen. Also Reizungszustand und Ätzungen. Hans Castorp, den Kopf voller Gedankenverbindungen, die weit liefen und sich auf ganz fernstehende Personen, wie den hinkenden Concierge und jene Dame erstreckten, die sich die ganze Woche ihr Ohr gehalten und dennoch durchaus beruhigt hatte sein können, hatte noch Fragen auf den Lippen, brachte sie aber nicht darüber, sondern beschloß, sie dem Hofrat unter vier Augen vorzulegen und beschränkte sich gegen Joachim auf den Ausdruck seiner Genugtuung, daß das Ärgernis nun der Kontrolle unterstehe und der Hofrat die Sache in die Hand genommen habe. Der sei ein Hauptkerl und werde schon Remedur schaffen. Worauf Joachim nickte, ohne den anderen anzusehen, sich umwandte und in seine Loge hinüberging.","The privy councilor mirrored, reflected, and peered long and deep into Joachim's throat, whereupon the patient, at Hans Castorp's special request, immediately went to his balcony box to report back. It was really annoying and ticklish, he said half in a whisper, since the main rest cure and the order to remain silent were in effect, and finally Behrens had talked about all sorts of irritation and said that brushing had to be done every day, he wanted to etch tomorrow start, he only has to provide the medicine first. So irritation and etching. Hans Castorp, his head full of thought connections that ran far and extended to people who were very far away, such as the concierge who was limping and that lady who had been holding her ear all week and could still be quite reassured, still had questions on his lips, But he didn't bring it up, but decided to present it privately to the Hofrat and limited himself to the expression of his satisfaction to Joachim that the annoyance was now under control and that the Hofrat had taken matters into his own hands. He's a top guy and will manage Remedur. Whereupon Joachim nodded without looking at the other, turned and went over to his box.","The Hofrat, then, mirrored, reflected, peered deep into Joachim’s throat, and when he had done, Joachim went straight to his cousin’s balcony to give him the result. He said, half whispering, as it was the hour for the afternoon cure, that it had been bothersome, and tickled a good deal. Behrens had rambled on about an inflamed condition, and said the throat must be painted every day; they were to begin tomorrow, as the medicament had to be put up. An inflamed condition, then, and it was to be painted. Hans Castorp, his head full of far-reaching associations, having to do for instance with the lame concierge, and that lady who had gone about for a week holding her ear, and need not have troubled herself, would have liked to put more questions. But he refrained, inwardly resolving to see the Hofrat privately, and said to Joachim he was glad the trouble was being treated, and that the Hofrat had taken it personally in hand. He was top-hole in his line, he would soon put it right. Joachim nodded without looking at him, turned and went into his balcony.","And so the director scoped, mirrored, and gazed deep and long down Joachim’s throat; immediately afterward, the patient appeared on Hans Castorp’s balcony, as explicitly requested, to give a report. It had been a ticklish nuisance, he confided in a half-whisper, since this was the main rest cure and silence was the rule. All Behrens had done was babble on about inflammation of this and that, had said that the throat would have to be painted every day and that he would start the procedure the next morning, since he first had to prepare the cauterant. So, then, inflammation, cauterization. Hans Castorp’s head was full of thoughts and associations that extended as far as people like the limping concierge and the woman who had kept one hand pressed to her ear for a whole week and was told nevertheless to set her mind at ease; there were questions on the tip of his tongue, but he could not get them out and decided instead to ask them of the director in private. His comments to Joachim were limited to an expression of satisfaction that the annoyance was under control now that the director had taken a hand in the matter. Behrens was a brick of a fellow and would come up with a cure. To which Joachim nodded without looking at his cousin, turned, and walked across to his own balcony."
"»›Mazurka‹ ist ausgezeichnet!« rief er. »Marusja heißt sie, wenn du erlaubst, – das ist soviel wie Marie. Ja, sie ist wirklich zu ausgelassen«, sagte er. »Und dabei hätte sie allen Grund, gesetzter zu sein, denn sie ist gar nicht wenig krank.«","""'Mazurka' is excellent!"" he exclaimed. 'Marusja is her name, if you allow me - that's as much as Marie. Yes, she's really too boisterous,' he said. ""And she has every reason to be calmer, for she is not a little ill.""","“ ‘Mazurka’ is capital,” he said. “Her name is Marusja, with your kind permission—it is the same as Marie. Yes, she really is too undisciplined, and after all, she has every reason to be serious,” he said, “for her case is by no means light.”","“ ‘Mazurka’—that’s splendid!” he cried. “Her name’s Marusya, if you please—it’s about the same as our Marie. Yes, she really is too enthusiastic,” he said. “When she has every reason to be more sedate, because she’s more than a little ill.”"
"Hans Castorp nahm diese Erzählung mit einer angeregten Zerstreutheit auf. Mit zurückgezogenen Ärmeln vor dem geräumigen Waschbecken stehend, dessen Nickelhähne im elektrischen Lichte blitzten, warf er kaum einen flüchtigen Blick zu der weißmetallenen, reinlich bedeckten Bettstatt hinüber.","Hans Castorp received this story with excited distraction. Standing with his sleeves drawn back in front of the spacious washbasin, whose nickel taps gleamed in the electric light, he scarcely glanced at the white metal, neatly covered bedstead.","Hans Castorp took in this information with a sprightly, yet half-distraught air. He was standing with his sleeves pushed back before the roomy wash-hand-basin, the taps of which shone in the electric light, and gave hardly a glance at the white metal bed with its fresh coverlet.","Hans Castorp was listening to this narrative with edgy bemusement. He had rolled up his sleeves and was standing now at the large washbasin, its nickel taps sparkling under the electric light, but he cast no more than a fleeting glance at the bed’s white metal frame and fresh sheets."
"»Danke, Professor Naphta. Aufrichtig verbunden für Wink und Warnung. Wissen Sie was?

Sincerely obliged for wink and warning. You know what? I'll just go up one floor, as far as there can be talk of a floor up there, and feel the hooded federal brother a little on the tooth. An apprentice must be inquisitive and fearless... Cautious, of course... Care must be taken with emissaries, of course.”","Aloud he said: “Thank you, Professor Naphta. I am genuinely grateful for your advice and warning. What do you think? Suppose I go a storey higher—in so far as one can speak of a storey—and touch up our disguised lodge-brother a bit? The learner must be of dauntless courage, athirst for knowledge. But cautious too, of course. It’s well to take precautions when one deals with emissaries.”","My thanks, Professor Naphta. I’m much obliged to you for your reminder and warning. Do you know what? I’m going to go up one floor now, if you can call it a floor, and check the pulse of our lodge-brother in disguise.

"Darauf mußte es »lichtsuchende Jugend« mit ansehen, wie Naphta den Argumenten, einem nach dem anderen, den Hals umdrehte. Er machte sich lustig über die Blutscheu und die Lebensverehrung des Menschenfreundes, behauptete, daß diese Verehrung des Einzellebens nur den allerplattesten bürgerlichen Regenschirmzeitläuften zugehöre, daß aber unter leidlich leidenschaftlichen Umständen, sobald eine einzige Idee, die über die der »Sicherheit« hinausgehe, irgend etwas Überpersönliches, Überindividuelles also, im Spiele sei – und das sei der allein menschenwürdige, im höheren Sinne folglich der {695}normale Zustand – allezeit das Einzelleben nicht nur dem höheren Gedanken ohne Federlesen geopfert, sondern auch freiwillig, vom Individuum aus, unbedenklich in die Schanze geschlagen werden würde. Die Philanthropie seines Herrn Widersachers, sagte er, arbeite darauf hin, dem Leben alle schweren und todernsten Akzente zu nehmen; auf die Kastration des Lebens gehe sie aus, auch mit dem Determinismus ihrer sogenannten Wissenschaft. Aber die Wahrheit sei, daß der Begriff der Schuld durch den Determinismus nicht nur nicht abgeschafft werde, sondern sogar durch ihn noch an Schwere und Schaudern gewönne.","Then ""light-seeking youth"" watched as Naphta wringed the arguments' necks, one by one. He made fun of the philanthropist's fear of blood and his love of life, maintained that this reverence for the individual life belonged only to the most trite bourgeois umbrella ages, but that under tolerably passionate circumstances, as soon as a single idea that went beyond that of ""security"" anything What is supra-personal, supra-individual, is in play - and that is the only condition worthy of human beings, consequently the {695}normal condition in a higher sense - the individual life is always not only sacrificed to the higher thought without fuss, but also voluntarily, from the individual's point of view, without hesitation in the jump would be beaten. The philanthropy of his master adversary, he said, tended to rid life of all the heavy and deadly serious accents; it aims at the castration of life, also with the determinism of its so-called science. But the truth is that not only does determinism not abolish the concept of guilt, but it actually makes it heavier and more dreadful.","On top of which “light-seeking youth” had to stand by while Naphta neatly wrung the neck of all these arguments, one after the other. He derided the humanist’s reluctance to shed blood, and his reverence for human life. He said that the latter was characteristic of our intensely bourgeois age, our policy of molly-coddle. Even so, its inconsistency was apparent. For let an idea arise that went beyond considerations of personal safety and well-being—and such ideas were the only ones worthy of human beings, and thus in a higher sense were the normal field of human activity—and the individual would, even under average emotional stress, be sacrificed without scruple to the higher claim. Nay, more: the individual, of his own free will, would expose himself without a thought. The philanthropy of his honoured opponent would eliminate from life all its stern and mortal traits; it would castrate life, as would the determinism of its so-called science. But determinism would never succeed in doing away with the conception of guilt.","Whereupon “youth in search of light” was forced to watch as Naphta took each argument, one after the other, and wrung its neck. He ridiculed the philanthropist’s reluctance to shed blood, his reverence for life, claimed that such a reverence for life belonged to only the most banal rubbers-and-umbrellas bourgeois periods, but that the moment history took a more passionate turn, the moment a single idea, something that transcended mere “security,” was at work, something suprapersonal, something greater than the individual—and since that alone was a state worthy of mankind, it was, on a higher plane, the normal state of affairs—at that moment, then, individual life would always be sacrificed without further ado to that higher idea, and not only that, but individuals would also unhesitatingly and gladly risk their own lives for it. His good adversary’s philanthropy, he said, was aimed at robbing life of all its difficult and deadly serious aspects; its goal was the castration of life, and the same went for the determinism of its so-called science. The truth was, however, that determinism could never abolish the concept of guilt—indeed it could only add to its terrible gravity."
"»Ein Symbol alchimistischer Transmutation,« fuhr Naphta fort, »war vor allem die Gruft.«","""A symbol of alchemical transmutation,"" continued Naphta, ""was above all the tomb.""","“The primary symbol of alchemic transmutation,” Naphta said, “was par excellence the sepulchre.”","“The primary symbol of alchemistic transmutation,” Naphta went on, “was the crypt.”"
"Joachim war größer und breiter als er, ein Bild der Jugendkraft und wie für die Uniform geschaffen. Er war von dem sehr braunen Typus, den seine blonde Heimat nicht selten hervorbringt, und seine ohnehin dunkle Gesichtshaut war durch Verbrennung beinahe bronzefarben geworden. Mit seinen großen schwarzen Augen und dem dunklen Schnurrbärtchen über dem vollen, gut geschnittenen Munde wäre er geradezu schön gewesen, wenn er nicht abstehende Ohren gehabt hätte. Sie waren sein einziger Kummer und Lebensschmerz gewesen bis zu einem gewissen Zeitpunkt. Jetzt hatte er andere Sorgen. Hans Castorp fuhr fort:","Joachim was taller and broader than he was, a picture of youthful strength and made for the uniform. He was of the very brown type that his fair-haired homeland often produces, and his already dark complexion was almost bronzed from burns. With his large black eyes and dark mustache over his full, well-proportioned mouth, he would have been downright handsome if he hadn't had protruding ears. They had been his only sorrow and pain in life up to a point. Now he had other worries. Hans Castorp continued:","Joachim was taller and broader than he, a picture of youthful vigour, and made for a uniform. He was of the very dark type which his blond-peopled country not seldom produces, and his already nut-brown skin was tanned almost to bronze. With his large, black eyes and small, dark moustache over the full, well-shaped mouth, he would have been distinctly handsome if his ears had not stood out. Up to a certain period they had been his only trouble in life. Now, however, he had others. Hans Castorp went on: “You’re coming back down with me, aren’t you?","Joachim was taller than he, with broader shoulders, the picture of youthful vigor, a man made for a uniform. He was very dark-haired, a type not all that uncommon in his blond hometown, and his naturally dark complexion was now tanned almost bronze. With his large black eyes and dark little moustache above full, finely chiseled lips, he would have been downright handsome, if his ears had not stood out so badly. For most of his life, they had been his one great sorrow, his only care. Now he had other worries. “You will be coming back down with me, won’t you?” Hans Castorp went on."

"»So! – Na?« machte der Hofrat. Er fragte kopfnickend, mit jemandes Miene, der eine sehr lobende Antwort erwartet und in die Frage zugleich die Bestätigung des zu erwartenden Lobes aus eigener Erfahrung legt.","""So! - Well?' asked the Hofrat. He asked, nodding his head, with the air of someone who expects a very laudable answer and at the same time puts into the question the confirmation of the praise to be expected from his own experience.","“Ah? Well?” the Hofrat said. His manner was as one expecting from his own experience a very favouring reply, and expressing his agreement in anticipation by the way he puts the question.","“So! And—?” the director said, nodding as he asked, with the expression on his face of someone expecting a favorable reaction, the tone of the question implying he was awaiting praise that corroborated his own experience."
"In der Rhetorischen Klasse gab Leo den Wunsch zu erkennen, Theologie zu studieren, um, wenn er irgend würdig befunden werde, dereinst dem Orden anzugehören. Dies hatte zur Folge, daß man seinen Freiplatz aus dem »Zweiten Pensionat«, dessen Kosten und Lebenshaltung bescheidener waren, in das »Erste« verlegte. Bei Tische wurde ihm nun von Dienern serviert, und sein Schlafabteil stieß einerseits an das eines schlesischen Grafen von Harbuval und Chamaré, andererseits an das eines Marquis di Rangoni-Santacroce aus Modena. Er absolvierte glänzend und vertauschte, getreu seinem Entschluß, das Zöglingsleben des Pädagogiums mit dem des Noviziathauses im benachbarten Tisis, einem Leben dienender Demut, schweigender Unterordnung und religiösen Trainings, dem er geistige Lüste im Sinne früher fanatischer Konzeptionen abgewann.","In the rhetorical class, Leo indicated a desire to study theology so that, if found worthy, he might one day belong to the Order. As a result, one moved his free place from the ""second boarding school,"" whose costs and standard of living were more modest, to the ""first."" He was now served by servants at table, and his sleeping quarters adjoined that of a Silesian Count of Harbuval and Chamaré on the one hand, and that of a Marquis di Rangoni-Santacroce from Modena on the other. He did brilliantly and, true to his decision, exchanged the life of a pupil at the pedagogic school for that of the novitiate house in neighboring Tisis, a life of serving humility, silent submission and religious training, from which he wrested spiritual lusts in the sense of earlier fanatical conceptions.","In class Leo expressed the desire to study theology, in order to prepare himself for membership in the Society, in case he should be found worthy. In consequence, his place was changed from the “second school,” where the food and living conditions were more modest, to the first, where he was served by waiters at table, and had a cubicle between a Silesian nobleman, the Count of Harbuval and Chamaré, and the young Marquis di Rangoni-Santacroce from Modena. He passed his examinations brilliantly, and, true to his resolve, quitted the pupil-life of the school to enter upon his noviciate in near-by Tisis, where he led a life of service and humility, silent subordination and religious discipline, and imbibed therefrom a spiritual relish fully equal to the fanatical expectations of his early years.","In his rhetoric year, Leo let it be known that he wished to study theology and, if he should be found worthy, to join the order. The result was that his scholarship was transferred from the “second tier,” with its more modest board and room, to the “first tier,” where meals were served by waiters, and the neighbors on each side of his cubicle were a Silesian count von Harbuval and Chamaré and a marquis di Rangoni-Santacroce from Modena. He graduated with honors and, true to his resolve, exchanged the life of a boarding-school pupil for that of a novice in nearby Tisis—a life of service and humility, of silent subordination and religious training, from which he wrested intellectual pleasures congruent with his earlier wild fantasies."
"»Schämen Sie sich der Erfolgsanbetung!« mahnte ihn Herr Settembrini. »Mundus vult decipi. Ich verlange nicht, daß man sich um Herrn Naphta schart. Er ist ein arger Quertreiber.

Die alchimistische Logenobservanz hat viele edle, suchende Geister in späteren Jahrzehnten zu diesem Ziele geführt, – ich muß es nicht nennen, denn es kann Ihnen nicht entgangen sein, daß die Rangstufenfolge der schottischen Hochgrade nur ein Surrogat ist der Hierarchie, daß die alchimistische Weisheit des Meister-Maurers sich im Mysterium der Wandlung erfüllt, und daß die geheime Führung, die die Loge {772}ihren Zöglingen angedeihen ließ, sich ebenso deutlich in den Gnadenmitteln wiederfindet, wie die sinnbildlichen Spielereien des Bundeszeremoniells in der liturgischen und baulichen Symbolik unserer heiligen katholischen Kirche.«","“All the less since it is a matter of leading to the ultimate, to the absolute confession of the supernatural and thus to the goal. The alchemical lodge observation has led many noble, searching spirits to this goal in later decades - I don't have to name it, because it cannot have escaped you that the hierarchy of the Scottish high degrees is only a surrogate of the hierarchy, that the alchemical wisdom of the Master Mason is fulfilled in the mystery of change, and that the secret leadership that the Lodge {772} bestowed upon its pupils is found just as clearly in the means of grace as the symbolic gimmicks of the federal ceremonial in the liturgical and structural symbolism of our holy Catholic Church.""","“The less so that it is a guide to the ultimate; to the absolute recognition of the transcendental, and therewith to our end and aim. The alchemistic ritual of the lodges, in later centuries, led many a noble and inquiring spirit to that end—to which I need give no name, for it cannot have escaped you that the successive degrees of the Scottish Rite were only a surrogate, a substitute of the Hierarchy, that the alchemistic learning of the Master-Mason fulfilled itself in the mystery of transubstantiation, and that the hidden guidance which the lodge vouchsafed to its pupils has its prototype just as plainly in the means of grace, as the symbolic mummeries of lodge ceremonial have theirs in the liturgical and architectural symbolism of our Holy Catholic Church.”","“All the less so, since it is a guide to final things, to an absolute confession of those things that transcend the senses, and so to our goal. The alchemistic rites of such lodges have led many a noble, inquisitive mind to that goal in the decades since. But surely I need not spell it out, since it cannot have escaped you that the degrees in the Scottish Rite are but a surrogate for another hierarchy, that the alchemistic knowledge of the Master Mason is fulfilled in the mystery of transubstantiation, and that the mystic tour with which the lodge favors its novices clearly corresponds to the means of grace, just as the metaphoric games of its ceremonies are reflections of the liturgical and architectural symbols of our Holy Catholic Church.”"
"»Aber es ist doch so! Es ist ein sehr munterer Betrieb! Warum nimmst du denn Anstoß daran?« fragte Hans Castorp. »Übrigens erwähnte ich das nur nebenbei. Ich wollte nichts weiter sagen, als: es ist unheimlich und quälend, wenn der Körper auf eigene Hand und ohne Zusammenhang mit der Seele lebt und sich wichtig macht, wie bei solchem unmotivierten Herzklopfen. Man sucht förmlich nach einem Sinn dafür, einer Gemütsbewegung, die dazu gehört, einem Gefühl der Freude oder der Angst, wodurch es sozusagen gerechtfertigt würde, – so geht es wenigstens mir, ich kann nur von mir reden.«","'But that's the way it is! It's a very lively company! Why are you offended by that?” asked Hans Castorp. 'By the way, I only mentioned that in passing. I didn't want to say anything more than: it is uncanny and tormenting when the body lives on its own and without connection to the soul and makes itself important, as with such unmotivated palpitations. You're looking for a sense of it, an emotion that goes with it, a sense of joy or fear that would justify it, so to speak - at least that's how I feel, I can only speak for myself.""","“It’s a fact—it is very lively! Why do you object to that?” Hans Castorp asked. “But I only happened to mention it. I only meant to say that it is disturbing and unpleasant to have the body act as though it had no connexion with the soul, and put on such airs—by which I mean these senseless palpitations. You keep trying to find an explanation for them, an emotion to account for them, a feeling of joy or pain, which would, so to speak, justify them. At least, it is that way with me—but I can only speak for myself.”","“But it’s true! It is a regular hustle and bustle. Why are you so offended by that?” Hans Castorp asked. “And anyway, I only mentioned it incidentally. All I was trying to say is that it’s bizarre and upsetting when the body goes off on its own accord, living with no connection to one’s soul and putting on airs—like a heart pounding for no purpose whatever. One literally searches for some reason for it, some emotional stimulus, a feeling of joy or fear, that could justify it, so to speak—at least that’s how it is with me, I can only speak for myself.”"

"Es geschah vor jenem Einbau, an dessen anderer Seite der {328}Hofrat anfangs gestanden. Joachim hatte auf einer Art von Schustersessel vor einem Brett Platz genommen, gegen das er die Brust preßte, wobei er es außerdem mit den Armen umschlang; und mit knetenden Bewegungen verbesserte der Gehilfe seine Stellung, indem er Joachims Schultern weiter nach vorn drückte, seinen Rücken massierte. Hierauf begab er sich hinter die Kamera, um, wie irgend ein Photograph, gebückt, breitbeinig, die Ansicht zu prüfen, drückte seine Zufriedenheit aus und mahnte Joachim, beiseite gehend, tief einzuatmen und, bis alles vorüber, die Luft anzuhalten. Joachims gerundeter Rücken dehnte sich und blieb stehen. In diesem Augenblick hatte der Gehilfe am Schaltbrett den nötigen Handgriff getan. Zwei Sekunden lang spielten fürchterliche Kräfte, deren Aufwand erforderlich war, um die Materie zu durchdringen, Ströme von Tausenden von Volt, von hunderttausend, Hans Castorp glaubte sich zu erinnern. Kaum zum Zwecke gebändigt, suchten die Gewalten auf Nebenwegen sich Luft zu machen. Entladungen knallten wie Schüsse. Es knatterte blau am Meßapparat. Lange Blitze fuhren knisternd die Wand entlang. Irgendwo blickte ein rotes Licht, einem Auge gleich, still und drohend in den Raum, und eine Phiole in Joachims Rücken füllte sich grün. Dann beruhigte sich alles; die Lichterscheinungen verschwanden, und Joachim ließ seufzend den Atem aus. Es war geschehen.","It happened in front of that installation, on the other side of which the {328}counselor stood at first. Joachim sat down in a kind of shoemaker's chair in front of a board against which he pressed his chest and also wrapped his arms around it; and with kneading movements the assistant improved his position by pushing Joachim's shoulders further forward and massaging his back. Then he went behind the camera to examine the view, like any photographer, stooped, legs apart, expressed his satisfaction and admonished Joachim, stepping aside, to take a deep breath and, until it was all over, to hold his breath. Joachim's rounded back stretched and stood still. At that moment the assistant at the switchboard had done the necessary thing. For two seconds terrifying forces, the exertion of which was necessary to penetrate matter, played currents of thousands of volts, hundreds of thousands, Hans Castorp thought he remembered. Scarcely subdued to the end, the powers sought to find vent in byways. Discharges cracked like shots. The measuring apparatus crackled blue. Long bolts of lightning crackled along the wall. Somewhere a red light, like an eye, silently and menacingly peered into the room, and a vial in Joachim's back was filling with green. Then everything calmed down; the light phenomena disappeared and Joachim let out his breath with a sigh. It had happened.","It was done in front of that structure on the other side of which Hofrat Behrens had been standing when they entered. Joachim had taken his place on a sort of shoemaker’s bench, in front of a board, which he embraced with his arms and pressed his breast against it, while the assistant improved the position, massaging his back with kneading motions, and putting his arms further forward. Then he went behind the camera, and stood just as a photographer would, legs apart and stooped over, to look inside. He expressed his satisfaction and, going back to Joachim, warned him to draw in his breath and hold it until all was over. Joachim’s rounded back expanded and so remained; the assistant, at the switch-board, pulled the handle. Now, for the space of two seconds, fearful powers were in play—streams of thousands, of a hundred thousand of volts, Hans Castorp seemed to recall—which were necessary to pierce through solid matter. They could hardly be confined to their office, they tried to escape through other outlets: there were explosions like pistol-shots, blue sparks on the measuring apparatus; long lightnings crackled along the walls. Somewhere in the room appeared a red light, like a threatening eye, and a phial in Joachim’s rear filled with green. Then everything grew quiet, the phenomena disappeared, and Joachim let out his breath with a sigh. It was over.","These were under way in front of the built-in unit where the director had been standing as they came in. Joachim had sat down on a kind of cobbler’s bench, facing a panel, against which he now pressed his chest, hugging it at the same time with both arms. The assistant helped Joachim improve his position, pushing his shoulders farther forward and massaging his back in a series of kneading motions. He now moved behind the camera, and like a photographer, legs spread wide, bent forward to check the angle; he expressed his satisfaction, and stepping to one side he told Joachim to take a deep breath and hold it until everything was over. Joachim’s back expanded and stayed that way. At the same moment, the assistant flipped the appropriate switches. For two seconds the dreadful forces necessary to penetrate matter were let loose—a current of thousands of volts, one hundred thousand, Hans Castorp thought he had heard somewhere. Barely tamed for their purpose, these forces sought other outlets for their energy. Discharges exploded like gunshots. The gauges sizzled with blue light. Long sparks crackled along the wall. Somewhere a red light blinked, like a silent, threatening eye, and a vial behind Joachim’s back was filled with a green glow. Then everything calmed down; the spectacle of lights vanished, and Joachim expelled his breath with a sigh. It was over."
"»Sagen Sie mal, geehrtes Menschenkind, – haben Sie sich schon mal verschluckt?«","""Tell me, dear fellow - have you ever choked?""","Rising on tiptoes to peer into Joachim’s throat, she asked: “Tell me, young ‘un, do you ever swallow the wrong way?”","Standing on her tiptoes and gazing at Joachim’s uvula, she said, “Man alive, tell me—have you ever swallowed the wrong way?”"
"»Auch das noch?« rief Hans Castorp … »Hören Sie, das ist merkwürdig! Von Mylendonk und dann Adriatica. Es klingt, {96}als müßte sie längst gestorben sein. Geradezu mittelalterlich mutet es an.«","""That too?"" exclaimed Hans Castorp... ""Listen, that's strange! From Mylendonk and then Adriatica. It sounds as if she must have died long ago. It seems downright medieval.«",“Adriatica!” shouted Hans Castorp. “Priceless! Adriatica von Mylendonk! Isn’t that splendid! Sounds as though she had been dead a very long time. It is positively mediaeval.”,"“You don’t say?” Hans Castorp exclaimed. “That is extraordinary—von Mylendonk and Adriatica, to boot. It sounds as if she ought to have been dead for centuries. It has an absolutely medieval ring.”"
"»Das ist richtig«, sagte der Italiener kopfnickend. »Ich hatte die Ehre, Ihren Landsleuten von dem Leben dieses großen Poeten und Freidenkers zu erzählen, als es abgeschlossen war.

"Die Sache war die, daß das Frühstücksbier, sonst nur von mäßig benebelnder Wirkung auf seine Natur, den jungen Mann heute vollständig betäubte und lähmte, – es zeitigte Folgen, als hätte er einen Schlag vor die Stirn bekommen. Seine Lider waren wie Blei so schwer, die Zunge gehorchte dem einfachen Gedanken nicht recht, als er aus Artigkeit mit der Engländerin zu plaudern versuchte; auch nur die Richtung des Blicks zu verändern, erforderte große Selbstüberwindung, und hinzu kam, daß der abscheuliche Gesichtsbrand den gestrigen Grad nun wieder vollauf erreicht hatte: seine Wangen schienen ihm gedunsen vor Hitze, er atmete schwer, sein Herz pochte wie ein umwickelter Hammer, und wenn er unter all dem nicht sonderlich litt, so war es deshalb, weil sein Kopf sich in einem Zustand befand, als habe er zwei oder drei Atemzüge von Chloroform getan. Daß Dr. Krokowski doch noch beim Frühstück erschien und an seiner Tafel, ihm gegenüber, Platz nahm, bemerkte er nur traumweise, obgleich der Doktor ihn wiederholentlich scharf ins Auge faßte, während er mit den Damen zu seiner Rechten russisch konversierte, – wobei die jungen Mädchen, nämlich die blühende Marusja sowohl wie auch die magere Yoghurtesserin, unterwürfig und schamhaft die Augen vor ihm niederschlugen. Übrigens hielt Hans Castorp sich redlich, wie sich von selbst versteht, schwieg, da seine Zunge sich widerspenstig zeigte, lieber still und handhabte Messer und Ga{109}bel sogar mit besonderem Anstand. Als sein Vetter ihm zunickte und sich erhob, stand er ebenfalls auf, verneigte sich blind gegen die Tischgenossen und ging bestimmten Schrittes hinter Joachim hinaus.","The thing was that the morning beer, otherwise of only a moderately intoxicating effect on his nature, to-day completely stunned and paralyzed the young man - it produced results as if he had been struck in the forehead. His eyelids were as heavy as lead, his tongue did not quite obey the simple thought as he tried to chat with the Englishwoman out of politeness; even to change the direction of his gaze required great self-control, and what was more, the hideous burn on his face was now fully up to yesterday's degree: his cheeks seemed puffy with heat, he was breathing heavily, his heart was pounding like a wrapped hammer, and if he did not greatly suffer from all this, it was because his head was in a condition as if it had taken two or three breaths of chloroform. that dr Krokowski did appear at breakfast and took a seat at his table opposite him, he remarked only dreamily, although the doctor repeatedly eyed him sharply while he was conversing in Russian with the ladies on his right - the young girls viz the blooming Marusja as well as the skinny yoghurt-eater, submissively and bashfully lowered their eyes to him. Incidentally, Hans Castorp kept himself honest, as is self-evident, preferred to remain silent since his tongue showed itself to be stubborn, and even handled knives and forks with particular decency. When his cousin nodded to him and got up, he got up too, bowed blindly to his companions at the table, and followed Joachim out with a firm step.","The truth was that the breakfast beer, as a rule only mildly obfuscating to the young man’s sense, had this time completely stupefied and befuddled him. He felt as though he had received a blow on the head. His eyelids were heavy as lead; his tongue would not shape his simple thoughts when out of politeness he tried to talk to the Englishwoman. Even to alter the direction of his gaze he was obliged to conquer a great disinclination; and, added to all this, the hateful burning in his face had reached the same height as yesterday , his cheeks felt puffy with heat, he breathed with difficulty; his heart pounded dully, like a hammer muffled in cloth. If all these sensations caused him no high degree of suffering, that was only because his head felt as though he had inhaled a few whiffs of chloroform. He saw as in a dream that Dr. Krokowski appeared at breakfast and took the place opposite to his; the doctor, however, repeatedly looked him sharply in the eye, while he conversed in Russian with the ladies on his right. The young girls—the blooming Marusja and the lean consumer of yogurt—cast down their eyes modestly as the doctor spoke. Hans Castorp did not, of course, bear himself otherwise than with dignity. In silence, since his tongue refused its office, but managing his knife and fork with particular propriety. When his cousin nodded to him and got up, he rose too, bowed blindly to the rest of the table, and with cautious steps followed Joachim out.","The fact was that his breakfast beer, which normally had only a slightly befuddling effect on the young man, had completely stupefied and lamed him—it was as if he had been struck a blow across his brow. His eyelids were leaden; his tongue simply would not obey the simplest thoughts when he tried out of courtesy to chat with the Englishwoman; even shifting the direction of his eyes demanded a great struggle with himself. Added to all of which, the ghastly flush he had experienced yesterday had returned to his face in full force—his cheeks felt puffy from the heat, he was breathing heavily, his heart was pounding like a hammer wrapped in cloth. But despite it all, he was not suffering particularly—primarily because his head felt as if he had just taken two or three deep breaths of chloroform. Dr. Krokowski had appeared for breakfast and taken the seat opposite him at the head of the table; but, as if in a dream, he barely noticed the fact, although the doctor looked him in the eye, repeatedly and sharply, while carrying on a conversation in Russian with the ladies on his right, during which the younger ones—that is, Marusya with her rosy complexion and the gaunt yogurt-eater—kept their eyes cast down in meek embarrassment. It goes without saying that Hans Castorp kept his dignity, preferring to say not a word once his tongue had proved refractory and handling his knife and fork with special decorum. When his cousin nodded to him and stood up, he did the same; after bowing blindly to his tablemates, he followed Joachim, taking deliberate, careful steps as he went."
"{266}Die beiden lachten, und Joachim antwortete, indem er die Absätze zusammenzog:","{266}The two laughed, and Joachim replied by drawing the paragraphs together:","Both cousins laughed, and Joachim answered, heels together: “We were just going to, Herr Hofrat.","They both laughed, and clicking his heels, Joachim responded, “We were just about to do that, Director Behrens."
"Das Wort brauchte einige Zeit, bis es ihm ins Bewußtsein drang. Dann fuhr er auf, wirr um sich blickend, wie ein aus dem Schlaf Gestörter. Ihr Gespräch war ziemlich langsam vonstatten gegangen, da Hans Castorp das Französische schwerfällig und wie in zögerndem Sinnen sprach. Das Klavier, das kurze Zeit {512}geschwiegen hatte, tönte wieder, nunmehr unter den Händen des Mannheimers, der den Slawenjüngling abgelöst und Noten aufgelegt hatte. Fräulein Engelhart saß bei ihm und blätterte um. Der Ball hatte sich gelichtet. Eine größere Anzahl der Pensionäre schien horizontale Lage eingenommen zu haben. Vor ihnen saß niemand mehr. Im Lesezimmer spielte man Karten.","It took a while for the word to sink in. Then he started up, looking around confusedly, like someone disturbed from his sleep. Their conversation had been rather slow, as Hans Castorp spoke French heavily and as if hesitantly. The piano, which had been silent for a short time, sounded again, now in the hands of the man from Mannheim, who had relieved the Slav youth and put on music. Fraulein Engelhart sat with him and turned the pages. The ball had cleared. A larger number of pensioners seemed to have assumed a horizontal position. Nobody was sitting in front of them anymore. They played cards in the reading room.","It took time for the words to penetrate his consciousness. Then he started up, staring about him as though roused out of a dream. The conversation had proceeded rather slowly, for Hans Castorp spoke French uneasily, feeling for the sense. The piano had been silent awhile, now it sounded again, under the hands of the man from Mannheim, who had relieved the Slavic youth. He put some music in place, and Fräulein Engelhart sat down beside him to turn the leaves. The party was thinning out; many of the guests had presumably taken up the horizontal. From where they sat they could see no one; but there were players at the card-tables in the writing-room.","It took a while before what she had said penetrated his consciousness. But then he started up, looking about in befuddlement, like someone rudely awakened from sleep. Their conversation had proceeded rather slowly, because Hans Castorp’s French was clumsy and he spoke haltingly as he tried to express himself. The piano, which had briefly fallen silent, struck up again, now under the hands of the man from Mannheim, who had taken over for the Slavic lad. He had spread his music out before him, and Fräulein Engelhart now sat down next to him to turn pages. The party was thinning out. The majority of the residents appeared to have assumed the horizontal position. There was no one sitting in front of them now. People were again playing cards in the reading room."

"Das war abenteuerlich, daß plötzlich ein Vertreter und Abgesandter der Heimat neben ihm saß, die Atmosphäre des Alten, Versunkenen, des früheren Lebens, einer tiefliegenden »Oberwelt« noch frisch im Gewebe seines englischen Anzugs tragend. Aber es hatte kommen müssen. Längst hatte Hans Castorp im stillen mit einem solchen Vorstoß des Flachlandes gerechnet und sogar die Persönlichkeit, die sich nun wirklich {645}mit der Erkundung betraut zeigte, ganz zutreffend dafür in Aussicht genommen, – was eben nicht schwer gewesen war; denn Peter, der seefahrende, kam wenig dafür in Frage, und vom Großonkel Tienappel selbst stand fest, daß keine zehn Pferde ihn je in diese Gegenden schleppen würden, von deren Luftdruckverhältnissen er alles zu fürchten hatte. Nein, James mußte es sein, der sich nach dem Abhandengekommenen im heimatlichen Auftrage umsehen würde; schon früher war er erwartet. Seit aber Joachim allein zurückgekehrt war und im Verwandtenkreis von der hiesigen Sachlage Nachricht gegeben hatte, war der Angriff fällig und überfällig, und so war denn Hans Castorp nicht im geringsten verblüfft, als, knappe vierzehn Tage nach Joachims Abreise, der Concierge ihm ein Telegramm überhändigte, das, ahnungsvoll geöffnet, sich als James Tienappels kurzfristige Anmeldung erwies. Er hatte auf Schweizer Boden zu tun und sich zu dem Gelegenheitsausflug in Hansens Höhe entschlossen. Übermorgen war er zu erwarten.","It was extraordinary that suddenly a representative and envoy from home was sitting next to him, the atmosphere of the old, the sunken, of the earlier life, of a deep ""upper world"" still fresh in the fabric of his English suit. But it had to come. For a long time Hans Castorp had been secretly reckoning with such an advance into the lowlands and even rightly considered the person who was actually {645} entrusted with the reconnaissance - which hadn't been difficult; because Peter, the seafarer, was not a good choice, and great-uncle Tienappel himself was certain that not even ten horses would ever drag him to these regions, where the air pressure conditions he had everything to fear. No, it had to be James who would look around for the missing item on his home business; he was expected earlier. But since Joachim had returned alone and had informed his relatives of the situation here, the attack was overdue and overdue, and so Hans Castorp was not in the least surprised when, barely fourteen days after Joachim's departure, the concierge handed him a telegram , which, forebodingly opened, turned out to be James Tienappel's last-minute entry. He had business on Swiss soil and decided to make the occasional trip to Hansen's height. He was expected the day after tomorrow.","It was uncanny, to have suddenly sitting next him a delegate and ambassador from home, exhaling from the very weave of his English suit of clothes the atmosphere of that old life in the “upper” world so far below. But it was bound to come. For a long time Hans Castorp had silently reckoned with the possibility of an advance from the flat-land, and even been fairly sure what personal shape it would take. It was, in fact, not difficult to guess who would come, for Peter, the seafaring man, was almost out of the question, while as for Great-uncle Tienappel himself, it was no less true than ever that wild horses could not drag him to a spot from the atmospheric pressure of which he had everything to fear. No, James was the man to be sent with a commission from home to search out the truant—and his advent had been expected even earlier. After Joachim had returned alone, and told the family circle what the state of things was, the visit had been due and overdue, and thus Hans Castorp was not in the slightest degree nonplussed when, scarcely two weeks after his cousin left, the concierge handed him a telegram. He opened it with foreknowledge of its contents, and read the announcement of James Tienappel’s impending arrival. He had business in Switzerland, and would take the occasion to make Hans a visit on his heights. He would be here the day after to-morrow.","It was strange suddenly to have sitting beside him a representative and ambassador from home, the scent of an old, vanished, earlier life, of an “upper world” that lay so far below, still clinging fresh to the weave of the man’s English suit. But it had been inevitable. Hans Castorp had been quietly expecting such a raid from the flatlands for a long time now, had even correctly guessed the person who would actually be entrusted with the task of reconnaissance—but that had not been hard to do. Seafaring Peter was more or less out of the question, and as for Great-uncle Tienappel, it was understood that wild horses could not drag him to regions whose barometric pressures he had every reason to fear. No, it would have to be James who was commissioned to check up on the missing family member. Hans Castorp had expected him before this. But once Joachim had returned home alone and spread the news among their relatives of how things stood up here, an attack was due, indeed overdue; and so Hans Castorp had not been the least bit surprised when, barely two weeks after Joachim’s departure, the concierge handed him a telegram, whose content he surmised even as he opened it: an announcement of the imminent arrival of James Tienappel. He had business in Switzerland and had decided to use the occasion to visit Hans on his mountaintop. He would be there the day after next."
"Die Sonne schien, es war ein schöner, blanker Tag, aber man hatte doch gut getan, Übergangspaletots anzulegen: im Fahren würde man es zweifellos kühl haben. Auch Madame Chauchat trug einen warmen Gurtmantel aus faserigem, großkariertem Stoff und sogar ein wenig Pelz um die Schultern. Den Rand ihres Filzhutes hatte sie mit einem unter dem Kinn gebundenen olivenfarbenen Schleier seitlich niedergebogen, was ihr so reizend stand, daß es die Mehrzahl der Anwesenden geradezu schmerzte, – nur Ferge nicht, den einzigen, der nicht verliebt in sie war; und diese seine Unbefangenheit hatte zur Folge, daß ihm bei der vorläufigen Verteilung der Plätze, bis die Externen zur Gesellschaft stoßen würden, der Rücksitz gegenüber Mynheer und Madame im ersten Landauer zufiel, während Hans Castorp, nicht ohne ein spöttisches Lächeln Clawdias aufgefangen zu haben, mit Ferdinand Wehsal das zweite Gefährt bestieg. Die schmächtige Person des malaiischen Kammerdieners nahm teil an dem Ausflug. Mit einem geräumigen {932}Korbe, unter dessen Deckel die Hälse zweier Weinflaschen hervorragten, und den er unter dem Rücksitz des vorderen Landauers verwahrte, war er hinter seiner Herrschaft erschienen, und in dem Augenblick, als er zur Seite des Kutschers die Arme gekreuzt hatte, erhielten die Pferde ihr Zeichen, und mit angezogenen Bremsen setzten die Wagen sich die Wegschleife hinab in Bewegung.","The sun was shining, it was a beautiful, clear day, but it was a good idea to put on transitional paletots: it would no doubt be cool to drive. Madame Chauchat also wore a warm belted coat of fibrous, large-checked material, and even a little fur around her shoulders. She had turned down the brim of her felt hat with an olive-colored veil tied under her chin, which became her so charmingly that it downright pained most of those present—except Ferge, the only one who was not in love with her; and this impartiality of his had the consequence that during the provisional allocation of seats, until the outsiders joined the company, he took the back seat opposite Mynheer and Madame in the first Landauer, while Hans Castorp, not without having caught a mocking smile from Clawdia, boarded the second vehicle with Ferdinand Wehsal. The slight person of the Malay valet took part in the outing. With a capacious basket, under the lid of which protruded the necks of two wine-bottles, and which he kept under the back seat of the front landau, he had appeared behind his master, and at the moment he had crossed his arms at the coachman's side , the horses were given their signal and, brakes on, the wagons began to move down the loop.","The sun shone, the day was beautiful and bright. But they had done well to don overcoats, driving would be cool. Madame Chauchat too wore a warm belted mantle of some woolly stuff with a pattern of large checks, and a small fur about her shoulders. The rim of her felt hat was turned down at one side by the olive-green veil she wore bound under her chin; an effect so charming that it was actual pain to most of the beholders—Ferge being the only man there not in love with her. To his disinterested state was probably due the temporary advantage he presently enjoyed, of being selected to sit opposite Mynheer and Madame in the first landau, while Hans Castorp mounted with Wehsal into the second, catching as he did so a mocking smile that for a moment visited Frau Chauchat’s face. The others would be called for at their lodgings. The Malayan servant joined the party with a capacious basket, from the top of which protruded the necks of two winebottles. He bestowed it under the back seat of the first landau, took his place by the coachman on the box and folded his arms; the horses started up, and the carriages, with the brakes against their wheels, drove down the drive.","The sun shone, it was a beautiful, bright day; but it had been a good idea to put on spring overcoats—the drive would be cool, no doubt. Madame Chauchat was also wearing a belted coat of some warm, fuzzy, large-checked fabric, and had even thrown a little fur over her shoulders. The brim of her felt hat was pulled down on one side by an olive-colored veil she had tied under her chin, in an effect so charming that it was almost painful for all present—except Ferge, the only man who was not in love with her. His impartiality meant that when they took their places in a temporary arrangement—until the nonresidents would join them—he was assigned a spot on the backseat of the first landau, across from Mynheer and Madame, while Hans Castorp climbed aboard the second carriage with Ferdinand Wehsal, though not without having first spotted a wry smile on Clavdia’s face. The Malayan valet had joined them for the excursion; walking in his master’s wake, his slight figure had appeared bearing an ample basket, from under whose lid the necks of two bottles of wine jutted up, which he then stored under the backseat of the first carriage. The moment he took his seat beside the coachman and crossed his arms, the horses were given the sign and the carriages moved off down the loop of the driveway, brakes set."

"Aber er war guten Willens, sich beeinflussen zu lassen, im Sinne des Wortes, daß es angenehm sei, Versuche anzustellen, und so legte er dem Proteste, den seine Pietät und sein Geschmack gegen die Settembrinische Anordnung der Dinge erhoben, Zügel an, in der Erwägung, daß, was ihm lästerlich vorkam, Kühnheit genannt werden könne und, was ihn abgeschmackt anmutete, Hochherzigkeit und edelmütiger Überschwang wenigstens dort und damals gewesen sein mochte: so zum Beispiel, wenn Großvater Settembrini die Barrikaden den »Volksthron« genannt und erklärt hatte, es gelte, »die Pike des Bürgers am Altar der Menschheit zu weihen«.","But he was willing to be influenced, in the sense that it was agreeable to make experiments, and so he reined in the protest which his piety and taste raised against the Settembrian arrangement of things, in which Considering that what struck him as blasphemous could be called boldness, and what struck him as absurd might have been generosity and generous exuberance, at least there and then: as, for example, when Grandfather Settembrini called the barricades the ""throne of the people"" and declared the aim was to »consecrate the pike of the citizen at the altar of humanity«.","But still open-minded—at least in the sense that he enjoyed the experiment he was making—he restrained the objections which his sense of fitness would have raised against the Settembrinian scheme of things. Restrained them on the theory that what seemed sedition to him might to another seem dauntless courage; and what he called bad taste might have been, in that far-off time and circumstance, but a display of the noble excesses of a high-hearted nature—for instance, when Grandfather Settembrini called the barricades “the people’s throne,” and talked about “dedicating the burgher’s pike on the altar of humanity.”","But he was willing to let himself be influenced, in the sense that it was pleasant to experiment, and so he reined in the protests that piety and good taste would have raised against the Settembrinian order of things and decided that what seemed blasphemous to him might be termed bold and what he found in bad taste might, at least in those days and under those conditions, be considered the excesses of a high-minded and noble nature—as, for example, when Grandfather Settembrini called barricades the “people’s throne” or declared it necessary to “consecrate the citizen ’s pike on the altar of humanity.”"
"Settembrini hörte ihm zu und nickte. Er tat dies noch, als Hans Castorp vorläufig mit seiner Kritik zu Rande gekommen war und nicht mehr sprach. Dann atmete er auf und sagte:",Settembrini listened to him and nodded. He was still doing this when Hans Castorp had finally gotten over his criticism and was no longer speaking. Then he breathed a sigh of relief and said:,"Settembrini listened, and nodded; nodded after Hans Castorp had come to an end, for the present, of his pronouncement and fallen silent. Then he took a breath and said: “I will not seek to extenuate the specific forms which life’s normal cruelty assumes in your native sphere.","Settembrini listened, nodding. He nodded again when Hans Castorp finished his critical remarks for now and fell silent. Then he heaved a sigh and said, “I will not attempt to gloss over the specific forms life’s natural cruelty takes in your society."
"Hans Castorp also hielt innerlich nicht jene Ordnung, womit der die Zeit bewirtschaftende Mensch ihren Ablauf beaufsichtigt, ihre Einheiten abteilt, zählt und benennt. Er hatte auf den stillen Anbruch des zehnten Monats nicht achtgehabt; nur das {345}Sinnliche berührte ihn, die Sonnenglut mit der geheimen Frostfrische darin und darunter, – eine Empfindung, die ihm in dieser Stärke neu war und ihn zu einem kulinarischen Vergleich anregte: sie erinnerte ihn, einer Äußerung zufolge, die er gegen Joachim tat, an eine »Omelette en surprise« mit Gefrorenem unter dem heißen Eierschaum. Er sagte öfter solche Dinge, sagte sie rasch, geläufig und mit bewegter Stimme, wie ein Mensch spricht, den es fröstelt bei heißer Haut. Dazwischen freilich war er auch schweigsam, um nicht zu sagen: in sich gekehrt; denn seine Aufmerksamkeit war wohl nach außen gerichtet, aber auf einen Punkt; das übrige, Menschen wie Dinge, verschwamm im Nebel, einem in Hans Castorps Hirn erzeugten Nebel, den Hofrat Behrens und Dr. Krokowski zweifellos als das Produkt löslicher Gifte angesprochen haben würden, wie der Benebelte sich selber sagte, ohne daß diese Einsicht das Vermögen oder auch nur im entferntesten den Wunsch in ihm gezeitigt hätte, des Rausches ledig zu werden.","Hans Castorp, then, did not keep the inner order with which the man who manages his time supervises its course, divides, counts and names its units. He had ignored the quiet dawn of the tenth month; only the {345}sensuous touched him, the sun's heat with the secret frosty freshness in it and underneath - a feeling that was new to him in this strength and stimulated him to a culinary comparison: it reminded him, according to a statement he made to Joachim did, of an ""omelette en surprise"" with frozen food under the hot egg foam. He often said things like that, she said quickly, fluently, and in an emotional voice, like a person whose skin is shivering speaks. In between, of course, he was also silent, not to say withdrawn; for his attention was directed outward, but on one point; the rest, people as well as things, blurred in the fog, a fog created in Hans Castorp's brain, which Hofrat Behrens and Dr. Krokowski would doubtless have been referred to as the product of soluble poisons, as the befuddled man said to himself, without this insight having given him the ability or even the remotest desire to get rid of the intoxication.","Hans Castorp did not keep inward count of the time, as does the man who husbands it, notes its passing, divides and tells and labels its units. He had not heeded the silent entry of the tenth month, but he was arrested by its appeal to the senses, this glowing heat that concealed the frost within and beneath it. It was a sensation which, to anything like this degree, he had never before experienced, and it aroused him to the culinary comparison which he made to Joachim, of an omelette en surprise, holding an ice concealed within the hot froth of the beaten egg. He often made such comments, talking headlong and volubly, as a man does in a feverish chill. But between whiles he was silent; we shall not say self-absorbed, for his attention was presumably directed outwards, though upon a single point. All else, whether of the animate or the inanimate world, swam about him in a mist—a mist of his own making, which Hofrat Behrens and Dr. Krokowski would doubtless have explained as the product of soluble toxins, as the befuddled one himself did also, though without having the slightest power or even desire to rid himself of the state they induced.","Inwardly, then, Hans Castorp ignored the structure by which those who husband time measure its passing and divide it into units, counting and naming each. He had paid no attention to the silent onset of the tenth month; he felt only what his senses felt—blazing heat with icy frost hidden within and beneath it, a sensation that was new to him in this intensity and that suggested a culinary comparison: it reminded him, he remarked to Joachim, of an omelette en surprise, where ice cream lay wrapped in hot meringue. He often made such comments, letting them fall quickly and offhandedly, though with emotion in his voice, like a man who is chilled and feverish at the same time. To be sure, in between such moments, he could be silent, too, if not to say turned in upon himself; for although his attention was directed outward, it was focused on just one point. All the rest, whether people or objects, lay in a blur of fog—a fog that was engendered in Hans Castorp’s own brain and that Director Behrens and Dr. Krokowski would doubtless have declared to be the product of soluble toxins. He even told himself this was the case—not that the insight aroused in him the capacity or even the slightest wish to be rid of his intoxication."
"»Ich salutiere der Vernunft«, antwortete Settembrini. »Ich salutiere übrigens auch dem Mute. Was Sie sagen, läßt sich wohl hören, es dürfte schwer sein, etwas Triftiges dagegen einzuwenden. Auch habe ich wirklich schöne Fälle von Akklimatisation beobachtet. Da war im vorigen Jahre Fräulein Kneifer, Ottilie Kneifer, durchaus von Familie, die Tochter eines höheren Staatsfunktionärs. Sie war wohl anderthalb Jahre hier und hatte sich so vortrefflich eingelebt, daß sie, als ihre Gesundheit vollkommen hergestellt war – denn das kommt vor, man wird zuweilen gesund hier oben –, daß sie auch dann noch um keinen Preis fort wollte. Sie bat den Hofrat von ganzer Seele, noch bleiben zu dürfen, sie könne und möge nicht heim, hier sei sie zu Hause, hier sei sie glücklich; da aber lebhafter Zudrang herrschte und man ihr Zimmer benötigte, so war ihr Flehen umsonst, und man beharrte darauf, sie als gesund zu entlassen. Ottilie bekam hohes Fieber, sie ließ ihre Kurve tüchtig ansteigen. Allein man entlarvte sie, indem man ihr das gebräuchliche Thermometer mit einer ›Stummen Schwester‹ vertauschte, – Sie wissen noch nicht, was das ist, es ist ein Thermometer ohne Bezifferung, der Arzt kontrolliert ihn, indem er ein Maß daran legt und zeichnet die Kurve dann selbst. Ottilie, mein Herr, hatte 36,9, Ottilie war fieberfrei. Da badete sie im See, – wir schrieben Anfang Mai damals, wir hatten {135}Nachtfröste, der See war nicht geradezu eiskalt, er hatte genau genommen ein paar Grad über Null. Sie blieb eine gute Weile im Wasser, um dies oder jenes abzubekommen, – allein der Erfolg? Sie war und blieb gesund. Sie schied in Schmerz und Verzweiflung, unzugänglich den Trostworten ihrer Eltern. ›Was soll ich da unten?‹ rief sie wiederholt. ›Hier ist meine Heimat!‹ Ich weiß nicht, was aus ihr geworden ist … Aber mir scheint, Sie hören mich nicht, Ingenieur? Es kostet Sie Mühe, sich auf den Beinen zu halten, wenn mich nicht alles täuscht. Leutnant, hier haben Sie Ihren Vetter!« wandte er sich zu Joachim, der eben herantrat. »Führen Sie ihn zu Bette! Er vereinigt Vernunft und Mut, aber heute abend ist er ein wenig hinfällig.«","""I salute reason,"" Settembrini replied. “By the way, I also salute the Mute. I think it's worth listening to what you're saying, it would be hard to argue with anything cogent. I have also observed really nice cases of acclimatization. Last year there was Fraulein Kneifer, Ottilie Kneifer, definitely from the family, the daughter of a high-ranking state functionary. She had been here for a year and a half and had settled in so well that when her health was perfectly restored - because that happens, one sometimes gets well up here - she still didn't want to leave at all. She begged the Hofrat with all her heart to be allowed to stay, she couldn't and didn't want to go home, here she was at home, here she was happy; but since there was a lively influx of people and her room was needed, her pleading was in vain and they insisted on dismissing her as healthy. Ottilie got a high fever, she let her curves increase considerably. But they unmasked her by exchanging the usual thermometer for a ""mute nurse"" - you don't yet know what that is, it's a thermometer without numbers, the doctor checks it by measuring it and drawing it Curve then itself. Ottilie, sir, had 36.9, Ottilie was free of fever. She was bathing in the lake - we wrote at the beginning of May that we had night frosts, the lake wasn't exactly ice cold, it was actually a few degrees above zero. She stayed in the water for a good while to get this or that—success alone? She was and stayed healthy. She departed in pain and despair, inaccessible to her parents' words of comfort. 'What am I supposed to do down there?' she cried repeatedly. 'Here is my home!' I don't know what has become of it... But I don't think you hear me, Engineer? You're having trouble staying on your feet, if I'm not mistaken. Lieutenant, here is your cousin!' he turned to Joachim, who was just coming up. 'Take him to bed! He combines reason and courage, but tonight he's a little frail.'","“I pay every homage to reason,” Settembrini answered. “I pay homage to valour too. What you say sounds well; it would be hard to oppose anything convincing against it. I myself have seen some beautiful cases of acclimatization. There was Fräulein Kneifer, Ottilie Kneifer, last year. She came of a good family—the daughter of an important government official. She was here some year and a half and had grown to feel so much at home that when her health was quite restored—it does happen, up here; people do sometimes get well —she couldn’t bear to leave. She implored the Hofrat to let her stop; she could not and would not go; this was her home, she was happy here. But the place was full, they wanted her room, and so all her prayers were in vain; they stood out for discharging her cured. Ottilie was taken with high fever, her curve went well up. But they found her out by exchanging her regular thermometer for a ‘silent sister.’ You aren’t acquainted as yet with the term; it is a thermometer without figures, which the physician measures with a little rule, and plots the curve himself. Ottilie, my dear sir, had 98.4°; she was normal. Then she went bathing in the lake—it was the beginning of May; we were having frost at night; the water was not precisely ice-cold, say a few degrees above. She remained some time in the water, trying to contract some illness or other—alas, she was, and remained, quite sound. She departed in anguish and despair, deaf to all the consolations her parents could give. ‘What shall I do down there?’ she kept crying. ‘This is my home!’ I never heard what became of her.—But you are not listening, Engineer. Unless I am much mistaken, simply remaining on your legs costs you an effort. Lieutenant!” he addressed himself to Joachim, who was just coming up. “Take your cousin and put him to bed. He unites the virtues of courage and moderation—but just now he is a little groggy.”","“I salute reason,” Settembrini replied. “And I salute courage as well, by the way. What you say sounds good, and it would be difficult to find any truly cogent objection. Because I, too, have seen some marvelous cases of acclimatization. There was Fräulein Kneifer just last year, Ottilie Kneifer, from a fine family, the daughter of a higher governmental official. She was here for about a year and a half, and became so splendidly accustomed to life up here that once she had been completely restored to health—and that does happen, people do get well up here sometimes —she refused to leave on any account. She fervently begged the director to be allowed to stay—she simply could not, would not return home. This was home to her, this was where she was happy. But there was such a press of people wanting to get in, and they needed her room. Her pleas proved in vain, and they insisted that they would have to dismiss her as healed. Ottilie came down with a high fever, let her chart just shoot up with a vengeance. Except that they found her out—by substituting a ‘silent sister’ for her usual thermometer. You don’t yet know what that is—it’s a thermometer without any markings, and the doctor checks it by laying a scale up against it and draws the chart himself. Ottilie, sir, had a temperature of ninety-eight point four. Ottilie had no fever. And so she went for a swim in the lake. It was only the beginning of May, still with frost at night, but the lake was no longer ice—a degree or two above freezing in fact. She stayed in the water for a good while, trying to catch her death of something—and with what success? She remained perfectly healthy. She left us in agony and despair, deaf to her parents’ words of comfort. ‘What is there for me down below?’ she kept crying. ‘This is my home!’ I don’t know what became of her. . . . But it seems you’re not listening , are you, my good engineer? If I’m not quite mistaken, you’re having difficulty staying on your feet. Lieutenant, do take your cousin here,” he said, turning to Joachim, who had just arrived, “and put him to bed. He is a man who unites reason with courage, but he’s a little indisposed this evening.”"
"»Keinesfalls kann man das minimal nennen für den Vormittag«, sagte Joachim. »Eine schöne Bescherung«, sagte er und stand an seines Vetters Lager, wie man eben vor einer »schönen Bescherung« steht, die Arme in die Seiten gestemmt und mit gesenktem Kopfe. »Du wirst ins Bett müssen.«","""You can't call that minimal for the morning,"" said Joachim. ""A nice mess,"" he said, and stood at his cousin's bed the way one stands in front of a ""nice mess,"" arms akimbo and head bowed. ""You're going to have to go to bed.""","“But you can’t call that slight fever,” Joachim said. “Certainly not for the forenoon. This is a pretty how-d’ye-do!” And he stood by his cousin’s side as one stands before a how-d’ye-do, arms akimbo and head dropped. “You’ll have to go to bed.”","“You can’t really call that just slightly elevated, not in the middle of the morning,” Joachim said. “Now isn’t this a nice mess,” he said, standing beside his recumbent cousin the way one stands beside a nice mess, his hands on his hips, his head lowered. “You need to be in bed.”"
"Es war ein Bruststück in Halbprofil, etwas unter Lebensgröße, dekolletiert, mit einer Schleierdraperie um Schultern und Busen, in einen breiten, schwarzen, nach innen abfallenden und am Rande der Leinwand mit einer Goldleiste verzierten Rahmen gefaßt. Frau Chauchat erschien da zehn Jahre älter, als sie war, wie das bei Dilettantenporträts, die charakteristisch {390}sein wollen, zu gehen pflegt. Im ganzen Gesicht war zuviel Rot, die Nase war arg verzeichnet, die Haarfarbe nicht getroffen, zu strohig, der Mund verzerrt, der besondere Reiz der Physiognomie nicht gesehen oder nicht herausgebracht, durch Vergröberung seiner Ursachen verfehlt, das Ganze ein ziemlich pfuscherhaftes Produkt, als Bildnis seinem Gegenstande nur weitläufig verwandt. Aber Hans Castorp nahm es mit der Ähnlichkeit nicht weiter genau, die Beziehungen dieser Leinwand zu Frau Chauchats Person waren ihm eng genug, das Bild sollte Frau Chauchat darstellen, sie selbst hatte in diesen Räumen dazu Modell gesessen, das genügte ihm, bewegt wiederholte er:","It was a half-profile bust, slightly below life size, low-cut, with a veil draped around the shoulders and breasts, set in a broad, black, sloping frame decorated with a gold border at the edge of the canvas. Mrs. Chauchat appeared ten years older than she was, as is usual with dilettante portraits that want to be characteristic. There was too much red all over the face, the nose was badly marked, the color of the hair was wrong, too strawy, the mouth distorted, the special charm of the physiognomy not seen or not brought out, missed by coarsening its causes, the whole thing a rather bungled product when Portrait only distantly related to its subject. But Hans Castorp wasn't too specific about the resemblance, the connection between this canvas and Frau Chauchat's person was close enough for him, the picture was supposed to represent Frau Chauchat, she herself had sat as a model in these rooms, that was enough for him, he repeated, moved:","It was a bust-length, in half profile, rather under life-size, in a wide, bevelled frame, black, with an inner beading of gilt. Neck and bosom were bare or veiled with a soft drapery laid about the shoulders. Frau Chauchat appeared ten years older than her age, as often happens in amateur portraiture where the artist is bent on making a character study. There was too much red all over the face, the nose was badly out of drawing, the colour of the hair badly hit off, too straw-colour; the mouth was distorted, the peculiar charm of the features ungrasped or at least not brought out, spoiled by the exaggeration of their single elements. The whole was a rather botched performance, and only distantly related to its original. But Hans Castorp was not particular about the degree of likeness, the relation of this canvas to Frau Chauchat ’s person was close enough for him. It purported to represent her, in these very rooms she had sat for it,","It was a bust in half-profile—somewhat smaller than life-size, with the neck bared, a veil draped across the shoulders and breasts—set in a wide, black, beveled frame edged in gold nearest the canvas. Frau Chauchat looked ten years older than she was—as usually happens when amateurs try to capture character. There was too much red in the face, the nose was very badly drawn , the hair color was wrong, almost that of straw, the mouth was askew; the special fascination of her features had not been brought out, was not even apparent, but only coarsened by exaggeration. The whole thing was a rather botched job, the portrait only vaguely corresponding to the model. But Hans Castorp was not all that scrupulous about the issue of resemblance. The relationship between Frau Chauchat as a person and this piece of canvas was enough for him. The painting was intended to be a depiction of Frau Chauchat, she had sat as the model for it here in this apartment—that sufficed for him."

"»Ja, da reden Sie mir nun so von oben herab zu«, erwiderte der elende Mensch, »und wissen gar nicht, wieviel Unverschämtheit in Ihrem Trost liegt, und daß Sie mich dadurch nur noch tiefer erniedrigen. Sie haben gut reden und trösten vom hohen Roß herunter, denn wenn Sie derzeit auch ziemlich lächerlich dastehen, so sind Sie doch einmal daran gewesen und waren im siebenten Himmel, allmächtiger Gott, und haben ihre Arme um Ihren Nacken gefühlt und all das, allmächtiger Gott, es brennt mir im Schlunde und in der Herzgrube, wenn ich dran denke, – und sehen im Vollbewußtsein dessen, was Ihnen zuteil geworden, auf meine bettelhaften Qualen hinab …«","""Yes, you are talking down to me like that,"" replied the wretched man, ""and you have no idea how impudent your consolation is and that you are only humiliating me further by doing so.

You have the right to, though. You are laughing out of the wrong corner of your mouth now; but once you were in the seventh heaven, and felt her arms about your neck— oh, God, it burns me in the pit of my stomach when I think of it—and you are conscious of all you have had, when you look down on me and my torments and think what a beggarly wretch I am.”","“Yes, there you sit offering me your condescending advice,” the wretched man replied, “and have no idea how much insult there is in your consolation, that you only humiliate me all the more with it.

"»Ja, das ist merkwürdig«, erwiderte Hans Castorp. »Ha nein, mir macht es natürlich nichts. Man kann es ja sogar ernst und feierlich nehmen, wenn man will, – obgleich es dann am Ende auf einer Kaffeegarnitur nicht ganz am Platz ist. Die Alten sollen ja so etwas gelegentlich auf ihren Särgen angebracht haben. Das Obszöne und das Heilige war ihnen gewissermaßen ein und dasselbe.«","""Yes, that's strange,"" replied Hans Castorp. 'Ha no, of course I don't mind. You can even take it seriously and solemnly if you want - although in the end it's not quite appropriate on a coffee set. The old people are said to have put something like that on their coffins from time to time. In a way, the obscene and the sacred were one and the same.«","“Yes, it is quite unusual,” Hans Castorp answered. “Ha ha! No, it doesn’t trouble me. But one can take it perfectly seriously; solemnly, in fact—only then it is rather out of place on a coffee-machine. The ancients are said to have used such motifs on their sarcophagi. The sacred and the obscene were more or less the same thing to them.” “I should say the princess was more for the second,” Behrens said.","“It’s quite remarkable,” Hans Castorp replied. “No, no, it doesn’t bother me, of course. One can even view it in dead earnest if one likes—although, after all, it’s not exactly appropriate on a coffee service. The ancients are said to have decorated their coffins with things like this on occasion. The obscene and the sacred were more or less one and the same for them.” “Well, as far as the princess goes,” Behrens said, “she was, I think, given more to the former."
"»Bitte sehr, bitte sehr«, sagte Hans Castorp von oben herab. »Und du?« dachte er. »Wie ist dir zumute? Ganz unbeteiligt bist du doch auch nicht, von früher her, wenn mich nicht dieses und jenes täuscht, blaubackiger Witwer mit deiner anschaulichen Ölmalerei. Legst allerlei Schadenfreude in deine Worte, wie mir scheint, und dabei sind wir doch Leidensgenossen, gewissermaßen in Hinsicht auf Peeperkorn.« – »Kurioser Mann, entschieden originelle Erscheinung«, sagte er mit entwerfender Gebärde. »Robust und spärlich, das ist der Eindruck, den man von ihm gewinnt, den ich wenigstens heute beim Frühstück von ihm gewonnen habe. Robust und auch wieder spärlich, mit diesen Eigenschaftswörtern muß man ihn meiner Meinung nach kennzeichnen, obgleich sie gewöhnlich nicht für vereinbar gelten. Er ist wohl groß und breit und steht gern spreizbeinig da, die Hände in seinen senkrechten Hosentaschen vergraben – sie sind senkrecht angebracht bei ihm, wie ich bemerken mußte, nicht seitlich, wie bei Ihnen und mir und sonst wohl in den höheren Gesellschaftsklassen –, und wenn er so dasteht und nach holländischer Weise am Gaumen redet, dann hat er unleugbar was recht Robustes. Aber sein Kinnbart ist schütter, – lang, aber schütter, daß man die Haare zählen zu können glaubt, und seine Augen sind auch nur klein und blaß, ohne Farbe geradezu, ich kann mir nicht helfen, und es nützt nichts, daß er sie immer aufzureißen sucht, wovon er die aus{830}geprägten Stirnfalten hat, die erst an den Schläfen aufwärts und dann horizontal über seine Stirn laufen, – seine hohe, rote Stirn, wissen Sie, um die das weiße Haar zwar lang, aber spärlich steht, – die Augen bleiben doch klein und blaß, trotz allem Aufreißen. Und seine Schlußweste verleiht ihm was Geistliches, trotzdem der Gehrock kariert ist. Das ist mein Eindruck von heute morgen.«","""Please, please,"" said Hans Castorp condescendingly. ""And you?"" he thought. “How are you feeling? You're not completely uninvolved either, from before, if this and that doesn't deceive me, blue-cheeked widower with your graphic oil painting. Put all sorts of malicious joy in your words, it seems to me, and yet we are fellow sufferers, so to speak, with regard to Peeperkorn.' 'Curious man, decidedly original appearance,' he said with a projecting gesture. 'Sturdy and sparse, that's the impression one gets of it, at least that's what I got of it today at breakfast. Robust and again sparse, these are the adjectives that I think should be used to describe him, although they are usually not considered compatible. He is probably tall and broad and likes to stand there with his legs apart, his hands buried in his vertical trouser pockets - they are placed vertically with him, I had to notice, not on the sides, like with you and me and otherwise probably in the higher social classes -, and when it stands there and talks to the palate in the Dutch way, there's something undeniably robust about it. But his goatee is sparse - long, but sparse so that you think you can count the hairs, and his eyes are also only small and pale, almost without color, I can't help it, and it's no use that he keeps them trying to tear open, from which he has the embossed forehead lines that run first up the temples and then horizontally across his forehead - his high, red forehead, you know, with the white hair long but sparse standing around it, – the eyes remain small and pale, in spite of all the opening. And his waistcoat gives him something clerical, even though his frock coat is checked. That's my impression this morning.«","“Don’t mention it,” replied Hans Castorp, loftily. “And what about you?” he said to himself. “I wonder what your feelings are; you didn’t come off scot-free either, or I miss my guess, you blue-in-the-face widower, with your oil-painting technique. Old dog in the manger! You needn’t tell me: so far as Peeperkorn is concerned, I’m certain we’re companions in misery. ”—“Quaint creature,” he continued aloud, and shrugged. “An original, certainly. He’s so lean—yet he’s robust; that is the impression he makes, at least that’s the impression I got at breakfast. Lean, and robust, those are the adjectives, I think, though they aren’t commonly used together. He is certainly tall and broad, and likes to stand with his legs apart and his hands in his trouser pockets— which, I observe, are put in running up and down, not like yours and mine and most people’s of our class. And when he stands there and talks, in his guttural Dutch voice, there’s something unmistakably robust about him. But he has a sparse whisker , you could almost count the hairs; and his eyes are very small and pale, hardly any colour to them at all. He keeps trying to open them wide, and has made a lot of wrinkles, regular corrugations, that turn up on the temples and run straight across his forehead, and his forehead is high and red, with long wisps of white hair. He wears a clerical waist-coat, but his tail-coat is check. These are the impressions I got this morning.”","“To be sure, to be sure,” Hans Castorp replied superciliously. (“And what about you?” he thought. “How are you taking this? If I’m not sadly mistaken, you can’t be all that blasé, either, given what went on before, you purple-cheeked widower with your lifelike oils. A great deal of schadenfreude in your comments, it seems to me, and yet when it comes to Peeperkorn, we’re companions in misery, so to speak.”) “Odd duck, definitely an eccentric,” he said aloud with a dismissive shrug. “Robust and spare—at least that’s the impression I got from him this morning at breakfast. Robust and yet spare at the same time, those are the adjectives one would have to use to describe him, I believe, although the two terms usually don’t go together. He’s a tall, broad-shouldered man, to be sure, and likes to stand with his legs set wide apart, his hands buried in his trouser pockets—I couldn’t help noticing they’re sewn in vertically, instead of on the slant the way yours and mine are, the way pockets generally are in the better classes. And when he stands there carrying on in his guttural Dutch way, there is something undeniably robust about him. But his beard is sparse—long, but so sparse you feel as if you could count the hairs, and his eyes are quite small and pale, too, almost colorless—I simply can’t help it. And it doesn’t do any good when he tries to open them wide , it just gives him those deep creases that first extend up toward the temples and then spread horizontally across his brow. High, red brow, you know, in a circle of white hair—cut long, but sparse all the same. His eyes are small and pale, no matter how big he tries to make them. And that vest of his adds a clerical touch, despite the checkered frock coat. Those are my impressions from this morning.”"
"{261}»Selbstverständlich mit einem Thermometer«, antwortete Hans Castorp nicht ohne Spott und Strenge. »Die Oberin hat mir eines verkauft. Warum sie einen immer ›Menschenskind‹ anredet, das weiß ich nicht; korrekt ist es nicht. Aber ein sehr gutes Thermometer hat sie mir in aller Eile verkauft, und wenn du dich überzeugen willst, wieviel es zeigt, so liegt es da drinnen auf dem Waschtisch. Es ist eine minimale Erhöhung.«","{261}""Of course with a thermometer,"" replied Hans Castorp, not without mockery and severity. 'The matron sold me one. I don't know why she always addresses you as 'man'; it is not correct. But she sold me a very good thermometer in a hurry, and if you want to see for yourself how much it shows, it's in there on the washstand. It's a minimal increase.”","“With a thermometer, naturally,” answered Hans Castorp, not without a caustic tinge to his voice. “Frau Director sold me one. Why she should call me young ’un I can’t imagine. It is distinctly not comme il faut. But she lost no time in selling me an excellent thermometer; if you would like to convince yourself, you can; it is there on the wash-hand-stand. It is only slight fever.”","“With a thermometer, of course,” Hans Castorp replied, not without a mixture of severity and scorn. “The head nurse sold me one. Why she keeps saying ‘man alive,’ I really don’t know. It’s very slangy. But she did sell me a first-rate thermometer with utmost dispatch, and if you want to check for yourself what it read, you’ll find it in there on my washstand. It’s only slightly elevated.”"
"Seine Bewegung war mächtig. Er ging ein paarmal durch das Zimmer, das Thermometer in der Hand, wobei er es jedoch wagerecht hielt, um nicht durch senkrechte Erschütterung eine Störung hervorzurufen, legte es dann mit aller Bewahrsamkeit auf die Waschtischplatte nieder und ging vorerst einmal mit Paletot und Decken in die Liegekur. Sitzend warf er die Decken um sich, wie er es gelernt hatte, von den Seiten und von unten, eine nach der anderen, mit schon geübter Hand, und lag dann still, die Stunde des zweiten Frühstücks und Joachims Eintritt erwartend. Zuweilen lächelte er, und es war, als lächle er jemandem zu. Zuweilen hob sich seine Brust mit einem beklommenen Beben, und dann mußte er husten aus seiner katarrhalischen Brust.","His movement was powerful. He walked through the room a couple of times, the thermometer in his hand, but holding it level so as not to cause any disturbance from vertical vibrations, then carefully laid it down on the washstand and first went into the room with a pallet and blankets Rest cure. Sitting, he threw the blankets around him, as he had learned, from the sides and from below, one after the other, with a practiced hand, and then lay still, awaiting the hour of second breakfast and Joachim's entrance. Sometimes he smiled, and it was as if he were smiling at someone. Sometimes his chest heaved with an uneasy tremor, and then he would cough out of his catarrhal chest.","He was thoroughly upset. He walked the length of the room twice or thrice, the thermometer held horizontally in his hand, so as not to jiggle it and make it read differently. Then he carefully deposited it on the wash-hand-stand, and went with his overcoat and rugs into the balcony. Sitting down, he threw the covers about him, with practised hand, first from one side, then from the other, and lay still, waiting until it should be time for Joachim to fetch him for second breakfast. Now and then he smiled—it was precisely as though he smiled at somebody. And now and then his breast heaved as he caught his breath and was seized with his bronchial cough.","He was terribly agitated. He paced the room a few times, still holding the thermometer—horizontally, so as to not disturb the reading by some vertical shake. He then laid it as carefully as possible on the rim of his washstand and decided for now to put on his overcoat and finish his rest cure. He sat down, flung his blankets around him—just as he had learned, from both sides, from below, one after the other, with a skilled hand now—and lay still as he waited for the hour of second breakfast and Joachim’s arrival. Now and then he smiled, and it was as if he were smiling at someone. Now and then his chest gave an uneasy heave, and then he would have to cough his bronchial cough."
"»Was läßt sich da sagen, Herr Hofrat.

Such a close relative and such a good friend, and my comrade up here.' Hans Castorp gave a short sob and put one foot on tiptoe, turning the heel outward.","“What is there to say, Herr Hofrat?

"Es war jedoch kein rechtes und eigentliches Erwachen; er blinzelte nur, erleichtert, die Greuelweiber los zu sein, doch war es ihm sonst wenig deutlich, noch auch sehr wichtig, ob er an einer Tempelsäule liege oder an einem Schober, und er träumte gewissermaßen fort, – nicht mehr in Bildern, sondern gedankenweise, aber darum nicht weniger gewagt und kraus.","However, it was not a right and proper awakening; He just blinked, relieved to be rid of the abominable women, but otherwise it was not very clear to him, nor was it very important to him whether he was lying on a temple pillar or on a haystack, and he dreamed on, as it were - no longer in pictures, but in thoughts , but no less daring and frizzy.","It was no true awakening. He blinked his relief at being free from those execrable hags, but was not very clear, nor even greatly concerned, whether this was a hay-hut, or the column of a temple, against which he lay; and after a fashion continued to dream, no longer in pictures, but in thoughts hardly less involved and fantastic.","It was not a genuine awakening; he simply lay there blinking, relieved to be rid of those repulsive women, although it was less than clear to him, and not all that important, if it was a temple column or a hayshed at his back, and he went on dreaming, as it were—no longer in visions, but in thoughts hardly less perilous and tangled."
"»Nein, er erinnert sich nicht gern daran, daß es Zeiten gab, wo sein Bund all die Antipathie auf sich versammelte, die Freigeisterei, Atheismus, enzyklopädische Vernunft sonst dem Komplex von Kirche, Katholizismus, Mönch, Mittelalter zuwendete.

"»Jetzt faßt er mich am Handgelenk!« dachte er. »Na, lächerlich, was sitze ich da wie ein begossener Pudel! Habe ich mich schuldhaft vergangen gegen ihn? Keine Spur.

Have I done him any injury? Not in the least. Let him talk to the man in Daghestan before he does to me. And after that somebody else, and so on. And then me. And what has he to complain of about me? Nothing, so far. Then why should my heart be pounding like this? It is high time I sit up and look him in the eye—with all due respect to his personality, of course.”","“Now he’s grabbing my wrist,” he thought. “Well, how ridiculous for me to sit here with my tail tucked between my legs.

Hier griff Hans Castorp ein. Mit dem Mut der Einfalt mischte er sich ins Gespräch und äußerte ins Leere blickend:,"Here Hans Castorp intervened. With the courage of simplicity, he joined the conversation and said, looking into emptiness:","Here Hans Castorp put in his word.

"Während der Tage schwülster Erwartung, als eine wahre Streckfolter die Nerven Europas spannte, sah Hans Castorp Herrn Settembrini nicht. Die wüsten Zeitungen drangen nun unmittelbar aus der Tiefe zu seiner Balkonloge empor, durchzuckten das Haus, erfüllten mit ihrem die Brust beklemmenden Schwefelgeruch den Speisesaal und selbst die Zimmer der Schweren und Moribunden. Es waren jene Sekunden, wo der Siebenschläfer im Grase, nicht wissend, wie ihm geschah, sich langsam aufrichtete, bevor er saß und sich die Augen rieb … Wir wollen aber das Bild zu Ende führen, um seiner Gemüts{1079}bewegung gerecht zu werden. Er zog die Beine unter sich, stand auf, blickte um sich. Er sah sich entzaubert, erlöst, befreit, – nicht aus eigener Kraft, wie er sich mit Beschämung gestehen mußte, sondern an die Luft gesetzt von elementaren Außenmächten, denen seine Befreiung sehr nebensächlich mit unterlief. Aber wenn auch sein kleines Schicksal vor dem allgemeinen verschwand, – drückte nicht dennoch etwas von persönlich gemeinter und also von göttlicher Güte und Gerechtigkeit sich darin aus? Nahm das Leben sein sündiges Sorgenkind noch einmal an, – nicht auf wohlfeile Art, sondern eben nur so, auf diese ernste und strenge Art, im Sinn einer Heimsuchung, die vielleicht nicht Leben, aber gerade in diesem Falle drei Ehrensalven für ihn, den Sünder, bedeutete, konnte es geschehen. Und so sank er denn auf seine Knie hin, Gesicht und Hände zu einem Himmel erhoben, der schweflig dunkel, aber nicht länger die Grottendecke des Sündenberges war.","During the days of sultry anticipation, when a veritable stretching torture strained the nerves of Europe, Hans Castorp did not see Mr. Settembrini. The wild newspapers now rushed straight up from the depths to his balcony box, shuddered through the house, filled the dining room and even the rooms of the heavy and moribund with their oppressive smell of sulfur. It was those seconds when the dormouse slowly sat up in the grass, not knowing what was happening to him, before he sat and rubbed his eyes ... But we want to finish the picture in order to do justice to his emotional {1079}movement . He pulled his legs under him, stood up, looked around. He saw himself disenchanted, redeemed, liberated - not by his own efforts, as he was embarrassed to admit, but thrown into the open by elementary external powers, to which his liberation was very incidentally involved. But even if his petty destiny disappeared before the general one, did it not nevertheless express something of personal and therefore of divine goodness and justice? Life accepted its sinful problem child once more - not in a cheap way, but only like that, in this serious and severe way, in the sense of a visitation, which may not live, but in this case three salvos of honor for him, the sinner , meant it could happen. And so he fell to his knees, face and hands raised to a sky that was sulphurous dark but no longer the grotto ceiling of Sin Mountain.","During those days of stifling expectation, when the nerves of Europe were on the rack, Hans Castorp did not see Herr Settembrini. The newspapers with their wild, chaotic contents pressed up out of the depths to his very balcony, they disorganized the house, filled the dining-room with their sulphurous, stifling breath, even penetrated the chambers of the dying. These were the moments when the “SevenSleeper,” not knowing what had happened, was slowly stirring himself in the grass, before he sat up, rubbed his eyes— yes, let us carry the figure to the end, in order to do justice to the movement of our hero’s mind : he drew up his legs, stood up, looked about him. He saw himself released, freed from enchantment—not of his own motion, he was fain to confess, but by the operation of exterior powers, of whose activities his own liberation was a minor incident indeed! Yet though his tiny destiny fainted to nothing in the face of the general, was there not some hint of a personal mercy and grace for him, a manifestation of divine goodness and justice? Would Life receive again her erring and “delicate” child—not by a cheap and easy slipping back to her arms, but sternly, solemnly, penitentially—perhaps not even among the living, but only with three salvoes fired over the grave of him a sinner? Thus might he return. He sank on his knees, raising face and hands to a heaven that howsoever dark and sulphurous was no longer the gloomy grotto of his state of sin.","During the days of stifling suspense, while Europe’s nerves were stretched on the rack, Hans Castorp did not go to see Herr Settembrini. The wild headlines from below now found their way directly to his balcony door, they sent the Berghof into spasms, filled the dining hall with an odor of sulfur that constricted the chest, seeping even into the rooms of the bedridden and moribund. And it was during those same moments that our sleeper slowly began to sit up in the grass, not knowing what had happened, not rubbing his eyes yet . . . and let us draw the metaphor out in full, so that we may be just to the rush of his emotions. He drew his legs back under him, stood up, looked around. He saw that the enchantment was broken, that he was released, set free—not by his own actions, as he had to admit to his shame, but set free by elementary external forces, for whom his liberation was a very irrelevant matter. But even if his little fate shrank to nothing before universal destiny, was it not, all the same, an expression of some goodness and justice intended personally for him, and thus in some way divine? If life was to receive back her sinful problem child, it could not happen on the cheap, but only like this, in a serious, rigorous fashion, as a kind of ordeal, which in this case did not perhaps mean life so much as it meant three salvos fired in his, the sinner’s, honor. And so he sank back down on his knees, his face and hands raised toward a heaven darkened by sulfurous fumes, but no longer the grotto ceiling in a sinful mountain of delight."
"»Es müssen wohl Takt- und Geschmacksgründe sein,« sagte er, »die ihn dazu bestimmen. Ich nehme an, er verbessert sein antikapitalistisches Gewissen, indem er die Zimmer eines Armen bewohnt, und sich schadlos hält durch die Art, wie er sie bewohnt. Auch Diskretion wird im Spiele sein. Man bindet es den Leuten nicht auf die Nase, wie gut einen der Teufel {618}von hinten versorgt. Man schützt eine recht unscheinbare Fassade vor und entfaltet dahinter seinen seidenen Priestergeschmack …«","'There must be reasons of tact and taste,' he said, 'that make him do it. I suppose he improves his anti-capitalist conscience by occupying a poor man's room, and indemnifies himself by the manner in which he occupies it. Discretion will also come into play. You don't tell people how well the devil {618}takes care of you from behind. You put up a rather inconspicuous facade and develop your silky priestly taste behind it …«","“He is probably guided by considerations of taste and tact,” he said “I imagine he salves his anti-capitalistic conscience by living in a poor house, and indemnifies himself by living in the style he keeps. And I should say that discretion plays some role in the affair too. No use advertising to all the world how well the Devil takes care of his own. He shows an unpretentious façade, and behind it gives free rein to tastes— such as a prince of the Church—”","“He must have his reasons,” he said. “Perhaps it’s a matter of tact, or taste. I assume it eases his anticapitalist conscience to dwell in poor man’s quarters, and that he compensates for it by the style in which he lives. Discretion probably plays a role as well. It’s best not to flaunt the fact that the Devil is paying all your bills. You put on a nice unpretentious façade, and then behind it indulge your priestly penchant for silk.”"

"Hans Castorps Woche lief hier von Dienstag bis Dienstag, denn an einem Dienstag war er ja angekommen. Daß er im Bureau seine zweite Wochenrechnung beglichen hatte, lag schon ein paar Tage zurück, – die bescheidene Wochenrechnung von rund 160 Franken, bescheiden und billig nach seinem Urteil, {246}selbst wenn man die Unbezahlbarkeiten des hiesigen Aufenthalts, eben ihrer Unbezahlbarkeit wegen, überhaupt nicht in Anschlag brachte, auch nicht gewisse Darbietungen, die wohl berechenbar gewesen wären, wenn man gewollt hätte, wie zum Exempel die vierzehntägige Kurmusik und die Vorträge Dr. Krokowskis, sondern allein und ausschließlich die eigentliche Bewirtung und gasthausmäßige Leistung, das bequeme Logis, die fünf übergewaltigen Mahlzeiten.","Hans Castorp's week here ran from Tuesday to Tuesday, because he had arrived on a Tuesday. It had been a few days since he had settled his second weekly bill in the office - the modest weekly bill of around 160 francs, modest and reasonable in his opinion, {246}even if one considers the unaffordability of the stay here, precisely because of its unaffordability, did not take into account at all, not even certain performances that would have been predictable if one had wanted to, such as the fortnightly spa music and the lectures by Dr. Krokowskis, but alone and exclusively the actual hospitality and inn-like service, the comfortable lodging, the five overwhelming meals.","HANS CASTORP’S week here ran from Tuesday to Tuesday, for on a Tuesday he had arrived. Two or three days before, he had gone down to the office and paid his second weekly bill, a modest account of a round one hundred and sixty francs, modest and cheap enough, even without taking into consideration the nature of some of the advantages of a stay up here—advantages priceless in themselves, though for that very reason they could not be included in the bill—and even without counting extras like the fortnightly concert and Dr. Krokowski’s lectures, which might conceivably have been included. The sum of one hundred and sixty francs represented simply and solely the actual hospitality extended by the Berghof to Hans Castorp: his comfortable lodgment and his five stupendous meals.","Hans Castorp’s week here ran from Tuesday to Tuesday, because it was on a Tuesday that he had arrived. A few days had passed since he had gone down to the office and paid his bill for the second week—the modest weekly sum of 160 francs.

The bill was solely for room and board, for the basic services of the hotel—comfortable lodging and five prodigious meals."

"{158}Das mit den zwanzig Grad Kälte bezweifelte Hans Castorp, denn ihn fror entschieden, Schauer überliefen ihn wiederholt, während er durch die Holzbögen in die sickernde, nieselnde Nässe dort draußen blickte, die jeden Augenblick auf dem Punkte schien, wieder in Schneefall überzugehen. Wie sonderbar übrigens, daß er bei all der Feuchtigkeit immer noch so trockenhitzige Backen hatte, als säße er in einem überheizten Zimmer. Auch fühlte er sich lächerlich angegriffen von den Übungen mit den Decken, – wahrhaftig, »Ocean steamships« zitterte ihm in den Händen, sobald er es vor die Augen führte. So überaus gesund war er doch eben auch nicht, – total anämisch, wie Hofrat Behrens gesagt hatte, und deswegen neigte er wohl auch so zum Froste. Die unangenehmen Empfindungen jedoch wurden aufgewogen durch die große Bequemlichkeit seiner Lage, die schwer zu zergliedernden und fast geheimnisvollen Eigenschaften des Liegestuhles, die Hans Castorp beim ersten Versuche schon mit höchstem Beifall empfunden hatte, und die sich wieder und wieder aufs glücklichste bewährten. Lag es an der Beschaffenheit der Polster, der richtigen Neigung der Rückenlehne, der passenden Höhe und Breite der Armstützen oder auch nur der zweckmäßigen Konsistenz der Nackenrolle, genug, es konnte für das Wohlsein ruhender Glieder überhaupt nicht humaner gesorgt sein, als durch diesen vorzüglichen Liegestuhl. Und so war denn Zufriedenheit in Hans Castorps Herzen darüber, daß zwei leere und sicher gefriedete Stunden vor ihm lagen, diese durch die Hausordnung geheiligten Stunden der Hauptliegekur, die er, obgleich nur zu Gaste hier oben, als eine ihm ganz gemäße Einrichtung empfand. Denn er war geduldig von Natur, konnte lange ohne Beschäftigung wohl bestehen und liebte, wie wir uns erinnern, die freie Zeit, die von betäubender Tätigkeit nicht vergessen gemacht, verzehrt und verscheucht wird. Um vier erfolgte der Vespertee mit Kuchen und Eingemachtem, etwas Bewegung im {159}Freien sodann, hierauf abermals Ruhe im Stuhl, um sieben das Abendessen, welches, wie überhaupt die Mahlzeiten, gewisse Spannungen und Sehenswürdigkeiten mit sich brachte, auf die man sich freuen konnte, danach ein oder der andere Blick in den stereoskopischen Guckkasten, das kaleidoskopische Fernrohr und die kinematographische Trommel … Hans Castorp hatte den Tageslauf bereits am Schnürchen, wenn es auch viel zu viel gesagt wäre, daß er schon »eingelebt«, wie man es nennt, gewesen sei.","{158}Hans Castorp had doubts about the twenty degrees of cold, because he was definitely cold, shivers ran over him repeatedly while he looked through the wooden arches at the seeping, drizzled wetness out there, which seemed about to turn to snowfall at any moment . How strange, by the way, that despite all the dampness his cheeks were still dry and hot, as if he were sitting in an overheated room. He also felt ridiculously offended by the exercises with the blankets - indeed, ""Ocean steamships"" trembled in his hands as soon as he laid it before his eyes. He wasn't all that healthy after all - totally anemic, as Councilor Behrens had said, and that's probably why he was so prone to chills. The unpleasant sensations, however, were outweighed by the great comfort of its position, the almost mysterious properties of the lounge chair, which are difficult to analyze and which Hans Castorp had already felt with the greatest applause at the first attempt, and which proved themselves happily again and again. Whether it was the quality of the upholstery, the right inclination of the backrest, the right height and width of the armrests, or even just the appropriate consistency of the neck roll, enough, the well-being of resting limbs could not be taken care of more humanely than by this excellent deck chair . And so there was contentment in Hans Castorp's heart that two empty and safely peaceful hours lay ahead of him, these hours of the main rest cure, sanctified by the house rules, which he, although only a guest up here, found to be quite suitable for him. For he was patient by nature, could survive for a long time without employment and, as we remember, loved his free time, which is not forgotten, consumed and chased away by numbing activity. At four o'clock there was Vesper tea with cake and preserves, then some exercise outdoors, then rest in the chair again, at seven supper, which, like meals in general, brought with it certain tensions and sights to look forward to then one or the other look into the stereoscopic peep box, the kaleidoscopic telescope and the cinematographic drum ... Hans Castorp already had the daily routine under his belt, even if it would be saying much too much that he had already ""settled in"", as it is called , has been.","That about the ten below zero Hans Castorp doubted; he was even now distinctly cold. He shivered repeatedly as he lay looking out through the wooden arch at the reeking, dripping damp outside, which seemed on the point of passing over into snow. It was strange that with all that humidity his cheeks still burned with a dry heat, as though he were sitting in an over-heated room. He felt absurdly tired from the practice of putting on his rugs; actually, as he held up Ocean Steamships to read it, the book shook in his hands. So very fit he certainly was not—and totally anæmic, as Hofrat Behrens had said; this, no doubt, was why he was so susceptible to cold. But such unpleasing sensations were outweighed by the great comfort of his position, the unanalysable, the almost mysterious properties of his reclining-chair, which he had applauded even on his first experience of it, and which reasserted themselves in the happiest way whenever he resorted to it anew. Whether due to the character of the upholstering, the inclination of the chair-back, the exactly proper width and height of the arms, or only to the appropriate consistency of the neck roll, the result was that no more comfortable provision for relaxed limbs could be conceived than that purveyed by this excellent chair. The heart of Hans Castorp rejoiced in the blessed fact that two vacant and securely tranquil hours lay before him, dedicated by the rules of the house to the principal cure of the day; he felt it—though himself but a guest up here—to be a most suitable arrangement. For he was by nature and temperament passive, could sit without occupation hours on end, and loved, as we know, to see time spacious before him, and not to have the sense of its passing banished, wiped out or eaten up by prosaic activity. At four o’clock he partook of afternoon tea, with cake and jam. Followed a little movement in the open air, then rest again, then supper—which, like all the other meal-times, afforded a certain stimulus for eye and brain, and a certain sense of strain; after that a peep into one or other of the optical toys, the stereoscope, the kaleidoscope, the cinematograph. It might be still too much to say that Hans Castorp had grown used to the life up here; but at least he did have the daily routine at his fingers’ ends.","Hans Castorp doubted what he had said about five below, because he was definitely freezing, and he kept shivering as he gazed through the wooden arches into the damp, trickling drizzle out there, which seemed to threaten to turn to snow again at any moment. How strange, too, that despite the wet, his cheeks still felt so hot and dry, as if he were sitting in an overheated room. And he felt absurdly frazzled from the practice session with his blankets—in fact, when he now looked down at Ocean Steamships, it lay trembling in his hands. He was not so terribly healthy after all—totally anemic, just as Director Behrens had said, and that was probably why he tended to chill so easily. These unpleasant sensations, however, were counterbalanced by the comfortable position furnished by the lounge chair and its almost mysterious properties, which Hans Castorp found difficult to analyze but which had found his highest approval from the very first and had stood the test again and again. Whether it was the texture of the cushions, the perfect slant of the back support, the proper height and width of the armrests, or simply the practical consistency of the neck roll—whatever it was, nothing could possibly have offered more humane benefits for a body at rest than this splendid lounge chair. And so Hans Castorp’s heart was filled with contentment at the thought that before him lay two empty, safely serene hours: the main rest cure, sacred to the rules of the house. Although he was only a visiting guest up here, he, too, found it to be a very suitable arrangement. For he was a patient man by nature, who could spend long hours doing nothing in particular and loved, as we recall, his leisure time, with no numbing activity to demolish, banish, or overwhelm it. At four there would be afternoon tea with cake and preserves, followed by a little exercise outdoors, and then he would come back up here to rest in the lounge chair again, with supper at seven—which, like all the meals, brought with it certain sights and tensions that he looked forward to—and afterward a peep or two into the stereoscopic viewer, the kaleidoscopic tube, or the cinematographic drum. Hans Castorp had the daily schedule down pat, though it would perhaps be too much to say that he had now “settled in,” as the expression goes."
"»Ja, ich werde also allerseits grüßen,« erwiderte Hans Castorp, »und sagen, daß du spätestens in fünf Monaten nachkommst. Erholt? Du meinst, ob ich mich erholt habe in diesen paar Tagen? Das will ich doch annehmen. Eine gewisse Erholung muß selbst in so kurzer Zeit doch am Ende wohl stattgefunden haben. Allerdings waren es ja so neuartige Eindrücke hier oben, neuartig in jeder Beziehung, sehr anregend, aber auch anstrengend für den Geist und den Körper, ich habe nicht das Gefühl, mit ihnen schon fertig geworden zu sein und mich akklimatisiert zu haben, was doch wohl die Vorbedingung aller Erholung wäre. Maria ist gottlob die alte, seit einigen Tagen bin ich ihr wieder auf den Geschmack gekommen. Aber von Zeit zu Zeit wird immer noch mein Taschentuch rot, wenn ich es benutze, und die verdammte Hitze im Gesicht mitsamt dem sinnlosen Herzklopfen werde ich auch, wie es scheint, bis zum Schluß nicht mehr loswerden. Nein, nein, von Akklimatisation kann man bei mir nicht gut reden, wie sollte man auch nach so kurzer Zeit. Da brauchte es länger, um sich hier zu akklimatisieren und mit den Eindrücken fertig zu werden, und dann könnte die Erholung beginnen und das Ansetzen von Eiweiß. Schade. Ich sage ›schade‹, weil es entschieden fehlerhaft war, daß ich mir nicht mehr Zeit für diesen Aufenthalt vorbehielt, – zur Verfügung wär sie ja schließlich gewesen. So ist mir zumute, als ob ich mich zu Hause im Flachland vor allem einmal von der Erholung werde erholen müssen und drei Wochen schlafen, so abgearbeitet komme ich mir manchmal vor. Und nun kommt ja ärgerlicherweise dieser Katarrh hinzu …«","""Yes, so I'll say hello to everyone,"" replied Hans Castorp, ""and tell you that you'll be back in five months at the latest. recovered? You mean have I recovered in these few days? I will accept that. A certain recovery must have taken place in the end, even in such a short time. Admittedly, the impressions up here were so new, new in every respect, very stimulating, but also exhausting for the mind and body, I don't have the feeling that I've finished with them and that I haven't acclimatized, what can I do would be the precondition of all recovery. Thank God Maria is the old one, a few days ago I got a taste for her again. But my handkerchief still turns red from time to time when I use it, and I can't seem to shake the damn heat in my face and senseless pounding heart until the end either. No, no, you can't speak well of acclimatization with me, how should you even after such a short time. It took longer to acclimatize here and to cope with the impressions, and then the recovery could begin and the protein build-up. Too bad. I say 'a pity' because it was definitely wrong that I didn't reserve more time for this stay - after all, it would have been available. So I feel as if at home in the lowlands I will have to recover from my rest and sleep for three weeks, I sometimes feel so exhausted. And now, annoyingly enough, this catarrh is added...""","“I’ll remember you to everybody,” Hans Castorp responded, “and say you are coming back in five months at the outside. Done me good? If it has done me good to be up here? I should like to think so; some improvement must surely have taken place, even in this short time. I have received a great many new impressions, new in every sense of the word; very stimulating, but a good deal of strain too, physically and mentally. I have not at all the feeling of having really got acclimatized—which would certainly be the first necessary step toward improvement. Maria, thank goodness, is her old self; for several days now, I have been able to get the aroma. But my handkerchief still becomes red from time to time when I use it—and this damned heat in my face, and these idiotic palpitations, I shall apparently have them up to the last minute. No, it seems I can’t talk about being acclimatized—how could I, either, in so short a time? It would take longer than this to overcome the change of atmosphere and adjust oneself perfectly to the unusual conditions, so that a real recovery could begin and I should commence to put on flesh. It is too bad. It was certainly a mistake not to have given myself more time—for of course I could have had it. I have the feeling that once I am at home again I shall need to sleep three weeks on end to get rested from the rest I’ve had! That shows you how tired I sometimes feel. And now, to cap the climax, I get this catarrh—”","“Yes, and I’ll give everyone your greetings,” Hans Castorp replied, “and tell them that you’ll follow in five months at the most. Recuperated? You’re asking if I’m feeling better after these few days, is that it? I would certainly like to think so. A certain amount of relaxation probably comes just by itself even after a short time. Although there were a lot of novel things to experience up here, novel in every regard, very exciting, but also very taxing to both mind and body. I don’t have the feeling that I’ve quite got used to it all yet and acclimatized myself, although that would be a precondition for any real recuperation. Maria is back to her old self, thank God, she’s been tasting good for several days now. But from time to time my handkerchief shows a little red when I use it, and it doesn’t look as if I’m going to be rid of either this damn flushed face or this silly pounding in my heart before I leave. No, no, you can’t really say I’ve acclimatized myself, but how could anyone in such a short time? It takes longer to get acclimatized here, to get used to all these new impressions. It’s only then that you can begin to recuperate and build up protein. And that’s a shame, because it was definitely a mistake for me not to have arranged for a longer stay—more time certainly would have been available. I feel as if once I’m back home in the flatlands I’m going to have to recuperate from my recuperation and sleep for three weeks, that’s how run-down I feel sometimes. And then to top it all there ’s this catarrh I’ve caught.”"
"Durch Vermittlung Schwester Alfredas erlangten sie Eintritt in das Sterbezimmer, das im ersten Stock unter ihren eigenen Zimmern gelegen war. Die Witwe empfing sie, eine kleine, zerzauste, von Nachtwachen mitgenommene Blonde, das Taschentuch vor dem Munde, mit roter Nase und in dickem Plaidmantel, dessen Kragen sie aufgestellt hatte, denn es war sehr kalt im Zimmer. Die Heizung war abgestellt, die Balkontür offen. Gedämpft sagten die jungen Leute das Erforderliche und gingen dann, durch eine Handbewegung schmerzlich eingeladen, durch das Zimmer zum Bett, – mit ehrerbietig vorwärts wiegenden Schritten gingen sie, ohne Benutzung der Stiefelabsätze, und standen in Betrachtung am Lager des Toten, ein jeder nach seiner Art: Joachim dienstlich geschlossen, in salutierender Halbverbeugung, Hans Castorp gelöst und versunken, die Hände vor sich gekreuzt, den Kopf auf der Schulter, mit einer Miene, ähnlich derjenigen, mit der er Musik zu hören pflegte. Des Herrenreiters Kopf lag hoch gebettet, so daß der Körper, dieser lange Aufbau und vielfache Zeugungskreis des Lebens, mit der Erhöhung der Füße am Ende unter der Decke, desto flacher, fast brettartig flach erschien. Ein Blumengewinde lag in der Gegend der Knie, und der daraus hervorragende Palmzweig berührte die großen, gelben, knöchernen Hände, die auf der eingefallenen Brust gefaltet waren. Gelb und knöchern war auch das Gesicht mit dem kahlen Schädel, der gehöckerten Nase, den scharfen Backenknochen und dem buschigen, rotblonden Schnurrbart, dessen Dicke die grauen, stoppligen Höhlen der Wangen noch stärker vertiefte. Die Augen waren auf eine gewisse unnatürlich feste Weise geschlossen, – zugedrückt, mußte Hans Castorp denken, nicht zugemacht: den letzten Liebesdienst nannte man das, obgleich es im Sinne {444}der Überlebenden mehr, als um des Toten willen geschah. Auch mußte es beizeiten, gleich nach dem Tode geschehen; denn wenn erst die Myosinbildung in den Muskeln vorgeschritten war, so ging es nicht mehr, und er lag und starrte, und um die sinnige Vorstellung des »Schlummers« war es getan.","Through the mediation of Sister Alfreda, they gained entry to the death room, which was on the first floor below their own rooms. The widow received her, a little, disheveled blonde who had been taken away by night watches, handkerchief over her mouth, with a red nose and in a thick plaid coat, the collar of which she had turned up because it was very cold in the room. The heating was turned off, the balcony door open. In a low voice the young people said what was necessary, and then, painfully invited by a gesture of the hand, they went across the room to the bed - with reverentially rocking steps they walked forward, not using the heels of their boots, and stood contemplating the dead man's bed, each one after his own Art: Joachim formally closed, in a saluting half-bow, Hans Castorp relaxed and absorbed, hands crossed in front of him, head on his shoulder, with an expression similar to that with which he used to listen to music. The gentleman's head lay high on the bed, so that the body, this long structure and multiple cycle of generation of life, with the raised feet at the end under the blanket, appeared all the flatter, almost flat like a board. A garland of flowers lay near the knees, and the palm branch protruding from it touched the large, yellow, bony hands that were clasped on the sunken breast. Yellow and bony was also the face with the bald skull, the bumpy nose, the sharp cheekbones and the bushy, reddish-blond mustache, the thickness of which deepened the grey, stubbly cavities of the cheeks even more. The eyes were closed in a certain unnaturally firm way - squeezed shut, Hans Castorp had to think, not closed: that was called the last act of love, although it was done more for the sake of the survivors than for the sake of the dead. It also had to be done in good time, immediately after death; for once the formation of myosin in the muscles had progressed, it was no longer possible, and he lay and stared, and the thoughtful idea of ""sleep"" was done.","Sister Berta arranged that they be admitted to the gentleman rider’s room, which lay in the first storey beneath their own. The widow received them—a small, distracted blonde, much reduced by night watching, with a red nose, her handkerchief before her mouth, and wearing a plaid cloak, with the collar turned up, as it was very cold in the room. The heat was turned off, the balcony door stood open. The young people said what was fitting to say, in voices respectfully subdued; then, upon a woeful gesture from the widow, they passed through the room to the bed, walking on their tiptoes and weaving reverently forward. They stood by the dead, each after his fashion: Joachim with heels together, half inclined in a salute, Hans Castorp relaxed and pensive, with hands clasped before him and head on one side, much as he often stood to listen to music. The gentleman rider lay with his head pillowed high, so that his body, that elongated structure, the outgrowth of life’s manifold processes, with the elevation of the feet at the end beneath the sheet, looked very flat, almost like a board. A garland of flowers lay at about the knees; a palm-leaf outstanding from it touched the great, yellow, bony hands resting crossed upon the sunken breast. Yellow and bony was the face too, with its bald skull and hooked nose, its angular cheek-bones and bushy, reddish-yellow moustaches, whose full curve gave the grey and stubbly hollows of the cheeks a yet hollower look. The eyes were closed, with a certain unnatural definiteness—pressed down, not shut, thought Hans Castorp. That was what they called the last service of love; but it happened rather as a service to the survivors than to the dead. And it must be done betimes too, soon after death; for if the myosin process went far in the muscles, it would be too late, he would lie there and stare and one could no longer sustain the illusion of his slumber.","Through the good offices of Sister Berta they were admitted to the dead man’s room, which was on the second floor, directly under their own. His widow received them—a small, disheveled blond, frazzled from long nights of watching, pressing a handkerchief to her lips and red nose and wearing a plaid winter coat with the collar turned up, because it was very cold in the room. The heat had been turned off, the door to the balcony was open. The young men said what had to be said in muffled tones, and then, waved forward by an agonized gesture, they stepped across the room with a reverential, forward rocking motion, the heels of their boots never touching the ground, and stood there regarding the dead man on his bed, each in his own way—Joachim at attention, half bowing in an official, reserved pose; Hans Castorp relaxed and preoccupied, his hands clasped before him, his head tilted to one shoulder, with an expression much like the one he usually wore when listening to music. The horseman’s head was still propped up so that his body—its long frame once the site of life’s ceaseless breeding—looked all the flatter,. almost like a plank, with a slight rise in the blanket from the feet at the other end. A wreath lay in the vicinity of the knees, with a palm frond projecting from it and grazing the large, yellow, bony hands folded across the sunken chest. The face, too, was yellow and bony, with a hooked nose, sharp cheekbones, and a bushy, reddish-blond moustache, so thick that it made the cheeks look even hollower. The eyes were closed unnaturally tight—pressed closed, Hans Castorp could not help thinking, not just closed. They called that the last token of love, although it was done more for the sake of the survivors than of the dead man. And it had to be done very soon, because once too much myosin had formed in the muscles, it was no longer possible, and then he would lie there staring—and that was the end of the sedate notion of “slumber.”"
"{948}»Recht hab ich, wie immer«, gab Behrens sich selbst zur Antwort. »Und eh Sie mir hier das Gift der Reichsverdrossenheit verbreiten, Sie mißvergnügter Staatsbürger, sollen Sie doch sehen, daß Sie durchaus nicht von Gott und Welt verlassen sind, sondern daß die Obrigkeit ein Auge auf Sie hat, ein unverwandtes Auge, mein Lieber, und rastlos auf Ihre Divertierung bedacht ist. Der alte Behrens ist auch noch da. Na, nun mal ohne Spaß mein Junge! Es ist mir was eingefallen in Ihrer Sache, ich hab mir, weiß Gott, in schlaflosen Nächten für Sie was ausgedacht. Man könnte von einer Erleuchtung reden – tatsächlich versprech ich mir viel von meiner Idee, das heißt nicht mehr und nicht weniger, als Ihre Entgiftung und triumphale Heimkehr in ungeahnter Bälde.«","{948}""I'm right, as always,"" answered Behrens himself. ""And before you spread the poison of disenchantment with the Reich, you discontented citizen, you should see that you are by no means abandoned by God and the world, but that the authorities have an eye on you, a steady eye, my dear, and restlessly focused on your divergence. The old Behrens is still there too. Well, no kidding, my boy! Something occurred to me about your case, God knows, I thought it up for you during sleepless nights. One could speak of an enlightenment - in fact I have high hopes for my idea, that means nothing more and nothing less than your detoxification and triumphant homecoming in an unexpectedly short time.«","“Right, then, of course, as I always am,” Behrens answered himself. “Well, I can’t have you spreading the toxin of your disaffection all over my community, you disgruntled citizen, you. I must convince you that you are not forgotten of God and man, that the powers above have an eye, an unchanging eye upon you, and ceaselessly ponder your welfare. Old Behrens hasn’t forsaken you yet, my lad. Well, joking aside, I’ve been thinking about your case, and in the watches of the night something has come to me. I might almost speak of a revelation—in short, I promise great things from my new idea, nothing more nor less than your complete cure and triumphal progress down to the flat-land, before you can say Jack Robinson.”","“I’m right, as always, “ Behrens said, answering his own question. “And before you start spreading the poison of imperial tedium, my malcontent citizen, you’re going to see that God and man have not deserted you and that medical authority has an eye on you, an unblinking eye, my good man, that its one ceaseless concern is your diversion. Old man Behrens is still here, after all. Well, all joking aside, my boy, I have an idea about your case. I’ve spent, God knows, sleepless nights coming up with it. You might even call it a revelation—and indeed I see my idea as holding great promise: no more and no less than an unexpectedly speedy detoxification and triumphant return home."
"Settembrini ging nämlich jetzt dazu über, Herrn Naphta Erläuterungen über die Vettern zu geben, wobei sich übrigens zeigte, daß er ihm schon früher von ihnen erzählt hatte. Dies sei also der junge Ingenieur mit den drei Wochen, bei dem Hofrat Behrens eine feuchte Stelle gefunden habe, sagte er, und dies hier jene Hoffnung der preußischen Heeresorganisation, Leutnant Ziemßen. Und er sprach von Joachims Gemütsempörung und Reiseplänen, um hinzuzufügen, daß man dem Ingenieur zweifellos zu nahe treten würde, wenn man ihm nicht dieselbe Ungeduld zuschriebe, zur Arbeit zurückzukehren.","Settembrini now proceeded to explain M. Naphta about the cousins, which, moreover, showed that he had told him about them before. So this was the three-week-old young engineer with whom Hofrat Behrens had found a sore spot, he said, and this was the hope of the Prussian army organization, Lieutenant Ziemssen. And he spoke of Joachim's indignation and travel plans, to add that the engineer would doubtless be offended if he were not credited with the same impatience to return to work.","Settembrini went on to explain the cousins to Herr Naphta, whereby it came out that he had already spoken of them. Here, he said, was the young engineer who had come up on three weeks’ leave, only to have Herr Hofrat Behrens find a moist place in his lung; and here was that hope of the Prussian army organization, Lieutenant Ziemssen. He spoke of Joachim’s revolt and intended departure, and added that one must not insult the Engineer by imputing to him any less zealous desire to return to his interrupted labours.","Settembrini now went on to offer Herr Naphta some information about the cousins, from which it became apparent that he had previously told him about these young men. This, then, was the young engineer who had come to visit for three weeks, only to have Director Behrens discover a moist spot; and this young hope of the Prussian military was Lieutenant Ziemssen. And he spoke of Joachim’s general disgust and plans to depart—and made sure to add that one would doubtless be doing the engineer a disservice if one did not ascribe to him the same impatience to return to his work."
"Sie lachten über ihren Irrtum, lachten vor Freude über das Wunder vor ihren Augen, diese lieblich zaghafte und nachahmende Anpassung des zuerst sich wieder hervorgetrauenden organischen Lebens. Sie pflückten davon, betrachteten und untersuchten die zarten Bechergebilde, schmückten ihre Knopflöcher damit, trugen sie heim, stellten sie in die Wassergläser auf ihren Zimmern; denn die unorganische Starre des Tales war lang gewesen, – lang, wenn auch kurzweilig.","They laughed at their mistake, laughed with joy at the wonder before their eyes, this lovely, timid and imitative adaptation of organic life, which at first dared to emerge again. They plucked them, looked at and examined the delicate cup shapes, decorated their buttonholes with them, carried them home, and put them in the water glasses in their rooms; for the inorganic rigidity of the valley had been long--long, though short-lived.","The cousins smiled at the deception, and for joy at the wonder before their eyes—at this timorous and lovely assumption of protective coloration, as it were, on the part of these first shy returning motions of organic life. They picked some of the flowers, studied the structure of their charming cups, and stuck them in their buttonholes; wore them home and put them in glasses on their stands; for the deathly torpor of the winter had lasted long indeed—however short it had seemed.","They laughed at their mistake, laughed for joy at the miracle before their eyes, this charming mimicry of snow by organic life hesitantly finding its way back into the world. They picked a few, examined them, studied their delicate chalices, made boutonnieres of them, wore them home, put them in water glasses in their rooms—for the valley’s inorganic paralysis had lasted a long, long time, despite its diversions."
»Sie meinen –«,"""They mean -""",“In what sense do you—”,“By which you mean?”
"{774}»Dennoch,« setzte Naphta nach einer Pause hinzu, »möchte ich Ihnen raten, diesen Mann und seine Sache nicht allzu leicht zu nehmen, möchte Sie, da wir denn einmal von diesen Verhältnissen reden, geradezu ersuchen, auf Ihrer Hut zu sein. Das Abgeschmackte ist noch nicht gleichbedeutend mit dem Unschuldigen. Die Beschränktheit braucht nicht harmlos zu sein. Diese Leute haben viel Wasser in ihren Wein getan, der zuzeiten feurig war, aber die Idee des Bundes selbst bleibt stark genug, um viel Verwässerung zu vertragen; sie bewahrt Reste von fruchtbarem Geheimnis, und es ist ebensowenig daran zu zweifeln, daß die Logen ihre Hand im Weltspiel haben, wie daß man in diesem liebenswürdigen Herrn Settembrini mehr zu sehen hat, als eben nur ihn selbst, daß Mächte hinter ihm stehen, deren Verwandter und Emissär er ist …«","{774}""Nevertheless,"" added Naphta after a pause, ""I would like to advise you not to take this man and his cause too lightly, I would like to ask you, since we are talking about these circumstances, to be on your guard being. The absurd is not yet synonymous with the innocent. The limitation need not be harmless. These people have put much water in their wine, which was fiery at times, but the idea of the covenant itself remains strong enough to bear much dilution; it preserves remnants of fruitful secrets, and there is just as little doubt that the lodges have a hand in the world game as that there is more to be seen in this amiable Herr Settembrini than just himself, that there are powers behind him, theirs Relative and emissary he is...""","“And yet,” Naphta added, after a pause, “I would counsel you not to take this man and what he stands for as altogether a laughing matter; since we are on the subject, let me warn you to be on your guard. The insipid is not synonymous with the harmless. Stupidity is not necessarily free from suspicion. These people have watered their wine, that was once such a fiery draught, but the idea of the brotherhood itself remains strong enough to stand a good deal of water. It preserves the remnant of a fruitful mystery, and there is as little doubt that the lodge mixes in politics, as that there is more to see in our amiable Herr Settembrini than just his simple self, and that powers stand behind him, whose representative and emissary he is.”","“And yet,” Naphta added after a pause, “I would advise you not to take the man and his cause all too lightly, would even go so far, now that we are on the subject, as to beg you to be on your guard. Inanity is not synonymous with innocence. Nor is obtuseness necessarily harmless. These people may have poured a great deal of water into wine that was once quite heady, but the concept of brotherhood is itself strong enough to tolerate a lot of water. It retains traces of its fecund secret; nor can there be any doubt that Freemasonry has its hand in world politics, just as there is more to our charming Herr Settembrini than the man himself—standing behind him are powers, whose kin and emissary he is.”"
"Ein paar banal-bürgerlich möblierte Räume, nach vorn, gegen das Tal blickend, gingen ineinander, ohne Verbindungstüren, nur durch Portieren getrennt: ein »altdeutsches« Eßzimmer, ein Wohn- und Arbeitszimmer mit Schreibtisch, über dem eine Studentenmütze und gekreuzte Schläger hingen, wolligen Teppichen, Bibliothek und Sofaarrangement und noch {388}ein Rauchkabinett, das »türkisch« eingerichtet war. Überall hingen Bilder, die Bilder des Hofrats, – höflich und zur Bewunderung bereit gingen die Augen der Eintretenden sogleich darüberhin. Des Hofrats entschwebte Gattin war mehrmals zu sehen: in Öl und auch als Photographie auf dem Schreibtisch. Es war eine dünn und fließend gekleidete, etwas rätselhafte Blondine, welche, die Hände an der linken Schulter gefaltet – und zwar nicht fest gefaltet, sondern nur so, daß die oberen Fingerglieder schwach ineinander lagen –, ihre Augen entweder gen Himmel gerichtet oder tief niedergeschlagen und unter den langen, schräg von den Lidern abstehenden Wimpern versteckt hielt: nur geradeaus und dem Beschauer entgegen blickte die Selige niemals. Sonst gab es hauptsächlich gebirgige Landschaftsmotive, Berge im Schnee und im Tannengrün, Berge, von Höhenqualm umwogt, und Berge, deren trockene und scharfe Umrisse unter dem Einflusse Segantinis in einen tiefblauen Himmel schnitten. Ferner waren da Sennhütten, wammige Kühe auf besonnter Weide stehend und lagernd, ein gerupftes Huhn, das seinen verdrehten Hals zwischen Gemüsen von einer Tischplatte hängen ließ, Blumenstücke, Gebirglertypen und anderes mehr, – gemalt dies alles mit einem gewissen flotten Dilettantismus, in keck aufgeklecksten Farben, die öfters aussahen, als seien sie unmittelbar aus der Tube auf die Leinwand gedrückt, und die lange gebraucht haben mußten, bis sie getrocknet waren – bei groben Fehlern war es zuweilen wirksam.","A couple of banally bourgeois furnished rooms facing the valley, connected to each other, without connecting doors, separated only by porticos: an ""old German"" dining room, a living room and study with a desk over which hung a student's cap and crossed bats, woolly carpets, a library and sofa arrangement, and {388}another smoking room furnished in a ""Turkish"" style. Pictures hung everywhere, the pictures of the privy councilor - politely and ready to be admired, the eyes of those who entered immediately went over them. The privy councilor's wife was seen several times: in oil and also as a photograph on the desk. It was a thinly and fluidly dressed, somewhat enigmatic blonde, who, with her hands clasped on her left shoulder - and not tightly clasped, just so that the top finger joints lay faintly together - her eyes were either lifted heavenward or deeply downcast and kept hidden under the long eyelashes sticking out obliquely from the lids: the blessed never looked straight ahead and towards the viewer. Otherwise there were mainly mountainous landscape motifs, mountains in the snow and in the green of fir trees, mountains surrounded by the smoke of the mountains, and mountains whose dry and sharp outlines cut into a deep blue sky under the influence of Segantini. There were also herdsmen's huts, warm cows lying and standing on a sunny pasture, a plucked chicken that let its twisted neck hang from a tabletop between vegetables, pieces of flowers, types of mountaineers and other things - all painted with a certain brisk amateurism, daubed on boldly Colors that often looked as if they had been pressed onto the canvas straight from the tube, and which must have taken a long time to dry - with gross mistakes it was sometimes effective.","They saw a couple of rooms furnished in banal middle-class taste, facing the valley and opening one into another through a doorway hung with portières. One was an “old-German” dining-room, the other a living-and working-room, with woollen carpets, bookshelves and sofa, and a writing-table above which hung a pair of crossed swords and a student’s cap. Beyond was a Turkish smoking-cabinet. Everywhere were paintings, the work of the Hofrat. The guests went up to them at once on entering, courteously ready to praise. There were several portraits of his departed wife, in oil; also, standing on the writing-table, photographs of her. She was a thin, enigmatic blonde, portrayed in flowing garments, with her hands, their finger-tips just lightly enlaced, against her left shoulder, and her eyes either directed toward heaven or else cast upon the ground, shaded by long, thick, obliquely outstanding eyelashes. Never once was the departed one shown looking directly ahead of her toward the observer. The other pictures were chiefly mountain landscapes, mountains in snow and mountains in summer green, mist-wreathed mountains, mountains whose dry, sharp outline was cut out against a deep-blue sky—these apparently under the influence of Segantini. Then there were cowherds’ huts, and dewlapped cattle standing or lying in sun-drenched high pastures. There was a plucked fowl, with its long writhen neck hanging down from a table among a setting of vegetables. There were flower-pieces, types of mountain peasantry, and so on—all painted with a certain brisk dilettantism, the colours boldly dashed on to the canvas, and often looking as though they had been squeezed on out of the tube. They must have taken a long time to dry—but were sometimes effective by way of helping out the other shortcomings.","Two rooms furnished in banal bourgeois style, one opening into the other and separated only by portieres, looked toward the valley: a dining room done in “antique German”; a combination living room and office, with sofa and chairs, bookcases and heavy wool carpets, a fraternity cap and crossed swords hung above a desk, plus a small smoking alcove, done in “Turkish” style. There were paintings everywhere, the director’s paintings—the visitors’ eyes at once began courteously to wander over them, ready to admire. The director’s departed spouse was conspicuously present, in several oils and also in a photograph on the desk. She was a thin, somewhat enigmatic blond in diaphanous garments, who always held her hands folded against her left shoulder—not firmly clasped, but with just the fingertips lying loosely interlaced—her eyes either directed heavenward or cast down, hidden under long lashes that stood out at an angle from the lids. But the late wife never looked straight ahead at her beholder. Otherwise, the paintings were mostly Alpine landscapes—mountains draped in snow and evergreen, mountains with peaks veiled in mist, and mountains whose crisp, sharp outlines stood out against a deep blue sky and betrayed the influence of Segantini. There were also other themes: Alpine dairy sheds, dewlapped cows standing or lying in sun-drenched pastures, a plucked hen among vegetables with its twisted neck dangling over one side of a table, floral arrangements, local mountain folk, and so on—all of them painted in a kind of brisk, dilettante style, with brash clumps of color that often looked as if they had been squeezed onto the canvas directly from the tube and must have taken a long time to dry. The technique occasionally proved effective at covering bad mistakes."
"»Er war von solchem Format«, fing Hans Castorp wieder an, »daß er das Versagen des Gefühls vor dem Leben als kosmische Katastrophe und als Gottesschande empfand. Denn er betrachtete sich als Gottes Hochzeitsorgan, müssen Sie wissen. Das war eine königliche Narretei … Wenn man ergriffen ist, hat man {947}den Mut zu Ausdrücken, die kraß und pietätlos klingen, aber feierlicher sind als konzessionierte Andachtsworte.«","'He was of such stature,' Hans Castorp began again, 'that he felt the failure of feeling before life as a cosmic catastrophe and a shame on God. Because he saw himself as God's marriage organ, you know. That was royal folly ... When one is moved one has the courage to use expressions that sound crass and irreverent, but are more solemn than licensed words of devotion.'","“He was built on such a grand scale,” Hans Castorp began again, “that he considered it a blasphemy, a cosmic catastrophe, to be found wanting in feeling. For you must know, he regarded himself as the instrument of God’s marriage. That was a piece of majestic tomfoolery—when one is moved one can say things that sound crass and irreverent, but are after all more solemn than the conventional religious formulas.”","“He was a man of such stature,” Hans Castorp began again, “that, for him, the failure of feeling in the face of life was a cosmic catastrophe, a divine disgrace. For you should know that he regarded himself as God’s instrument of marriage. That was a bit of royal foolishness. But when one is deeply moved, one has the courage to say things that may sound crass and irreverent, but are more solemn than authorized words of piety.”"
"Sein Alter wäre schwer zu schätzen gewesen, zwischen dreißig und vierzig mußte es wohl liegen, denn wenn auch seine Gesamterscheinung jugendlich wirkte, so war sein Haupthaar doch an den Schläfen schon silbrig durchsetzt und weiter oben merklich gelichtet: zwei kahle Buchten sprangen neben dem schmalen, spärlichen Scheitel ein und erhöhten die Stirn. Sein Anzug, diese weiten, hellgelblich karierten Hosen und ein flausartiger, zu langer Rock mit zwei Reihen Knöpfen und sehr großen Aufschlägen, war weit entfernt, Anspruch auf Eleganz zu erheben; auch zeigte sein rund umgebogener Stehkragen sich von häufiger Wäsche an den Kanten schon etwas aufgerauht, seine schwarze Krawatte war abgenutzt, und Manschetten trug er offenbar überhaupt nicht, – Hans Castorp erkannte es an der schlaffen Art, in der die Ärmel ihm um das Handgelenk hingen. Trotzdem sah er wohl, daß er einen Herrn vor sich habe; der gebildete Gesichtsausdruck des Fremden, seine freie, ja schöne Haltung ließen keinen Zweifel daran. Diese Mischung aber von Schäbigkeit und Anmut, schwarze Augen dazu und der weich geschwungene Schnurrbart, erinnerten Hans {89}Castorp sogleich an gewisse ausländische Musikanten, die zur Weihnachtszeit in den heimischen Höfen aufspielten und mit emporgerichteten Sammetaugen ihren Schlapphut hinhielten, damit man ihnen Zehnpfennigstücke aus den Fenstern hineinwürfe. »Ein Drehorgelmann!« dachte er. Und so wunderte er sich nicht über den Namen, den er zu hören bekam, als Joachim sich von der Bank erhob und in einiger Befangenheit vorstellte:","It would have been difficult to estimate his age, it must have been between thirty and forty, because even if his overall appearance appeared youthful, the hair on his head was already silvery at the temples and noticeably thinning further up: two bald bays sprang up next to the narrow, sparse parting and raised the forehead. His suit, those loose, pale yellow checked trousers and a fluffy, too-long skirt with two rows of buttons and very large lapels, was far from pretending to be elegant; also his stand-up collar, which was turned round, was already a little roughened at the edges from frequent washing, his black tie was worn out, and he was obviously not wearing cuffs at all - Hans Castorp recognized it from the slack way in which the sleeves hung around his wrist . Nevertheless he could see that he was dealing with a gentleman; the stranger's cultivated facial expression, his free, even handsome bearing left no doubt about it. But this mixture of shabbiness and grace, black eyes and the softly curved mustache, immediately reminded Hans {89}Castorp of certain foreign musicians who played in the home courtyards at Christmas time and held out their slouch hats with raised velvet eyes so that they could be given ten-penny pieces threw in the windows. ""A barrel-organ man!"" he thought. And so he wasn't surprised at the name he heard when Joachim got up from the bench and introduced himself with some embarrassment:","HIS age would have been hard to say, probably between thirty and forty; for though he gave an impression of youthfulness, yet the hair on his temples was sprinkled with silver and gone quite thin on his head. Two bald bays ran along the narrow scanty parting, and added to the height of his forehead. His clothing, loose trousers in light yellowish checks, and too long, double-breasted pilot coat, with very wide lapels, made no slightest claim to elegance; and his stand-up collar, with rounding corners, was rough on the edges from frequent washing. His black cravat showed wear, and he wore no cuffs, as Hans Castorp saw at once from the lax way the sleeve hung round the wrist. But despite all that, he knew he had a gentleman before him: the stranger’s easy, even charming pose and cultured expression left no doubt of that. Yet by this mingling of shabbiness and grace, by the black eyes and softly waving moustaches, Hans Castorp was irresistibly reminded of certain foreign musicians who used to come to Hamburg at Christmas to play in the streets before people’s doors. He could see them rolling up their velvet eyes and holding out their soft hats for the coins tossed from the windows. “A hand-organ man,” he thought. Thus he was not surprised at the name he heard, as Joachim rose from the bench and in some embarrassment presented him: “My cousin Castorp, Herr Settembrini.”","It would have been difficult to guess his age, but it surely had to be somewhere between thirty and forty, because, although the general impression was youthful, he was already silvering at the temples and his hair was thinning noticeably, receding toward the part in two wide arcs, making the brow even higher. His outfit—loose trousers in a pastel yellow check and a wide-lapelled, double-breasted coat that was made of something like petersham and hung much too long—was far from laying any claim to elegance. The edges of his rounded high collar were rough from frequent laundering, his black tie was threadbare, and he apparently didn’t even bother with cuffs—Hans Castorp could tell from the limp way the coat sleeves draped around his wrists. All the same, he could definitely see that he had a gentleman before him—the refined expression on the stranger’s face, his easy, even handsome pose left no doubt of that. This mixture of shabbiness and charm, plus the black eyes and a handlebar moustache, immediately reminded Hans Castorp of certain foreign musicians who would appear in his hometown at Christmastime and strike up a tune, then gaze up with velvet eyes and hold out their slouch hats to catch the coins you threw them from the window. “An organ-grinder!” he thought. And so he was not surprised by the name he now heard as"
"Mit diesem Jungfräulein Brand also, dieser Elly, dieser freundlichen kleinen dänischen Radfahrerin und Kontorbockhockerin hatte es Bewandtnisse, von denen niemand beim ersten und zweiten Anblick ihrer klaren Person sich etwas hätte träumen lassen, die aber schon nach ein paar Wochen ihres {994}Aufenthaltes hier oben anfingen sich zu entdecken, und die in ihrer ganzen Seltsamkeit bloßzulegen Dr. Krokowskis Sache wurde.","With this young lady Brand, with this Elly, with this friendly little Danish cyclist and office worker, there were circumstances that no one could have dreamed of at first and second sight of her clear person, but after a few weeks of her {994}stay here above began to discover themselves, and to expose them in all their strangeness. Krokowski's thing became.","Now this little Fräulein Brand, this little Elly, this friendly-natured little Danish bicycle-rider and stoop-shouldered young counter-jumper, had things about her, of which no one could have dreamed, at first sight of her transparent small personality, but which began to discover themselves after a few weeks; and these it became Dr. Krokowski’s affair to lay bare in all their extraordinariness. The learned man received his first hint in the course of a general evening","This, then, was Fräulein Brand, Elly, the friendly little Danish girl, who rode a bike and used to sit on an office swivel stool—and there were things about her that no one would have even dreamed possible on first or second glance at that shining face, but that began to emerge within only a few weeks after her arrival up here and that Dr. Krokowski saw as his task to uncover in all their strangeness."
"»Ja, es ist ja eine berühmte Luft. Übrigens präsentiert sich die Gegend heute abend nicht vorteilhaft. Manchmal nimmt sie sich besser aus, besonders im Schnee. Aber man sieht sich sehr satt an ihr. Wir alle hier oben, kannst du mir glauben, haben sie ganz unaussprechlich satt«, sagte Joachim, und sein Mund wurde von einem Ausdruck des Ekels verzogen, der übertrieben und unbeherrscht wirkte und ihn wiederum nicht gut kleidete.","“Yes, it is famous air. By the way, the area is not looking good tonight. Sometimes she looks better, especially in the snow. But you get very fed up with her. All of us up here, believe me, are unspeakably sick of them,' said Joachim, his mouth twisted in an expression of disgust that seemed exaggerated and uncontrolled and in turn didn't suit him well.","“Yes, the atmosphere is famous. But the place doesn’t look its best to-night. Sometimes it makes a much better impression—especially when there is snow. But you can get sick of looking at it. All of us up here are frightfully fed up, you can imagine,” said Joachim, and twisted his mouth into an expression of disgust that was as unlike him as the shoulder-shrug. It looked irritable, disproportionate.","“Yes, the air is famous. But the landscape is not showing itself to its best advantage this evening. It can look better, especially in the snow. But you soon get your fill of staring at it. Believe me, all of us up here have definitely had our fill of it,” Joachim said, and his mouth wrenched in an expression of disgust that seemed both exaggerated and out of control—and once again it did not suit him."
"»Ausgezeichnet! Sie erzählen so hübsch, Herr Settembrini, geradezu plastisch ist jedes Ihrer Worte. Auch über die Geschichte mit dem Fräulein, das im See badete, und der man die Stumme Schwester gab, habe ich noch oft im stillen lachen müssen. Ja, was alles vorkommt. Man lernt gewiß nicht aus. Mein eigener Fall liegt übrigens noch ganz im Ungewissen. Der Hofrat will ja eine Kleinigkeit bei mir gefunden haben, – die alten Stellen, wo ich früher schon krank war, ohne es zu wissen, habe ich selbst beim Klopfen gehört, und nun soll auch eine frische hier irgendwo zu hören sein – ha, ›frisch‹ ist übrigens eigentümlich gesagt in diesem Zusammenhang. Aber bis jetzt handelt es sich ja nur um akustische Wahrnehmungen, und die rechte diagnostische Sicherheit werden wir erst haben, wenn ich wieder auf bin und die Durchleuchtung und photographische Aufnahme stattgefunden hat. Dann werden wir positiv Bescheid wissen.«","""Excellent! Your story is so pretty, Mr Settembrini, each of your words is almost vivid. I often had to laugh to myself about the story about the young lady who was bathing in the lake and who was given the mute sister. Yes, whatever happens. You certainly don't stop learning. Incidentally, my own case is still quite uncertain. The privy councilor claims to have found a little something in my house - I heard the old passages where I used to be ill without knowing it when I knocked, and now a fresh one is said to be heard here somewhere - ha, ' By the way, 'fresh' is a peculiar way of saying it in this context. But so far we've only been dealing with acoustic perceptions, and we won't have the right diagnostic certainty until I'm up again and the X-ray and the photograph have taken place. Then we will know positively.«","“Oh, that’s good, that’s very good! You do tell stories capitally, Herr Settembrini; every word is so plastic. And that story about the girl that went bathing in the lake, the one they gave the ‘silent sister’ to take her temperature with—I have often laughed at it, all by myself. Yes, what strange things do happen. One lives and learns. But my own case is still quite uncertain. The Hofrat is supposed to have discovered a trifling weakness, places where I was infected long ago , I heard them myself when, he tapped me, and some fresh places he can hear now—what a funny word fresh is to use in such a connexion! But so far there are only the acoustic indications; real diagnostic certainty we shall only arrive at when I am about again, and the x-ray and photography have taken place. Then we shall have positive knowledge.” “You think so?","“Excellent. What a way you have with stories, Herr Settembrini—every word is absolutely graphic! I’ve laughed quietly many a time at your story about the girl who went for a swim in the lake and then was given a silent sister. Yes, the things that happen here. Always something new. My own case is still quite uncertain, by the way. The director claims he has found a little something wrong with me. There are some old spots, where I was sick once before without ever knowing it, I heard those myself when he tapped, and now he says he can hear a fresh one—ha, ‘fresh’ sounds quite peculiar in that context. But so far it’s merely a matter of acoustical observation, and we won’t have any real diagnostic certainty until I’m on my feet again and they X-ray me and take an interior snapshot. Then we’ll know for sure.” “Do you think so?"
"und er wandte unter diesen Umständen sein Flehen zum Herrn des Himmels, daß er ihm unterdessen das holde Schwesterblut schützen möge! Es ging in den Krieg, der Rhythmus sprang um, wurde unternehmend, Gram und Sorge mochten zum Teufel fahren, er, der Unsichtbare wollte sich dort, wo die Schlacht am heißesten, die Gefahr am größten war, keck, fromm und französisch dem Feinde entgegenwerfen. Wenn ihn aber Gott zu Himmelshöhen rufe, sang er, dann wolle er schützend von dort auf »dich« herniedersehen. Mit diesem »dich« war das Schwesterblut gemeint; aber es rührte Hans Castorp trotzdem in tiefster Seele, und diese seine Ergriffenheit ließ nicht nach bis zum Schluß, wo der Brave dort drinnen zu mächtigen Choralakkorden sang:","and under these circumstances he turned his supplication to the Lord of Heaven, that in the meantime he might protect his sweet sister's blood! The war was on, the rhythm changed, became active, grief and worry might go to hell, he, the invisible man, wanted to throw himself boldly, piously and Frenchly against the enemy where the battle was hottest and the danger greatest . But when God calls him to heavenly heights, he sang, then he wanted to look protectively down at ""you"" from there. This ""you"" meant the sister's blood; but it still touched Hans Castorp in the deepest soul, and this emotion did not let up until the end, where the brave sang to powerful chorale chords in there:","and turned under these circumstances to God, imploring Him to take under His special care and protection his beloved sister. He was going to the wars: the rhythm changed, grew brisk and lively, dull care and sorrow might go hang! He, the invisible singer, longed to be in the field, to stand in the thickest of the fray, where danger was hottest, and fling himself upon the foe—gallant, God-fearing, altogether French. But if, he sang, God should call him to Himself, then would He look down protectingly on “thee”—meaning the singer’s sister, as Hans Castorp was perfectly aware, yet the word thrilled him to the depths, and his emotion prolonged itself as the hero sang, to a mighty choral accompaniment:","and, given these circumstances, turned to the Lord of heaven, begging him to protect the life of his dearest sister in the meantime. He was off to war, the rhythms bounced about, grew bold and daring—to hell with worry and care, he, the invisible singer, wanted to go where the battle was the fiercest, the danger the greatest, to meet the foe gallantly and devoutly, like a true Frenchman. But if God should call him to heaven, he sang, then he would be looking down from there to protect “you.” And by “you” he meant his dear sister; but all the same it touched Hans Castorp to the depths of his soul, and those emotions lasted to the very end, when the brave fellow inside there sang above the massive chords of a chorale:"
"Drunten schlang sich die Wegschleife zum Sanatorium herauf, die er gestern abend gekommen war. Kurzstieliger, sternförmiger Enzian stand im feuchten Grase des Abhangs. Ein Teil der Plattform war als Garten eingezäunt; dort gab es Kieswege, Blumenrabatten und eine künstliche Felsengrotte zu Füßen einer stattlichen Edeltanne. Eine mit Blech gedeckte Halle, in der Liegestühle standen, öffnete sich gegen Süden, und daneben war eine rotbraun gestrichene Flaggenstange aufgerichtet, an deren Schnur zuweilen das Fahnentuch sich entfaltete, – eine Phantasiefahne, grün und weiß, mit dem Emblem der Heilkunde, einem Schlangenstab, in der Mitte.","Down below the path looped up to the sanatorium, which he had come the previous evening. Short-stemmed, star-shaped gentians stood in the damp grass of the slope. Part of the platform was fenced off as a garden; there were gravel paths, flower borders and an artificial rock grotto at the foot of a stately silver fir. A tin-roofed hall, in which deckchairs stood, opened to the south, and next to it a reddish-brown flagpole was erected, on the cord of which the flag sometimes unfolded—an imaginary flag, green and white, with the emblem of medicine, a serpent's staff , in the middle.","He could see below him the winding road up to the sanatorium, by which he had come the night before. Among the dewy grass of the sloping terrace short-stemmed, star-shaped gentians stood out. Part of the level ground had been enclosed for a garden, with flower-beds, gravel paths, and an artificial grotto under a stately silver fir. A hall, with reclining-chairs and a galvanized roof, opened towards the south; near it stood a flag-pole, painted reddish-brown, on which the flag fluttered open now and then on its cord. It was a fancy flag, green and white, with the caduceus, the emblem of healing, in the centre.","He looked down at the winding road they had followed up to the sanatorium the evening before. Short-stemmed, starlike gentians were blooming in the moist grass of the slope. A section of the level ground had been fenced in to form a garden with gravel paths, flowerbeds, and an artificial grotto beneath a stately silver fir. Next to a metal-roofed arcade, open to the south and filled with lounge chairs, stood a flagpole, painted reddish brown and displaying a banner that fluttered full now and then—a fantasy flag, green and white, with a snake-entwined caduceus, the symbol of healing, at its center."
"Die Nacht war die schwierigere Hälfte des Tages, denn Hans Castorp erwachte oft und lag nicht selten stundenlang wach, sei {308}es, weil seine nicht ganz korrekte Blutwärme ihn munter hielt, oder weil Lust und Kraft zum Schlafe durch seine derzeit völlig horizontale Lebensweise Einbuße erlitten. Dafür waren die Stunden des Schlummers von abwechslungsreichen und sehr lebensvollen Träumen belebt, denen er nachhängen konnte, während er wach lag. Und wenn die vielfache Gliederung und Einteilung des Tages diesen kurzweilig machte, so war es bei Nacht die verschwimmende Einförmigkeit der schreitenden Stunden, was in der gleichen Richtung wirkte. Nahte sich aber erst einmal der Morgen, so war es unterhaltend, das allmähliche Ergrauen und Erscheinen des Zimmers, das Hervortreten und Entschleiertwerden der Dinge zu beobachten, den Tag draußen in trüb schwelender oder heiterer Glut sich entzünden zu sehen; und eh mans gedacht, war wieder der Augenblick da, wo das handfeste Klopfen des Bademeisters das Inkrafttreten der Tagesordnung verkündete.","The night was the more difficult half of the day, because Hans Castorp often woke up and not infrequently lay awake for hours, either because {308}his not quite correct blood temperature kept him awake, or because his currently completely horizontal way of life gave him the desire and strength to sleep suffered a loss. On the other hand, the hours of slumber were enlivened by varied and very vivid dreams, which he could indulge in while lying awake. And if the multiple structure and division of the day made it entertaining, at night it was the blurring monotony of the passing hours that worked in the same direction. But once morning came, it was entertaining to watch the gradual graying and appearance of the room, the emergence and unveiling of things, to see the day ignite outside in a dull, smoldering or cheerful glow; And before you knew it, the moment came again when the lifeguard knocked hard and announced that the agenda had come into force.","The night was the harder half of the day, for Hans Castorp woke often, and lay not seldom hours awake; either because his slightly abnormal temperature kept him stimulated, or because his horizontal manner of life, detracted from the power, or the desire, to sleep. To make up for their briefness, his hours of slumber were animated by extremely lively and varied dreams, which he could ponder on awaking. And if the hours of the day were shortened by their frequent division into small sections, it was the blurred monotony of the marching hours of the night which operated with the like effect. Then as dawn came on, he found it diverting to watch the gradual grey, the slow emergence of the room and the objects in it, as though by the drawing of veils; to see day kindling outside, with smouldering or with lively glow; and it was always a surprise when the moment came round again and the thump of the bathing-master on his door announced to Hans Castorp that the daily programme was again in force.","The night was the more difficult half of the day, because Hans Castorp would wake frequently and often even lie awake for hours on end—perhaps because his overheated blood kept him alert or because his fully horizontal mode of life meant the loss of both the desire and the need for sleep. The hours of slumber were, however, animated with varied and lively dreams, and he could go on indulging in them even while lying there awake. Divided as it was into little segments, the day provided him with diversion, but the hours of night, as they marched past in their blurred uniformity, had much the same effect. And when morning drew near, he found it amusing to watch the objects in his room gradually grow visible, emerging from under a veil of gray, to see daylight kindle outside, sometimes only smoldering murkily, sometimes catching bright fire. And before one even thought about it, the moment had come for the robust knock of the bath attendant, announcing that the daily schedule was in force once again."
"Er täuschte sich denn auch nicht darin, daß die Mitglieder seines buntscheckigen Freundeskreises sich wenigstens daran gewöhnen würden, daß sie sich nicht aneinander gewöhnten: Spannungen, Fremdheiten, sogar stille Feindseligkeit gab es selbstverständlich genug zwischen ihnen, und wir wundern uns selbst, wie es unserem unbedeutenden Helden gelingen mochte, sie um sich zusammenzuhalten, – wir erklären es uns mit einer gewissen verschmitzten Lebensfreundlichkeit seines Wesens, die ihn alles »hörenswert« finden ließ, und die man Verbindlichkeit selbst in dem Sinne nennen könnte, daß sie nicht nur ihm die ungleichartigsten Personen und Persönlichkeiten, sondern bis zu einem gewissen Grade sogar diese untereinander verband.","He did not delude himself into thinking that the members of his motley circle of friends would at least get used to the fact that they did not get used to one another: there was, of course, enough tension, strangeness, even tacit hostility between them, and we wonder how ours felt insignificant heroes may succeed in keeping them together - we explain it with a certain mischievous joie de vivre in his nature, which made him find everything ""worth hearing"" and which one could even call commitment in the sense that they are not only the most dissimilar to him persons and personalities, but to a certain extent even connected them with one another.","And he was not wrong in thinking that the members of this motley group would at least get used to not getting used to each other. Strangeness, tension, even suppressed hostility there was of course enough between them; it is surely rather remarkable that a comparatively insignificant personality could have held them together. That he did so must be laid to a certain shrewd geniality native to him, which found everything fish that came to his net, and not only bound to him people of the most diverse tastes and characters, but exerted enough power to bind them to each other.","And he was not mistaken in assuming that the members of his motley circle of friends would at least get used to not getting used to one another. To be sure, there was quite sufficient tension, strain, and even silent hostility among them; and we ourselves are amazed that our inconsequential hero managed to keep the group together. Our only explanation is that there was something shrewdly life-affirming in our hero’s nature, which allowed him to find everything “worth listening to” and which one might also call obligingness, in the sense that it not only bound him to very different kinds of people and personalities, but also to some extent linked them to one another."
"»Haben Sie je eine Schiffsreise gemacht, Tenente, oder Sie, Ingenieur?« fragte Herr Settembrini, als er nach Tische in der Halle mit seinem Zahnstocher an das Tischchen der Vettern herantrat … Wie die Mehrzahl der Gäste kürzten sie heute den Hauptliegedienst um eine Viertelstunde, indem sie sich hier zu einem Kaffee mit Kognak niedergelassen hatten. »Ich bin erinnert durch diese Häschen, diese gefärbten Eier an das Leben auf so einem großen Dampfer, bei leerem Horizont seit Wochen, in {538}salziger Wüstenei, unter Umständen, deren vollkommene Bequemlichkeit ihre Ungeheuerlichkeit nur oberflächlich vergessen läßt, während in den tieferen Gegenden des Gemütes das Bewußtsein davon als ein geheimes Grauen leise fortnagt … Ich erkenne den Geist wieder, in dem man an Bord einer solchen Arche die Feste der terraferma pietätvoll andeutet. Es ist das Gedenken von Außerweltlichen, empfindsame Erinnerung nach dem Kalender … Auf dem Festlande wäre heut Ostern, nicht wahr? Auf dem Festlande begeht man heut Königs Geburtstag, – und wir tun es auch, so gut wir können, wir sind auch Menschen … Ist es nicht so?«","“Have you ever been on a voyage, Tenente, or have you, engineer?” asked Mr. Settembrini, as he approached his cousins’ little table with his toothpick after being seated in the hall … Like most of the guests today, they cut the main berthing service by a quarter of an hour , by sitting down here for a coffee with cognac. “I am reminded by these bunnies, these colored eggs, of life on such a big steamer, with the horizon blank for weeks, in salty deserts, under circumstances whose perfect comfort only superficially forgets their monstrosity, while in the deeper ones Regions of the mind the consciousness of it as a secret horror quietly gnaws away... I recognize the spirit in which on board such an ark one reverently hints at the festivals of the terraferma. It is the commemoration of off-worlders, tender remembrance according to the calendar... Today would be Easter on the mainland, wouldn't it? On the mainland they celebrate the king's birthday today - and we do it as well as we can, we are human beings too... Isn't that so?""","“Have you ever made a voyage by steamship, Tenente? Or you, Engineer?” asked Herr Settembrini, strolling up to the cousins’ table, toothpick in mouth. Most of the guests were shortening the main rest-cure in honour of the day, and devoting a quarter-hour to coffee and cognac. “These rabbits and coloured eggs somehow remind me of the life on board a great oceangoing boat, where you stare at a briny waste and a bare horizon for weeks on end, and even the exaggerated ease of the life scarcely avails to make you forget its precariousness, the submerged consciousness of which continues to gnaw at the depths of your being. I still recall the spirit in which the passengers in such an ark piously observe the feasts of terra firma: they have thoughts of the outer world, they are sensitive to the calendar. On shore it would be Easter today, they say; or, to-day they are celebrating the King’s birthday—and we will celebrate too, as best we may. We are human beings too. Isn’t that the idea?”","“Have you ever taken an ocean voyage, tenente—or you, my good engineer?” Herr Settembrini asked, stepping up to the cousins’ table after the meal, his toothpick in his mouth. Like most of the guests, they were shaving fifteen minutes from the main rest cure by lingering over coffee and cognac. “These rabbits and dyed eggs remind me of life on a great steamer, when for weeks on end you stare at an empty horizon and a briny desert, under conditions of deluxe comfort that only superficially help you forget the enormity of the situation, an awareness of which lives on as a secret horror gnawing in the deeper regions of your mind. I recognize today’s mood; it is the same mood that reigns when the holidays of terra firma are religiously observed on those great arks—as reminders of a world outside, nostalgia as per calendar. Today would be Easter on terra firma, right? Today’s the king’s birthday on terra firma— and so we celebrate it, too, as best we can, we’re only human. Isn’t that right?”"
"»Sapperlot, Ingenieur, ich höre Auffälliges von Ihrem Wandel. Sie haben sich auf die Mildtätigkeit geworfen? Sie suchen Rechtfertigung durch gute Werke?«","'Sapperlot, engineer, I've got some good news about your shift. You threw yourself on charity? Do you seek justification by good works?”","“Sapperlot, Engineer! What is this I am hearing of your activities? So you have thrown yourself into a career of benevolence? You are seeking justification through good works?”","“Zounds, my good engineer. I’ve been hearing the most curious things about your behavior. You have thrown yourself into deeds of mercy? Are you pursuing justification by good works?”"
"»Vor wem?« sagte sie, das Fragewort kurz und fremdartig sprechend.","""To whom?"" she said, making the question word short and strange.","“For whom?” she said, giving her query a curt, foreign intonation.","she asked, pronouncing the word in a strange, clipped way."
"Anschauend wie in einer Ausstellung gingen sie die Wände entlang, begleitet vom Hausherrn, der dann und wann ein Motiv bei Namen nannte, meistens aber schweigend, in der stolzen Beklommenheit des Künstlers, es genoß, seine Augen zusammen mit denen Fremder auf seinen Werken ruhen zu lassen. Das Porträt Clawdia Chauchats hing im Wohnzimmer an der Fensterwand, – Hans Castorp hatte es schon beim Ein{389}treten mit raschem Blicke erspäht, obgleich es nur eine entfernte Ähnlichkeit aufwies. Absichtlich mied er die Stelle, hielt seine Begleiter im Eßzimmer fest, wo er einen grünen Blick ins Sergital mit bläulichen Gletschern im Hintergrunde zu bewundern vorgab, steuerte dann aus eigener Machtvollkommenheit zuerst ins türkische Kabinett hinüber, das er, Lob auf den Lippen, ebenfalls gründlich durchmusterte, und besichtigte dann die Eingangswand des Wohnzimmers, auch Joachim manchmal zur Beifallsäußerung auffordernd. Endlich wandte er sich um und fragte mit Maßen stutzend:","They walked along the walls, looking as if they were in an exhibition, accompanied by the master of the house, who now and then called a motif by name, but mostly in silence, in the proud trepidation of the artist, enjoying his eyes resting with those of strangers on his works leave. The portrait of Clawdia Chauchat hung on the window wall in the living room - Hans Castorp had spotted it with a quick glance as soon as he entered, although it showed only a distant resemblance. Deliberately he avoided the spot, kept his companions in the dining room, where he pretended to admire a green view of the Sergital with bluish glaciers in the background, then, on his own authority, steered first over to the Turkish cabinet, which he, with praise on his lips, also thoroughly explored and then inspected the entrance wall of the living room, sometimes asking Joachim to applaud. Finally he turned and asked with moderation:","They passed as they would along the walls of an exhibition, accompanied by the master of the house, who now and then gave a name to some subject or other, but was chiefly silent, with the proud embarrassment of the artist, tasting the enjoyment of looking on his own works with the eyes of strangers. The portrait of Clavdia Chauchat hung on the window wall of the living-room—Hans Castorp spied it out with a quick glance as he entered, though the likeness was but a distant one. Purposely he avoided the spot, detaining his companions in the dining-room, where he affected to admire a fresh green glimpse into the valley of the Serbi, with ice-blue glaciers in the background. Next he passed of his own accord into the Turkish cabinet, and looked at all it had to show, with praises on his lips; thence back to the living-room, beginning with the entrance wall, and calling upon Joachim to second his encomiums. But at last he turned, with a measured start, and said: “But surely that is a familiar face?”","They moved along the walls as if at an exhibition, accompanied by the master of the house, who would now and then provide a title, but usually said nothing, displaying the proud apprehension of the artist, enjoying it all, letting his eyes rest on each work along with those of the strangers. The portrait of Clavdia Chauchat was hung in the living room, next to the window—Hans Castorp had spied it with one quick glance as he entered the room, although it bore only a very distant resemblance to her. He intentionally avoided the spot, keeping his companions pinned down in the dining room by pretending to admire a verdant view of the Sergi Valley with bluish glaciers in the background; well aware that he was in command, he first steered them into the Turkish smoking alcove, which he likewise gave a thorough examination amid much praise, and then surveyed the wall on the entrance side of the living room, sometimes urging Joachim to join him in his complimentary remarks. Finally he turned around and said with measured puzzlement, “Why, I know that face, don’t I?”"
"»Nein, das ist nicht meine Auffassung, Herr Hofrat. Ich muß nun zum Regiment.«","'No, that's not my opinion, Herr Hofrat. I must go to the regiment now.”","“No, Herr Hofrat, I don’t look at it in that light. I must join my regiment.”","“No, that is not how I see it, Director Behrens. I have to return to my regiment.”"
"{679}Mit diesen bürgerlich ehrbaren Dingen, antwortete Naphta, wäre den Jahrhunderten, die er soeben angezogen, aber wenig gedient gewesen und zwar beiden Teilen nicht: den Kranken und Elenden so wenig wie den Gesunden und Glücklichen, die nicht sowohl aus Mitleid, als um des eigenen Seelenheiles willen sich ihnen milde erwiesen hätten. Denn durch erfolgreiche Sozialreform wären diese des wichtigsten Rechtfertigungsmittels verlustig gegangen, jene aber ihres heiligen Standes beraubt worden. Darum habe dauernde Erhaltung von Armut und Krankheit im Interesse beider Parteien gelegen, und diese Auffassung bleibe solange möglich, als es möglich sei, den rein religiösen Gesichtspunkt festzuhalten.","{679}With these bourgeois respectable things, replied Naphta, the centuries which he had just attracted would have been of little use, and indeed neither: the sick and miserable as little as the healthy and fortunate, who were not served out of pity as much as would have shown them leniency for the sake of their own salvation. Because successful social reform would have deprived them of the most important means of justification, while others would have been robbed of their sacred status. That is why it was in the interest of both parties to keep out of poverty and illness, and this view remained possible as long as it was possible to adhere to the purely religious point of view.","All these, Naphta responded, were very honest bourgeois achievements; but they would have done more harm than good in the centuries under discussion. They would have profited neither one side nor the other; the ailing and wretched as little as the strong and prosperous, these latter not having been piteous for pity’s sake, but for the salvation of their own souls. Successful social reform would have robbed them of their necessary justification, as it would the wretched of their sanctified state. The persistence of poverty and sickness had been in the interest of both parties, and the position could be sustained just so long as it was possible to hold to the purely religious point of view.","During the centuries he was talking about, Naphta responded, such decent bourgeois measures would have served neither side—would have been of no more use to the ill and suffering than to the healthy and happy, who had wanted to demonstrate their charity not so much out of compassion as out of the desire to save their own souls. Efficacious social reforms would have deprived the latter of the most important means of justification, and the former of their sanctified state. And so it had been in the interest of both parties to perpetuate poverty and illness, and that attitude had held as long as it had been possible to maintain a purely religious view of things."
"Damit glitt sie vom Stuhl, glitt über den Teppich zur Tür, in deren Rahmen sie zögerte, halb rückwärts gewandt, einen ihrer nackten Arme erhoben, die Hand an der Türangel. Über die Schulter sagte sie leise:","With that she slid off the chair, slid across the carpet to the door, where she hesitated, half-turned backwards, one bare arm raised, hand on the hinge. Over her shoulder she said softly:","She slipped from her chair, and glided over the carpet to the door, where she paused an instant, framed in the doorway; half turned toward him, with one bare arm lifted high, her hand upon the hinge. Over her shoulder she said softly: “N’oubliez pas de me rendre mon crayon.”","Then she glided out of her chair, glided across the carpet to the door, where she stopped and turned halfway back to him, one bare arm raised, a hand on the hinge. Over her shoulder she said softly, “Don’t forget to return my pencil.”"
"»Immerhin ist es etwas schlapp,« sagte Joachim, »daß du so daran hängst. Behrens hat ganz recht: Du bist ein Zivilist – er meinte es ja wohl mehr als Lob, aber du bist ein heilloser Zivilist, das ist die Sache. Übrigens bist du ja gesund und kannst tun, was du willst«, sagte er, und seine Augen wurden müde.","""It's a bit flabby anyway,"" said Joachim, ""that you're so attached to it. Behrens is quite right: you're a civilian - he probably meant it more than praise, but you're a hopeless civilian, that's the thing. By the way, you're healthy and can do what you like,' he said, and his eyes grew tired.","“But after all,” Joachim said, “it is rather flabby-minded of you to be so dependent on it. Behrens is right, you are certainly a civilian. He meant it for a sort of compliment, I dare say; but the truth is, you are a civilian—incurable. But then, you are healthy, you can do what you like,” he added, and his eyes took on their tired look.","“All the same, it’s a sign of a rather weak will,” Joachim said, “to be so dependent on tobacco. Behrens is quite right—you’re a civilian. He meant it more in praise, to be sure, but you are an incurable civilian, that’s the point. And besides, you’re healthy and can do what you like,” he said, and a weary look came into his eyes."
"{134}»Natürlich fällt es mir nicht so ganz leicht, mich bei Ihnen hier oben zu akklimatisieren,« fuhr er fort, »das war doch vorauszusehen, und deshalb gleich die Flinte ins Korn zu werfen, nur weil ich vielleicht ein paar Tage ein bißchen verwirrt und heiß sein werde, da müßte ich mich ja schämen, geradezu feig würde ich mir vorkommen und außerdem ginge es gegen alle Vernunft, – nein, sagen Sie selbst …«","{134}""Of course it's not that easy for me to acclimatize up here with you,"" he continued, ""that was foreseeable, and therefore I immediately threw in the towel, just because I might be a few days I'll be a bit confused and hot, I'd have to be ashamed, I'd feel downright cowardly and besides, it would go against all reason - no, tell me yourself...""","“Of course,” he went on, “it is true it is not so easy for me to get acclimatized up here. But that was to be expected. I’d be ashamed to chuck it up and go away like that, just because I felt upset and feverish for a few days. I’d feel a perfect coward. It would be a senseless thing to do, you admit it yourself, don’t you?”","“Of course I’m not finding it all that easy to get acclimatized up here,” he went on, “but that was to be expected. If I were to throw in the towel so soon, simply because I’ll be a little confused and flushed for a few days—why I’d be ashamed of myself, I’d feel like a coward. And besides, it would be quite counter to reason—no, you must admit . . .”"
"Hans Castorp nickte dazu und hielt sich in der Tat fürs erste {1012}von diesen Unternehmungen fern. Er hörte, daß Dr. Krokowski in seinem analytischen Souterrain mit Ellen Brand Sitzungen veranstalte, zu denen ausgewählte Mitglieder der Gästeschaft zugezogen wurden. Aber er lehnte die Beteiligung gleichgültig ab, – natürlich nicht ohne über die Versuchserfolge aus dem Munde der Mitwirkenden und Dr. Krokowskis selbst dies und das zu erfahren. Kraftäußerungen von der Art, wie sie im Zimmer der Kleefeld wilder und unwillkürlicher Weise sich ereignet hatten: Schläge also gegen Tisch und Wände, das Abdrehen der Lampe und anderes, weitergehendes, wurden bei diesen Zusammenkünften, nachdem Kamerad Krokowski die kleine Elly nach der Kunst hypnotisiert und in wachtraumhaften Zustand versetzt hatte, systematisch und unter möglichster Gewähr ihrer Echtheit erzielt und geübt. Es hatte sich gezeigt, daß eine musikalische Begleitung die Exerzitien erleichterte, und so wechselte an diesen Abenden das Grammophon seinen Standort, wurde von dem magischen Kreise mit Beschlag belegt. Da aber der Böhme Wenzel, der es bei dieser Gelegenheit bediente, ein musikalischer Mann war, der das Instrument gewiß nicht mißhandeln und schädigen würde, so konnte Hans Castorp es in leidlicher Gemütsruhe übergeben. Aus dem Plattenfundus stellte er für den besonderen Dienst ein Album zur Verfügung, worin er allerlei Leichtigkeiten, Tänze, kleine Ouvertüren und sonstiges Dideldum angeordnet hatte, das, da Elly keineswegs nach höheren Tönen verlangte, seinen Zweck vollkommen erfüllte.","Hans Castorp nodded to this and actually stayed away from these undertakings for the time being {1012}. He heard that Dr. Krokowski held meetings with Ellen Brand in his analytical basement, to which selected members of the guests were invited. But he indifferently refused to take part - of course not without hearing about the success of the test from the mouths of the participants and Dr. Krokowskis himself to experience this and that. Manifestations of strength of the kind that had happened wildly and involuntarily in Kleefeld's room: hitting the table and walls, turning off the lamp and other, more extensive things were done at these meetings after comrade Krokowski had hypnotized little Elly according to art and put it in a dreamlike state, achieved and practiced systematically and with the greatest possible guarantee of its authenticity. It had been shown that musical accompaniment made the retreat easier, and so on these evenings the gramophone changed its location and was occupied by the magic circle. But since the Bohemian Wenzel, who operated it on this occasion, was a musical man who would certainly not mishandle or damage the instrument, Hans Castorp was able to hand it over with tolerable composure. For the special service he made an album available from the record store, in which he had arranged all sorts of lightness, dances, small overtures and other dideldum, which, since Elly by no means demanded higher notes, fulfilled its purpose completely.","Hans Castorp nodded assent—and in fact did for a while keep aloof from all such undertakings. He heard that Dr. Krokowski had begun holding seances with Ellen Brand in his subterranean cabinet, to which certain chosen ones of the guests were invited. But he nonchalantly put aside the invitation to join them—naturally not without hearing from them and from Krokowski himself something about the success they were having. It appeared that there had been wild and arbitrary exhibitions of power, like those in Fräulein Kleefeld’s room: knockings on walls and table, the turning off of the lamp, and these as well as further manifestations were being systematically produced and investigated, with every possible safeguarding of their genuineness, after Comrade Krokowski had practised the approved technique and put little Elly into her hypnotic sleep. They had discovered that the process was facilitated by music; and on these evenings the gramophone was pre-empted by the circle and carried down into the basement. But the Czech Wenzel who operated it there was a not unmusical man, and would surely not injure or misuse the instrument; Hans Castorp might hand it over without misgiving. He even chose a suitable album of records, containing light music, dances, small overtures and suchlike tunable trifles. Little Elly made no demands on a higher art, and they served the purpose admirably.","Hans Castorp nodded in agreement and for a while did indeed keep his distance from such activities. He heard that Dr. Krokowski was holding sessions with Ellen Brand in his analytical basement, to which selected residents were invited. But he calmly refused to participate—though, of course, not without learning this and that from the attendees and from Dr. Krokowski himself. There had been fierce, involuntary manifestations of energy much like those that had occurred in Hermine Kleefeld’s room; at such meetings, Comrade Krokowski would use his skill to hypnotize little Elly, putting her into a waking trance, and then, under all possible safeguards of authenticity, systematically obtain and cultivate phenomena: the turning on and off of lights, hangings on tables and walls, and much, much more. It had turned out that musical accompaniment facilitated these exercises, and so on such evenings the gramophone would be confiscated by this magical fellowship and moved from its usual place. But since Wenzel the Bohemian, a man of musical sensitivities, who would certainly never mishandle or damage the instrument, was in charge on these occasions, Hans Castorp could hand it over with reasonable equanimity. From the treasury of disks, he assembled a special album, a collection of light favorites, dances, short overtures, and other such folderol, which he made available to them and which admirably served the purpose, since Elly had no need of more sublime tones."
"So endete der Versuch des Flachlandes, den außengebliebenen Hans Castorp wieder einzuholen. Der junge Mann machte sich kein Hehl daraus, daß der vollkommene Fehlschlag, den er vorhergesehen, für sein Verhältnis zu denen dort unten von entscheidender Bedeutung war. Er bedeutete für das Flachland achselzuckend-endgültigen Verzicht, für ihn aber die vollendete Freiheit, vor welcher sein Herz nachgerade nicht mehr erbebte.","This is how the attempt of the lowlands to catch up with the outside Hans Castorp ended. The young man made no bones about the fact that the complete failure he foresaw was crucial to his relationship with those below. For the lowland it meant a shrug of the shoulders and final renunciation, but for him complete freedom, before which his heart no longer trembled.","Thus ended the campaign of the flat-land to recover its lost Hans Castorp. Our young man did not conceal from himself that the total failure of this embassy marked a crisis in the relations between himself and the world below. It meant that he gave it up, finally and with a metaphorical shrug of the shoulders; it meant, for himself, the consummation of freedom—the thought of which had gradually ceased to make him shudder.","And that was the end of the attempt by the flatlands to reclaim Hans Castorp. The young man admitted quite openly to himself that such total failure, which he had seen coming, was of decisive importance for his relationship to the people down there. For the flatlands it meant a final shrug, the abandonment of any claim; for him, however, it meant freedom finally won, and by now his heart no longer fluttered at the thought."
"»Ganz sine pecunia«, zitierte Herr Settembrini, indem er aufstand. »Wer will sich denn lumpen lassen.« Sie lachten. Man hörte die äußere Doppeltür gehen, und im nächsten Augenblick wurde auch die innere geklinkt. Es war Joachim, der aus der Abendgeselligkeit zurückkehrte. Beim Anblick des Italieners errötete auch er, wie Hans Castorp für sein Teil es vorhin getan: die verbrannte Dunkelheit seines Gesichtes vertiefte sich um eine Schattierung.","""Quite sine pecunia,"" quoted Mr. Settembrini, standing up. ""Who wants to be ragged?"" They laughed. The outer double doors were heard to be heard, and the next moment the inner ones were also latched. It was Joachim returning from the evening social. He, too, blushed at the sight of the Italian, as Hans Castorp, for his part, did earlier: the scorched darkness of his face deepened a shade.","“Sine pecunia, of course,” quoted Herr Settembrini, as he rose. “I can’t let myself be outdone!” They both laughed. The outer door opened, next moment the inner one as well. It was Joachim, returned from “society.” When he saw the Italian he flushed, as Hans Castorp had done; the deep bronze of his face deepened by another shade.","“Quite sine pecunia,” Herr Settembrini quoted as he stood up. “A man can’t allow himself to be outclassed.” They laughed. They heard the first double door open, and in the next moment they heard the latch of the inner one. It was Joachim, back from the evening social. He blushed when he caught sight of the Italian, exactly as Hans Castorp had done; his tanned face turned one visible shade darker."
"Dennoch war es nicht nur und nicht einmal hauptsächlich das Spiel und der Wein, die die seelische Hochspannung des {850}Kreises, diese Erhitzung der Mienen, diese Erweiterung der glänzenden Augen oder das zeitigten, was man die Angestrengtheit der kleinen Gesellschaft, ihr In-Atem-gehalten-sein, ihre fast schmerzhafte Konzentration auf den Augenblick hätte nennen können. Vielmehr war all dies auf die Einwirkung einer Herrschernatur unter den Anwesenden, auf die der »Persönlichkeit« unter ihnen, auf diejenige Mynheer Peeperkorns zurückzuführen, der die Führung in seiner gebärdenreichen Hand hielt und alle durch das Schauspiel seiner großen Miene, seinen blassen Blick unter dem monumentalen Faltenwerk seiner Stirne, durch sein Wort und die Eindringlichkeit seiner Pantomimik in den Bann der Stunde zwang. Was sagte er? Höchst Undeutliches, und desto Undeutlicheres, je mehr er trank. Aber man hing an seinen Lippen, starrte lächelnd und mit emporgerissenen Brauen nickend auf das Rund, das sein Zeigefinger mit seinem Daumen bildete, und neben welchem die anderen Finger lanzenspitz aufragten, während es in seinem königlichen Antlitz sprechend arbeitete, und ließ sich ohne Widerstand zu einem Gefühlsdienst anhalten, der weit das Maß von hingebender Leidenschaft überstieg, das diese Leute sich sonst zuzumuten gewöhnt waren. Er ging über die Kräfte einzelner, dieser Dienst. Frau Magnus wenigstens ward unpäßlich. Sie drohte in Ohnmacht hinzuschwinden, weigerte sich aber zähe, ihr Zimmer aufzusuchen, sondern begnügte sich mit ihrer Lagerung auf der Chaiselongue, woselbst man ihre Stirn mit einer nassen Serviette versah, und von wo sie nach einiger Erholung in den Kreis zurückkehrte.","Nevertheless, it was not only and not even mainly the game and the wine that brought about the spiritual high tension of the {850}circle, this heat of expression, this widening of the shining eyes or what one could describe the exertion of the small company, their inner being breath-held, her almost painful focus on the moment. Rather, all this was due to the influence of a sovereign nature among those present, that of ""personality"" among them, that of Mynheer Peeperkorn, who held the lead in his gestured hand, and all by the spectacle of his large countenance, his pale eyes beneath the monumental wrinkles on his forehead, through his words and the intensity of his pantomime, under the spell of the hour. What did he say? Extremely indistinct, and the more indistinct the more he drank. But one hung on his every word, stared, smiling and nodding with raised brows at the round which his index finger formed with his thumb, and beside which the other fingers lance-pointedly rose while it worked eloquently in his royal countenance, and allowed oneself without resistance a sentimental service far exceeding the level of devotional passion these people were otherwise accustomed to expect. It was beyond the strength of individuals, this service. Frau Magnus, at least, became indisposed. She threatened to faint, but stubbornly refused to go to her room, contenting herself with lying on the chaise-longue, where her forehead was covered with a wet napkin, and from which, after some rest, she returned to the circle.","But it was not solely—or even chiefly—the play and the wine that made the little circle so tense, that flushed their cheeks and opened their eyes so wide, or evoked such breathless excitement, such almost painful concentration on the moment’s business. It was rather the effect of a commanding nature in their midst, a “personality”; it was Mynheer Peeperkorn who held the gathering in the hollow of his mobile gesturing hand, and enforced it, by the spectacle of his countenance, by his pallid gaze beneath the monumental creases of his brow, by his words, and his compelling pantomime, to take the mood of the hour. No matter what he said; it was highly incomprehensible, and the more so the more wine he drank. Yet they hung on his lips, they could not take their eyes from the little round made by his finger and thumb, with the pointed nails stiffly erect beside it; or from the majestic, speaking face; they utterly succumbed to feelings which for self-forgetfulness and intensity far exceeded the accustomed gamut of these people. The tribute they paid was too much for some of them—Frau Magnus, at least, felt very poorly; threatened to faint, but stoutly refused to retire, and contented herself with the chaise-longue, where she lay awhile with a wet-napkin over her forehead, and then rejoined the group at the table.","And yet it was not only, not even primarily, the gambling and the wine that brought forth these high-tension emotions around the table and made faces flush and shining eyes grow wider, so that the whole party was engaged in what might be called a common strenuous effort, all holding their breath in almost painful concentration on the moment. It was, rather, that all these effects could be traced to the influence of one masterful nature among those present, to the “personality” among them, to Mynheer Peeperkorn, who held the reins in his grandly gesticulating hands and bound them all to the spell of the hour with the drama of his countenance, with pale eyes gazing out from under the monumental creases of his brow, with words and compelling pantomime. What did he say? Nothing very intelligible, and even less so the more he drank. But they hung on his words, smiled and nodded and stared with raised eyebrows at that circle he formed with his forefinger and thumb while the other fingers stood erect like lances and his regal countenance labored to speak; they did not resist, they gladly allowed their emotions to wait upon him and abandoned themselves with a passion that went far beyond anything they would normally have trusted themselves to feel. It was too much for some of them, this abandonment. Frau Magnus, at least, felt indisposed and came close to fainting; she stoutly refused to return to her room, but did acquiesce to lie down on the chaise longue and let them apply a moist napkin to her brow. She soon rose, however, and returned to the group."
"»Nein, wissen kann man gar nichts«, antwortete Hans Castorp. »Und darum hat man kein Recht, das Ärgerlichste in Ansatz zu bringen, zum Beispiel auch was die Dauer meines Kuraufenthaltes betrifft. Du sagst, niemand weiß, wann ich loskomme und auf der Werft eintreten kann, aber du sagst es im pessimistischen Sinn, und das finde ich voreilig, da man es ja eben nicht wissen kann. Behrens hat keinen Termin genannt, er ist ein besonnener Mann und spielt nicht den Wahrsager. Es hat ja auch die Durchleuchtung und photographische Aufnahme noch gar nicht stattgefunden, die erst den Sachverhalt objektiv klarstellen wird, und wer weiß, ob da etwas Nennenswertes zutage kommt und ob ich nicht vorher schon fieberfrei bin und euch Adieu sagen kann. Ich bin dafür, daß wir uns nicht vor der Zeit aufspielen und denen zu Hause nicht gleich die größten Räubergeschichten erzählen. Es genügt, wenn wir {284}nächstens mal schreiben – ich kann selbst schreiben, mit der Füllfeder hier, wenn ich mich etwas aufsetze –, daß ich stark erkältet und febril und bettlägrig bin und vorderhand noch nicht reisen kann. Das Weitere findet sich.«","""No, you can't know anything,"" answered Hans Castorp. ""And that's why you have no right to start with the most annoying thing, for example with regard to the duration of my stay at the spa. You say nobody knows when I'll be able to get away and enter the shipyard, but you say it in a pessimistic sense, and I think that's premature, since it's impossible to know. Behrens did not give a date, he is a level-headed man and does not play the fortune teller. The X-rays and photographs have not yet taken place, which will first clarify the facts objectively, and who knows whether something worth mentioning will come to light and whether I won't be fever-free beforehand and can say goodbye to you. I am in favor of us not acting ahead of time and telling those at home the biggest robbery stories right away. It will suffice if we write {284}next time - I can write myself, with the fountain pen here, if I sit up a bit - that I have a bad cold and am feverish and bedridden and cannot travel for the time being. The rest can be found.«","“No, as far as knowing goes, we never can. But just for that reason, we have no right to assume the worst—for instance with regard to how long I shall be obliged to stop here. You say nobody knows when I shall be free to go into the ship-yard; but you say it in a pessimistic sense, and that I find premature, since we cannot know. Behrens did not set a limit; he is a long-headed man, and doesn’t play the prophet. There are the x-ray and the photographic plate yet to come before we can definitely know the facts; who knows whether they will show anything worth talking about, and whether I shall not be free of fever before that, and can say good-bye to you. I am all for our not striking before the time and crying wolf to the family down below. It is quite enough for the present if we write and say—I can do it myself with the fountainpen if I sit up a little—that I have a severe cold and am febrile, that I am stopping in bed, and shall not travel for the present. The rest will follow.”","“No, you can’t be sure of anything,” Hans Castorp replied. “Which is precisely why no one has any right to assume the worst—about how long I’ll have to stay on here at your spa, for instance. You say that no one knows when I’ll get away and start work on the docks, but you say it from the pessimistic point of view. And that, I think, is premature, precisely because you can’t be sure. Behrens mentioned no dates—he’s a prudent fellow and doesn’t want to play the fortune-teller. And I haven’t even had my picture taken with X-rays yet, and only that will give us an objective view of the facts. Who knows whether anything worth mentioning will even show up, or whether I won’t have rid myself of my fever by then and can bid you all adieu. I’m for not playing this thing up too soon, so that we end up crying wolf back home. It will be enough if we write a letter—I can write it myself with my fountain pen if I prop myself up a little—and tell them I’ve got a bad cold and a fever, that I’m staying in bed and won’t be traveling just yet. And then we shall see what we shall see.”"
"Logische Verlegenheit … Hans Castorp suchte darüber hinwegzuhelfen, indem er selbstherrlich und als könne es seine Sache sein, ein solches Gespräch zu lenken, das Problem der Todesstrafe in die Debatte warf. Die Folter war abgeschafft, obgleich ja die Untersuchungsrichter noch immer ihre Praktiken hätten, den Angeklagten mürbe zu machen. Aber die Todesstrafe schien unsterblich, nicht zu entbehren. Die allerzivilisiertesten Völker hielten daran fest. Die Franzosen hatten mit ihren Deportationen sehr schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht. Man wußte einfach nicht, was man praktisch mit gewissen menschenähnlichen Wesen anfangen sollte, außer, sie einen Kopf kürzer zu machen.","Logical embarrassment... Hans Castorp tried to get over this by throwing the issue of the death penalty into the debate, self-importantly and as if it were his business to direct such a conversation. Torture had been abolished, although the coroners still had their practices of wearing down the accused. But the death penalty seemed immortal, irreplaceable. The most civilized peoples clung to it. The French had had very bad experiences with their deportations. One just didn't know what to do practically with certain humanoid beings, other than to cut their heads short.","Logical impasse. Hans Castorp tried to help out—as if it were his metier to guide such a conversation! Of his own accord, he flung into the arena the question of capital punishment. Torture, he said, was abolished—though examining magistrates still had ways of making an accused person pliable. But the death penalty persisted, it seemed impossible to do without it. It was practised by the most civilized nations. The French system of deportation had worked very badly. There was nothing feasible to do with certain half-human beings, except to make them a head shorter!","Logical stalemate. Hans Castorp attempted to help them over it—as if it were his job—by imperiously taking over the conversation and tossing in the issue of the death penalty. Torture had been abolished, although examining magistrates still had ways of softening up the accused, but the death penalty seemed to be immortal, there was no doing without it. The most civilized nations clung to it. The French system of deportation had been very unsuccessful. One simply did not know what should be done with certain subhuman creatures except behead them."
"Joachim machte kurz kehrt und ging ins Zimmer. Als er zurückkehrte, sagte er zögernd:",Joachim turned around and went into the room. When he returned he said hesitantly:,"Joachim turned on his heel and went into the bedroom. When he came back, he said hesitatingly: “Yes, it is 99.5½°.”","Joachim did an about-face and walked back into the room. When he returned, he said tentatively, “Yes, it reads ninety-nine point six.”"
"sang sie anfangs leise und summend, dann laut und aus ganzer Kraft. Sein Bariton war spröde, aber heute fand er ihn schön, und das Singen begeisterte ihn mehr und mehr. Hatte er zu hoch eingesetzt, so verlegte er sich auf fistelnde Kopftöne, und auch diese erschienen ihm schön. Wenn sein Gedächtnis ihn im Stiche ließ, so half er sich damit, daß er der Melodie irgendwelche sinnlose Silben und Worte unterlegte, die er nach Art der Kunstsänger formenden Mundes und mit prunkendem Gaumen-R in die Lüfte sandte, und ging schließlich dazu über, sowohl was den Text als auch was die Töne betraf, nur noch zu phantasieren und seine Produktion sogar mit opernhaften Armbewegungen zu begleiten. Da es sehr anstrengend ist, zugleich zu steigen und zu singen, so wurde ihm bald der Atem {181}knapp und fehlte ihm immer mehr. Aber aus Idealismus, um der Schönheit des Gesanges willen, bezwang er die Not und gab unter häufigen Seufzern sein Letztes her, bis er sich endlich in äußerster Kurzluftigkeit, blind, nur ein farbiges Flimmern vor Augen und mit fliegenden Pulsen unter einer dicken Kiefer niedersinken ließ, – nach so großer Erhebung plötzlich die Beute durchgreifender Verstimmung, eines Katzenjammers, der an Verzweiflung grenzte.","she sang at first softly and humming, then loudly and with all her might. His baritone was brittle, but today he thought it was beautiful and he became more and more enthusiastic about singing. If he used it too high, he resorted to fistulous head tones, and these, too, seemed beautiful to him. When his memory failed him, he helped himself by adding some meaningless syllables and words to the melody, which he sent into the air in the manner of the art singers with a shaping mouth and a magnificent palate-R, and finally proceeded to only to fantasize about both the text and the sounds and even to accompany his production with operatic arm movements. Since it is very tiring to climb and sing at the same time, he soon became short of breath {181}and was missing it more and more. But out of idealism, for the sake of the beauty of the song, he conquered the need and, with frequent sighs, gave his last until he finally let himself sink down under a thick jaw in extreme shortness of breath, blind, only a colorful flicker in his eyes and with flying pulses , - after such a great uproar, suddenly the prey of a thorough depression, a hangover that bordered on despair.","he sang at first softly, in a humming tone, then louder, finally at the top of his voice. His baritone lacked flexibility, yet to-day he found it good, and sang on with mounting enthusiasm. When he found he had pitched the beginning too high, he shifted into falsetto, and even that pleased him. When his memory left him in the lurch, he helped himself out by setting to the melody whatever words and syllables came to hand, heedless of the sense, giving them out like an operatic singer, with arching lips and strong palatal r. He even began to improvise both words and music, accompanying his performance with theatrical gesturings. It is a good deal of a strain to sing and climb at the same time, and Hans Castorp found his breath growing scant, and scanter. Yet for sheer pleasure in the idea, for the joy of singing, he forced his voice and sang on, with frequent gasps for breath, until he could no more, and sank, quite out of wind, half blind, with coloured sparks before his eyes and racing pulses, beneath a sturdy pine. His exaltation gave way on the sudden to a pervading gloom; he fell a prey to dejection bordering on despair.","and he hummed them softly at first, but soon was singing at the top of his voice. It was a brash baritone, but he found it lovely today, and his own singing inspired him more and more. If he started in too high a key, then he would sing falsetto, and he found that lovely, too. When memory failed him, he made do by singing the melody to nonsense syllables and words, tossing them off into the air with the splendid back-rolled r and well-rounded vowels of opera singers, and at last moved on simply to fantasizing both text and music and accompanying these vocalizations with theatrical gestures. But since it is quite an exertion to both climb and sing, he soon found he was short of breath—and it kept getting shorter. But out of idealism and love for the beauty of song, he ignored his distress and, despite frequent sighs, gave it all he had, until finally he sank down at the base of a thick pine tree—totally out of breath and gasping, half-blind, with only bright patterns dancing before his eyes, his pulse skittering. After such exaltation, his sudden reward was radical gloom, a hangover that bordered on despair."
"Hans Castorp verstand nicht gleich. Er ließ sich den Namen wiederholen und buchstabieren, bevor er ihn auffaßte.

"»Nein!« beharrte Hans Castorp mit einer Heftigkeit, die zu dem Widerstand, den man ihm leistete, in keinem Verhältnis stand. »Das lasse ich mir nicht ausreden, daß ein Sterbender etwas Vornehmeres ist, als irgend so ein Lümmel, der herumgeht und lacht und Geld verdient und sich den Bauch vollschlägt! Das geht nicht –« und seine Stimme schwankte höchst sonderbar. »Das geht nicht, daß man ihn so mir nichts, dir nichts –« und seine Worte erstickten im Lachen, das ihn ergriff und ihn überwältigte, dem Lachen von gestern, einem tief heraufquellenden, leiberschütternden, grenzenlosen Geläch{88}ter, das ihm die Augen schloß und Tränen zwischen den Lidern hervorpreßte.","""No!"" Hans Castorp insisted with a vehemence that was disproportionate to the resistance he was being offered. 'I won't let that dissuade me that a dying man is any better than some lout going around laughing and earning money and stuffing his belly! That won't do -' and his voice shook in a most odd way. ""You can't have him like that, nothing, nothing -"" and his words were smothered in the laughter that gripped him and overwhelmed him, yesterday's laughter, a deeply welling up, body-shaking, boundless laughter that he closed his eyes and squeezed tears from between his lids.","“But when one behaves as feebly as that—” “No,” persisted Hans Castorp, with a violence out of proportion to the opposition he met, “I insist that a dying man is above any chap that is going about and laughing and earning his living and eating his three meals a day. It isn’t good enough”—his voice quavered—“it isn’t good enough, for one to calmly—just calmly”—his words trailed off in a fit of laughter that seized and overcame him, the laughter of yesterday, a profound, illimitable, body-shaking laughter, that shut up his eyes and made tears well from beneath their lids.","“But if he starts carrying on in such a weak-willed way . . .” “No,” Hans Castorp insisted with a ferocity not at all appropriate to the mild objection Joachim had offered. “I’ll not let you talk me out of it. A dying man has something nobler about him than your average rascal strolling about, laughing and making money and stuffing his belly. It won’t do.” And his voice began to waver strangely. “It just won’t do to walk up so calm and cool and . . .” But now his words were swallowed in a fit of laughter that suddenly overwhelmed him, the same laughter as yesterday, welling up from deep inside—convulsive, unbounded laughter, until he had to close his eyes for the tears."
"»Aber, in Gottes Namen, Ingenieur, das ist ja ein dummer alter Mann! Was finden Sie an ihm? Kann er Sie fördern? Mir steht der Verstand still!

"Am vierten Tage erst kam er zum Ziel. Von seinem Balkon aus sah er den Verfolgten im Garten dem Gärtner Anweisungen geben, schlüpfte geschwind aus der Decke und eilte hinunter. Eben ruderte der Hofrat mit rundem Nacken gegen seine Wohnung davon. Hans Castorp trabte und erlaubte sich sogar, zu rufen, fand aber kein Gehör. Endlich, atemlos anlangend, brachte er seinen Mann zum Stehen.","Only on the fourth day did he reach his goal. From his balcony he saw the persecuted man giving instructions to the gardener, quickly slipped out of the blanket and hurried downstairs. The Hofrat had just rowed away towards his apartment with a round neck. Hans Castorp trotted and even allowed himself to shout, but was not heard. Finally, arriving breathless, he brought his man to a halt.","On the fourth day he succeeded. From his balcony he saw his prey below, giving directions to the gardener; slipped forth of his covers and ran down. He saw the Hofrat’s back, as he was paddling in the direction of his own house, set off at a smart pace after him, even took the liberty of calling, but the Hofrat paid no heed. At last, breathless, he caught up his quarry and brought him to a stand.","On the fourth day he succeeded. From his balcony, he spotted his quarry in the garden, giving instructions to the gardener. Slipping hastily out of his blankets, he hurried downstairs. The director, his neck arched, was just rowing off toward home; Hans Castorp broke into a trot, even took the freedom of shouting—but got no response. He caught up at last, out of breath, and brought his man to a halt."
"»Gut, lachen wir!« sagte er. »Zur Heiterkeit werden Sie mich immer bereit finden. ›Das Lachen ist ein Erglänzen der Seele‹, sagt ein Alter. Auch sind wir abgekommen – auf Dinge, die, wie ich zugebe, mit den Schwierigkeiten zusammenhängen, auf die unsere Vorarbeiten zur Herstellung des maurerischen Weltbundes stoßen, Schwierigkeiten, die namentlich das protestantische Europa entgegenstellt …« Und Herr Settembrini fuhr {781}fort, mit Wärme von dem Gedanken dieses Weltbundes zu sprechen, der von Ungarn aus ins Leben getreten und dessen zu erhoffende Verwirklichung bestimmt sei, der Freimaurerei weltentscheidende Macht zu verleihen. Er zeigte leichthin Briefe vor, die er von auswärtigen Bundesgrößen in dieser Sache empfangen, ein eigenhändiges Schreiben des schweizerischen Großmeisters, Bruder Quartier la Tente vom dreiunddreißigsten Grade, und erörterte den Plan, das Kunstidiom Esperanto zur Bundesweltsprache zu erklären. Sein Eifer erhob ihn zur Sphäre der hohen Politik, er richtete sein Auge dahin und dorthin und schätzte die Aussichten ab, die der revolutionär-republikanische Gedanke in seiner eigenen Heimat, in Spanien, in Portugal besitze. Auch mit Personen, die an der Spitze der Großloge der letztgenannten Monarchie standen, wollte er briefliche Fühlung unterhalten. Dort reiften zweifellos die Dinge der Entscheidung entgegen. Hans Castorp möge an ihn denken, wenn in allernächster Zeit da unten die Ereignisse sich überstürzen würden. Hans Castorp versprach, das zu tun.","""All right, let's laugh!"" he said. “You will always find me ready for amusement. ""Laughter is a gleam of the soul,"" says an old man. We have also strayed - on things which, I admit, are connected with the difficulties encountered in our preparatory work for the establishment of the Masonic World Federation, difficulties which Protestant Europe in particular opposes ...' And M. Settembrini continued {781}, with To speak warmly of the idea of this World Federation, which came into being from Hungary and whose hoped-for realization is destined to give Freemasonry world-decisive power. He casually produced letters he had received from foreign officials on this matter, a handwritten letter from the Swiss Grand Master, Brother Quartier la Tente of the thirty-third degree, and discussed the plan to declare the artificial idiom Esperanto the world language of the Confederation. His zeal elevated him to the sphere of high politics, he turned his eyes this way and that, assessing the prospects of the revolutionary-republican idea in his own homeland, in Spain, in Portugal. He also wanted to write to people who were at the head of the Grand Lodge of the latter monarchy. There, doubtless, things were ripening towards decision. May Hans Castorp think of him if events down there were to overturn in the very near future. Hans Castorp promised to do that.","“Good,” he said. “Very good, let us laugh, you will always find me ready to do that. Laughter, says the classic, is a sunbeam of the soul. We have wandered from the point, we have taken up questions which, I admit, have much to do with the difficulties encountered by us in our preparatory efforts to establish a Masonic worldfederation.” Herr Settembrini went on to speak of the idea of this world-federation, which had originated in Hungary, the hoped-for realization of which was destined to consummate the world-power of Freemasonry. Casually he displayed letters from foreign potentates of the society: one from the very hand of the Swiss Grand Master, Brother Quartier la Tente, of the thirty-third degree; and discussed the proposal to make Esperanto the official language of the body. His zeal elevated him to the sphere of policy; he directed his gaze hither and yon, estimated the prospects of revolutionary thought in his own country, in Spain, in Portugal. He was in contact by letter, it appeared, with persons who were at the head of the Portuguese lodge, and there, without much doubt, things were ripening to a decisive event. Hans Castorp would think of him when, before very long, it came to an upset in that country. Hans Castorp promised to do so.","“Fine, let us have a laugh,” he said. “You’ll always find me ready for mirth. ‘Laughter is the sparkle of the soul,’ as an ancient once said. And we have strayed to other matters that, I admit, are laden with difficulties, to problems we have encountered in our preparations for an international union of Masons, questions posed in particular by Protestant Europe. . . .” And warming to his topic, Herr Settembrini continued speaking of this international union, which had been born in Hungary and whose longed-for realization would surely confer upon Freemasonry the power to change the world. He casually showed Hans Castorp correspondence he had received from foreign Masonic dignitaries concerning this matter, a handwritten letter from the Swiss Grand Master, Brother Quartier la Tente of the Thirty-third Degree; and he discussed the plan to declare Esperanto the official world language of Freemasonry. His zeal lifted him to the world of high politics; his eye sweeping here and there, he appraised the chances revolutionary republican ideas might have in his own land, in Spain, in Portugal—and claimed to be in contact with persons who stood at the top of the Grand Lodge in that last-named monarchy. Affairs were most assuredly ripening toward decision. Hans Castorp should think of him when, in the very near future, events unfolded rapidly there. Hans Castorp promised he would."
"Es stellte sich heraus, daß der Fremde, der Settembrinis Jahre haben mochte, dessen Hausgenosse war: der andere Aftermieter Lukačeks, des Damenschneiders, Naphta mit Namen, soviel die jungen Leute verstanden. Er war ein kleiner, magerer Mann, rasiert und von so scharfer, man möchte sagen: ätzender Häß{563}lichkeit, daß die Vettern sich geradezu wunderten. Alles war scharf an ihm: die gebogene Nase, die sein Gesicht beherrschte, der schmal zusammengenommene Mund, die dickgeschliffenen Gläser der im übrigen leicht gebauten Brille, die er vor seinen hellgrauen Augen trug, und selbst das Schweigen, das er bewahrte, und dem zu entnehmen war, daß seine Rede scharf und folgerecht sein werde. Er war barhaupt, wie es sich gehörte, und im bloßen Anzug, – sehr wohlgekleidet dabei: sein dunkelblauer Flanellanzug mit weißen Streifen zeigte guten, gehalten modischen Schnitt, wie der weltkindlich prüfende Blick der Vettern feststellte, die übrigens einem ebensolchen, nur rascheren und schärferen, an ihren Personen hinabgleitenden Blick von seiner, des kleinen Naphta Seite, begegneten. Hätte Lodovico Settembrini seinen faserigen Flaus und seine gewürfelten Hosen nicht mit so viel Anmut und Würde zu tragen gewußt, – seine Erscheinung hätte unvorteilhaft abstechen müssen von der feinen Gesellschaft. Sie tat es jedoch um so weniger, als die Gewürfelten frisch aufgebügelt waren, so daß man sie auf den ersten Blick fast für neu hätte halten können, – ein Werk seines Quartiergebers zweifellos, nach beiläufiger Überlegung der jungen Leute. Wenn aber der häßliche Naphta nach der Güte und Weltlichkeit seiner Kleidung den Vettern näher stand als seinem Hausgenossen, so ordneten doch nicht allein seine vorgerückten Jahre ihn mit diesem gegen die Jünglinge zusammen, sondern entschieden noch etwas anderes, was sich am bequemsten auf die Gesichtsfarbe der beiden Paare zurückführen ließ, nämlich darauf, daß die einen braun und rotgebrannt, die anderen aber bleich waren: Joachims Gesicht war im Laufe des Winters noch bronzefarbener nachgedunkelt, und dasjenige Hans Castorps glühte rosenrot unter seinem blonden Scheitel; aber Herrn Settembrinis welscher Blässe, die gar edel zu seinem schwarzen Schnurrbart stand, hatte die Strahlung nichts anzuhaben vermocht, und sein Genosse, ob{564}gleich blonden Haares – es war übrigens aschblond, metallisch-farblos, und er trug es glatt aus der fliehenden Stirn über den ganzen Kopf zurückgestrichen –, zeigte gleichfalls die mattweiße Gesichtshaut brünetter Rassen. Zwei von den vieren trugen Spazierstöcke, nämlich Hans Castorp und Settembrini; denn Joachim ging aus militärischen Gründen ohne einen solchen, und Naphta legte nach erfolgter Vorstellung sogleich wieder die Hände auf dem Rücken zusammen. Sie waren klein und zart, wie auch seine Füße sehr zierlich waren, übrigens seiner Figur entsprechend. Daß er erkältet wirkte und auf eine gewisse schwächliche und unförderliche Art hustete, fiel nicht auf.","It turned out that the stranger, who might have been Settembrini's years, was his housemate: the other sub-tenant of Lukaček, the dressmaker, Naphta by name, as far as the young people understood. He was a small, thin man, shaved and so sharp, one might say caustic ugliness, that his cousins were downright surprised. Everything about him was sharp: the hooked nose that dominated his face, the narrow mouth, the thick lenses of the otherwise lightly built glasses he wore in front of his light gray eyes, and even the silence he kept, and that too it was clear that his speech would be sharp and consistent. He was bareheaded, as was proper, and in just a suit – very well dressed too: his dark blue flannel suit with white stripes had a good, stylish cut, as the worldly childlike, scrutinizing look of his cousins found out, who, by the way, had the same, only quicker and sharper , looking down at their persons from his, the little Naphta side, met. If Lodovico Settembrini had not known how to wear his fibrous fleece and his checked trousers with so much grace and dignity, his appearance would have contrasted unfavorably with polite society. However, she did it all the less as the dice were freshly ironed on, so that at first glance one could almost have taken them for new - a work of his lodger no doubt, after casual reflection of the young people. But if the ugly Naphta was closer to his cousins than to his housemates in terms of the goodness and worldliness of his clothes, it was not only his advanced years that put him in line with him against the young men, but also decided something else, which most conveniently relates to the complexion of the Both couples could be traced back to the fact that some were tanned and burnt red, while others were pale: Joachim's face had darkened even more bronze over the course of the winter, and that of Hans Castorp glowed rose-red under the blond part of his head; but Herr Settembrini's Italian pallor, which went particularly well with his black mustache, had not been affected by the radiation, and his comrade, although his hair was blond - it was ash blond, metallically colorless, and he wore it straight out of the receding forehead all over the head - also showed the dull white facial skin of brunette races. Two of the four carried walking sticks, namely Hans Castorp and Settembrini; because Joachim went without one for military reasons, and Naphta immediately put his hands behind his back after the introduction. They were small and delicate, just as his feet were very dainty, which, by the way, corresponded to his figure. It did not go unnoticed that he seemed to have a cold and was coughing in a certain feeble and unhelpful way.","It appeared that the stranger, who might be about Settembrini’s age, was a housemate of his, the other tenant of Lukaçek the ladies’ tailor. His name, so the young people understood, was Naphta. He was small and thin, clean-shaven, and of such piercing, one might almost say corrosive ugliness as fairly to astonish the cousins. Everything about him was sharp: the hooked nose dominating his face, the narrow, pursed mouth, the thick, bevelled lenses of his glasses in their light frame, behind which were a pair of pale-grey eyes—even the silence he preserved, which suggested that when he broke it, his speech would be incisive and logical. According to custom he was bare-headed and overcoatless—and moreover very well dressed, in a dark-blue flannel suit with white stripes. Its quiet but modish cut was at once marked down by the cousins, whose worldly glances were met by their counterpart, only quicker and keener, from the little man’s own side. Had Ludovico Settembrini not known how to wear with such easy dignity his threadbare pilot coat and check trousers, he must have suffered by contrast with his company. This happened the less in that the checks had been freshly pressed, doubtless by the hands of his landlord, and might, at a little distance, have been taken for new. The worldly and superior quality of the ugly stranger’s tailoring made him stand nearer to the cousins than to Settembrini; yet it was not only his age which ranged him rather with the latter, but also a quite pronounced something else, most conveniently exemplified by the complexion of the four. For the two younger were brown and burnt, the two elder pale: Joachim’s face had in the course of the winter turned an even deeper bronze, and Hans Castorp’s glowed rosy red under his blond poll. But over Herr Settembrini’s southern pallor, so well set off by his dark moustache, the sun’s rays had no power; while his companion, though blond-haired—his hair was a metallic, colourless ashenblond, and he wore it smoothed back from a lofty brow straight over his whole head— also showed the dead-white complexion of the brunette races. Two out of the four— Hans Castorp and Settembrini—carried walking-sticks; Joachim, as a military man, had none, and Naphta, after the introductions, clasped his hands again behind him. They, and his feet as well, were small and delicate, as befitted his build. He had a slight cold, and coughed unobtrusively.","It turned out that the stranger, who was about Settembrini’s age, lived in the same house with him. He was the other person to whom Lukaček, the ladies’ tailor, had sublet rooms. His name, as nearly as the young men could make out, was Naphta. He was a small, skinny, clean-shaven man, and so ugly—caustically, one could almost say corrosively, ugly—that the cousins were astonished. Somehow everything about him was caustic: the aquiline nose dominating the face; the small, pursed mouth; the pale gray eyes behind thick lenses in the light frames of his glasses; even his studied silence, from which it was clear that his words would be caustic and logical. As was the custom here, he wore neither hat nor overcoat, but he was very well dressed: his suit was dark blue flannel with white pinstripes, its cut elegant, understated, stylish—which did not escape the scrutiny of the cousins’ sophisticated eyes, though their gaze was immediately countered by an even sharper, more caustic inspection of their persons. If Lodovico Settembrini had not known how to wear his threadbare petersham and checked trousers with such grace and dignity, the figure he cut in this fine company would not have been to his advantage. But such was not the case, particularly since his checked trousers had been freshly pressed, so that at first glance you might have thought them new—doubtless the work of his landlord, the young men thought in passing. But although in terms of expensive, sophisticated clothes, ugly Herr Naphta had one thing in common with the cousins, it was more than just his advanced years that allied him with his neighbor in contrast to the younger men; there was definitely something else, too, which might best be attributed to the matter of complexion—that is, one pair was either tanned or sunburnt, whereas the other two were pale. Over the course of the winter, Joachim’s face had turned an even deeper bronze, and Hans Castorp’s face glowed pink under his blond hair. Herr Settembrini’s exotic pallor, however, which looked quite refined against his black moustache, had been left totally unaffected by the sun’s rays; and his companion, although a blond—with metallic, colorless, ash-blond hair that he combed straight back from his receding forehead—likewise had the dull white skin characteristic of some darker races. Two of the four were carrying walking sticks—Hans Castorp and Settembrini; as a military man, Joachim never bothered with a cane, and after the introductory handshakes, Naphta immediately crossed his hands behind his back. They were small, dainty hands, just as his feet were dainty, too—but all in proper proportion to the rest of his body. He had a cold, but no one paid any attention to his feeble and not very wholesome coughs."
"Jener Augenblick aber, die gewagte und abenteuerliche Situation, in die Hans Castorp sich nun wieder versetzt fand, das Gespräch, ein wirkliches Gespräch mit Pribislav Hippe, kam folgendermaßen zustande. Die Zeichenstunde war an der Reihe, und Hans Castorp bemerkte, daß er seinen Bleistift nicht bei sich hatte. Jeder seiner Klassengenossen brauchte den seinen; aber er hatte ja unter den Angehörigen anderer Klassen diesen und jenen Bekannten, den er um einen Stift hätte angehen können. Am bekanntesten jedoch, fand er, war ihm Pribislav, am nächsten stand ihm dieser, mit dem er im stillen schon so viel zu tun gehabt hatte; und mit einem freudigen Aufschwunge seines Wesens beschloß er, die Gelegenheit – eine Gelegenheit nannte er es – zu benutzen und Pribislav um einen Bleistift zu bitten. Daß das ein ziemlich sonderbarer Streich sein werde, da er Hippe in Wirklichkeit ja nicht kannte, das entging ihm, oder er kümmerte sich doch nicht darum, verblendet von merkwürdiger Rücksichtslosigkeit. Und so stand er denn nun im Gewühle des Klinkerhofes wirklich vor Pribislav Hippe und sagte zu ihm:","But that moment, the daring and adventurous situation in which Hans Castorp found himself again, the conversation, a real conversation with Pribislav Hippe, came about as follows. It was drawing time, and Hans Castorp noticed that he didn't have his pencil with him. Each of his classmates needed his own; but among the members of other classes he had this and that acquaintance whom he could have approached for a pen. The best known, he thought, was Pribislav, the one he was closest to, with whom he had secretly had so much to do; and with a joyful upsurge in his nature he resolved to seize the opportunity—an opportunity he called it—and ask Pribislav for a pencil. He didn't realize that this was going to be a rather strange prank, since he really didn't know Hippe, or else he didn't bother, blinded by a strange lack of consideration. And so he really stood in front of Pribislav Hippe in the throng of the Klinkerhof and said to him:","But that moment, that bold, adventurous situation, into which Hans Castorp found himself transported after all these years, the conversation—an actual conversation with Pribislav Hippe—came about thus. The drawing-lesson was the next period, and Hans Castorp found himself without a pencil. His classmates needed their own, but he had among the other pupils this and that acquaintance, of whom he might have sought a loan. Yet he found it was Pribislav who after all stood nearest to him, with whom, in secret, he had had to do; and with a joyous impulse of his entire being he determined to seize the opportunity—for so he called it—and ask Pribislav for a pencil. It was rather an odd thing to do, since he did not, in reality, “know” Pribislav at all; but this aspect of the affair escaped him in his recklessness, or he chose to disregard it. So there he stood before Pribislav Hippe, among the bustling crowd that filled the tiled court-yard; and he said to him: “Excuse me, can you lend me a pencil?”","But Hans Castorp now found himself transported back to that moment, to that risky, adventurous moment when he had had a conversation, a real conversation with Pribislav Hippe. And this is how it had come about. Drawing class was next, and Hans Castorp noticed that he did not have his drawing pencil with him. All his classmates needed theirs; but he had acquaintances here and there among the boys in other classes whom he could have approached for a pencil. But the boy he knew best, he discovered, was Pribislav—he felt closest to him, he was the one with whom he had spent so many silent hours. And on a joyful impulse of his whole being, he decided to seize the opportunity—he even called it an opportunity—and ask Pribislav for a pencil. He wasn’t even aware what an odd thing this was for him to do, since he really didn’t know Pribislav—or maybe he simply did not care, blinded as he was by some peculiar recklessness. And so there he stood in the tumult of the brick schoolyard, face to face with Pribislav Hippe."
"Er war weg, verreist, mit dem allerfrühesten Züglein in die Ebene hinunter – natürlich nicht ohne seine Angelegenheiten geordnet zu haben: wer käme auf andere Gedanken! Er hatte seine Rechnung bereinigt, für eine stattgehabte Untersuchung das Honorar erlegt, hatte in aller Stille, ohne seinem Verwandten ein Sterbenswörtchen zu sagen, seine beiden Handkoffer in Bereitschaft gesetzt – wahrscheinlich war das abends oder gegen Morgen zu noch nachtschlafener Zeit geschehen – und als Hans Castorp um die Stunde des ersten Frühstücks das Zimmer des Onkels betrat, fand er es geräumt.","He was gone, away on vacation, with the very earliest train down to the plain - of course not without having put his affairs in order: who could think of anything else! He had settled his accounts, paid the fee for an examination that had taken place, had quietly, without saying a word to his relative, put his two suitcases ready - probably that had happened in the evening or towards morning while he was still asleep - and as Hans When Castorp entered his uncle's room at breakfast time, he found it cleared.","He was off, gone down with the first little train to the flat-land—though not without having put his affairs in order—that we would not suggest. He had paid his bill, and the fee for the fumigation of his room; then, in all haste, without a syllable to his relative, he had packed his hand-bags—probably the night before, or even in the dawning, when everybody else was asleep—and when Hans Castorp entered his uncle’s room at the hour for early breakfast , he found it empty.","He was gone, had left with the earliest narrow-gauge train for the plains below—not without first having settled his affairs, of course. The very idea! He had paid his bill in full, including the fee for a complete physical examination; then, without so much as a word to his nephew, he had quietly packed his two bags—probably that very evening or early the next morning while everyone was still asleep. And when Hans Castorp entered his uncle’s room to fetch him for first breakfast, he found it empty."
"Und der Großvater, der ohnedies den Schoß seines langen und weichen Gehrocks vom Beinkleid zurückgerafft und sein Schlüsselbund aus der Tasche gezogen hatte, öffnete damit den Glasschrank, aus dessen Innerem es dem Knaben eigentümlich angenehm und merkwürdig entgegenduftete. Es waren allerlei außer Gebrauch befindliche und eben darum fesselnde Gegenstände darin aufbewahrt: ein Paar geschweifte silberne Armleuchter, ein zerbrochenes Barometer mit figürlicher Holzschnitzerei, ein Album mit Daguerreotypien, ein Likörkasten aus Zedernholz, ein kleiner Türke, hart anzufassen unter seinem buntseidenen Anzug, mit einem Uhrwerk im Leibe, das ihn dereinst befähigt hatte, über den Tisch zu laufen, nun aber schon lange den Dienst versagte, ein altertümliches Schiffsmodell und ganz zu unterst sogar eine Rattenfalle. Der Alte aber nahm von einem mittleren Fach eine stark angelaufene runde silberne Schale, die auf einem ebenfalls silbernen Teller {38}stand, und wies beide Stücke dem Knaben vor, indem er sie voneinander nahm und unter schon oft gegebenen Erklärungen einzeln hin und her wandte.","And the grandfather, who in any case had pulled the lap of his long, soft frock coat back from his trousers and pulled his bunch of keys out of his pocket, used them to open the glass cabinet, from inside which the boy smelled a peculiarly pleasant and strange smell. All sorts of obsolete and therefore fascinating objects were stored in it: a pair of silver candelabra, a broken barometer with carved figures, an album with daguerreotypes, a cedar liqueur case, a little Turk, hard to touch under his colorful silk suit, with a Clockwork in his body that had once enabled him to walk across the table but had long since stopped working, an ancient model ship and at the very bottom even a rat trap. But the old man took a heavily tarnished, round silver bowl from a middle shelf, which stood on a plate that was also silver, and showed both pieces to the boy, taking them apart and turning them back and forth one at a time, explaining things that had been given many times .","And the grandfather, who had already pulled back the skirts of his long cashmere frock-coat and taken the bunch of keys from his trouser pocket, forthwith opened the door of the glass case, whence floated odours odd and pleasant to the boy’s sense. Inside were all manner of disused and fascinating objects: a pair of silver-branched candlesticks, a broken barometer in a wooden case with allegorical carving, an album of daguerreotypes, a cedar-wood case for liqueurs, a funny little Turk in flowing silk robes, under which was a hard body with a mechanism inside. Once, when you wound him up, he had been able to leap about all over the table, but he was long since out of repair. Then there was a quaint old model of a ship; and right at the bottom a rat-trap. But from one of the middle shelves Grandfather took a much-tarnished, round silver dish, with a tray likewise of silver, and showed them both to the boy, lifting them separately and turning them about in his hands as he told the story he had so often told before.","And his grandfather, who had already pushed back the long, soft flap of his frock coat and pulled a bundle of keys from his trouser pocket, now opened the china cabinet, from whose interior rose a fragrance the boy found both strange and pleasant. All sorts of objects that had fallen out of use, which made them all the more captivating, were kept inside: a pair of sinuous silver candlesticks; a broken barometer, its wooden case carved with figures; an album of daguerreotypes; a cedar chest for liqueurs; a little Turk in a bright silk costume, whose body was rigid to the touch but contained a mechanism that, though it had long since fallen into disrepair, had once enabled him to run across the table; a model of an old-fashioned ship; and way at the bottom, a rattrap no less. But from the middle shelf, the old man took a heavily tarnished, round silver bowl set on a silver plate and showed the boy both pieces, separating them and turning them both about in his hands, all the while reciting a story he had told many times before."
"»Ach so, das wären nun Sie!« sagte er, faßte Hans Castorp mit seiner riesigen Hand am Oberarm, rückte ihn von sich und betrachtete ihn scharf. Nicht ins Gesicht blickte er ihm, wie man einen Menschen ansieht, sondern auf den Körper; drehte ihn um, wie man einen Körper umdreht, und betrachtete auch seinen Rücken. »Hm«, sagte er. »Na, wollen mal sehen, wie Sie sich anspielen.« Und wie vorhin begann er sein Klopfen.","""Oh, now that's you!"" he said, taking hold of Hans Castorp's upper arm with his huge hand, pushing him away and looking at him closely. He did not look at his face as one looks at a person, but at his body; turned him over as one turns a body, and also looked at his back. ""Hmm,"" he said. 'Well, let's see how you allude.' And, as before, he began his tapping.","“Oh-ho!” he said, “so that’s you, is it?” He gripped Hans Castorp on the upper arm with his mighty hand, pushed him away, and looked at him sharply—not in the face, as one man looks at another, but at his body; turned him round, as one would turn an inanimate object, and looked at his back. “H’m,” he said. “Well, we shall see.” And began tapping as before.","“Ah yes, it’s your turn now!” he said; grabbing Hans Castorp’s upper arm with one massive hand, he shoved him into place and gave him a sharp look. But he did not look directly at his face, the way you look at another human being, but at his body. He spun him around, the way you spin an object around, and examined his back as well. “Hmm,” he said. “Well, let’s have a look at what you’re up to.” And he took up his thumping again."
"Nun also stand Herr Settembrini im jäh erleuchteten Zimmer, – Hans Castorp, der sich auf den Ellbogen gestützt und zur Tür gewandt hatte, erkannte ihn blinzelnd und errötete, als er ihn erkannte. Wie immer trug Settembrini seinen dicken Rock mit den großen Aufschlägen, einen etwas schadhaften Umlegekragen dazu und die karierten Hosen. Da er vom Essen kam, hielt er nach seiner Gewohnheit einen hölzernen Zahnstocher zwischen den Lippen. Sein Mundwinkel unter der schönen Schnurrbartbiegung war zu dem bekannten feinen, nüchternen und kritischen Lächeln gespannt.","So now Herr Settembrini was standing in the suddenly lighted room - Hans Castorp, who had leaned on his elbows and turned towards the door, recognized him with a blink and blushed when he recognized him. As always, Settembrini wore his thick skirt with large lapels, a slightly damaged turn-down collar and checked trousers. Coming from eating, he held a wooden toothpick between his lips, as was his habit. The corner of his mouth beneath the beautiful curve of his mustache was taut in the well-known subtle, sober, and critical smile.","And now Herr Settembrini stood here in the suddenly illuminated room—Hans Castorp, who had raised himself on his elbow and turned blinking toward the door, recognized him and flushed. Settembrini wore, as usual, his thick coat with the wide lapels, a frayed turnover collar, and the check trousers. As he came from supper, he was armed with the usual wooden toothpick. The corner of his mouth, beneath the beautiful curve of his moustache, displayed the familiar fine, dry, critical smile.","And now here stood Herr Settembrini in the abruptly illuminated room. Bracing himself on an elbow to turn toward the door and blinking into the light, Hans Castorp recognized him now, and blushed. As always, Settembrini was wearing his heavy coat with the wide lapels, a frayed turndown collar, and checked trousers. He had come directly from supper and, as was his habit, had a wooden toothpick between his lips. Under the handsome upward sweep of his moustache, the corners of his mouth were drawn into the familiar, delicate, dry, critical smile."
»Worauf man denn doch wenigstens wird rechnen dürfen bei einem Menschen ohne Leidenschaft.«,"""Which one can at least count on from a person without passion.""","“As one would expect, from a man without passion!”",“One should at the least be able to count on that much from a man without passion.”
"»Tout le monde se retire«, sagte Frau Chauchat. »C’étaient les derniers; il se fait tard. Eh bien, la fête de carnaval est finie.« Und sie hob die Arme, um mit beiden Händen die Papiermütze von ihrem rötlichen Haar zu nehmen, dessen Zopf als Kranz um den Kopf geschlungen war. »Vous connaissez les conséquences, monsieur.«","""Tout le monde se retire,"" said Mrs. Chauchat. »C'étaient les derniers; il se fait tard. Eh bien, la fête de carnaval est finie.” And she raised her arms to take the paper cap with both hands from her reddish hair, whose plait was tied in a wreath around her head. ""Vous connaissez les conséquences, monsieur.""","“Everyone is going,” said Frau Chauchat. “C’étaient les derniers. Il se fait tard. Eh bien, la fête de carnaval est finie.” She raised her arms to remove the paper cap from her head, with its reddish braid wound round it like a wreath. “Vous connaissez les conséquences, monsieur.”","“They’re all retiring to their rooms,” Frau Chauchat said. “Those were the last; it’s getting late. Ah yes, our carnival festivities are over.” And she raised both arms to remove her paper hat from her reddish hair, wound in a braid around her head. “You know the consequences, monsieur.”"
"»Ach, das ist ›Tous-les-deux‹«, sagte er. »So wird sie allgemein genannt hier von uns, denn das ist das einzige, was man von ihr zu hören bekommt. Mexikanerin, weißt du, kann kein Wort deutsch und auch französisch fast gar nicht, nur ein paar Brokken. Sie ist seit fünf Wochen hier bei ihrem ältesten Sohn, einem vollständig hoffnungslosen Fall, der jetzt ziemlich rasch eingehen wird, – er hat es schon überall, durch und durch vergiftet ist er, kann man wohl sagen, das sieht dann zuletzt ungefähr wie Typhus aus, sagt Behrens, – scheußlich für alle Beteiligten jedenfalls. Vor vierzehn Tagen kam nun der zweite Sohn herauf, weil er den Bruder noch sehen wollte –, bildhübscher Kerl übrigens, wie auch der andere, – beide sind bildhübsche Kerle, so glutäugig, die Damen waren ganz aus dem Häuschen. Na, der jüngere hatte unten ja wohl schon ein bißchen gehustet, war aber sonst ganz munter gewesen. Und kaum ist er hier, was meinst du, kriegt er Temperatur, – aber gleich 39,5, höchstes Fieber, verstehst du, legt sich ins Bett, und wenn er noch aufkommt, sagt Behrens, dann hat er mehr Glück als Verstand. Jedenfalls sei es die höchste Zeit gewesen, sagt er, daß er heraufkam … Ja, und seitdem geht die Mutter nun so {66}herum, wenn sie nicht bei ihnen sitzt, und wenn man sie anspricht, sagt sie immer nur ›Tous les deux!‹, denn mehr kann sie nicht sagen, und hier ist im Augenblick niemand, der spanisch versteht.«","""Oh, that's 'Tous-les-deux,'"" he said. 'That's what we commonly call her here, because that's all we hear about her. Mexican woman, you know, can't speak a word of German and hardly any French either, just a few words. She's been here with her eldest son for five weeks, a completely hopeless case who's going to die down fairly quickly now - he's got it all over the place, he's poisoned through and through, you could say, it's starting to look something like typhus , says Behrens – horrible for everyone involved, anyway. A fortnight ago the second son came up because he still wanted to see his brother - handsome fellow by the way, like the other one - both are handsome fellows, so glowing-eyed, the ladies were over the moon. Well, the younger one had probably coughed a little downstairs, but otherwise he had been quite alert. And as soon as he's here, what do you think, he gets a temperature - but immediately 39.5, the highest fever, you know, goes to bed, and if he still gets up, says Behrens, then he's got more luck than sense. In any case, it was high time, he says, that he came upstairs ... Yes, and since then their mother has been walking around like this when she's not sitting with them, and when you speak to her she always says 'Tous les deux !' because that's all she can say, and there's no one here who understands Spanish at the moment.""","“Oh,” he said, “that’s Tous-les-deux. We all call her that up here, because it’s the only thing she says. Mexican, you know; doesn’t know a word of German and hardly any French, just a few scraps. She has been here for five weeks with her eldest son, a hopeless case, without much longer to go. He has it all over, tubercular through and through, you might say. Behrens says it is much like typhus, at the end—horrible for all concerned. Well, two weeks ago the second son came up, to see his brother before the end—handsome as a picture; both of them were that, with eyes like live coals— they fluttered the dovecots, I can tell you. He had been coughing a bit down below, but otherwise quite lively. Well, he no sooner gets up here than he begins to run a temperature, high fever, you know, 103.1°. They put him to bed—and if he gets up again, Behrens says, it will be more good luck than good management. But it was high time he came, in any case, Behrens says.—Well, and since then the mother goes about—whenever she is not sitting with them—and if you speak to her, she just says: ‘Tous les deux!’ She can’t say any more, and for the moment there is no one up here who understands Spanish.”","“Ah, that’s Tous-les-deux,” he said. “That’s what we all call her at least, because those are the only words you ever hear out of her. She’s Mexican, you see, and knows not a word of German and almost no French, either, just a few scraps. She’s been here with her eldest son for five weeks now, a perfectly hopeless case, who’ll be making his exit soon enough—it’s all through him, his whole body’s poisoned with it, you could say, and at that stage it looks a lot like typhoid fever, Behrens says—gruesome for all involved, at any rate. And two weeks ago, now, her second son arrived up here, because he wanted to see his brother one last time—handsome young fellow, by the way, but then so is the other— both of them pretty as pictures, with those glowing eyes that drive the ladies crazy. Well, the younger one already had a little bit of a cough down below, but was otherwise in quite good shape. And no sooner does he arrive than he has a temperature— and I mean a high fever, a hundred and three right away—he takes to his bed, and if he ever gets up again, Behrens says, he’ll have more luck than sense. But in any case, it was high time, and then some, for him to come up here. Yes, and since then the mother just wanders about, when she’s not sitting with them, and the only thing she ever says to anyone she meets is: ‘tous les deux!’ Because that ’s all she knows how to say, and there’s no one here who understands Spanish.”"
"Joachim hatte gegen diese Absichten denn auch nicht viel zu erinnern. »Es ist gegen die Hausordnung,« sagte er; »du durchbrichst sie gewissermaßen damit. Aber ausnahmsweise, und wenn du nun einmal den Wunsch hast, wird Behrens dir wohl Permeß geben, denke ich. Du kannst dich ja auf dein medizinisches Interesse berufen.«","Joachim did not have much to say against these intentions. ""It's against the house rules,"" he said; “You're kind of breaking through with it. But as an exception, and if you have the desire, Behrens will probably give you permission, I think. You can invoke your medical interest.«","Joachim had not much to bring up against the plan. “It is against the rules of the house,” he said. “In a certain way you would be transgressing them. But Behrens would probably be willing to make an exception, and give permission, if you wanted it, I should think. You might refer to your interest in the medical side.”","And Joachim did not have any great objection to these plans. “It’s against the house rules,” he said. “It would mean breaking them, more or less. But Behrens would probably make an exception and give you permission if you made it a point to ask. You can always claim it’s out of medical interest.”"
"»Sie irren, mein Freund«, versetzte Herr Settembrini mit geschlossenen Augen. »Sie irren erstens in der Annahme, daß Geistiges nicht persönlichen Charakter gewinnen könne. Sie sollten das nicht meinen«, sagte er und lächelte eigentümlich fein und schmerzlich. »Sie gehen jedoch vor allem fehl in Ihrer Einschätzung des Geistigen überhaupt, das Sie offenbar für zu schwach halten, um Konflikte und Leidenschaften zu zeitigen von der Härte derjenigen, die das reale Leben mit sich bringt, und die keinen anderen Ausweg lassen, als den des Waffenganges. All’ incontro! Das Abstrakte, das Gereinigte, das Ideelle ist zugleich auch das Absolute, es ist damit das eigentlich Strenge, und es birgt viel tiefere und radikalere Möglichkeiten des Hasses, der unbedingten und unversöhnlichen Gegnerschaft, als das soziale Leben. Wundern Sie sich, daß es sogar direkter und unerbittlicher, als dieses, zur Situation des Du oder Ich, zur eigentlich radikalen Situation, zu der des Duells, des körperlichen Kampfes führt? Das Duell, mein Freund, ist keine ›Einrichtung‹ wie eine andere. Es ist das Letzte, die Rückkehr zum Urstande der Natur, nur leicht gemildert durch eine gewisse Regelung ritterlicher Art, die sehr oberflächlich ist. Das Wesentliche der Lage bleibt das schlechthin Ursprüngliche, der körperliche Kampf, und es ist Sache jedes Mannes, sich in aller Entfernung vom Natürlichen dieser Lage gewachsen zu halten. Er kann täglich in sie geraten. Wer für das Ideelle nicht mit seiner Person, seinem Arm, seinem Blute einzutreten vermag, {1061}der ist seiner nicht wert, und es kommt darauf an, in aller Vergeistigung ein Mann zu bleiben.«","""You are wrong, my friend,"" said Mr. Settembrini with his eyes closed. “Firstly, you are mistaken in assuming that the spiritual cannot acquire a personal character. You shouldn't mean that,' he said, smiling in a peculiarly subtle and painful way. ""But above all you are wrong in your assessment of the spiritual in general, which you apparently consider too weak to give rise to conflicts and passions of the hardness that real life brings with it, and which leave no other way out than the of the passage of arms. All incontro! The abstract, the purified, the ideal is at the same time also the absolute, it is therefore the actual strictness, and it harbors much deeper and more radical possibilities of hatred, of unconditional and irreconcilable antagonism, than social life. Are you surprised that it leads even more directly and relentlessly than this to the situation of you or I, to the actually radical situation, to that of duel, of physical combat? The dueling, my friend, is not an 'establishment' like any other. It is the latter, the return to the primal state of nature, only slightly tempered by a certain chivalrous regulation, which is very superficial. The essence of the situation remains that which is absolutely original, the physical struggle, and it is up to every man to keep himself equal to this situation at all distance from the natural. He can get into her on a daily basis. Anyone who is not able to stand up for the ideal with his person, his arm, his blood, {1061}is not worthy of it, and it is important to remain a man in all spirituality.""","“You err, my friend,” answered Settembrini, with closed eyes. “You err first of all in the assumption that the intellectual cannot assume a personal character. You should not think that,” he said, and smiled a peculiarly fine and painful smile. “The point at which you go wrong is in your estimation of the things of the mind, in general. You obviously think they are too feeble to engender conflicts and passions comparable for sternness with those real life brings forth, the only issue of which can be the appeal to force. All incontro! The abstract, the refined-upon, the ideal, is at the same time the Absolute —it is sternness itself; it contains within it more possibilities of deep and radical hatred, of unconditional and irreconcilable hostility, than any relation of social life can. It astonishes you to hear that it leads, far more directly and inexorably than these, to radical intimacy, to grips, to the duel and actual physical struggle? The duel, my friend, is not an “arrangement,” like another. It is the ultimate, the return to a state of nature, slightly mitigated by regulations which are chivalrous in character, but extremely superficial. The essential nature of the thing remains the primitive, the physical struggle; and however civilized a man is, it is his duty to be ready for such a contingency, which may any day arise. Whoever is unable to offer his person, his arm, his blood, in the service of the ideal, is unworthy of it; however intellectualized, it is the duty of a man to remain a man.”","“You are mistaken, my friend,” Herr Settembrini retorted with his eyes closed. “You are mistaken first in the assumption that intellectual matters cannot become personal. You should not suppose that,” he said and smiled a singularly delicate and painful smile. “You are, however, above all mistaken in your assessment of the intellect, which you apparently consider too weak to produce conflicts and passions as harsh as those that real life brings with it and that can be resolved only by reaching for weapons. All’incontro! The purified abstraction, the ideal, is at the same time also the absolute, and is thus rigor itself, and contains far more profound and radical possibilities for hatred, for categorical and irreconcilable hostility than are found in social life. Are you surprised that in comparison to the latter, the ideal leads even more directly and inexorably to truly radical situations, to the question of you or me, to the duel, to physical struggle? The duel, my friend, is not just any ‘arrangement.’ It is the final arrangement, a return to the primal state of nature, only slightly moderated by certain chivalrous, but purely superficial rules. The essence of the situation remains what it has been since the beginning, a physical struggle, and it is each man’s duty, however far he may be from nature, to keep himself equal to this situation. Whoever is unable to stand up for an ideal with his person, his arm, his blood, is unworthy of that ideal, and no matter how intellectual one may become, what matters is that one remains a man.”"
"Aber das müsse man einräumen, daß Freiheitspathos die glänzendsten Freiheitsfeinde, die geistreichsten Ritter des Vergangenen im Kampf mit dem andachtslos zersetzenden Fortschritt erzeugt habe. Und Naphta nannte Arndt, der den Industrialismus verflucht und den Adelsstand verherrlicht, nannte Görres, der die »Christliche Mystik« verfaßt habe. Und ob denn Mystik etwa nichts mit Freiheit zu tun habe? Ob sie etwa nicht anti-scholastisch, anti-dogmatisch, anti-priesterlich gewesen sei? Man sei freilich gezwungen, in der Hierarchie eine Freiheitsmacht zu erblicken, denn sie habe der schrankenlosen Monarchie einen Damm entgegengesetzt. Die Mystik des ausgehenden Mittelalters aber habe ihr freiheitliches Wesen als Vorläuferin der Reformation bewährt, – der Reformation, he, he, die ihrerseits ein unauflösliches Filzwerk von Freiheit und mittelalterlichem Rückschlag gewesen sei …","But one has to admit that the pathos of freedom produced the brightest enemies of freedom, the most witty knights of the past in the struggle with the carelessly destructive progress. And Naphta named Arndt, who cursed industrialism and glorified the nobility, named Görres, who had written Christian Mysticism. And does mysticism have anything to do with freedom? Wasn't she anti-scholastic, anti-dogmatic, anti-priestly? Of course one is compelled to see a power of liberty in hierarchy, for it has set a dam against unlimited monarchy. The mysticism of the late Middle Ages, however, has proven its free nature as a forerunner of the Reformation - the Reformation, hey, hey, which in turn was an indissoluble felt work of freedom and medieval setbacks ...","One had to admit that the freedom- pathos had produced the most brilliant enemies of freedom, the most brilliant knights-errant of tradition at war with irreverent, destructive progress. Naphta cited Arndt, who cursed industrialism and glorified the nobility; and Görres, the author of Christian mysticism. Perhaps his hearer would ask what mysticism had to do with progress? Had it not been anti-scholastic, antidogmatic, anti-priestly? One was, indeed, compelled to recognize in the Hierarchy a force making for freedom: had it not set limits to the boundless pretensions of monarchy? But the mysticism of the end of the Middle Ages had shown its liberal character as forerunner of the Reformation—he he!—which in its turn had been an inextricable and tangled weave, a weft of freedom with a warp of mediævalism.","But one had to concede that this pathos for freedom had also brought forth shining foes of freedom, brilliant knights of tradition who did battle with irreverent, seditious progress. And Naphta named Arndt, who had cursed industrialism and exalted the nobility, named Görres, who had written a Christian Mysticism. And did not mysticism likewise have something to do with freedom? Had it not, after all, been antischolastic, antidogmatic, anticlerical? One was compelled, certainly, to see the Church’s hierarchy as a force for freedom, since it formed a barrier against absolute monarchy. The mysticism of the late Middle Ages, however, had demonstrated its liberating tendency by acting as a forerunner of the Reformation—the Reformation, hee hee, which for its part had been a tangled snarl of freedom and medieval reaction."

"Der erschrockene Hans Castorp zeigte ihr mit wilder Miene die Faust, aber sie begriff kaum, was er wollte, – weit entfernt, und mit Recht, von dem Gedanken, daß es angebracht sein möchte, Joachim zu schonen und viel zu sachlich gesonnen, um in Erwägung zu ziehen, daß irgendjemand, und nun gar der Nächstbeteiligte, sich über Charakter und Ausgang dieses Falles Täuschungen hingeben könne. »Da«, sagte sie, indem sie Kölnisches Wasser auf ein Taschentuch goß und es Joachim unter die Nase hielt, »tun Sie sich noch ein bißchen gütlich, Herr Leutnant!« Und wirklich hätte es zu jener Zeit wenig Vernunft gehabt, dem guten Joachim ein X für ein U zu machen, – es sei denn zum Zwecke tonischer Beeinflussung, wie Frau Ziemßen es meinte, wenn sie ihm mit starker, bewegter Stimme von seiner Genesung sprach. Denn zweierlei war deutlich und nicht zu verkennen: daß Joachim erstens mit klarem Bewußtsein dem Tode entgegenging, und daß er es zweitens in Harmonie und Zufriedenheit mit sich selber tat. Erst in der letzten Woche, Ende November, als Herzschwäche sich bemerkbar machte, vergaß er sich stundenweise, von hoffnungsseliger Unklarheit über seinen Zustand umfangen, und sprach von seiner baldigen Rückkehr zum Regiment und seiner Beteiligung an den großen Manövern, die er sich noch im Gange befindlich dachte. Zu demselben Zeitpunkt war es aber auch, daß Hofrat Behrens darauf verzichtete, den Angehörigen Hoffnung zu geben und das Ende nur noch für eine Frage von Stunden erklärte.","The frightened Hans Castorp showed her his fist with a wild expression, but she hardly understood what he wanted - far removed, and rightly so, from the thought that it might be appropriate to spare Joachim and that he was much too objectively minded to to consider that anyone, and now even those closest to the party, could be delusional about the character and outcome of this case. ""There,"" she said, pouring cologne on a handkerchief and holding it under Joachim's nose, ""have a little treat, Herr Leutnant!"" And really, at that time, the good Joachim had had little sense to make an X for a U – unless for the purpose of tonal influence, as Frau Ziemßen meant when she spoke to him about his recovery in a strong, moved voice. For two things were clear and unmistakable: first, that Joachim approached death with a clear consciousness, and second, that he did it in harmony and satisfaction with himself. Only in the last week, at the end of November, when heart failure made itself felt, did he forget himself for hours at a time, surrounded by hopeful confusion about his condition, and spoke of his imminent return to the regiment and his participation in the great maneuvers which he was still in progress thought. At the same time, however, Hofrat Behrens gave up giving hope to the relatives and declared the end to be only a matter of hours.","Hans Castorp, horrified, shook his fist at her, but she scarcely grasped his meaning; she was far from any thought of sparing Joachim’s feelings, and too matter-of-fact to dream that anyone, least of all the next of kin, could be in any doubt as to the character and issue of this illness. “There,” she said, and held a handkerchief wet with cologne to Joachim’s nose, “take a little comfort, Herr Leutnant, do!” And after all, she was right: there could be little sense, at this hour, in keeping up the pretence. It was more for the sake of the tonic effect that Frau Ziemssen still spoke to her son, in a brisk, encouraging voice, of his recovery. For two things were unmistakable: first, that Joachim was approaching death in full consciousness, and second, that he consented to his state, and was in harmony with himself. Only in the last week—the end of November—did cardiac weakness show itself. There were hours when he grew confused, no longer realized his condition, and spoke of an early return to the colours, spoke even of the autumn manœuvres, which he imagined were still going on. Then it was Hofrat Behrens ceased to hold out any hope, and told the relatives the end was a matter of hours.","Hans Castorp’s face registered his horror and fury, and he shook a fist at her. But she hardly seemed to understand what he wanted—since, quite rightly, the idea would never have occurred to her that it might be more tactful to spare Joachim and she was much too businesslike to think that anyone, and certainly not a close relative, could possibly indulge in self-deception as to the nature and outcome of the case. “Here,” she said, pouring some cologne on a handkerchief and holding it under Joachim’s nose, “do something nice for yourself, Herr Lieutenant.” And indeed there was little point now in trying to pull the wool over Joachim’s eyes—except for tonic effect, as Frau Ziemssen put it when she spoke to her son about his recovery in a brisk, stirring voice. For there could be no mistaking two obvious facts: first, Joachim was approaching death with his mind clear; and second, he did so contentedly and at peace with himself. Only in his last week, at the end of November, after the weakness in his heart had become noticeable, were there times when his mind would wander and he would suddenly grow confused about his condition and speak hopefully and happily of a speedy return to his regiment and of taking part in the grand maneuvers that he obviously thought were still under way. It was at this same period, however, that Director Behrens stopped holding out any hopes whatever and told the family it was only a question of hours."

In the company of Captain Miklosich from Bucharest. They say he wears a corset—but that is little to the point. I conjure you, madame, to tell me! Have you a double?

Denken Sie aber, ich bin gar nicht hochgradig, das heißt, ich war es eigentlich gar nicht, noch bis vor kurzem, nicht im geringsten … Bis mir neulich diese Geschichte … Hören Sie nur, ob es nicht das Komischste ist, was Ihnen in Ihrem ganzen Leben …« Und nach Luft ringend, unter Tirili und Trillern, erzählte sie ihm, was ihr zugestoßen war.","""So you're here visiting the High Class?"" she asked.

But I’m not a fever case; that is, I wasn’t in the least, until just now—until this business—listen, and tell me if it isn’t just the funniest thing you ever heard in all your life!” And wrestling for air, amid trills and roulades of laughter, she related her story.","“So you’re visiting high-ranking patients, are you?” she asked. “How amusing and kind of you, ha ha, ha ha.

"Naphta lächelte. Analphabetentum! Da glaube man nun ein wahres Entsetzenswort ausgesprochen, das Haupt der Gorgo {787}vorgezeigt zu haben, überzeugt, daß jedermann pflichtschuldig davor erblassen werde. Er, Naphta, bedauere, seinem Gesprächspartner die Enttäuschung bereiten zu müssen, daß die Humanistenfurcht vor dem Begriff des Analphabetentums ihn einfach erheitere. Man müsse ein Renaissanceliterat, ein Prezioser, ein Secentist, ein Marinist, ein Hanswurst des estilo culto sein, um den Disziplinen des Lesens und Schreibens eine so übertriebene erzieherische Vordringlichkeit beizumessen, daß man sich einbilde, Geistesnacht müsse walten, wo ihre Kenntnis fehle. Ob Herr Settembrini sich erinnere, daß der größte Dichter des Mittelalters, Wolfram von Eschenbach, Analphabet gewesen sei? Damals habe es in Deutschland für schimpflich gegolten, einen Knaben, der nicht gerade Geistlicher habe werden wollen, zur Schule zu schicken, und diese adlig-volkstümliche Verachtung der literarischen Künste sei immer das Merkmal vornehmer Wesentlichkeit geblieben, – während der Literat, dieser rechte Sohn des Humanismus und der Bürgerlichkeit, allerdings lesen und schreiben könne, was der Adlige, der Krieger und das Volk nicht könnten oder nur schlecht könnten, – aber weiter könne und verstehe er in aller Welt auch gar nichts, sondern sei noch immer ein latinistischer Windbeutel, der die Rede verwalte und den rechtschaffenen Leuten das Leben überlasse, – weshalb er denn auch aus der Politik einen Beutel voll Wind mache, nämlich voll Rhetorik und schöner Literatur, was in der Parteisprache Radikalismus und Demokratie heiße – und so fort, und so fort.","Naphta smiled. Illiteracy! Then one believes that a true word of horror was spoken, to have shown the head of the gorgon {787}, convinced that everyone would dutifully turn pale before it. He, Naphta, regrets having to disappoint his interlocutor because the humanist fear of the concept of illiteracy simply amuses him. One had to be a Renaissance writer, a precioser, a secentist, a marinist, a buffoon of the estilo culto, in order to give the disciplines of reading and writing such exaggerated educational priority that one imagines that spirit night must rule where their knowledge is lacking. Does Herr Settembrini remember that the greatest poet of the Middle Ages, Wolfram von Eschenbach, was illiterate? At that time in Germany it was considered disgraceful to send a boy to school who did not exactly want to become a clergyman, and this aristocratic, popular contempt for the literary arts has always remained a characteristic of noble essentiality - while the man of letters, this real son of humanism and bourgeoisie, but could read and write, which the nobles, the warriors and the people couldn't or could only do poorly - but he couldn't and didn't understand anything else in the whole world, he was still a Latin windbag, who manages the speech and leaves life to the righteous people - which is why he also makes a bag full of politics out of politics, namely full of rhetoric and beautiful literature, which is called radicalism and democracy in the party language - and so on, and so on.","Naphta smiled. “That bogy!” he said. Herr Settembrini believed himself to have uttered a word of terror, to have displayed the head of the gorgon, quite convinced that everybody would promptly pale at the sight. He, Naphta, regretted to disappoint his partner in the dialogue, but the fact was, the sight of the humanistic horror of illiteracy simply made him laugh. Verily, one must be a classical literary man, a précieux, a seicentist, a Marinist, a Jack-of-all-trades of the estilo culto, to attach such exaggerated educational value to knowing how to write, as to imagine that where that knowledge was lacking a night of the spirit must reign. Did Herr Settembrini remember that the greatest poet of the Middle Ages, Wolfram von Eschenbach, could neither read nor write? It had been thought blameworthy, in the Germany of that time, to send a boy to school unless he was to be a priest; and this popular-aristocratic scorn of the literary arts was always the sign of fundamental nobility of soul; the literary person, true son of humanism and bourgeoisiedom, could always, certainly, read and write—whereas the noble, the soldier, and the people never could, or barely—but he could do and understand nothing else in all the wide world, being nothing but a Latinistic windbag, who had power over language, but left life to people who were fit for it. Which was the reason why the literary person always conceived of politics as an empty bag of wind; that is, of rhetoric and “literature,” which in political jargon were called radicalism and democracy—and so on, and so on.","Naphta smiled. Illiteracy! And now Settembrini had spoken the word he evidently believed would instill true terror, had held up the Gorgon’s head at the sight of which everyone would dutifully turn ashen. He, Naphta, regretted having to disappoint his vis-à-vis, for he found the humanist fear of the very word “illiteracy” merely amusing. One would have to be a Renaissance man of letters, a verbal dandy, a Gongorist, a Marinist, a fop of the estilo culto, to endow the disciplines of reading and writing with such exaggerated educational importance and imagine that intellectual night reigned where such skills were lacking. Did Herr Settembrini not recall that the greatest poet of the Middle Ages, Wolfram von Eschenbach, had been illiterate? In those days it was thought disgraceful to send to school any lad who did not wish to become a cleric, and this scorn for the literary arts, on the part of the aristocracy and commonfolk alike, had remained the hallmark of genuine nobility; whereas the literary man, that true son of humanism and the bourgeoisie, who could read and write—which nobles, warriors, and common people could do only poorly or not at all—could do nothing else, understood absolutely nothing about the world, and remained a Latin windbag, a master of speech, who left real life to honest folk, which was why he had also turned politics into a bag of wind, full of rhetoric and beautiful literature, called radicalism and democracy in party jargon, and so on and so forth."
"Man sieht, daß wir darauf denken, alles zu sagen, was für ihn einnehmen kann, aber wir beurteilen ihn ohne Überschwang und machen ihn weder besser noch schlechter, als er war. Hans Castorp war weder ein Genie noch ein Dummkopf, und wenn wir das Wort »mittelmäßig« zu seiner Kennzeichnung vermeiden, so geschieht es aus Gründen, die nicht mit seiner Intelligenz und kaum etwas mit seiner schlichten Person überhaupt zu tun haben, nämlich aus Achtung vor seinem Schicksal, dem wir eine gewisse überpersönliche Bedeutung zuzuschreiben geneigt sind. Sein Kopf genügte den Anforderungen des Realgymnasiums, ohne sich überanstrengen zu müssen, – aber dies zu tun, wäre er auch ganz bestimmt unter keinen Umständen und um keines Gegenstandes willen geneigt gewesen: weniger aus Furcht, sich weh zu tun, als weil er unbedingt keinen Grund dazu sah oder, richtiger gesagt: keinen unbedingten Grund; und eben darum vielleicht mögen wir ihn nicht mittelmäßig nennen, weil er das Fehlen solcher Gründe auf irgendeine Weise empfand.","It can be seen that we think of saying everything that can please him, but we judge him without exaggeration and make him neither better nor worse than he was. Hans Castorp was neither a genius nor a fool, and if we avoid using the word ""mediocre"" to describe him, it is for reasons that have nothing to do with his intelligence and have little to do with his humble person in general, namely, out of respect for his fate, to which we are inclined to ascribe a certain transpersonal significance. His head met the requirements of the Realgymnasium without having to overexert himself - but he would certainly not have been inclined to do so under any circumstances or for the sake of anything: less for fear of hurting himself than because he absolutely did not want to saw a reason for it, or to put it more correctly: no absolute reason; and for that very reason perhaps we do not like to call him mediocre, because he felt in some way the absence of such reasons.","It will be seen that we mean to say everything that may be said in Hans Castorp’s favour, yet without fulsomeness, not making him out as better, or worse, than he was. He was neither genius nor dunderhead; and if, in our description of him, we have avoided the use of the word mediocre, it has been for reasons quite unconnected with his intelligence, hardly even with any bearing upon his whole simple personality, but rather out of regard for his lot in life, to which we incline to ascribe a certain importance above and beyond personal considerations. His head-piece sustained without undue strain the demands made upon it by the course at the Realgymnasium—strain, indeed, was something to which he was quite definitely disinclined, whatever the circumstances or the object of his effort; less out of fear of hurting himself than because he positively saw no reason, or, more precisely, saw no positive reason, for exertion. This then, perhaps, is why we may not call him mediocre: that, somehow or other, he was aware of the lack of such a reason.","As is apparent, we are attempting to include anything that can be said in Hans Castorp’s favor, and we offer our judgments without exaggeration, intending to make him no better or worse than he was. Hans Castorp was neither a genius nor an idiot, and if we refrain from applying the word “mediocre” to him, we do so for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with his intelligence and little or nothing to do with his prosaic personality, but rather out of deference to his fate, to which we are inclined to attribute a more general significance. He was bright enough to meet the demands of a modern secondary school without overtaxing himself; in fact, under no conceivable circumstances would he have been willing to do that, no matter what the goal—not so much out of fear that it might be painful as because he saw absolutely no reason why he should, or to put it better: no unequivocal reason. But perhaps that is why we do not call him mediocre—precisely because he felt that in some way or other such an unequivocal reason was lacking."

Instead of complying, he drew his hands away from beneath Elly’s face, and stood up.","He heard a voice murmur: “Speak to him.” Dr. Krokowski’s baritone called him calmly and solemnly by name and repeated his command.

Ich will Sie nicht kränken und gebe zu, daß Sie in großen Schwulitäten sind, aber wir hatten zu Haus eine Geschichte von einer Person, die damit bestraft wurde, daß ihr beim Sprechen Schlangen und Kröten aus dem Munde kamen, mit jedem Wort eine Schlange oder Kröte.

It wasn't in the book how she reacted to that, but I always assumed she must have taken to keeping her mouth shut.'","“That will do, Wehsal. We will sit quiet now, and make up our minds to hold our tongues until we reach the grocer’s and someone gets in with us. That is my wish.

But you know the story about the maiden who by way of being punished for something had snakes and toads hop out of her mouth, a snake or a toad for every word she spoke. The book does not say what she did about it, but I should think she finally had to keep her mouth shut.”","“Well, Wehsal, let’s just be quiet for a while and resolve to say nothing until we’ve arrived at the grocer’s and the others join us. That is my suggestion, those are my instructions. I don’t wish to offend you, and I admit that you are caught up in an awful mess. But there was a story they used to tell at home about a girl whose punishment was that every time she opened her mouth, snakes and toads came out, snakes and toads with every word.

"Das Tienappelsche Haus lag im Hintergrunde eines Gartens am Harvestehuder Weg und blickte auf eine Rasenfläche, in der auch nicht das kleinste Unkraut geduldet wurde, auf öffentliche Rosenanlagen und dann auf den Fluß. Der Konsul ging jeden Morgen, obgleich er schönes Fuhrwerk besaß, zu Fuß in sein Geschäft in der Altstadt, um doch ein bißchen Bewegung zu haben, denn manchmal litt er an Blutstauungen im Kopfe, und kehrte um fünf Uhr abends auch so zurück, worauf bei Tienappels mit aller Kultur zu Mittag gegessen wurde. Er war ein gewichtiger Mann, in beste englische Stoffe gekleidet, mit wasserblau vorquellenden Augen hinter der goldenen Brille, einer blühenden Nase, grauem Schifferbart und einem feurigen Brillanten an dem gedrungenen kleinen Finger seiner Linken. Seine Frau war längst tot. Er hatte zwei Söhne, Peter und James, von denen der eine bei der Marine und wenig zu Hause, der andere im väterlichen Weinhandel tätig und designierter Erbe der Firma war. Den Hausstand führte seit vielen Jahren Schalleen, eine Goldschmiedstochter aus Altona mit weißen Stärkrüschen um ihre walzenförmigen Handgelenke. Sie stand dafür ein, daß der Frühstücks- und Abendtisch reichlich mit kalter Küche, mit Krabben und Lachs, Aal, Gänsebrust und Tomato Catsup zum Roastbeef bestellt war; sie hatte ein wachsames Auge auf die Lohndiener, wenn Herrendiner bei Konsul Tienappel war, und sie war es auch, die bei dem kleinen Hans Castorp, so gut sie konnte, Mutterstelle vertrat.","The Tienappel house lay at the back of a garden on Harvestehuder Weg and looked out over a lawn where not even the smallest weed was tolerated, over public rose gardens, and then over the river. The Consul, although he had a nice vehicle, walked to his shop in the old town every morning in order to get some exercise, for he sometimes suffered from congestion in his head, and returned at five o'clock in the same way, whereupon he did Tienappels was lunched with all culture. He was a heavyset man, dressed in the best English fabrics, with water-blue eyes bulging behind gold spectacles, a blooming nose, a gray sailor's beard, and a fiery diamond on the squat little finger of his left hand. His wife was long dead. He had two sons, Peter and James, one of whom was in the Navy and rarely at home, the other in his father's wine trade and heir-designate of the firm. For many years, the household had been managed by Schalleen, a goldsmith's daughter from Altona with white starch frills around her cylindrical wrists. She made sure that the breakfast and dinner table was plentiful with cold dishes, with shrimp and salmon, eel, breast of goose and tomato catsup for the roast beef; she kept a watchful eye on the hired servants when Herrendiner was with Consul Tienappel, and it was she who acted as much as she could as a mother to little Hans Castorp.","The Tienappel house lay at the foot of a garden in Harvestehuderstrasse; the windows looked out on a plot of lawn in which not the tiniest weed was suffered to flourish, then upon public rose-borders, and then upon the river. The Consul went on foot every morning to his business in the Old Town—although he possessed more than one fine equipage—in order to get a little exercise, for he sometimes suffered from cerebral congestion. He returned in the same way at five in the afternoon, at which time the Tienappels dined, with due and fitting ceremony. He was a weighty man, whose suits were always of the best English cloths; his eyes were watery blue and prominent behind his gold-rimmed glasses, his nose was ruddy, and his square-cut beard was grey; he wore a flashing brilliant on the stubby little finger of his left hand. His wife was long since dead. He had two sons, Peter and James, of whom one was in the navy and seldom at home, the other occupied in the paternal wine trade, and destined heir to the business. The housekeeping, for many years, had been the care of an Altona goldsmith’s daughter, named Schalleen, who wore starched white ruffles at her plump, round wrists. Hers it was to see to it that the table, morning and evening, was richly laden with cold meats, with crabs and salmon, eel and smoked breast of goose, with tomato ketchup for the roast beef. She kept a watchful eye on the hired waiters when Consul Tienappel gave a gentlemen’s dinner; and she it was who, so far as in her lay, took the place of a mother to little Hans Castorp.","Set well back from Harvestehuder Weg, the Tienappel home was fronted by a large garden; to the rear it looked out on a lawn where not the tiniest weed was permitted, a public promenade with roses, and beyond it, the river. Although he owned a fine coach, the consul walked to work in the old city every morning, just to get a little exercise, because he sometimes suffered from congestion of the blood in his head; and he returned home by the same route at five each evening, when, in most civilized fashion, the Tienappels sat down to dinner. He was a heavyset man who always dressed in the best English fabrics. His watery-blue eyes were bulgy behind gold-rimmed spectacles, he had a ruddy nose, a gray seaman’s beard, and he wore a sparkling diamond on the stubby little finger of his left hand. His wife had been dead for years. He had two sons, Peter and James—the one in the navy and seldom at home, the other an employee in the family wine business and the designated heir of the firm. The house had been kept for many years now by Schalleen, the daughter of a goldsmith in Altona, who always wore white starched ruffles at her thick, cylindrical wrists. She was responsible for laying out an extensive cold buffet at breakfast and supper: shrimp and salmon, eel, goose breast and roast beef with tomato ketchup; she kept a vigilant eye on the extra servants hired when Consul Tienappel gave a formal dinner; and she was also the person who, as best she could, acted as a mother to little Hans Castorp."

"Der Oktober brach an, wie neue Monate anzubrechen pflegen, – es ist an und für sich ein vollkommen bescheidenes und geräuschloses Anbrechen, ohne Zeichen und Feuermale, ein stilles Sicheinschleichen also eigentlich, das der Aufmerksamkeit, wenn sie nicht strenge Ordnung hält, leicht entgeht. Die Zeit hat in Wirklichkeit keine Einschnitte, es gibt kein Gewitter oder Drommetengetön beim Beginn eines neuen Monats oder Jahres, und selbst bei dem eines neuen Säkulums sind es nur wir Menschen, die schießen und läuten.","October dawned, as new months usually dawn - it is in and of itself a completely modest and noiseless dawn, without signs and birthmarks, a quiet creeping in that easily escapes attention if it does not keep strict order. In reality, time has no divisions, there is no thunderstorm or trumpet blast at the beginning of a new month or year, and even at that of a new seculum it is only we humans who shoot and ring.","OCTOBER began as months do: their entrance is, in itself, an unostentatious and soundless affair, without outward signs and tokens; they, as it were, steal in softly and, unless you are keeping close watch, escape your notice altogether. Time has no divisions to mark its passage, there is never a thunder-storm or blare of trumpets to announce the beginning of a new month or year. Even when a new century begins it is only we mortals who ring bells and fire off pistols.","October began as new months are wont to do—their beginnings are perfectly modest and hushed, with no outward signs, no birthmarks. Indeed, they steal in silently and quite unnoticed, unless you are paying very strict attention. Real time knows no turning points, there are no thunderstorms or trumpet fanfares at the start of a new month or year, and even when a new century commences only we human beings fire cannon and ring bells."
"Das alles wirkte recht sonderbar auf den guten Hans Castorp. Italienisch verstand er nicht, und das Übrige war ihm auch nicht behaglicher. Es schmeckte nach Sonntagspredigt, obgleich es in leichtem und scherzhaftem Plauderton vorgetragen wurde. Er sah seinen Vetter an, der die Augen niederschlug, und sagte dann:","All this had a very strange effect on the good Hans Castorp. He didn't understand Italian, and he wasn't any more comfortable with the rest. It tasted like a Sunday sermon, although it was delivered in a light and jokingly conversational tone. He looked at his cousin, who lowered his eyes, and then said:","All this was making the very oddest impression on our good Hans Castorp. He knew no Italian, and the rest of it sounded no less uncomfortable, and reminded him of Sunday sermons, though delivered quite casually, in a light, even jesting tone. He looked at his cousin, who kept his eyes cast down; then he said: “You take my words far too literally, Herr Settembrini.","All this had a very strange effect on Hans Castorp. He did not understand Italian—and felt no more comfortable about the rest of it. There was a preachy flavor to it, although it was delivered in the light, bantering tone of small talk. He looked at his cousin—who simply lowered his eyes—and then said, “Ah, Herr Settembrini, you take my words all too literally."

"»Alle Bewegung ist aber kreisförmig«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Im Raume und in der Zeit, das lehren die Gesetze von der Erhaltung der Masse und von der Periodizität. Mein Vetter und ich sprachen vorhin noch davon. Kann denn bei geschlossener Bewegung ohne Richtungsdauer von Fortschritt die Rede sein? Wenn ich abends so liege und den Zodiakus betrachte, das heißt: die Hälfte, die zu sehen ist, und an die alten weisen Völker denke …«","""But all movement is circular,"" said Hans Castorp. “In space and in time, that is what the laws of conservation of mass and of periodicity teach us. My cousin and I were talking about it just now. Can one speak of progress in the case of closed movement without directional duration? When I lie there in the evening and look at the Zodiac, that is, the half that can be seen, and think of the ancient wise peoples...""","“But all motion is in circles,” said Hans Castorp. “In space and time, as we learn from the law of periodicity and the conservation of mass. My cousin and I were talking about it lately. How then can progress be conceived of, in closed motion without constant direction? When I lie in the evening and look at the zodiac— that is, the half of it that is visible to us—and think about the wise men of antiquity—”","“All motion, however, is circular,” Hans Castorp said. “In both space and time, as we learn from the laws of periodicity and the conservation of mass. My cousin and I were speaking about that earlier. Can one speak of progress when motion is a closed system without any direction? When I am lying there of an evening and observing the zodiac—the half of it that we see, that is—and think back to those ancient wise peoples—”"

"Daß diese Persönlichkeit als Clawdia Chauchats Reisebegleiter und also als gewaltige Störung auf den Plan trat, war ein Punkt für sich, durch den sich Hans Castorp in seinen Wertungen nicht beirren ließ. Er ließ sich, wiederholen wir, nicht beirren in seiner aufrichtig achtungsvollen, wenn auch zuweilen etwas kecken Teilnahme für einen Mann von Format, – nur weil dieser gemeinsame Reisekasse führte mit der Frau, von der Hans Castorp sich in der Faschingsnacht einen Bleistift geliehen. Das lag nicht in seiner Art, – wobei wir durchaus damit rechnen, daß mancher oder manche in unserem Zirkel Anstoß nehmen wird an solcher »Temperamentlosigkeit« und es lieber sehen würde, wenn er Peeperkorn gehaßt und gemieden und innerlich von ihm nur als von einem alten Esel und kaudernden Trunkenbold gesprochen hätte, statt ihn zu besuchen, wenn er vom Wechselfieber gepackt war, an seinem Bette zu sitzen, mit ihm zu plaudern – ein Wort, das natürlich nur auf seine Beiträge zu den Gesprächen paßt, nicht auf die des großartigen Peeperkorn – und mit der Neugier eines Bildungsreisenden das Wesen der Persönlichkeit auf sich wirken zu lassen. Das aber tat er, und wir erzählen es, gleichgültig gegen die Gefahr, daß jemand sich dadurch an Ferdinand Wehsal erinnert finden könnte, der Hans Castorps Paletot getragen hatte. Diese Erin{870}nerung hat nichts zu sagen. Unser Held war kein Wehsal. Elendstiefen waren nicht seine Sache. Er war nur eben kein »Held«, das heißt: er ließ sein Verhältnis zum Männlichen nicht durch die Frau bestimmen. Unserem Grundsatz getreu, ihn weder besser noch schlechter zu machen, als er war, stellen wir fest, daß er es einfach ablehnte – nicht bewußt und ausdrücklich, sondern ganz naiverweise es ablehnte, sich durch romanhafte Einflüsse um die Gerechtigkeit gegen das eigene Geschlecht bringen zu lassen – und um den Sinn für förderliche Bildungserlebnisse in dieser Sphäre. Das mag den Frauen mißfallen – wir glauben zu wissen, daß Frau Chauchat unwillkürlich Ärgernis daran nahm; eine oder die andere spitze Bemerkung, die sie sich entschlüpfen ließ, und die wir noch einrükken werden, ließ darauf schließen –, aber vielleicht war es diese Eigenschaft, die ihn zu einem so tauglichen Streitobjekt der Pädagogik machte.","The fact that this personality appeared as Clawdia Chauchat's travel companion and thus as a major disruption was a point in itself that did not deter Hans Castorp in his assessments. He was, we repeat, undeterred in his sincerely respectful, if at times a little cheeky sympathy for a man of stature – just because he shared a travel budget with the woman from whom Hans Castorp borrowed a pencil on Mardi Gras night. That was not in his nature--although we fully expect that some in our circle will take offense at such ""lack of temper"" and would rather see them hated and shunned Peeperkorn, and inwardly only from him than from an old one donkey and squawking drunkard, instead of visiting him when he was seized with the fever, sitting at his bedside, chatting with him--a word which, of course, applies only to his contributions to the conversations, not to that of the great Peeperkorn - and with the curiosity of an educational traveler to let the essence of the personality work on you. But he did so, and we tell it, regardless of the danger that someone might find himself reminded of Ferdinand Wehsal, who had worn Hans Castorp's Paletot. This memory{870}memory has nothing to say. Our hero was no misery. Depths of misery were not his thing. He just wasn't a ""hero,"" that is, he didn't let his relationship to the male be determined by the woman. True to our principle of making him neither better nor worse than he was, we find that he simply refused - not consciously and explicitly, but quite naively - to deprive himself of justice to his own sex by means of novelistic influences let - and about the sense for beneficial educational experiences in this sphere. This may displease the women—we think we know that Mrs. Chauchat took involuntary offense at it; one or the other snide remark she let slip, which we shall add, suggested it—but perhaps it was this quality that made him such a useful subject of pedagogical debate.","True, this personality was the companion of Clavdia Chauchat’s travels, and as such a greatly disturbing element. But that was another matter, and one which Hans Castorp did not allow to prejudice his judgment. He persisted in his sincere and respectful if also rather forward sympathy for this man on the grand scale, regardless of his partnership in the travelling-trunks of the woman of whom once, on a carnival night, Hans Castorp had borrowed a lead-pencil. That was his way; though we know some people, male and female, will not understand such a lack of sensibility, preferring that our hero should hate Peeperkorn, avoid him, call him an old dotard, a drivelling old sot. Instead of which we see him by Peeperkorn’s bedside in his attacks of fever—prattling to him (the word applies to his own share in the conversation, not the majestic Peeperkorn’s) and with the receptivity of inquiring youth on his travels, letting himself be played on by the power of the personality. All this Hans Castorp did, and all this we report of him, indifferent to the danger that someone may thereby be reminded of Ferdinand Wehsal, who once was wont to carry Hans Castorp’s overcoat. The comparison is not pertinent—for our hero was no Wehsal. Depths of self-abasement were not his line. But he was no “hero” either: which is to say, he would never let his relation to the masculine be conditioned by the feminine. True to our principle of making him out neither better nor worse than he was, we assert that he simply declined—not expressly and consciously, but quite naïvely, declined to let his judgment of his own sex be perverted by romantic considerations. Nor his sense of what was formative in experience. The female sex may find this offensive; we believe Frau Chauchat did feel some involuntary chagrin over the fact—a biting remark or so escaped her, to which we shall refer later on. But surely it was this very characteristic of his which rendered him so irresistible an object for pedagogic rivalry.","This personality had appeared on the scene as Clavdia Chauchat’s traveling companion and therefore as a tremendous disruption—but Hans Castorp did not let that alter his judgment of the man. He did not, we repeat, let it alter his honestly deferential, if at times slightly brash sympathy for a man of stature—simply because that man shared traveling expenses with a lady from whom Hans Castorp had borrowed a pencil on Mardi Gras evening. That would not have been like him—though we are quite aware that many a lady or gentleman in our circle of readers may be offended by such a “lack of temperament” and would prefer that he despise and avoid Peeperkorn, that he refer to him, at least to himself, as nothing but an ass, a babbling old sot, instead of visiting the Dutchman during his intermittent attacks of fever, when he would sit down beside the bed for a chat (a word that applies, of course, only to his contribution to the conversation, not to the words of the grand Peeperkorn) and let the power of that personality work upon him the way new sights work upon a tourist thirsty for knowledge. For that is what he did, and we recount the fact, indifferent to the danger of its reminding anyone of Ferdinand Wehsal and of how he carried Hans Castorp’s overcoat. There is no resemblance. Our hero was no Wehsal; the depths of misery were not for him. He was simply not a “hero,” which is to say, he did not let his relationship with the man be determined by the woman. Holding to our principle of not making him any better or worse than he was, we can state that he simply refused—not consciously, not expressly, but quite naively refused—to let ideas out of novels undermine his sense of justice when dealing with his own sex or limit the experiences he needed for growth in this arena of life. That may not please the ladies—we believe we can say that Frau Chauchat was instinctively annoyed by it, one or two pointed remarks that she let slip, and which we shall insert at some juncture, indicated as much. But perhaps it was this personality trait that made him such a suitable object for pedagogic rivalry."
"Die Unterhaltung am Tisch war nicht lebhaft. Joachim plauderte formell mit Frau Stöhr, er erkundigte sich nach ihrem Befinden und vernahm mit korrektem Bedauern, daß es zu wünschen übrig lasse. Sie klagte über »Schlaffheit«. »Ich bin so schlaff!« sagte sie gedehnt und zierte sich auf ungebildete Weise. Auch habe sie beim Aufstehen schon 37,3 gehabt, und wie werde es da erst nachmittags sein. Die Hausschneiderin be{71}kannte sich zu derselben Körpertemperatur, erklärte aber, daß sie sich im Gegenteil aufgeregt fühle, innerlich gespannt und rastlos, so, als stände ihr etwas Besonderes und Entscheidendes bevor, was doch gar nicht der Fall sei, sondern es sei eine körperliche Erregung ohne seelische Ursachen. Sie war doch wohl keine Hausschneiderin, denn sie sprach sehr richtig und fast gelehrt. Übrigens fand Hans Castorp diese Aufgeregtheit oder doch die Äußerung davon irgendwie unangemessen, ja fast anstößig bei einem so unscheinbaren und geringen Geschöpf. Er fragte nacheinander die Nähterin und Frau Stöhr, wie lange sie schon hier oben seien (jene lebte seit fünf Monaten, diese seit sieben in der Anstalt), suchte hierauf sein Englisch zusammen, um von seiner Nachbarin zur Rechten zu erfahren, was für einen Tee sie da trinke (es war Hagebuttentee) und ob er denn gut schmecke, was sie fast stürmisch bejahte, und sah dann in den Saal hinein, in dem man kam und ging: das erste Frühstück war keine streng gemeinsame Mahlzeit.","The conversation at the table was not lively. Joachim chatted formally with Frau Stoehr, he asked how she was, and heard with correct regret that it left a lot to be desired. She complained of ""slackness."" ""I'm so limp!"" she drawled, pretending to be uneducated. She also had 37.3 when she got up, and how will it be then in the afternoon. The dressmaker admitted that she had the same body temperature, but explained that on the contrary she felt excited, inwardly tense and restless, as if she were about to do something special and decisive, which wasn't the case at all, it was a physical excitement without mental causes. Surely she wasn't a house dressmaker, because she spoke very correctly and almost learnedly. Incidentally, Hans Castorp found this excitement or at least the expression of it somehow inappropriate, almost offensive in such an inconspicuous and insignificant creature. He asked the seamstress and Frau Stöhr, one after the other, how long they had been up here (the former had been in the institution for five months, the latter for seven), then gathered up his English to find out from his neighbor on the right what kind of tea she was drinking (it was rosehip tea) and whether it tasted good, which she almost stormily affirmed, and then looked into the room where people came and went: the first breakfast was not strictly a communal meal.","The conversation at table was not lively. Joachim talked politely with Frau Stöhr, inquired after her condition and heard with proper solicitude that it was unsatisfactory. She complained of relaxation. “I feel so relaxed,” she said with a drawl and an underbred, affected manner. And she had had 99.1° when she got up that morning— what was she likely to have by afternoon? The dressmaker confessed to the same temperature, but she on the contrary felt excited, tense, and restless, as though some important event were about to happen, which was certainly not the case; the excitation was purely physical, quite without emotional grounds. Hans Castorp thought to himself that she could not be a dressmaker after all; she spoke too correctly, even pedantically. He found her excitation, or rather the expression of it, somehow unsuitable, almost offensive, in so homely and insignificant a creature. He asked her and Frau Stöhr, one after the other, how long they had been up here, and found that one had five, the other seven months to her credit. Then he mustered his English to inquire of his neighbour on the right what sort of tea she was drinking (it was made of rose-hips) and if it tasted good, which she almost passionately affirmed; then he watched people coming and going in the room; the first breakfast, it appeared, was not regarded as a regular meal, in any strict sense.","The table conversation was not exactly lively. Joachim chatted politely with Frau Stöhr, inquiring after her health and expressing gentlemanly regrets that it left something to be desired. She complained of her “listlessness.” “I’m so listless,” she said, drawling it out with the affectation of the uneducated. Her temperature had already been 99.2 degrees when she got up, and what would it be by afternoon? The dressmaker admitted to a temperature equally as high, but declared the effect was just the opposite with her, that she felt quite excitable, nervous and restless inside, as if some special, decisive event were about to happen, which was not the case at all, this being simply a physical excitation with no psychological basis. She was probably not a dressmaker after all, because she spoke correctly, almost pedantically. All the same, Hans Castorp found her excitability, or at least her discussion of it, somehow inappropriate, almost indecent for such a nondescript, insignificant creature. He asked them, first the dressmaker and then Frau Stöhr, how long they had been up here— the former had been a resident for five months, the latter for seven; he marshaled his English to ask his neighbor on the left what sort of tea that was she was drinking— rose-hip, he learned—and whether it tasted good, to which she responded almost stormily in the affirmative. He now gazed out across the room where people were coming and going: early breakfast was not a strictly communal affair."
{20}»Spreche ich sonderbar?« fragte Joachim mit einer gewissen Besorgnis und wandte sich seinem Vetter zu …,"{20}""Do I speak strangely?"" asked Joachim with a certain concern and turned to his cousin ...","“Have I?” said Joachim, concerned, and turned to look at his cousin.","“Strangely, am I?” Joachim asked, turning to his cousin and looking worried somehow."
"Sie sprachen nicht weiter über den Besuch bei Lauro, und auch im stillen, jeder für sich, enthielten sie sich des Urteils über sein Gehaben. Besser aber gefiel es allen beiden bei Anton Karlowitsch Ferge aus Petersburg, der mit seinem großen gutmütigen Schnurrbart und seinem ebenfalls mit gutmütigem Ausdruck vorragenden Kehlkopf im Bette lag und sich nur langsam und schwer von dem Versuch erholte, den Pneumothorax bei sich herstellen zu lassen, was ihm, Herrn Ferge, um ein Haar auf der Stelle das Leben gekostet hätte. Er hatte einen {470}heftigen Chok dabei erlitten, den Pleurachok, als Zwischenfall bekannt bei diesem modischen Eingriff. Bei ihm aber war der Pleurachok in ausnehmend gefährlicher Form, als vollständiger Kollaps und bedenklichste Ohnmacht, mit einem Worte so schwer aufgetreten, daß man die Operation hatte unterbrechen und vorläufig vertagen müssen.","They didn't talk any further about the visit to Lauro, and even privately, each one for himself, they refrained from judging his behavior. But both of them liked it better with Anton Karlovich Ferge from Petersburg, who was lying in bed with his big, good-natured mustache and his larynx, which also protruded with a good-natured expression, and was recovering only slowly and with difficulty from the attempt to have the pneumothorax made, what almost cost him, Mr. Ferge, his life on the spot. He had suffered a {470}violent shock, the pleurachok, known as an incident in this fashionable procedure. In his case, however, the pleurachok had appeared in an exceptionally dangerous form, as a complete collapse and serious fainting, in a word so severe that the operation had to be interrupted and postponed for the time being.","They did not mention the visit to Lauro’s bedside; even to themselves they refrained from comment on his behaviour. But both were better pleased with their call upon Anton Karlowitsch Ferge from St. Petersburg, who lay in bed, with his great good-natured beard and his just as good-natured-looking great Adam’s apple, recovering slowly from the unsuccessful attempt which had been made to install the pneumothorax in his interior economy, and which had been within a hair’s breadth of costing Herr Ferge his life on the spot. He had suffered a frightful shock, the pleurashock—a quite frequent occurrence in cases where this fashionable technique was applied. But Herr Ferge’s shock had been exceptionally dangerous, a total collapse and critical loss of consciousness, in a word so severe an attack that the operation had been broken off at once, and was indefinitely postponed.","They said nothing further about their visit with Lauro, and even in the quiet of their own rooms, they refrained from judging his behavior. They both enjoyed, however, their visits with Anton Karlovitch Ferge from Saint Petersburg, a fellow with a huge good-natured moustache and a protruding Adam’s apple that somehow seemed equally good-natured; he lay there in his bed, recovering very slowly and with great difficulty from an attempted pneumothorax, which, Herr Ferge said, had come within an inch of costing him his life. It had been a severe shock to his system, a pleural shock, which was known to happen sometimes during the fashionable operation. His had been an exceptionally dangerous pleural shock, a total collapse, an alarming swoon—in a word, so severe that the operation had to be broken off and postponed for now."
"»Natürlich«, sagte Joachim. »Der Mensch müßte diszipliniert werden. Stört da die ganze Mittagsruhe mit seinem Geschwätz und regt die Damen so auf, daß er sie um Wochen zurückbringt. Eine grobe Insubordination. Aber wer will denn den Denunzianten machen. Und außerdem sind solche Reden ja den meisten als Unterhaltung willkommen.«","""Of course,"" said Joachim. 'Man should be disciplined. He disturbs the whole afternoon rest with his chatter and upsets the ladies so much that he puts them back weeks. A gross insubordination. But who wants to be the informer? And besides, such speeches are most welcome as entertainment.”","“I should say I did,” his cousin answered. “The man ought to be disciplined— disturbing the whole rest period with his gabble, and exciting the ladies so that it puts them back for weeks. A piece of gross insubordination. But who is there to denounce him? On the contrary, that sort of thing makes quite a welcome diversion.”","“But of course,” Joachim said. “The man should be disciplined.

"»Er hat wohl kein Geld?« fragte Hans Castorp, der Joachim begleitete. Es sah bei Joachim genau so aus wie drüben bei ihm.","""He doesn't have any money?"" asked Hans Castorp, who was accompanying Joachim. It looked exactly the same with Joachim as it did with him over there.","“He hasn’t much money, I suppose,” Hans Castorp said, entering Joachim’s room, which looked precisely like his own. “No, I suppose not,” Joachim answered, “or only so much as just makes his stay possible.","“He hasn’t much money, I suppose?” Hans Castorp asked as they entered Joachim’s room. It looked exactly like his own next door."
Man kniff die Lippen zusammen. Hans Castorp hüstelte. Wehsal hatte den Unterkiefer schief gestellt. Herr Ferge seufzte. Settembrini bemerkte fein:,You pressed your lips together. Hans Castorp coughed. Wehsal had crooked his lower jaw. Mr. Ferge sighed. Settembrini remarked delicately:,"They all gritted their teeth. Hans Castorp gave a little cough, Wehsal set his jaw awry. Herr Ferge breathed a sigh, Settembrini shrewdly remarked: “There is a kind of generalization that has a distinctly personal cast.",Lips were pursed. Hans Castorp gave a little cough. Wehsal had set his jaw askew. Herr Ferge sighed. Settembrini responded with a subtle remark: “It seems some generalizations reflect on the person making them.
"Es war entschieden, Joachim würde reisen. Radamanth hatte ihn entlassen, – nicht rite, nicht als gesund, aber mit halber Billigung entlassen eben doch, auf Grund und in Anerkennung seiner Standhaftigkeit. Er würde hinunterfahren, mit der Schmalspurbahn in die Tiefe nach Landquart, nach Romanshorn, dann über den weiten, abgründigen See, über den im Gedichte der Reiter ritt, und durch ganz Deutschland nach Hause. Er würde dort leben, in der Welt des Flachlandes, unter lauter Menschen, die keine Ahnung hatten, wie man leben mußte, die nichts wußten vom Thermometer, von der Kunst des Sicheinwickelns, vom Pelzsack, vom dreimaligen Lustwandel, von … es war schwer zu sagen, schwer aufzuzählen, wovon alles sie drunten nichts wußten, aber die Vorstellung, daß Joachim, nachdem er länger als anderthalb Jahre hier oben verbracht, unter den Unwissenden leben sollte, – diese Vorstellung, die nur Joachim betraf, und nur ganz von fern und versuchsweise auch ihn, Hans Castorp, – verwirrte ihn so, daß er die Augen schloß und eine abwehrende Handbewegung machte. »Unmöglich, unmöglich«, murmelte er.","It was decided that Joachim would travel. Radamanth had dismissed him--not rite, not as sane, but dismissed with half approval, on the ground and in recognition of his steadfastness. He would travel down, on the narrow-gauge railway down to Landquart, to Romanshorn, then across the wide, abysmal lake over which the horseman rode in the poem, and home through all of Germany. He would live there, in the world of the lowlands, among people who had no idea how one had to live, who knew nothing about the thermometer, about the art of wrapping oneself, about the fur sack, about the threefold pleasure walk, about ... it was difficult to say, difficult to enumerate all the things they knew nothing about downstairs, but the idea that Joachim, after spending more than a year and a half up here, should live among the ignorant - this idea, which only concerned Joachim, and only from afar and experimentally also him, Hans Castorp, - confused him so much that he closed his eyes and made a defensive gesture with his hand. ""Impossible, impossible,"" he murmured.","So it was settled, Joachim was to go. Rhadamanthus had released him; not rite, not with a clean bill of health, yet half approvingly, on the ground, and in recognition, of his constant spirit. He would go down: first with the narrow-gauge road as far as Landquart, then to Romanshorn, then across the wide, bottomless lake, over which in the legend the rider rode, across all Germany, and home. He would stop there, in the valley world, among men with no notion of the way to live, ignorant of “measuring” and of the whole ritual of rug-wrapping, of fur sleeping-sacks, of the three daily walks, of—it was hard to say, hard to count all the things of which those down below stood in blank ignorance; but the mere picture of Joachim, after a year and a half up here, living in the darkness of that flat-landish incomprehension—a picture only of Joachim, with hardly the faintest hypothetical reference to Hans Castorp himself—so bewildered the young man that he closed his eyes and waved it away with a motion of the hand, murmuring: “Impossible!” And since it was impossible, he would live on up here, alone, without Joachim?","It was definite: Joachim would be leaving. Rhadamanthus had discharged him—not officially, not as a cured man, but with a kind of semiapproval all the same, in recognition of Joachim’s perseverance. He would take the narrow-gauge train back down to the lowlands via Landquart and Romanshorn, then pass over the wide, unfathomable lake (whose frozen surface, as legend had it, a man had ridden across on horseback), and travel the length of Germany to arrive home. He would live there in the world of the flatlands, among people who had not the vaguest about how one had to live, about thermometers, about the art of wrapping oneself, about fur-lined sleeping bags, about three promenades a day, about—it was difficult to say, difficult to enumerate all the things people down there did not know about; but the notion that Joachim, after having spent more than a year and a half up here, would now be living among such ignorant people, that notion, which applied only to Joachim—and merely from a great distance and only quite hypothetically to himself—so confused Hans Castorp that he closed his eyes and dismissed it with a gesture of his hand. “Impossible, impossible,” he murmured."

"Ähnlich mochte wohl so ein Gespräch verlaufen, pfiffig gelenkt von Hans Castorp, wenn das Ergebnis auch nichtig bis zweideutig gewesen war. Denn was das betraf, wie lange man bleiben müsse, um die Wiederkehr eines vor der Zeit Abgereisten zu erleben, war es zweideutig gewesen, in Hinsicht auf die Entschwundene aber gleich null. Hans Castorp würde nichts von ihr hören, solange das Geheimnis von Raum und Zeit sie trennte; sie würde nicht schreiben, und auch ihm würde keine {535}Gelegenheit gegeben sein, es zu tun … Warum denn auch übrigens, hätte es sich anders verhalten sollen, wenn er es wohl überlegte? War es nicht eine recht bürgerliche und pedantische Vorstellung von ihm gewesen, daß sie einander schreiben müßten, während ihm doch ehemals zumute gewesen war, als sei es nicht einmal nötig oder nur wünschenswert, daß sie miteinander sprächen? Und hatte er denn auch etwa mit ihr »gesprochen«, im Sinne des gebildeten Abendlandes, an ihrer Seite am Faschingsabend, oder nicht vielmehr fremdsprachig im Traum geredet, auf wenig zivilisierte Weise? Wozu denn also nun schreiben, auf Briefpapier oder Ansichtskarten, wie er sie manchmal nach Hause ins Flachland richtete, um über die Schwankungen der Untersuchungsergebnisse zu berichten? Hatte Clawdia nicht recht, sich vom Schreiben entbunden zu fühlen, kraft der Freiheit, welche die Krankheit ihr gab? Sprechen, schreiben, – eine hervorragend humanistisch-republikanische Angelegenheit in der Tat, Angelegenheit des Herrn Brunetto Latini, der das Buch von den Tugenden und Lastern schrieb und den Florentinern Schliff gab, sie das Sprechen lehrte und die Kunst, ihre Republik nach den Regeln der Politik zu lenken …","A conversation like this might have gone in a similar way, cleverly directed by Hans Castorp, even if the result was meaningless or ambiguous. For it had been ambiguous as to how long one had to stay to see the return of one who had departed before her time, but nil as to who had vanished. Hans Castorp would not hear from her as long as the mystery of space and time separated them; she wouldn't write, and he wouldn't get a chance to do it either... Why, by the way, should it have been any different, if he thought about it? Hadn't it been a rather bourgeois and pedantic notion that they should write to each other, when in the past he had felt it was not even necessary, or only desirable, for them to speak to each other? And had he actually ""spoken"" with her in the educated Western sense, at her side on the evening of carnival, or had he rather spoken in a dream in a foreign language, in an uncivilized way? So why write now, on stationery or postcards, like the ones he sometimes sent home to the lowlands to report on the fluctuations in the test results? Wasn't Clawdia right to feel relieved from writing by virtue of the freedom her illness gave her? Speaking, writing -- an eminently humanistic-republican affair, indeed, affair of M. Brunetto Latini, who wrote the book of Virtues and Vices and polished the Florentines, taught them to speak and the art of running their republic according to the rules of the directing politics...","Such, more or less, would be the trend of their conversation, artfully conducted by Hans Castorp, who, however, reaped nothing or less than nothing for his pains. How long one must remain in order to see the return of a person departed before her time— on that point the result was equivocal; while as for direct news of the departed fair one, he got simply none at all. No, he would have no news of her, so long as they were separated by the mystery of time and space. She would never write, and no opportunity would be afforded him to do so. And when he came to think of it, how should it be otherwise? Was it not very bourgeois, even pedantic, of him, to imagine they ought to write, when he himself had been of opinion that it was neither necessary nor desirable for them to speak? Had he even spoken with her, that carnival evening— anything that might be called speaking, and not rather the utterance of a dream, couched in a foreign tongue, and very little “civilized” in its drift? Why should he write to her, on letter-paper or on postcards, setting down for her edification, as he did for that of his people at home, the fluctuations of his curve? Clavdia had been right in feeling herself dispensed from writing by virtue of the freedom her illness gave her. Speaking and writing were of course the first concern of a humanistic and republican spirit; they were the proper affair of Brunetto Latini, the same who wrote the book about the virtues and the vices, and taught the Florentines the art of language and how to guide their state according to the rules of politics.","And that was more or less how their conversations went—cleverly steered by Hans Castorp, but with results that were either nonexistent or ambiguous—ambiguous in terms of how long he would have to stay until someone who left too soon returned again, and as good as nil when it came to the vanished lady. Hans Castorp would hear nothing more from her as long as time and space separated them; she would not write, or give him the chance to do so, either. And when he stopped to consider the matter, how could it have turned out any differently? Had his notion that they ought to write one another not been very bourgeois, very pedantic—particularly when all along he had felt it was unnecessary, even undesirable for them to speak to one another? And as he sat beside her that Mardi Gras evening, had he actually “spoken” with her in the manner appropriate to the educated West? Or had he not, instead, prattled on in a foreign tongue, in the less civilized fashion of a dream? And so why write a letter, or even a postcard, like the ones he sometimes sent home to the flatlands to report about the ups and downs in the results of his checkups? Wasn’t Clavdia right to feel excused from writing, simply because her illness gave her that freedom? To speak, to write—indeed that was a splendid humanistic and republican achievement, like that of Signore Brunetto Latini, who had written a book about virtue and vice, had given the Florentines their polish and taught them both how to speak and the fine art of guiding their republic by the rules of politics."
"»Ja, das ist Vorschrift. Von acht bis zehn. Aber komm nun, sieh dir dein Zimmer an und wasch’ dir die Hände.«","'Yes, that's the rule. From eight to ten. But come see your room and wash your hands.”","“Yes, that is the rule. From eight to ten. But come and see your room now, and get a wash.”","“Yes, it’s in the rules. From eight till ten. But come on, let’s have a look at your room, and you can wash up.”"
"Wieder schauderte Elly. Sie seufzte und zögerte mit der Antwort. Langsam führte sie ihre Hände nebst denen der Beisitzer an ihre Stirn, wo sie sie eine Weile ruhen ließ. Dann flüsterte sie dicht an Hans Castorps Ohr ein heißes »Ja!«","Elly shuddered again. She sighed and hesitated to answer. She slowly brought her hands, along with those of the assessors, to her forehead, where she let them rest for a while. Then she whispered a hot ""Yes!"" close to Hans Castorp's ear.","Again Elly shivered. She sighed and shivered as the answer came. Slowly she carried her hands and those of her guardians to her forehead, where she let them rest. Then close to Hans Castorp’s ear she whispered: “Yes.”","Elly shuddered again. She sighed and delayed her answer. Slowly she lifted her hands, and those of the two guardians, to her brow, where she let them rest awhile. Then very close to Hans Castorp’s ear , she whispered a fervent “Yes!”"
"Das war ein minderwertiger Scherz Herrn Albins gewesen! – Er leugnete ehrenwörtlich, und übrigens waren alle auch ohne sein Wort so gut wie sicher, daß niemand aus ihrer Runde den Schlag geführt hatte. So hatte es Holger getan? Sie blickten auf Elly, deren stilles Verhalten allen gleichzeitig auffällig geworden war. Sie saß, die Fingerspitzen bei hängenden Handgelenken auf der Tischkante, an ihrer Stuhllehne, den Kopf zur Schulter geneigt, die Augenbrauen empor-, das Mündchen {1009}aber, verkleinert, etwas nach unten gezogen, mit einem ganz kleinen Lächeln, das zugleich etwas Verstecktes und Unschuldiges hatte, und blickte mit blauen Kinderaugen, die nichts sahen, schräg ins Leere. Man rief sie an, doch ohne daß sie ein Zeichen von Gegenwart gegeben hätte. In diesem Augenblick erlosch das Nachttischlämpchen.","That had been Mr. Albin's inferior joke! – He denied it on his honour, and by the way, even without his word, everyone was pretty much certain that nobody in their group had struck the blow. Was that how Holger did it? They looked at Elly, whose quiet behavior had struck everyone at the same time. She sat, fingertips on the edge of the table, her wrists hanging, on the back of her chair, her head on her shoulder, her eyebrows raised, but her little mouth reduced, pulled down a little, with a very small smile, which at the same time was something something hidden and innocent, and looked slantingly into space with blue childish eyes that saw nothing. They called her, but without her giving a sign of presence. At that moment the bedside lamp went out.","They accused Herr Albin of perpetrating this rather contemptible jest, but he denied it on his honour; and even without his word they all felt fairly certain no one of their circle was guilty. Was it Holger, then? They looked at Elly, suddenly struck by her silence. She was leaning back in her chair, with drooping wrists and finger-tips poised on the table-edge, her head bent on one shoulder, her eyebrows raised, her little mouth drawn down so that it looked even smaller, with a tiny smile that had something both silly and sly about it, and gazing into space with vacant, childlike blue eyes. They called to her, but she gave no sign of consciousness. And suddenly the night-table light went out.","It had been Herr Albin, one of his crude jokes! But he denied it, on his honor; and even had he not given them his word, they were all as good as certain that no one from their group had delivered the blow. So it had been Holger? They looked to Elly, whose total tranquility had suddenly become obvious to them all. She was sitting there with limp wrists, her fingertips barely touching the table’s edge, her back against her chair, her head tilted to one shoulder; her eyebrows were raised, but her little mouth was smaller than ever, drawn downward, but with a hint of a smile that looked both innocent and sly; and her blue childlike eyes were gazing off into space, seeing nothing. They called to her, but not once did she show any sign of consciousness. In that same moment, the lamp on the nightstand went out."
"»Das ist weniger brav, als ich dachte, daß du seist«, sagte sie, und da er wegwerfend auflachte, fügte sie hinzu: »Dein Vetter ist schon gegangen.«","""That's less good than I thought you were,"" she said, and when he gave a dismissive laugh she added, ""Your cousin's already gone.""","“That is not so brave as I thought you were,” she said, and when he laughed deprecatingly, she went on: “Your cousin has gone up already.”","“You’re not quite as well-mannered as I thought you were,” she said. When he dismissed this with a laugh, she added, “Your cousin has already gone.”"
»Aber das Hühnereiweiß. Was ist das?«,"“But the chicken protein. What is that?""",“But the white of egg—what is that?”,“But what about protein? What is it?”
"»Puh! Andate, andate!« wehrte der Italiener fast weinend ab. Man lachte. Dann aber fuhr Settembrini mit Würde fort:","""Phew! Andate, andate!' the Italian objected, almost crying. One laughed. But then Settembrini continued with dignity:","“Fie! Andate, andate!” the Italian fended him off, in a voice almost tearful. They all laughed. But Settembrini went on, with dignity: “No, no, I am a European, an Occidental, whereas the order of progress you describe is purely Eastern.","“Phooey! Andate, andate!” the Italian demurred, almost in a whimper. Everyone laughed. But then Settembrini continued with dignity, “Ah, no, I am a European, an Occidental."
"Denn die Wege waren wirklich kaum gangbar jetzt, sie befanden sich in voller Auflösung, und die Nebel brauten. Der Hofrat sagte zwar, es seien keine Nebel, es seien Wolken; aber das war Wortfuchserei nach Hans Castorps Urteil. Der Frühling focht einen schweren Kampf, der sich, unter hundert Rückfällen ins Bitter-Winterliche, durch Monate, bis in den Juni hinein, erstreckte. Schon im März, wenn die Sonne schien, war es auf dem Balkon und im Liegestuhl, trotz leichtester Kleidung und Sonnenschirm, vor Hitze kaum auszuhalten gewesen, und es gab Damen, die schon damals Sommer gemacht und bereits beim ersten Frühstück Musselinkleider vorgeführt hatten. Sie waren in einem Grade entschuldigt durch die Eigenart des Klimas hier oben, das Verwirrung begünstigte, indem es die Jahreszeiten meteorologisch durcheinander warf; aber es war auch bei ihrem Vorwitz viel Kurzsicht und Phantasielosigkeit im Spiel, jene Dummheit von Augenblickswesen, die nicht zu denken vermag, daß es noch wieder anders kommen kann, sowie vor allem Gier nach Abwechslung und zeitverschlingen{547}de Ungeduld: man schrieb März, das war Frühling, das war so gut wie Sommer, und man zog die Musselinkleider hervor, um sich darin zu zeigen, ehe der Herbst einfiel. Und das tat er, gewissermaßen. Im April fielen trübe, naßkalte Tage ein, deren Dauerregen in Schnee, in wirbelnden Neuschnee überging. Die Finger erstarrten in der Loggia, die beiden Kamelhaardecken traten ihren Dienst wieder an, es fehlte nicht viel, daß man zum Pelzsack gegriffen hätte, die Verwaltung entschloß sich, zu heizen, und jedermann klagte, man werde um seinen Frühling betrogen. Alles war dick verschneit gegen Ende des Monats; aber dann kam Föhn auf, vorausgesagt, vorausgewittert von erfahrenen und empfindlichen Gästen: Frau Stöhr sowohl, wie die elfenbeinfarbene Levi, wie nicht minder die Witwe Hessenfeld spürten ihn einstimmig schon, bevor noch das kleinste Wölkchen über dem Gipfel des Granitbergs im Süden sich zeigte. Frau Hessenfeld neigte alsbald zu Weinkrämpfen, die Levi wurde bettlägrig, und Frau Stöhr, die Hasenzähne störrisch entblößt, bekundete stündlich die abergläubische Befürchtung, ein Blutsturz möchte sie ereilen; denn die Rede ging, daß Föhnwind dergleichen befördere und bewirke. Unglaubliche Wärme herrschte, die Heizung erlosch, man ließ über Nacht die Balkontür offen und hatte trotzdem morgens elf Grad im Zimmer; der Schnee schmolz gewaltig, er wurde eisfarben, porös und löcherig, sackte zusammen, wo er zu Hauf lag, schien sich in die Erde zu verkriechen. Ein Sickern, Sintern und Rieseln war überall, ein Tropfen und Stürzen im Walde, und die geschaufelten Schranken an den Straßen, die bleichen Teppiche der Wiesen verschwanden, wenn auch die Massen allzu reichlich gelegen hatten, um rasch zu verschwinden. Da gab es wundersame Erscheinungen, Frühlingsüberraschungen auf Dienstwegen im Tal, märchenhaft, nie gesehen. Ein Wiesengebreite lag da, – im Hintergrunde ragte der Schwarzhornkegel, noch ganz im Schnee, mit dem ebenfalls noch tief ver{548}schneiten Scalettagletscher rechts in der Nähe, und auch das Gelände mit seinem Heuschober irgendwo lag noch im Schnee, wenn auch die Decke schon dünn und schütter war, von rauhen und dunklen Bodenerhebungen da und dort unterbrochen, von trockenem Grase überall durchstochen. Das war jedoch, wie die Wanderer fanden, eine unregelmäßige Art von Verschneitheit, die diese Wiese da aufwies, – in der Ferne, gegen die waldigen Lehnen hin, war sie dichter, im Vordergrund aber, vor den Augen der Prüfenden, war das noch winterlich dürre und mißfarbene Gras mit Schnee nur noch gesprenkelt, betupft, beblümt … Sie sahen es näher an, sie beugten sich staunend darüber, – das war kein Schnee, es waren Blumen, Schneeblumen, Blumenschnee, kurzstielige kleine Kelche, weiß und weißbläulich, es war Krokus, bei ihrer Ehre, millionenweise dem sickernden Wiesengrunde entsprossen, so dicht, daß man ihn gut und gern hatte für Schnee halten können, in den er weiterhin denn auch ununterscheidbar überging.","Because the paths were really hardly passable now, they were in full dissolution and the fog was brewing. The privy councilor said it was not fog, it was clouds; but that was word foxing in Hans Castorp's judgment. Spring fought a difficult battle which, with a hundred relapses into bitter wintry, lasted for months, right into June. Even in March, when the sun was shining, it was almost unbearable from the heat on the balcony and in the deck chair, despite the lightest clothes and parasol, and there were women who had already made summer and showed off muslin dresses at first breakfast. They were in a degree excused by the character of the climate up here, which favored confusion, meteorologically throwing up the seasons; but there was also a lot of short-sightedness and lack of imagination in play with their cheekiness, that stupidity of momentary creatures who are unable to think that things can still turn out differently, as well as above all greed for variety and time-consuming impatience: it was March , that was spring, that was as good as summer, and people pulled out their muslin dresses to show themselves in before fall came. And he did, in a way. In April cloudy, cold, wet days fell, the continuous rain giving way to snow, to whirling fresh snow. Fingers froze in the loggia, the two camel's hair blankets went back to work, it wasn't long before people grabbed their fur sacks, the administration decided to turn on the heat, and everyone complained that they were being cheated of their spring. Everything was covered in thick snow towards the end of the month; But then the foehn came, predicted, weathered by experienced and sensitive guests: Frau Stöhr, the ivory-colored Levi, and no less the widow Hessenfeld all felt it in unison, even before the tiniest cloud appeared over the summit of the granite mountain in the south. Frau Hessenfeld was soon prone to crying fits, Levi became bedridden, and Frau Stohr, who stubbornly bared her buck teeth, expressed the hourly superstitious fear that she might suffer a hemorrhage; because it was said that the foehn wind promoted and brought about such things. It was unbelievably warm, the heating went out, the balcony door was left open overnight and it was still eleven degrees in the room in the morning; the snow melted enormously, it turned ice-colored, porous and full of holes, sagging where it lay in heaps, seemed to crawl into the earth. Seeping, sintering and trickling was everywhere, a drop and a tumble in the forest, and the shoveled barriers on the roads, the pale carpets of the meadows disappeared, even if the masses had lain down far too plentifully to disappear quickly. There were wondrous apparitions, spring surprises on official routes in the valley, magical, never seen before. A broad meadow lay there - in the background the Schwarzhorn cone towered, still completely covered in snow, with the Scalettagletscher on the right nearby, also still covered in deep snow, and the area with its haystack somewhere was still covered in snow, albeit the top already thin and sparse, broken here and there by rough and dark elevations, punctured everywhere by dry grass. However, as the hikers found, it was an irregular kind of snow cover that this meadow showed - in the distance, towards the wooded slopes, it was denser, but in the foreground, before the eyes of the examiners, it was still wintry dry and discolored grass with snow only sprinkled, dabbed, flowered... They looked at it closer, they bent over it in amazement - that wasn't snow, it was flowers, snow flowers, flower snow, short-stemmed little calyxes, white and bluish white, it was Crocuses, by their honor, sprouted by the millions from the seeping meadow bottom, so dense that one could easily have mistaken it for snow, into which it continued to merge indistinguishably.","For the roads were really hardly passable. They streamed with water and reeked with mist. The Hofrat, indeed, said it was not mist, only cloud; but in Hans Castorp ’s judgment this was quibbling. The spring fought out a bitter struggle, with a hundred setbacks into the depth of winter; the battle lasted months long, well into June. There were times in March when the heat was almost unendurable, as one lay, in the lightest of clothing, in the reclining-chair on the balcony, with the little parasol erected against the sun. In those days some of the ladies plumped for summer, and arrayed themselves in muslins for early breakfast—excusably, perhaps, in view of the singularity of the climate up here, which was favourable to illusion on the score of weather, jumbling, as it did, all the seasons together. Yet their forehandedness was but short-sightedness after all, showing paucity of imagination, the stupidity which cannot conceive anything beyond the present moment; even more was it an avidity for change, a time-devouring restlessness and impatience. It was March by the calendar, therefore it was spring, which meant as good as summer; and they pulled out their summer clothes, to appear in them before autumn should overtake them. Which, in fact, it did. With April, cold, wet, cloudy weather set in. A long spell of rain turned at length into flurries of fresh snow. Fingers were stiff in the loggia, both camel’s-hair rugs were called into service, it did not lack much of putting the fur sleeping-sack in requisition anew; the management brought itself to turn on the heat, and on all hands were heard bitter complainings—the spring had betrayed them. Toward the end of the month the valley lay deep in snow; but then it thawed, just as certain experienced or weather-sensitive among the guests had prophesied it would: Frau Stöhr, the ivory Levi, but equally the Widow Hessenfeld, smelt and felt it simultaneously, before ever the smallest little cloud showed itself over the top of the granite formation to the south. Frau Hessenfeld got colic, Fräulein Levi became bedridden, and Frau Stöhr, drawing back her lips from her ratlike teeth with the churlish expression she had, daily and hourly gave utterance to her superstitious fear of a hæmorrhage—for it was common talk that the thaw brought them about, or at least favoured them. It became unbelievably warm. The heat was turned off, balcony doors were left open all night, and still it was over fifty degrees in the morning. The snow melted apace, it turned grey, became porous and saturated; the drifts shrank together, and seemed to sink into the earth. There was a gurgling, a trickling and oozing, all abroad. The trees dripped, their masses of snow slid off; the shovelled-up barricades in the streets, the pallid layers carpeting the meadows, disappeared alike, though not all at once, they had lain too heavy for that. Then what lovely apparitions of the springtime revealed themselves! It was unheard-of, fairylike. There lay the broad meadows, with the coneshaped summit of the Schwarzhorn towering in the background, still in snow, and close in on the right the snow-buried Skaletta glacier. The common scene of pasture and hayrick was still snow-clad, though with a thin and scanty coat, that everywhere showed bare patches of dark earth or dry grass sucking through. Yet after all, the cousins found, what a curious sort of snow it was! Thick in the distance, next the wooded slopes, but in the foreground a mere sprinkling at most; the stretches of discoloured and winter-killed grass were dappled or sprigged with white. They looked closer, they bent down surprised— it was not snow , it was flowers: snow-flowers, a snow of flowers, short-stemmed chalices of white and palest blue. They were crocuses, no less; sprung by millions from the soggy meadow-bottom, and so thick that one actually confused them with the snow into which they merged.","The paths were really barely passable now, were simply melting away, and fogs brewed all around. To be sure, the director claimed it wasn’t fog, only clouds; but that was merely verbal chicanery in Hans Castorp’s opinion. Spring had to fight a difficult battle for months, all the way to June, with a hundred setbacks into bitterest winter. On sunny days in March, it got so hot out on the balcony that it was almost impossible to lie in a lounge chair, even with light clothes and a sunshade; and there were ladies who pretended it was already summer and appeared at first breakfast in muslin dresses. They could be excused to some extent, given the peculiar nature of the climate up here, which encouraged confusion by throwing the seasons into a meteorological jumble; but there was also a great deal of shortsightedness and lack of imagination in their impertinence—theirs was the foolishness of creatures of the moment, incapable of thinking that things may change again, craving constant variety, and devouring time in their impatience. The date was March, it was spring, that was practically summer, and you got out your muslin dresses so that you could show them off before autumn came. Which it did, so to speak. In April, a series of gloomy, chilly, damp days set in, with steady showers that then turned to snow, flurries of new, wet snow. Fingers grew numb as you lay on the balcony—both camel-hair blankets had to be put back into service, and fur-lined sleeping bags were almost required again; management decided to turn on the heat, and people complained they had been cheated out of spring. By the end of the month, everything lay under a heavy blanket of snow; but then foehn winds set in—just as predicted by experienced, impressionable guests, who had scented it in the air: Frau Stöhr, Fräulein Levi of the ivory complexion, even the widow Hessenfeld—they were unanimous in claiming they felt it before even the smallest cloud appeared above the granite peaks to the south. Frau Hessenfeld tended to crying jags, Fräulein Levi took to her bed, and Frau Stöhr, obstinately baring her rabbitlike teeth, announced almost hourly her superstitious fear of a sudden hemorrhage, for it was said foehn winds hastened and caused such things. It was now unbelievably warm, the heat was turned off, people left balcony doors open at night and it would still be fifty-seven degrees in their rooms the next morning; the snow was melting fast—turned ice-gray, became porous and honeycombed; great drifts of it sagged now, seemed to creep back into the earth. Water seeped, trickled, dribbled everywhere—it dripped, then gushed in the forests. The shoveled piles of snow along the streets and the pallid carpets on the meadows disappeared, although the masses of white had been far too thick to vanish quickly. And the strangest things could happen—vernal surprises on a walk to the valley, things you had never seen before, straight out of a fairy tale. Before you lay a wide meadow—the snow-clad cone of Schwarzhorn towered in the background, the snowbound Scaletta Glacier just to its right, and even the wider terrain, with its hayshed hidden somewhere, still lay under a cover of snow, though it was thin and sparse now, interrupted here and there by rough, dark mounds of earth, with tufts of dry grasses sticking up everywhere. But that meadow there, the cousins noticed— what a peculiar sort of snow-cover it had: thicker farther back up near the wooded slope, but nearer in the foreground, where the grass was discolored and ravaged by winter, there was only a sprinkling of snow, like polka dots, like little flowers. They took a closer look, bent down in astonishment—that wasn’t snow, those were flowers, snowdrops, blossoming snow, no doubt of it, little chalices on short stems, white or whitish-blue, a kind of crocus, millions of them, growing so thick you could easily have taken them for snow, into which they blended indiscernibly."
"Er sprach sehr eindringlich und ungewöhnlich zusammenhängend von den Ptisanen und Giften, und Hans Castorp hörte ihm mit schrägem Kopfe nickend zu, beschäftigt weniger mit dem Inhalt seiner Reden, der ihm am Herzen zu liegen schien, als mit dem stillen Erkunden seiner Persönlichkeitswirkung, die letzten Endes ebenso unerklärlich war wie die Wirkung der Schlangengifte. Dynamik, sagte Peeperkorn, sei alles in der {875}Welt der Stoffe, – das Weitere sei völlig bedingt. Auch das Chinin sei ein Heilgift, kraftvoll in erster Linie. Vier Gramm davon machten taub, schwindelig, kurzatmig, brächten Sehstörungen hervor wie Atropin, berauschten wie Alkohol, und die Arbeiter in Chininfabriken hätten entzündete Augen und geschwollene Lippen, litten an Hautausschlägen. Und er fing an, von der Cinchona, dem Chinabaum, zu erzählen, von den Urwäldern der Kordilleren, wo er in dreitausend Meter Höhe seine Heimat habe, und von wo seine Rinde als »Jesuitenpulver« so spät nach Spanien gekommen sei, – den Eingeborenen Südamerikas in ihren Kräften seit langem bekannt; er schilderte die gewaltigen Cinchonaplantagen der niederländischen Regierung auf Java, von wo alljährlich viele Millionen Pfund der rötlich zimtähnlichen Rindenröhren nach Amsterdam und London verschifft würden … Die Rinden überhaupt, das Rindengewebe der Holzgewächse, von der Epidermis bis zum Cambium, – sie hätten es in sich, sagte Peeperkorn, fast immer besäßen sie außerordentliche dynamische Tugenden, im Guten wie im Bösen, – die Drogenkunde der farbigen Völker sei der unsrigen da weit überlegen. Auf einigen Inseln östlich von Neuguinea bereiteten sich die jungen Leute einen Liebeszauber, indem sie die Rinde eines bestimmten Baumes, der wahrscheinlich ein Giftbaum sei, wie der Antiaris toxicaria von Java, der gleich dem Manzanillabaum durch seine Ausdünstung die Luft rings um sich her vergiften und Mensch und Tier zu Tode betäuben solle, – indem sie also die Rinde dieses Baumes zu Pulver zerrieben, das Pulver mit Kokosnußschnitzeln vermischten, die Mischung in ein Blatt rollten und brieten. Sie spritzten dann den Saft des Gemengsels der Spröden, der es gelte, im Schlaf ins Gesicht, und sie entbrenne für den, der gespritzt habe. Zuweilen sei es die Wurzelrinde, die es in sich habe, wie diejenige einer Schlingpflanze des Malaiischen Archipels, Strychnos Tieuté genannt, aus der die Eingeborenen {876}unter Beigabe von Schlangengift das Upas-Radscha bereiteten, eine Droge, die, in die Blutbahn gebracht, z.B. durch Pfeilschuß, aufs allerschnellste den Tod herbeiführe, ohne daß jemand dem jungen Hans Castorp würde zu sagen wissen, wie das eigentlich geschähe. Nur so viel sei deutlich, daß das Upas in dynamischer Beziehung dem Strychnin nahe stehe … Und Peeperkorn, im Bette nun vollends aufgerichtet und dann und wann mit leicht zitternder Kapitänshand das Weinglas zu seinen zerrissenen Lippen führend, um große, durstige Züge zu nehmen, erzählte vom Krähenaugenbaum der Koromandelküste, aus dessen orangegelben Beeren, den »Krähenaugen«, das allerdynamischste Alkaloid, Strychnin geheißen, gewonnen werde, – erzählte mit flüsternd herabgesetzter Stimme und hochgezogener Stirnlineatur von dem aschgrauen Geäst, dem auffallend glänzenden Blätterwerk und den gelbgrünen Blüten dieses Baumes, so daß dem jungen Hans Castorp ein zugleich tristes und hysterisch-buntfarbiges Bild von einem Baume vor Augen stand und ihm alles in allem etwas unheimlich zumute wurde.","He spoke very urgently and unusually coherently about the ptisans and poisons, and Hans Castorp listened to him with a nod, his head tilted, less concerned with the content of his speeches, which seemed to be close to his heart, than with the quiet exploration of his personality impact, the last ones Ended was just as inexplicable as the effect of the snake venoms. Dynamics, said Peeperkorn, is everything in the {875}world of matter - everything else is entirely conditioned. Quinine is also a medicinal poison, powerful in the first place. Four grams of it made you deaf, dizzy, short of breath, produced vision problems like atropine, intoxicated like alcohol, and the workers in quinine factories had sore eyes and swollen lips, suffered from skin rashes. And he began to talk about the cinchona, the China tree, about the primeval forests of the Cordilleras, where it is at home at an altitude of three thousand meters, and from where its bark came to Spain so late as ""Jesuit powder"" - the natives South America in their forces has long been known; he described the huge cinchona plantations of the Dutch government on Java, from where many millions of pounds of the reddish cinnamon-like bark tubes were shipped to Amsterdam and London every year ... The bark in general, the bark tissue of the woody plants, from the epidermis to the cambium - they had it all , said Peeperkorn, they almost always possess extraordinary dynamic virtues, for better or for worse, - the drug science of the colored peoples is far superior to ours in that respect. On some islands east of New Guinea the young people prepared a love charm by using the bark of a certain tree, which was probably a poisonous tree, like the Antiaris toxicaria of Java, which, like the manzanilla tree, poisons the air around it with its exhalation and to stun man and beast to death, - that is, by grinding the bark of this tree into powder, mixing the powder with shredded coconut, rolling the mixture into a sheet and frying. They then splashed the juice of the mixture of the brittle, which is important, in their faces while they were sleeping, and it ignited for the one who had injected. Sometimes it is the root bark that has it all, like that of a climbing plant of the Malayan Archipelago, called Strychnos Tieuté, from which the natives {876}with the addition of snake venom prepared the upas rajah, a drug that, brought into the bloodstream , for example by shooting an arrow, to bring about death as quickly as possible, without anyone being able to tell young Hans Castorp how that actually happened. Only so much is clear that the upas is dynamically close to strychnine ... And Peeperkorn, now fully erect in bed and now and then, with the captain's slightly trembling hand, bringing the wine glass to his torn lips in order to take long, thirsty gulps, told the story from the crow's eye tree on the Coromandel coast, from whose orange-yellow berries, the ""crow's eyes"", the most dynamic alkaloid, called strychnine, is obtained - told in a low whispering voice and raised forehead lines about the ash-grey branches, the strikingly shiny foliage and the yellow-green flowers of this tree, so that the young Hans Castorp saw a picture of a tree that was at once sad and hysterically colorful and all in all he felt a little uncanny.","He spoke very impressively, and with unwonted coherence, of drugs and poisons, and Hans Castorp listened and nodded; less concerned with the content of his speech—he seemed to have the subject much at heart—than with silently exploring this extraordinary personality, which in the end remained as inexplicable as the operation of the snake-poison he was discussing. In the world of matter, Peeperkorn said, everything depended on dynamics, all else being entirely hypothetical. Quinine was one of the medicinal poisons; one of the strongest of these. Four grammes could make one deaf and giddy and short-winded; it acted like atropine on the visual organs, it was as intoxicating as alcohol; workers in quinine factories had inflamed eyes and swollen lips and suffered from affections of the skin. Peeperkorn described the cinchona, the quinine-tree, in the primeval forests of the Cordilleras, three thousand metres above sea-level. Its bark, called Peruvian or Jesuits’ bark, came late to Spain, long after the natives of South America knew its use. He spoke of the enormous quinine plantations owned by the Dutch government in Java, whence yearly many million pounds of the coils of reddish bark, like cinnamon, were shipped to Amsterdam and London. In fact, said Peeperkorn, bark, the wood-fibre itself, from the epidermis to the cambium, contained, almost always, extraordinary dynamic virtue, for good or evil. The knowledge of drugs possessed by the coloured races was far superior to our own. In certain islands east of Dutch New Guinea, youths and maidens prepared a love charm from the bark of a tree—it was probably poisonous, like the manzanilla tree, or the antiaris toxicaria, the deadly upas-tree of Java, which could poison the air round with its steam and fatally stupefy man and beast. This bark they powdered and mixed with coconut shavings, rolled the mixture into a sheet and toasted it, then sprinkled a brew in the face of the reluctant one, who was straightway inflamed with love for the sprinkler. Sometimes it was the bark of the root that contained the principle, as was the case with a certain creeper growing in the Malay Archipelago, called strychnos tieuté, from which the natives prepared the upas- radsha, by adding snake-venom. This drug caused immediate death when introduced into the circulation—as for instance by means of an arrow—but nobody could explain how it operated. All that seemed clear was that the upas had a dynamic relation with strychnine. . . Peeperkorn, by this time, was sitting erect in his bed; now and then, with a hand that slightly trembled, conveying the wineglass to his cracked lips, to take great, thirsty draughts. He went on to speak of the “crows’-eye” tree of the Coromandel Coast, from the orange-yellow berries of which—the crows’ eyes—was extracted the most powerful alkaloid of all, strychnine. His voice sank to a whisper, and the great folds of his brow rose high, as he described to Hans Castorp the ash-grey boughs, the strikingly glossy foliage and yellow-green blossoms; the picture of this tree conjured up in the mind’s eye of the young man was luridly, almost hysterically garish—it made him shudder.","He spoke very forcefully and with unusual coherence about medicines and poisons, and Hans Castorp tilted his head and nodded as he listened, less concerned with the contents of what was said, which seemed very important to the Dutchman, than with quietly exploring the effects of the man’s personality, which ultimately was as inexplicable as the effects of snake venoms. Dynamics, that was everything in the world of substances, Peeperkorn said, all else was relative. Quinine was a therapeutic poison, too, of first-class potency. Four grams of it caused dizziness, deafness, shortness of breath, produced blurred vision like atropine, intoxicated like alcohol; and the workers in quinine factories had bloodshot eyes and swollen lips, suffered from skin rashes. And he began to talk about the cinchona, the china-bark tree, about the primeval forests of the Cordillera, where it grew at altitudes above ten thousand feet, which was why the bark, known as “Jesuits’ powder,” had been so late in coming to Spain—though the natives of South America had long known its powers. He described the Dutch government’s massive cinchona plantations on Java, from which each year many millions of pounds of the bark were exported in the form of reddish, cinnamon-like quills to Amsterdam and London. There was something about bark as such, the tissue between the epidermis and the cambium of ligneous plants, Peeperkorn said—it almost always possessed extraordinary dynamic virtues, both for good and evil. Primitive peoples’ understanding of such drugs far exceeded our own. On some islands east of New Guinea young people prepared a love potion from the bark of a particular tree, presumably a poisonous species like the Antiaris toxicaria of Java, which like the manzanilla tree exhaled toxic vapors that could fatally stupefy man and beast. They took the bark of this tree, then ground it into a powder, mixed the powder with rasped coconut, rolled the mixture in a leaf, and roasted it. They then sprinkled the tea from this mixture into the face of the desired reluctant lover while she slept, causing her to burn with love for whoever sprinkled it. Sometimes it was the bark of roots that had such qualities, like those of a vine on the Malay peninsula called Strychnos tieuté, with which the natives mixed snake venom to make upas-rajah, a drug that when introduced into the bloodstream, with a dart or arrow for instance, led to almost instant death, although there was no one who could have told young Hans Castorp how it actually did so. This much was clear, however: upas stood in close dynamic relationship to strychnine. Peeperkorn was sitting up in bed now and with a lightly trembling captain’s hand he would occasionally set the wineglass to his ragged lips and take great, thirsty gulps. He went on to speak about the “crow’s-eye tree” of the Coromandel coast, from whose orange-yellow berries, the “crow’s eyes,” was extracted the most dynamic alkaloid of all, called strychnine. Keeping his voice at a low whisper, while lines creased his raised brow, he described the ash-gray branches, the garishly shiny leaves, and the yellow-green blossoms of this tree, so that as young Hans Castorp pictured it in his mind’s eye, the image was both dismal and hysterically garish, leaving him with a rather eerie feeling."

God and evil, the holy and the criminal all jumbled together. No judgment, no will, no capacity to reject what was vile. He wondered if Herr Naphta knew just what he was repudiating—and with young people listening—by jumbling up God and the Devil and denying the ethical principle in the name of his depraved Holy Duality. He was repudiating—it made him sick to say it—values, every standard of value. Fine—good and evil did not exist, only a morally chaotic void. The individual, in all the dignity of his critical faculties, did not exist, just an all-devouring, all-leveling community, and a mystical submersion in it. The individual—"

"Was ist die Zeit? Ein Geheimnis, – wesenlos und allmächtig. Eine Bedingung der Erscheinungswelt, eine Bewegung, verkoppelt und vermengt dem Dasein der Körper im Raum und ihrer Bewegung. Wäre aber keine Zeit, wenn keine Bewegung wäre? Keine Bewegung, wenn keine Zeit? Frage nur! Ist die Zeit eine Funktion des Raumes? Oder umgekehrt? Oder sind beide identisch? Nur zu gefragt! Die Zeit ist tätig, sie hat verbale Beschaffenheit, sie »zeitigt«. Was zeitigt sie denn? Veränderung! Jetzt ist nicht damals, hier nicht dort, denn zwischen beiden liegt Bewegung. Da aber die Bewegung, an der man die Zeit mißt, kreisläufig ist, in sich selber beschlossen, so ist das eine Bewegung und Veränderung, die man fast ebensogut als Ruhe und Stillstand bezeichnen könnte; denn das Damals wiederholt sich beständig im Jetzt, das Dort im Hier. Da ferner eine endliche Zeit und ein begrenzter Raum auch mit der verzweifeltsten Anstrengung nicht vorgestellt werden können, so hat man sich entschlossen, Zeit und Raum als ewig und unendlich zu »denken«, – in der Meinung offenbar, dies gelinge, wenn nicht recht gut, so doch etwas besser. Bedeutet aber nicht die Statuierung des Ewigen und Unendlichen die logisch-rechnerische Vernichtung alles Begrenzten und Endlichen, seine verhältnismäßige Reduzierung auf null? Ist im Ewigen ein Nacheinander möglich, im Unendlichen ein Nebeneinander? Wie vertragen sich mit den Notannahmen des Ewigen und Unendlichen Begriffe wie Entfernung, Bewegung, Veränderung, auch nur das Vorhandensein begrenzter Körper im All? Das frage du nur immerhin!","What time is it? A secret, - insubstantial and omnipotent. A condition of the phenomenal world, a movement, couples and blends the existence of bodies in space and their movement. But would there be no time if there were no movement? No movement when no time? Just asking! Is time a function of space? Or the other way around? Or are both identical? Just ask! Time is active, it has a verbal quality, it ""times"". What is she saying? Change! Now is not then, here is not there, because there is movement between the two. But since the movement by which time is measured is circular and self-contained, this is a movement and change that could almost as well be described as rest and standstill; because what was then is repeated constantly in the now, there in the here. Furthermore, since a finite time and a limited space cannot be imagined even with the most desperate effort, people have decided to ""think"" time and space as eternal and infinite - evidently thinking that this works, if not quite well , so something better. But doesn't the statute of the eternal and the infinite mean the logical and mathematical annihilation of everything limited and finite, its relative reduction to zero? Is a succession possible in the eternal, a juxtaposition in the infinite? How do concepts like distance, movement, change, even the existence of limited bodies in space, get along with the emergency assumptions of the eternal and the infinite? That's just what you're asking!","WHAT is time? A mystery, a figment—and all-powerful. It conditions the exterior world, it is motion married to and mingled with the existence of bodies in space, and with the motion of these. Would there then be no time if there were no motion? No motion if no time? We fondly ask. Is time a function of Space? Or space of time? Or are they identical? Echo answers. Time is functional, it can be referred to as action; we say a thing’s “brought about” by time. What sort of thing? Change! Now is not then, here not there, for between them lies motion. But the motion by which one measures time is circular, is in a closed circle; and might almost equally well be described as rest, as cessation of movement—for the there repeats itself constantly in the here, the past in the present. Furthermore, as our utmost effort cannot conceive a final limit either to time or in space, we have settled to think of them as eternal and infinite—apparently in the hope that if this is not very successful, at least it will be more so than the other. But is not this affirmation of the eternal and the infinite the logical-mathematical destruction of every and any limit in time or space, and the reduction of them, more or less, to zero? Is it possible, in eternity, to conceive of a sequence of events, or in the infinite of a succession of space-occupying bodies? Conceptions of distance, movement, change, even of the existence of finite bodies in the universe—how do these fare? Are they consistent with the hypothesis of eternity and infinity we have been driven to adopt? Again we ask, and again echo answers.","What is time? A secret—insubstantial and omnipotent. A prerequisite of the external world, a motion intermingled and fused with bodies existing and moving in space. But would there be no time, if there were no motion? No motion, if there were no time? What a question! Is time a function of space? Or vice versa? Or are the two identical? An even bigger question! Time is active, by nature it is much like a verb, it both “ripens” and “brings forth.” And what does it bring forth? Change! Now is not then, here is not there—for in both cases motion lies in between. But since we measure time by a circular motion closed in on itself, we could just as easily say that its motion and change are rest and stagnation—for the then is constantly repeated in the now, the there in the here. Moreover, since, despite our best desperate attempts, we cannot imagine an end to time or a finite border around space, we have decided to “think” of them as eternal and infinite—in the apparent belief that even if we are not totally successful, this marks some improvement. But does not the very positing of eternity and infinity imply the logical, mathematical negation of things limited and finite, their relative reduction to zero? Is a sequence of events possible in eternity, a juxtaposition of objects in infinity? How does our makeshift assumption of eternity and infinity square with concepts like distance, motion, change, or even the very existence of a finite body in space? Now there’s a real question for you!"
"»Bitte, bitte«, antwortete Joachim wieder, und wahrschein{332}lich lächelte er ergeben dort oben im Dunklen. Aber der Hofrat gebot ihnen, zu schweigen und keine Empfindsamkeiten zu tauschen. Er studierte die Flecke und Linien, das schwarze Gekräusel im inneren Brustraum, während auch sein Mitspäher nicht müde wurde, Joachims Grabesgestalt und Totenbein zu betrachten, dies kahle Gerüst und spindeldürre Memento. Andacht und Schrecken erfüllten ihn. »Jawohl, jawohl, ich sehe«, sagte er mehrmals. »Mein Gott, ich sehe!« Er hatte von einer Frau gehört, einer längst verstorbenen Verwandten von Tienappelscher Seite, – sie sollte mit einer schweren Gabe ausgestattet oder geschlagen gewesen sein, die sie in Demut getragen, und die darin bestanden hatte, daß Leute, die baldigst sterben sollten, ihren Augen als Gerippe erschienen waren. So sah nun Hans Castorp den guten Joachim, wenn auch mit Hilfe und auf Veranstaltung der physikalisch-optischen Wissenschaft, so daß es nichts zu bedeuten hatte und alles mit rechten Dingen zuging, zumal er Joachims Zustimmung ausdrücklich eingezogen. Dennoch wandelte Verständnis ihn an für die Melancholie im Schicksal jener seherischen Tante. Heftig bewegt von dem, was er sah, oder eigentlich davon, daß er es sah, fühlte er sein Gemüt von geheimen Zweifeln gestachelt, ob es rechte Dinge seien, mit denen dies zugehe, Zweifeln an der Erlaubtheit seines Schauens im schütternden, knisternden Dunkel; und die zerrende Lust der Indiskretion mischte sich in seiner Brust mit Gefühlen der Rührung und Frömmigkeit.","""Please, please,"" Joachim answered again, and he was probably smiling submissively up there in the dark. But the privy councilor ordered them to be silent and not to exchange sensibilities. He studied the spots and lines, the black ripples in the inner chest, while his fellow scout never tired of looking at Joachim's grave and death's bones, this bare scaffolding and spindly memento. Reverence and terror filled him. ""Yes, yes, I see,"" he said several times. ""My God, I see!"" He had heard of a woman, a long-dead relative of Tienappel's side, - she was said to have been endowed or beaten with a great gift, which she humbly borne, and which consisted in the fact that people , who were about to die, had appeared to their eyes as skeletons. This is how Hans Castorp now saw the good Joachim, albeit with the help and at the direction of physical-optical science, so that it didn't mean anything and everything went right, especially since he expressly withdrew Joachim's consent. Nevertheless, he came to understand the melancholy in the fate of that visionary aunt. Violently moved by what he saw, or actually by the fact that he saw it, he felt his mind goaded by secret doubts as to whether things were right with which this was going, doubts as to the legitimacy of his vision in the shaking, crackling darkness; and the tugging lust of indiscretion mingled in his breast with feelings of emotion and piety.","“Go ahead,” answered Joachim again; probably he smiled politely up there in the darkness. But the Hofrat told him to be quiet and not betray any sensibility. Behrens studied the spots and the lines, the black festoon in the intercostal space; while Hans Castorp gazed without wearying at Joachim’s graveyard shape and bony tenement, this lean memento mori, this scaffolding for mortal flesh to hang on. “Yes, yes! I see, I see!” he said, several times over. “My God, I see!” He had heard of a woman, a longdead member of the Tienappel connexion, who had been endowed or afflicted with a heavy gift, which she bore in all humility: namely, that the skeletons of persons about to die would appear before her. Thus now Hans Castorp was privileged to behold the good Joachim—but with the aid and under the auspices of physical science; and by his cousin’s express permission, so that it was quite legitimate and without gruesome significance. Yet a certain sympathy came over him with the melancholy destiny of his clairvoyant relative. He was strongly moved by what he saw—or more precisely, by the fact that he saw it—and felt stirrings of uneasy doubt, as to whether it was really permissible and innocent to stand here in the quaking, crackling darkness and gaze like this; his itch to commit the indiscretion conflicted in his bosom with religious emotion and feelings of concern.","“Please, go ahead and look,” Joachim replied again, and he was probably even smiling meekly up there in the dark. But the director ordered him to be silent and not to exchange sentimentalities. He studied the spots and lines, the blackish ruffles in the chest cavity, while his fellow viewer gazed tirelessly at Joachim’s sepulchral form, his dry bones, his bare scaffolding, his gaunt memento mori. He was filled with both reverence and terror. “Yes, yes, I see it,” he said several times. “My God, I see it!” He had once heard about a woman, a long-dead forebear on the Tienappel side of the family, who was said to have been endowed or cursed with a troublesome talent that she had borne in all humility and that had caused her to see anyone who would soon die as just a skeleton. Which was exactly how good Joachim now looked to Hans Castorp, although with the aid and under the auspices of physical optics—so that it did not really mean anything and was perfectly normal, particularly since he had expressly obtained Joachim’s permission. And yet he felt some sympathy for the melancholy fate of his clairvoyant great-aunt. He was deeply moved by what he saw, or more accurately, by being able to see it, but he was also stung by secret doubts whether it might not be somehow abnormal after all, doubts about whether it was permissible to stare like this amid the quivering, crackling darkness. A deep desire to enjoy the indiscretion blended with feelings of compassion and piety."

"»Wahrhaftig?« rief Settembrini … »Vorzüglich!« rief er nach oben in die Luft hinein, indem er sich lachend zurückneigte. »Wie heißt es doch in der Oper Ihres Meisters? ›Der Vogelfänger bin ich ja, stets lustig, heisa, hopsassa!‹ Kurz, das ist sehr amüsant. Sie werden seinen Rat befolgen? Zweifelsohne. Wie sollten Sie nicht. Ein Satanskerl, dieser Radamanth! Und wirklich ›stets lustig‹, wenn auch zuweilen ein wenig gezwungen. Er neigt zur Schwermut. Sein Laster bekommt ihm nicht – sonst wäre es übrigens kein Laster –, der Rauchtabak macht ihn schwermütig, – weshalb unsere verehrungswürdige Frau Oberin die Vorräte in Verwahrung genommen hat und ihm nur kleine Tagesrationen zuteilt.

""Excellent!"" he shouted up into the air, leaning back and laughing. 'What's it called in your master's opera? 'I'm the bird catcher, always funny, heisa, hopsassa!' In short, that's very amusing. Will you take his advice? Without a doubt. How shouldn't you. A bastard, that Radamanth! And really 'always funny', if a little forced at times. He tends to be melancholy. His vice doesn't suit him - otherwise it wouldn't be a vice, by the way - the smoking tobacco makes him melancholy - which is why our venerable madam superior has taken care of the provisions and only gives him small daily rations. It is said that he succumbs to the temptation to steal from her, and then he succumbs to melancholy. In a word: a confused soul. Do you already know our superior? Not? But this is a mistake! You are wrong not to solicit her acquaintance. Of the family of Mylendonk, sir! She differs from the Medicean Venus in that where the bosom of the goddess is, she wears a cross...""","“Did he indeed?” Settembrini cried out. “Capital!” He laughed and threw back his head. “How does it go, that opera of yours? ‘ A fowler bold in me you see, forever laughing merrily!’ Ah, that is most amusing! And you will follow his advice? Of course, why shouldn’t you? He’s a devil of a fellow, our Rhadamanthus! ‘ Forever laughing’—even if it is rather forced at times. He is inclined to melancholia, you know. His vice doesn’t agree with him—of course, else it would be no vice. Smoking gives him fits of depression; that is why our respected Frau Directress has taken charge of his supplies, and only deals him out daily rations. It even happens sometimes that he yields to the temptation to steal it, and then he gets an attack of melancholia. A troubled spirit, in short. Do you know your Directress already, too? No? You have made a mistake. You must remedy it at the earliest opportunity. My dear sir, she comes of the noble race of von Mylendonk. And she is distinguished from the Medici Venus by the fact that where the goddess has a bosom, she has a cross.”","“Is that right?” Settembrini exclaimed. “Excellent!” he cried into the air above him, throwing his head back and laughing. “How does that go in the opera of your greatest composer? ‘I am the man who catches birds, am always merry, mark my words!’ In short, that’s very amusing. And you wish to follow his advice, do you? Indubitably. Why shouldn’t you? A devil of a fellow, our Rhadamanthus. And truly ‘always merry’—though at times it’s a little forced. He tends to melancholy. His vice is not good for him—but otherwise, it would be no vice—tobacco only makes him melancholy. Which is why our venerable head nurse has taken charge of his supply and allows him only a small daily ration. It has been said that on occasion he succumbs to the temptation of stealing them, and then slips into melancholy. In a word, a confused soul. You do know our head nurse, do you not? No? But that is a mistake—you are in error not to seek out her acquaintance. From the house of the von Mylendonks, sir! She differs from the Medici Venus only in that where the goddess has a bosom, she wears a cross.”"
"Das Gehölz, das ihn angezogen hatte, lag jenseits der Schlucht, in die er unversehens hineingefahren. Ihr mit lokkerem Schnee bedeckter Grund senkte sich nach der Seite des Gebirges hin, wie er bemerkte, als er ihn ein Stück in dieser Richtung verfolgte. Es ging abwärts; die Seitenschrägen erhöhten sich; wie ein Hohlweg schien die Falte in den Berg hineinzuführen. Dann standen die Schnäbel seines Fahrzeugs wieder aufwärts; der Boden hob sich, es gab bald keine Seitenwand mehr zu ersteigen; Hans Castorps weglose Fahrt ging wieder auf offener Berghalde gegen den Himmel.","The wood that had attracted him lay beyond the ravine into which he unexpectedly drove.

It went down; the side slopes increased; the fold seemed to lead into the mountain like a ravine. Then his vehicle's beaks stood up again; the ground rose, soon there was no side wall to climb; Hans Castorp's pathless journey went back to the open mountain heap against the sky.","The grove that had attracted him lay the other side of the gully into which he had unintentionally steered. The trough, covered with fluffy snow, fell away on the side next the mountains, as he observed when he pursued it a little distance. It went downhill , the steep sides grew higher, this fold of the earth’s surface seemed like a narrow passage leading into the mountain. Then the points of his skis turned up again, there began an incline, soon there were no more side walls; Hans Castorp’s trackless course ran once more uphill along the mountain-side.","The woods that had attracted him lay beyond the trough into which he had unintentionally descended. The slope was covered with loose powder, and after following it a little distance, he realized that it fell away to one side, toward the mountain. He was heading down the trough now, its walls rising on both sides—it seemed to be a fold, a narrow pass leading into the mountain itself. And then the tips of his skis were pointing upward again; the ground rose, there were no more side walls to climb; Hans Castorp’s uncharted route led him upward again, across the open face of the mountain."
"Hans Castorp, geschmeichelt von so viel Neckerei, glaubte bescheiden ablehnen zu müssen. »Nein, nein,« sagte er, »Sie irren sich, mein Fall ist der denkbar harmloseste, ich habe Schnupfen, Sie sehen: die Augen gehen mir über, meine Brust ist verstockt, ich huste die halbe Nacht, es ist unangenehm genug …« Aber sie nahmen seine Entschuldigungen nicht an, sie lachten und winkten ihm mit den Händen ab, rufend: »Ja, ja, ja, Flausen, Ausreden, Schnupfenfieber, kennen wir, kennen wir!« Und dann forderten sie alle auf einmal, daß Hans Castorp sich unverzüglich zur Untersuchung melde. Sie waren belebt von der Nachricht; unter den sieben Tischen war an diesem während des Frühstücks die Unterhaltung am muntersten. Frau Stöhr insbesondere, hochroten, störrischen Gesichts über ihrer Halsrüsche und kleine Sprünge in der Wangenhaut, legte eine fast wilde Gesprächigkeit an den Tag und erging sich über {264}die Vergnüglichkeit des Hustens, – ja, es habe unbedingt eine unterhaltliche und genußreiche Bewandtnis damit, wenn in den Gründen der Brust der Kitzel sich mehre und wachse und man mit Krampf und Pressung so recht tief hinunterlange, um dem Reiz zu genügen: ein ähnlicher Spaß sei das wie das Niesen, wenn die Lust dazu gewaltig anschwelle und unwiderstehlich werde und man mit berauschter Miene ein paarmal stürmisch aus- und einatme, sich wonnig ergäbe und über dem gesegneten Ausbruch die ganze Welt vergäße. Und manchmal komme es zwei-, dreimal hintereinander. Das seien kostenfreie Genüsse des Lebens, wie beispielsweise auch noch, sich im Frühling die Frostbeulen zu kratzen, wenn sie so süßlich juckten, – sich so recht innig und grausam zu kratzen bis aufs Blut in Wut und Vergnügen, und wenn man zufällig in den Spiegel sähe dabei, dann sähe man eine Teufelsfratze.","Hans Castorp, flattered by so much teasing, felt he had to modestly decline. ""No, no,"" he said, ""you're wrong, my case is the most harmless imaginable, I have a cold, you see: my eyes are going over, my chest is hard, I cough half the night, it's unpleasant enough... ' But they didn't accept his excuses, they laughed and waved their hands at him, shouting: 'Yes, yes, yes, nonsense, excuses, cold fever, we know, we know!' And then all at once they demanded that Hans Castorp reported immediately for investigation. They were animated by the news; Of the seven tables, conversation at breakfast was liveliest at this one. Frau Stöhr in particular, with a crimson, stubborn face above her ruffle and small cracks in the skin of her cheeks, showed an almost wild talkativeness and indulged in the pleasure of coughing - yes, it was definitely an entertaining and enjoyable thing to do with it , when the tickle increases and grows in the bottom of the breast and one reaches down really deep with spasms and pressure in order to satisfy the stimulus: it is similar fun to sneezing, when the desire to do so rises enormously and becomes irresistible and one exhale and inhale stormily a few times with an intoxicated expression, surrender blissfully and forget the whole world over the blessed outburst. And sometimes it comes two or three times in a row. These are free pleasures of life, such as scratching one's chilblains in spring when they itch so sweetly - scratching oneself really heartily and cruelly to the point of blood in anger and pleasure, and if one happens to look in the mirror look at it, then you would see a devil's grimace.","It flattered Hans Castorp’s vanity to be taken so much notice of; but he felt that modesty required him to disclaim their attentions. “No, no,” he said. “You are all mistaken, my fever is the most harmless thing in the world; I simply have a cold, my eyes run, and my chest is stopped up. I have coughed half the night; it is thoroughly unpleasant of course. ”—But they would not listen; they laughed and flapped their hands at him. “Yes, of course, we know all about it—we know these colds; they are all gammon—you can’t fool us!” and with one accord they challenged Hans Castorp to an examination on the spot. The news excited them. Throughout the meal their table was the liveliest among the seven. Frau Stöhr became almost hysterical. Her peevish face looked scarlet above her neck-ruche, and tiny purple veins showed in the cheeks. She began to talk about how fascinating it was to cough. It was a solid satisfaction, when you felt a tickling come in your chest, deep down, and grow and grow, to reach down after it, and get at it, so to say. Sneezing was much the same thing. You kept on wanting to sneeze until you simply couldn’t stand it any longer; you looked as if you were tipsy; you drew a couple of breaths; then out it came, and you forgot everything else in the bliss of the sensation. Sometimes the explosion repeated itself two or three times. That was the sort of pleasure life gave you free of charge. Another one was the joy of scratching your chilblains in the spring, when they itched so gorgeously; you took a furious pleasure in scratching till the blood came; and if you happened to look in the glass you would be astonished to see the ghastly face you made.","Hans Castorp, flattered by so much teasing, felt that modesty required him to demur. “No, no,” he said, “you’re mistaken, my case is the most harmless imaginable. I have the sniffles. As you can see: my eyes are watery, my chest is congested, I coughed half the night away—that’s quite unpleasant enough.” But they would not accept his explanations. They laughed, they waved this off, they cried: “Yes, yes, yes. No fibbing, no excuses, we know all about sniffles and fever, know all about it.” And then all of a sudden they demanded that Hans Castorp immediately make an appointment to be examined. His news had animated them; the conversation at their breakfast table was livelier than at any of the other six. Frau Stöhr in particular became wildly talkative, and her willful face, its cheeks lined with tiny wrinkles, turned scarlet above her ruffled collar. She expatiated on the pleasures of coughing—yes, there was something perfectly delightful and enjoyable about a tickle in the depths of your chest, that got worse and worse until you reached down deep for it, squeezing and pressing to let it have its way. Sneezing was just as much fun— the way you felt it swelling up with a vengeance inside you, until it became irresistible and you breathed in and out in one great frenzy, gave yourself over to the bliss of it, your face drunk with pleasure—you could forget the whole world in one blessed eruption. But sometimes they came in twos and threes, one right after the other. Those were the pleasures in life that didn’t cost a cent—it was the same, for example, with scratching your chilblains in the spring, when they itched so deliciously—and you scratched away fervently and brutally until you drew blood, just for the mad pleasure of it. And if you happened to see yourself in the mirror, there was a little demon looking back at you."

"Aber sobald er eingeschlafen war, begann er zu träumen und träumte fast unaufhörlich bis zum anderen Morgen. Hauptsächlich sah er Joachim Ziemßen in sonderbar verrenkter Lage auf einem Bobschlitten eine schräge Bahn hinabfahren. Er war so phosphoreszierend bleich wie Dr. Krokowski, und vorneauf saß der Herrenreiter, der sehr unbestimmt aussah, wie jemand, den man lediglich hat husten hören, und lenkte. »Das ist uns doch ganz einerlei, – uns hier oben«, sagte der verrenkte Joachim, und dann war er es, nicht der Herrenreiter, der so grauenhaft breiig hustete. Darüber mußte Hans Castorp bitterlich weinen und sah ein, daß er in die Apotheke laufen müsse, um sich Cold-cream zu besorgen. Aber am Wege saß Frau Iltis mit einer spitzen Schnauze und hielt etwas in der Hand, was offenbar ihr »Sterilett« sein sollte, aber nichts weiter war als ein Sicherheits-Rasierapparat. Das machte Hans Castorp nun wieder lachen, und so wurde er zwischen verschiedenen Gemütsbewegungen hin und her geworfen, bis der Morgen durch seine halboffene Balkontür graute und ihn weckte.","But as soon as he fell asleep he began to dream and dreamed almost continuously until the next morning. The main thing he saw was Joachim Ziemssen in a strangely contorted position on a sled down a sloping track. He was as phosphorescently pale as Dr. Krokowski, and in front sat the Herrenreiter, who looked very vague, like someone you only heard coughing, and steered. ""It doesn't matter to us, - to us up here,"" said the contorted Joachim, and then it was he, not the Herrenreiter, who coughed so horribly mushy. Hans Castorp had to weep bitterly over this and realized that he had to run to the pharmacy to get cold cream. But by the way Frau Iltis was sitting with a pointed snout and holding something in her hand that was obviously supposed to be her ""sterilet"" but was nothing more than a safety razor. That made Hans Castorp laugh again, and so he was tossed back and forth between different emotions until morning broke through his half-open balcony door and woke him up.","No sooner had he gone off, however, than he began to dream, and dreamed almost without stopping until next morning. Principally he saw his cousin, Joachim Ziemssen, in a strange, dislocated attitude on a bob-sled, riding down a steep course. He had a phosphorescent pallor like Dr. Krokowski, and in front of him sat the gentleman rider and steered. The gentleman rider was indistinct, like someone one has heard cough, but never seen. “It’s all the same to us up here,” remarked the dislocated Joachim; and then it was he and not the gentleman rider who was coughing in that horribly pulpy manner. Hans Castorp wept bitterly to hear, and then perceived that he must run to the chemist’s to get some cold cream. But Frau Iltis, with a pointed snout, sat by the road-side with something in her hand, which must be her “steriletto,” but was obviously nothing else than a safety-razor. This made Hans Castorp go from tears to laughing; and thus he was tossed back and forth among varying emotions, until the dawn came through his half-open balcony door and wakened him.","But as soon as he was asleep, he began to dream and kept on dreaming almost nonstop until morning. Most of the time he saw Joachim Ziemssen, in a strangely contorted position, riding down a steep slope on a bobsled. He was as phosphorescently pale as Dr. Krokowski, and up front sat the Austrian horseman, steering, although the face was very vague, like that of someone you’ve only heard cough. “It really doesn’t matter to us—to us up here,” the contorted Joachim said, and now it was he, and not the horseman, who was coughing in that ghastly, slimy way. And this made Hans Castorp weep bitterly, and he realized that he would have to run to the pharmacist to get himself some cold cream. But Frau Iltis was sitting beside the road, a roguish pucker on her face, and she was holding something in her hand that was supposed to be her “stirletto,” but was really nothing more than a safety razor. That only made Hans Castorp laugh again, and so he was tossed back and forth by waves of emotion until the dawn came to the half-open balcony door and awakened him."
"»Na, Sie unbeteiligter Zuschauer Sie!« sagte Behrens. »Was machen Sie denn, finden wir Gnade vor Ihren prüfenden Blikken? Ehrt uns, ehrt uns. Ja, unsere Sommersaison, die hats in sich, die ist nicht von schlechten Eltern. Habe es mir auch was kosten lassen, um sie ein bißchen zu poussieren. Aber schade ist es doch, daß Sie den Winter nicht mitmachen wollen bei uns, – Sie wollen ja bloß acht Wochen bleiben, hab ich gehört? Ach, drei? Das ist aber eine Stippvisite, das lohnt ja das Ablegen gar nicht; na, wie Sie meinen. Aber schade ist es doch, daß Sie den Winter nicht mitmachen, denn was so die Hotevoleh ist,« sagte er mit scherzhaft unmöglicher Aussprache, »die internationale Hotevoleh da unten in Platz, die kommt doch nun mal erst im Winter, und die müßten Sie sehen, da täten Sie was für Ihre Bildung. Zum Kugeln, wenn die Kerls so Sprünge machen auf ihren Fußbrettern. Und dann die Damen, herrje, die Damen! Bunt wie die Paradiesvögel, sag ich Ihnen, und mächtig galant … Nun muß ich aber zu meinem Moribundus,« sagte er, »auf siebenundzwanzig hier. Finales Stadium, wissen Sie. Durch die Mitte ab. Fünf Dutzend Fiaskos Oxygen hat er gestern und heute noch ausgekneipt, der Schlemmer. Aber bis Mittag wird er wohl ad penates gehen. Na, lieber Reuter,« sagte er, indem er eintrat, »wie wäre es, wenn wir noch einer den Hals brächen …« Seine Worte verloren sich hinter der Tür, die er zuzog. Aber einen Augenblick hatte Hans Castorp im Hintergrunde des Zimmers auf dem Kissen das wächserne Profil eines {164}jungen Mannes mit dünnem Kinnbart gesehen, der langsam seine sehr großen Augäpfel zur Tür gerollt hatte.","""Well, you innocent bystander,"" said Behrens. 'What are you doing, do we find mercy in your scrutiny? Honor us, honor us. Yes, our summer season has it all, it's not from bad parents. I also paid a little to tease her a little. But it's a pity that you don't want to spend the winter with us - I hear you only want to stay eight weeks? Oh, three? But that's a flying visit, it's not worth taking off; whatever you think. But it's a pity you're not going through the winter, because whatever the hotevoleh is,"" he said with a jokingly impossible pronunciation, ""the international hotevoleh down there in Platz only comes in winter, and you ought to have it see, you would do something for your education. For balls, when the guys make jumps on their footboards. And then the ladies, goodness gracious, the ladies! As colorful as the birds of paradise, I tell you, and mighty gallant ... But now I have to go to my moribundus,"" he said, ""on twenty-seven here. Final stage, you know. Down the middle. Yesterday and today he pinched five dozen Oxygen fiascos, the gourmand. But he'll probably go ad penates by noon. Well, dear Reuter,"" he said as he entered, ""how about we break someone's neck..."" His words were lost behind the door, which he pulled shut. But for a moment Hans Castorp had seen on the pillow at the back of the room the waxy profile of a young man with a thin goatee who had slowly rolled his very large eyeballs towards the door.","“Well, and how are you, you disinterested spectator, you?” said Behrens. “Are we finding favour in your critical eye, what? Thanks so much. Yes, yes, our summer season, it’s not too bad , there’s something to be said for it. I’ve spent a little money myself to push it. But it’s a pity you won’t be here in the winter—you’re stopping only eight weeks, I hear? Ah, three? That’s nothing but a week-end!—won’t pay you to take off your hat. Oh well, just as you think. Only it is a pity you won’t be here for the winter; that’s when the nobs come,” he said comically, “the international nobs, down in the Platz; they don’t come except in winter—you ought to see them, if only for the sake of your education. Regular high-flyers. You ought to see the jumps they make with those skis of theirs. And then the ladies! O Lord, the ladies! Birds of paradise, I tell you, and regularly out for adventure. Well, I must go in here, to my moribundus, number twenty-seven. Last stage, you know—off centre. Five dozen fiascos of oxygen he’s had all together, yesterday and to-day, the soak! But he will be going to his own place by middle-day. Well, my dear Reuter,“ he was saying as he entered, “what do you say—shall we break the neck of another bottle?” The sound of his words died away as he closed the door. But Hans Castorp had had a moment’s glimpse into the background of the room, where on the pillow lay the waxen profile of a young man with a little chin beard, who slowly rolled his great eyeballs toward the open door.","“Well, my innocent bystander,” Behrens said, “what are you up to, have we found favor in your searching eyes? We are honored, we are honored. Yes, our summer season’s quite the thing, of very good parentage. It cost me a pretty penny to puff it a bit, too. But what a shame, really, that you don’t want to stay through the winter with us—want to spend a mere eight weeks, I’ve heard, correct? Oh, three? But that’s just dropping by, not even worth taking off your hat and coat. Well, just as you like. But it really is a shame that you’ll not be spending the winter, because the crème de la crème”—he made a joke of his outrageous pronunciation—“the international crème de la crème down in Platz doesn’t arrive until winter, and you really must see them, just for educational purposes. Split your sides, watching these lads leaping about on planks tied to their feet. And the ladies—Lord, Lord, the ladies! Regular birds of paradise, I tell you, and eminently amorous. Well, now I have to attend to my moribundus,” he said, “in room twenty-seven here. Last stage, you know. Exit up center. He’s downed five dozen fiascoes between yesterday and today, the guzzler. But he will probably be joining his ancestors by noon. Well, my dear Reuter,” he said, stepping into the room, “how would it be if we crack another bottle . . .” His words were lost behind the door as he closed it. But for a moment Hans Castorp could see across the room to a waxen profile against pillows, a young man with a sparse goatee, who slowly rolled his very large eyes toward the door."
"Am besten erging es ihnen, wenn geistige Lüfte wehen, wenn sie disputieren – die Aufmerksamkeit der Spazierenden an eine ihrer zugleich eleganten und leidenschaftlichen, ihrer akademischen und dabei in einem Tonfall, als handele es sich um brennendste Tages- und Lebensfragen, geführten Debatten fesseln konnten, deren Kosten sie fast allein bestritten, und für deren Dauer das anwesende »Format« gewissermaßen neutralisiert war, da es sie nur mit stirnfaltigem Erstaunen und undeutlich-spöttischen Abgerissenheiten begleiten konnte. Allein selbst unter diesen Umständen übte es seinen Druck, beschattete das Gespräch, so daß es an Glanz zu verlieren schien, entweste es auf irgendeine Weise, setzte ihm, allen fühlbar, wenn auch seinerseits sicherlich unbewußt, oder Gott weiß in welchem Grade bewußt, etwas entgegen, was keiner der beiden Sachen zugute kam und wodurch der Zwist in seiner entscheidenden Wichtigkeit verblaßte, ja ihm – wir nehmen Anstand, es zu sagen – der Stempel des Müßigen aufgedrückt wurde. Oder, anders versucht: die witzige Fehde auf Leben und Tod nahm heimlich, auf unterirdische und unbestimmte Weise, beständig Bezug auf das ihr zur Seite wandelnde Format und entnervte sich an diesem Magnetismus. Anders war dieser geheimnisvolle und für die Disputanten sehr ärgerliche Vorgang nicht zu kennzeichnen. Man kann nur sagen, daß es, wenn kein Pieter Peeperkorn gewesen wäre, zur Parteinahme weit strenger verpflichtet hätte, wie beispielsweise Leo Naphta das erz- und grundrevolutionäre Wesen der Kirche gegen die Lehrmeinung Herrn Settembrinis verteidigte, welcher in dieser geschichtlichen Macht einzig die Schutzherrin finsterer Beharrung und {888}Erhaltung erblicken und alle zur Umwälzung und Erneuerung bereite Lebens- und Zukunftsfreundlichkeit an die entgegengesetzten, einer ruhmreichen Epoche der Wiedergeburt antiker Bildung entstammenden Prinzipien der Aufhellung, der Wissenschaft und des Fortschritts gebunden wissen wollte und auf diesem Bekenntnis mit schönstem Wurf des Wortes und der Gebärde bestand. Da machte denn Naphta, kalt und scharf, sich anheischig, zu zeigen – und zeigte es auch fast bis zu blendender Unwidersprechlichkeit –, daß die Kirche als Verkörperung der religiös-asketischen Idee, im Innersten weit entfernt, Parteigängerin und Stütze dessen zu sein, was bestehen wolle, der weltlichen Bildung also, der staatlichen Rechtsordnungen, – vielmehr von jeher den radikalsten, den Umsturz mit Stumpf und Stiel auf ihre Fahne geschrieben habe; daß schlechthin alles, was sich bewahrenswert dünke und von den Matten, den Feigen, den Konservativen, den Bürgern zu bewahren versucht werde: Staat und Familie, weltliche Kunst und Wissenschaft – sich immer nur in bewußtem oder unbewußtem Widerspruch zur religiösen Idee gehalten habe, zur Kirche, deren eingeborene Tendenz und unverbrüchliches Ziel die Auflösung aller bestehenden weltlichen Ordnungen und die Neugestaltung der Gesellschaft nach dem Vorbilde des idealen, des kommunistischen Gottesstaates sei.","They fared best when intellectual breezes were blowing, when they were arguing – capturing the attention of those walking by one of their debates, elegant and passionate at the same time, academic and conducted in a tone of voice as if it were about the most burning questions of the day and life , the costs of which she borne almost alone, and for the duration of which the present ""format"" was neutralized to a certain extent, since it could only accompany her with frowning astonishment and indistinctly mocking abruptness. But even under these circumstances it exerted its pressure, shadowed the conversation so that it seemed to lose its brilliance, alienated it in some way, perceptibly, though surely unconsciously on its part, or God knows to what degree, smeared something on it against what neither of the two things benefited and whereby the quarrel faded in its decisive importance, yes it was - we hesitate to say it - the stamp of idleness was stamped on it. Or, to put it another way: the witty feud of life and death secretly, in a subterranean and indefinite way, constantly referred to the format walking alongside it and got unnerved by this magnetism. There was no other way of characterizing this mysterious process, which was very annoying for the debaters. One can only say that if Pieter Peeperkorn had not been there, it would have been far more strictly obliged to take sides, as for example Leo Naphta defended the arch-revolutionary nature of the Church against the doctrine of Mr. Settembrini, who in this historical power was the only patron of sinister perseverance and {888}preservation and wanted to see all friendliness of life and the future ready for revolution and renewal bound to the opposite principles of enlightenment, science and progress originating from a glorious epoch of the rebirth of ancient education and on this confession with the most beautiful throw of words and gestures. Then Naphta, cold and sharp, made it his duty to show - and showed it almost to the point of blinding inconsistency - that the church, as the embodiment of the religious-ascetic idea, is in its heart far removed from being a partisan and supporter of what wanted to exist, that is, the secular education, the state legal systems, - rather always the most radical, the overthrow root and branch have written on their flag; that absolutely everything that considers itself worth preserving and is being tried to preserve by the matts, the cowards, the conservatives, the bourgeoisie: state and family, secular art and science - has always only kept itself in conscious or unconscious contradiction to the religious idea, to the Church, whose innate tendency and unbreakable goal is the dissolution of all existing worldly orders and the reorganization of society according to the model of the ideal, the communist theocracy.","They were on safer ground when they could sustain the conversation in the realms of the intellectual, and hold the attention of their audience by one of their elegant and impassioned debates, academic, yet conducted as though the matter discussed were the most burning question of the time, or of all time. They were of course almost the sole support of such discussions; while these lasted; they did, to some extent, neutralize the effect of “bigness” purveyed by a certain member of their group, who could only accompany them by a running play of wrinkles, gestures, and snatches of mockery. But even that was enough to cast a shadow, rob their brilliant performance of some of its gloss, emasculate it, as it were, set up a cross-current perceptible to them all, though Peeperkorn himself remained unconscious, or conscious to a degree impossible for them to guess. Neither side could get any advantage, both were embarrassed, and the stamp of futility set upon their debate. We might put it like this: that their life-and-death duel of wits came to be carried on always with vague subterranean reference to “bigness” walking beside them, and to be deflected from its orbit by the magnetism “bigness” exerted. One cannot characterize otherwise this puzzling, for the two disputants maddening, posture of affairs. One can only add that had there been no Pieter Peeperkorn, party feeling would have run higher on both sides; as when Leo Naphta defended the arch-revolutionary nature of the Church, against Settembrini’s dogmatic assertion that that great historic power was to be looked upon merely as the protectress of the sinister forces of reaction; whereas all the forces that made for life and future, and looked undismayed on change and resolution, he claimed for the principles of enlightenment; science and progress, which had their rise in an epoch of quite opposed tendencies, the famous century that witnessed the rebirth of classical culture. He drove home his convictions with a graceful play of word and gesture. Whereupon Naphta, with chilling acuity, undertook to show—and showed too, with devastating clarity—that the Church, as the embodiment of the religious and ascetic ideal, was remote indeed from posing as the champion and support of the existing order, in other words of secular culture and civil law—rather had she from the beginning inscribed upon her radical banner the programme of their extirpation root and branch; that absolutely everything beloved and cherished of the bourgeoisie, the conservative, the cowardly, and the impotent—the State, family life, secular art and science—was consciously or unconsciously hostile to the religious idea, to the Church, whose innate tendency and permanent aim was the dissolution of all existing worldly orders, and the reconstitution of society after the model of the ideal, the communistic City of God.","The two of them did best when intellectual breezes blew, when they debated and could capture the attention of the strollers with one of their elegant, passionate, academic arguments (though the tone of voice implied that it was one of the most burning questions of the day, of life itself) the burden of which they more or less carried alone, thereby neutralizing for its duration the presence of the man of “stature,” who could offer only a brow creased in astonishment and some vague mocking scraps of commentary. But even under such circumstances, his weight was felt; he cast a shadow over the conversation, until it seemed to lose its brilliance, to forfeit its very substance somehow. His was a counterforce that they all could feel, but of which he was surely not even aware, or aware to God only knew what extent; but its weight was of no use to either argument, so that the issue itself seemed to pale, to lose its critical importance, indeed—though we hesitate to say it—to take on the stamp of frivolity. Or, to put it another way: their life-and-death duel of wits was constantly establishing some son of subterranean connection to this epitome of stature strolling beside them and was enervated by its magnetism. There is no other way to characterize this mysterious process, so very annoying to the debaters. One can only say that, had there not been a Pieter Peeperkorn, the others would have felt much more constrained to take sides, when, for example, Leo Naphta defended the fundamental, archrevolutionary nature of the Church against the teachings of Herr Settembrini, who asserted that her sole historical purpose had been to serve as the patron of the dark forces of inertia and reaction and then went on to claim that the affirmation of life and a future open to revolution and renewal was bound up with the opposing principles of enlightenment, science, and progress, which had arisen in the glorious epoch that witnessed the rebirth of classical education—and drove home this profession of faith with gestures and a burst of eloquence. Whereupon Naphta felt obliged to offer cold, caustic proof—and his proof was almost blindingly incontrovertible—that the Church was the embodiment of the religious, ascetic ideal, and at her core not even remotely an advocate or supporter of forces whose concern was to maintain themselves: worldly education and civil authority, for instance; rather, from time immemorial the Church had inscribed radical overthrow upon her banner—destruction, root and branch. Everything that presumed itself worth preserving and that the pallid, cowardly, conservative bourgeoisie attempted to preserve—state and family, worldly an and science—had always stood in conscious or unconscious opposition to the religious ideal, to the Church, whose innate tendency and unswerving goal was the dissolution of the existing world order and the remaking of society on the model of an ideal, communistic City of God."

And also your training in natural science is bound to link you to progressive ideas. You see, through the space of countless ages, life developing from infusorium up to man: how can you doubt, then, that man has yet before him endless possibilities of development? And in the sphere of the higher mathematics, if you would rest your case thereon, then follow your cycle from perfection to perfection, and, from the teaching of our eighteenth century, learn that man was originally good, happy, and without sin, that social errors have corrupted and perverted him, and that he can and will once more become good, happy, and sinless, by dint of labour upon his social structure—”","“You should not brood and dream, my good engineer,” Settembrini interrupted, “but steadfastly trust those instincts of your years and race that compel you to action. You also need to pair your scientific learning with the idea of progress. In the immeasurable expanses of time, you see how life moves onward and upward from infusoria to man, and you cannot deny that infinite possibilities for further perfection still await humankind. But if you are determined to stick with mathematics, it, too, will lead you in a spiral from perfection to perfection; and you can take solace in the precepts of our eighteenth century, which taught that man was originally good, happy, and perfect, that it is only through social errors that he has been perverted and ruined, and that by working critically to rebuild society he shall become good, happy, and perfect again.”"

"Mit Edhin Krokowskis Konferenzen hatte es im Laufe der Jährchen eine unerwartete Wendung genommen. Immer hatten seine Forschungen, die der Seelenzergliederung und dem menschlichen Traumleben galten, einen unterirdischen und katakombenhaften Charakter getragen; neuerdings aber, in gelindem, der Öffentlichkeit kaum merklichem Übergang, hatten sie die Richtung ins Magische, durchaus Geheimnisvolle eingeschlagen, und seine vierzehntägigen Vorträge im {991}Speisesaal, Hauptattraktion des Hauses, Stolz des Prospektes, – diese Vorträge, gehalten in Gehrock und Sandalen, hinter gedecktem Tischchen und mit exotisch schleppenden Akzenten vor dem unbeweglich lauschenden Berghofpublikum, sie handelten nicht mehr von verkappter Liebesbetätigung und Rückverwandlung der Krankheit in den bewußt gemachten Affekt, sie handelten von den profunden Seltsamkeiten des Hypnotismus und Somnambulismus, den Phänomenen der Telepathie, des Wahrtraums und des Zweiten Gesichtes, den Wundern der Hysterie, bei deren Erörterung der philosophische Horizont sich derart weitete, daß auf einmal solche Rätsel dem Auge der Zuhörer erschimmerten, wie das des Verhältnisses der Materie zum Psychischen, ja dasjenige des Lebens selbst, welchem beizukommen auf unheimlichstem, auf krankhaftem Wege, wie es scheinen mochte, mehr Hoffnung war, als auf dem der Gesundheit …","With Edhin Krokowski's conferences, things had taken an unexpected turn over the years. His research, which concerned the dissection of the soul and human dream life, had always had an underground and catacomb-like character; Recently, however, in a gentle transition that is hardly noticeable to the public, they had taken the direction of the magical, the thoroughly mysterious, and his fortnightly lectures in the {991} dining room, the main attraction of the house, the pride of the prospectus - these lectures, held in frock coat and sandals , behind a laid table and with exotically sluggish accents in front of the immobilely listening Berghof audience, they were no longer about disguised lovemaking and the reconversion of illness into conscious affect, they were about the profound oddities of hypnotism and somnambulism, the phenomena of telepathy, of real dreams and the second sight, the miracles of hysteria, during the discussion of which the philosophical horizon widened to such an extent that all at once such riddles shimmered before the eyes of the listeners as that of the relationship between matter and the psyche, yes, that of life itself, which to be overcome in the most uncanny way , on sick On the way, as it might seem, there was more hope than on the way of health...","EDHIN KROKOWSKI’S lectures had in the swift passage of the years taken an unexpected turn. His researches, which dealt with psycho-analysis and the dream-life of humanity, had always had a subterranean, not to say catacombish character; but now, by a transition so gradual that one scarcely marked it, they had passed over to the frankly supernatural, and his fortnightly lectures in the dining-room—the prime attraction of the house, the pride of the prospectus, delivered in a drawling, foreign voice, in frock-coat and sandals from behind a little covered table, to the rapt and motionless Berghof audience— these lectures no longer treated of the disguised activities of love and the retransformation of the illness into the conscious emotion. They had gone on to the extraordinary phenomena of hypnotism and somnambulism, telepathy, “dreaming true,” and second sight; the marvels of hysteria, the expounding of which widened the philosophic horizon to such an extent that suddenly before the listener’s eyes would glitter darkly puzzles like that of the relation of matter to the psychical, yes, even the puzzle of life itself, which, it appeared, was easier to approach by uncanny, even morbid paths than by the way of health.","Edhin Krokowski’s lectures had taken an unexpected turn after all these little years. His researches, dedicated to psychic dissection and the dream life of his patients, had always had a subterranean character, the whiff of the catacomb. Of late, however, although the transition had been so gradual his audience had scarcely noticed, his interests had moved in a new direction, toward magical, arcane matters; and his fortnightly lectures in the dining hall—the sanatorium’s main attraction, the pride of its brochure—which were always delivered from behind a cloth-covered table in an exotic, drawling accent, to an immobile audience of Berghof residents and for which he always wore a frock coat and sandals, no longer dealt with masked forms of love in action or the transformation of illness back into conscious emotion, but with the abstruse oddities of hypnotism and somnambulism, the phenomena of telepathy, prophetic dreams, and second sight, the wonders of hysteria; and as he discussed these topics, philosophic horizons expanded until suddenly his audience beheld great riddles shimmering before their eyes, riddles about the relationship between matter and the psyche, indeed, the very riddle of life itself, which, so it appeared, might be more easily approached along very uncanny paths, the paths of illness, than by the direct road of health."
"»Ja, – wenn Sie wollen. Die triviale Freigeisterei hatte Gründe dafür. Es war die Zeit, wo unsere Väter den Bund mit katholisch-hierarchischem Leben zu erfüllen suchten, und wo zu Clermont in Frankreich eine jesuitische Freimaurerloge blüh{768}te. Es war ferner die Zeit, wo das Rosenkreuzertum in die Logen eindrang, – eine sehr merkwürdige Brüderschaft, von der Sie sich merken dürfen, daß sie rein rationale politisch-gesellschaftliche Verbesserungs- und Beglückungsziele mit eigentümlichen Beziehungen zum Geheimwissen des Ostens, zu indischer und arabischer Weisheit und magischer Naturerkenntnis verband. Damals vollzog sich die Reform und Berichtigung vieler Freimaurerlogen im Sinne der strikten Observanz, – einem ausgesprochen irrationalen und geheimnisvollen, magisch-alchimistischen Sinn, dem die schottischen Hochgrade des Maurertums ihr Dasein verdanken, – Ordensrittergrade, die man der alten militärischen Rangstufenordnung von Lehrling, Geselle und Meister hinzufügte, Großmeistergrade, die ins Hieratische führten und von rosenkreuzerischem Geheimwissen erfüllt waren. Es handelt sich da um ein Zurückgreifen auf gewisse geistliche Ritterorden des Mittelalters, die Templer insbesondere, Sie wissen, die vor dem Patriarchen von Jerusalem das Gelübde der Armut, der Keuschheit und des Gehorsams ablegten. Noch heute führt ein Hochgrad der Freimaurerhierarchie den Titel ›Großfürst von Jerusalem‹.«","'Yes - if you like. The trivial freethinking had reasons for it. It was the time when our fathers sought to fill the league with Catholic hierarchical life, and when a Jesuit Masonic lodge flourished at Clermont in France. It was also the time when Rosicrucianism made its way into the lodges - a very strange brotherhood, of which you may note that they pursue purely rational political and social goals of improvement and happiness with peculiar connections to the secret knowledge of the East, to Indian and Arabic combined wisdom and magical knowledge of nature. At that time the reform and correction of many Masonic lodges took place in the sense of strict observance - a decidedly irrational and mysterious, magical-alchemical sense to which the Scottish higher degrees of Masonry owe their existence - knightly degrees, which are based on the old military rank system of apprentice, journeyman and added masters, grandmaster degrees that led to the hieratic and were filled with Rosicrucian secret knowledge. It is a question of going back to certain spiritual knightly orders of the Middle Ages, in particular the Templars, as you know, who took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience before the Patriarch of Jerusalem. Even today, a high degree in the Masonic hierarchy bears the title 'Grand Prince of Jerusalem'.""","“Yes—if you choose to call it that. The shallow free-thinking of the day was of that opinion. It was the period when the Fathers of our faith sought to animate the society by breathing into it Catholic-hierarchical ideas—at that time there was actually a Jesuit lodge of Freemasonry at Clermont, in France. And it was the time when Rosicrucianism made its entrance into the lodges, that remarkable brotherhood, which, you will note, was a peculiar union of purely rational ideas of political and social improvement and a millennial programme, with elements distinctly oriental, Indian and Arabic philosophy and magical nature-lore. The reform and revision of the lodges which then took place was in the direction of strict observance in a definitely irrational and mystical, magical-alchemical sense, to which the Scottish Rite owes its existence. These are degrees of knighthood which were added to the old military ranks of apprentice, journeyman, and master; upper ranks which issued in the hieratical, and were full of Rosicrucian mysticism. There ensued a sort of castingback to certain spiritual and knightly orders which existed in the Middle Ages, for instance the Templars, you know, who took the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience before the Patriarch of Jerusalem. Even to-day there is an upper degree in Freemasonry which bears the title ‘Grand Duke of Jerusalem.’ ”","“Yes—if you like. Banal freethinkers would have had reason to think so. It was a time when our own priests wanted to breathe the spirit of Catholic hierarchy into Freemasonry, and there was even a flourishing Jesuit lodge at Clermont, in France. It was, moreover, the period when Rosicrucianism infiltrated the lodges—a very strange brotherhood, which, you should note, united the purely rational, sociopolitical goals of improving the world and making people happy with a curious affinity for the occult sciences of the East, for Indian and Arabic wisdom and magical knowledge of nature. At the time, many lodges went through a period of rectification and reform, in the spirit of the ‘strict charges’—an explicitly irrational, mysterious, magical, alchemistic spirit, to which the higher degrees of the Scottish Rite owe their existence. Building on the old military ranks of apprentice, fellow, and master, new degrees called grand masters were added, leading to hieratic realms filled with Rosicrucian occultism. It was a matter of reaching back to certain religious orders of knights in the Middle Ages, to the Knights Templar in particular—you know, the ones who swore vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience before the patriarch of Jerusalem. Even today, one high degree of Masonry bears the title of ‘Grand Duke of Jerusalem.’ ”"
"»Wir unsererseits,« sprach Naphta, »vielleicht nicht weniger revolutionär als Sie, haben daraus von jeher in erster Linie den Vorrang der Kirche vor dem weltlichen Staat gefolgert. Denn wenn die Ungöttlichkeit des Staates ihm nicht an der Stirn geschrieben stände, würde ein Hinweis auf eben dieses historische Faktum, daß er auf den Willen des Volkes und nicht, wie die Kirche, auf göttliche Stiftung zurückzuführen ist, genügen, um ihn, wenn nicht geradezu als eine Veranstaltung der Bosheit, so doch jedenfalls als eine solche der Notdurft und der sündhaften Unzulänglichkeit zu erweisen.«","'For our part,' said Naphta, 'perhaps no less revolutionary than you, we have always inferred from this primarily the primacy of the church over the secular state. For if the ungodliness of the state were not written on its forehead, a reference to precisely this historical fact, that it can be traced back to the will of the people and not, like the church, to a divine foundation, would suffice to explain it, if not downright as an event of wickedness, but in any case as an event of necessity and sinful inadequacy.”","“We, for our part,” Naphta was saying, “perhaps no less revolutionary than you, have consistently deduced the supremacy of the Church over the secular power. The temporal nature of the power of the State is, as it were, written on its forehead; but even if it were not, it would be enough to point to the historical fact that its authority goes back to the will of the people, whereas that of the Church rests upon the divine sanction, to establish its character as a device which, if not precisely contrived by the power of evil, is nevertheless a faulty and inadequate makeshift.”","“—we, for our part,” Naphta continued, “are perhaps no less revolutionary than you, but we have always deduced, first and foremost, the supremacy of the Church over the secular state. For even if the state’s ungodliness were not branded on its brow, one need only note a simple historical fact—that its origins can be traced to the will of the people and not, like those of the Church, to divine decree—and thereby prove that the state is, if not exactly a manifestation of evil, then at least a manifestation of dire necessity and sinful shortcomings.”"

"Wirklich war Elia Naphta ein Grübler und Sinnierer gewesen, ein Erforscher der Thora nicht nur, sondern auch ein Kritiker der Schrift, der mit dem Rabbiner über ihre Sätze disputierte und nicht selten in Streit mit ihm geriet. In der Gegend, und zwar nicht nur bei seinen Glaubensgenossen, hatte er für etwas Besonderes gegolten, für einen, der mehr wußte, als andere – frommerweise zum Teil, zum anderen aber auch auf eine Art, die nicht ganz geheuer sein mochte und jedenfalls nicht in der gewöhnlichen Ordnung war. Etwas sektiererisch Unregelmäßiges haftete ihm an, etwas von einem Gottesvertrauten, Baal-Schem oder Zaddik, das ist Wundermann, zumal er in der Tat einmal ein Weib von bösem Ausschlage, ein an{665}dermal einen Knaben von Krämpfen geheilt hatte und zwar mit Blut und Sprüchen. Aber eben dieser Nimbus einer irgendwie gewagten Frömmigkeit, bei welchem der Blutgeruch seines Gewerbes eine Rolle spielte, war sein Verderben geworden. Denn bei Gelegenheit einer Volksbewegung und Wutpanik, hervorgerufen durch den unaufgeklärten Tod zweier Christenkinder, war Elia auf schreckliche Weise ums Leben gekommen: mit Nägeln gekreuzigt, hatte man ihn an der Tür seines brennenden Hauses hängend gefunden, worauf sein Weib, obgleich schwindsüchtig und bettlägerig, mit ihren Kindern, dem Knaben Leib und seinen vier Geschwistern, sämtlich mit erhobenen Armen schreiend und wehklagend, landflüchtig geworden war.","In fact, Elijah Naphta had been a brooder and ponderer, not only a student of the Torah but also a critic of the Scriptures, who disputed their propositions with the rabbi and often got into arguments with him. Locally, and not just among his co-religionists, he had been thought of as something special, someone who knew more than others - piously in part, but also in a way that might not have been entirely eminent, and certainly not was in the ordinary order. Something irregular in the sect clung to him, something of a confidant of God, Baal-Shem or Zaddik, that is a miracle worker, especially since he had indeed once healed a woman from a nasty rash, and once healed a boy from cramps, and that with blood and sayings. But just this nimbus of a somehow daring piety, in which the bloody smell of his trade played a part, had become his undoing. Because on the occasion of a popular movement and panic, caused by the unexplained death of two Christian children, Elijah died in a terrible way: crucified with nails, he was found hanging on the door of his burning house, whereupon his wife, although consumptive and bedridden, had fled the country with her children, the boy Leib and his four siblings, all of them screaming and wailing with raised arms.","Yes, Elie Naphta had been a brooding and refining spirit; a student of the Torah, but a critic as well, discussing the Scriptures with his rabbi—with whom he not infrequently disagreed. In his village, and not only among those of his own creed, he had passed for something unusual, for a man of more than common knowledge— knowledge for the most part of holy things, but possibly also of matters that might not be quite canny, and anyhow were not in the ordinary run. There was something irregular, schismatic, about him, something of the familiar of God, a Baal-Shem or Zaddik, a miracle-man. Once he had actually cured a woman of a malignant sore, and another time a boy of spasms, simply by means of blood and invocations. But it was precisely this aura of an uncanny piety, in which the odour of his blood-boltered calling played a part, that proved his destruction. There had been the unexplained death of two gentile boys, a popular uprising, a panic of rage—and Elie had died horribly, nailed crucifix-wise on the door of his burning home. His tuberculous, bedridden wife, the boy Leo, and four brothers and sisters, all wailing and lamenting with upflung arms, had fled the country.","Elia Naphta had in fact been a brooding introvert; he was not just a scholar of the Torah, but a critic of Scripture who discussed its contents with the rabbi and frequently argued with him. Throughout the district, he was thought of as someone special, and not just by those of his own creed, as someone who knew more than others—about religious matters in part, but also about other things that made him seem a little uncanny, or at the least, out of the ordinary. There was something unorthodox and sectarian about him, as if he were conversant with God, a baalshem or zaddik, a miracle man, particularly since, using only blood and spoken charms, he had once healed a woman with a loathsome skin condition and on another occasion had cured a boy of seizures. But this same aura of a somewhat perilous piety, in which the bloody odor of his profession played its role, had also been his undoing. During a pogrom, a panic of rage unleashed by the unexplained deaths of two Christian children, Elia had met a terrible end: he had been found hanging on the door of his own burning house, crucified to it with nails; and his wife, although bedridden with consumption, had fled the region with her children, little Leib and four others—all of them with arms raised, crying in loud lamentation."

Perfekt, mein Herr, – Sie sähen mich bereit. Wie aber die Dinge liegen, so erlauben Sie mir, einen anderen Vorschlag dafür einzusetzen. Es ist der folgende. Ich erinnere mich eines gehobenen Augenblicks, gleich zu Anfang unserer Bekanntschaft, – ich erinnere mich daran, obgleich ich damals dem Weine stark zugesprochen hatte –, eines Augenblicks also, da ich, angenehm berührt von Ihrem Naturell, im Begriffe stand, Ihnen das brüderliche Du anzubieten, mich aber dann der Einsicht nicht entzog, daß es ein etwas übereilter Schritt gewesen wäre. Gut, ich beziehe mich heute auf diesen Augenblick, ich komme auf {927}ihn zurück, ich erkläre den damals beschlossenen Aufschub für abgelaufen. Junger Mann, wir sind Brüder, ich erkläre uns dafür.

Perfect, sir, you see me ready. But as things stand, allow me to substitute another suggestion. It is the following. I remember a blissful moment, right at the beginning of our acquaintance - I remember it, although I had strongly encouraged wine at the time - a moment when, pleasantly touched by your nature, I was about to say the brotherly you to offer, but then didn't evade the realization that it would have been a somewhat hasty step. Well, today I refer to this moment, I come back to {927}it, I declare the postponement decided at that time to be over. Young man, we're brothers, I profess that.

I am offering it to you in this form, I am offering it to you in the form of a fraternity, such as is otherwise formed against third parties, against the world, against someone, and that we want to close in feeling for someone. Pick up your wine glass, young man, while I reach for my water glass again, which will do no more wrong to that bastard—”","Now he pulled himself to a more comfortable posture, supporting himself on one elbow, and said: “Well, young man, I have listened to you, and I have the whole picture. On my side, let me make you an honourable declaration. Were my hair not white, my limbs not racked with fever, you would see me ready to give you satisfaction, man to man, weapon to weapon, for the injury I unwittingly did you, and that which my companion added to it, for which likewise it is mine to atone. Positively, my friend—you would see me at your service. But as matters lie, you must let me make a different proposal. It is this: I recall an exalted moment, when our acquaintance was very young, when I felt myself pleasantly impressed by your native parts, and stood ready to offer you the brotherly thou; but then perceived that the moment was premature. Very good. I stand again to-day at that moment , I return to it, I declare that the period of probation has come to an end. Young man, we are brothers. Your phrase was that the thou had full sway—very good, let ours likewise have full sway, let us give free rein to brotherly feeling. The satisfaction which age and incapacity prevent me from giving you, I offer in another form, in the form of a brotherly alliance, such as one forms against a third party, against the world, against all and sundry; let us swear it to each other in the name of our feeling for somebody. Take your wineglass, young man, I will use the water-glass again, it does the crude new wine no shame—”","Now he sat up more comfortably, propping himself on his elbows, and said, “Young man, I have heard, and I have the picture. And on the basis of what you have just said, permit me to make an honorable declaration of my own. Were my hair not white and were I not so debilitated by this malign fever, you would see me prepared to give you satisfaction, man to man, weapon in hand, for the injury I have unwittingly inflicted upon you, and for the additional injury caused by my traveling companion, for which I likewise must take responsibility. Agreed, my good sir. You would see me prepared. But as things stand, you will permit me to make another suggestion in lieu of that. It is as follows: I recall a sublime moment, at the very beginning of our acquaintance— I recall it, though I had copiously partaken of wine—a moment when, touched by your pleasant temperament, I was about to offer you the brotherhood of informal pronouns, but could not avoid the realization that such a step would have been overhasty. Fine, I refer today to that moment, I return to it now, I declare the postponement we agreed upon then to be at an end. Young man, we are brothers, I declare us to be such. You spoke of the use of informal pronouns in their full meaning—and our use of them shall also be in the full meaning of a brotherhood of feeling. The satisfaction that old age and infirmity prevent me from offering you by means of weapons, I now offer you in this form; I offer it in the form of a bond of brotherhood, of the sort that is usually established against a third party, against the world, against someone else, but which we shall establish in our feelings for someone. Take up your wineglass, young man, while I reach yet again for my water tumbler—it will do this modest vintage no further harm—”"

It was utter cheek—will you tell me why they behave so cheekily?”","“Has the club been registered?” he asked, though he found it hard to speak, and it sounded more like a whine or whimper from suppressed laughter. “Do they have bylaws? What a shame you’re not a member, Joachim, because then they could include me as an honorary guest—or associate member. You should ask Behrens to put you temporarily out of commission. Maybe you’d be able to whistle, too, if you really set your mind to it, after all it must be something you can learn. That’s the funniest thing I’ve ever heard in my life,” he said, taking a deep breath. “You’ll have to forgive me, really, for talking like this, but they were in a merry mood themselves, your pneumatic friends. Here they come walking up . . . and to think that it was the Half-Lung Club! ‘Tweeet’ she whistles at me—what a harum-scarum! What absolute devil-may-care. And I’m sure you can tell me just why they’re so devil-may-care, can’t you?”"
"Mynheer Peeperkorn, ein älterer Holländer, war eine Zeitlang Gast des Hauses »Berghof«, das mit so großem Recht das Bei{827}wort »international« in seinem Schilde führte. Peeperkorns leicht farbige Nationalität – denn er war ein Kolonial-Holländer, ein Mann von Java, ein Kaffeepflanzer – würde uns kaum vermögen, seine, Pieter Peeperkorns (so hieß er, so bezeichnete er sich selbst; »jetzt labt Pieter Peeperkorn sich mit einem Schnaps«, pflegte er zu sagen) – würde uns, sagen wir, noch nicht bestimmen, seine Person zu elfter Stunde in unsere Geschichte einzuführen; denn du großer Gott, in was für Tinten und Abschattungen spielte nicht die Gesellschaft des bewährten Instituts, das Hofrat Doktor Behrens in vielzüngiger Redensartlichkeit ärztlich leitete! Nicht genug, daß neuerdings hier sogar eine ägyptische Prinzessin anwesend war, dieselbe, die dem Hofrat einst das bemerkenswerte Kaffeegeschirr und die Sphinxzigaretten geschenkt hatte, eine sensationelle Person mit nikotingelben beringten Fingern und kurzgeschnittenem Haar, die, von den Hauptmahlzeiten abgesehen, bei denen sie Pariser Toiletten trug, in Herrensakko und gebügelten Hosen umherging, übrigens von der Männerwelt nichts wissen wollte, sondern ihre zugleich träge und heftige Huld ausschließlich einer rumänischen Jüdin zuwandte, die schlecht und recht Frau Landauer hieß, während doch Staatsanwalt Paravant um Ihrer Hoheit willen die Mathematik vernachlässigte und vor Verliebtheit geradezu den Narren spielte: nicht genug also mit ihr persönlich, so befand sich unter ihrem kleinen Gefolge auch noch ein verschnittener Mohr, ein kranker, schwacher Mensch, der aber trotz seiner von Karoline Stöhr gern gehechelten Grundverfassung am Leben mehr zu hängen schien als irgend jemand, und sich untröstlich zeigte über das Bild, das die Platte von seinem Inneren aufwies, nachdem man seine Schwärze durchleuchtet hatte …","Mynheer Peeperkorn, an elderly Dutchman, was for a time a guest of the Berghof, which so rightly carried the word ""international"" in its name. Peeperkorn's faintly colored nationality - for he was a colonial Dutchman, a man from Java, a coffee planter - would hardly enable us to tell his, Pieter Peeperkorns (that was his name, that's what he called himself; 'Now Pieter Peeperkorn is having a schnapps «, he used to say) - would not, say, make us introduce his person at the eleventh hour into our history; for, good God, in what tinkering and shades did not play the company of the proven institute, which Hofrat Doctor Behrens medically managed in many tongues of speech! It was not enough that there was even an Egyptian princess present here, the same one who had once given the privy councilor the remarkable coffee set and the Sphinx cigarettes, a sensational person with nicotine-yellow ringed fingers and short-cropped hair who, apart from the main meals at which they were Parisians She wore toilets, went about in men's jackets and ironed trousers, didn't want to have anything to do with men, but showed her at the same time lazy and fierce kindness exclusively to a Romanian Jewess, whose bad name was Frau Landauer, while prosecutor Paravant neglected mathematics for Her Highness' sake and almost played the fool out of infatuation: not enough with her personally, there was also a mutated Moor among her small entourage, a sick, weak person who, despite his basic condition, which Karoline Stöhr liked to pander to, seemed to cling to life than anyone, un d was heartbroken at the image the plate showed of its interior after its blackness had been scanned...","MYNHEER PEEPERKORN, an elderly Dutchman, spent some time at House Berghof, that establishment which, in its prospectus, so correctly described itself as “international.” Pieter Peeperkorn—such was his name, so he called himself, as for instance, ‘Pieter Peeperkorn will now take unto himself a Hollands gin”—was a colonial Dutchman, a man from Java, a coffee-planter. His slightly faded nationality is scarcely sufficient ground for introducing him at this late day into our story. God knows we have had racial mixtures a-plenty in the famous cure conducted with such many-tongued efficiency by Herr Hofrat Behrens! There was the Egyptian princess who had given the Hofrat the extraordinary coffee-machine and sphinx cigarettes, a sensational person with cropped hair and beringed fingers yellow with nicotine, who went about—except at the main meal of the day, for which she made full Parisian toilet—in a sack coat and well-pressed trousers; and who scorned the world of men, to lay hot and heavy, though fitful siege to an insignificant little Roumanian Jewess called plain Frau Landauer, while Lawyer Paravant for her royal highness’s beaux yeux neglected his mathematics and altogether played the fool for love. This princess, in addition to her own colourful personality, had among her little suite a Moorish eunuch, a weak and sickly man, who yet, despite his basic and constitutional lack— upon which Caroline Stönr loved to dwell—clung to life more desperately than most, and was quite inconsolable over the conclusions Hofrat Behrens drew from the transparency they made of his dusky inside.","Mynheer Peeperkorn, an elderly Dutchman, had for some time been a guest of the Sanatorium Berghof, which quite rightly appended the adjective “international” to its name. Peeperkorn’s nationality and color—for he was a colonial Dutchman, a man from Java, a coffee-planter— would hardly be an incentive, or better, would not of itself be sufficient cause for us to introduce Pieter Peeperkorn ( for that was what he called himself, saying, “Pieter Peeperkorn will now regale himself with a schnapps”) at this late juncture in our story; for, good Lord, what shades and hues were not to be found in the society of the successful institution under the medical management of Hofrat Doctor Behrens, that polyglot of the idiomatic phrase. An Egyptian princess, for instance, had also recently become a guest, the same woman who had once given the director his remarkable coffee service and those sphinx cigarettes, a sensational lady with heavily ringed, nicotine-stained fingers and bobbed hair, who except for the main meal of the day, for which she dressed in finest Parisian fashion, went about clad in a man’s jacket and pleated trousers, but otherwise wanted nothing to do with men and devoted her equally indolent and fierce favors exclusively to a Jewish woman from Romania, with the very plain name of Frau Landauer, even though Prosecutor Paravant was so taken by Her Royal Highness that he neglected his mathematics and practically played the fool for love; and not only was there the lady herself, but included in her small retinue was a castrated Moor, a sickly, frail fellow, who despite his fundamental defect, which Karoline Stöhr loved to deride, clung more tightly to life than anyone else and proved inconsolable when presented with the picture taken of the interior that lay beneath his dusky skin."
"»Sie sprechen so drollig, Herr Settembrini,« sagte Hans Castorp, »so lebhaft, – ich weiß nicht, wie ich es nennen soll.«","""You speak so drollly, Herr Settembrini,"" said Hans Castorp, ""so animatedly—I don't know what to call it.""","“You have such an amusing way of talking, Herr Settembrini,” Hans Castorp said. “So lively, so—I don’t quite know how to characterize it.”","“You have such a droll way of speaking, Herr Settembrini,” Hans Castorp said. “It’s so—lively. I don’t really know how to put it.”"
"»Je m’en ficherais, je me fiche de tous ces Carducci et de la République éloquente et du progrès humain dans le temps, car je t’aime!«","»Je m’en ficherais, je me fiche de tous ces Carducci et de la République éloquente et du progrès humain dans le temps, car je t’aime!«","“Je m’en ficherais, je me fiche de tous ces Carducci et de la République éloquente et du progrès humain dans le temps, car je t’aime!”","But in his despair he merely shook his head, his face still directed toward the carpet, and replied, “I don’t care, I don’t care about Carducci and the republic of eloquence and human progress over time, because I love you!”"
"Placet experiri, dachte er bei sich lächelnd, denn so viel Latein verstand er auch noch, ohne sich einen homo humanus nennen zu dürfen. Und so hatte er denn ein Auge auf Settembrini und hörte bereitwillig und nicht ohne prüfende Aufmerksamkeit auf das, was er alles zum besten gab bei Begegnungen, wie sie bei den gemessenen Kurpromenaden zur Bank an der Bergwand oder nach »Platz« hinab sich beiläufig ereigneten, oder bei anderer Gelegenheit, zum Beispiel wenn Settembrini nach beendeter Mahlzeit sich als erster erhob und in seinen karierten Beinkleidern, einen Zahnstocher zwischen den Lippen, durch den Saal mit den sieben Tischen schlenderte, um gegen alle Vorschrift und Übung ein wenig am Tische der Vettern zu hospitieren. Er tat es, indem er in anmutiger Haltung, mit gekreuzten Füßen, Aufstellung nahm und mit dem Zahnstocher gestikulierend plauderte. Oder er zog auch einen Stuhl {229}heran, nahm Platz an einer Ecke zwischen Hans Castorp und der Lehrerin einerseits oder zwischen Hans Castorp und Miß Robinson andererseits und sah zu, wie die neun Tischgenossen ihren Nachtisch verzehrten, auf den er verzichtet zu haben schien.","Placet experiri, he thought to himself, smiling, because he understood so much Latin without being allowed to call himself a homo humanus. And so he kept an eye on Settembrini and listened willingly and not without examining attention to everything he said during encounters that happened casually on the measured spa promenades to the bank on the mountain wall or down to ""Platz"". or on other occasions, for example when Settembrini was the first to get up after the meal was over and, in his plaid trousers, with a toothpick between his lips, strolled through the hall with the seven tables, against all regulations and practice, to spend a little time at the cousins' table observe. He did it by standing in a graceful stance with crossed feet and chatting, gesturing with a toothpick. Or else he would pull up a chair and take a seat in a corner between Hans Castorp and the teacher on the one hand, or between Hans Castorp and Miss Robinson on the other, and watch the nine people at the table eat their dessert, which he seemed to have skipped .","“Placet experiri,” he thought to himself, with a smile. So much Latin he had, without calling himself a homo humanus. The upshot was that he kept his eye on Settembrini, listened keenly and critically to what he had to say when they met on their prescribed walks to the bench on the mountain-side, or down to the Platz, or wherever and whenever opportunity offered. Other occasions there were, too: for instance, at the end of a meal Settembrini would rise from table before anyone else and saunter across among the seven tables, in his check trousers, a toothpick between his lips, to where the cousins sat. He did this in defiance of law and custom, standing there in a graceful attitude, with his legs crossed, talking and gesticulating with the toothpick. Or he would draw up a chair and sit down at the corner of the table, between Hans Castorp and the schoolmistress, or between Hans Castorp and Miss Robinson, and look on while they ate their pudding, which he seemed to have forgone.","“Placet experiri,” he said to himself with a smile, because he understood that much Latin at least, without having to call himself a homo humanus. And so he turned an eye to Settembrini and reviewed eagerly, but cautiously and attentively, too, all the things the man had favored him with at their various encounters—on regular constitutionals to the bench on the mountain slope, or when they happened to meet on the way down to Platz, or on other occasions, too, as when, for example, Settembrini would be the first to get up after a meal, stroll through the dining hall with its seven tables, and, contrary to all customs and usages, stop to visit awhile with the cousins at their table. He would stand there in his checked trousers, a toothpick between his lips, assume his graceful pose with his ankles crossed, and chatter away, gesticulating now and then with the toothpick. Or he would pull up a chair and sit down at one corner, either between Hans Castorp and the teacher or between Hans Castorp and Miss Robinson, and watch his new tablemates consume a dessert he had apparently turned down."
"»Rebellio carnis«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Was willst du da machen? Da kann der tapferste Offizier nichts machen, und sogar der heilige Antonius wußte ein Lied davon zu singen. In Gottes Namen, Manöver sind jedes Jahr, und dann kennst du doch die hiesige Zeit! Es ist ja gar keine, du bist nicht lange genug fort gewesen, um nicht ganz leicht wieder ins Tempo zu kommen, und eh du die Hand drehst, ist deine kleine Nachkur vorbei.«","""Rebellio carnis,"" said Hans Castorp. ""What do you want to do? The bravest officer can't do anything about it, and even Saint Anthony knew how to sing a song about it. In God's name, maneuvers are every year, and then you know the local time! It's not one at all, you haven't been gone long enough to pick up the pace quite easily, and before you turn your hand your little follow-up is over.""","“Rebellio carnis,” Hans Castorp said. “What can you do about it? The bravest officer can do nothing— even St. Anthony had his little experiences. Good Lord, don’t the manœuvres come every year—and surely you know how time flies up here. You haven’t been gone long enough not to get back into step quite easily, and before you can turn round your little after-cure will be over.”","“Rebellio carnis,” Hans Castorp said. “What can you do? The bravest officer can’t help that—even Saint Anthony could hum you a tune about it. For God’s sake, there are maneuvers every year, and you know what time is like up here. It doesn’t exist. You haven’t been gone long enough to have trouble getting back into the swing of things. Your little extra therapy will be over quick as a flash.”"
"»Bitte, bitte«, antwortete Joachim liberal aus seiner Finsternis. Und beim Schüttern des Erdbodens, im Knistern und Rumoren der spielenden Kräfte spähte Hans Castorp gebückt durch das bleiche Fenster, spähte durch Joachim Ziemßens leeres Gebein. Der Brustknochen fiel mit dem Rückgrat zur dunklen, knorpeligen Säule zusammen. Das vordere Rippengerüst wurde von dem des Rückens überschnitten, das blasser {331}erschien. Geschwungen zweigten oben die Schlüsselbeine nach beiden Seiten ab, und in der weichen Lichthülle der Fleischesform zeigten sich dürr und scharf das Schulterskelett, der Ansatz von Joachims Oberarmknochen. Es war hell im Brustraum, aber man unterschied ein Geäder, dunkle Flecke, ein schwärzliches Gekräusel.","""Please, please,"" answered Joachim liberally out of his darkness. And while the ground shook, in the crackling and rumbling of the forces at play, Hans Castorp bent over and peered through the pale window, peered through Joachim Ziemssen's empty bones. The breastbone collapsed with the spine into a dark, gristly pillar. The anterior framework of ribs was overlapped by that of the back, which {331}appeared paler. The clavicles branched off on both sides, and in the soft, luminous covering of the fleshy form the shoulder skeleton, the base of Joachim's humerus, showed up, dry and sharp. It was light in the chest, but one could distinguish veins, dark spots, a blackish ripple.","“Of course,” Joachim replied magnanimously, out of the dark. And to the pulsation of the floor, and the snapping and cracking of the forces at play, Hans Castorp peered through the lighted window, peered into Joachim Ziemssen’s empty skeleton. The breastbone and spine fell together in a single dark column. The frontal structure of the ribs was cut across by the paler structure of the back. Above, the collar-bones branched off on both sides, and the framework of the shoulder, with the joint and the beginning of Joachim’s arm, showed sharp and bare through the soft envelope of flesh. The thoracic cavity was light, but blood-vessels were to be seen, some dark spots, a blackish shadow.","he asked. “Oh, please, go ahead and look,” came Joachim’s generous reply out of the blackness. And with the floor vibrating under him and great forces crackling and blustering at play around him, Hans Castorp peered through the pale window, peered into the void of Joachim Ziemssen’s skeleton. His breastbone merged with his spine into one dark, gristly column. The ribs at the front of his rib cage overlapped those at the back, which looked paler. The collarbone curved upward on both sides, and the bones of the shoulder, the joint where Joachim’s arm began, looked lean and angular against the soft halo of flesh. The chest cavity was bright, but one could make out a web of darker spots and blackish ruffles."

"»Exakt!« rief Settembrini. »Das Panier! Ich sehe, hier weht ein anderer Wind, – kein Zweifel, ich bin vor die rechte Schmiede gekommen. Fluchtartig also ergriff ich es … Wer so seine Worte zu setzen wüßte! – Darf ich mich nach den Fortschritten Ihrer Gesundheit erkundigen, Frau Stöhr?«","""Exactly!"" Settembrini exclaimed. ""The banner! I see a different wind is blowing here - no doubt I have come to the right forge. So I grabbed it like a fugitive... Who would know how to put his words like that! – May I inquire about the progress of your health, Frau Stöhr?”","“Pre-cisely,” shouted Settembrini. “I fled with my flag. Ah, what an apt phrase! I see I have come to the right place; nobody else here knows how to coin phrases like that.—May I be permitted to inquire after the state of your health, Frau Stöhr?”","“Precisely,” Settembrini cried. “The primroses! I see there’s quite a different wind blowing here —no doubt of it, I’ve found the right shop. And so I hastily vacated them—what a way you have with words, Frau Stöhr! Might I presume to inquire as to the state of your health?”"
"»Daß er sich schlägt,« versetzte Naphta, »bleibt immerhin eine greifbare Eigentümlichkeit seines Standes, lassen wir das gut sein. Es ist möglich, daß sie nicht hinreicht, diesen Stand in Ihrem Sinne ›geistig diskutabel‹ zu machen, aber sie rückt ihn in eine Sphäre, worein bürgerlicher Lebensbejahung jeder Einblick verwehrt ist.«","""The fact that he fights himself,"" replied Naphta, ""remains a tangible peculiarity of his class, let's leave it at that. It is possible that it is not sufficient to make this state of affairs 'intellectually debatable' in your sense, but it moves it into a sphere in which bourgeois life-affirmation is denied any insight.«","“But that he does fight,” rejoined Naphta, “remains the distinctive feature of his existence as a soldier. Let us agree so far. It may not be enough of a distinction to permit of his being ‘cited in the argument’; but even so, it puts him in a sphere remote from the comprehension of your civilian, with his bourgeois acceptation of life.” “What you are pleased to call the bourgeois acceptation of life,” retorted","“The simple fact that they do fight,” Naphta retorted, “remains an obvious characteristic of the profession, on that much we can agree. Possibly that does not suffice to make it ‘worth discussing from an intellectual standpoint,’ but it does remove them to a sphere beyond the ken of any bourgeois affirmation of life.”"

"Regelmäßige Abwandlungen des Normaltages fanden sich ein: zuerst ein Sonntag – und zwar ein Sonntag mit Kurmusik auf {169}der Terrasse, wie er vierzehntägig erschien, eine Markierung der Doppelwoche also, in deren zweite Hälfte Hans Castorp von außen eingetreten war. An einem Dienstag war er gekommen, und so war es der fünfte Tag, ein Tag von Frühlingscharakter nach jenem abenteuerlichen Wettersturz und Rückfall in den Winter, – zart und frisch, mit reinlichen Wolken am hellblauen Himmel und mäßigem Sonnenschein über Hängen und Tal, die wieder ein ordnungsgemäßes Sommergrün angenommen hatten, da der Neuschnee denn doch zu raschem Versickern verurteilt gewesen war.","There were regular modifications to the normal day: first a Sunday - namely a Sunday with spa music on {169}the terrace, as it appeared fortnightly, thus marking the double week, in the second half of which Hans Castorp had entered from outside. He had come on a Tuesday, and so it was the fifth day, a day of spring character after that adventurous fall in the weather and relapse into winter - delicate and fresh, with clean clouds in the light blue sky and moderate sunshine over slopes and valleys, which again had taken on a proper summer green, since the fresh snow had been doomed to seep away quickly.","REGULAR variations in the daily routine began to discover themselves. The first was Sunday, Sunday with a band on the terrace, which, it appeared, played there once a fortnight. Hans Castorp had arrived in the latter half of one of these periods. He had come on a Tuesday, and thus the Sunday was his fifth day up here—a day whose springlike character contrasted with the late extraordinary change and relapse into winter. It was mild and fresh, with pure white clouds in a pale blue sky, and gentle sunshine over vale and slopes, which displayed once more the green proper to the season, for the recent snow had been fated to speedy melting.","Deviations from the normal schedule occurred regularly. First of all, there was Sunday—a Sunday with a band concert on the terrace, offered every fourteen days as a way of marking the passage of two weeks; and it was in the middle of week number two when Hans Castorp entered from the outside world. He had arrived on a Tuesday and so it was his fifth day, an almost springlike day after the bizarre turn in the weather that had thrown them back into winter—mild, yet fresh, with tidy clouds in a bright blue sky and a sun shining gently on the slopes and valley, which now had returned to their proper summer green, because the recent snowfall had been doomed to melt quickly."
"»Gewiß, selbstvers-tändlich«, sagte James Tienappel entgegenkommend und etwas eingeschüchtert. Sein Pflegebruder sprach ruhig und eintönig. Ohne Hut, ohne Paletot saß er neben ihm in der frostnahen Frische des Herbstabends. »Dich friert wohl gar nicht?« fragte ihn James; denn er selbst zitterte {647}unter dem zolldicken Tuch seines Mantels, und seine Sprechweise hatte etwas zugleich Hastiges und Lahmes, da seine Zähne eine Neigung bekundeten, aneinanderzuschlagen. »Uns friert nicht«, antwortete Hans Castorp ruhig und kurz.","""Certainly, of course,"" James Tienappel said obligingly and a little intimidated. His foster brother spoke quietly and monotonously. Without a hat, without a palet, he sat next to him in the near-frosty freshness of the autumn evening. ""You don't feel cold?"" James asked him; for he himself trembled under the inch-thick cloth of his cloak, and there was something at once hasty and lame in his speech, as his teeth showed a tendency to chatter. ""We're not cold,"" Hans Castorp answered calmly and briefly.","“Certainly, of course,” James Tienappel acquiesced, rather intimidated. His fosterbrother spoke on, equably, monotonously. He sat without hat or overcoat, in the air, fresh to frostiness, of the autumn evening. “I suppose you aren’t cold?” James asked him, shivering in his inch-thick ulster. He talked fast and rather indistinctly, his teeth showing a tendency to chatter. “We don’t feel the cold,” Hans Castorp said, with tranquil brevity.","“But of course, to be sure,” James Tienappel concurred, somewhat intimidated by his foster brother, who spoke so calmly and in a monotone; the crisp autumn evening was close to freezing, yet there beside him sat Hans Castorp without hat or overcoat. “The cold doesn’t affect you, does it?” asked James, who was shivering despite the inch-thick fabric of his coat; and if there was something both hurried and halting about the way he put his question, it was because his teeth were very close to chattering. “We’re never cold,” Hans Castorp replied calmly and curtly."
"Hans Castorp war ebenfalls zur Begrüßung aufgestanden, die Spuren seiner Heiterkeitsausschreitung noch im Gesicht. Aber der Italiener bat beide in höflichen Worten, sich nicht in ihrer Bequemlichkeit stören zu lassen und nötigte sie auf ihre Plätze zurück, während er selbst in seiner angenehmen Pose vor ihnen stehen blieb. Er lächelte, wie er da stand und die Vettern, namentlich aber Hans Castorp, betrachtete, und diese feine, etwas spöttische Vertiefung und Kräuselung seines einen Mundwinkels unter dem vollen Schnurrbart, dort, wo er sich in schöner Rundung aufwärts bog, war von eigentümlicher Wirkung, es hielt gewissermaßen zur Geistesklarheit und Wachsamkeit an und ernüchterte den trunkenen Hans Castorp im Augenblick, so daß er sich schämte. Settembrini sagte:","Hans Castorp had also stood up to greet them, the traces of his outburst of merriment still on his face. But the Italian politely asked both of them not to be disturbed in their comfort and forced them back to their places while he himself remained in his pleasant pose in front of them. He smiled as he stood there and looked at the cousins, especially Hans Castorp, and this fine, somewhat mocking deepening and curling of the corner of his mouth under his full mustache, where it curved upwards in a beautiful curve, had a peculiar effect , it encouraged mental clarity and vigilance, so to speak, and sobered the drunken Hans Castorp for a moment so that he felt ashamed. Settembrini said:","Hans Castorp had got up at the same time, the traces of his burst of hilarity still on his face. But the Italian courteously bade them both not to disturb themselves, and made them sit down again, while he maintained his easy pose before them. He smiled standing there and looking at the cousins, in particular at Hans Castorp; a smile that was a fine, almost mocking, deepening and crisping of one corner of the mouth, just at the point where the full moustache made its beautiful upward curve. It had upon the cousins a singular effect: it somehow constrained them to mental alertness and clarity; it sobered the reeling Hans Castorp in a twinkling, and made him ashamed. Settembrini said: “You are in good spirits—and with reason too, with excellent reason.","Hans Castorp had also stood up by way of greeting, traces of excess merriment still on his face. But the Italian politely remarked that he did not wish to disturb them and urged them to take their seats, whereas he remained standing in his becoming pose. He stood there, smiling and observing the cousins, particularly Hans Castorp, and the delicate line at one corner of his mouth, the mocking curl of the lip just below where his full moustache swept handsomely upward, had a peculiar effect—somehow it exhorted one to be alert and clearheaded, and in a flash so sobered the inebriated Hans Castorp that he felt ashamed of himself. Settembrini said, “The gentlemen are in high spirits—and with good cause, good cause."
"Auch mischte denn jetzt Frau Chauchat sich ein, indem sie sagte, es sei nicht gut, die Unterhaltung ermüde Peeperkorn, er könne aufs neue Fieber davon haben, und wie ungern immer sie die Entrevue unterbreche, so müsse sie Hans Castorp nun doch bitten, es für diesmal genug sein zu lassen. Das tat er natürlich, aber noch oft, nach einem Quartananfall, saß er in den nächsten Monaten an des königlichen Mannes Bett, während Frau Chauchat, das Gespräch leicht überwachend oder sich auch mit einigen Worten daran beteiligend, hin und wider ging; und auch in Peeperkorns fieberfreien Tagen verbrachte er manche Stunde mit ihm und seiner perlengeschmückten Reisebegleiterin. Denn wenn der Holländer nicht bettlägerig war, versäumte er selten, nach dem Diner eine kleine, wechselnd zusammengesetzte Auswahl der Berghof-Gästeschaft zu Spiel {877}und Wein und allerhand weiteren Labungen um sich zu versammeln, sei es im Konversationszimmer, wie das erstemal, oder im Restaurant, wobei denn Hans Castorp gewohnheitsmäßig seinen Platz zwischen der lässigen Frau und dem großartigen Manne hatte; und selbst im Freien bewegte man sich miteinander, machte Spaziergänge zusammen, an denen etwa die Herren Ferge und Wehsal sich beteiligten und bald auch Settembrini und Naphta, die Widersacher im Geiste, denen zu begegnen man nicht hatte verfehlen können, und die mit Peeperkorn, wie zugleich denn endlich auch mit Clawdia Chauchat bekannt zu machen, Hans Castorp sich geradezu glücklich schätzte, – vollständig unbekümmert darum, ob diese Bekanntschaft und Verbindung den Disputanten willkommen war oder nicht und in dem stillen Vertrauen darauf, daß sie eines pädagogischen Objektes bedurften und lieber einen unwillkommenen Anhang in Kauf nehmen, als darauf verzichten würden, ihre Gegensätze vor ihm auszutragen.","Frau Chauchat then intervened, saying it was not good, the conversation was tiring Peeperkorn, he might get a fever from it again, and no matter how reluctant she was to interrupt the recital, she had to ask Hans Castorp to do it to let it be enough for this time. He did that, of course, but often, after a quartan fit, he sat at the royal man's bedside for the next few months, while Madame Chauchat walked back and forth, slightly monitoring the conversation or even sharing a few words; and even on Peeperkorn's fever-free days he spent many an hour with him and his beaded traveling companion. Because when the Dutchman wasn't bedridden, he seldom failed to gather a small, varied selection of the Berghof guests for games {877}and wine and all kinds of other refreshments after dinner, be it in the conversation room, like the first time, or in the restaurant, where Hans Castorp habitually had his place between the easy-going woman and the grand man; and even outdoors they moved together, went for walks together, in which Messrs. Ferge and Wehsal took part, and soon also Settembrini and Naphta, the adversaries in spirit whom one could not fail to meet, and those with Peeperkorn, how at the same time finally getting to know Clawdia Chauchat, Hans Castorp considered himself downright lucky - completely unconcerned about whether this acquaintance and connection was welcome to the debaters or not and in the quiet confidence that they needed a pedagogical object and would rather have one accept an unwelcome attachment than would refrain from carrying out their differences before him.","But here Frau Chauchat intervened, saying it was not good for Mynheer Peeperkorn to talk any longer, it tired him too much. She disliked to interfere, but Hans Castorp would forgive her if she suggested that they had had enough for the time. The young man accordingly took his leave. But often, in the months that followed, did Hans Castorp sit by the bed of that kingly man, when he kept it after an attack of fever; Frau Chauchat being within hearing, as she moved about the rooms, and sometimes taking part with a few words. They spent much time together when Peeperkorn was free of fever; for the Dutchman, on his good days, seldom failed to gather round him a select company, to play and drink and otherwise divert themselves and rejoice the inner man. These reunions took place either in the salon, as on the first occasion, or in the restaurant; and Hans Castorp had a habitual place between the great man and his languid companion. They even went abroad together, took walks with Herr Ferge and Wehsal, Naphta and Settembrini, those opposed spirits, whom they could hardly fail to meet. Hans Castorp counted himself fortunate in presenting them to Peeperkorn, and even, in the end, to Clavdia Chauchat. He troubled not at all whether the acquaintance was to these pedagogues’ liking or not. Secure in the knowledge that they needed a tree whereon to sharpen their pedagogical tusks, he reckoned on their putting up even with unwelcome society, in order to continue in enjoyment of his own.","Frau Chauchat broke in now, saying that this was not good for Peeperkorn, that the conversation was fatiguing him, might cause another fever attack, and as much as she disliked interrupting their visit, she really did have to ask Hans Castorp to let that be all for now. Which he did, of course; but over the next few months, he would often sit at the regal man’s bedside after one of these quartan attacks—while Frau Chauchat came and went, casually monitoring the conversation or participating with a few words of her own. And even on days when Peeperkorn was free of fever, Hans Castorp would spend several hours with him and his pearl-necklaced traveling companion. For when the Dutchman was not confined to bed, he seldom failed to gather about him a small, constantly changing assortment of Berghof guests for after-dinner games with wine and other regalements, either in the social rooms as on that first occasion, or in the restaurant; and Hans Castorp would take his customary seat between the great man and the careless woman. They kept company even outdoors, took walks together, and were joined at times by Herr Ferge and Herr Wehsal, and soon by Settembrini and Naphta as well, for they could not have failed to run into those intellectual adversaries; Hans Castorp thought himself very lucky to be able to introduce them to Peeperkorn, and, at last, to Clavdia Chauchat as well—and was totally unconcerned whether the disputants welcomed these new acquaintances and connections. He was quietly confident that they required a pedagogic object and would rather put up with unwelcome society than entirely forfeit the chance to thrash out their differences before him."

"Noch vorm Tee war er im Verwaltungsbureau. Das gedachte Zimmer, am selben Korridor wie seines gelegen, stand zur Verfügung. Auch für Frau Ziemßen würde sich Unterkunft finden. Er eilte zu Behrens. Er traf ihn im »Labor«, eine Zigarre in der einen Hand, in der anderen ein Reagenzglas mißfarbenen Inhalts.","Before tea he was in the administration office.

"{112}»Ja, ja,« sagte Joachim seufzend, »es ist wohl so ähnlich, wie wenn man Fieber hat – dabei herrscht auch ein besonders ›munterer Betrieb‹ im Körper, um deinen Ausdruck zu gebrauchen, und da mag es schon sein, daß man sich unwillkürlich nach einer Gemütsbewegung umsieht, wie du sagst, wodurch der Betrieb einen halbwegs vernünftigen Sinn bekommt … Aber wir reden so unangenehmes Zeug«, sagte er mit bebender Stimme und brach ab; worauf Hans Castorp nur mit den Achseln zuckte, und zwar ganz so, wie er es gestern abend zuerst bei Joachim gesehen hatte.","{112}""Yes, yes,"" said Joachim with a sigh, ""it's probably something like when you have a fever - there is also a particularly 'lively activity' in the body, to use your expression, and that's okay , that one involuntarily looks around for an emotion, as you say, which gives the operation a halfway reasonable meaning ... But we talk such unpleasant stuff,' he said in a trembling voice, and broke off; whereupon Hans Castorp just shrugged his shoulders, exactly as he had seen Joachim do it the first time last night.","“Yes, yes,” Joachim said, sighing. “It is the same thing, I suppose, as when you have fever—there are pretty lively goings-on in the system then too, to talk the way you do; it may easily be that one involuntarily tries to find an emotion which would explain, or even half-way explain the goings-on. But we are talking such unpleasant stuff,” he said, his voice trembling a little, and he broke off; whereupon Hans Castorp shrugged his shoulders—with the very gesture, indeed, which had, the evening before, displeased him in his cousin.","“Yes, yes,” Joachim said with a sigh, “it’s probably much like having a high fever. There’s quite a hustle and bustle—to use your expression—going on in your body in that case, too, and it may well be that one automatically looks around for some emotional stimulus, as you put it, to provide at least a halfway reasonable explanation for all the hustle and bustle. But we’re talking about such unpleasant things,” he said in a quivering voice and then broke off. To which Hans Castorp merely gave a shrug—in perfect imitation of the shrug he had first seen Joachim give the evening before."
"{670}Grund und Boden der Erziehungsanstalt waren weitläufig, wie ihre Baulichkeiten, die Raum für gegen vierhundert Zöglinge boten. Der Komplex umfaßte Wälder und Weideland, ein halbes Dutzend Spielplätze, landwirtschaftliche Gebäude, Ställe für Hunderte von Kühen. Das Institut war zugleich Pensionat, Mustergut, Sportakademie, Gelehrtenschule und Musentempel; denn beständig gab es Theater und Musik. Das Leben hier war herrschaftlich-klösterlich. Mit seiner Zucht und Eleganz, seiner heiteren Gedämpftheit, seiner Geistigkeit und Wohlgepflegtheit, der Genauigkeit seiner abwechslungsreichen Tageseinteilung schmeichelte es Leos tiefsten Instinkten. Er war überglücklich. Er erhielt seine vortrefflichen Mahlzeiten in einem weiten Refektorium, wo Schweigepflicht herrschte, wie auf den Gängen der Anstalt, und in dessen Mitte ein junger Präfekt auf hohem Katheder sitzend die Essenden mit Vorlesen unterhielt. Sein Eifer beim Unterricht war brennend, und trotz einer Brustschwäche bot er alles auf, um nachmittags bei Spiel und Sport seinen Mann zu stehen. Die Devotion, mit der er alltäglich die Frühmesse hörte und Sonntags am feierlichen Amte teilnahm, mußte die Väter-Pädagogen erfreuen. Seine gesellschaftliche Haltung befriedigte sie nicht weniger. An Festtagen, nachmittags, nach dem Genuß von Kuchen und Wein, ging er in grau und grüner Uniform, mit Stehkragen, Hosenstreifen und Käppi, in Reihe und Glied spazieren.","{670}The grounds of the educational institution were spacious, as were its buildings, which offered space for around four hundred pupils. The complex included woods and pastures, half a dozen playgrounds, farm buildings, stables for hundreds of cows. The institute was at the same time a boarding school, model estate, sports academy, scholarly school and temple to the muses; because there was always theater and music. Life here was stately and monastic. It flattered Leo's deepest instincts with its discipline and elegance, its serene subduedness, its spirituality and well-groomedness, the accuracy of its varied daily schedule. He was overjoyed. He received his excellent meals in a spacious refectory, where secrecy reigned, as in the corridors of the institution, and in the middle of which a young prefect, seated on a high lectern, entertained the diners with readings. His zeal in teaching was burning, and despite a weak chest he did everything to stand his ground in the afternoons at games and sports. The devotion with which he heard morning mass every day and took part in the solemn office on Sundays must have pleased the fathers-pedagogues. She was no less satisfied with his social attitude. On feast days, in the afternoons, after enjoying cake and wine, he went for a walk in rank and file in a gray and green uniform, with a stand-up collar, striped pants, and cap.","The property of the establishment was extensive, comprising in its buildings space for four hundred pupils, with wood and meadow land, half a dozen playing-fields, farm buildings, and stalls for hundreds of cows. The institution was at once boardingschool, model farm, athletic training-school, foster-mother of future scholars, and temple of the muses—for there were constant performances of plays and music. The life was both monastic and manorial. With its discipline and elegance, its quiet good cheer, its well-being, its intellectual atmosphere, and the precision of its varied daily regimen, it soothed and flattered the lad Leo’s deepest instincts. He was exaggeratedly happy. He ate excellent meals in a spacious refectory where the rule of silence obtained—as in the corridors of the establishment—and in the centre of which a young prefect sat on a raised platform and read aloud. Leo’s zeal in his classes was fiery; and despite the weakness of his chest he made every effort to hold his own in the games and sports. He went devotedly to early mass, and took part in the Sunday service with a fervour which must have been gratifying to his priestly teachers. His social bearing was no less satisfactory to them. And on high days and holy-days, after the cake and wine, he made one of the long line of pupils who, in grey and green uniform with a stripe on the trousers, high collar and kepi, went walking in the country.","The grounds of the institution were as extensive as the buildings themselves, which provided space for four hundred pupils. The complex included forests and meadows, a half-dozen athletic fields, agricultural buildings, including stalls for hundreds of cows.

Life was both stylish and monastic. The discipline and elegance, the hushed serenity and intellectual challenge, the well-ordered and well-tended life, the precise yet richly varied schedule—it all spoke to Leo’s profoundest instincts. He was beyond happy. He took his excellent meals in a huge refectory, where the rule of silence reigned—which was also the case in the corridors—and where a young prefect sat at his lectern in the middle of the room, high above the diners, and read to them. Leo showed a burning zeal for his studies and, despite a weakness of the chest, mustered all his strength to hold his own at games and sports. The devotion with which he listened to daily morning mass and worshiped at the solemn Sunday service could only delight his priestly pedagogues. His social deportment was no less satisfactory. On holiday afternoons, after partaking of cake and wine, he and his fellow students—in gray-and-green uniforms with stiff collars, striped trousers, and caps—went for a walk in closed formation."

"»Nun fange nur nicht wieder an, über die Zeit zu spintisieren!« sagte Joachim. »Ganz konfus hast du mich heute morgen gemacht.«","""Now don't start fooling around about time again!"" said Joachim. ""You got me all confused this morning.""","“Don’t begin to philosophize again about time,” said Joachim, “You had me perfectly bewildered this morning.”","“Now don’t start in theorizing about time again,” Joachim said. “You had me all confused this morning.”"
"Ihr also widmeten die beiden auf Fürbitte des Hofrats, da sie nun einmal so gutherzige Kerle seien, sich ganz besonders. Mit einer Blumensendung begann es, dann folgte ein Besuch bei der armen Karen auf ihrem kleinen Balkon in »Dorf« und hierauf diese und jene außerordentliche Unternehmung zu dritt: die Besichtigung einer Eislaufkonkurrenz, eines Bobsleighrennens. Denn es war nun die Wintersport-Jahreszeit unseres Hochtales auf voller Höhe, eine Festwoche wurde begangen, die Veranstaltungen häuften sich, diese Lustbarkeiten und Schauspiele, denen die Vettern bisher keine andere als nur eine gelegentlich-flüchtige Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt hatten. Joachim war ja allen Zerstreuungen hier oben abhold. Nicht um solcher willen war er hier, – war überhaupt nicht hier, um zu leben und sich mit dem Aufenthalt abzufinden, indem er ihn angenehm und abwechslungsreich gestaltete, sondern einzig und ganz allein, um sich möglichst rasch zu entgiften, damit er in der Ebene Dienst machen könne, wirklichen Dienst statt des Kurdienstes, der ein Ersatzmittel war, aber an dem er einen Raub nur widerwillig duldete. Sich tätig an der Winterlust zu beteiligen, war ihm verboten, und den Gaffer zu spielen, hatte ihm mißfallen. Was aber Hans Castorp betraf, so fühlte er sich {477}zu sehr, in einem zu strengen und intimen Verstande, als Mitglied Derer hier oben, um Sinn und Blick zu haben für das Treiben von Leuten, die in diesem Tale ein Sportgelände sahen.","So the two of them devoted themselves especially to her, at the request of the privy councillor, since they were such good-hearted fellows. It began with a delivery of flowers, then followed a visit to poor Karen on her little balcony in ""Village"" and then this and that extraordinary activity for three: visiting an ice-skating competition, a bobsleigh race. Because it was now the winter sports season in our high valley at full height, a festival week was celebrated, the events piled up, these merrymaking and spectacles to which the cousins had previously paid no other than an occasional fleeting attention. Joachim was averse to all distractions up here. He wasn't here for such reasons - wasn't here at all to live and to reconcile his stay by making it pleasant and varied, but solely to detoxify himself as quickly as possible, so that he could be on the plain service, real service instead of spa service, which was a substitute, but which he reluctantly tolerated being stolen from. He was forbidden to take an active part in Winterlust, and he had disliked playing the gawker. But as far as Hans Castorp was concerned, he felt too much, too severely and intimately, as a member of those up here to have a sense and eye for the doings of people who saw a sports ground in this valley.","The Hofrat, then, had appealed to the cousins in Karen’s behalf —they were such kind-hearted chaps—and they made her their especial ward; beginning with the gift of flowers, following on with a visit to the poor child upon her little balcony in the village; and continuing with various outings which the three took together, to see a skating race or a bob-sleigh competition. For the winter sport season was now at its height, there was a special week overcrowded with “events”—those feats and displays to which the cousins had previously paid only cursory attention. Joachim was averse from every kind of distraction up here. He was not here, he said, on their account; he was not here to enjoy life, and to put up with his sojourn in the measure in which it furnished him agreeable change and diversion. He was here solely and simply to get well as quickly as he could, in order to join the service below, real service, not the service of the cure, which was but a substitute—though to be sure he grudged any falling off in the duty he owed it. He was forbidden to join in the sports, to go and gape at them he did not like. As for Hans Castorp, he took too seriously, in too stern an inward a sense, his own share in the life of those up here to have a thought or a glance for the doings of people who made a sports station of the valley.","The director had pled her cause to the two cousins—since they were such good-hearted lads—and they were now devoted to her. Flowers were sent, this was followed by a visit with poor Karen on her little balcony in Dorf, and then the three of them began to undertake special outings together. They attended an ice-skating contest, a bobsled race—for the winter sport season in our Alpine valley was in full swing. There was a festival week with any number of entertainments—sports events and performances to which the cousins had paid only occasional, fleeting attention until now. Joachim had been averse to all amusements up here. He had not come here for that sort of thing, was certainly not here to enjoy his stay by organizing his life around a variety of diversions, but solely for the purpose of detoxifying his body as quickly as possible, so that he could take up his duties in the plains below, real duties, not just the duties of rest cure—which, even though it was only a substitute, he was loath to slight in any way. It was forbidden to take part in winter sports, and he had no desire to play the gaping onlooker. And as for Hans Castorp, he felt himself to be, in a very restricted and intimate sense, so very much a part of “the people up here” that he wasted not a thought or a glance on people who saw the valley as a sports arena."
"»Herr Hofrat«, setzte Joachim an … Er stand, mit bloßem Oberkörper, in geschlossener Haltung, Brust heraus, die Absätze zusammengenommen, und war so fleckig im Gesicht wie damals, als Hans Castorp bei bestimmter Gelegenheit erstmals bemerkt hatte, daß dies die Art des tief Gebräunten sei, blaß zu werden.","""Herr Hofrat,"" began Joachim ... He stood shirtless, in a closed posture, chest out, heels together, and his face was as spotty as it had been when Hans Castorp first noticed on a certain occasion that this was the species of the deeply tanned is to turn pale.","“Herr Hofrat,“ Joachim began. He stood bare to the waist, heels together and chest out, with a determined bearing, and as mottled in the face as ever he had been that time when Hans Castorp first made observations on the pallor of the deeply tanned.","“Director Behrens,” Joachim began—he was standing there naked from the waist up, but still at attention, his chest thrust forward, his heels together, and with a face as blotchy as it was the first time Hans Castorp had noticed that this was how his tanned face looked when it turned pale."
"Peeperkorn, an den Kammerdiener gelehnt, zog seine Arabesken hoch und verlangte zu wissen, warum das nicht gehe.","Peeperkorn, leaning against the valet, drew up his arabesques and demanded to know why it wasn't working.","Peeperkorn, in the arms of his valet, drew up his arabesques and demanded to know why.","Leaning against his valet now, Peeperkorn raised those arabesques high and demanded to know why it would not do."

"»Nein, ich wußte es schon selber. Es ist nur merkwürdig, es so zu hören«, sagte Hans Castorp.","'No, I already knew it myself. It's just strange hearing it that way,' said Hans Castorp.","“No, of course I knew. Only it sounds strange to hear it like that,” Hans Castorp said.","“No, I already knew it on my own.

"»Guten Morgen!« wünschte er mit heiterer Stimme, in dem Wunsch, einen natürlichen Ton sofort in die Versammlung einzuführen, der Böses zerstreuen helfen sollte, – hatte aber kein Glück damit, denn niemand antwortete ihm. Die gewechselten Grüße bestanden in stummen Verbeugungen, die bis zur Unsichtbarkeit steif waren. Dennoch blieb er entschlossen, seine Ankunftsbewegung, den herzlichen Hochgang seines Atems, die Wärme, die der rasche Gang durch den Wintermorgen ihm mitgeteilt, ohne Säumen zum guten Zweck zu verwenden und fing an:","""Good morning!"" he wished in a cheerful voice, desiring to introduce at once into the assembly a natural tone to help scatter evil-but had no luck, for no one answered him. The greetings exchanged consisted of mute bows, stiff to the point of invisibility. Nevertheless, he remained determined to use his arrival movement, the hearty rush of his breath, the warmth that the rapid walk through the winter morning communicated to him, without hesitation, for a good purpose and began:","“Good-morning,” he said cheerily, with the idea of lending the scene a note of the natural, which should help to dissipate its evil bearing—but was out of luck, for nobody answered. The greetings consisted in silent bows, so stiff as to be almost imperceptible. However, he was resolved to convert the energy from his walk, the splendid warmth engendered by brisk motion in the cold air, at once and without delay to good purpose; and so began: “Gentlemen, I am convinced—”","“Good morning,” he wished them in a cheery voice, hoping his words would lend a natural tone to the gathering and help banish all evil—but with no success, for no one replied. The exchange of greetings consisted of mute bows, so stiff they were practically indiscernible. All the same, he remained determined to put to immediate good effect the bustle of arrival, the hearty billowing of his breath in the cold air, the warmth of his quick walk in the winter morning."
"Man hörte das Umlegen eines Hebels. Ein Motor sprang auf und sang wütend in die Höhe, wurde aber durch einen neuen Handgriff zur Stetigkeit gebändigt. Der Fußboden bebte gleichmäßig. Das rote Lichtlein, länglich und senkrecht, blickte mit stillem Drohen herüber. Irgendwo knisterte ein Blitz. Und langsam, mit milchigem Schein, ein sich erhellendes Fenster, trat aus dem Dunkel das bleiche Viereck des Leuchtschirms hervor, vor welchem Hofrat Behrens auf seinem Schusterschemel ritt, die Schenkel gespreizt, die Fäuste daraufgestemmt, die Stumpfnase dicht an der Scheibe, die Einblick in eines Menschen organisches Inneres gewährte.","You could hear the flick of a lever. A motor sprang up and sang angrily into the air, but was tamed to steadiness by a new handle. The floor shook evenly. The little red light, elongated and vertical, looked over with silent menace. Lightning crackled somewhere. And slowly, with a milky glow, a lightening window, the pale square of the fluorescent screen emerged from the darkness, in front of which Hofrat Behrens rode on his shoemaker's stool, his thighs spread, his fists planted on them, his snub nose close to the pane, the view into of a human being's organic interior.","They heard a switch go on. A motor started up, and sang furiously higher and higher, until another switch controlled and steadied it. The floor shook with an even vibration. The little red light, at right angles to the ceiling, looked threateningly across at them. Somewhere lightening flashed. And with a milky gleam a window of light emerged from the darkness: it was the square hanging screen, before which Hofrat Behrens bestrode his stool, his legs sprawled apart with his fists supported on them, his blunt nose close to the pane, which gave him a view of a man’s interior organism.","They heard a switch thrown. A motor started, its angry hum mounting higher and higher, but suddenly reduced again to a drone at the flip of another switch. The floor vibrated steadily. The little red light, a long vertical slit, stared at them, silent and threatening. A spark crackled somewhere. The milky glow of a slowly brightening window, the pale rectangle of the fluorescent screen, emerged out of the darkness. And before it sat Director Behrens astride his footstool—thighs spread wide, fists propped against them, snub nose close to the screen that gave him a view into the organic interior of another human being."
"Mit eingestemmten Armen stand er und sagte »So, so«. Hier war es, daß ein melancholisches Lächeln sich in seinen Zügen hervorbildete. »Ach so«, sagte er und nickte. Da hatte einer Fersengeld gegeben. Hals über Kopf, in stummer Eile, als müsse er die Entschlußkraft eines Augenblicks wahrnehmen und dürfe beileibe diesen Augenblick nicht verpassen, hatte er seine Sachen in die Koffer geworfen und war davon: allein, nicht zu zweien, nicht nach Erfüllung seiner ehrenhaften Sendung, aber heilfroh, auch nur allein davonzukommen, der Biedermann {662}und Flüchtling zur Flachlandsfahne, Onkel James. Na, glückliche Reise!","He stood with his arms akimbo and said, ""So, so."" It was here that a melancholy smile appeared on his face. ""Oh,"" he said and nodded. Since someone had heeled. Head over heels, in a silent hurry, as if he had to seize the power of a moment and must not miss this moment, he had thrown his things into his suitcase and was off: alone, not in pairs, not after completing his honorable mission, but glad to get away even alone, the honest man {662}and fugitive to the plains flag, Uncle James. Well, happy voyage!","Arms akimbo, he stood and said: “Well, well!” And a pensive smile overspread his features. “Yes, yes,” he said, and nodded. Somebody had taken to his heels. In headlong haste, breathless, as though the moment of resolution must not be let slip, he had flung his things together and made off. Not with his cousin by his side, not after fulfilment of his lofty mission, but glad to save even himself by flight, the goodman had deserted to the flat-land—well, pleasant journey to you, Uncle James!","He stood there arms akimbo and said, “I see, I see.” It was at this point that the melancholy smile spread over his face. “Ah, yes,” he said and nodded. So he had turned tail and run, head over heels, in silent haste, as if he had seized the resolve of the moment, dared not for the life of him let that moment pass, had thrown his things into his bags and off he had gone. Alone, not with his nephew, not in fulfillment of his honorable mission, but overjoyed at having escaped, even if it was all alone—the upright citizen and deserter to the flag of the flatlands, Uncle James. Well, bon voyage."

"Es war da ferner das Briefmarkensammeln, das, alle Zeit von {953}einzelnen betrieben, zeitweise zu allgemeiner Besessenheit um sich griff. Jedermann klebte, schacherte, tauschte. Philatelistische Zeitschriften wurden gehalten, Korrespondenzen mit Spezialgeschäften des In- und Auslandes, mit Fachvereinen und Privatliebhabern unterhalten und erstaunliche Summen zur Gewinnung seltener Wertzeichen selbst von solchen aufgebracht, deren häusliche Verhältnisse den monate- oder jahrelangen Aufenthalt in der Luxusheilstätte nur knapp gestatteten.","There was also stamp collecting, which, all the time pursued by individuals, at times spread to general obsession. Everyone stuck, haggled, bartered. Philatelic magazines were kept, correspondence was maintained with specialist shops at home and abroad, with specialist associations and private enthusiasts, and astonishing sums were raised to obtain rare stamps, even from those whose domestic circumstances only just allowed them to stay in the luxury sanatorium for months or years.","Then there was the collecting of postage stamps, a considerable interest at all times, but rising periodically to an obsession. Everybody pasted, haggled, exchanged, took in philatelic magazines, carried on correspondence with special vendors, foreign and domestic, with societies and private owners; astonishing sums were spent for rare specimens, even by people whose means were scarcely adequate to their expenses at the Berghof.","Then there was stamp collecting, which was always pursued by a few individuals, but occasionally ran rampant as a general obsession. Everyone pasted, haggled, traded. People subscribed to philatelic magazines, corresponded with special vendors, clubs, and private hobbyists, at home and abroad; and amazing sums were spent to purchase rare specimens, even by those whose budgets barely permitted them to stay at a deluxe sanatorium for months or years on end."
"»Das kann man nicht sagen«, erwiderte Joachim sachlich. »Will’s Gott, so wird es noch schöne Sommertage geben. Selbst im September ist das noch sehr wohl möglich. Aber die Sache ist die, daß die Jahreszeiten hier nicht so sehr voneinander verschieden sind, weißt du, sie vermischen sich sozusagen und halten sich nicht an den Kalender. Im Winter ist oft die Sonne so stark, daß man schwitzt und den Rock auszieht beim Spazierengehen, und im Sommer, nun, das siehst du ja schon, wie es im Sommer hier manchmal ist. Und dann der Schnee – er bringt alles durcheinander. Es schneit im Januar, aber im Mai nicht viel weniger, und im August schneit es auch, wie du bemerkst. Im ganzen kann man sagen, daß kein Monat vergeht, ohne daß es schneit, das ist ein Satz, an dem man festhalten kann. Kurz, es gibt Wintertage und Sommertage und Frühlings- und Herbsttage, aber so richtige Jahreszeiten, die gibt es eigentlich nicht bei uns hier oben.«","""You can't say that,"" Joachim replied matter-of-factly. “God willing, there will still be beautiful summer days. Even in September this is still very possible. But the thing is, the seasons aren't that different here, you know, they sort of mix and they don't stick to the calendar. In winter the sun is often so strong that you sweat and take off your skirt to go for a walk, and in summer, well, you can see how it is here sometimes in the summer. And then the snow – it messes everything up. It snows in January, but not much less in May, and it snows in August too, as you notice. All in all one can say that not a month goes by without it snowing, that's a statement to which one can hold fast. In short, there are winter days and summer days and spring and autumn days, but there aren’t really any real seasons up here.«","“You can’t tell,” answered the matter-of-fact Joachim. “We may have fine summer weather yet. Even in September it is very possible. The truth is, the seasons here are not so distinct from each other; they run in together, so to speak, and don’t keep to the calendar. The sun in winter is often so strong that you take off your coat, and perspire as you walk. And in summer—well, you see for yourself! And then the snow, that puts out all one’s calculations. It snows in January, but in May not much less, and, as you observe, it snows in August too. On the whole, one may say there is never a month without snow; you may take that for a rule. In short, there are winter days and summer days, spring and autumn days; but regular seasons we don’t actually have up here.” “A fine mixed-up state of affairs,” said Hans Castorp.","“There’s no telling,” Joachim replied matter-of-factly. “God willing, there’ll be some lovely summer days yet. That’s still quite possible, even in September. But the main thing is that the seasons here are not all that different from one another, you see. They get all mixed up, so to speak, and pay no attention to the calendar. In winter the sun is often so strong that you sweat and take off your jacket when you’re out for a walk, and in summer—well, you’ve just seen how summer can be here sometimes. And then there’s the snow —it mixes everything higgledy-piggledy. There’s snow in January, but almost as much in May, and it can snow in August, too, as you’ve noticed. On the whole, you can say there’s not a month when it doesn’t snow— that’s the one rule a man can hold on to. In short, there are winter days and summer days, spring and autumn days, but no real seasons, we don’t actually have those up here.” “What a pretty mess,” Hans Castorp said."
"»Ein solcher Triumph ist nicht möglich, denn die Autorität ist der Mensch, sein Interesse, seine Würde, sein Heil, und zwischen ihr und der Wahrheit kann es keinen Widerstreit geben. Sie fallen zusammen.«","“Such a triumph is not possible, for authority is man, his interest, his dignity, his salvation, and there can be no conflict between it and truth. They collapse.""","Naphta replied: “There can be no such triumphs as those you speak of; for the authority is man himself—his interests, his worth, his salvation—and thus between it and truth no conflict is possible. They coincide.”","“Such a triumph is an impossibility,” Naphta replied, “because the authority is man himself—his interests, his dignity, his salvation—and there can be no contradiction between man and truth. They coincide.”"
»Wird es hübsch?« fragte Hans Castorp noch. »Machen Sie Ärmel daran?«,"""Will it be nice?"" asked Hans Castorp. ""Do you put sleeves on it?""",“Will it be pretty?” persisted Hans Castorp. “Will it have sleeves?”,“Will it be pretty?” Hans Castorp asked anew. “Will it have sleeves?”
"Wenn man aber am Tische selbst von der Beendigung seiner Zurückgezogenheit nicht viel Aufhebens gemacht hatte, – wie hätte man im weiteren Saal welches davon machen sollen? Dort hatte buchstäblich niemand auch nur Notiz davon genommen, – mit alleiniger Ausnahme Settembrinis, der nach Schluß der Mahlzeit zu spaßhaft-freundschaftlicher Begrüßung herangekommen war. Hans Castorp hätte freilich noch eine weitere Einschränkung gemacht, deren Berechtigung wir dahinstellen müssen. Er behauptete bei sich, daß Clawdia Chauchat sein Wiedererscheinen bemerkt –, gleich bei ihrem, wie immer, verspäteten Eintreten, nach dem Zufallen der Glastür, ihren schmalen Blick habe auf ihm ruhen lassen, dem er mit seinem begegnet war, und kaum, daß sie sich niedergesetzt, noch einmal über die Schulter sich lächelnd nach ihm umgesehen habe: lächelnd, wie vor drei Wochen, bevor er zur Untersuchung gegangen. Und eine so unverhohlene und rücksichtslose Bewegung war das gewesen – rücksichtslos in betreff seinerselbst {313}wie auch der übrigen Gästeschaft –, daß er nicht gewußt hatte, ob er sich darüber entzücken oder es als ein Zeichen von Geringschätzung verstehen und sich darüber ärgern sollte. Auf jeden Fall hatte sein Herz sich zusammengekrampft unter diesen Blicken, welche die zwischen der Kranken und ihm obwaltende gesellschaftliche Unbekanntschaft auf eine in seinen Augen ungeheuerliche und berauschende Weise verleugnet und Lügen gestraft hatte, – sich fast schmerzhaft zusammengekrampft schon, als die Glastür klirrte, denn auf diesen Augenblick hatte er mit kurz gehendem Atem gewartet.","But if at the table one had not made much fuss about the end of one's seclusion, how could one have made any of it in the further room? Literally no one there had even noticed -- the sole exception of Settembrini, who had come over to greet them jokingly after the meal was over. Of course, Hans Castorp would have made another restriction, the justification of which we have to question. He claimed to himself that Clawdia Chauchat noticed his reappearance--as soon as she entered, late as usual, after the glass door had slammed shut, she had let her narrow gaze rest on him whom he had met with his, and scarcely had she sat down, looked around at him again over my shoulder, smiling: smiling, like three weeks ago, before he went to the check-up. And it had been such a blatant and ruthless movement - ruthless towards himself {313} as well as towards the rest of the guests - that he had not known whether to be delighted with it or to take it as a sign of contempt and to be angry about it. In any case, his heart had clenched under these looks, which the social obscurity between the patient and himself had denied and given the lie to in a way that was monstrous and intoxicating in his eyes - clenched almost painfully when the glass door rattled, because he had waited for this moment with short breathing.","If, even at his own table, the end of his retirement caused no stir, how should it have been remarked in the rest of the dining-room? And literally no soul had taken notice of it save Settembrini, who strolled over at the end of the meal to exchange a lively greeting. Hans Castorp, indeed, would have made a mental reservation, in which he may or may not have been justified: he told himself that Clavdia Chauchat had noticed his return, that she had no sooner made her tardy entrance, and let the glass door slam behind her, than she rested her narrow gaze upon him—which he had met with his own—and that even after she sat down, she had turned and looked toward him, smiling over her shoulder, as she had three weeks before, on the day of his examination. The movement had been so open, so regardless—regardless of both himself and the other guests—that he did not know whether to be in ecstasies over it or to take it as a mark of contempt and feel angry. At all events, his heart had contracted beneath this glance, which so markedly and intoxicatingly gave the lie to the lack of social relations subsisting between him and the fair patient. It had contracted almost painfully at the moment when the glass door slammed, for to that moment he had looked forward with his breath coming thick and fast.","And if the people at his own table did not make much fuss about the end of his isolation, how could anyone else in the dining hall have done so? Literally no one there had noticed his return—with the sole exception of Settembrini, who came over at the end of the meal to extend a friendly, witty greeting. Hans Castorp, of course, added one further exception of his own, though with what justification we shall have to leave undecided. He told himself that Clavdia Chauchat had noticed his reappearance—the moment she entered, late as always and having first let the glass door slam, her narrow eyes had rested on him, or so it seemed, and had met his own; no sooner had she sat down than she had looked back over her shoulder at him and smiled the same smile he had seen three weeks before, on the day of his examination. And she was so open, even brazen, about it—brazen in regard both to him and to the rest of the guests—that he had not known whether to be overjoyed or, in case it was a mark of disdain, upset. At any rate, his heart had shrunk beneath those looks—which in his eyes had contradicted and denied, in a most flagrant and intoxicating fashion, the reality that he and the sick woman were not so much as social acquaintances—had, in fact, shrunk almost painfully at the first rattle of the glass door, and his breath had come short and shallow as he sat waiting for that moment."
"Die Zeit schlich, die Frist schien endlos. Erst zweiundeinehalbe Minute waren verstrichen, als er nach den Zeigern sah, schon besorgt, er könnte den Augenblick verpassen. Er tat tausend Dinge, nahm Gegenstände auf und setzte sie nieder, trat auf den Balkon hinaus, ohne sich seinem Vetter bemerklich zu machen, überblickte die Landschaft, dies Hochtal, seinem Sinn schon urvertraut in allen Gestaltungen: mit seinen Hörnern, Kammlinien und Wänden, mit der links vorgelagerten Kulisse des »Brembühl«, dessen Rücken schräg gegen den Ort hin abfiel und dessen Flanke der rauhe Mattenwald bedeckte, mit den Bergformationen zur Rechten, deren Namen ihm ebenfalls geläufig geworden waren, und der Alteinwand, die das Tal, von hier aus gesehen, im Süden zu schließen schien, – sah hinab auf die Wege und Beete der Gartenplattform, die Felsengrotte, die Edeltanne, lauschte auf ein Flüstern, das aus der Liegehalle drang, wo Kur gemacht wurde, und wandte sich ins Zimmer zurück, wobei er die Lage des Instrumentes im Munde zu verbessern suchte, um dann wieder durch Vorrecken des Armes den Ärmel vom Handgelenk zu ziehen und den Unterarm vor das Gesicht zu biegen. Mit Mühe und Anstrengung, unter Schieben, Stoßen und Fußtritten gleichsam, waren sechs Minuten vertrieben. Da er nun aber, mitten im Zimmer stehend, ins Träumen verfiel und seine Gedanken wandern ließ, so verhuschte die letzte noch übrige ihm unvermerkt auf Katzenpfötchen, eine neue Armbewegung offenbarte ihm ihr heimliches Entkommen, und es war ein wenig zu spät, die achte lag schon zu einem Dritteile im Vergangenen, als er mit dem Gedanken, daß das nichts schade, für das Ergebnis nichts aus{259}mache und zu bedeuten habe, das Thermometer aus dem Munde riß und mit verwirrten Augen darauf niederstarrte.","Time crept, the deadline seemed endless. Only two and a half minutes had passed when he checked the hands, already worried he might miss the moment. He did thousands of things, picked up objects and put them down, stepped out onto the balcony without making his cousin notice, surveyed the landscape, this high valley, already familiar to him in all its forms: with its horns, ridge lines and walls, with the backdrop of the ""Brembühl"" on the left, whose back slopes diagonally towards the village and whose flanks are covered by the rough Mattenwald, with the mountain formations on the right, whose names he had also become familiar with, and the old canvas that depicts the valley from here Seen from the south, seemed to be close - looked down on the paths and beds of the garden platform, the rock grotto, the silver fir, listened to a whisper that came from the lounge where the cure was being taken, and turned back into the room, whereby he tried to improve the position of the instrument in his mouth, in order to pull his sleeve off his wrist again by stretching his arm and bend his forearm in front of his face. With effort and exertion, with pushing, pushing and kicking, as it were, six minutes were passed. But as he now, standing in the middle of the room, fell into dreaming and let his thoughts wander, the last one that was left slipped away unnoticed on cat's paws, a new arm movement revealed its secret escape, and it was a little too late, the eighth one lay already a third in the past, when he tore the thermometer out of his mouth and stared down at it with bewildered eyes, thinking that it didn't do any harm, didn't matter and didn't mean anything for the result.","The time crept on; the term seemed unending. When he looked at his watch, two and a half minutes had passed—and he had feared the seven minutes were already more than up. He did a thousand things: picked up objects about the room and set them down again, walked out on the balcony—taking care that his cousin should not notice his presence—and looked at the landscape of this high valley, now so familiar to him in all its phases; with its horns, its crests and walls, with the projecting wing of the “Brembühl,” the ridge of which sloped steeply down to the valley, its flanks covered with rugged undergrowth, with its formations on the right side of the valley, whose names were no less familiar than the others, and the Alteinwand, which from this point appeared to close in the valley on the south. He looked down on the garden beds and paths, the grotto and the silver fir; he listened to the murmur that rose from the rest-hall; and he returned to his room, settling the thermometer under his tongue. Then, with a motion of the arm which drew away the sleeve from his wrist, he brought the forearm before his eyes and found that by dint of pushing and shoving, pulling and hauling, he had managed to get rid of full six minutes. The last one he spent standing in the middle of the room—but then, unfortunately, he let his thoughts wander and fell into a “doze,” so that the sixty seconds flew by on the wings of the wind; and, when he looked again, the eighth minute was already past its first quarter. “It doesn’t really matter, so far as the result is concerned,” he thought, and tearing the instrument out of his mouth, he stared at it in confusion.","Time crept by—seven minutes seemed endless. Only two and a half had passed when he looked at his watch again, worried that he might have missed the precise moment. He did a thousand things, picked up objects, put them back down, walked out onto the balcony, but not so that his cousin could notice, looked at the landscape of this Alpine valley, his eyes now more than familiar with its shapes and forms—its peaks, ridges, and cliffs; in the background on his left, though somewhat closer, was the jutting Brämenbühl, whose crest fell abruptly toward town and whose flank was thickly covered with coarse grasses; there were the mountain formations on his right, whose names he also knew by now; and then to the south was the Alteinwand, which from here looked as if it closed off the valley. He looked down at the paths and flowerbeds of the level gardens, the grotto, the silver fir, listened to whispers drifting up from the lounging area, where people were taking their rest cure—and turned back into the room, where he tried to correct the way the instrument sat in his mouth. Stretching his arm to free his wrist from its sleeve, he brought his forearm up to his eyes. With much trouble and effort—as if he were shoving, pushing, kicking them—he had got rid of six minutes. But now, standing there in the middle of the room, he fell to daydreaming and let his thoughts wander, and the one remaining minute scurried away on little cat’s feet, until another motion of his arm told him that the minute had secretly escaped and that it was a little late now. Almost a third of the next had passed before he grabbed the thermometer from his mouth, telling himself that it did not really matter, would not alter the results, could not hurt anything—and he stared down at it now with confusion in his eyes."
"»Krankheit und Verzweiflung,« sagte Settembrini, »sind auch oft nur Formen der Liederlichkeit.«","""Sickness and despair,"" said Settembrini, ""are often just forms of licentiousness.""","“Disease and despair,” Settembrini said, “are often only forms of depravity.”","“Illness and despair,” Settembrini said, “are often only forms of depravity.”"
"»Hallo!« sagte er. »Das sind ja unsere Dioskuren! Castorp und Pollux … Bitte, Wehelaute zu unterdrücken! Warten Sie nur, gleich werden wir Sie alle beide durchschaut haben. Ich glaube, Sie haben Angst, Castorp, uns Ihr Inneres zu eröffnen? Seien Sie ruhig, es geht ganz ästhetisch zu. Hier, haben Sie meine Privatgalerie schon gesehen?« Und er zog Hans Castorp am Arm vor die Reihen der dunklen Gläser, hinter denen er knipsend Licht einschaltete. Da erhellten sie sich, zeigten ihre Bilder. Hans Castorp sah Gliedmaßen: Hände, Füße, Kniescheiben, Ober- und Unterschenkel, Arme und Beckenteile. Aber die rundliche Lebensform dieser Bruchstücke des Menschenleibes war schemenhaft und dunstig von Kontur; wie ein Nebel und bleicher Schein umgab sie ungewiß ihren klar, minutiös und entschieden hervortretenden Kern, das Skelett.","he said. “These are our Dioscuri! Castorp and Pollux... Please stop your wailing! Just wait, we'll have both of you figured out in a moment. I think you're afraid, Castorp, to open up your insides to us? Don't worry, it's very aesthetic. Here, have you already seen my private gallery?' And he pulled Hans Castorp by the arm in front of the rows of dark glasses, behind which he snapped the light on. Then they lit up and showed their pictures. Hans Castorp saw limbs: hands, feet, kneecaps, thighs and lower legs, arms and pelvis. But the plump life form of these fragments of human body was dim and hazy in outline; like a haze and pale glow it uncertainly surrounded its clearly, meticulously and decisively emerging core, the skeleton.","“Hallo,” said he. “Here are our Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux. If you feel any inclination to blub, kindly suppress it. Just wait, we shall soon see through you both. I expect, Castorp, you feel a little nervous about exposing your inner self to our gaze? Don’t be alarmed, we preserve all the amenities. Look here, have you seen my picture-gallery?” He led Hans Castorp by the arm before the rows of dark plates on the wall, and turned on a light behind them. Hans Castorp saw various members: hands, feet, knee-pans, thigh-and leg-bones, arms, and pelvises. But the rounded living form of these portions of the human body was vague and shadowy, like a pale and misty envelope, within which stood out the clear, sharp nucleus—the skeleton.","“Hello there,” he said. “Why, it’s our Dioscuri boys—Castor and Pollux. Please, keep all screams of pain to a minimum. Be careful now, we’re going to look right through you both. I believe you’re afraid to reveal your insides to us, aren’t you, Castorp? You may set your mind at ease—our procedures are quite aesthetic. Look here—have you seen my private gallery?” And grabbing Hans Castorp by the arm, he pulled him over to the rows of dark glass plates; he flipped a switch. Illuminated now, the plates revealed pictures. Hans Castorp saw body parts: hands, feet, knees, thighs, calves, arms, pelvises. But the rounded living contours of these fragments of the human body were phantomlike and hazy; like a fog or a pale, uncertain aura, they enclosed a clear, detailed, and carefully defined core: the skeleton."
"Er bekam ein Glas Wein eingeschenkt von Peeperkorn, aus der Flasche vom Nachttisch. Unter Umständen, wie den heutigen, meinte der Holländer, sei es das beste, da wieder anzu{873}schließen, wo man nachts zuvor aufgehört habe, und dieser Spritzige tue ja dieselben Dienste wie Sodawasser. Er stieß mit Hans Castorp an, und dieser sah trinkend zu, wie die sommersprossig-nagelspitze Kapitänshand dort drüben, von dem Knopfbunde des wollenen Hemdes am Gelenke umspannt, das Glas emporführte, wie die breiten, zerrissenen Lippen seinen Rand erfaßten und der Wein durch die auf- und niedersteigende Arbeiter- oder Büstengurgel trieb. Sie sprachen dann noch über das Medikament auf dem Nachttisch, diesen braunen Saft, von dem Peeperkorn auf Frau Chauchats Mahnung und aus ihrer Hand einen Löffel voll einnahm, – es war ein Antipyretikum, Chinin im wesentlichen; Peeperkorn gab seinem Gast ein wenig davon zu probieren, um ihn den charaktervollen, bitter-würzigen Geschmack des Präparats erfahren zu lassen, und äußerte dann mehreres zum Lobe des Chinins, das segensreich nicht nur durch seine keimzerstörende Wirkung und seinen heilsamen Einfluß auf das Wärmezentrum sei, sondern auch als Tonikum gewürdigt werden müsse: es vermindere den Eiweißumsatz, fördere den Ernährungszustand, kurz, sei ein echter Labetrank, ein herrliches Stärkungs-, Erweckungs- und Belebungsmittel, – ein Rauschmittel übrigens ebenfalls; man könne sich leicht einen kleinen Spitz oder Zopf daran trinken, sagte er, indem er wie gestern mit Fingern und Kopf großartig scherzte und wieder dem tanzenden Heidenpriester dabei glich.","He was poured a glass of wine by Peeperkorn, from the bottle on the bedside table. In circumstances like today's, the Dutchman said, it was best to pick up where you left off last night, and this fizzy one does the same job as soda water. He clinked glasses with Hans Castorp, and the latter watched, drinking, as the freckled, nail-pointed captain's hand over there, clasped by the button band of the woolen shirt at the wrist, raised the glass, how the broad, torn lips grasped the rim and the wine through the ascending and descending worker or bust throat drove. They then talked about the drug on the bedside table, that brown juice which Peeperkorn took a spoonful of from Mrs. Chauchat's reminder and from her hand - it was an antipyretic, quinine essentially; Peeperkorn gave his guest a little taste of it so that he could experience the distinctive, bitter-spicy taste of the preparation, and then made several comments in praise of quinine, which was beneficial not only because of its germ-destroying effect and its healing influence on the heat center , but also has to be appreciated as a tonic: it reduces the protein turnover, promotes the nutritional status, in short, is a real refreshment drink, a wonderful tonic, awakening and invigorating agent - an intoxicant, by the way, too; it was easy to drink a little bit or a plait from it, he said, while like yesterday he was joking with his fingers and head and again resembled the dancing heathen priest.","Peeperkorn poured him out a glass of wine from the bottle on the night-table. Under the circumstances the best thing, in the Dutchman’s opinion, was to begin where one had left off; and that innocent effervescent wine had the same effect as soda-water. They touched glasses. Hans Castorp, as he drank, looked at the freckled, sea-captain’s hand, with its pointed nails, the woollen band buttoned round the wrist. It took up the glass, carried it to the thick, cracked lips; the throat, so like a statue’s and yet rather like a day labourer’s, worked up and down as it swallowed the wine. Peeperkorn indicated the medicine bottle on the table, a brown liquid, of which he took a spoonful from Frau Chauchat’s hand. It was an antipyretic, chiefly quinine, he baid. He made his guest try its characteristic bitter and pungent taste; and had much to say in praise of the wonderworking, germ-destroying properties of the drug, its tonic quality, its wholesome effect in regulating the temperature. It slowed down protein catabolism, promoted assimilation, in short it was a boon to mankind, a wonderful cordial, tonic and stimulant—an intoxicant as well, for one could get quite tipsy on it, he said, making the last night’s suggestive gesture of fingers and head like a pagan priest at his ritual dance.","Peeperkorn offered him a glass of wine from the bottle on the nightstand. Under such circumstances, the Dutchman remarked, the best thing was to pick up where one had left off the night before, and this sparkling wine had the same good effect as soda water. He touched glasses with Hans Castorp, who as he sipped watched the freckled, lance-nailed captain’s hand, the woolen shin buttoned just above its wrist, lift the glass to the broad, ragged lips that now formed around the rim and toss the wine down the bouncing workingman’s, or sculptured bust’s, gullet. They then spoke about the medicine on the nightstand, a brown liquid, from which Peeperkorn took the spoonful Frau Chauchat urged upon him. It was an antipyretic, mainly quinine. The Dutchman gave his guest a little sample, just so he could experience its rich, bitter, spicy taste; and he went on to praise quinine at some length, because its beneficial effects were not limited simply to destroying germs and regulating body temperature, but it also deserved to be celebrated as a tonic that retarded the metabolism of protein and enhanced one’s appetite. In short, it was a true regaling cordial, a splendid drink that invigorated, stimulated, and quickened the system—an intoxicating drug, as well, by the way; one could very easily get a little tipsy and mellow from it, he said, gesturing with both fingers and head as he had the night before in the grand jocular fashion that made him resemble a dancing heathen priest."
"Die Spaziergänger hatten die Wegbiegung schon wieder zurückgelegt. War es den Reden Settembrinis, dem Gefälle der Straße zu danken, oder hatten sie sich in Wahrheit weniger weit vom Sanatorium entfernt, als Hans Castorp geglaubt hatte, – denn ein Weg, den wir zum ersten Male gehen, ist bedeutend länger als derselbe, wenn wir ihn schon kennen –: jedenfalls war der Rückmarsch überraschend geschwind vonstatten gegangen. Settembrini hatte recht, es war das Ärztepaar, das dort unten auf dem freien Platz die Rückseite des Sanatoriums entlang strebte, voran der Hofrat im weißen Kittel, mit heraustretendem Genick und die Hände wie Ruder bewegend, auf seiner Fährte Dr. Krokowski im schwarzen Überhemd und desto selbstbewußter um sich blickend, als der klinische Brauch ihn nötigte, sich auf Dienstgängen hinter dem Chef zu halten.","The walkers had already rounded the bend in the path again. Was it Settembrini's speeches that were due to the slope of the road, or were they actually less far from the sanatorium than Hans Castorp had believed - because a path that we walk for the first time is significantly longer than the same when we already know him -: in any case, the march back was surprisingly quick. Settembrini was right, it was the couple of doctors who were striving along the back of the sanatorium down there in the open space, led by the privy councilor in a white coat, with his neck sticking out and moving his hands like oars, on his trail Dr. Krokowski in a black overshirt and looking around all the more confidently when clinical practice forced him to keep behind the boss on official trips.","The walkers had already put behind them the turn in the path. Whether thanks to Settembrini’s conversation, the fact that they were walking downhill, or merely that they were much nearer the sanatorium than Hans Castorp had thought—for a path is always longer the first time we traverse it—at all events, the return had been accomplished in a surprisingly short time. Settembrini was right, it was the two physicians who were walking along the free space at the back of the building; the Hofrat ahead, in his white smock, his neck stuck out and his hands moving like oars; on his heels the black-shirted Dr. Krokowski, who looked the more self-conscious that medical etiquette constrained him to walk behind his chief when they made their rounds together.","The hikers already had the hairpin turn behind them. Whether it was Settembrini’s conversation, the steepness of the path, or their not having left the sanatorium nearly so far behind them as Hans Castorp had thought—because a path always seems considerably longer when we first walk it than when we have come to know it—in any case, the return trip had taken a surprisingly short time. Settembrini was right: there were the two doctors striding across the open area at the back of the sanatorium—the director in his white smock leading the way, his head thrust forward, his hands rowing in the air; and in his wake, Dr. Krokowski, still in his black smock, looking about with an even more self-assured air, because clinical custom demanded he walk behind his supervisor as they made their rounds."
"»Ein ritterlicher und heiterer Mann,« wiederholte Peeperkorn, ohne auf die Bemerkung über Naphta einzugehen, »wenn auch – erlauben Sie mir diese Einschränkung – wenn {911}auch nicht ohne Vorurteile. Madame, meine Reisebegleiterin, schätzt ihn nicht sonderlich, wie Sie vielleicht bemerkt haben werden; sie äußert sich ohne Sympathie über ihn, zweifellos weil sie derartige Vorurteile aus seinem Verhalten gegen sie – Kein Wort, junger Mann. Ich bin weit entfernt, Herrn Settembrini und Ihren freundschaftlichen Empfindungen für ihn – Erledigt! Ich denke nicht daran, zu behaupten, daß er es je im Punkte jener Artigkeit, die ein Kavalier einer Dame – Perfekt, lieber Freund, durchaus einwandfrei! Allein es ist da doch eine Grenze, eine Zurückhaltung, eine gewisse Re–ku–sa–tion, die Madames Stimmung gegen ihn menschlich in hohem Grade –«","'A gallant and gay man,' repeated Peeperkorn, ignoring the remark about naphtha, 'though - allow me this qualification - though {911}not without prejudice. Madame, my traveling companion, does not like him very much, as you may have noticed; she expresses no sympathy for him, doubtless deriving such prejudice from his conduct towards her— Not a word, young man. I'm a long way from Mr Settembrini and your friendly feelings for him - Done! I have no intention of claiming that he was ever in the point of that politeness which a cavalier of a lady - Perfect, dear friend, absolutely impeccable! But there is a limit, a reserve, a certain re-cu-sa-tion, which in a highly human way makes Madame's mood towards him -""","“A chivalrous and affable gentleman,” repeated Peeperkorn, passing over Hans Castorp’s remarks about little Naphta. “But also—forgive me the reservation—not free from prejudice. Madame, my companion, has no great opinion of him—you may have seen. She feels little sympathy—no doubt because she perceives the same prejudice to exist toward herself. Not a word, young man. I am far from—comment on Herr Settembrini and your friendly feelings for him— No more! I should not think of saying that in any point—he has failed in any respect in knightly courtesy. My dear friend—irreproachable, very.

Madame, my traveling companion, is not especially fond of him, as you perhaps may have noticed; she expresses little sympathy for him, doubtless because in his behavior toward her those very prejudices are in fact—not a word, young man. Far be it from me, as to Herr Settembrini and your friendly sentiments toward him—settled. I would not think of asserting that, in terms of the courtesy a cavalier owes a lady, he would ever—agreed, dear friend, absolutely unobjectionable. And yet there is a certain boundary, a reserve, a certain stand-off-ish-ness, which, humanly speaking, makes Madame’s feelings toward him eminently—”"
"Ein Trupp von Gästen beiderlei Geschlechtes kam ihm entgegen, – er hatte sie droben auf halber Höhe des Hanges den ebenen Weg entlang kommen sehen, jetzt stapften sie abwärts, gerade auf ihn zu und ließen ihre verschiedenartigen Stimmen ertönen. Es waren sechs oder sieben Personen gemischten Alters, die einen blutjung, ein paar schon etwas weiter an Jahren. Er sah sie sich an mit seitwärts geneigtem Kopfe, während er an Joachim dachte. Sie waren barhaupt und braun, die Damen in farbigen Sweaters, die Herren meist ohne Überzieher und selbst ohne Stöcke, wie Leute, die ohne Umstände und die Hände in den Taschen ein paar Schritte vors Haus machen. Da sie bergab gingen, was keine ernsthaft tragende Anstrengung, sondern nur ein lustiges Bremsen und Anstemmen der Beine erfordert, damit man nicht ins Laufen und Stolpern gerät, ja eigentlich nichts weiter als ein Sichfallenlassen ist, hatte ihre Gangart etwas Beschwingtes und Leichtsinniges, was sich ihren Mienen, ihrer ganzen Erscheinung mitteilte, so daß man wohl wünschen konnte, zu ihnen zu gehören.","A troop of guests of both sexes met him--he had seen them coming up the level path halfway up the slope, now they trudged down straight towards him, raising their various voices. There were six or seven people of mixed ages, some very young, a few older. He looked at her with his head tilted sideways while he thought of Joachim. They were bareheaded and brown, the women in colored sweaters, the men mostly without overcoats and even without walking sticks, like people who take a few steps in front of the house without any fuss and with their hands in their pockets. Since they were going downhill, which requires no serious effort, but only a funny braking and bracing of the legs so that one does not run and stumble, in fact it is nothing more than letting oneself fall, there was something lively and reckless about their gait, which showed their expressions, their whole appearance, so that one could well wish to belong to them.","A troop of guests of both sexes approached him. He had seen them coming along the level path half-way up the slope; now they were stalking downhill directly towards him; he heard their voices. They were six or seven persons of various ages: some in the bloom of youth, others rather older. He took a good look at them, from the side, as he walked with bent head, thinking about Joachim. They were tanned and bareheaded, the women in sweaters, the men mostly without overcoats or even walkingsticks, all of them like people who have just gone casually out for a turn in the open. Going downhill involves no sustained muscular effort, only an agreeable process of putting on the brakes in order not to finish by running and tripping head over heels; it is really nothing more than just letting yourself go; and thus the gait of these people had something loose-jointed and flighty about it, which communicated itself to the appearance of the whole group and made one almost wish to be of their lively party.","A party of guests of both sexes was coming toward him—he had noticed them moving along a level stretch of path about halfway up the slope, and now they were tramping downhill, moving directly toward him, and he could hear the babble of voices. There were six or seven people of various ages, from very young things to a few who were somewhat further along in years. Still thinking about Joachim, he tilted his head and looked them over. They were all bareheaded and tanned, the ladies in colorful sweaters, the gentlemen without overcoats for the most part, even without walking sticks—they looked as if they had just stepped out the door for a breath of air, hands in their pockets. Since walking downhill is not a matter of strenuous exertion but more a sport, where you brace your legs and apply the brakes to keep from tripping or running—nothing more than helping yourself fall, really —there was a kind of nimble frivolity to their gait, which spread even to their faces, until the whole effect might very well have made you want to join their party."
"Hans Castorp hatte erwartet, daß Herr Naphta die Hinrichtung werde erhalten wissen wollen. Naphta, meinte er, war {694}wohl ebenso revolutionär wie Herr Settembrini, aber er sei es im erhaltenden Sinn, ein Revolutionär der Erhaltung.","Hans Castorp had expected that Herr Naphta would want the execution to go ahead. Naphta, he said, was just as revolutionary as M. Settembrini, but he was so in the conservation sense, a conservationist revolutionary.","Hans Castorp said he was not surpiseed to hear that Naphta favoured the death penalty. To his mind, Naphta was as revolutionary as Settembrini, only in a conservative direction—a reactionary revolutionist.","Hans Castorp said he had expected Herr Naphta would know how to react in defense of executions. Naphta, he continued, was certainly just as much a revolutionary as Herr Settembrini, but in a defensive, reactionary sense—he was a revolutionary of reaction."
"Auf jeden Fall stand der Oktober vor der Tür, jeden Tag konnte er eintreten. Es war ein leichtes für Hans Castorp, sich das auszurechnen, und außerdem wurde er durch Gespräche seiner Mitpatienten darauf hingewiesen, denen er zuhörte. »Wissen Sie, daß in fünf Tagen wieder einmal der Erste ist?« hörte er Hermine Kleefeld zu zwei jungen Herren ihrer Gesellschaft sagen, dem Studenten Rasmussen und jenem Wulstlippigen, dessen Name Gänser war. Man stand nach der Haupt{335}mahlzeit im Speisedunst zwischen den Tischen herum und zögerte plaudernd, in die Liegekur zu gehen. »Der erste Oktober, ich habe es in der Verwaltung auf dem Kalender gesehen. Das ist der zweite seiner Art, den ich an diesem Lustort verlebe. Schön, der Sommer ist hin, soweit er vorhanden war, man ist um ihn betrogen, wie man um das Leben betrogen ist, im ganzen und überhaupt.« Und sie seufzte aus ihrer halben Lunge, indem sie kopfschüttelnd ihre von Dummheit umschleierten Augen zur Decke richtete. »Lustig, Rasmussen!« sagte sie hierauf und schlug ihrem Kameraden auf die abfallende Schulter. »Machen Sie Witze!« »Ich weiß nur wenige«, erwiderte Rasmussen und ließ die Hände wie Flossen in Brusthöhe hängen; »die aber wollen mir nicht vonstatten gehn, ich bin immer so müde.« »Es möchte kein Hund,« sagte Gänser hinter den Zähnen, »so oder ähnlich noch viel länger leben.« Und sie lachten achselzuckend.","In any case, October was just around the corner, it could come any day. It was easy for Hans Castorp to figure that out, and it was also pointed out to him by conversations he listened to with fellow patients. ""Did you know that in five days there will be the first again?"" he heard Hermine Kleefeld say to two young men in her company, the student Rasmussen and the thick-lipped man whose name was Gänser. After the main {335}meal, people stood around between the tables in the haze and chattered, hesitating to go into the rest cure. 'The first of October, I saw it on the calendar in administration. This is the second of its kind that I've spent in this place of pleasure. Fine, the summer is over, as far as it existed, one has been cheated of it, as one has been cheated of life, on the whole.” And she sighed from the top of her lungs, shaking her head at the ceiling with her stupidly veiled eyes directed. 'Merry, Rasmussen!' she said, slapping her comrade on the declining shoulder. ""You're joking!"" ""I only know a few,"" Rasmussen replied, hands hanging like flippers at chest level; ""But they don't want to happen to me, I'm always so tired."" ""No dog would like to live much longer like that,"" said Gänser behind his teeth, ""or something like that."" And they laughed, shrugging their shoulders.","At all events October was before the door, it might enter any day. The calculation was an easy one for Hans Castorp to make, and he gathered the same result from the conversation of his fellow-patients. “Do you know that in five days it will be the first again?” he heard Hermine Kleefeld say to two of her familiars, the student Rasmussen and the thick-lipped young man, whose name was Gänser. It was after luncheon, and the guests lingered chatting in the dining-room, though the air was heavy with the odours of the meal just served, instead of going into the afternoon rest-cure. “The first of October, I saw it on the calendar in the office. That makes the second of its kind I’ve spent in the pleasure resort. Well, summer is over, in so far as there has been a summer, that is—it has really been a sell, like life in general.” She shook her head, fetched a sigh from her one lung, and rolled up to the ceiling her dull and stolid eyes. “Cheer up, Rasmussen,” she said, and slapped her comrade on the drooping shoulder. “Make a few jokes!” “I don’t know many,” he responded, letting his hands flap finlike before his breast, “and those I do I can’t tell, I’m so tired all the time.” “ ‘Not even a dog,’ ” Gänser said through his teeth, “ ‘would want to live longer’— if he had to live like this.” They laughed and shrugged their shoulders.","In any case, October was close at hand, might arrive any day now. Hans Castorp had no trouble figuring out that much; and besides, he heard mention made of the fact in the conversations of his fellow patients. “Do you realize that it’s only five days till the first of the month?” he heard Hermine Kleefeld say to two young men of her acquaintance, Rasmussen the student and the thick-lipped lad, whose name was Gänser. Dinner was just over, its odors still heavy in the air, and people were lingering among the tables, chatting and putting off their rest cure. “The first of October—I noticed it on the calendar in the management office. This will be the second one I’ve spent at this cozy resort. Well fine, summer, or what there was of it, is over—we’ve been cheated out of it, just as we’re cheated out of everything else in life.” And she sighed with her half a lung, shaking her head and directing her doltish, sleepy eyes at the ceiling. “Cheer up, Rasmussen,” she then said, slapping her comrade on one drooping shoulder, “and tell us some jokes!” “I know only a few,” Rasmussen replied, his hands dangling chest-high like fins. “But I don’t tell them very well —I’m always too tired.” “Not even a dog,” Gänser said between his teeth, “would want to go on living like this much longer.” And they laughed and shrugged."
"»Sie sind sehr duldsam gegen die Idee. Desto höflicher will ich Sie dahin berichtigen, daß die Kreuzzüge nebst der Verkehrsbelebung, die sie zeitigten, nichts weniger als international ausgleichend gewirkt haben, sondern im Gegenteil die Völker lehrten, sich voneinander zu unterscheiden und die Ausbildung der nationalen Staatsidee kräftig förderten.«","'You are very tolerant of the idea. I would like to correct you all the more politely that the Crusades, together with the traffic revival they brought about, had nothing less than an international balancing effect, but on the contrary taught the peoples to distinguish themselves from one another and vigorously promoted the development of the national idea of the state.«","“And how tolerant you always are towards an idea! I would the more courteously remind you that the effect of the Crusades and the economic relations they stimulated was anything but favourable to internationalism. On the contrary, they taught the peoples to become conscious of themselves, and thus furthered the development of the national idea.”","“You are suddenly very tolerant of that idea. And so, might I courteously remind you that, although the Crusades did stimulate international commerce, they did anything but bring about international reconciliation. On the contrary, they taught peoples to differentiate themselves one from the other and fostered the growth of the concept of the nation-state.”"
"»Ah, der Genius der Menschheit war auch in den großen ökonomischen Denkern jener Inseln lebendig! – Sie wollten sprechen, Ingenieur?«","'Ah, the genius of mankind was also alive in the great economic thinkers of those islands! ""You wanted to speak, Engineer?""","“Ah, the genius of humanity was alive in that island’s great economic thinkers too!—You wanted to say something Engineer?”","“Ah, but that same guardian angel was alive and working among the great economists of that island. You wanted to say something, my good engineer?”"
"Sie errötete; und mit wahrer Erleichterung, sie beschämt zu sehen, fing man an, sie im Chore zu schelten, als sie versicherte: Nein, nein, nicht so, man möge doch das nicht glauben! Nicht draußen, nicht an der Tür habe sie gehorcht, gewiß und wahrhaftig nicht!","She blushed; and with true relief at seeing her ashamed, they began to scold her in chorus as she assured her: No, no, not like that, one shouldn't believe it! Not outside, not at the door did she obey, certainly and truly not!","With a sense of relief at her embarrassment they began in chorus to chide her; but she assured them she had not blushed in that sense. She had not listened, not outside, not at the door, truly, truly she had not! Not outside, not at the door?","She blushed; and much relieved at seeing her embarrassment, they began to scold her in unison—until she assured them that no, no, no, they shouldn’t think such a thing of her. She had not been listening, not outside, not at the door, truly she hadn’t."
"Das war gut gezielt. Hans Castorps Gesicht verzerrte sich gegen alle Bemühung, und auch die auf »Was nicht gar« und »Sehe einer an« gestimmten Redensarten, mit denen er die Eröffnung zu behandeln versuchte, waren verzerrt. Unfähig, das Vorhandensein dieses Landsmannes auf die leichte Achsel zu nehmen, wie er sich anfangs den Anschein hatte geben wollen, kam er mit zuckenden Lippen beständig auf ihn zurück. Ein jüngerer Mann? – Jung und ansehnlich, nach allem, was sie höre, erwiderte die Lehrerin; denn nach eigenem Augenschein konnte sie nicht urteilen. – Krank? – Höchstens leichtkrank! – Er wolle hoffen, sagte Hans Castorp höhnisch, daß mehr Wäsche an ihm zu sehen sei als bei den Landsleuten am Schlechten Russentisch, – wofür die Engelhart, noch immer zur Strafe, einstehen zu wollen erklärte. Da gab er zu, es sei eine Angelegenheit, um die man sich kümmern müsse, und be{317}auftragte sie ernstlich, in Erfahrung zu bringen, was es mit diesem aus und ein gehenden Landsmann auf sich habe. Statt ihm aber Nachrichten hierüber zu bringen, wußte sie einige Tage später etwas völlig Neues.","That was well aimed. Hans Castorp's face twisted against all effort, and the phrases he tried to use to cover the opening, which were geared towards ""Wasn't at all"" and ""Look at it,"" were also distorted. Unable to take the countryman's presence lightly, as he had at first wanted to seem, he kept coming back to him, lips twitching. A younger man? -Young and handsome, after all she heard, replied the teacher; for she could not judge by her own eyes. - Ill? – At most slightly ill! - He wanted to hope, said Hans Castorp scornfully, that there was more washing to be seen on him than at the bad Russian table among his compatriots - for which Engelhart, still as a punishment, declared that she wanted to take responsibility. Then he admitted that it was a matter to be taken care of, and charged them earnestly with finding out what was going on with this countryman who was going in and out. But instead of bringing him news about this, a few days later she knew something completely new.","It was a good shot. Hans Castorp’s face changed in spite of himself; he tried to react, saying: “ Well, well! You don’t say so!” but the words sounded strained. He was incapable of treating lightly the existence of this fellow-countryman of Frau Chauchat, much as he wished to appear to do so, and came back to it again and again, his lips twitching. A young man? Young and good-looking, according to all accounts, the schoolmistress answered; she could not say from her own observation. Was he ill? Only a light case, at most. “Let us hope,” Hans Castorp remarked with scorn, “that he displays more linen than the other two, at the ‘bad’ Russian table.” Fräulein Engelhart, on punishment intent, said she could vouch for that. He gave in, and admitted that it was a matter for concern. He earnestly charged her to find out all she could about this young man who came and went between the Platz and Frau Chauchat’s room. A few days later she brought him, not information about the young Russian, but a fresh and startling piece of news.","The shot was well aimed. Despite everything he could do, Hans Castorp’s face looked strained, and even phrases like “you don’t say” and “well, I never,” with which he tried to parry her opening move, sounded strained. Incapable of simply shrugging off the existence of this fellow countryman as he pretended to do at first, he kept returning to the topic. With twitching lips he asked: A younger man? Young and attractive, from everything she had heard, the teacher replied, although she hadn’t actually seen him to judge for herself. Ill? At most, a very mild case. Well, he did hope, Hans Castorp said, that collars and cuffs were more in evidence with him than with her fellow countrymen at the Bad Russian table. And still intent on punishing him, Fräulein Engelhart claimed she was sure they were. Then he admitted that it was a matter that one should look into and earnestly commissioned her to find out what could be found out about the comings and goings of this fellow countryman. But several days later, instead of providing him with more information, she had other, completely different news for him."
"War das der Winter? Die Sinne konnten sich diesem Eindruck nicht entziehen, und man klagte, man sei »um den Sommer betrogen«, obgleich man, unterstützt von natürlichen und künstlichen Umständen, durch einen innerlich wie äußerlich verschwenderischen Zeitverbrauch sich selber um ihn betrogen hatte. Die Vernunft wollte wissen, daß noch schöne Herbsttage folgen würden; vielleicht sogar serienweise würden sie erscheinen und in so warmer Pracht, daß ihnen mit dem Namen des Sommers nicht zuviel Ehre würde angetan werden, vorausgesetzt, daß man sich den schon flacheren Tageslauf der Sonne, ihren schon zeitigen Abschied aus dem Sinne schlug. Aber die Wirkung auf das Gemüt, die der Anblick der Winterlandschaft draußen hervorbrachte, war stärker als solche Tröstungen. Man stand an seiner geschlossenen Balkontür und starrte mit Ekel hinaus in das Gestöber, – Joachim war es, der so stand, und mit gepreßter Stimme sagte er:","Was that the winter? The senses could not escape this impression, and one complained that one had been ""cheated of the summer,"" although, supported by natural and artificial circumstances, one had cheated oneself of it by wasting time both internally and externally. Reason wanted to know that beautiful autumn days would follow; perhaps even in series they would appear, and in such warm splendor that the name of summer would not do them too much honor, provided that one put the already flattening course of the sun, its early farewell, out of mind. But the effect on the mind of the sight of the winter landscape outside was stronger than such consolations. One stood at his closed balcony door and stared out at the storm with disgust - it was Joachim who stood like that, and with a strained voice he said:","Was it winter again? Almost the senses thought so. On every hand were loud complaints, that they had been cheated out of their summer; though they had really cheated themselves, abetted by conditions both natural and artificial, and by a consumption of time-units reckless alike within and without. Reason was aware that fine autumnal weather was certain to follow, there would be a succession of brilliant days each outvying the other, and so fine that one might still honour them with the name of summer, save for the flatter arc the sun made in its course, and its earlier setting. But the effect of the winter landscape on the spirit was stronger than the power of such consolatory thoughts. The cousins would stand at the closed door into the balcony, and look out with loathing into the whirl of flakes—it was Joachim who stood thus, and in a suppressed voice he said: “So that’s to begin all over again, is it?”","Was this winter? The senses could not avoid that conclusion, and people complained that they had been “cheated out of summer”—although, abetted by natural and artificial circumstances, people had cheated themselves out of it by squandering both internal and external time. Reason tried to tell them beautiful autumn days would follow, a whole succession of days so warm and splendid that they might very well deserve the honor of being called summer—that is, if one ignored the sun’s crossing the sky lower and setting earlier each day. But the effect of the winter landscape on the general mood was stronger than any such consolation. You stood at your closed balcony door and stared with disgust at the squalls and flurries—just as Joachim was standing there now."
"»Mein Vater,« sagte er gedehnt und schwärmerisch, – »er war ein so feiner Mann, – empfindlich am Körper wie an der Seele! Wie liebte er im Winter sein kleines, warmes Studierstübchen, von Herzen liebte er es, stets mußten zwanzig Grad Réaumur darin herrschen, vermöge eines rotglühenden Öfchens, und wenn man an naßkalten Tagen oder an solchen, wenn der schneidende Tramontanawind ging, vom Flure des Häuschens her eintrat, so legte die Wärme sich einem wie ein linder Mantel um die Schultern, und die Augen füllten sich mit wohligen Tränen. Vollgepfropft war das Stübchen mit Büchern und Handschriften, worunter sich große Kostbarkeiten befanden, und zwischen den Geistesschätzen stand er in seinem Schlafrock aus blauem Flanell am schmalen Pult und widmete sich der Literatur, – zierlich und klein von Person, einen guten Kopf kleiner als ich, stellen Sie sich vor! aber mit dicken Büscheln aus grauem Haar an den Schläfen und einer Nase, so lang und fein … Welch ein Romanist, meine Herren! Einer der Ersten seiner Zeit, ein Kenner unserer Sprache wie wenige, ein lateinischer Stilist wie sonst keiner mehr, ein uomo letterato nach Boccaccios Herzen … Von weither kamen die Gelehrten, um sich mit ihm zu besprechen, der eine aus Haparanda, ein anderer aus Krakau, sie kamen ausdrücklich nach Padua, unserer Stadt, um ihm Hochachtung zu erweisen, und er empfing sie mit freundlicher Würde. Auch ein Dichter von Distinktion war er, welcher in seinen Mußestunden Erzählungen in der ele{148}gantesten toskanischen Prosa verfaßte, – ein Meister des idioma gentile«, sagte Settembrini mit äußerstem Genuß, indem er die heimatlichen Silben langsam auf der Zunge zergehen ließ und den Kopf dabei hin und her bewegte. »Sein Gärtchen baute er nach dem Beispiele Vergils,« fuhr er fort, »und was er sprach, war gesund und schön. Aber warm, warm mußte er es haben in seinem Stübchen, sonst zitterte er und konnte wohl Tränen vergießen vor Ärger, daß man ihn frieren ließ. Und nun stellen Sie sich vor, Ingenieur, und Sie, Leutnant, was ich, der Sohn meines Vaters, an diesem verdammten und barbarischen Orte leiden muß, wo der Körper im hohen Sommer vor Kälte zittert und erniedrigende Eindrücke beständig die Seele foltern! Ach, es ist hart! Welche Typen, die uns umgeben! Dieser närrische Teufelsknecht von Hofrat. Krokowski« – und Settembrini tat, als müsse er sich die Zunge zerbrechen – »Krokowski, dieser schamlose Beichtvater, der mich haßt, weil meine Menschenwürde mir verbietet, mich zu seinem pfäffischen Unwesen herzugeben … Und an meinem Tische … Welche Gesellschaft, in der ich zu speisen gezwungen bin! Zu meiner Rechten sitzt ein Bierbrauer aus Halle – Magnus ist sein Name – mit einem Schnurrbart, der einem Heubündel ähnelt. ›Lassen Sie mich mit der Literatur in Ruhe!‹ sagt er. ›Was bietet sie? Schöne Charaktere! Was fang ich mit schönen Charakteren an! Ich bin ein praktischer Mann, und schöne Charaktere kommen im Leben fast gar nicht vor.‹ Dies ist die Vorstellung, die er sich von der Literatur gebildet hat. Schöne Charaktere … o Mutter Gottes! Seine Frau, ihm gegenüber, sitzt da und verliert Eiweiß, während sie mehr und mehr in Stumpfsinn versinkt. Es ist ein schmutziger Jammer …«","""My father,"" he said slowly and enthusiastically - ""he was such a fine man - sensitive in body as in soul! How he loved his small, warm study room in winter, he loved it with all his heart, it had to be twenty degrees Réaumur in it at all times, thanks to a red-hot stove, and when you came down from the hall of the little house on wet, cold days or on such days when the biting Tramontana wind was blowing came in, the warmth wrapped itself around one's shoulders like a gentle cloak, and one's eyes filled with pleasant tears. The little room was crammed with books and manuscripts, among which were great treasures, and among the spiritual treasures he stood in his blue flannel dressing gown at the narrow desk and devoted himself to literature - petite and small in person, a good head smaller than me, imagine! but with thick tufts of gray hair at the temples, and a nose so long and delicate... What a Romanist, gentlemen! One of the first of his time, a connoisseur of our language like few, a Latin stylist like no other, a uomo letterato after Boccaccio's heart ... Scholars came from far away to talk to him, one from Haparanda, another from Kraków , they came expressly to Padua, our city, to pay him respect, and he received them with kind dignity. He was also a poet of distinction, who in his leisure hours wrote tales in the most elegant Tuscan prose - a master of the idioma gentile,' said Settembrini with extreme pleasure, slowly letting the native syllables melt on his tongue and moving his head back and forth. ""He built his little garden after the example of Virgil,"" he continued, ""and what he spoke was wholesome and beautiful. But he had to have it warm, warm in his little room, otherwise he would tremble and might well shed tears of anger at being left to freeze. And now imagine, Engineer, and you, Lieutenant, what I, my father's son, must suffer in this damned and barbaric place, where in the height of summer the body trembles with cold and humiliating impressions constantly torment the soul! Ah, it's hard! What guys that surround us! That foolish servant of the devil from Hofrat. Krokowski"" - and Settembrini pretended to break his tongue - ""Krokowski, that shameless confessor who hates me because my human dignity forbids me to join in his priestly mischief... And at my table... What society in which I forced to eat! To my right sits a brewer from Halle - Magnus is his name - with a mustache resembling a haystack. ›Leave me alone with literature!‹ he says. ›What does she offer? Beautiful characters! What do I do with beautiful characters! I am a practical man, and beautiful characters are scarcely found in life.' This is the idea he has formed of literature. Beautiful characters... O Mother of God! His wife, across from him, sits and loses protein as she sinks more and more into dullness. It's a filthy pity...""","“My father,” he said slowly, in tones replete with filial piety, “my father was a most delicately organized man, sensitive in body as in soul. How he did love his tiny, warm little study! In winter a temperature of twenty degrees Réaumur must always obtain there, by means of a small red-hot stove. When you entered it from the corridor on a day of cold and damp, or when the cutting tramontana blew, the warmth of it laid itself about you like a shawl, so that for very pleasure your eyes would fill with tears. The little room was stuffed with books and manuscripts, some of them of great value; he stood among them, at his narrow desk, in his blue flannel night-shirt, and devoted himself to the service of letters. He was small and delicately built, a good head shorter than I— imagine!—but with great tufts of grey hair on his temples, and a nose—how long and pointed it was! And what a Romanist, my friends! One of the first of his time, with a rare mastery of our own tongue, and a Latin stylist such as no longer exists—ah, a ‘ uomo letterato’ after Boccaccio’s own heart! From far and wide scholars came to converse with him—one from Haparanda, another from Cracow— they came to our city of Padua, expressly to pay him homage, and he received them with dignified friendliness. He was a poet of distinction too, composing in his leisure tales in the most elegant Tuscan prose—he was a master of the idioma gentile,” Settembrini said, rolling his native syllables with the utmost relish on his tongue and turning his head from side to side. “He laid out his little garden after Virgil’s own plan—and all that he said was sane and beautiful. But warm, warm he must have it in his little room; otherwise he would tremble with cold, and he could weep with anger if they let him freeze. And now imagine, Engineer, and you, Lieutenant, what I, the son of my father, must suffer in this accursed and barbarous land, where even at summer’s height the body shakes with cold, and the spirit is tortured and debased by the sights it sees.—Oh, it is hard! What types about us! This frantic devil of a Hofrat, Krokowski”—Settembrini pretended to trip over the name—“Krokowski, the fatherconfessor, who hates me because I’ve too much human dignity to lend myself to his papish practices.—And at my table—what sort of society is that in which I am forced to take my food? At my right sits a brewer from Halle—Magnus by name—with a moustache like a bundle of hay. ‘Don’t talk to me about literature,’ says he. ‘What has it to offer? Anything but beautiful characters? What have I to do with beautiful characters? I am a practical man, and in life I come into contact with precious few.’ That is the idea he has of literature—beautiful characters! Mother of God! His wife sits there opposite him, losing flesh all the time, and sinking further and further into idiocy. It is a filthy shame.”","“My father,” he said, protracting the words with relish, “was such a refined man, sensitive equally in body and soul! How he loved his warm little study in winter, loved it with all his heart, and demanded that the temperature be kept at a constant seventy-seven degrees, by means of a little stove that glowed warm and red. And on cold damp days, or those on which the biting tramontana was blowing, one would enter the room from the hallway of his cottage—and warmth draped itself about one’s shoulders like a soft cape, and one’s eyes filled with happy tears. His study was crammed full with books and manuscripts, rarest treasures among them; there he stood dressed in his blue flannel dressing gown, behind a little lectern, and amid all those intellectual riches, he abandoned himself to literature. A short, slight man, a good head shorter even than I, just imagine! With great tufts of gray hair at his temples—and with a long, finely chiseled nose. What a scholar of Romance letters, gentlemen. One of the finest of the age, a master of our tongue, few could match him, and a stylist in Latin, the like of which there is none today, a uomo letterato to warm Boccaccio’s heart. Learned men came from far and wide to consult with him, from Haparanda and from Krakow, expressly to visit Padua, our town, and pay their respects—and were received with cordial dignity. He was likewise a poet of distinction, who in his leisure hours penned narratives in the most elegant Tuscan prose—a virtuoso in the idioma gentile,” Settembrini said, rocking his head back and forth and taking utmost pleasure in letting the native syllables melt on his tongue. “He designed his little garden after Virgil’s models,” he continued, “and his words were robust and beautiful. But it had to be warm, warm in his study, otherwise he would shiver and could weep tears of rage if anyone allowed him to freeze. And now just imagine, my good engineer, and you my fine lieutenant, what I, the son of such a father, must suffer in this damnable and barbaric place, where my body shivers with cold at the height of summer, even as my soul is constantly tortured by debasing sights. Ah, it is hard, surrounded by such creatures. Our director, the Hofrat, a buffoon, an imp of Satan. And Krokowski”—and Settembrini pretended the name was a tongue twister—“Krokowski, our shameless father confessor, who hates me because my dignity as a man will not permit me to subject myself to his monkish excesses. And then at my table—the society in which I am forced to dine! To my right sits a brewer from Halle, Magnus is his name, with a moustache like a wisp of straw. ‘You can forget the literature,’ he says. ‘What’s in it for me? Beautiful characters. What am I supposed to do with beautiful characters? I’m a practical man, and beautiful characters almost never occur in real life.’ That’s his notion of literature. Beautiful characters . . . O Mother of God! His wife sits across from him, sits there and wastes away, losing protein and sinking deeper and deeper into dim-wittedness. It is a filthy, wretched state of affairs . . .”"
"Hans Castorp blickte nicht auf. Gebeugt und angelegentlich beschäftigte er sich mit den roten Flecken auf dem Laken. »Dahin mußte es kommen!« dachte er. »Darauf wollte es hinaus. Ich habe, glaube ich, selber das Meine getan, damit es darauf hinausliefe. Ich habe es in gewissem Grade darauf angelegt, wie mir in diesem Augenblick bewußt wird. Bin ich wahrhaftig so blaß geworden? Es kann wohl sein, denn nun geht es auf Biegen und Brechen. Man weiß nicht, was geschieht. Kann ich noch lügen? Es ginge wohl, doch will ichs gar nicht. Ich bleibe vorderhand bei diesen Blutflecken, Rotweinflecken hier im Laken.«","Hans Castorp didn't look up. Bent over, he busied himself with the red stains on the sheet. ""It had to come to that!"" he thought. 'That's the point. I think I did what was mine myself so that it would come to this. To a certain extent, I designed it based on what I'm realizing in this moment. Have I really turned so pale? It may well be, because now it's a matter of hook or by crook. You don't know what's happening. can i still lie It would work, but I don't want it at all. I'll stick to these bloodstains for now, red wine stains here on the sheet.""","Hans Castorp did not look up. He bent over and busied himself with the red stains on the sheet. “It had to come to that, I suppose,” he thought. “It had to come out.— And I suppose I even helped it on myself. I can see that now. Did I really go pale? It may be. For now we’ve certainly come to grips. What will happen? Shall I keep on lying? It might still go—but I won’t. I’ll just sit tight a few minutes and look at these blood-stains— I mean wine-stains—on the sheet.”","Hans Castorp did not look up. He was bent over, engrossed in the problem of the red stains on the sheets. “It was bound to come to this,” he thought. “That is what he was aiming for. I have even done my share, I’m afraid, to bring it to this. I’ve been plotting it to some extent, though that has only become clear to me at this moment. Am I really so pale? It may be—well, this is the critical moment. No way of knowing what will happen. Can I still lie? It probably wouldn’t work—and I don’t even want to. For now, I’ll just stick with these bloodstains, red wine stains here on the sheet.”"
"»Na, her mit der Konduite!« antwortete der Hofrat auf Joachims Entschuldigungen und nahm ihm die Fieberkurve aus der Hand, um sie durchzusehen, während der Patient sich beeilte, seinen Oberkörper freizumachen und die abgelegten Kleidungsstücke an den neben der Tür stehenden Garderobeständer zu hängen. Um Hans Castorp kümmerte man sich nicht. Er stand eine Weile zuschauend und ließ sich später auf einem altmodischen kleinen Fauteuil mit Troddeln an den Armlehnen zur Seite eines Tischchens mit Wasserkaraffe nieder. Bücherschränke mit breitrückigen medizinischen Werken und Aktenfaszikeln standen an den Wänden. An Möbeln war sonst nur noch eine mit weißem Wachstuch überzogene, höher und niedriger zu kurbelnde Chaiselongue vorhanden, über deren Kopfpolster eine Papierserviette gebreitet war.","""Well, bring me the conduit!"" replied the privy councilor to Joachim's apologies and took the temperature chart from him to look through it while the patient hurried to free his upper body and hang the discarded clothes on the coat rack by the door . Nobody bothered about Hans Castorp. He stood watching for a while and later sat down on an old-fashioned little armchair with tasseled armrests at the side of a small table with a water carafe. Bookcases with broad-backed medical works and filing cabinets lined the walls. The only furniture left was a chaise longue covered with white oilcloth, which could be cranked up and down, and a paper serviette spread over the headrest.","“Well, give us your report card,” the Hofrat answered to Joachim’s apologies, and took the fever chart out of his hand. He looked it over, while the patient made haste to lay off his upper garments down to the waist and hang them on the rack by the door. No one troubled about Hans Castorp. He looked on awhile standing, then let himself down in a little old-fashioned easy-chair with bob-tassels on the arms, beside a small table with a carafe on it. Bookcases lined the walls, full of pamphlets and broadbacked medical works. Other furniture there was none, except an adjustable chaiselongue covered with oilcloth. It had a paper serviette spread over the pillow.","“Well, hand over your report card,” the director said in reply to Joachim’s apologies. He accepted the temperature chart and looked it over while his patient quickly undressed above the waist and hung his garments on a clothes stand next to the door. No one paid attention to Hans Castorp. He stood there awhile, watching, but then sat down in an old-fashioned easy chair that had tassels on the arms and was placed next to a table with a carafe of water. Along the walls were bookcases filled with broad-spined medical works and bundles of records. There was no other furniture apart from a chaise longue, which could be cranked up or down and was covered with white oilcloth, except for a paper towel laid over the headrest."

"Namentlich Joachim fand sich einigermaßen beruhigt und aufgeklärt über seines Vetters befremdende Neugier durch diese Erläuterung, – und mehr für ihn, als für den Hofrat, hatte Hans Castorp sich denn auch auf seine eigenen künstlerischen Versuche berufen. Sie langten an: es gab kein so prächtiges, von Laternen flankiertes Portal an dieser Seite wie drüben an der Auffahrt. Ein paar gerundete Stufen führten zu der eichenen Haustür empor, die der Hofrat mit einem Drücker seines reichhaltigen Schlüsselbundes öffnete. Seine Hand zitterte dabei; entschieden war er nervös. Ein Vorraum, als Garderobe ausgestattet, nahm sie auf, wo Behrens seinen steifen Hut an den Nagel hing. Drinnen, auf dem kurzen, vom allgemeinen Teil des Gebäudes durch eine Glastür abgetrennten Korridor, an dessen beiden Seiten die Räumlichkeiten der kleinen Privatwohnung lagen, rief er nach dem Dienstmädchen und machte seine Bestellung. Dann ließ er seine Gäste unter jovialen und ermutigenden Redensarten eintreten, – durch eine der Türen zur Rechten.","Joachim, in particular, found himself somewhat reassured and enlightened about his cousin's strange curiosity by this explanation - and Hans Castorp referred to his own artistic experiments more for him than for the Hofrat. They arrived: there was no so magnificent portal flanked by lanterns on this side as yonder on the driveway. A few rounded steps led up to the oak front door, which the privy councilor opened with a push of his rich bunch of keys. His hand trembled; he was definitely nervous. An anteroom furnished as a cloakroom accommodated them, where Behrens hung up his bowler hat. Inside, in the short corridor separated from the general part of the building by a glass door, on either side of which lay the premises of the small private apartment, he called the maid and gave his order. Then, amid jovial and encouraging phrases, he admitted his guests--by one of the doors on the right.","Joachim in particular felt relieved and enlightened by this explanation of his cousin’s startling curiosity; it was in fact more on his account than on the Hofrat’s that Hans Castorp had offered it. They reached the entrance, a much simpler one than the impressive portal on the drive, with its flanking lanterns. A pair of curving steps led up to the oaken house door, which the Hofrat opened with a latch-key from his heavy bunch. His hand trembled, he was plainly in a nervous state. They entered an antechamber with clothes-racks, where Behrens hung his bowler on a hook, and thence passed into a short corridor, which was separated by a glass door from that of the main building. On both sides of this corridor lay the rooms of the small private dwelling. Behrens called a servant and gave an order; then to a running accompaniment of whimsical remarks ushered them through a door on the right.","Joachim, in particular, felt somewhat relieved and enlightened by his cousin’s explanation for his startling curiosity—and it was more for his sake than the director’s that Hans Castorp had called attention to his own attempts as an artist. They arrived—but here was no splendid portal flanked by lanterns like the one at the end of the driveway on the other side of the building. A few semicircular steps led up to an oaken door, which the director opened with a latchkey, one of many on his key ring. His hand trembled as he did it; he was definitely nervous. They entered a vestibule where you could hang your things, and Behrens placed his bowler on its hook. Once they were inside the short corridor, which opened on both sides to the rooms of his small private residence and was separated from the rest of the building by a glass-paned door, he called for the maid and placed his order. Then with several jovial phrases of encouragement, he admitted his guests through one of the doors on the right."
"Er hatte den Kopf voller Blut vom Schreiben, seine Backen brannten. Er nahm Merkurius vom Lampentischchen und maß sich, als gelte es, eine Gelegenheit zu benutzen. Merkurius stieg auf 37,8.","His head was full of blood from writing, his cheeks were burning. He took Mercury from the lamp-table and measured himself as if there was an opportunity to seize. Mercury rose to 37.8.","His head was hot with the blood that had gone to it as he wrote, his cheeks burned. He took the thermometer from his lamp-stand and “measured,” as though to make use of an opportunity. Mercurius had gone up to 100°.","Blood had rushed to his head as he wrote, his cheeks burned. He picked up Mercury from the nightstand and took his temperature, as if he could not let this opportunity pass. Mercury climbed to one hundred degrees."
"Hans Castorp lachte, – was Herr Settembrini niemals tat. Man konnte ihn sich herzlich lachend gar nicht vorstellen; über die feine und trockene Spannung seines Mundwinkels brachte er es nicht hinaus. Er sah dem jungen Manne beim Lachen zu und fragte dann:","Hans Castorp laughed - which Herr Settembrini never did. One could hardly imagine him laughing heartily; he couldn't get beyond the fine, dry tension of the corners of his mouth. He watched the young man laugh and then asked:","Hans Castorp laughed—a thing Herr Settembrini never did. One could not imagine him laughing heartily; he never got further than the fine, dry crisping of the corner of his mouth. He looked at the laughing young man, and presently asked: “Have you received your diapositive?”","Hans Castorp laughed—something Herr Settembrini never did. One could not even imagine his ever laughing heartily; he managed little more than a dry, delicate tightness at one corner of his mouth. He watched the young man laugh and then asked, “And the copy of your X-ray—have you received it?”"
"Hans Castorp stimmte dem bei. Er hatte eine Zigarette im Munde und die Hände in den Hosentaschen. So sah er zu, wie die kleine, muntere, alte russische Dame mit ihrer mageren Großnichte und zwei anderen Damen in einem Wagen Platz nahm; es waren Marusja und Madame Chauchat. Diese hatte einen dünnen Staubmantel, mit einem Gurt im Rücken, angelegt, war jedoch ohne Hut. Sie setzte sich neben die Alte in den Fond des Wagens, während die jungen Mädchen die Rückplätze einnahmen. Alle vier waren lustig und regten unauf{177}hörlich die Münder in ihrer weichen, gleichsam knochenlosen Sprache. Sie sprachen und lachten über die Wagendecke, in die sie sich unter Schwierigkeiten teilten, über das russische Konfekt, das die Großtante als Mundvorrat in einem mit Watte und Papierspitzen gepolsterten Holzkistchen mitführte und schon jetzt präsentierte … Hans Castorp unterschied mit Anteil Frau Chauchats verschleierte Stimme. Wie immer, wenn ihm die nachlässige Frau vor Augen kam, bekräftigte sich ihm aufs neue jene Ähnlichkeit, nach der er eine Weile gesucht hatte und die ihm im Traume aufgegangen war … Marusjas Lachen aber, der Anblick ihrer runden, braunen Augen, die kindlich über das Tüchlein hinwegblickten, womit sie den Mund bedeckte, und ihrer hohen Brust, die innerlich gar nicht wenig krank sein sollte, erinnerte ihn an etwas Anderes, Erschütterndes, was er neulich gesehen hatte, und so blickte er vorsichtig und ohne den Kopf zu bewegen zur Seite auf Joachim. Nein, gottlob, so fleckig im Gesicht sah Joachim nicht aus wie damals, und auch seine Lippen waren jetzt nicht so kläglich verzerrt. Aber er sah Marusja an – und zwar in einer Haltung, mit einem Augenausdruck, die unmöglich militärisch genannt werden konnten, vielmehr so trüb und selbstvergessen erschienen, daß man sie als ausgemacht zivilistisch ansprechen mußte. Dann raffte er sich übrigens zusammen und blickte rasch nach Hans Castorp, so daß dieser eben noch Zeit hatte, seine Augen von ihm fortzutun und sie irgendwohin in die Lüfte zu senden. Er fühlte sein Herz klopfen dabei, – unmotiviert und auf eigene Hand, wie es das hier nun einmal tat.","Hans Castorp agreed. He had a cigarette in his mouth and his hands in his pockets. So he watched as the lively little old Russian lady took her seat in a carriage with her thin grandniece and two other ladies; they were Marusja and Madame Chauchat. She had put on a thin duster's coat with a belt in the back, but was without a hat. She sat next to the old woman in the back of the car while the young girls took the back seats. All four were merry and incessantly moved their mouths in their soft, as it were boneless language. They talked and laughed about the carriage blanket, into which they had difficulty sharing, about the Russian confectionary that the great-aunt carried with her as a provision in a wooden box padded with cotton wool and paper points and was already presenting it... Hans Castorp shared Mrs. Chauchat's veiled voice. As always, when he saw the careless woman, the resemblance that he had been looking for for a while and that had dawned on him in his dreams was reaffirmed looking away at the handkerchief she was covering her mouth with, and her high breasts, which were supposed to be quite sick inside, reminded him of something else, shocking, what he had seen the other day, and so he looked cautiously and without moving his head Page on Joachim. No, thank God, Joachim's face didn't look as blotchy as it did then, and his lips weren't so pitifully distorted now either. But he looked at Marusya in an attitude, with an expression that could not possibly be called military, but seemed so bleak and self-absorbed that she had to be called quintessentially civilian. Then, by the way, he pulled himself together and looked quickly at Hans Castorp, so that he just had time to take his eyes off him and send them somewhere in the air. He felt his heart pounding - unmotivated and on his own, as it did here.","To which Hans Castorp agreed. He had a cigarette in his mouth, and his hands in his trouser pockets; and stood so to watch the lively little old Russian lady, as she, with her lean grand-niece and two other ladies, took their seats in a carriage. The ladies were Madame Chauchat and Marusja. Madame Chauchat had put on a thin dust-cloak belted in at the back, but wore no hat. She sat down beside the old dame in the body of the carriage, while the two girls took their places behind. All four were in lively vein and chattered without stopping in their soft, spineless tongue. They chattered about the top of the carriage, which was hard for them all to get underneath, about the Russian comfits the great-aunt had brought for them to munch, in a little wooden box lined with cotton-wool and lace paper, and was already handing round.— Hans Castorp distinguished with interest Frau Chauchat’s slightly husky voice. As always whenever he set eyes on that heedless creature, the likeness reasserted itself which had puzzled him for a while and then been revealed in a dream. But Marusja’s laugh, the expression of her round, brown eyes, staring childlike above the tiny handkerchief she held over her mouth, the full bosom, which was yet so ailing within, reminded him of something else, something which gave him a sudden thrill and made him glance cautiously at his cousin without turning his head. No, thank goodness, Joachim had not gone mottled, like that other time; his lips were not so painfully compressed. But he was gazing at Marusja, and his bearing, the expression in his eyes, was anything but military. Indeed that absorbed and yearning look could only have been characterized as typically civilian. However, he pulled himself quickly together and stole a glance at Hans Castorp, which the latter had only just time to avoid, by turning his own eyes away and staring up into the sky. He felt his heart give a sudden beat—without rhyme or reason, of its own accord, as it had taken to doing up here.","Hans Castorp agreed. He had a cigarette in his mouth and his hands in his trouser pockets. He watched as the chipper little old Russian lady and her skinny niece took their seats in the carriage and were joined by two other ladies—Marusya and Madame Chauchat. The latter was wearing a light duster, belted across the back, but no hat. She sat down next to the old woman at the front, with the two young girls on the backseat. All four were in a merry mood and their mouths worked ceaselessly at their soft, rather boneless language. They talked and laughed about the difficulty of fitting under the blanket, about the wooden box of Russian candies, wrapped in paper and bedded in cotton, which the great-aunt had brought along as provisions and now offered around. Hans Castorp was pleased to discover that he could pick out Frau Chauchat’s opaque voice. As always when he set eyes on this careless woman, he was reminded of the resemblance that he had been trying to recall for some time now and that had flashed across his dream. Marusya’s laugh, however, the sight of her round, brown eyes, blinking childishly out over the handkerchief with which she covered her mouth, and her full, prominent chest—said to be more than a little ill on the inside—reminded him of something else that had shaken him when he had noticed it recently, and so without turning his head, he glanced cautiously toward Joachim. No, thank God, Joachim’s face wasn’t turning blotchy as it had that day, and his lips were not in their woeful grimace. But he was watching Marusya—and in a pose, with a look in his eyes, that could not possibly be called military, but rather so gloomy and self-absorbed that one would have to term it downright civilian. He pulled himself together, all the same, and quickly peered at Hans Castorp, who just had time to pull his own eyes away and gaze off vaguely into the air. As he did, he felt his heart pounding—for no reason, all of its own accord, as it had taken to doing up here."
"»O nein, schon das drittemal. Und zwischendurch ist sie wieder wo anders, an ähnlichen Orten. – Umgekehrt, sie besucht ihn zuweilen, nicht oft, einmal im Jahre auf einige Zeit.

And I will be here, too, to make things as comfortable as possible for an officer and a gentleman.”"
"Hans Castorp dachte geringschätzig über den Kleinen, der sich geekelt hatte, und gab dieser Empfindung auch durch ein Achselzucken Ausdruck. Was ihn betraf, so ließ er sich den Weichmut des poetischen Halbknaben zum Ansporn in entgegengesetzter Richtung dienen und nahm Gelegenheit, der unglückseligen Frau von Mallinckrodt bei wiederholten Besuchen kleine Pflegerdienste zu leisten, zu denen keine Vorkenntnisse gehörten, das heißt: ihr behutsam den Mittagsbrei einzuführen, wenn er eben serviert wurde, ihr aus der Schnabeltasse zu trinken zu geben, wenn der Bissen ihr steckenblieb, oder ihr beim Umlagern im Bette behilflich zu sein; denn zu allem übrigen erschwerte eine Operationswunde ihr auch das Liegen. In diesen Handreichungen übte er sich, wenn er auf dem Wege zum Speisesaal oder von einem Spaziergange heimkehrend bei ihr einsprach, indem er Joachim aufforderte, immer voranzugehen, er wolle nur rasch den Fall auf Nummer fünfzig ein bißchen kontrollieren, – und empfand eine beglückende Ausdehnung seines Wesens dabei, eine Freude, die auf dem Gefühl von der Förderlichkeit und heimlichen Tragweite seines Tuns beruhte, sich übrigens auch mit einem gewissen diebischen Vergnügen an dem untadelig christlichen Gepräge dieses Tuns und Treibens mischte, einem so frommen, milden und lobenswerten Gepräge in der Tat, daß weder vom militärischen noch vom humanistisch-pädagogischen Standpunkte irgend etwas Ernstliches dagegen erinnert werden konnte.","Hans Castorp thought contemptuously of the little one, who was disgusted, and shrugged his shoulders to express his feelings. As for himself, he allowed the mellowness of the poetic half-boy to serve as a spur in the opposite direction, and took occasion, on repeated visits, to perform petty nursing services to the hapless Frau von Mallinckrodt, which required no prior knowledge, that is, to gently introduce her to the porridge , when it was just being served, to give her a drink from the sippy cup if the bite got stuck, or to help her turn in bed; because, on top of everything else, an operation wound made it difficult for her to lie down. He practiced these handouts when he talked to her on the way to the dining room or on returning home from a walk, asking Joachim to always go ahead, he just wanted to quickly check the case for number fifty a little - and felt a happy expansion of his nature, a joy that rested on the feeling of the usefulness and secret scope of his actions, which incidentally also mingled with a certain thieving pleasure in the impeccably Christian stamp of these doings and doings, such a pious, mild, and praiseworthy stamp in the deed that neither from the military nor from the humanistic-pedagogical point of view could anything serious be said against it.","Hans Castorp felt only contempt for the revolted lover and expressed it by a shoulder-shrug. The poetic youth’s defection was as a spur to himself and he began to take occasion to perform what services he could for the unhappy woman, in the repeated visits he made to her room: services that required no nursing skill, as, for instance, feeding her the midday broth after his own meal, giving her to drink when the food stuck in her throat, helping her to change her position in bed—for to add to everything else she had a wound from an operation, which made lying difficult. He practised himself in these acts of benevolence, looking in on her on his way to the dining-hall, or when returning from a walk, and telling Joachim to go on ahead, he would stop for a moment in number fifty, to see after a case; he experienced a pleasing sense of expanding being, the fruit of his conviction that what he did was both useful in itself and possessed of a secret significance. There was also a malicious satisfaction he had in the blamelessly Christian stamp his activities bore—it was so clear that on no ground whatever, either the military or the humanistic and pedagogic, were they open to any serious reproach.","Hans Castorp felt only disdain for the lad’s allowing himself to be repulsed, and he let his disdain be known with a shrug. The poetic adolescent’s delicacy only served to spur him to take the opposite course, to find occasion for paying frequent visits to unhappy Frau von Mallinckrodt and for performing little nursing services that required no special training. He would arrive, for instance, just in time carefully to spoon her midday porridge into her mouth, to help her drink from her spouted cup if a bite got stuck in her throat, or to assist her in shifting position in bed—for, in addition to all her other problems, an incision from an operation made it difficult for her to lie down. He performed these little services when he would drop by on his way to the dining hall or after a walk, telling Joachim to go on ahead, that he was just going to check quickly on the case in room 50; and each time he felt his whole being expand with a joy rooted in a sense of helpfulness and quiet importance, but intermingled with a certain jaunty delight in the spotless Christian impression his good deeds made—an impression so devout, caring, and praiseworthy, in fact, that no serious objections whatever could be raised against it, either from a military or a humanistic-pedagogic standpoint."
"»Tag«, sagte Joachim. »Das war ja nun deine erste Nacht hier oben. Bist du zufrieden?«","""Hello,"" said Joachim. 'So that was your first night up here. Are you satisfied?""","“MORNING,” Joachim said. “Well, that was your first night up here. How did you find it?”","“Hello,” Joachim said. “So that was your first night up here. Are you well satisfied?”"
"»Fiebrig, mein Lieber, fühle ich mich schon längst, schon die ganze Zeit. Aber jetzt handelt es sich nicht um subjektive Empfindungen, sondern um eine exakte Feststellung. Ich habe mich gemessen.«","'Feverish, my dear, I've been feeling for a long time, all the time. But now it is not a question of subjective sensations, but of an exact statement. I measured myself.«","Again Hans Castorp let him wait a little for the answer, then delivered himself airily as follows: “Feverish, my dear fellow, I have felt for a long time—all the time I have been up here, in fact. But at the moment it is not a matter of subjective emotion, but of fact. I have taken my temperature.”","Hans Castorp again waited awhile before answering, but then at last he said with a certain lethargy, “I’ve felt feverish for a long time now, my friend—almost the whole time. It’s no longer a matter of a subjective feeling now, but of precise evidence. I measured it.”"
"Und er ging weiter, in seinen ewig hell gewürfelten Hosen, und ließ im Rücken Hans Castorp, der »durchbohrt« sein sollte {537}von so viel Bedeutung und es gewissermaßen auch war, obgleich er, ärgerlich erheitert über die Zumutung, es zu sein, vor sich hin murmelte:","And he walked on, in his always brightly checked trousers, and left Hans Castorp behind him, who was supposed to be ""pierced"" {537} of so much importance and so to speak was, although he was angrily amused at the imposition of being so , murmuring to himself:","He passed on, in his everlasting check trousers, and left Hans Castorp behind, presumably, and to a certain extent actually, staggered by so much allusiveness; though he was stirred to irritation at its being taken for granted, and muttered through his teeth after the departing back: “Carducci-Latini-humani-spagheti— get along, do, and leave me in peace!” Yet he was at bottom sincerely glad to have the silence broken.","And he walked on, wearing those everlasting pastel checked trousers, leaving Hans Castorp behind, presumably “cut to the quick” by so much trenchant significance—and to some extent he was, although he was also vexed and amused by the notion that he was supposed to be."
"{950}»Wenn ich also sage: Streptos,« fing Behrens wieder an, »so dürfen Sie natürlich nicht an das bekannte schwere Krankheitsbild denken. Ob diese Kleinen von den Meinen sich überhaupt bei Ihnen angesiedelt haben, muß die baktereologische Blutuntersuchung zeigen. Aber ob Ihre Febrilität von ihnen herrührt, gesetzt, daß sie vorhanden sind, das lehrt dann erst die Wirkung der Streptovakzinkur, die wir diesfalls einzuleiten haben. Das ist der Weg, lieber Freund, und ich verspreche mir, wie gesagt, das Unvorhergesehenste davon. So langwierig Tuberkulose ist, so rasch können Erkrankungen dieser Art heute geheilt werden, und wenn Sie überhaupt auf die Einspritzungen reagieren, so sind Sie in sechs Wochen springgesund. Was sagen Sie nun? Ist der olle Behrens auf seinem Posten, he?«","{950}""So when I say: streptos,"" Behrens began again, ""you must of course not think of the well-known serious clinical picture. The bacteriologic blood test must show whether these little ones from mine have settled with you at all. But whether your febrile condition is due to them, assuming that they are present, only then will we know what effect the streptovaccine treatment we have to introduce in this case. This is the way, dear friend, and as I said, I expect the most unexpected of it. As long as tuberculosis is, diseases of this kind can be cured just as quickly today, and if you react at all to the injections, you will be perfectly healthy in six weeks. What do you say now? Old Behrens at his post, eh?”","“When I say streps,” Behrens began again, “you must not picture a well-known or severe type of illness. If this little one has really settled down and made itself at home in you, the bacteriological blood-test will show it. But whether it is really the cause of the fever—supposing it is present—that we can only tell from the effect of the streptovaccine treatment. This, my dear friend, is the technique, and I promise myself unheard-of results. Tuberculosis is the most long-winded thing in the world; but affections of this sort can be cured very quickly to-day; if you react to the inoculations, you will be as sound as a bell inside six weeks. Well, what do you say to that? That little ole Behrens has his head on his shoulders, what?”","“And so when I say ‘strep,’ ” Behrens began anew, “you should not picture the standard severe symptoms, of course. We will have to do a bacteriological’ blood test to see if these poor things but thine own have even taken up residence. But the only way we can learn whether strep is the cause of your febrility—always assuming that it is present—is to observe the effects of a strepto-vaccine therapy that we shall likewise inaugurate. That is the path before us, my good friend, and I repeat , it holds promise of great, quite unanticipated results. Recovery from infections of this sort can be as rapid as the cure for tuberculosis is protracted. And if you respond to these injections at all, you will be in the pink of health within six weeks. What do you say now? Has old man Behrens been holding up his end or not?”"
"Der Pianist, der sie begleitete, war ebenfalls ortsansässig … Frau Chauchat saß in der ersten Reihe, benutzte jedoch die Pause, um sich zurückzuziehen, so daß Hans Castorp von da an der Musik (es war Musik unter allen Umständen) mit ruhigem Herzen lauschen konnte, indem er während des Gesanges den Text der Lieder mitlas, der auf dem Programm gedruckt stand. Eine Weile saß Settembrini an seiner Seite, verschwand aber ebenfalls, nachdem er über den dumpfen bel canto der Ansässigen einiges Pralle, Plastische angemerkt und sein satirisches Behagen darüber ausgedrückt, daß man auch heute abend so treu und traulich unter sich sei. Die Wahrheit zu sagen, spürte Hans Castorp Erleichterung, als sie beide fort waren, die Schmaläugige und der Pädagog, und er in Freiheit den Liedern seine Aufmerksamkeit widmen konnte. Er fand es gut, daß in der ganzen Welt und noch unter den besondersten Umständen Musik gemacht wurde, wahrscheinlich sogar auf Polarexpeditionen.","The pianist who accompanied her was also local... Mrs. Chauchat sat in the front row but used the break to withdraw so that Hans Castorp could from then on listen to the music (it was music by all means) with a calm heart , by reading the lyrics of the songs printed on the program while singing. Settembrini sat at his side for a while, but then disappeared too, after he had remarked on something plump and plastic about the dull bel canto of the residents and expressed his satirical satisfaction at the fact that tonight too we were being so faithful and trusting among ourselves. To tell the truth, Hans Castorp felt relief when they were both gone, the narrow-eyed girl and the pedagogue, and he was free to devote his attention to the songs. He thought it was a good thing that music was being made all over the world and under the most unusual of circumstances, probably even on polar expeditions.","Her accompanist was likewise a resident. Frau Chauchat sat in the first row, but took advantage of the intermission to go out, leaving Hans Castorp free to enjoy the music in peace—after all, it was music—and to read the text of the songs, as printed upon the programme. Herr Settembrini sat awhile beside him, and made a few plastic and resilient phrases upon the dull quality of the singer’s bel canto, expressing also ironic satisfaction over the home talent displayed in the entertainment. It was so charming, he said, that they were just among themselves. Then he too went away—to tell truth , Hans Castorp was not sorry to see the backs of them both, the narrow-eyed one and the pedagogue; he could the better devote himself to the singing, and draw comfort from the reflection that all over the world, even in the most extraordinary places, music was made—very likely even on polar expeditions.","The accompanist was likewise local. Frau Chauchat sat in the first row, but disappeared at intermission, so that from that point on Hans Castorp could listen to the music (and it was music, despite the circumstances) with a peaceful heart, reading the text printed in the program as each song was sung. Settembrini sat off to one side for a while, but he also vanished, after first making a few graphic, taut comments about the local’s tedious bel canto and adding a satirical remark about how delightful it was that they were all so cozy and snug here together this evening. Truth to tell, Hans Castorp was relieved that the two of them—the narrow-eyed woman and the pedagogue—were gone, and he was free to devote his full attention to the songs. He thought what a fine thing it was that people made music all over the world, even in the strangest settings—probably even on polar expeditions."
"»Du kamst aber im letzten Augenblick«, sagte Joachim. »Bist du weit gewesen? Wie war es denn?«","""But you came at the last moment,"" said Joachim. 'Have you been far?

"Es herrschte Halbdunkel in der Halle an jenem Abend. Die regelmäßige Geselligkeit war matt und flüchtig gewesen, und früh hatte die Gästeschaft sich zum Spätliegedienst in die Balkonlogen verzogen, soweit sie nicht auf kurwidrigen Wegen wandelte, in die Welt hinab, zu Tanz und Spiel. Nur eine Lampe brannte irgendwo an der Decke des ausgestorbenen Raumes, und auch die anstoßenden Gesellschaftsräume waren kaum {898}erhellt. Doch wußte Hans Castorp, daß Frau Chauchat, die das Diner ohne ihren Gebieter eingenommen hatte, noch nicht ins erste Stockwerk zurückgekehrt war, sondern allein im Schreib- und Lesezimmer verweilte, und darum hatte auch er gezögert, hinaufzugehen. Er saß in dem hinteren, durch eine flache Stufe erhöhten und durch ein paar weiße Bögen mit holzbekleideten Pfeilern vom Hauptraum abgegliederten Teil der Halle, saß am Kachelkamin, in solchem Schaukelstuhl wie der, worin Marusja sich damals gewiegt, als Joachim sein allereinziges Gespräch mit ihr gepflogen, und rauchte eine Zigarette, wie es um diese Stunde hier allenfalls statthaft war.","It was semi-dark in the hall that evening. The regular socializing had been feeble and fleeting, and early on the guests had retreated to the balcony boxes for late bed shifts, as long as they weren't taking a path contrary to the spa, down into the world, to dance and games. Only one lamp was burning somewhere on the ceiling of the deserted room, and the adjoining lounges were hardly lit up either. But Hans Castorp knew that Frau Chauchat, who had eaten without her master, had not yet returned to the first floor but was staying alone in the writing and reading room, and that was why he too had hesitated to go upstairs. He was sitting in the back part of the hall, elevated by a flat step and separated from the main room by a couple of white arches with wood-covered pillars, sitting by the tiled fireplace in a rocking chair like the one Marusja was rocking in when Joachim was having his only conversation with her plowed and smoked a cigarette, as was at best permissible here at this hour.","It was half dark in the hall. The social activities had been brief and languid, the guests withdrew early to the evening cure or else took their wilful way into town, to dance and game. A single light burned in the hall ceiling—and in the adjoining salons dimness reigned. But Hans Castorp knew that Frau Chauchat, who had taken dinner without her protector, was not gone upstairs after it, but still lingered in the writingroom, so he did the same. He sat by the tiled hearth, in the back part of the hall, which was raised by one step from the rest, and separated by arches supported on two columns; in a rocking-chair such as that one Marusja had leaned back in, on the evening Joachim had spoken with her for the first and last time. He was, permissibly at this hour, smoking a cigarette.","The lobby lay in semidarkness. The regular social gathering had been dull and cursory; the guests had departed early for their balconies and the late rest cure—those, that is, who did not follow unhealthy paths down into town, to dance and gamble. Only one ceiling lamp was lit somewhere in the deserted lobby, and the adjoining social rooms were hardly any brighter. But Hans Castorp knew that Frau Chauchat, who had eaten supper without her lord and master, had not yet returned to the second floor and was lingering behind in the reading room; and so he, too, hesitated to go upstairs. He was sitting at the far end of the lobby, in an area one wide step up from the main space and separated from it by two white arches with wood-paneled columns—was sitting next to the tiled stove in a rocking chair like the one that had cradled Marusya when Joachim engaged her in the only conversation they ever had. He was smoking a cigarette, which was more or less permitted in the lobby at that hour."
"»Aber gewiß, Herr Settembrini!« Hans Castorp beeilte sich, seine befangene und halb trotzige Abkehr aufzugeben, das Trommeln auf der Bettdecke zu unterlassen und sich seinem Gaste mit bestürzter Freundlichkeit zuzuwenden. »Es ist sogar außerordentlich liebenswürdig von Ihnen … Ich frage mich wirklich, ob ich … Das heißt, ob es sich bei mir …«","""Certainly, Mr. Settembrini!"" Hans Castorp hastened to give up his embarrassed and half-stubborn retreat, to stop drumming on the covers, and to turn to his guest with dismayed friendliness. ""In fact, it's extremely kind of you... I really wonder if I... That is, if I'm...""","“Why, certainly, Herr Settembrini”—Hans Castorp hastened to abandon his forced and even peevish attitude, stop drumming on the bed-cover, and turn to his guest with friendliness, even with contrition. “It is uncommonly kind of you—I must ask myself if I really—that is, if there is anything—”","“But of course, Herr Settembrini!” Hans Castorp was quick to abandon his uneasy, half-defiant attitude; he stopped drumming on his comforter and turned back to his guest with confused affability. “That’s extraordinarily kind of you. But I really have to ask myself . . . I mean, in my case it would be . . .”"
"Entzweit mit dem Hirten seiner ursprünglichen Religionsgemeinschaft, verwaist und verlassen, dazu voller Verlangen nach reinerer Lebensluft, nach Daseinsformen, auf die seine Gaben ihm Anrecht verliehen, war Naphta, der das gesetzliche Unterscheidungsalter ja längst erreicht hatte, zum konfessionellen Übertritt so ungeduldig bereit, daß sein »Entdecker« sich jeder Mühe überhoben sah, diese Seele, oder vielmehr diesen ungewöhnlichen Kopf für die Welt seines Bekenntnisses zu gewinnen. Schon bevor er die Taufe empfing, hatte Leo auf Betreiben des Paters in der »Stella« vorläufige Unterkunft, leibliche und geistige Versorgung, gefunden. Er war dorthin übergesiedelt, indem er seine jüngeren Geschwister mit größter Gemütsruhe, mit der Unempfindlichkeit des Geistesaristokraten der Armenpflege und einem Schicksal überließ, wie es ihrer minderen Begabung gebührte.","At odds with the shepherd of his original religious community, orphaned and abandoned, full of longing for a cleaner way of life, for forms of existence to which his gifts gave him the right, Naphta, who had long since reached the legal age of distinction, was so impatient to convert to a denomination that his ""discoverer"" saw no effort in winning this soul, or rather this unusual head, for the world of his confession. Even before he was baptized, Leo had found temporary accommodation, physical and spiritual care, at the Father's instigation. He had migrated there, leaving his younger siblings with the greatest composure, with the insensitivity of the intellectual aristocrat, to the care of the poor, and to a fate befitting their lesser talents.","Sundered from the shepherd of his original fold, orphaned, forsaken, full of craving after freer air and forms of existence upon which his native gifts gave him a claim, Naphta, who was long past the age of consent, was so impatient for profession that he saved his patron all the trouble of winning this soul—or rather, this extraordinary head—for his sect. Even before Leo’s baptism he had, at the Father’s instigation, found temporary lodgment in the Stella Matutina, where he was given food for both body and mind; and had migrated hither with the greatest equanimity, and the callousness of the born aristocrat, leaving his brothers and sisters to the care of the Poor Guardians and a destiny suited to their lesser gifts.","Having quarreled with the shepherd of his original religious community, orphaned and abandoned, yet filled with a longing for life’s purer air, for a form of existence to which his talents entitled him, and having long since reached the age of legal consent, Naphta was so impatient to convert that his “discoverer” was spared any effort to win this soul—or better, this unconventional mind—for the world of his own religious confession. The priest saw to it that, even before his baptism, the lad was given temporary shelter and spiritual nourishment at the Stella. Leo moved in—but only after first abandoning, with the cool callousness of an intellectual aristocrat, his younger brothers and sisters to charity and a fate suited to their lesser talents."
"»So eine Zigarre hat Leben. Sie atmet regelrecht. Zu Hause {385}ließ ich es mir mal einfallen, Maria in einer luftdichten Blechkiste aufzubewahren, um sie vor Feuchtigkeit zu schützen. Wollen Sie glauben, daß sie starb? Sie kam um und war tot binnen Wochenfrist, – lauter ledrige Leichen.«",»A cigar has life. She's actually breathing. At home {385}I once thought of keeping Maria in an airtight tin box to protect her from moisture. Do you want to believe she died? She perished and was dead within a week—all leathery corpses.”,"Hans Castorp expressed it: “A cigar like that is alive—it breathes. Fact. Once, at home, I had the idea of keeping Maria in an air-tight tin box, to protect her from damp. Would you believe it, she died! Inside of a week she perished—nothing but leathery corpses left.”","“There’s life in a cigar. It actually breathes. At home I came up with the idea of keeping my Maria stored in airtight metal containers, to keep out the damp. Would you believe it, she died!

"War nicht die Anstalt »Morgenstern« ein richtiges Kadettenhaus gewesen, dessen Zöglinge, abgeteilt in »Divisionen«, zu geistlich-militärischer bienséance ehrenhaft waren angehalten worden, – eine Verbindung von »Steifem Kragen« und »Spanischer Krause«, wenn man so sagen durfte? Die Idee der Ehre und Auszeichnung, die in Joachims Stande eine so glänzende Rolle spielte, – wie deutlich, dachte Hans Castorp, tat sie sich hervor auch in dem, worin Naphta es leider krankheitshalber nicht weit gebracht hatte! Hörte man ihn, so setzte der Orden sich aus lauter höchst ehrgeizigen Offizieren zusammen, die nur von dem einen Gedanken beseelt waren, sich im Dienste auszuzeichnen. (»Insignes esse« hieß es lateinisch.) Nach der Lehre und dem Reglement des Stifters und ersten Generals, des spanischen Loyola, taten sie mehr, taten herrlicheren Dienst als all diejenigen, die nur nach ihrer gesunden Vernunft handelten. Vielmehr verrichteten sie ihr Werk »ex supererogatione«, über Gebühr, nämlich indem sie nicht nur schlechthin der Empörung des Fleisches (»rebellioni carnis«) Widerstand leisteten, was eben nicht mehr als Sache jedes durchschnittlich gesunden Menschenverstandes war, sondern dadurch, daß sie kämpfend schon gegen die Neigungen der Sinnlichkeit, der Eigen- und Weltliebe handelten, auch in Dingen, die gemeinhin erlaubt sind. Denn kämpfend gegen den Feind handeln, »agere contra«, angreifen also, war mehr und ehrenhafter, als nur sich verteidigen (»resistere«). Den Feind schwächen und brechen! hieß es in der Felddienstvorschrift, und ihr Verfasser, der spanische Loyola, war da wieder ganz eines Sinnes mit Joachims capitan general, dem preußischen Friederich und sei{676}ner Kriegsregel »Angriff! Angriff!« »Dem Feind in den Hosen gesessen!« »Attaquez donc toujours!«","Hadn't the ""Morgenstern"" institution been a real cadet house, whose pupils, divided into ""divisions,"" had been honorably held to spiritual-military bienséance - a combination of ""stiff collar"" and ""Spanish ruff,"" if one could say so ? The idea of honor and distinction, which played such a brilliant role in Joachim's class - how clearly, thought Hans Castorp, did it stand out even in that where Naphta unfortunately had not made it very far due to illness! If you heard him, the order was made up of nothing but highly ambitious officers who were animated only by one thought: to distinguish themselves in service. (""Insignes esse"" was the Latin word.) According to the teachings and regulations of the founder and first general, the Spanish Loyola, they did more, did more wonderful service than all those who only acted according to their common sense. Rather, they did their work ex supererogatione, not only by simply resisting the rebellion of the flesh (rebellioni carnis), which was no longer a matter of average common sense, but by fighting already acted against the inclinations of sensuality, of self-love and love of the world, even in things that are generally permitted. For acting against the enemy in battle, ""agere contra"", that is, attacking, was more and more honorable than just defending oneself (""resistere""). Weaken and break the enemy! it said in the field service regulations, and their author, the Spanish Loyola, was again in complete agreement with Joachim's capitan general, the Prussian Friederich and his {676} war rule »Attack! Attack!"" ""Sat in the enemy's pants!"" ""Attaquez donc toujours!""","And had not the establishment of the Morning Star been, precisely, a military academy, the pupils of which were drilled by divisions in military and spiritual decorum, a mingling, so to speak, of stand-up collar and Spanish ruff? And ideas of rank and preferment, which played such a brilliant part in Joachim’s profession—how plainly, Hans Castorp thought, were they visible in that other society, wherein Naphta, alas, by reason of his illness, had been prevented from making further headway! By his account, the Society was exclusively composed of officers on fire with zeal, moved by the single thought of distinguishing themselves (insignis esse, in Latin). And these, according to the teaching of their founder and first general, the Spanish Loyola, performed a far more splendid service than any could who were guided merely by their normal reason. For theirs was a work of supererogation (ex supererogatione) in that they not only combated the rebellion of the flesh (rebellio carnis), which after all was incumbent upon any average healthy human reason to do, but were hostile to even an inclination toward the things of the sense, toward love of self and love of worldly things, even where these had not been directly forbidden. For it was better and more honourable to assail the foe (agere contra), that is, to attack, than merely to defend oneself (resistere). To weaken and break the foe—those were the instructions in the service-book; and here again, its author, the Spanish Loyola, was of one mind with Joachim’s capitan general, the Prussian Frederick, with his motto of “Attack, attack! Keep on their heels! Attaquez donc toujours!""","Had not the Morning Star been a regular military academy, whose pupils, divided into “divisions,” were honorably exhorted to spiritual-military bienséance—a combination “stiff collar” and “Spanish ruff,” if one could put it that way? Ideas of honor and excellence played a significant role in Joachim’s profession—and were equally conspicuous, Hans Castorp thought, in the order in which Naphta had unfortunately been unable to advance very far due to illness. Listening to him, one might believe that the order consisted of nothing but very ambitious officers inspired by a single thought: to make their mark—insignes esse, as the Latin had it. According to the teaching and rules of its founder and first general, the Spaniard Loyola, they accomplished more and served more splendidly than those who acted purely out of common sense. Rather, they accomplished their work above and beyond the call of duty (ex supererogatione), not only by resisting the insurrections of the flesh (rebellioni carnis), which was, after all, the task of every man of average common sense, but also by doing battle against every inclination of the senses, against both love of self and love of the world, against things that are normally permitted. Because in battling the enemy, to attack (agere contra) was better and more honorable than simply to defend oneself (resistere). Weaken the enemy and break him—those were the instructions in their field handbook; and here again its author, the Spaniard Loyola, was of one mind with Joachim’s own capitán general, the Prussian Frederick, whose rule of war was: “Attack! Attack!” “Jump into your enemy’s pants!” “Attaquez donc toujours!”"
"Dennoch fehlte viel, daß die künstliche Höhensonne als wirklicher Ausgleich für den diesjährigen Fehlbetrag an echtem Himmelslicht empfunden worden wäre. Zwei oder drei reine Sonnentage im Monat – Tage, die freilich mit tief-tiefer Sammetbläue hinter den weißen Gipfeln, mit Diamantengeglitzer und köstlich heißem Brande in den Nacken und die Gesichter der Menschen besonders herrlich aus verschwimmendem Nebelgrau und dicker Verhüllung hervorstrahlten – zwei oder drei solcher Tage im Laufe von Wochen, das war zu wenig für das Gemüt von Leuten, deren Schicksal außerordentliche Tröstungsansprüche rechtfertigte, und die innerlich auf einen Pakt pochten, welcher ihnen gegen Verzicht auf die Freuden und Plagen des Flachland-Menschentums ein zwar lebloses, aber ganz leichtes und vergnügliches Leben verbriefte, – sorglos bis zur Aufhebung der Zeit und vollkommen günstig. Es half dem Hofrat wenig, wenn er daran erinnerte, wie wenig auch unter diesen Umständen noch das Berghof-Dasein dem {708}Aufenthalt in einem Bagno oder einem sibirischen Bergwerk gleiche, und welche Vorzüge die hiesige Luft, dünn und leicht wie sie war, leerer Äther des Alls beinahe, arm an irdischen Zusätzen, an Gutem wie Bösem, auch ohne Sonne doch immer noch vor dem Qualm und Brodem der Ebene bewahre: Verdüsterung und Protest griffen um sich, Drohungen mit wilder Abreise waren an der Tagesordnung, und es kam vor, daß sie ausgeführt wurden, trotz solcher Exempel, wie der jüngst erfolgten traurigen Rückkehr Frau Salomons, deren Fall nicht schwer, wenn auch langwierig gewesen war, durch ihren eigenmächtigen Aufenthalt in dem nassen und zugigen Amsterdam aber lebenslänglichen Charakter gewonnen hatte …","However, much was missing for the artificial sun lamp to be felt as a real compensation for this year's lack of real skylight. Two or three pure sunny days a month - days which, of course, shone with a deep-deep, velvety blue behind the white peaks, with diamond glitter and deliciously hot fire on the necks and the faces of the people shone particularly gloriously out of the blurring foggy gray and thick veil - two or three such days Days in the course of weeks was not enough for the minds of people whose fate justified extraordinary claims to consolation, and who inwardly insisted on a pact which, in return for renouncing the joys and sorrows of lowland humanity, was a lifeless but very easy one and pleasurable life certified, - carefree until the end of time and perfectly favorable. It was of little help to the privy councilor if he reminded him how little living at the Berghof resembled a stay in a Bagno or a Siberian mine, even under these circumstances, and what advantages the local air, thin and light as it was, almost empty ether of space, poor in earthly additives, in good and bad, even without sun still protected from the smoke and fumes of the plain: gloom and protest spread, threats of wild departure were the order of the day, and it came pretend that they were carried out, in spite of such examples as the recent sad return of Frau Salomon, whose case had not been difficult, if protracted, but had acquired lifelong character through her arbitrary sojourn in wet and draughty Amsterdam...","But the artificial sun was far from making up for the lack of the real one. Two or three days of full sunshine in the month—it was not good enough, gorgeous though these were, with deep, deep velvety blue sky behind the white mountain summits, a glitter as of diamonds and a fine hot glow on the face and the back of the neck, when they dawned resplendent from the prevailing thick mantle of grey mist. Two or three such days in the course of weeks could not satisfy people whose lot might be said to justify extraordinary demands from the external world. They had made an inward contract, by the terms of which they resigned the common joys and sorrows proper to flat-land humanity, and in exchange were made free of a life that was, to be sure, inactive, but on the other hand very lively and diverting, and care-free to the point of making one forget altogether the flight of time. Thus it was not much good for the Hofrat to tell them how favourably the Berghof compared with a Siberian mine or a penal settlement, nor to sing the praises of the atmosphere, so thin and light, well-nigh as rare as the empty universal ether, free of earthly admixture whether good or bad, and even without actual sunshine to be preferred to the rank vapours of the plain. Despite all he could say, the gloomy disaffection gained ground, threats of unlicensed departure were the order of the day, were even put into execution, without regard for the warning afforded by the melancholy return of Frau Salomon to the fold, now a “life member,” her tedious but not serious case having taken that turn by reason of her self-willed visit to her wet and windy Amsterdam.","All the same, it was generally felt that such artificial rays did not really compensate for the year’s deficit in genuine sunlight. Two or three days of full sunshine a month—even when they burst so splendidly out of the blur of foggy gray and thick cloud cover, spreading a deep, deep velvet blue behind the white peaks, scattering sparkling diamonds, and delightfully searing your face and the back of your neck—two or three such days over the course of so many weeks were not enough to help the mood of people whose fate justified their making extraordinary demands in the way of consolation and who presumed that in return for having renounced the joys and torments of flatland humanity, they had signed on for an easy and enjoyable, if rather lifeless life—on perfectly favorable terms, until time itself was abrogated. Nor did it help for the director to remind them that even under such circumstances life at the Berghof bore little resemblance to a stay on a prison ship or in a Siberian salt mine, or for him to praise the advantages of the local air, so thin and light, which like the pure ether of the spheres lacked all earthly admixtures, good or bad, and protected them from the fumes and vapors of the plains even without the sun; gloom and protest spread, threats of wild departures were the order of the day, and some were even carried out, despite sad examples like Frau Salomon, recently returned from her willful stay in windy, wet Amsterdam, whose case had once been stubborn but not serious, but now looked very much like a life sentence."

"{82}»Sicher«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Das glaube ich sogar sicher. Ich habe schon sehr viel Interesse gefaßt für euch hier oben, und wenn man sich interessiert, nicht wahr, dann kommt das Verstehen von selber … Aber wie ist mir denn nur, – sie schmeckt nicht!« sagte er und betrachtete seine Zigarre. »Ich frage mich die ganze Zeit, was mir fehlt, und nun merke ich, daß es Maria ist, die mir nicht schmeckt. Sie schmeckt wie Papiermaché, ich versichere dich, es ist gerade, wie wenn man einen völlig verdorbenen Magen hat. Das ist doch unbegreiflich! Ich habe ja ungewöhnlich viel zum Frühstück gegessen, aber das kann der Grund nicht sein, denn wenn man zu viel gegessen hat, so schmeckt sie zunächst sogar besonders gut. Meinst du, es kann daher kommen, daß ich so unruhig geschlafen habe? Vielleicht bin ich dadurch in Unordnung geraten. Nein, ich muß sie geradezu wegwerfen!« sagte er nach einem neuen Versuch. »Jeder Zug ist eine Enttäuschung; es hat keinen Zweck, daß ich es forciere.« Und nachdem er noch einen Augenblick gezögert, warf er die Zigarre den Abhang hinab zwischen das feuchte Nadelholz. »Weißt du, womit es meiner Überzeugung nach zusammenhängt?« fragte er … »Meiner festen Überzeugung nach hängt es mit dieser verdammten Gesichtshitze zusammen, an der ich nun schon wieder seit dem Aufstehen laboriere. Weiß der Teufel, mir ist immer, als wäre ich schamrot im Gesicht … Hast du das auch so gehabt, als du ankamst?«","{82}""Certainly,"" said Hans Castorp. 'I think so for sure. I've already taken a lot of interest in you guys up here, and if you're interested, don't you, then understanding comes naturally... But what's the matter with me – I don't like it!' he said, looking at his cigar. ""I keep asking myself what's wrong with me, and now I realize it's Maria that I don't like. It tastes like papier-mâché, I assure you, it's just like having a completely upset stomach. That's incomprehensible! I ate an unusually large amount for breakfast, but that can't be the reason, because if you've eaten too much, it actually tastes particularly good at first. Do you think it could be because I slept so restlessly? Maybe that's what messed me up. No, I'll have to throw it away!' he said after trying again. 'Every move is a disappointment; it's no use my forcing it.' And after hesitating a moment longer, he tossed the cigar down the slope among the damp pinewood. 'You know what I think it's to do with?' he asked… 'I'm pretty sure it has to do with that damn heat in my face I've been struggling with since I got up. Hell knows I always feel ashamed… Did you feel that way when you arrived?”","“Surely, surely,” Hans Castorp said. “I’m sure I shall. I already feel great interest in the life up here, and when one is interested, the understanding follows.—But what is the matter with me—it doesn’t taste good,” he said, and took his cigar out of his mouth to look at it. “I’ve been asking myself all this time what the matter was, and now I see it is Maria. She tastes like papier mâché, I do assure you—precisely as when one has a spoilt digestion. I can’t understand it. I did eat more than usual for breakfast, but that cannot be the reason, for she usually tastes particularly good after a too hearty meal. Do you think it is because I had such a disturbed night? Perhaps that is how I got out of order. No, I really can’t stick it,” he said, after another attempt. “Every pull is a disappointment, there is no sense in forcing it.” And after a hesitating moment he tossed the cigar off down the slope, among the wet pine-boughs. “Do you know what I think it has to do with?” he asked. “I feel convinced it is connected with this damned heat I feel all the time in my face. I have suffered from it ever since I got up. I feel as though I were blushing the whole time, deuce take it! Did you have anything like that when you first came?”","“Certainly,” Hans Castorp said, “I’m certain I shall. I’m already taking a great deal of interest in all of you up here, and once one is interested, why then understanding follows as a matter of course, doesn’t it? But what’s wrong with me—this doesn’t taste good,” he said, looking at his cigar. “I’ve been asking myself the whole time what was the matter, and now I realize that my Maria is the problem. I swear to you, it tastes like papier-mâché, exactly as if I had a terribly upset stomach. It’s really quite incredible! I did eat an unusually large breakfast, but that can’t be the reason, because when you eat a lot, it always tastes especially good at first. Do you think it can be because I slept so restlessly? Perhaps that’s thrown me off track. No, I’m simply going to have to toss it away,” he said after trying once more. “Every puff is a disappointment; there’s no point in forcing it.” He hesitated for a moment and then flicked the cigar down the slope among the wet pines. “Do you know what I’m convinced is to blame?” he asked. “I am thoroughly convinced that it has something to do with this damned flushed face of mine—it’s been bothering me again ever since I got up. Damned if it doesn’t feel as if I’m constantly blushing in embarrassment. Was it the same with you, too, when you first arrived?”"

"»Sie war auch schwach«, erwiderte Joachim. »… Ach, zu erzählen gäbe es viel; es ist schwer, die erste Auswahl zu treffen … Schwach war sie schon, es war nur die Angst, die ihr soviel Kräfte gab. Sie ängstigte sich eben fürchterlich, weil sie merkte, daß sie sterben sollte. Sie war ja ein junges Mädchen, da muß man es schließlich entschuldigen. Aber auch Männer führen sich manchmal so auf, was natürlich eine unverzeihliche {87}Schlappheit ist. Behrens weiß übrigens mit ihnen umzugehen, er hat den richtigen Ton in solchen Fällen.«","""She was weak too,"" replied Joachim. »… Oh, there would be a lot to tell; it's hard to make the first choice... She was weak, it was only fear that gave her so much strength. She was terribly frightened because she realized that she was about to die. After all, she was a young girl, so one has to excuse it. But men sometimes behave like that too, which of course is an unpardonable slackness. By the way, Behrens knows how to deal with them, he has the right tone in such cases.«","“She was weak,” responded Joachim.—“Oh, there’s so much to tell, one doesn’t have time to pick and choose. She was weak enough! It was only the fright gave her so much strength. She was in a fearful state when she saw she was going to die; and she was such a young girl , it was excusable, after all. But grown men behave like that too, sometimes, and it’s deplorably feeble of them, of course. Behrens knows how to treat them, he takes just the right tone in such cases.”","“But she was weak,” Joachim replied. “Oh, there are lots of things I could tell you about; it’s hard to know what to pick out first. She was already weak—it was fear that gave her so much strength. She was terribly frightened, because she realized she was going to die. She was just a young girl, so it is excusable, after all. But even grown men carry on like that sometimes, which is, of course, inexcusably weak-willed of them. Behrens knows how to deal with them, he can strike just the right tone for such cases.”"
"»Fürchterlich!« antwortete Wehsal kopfschüttelnd. »Das ist nicht zu sagen, was ich auszustehen habe von meinem Durst und meiner Begierde nach ihr, ich wollte, ich könnte sagen, es wird mein Tod sein, aber man kann damit weder leben noch sterben. Während sie weg war, fing es an, etwas besser zu gehen, sie kam mir allmählich aus dem Sinn. Aber seitdem sie wieder da ist und ich sie täglich vor Augen habe, ist es zuweilen derart, daß ich mich in den Arm beiße und in die Luft greife und mir nicht zu helfen weiß. So etwas sollte es gar nicht geben, aber man kann es nicht wegwünschen, – wen es hat, der kann es nicht wegwünschen, man müßte sein Leben wegwünschen, womit es sich amalgamiert hat, und das kann man eben nicht, – was hätte man davon, zu sterben? Nachher, – mit Vergnügen. In ihren Armen, – herzlich gern. Aber vorher, das ist Unsinn, denn das Leben, das ist das Verlangen, und das Verlangen das Leben, und kann nicht gegen sich selber sein, das ist die gottverfluchte Zwickmühle. Und wenn ich sage ›gottverflucht‹, so sage ich es auch nur redensartlich und so, als ob ich ein anderer wäre, ich selber kann es nicht meinen. Es gibt so manche Torturen, Castorp, und wer auf einer Tortur ist, der will davon los, will einfach und unbedingt davon los, das ist sein Ziel. Aber von der Tortur der Fleischesbegierde kann man einzig und allein loswollen auf dem Wege und unter der Bedingung, daß sie gestillt wird, – sonst nicht, sonst um keinen Preis! Das ist die Einrichtung, und wen es nicht hat, der hält sich nicht weiter dabei auf, aber wen es hat, der lernt unsern Herrn Jesum Christum kennen, dem gehen die Augen über. Gott im Himmel, was {934}für eine Einrichtung und Angelegenheit ist es doch, daß das Fleisch so nach dem Fleische begehrt, nur, weil es nicht das eigene ist, sondern einer fremden Seele gehört, – wie sonderbar und, recht besehen, wie anspruchslos auch wieder in seiner verschämten Freundlichkeit! Man könnte sagen: Wenn es weiter nichts will, in Gottes Namen, es sei ihm gewährt! Was will ich denn, Castorp? Will ich sie morden? Will ich ihr Blut vergießen? Ich will sie ja nur liebkosen! Castorp, lieber Castorp, entschuldigen Sie, daß ich winsele, aber sie könnte mir in Gottes Namen zu Willen sein! Es ist doch auch was Höheres dabei, Castorp, ich bin doch kein Vieh, in meiner Art bin ich doch auch ein Mensch! Die Fleischesbegierde gehet dahin und dorthin, sie ist nicht gebunden und nicht fixiert, und darum so heißen wir sie viehisch. So sie aber fixiert ist auf eine Menschenperson mit einem Angesicht, alsdann so redet unser Mund von der Liebe. Mich verlangt doch nicht bloß nach ihrem Körperrumpf und nach der Fleischpuppe ihres Leibes, sondern wenn in ihrem Angesicht auch nur ein kleines Etwas anders gestaltet wäre, siehe, so verlangte mich’s möglicherweise nach ihrem ganzen Leibe gar nicht, und daher so zeiget sich’s, daß ich ihre Seele liebe, und daß ich sie mit der Seele liebe. Denn die Liebe zum Angesicht ist Seelenliebe …«","""Terrible!"" replied Wehsal, shaking his head. ""That's not to say what I have to endure from my thirst and my desire for her, I wish I could say it will be my death, but one can neither live nor die with it. Things started to get a little better while she was gone, I was starting to forget about her. But ever since she's been back and I've seen her every day, I've sometimes been biting my arm and grabbing the air and can't help myself. There shouldn't be such a thing, but you can't wish it away - if you have it, you can't wish it away, you have to wish away the life with which it has become amalgamated, and you just can't do that - what's the use of it , to die? Afterwards, - with pleasure. In her arms - gladly. But before that, that's nonsense, because life, that's desire, and desire is life, and can't be against yourself, that's the goddamn dilemma. And when I say 'God damn', I'm only saying it as a form of speech and as if I were someone else, I can't mean it myself. There are so many tortures, Castorp, and anyone who is in a state of torture wants to get rid of it, simply and absolutely wants to get rid of it, that's his goal. But one can only want to get rid of the torture of the lust of the flesh on the way and on condition that it is satisfied - otherwise not, otherwise at no price! That's the setup, and those who don't have it don't dwell on it, but those who have it come to know our Lord Jesus Christ and their eyes will swell. God in heaven, {934}what an institution and affair it is that the flesh desires the flesh just because it is not one's own but belongs to another's soul - how strange and, rightly considered, how undemanding again in his bashful friendliness! One could say: if it doesn't want anything else, in God's name, let it be! What do I want, Castorp? Do I want to kill her? Do I want to spill her blood? I just want to caress her! Castorp, dear Castorp, excuse me for whimpering, but for God's sake she could do my bidding! There's something higher about it, Castorp, I'm not a beast, I'm also a human being in my own way! The lust of the flesh goes hither and thither, it is not bound and not fixed, and that is why we call it bestial. But if it is fixed on a human person with one face, then our mouth speaks of love. Not only do I long for her torso and the fleshy flesh of her body, but if there were even a little something different in her face, behold, I might not long for her whole body at all, and so it turns out that I love her soul and that I love her with my soul. For love of the face is love of the soul...""","Are you really so desperately in love with her?” “Fearfully,” answered Wehsal, with a head-shake. “Words cannot express what I have had to endure from my craving for her. I wish I could say it will be the death of me—but the trouble is, one can neither die nor live. It was a bit better while she was away, I was gradually beginning to forget her. But since she came back, and I have her daily before my eyes, I get attacks—I bite my hand and strike about me, and am beside myself. Such things ought not to be; yet one cannot wish not to have them. Whoever is in that state cannot wish not to be, it would be like wishing not to live, because it has bound itself up with life. What good would it do to die? Afterwards— afterwards, yes, gladly. In her arms it would be bliss. But before—no; it would be preposterous, because life is longing, and longing is life—it cannot go against itself, that is the cursed catch in the game. Even when I say cursed, it is only a way of talking, as though I were somebody else, for in myself I cannot feel it so. There are many kinds of torture, Castorp, and whichever one you are under, your one desire and longing is to be free of it. But the torture of fleshly lust is the only one you can never wish to be free of, except through satisfaction. Never, never in any other way, never at any price. So it is; the man who is not suffering from it doesn’t dwell on it; but the man who is learns to know our Lord Jesus Christ, and his tears run down. Good Lord in heaven, what a thing it is, that the flesh can crave the flesh like that, simply because it is not its own flesh, but belongs to another soul—how strange, and yet, when you come to look at it, how unassuming, how friendly, how almost apologetic! One might say, almost, if that is all he wants, in God’s name let him have it! What is it I want, Castorp? Do I want to kill her? Do I want to shed her blood? I only want to fondle her. Dear, good Castorp, don’t despise me for whining like this—but after all, couldn’t she let me have my way? There would be something higher about it, Castorp; I am not a beast of the field, in my way I am a man too. Pure fleshly desire casts about, here, there, and everywhere; it is not bound, not fixed, and so we call it animal. But when it is fixed upon a human being, with a human face, then we begin talking about love. It is not that I just crave her carnal part, to enjoy as if she were a fleshand-blood doll; if there were one least little thing different about her face, it might be that I should not crave her at all—which shows that I love her soul, and love her with my soul. For love of the face is love of the soul—”","Are you really so terribly in love with her?” “Horribly,” Wehsal answered, shaking his head. “I can’t tell you what I’ve had to endure—thirsting, craving for her. If only I could say it would kill me, but a man can’t live with it or die from it. While she was gone, things began to get a little better, I was gradually forgetting her. But since she has returned and I see her every day, it’s so bad sometimes that I bite my arm and flail my hands in the air and don’t know what to do. It’s a craving that shouldn’t even exist, and yet you can’t wish it didn’t exist. Once it has hold of you, you can’t wish it away, because you’d have to wish your life away, it’s so bound up with it, and you can’t do that— what good would dying do? Afterward—with pleasure. In her arms—only too gladly. But before? That’s nonsense, because life is desire, and desire is life, and life can’t be its own enemy. That is the damned hole I’m boxed into. And although I say ‘damned,’ it’s just a turn of phrase; it’s as if I were someone else—it can’t apply to me. There are so many different tortures, Castorp, and if a man is subjected to one torture, all he wants is for it to end, that is his one and only goal. But you can be rid of the torture of fleshly desire by only one means, and under one condition—by its being satisfied. Otherwise—no, not for any price! It is an instrument of torture, and if it hasn’t got hold of you, then you don’t bother with it, but whoever it does get hold of soon gets to know our Lord Jesus Christ and the tears roll down his cheeks. Good God in heaven, what an instrument, what a piece of business it is. Flesh desires flesh, simply because it is not your own, but belongs to another soul— how strange and yet, when viewed in the right light, how unpretentious, how unabashedly benign. You could almost say: if that’s all it wants, then in God’s name, let it have it. What is it I want, Castorp? Do I want to murder her? Do I want to spill her blood? I just want to fondle her! Castorp, dear Castorp, forgive me for whimpering like this, but for God’s sake she could comply with my wishes. And there’s something higher, loftier about it, too. I’m not a beast , I’m a human being, too, after all. The desire of the flesh wanders here and there, it is not bound, not fixed, which is why we call it bestial. But once it is fixed on a given human being with a face, why then our mouths speak of love. You don’t desire just her torso and the fleshly shell of her body; in fact, if her face were fashioned just a little differently, why, it’s quite possible you wouldn’t even want her whole body at all. Which only proves that I love her soul, and that I love her with my soul. Because to love the face is to love the soul.”"
"»Nun?« fragte er verwundert, indem er neben den Stuhl trat …","""Well?"" he asked in surprise, stepping to the side of the chair...","“Well?” he asked in surprise, coming up to his cousin’s chair.","“Well?” he asked, stepping up beside the lounge chair."
"»Nein!« fuhr Naphta fort. »Nicht Befreiung und Entfaltung des Ich sind das Geheimnis und das Gebot der Zeit. Was sie braucht, wonach sie verlangt, was sie sich schaffen wird, das ist – der Terror.«","""No!"" continued Naphta. »The secret and the commandment of the time are not the liberation and development of the ego. What it needs, what it desires, what it will create for itself is – terror.«","“No,” Naphta went on. “Liberation and development of the individual are not the key to our age, they are not what our age demands. What it needs, what it wrestles after, what it will create—is Terror.”","“No!” Naphta continued. “The mystery and precept of our age is not liberation and development of the ego. What our age needs, what it demands, what it will create for itself, is—terror.”"
"Der Friedhof war unregelmäßig in der Form, erstreckte sich {487}anfänglich als schmales Rechteck gegen Süden und lud dann ebenfalls rechteckig nach beiden Seiten aus. Ersichtlich hatte mehrfach Vergrößerung sich als notwendig erwiesen und war Acker angestückt worden. Trotzdem schien das Gehege auch gegenwärtig wieder so gut wie voll belegt, und zwar entlang der Mauer sowohl wie auch in seinen inneren, minder bevorzugten Teilen, – kaum war zu sehen und zu sagen, wo allenfalls noch ein Unterkommen darin gewesen wäre. Die drei Auswärtigen wanderten längere Zeit diskret in den schmalen Gehrinnen und Passagen zwischen den Mälern umher, indem sie dann und wann stehenblieben, um einen Namen nebst Geburts- und Sterbedatum zu entziffern. Die Denksteine und Kreuze waren anspruchslos, bekundeten wenig Aufwand. Was ihre Inschriften betraf, so stammten die Namen aus allen Winden und Welten, sie lauteten englisch, russisch oder doch allgemein slawisch, auch deutsch, portugiesisch und anderswie; die Daten aber trugen zartes Gepräge, ihre Spannweite war im ganzen auffallend gering, der Jahresabstand zwischen Geburt und Exitus betrug überall ungefähr zwanzig und nicht viel mehr, fast lauter Jugend und keine Tugend bevölkerte das Lager, ungefestigtes Volk, das sich aus aller Welt hier zusammengefunden hatte und zur horizontalen Daseinsform endgültig eingekehrt war.","The cemetery was irregular in shape, extending {487}initially as a narrow rectangle to the south, and then extending out to both sides, also in the shape of a rectangle. Apparently, several enlargements had proved necessary and a field had been added. In spite of this, the enclosure seemed almost fully occupied again, both along the wall and in its inner, less preferred parts - it was scarcely possible to see or say where there might have been accommodation. The three out-of-towners wandered discreetly in the narrow passageways between the walls for a long time, pausing now and then to decipher a name and the dates of birth and death. The memorial stones and crosses were undemanding and showed little effort. As far as their inscriptions were concerned, the names came from all four corners of the world, they were in English, Russian or Slavic in general, also German, Portuguese and other things; the dates, however, bore a delicate character, their range was remarkably small overall, the annual interval between birth and death was around twenty and not much more, the camp was populated almost entirely by youth and no virtue, an unsteady people who came together here from all over the world and finally returned to the horizontal form of existence.","The cemetery was irregular in shape, having begun as a narrow rectangle facing the south, and then thrown out other rectangles on both sides. Successive increases in size had evidently been necessary, and ploughed land had been taken in. Even so, the present enclosure seemed fairly full, both along the wall and in the less desirable inner plots; one could hardly see or say just where another interment was to take place. The three wandered for some time discreetly along the paths, among the enclosures, stopping to decipher a name or date here or there. The tablets and crosses were modest affairs, that must have cost but little. The inscriptions bore names from every quarter of the earth, they were in English or Russian—or other Slavic tongues—also German, Portuguese, and more. The dates told their own sad story, for the time they covered was generally a short span indeed, the age between birth and death averaging not much more than twenty years. Not crabbed age, but youth peopled the spot; folk not yet settled in life, who from all corners of the earth had come together here to take up the horizontal for good and all.","The cemetery was irregularly shaped, beginning as a narrow rectangle facing southward and then opening into two more rectangles, one on either side. It had obviously had to be enlarged several times by the annexation of adjacent fields. All the same, the enclosure seemed to be as good as fully occupied at present, whether along the walls or in the middle, where the less desirable plots were located. It would have been hard to say where anyone else could be buried. The three strangers wandered discreetly for a while along the narrow channels and passageways between the monuments, stopping now and then to decipher a name, the dates of birth and death. The gravestones and crosses were unpretentious affairs placed there at no great expense. As for the inscriptions, the names came from every corner of the earth, were written in English, Russian or other Slavic languages, in German, Portuguese, and many more tongues. The dates, however, had their own delicate individuality—on the whole these life spans had been strikingly short, the difference in years between birth and demise averaging little more than twenty. The field was populated almost exclusively by youth rather than virtue, by unsettled folk who had found their way here from all over the world and had returned now for good and all to the horizontal form of existence."
"Aber da war denn freilich noch dieser Settembrini selbst, der Oppositionsmann, Windbeutel und »homo humanus«, wie er sich selber nannte, der es ihm mit vielen prallen Worten verwiesen hatte, Krankheit und Dummheit zusammen einen Widerspruch und ein Dilemma für das menschliche Gefühl zu nennen. Wie stand es mit ihm? Und war es zuträglich, an ihn zu {228}denken? Hans Castorp erinnerte sich wohl, wie er in mehreren der übermäßig lebhaften Träume, die hier oben seine Nächte erfüllten, Ärgernis genommen an dem feinen, trockenen Lächeln des Italieners, das sich unter der schönen Rundung seines Schnurrbartes kräuselte, wie er ihn einen Drehorgelmann gescholten und ihn wegzudrängen versucht hatte, weil er hier störe. Aber das war im Traum gewesen, und der wachende Hans Castorp war ein anderer, weniger ungehemmt als der des Traumes. Im Wachen mochte es etwas anderes sein, – vielleicht tat er gut daran, es innerlich mit Settembrinis neuartigem Wesen zu versuchen, – mit seiner Aufsässigkeit und Kritik, obgleich sie larmoyant und geschwätzig war. Er selbst hatte sich ja einen Pädagogen genannt; offenbar wünschte er Einfluß zu nehmen; und den jungen Hans Castorp verlangte es herzlich, beeinflußt zu werden, – was ja freilich so weit nicht zu gehen brauchte, daß er sich von Settembrini bestimmen ließ, seinen Koffer zu pakken und vor der Zeit abzureisen, wie jener es neulich allen Ernstes in Vorschlag gebracht hatte.","But then, of course, there was still this Settembrini himself, the opposition man, windbag and ""homo humanus,"" as he called himself, who had rebuked him with many blunt words that illness and stupidity together constitute a contradiction and a dilemma for human feelings to name. How about him? And was it beneficial to {228}think of him? Hans Castorp well remembered how, in several of the excessively vivid dreams that filled his nights up here, he had been annoyed by the Italian's fine, dry smile, which creased under the beautiful curve of his mustache, how he had scolded him for being an organ grinder and tried to push him away because he was a nuisance here. But that had been in the dream, and the waking Hans Castorp was different, less uninhibited than the one in the dream. It might be different waking—perhaps he would do well to try Settembrini's novel nature inwardly—with its rebelliousness and criticism, though she was larmoyant and garrulous. He had called himself a pedagogue; evidently he wished to influence; and young Hans Castorp heartily wanted to be influenced - which of course did not have to go so far as to let Settembrini tell him to pack his suitcase and leave early, as he seriously suggested recently had brought.","Then there was Settembrini himself, of course—the chronic oppositionist, the windbag, the “homo humanus,” as he styled himself. Hans Castorp thought him well over, with his gift of the gab, his florid harangue on the combination of dullness and disease, and how he, Hans Castorp, had been taken to task for calling it a “dilemma for the human intelligence.” What about him? Would the thought of him be anyway efficacious? Hans Castorp recalled how several times, in the extraordinarily vivid dreams that visited his sleep in this place, he had taken umbrage at the dry and subtle smile curling the Italian’s lip beneath the flowing moustache; how he had railed at him for a hand-organ man, and tried to shove him away because he was a disturbing influence. But that was in his dreams—the waking Hans Castorp was no such matter, but a much less untrammelled person; not disinclined, either, on the whole, to try out the influence upon himself of this novel human type, with its critical animus and acumen, despite the fact that he found the Italian both carping and garrulous. After all, Settembrini had called himself a pedagogue; obviously he was anxious to exercise influence; and Hans Castorp, for his part, fairly yearned to be influenced—though of course, not to an extent which should cause him to pack his trunk and leave before his time, as Settembrini had in all seriousness proposed.","And then, of course, there was Settembrini himself—naysayer, windbag, and homo humanus, as he called himself—who had rebuked him with a lot of taut words for calling sickness and stupidity a contradiction and a dilemma for human emotions. What about him? Was it beneficial to think of him? Hans Castorp recalled quite well how in several of the exceedingly vivid dreams that filled his nights up here, he had been annoyed by the Italian’s delicate, dry smile, the mocking curl of the lip just below where the full moustache swept handsomely upward, how he had berated him as an organ-grinder because he was in the way up here. But that had been a dream, and the waking Hans Castorp was a different man, less uninhibited than in his dreams. Things might be different awake; maybe in looking for inner support he would do well to give Settembrini’s novel nature a try—rebellious and critical, though sentimental and bombastic, too. He had called himself a pedagogue, after all; apparently he wanted to exert some influence; and young Hans Castorp craved to be influenced; but, of course, that did not mean he was going to let Settembrini run his affairs—or that he was going to pack his bags and leave early as the fellow had recently suggested in all seriousness."
"Auf diese Weise, sagte Naphta, sei die Sachlage, wie Herr Settembrini sie zu sehen wünsche, nicht richtig gekennzeichnet. Das Entscheidende in seinem Weltbilde sei, daß er Gott und den Teufel zu zwei verschiedenen Personen oder Prinzi{698}pien mache und »das Leben«, übrigens nach streng mittelalterlichem Vorbilde, als Streitobjekt zwischen sie lege. In Wirklichkeit aber seien sie eins und einig dem Leben entgegengesetzt, der Lebensbürgerlichkeit, der Ethik, der Vernunft, der Tugend, – als das religiöse Prinzip, das sie gemeinsam darstellten.","In that way, said Naphta, the situation as Mr. Settembrini wished to see it was not properly characterized. The decisive factor in his world view is that he makes God and the devil into two different persons or principles and places ""life"" between them as an object of dispute, incidentally according to a strictly medieval model. In reality, however, they are one and the same opposed to life, to bourgeois life, to ethics, to reason, to virtue - as the religious principle that they represent together.","That, Naphta said, was no proper description of the state of affairs as Herr Settembrini looked at them. For the distinctive feature of his cosmos was that he made God and the Devil two distinct persons or principles, with “life” as a bone of contention between them—which, by the by, was just the way the Middle Ages had envisaged them. But in reality, God and the Devil were at one in being opposed to life, to bourgeoisiedom, reason and virtue, since they together represented the religious principle.","That was not a proper characterization, Naphta said, of the way Herr Settembrini wished to see things. The decisive factor in the humanist’s view of the world was that God and the Devil were two different persons or principles and that “life” was the bone of contention between them—very much after the medieval model, by the way. In reality, however, they were one, were united in their opposition to life, to the bourgeoisiosity of life, to ethics, reason, virtue; they were the single religious principle that they represented together."
"»Erzeugnisse einer Welt der Seele und des Ausdrucks,« versetzte Naphta, »sind immer häßlich vor Schönheit und schön vor Häßlichkeit, das ist die Regel. Es handelt sich um geistige Schönheit, nicht um die des Fleisches, die absolut dumm ist. Übrigens auch abstrakt ist sie«, fügte er hinzu. »Die Schönheit des Leibes ist abstrakt. Wirklichkeit hat nur die innere, die des religiösen Ausdrucks.«","'Products of a world of soul and expression,' replied Naphta, 'are always ugly from beauty and beautiful from ugliness, that is the rule. It is spiritual beauty, not that of the flesh, which is utterly stupid. It's also abstract, by the way,' he added. »The beauty of the body is abstract. Only the inner one has reality, that of religious expression.«","“All works of art whose function it is to express the soul and the emotions,” Naphta responded, “are always so ugly as to be beautiful, and so beautiful as to be ugly. That is a law. Their beauty is not fleshly beauty, which is merely insipid—but the beauty of the spirit. Moreover, physical beauty is an abstraction,” he added; “only the inner beauty, the beauty of religious expression, has any actuality.”","“Works of art from a world in which the soul expresses itself,” Naphta responded, “are always beautiful to the point of ugliness and ugly to the point of beauty. It is indeed a law. We are dealing with beauty of the Spirit, not of the flesh, which is basically stupid. And abstract, as well,” he added. “The beauty of the body is abstract. Only inner beauty, the beauty of religious expression, possesses true reality.”"
"Die Geselligkeit dieses Abends erhielt Gewicht und Leben {439}durch die Überreichung der Geschenke an den Hofrat, der mit Knut und der Mylendonk auf eine halbe Stunde herüberkam. Die Handlung vollzog sich in dem Salon mit den optischen Scherzapparaten. Die Sondergabe der Russen bestand in etwas Silbernem, einem sehr großen, runden Teller, in dessen Mitte das Monogramm des Empfängers eingraviert war, und dessen vollkommene Unverwendbarkeit in die Augen sprang. Auf der Chaiselongue, die die übrigen Gäste gestiftet hatten, konnte man wenigstens liegen, obgleich sie noch ohne Decke und Kissen war, nur eben mit Tuch überzogen. Doch war ihr Kopfende verstellbar, und Behrens probierte ihre Bequemlichkeit, indem er sich, seinen nutzlosen Teller unter dem Arm, der Länge nach darauf ausstreckte, die Augen schloß und zu schnarchen begann wie ein Sägewerk, unter der Angabe, er sei Fafnir mit dem Hort. Der Jubel war allgemein. Auch Frau Chauchat lachte sehr über diese Aufführung, wobei ihre Augen sich zusammenzogen und ihr Mund offen stand, beides genau auf dieselbe Weise, so fand Hans Castorp, wie es bei Pribislav Hippe, wenn er lachte, der Fall gewesen war.","The conviviality of this evening received weight and life {439}from the presentation of gifts to the privy councillor, who came over for half an hour with Knut and the Mylendonk. The action took place in the drawing room with the optical joke machines. The special gift of the Russians was something silver, a very large round plate, in the center of which was engraved the recipient's monogram, and the utter uselessness of which was obvious. One could at least lie on the chaise longue, which the other guests had donated, although it still had no blanket or cushions, only just been covered with a cloth. But her head was adjustable, and Behrens tried her comfort by stretching himself out on it, his useless plate under his arm, closing his eyes, and beginning to snore like a sawmill, claiming that he was Fafnir with the hoard . The jubilation was general. Mrs. Chauchat also laughed a lot at this performance, her eyes narrowing and her mouth hanging open, both in exactly the same way, Hans Castorp thought, as it had been the case with Pribislav Hippe when he laughed.","Hofrat Behrens, with Knut and Fräulein von Mylendonk, attended the social evening for half an hour. The occasion was to be signalized by the presentation of the gift to the head of the establishment, which accordingly took place, in the room with the optical apparatus. The Russians presented their gift, a large round silver plate, with the Hofrat’s monogram engraved in the middle; its utter inutility was plain to every eye. He might at least lie on the chaise-longue which was the gift of the rest of the guests—though it was at present without cover or cushions, having merely a cloth drawn over it. The head end was adjustable; Behrens stretched out full length, with his silver plate under his arm, closed his eyes, and began to snore like a saw-mill, giving out that he was Fafnir with the treasure hoard. Much laughter and applause ensued; Frau Chauchat laughed so hard that her eyes became two cracks, and her mouth stood open—precisely, Hans Castorp remarked, as had been the case with Pribislav Hippe when he laughed.","This evening their gathering was given added dignity and vitality by the presentation of the gift to the director, who stopped by for half an hour with Knut and Head Nurse Mylendonk. The ceremony took place in the social room with the optical toys. The Russians’ special present consisted of a very large, round silver plate with the recipient’s monogram engraved in the middle—an object whose utter uselessness was immediately obvious. One could at least lie down on the chaise longue the other guests had given him, although it was covered with just a cloth, since it still lacked both cushions and upholstery. But the headrest was adjustable, and Behrens tried it for comfort, stretching out on it with his useless plate still under one arm; pretending to be Fafnir guarding his treasure, he began to snore like a sawmill. Cheers on all sides. Even Frau Chauchat laughed very hard at this performance, so that her mouth stood open and her eyes drew close together, exactly like Pribislav Hippe’s whenever he laughed—or so it seemed to Hans Castorp."
"»Das wollen wir«, wiederholte Hans Castorp mechanisch. Sie sprachen leise, unter den Tönen des Klaviers. »Wir wollen hier sitzen und zusehen wie im Traum. Das ist für mich wie ein Traum, mußt du wissen, daß wir so sitzen, – comme un rêve singulièrement profond, car il faut dormir très profondément pour rêver comme cela … Je veux dire: C’est un rêve bien connu, rêvé de tout temps, long, éternel, oui, être assis près de toi comme à présent, voilà l’éternité.«","""We want that,"" repeated Hans Castorp mechanically. They spoke softly, under the notes of the piano. 'Let's sit here and watch like we're dreaming. It's like a dream for me, you must know that we sit like this - comme un rêve singulièrement profond, car il faut dormir très profondément pour rêver comme cela ... Je veux dire: C'est un rêve bien connu, rêvé de tout temps, long, éternel, oui, être assis près de toi comme à présent, voilà l'éternité.«","“Yes, let’s,” Hans Castorp repeated, mechanically. They spoke in low tones, covered by the music. “Let us sit here, and look on, as though in a dream. For it is like a dream to me, that we are sitting like this— comme un rêve singulièrement profond, car il faut dormir très profondément pour rêver comme cela. Je veux dire—c’est un rêve bien connu, rêvé de tout temps, long, éternel, oui, être assis près de toi comme à présent, voilà l’éternité.”","“Let’s do that,” Hans Castorp said mechanically again. And so they went on speaking softly, their conversation covered by the piano. “Let’s sit here and watch, as if in a dream. It is like a dream for me, you know, for me to be sitting here like this—like an especially deep dream, for a man must sleep very heavily to dream like this. What I’m trying to say is: it is a dream I know well, have dreamed for a long time, yes, eternally, sitting here with you as I am now. Behold—eternity.”"
"Und wenn ein Irrlicht Euch die Wege weisen soll,","And if a will-o'-the-wisp should show you the way,",And if you choose a will-o’-the-wisp to light,"And should a will-o’-wisp decide your way to light,"
"»Ah, ich sehe, das wird nicht nötig sein. Ich bin Ihnen im Wege, Sie sind es mir, – gut denn, wir werden den Austrag dieser kleinen Differenz an den gehörigen Ort verlegen. Für den Augenblick nur eines. Ihre frömmelnde Angst um den scholastischen Begriffsstaat der Jakobiner-Revolution sieht in meiner Art, die Jugend zweifeln zu lassen, die Kategorien über den Haufen zu werfen und die Ideen ihrer akademischen Tugendwürde zu berauben, ein pädagogisches Verbrechen. Diese Angst ist nur allzu berechtigt, denn es ist geschehen um Ihre Humanität, seien Sie dessen versichert, – geschehen und getan. Sie ist schon heute nur noch ein Zopf, eine klassizistische Abgeschmacktheit, ein geistiges Ennui, das Gähnkrampf erzeugt, und mit dem aufzuräumen die neue, unsere Revolution, mein Herr, sich anschickt. Wenn wir als Erzieher den Zweifel stiften, tiefer, als euere modeste Aufgeklärtheit sich je hat träumen lassen, so wissen wir wohl, was wir tun. Nur aus der radikalen Skepsis, dem moralischen Chaos geht das Unbedingte hervor, der heilige Terror, dessen die Zeit bedarf. Dies zu meiner Rechtfertigung und Ihrer Belehrung. Das Weitere steht auf einem anderen Blatt. Sie werden von mir hören.«","'Ah, I see that won't be necessary. I'm in your way, you're in my way - well then, we'll move the settlement of this little difference to the proper place. Just one for now. Their pious fear for the scholastic conceptual state of the Jacobin revolution sees my way of making young people doubt, overturning categories and robbing ideas of their academic virtue as a pedagogical crime. This fear is only too justified, because it is done for your humanity, rest assured - done and done. Already today it is just a plait, a classicist absurdity, a spiritual ennui that causes yawning spasms, and with which the new, our revolution, sir, is preparing to clean up. When we as educators create doubt deeper than your most modest enlightenment could ever have dreamed of, then we know very well what we are doing. Only out of radical skepticism, out of moral chaos, does the unconditional emerge, the holy terror that the time needs. This for my justification and your instruction. The rest is on another page. You'll hear from me.""","Herr Settembrini drew himself up; the movement was so expressive that Naphta went on: “Ah, I see, that will not be necessary. I am in your way, you are in mine— good. We will transfer the settlement of our differences to a suitable place. For the moment, only this: your sentimental solicitude for the scholastic interpretation of the Jacobin Revolution envisages a pedagogic crime in my manner of leading youth to doubt, of throwing categories to the winds, of robbing ideas of their academic dignity. And your anxiety is justified; for it happens on account of your humanity, be assured of that—happens and is done. For your humanity is to-day nothing but a tail end, a stale classicistic survival, a spiritual ennui; it is yawning its head off, while the new Revolution, our Revolution, my dear sir, is coming on apace to give it its quietus. We, when we sow the seeds of doubt deeper than the most up-to-date and modish freethought has ever dreamed of doing, we well know what we are about. Only out of radical scepsis, out of moral chaos, can the Absolute spring, the anointed Terror of which the time has need. This for your instruction, and my justification. For the rest we must turn over the page. You will hear from me.”","A sharp bow from Herr Settembrini induced him to continue, “Ah, I see that will not be necessary. I am in your way, you are in mine—fine, then, we shall find some appropriate venue for the settlement of our little differences. For the moment, just one thing. In your goody-goody concern for the scholastic state of ideas proclaimed by Jacobin revolution, you see some sort of pedagogic crime in my method of letting youth doubt, of casting categories to the winds, and of robbing ideas of their academic dignity. That concern is only too justified, for your humanism is done with, you may be assured of that—over and done with. Even now it is only a pigtail, a classicistic absurdity, a bit of intellectual ennui, which produces only yawns and which the new revolution, our revolution, is about to sweep aside. And if as pedagogues we sow doubt, a doubt more profound than your modest Enlightenment ever dreamed possible, we are well aware of what we are doing. The Absolute, the holy terror these times require, can arise only out of the most radical skepticism, out of moral chaos. That much in my own justification and for your instruction. All the rest, however, has yet to be dealt with. You shall hear from me.”"
"Das Wort hatte danach Herr Settembrini, und beim Himmel! er wußte etwas damit anzufangen. Eine solche Verwechslung des luziferischen Revolutionsgedankens mit der Generalrevolte aller schlechten Instinkte, sagte er, sei beklagenswert. Die Neuerungsliebe der Kirche habe durch die Jahrhunderte darin bestanden, den lebenzeugenden Gedanken zu inquirieren, zu erdrosseln, im Rauch ihrer Scheiterhaufen zu ersticken, und heute lasse sie sich durch ihre Emissäre für umwälzungsfroh erklären, mit der Begründung, ihr Ziel sei es, Freiheit, Bildung und Demokratie durch Pöbeldiktatur und Barbarei zu {889}ersetzen. Eh, in der Tat, eine schauerliche Art widerspruchsvoller Konsequenz, konsequenten Widerspruches …","Mr. Settembrini then had the floor, and by heaven! he knew what to do with it. Such a confusion of the Luciferian idea of revolution with the general revolt of all bad instincts, he said, was lamentable. The Church's love of innovation has consisted throughout the centuries in inquiring, strangling, and suffocating the life-generating thought in the smoke of its pyres, and today it lets its emissaries declare it revolutionary, on the grounds that its goal is freedom, To {889}replace education and democracy with mob dictatorship and barbarism. Eh, indeed, a horrible kind of contradictory consequence, consistent contradiction...","After that, Settembrini took the floor—and well he knew how to avail himself of it. It was lamentable, he said—this confusion of luridly revolutionary doctrine with a general insurrection of all the powers of evil. The Church’s love of innovation had for centuries manifested itself in putting to the question the living idea, wherever she found it; throttling it, quenching it in smoke at the stake; to-day she announces through her emissaries that she rejoices in revolution, that her goal is the uprooting of freedom, culture, and democracy, which she intends to replace by barbarism and the dictatorship of the mob. Yea, verily, a fearsome mixture of contradictory consistency and consistent contradiction. . .","Herr Settembrini then took the floor, and by God, he knew how to make the most of it. How deplorable, he said, to confuse true Luciferian revolutionary thought with a general revolt of every bad instinct. Over the centuries, the Church’s love of innovation had consisted of Inquisitions, whose task was to throttle all life-affirming ideas, to suffocate them in the smoke of the stake; but nowadays she was sending out her emissaries to announce that she was all for upending things, that her goal was to replace freedom, education, and democracy with dictatorship of the mob and barbarism. Eh, eh—that was indeed a dreadful sort of contradictory consistency, a consistent contradiction."
"»Halt! halt! halt!« rief Settembrini, indem er das Gesicht gen Himmel hob und die Handteller gegen die Schläfen preßte. »Schweigen Sie! Ich verbiete Ihnen, sich in dieser Weise die Zügel schießen zu lassen!«","""Stop! stop! stop!” cried Settembrini, raising his face to the sky and pressing his palms to his temples. ""Be quiet! I forbid you to let the reins fly like that!”","“Stop, stop, stop!” Settembrini cried, lifting his face to heaven and pressing his temples with the palms of his hands. “Be quiet, I cannot listen to you letting go the reins like that!”","“Wait! Wait! Wait!” Settembrini cried, lifting his face heavenward and pressing his palms to his temples. “Silence! I forbid you to play so fast and loose with time!”"
"Noch einmal hören wir Hofrat Behrens’ Stimme – horchen wir gut hin! Wir vernehmen sie vielleicht zum letztenmal! Einmal endigt selbst diese Geschichte; sie hat die längste Zeit gedauert, oder vielmehr: Ihre inhaltliche Zeit ist derart ins Rollen gekommen, daß kein Halten mehr ist, daß auch ihre musikalische zur Neige geht, und daß vielleicht keine Gelegenheit mehr unterkommen wird, den aufgeräumten Tonfall zu belauschen der Sprache des redensartlichen Radamanthys. Er sagte zu Hans Castorp:","Once again we hear Hofrat Behrens' voice - let's listen carefully! We may hear them for the last time! One day even this story ends; it has lasted the longest time, or rather: its substantive time has started rolling in such a way that there is no stopping it, that its musical one is also running out, and that perhaps there will no longer be an opportunity to overhear the tidy intonation of the language of the colloquial Radamanthys. He said to Hans Castorp:","ONCE more we hear Herr Hofrat Behren’s voice—let us give it our ear. For we hear it perhaps for the last time. Some day even the story itself will come to an end. Long has it lasted; or, rather, the pace of its contentual time has so increased that there is no more holding it, even its musical time is running out. Perhaps we shall have no further opportunity to hear the lively cadences of the Rhadamanthine tongue. The Hofrat said to Hans Castorp: “Castorp, old cock, you’re bored.","Yet once more we hear Director Behrens ’s voice—let us listen closely. We are hearing it for perhaps the last time. At some point even this story will end; it has lasted quite a long time—or rather, its content-time is rolling along so fast that there is no stopping it now and even its musical time is running out. Perhaps there will be no further opportunity to lend an ear to the cheerful cadences of our idiomatic Rhadamanthus. He said to Hans Castorp: “Castorp, old pal, you’re bored."
"Er stand wiederholt an der Leiche: einmal allein mit dem alten Fiete, das zweitemal zusammen mit seinem Großonkel Tienappel, dem Weinhändler, und den beiden Onkeln James und Peter, und dann noch ein drittes Mal, als eine Gruppe von sonntäglich gekleideten Hafenarbeitern einige Augenblicke am offenen Sarge stand, um sich von dem ehemaligen Chef des Hauses Castorp und Sohn zu verabschieden. Dann kam das Begräbnis, bei dem der Saal voller Leute war und Pastor Bugenhagen von der Michaeliskirche, derselbe, der Hans Castorp getauft hatte, angetan mit der spanischen Halskrause, die Gedächtnisrede hielt und sich nachher in der Droschke, der ersten gleich hinter dem Leichenwagen, der dann eine lange, lange Reihe folgte, sehr freundlich mit dem kleinen Hans Castorp unterhielt, – und dann war auch dieser Lebensabschnitt zu Ende, und Hans Castorp wechselte gleich darauf Haus und Umgebung, – zum zweitenmal tat er das ja bereits in seinem jungen Leben.","He repeatedly stood by the corpse: once alone with old Fiete, the second time together with his great-uncle Tienappel, the wine merchant, and the two uncles James and Peter, and then a third time when a group of dock workers dressed in Sunday clothes stood for a few moments at open coffin to say goodbye to the former boss of Castorp and Son. Then came the funeral, at which the hall was full of people and Pastor Bugenhagen from the Michaeliskirche, the same who had baptized Hans Castorp, dressed in the Spanish ruff, gave the memorial speech and afterwards got into the cab, the first one just behind the hearse, who then followed a long, long line, conversing very friendly with little Hans Castorp - and then this phase of life was over too, and Hans Castorp changed house and surroundings immediately afterwards - he did it for the second time in his young life .","He stood three times by his Grandfather’s bier. Once alone with old Fiete; once with Great-uncle Tienappel, the wine merchant, and his two uncles, James and Peter; the third and last time when a group of harbour hands in their Sunday clothes came to take leave of the head of the house of Castorp and Son. Then came the funeral. The room was full of people, and Pastor Bugenhagen of St. Michael’s, the same who had baptized little Hans, preached the sermon in a ruff. He was most friendly with the boy as they drove out together to the cemetery, in the first carriage behind the hearse. Thus did another epoch in the life of Hans Castorp come to an end, and again he moved to a new home and new surroundings, for the second time in his young life.","He returned several times to stand by the body: one time all alone, except for old Fiete; a second time together with his great-uncle Tienappel, the wine merchant, and his two uncles James and Peter; and then a third time as well, when a group of workmen from the harbor in their Sunday best stood for a few moments beside the coffin to take leave of the former head of the house of Castorp and Son. Then came the funeral and a dining room full of people; dressed in his Spanish ruff, Pastor Bugenhagen from Saint Michael’s, the man who had baptized Hans Castorp, performed the service, and afterward he spoke to little Hans Castorp in very friendly tones as they sat together in the coach, the one right behind the hearse and the first in a long, long procession. And with that, this part of Hans Castorp’s life came to an end as well, and a very short time later he changed homes and neighborhoods—for the second time now in his young life."
"Soviel von Hansens neuer Tischgenossenschaft. Der Platz zu seiner Rechten war frei, war nur vorübergehend besetzt, nur einige Tage lang: von einem Hospitanten, wie er es einst gewesen, einem Verwandtenbesuch, Gast aus dem Flachlande und Sendboten von dort, wie man sagen mochte, – mit einem Worte von Hansens Onkel James Tienappel.","So much for Hansen's new table society. The seat on his right was vacant, occupied only temporarily, only for a few days: by a guest like he once was, a visiting relative, a guest from the lowlands and emissaries from there, as you might say—in a word by Hansen's uncle James Tienappel.","So much of our Hans’s table-mates. The seat at his right was vacant, was only occupied for a few days by a guest, such as he himself had once been, a visiting relative from below, an envoy, one might say—no other than Hans’s uncle James Tienappel.","But enough of Hans’s new tablemates.

"Gleichwohl war er sehr glücklich bewegt über diese erste Anrede; denn trotz der Trophäe, dem makabren Angebinde, das er auf dem Herzen trug, hing er an Herrn Settembrini, legte großes Gewicht auf sein Dasein, und der Gedanke, gänzlich und auf immer von ihm verworfen und aufgegeben zu sein, wäre denn doch beschwerender und schrecklicher für seine Seele gewesen, als das Gefühl des Knaben, der in der Schule nicht mehr in Betracht gekommen war und die Vorteile der Schande genossen hatte, wie Herr Albin … Doch wagte er nicht, von seiner Seite das Wort an den Mentor zu richten, und dieser ließ abermals Wochen vergehen, bis er sich dem Sorgenzögling wieder einmal näherte.","Nevertheless he was very happily moved by this first address; for in spite of the trophy, the macabre robe he wore on his heart, he was attached to M. Settembrini, attached great importance to his existence, and the thought of being utterly and forever rejected and forsaken by him would be more onerous and had been more terrible to his soul than the feeling of the boy who had no longer been considered at school and had enjoyed the advantages of shame, like Herr Albin... But he did not dare to speak from his side to the mentor, and he again let weeks pass before he once more approached the troubled pupil.","Settembrini, set great store by his character and opinions; and the thought of being cast off would have weighed upon his spirit more heavily than that remembered boyish feeling of being left behind at school and not counting any more, of enjoying, like Herr Albin, the boundless advantages of his shameful state. He did not venture, however, himself to address his mentor; who, for his part, let weeks elapse before he again approached his “delicate child.”","All the same, he was touched and glad that the ice had been broken; for despite his trophy, the macabre gift that he wore next to his heart , he was very fond of Herr Settembrini, set great store by his presence, and the thought of being totally rejected and abandoned would have weighed down on him more heavily than had the feeling of being a schoolboy no longer in the running and enjoying the advantages of disgrace, just like Herr Albin. And yet he did not have the courage to speak to his mentor, and several more weeks passed before Herr Settembrini once again approached his problem child."

"Übrigens erwiesen sich diese Unterhaltungen in sachlicher Beziehung nur wenig fruchtbar, denn Fräulein Engelhart wußte beim besten Willen nichts Näheres über Frau Chauchat auszusagen, nicht mehr als jedermann im Sanatorium; sie kannte sie nicht, konnte sich nicht einmal einer Bekanntschaft rühmen, die sie mit ihr gemeinsam gehabt hätte, und das einzige, womit sie sich vor Hans Castorp ein Ansehen geben konnte, war, daß sie in Königsberg – also nicht gar so sehr weit von der russischen Grenze – zu Hause war und einige Brocken Russisch kannte, – dürftige Eigenschaften, in denen Hans Castorp aber etwas wie weitläufige persönliche Beziehungen zu Frau Chauchat zu sehen bereit war.","Incidentally, these conversations proved to be of little practical use, for Fraulein Engelhart, with the best will in the world, could say nothing more about Frau Chauchat than anyone else in the sanatorium; she didn't know her, couldn't even boast of an acquaintance she had in common with her, and the only thing she could put herself in front of Hans Castorp was that she was in Konigsberg - not that very far from the Russian border—was at home and knew a smattering of Russian—few qualities in which Hans Castorp was willing to see something like a far-reaching personal relationship with Mrs. Chauchat.","But Fräulein Engelhart, however much she would have liked to, could tell him practically nothing about Frau Chauchat. She knew no more than the whole sanatorium knew, and his conversations with her bore little practical fruit. She did not even know the lady to speak to, nor could she boast a single common acquaintance. Her only title to importance was that she lived in Königsberg, not very far from the Russian border; also that she knew a few scraps of Russian. These were but meagre distinctions; yet Hans Castorp was prepared to see in them something resembling an extensive personal connexion with Frau Chauchat.","These conversations, however, were much less fruitful when it came to facts, because, for the life of her, Fräulein Engelhart knew little or nothing about Frau Chauchat, no more than was general knowledge in the sanatorium; she did not know her, could not claim even to have any acquaintance in common with her. The only thing that could possibly increase her standing in Hans Castorp’s eyes was that she herself was from Königsberg, a city not all that far from the Russian border, and so could manage a little broken Russian—very meager attributes indeed; all the same, Hans Castorp was prepared to regard them as some kind of extended personal connection to Frau Chauchat."

Er könne sich an das letzte Mal nicht erinnern.","{793}What was the answer to that! At the moment, while she was peering, there was no way of speaking at all; but even after she left him, good advice remained dear. Of course he had choked on one or two occasions in his life, while eating and drinking; but that was humanless and could not have meant well in her question. He said: Why? He couldn't remember the last time.","What could he answer? For the moment, while she peered into his throat, nothing; but even after she was done, he was at a loss. Naturally, in the course of his life, when eating or drinking he had swallowed the wrong way; but everybody did the same, and surely that could not be what she meant. He asked why: he could not remember the last time.","What did you answer to that? For the moment, as long as she was peering down his throat, there was no way to reply; but even when she had let him go, Joachim was still at a loss for an answer. Of course he had swallowed the wrong way now and then, eating or drinking something. That was the common fate of humanity —that couldn’t be what she meant by her question. So he asked her why she had asked, said he couldn’t remember the last time it happened."
"»Eine bestechende Hypothese. Hat Hofrat Behrens Ihnen auch von der Deutschrussin erzählt, die wir voriges Jahr, – nein: vorvoriges Jahr fünf Monate hier hatten? Nicht? Das hätte er tun sollen. Eine liebenswürdige Dame, deutschrussisch ihrer Abstammung nach, verheiratet, junge Mutter. Sie kam aus dem Osten hierher, lymphatisch, blutarm, es lag auch wohl etwas Ernsthafteres vor. Nun, sie lebt einen Monat hier und klagt, sie fühle sich schlecht. Nur Geduld! Es vergeht ein zweiter Monat, und sie behauptet fortgesetzt, daß es ihr nicht besser, sondern schlechter geht. Ihr wird bedeutet, wie es ihr gehe, könne einzig und allein der Arzt beurteilen; sie könne nur angeben, wie sie sich fühle, – und daran sei wenig gelegen. Mit ihrer Lunge sei man zufrieden. Gut, sie schweigt, sie macht Kur und verliert allwöchentlich an Gewicht. Im vierten Monat wird sie bei Untersuchungen ohnmächtig. Das schade nichts, erklärt Behrens; mit ihrer Lunge sei er recht wohl zufrieden. Als sie aber im fünften Monat nicht mehr gehen kann, schreibt sie dies ihrem Manne nach Osten, und Behrens bekommt einen Brief von {298}ihm, – es stand ›Persönlich‹ und ›Dringlich‹ darauf in markiger Schrift, ich habe ihn selbst gesehen. Ja, sagt Behrens nun und zuckt die Achseln, es scheine sich ja herauszustellen, daß sie offenbar das Klima hier nicht vertrage. Die Frau war außer sich. Das hätte er ihr doch früher sagen müssen, rief sie, sie habe es immer gefühlt, ganz und gar verdorben habe sie sich! … Wir wollen hoffen, daß sie bei ihrem Mann im Osten wieder zu Kräften gekommen ist.«","'A compelling hypothesis. Did Hofrat Behrens also tell you about the German-Russian we had here for five months last year - no: the year before last? Not? He should have. A lovely lady, of German-Russian descent, married, young mother. She came here from the east, lymphatic, anemic, there was probably something more serious going on. Well, she's been living here for a month and complains that she feels bad. Only patience! A second month goes by and she keeps claiming that she's not getting better, she's getting worse. She is told that only the doctor can judge how she is doing; she could only state how she felt - and that was of little importance. You are satisfied with your lungs. Well, she's silent, she's taking a cure and she's losing weight every week. In the fourth month she faints during examinations. That doesn't hurt, explains Behrens; he was quite content with her lungs. But when she can no longer walk in the fifth month, she writes this to her husband to the east, and Behrens gets a letter from him - it said 'Personal' and 'Urgent' on it in pithy writing, I saw it myself . Yes, Behrens now says and shrugs his shoulders, it seems to be turning out that she obviously doesn't like the climate here. The woman was beside herself. He should have told her earlier, she cried, she had always felt it, she had completely spoiled herself! … Let us hope that she has recovered her strength with her husband in the East.”","“An alluring hypothesis. And has Hofrat Behrens also told you about the GermanRussian woman we had here last year—no, year before last—for five months? He did not? He should have. A charming woman, of Russo-German origin, married, a young mother. She came from the Baltic provinces somewhere—lymphatic, anæmic, but probably some more serious trouble as well. She spent a month here and complained that she felt ill all the time. They told her to be patient. Another month passes, she continues to assert that she is actually worse instead of better. They point out to her that only the physician can judge how she is—she herself only knows how she feels; which does not signify. They are satisfied with the condition of her lung. Good. She says no more, she goes on with the cure, and loses weight by the week. The fourth month she faints during the examination. That is nothing, says Behrens, her lung is perfectly satisfactory. But by the fifth month she cannot get about, she goes to bed and writes to her husband, out in the Baltic provinces; Behrens gets a letter from him marked ‘personal’ and ‘urgent’ in a very firm hand—I saw it myself. Yes, says Behrens, and shrugs his shoulders, it seems to be indicated that she certainly cannot stand the climate up here. The woman was beside herself. He ought to have said that before, she had felt it from the beginning, she declared—they had killed her among them. Let us hope she recovered her strength when she went back to her husband.”","“An alluring hypothesis. Did Director Behrens also tell you about a certain Russian woman whom we had here for five months last year—no, wait, the year before last? No? He should have. A delightful lady, of German heritage, married, a young mother. She came from somewhere in the Baltic region, anemic, lymphatic, there were perhaps more serious problems as well. Well, she spends a month here and complains of feeling very ill. Just be patient! A second month passes, and she continues to maintain that she’s not getting better, but worse. She is told that the doctor, and the doctor alone, can tell how she is doing; she can merely tell him how she is feeling—and that doesn’t matter much. They are satisfied with her lung. Fine, she says nothing, she continues her rest cure and loses weight with every week. She faints during her four-month checkup. That’s of no concern , Behrens says; they are really quite satisfied with her lung. But when by month five she can no longer walk, she writes her husband back by the Baltic, and Behrens receives a letter from him—the envelope is marked “personal” and “urgent” in a vigorous hand , I saw it myself. Yes, Behrens says now with a shrug, it has begun to look as if the climate here does not agree with her. The woman was beside herself. They should have told her that before, she cried, she had felt it all along, and now they had ruined her health entirely! We can only hope that she regained her strength once she joined her husband again by the Baltic.”"
"Sie hatten die unregelmäßig bebaute, der Eisenbahn gleichlaufende Straße ein Stück in der Richtung der Talachse verfolgt, hatten dann nach links hin das schmale Geleise gekreuzt, einen Wasserlauf überquert und trotteten nun auf sanft ansteigendem Fahrweg bewaldeten Hängen entgegen, dorthin, wo auf niedrig vorspringendem Wiesenplateau, die Front südwestlich gewandt, ein langgestrecktes Gebäude mit Kuppelturm, das vor lauter Balkonlogen von weitem löcherig und porös wirkte wie ein Schwamm, soeben die ersten Lichter aufsteckte. Es dämmerte rasch. Ein leichtes Abendrot, das eine Weile den gleichmäßig bedeckten Himmel belebt hatte, war schon verblichen, und jener farblose, entseelte und traurige Übergangszustand herrschte in der Natur, der dem vollen Einbruch der Nacht unmittelbar vorangeht. Das besiedelte Tal, lang hingestreckt und etwas gewunden, beleuchtete sich nun überall, auf dem Grunde sowohl wie da und dort an den beiderseitigen Lehnen, – an der rechten zumal, die auslud, und an der Baulichkeiten terrassenförmig aufstiegen. Links liefen Pfade die Wiesenhänge hinan und verloren sich in der stumpfen Schwärze der Nadelwälder. Die entfernteren Bergkulissen, hinten am Ausgang, gegen den das Tal sich verjüngte, zeigten ein nüchternes Schieferblau. Da ein Wind sich aufgemacht hatte, wurde die Abendkühle empfindlich.","They had followed the unevenly built road that ran parallel to the railway for a bit in the direction of the valley axis, then had crossed the narrow track to the left, crossed a watercourse and were now trotting along a gently ascending road towards wooded slopes, to where on a low protruding meadow plateau , the front facing south-west, a long building with a domed tower, which from afar looked porous and full of holes because of the balcony boxes, like a sponge, just put on the first lights. It was dawning quickly. A faint afterglow, which for a while had enlivened the evenly overcast sky, had already faded, and that colorless, lifeless, and sad transitional state prevailed in nature, which immediately precedes full nightfall. The inhabited valley, stretched out long and somewhat winding, was now illuminated everywhere, both on the bottom and here and there on the ledges on both sides - especially on the right, which extended and on which the buildings rose in terraces. To the left, paths ran up the meadow slopes and were lost in the dull blackness of the coniferous forests. The more distant mountain scenery, at the back of the exit towards which the valley narrowed, showed a sober slate blue. As a wind had picked up, the evening chill became sensitive.","They had driven for a space straight up the axis of the valley, along an irregularly built street that followed the line of the railway; then, turning to the left, they crossed the narrow tracks and a watercourse, and now trotted up a high-road that mounted gently toward the wooded slopes. Before them rose a low, projecting, meadow-like plateau, on which, facing south-west, stood a long building, with a cupola and so many balconies that from a distance it looked porous, like a sponge. In this building lights were beginning to show. It was rapidly growing dusk. The faint rose-colour that had briefly enlivened the overcast heavens was faded now, and there reigned the colourless, soulless, melancholy transition-period that comes just before the onset of night. The populous valley, extended and rather winding, now began to show lights everywhere, not only in the middle, but here and there on the slopes at either hand, particularly on the projecting right side, upon which buildings mounted in terrace formation. Paths ran up the sloping meadows to the left and lost themselves in the vague blackness of the pine forest. Behind them, where the valley narrowed to its entrance, the more distant ranges showed a cold, slaty blue. A wind had sprung up, and made perceptible the chill of evening.","They had first taken a street that was faced by an irregular pattern of buildings and ran along the railroad tracks, following the valley’s axis, but then turned left and crossed the narrow tracks and a brook; and they were now trotting up a gently rising road in the direction of wooded slopes and a low, outcropping meadow where an elongated building stood, its façade turned to the southwest, topped by a copper cupola, and arrayed with so many balconies that, from a distance as the first lights of evening were being lit, it looked as pockmarked and porous as a sponge. Dusk was falling fast. A pale red sunset that had enlivened the generally overcast sky faded now, leaving nature under the transient sway of the lackluster, lifeless, and mournful light that immediately precedes nightfall. Lights were coming up in the long, meandering, populous valley, dotting its floor and the slopes on both sides—particularly on the swelling rise to the right, where buildings ascended a series of terraces. Paths led up the meadowed hills on their left, but were soon lost to sight in the dull black of pine forests. Behind them, the mountains in the more distant background, where the valley tapered to an end, were a sober slate blue. Now that the wind had picked up, the evening had turned noticeably cooler."
"»Aber er braucht ja ganz verschieden lange – für unser Ge{103}fühl! Und tatsächlich … ich sage: tatsächlich genommen«, wiederholte Hans Castorp und drückte den Zeigefinger so fest gegen die Nase, daß er ihre Spitze vollständig umbog, »ist das eine Bewegung, eine räumliche Bewegung, nicht wahr? Halt, warte! Wir messen also die Zeit mit dem Raume. Aber das ist doch ebenso, als wollten wir den Raum an der Zeit messen, – was doch nur ganz unwissenschaftliche Leute tun. Von Hamburg nach Davos sind zwanzig Stunden, – ja, mit der Eisenbahn. Aber zu Fuß, wie lange ist es da? Und in Gedanken? Keine Sekunde!«","»But it takes quite a different amount of time – for our {103}feeling! And indeed ... I say: actually taken,' repeated Hans Castorp and pressed his index finger so hard against his nose that he completely bent the tip, 'is that a movement, a spatial movement, isn't it? stop, wait! So we measure time with space. But that's just as if we wanted to measure space in time - which only completely unscientific people do. It's twenty hours from Hamburg to Davos - yes, by train. But on foot, how long is it there? And in thoughts? Not a second!«","“But it takes such a varied length of time—to our senses! And as a matter of fact—I say taking it just as a matter of fact,” he repeated, pressing his forefinger so hard against his nose that he bent the end of it quite round, “it is motion, isn’t it, motion in space? Wait a minute! That means that we measure time by space. But that is no better than measuring space by time, a thing only very unscientific people do. From Hamburg to Davos is twenty hours—that is, by train. But on foot how long is it? And in the mind, how long? Not a second!”","“But how long that takes can vary greatly—according to how we feel it! And in point of fact . . . I repeat, in point of fact,” Hans Castorp said, pressing his forefinger so firmly against his nose that its tip was folded to one side, “that’s a matter of motion, of motion in space, correct? Wait, hear me out! And so we measure time with space. But that is the same thing as trying to measure space with time—the way uneducated people do. It’s twenty hours from Hamburg to Davos—true, by train. But on foot, how far is it then? And in our minds—not even a second!”"
"Settembrini erschien durch den Seiteneingang und schritt schnurrbartkräuselnd zu seinem Platze, der am Ende des Tisches gelegen war, der schräg vor demjenigen Hans Castorps stand. Seine Tischgenossen brachen in schallendes Lachen aus, als er sich niedersetzte; wahrscheinlich hatte er eine Bosheit gesagt. Auch die Mitglieder des »Vereins Halbe Lunge« erkannte Hans Castorp wieder. Hermine Kleefeld schob mit dummen Augen zu ihrem Tische dort drüben vor der einen Verandatür und begrüßte den wulstlippigen Jüngling, der vorhin so unschicklich seine Jacke emporgerafft hatte. Die elfenbeinfarbene Levi saß neben der fetten und leberfleckigen Iltis unter Unbekannten an dem querstehenden Tische rechts von Hans Castorp.","Settembrini appeared through the side entrance and, curling his mustache, strode to his place, which was at the end of the table that stood diagonally in front of Hans Castorp's. His table companions burst out laughing as he sat down; he had probably said something malicious. Hans Castorp also recognized the members of the Half-Lung Association. Hermine Kleefeld, with silly eyes, pushed her way to her table over there in front of the patio door and greeted the plump-lipped youth who had just pulled up his jacket so indecently. The ivory-colored Levi sat next to the fat and liver-spotted Polecat among strangers at the transverse table to Hans Castorp's right.","Settembrini appeared through the side door, and, curling his moustaches, strode to his place at the end of the table diagonally in front of that where Hans Castorp sat. His table-mates burst out in peals of laughter as he sat down; he had probably said something cutting. Hans Castorp recognized the members of the Half-Lung Club. Hermine Kleefeld, heavy-eyed, slid into her place at the table in front of one of the verandah doors, speaking as she did so to the thick-lipped youth who had worn his coat in the unseemly fashion that had struck Hans Castorp. The ivory-coloured Levi and the fat, freckled Iltis sat side by side at a table at right angles to Hans Castorp—he did not know any of their table-mates.","Settembrini came in by way of the side entrance, and twirling his moustache all the while, he strode to his seat, which was catercorner from Hans Castorp’s. His tablemates broke into peals of laughter as he sat down—presumably he had made one of his malicious remarks. And Hans Castorp also recognized the members of the Half-Lung Club. Doltish-eyed Hermine Kleefeld shoved her way to her table, over near one of the doors opening onto the veranda, and greeted the thick-lipped lad who had hitched his jacket up so unbecomingly. At the table set crosswise on his right sat Fräulein Levi with the ivory complexion and, next to her, plump, freckled Frau Iltis and a group of others whom Hans Castorp did not know."
"Die Tür war doppelt, mit Kleiderhaken im inneren Hohlraum. Joachim hatte das Deckenlicht eingeschaltet, und in seiner zitternden Klarheit zeigte das Zimmer sich heiter und friedlich, mit seinen weißen, praktischen Möbeln, seinen ebenfalls weißen, starken, waschbaren Tapeten, seinem reinlichen Linoleum-Fußbodenbelag und den leinenen Vorhängen, die in modernem Geschmacke einfach und lustig bestickt waren. Die Balkontür stand offen; man gewahrte die Lichter des Tals und vernahm eine entfernte Tanzmusik. Der gute Joachim hatte einige Blumen in eine kleine Vase auf die Kommode gestellt, – was eben im zweiten Grase zu finden gewesen war, etwas Schaf{23}garbe und ein paar Glockenblumen, von ihm selbst am Hange gepflückt.","The door was double, with coat hooks in the inner cavity. Joachim had switched on the ceiling light, and in its trembling clarity the room appeared cheerful and peaceful, with its white, practical furniture, its also white, strong, washable wallpaper, its clean linoleum floor covering and the linen curtains, which in modern taste are simple and merrily embroidered. The balcony door was open; one saw the lights of the valley and heard distant dance music. The good Joachim had put some flowers in a small vase on the chest of drawers - what had just been found in the second grass, some yarrow and a few bluebells, which he picked himself on the slope.","There were two doors, an outer and an inner, with clothes-hooks in the space between. Joachim had turned on the ceiling light, and in its vibrating brilliance the room looked restful and cheery, with practical white furniture, white washable walls, clean linoleum, and white linen curtains gaily embroidered in modern taste. The door stood open; one saw the lights of the valley and heard distant dance-music. The good Joachim had put a vase of flowers on the chest of drawers—a few bluebells and some yarrow, which he had found himself among the second crop of grass on the slopes.","There was a double door, with clothes hooks in the space between the two. Joachim had turned on the ceiling light, and its sharp luster revealed a room that was both cheerful and restful, with white, practical furniture; heavy, washable wallpaper, likewise white; a floor covered with spotless linoleum; and linen curtains, embroidered with a simple, cheerful pattern of modern design. The door to the balcony stood open to a glimpse of lights in the valley and the sound of distant dance music. Joachim had thoughtfully placed a few wildflowers in a small vase on the dresser—some yarrow and a couple of bluebells, in their second bloom this summer, that he had picked on the slopes."
"Herr Settembrini zögerte einen Augenblick. Dann richtete er sich auf, schlug auch die Augen auf, die er fest und schwarz auf Hans Castorp richtete, und erwiderte mit einer Betonung, die des theatralischen und effekthaften Einschlages nicht entbehrte:","Mr. Settembrini hesitated for a moment. Then he sat up, opened his eyes, which he fixed blackly and firmly on Hans Castorp, and replied with an emphasis that was not without theatrical and effective impact:","Settembrini hesitated for a second. Then he drew himself up, and directed the gaze of his black eyes full upon Hans Castorp’s face.","Herr Settembrini hesitated for a moment. Then he stood up tall, opened his black eyes wide, fixing them firmly on Hans Castorp, and responded with an emphasis that did not lack a certain dramatic, theatrical tone, “Yes, my good engineer."
"Jene bauchigen Gefäße mit kurzen Hälsen zum Beispiel, die auf den Gängen vor einzelnen Türen standen und auf die gleich am Abend seiner Ankunft sein Auge gefallen war, enthielten Sauerstoff, – Joachim erklärte es ihm auf Befragen. Reiner Sauerstoff war darin, zu sechs Franken der Ballon, und das bele{163}bende Gas wurde den Sterbenden zum Zweck einer letzten Anfeuerung und Hinhaltung ihrer Kräfte zugeführt, – sie schlürften es durch einen Schlauch. Denn hinter den Türen, vor denen solche Ballons standen, lagen Sterbende oder »moribundi«, wie Hofrat Behrens sagte, als Hans Castorp ihm einmal im ersten Stockwerk begegnete, – der Hofrat kam in weißem Kittel und mit blauen Backen den Korridor entlanggerudert, und sie gingen zusammen die Treppe hinauf.","Those bulbous vessels with short necks, for example, which stood in the corridors in front of individual doors and which caught his eye on the evening of his arrival, contained oxygen - Joachim explained it to him when asked. Pure oxygen was in it, at six francs a balloon, and the invigorating gas was supplied to the dying for the purpose of a last cheering and delaying of their strength - they slurped it through a tube. Because behind the doors, in front of which such balloons stood, were dying people, or ""moribundi,"" as Hofrat Behrens said when Hans Castorp met him on the first floor - the Hofrat came rowing down the corridor in a white coat and blue cheeks, and they walked up the stairs together.","Those great-bellied vessels, for example, with the short necks, which he had noticed the first evening standing in the corridors before certain doors. They contained oxygen; he had asked, and Joachim informed him. That was pure oxygen, six francs the container. The reviving gas was given the dying in a last effort to kindle or reinforce their strength. They drew it up through a tube. For behind those doors where such vessels were placed lay the dying—the “moribundi,” as Herr Hofrat Behrens called them when Hans Castorp met him one day in the first storey. Purple of cheek, in his white smock-frock, he rowed along the corridor, and they went down the steps together.","Those balloon-shaped containers with short necks, for example, which were set out beside the doors in the corridor and which had caught his eye on the evening of his arrival—Joachim explained about them when he asked. They held pure oxygen, for six francs the demijohn, and the stimulating gas was provided to dying patients in order to help preserve their energies and rouse them one last time—it was sipped through a rubber hose. And behind the doors where these potbellied containers stood lay the dying or the moribundi, as Director Behrens called them one day, when Hans Castorp chanced to meet him on the second floor—just as the purple-cheeked director in his white smock came rowing down the corridor. They walked down to the next floor together."
"»Hahahaha«, perlte sie gekitzelt, mit fliegender Brust. »Furchtbar komischer Mann, dieser Behrens, fabelhaft komischer und amüsanter Mann, zum Schief- und Kranklachen. Setzen Sie sich doch, Herr Kasten, Herr Carsten, oder wie Sie heißen, Sie heißen so komisch, ha, ha, hi, hi, entschuldigen Sie! Setzen Sie sich auf den Stuhl da zu meinen Füßen, aber erlauben Sie, daß ich strample, ich kann es – ha … a«, seufzte sie offenen Mundes und perlte dann wieder, »ich kann es unmöglich lassen.«","""Hahahaha,"" she cried, tickled, her chest flying. 'Terribly funny man, this Behrens, fabulously funny and amusing man, good for laughing and laughing. Do sit down, Mr. Kasten, Mr. Carsten, or whatever your name is, your name is so strange, ha, ha, hi, hi, excuse me! Sit in that chair at my feet, but allow me to kick, I can—ha—a,” she sighed open-mouthed, then spluttered again, “I can't help it.”","“Ha ha, ha ha!” she carolled, in high glee, holding her fluttering bosom. “Frightfully funny man, is Behrens; killingly funny, makes you die of laughing. But sit down, Herr Kasten, or Garsten, or whatever your name is; you have such a funny name—ha ha, ha ha! You must please excuse me; do sit down on that chair near my feet, but please don’t mind if I thrash about with my legs, I cannot help it.”","“Ha ha, ha ha,” she bubbled gleefully, her breast fluttering. “A terribly funny man, our Behrens, a fabulously funny, amusing man—laugh till your sides split. Do have a seat, Herr Kasten, Herr Carsten, or whatever your name was. You do have a funny name, ha ha, hee hee. You must excuse me. Do sit down on that chair at the foot of the bed, but pay no mind if my legs start kicking, I really can’t . . . ha ha, aaah”—she sighed with an open mouth and then went on bubbling—“really can’t seem to help it.”"

"»Da haben wir uns zu einem Kolloquium eingefunden!« sagte Hans Castorp, während seine Augen mehr an dem frommen Schrecknis im Winkel, als an dem Bewohner des überraschenden Zimmers hafteten, der es anerkannte, daß die Vettern Wort gehalten hätten. Er wollte sie mit gastlichen Bewegungen seiner kleinen Rechten zu den seidenen Sitzen leiten, aber Hans Castorp ging geradeswegs und gebannt auf die Holzgruppe zu und blieb, Arme in die Hüften gestemmt, mit seitwärts geneigtem Kopf davor stehen.","""We've come to a colloquium,"" said Hans Castorp, while his eyes were fixed more on the pious terror in the corner than on the occupant of the surprising room, who acknowledged that the cousins had kept their word. He wanted to lead them to the silk seats with hospitable movements of his small right hand, but Hans Castorp walked straight and spellbound towards the wooden group and stood in front of it, arms on hips, head tilted to one side.","“We’ve come for a little visit,” said Hans Castorp, with his eyes more on the pious horror in the corner than on the owner of the surprising room, who was expressing his gratification that the cousins had kept their word. With a hospitable motion of his small right hand he would have ushered them to the satin chairs. But Hans Castorp went as if spellbound straight up to the wooden group, and stood before it, arms akimbo and head on one side.","“We’ve come by for our little colloquy,” Hans Castorp said, his eyes directed more at the pious horror in the corner than at the occupant of this surprising room, who was commending the cousins for having kept their word. Gesturing hospitably with his little right hand, he was trying to lead them to the silk-upholstered chairs, but Hans Castorp, as if spellbound, headed straight for the wooden sculpture and stopped in front of it, his hands on his hips and his head tilted to one side."
"Im Stehen und Gehen schob er den Unterleib etwas vor, was einen nicht eben strammen Eindruck machte; aber seine Haltung bei Tische war ausgezeichnet. Er wandte den aufrechten Oberkörper höflich dem Nachbarn zu, mit dem er plauderte (verständig und etwas platt), und seine Ellenbogen lagen leicht an, während er sein Stück Geflügel zerlegte oder geschickt mit dem dazu bestimmten Tafelgerät das rosige Fleisch aus einer Hummerschere zog. Sein erstes Bedürfnis nach beendeter Mahlzeit war die Fingerschale mit parfümiertem Wasser, das zweite die russische Zigarette, die unverzollt war, und die er unterderhand, auf dem Wege gemütlicher Durchstecherei bezog. Sie ging der Zigarre voran, einer sehr schmackhaften Bremer Marke namens Maria Mancini, von der noch die Rede sein wird, und deren würzige Gifte sich so befriedigend mit denen des Kaffees vereinigten. Hans Castorp entzog seine Tabakvorräte den schädlichen Einflüssen der Dampfheizung, indem er sie im Keller aufbewahrte, wohin er jeden Morgen hinabstieg, um seinem Etui den Tagesbedarf einzuverleiben. Nur wider{53}strebend hätte er Butter gegessen, die ihm in einem Stück und nicht vielmehr in Form geriefelter Kügelchen vorgesetzt worden wäre.","Standing and walking, he pushed his abdomen out a little, which didn't make a very taut impression; but his bearing at table was excellent. He turned his erect upper body politely to the neighbor with whom he chatted (intelligently and somewhat flatly), and his elbows rested lightly as he cut up his piece of fowl or deftly pulled pink meat from a lobster claw with the specially designed tableware. His first need after the meal was over was the finger bowl of perfumed water, the second was the Russian cigarette, duty unpaid, which he surreptitiously obtained by way of leisurely piercing. It preceded the cigar, a very tasty Bremen brand called Maria Mancini, of which more will be said, and whose spicy poisons combined so satisfactorily with those of coffee. Hans Castorp protected his tobacco supplies from the harmful effects of steam heating by storing them in the cellar, where he descended every morning to put the day's needs in his case. He would only have reluctantly eaten butter that had been served to him in one piece and not in the form of rippled little balls.","Standing and walking, he rather stuck out his abdomen, which hardly made an athletic impression; but his bearing at table was beyond cavil. Sitting very erect, he would turn the whole upper part of his body to speak to his neighbour (with selfpossession, of course, and a little platt) and he kept his elbows well in as he dismembered his piece of fowl, or deftly, with the appointed tool, drew the rosy flesh from a lobster’s shell. His first requirement after a meal was the finger-bowl of perfumed water, his second the Russian cigarette—which paid no duty, as he had a convenient way of getting them smuggled in. After the cigarette the cigar; he favoured a Bremen brand called Maria Mancini, of which we shall hear more hereafter; the fragrant narcotic blended so soothingly with the coffee. Hans Castorp protected his supply of tobacco from the injurious effects of steam-heating by keeping it in the cellar, whither he would betake himself every morning to load his case with his stock for the day. It went against his grain to eat butter served in the piece instead of in little fluted balls.","Both when standing and walking, he thrust his lower body forward somewhat, which left the impression of a certain slackness; but his posture at the dinner table was excellent. He would politely turn his erect upper body toward his neighbor for small talk (always reasonable, with a hint of Platt), would rest his elbows easily at his sides when cutting a piece of fowl or deftly extracting the pink meat of a lobster claw with the appropriate utensils. When a meal was over, his first requirement was a finger bowl of perfumed water, his second a Russian cigarette, on which he paid no customs duties, since he had found a way to obtain them with a few well-placed, casual bribes. This was a prelude to his cigar, a Maria Mancini, a very tasty brand from Bremen—we shall come to speak about that again—whose spicy toxins blended so satisfyingly with those of his coffee. Hans Castorp kept his tobacco away from the deleterious effects of the house’s steam heat by storing it in the cellar, and every morning he would descend to provide his cigar case with its daily ration. Only reluctantly would he have eaten butter served in pats rather than in fluted little balls."
"Zum Erbleichen gab es Gründe auch sonst. Frau Chauchat dort hinten hatte zur Fastnacht Toilette gemacht, sie trug ein neues Kleid, jedenfalls ein Kleid, das Hans Castorp noch nicht an ihr gesehen, – aus leichter und dunkler, ja schwarzer, nur manchmal ein wenig goldbräunlich aufschimmernder Seide, das am Halse einen mädchenhaft kleinen Rundausschnitt zeigte, kaum so tief, daß die Kehle, der Ansatz der Schlüsselbeine und hinten die bei leicht vorgeschobener Kopfhaltung etwas {493}heraustretenden Genickwirbel unter dem lockeren Nackenhaar sichtbar blieben, das aber Clawdias Arme bis zu den Schultern hinauf frei ließ, – ihre Arme, die zart und voll waren zugleich, – kühl dabei, aller Mutmaßung nach, und außerordentlich weiß gegen die seidige Dunkelheit des Kleides abstachen, auf eine so erschütternde Art, daß Hans Castorp, die Augen schließend, in sich hineinflüsterte: »Mein Gott!« – Er hatte diese Art Kleiderschnitt noch nie gesehen. Er kannte Balltoiletten, festlich statthafte, ja vorschriftsmäßige Enthüllungen, die weit umfassender gewesen waren als diese hier, ohne im entferntesten so sensationell zu wirken. Als Irrtum erwies sich vor allem die ältere Annahme des armen Hans Castorp, daß die Lockung, die vernunftwidrige Lockung dieser Arme, deren Bekanntschaft er durch dünne Gaze hindurch bereits gemacht hatte, ohne eine so ahndevolle »Verklärung«, wie er es damals genannt, sich vielleicht als weniger tief erweisen werde. Irrtum! Verhängnisvolle Selbsttäuschung! Die volle, hochbetonte und blendende Nacktheit dieser herrlichen Glieder eines giftkranken Organismus war ein Ereignis, weit stärker sich erweisend, als die Verklärung von damals, eine Erscheinung, auf die es keine andere Antwort gab, als den Kopf zu senken und lautlos zu wiederholen: »Mein Gott!«","There were other reasons for blanching too. Frau Chauchat back there had done her toilette for Mardi Gras, she was wearing a new dress, at least a dress that Hans Castorp hadn’t seen on her before – lighter and darker, even black, only sometimes a little gold-brown shimmering silk, which showed a girlishly small round neckline, hardly so low that the throat, the base of the collarbones and behind the neck vertebrae, which protruded slightly when the head was held slightly forward, remained visible under the loose hair on the back of the neck, but this up to Clawdia's arms up to the shoulders--her arms, which were tender and full at once--cool at the same time, by all supposition, and extraordinarily white against the silky darkness of the dress, stood out in such a staggering way that Hans Castorp, closing his eyes , whispered to himself: »My God!« – He had never seen this kind of dress cut before. He knew ballroom toilets, festively permissible, even regulation, revelations that had been far more comprehensive than this without being remotely as sensational. Poor Hans Castorp's earlier assumption, above all, proved to be a mistake, that the lure, the irrational lure of these poor people, whose acquaintance he had already made through thin gauze, without such a punitive ""transfiguration,"" as he called it at the time might prove less deep. Mistake! Fatal self-deception! The full, highly accentuated, and dazzling nudity of these glorious limbs of a poisonous organism was an event proving far more powerful than the transfiguration of yore, an apparition to which there was no answer but to bow one's head and silently repeat: "" My God!""","Other good ground there was for paling. Frau Chauchat had made special toilet for carnival, she wore a new gown, or at least one new to our hero, of thin, dark silk, probably black, or at most shot with a golden brown. It was cut with a modest little round neck like a schoolgirl’s frock, hardly so much as to show the base of the throat, or the collar-bones, or the slightly prominent bone at the back of the neck, beneath the soft fringes or her hair. But it left free to the shoulder Clavdia’s arms, so tender and yet so full , so cool, so amazingly white, set off against the dark silk of her frock, with such ravishing effect that it made Hans Castorp close his eyes, and murmur within himself: “O my God!” He had never seen such a mode before. Ball gowns he had seen, stately and ceremonial, cut in conformity with a fashion that exposed far more of the person than this one did, without achieving a jot of its sensational effect. Poor Hans Castorp! He was reminded of a theory he had once held about these arms, on making their acquaintance for the first time, veiled in diaphanous gauze: that it was the gauze itself, the “illusion” as he called it, which had lent them their indescribable, unreasonable seductiveness. Folly! The utter, accentuated, blinding nudity of these arms, these splendid members of an infected organism, was an experience so intoxicating, compared with that earlier one, as to leave our young man no other recourse than again, with drooping head, to whisper, soundlessly: “O my God!”","There was reason enough for him to turn pale. Frau Chauchat had likewise dressed for the occasion and was wearing a new gown, or at least a gown that Hans Castorp had never seen on her—of thin, dark, almost black silk that sometimes took on a tawny shimmer; the rounded cut of the neck was small, almost girlish, barely deep enough to expose the throat or even a hint of the collarbone—or her protruding neck bones visible beneath a few stray hairs when she thrust her head forward in that special way. But it left Clavdia’s arms bare all the way to the shoulder—her arms, so tender and full at the same time, and cool, one could only presume—so that they stood out extraordinarily white against the dark shadows of silk. The effect was so overwhelming that Hans Castorp closed his eyes and whispered to himself, “My God!” He had never seen a dress cut like that. He was familiar with festive, yet formal ball gowns that revealed, as custom allowed, far more of the human body than this one, yet without causing the least bit of sensation. Poor Hans Castorp— what an error his earlier assumption had been upon first making the acquaintance of those arms through thin gossamer: that once bared, bared against all good reason, those arms would affect him less deeply without the seductive “radiant illusion” of fabric, as he had called it that day. An error, a fatal act of self-deception! The full, heightened, dazzling nakedness of the splendid limbs of a sick, infected organism turned out to be an experience far more potent than that day’s “illusion”—a phenomenon for which there was only one response : he lowered his head again and silently repeated, “My God!”"
"Kurz nach Weihnachten starb der Herrenreiter … Aber vorher spielte eben noch Weihnachten sich ab, diese beiden Festtage, oder, wenn man den Tag des heiligen Abends mitzählte, diese drei, denen Hans Castorp mit einigem Schrecken und der kopfschüttelnden Erwartung entgegengesehen hatte, wie sie sich hier wohl ausnehmen würden, und die dann, als natürliche Tage mit Morgen, Mittag, Abend und mittlerer Zufallswitterung (es taute etwas), auch nicht anders, als andere ihrer Gattung, heraufgekommen und verblichen waren: – äußerlich ein wenig geschmückt und ausgezeichnet, hatten sie während der ihnen zugemessenen Frist ihre Bewußtseinsherrschaft in den Köpfen und Herzen der Menschen geübt und waren unter Zurücklassung eines Niederschlages unalltäglicher Eindrücke zu naher und fernerer Vergangenheit geworden …","Shortly after Christmas the Herrenreiter died... But before that Christmas happened, these two holidays, or if you count the day of Christmas Eve, these three, which Hans Castorp had looked forward to with some horror and the expectation that shook his head, just like she did would probably be the exception here, and who then, as natural days with morning, noon, evening and average random weather (there was a bit of a thaw), had come up and faded no differently than others of their kind: - outwardly a little decorated and distinguished they exercised their rule of consciousness in the minds and hearts of people during the period allotted to them and, leaving behind a deposit of unusual impressions, had become the near and distant past ...","NOT long after Christmas, the gentleman rider died.—But before that event the Christmas holidays came and went, the two, or if you reckoned Holy Night the three feast-days, to which Hans Castorp had looked forward with some alarm and headshaking dubiety, as to what they would really be like, up here. In the event, they came on and passed like other days, with a morning, an afternoon, and an evening; only moderately unreasonable in respect of weather—it thawed a little—and not greatly different from others of their kind. Outwardly, they had been somewhat garnished and set off; inwardly they had held sway in the heads and hearts of men for their appointed time; then, leaving behind them some deposit of impressions out of the common run, they slipped away into the recent, then into the distant past.","Shortly after the holidays, the Austrian horseman died. Prior to that event, however, was Christmas, two days of festivities—or three, if you counted Christmas Eve—that Hans Castorp had awaited with some anxiety, shaking his head now and then, wondering what they would be like here, only to discover that they came and went like normal days with a morning, afternoon, and evening, with the usual whims of the weather (a slight thaw set in), and were indistinguishable from others of their sort, apart from a little external decoration and the mood that held sway in people’s hearts and minds for the time allotted to them, until the days moved on, becoming a recent, then distant past silted with a few novel impressions."

"»Ich habe Ihnen so richtig wie möglich geantwortet, Mynheer Peeperkorn,« sagte Hans Castorp, »und mich gewissenhaft bemüht, weder zuviel noch zuwenig zu sagen. Es kam mir vor allem darauf an, Sie bemerken zu lassen, daß es gewissermaßen freisteht, jenen Abend des vollen Du und des Abschieds mitzählen zu lassen oder nicht, – daß er ein aus aller Ordnung und beinahe aus dem Kalender fallender Abend war, ein hors d’œuvre, sozusagen, ein Extraabend, ein Schaltabend, der neunundzwanzigste Februar, – und daß es also nur eine halbe Lüge gewesen wäre, wenn ich Ihre Feststellung geleugnet hätte.«","'I have answered you as correctly as I can, Mynheer Peeperkorn,' said Hans Castorp, 'and made a careful effort not to say too much or too little. Above all, I wanted to let you notice that you are, so to speak, free to count that evening of full you and farewell or not - that it was an out of order and almost out of the calendar evening, an hors d'oeuvre, so to speak, an extra evening, an intercalary evening, the twenty-ninth of February - and that if I had denied your statement it would only have been half a lie.""","“I have given you the best answer I could, Mynheer Peeperkorn,” Hans Castorp said. “I have tried to say neither too much nor too little. I was concerned to let you see that it is in a way open to us to count that evening—when the thou had full sway, and it was the eve of Clavdia’s departure—or not to count it. It was an extraordinary occasion, almost outside the calendar, intercalated, so to speak, a twenty-ninth of February. It would have been only half a lie if I had simply denied the truth of what you said.”","“I have answered your question as accurately as possible, Mynheer Peeperkorn,” Hans Castorp said, “and have conscientiously tried to say neither too much nor too little. The main point was to allow you to see that it is more or less left to you whether or not you count that evening of farewell and meaningful informal pronouns—to allow you to see that it was an evening outside any schedule, almost outside the calendar, an hors d’oeuvre, so to speak, an extra evening, a leap-year evening, the twenty-ninth of February. And so it would have been only half a lie had I denied your observation.”"

"»Magnifik!« antwortete Settembrini, dem die Vettern wieder einmal bei der Vormittagsmotion begegnet waren. »Splendide!« antwortete er. »Das ist so lustig wie im Prater, Sie werden sehen, Ingenieur. Dann sind wir gleich im Reihen hier die glänzenden Galanten«, sprach er, und fuhr dann prallen Mundes zu medisieren fort, indem er seine Hechelreden mit gelungenen Arm-, Kopf- und Schulterbewegungen begleitete: »Was wollen Sie, auch in der maison de santé finden bisweilen ja Bälle statt, für die Narren und Blöden, wie ich gelesen habe, – warum nicht auch hier? Das Programm umfaßt die verschiedensten danses macabres, wie Sie sich denken können. Leider kann ein gewisser Teil der vorjährigen Festteilnehmer diesmal nicht erscheinen, da das Fest schon um 9½ Uhr sein Ende findet …«","""Magnifik!"" replied Settembrini, whom the cousins had met again at the morning motion. ""Splendid!"" he replied. “It's as fun as in the Prater, you'll see, engineer. Then we'll be right here in the rows of brilliant gallants,' he said, and then continued to meditate with a bulging mouth, accompanying his panting speeches with successful arm, head and shoulder movements: 'What do you want, also in the maison de santé balls sometimes take place, for the fools and idiots, as I have read - why not here too? The program includes the most diverse danses macabres as you can imagine. Unfortunately, a certain number of last year's festival participants cannot appear this time, as the festival ends at 9:30 a.m. ...«","“Magnifique,” answered Settembrini, whom the cousins had again encountered on the morning walk. “Gorgeous,” he said. “Every bit as lively as it is in the Prater. You shall see, Engineer, ‘the gayest gallants of the night, in brilliant rows advancing,’ ” he quoted, and went on in his most mocking vein, couching his gibes in sounding phrases, with a telling accompaniment of arm, shoulder, and head movements. “What do you expect? Even in maisons de santé they have their balls for the fools and idiots, I’ve read; why not up here as well? The programme includes various danses macabres, as you may imagine; but unfortunately some of last year’s guests will not be here—the party being over at half past nine, you perceive—”","“Magnifique!” responded Settembrini, who had happened to meet the cousins on their morning constitutional. “Splendid!” he said. “As rollicking as in the Prater. You’ll see, my good engineer. And now the dance is taken up, we play gallants most dashing,” he quoted, and went on shooting a volley of taut, satirical words, accompanying his satire with deft gestures of arm, head, and shoulder. “What do you want? Even in the maison de santé they throw balls and galas now and then for the fools and cretins, or so I’ve read—why not here? The program includes various danses macabres.

"Hans Castorp fand an den Hängen dieselben Blumen wieder, von denen Joachim freundlicherweise ihm einige letzte einst zur Begrüßung ins Zimmer gestellt: Schafsgarbe und Glockenblumen, – ein Zeichen für ihn, daß das Jahr in sich selber lief. Allein was hatte sich nun nicht alles aus dem jungen, smaragdenen Grase der Schrägen und Wiesengebreite des Grundes an organischem Leben als Stern, Kelch und Glocke oder von unregelmäßigerer Gestalt, die sonnige Luft mit trockener Würze erfüllend, hervorgebildet: Pechnelken und wilde Stiefmütterchen in ganzen Massen, Gänseblümchen, Margueriten, Primeln in gelb und rot, viel schöner und größer, als Hans Castorp sie im Flachlande je erblickt zu haben meinte, soweit er dort unten darauf achtgegeben; dazu die nickenden Soldanellen mit ihren gewimperten Glöckchen, blau, purpurn und rosig, eine Spezialität dieser Sphäre.","Hans Castorp found the same flowers on the slopes, some of which Joachim had kindly placed in his room as a greeting: yarrow and bluebells - a sign for him that the year was moving in its own right. But how much organic life had not developed from the young, emerald grass of the slopes and meadows of the ground as a star, chalice and bell or of more irregular shape, filling the sunny air with dry spice: pitch pinks and wild pansies in whole masses , daisies, marguerites, primroses in yellow and red, much prettier and larger than Hans Castorp thought he had ever seen in the lowlands, as far as he paid attention to them down there; in addition the nodding soldanelles with their ciliated bells, blue, purple and rosy, a specialty of this sphere.","Hans Castorp found bluebells and yarrow on the hill-side, like the ones Joachim had put in his room to greet him when he came; and seeing them, realized how the year was rounding out. Those others had been the late blossoms of the declining summer; whereas now the tender emerald grass of the sloping meadows was thick-starred with every sort of bloom, cup-shaped, bell-shaped, star-shaped, any-shaped, filling the sunny air with warm spice and scent: quantities of wild pansies and fly-bane, daisies, red and yellow primulas, larger and finer than any Hans Castorp had ever seen down below, so far as he could recall noticing, and the nodding soldanella, peculiar to the region, with its little eye-lashed bells of rose-colour, purple, and blue.","Hans Castorp found the slopes full of flowers, the same ones that had just been ending their bloom when Joachim had gathered a few to put in his room as a friendly greeting—yarrow and bluebells. It was a sign that the year was coming full circle. But along with new emerald-green grass, what a wealth of organic life had now emerged from the soil on the slopes and wide meadows—stars, chalices, bells, and whimsies that filled the sun-drenched air with subtle fragrances: great masses of Alpine campion and wild pansies, daisies, marguerites, cowslips in red and yellow—much larger and more beautiful than any Hans Castorp remembered seeing in the flatlands, that is, to the extent that he had ever paid attention to them—plus nodding soldanella, little ciliated bells of blue, purple, and pink, a specialty of the region."

"Es war jetzt städtisches Trottoir, auf dem sie gingen, – die Hauptstraße eines internationalen Treffpunktes, das sah man wohl. Flanierende Kurgäste begegneten ihnen, junge Leute zumeist, Kavaliere in Sportanzügen und ohne Hut, Damen, ebenfalls ohne Hut und in weißen Röcken. Man hörte Russisch und Englisch sprechen. Läden mit schmucken Schaufenstern reihten sich rechts und links, und Hans Castorp, dessen Neugier heftig mit seiner glühenden Müdigkeit kämpfte, zwang seine Augen, zu sehen und verweilte lange vor einem Herrenmodegeschäft, um festzustellen, daß die Auslage durchaus auf der Höhe sei.","It was now the city pavement on which they walked - the main street of an international meeting place, that was easy to see. They met spa guests strolling around, mostly young people, cavaliers in sports suits and without hats, ladies, also without hats and in white skirts. You could hear Russian and English speaking. Shops with ornate windows lined it to the right and left, and Hans Castorp, whose curiosity was struggling violently with his burning weariness, forced his eyes to look and lingered in front of a men's fashion shop for a long time to see that the display was quite up to par.","They were now walking on the city pavement, the main street, obviously, of an international centre. They met the guests of the cure, strolling about, young people for the most part: gallants in “sporting,” without their hats; white-skirted ladies, also hatless. One heard Russian and English. Shops with gay show-windows were on either side of the road, and Hans Castorp, his curiosity struggling with intense weariness, forced himself to look into them, and stood a long time before a shop that purveyed fashionable male wear, to decide whether its display was really up to the mark.","They were now walking on a city sidewalk—it was immediately apparent that this was the main street of an international resort. The strolling tourists they met were mostly young people, the gentlemen in sport coats and without hats, the ladies in white skirts and also without hats.

Hans Castorp’s curiosity was now seriously battling his flushed exhaustion, and forcing his eyes to take it all in, he lingered awhile outside a men’s clothing shore, just to make sure that his own wardrobe was up to snuff."

He was standing in the middle of the room, in his overalls, in his right hand the black ear-tape with which he was tapping his thigh.","“Come in,” called Behrens, stressing the first word.

"»Sehen Sie, Jüngling?« fragte er … Hans Castorp beugte sich über seine Schulter, hob aber noch einmal den Kopf, dorthin, wo im Dunkel Joachims Augen zu vermuten waren, die sanft und traurig blicken mochten, wie damals bei der Untersuchung, und fragte:","""You see, youth?"" he asked... Hans Castorp leaned over his shoulder, but raised his head again to where Joachim's eyes were to be expected in the dark, which might have looked soft and sad, as they had at the examination, and asked:","“Do you see it, young man?” he asked. Hans Castorp leaned over his shoulder, but then raised his head again to look toward the spot where Joachim’s eyes were presumably gazing in the darkness, with the gentle, sad expression they had worn during the other examination.","“Can you see it, my lad?” he asked. Hans Castorp bent down over his shoulder, but first looked up once more into the darkness, to where he assumed Joachim’s eyes were staring out, gentle and sad, just as on that day at his checkup."

"In flachem, steinigem Bett kam ein Bergwasser die rechtsseitige Höhe herab, ergoß sich schäumend über terrassenförmig gelagerte Blöcke und floß dann ruhiger gegen das Tal hin weiter, von einem Stege mit schlicht gezimmertem Geländer malerisch überbrückt. Der Grund war blau von den Glockenblüten einer staudenartigen Pflanze, die überall wucherte. Ernste Fichten, riesig und ebenmäßig von Wuchs, standen einzeln und in Gruppen auf dem Boden der Schlucht sowie die Höhen hinan, und eine davon, zur Seite des Wildbaches schräg im Gehänge wurzelnd, ragte schief und bizarr in das Bild hinein. Rauschende Abgeschiedenheit waltete über dem schönen, einsamen Ort. Jenseits des Baches bemerkte Hans Castorp eine Ruhebank.","A mountain stream came down the hill on the right-hand side in a flat, stony bed, poured foamingly over blocks laid out in terraces and then flowed more quietly towards the valley, picturesquely bridged by a footbridge with a simply timbered railing. The ground was blue from the bell-shaped flowers of a perennial plant that grew everywhere. Serious spruce trees, huge and regular in growth, stood alone and in groups on the floor of the ravine and on the heights, and one of them, rooted diagonally in the mountainside on the side of the torrent, towered crookedly and bizarrely into the picture. Roaring seclusion reigned over the beautiful, lonely place. On the other side of the stream, Hans Castorp noticed a bench.","A mountain stream came flowing in its shallow, stony bed down the right-hand slope, poured itself foaming over the terraced boulders lying in its path, then coursed more calmly toward the valley, crossed at this point by a picturesque railed wooden footbridge. The ground all about was blue with the bell-like blossoms of a profusely growing, bushy plant. Sombre fir-trees of even, mighty growth stood in the bed of the ravine and climbed its sides to the height. One of them, rooted in the steep bank at the side of the torrent, thrust itself aslant into the picture, with bizarre effect. The whole remote and lovely spot was wrapped in a sounding solitude by the noise of the rushing waters. Hans Castorp remarked a bench that stood on the farther bank of the stream.","From the slope on his right, a mountain stream swept along a flat, stony bed, then rushed foaming over terraced boulders in its path, and finally flowed more serenely toward the valley, crossed at that point by a picturesque wooden bridge with simple railings.

Dour spruces, symmetrical and gigantic, stood solitary and in small groups along the bottom of the gorge and farther up the slopes. One of them, rooted in the steep bank of the brook, jutted across the view at a bizarre angle. The murmur of isolation reigned above this beautiful, remote spot. Hans Castorp spied a bench on the far side of the brook."

"Das alles nun aber hatte also nicht gehindert, daß der Hospitant und weiche Neuling sich in der Liegekur (oder wie und wo nun immer) tüchtig erkältet hatte. Ein schwerer Schnupfen schien im Anzuge, er saß ihm in der Stirnhöhle und drückte, das Zäpfchen im Halse war weh und wund, die Luft ging ihm nicht wie sonst durch den von der Natur hierzu vorgesehenen Kanal, sondern strich kalt, behindert und Hustenkrampf unaufhörlich erregend hindurch; seine Stimme hatte über Nacht die Klangfarbe eines dumpfen und wie von starken Getränken verbrannten Basses angenommen, und seiner Aussage nach hatte er in eben dieser Nacht kein Auge zugetan, da eine erstickende Trockenheit des Schlundes ihn je und je hatte vom Kissen auffahren lassen.","But none of that had prevented the trainee and soft newcomer from catching a bad cold during the rest cure (or however and wherever). A bad runny nose seemed to be coming, it was in his frontal sinus and was squeezing, the uvula in his throat was sore and sore, his air did not go through the channel intended for this purpose as it usually does, but felt cold, obstructed and constantly aroused coughing spasms through; overnight his voice had taken on the timbre of a dull bass, as if burned by strong drink, and according to his testimony he had not slept a wink that very night, since a suffocating dryness in his throat had made him jump from his pillow time and time again.","All which had not prevented the guest and novice from catching a magnificent cold, either in the evening rest-cure or elsewhere. He felt the onset of catarrh, with oppression in the frontal sinus, and inflamed uvula; he could not breathe easily through the passage provided by nature; the air struck cold and painfully as it struggled through, and caused constant coughing. His voice took on overnight the tonal quality of a hollow bass the worse for strong drink. According to him, he had not closed an eye, his parched throat making him start up every five minutes from his pillow.","This, however, did not prevent the visitor, a frail novice at all this, from catching a very bad cold while outside in his rest cure—if that was where he caught it. A bad case of the sniffles appeared to be in the making. He felt it as a pressure in his sinuses; his throat and uvula were sore and scratchy; air didn’t pass normally through the channel prescribed by nature, but was impeded, and its steady cold draft unleashed fits of coughing; overnight his voice had taken on the hollow timbre of a whiskey bass; and as he told it, he had not slept a wink—he had kept starting up from his pillow because of the stifling dryness in his throat."

"Ohnehin hatte der gesellige Verkehr der Gruppe während der letzten Wochen gelitten unter dem Übelbefinden ihres Oberhauptes, des großartigen Pieter Peeperkorn, dessen maligne Tropenmitgift weder den Einwirkungen des außerordentlichen Klimas, noch den Antidoten eines so hervorragenden Mediziners, wie des Hofrat Behrens, hatte weichen wollen. Er war viel bettlägerig gewesen, nicht nur an Tagen, da das Quartanfieber in seine schlimmen Rechte trat. Milz und Leber machten ihm zu schaffen, wie der Hofrat die dem Patienten Nahestehenden abseits bedeutete; auch sein Magen sollte sich nicht in klassischer Verfassung befinden, und Behrens unterließ nicht, auf die auch bei einer so mächtigen Natur unter diesen Umständen nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisende Gefahr chronischer Entkräftung hinzudeuten.","In any case, the social intercourse of the group had suffered during the last few weeks from the ill health of its leader, the great Pieter Peeperkorn, whose malignant tropical dowry had refused to give way either to the effects of the extraordinary climate or to the antidotes of such an outstanding physician as Hofrat Behrens. He'd been bedridden a lot, not just on days when the quartan fever took hold of his dire rights. His spleen and liver bothered him as the privy councilor shunned those close to the patient; his stomach was also not supposed to be in the classic condition, and Behrens did not refrain from pointing out the danger of chronic exhaustion, which, even with such a powerful nature under these circumstances, cannot be completely dismissed.","The group had been less socially occupied of late weeks owing to the illness of its ruling spirit, the prepotent Pieter Peeperkorn. His fever refused to yield to the beneficent working of the climate or the skilled ministrations of so excellent a doctor as Hofrat Behrens. He was obliged to spend much time in bed, not only on the days when the quartan fever held sway, but on others too. There was trouble with his liver and spleen, Behrens told those who tended him; the digestion was not what it should be—in short, the Hofrat did not neglect to point out that the condition seemed to indicate a danger of chronic debility, not to be ignored.","As it was, for the last several weeks the group’s social activities had been restricted by the poor health of their chief, the great Pieter Peeperkorn, whose malign memento of the tropics refused to respond to either the exceptional climate or the antidotes prescribed by as excellent a physician as Director Behrens. He was frequently confined to his bed, and not just on the days when his quartan fever went about its foul work. His spleen and liver were giving him trouble, too, or so the director indicated whenever he pulled aside those closest to the patient; nor was his stomach in classic condition. And Behrens did not neglect to note that, under such circumstances, one could not entirely dismiss the risk of chronic debilitation in even the most robust constitution."
"»Na, höre mal, das ist doch stark!« rief er. »Fährt auf ihn los und sagt einfach zu ihm: ›Stellen Sie sich nicht so an!‹ Zu einem Sterbenden! Das ist doch stark! Ein Sterbender ist doch gewissermaßen ehrwürdig. Man kann ihn doch nicht so mir nichts, dir nichts … Ein Sterbender ist doch sozusagen heilig, sollte ich meinen!«","""Listen, that's strong!"" he exclaimed. “Runs on him and just says to him, 'Don't be such a fool!' To a dying man! That's strong! A dying man is, in a way, venerable. You can't do it like that for nothing... A dying man is holy, so to speak, I should think!'","“I say, that’s pretty steep,” he cried. “Goes at him like that, and simply tells him not to behave that way! To a dying man! But after all, a dying man has something in a way—sacred about him. One can’t just—perfectly coolly, like that—a dying man is sort of holy, I should think!”","“Listen here, that’s weighty stuff,” he cried. “Snaps his head off and says, ‘Don’t make such a fuss!’ To a dying man. Weighty stuff. A dying man deserves a certain amount of respect. You can’t just walk up to him so calm and cool and. . . . There’s something holy about a dying man, as it were—in my opinion.”"

"Settembrini feierte sie. Jener Schmach könne abgeholfen werden, sagte er froh. Die Menschheit sei aus Gründen der Zweckmäßigkeit wie auch bewogen durch ideelle Motive im Begriffe, ihr abzuhelfen. Und er erklärte sich für mitbeteiligt an den Vorbereitungen zu einem internationalen Kongreß für Feuerbestattung, dessen Schauplatz wahrscheinlich Schweden sein würde. Die Ausstellung eines musterhaften, gemäß aller bisher gemachten Erfahrung eingerichteten Krematoriums nebst Urnenhalle war geplant, und man durfte sich weitgreifender Anregungen und Ermutigungen davon versehen. Was für ein zopfig-obsoletes Verfahren, die Erdbestattung, – angesichts aller neuzeitlichen Umstände! Die Ausdehnung der Städte! Die Verdrängung der raumverzehrenden sogenannten Friedhöfe an die Peripherie! Die Bodenpreise! Die Ernüchterung des Bestattungsvorganges durch notwendige Benutzung der modernen Verkehrsmittel! Herr Settembrini wußte über dies alles nüchtern Treffendes vorzubringen. Er scherzte über die Figur des tiefgebeugten Witwers, der alltäglich zum Grabe der teuren Abgeschiedenen pilgerte, um an Ort und Stelle mit ihr Zwiesprache zu halten. Ein solcher Idylliker mußte vor allem am kostbarsten Lebensgute, nämlich der Zeit, sich eines befremdlichen Überflusses erfreuen, und übrigens würde der {689}Massenbetrieb des modernen Zentralfriedhofes ihm die atavistische Gefühlsseligkeit schon verleiden. Die Vernichtung des Leichnams durch Feuersglut, – welche reinliche, hygienische und würdige, ja heldische Vorstellung war das, im Vergleich mit derjenigen, ihn der elenden Selbstzersetzung und der Assimilation durch niedere Lebewesen zu überlassen! Ja, auch das Gemüt kam besser auf seine Rechnung bei dem neuen Verfahren, das menschliche Bedürfnis nach Dauer. Denn was im Feuer verging, das waren die überhaupt veränderlichen, die schon bei Lebzeiten dem Stoffwechsel unterworfenen Bestandteile des Körpers; diejenigen dagegen, die am wenigsten an diesem Strome teilnahmen und die den Menschen fast ohne Veränderung durch sein erwachsenes Dasein begleiteten, sie waren zugleich die feuerbeständigen, sie bildeten die Asche, und mit ihr sammelten die Fortlebenden das, was an dem Geschiedenen unvergänglich gewesen war.","Settembrini celebrated them. That disgrace could be remedied, he said happily. For reasons of expediency as well as motivated by ideal motives, mankind is about to remedy it. And he declared himself to be involved in the preparations for an international congress on cremation, the venue of which would probably be Sweden. The exhibition of a model crematorium, furnished according to all previous experience, together with an urn hall was planned, and one could expect far-reaching suggestions and encouragement from it. What a clumsy, obsolete procedure, burial - in view of all modern circumstances! The expansion of the cities! The displacement of the space-consuming so-called cemeteries to the periphery! The land prices! The disillusionment of the funeral process through the necessary use of modern means of transport! M. Settembrini was able to put forward all that was soberly appropriate about this. He joked about the figure of the bowed-down widower who daily made the pilgrimage to the grave of the dearly departed to converse with her on the spot. Above all, such an idyllic person had to enjoy a strange abundance of the most precious good in life, namely time, and incidentally the {689}mass operation of the modern central cemetery would spoil his atavistic sentimentality. Destroying the corpse with embers of fire—what a clean, hygienic, and dignified, indeed heroic idea that was compared to leaving it to miserable self-decomposition and assimilation by lower creatures! Yes, the mind, too, was better served by the new process, the human need for permanence. For what perished in the fire were the generally changeable components of the body that were already subject to metabolism during one's lifetime; On the other hand, those who took the least part in this flow and who accompanied the human being almost unchanged throughout his adult existence were at the same time the fire-resistant ones, they formed the ashes, and with them those who lived on collected what had been immortal about the departed.","Settembrini paid it homage. That indignity of corruption, he said, of which Naphta spoke, could by its means be redressed. On practical as well as on ideal grounds, mankind was now about to redress it. He explained that he was helping prepare for an international congress for the promotion of cremation, the scene of whose labours would probably be Sweden. A model crematorium would be exhibited, planned in accordance with the latest researches and experiments, with a hall of urns; they hoped to rouse widespread interest and enthusiasm. What an effete and obsolete procedure burial was, under our modern conditions—the price of land, the expansion of our cities and consequent shoving of the graveyards out on to the periphery! And the chop-fallen funeral processions, with their dignity curtailed by present-day traffic conditions! Herr Settembrini had plenty of disillusioning facts at his command. He made a droll picture of a grief-stricken widower on his daily pilgrimage to the graveside, to hold communion with the beloved departed; and said that the man must have a superfluity of that most precious of human commodities, time; and further, that the rush of business in a large modern burying-ground must surely dash his atavistic bliss. The destruction of the body by fire—what a cleanly, sanitary, dignified, yes, heroic conception that was, compared with abandoning it to the miserable processes of decay and assimilation by the lower forms of life! Yes, the newer method was more satisfying emotionally too, and kinder to the human longing after immortality. For what the fire destroyed was the more perishable part of the body, the elements which even during one’s life were got rid of by metabolism; whereas those which accompanied man through life, taking least share in the process of change, those became the ashes, and with them the survivors possessed the deceased’s imperishable part.","Settembrini applauded it. One could in fact remedy that ignominy, he said gaily. Both out of idealism, and for practical reasons, humankind was about to provide the remedy. And he explained that he was assisting in preparations for an international congress on cremation, which in all probability would be held in Sweden. Working from previous experience in the field, they were planning to construct a model crematorium and hall of urns, and the hope was that it would encourage further far-reaching developments. What a moldy, obsolete practice burial was! Cities were expanding; so-called memorial parks were being forced out to the periphery—wasting space and driving up the price of land. And what a disillusioning effect the necessary use of modern vehicles had on the funeral procession. Herr Settembrini had all sorts of apt, sensible remarks to make on the subject. He joked about the figure cut by a widower bent low with grief and making his daily pilgrimage to the graveside of his dear departed wife to converse with her there. To engage in such idyllic practices, a man had to have an amazing surplus of one of life’s most precious commodities: time. Not to mention the way the hustle and bustle in modern large cemeteries would spoil any atavistic sentimentality. The destruction of the body by fire—what a neat, hygienic, dignified, and indeed heroic idea that was in comparison with letting it decompose miserably on its own and be assimilated by lower forms of life. Yes, and even emotional needs—the human desire for immortality—did better by this new method. For what were lost in the flames were the body’s more mutable components, which even in life were burned up in the body’s metabolism; but those components that participated least in life’s steady flow and that accompanied human beings through their adult life almost without change, proved to be the most fireproof; they formed the ashes, and by collecting them, the survivors kept what was immortal about the deceased."
"»Das verbitte ich mir!« schrie er. »Ich bin erstens überhaupt kein Besitzer! Ich bin ein Angestellter hier! Ich bin Arzt! Ich bin nur Arzt, verstehen Sie mich?! Ich bin kein Kuppelonkel!

I’m not a pimp. I’m no Signor Amoroso on the Toledo, in Napoti bella. I am a servant of suffering humanity! And if either one of you should perchance have conceived a different opinion of me and my character then you can both go to the devil with my compliments—you can go to the dogs or you can turn up your toes, whichever you like, and a pleasant journey to you!”","“I won’t stand for it!” he shouted. “I don’t own anything here.

I serve suffering humanity. And if you have formed a different opinion of me, you can go to hell, to pot, or to the dogs—take your pick. Bon voyage!”"
"»Nichts weiter Neues … Ja, es war die reine Chemie, was er heute verzapfte«, ließ Joachim sich widerstrebend herbei, zu berichten. Es handele sich »dabei« um eine Art von Vergiftung, von Selbstvergiftung des Organismus, habe Dr. Krokowski gesagt, die so entstehe, daß ein noch unbekannter, im Körper verbreiteter Stoff Zersetzung erfahre; und die Produkte dieser Zersetzung wirkten berauschend auf gewisse Rückenmarkszentren ein, nicht anders, als wie es sich bei der gewohnheitsmäßigen Einführung von fremden Giftstoffen, Morphin oder Kokain, verhalte.","""Nothing else new ... Yes, it was pure chemistry what he did today,"" Joachim reluctantly condescended to report. Dr. Krokowski said that it arises when a still unknown substance in the body undergoes decomposition; and the products of this decomposition acted intoxicatingly on certain centers of the spinal cord, not unlike the habitual introduction of foreign poisons, morphine or cocaine.","“But what did he offer that was new?” “Nothing different.—Oh, well, the stuff to-day was pure chemistry,” Joachim unwillingly condescended to enlighten his cousin. It seemed there was a sort of poisoning, an auto-infection of the organisms, so Dr. Krokowski said; it was caused by the disintegration of a substance, of the nature of which we were still ignorant, but which was present everywhere in the body; and the products of this disintegration operated like an intoxicant upon the nerve-centres of the spinal cord, with an effect similar to that of certain poisons, such as morphia, or cocaine, when introduced in the usual way from outside.","“Nothing new, really . . . yes, well, he was selling basic chemistry today,” Joachim reluctantly and patronizingly reported. It was all about a kind of poisoning, about the organism poisoning itself, which, Dr. Krokowski had said, was the result of the decomposition of a certain, still-unidentified substance present throughout the body; the by-products of that decomposition had an intoxicating effect on certain centers in the spinal cord, not all that different from what happens when other poisons, such as morphine or cocaine, are introduced into the body."
"»Der ehrliche Ritter vom Winkelmaß!« höhnte Naphta. »Sie müssen bedenken, daß es ihm gar nicht leicht geworden ist, zum Bauplatz des Menschheitstempels zugelassen zu werden, denn er ist ja arm wie eine Kirchenmaus, und dort wird nicht nur höhere Bildung, humanistische Bildung, ich bitte sehr, verlangt, sondern man muß auch der bemittelten Klasse angehören, um die nicht geringen Aufnahmegebühren und Jahresbeiträge erschwingen zu können. Bildung und Besitz, – da haben Sie den Bourgeois! Da haben Sie die Grundfesten der liberalen Weltrepublik!«","""The honest knight of the square!"" sneered Naphta. “You have to consider that it was not at all easy for him to be admitted to the construction site of the Temple of Mankind, because he is poor as a church mouse, and there not only higher education, humanistic education, I beg you, is required, but one must also belong to the middle class in order to be able to afford the not insignificant admission fees and annual contributions. Education and possessions—there you have the bourgeois! There you have the foundations of the liberal world republic!«","“The noble knight of the T-square!” scoffed Naphta. “You must remember that it has been no easy matter for him to get admitted inside the gates of the temple of humanity. He is as poor as a church-mouse, and they not only demand the higher, the humanistic culture—save the mark—but also one must belong to the possessing classes, to be able to stand the dues and entrance fees. Culture and possessions—there is the bourgeoisie for you! There you have the pillars of the liberal world-republic.”","“The doughty Knight of the T-square!” Naphta scoffed. “You must realize that it was not all that easy for him to be admitted to the site where the temple of humanity is being built, because he’s as poor as a church mouse, and they not only demand higher education, humanistic education, but, beg your pardon, one must also be well-to-do just to afford the hefty initiation fees and annual dues. Education and property—behold the bourgeoisie! There you have the foundations of the liberal world republic!”"
"»Eine beweisbare Hypothese! Eine höchst fruchtbare Hypothese!« versetzte der Hofrat. »Sie werden sehen, wie fruchtbar sie ist, wenn auf unseren Kulturen die Kokken wachsen. Morgen nachmittag zapfen wir Sie an, Castorp; nach allen Regeln der Dorfbaderkunst lassen wir Sie zur Ader. Das ist ein Spaß für sich und kann allein schon für Körper und Seele die segensreichsten Effekte zeitigen …«","“A provable hypothesis! A most fruitful hypothesis!' replied the Hofrat. 'You'll see how fertile it is when the cocci grow on our cultures. Tomorrow afternoon we'll tap you, Castorp; according to all the rules of the art of village bathing, we will bleed you. This is fun in itself and can have the most beneficial effects on body and soul...""","“But a demonstrable hypothesis! A highly fruitful hypothesis!” the Hofrat responded. “You’ll see how fruitful it is, when the cocci begin to grow in our culture. To-morrow afternoon we’ll rap you; we’ll let your blood according to the sacred rites of the village barber. It’s diverting in itself, and may have miraculous results.”","“A provable hypothesis. A highly fertile hypothesis,” the director rejoined. “You will see just how fertile it is when the cocci start growing in our cultures. We’ll tap your keg tomorrow afternoon, Castorp. We’ll bleed a vein with all the style of the old village barber. It’s all kinds of fun, and can have the most blessed effects on both body and soul.”"
"Sobald aber etwa Herr Settembrini das Wort »Gerechtigkeit« ins Gespräch einführte, und dieses hohe Prinzip als vorbeugendes Mittel gegen innen- und außenpolitische Katastrophen empfahl, da zeigte es sich, daß Naphta, der kürzlich noch das Geistige für zu gut befunden hatte, als daß seine irdische Ausprägung je gelingen könne und solle, eben dies Geistige selbst unter Zweifel zu setzen und zu verunglimpfen bestrebt war. Gerechtigkeit! War sie ein anbetungswürdiger Begriff? Ein göttlicher? Ein Begriff ersten Ranges? Gott und Natur waren ungerecht, sie hatten Lieblinge, sie übten Gnadenwahl, schmückten den einen mit gefährlicher Auszeichnung und bereiteten dem anderen ein leichtes, gemeines Los. Und der wollende Mensch? Für ihn war Gerechtigkeit einerseits eine lähmende Schwäche, war der Zweifel selbst – und auf der anderen Seite eine Fanfare, die zu unbedenklichen Taten rief. Da also der Mensch, um im Sittlichen zu bleiben, stets »Gerechtigkeit« in diesem Sinne durch »Gerechtigkeit« in jenem Sinne korrigieren mußte, – wo blieben Unbedingtheit und Radikalismus des Begriffs? Übrigens war man »gerecht« gegen den einen Standpunkt oder gegen den anderen. Der Rest war Liberalismus, und kein Hund war heutzutage mehr damit vom Ofen zu locken. Gerechtigkeit war selbstverständlich eine leere Worthülse der Bürgerrhetorik, und um zum Handeln zu kom{1048}men, müsse man vor allen Dingen wissen, welche Gerechtigkeit man meine: diejenige, die jedem das Seine, oder diejenige, die allen das Gleiche geben wolle.","But as soon as Mr. Settembrini introduced the word ""justice"" into the conversation and recommended this high principle as a preventive measure against domestic and foreign political catastrophes, it became apparent that Naphta, who had recently found the spiritual to be too good to its earthly manifestation could and should ever succeed, to cast doubt on this spiritual itself and to denigrate it. Justice! Was she an adorable concept? A divine? A concept of the first rank? God and nature were unjust, they had favourites, they exercised mercy, adorned one with dangerous distinction and prepared an easy, mean lot for the other. And the willing man? For him, justice was on the one hand a paralyzing weakness, was doubt itself - and on the other hand a fanfare that called for harmless deeds. So since man, in order to remain moral, always had to correct ""justice"" in this sense by ""justice"" in that sense - where was the unconditionality and radicalism of the concept? Incidentally, one was ""fair"" to one point of view or to the other. The rest was liberalism, and no dog could be lured off the stove with it these days. Justice was, of course, an empty phrase in bourgeois rhetoric, and in order to take action, one must above all know which justice one is referring to: the one that wants to give everyone their own, or the one that wants to give everyone the same thing.","Herr Settembrini introduced the word justice into the discussion, and sought to apply this lofty principle as a preventive measure against political catastrophes both foreign and domestic. But as soon as he did so, Naphta, who just previously had found the spiritual too high ever to succeed in manifesting itself in material form, now set to work to cast doubts on, to derogate from, that very spiritual. Justice! Was it, as a conception, worth worshipping? Was it first-class? Was it of divine origin? God and Nature were not even-handed, they played favourites, they exercised the right of choice, they graced one individual with dangerous distinction, to another granted the easy common lot. And as for the man of action—for him justice was on the one hand a paralysing weakness, doubt itself, on the other a trumpet-call to unscrupulous deeds. And since, in order to remain within the moral code, such a man had always to correct “justice” in the second sense by “justice” in the first, where then was the Absolute, the radical, in the conception? Moreover, one was “just” according to one standard or according to the other. All the rest was liberalism—in which nobody nowadays took any stock. Justice, in short, was an empty husk, a stock-in-trade of bourgeois rhetoric; to get down to business, one had always to know which justice one was dealing with: the one which would give a man his own, or the one which would give everybody alike.","But the moment Herr Settembrini introduced the word “justice” into the conversation, recommending that high principle as the means by which to prevent catastrophes, both domestic and foreign, Naphta—who only a moment before had declared the spiritual as too good ever to find earthly expression worthy of it—endeavored to cast doubt on the very notion of the spiritual and to revile it. Justice—was that a concept worthy of our adoration? Something divine? An idea of the first order? God and nature were both unjust, they had their favorites, chose to be gracious at random, adorned one man with precarious honors and the next with an easy, but ordinary fate. And for the man who would act? For him justice was, on the one hand, a paralyzing weakness, the very essence of doubt, and on the other hand, it was a trumpet call to reckless deeds. In order to remain within the sphere of morality, man was constantly correcting one meaning of “justice” with the other—so how could there be anything absolute and radical about the concept? And in any case, one was “just” either on the basis of one given standpoint or on the basis of the other. The rest was liberalism, and no one was going to fall for that nowadays. Justice was, of course, one more empty husk of bourgeois rhetoric, and in order to act one first had to know, above all else, which justice was meant: the one that gave every man his due, or the one that was meted out equally to all."
"»Sie hängen an Ihrem Vetter, Hans Castorp?« fragte der Hofrat, indem er plötzlich des jungen Mannes Hand ergriff und ihn mit seinen blauen, weißlich bewimperten, blutunterlaufenen Quellaugen von unten anblickte …","""Are you attached to your cousin, Hans Castorp?"" asked the privy councilor, suddenly taking the young man's hand and looking at him from below with his blue, whitish, bloodshot, bulging eyes...","“You set great store by your cousin, Hans Castorp?” asked the Hofrat, as suddenly he gripped the young man’s hand, and looked at him with his blue, blood-veined, protruding eyes, under their white eyelashes.","“You’re fond of your cousin, aren’t you, Hans Castorp?” the director asked, suddenly grasping the young man’s hand and gazing down at him from his blue, bloodshot, protruding eyes with their white lashes."
"Allenfalls hätte man seinen Vortrag auf das Problem der Freiheit festlegen können, das er im Sinne der Verwirrung behandelte. Unter anderem sprach er von der Romantik und {1053}dem faszinierenden Doppelsinn dieser europäischen Bewegung vom Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts, vor der die Begriffe der Reaktion und der Revolution zunichte würden, sofern sie sich nicht zu einem höheren vereinigten. Denn es sei selbstverständlich höchst lächerlich, den Begriff des Revolutionären ausschließlich mit dem Fortschritt und der siegreich anrennenden Aufklärung verbinden zu wollen. Die europäische Romantik sei vor allem eine Freiheitsbewegung gewesen: antiklassizistisch, antiakademisch, gerichtet gegen den altfranzösischen Geschmack, gegen die Alte Schule der Vernunft, deren Verteidiger sie als gepuderte Perückenköpfe verhöhnt habe.","At best one could have focused his lecture on the problem of freedom, which he treated in the spirit of confusion. Among other things, he spoke of the romanticism and {1053}the fascinating ambiguity of this European movement from the beginning of the 19th century, before which the concepts of reaction and revolution would come to naught unless they united into a higher one. For it is, of course, highly ridiculous to want to associate the concept of the revolutionary exclusively with progress and the Enlightenment that is approaching victoriously. European romanticism was above all a freedom movement: anti-classical, anti-academic, directed against the old French taste, against the old school of reason, whose defenders derided them as powdered wig heads.","At any rate, we might take as the nucleus of his lecture the problem of freedom, which he treated in the sense of confusion. He spoke, among other matters, of the Romantic movement, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and its fascinating double meaning; pointing out how before it the conceptions of reaction and revolution went down, in so far as they were not incorporated in a new and higher one. For it was of course utterly absurd to try to associate the conception of revolution solely with progress and victoriously advancing enlightenment. The Romantic movement in Europe had been above all a movement of liberation: anti-classic, anti-academic, directed against French classicism, the old school of reason, whose defenders it derided as “powdered wigs.”","At best one could have seen his lecture as devoted to the problem of freedom, which he treated as the basis for confusion. Among other things, he spoke about Romanticism and the fascinating duality of this early nineteenth-century European movement, before which both reactionary and revolutionary ideas fell, that is, all those that were not synthesized to something higher still. For it was, of course, quite ridiculous to try to tie the concept of revolution exclusively to progress and a victoriously onrushing Enlightenment. European Romanticism was above all a movement of liberation: both anticlassical and antiacademic, directed against outmoded classicism, the old school of reason, whose defenders it scorned as powdered periwigs."
"Auch stellte sein Behagen sich völlig wieder her, als die dampfende Speise auf mehreren Platten erschien, kanariengelb und grün gesprenkelt, einen weichlich warmen Duft von Eiern und Butter im Zimmer verbreitend. Man griff zu, gemeinsam mit Peeperkorn und im Genuß überwacht von ihm, der mit abgerissenen Worten und zwingenden Kulturgebärden jedermann zu aufmerksamster, ja inbrünstiger Würdigung der Gottesgabe anhielt. Er ließ holländischen Genever dazu schenken, eine volle Runde, und zwang alle, das klare Naß, dem ein gesunder Duft nach Getreide mit einem zarten Einschlag von Wacholder entströmte, mit gespannter Andacht zu sich zu nehmen.","His comfort was fully restored, too, as the steaming dish appeared on several platters, mottled canary yellow and green, diffusing a soft, warm scent of eggs and butter through the room. People grabbed it, together with Peeperkorn and, with pleasure, watched over by him, who, with torn words and compelling cultural gestures, urged everyone to most attentively, even fervently, appreciate the gift of God. He ordered Dutch genever as a gift, a full round, and forced everyone to drink the clear water with rapt devotion.","His placidity was fully restored by the appearance of the steaming dishes, with their burden of canary-yellow besprent with green, which dispersed a mild warm fragrance of eggs and butter upon the air. They fell to with Peeperkorn, who ate and presided over the enjoyment, with broken words and compelling gesture enjoining upon everybody a perfervid appreciation of these gifts of God. He ordered a Hollands all round to go with the omelets; the transparent liquor gave out a healthy grain odour, mingled with just the faintest whiff of juniper—and Peeperkorn laid upon them all to drink it reverently.","And his general delight in things returned completely when several steaming dishes appeared—canary yellow sprinkled with green—spreading the bland odor of eggs and butter through the room. They helped themselves along with Peeperkorn, who presided over their enjoyment and with fragments of phrases and compelling, cultured gestures exhorted them to appreciate, indeed fervently to savor, these gifts of God. He ordered Dutch gin, a round for everyone, and insisted that they all approach it with eager devotion and partake of its clear dew, from which rose the robust aroma of grain and the faint whiff of juniper."

"»Ich?« antwortete die bloßarmige Kranke auf das »Du« … »Ja, {505}vielleicht«. Und allenfalls war in ihrem Lächeln und ihrer Stimme etwas von der Erregung, die auftritt, wenn nach langem, stummem Verhältnis die erste Anrede fällt, – einer listigen Erregung, die alles Vorangegangene in den Augenblick heimlich einbezieht. »Du bist sehr ehrgeizig … Du bist … sehr … eifrig«, fuhr sie in ihrer exotischen Aussprache mit fremdem r und fremdem, zu offenem e zu spotten fort, wobei ihre leicht verschleierte, angenehm heisere Stimme das Wort »ehrgeizig« auch noch auf der zweiten Silbe betonte, so daß es völlig fremdsprachig klang, – und kramte in ihrem Ledertäschchen, blickte suchend hinein und zog unter einem Taschentuch, das sie zuerst zutage gefördert, ein kleines silbernes Crayon hervor, dünn und zerbrechlich, ein Galanteriesächelchen, zu ernsthafter Tätigkeit kaum zu gebrauchen. Der Bleistift von damals, der erste, war handlich-rechtschaffener gewesen.","""Me?"" answered the bare-armed patient to the ""Du"" ... ""Yes, {505}perhaps"". And at most in her smile and her voice there was something of the excitement that occurs when the first address falls after a long, silent relationship - a cunning excitement that secretly includes everything that has gone before in the moment. ""You're very ambitious... You're... very... eager,"" she went on, in her exotic pronunciation of strange r and strange, overly overt e, scoffing, her slightly muffled, pleasantly hoarse voice adding the word ""ambitious"" to the stressed the second syllable so that it sounded completely foreign - and rummaged in her leather purse, looked inside and pulled out from under a handkerchief, which she first brought to light, a small silver crayon, thin and fragile, a gallantry purse, hardly for serious work to use. The pencil of that time, the first, had been more handy and upright.","She answered: “I? Perhaps I have, let me see.” Her voice and smile did betray an excitement, a consciousness—such as comes when the first word is uttered in a relationship long secretly sustained—a subtle consciousness, which concentrates all the past in a single moment of the present. “You are so eager—you are very ambitious”—she continued thus to mock him, in her slightly veiled, pleasantly husky voice, with her quaint pronunciation, giving a foreign sound to the r and making the vowels too open, even accenting the word ambitious on the first syllable, with exotic effect; rummaging and peering the while in her leather bag, whence she fetched out, first a handkerchief, and then a little silver pencil, slender and fragile, a pretty trinket scarcely meant for use—the other, the first one, had been something more to take hold of.","“Do you mean me?” the bare-armed patient replied, in response to the familiar pronoun in his question. “Yes, I might.” At most, her smile and voice suggested the kind of excitement that comes when the first words in a long, silent relationship are spoken at last—a subtle excitement secretly incorporating into this one moment everything that has happened until now. “You are very ambitious . . . You are . . . very . . . eager,” she said, likewise using personal pronouns, continuing to mock him in her exotic accent with its strange r and stranger open e, and stressing the word “ambitious” on the first syllable, so that in her opaque, pleasantly husky voice it sounded like a word from her mother tongue. She rummaged in her leather handbag, peered down into it, first pulled out a handkerchief, from which she then extracted a silver pencil-holder, a slight, fragile trinket, never intended for serious use. That pencil long ago, the first one, had been more straightforward, handier."
"Diesem Gefühle, rief Hans Castorp, habe bekanntlich auch {684}der Humanist Plotinus Ausdruck verliehen. Aber Herr Settembrini, die Hand aus dem Schultergelenk über den Kopf geworfen, forderte ihn auf, die Gesichtspunkte nicht zu vermengen und sich lieber rezeptiv zu verhalten.","As is well known, the humanist Plotinus also gave expression to this feeling, exclaimed Hans Castorp. But Mr. Settembrini, throwing his hand over his head from the shoulder joint, urged him not to mix up the points of view and rather to behave receptively.","The humanist Plotinus, exclaimed Hans Castorp, was also known to have given expression to the same idea. But Herr Settembrini flung up his hands and ordered the young man not to confuse two different points of view—and, for the rest, to be advised and maintain an attitude of receptivity.","The same feeling, as was well known, that the humanist Plotinus had expressed, Hans Castorp exclaimed.

"»Vettern?« fragte der Hofrat, indem er mit der Hand zwischen den jungen Leuten hin und her deutete und mit seinen blutunterlaufenen blauen Augen von unten blickte … »Na, will er denn auch zum Kalbsfell schwören?« sagte er zu Joachim und wies mit dem Kopf auf Hans Castorp … »I, Gott bewahre, – was? Ich habe doch gleich gesehen« – und er sprach nun direkt zu Hans Castorp –, »daß Sie so was Ziviles haben, so was Komfortables, – nichts so Waffenrasselndes wie dieser Rottenführer da. Sie wären ein besserer Patient als der, da möcht ich doch {74}wetten. Das sehe ich jedem gleich an, ob er einen brauchbaren Patienten abgeben kann, denn dazu gehört Talent, Talent gehört zu allem, und dieser Myrmidon hier hat auch kein bißchen Talent. Zum Exerzieren, das weiß ich nicht, aber zum Kranksein gar nicht. Wollen Sie glauben, daß er immer weg will? Immerzu will er weg, tirrt mich und plagt mich und kann es nicht erwarten, sich da unten schinden zu lassen. So ein Biereifer! Kein halbes Jährchen will er uns schenken. Und dabei ist es doch ganz schön hier bei uns, – nun sagen Sie mal selbst, Ziemßen, ob es nicht ganz schön hier ist! Na, Ihr Herr Vetter wird uns schon besser zu würdigen wissen, wird sich schon amüsieren. Damenmangel ist auch nicht, – allerliebste Damen haben wir hier. Wenigstens von außen sind manche ganz malerisch. Aber Sie sollten sich etwas mehr Couleur anschaffen, hören Sie mal, sonst fallen Sie ab bei den Damen! Grün ist ja wohl des Lebens goldner Baum, aber als Gesichtsfarbe ist grün doch nicht ganz das Richtige. Total anämisch natürlich«, sagte er, indem er ohne weiteres auf Hans Castorp zutrat und ihm mit Zeige- und Mittelfinger ein Augenlid herunterzog. »Selbstverständlich total anämisch, wie ich sagte. Wissen Sie was? Das war gar nicht so dumm von Ihnen, daß Sie Ihr Hamburg mal auf einige Zeit sich selbst überließen. Ist ja eine höchst dankenswerte Einrichtung, dieses Hamburg; stellt uns immer ein nettes Kontingent mit seiner feuchtfröhlichen Meteorologie. Aber wenn ich Ihnen bei dieser Gelegenheit einen unmaßgeblichen Rat geben darf – ganz sine pecunia, wissen Sie –, so machen Sie, solange Sie hier sind, mal alles mit, was Ihr Vetter macht. In Ihrem Fall kann man gar nichts Schlaueres tun, als einige Zeit zu leben wie bei leichter tuberculosis pulmonum und ein bißchen Eiweiß anzusetzen. Das ist nämlich kurios hier bei uns mit dem Eiweißstoffwechsel … Obgleich die Allgemeinverbrennung erhöht ist, setzt der Körper doch Eiweiß an … Na, und Sie haben schön geschlafen, Ziemßen? Fein, was? {75}Also nun mal los mit dem Lustwandel! Aber nicht mehr als ’ne halbe Stunde! Und nachher die Quecksilberzigarre ins Gesicht gesteckt! Immer hübsch aufschreiben, Ziemßen! Dienstlich! Gewissenhaft! Sonnabend will ich die Kurve sehen! Ihr Herr Vetter soll auch gleich mitmessen. Messen kann nie was schaden. Morgen, die Herren! Gute Unterhaltung! Morgen … Morgen …« Und Dr. Krokowski schloß sich ihm an, der weiter segelte, mit den Armen schlenkernd, die Handflächen ganz nach hinten gekehrt, indem er nach rechts und links die Frage richtete, ob man »schön« geschlafen habe, was allgemein bejaht wurde.","""Cousins?"" asked the Hofrat, waving his hand back and forth between the young people and looking down with his bloodshot blue eyes... ""Well, does he want to swear by the calfskin too?"" he said to Joachim and pointed with his head on Hans Castorp … “I, God forbid – what? I saw straight away' - and he was now speaking directly to Hans Castorp - 'that you have something civilian, something comfortable - nothing as rattling of arms as that squad leader over there. You'd be a better patient than him, I'd bet you {74}. I can tell by looking at everyone whether they can make a useful patient, because that takes talent, talent takes everything, and this Myrmidon here doesn't have a bit of talent either. For exercising, I don't know, but not for being ill. Do you want to believe that he always wants to leave? He always wants to get away, taunts me and bothers me and can't wait to be abused down there. Such a beer lover! He doesn't want to give us half a year. And yet it is quite nice here with us - now tell yourself, Ziemssen, whether it is not quite nice here! Well, your cousin will appreciate us better, he'll be amused. There is also no shortage of ladies – we have lovely ladies here. At least from the outside, some are quite picturesque. But you should get a little more Couleur, listen, otherwise you'll fall behind with the ladies! Green is certainly the golden tree of life, but green is not quite the right color for the face. Totally anemic, of course,' he said, walking up to Hans Castorp without further ado and pulling down one of his eyelids with his index and middle fingers. 'Totally anemic, of course, like I said. You know what? It wasn't so stupid of you to leave Hamburg to its own devices for a while. It's a very thankful institution, this Hamburg; always gives us a nice contingent with its boozy meteorology. But if I may take this opportunity to give you a little piece of advice-quite sine pecunia, you know-do whatever your cousin does while you're here. In your case, there is nothing smarter to do than live for a while, as in mild tuberculosis pulmonum, and put on a little albumen. That's strange here with us with the protein metabolism... Although the general combustion is increased, the body still puts on protein... Well, did you sleep well, Ziemßen? Fine what? {75}So let's get started with the stroll! But no more than half an hour! And then put the mercury cigar in your face! Always write it down nicely, Ziemßen! Official! Conscientious! Saturday I want to see the curve! Your cousin should also measure at the same time. Measuring can never hurt anything. Morning gentlemen! Good entertainment! Tomorrow... Tomorrow..."" And Dr. He was joined by Krokowski, who sailed on, arms flailing, palms all the way back, asking left and right if one had slept ""nicely,"" to which the general answer was yes.","“Cousins?” the Hofrat asked, motioning with his hand from one to the other of the two young men and looking at them with his bloodshot eyes. “Is he going to follow the drums like you?” he addressed Joachim, jerking his head at Hans Castorp. “God forbid, eh? I could tell as soon as I saw you”—he spoke now directly to the young man—“that you were a layman; there’s something civilian and comfortable about you, not like our sabre-rattling corporal here! You’d be a better patient than he is, I’ll wager. I can tell by looking at people, you know, whether they’ll make good patients or not; it takes talent, everything takes talent—and this myrmidon here hasn’t a spark. Maybe he shows up on the parade-ground, for aught I know; but he’s no good a’ being ill. Will you believe it, he’s always wanting to clear out! Badgers me all the time, simply can’t wait to get down there and be skinned alive. There’s doggedness for you! Won’t give us even a measly half-a-year! And yet it’s quite pretty up here ; I leave it to you if it isn’t, Ziemssen, what? ... Well, your cousin will appreciate us, even if you don’t. He’ll get some fun out of it. There’s no shortage in the lady market here, either; we have the most charming females. At least, some of them are very picturesque on the outside. But you ought to have better colour yourself, you know, if you want to please the sex. ‘The golden tree of life is green,’ as the poet says—but it’s a poor colour for the complexion, all the same. Totally anæmic, of course,” he broke off, and without more ado put up his index and middle fingers and drew down Hans Castorp’s eyelid. “ Precisely! Totally anæmic, as I was saying. You know it wasn’t such a bad idea of yours to let your native Hamburg shift for itself awhile. Great institution, Hamburg—simply revels in humidity—sends us a tidy contingent every year. But if I may take the occasion to give you the benefit of my poor opinion— sine pecunia, you understand, quite sine pecunia—I would suggest that you do just as your cousin does, while you are up here. You couldn’t turn a better trick than to behave for the time as though you had a slight tuberculosis pulmonum, and put on a little flesh. It’s curious about the metabolism of protein with us up here. Although the process of combustion is heightened, yet the body at the same time puts on flesh.—Well, Ziemssen, slept pretty well, what?. . . Splendid! Then get on with the out-of-doors exercise—but not more than half an hour, you hear? And afterwards stick the quicksilver cigar in your face, eh? And be good and write it down, Ziemssen! That’s a conscientious lad! Saturday I’ll look at the curve. Your cousin better measure too. Measuring can’t hurt anybody. Morning, gentlemen. Have a good time—morning— morning—” Krokowski joined him as he sailed off down the hall, swinging his arms palms backward, directing to right and left the question about sleeping well, which was answered on all sides in the affirmative.","“Cousins?” the director asked, gesturing with his hand, pointing now at one, now at the other, and looking down out of bloodshot blue eyes. “Well, is he going to march to the pipe and drum like you?” he asked Joachim, nodding his head toward Hans Castorp. “Ha, God forbid—right? I spotted it at once.” And now he spoke directly to Hans Castorp: “ There’s something so civilian, so comfortable about you—no rattling sabers like our corporal here. You would be a better patient than he , I’d lay odds on that. I can tell right off whether someone will make a competent patient or not, because that takes talent, everything takes talent, and this Myrmidon here hasn’t the least talent for it. For military drill, maybe, I can’t say as to that, but none for being ill. He constantly wants to leave, can you believe it? Forever asking to leave, pesters and badgers me and simply can’t wait to live a life of drudgery down below. What a zealot! Won’t give us six months of his time. Even though we have such a lovely place here—you must admit, Ziemssen, it is lovely here, isn’t it? Well, your good cousin will know better how to appreciate us, he’ll be able to amuse himself. There’s no shortage of ladies—we have the most adorable ladies here. Many of them quite picturesque—viewed externally, at least. But you’ll have to improve your color somewhat, too, otherwise the ladies will give you the cold shoulder. ‘The golden tree of life is green,’ true, but a green face is really not quite the thing. Totally anemic, of course,” he said, and mechanically stepped up to Hans Castorp, extended two fingers, and pulled an eyelid down. “No doubt of it, totally anemic, just as I said. Do you know what? It was not all that stupid of you to leave your Hamburg to fend for itself for a while. A highly commendable institution, your Hamburg. Always sends us a nice contingent, what with its intoxicatingly damp meteorology. But if I might use this opportunity to give you some modest advice—quite sine pecunia, of course—as long as you’re here with us, why don’t you do just what your cousin does? In a case like yours, there’s no wiser course than to live for a while as if it were a slight tuberculosis pulmonum, and build up your protein a little. It’s very curious , you see, the way protein is metabolized up here. Although one’s general metabolism increases, the body stores the protein. Well, and you slept well, did you, Ziemssen? Fine, fine. But now, do get on with your promenade! But no more than half an hour. And make sure you stick the old mercury cigar in your mouth afterward. And always jot down the results, right, Ziemssen? Conscientiously doing one’s duty. I’ll want to see your chart come Saturday. And your good cousin should measure, too. Measuring never hurts. Morning, gentlemen. Have a good time. Morning, morning . . .” And Dr. Krokowski joined him as he sailed off, swinging his arms, palms turned clear around to the back, tossing his question right and left as to whether people had slept well, which was universally answered in the affirmative."

"»Pfui Teufel! Ein Nachtspuk mit schönen Haaren. So etwas kannst du nicht leiden, was? Da kommst du und drehst das elektrische Licht an, sozusagen, um die jungen Männer auf den rechten Weg zu bringen, – tust du das nicht?« sagte Hans Castorp phantastisch. Er hatte ziemlich viel von der Weinmischung getrunken.","""Fuck the devil! A night spook with beautiful hair. You can't stand that, can you?

You would come along and turn on the electric light and bring the young men back to the path of virtue—that’s what you do, isn’t it?” Hans Castorp said whimsically. He had drunk rather freely of the mixed burgundy and champagne.","“Why, how disgusting! A wraith with beautiful hair. You simply can’t stomach things like that, can you?

"Auch Hans Castorp war aufgesprungen, und die Augen an die Person des Hofrats gefesselt, der, breitbeinig dastehend, offenen Mundes in Gedanken versunken schien, begann er, sich eilig in Bereitschaft zu setzen. Er überhastete sich, fand nicht gleich aus seinem punktierten Manschettenhemd heraus, als er es sich über den Kopf zog. Und dann stand er, weiß, {274}blond und schmal, vor Hofrat Behrens, – von zivilerer Bildung schien er als Joachim Ziemßen.","Hans Castorp had jumped up too, and with his eyes fixed on the person of the Hofrat, who was standing there with his legs apart and his mouth open, apparently lost in thought, he began to hurry to get himself ready. He rushed, not finding his way out of his polka-dot cuffed shirt as he pulled it over his head. And then he stood, white, blond and slim, in front of Hofrat Behrens - he seemed to have a more civil education than Joachim Ziemssen.","Hans Castorp had sprung up. With his eyes fixed on the Hofrat, standing there with his legs apart and his mouth open, lost in thought, the young man began in all haste to make ready, with the result that he defeated his own purpose and fumbled in getting out of his shirt. But finally he stood there, blond, white-skinned, and narrow-chested, before Hofrat Behrens. Compared with Joachim, he looked distinctly the civilian type.","Hans Castorp had sprung to his feet as well, and with his eyes fixed on the director, who stood there lost in thought— legs spread, mouth open—he began quickly to get ready himself. He was in too much of a hurry and had trouble getting out of his dotted, French-cuffed shirt, which he slipped over his head. And there he stood—white, blond, and narrow-chested—opposite Director Behrens. His figure certainly looked more civilian than Joachim Ziemssen’s."
"Alle verbeugten sich dankend gegen ihn, indem sie sich anschickten, nach Geheiß zu tun. Wer am Boden kauerte, sprang auf die Füße, wer auf dem Steggeländer saß, ließ sich herab. Der schmächtige Javaner in steifem Hut und Pelzkragen raffte die Reste des Mahls und das Geschirr zusammen. In derselben schmalen Ordnung, wie man gekommen, kehrte man auf dem feuchten Nadelwege, durch den von Flechtenbehang unkenntlich gemachten Wald zur Straße zurück, auf der die Wagen hielten.","All bowed their thanks to him, preparing to do as he was commanded. Those who crouched on the ground jumped to their feet, those who sat on the banister lowered themselves. The slight Javanese in a bowler hat and fur collar gathered up the remains of the meal and the dishes. In the same narrow order as you had come, you returned along the damp pine path, through the forest made unrecognizable by lichens, to the road where the wagons stopped.","They all bowed and thanked him as they hastened to do his bidding. Those crouching on the ground sprang up, the others jumped down from the railing. The little Javanese in his stiff hat and turned-up collar gathered the remnants of the meal. They went back along the path in the same order as they had come, through the draped, uncanny grove, to the high road and the waiting carriages.","They all bowed to thank him and made ready to obey his command. Those squatting on the ground sprang to their feet, those sitting on the bridge railing jumped down. The slight Javanese in his bowler and fur-collared coat gathered up the dishes and what was left of the meal. In the same tight order in which they had arrived, they now returned along the damp, needle-strewn path, and emerged from woods disfigured by lichen onto the road, where their carriages stood waiting."
"Und lachend, verwirrt, in der Aufregung der Ankunft und des Wiedersehens reichte Hans Castorp ihm Handtasche und Wintermantel, die Plaidrolle mit Stock und Schirm und schließlich auch »Ocean steamships« hinaus. Dann lief er über den engen Korridor und sprang auf den Bahnsteig zur eigentlichen und sozusagen nun erst persönlichen Begrüßung mit seinem Vetter, die sich ohne Überschwang, wie zwischen Leuten von kühlen und spröden Sitten, vollzog. Es ist sonderbar zu sagen, aber von jeher hatten sie es vermieden, einander beim Vornamen zu nennen, einzig und allein aus Scheu vor zu großer Herzenswärme. Da sie sich aber doch nicht gut mit Nachnamen anreden konnten, so beschränkten sie sich auf das Du. Das war eingewurzelte Gewohnheit zwischen den Vettern.","And laughing, confused, in the excitement of arriving and seeing each other again, Hans Castorp handed him his handbag and winter coat, the plaid roll with stick and umbrella, and finally ""Ocean steamships."" Then he ran down the narrow corridor and jumped onto the platform for the actual and, so to speak, only now personal greeting with his cousin, which took place without exuberance, as between people of cool and reserved manners. It is strange to say, but they had always avoided calling each other by their first names, purely out of fear of being too warm. However, since they weren't good at addressing each other by their last names, they limited themselves to the first form. This was an ingrained habit between the cousins.","And laughing, confused, in the excitement of arrival and meeting, Hans Castorp reached bag, overcoat, the roll with stick and umbrella, and finally Ocean Steamships out of the window.

Strange to say, the cousins had always avoided calling each other by their first names, simply because they were afraid of showing too much feeling. And, as they could not well address each other by their last names, they confined themselves, by established custom, to the thou.","And with a laugh that betrayed his confusion and excitement at having arrived and seeing his cousin again, Hans Castorp lifted out his valise and winter coat, his plaid blanket roll plus cane and umbrella, and finally Ocean Steamships.

Strangely enough, they had always avoided calling one another by their first names, purely out of fear of showing too much warmth of emotion. And since they could not very well address one another by their last names, they confined themselves to the use of familiar pronouns—now a deeply rooted habit between the two cousins."
"Das waren die Genen, die Bioblasten, die Biophoren, – Hans Castorp war erfreut, in der Frostnacht ihre namentliche Bekanntschaft zu machen. Nur fragte er sich in seiner Angeregtheit, wie es bei abermals verbesserter Beleuchtung um ihre Elementarnatur bestellt sein mochte. Da sie Leben trugen, mußten sie organisiert sein, denn Leben beruhte auf Organisation; wenn sie aber organisiert waren, so konnten sie nicht elementar sein, denn ein Organismus ist nicht elementar, er ist vielfach. Sie waren Lebenseinheiten unterhalb der Lebenseinheit der Zelle, die sie organisch aufbauten. Wenn dem aber so war, so mußten sie, obgleich über alle Begriffe klein, selber »aufgebaut«, und zwar organisch, als Lebensordnung, »aufgebaut« sein; denn der Begriff der Lebenseinheit war identisch mit dem des Aufbaues aus kleineren, untergeordneten, das hieß: zu höherem Leben geordneten Lebenseinheiten. Solange die Teilung organische Einheiten ergab, die die Eigenschaften des Lebens, nämlich die Fähigkeiten der Assimilation, des Wachstums und der Vermehrung besaßen, waren ihr keine Grenzen gesetzt. Solange von Lebenseinheiten die Rede war, {429}konnte nur fälschlich von Elementareinheiten die Rede sein, denn der Begriff der Einheit umschloß ad infinitum den Mitbegriff der untergeordnet-aufbauenden Einheit, und elementares Leben, also etwas, was schon Leben, aber noch elementar war, gab es nicht.","Those were the genes, the bioblasts, the biophores - Hans Castorp was delighted to make their acquaintance by name on the frosty night. Only in his excitement he wondered what their elemental nature might be like, with lighting improved again. Since they carried life, they had to be organized, for life depended on organization; but if they were organized, they could not be elementary, for an organism is not elementary, it is multiple. They were life-units below the life-unit of the cell that they organically built. But if that was the case, they had to be ""built up"" themselves, although small beyond all conceptions, and indeed organically, as a way of life, ""built up""; for the concept of the life unit was identical with that of building up from smaller, subordinate life units, that is, life units ordered to a higher life. As long as the division yielded organic entities possessing the qualities of life, viz., the abilities of assimilation, growth, and reproduction, there were no limits to it. As long as there was talk of units of life, {429} elementary units could only be spoken of incorrectly, because the concept of unity encompassed ad infinitum the concomitant concept of subordinate-constructive unity, and elementary life, i.e. something that was already life but still elementary , did not exist.","Those were the genes, the living germs, bioblasts, biophores—lying there in the frosty night, Hans Castorp rejoiced to make acquaintance with them by name. Yet how, he asked himself excitedly, even after more light on the subject was forthcoming, how could their elementary nature be established? If they were living, they must be organic, since life depended upon organization. But if they were organized, then they could not be elementary, since an organism is not single but multiple. They were units within the organic unit of the cell they built up. But if they were, then, however impossibly small they were, they must themselves be built up, organically built up, as a law of their existence; for the conception of a living unit meant by definition that it was built up out of smaller units which were subordinate; that is, organized with reference to a higher form. As long as division yielded organic units possessing the properties of life—assimilation and reproduction—no limits were set to it. As long as one spoke of living units, one could not correctly speak of elementary units, for the concept of unity carried with it in perpetuity the concept of subordinated, upbuilding unity; and there was no such thing as elementary life, in the sense of something that was already life, and yet elementary.","Those were the genes, the bioblasts, the biophores— Hans Castorp rejoiced in the frosty night to make their acquaintance by name. But even in his excitement, he asked himself just how elemental they might appear under better light. Since they were bearers of life, they had to be organized, because life was based on organization; but if they were organized, they could not be elemental, because an organism is not elemental, but multiple. They were living entities below the level of the cell that they built and organized. But if that was so, despite their incomprehensible smallness, they, too, as living entities had to be built out of something, had to be organized, structured organically. Because to be a living entity was by definition to be built out of smaller, subordinate entities, or better, out of entities organized to serve the higher form of life. There could be no limit to such division as long as it yielded organic entities—that is, those possessing the characteristics of life, in particular the ability to ingest, grow, and multiply. As long as one spoke of living entities, any discussion of elemental units was dishonest, because the concept of an entity carried with it, ad infinitum, the concept of the subordinate, organizing unit. There was no such thing as elemental life—that is, something that was both already life and yet elemental."

"War in dieser Nacht Hans Castorps Schlaf durch irgendwelche innere Bereitschaft, von der seine Seele nichts wußte, leicht und flüchtig gehalten worden, so daß die leiseste Abweichung vom gewohnten nächtlichen Frieden des Berghofhauses, eine noch so gedämpfte Unruhe, die kaum merkliche Erschütterung durch ein fernes Laufen, genügte, um ihn hell und wach zu machen und ihn sich in den Kissen aufsetzen zu lassen? Tatsächlich erwachte er längere Zeit bevor es an seine Tür klopfte, was kurz nach zwei Uhr geschah. Er antwortete sofort, unverschlafen, geistesgegenwärtig und energisch. Es war die hohe und ungefestigte Stimme einer im Hause beschäftigten Pflegeschwester, die ihn in Frau Chauchats Auftrag ersuchte, {943}sich sogleich im ersten Stockwerk einzufinden. Mit verstärkter Energie erklärte er seinen Gehorsam, sprang auf, fuhr in die Kleider, strich mit den Fingern das Haar aus der Stirn und ging nicht schnell und nicht langsam hinab, in Ungewißheit mehr über das Wie, als über das Was der Stunde.","Was Hans Castorp's sleep that night kept light and fleeting by some kind of inner readiness of which his soul knew nothing, so that the slightest deviation from the usual nocturnal peace of the Berghofhaus, an unrest no matter how subdued, the barely perceptible shock of a distant Running was enough to get him bright and awake and make him sit up in the pillows? In fact, he woke up well before there was a knock on his door, which happened just after two o'clock. He answered immediately, not asleep, quick-witted and energetic. It was the high, unsteady voice of a foster-sister employed in the house, who, on Frau Chauchat's behalf, asked him {943}to come to the first floor at once. With increased energy he declared his obedience, jumped up, put on his clothes, brushed his hair back from his forehead with his fingers and went down, neither fast nor slow, uncertain more about the how than about the what of the hour.","Was Hans Castorp’s sleep this night rendered light and fitful by portents of which his soul knew naught—so that the slightest variation in the usual nightly peace of the Berghof, the faintest commotion, the barely perceptible sound of running, was enough to fetch him broad awake, to make him sit up in bed? He had been, in fact, awake for some time before a knock came on his door, as it did shortly after two o’clock. He answered at once, composed, alert and energetic, and heard the voice of one of the nurses in the house, saying in high, uncertain tones that Frau Chauchat would be glad if he would come at once to the first storey. Briskly he responded, sprang up and flung on some clothing, ran his fingers through his hair, and went down; not slow, not fast, and more in uncertainty as to the how than the what, in the meaning of these summons.","Did Hans Castorp sleep more lightly, more fitfully that night because of some inner alertness of which his soul knew nothing? Certainly the slightest deviation from the Berghof’s customary nocturnal peace, the tiniest muffled disturbance, even the barely perceptible sound of someone moving in the distance, was enough to bring him wide awake and make him sit up in bed. He had been awake for a good while when there was a knock at his door; it was shortly after two. He answered at once—energetic, fully alert, not drowsy in the least. It was the high, quavering voice of one of the nurses employed by the sanatorium, who asked that he come immediately to the second floor at Frau Chauchat’s request. With even greater energy, he declared he would obey the call; he leapt out of bed, jumped into his clothes, brushed his hair from his brow with his fingers, and walked downstairs—not slowly, not quickly, uncertain less about what the hour would demand than how it would demand it."
"{337}»Aber das Fräulein ist krank!« sagte er. »Sie ist ja wahr- und wahrhaftig schwer krank und hat allen Grund, verzweifelt zu sein!

"Auch er mußte sehr bald den Schirm aufspannen; sowie man lag, wurde der Sonnenbrand unerträglich. Man lag aber ganz ungewöhnlich bequem, das stellte Hans Castorp sogleich mit Vergnügen fest, – er erinnerte sich nicht, daß ihm je ein so angenehmer Liegestuhl vorgekommen sei. Das Gestell, ein wenig altmodisch in der Form – was aber nur eine Geschmacksspielerei war, denn der Stuhl war offenbar neu –, bestand aus rotbraun poliertem Holz, und eine Matratze mit weichem, kattunartigen Überzug, eigentlich aus drei hohen Polstern zusammengesetzt, reichte vom Fußende bis über die Rückenlehne hinauf. Außerdem war vermittelst einer Schnur eine weder zu feste noch zu nachgiebige Nackenrolle mit gesticktem Leinenüberzug daran befestigt, die von besonders wohltuender Wirkung war. Hans Castorp stützte einen Arm auf die breite, glatte Fläche der Seitenlehne, blinzelte und ruhte, ohne »Ocean {105}steamships« zu seiner Unterhaltung in Anspruch zu nehmen. Durch die Bögen der Loggia gesehen, wirkte die harte und karge, aber hell besonnte Landschaft draußen gemäldeartig und wie eingerahmt. Hans Castorp betrachtete sie gedankenvoll. Plötzlich fiel ihm etwas ein, und er sagte laut in der Stille: »Es war ja eine Zwergin, die uns beim ersten Frühstück bediente.«","He, too, soon had to put up his umbrella; as soon as one lay down, the sunburn became unbearable. But one was lying quite unusually comfortably, as Hans Castorp immediately discovered with pleasure - he did not remember that such a comfortable lounge chair had ever happened to him. The frame, a little old-fashioned in form - but that was just a tidbit of taste, for the chair was evidently new - was of reddish-brown polished wood, and a mattress with a soft calico covering, actually made up of three high pillows, stretched from the foot end up over the backrest. In addition, a bolster with an embroidered linen cover, which was neither too firm nor too flexible, was fastened to it by means of a cord, which had a particularly beneficial effect. Hans Castorp rested an arm on the broad, smooth surface of the armrest, blinked, and rested, not using ""Ocean {105}steamships"" for his entertainment. Seen through the arches of the loggia, the hard and barren, but brightly sunlit landscape outside looked like a painting and framed. Hans Castorp regarded her thoughtfully. Suddenly something occurred to him, and he said aloud in the silence, ""It was a dwarf who served us at our first breakfast.""","Soon he too had to put up the little sunshade; the heat became unbearable as he lay. But he was uncommonly comfortable, he decided, with distinct satisfaction. He did not recall in all his experience so acceptable an easy-chair. The frame—a little oldfashioned, perhaps, a mere matter of taste, for the chair was obviously new—was of polished red-brown wood, and the mattress was covered in a soft cotton material; or rather, it was not a mattress, but three thick cushions, extending from the foot to the very top of the chair-back. There was a head-roll besides, neither too hard nor too yielding, with an embroidered linen cover, fastened on by a cord to the chair, and wondrously agreeable to the neck. Hans Castorp supported his elbow on the broad, smooth surface of the chair-arm, blinked, and reposed himself. The landscape, rather severe and sparse, though brightly sunny, looked like a framed painting as viewed through the arch of the loggia. Hans Castorp gazed thoughtfully at it. Suddenly he thought of something, and said aloud in the stillness: “That was a dwarf, wasn’t it, that waited on us at breakfast?”","But he soon had to put up his sunshade, the blazing glare was unbearable the moment you lay down. Still it was terribly pleasant just to lie there, Hans Castorp discovered at once to his delight—he could not remember ever having used a more comfortable lounge chair. The frame, a little old-fashioned in design—but that was only a stylish touch, really, since the chair was obviously new—was made of polished reddish-brown wood, and the mattress, covered with a soft cottonlike fabric, actually consisted of three thick cushions that reached from the foot of the chair up over the back. And then, attached to a string and slipped into an embroidered linen case was a roll for your neck, neither too firm nor too soft, and it simply worked wonders. Hans Castorp propped one elbow on the broad, smooth surface of the chair arm, and lay there blinking, not even bothering to entertain himself with Ocean Steamships. Seen through the arches of the balcony, the hard, barren landscape lay under the bright sun like a framed painting. Hans Castorp regarded it pensively. Suddenly it came to him—and he said aloud into the silence, “That was a dwarf who served us at breakfast.”"

"»Was liegt daran?« sagte er. »Wir sollten danach nicht fragen, da man auch damals, als es entstand, nicht danach fragte. Das hat keinen wunderwie individuellen Monsieur zum Autor, es ist anonym und gemeinsam. Es ist übrigens sehr vorgeschrittenes Mittelalter, Gotik, Signum mortificationis. Sie finden da nichts mehr von der Schonung und Beschönigung, mit der noch die romanische Epoche den Gekreuzigten darstellen zu müssen glaubte, keine Königskrone, keinen majestätischen Triumph über Welt und Martertod. Alles ist radikale Verkündigung des Leidens und der Fleischesschwäche. Erst der gotische Geschmack ist der eigentlich pessimistisch-asketische. Sie werden die Schrift Innozenz des Dritten, ›De miseria humanae conditionis‹, nicht kennen, – ein äußerst witziges Stück Literatur. Sie stammt vom Ende des zwölften Jahrhunderts, aber erst diese Kunst liefert die Illustrationen dazu.«","""What does it matter?"" he said. “We shouldn't ask about it, because nobody asked about it when it was written. It's not authored by a wonderfully individual Monsieur, it's anonymous and collective. Incidentally, it is very advanced Middle Ages, Gothic, signum mortificationis. You will no longer find anything of the gentleness and embellishment with which the Romanesque epoch believed it was necessary to portray the crucified, no royal crown, no majestic triumph over the world and martyrdom. Everything is radical proclamation of suffering and weakness of the flesh. Only the Gothic taste is really pessimistic and ascetic. You will not be familiar with Innocent III's De miseria humanae conditionis, a most witty piece of literature. It dates from the end of the twelfth century, but only this art provides the illustrations for it.«","“What does it matter?” he said. “We should not ask—for in the time when it was made they never did. It was not created by some wonderful and well-advertised single genius. It is an anonymous product, anonymous and communal. Moreover, it is very advanced Middle Ages—Gothic, signum mortificationis. No more of the palliating and beautifying that the Roman epoch thought proper to a depiction of the Crucifixion: here you have no royal crown, no majestic triumph over martyrdom and the world. It is the most utter and radical declaration of submission to suffering and the weakness of the flesh. Pessimistic and ascetic—it is Gothic art alone which is truly that. You are probably not familiar with the work of Innocent III, De miseria humanæ conditionis: an exceedingly witty piece of writing—it was written at the end of the twelfth century, but this was the earliest art to furnish an illustration to it.”","“What does it matter?” he said. “We should not even ask, because at the time it was created no one asked, either. There is no miracle-worker, no Mr. Individual Creator behind it —it is an anonymous, communal work of art. It comes, of course, from the very advanced Middle Ages, the Gothic—signum mortificationis. You’ll not find the crucifixion glossed over and prettified here, the way the Romanesque period thought it best to deal with things—no kingly crown, no majestic triumph over the world and martyrdom. The entire work is a radical proclamation of suffering and the weakness of the flesh. It is not until the Gothic that tastes turn to true pessimistic asceticism. You’re probably unfamiliar with De miseria humanae conditionis by Innocent the Third—a very witty literary work, from the end of the twelfth century. But only later did this sort of art provide the illustrations for it.”"

"Sieben Tische standen im Speisesaal, die meisten in Längsrichtung, nur zwei in die Quere. Es waren größere Tafeln, für zehn Personen jede, wenn auch die Gedecke nicht überall vollzählig waren. Nur ein paar Schritte schräg in den Saal hinein, und Hans Castorp war schon an seinem Platz: er war ihm an der Schmalseite des Tisches bereitet, der mitten vorn stand, zwischen den beiden querstehenden. Aufrecht hinter seinem Stuhle, verbeugte Hans Castorp sich steif und freundlich gegen die Tischgenossen, mit denen Joachim ihn zeremoniell bekannt machte, und die er kaum sah, geschweige, daß ihm ihre Namen ins Bewußtsein gedrungen wären. Einzig Frau Stöhrs Person und Namen faßte er auf, und daß sie ein rotes Gesicht und fettige aschblonde Haare hatte. Man konnte ihr die Bildungsschnitzer wohl zutrauen, so störrisch unwissend war ihr Gesichtsausdruck. Dann setzte er sich und nahm beifällig wahr, daß man das erste Frühstück hier als eine ernste Mahlzeit behandelte.","There were seven tables in the dining room, most of them lengthwise, only two across.

Standing upright behind his chair, Hans Castorp bowed stiffly and politely to the table companions, to whom Joachim ceremonially introduced him, and whom he scarcely saw, let alone that their names had penetrated his consciousness. All he understood was Frau Stohr's person and name, and that she had a red face and greasy, ash-blonde hair. One could well credit her with the educational blunders, her facial expression was so stubbornly ignorant. Then he sat down and noted with approval that the first breakfast here was treated as a serious meal.","There were seven tables, all but two of them standing lengthwise of the room.

A few steps diagonally into the room, and they stood at their places; Hans Castorp’s was at the end of a table placed between the two crosswise ones. Erect behind his chair, he bowed stiffly but amiably to each table-mate in turn, as Joachim formally presented him; hardly seeing them, much less having their names penetrate his mind. He caught but a single name and person—Frau Stöhr, whom he perceived to have a red face and greasy ash-blond hair. Looking at her he could quite credit the malapropisms Joachim told of. Her face expressed nothing but ill-nature and ignorance. He sat down, observing as he did so that early breakfast was taken seriously up here.","There were seven tables in the dining hall, five placed lengthwise, only two crosswise. The tables were large, with room for ten persons at each, although not all the places had been set. They took only a few steps diagonally across the room, and Hans Castorp found that he was already at the place set for him, at the end of the middle table toward the front of the room, halfway between the two crosswise tables. Standing erect behind his chair, Hans Castorp bowed stiffly and cordially to his tablemates as Joachim formally introduced them, although he barely looked at them, let alone made a conscious note of their names. The only face and name he put together was Frau Stöhr, noticing her red face and oily, ash-blond hair, and an expression of such willful ignorance that it was easy to believe her guilty of howling gaffes. Then he sat down and noted approvingly that early breakfast here was a serious meal."

"Er ließ ihn liegen, suchte über die Halde hin, wo der Schuppen stand, seinen Rückweg. Aber ein Weg war ja nicht vorhanden; eine Richtung zu halten, die ungefähre Richtung nach Hause, ins Tal, war weit mehr Glücks- als Verstandessache, da man allenfalls die Hand vor Augen, aber nicht einmal bis zu den Spitzen seiner Schneeschuhe sah; und hätte man auch besser gesehen, so wären doch immer noch ausgiebige Vorkehrungen getroffen gewesen, ein Vorwärtskommen aufs äußerste zu erschweren: das Gesicht voll Schnee, den Sturm als Widersacher, der die Atmung zerstörte, sie abschnitt, das Aufnehmen von Luft wie den Aushauch verhinderte und jeden Augenblick zu schnappender Abkehr zwang, – da sollte dieser und jener vorwärts kommen, Hans Castorp oder ein anderer, Stärkerer, – man blieb stehen, schnappte, drückte sich blinzelnd das Wasser aus den Wimpern, klopfte den Harnisch von Schnee herunter, der sich einem auf die Frontseite gelegt hatte, und empfand es als unvernünftige Zumutung, unter solchen Umständen vorwärts zu kommen.","He left it lying there, looking for his way back across the heap where the shed stood. But there was no way; keeping one direction, the approximate direction home, down the valley, was far more a matter of luck than wits, since you could at best see your hand in front of your face, but not even to the tips of your snowshoes; and if one had seen better, extensive precautions would still have been taken to make progress extremely difficult: the face full of snow, the storm as an adversary, which destroyed breathing, cut it off, prevented taking in air and preventing exhalation and forced to snap away at every moment - here and there should come forward, Hans Castorp or someone else, stronger - you stopped, snapped, blinked the water out of your eyelashes, knocked off the armor of snow that was put one on the front and found it an unreasonable impertinence to advance under such circumstances.","He left it behind, and sought his way back over the slope on which it stood. But there was no path. To keep direction, relatively speaking, into his own valley would be a question far more of luck than management; for while he could see his hand before his face, he could not see the ends of his skis. And even with better visibility, the host of difficulties must have combined to hinder his progress: the snow in his face, his adversary the storm, which hampered his breathing, made him fight both to take a breath and to exhale it, and constantly forced him to turn his head away to gasp. How could anyone—either Hans Castorp or another and much stronger than he— make head? He stopped, he blinked his lashes free of water drops, knocked off the snow that like a coat of mail was sheathing his body in front—and it struck him that progress, under the circumstances, was more than anyone could expect.","He skied past the shed, trying to find his way back across the open slope where it stood. But there was no way; to keep to one direction, the approximate direction of home and the valley, was more a matter of luck than sense, because although he could sometimes just make out his hand in front of his face, he never once saw the tips of his skis; and had he been able to see better, there were still plenty of other impediments to frustrate his progress: snow full in the face, a storm as an adversary that robbed you of air and constantly forced you to turn and snatch for a breath—how could any man, be he Hans Castorp or someone much stronger, have made any progress here? He stopped, gasped, blinked to squeeze the water out of his eyelashes, knocked away the coat of snowy armor that encased the front of his body—and realized that under these circumstances, it was unreasonable even to hope for progress."
"Nicht doch, so weit wollte Hans Castorp nicht gehen. Er unterwarf sich der Kur, obgleich er sie ridikül und ehrlos fand. Diese Impfungen mit sich selbst wollten ihm als eine abscheulich freudlose Diversion erscheinen, als ein inzestuöser Greuel von Ich zu Ich, frucht- und hoffnungslos in seinem Wesen. So urteilte seine hypochondrische Unbelehrtheit, die nur im Punkte der Unfruchtbarkeit – und in diesem freilich vollkommen – recht behielt. Die Diversion erstreckte sich über Wochen. Sie schien zuweilen zu schaden – was selbstverständlich auf Irrtum beruhen mußte –, zuweilen auch zu nützen, was sich dann aber gleichfalls als Irrtum herausstellte. Das Ergebnis war Null, ohne bei Namen genannt und ausdrücklich verkündigt zu werden. Die Unternehmung verlief im Sande, und Hans Castorp fuhr fort, Patience zu legen – Aug’ in Auge mit dem Dämon, dessen zügelloser Herrschaft für sein Gefühl ein Ende mit Schrecken bevorstand.","No, Hans Castorp didn't want to go that far. He submitted to the cure, although he found it ridiculous and dishonorable. These inoculations with himself wanted to appear to him as a hideously joyless diversion, an incestuous ego-to-ego abomination, fruitless and hopeless in his essence. That was the judgment of his hypochondriac ignorance, which was only right on the point of infertility – and in this, of course, completely. The diversion lasted for weeks. Sometimes it seemed to do harm - which of course had to be based on error - and sometimes to help, which then also turned out to be an error. The result was zero, without being named and expressly proclaimed. The venture fizzled, and Hans Castorp continued to play solitaire face-to-face with the demon whose rampant rule he felt was ending in terror.","Hans Castorp could not go quite that far. He submitted to the treatment, though he found it absurd, contemptible. This inoculation of himself with part of himself seemed a singularly cheerless procedure, an incestuous abomination, a self-to-self which could have nothing but a fruitless, hopeless result. Such was his ignorant and hypochondriac judgment, right only as to the unfruitfulness of the result, but there wholly. The diversion lasted for weeks. Sometimes it seemed to do harm—which was of course not the case—sometimes good, which, it followed, must equally not be the case. The result was negative—without being explicitly so called and announced. The whole undertaking died a natural death, and Hans Castorp went on playing patience— and gazing into the eye of the demon, whose unbridled sway he foresaw would come to an end of horror.","Well, Hans Castorp was not willing to go quite that far. But he submitted to the therapy, though he found it ridiculous and disgraceful. These vaccinations of himself with himself could be no more than a disgustingly joyless diversion, a self-to-self incestuous abomination, an infertile, hopeless enterprise inside his own body. That was the voice of ignorant hypochondria, which proved correct only as to infertility—though, to be sure, completely correct in that one point. The diversion lasted several weeks. At times it seemed to make him ill—though, of course, he had to be in error about that—at times it seemed to help; but that turned out to be an error as well. The result was zero, though that was never expressly announced. The enterprise fizzled out, and Hans Castorp went on playing solitaire—eye to eye with the demon whose unrestrained power he could not help feeling was sure to come to some horrible end."
"Dabei jedoch war gar kein Vergnügen, denn man sah nichts vor Flockentanz, der scheinbar ohne zu fallen in dichtestem Wirbelgedränge allen Raum erfüllte; die dreinfahrenden Eisböen machten die Ohren mit scharfem Schmerze brennen, {727}lähmten die Glieder und ließen die Hände ertauben, so daß man nicht mehr wußte, ob man den Pickelstock noch hielt oder nicht. Der Schnee wehte ihm hinten in den Kragen und schmolz ihm den Rücken hinunter, legte sich ihm auf die Schultern und bedeckte seine rechte Flanke; es war ihm, als solle er hier zum Schneemann erstarren, seinen Stock steif in der Hand; und all diese Unzuträglichkeit ergab sich bei vergleichsweise günstigen Umständen: wendete er sich, so würde es schlimmer sein; und doch hatte der Heimweg sich zu einem Stück Arbeit gestaltet, das in Angriff zu nehmen er wohl nicht zögern sollte.","But it was no fun at all, because you couldn't see anything but the dance of flakes, which filled the whole room in a dense whirlwind crowd, apparently without falling; the coming ice gusts made the ears burn with sharp pain, {727}paralyzed the limbs and left the hands deaf, so that one no longer knew whether one was still holding the pickaxe or not. The snow blew up the back of his collar and melted down his back, settled on his shoulders and covered his right flank; he felt as if he were about to turn into a snowman, his stick stiff in his hand; and all this inconvenience came under comparatively favorable circumstances: if he turned it would be worse; and yet the way home had turned out to be a piece of work that he should not hesitate to undertake.","It was no joke. There was almost nothing to be seen for swimming snow-flakes, that seemed without falling to fill the air to suffocation by their whirling dance. The icy gusts made his ears burn painfully, his limbs felt half paralysed, his hands were so numb he hardly knew if they held the staff. The snow blew inside his collar and melted down his back. It drifted on his shoulders and right side; he thought he should freeze as he stood into a snowman, with his staff stiff in his hands. And all this under relatively favouring circumstances; for let him turn his face to the storm and his situation would be still worse. Getting home would be no easy task—the harder, the longer he put it off.","There was certainly no pleasure in this, however. All he could see were dancing flakes, which seemed not to fall but simply to fill the air in a throng of dense eddies; the icy blasts singed his ears with sharp pain, took the strength from his legs, and numbed his hands, until he no longer knew if he was holding his poles or not. The snow blew into his collar and melted down his back, it flung itself across his shoulders and pelted his right side; he felt as if he were turning into a snowman, a pole held stiff in each hand. But as unbearable as these conditions were, they were mild by comparison, for when he turned around things only got worse. And yet the return home had now become a task he could probably put off no longer."

""By the way, how much is it?""","“You don’t say!” Behrens cried out. “I suppose you think you are telling me news? Do you think I’ve no eyes in my head?” He pointed with his great index finger to his goggling, bloodshot, watery eyes. “Well, and how much?”","“You don’t say!” Behrens exclaimed. “And I suppose you think that’s news to me, do you?

"»Jedenfalls war es eine Abwechslung«, erwiderte Joachim. »Und ausgesprochen habt ihr euch ja über mancherlei Dinge bei dieser Gelegenheit, das muß man sagen. Mir ging es sogar ein bißchen zu sehr drüber und drunter. Es ist nun hohe Zeit, daß wir vorm Tee doch wenigstens noch auf zwanzig Minuten in den Liegedienst kommen. Du findest es vielleicht ete-pe-tete von mir, daß ich so darauf halte, – durchgängerisch, wie du neuerdings bist. Aber du hast es ja schließlich auch nicht so nötig wie ich.«","""Anyway, it was a change,"" Joachim replied. “And you spoke out about a number of things on this occasion, I have to say that. I was even a little too haywire. It's high time we got at least twenty minutes into lying down before tea. You might think it's ete-pe-tete of me that I insist on it so much - casual as you are lately. But after all, you don't need it as much as I do.""","“It was a change, at least,” responded Joachim. “And you certainly took occasion to air your views on a good many subjects. It was a bit complicated for me. It is high time now that we went in to the rest-cure, we shall have at least twenty minutes before tea. You probably think it is folderol to pay so much attention to it, now you’ve taken to kicking over the traces. But you don’t need it so much as I do, after all.”","“It was a change of pace at any rate,” Joachim replied. “And you two certainly did use the occasion to discuss a lot of things, I must say. It was all a little haphazard for me. But it’s high time we went off to our rest cure—twenty minutes at most until tea. You’ll find it a little namby-pamby of me to insist on it, I suppose—now that you’ve taken to kicking over the traces. But then you don’t need your rest cure as badly as I need mine.”"

"Hans Castorp nahm den Verblichenen in Augenschein. Er tat es aus Trotz gegen das herrschende System der Verheimlichung, weil er das egoistische Nichts-wissen-, Nichts-sehen-und-hören-wollen der andern verachtete und ihm durch die Tat zu widersprechen wünschte. Bei Tische hatte er den Todesfall zur Sprache zu bringen versucht, war aber auf einmütige und so verstockte Ablehnung dieses Themas gestoßen, daß es ihn beschämt und empört hatte. Frau Stöhr war geradezu grob geworden. Was ihm einfalle, von so etwas anzufangen, hatte sie gefragt, und was er denn eigentlich für eine Kinderstube genossen. Die Ordnung des Hauses schütze sie, die Patientenschaft, sorgfältig davor, von solchen Geschichten berührt zu werden, und da komme nun so ein Grünschnabel und rede ganz laut davon, noch dazu beim Braten und dazu wieder in Gegenwart des Dr. Blumenkohl, den es täglich ereilen könne. (Dies hinter der Hand.) Wiederhole sich das, so werde sie klagbar werden. Da war es, daß der Gescholtene den Entschluß gefaßt und ihm auch Ausdruck verliehen hatte, für seine Person {443}dem abgeschiedenen Hausgenossen durch einen Besuch und stille Andachtsverrichtung an seinem Lager die letzte Ehre zu erweisen, und auch Joachim hatte er bestimmt, das zu tun.","Hans Castorp examined the deceased. He did it out of defiance of the prevailing system of secrecy, because he despised the egoistic non-knowledge, non-seeing-not-hearing-not-wanting of others and wished to contradict it by his actions. At the table he had tried to raise the matter of death, but had met with a unanimous rejection of the subject, so stubborn that it had shamed and outraged him. Frau Stohr had become downright rude. What did he think of starting with something like that, she had asked, and what sort of upbringing did he actually enjoy. The order in the house carefully protects them, the patients, from being touched by such stories, and here comes a greenhorn and talks about it very loudly, over the roast and again in the presence of Dr. Cauliflower, which could overtake it every day. (This behind the hand.) If that happens again, she will be sued. It was then that the one being scolded made the decision and also gave expression to it, to pay his last respects to the departed member of the household by a visit and quiet devotional service at his bedside, and he had also determined Joachim to do the same to do.","Hans Castorp went to view the gentleman rider’s mortal remains. He did this of set purpose, to show his contempt for the prevailing system of secrecy, to protest against the egotistic policy of seeing and hearing nothing of such events; to register by his act his disapproval of the others’ practice. He had tried to introduce the subject of the death at table, but was met with such a flat and callous rebuff on all sides as both to anger and embarrass him. Frau Stöhr had been downright gruff. What did he mean by introducing such a subject—what kind of upbringing had he had? The house regulations protected the patients from having such things come to their knowledge; and now here was a young whipper-snapper bringing it up at table, and even in the presence of Dr. Blumenkohl, whom the same fate might any day overtake (this behind her hand). If it happened again, she would complain. Then it was that, thus reproved, Hans Castorp had taken—and expressed—a resolve: he would visit their departed comrade, and discharge the last duty of silent respect toward his remains. He persuaded Joachim to do the same.","Hans Castorp made a personal inspection of the deceased. He did so in open defiance of the institutional practice of concealment; he despised the egotism of all the others, who did not want to know, hear, or see anything, and hoped to reproach them with this act. He had tried to bring up the subject of this latest death with his tablemates, but had been met by a unanimous rebuff so sullen that he felt both chagrined and outraged. Frau Stöhr came close to being rude. How could he even mention such a thing? she had asked. What sort of upbringing had he had? House rules carefully screened them, the patients, from coming into contact with such matters, and now here came a greenhorn sounding off about it—and while they were trying to eat their roast and with Dr. Blumenkohl present at that, who could be taken any day. (This last was whispered behind her hand.) If it happened again she would lodge a complaint. Then and there, as a result of that rebuke, Hans Castorp had reached his decision, which he made known to the others, to pay his personal respects to their departed housemate and say a silent prayer beside his remains. He also prevailed upon Joachim to join him."
"Das Rad schwang. Der Weiser rückte. Knabenkraut und Akelei waren verblüht, die wilde Nelke ebenfalls.

"Man hat sie herangeholt, die Kameraden, um dem Gefechte letzten Nachdruck zu geben, das schon den ganzen Tag gedauert hat, und das dem Wiedergewinn jener Hügelstellung und der dahinterliegenden brennenden Dörfer gilt, die vor zwei Tagen an den Feind verloren gingen. Es ist ein Regiment Freiwilliger, junges Blut, Studenten zumeist, nicht lange im Felde. Sie wurden alarmiert in der Nacht, sie fuhren mit der Bahn bis zum Morgen und marschierten im Regen bis zum Nachmittag auf schlimmen Wegen, – auf gar keinen Wegen, die Straßen waren verstopft, es ging durch Äcker und Moor, sieben Stunden lang, im schwergesogenen Mantel, mit Sturmgepäck, und das war kein Lustwandel; denn wollte man nicht die Stiefel verlieren, so mußte man fast bei jedem Schritte gebückt mit dem Finger in die Lasche greifen und den Fuß daran aus dem quatschenden Grunde ziehen. So haben sie eine Stunde gebraucht, um über eine kleine Wiese zu kommen. Nun sind sie {1082}da, ihr junges Blut hat alles geschafft, ihre erregten und schon erschöpften, aber aus tiefsten Lebensreserven in Spannung gehaltenen Körper fragen dem vorenthaltenen Schlaf, der Nahrung nicht nach. Ihre nassen, mit Schmutz bespritzten, vom Sturmband umrahmten Gesichter unter den grau bespannten, verschobenen Helmen glühen. Sie glühen von Anstrengung und von dem Anblick der Verluste, die sie beim Zuge durch den morastigen Wald erlitten haben. Denn der Feind, ihres Anrükkens kundig, hat Sperrfeuer von Schrapnells und großkalibrigen Granaten auf ihren Weg gelegt, das schon durch den Wald splitternd in ihre Gruppen schlug und heulend, spritzend und flammend das weite Sturzackerland peitscht.","They have been brought up, the comrades, to give the final emphasis to the battle that has been going on all day and is aimed at regaining that position on the hill and the burning villages behind it that were lost to the enemy two days ago. It is a regiment of volunteers, young blood, mostly students, not long in the field. They were alarmed at night, they took the train until morning and marched in the rain until the afternoon on bad roads - on no roads at all, the roads were blocked, they went through fields and moors for seven hours, in the heavily sucked coat, with knapsack, and that wasn't a stroll; because if you didn't want to lose your boots, you had to bend over and grab your finger in the loop at almost every step and pull your foot out of the chattering ground. It took them an hour to cross a small meadow. Now they are {1082}there, their young blood has done everything, their excited and already exhausted bodies, but kept in tension from the deepest reserves of life, do not ask for the sleep they have been denied, for food. Their wet, dirt-spattered faces, framed in storm bands, glow beneath gray-covered, misaligned helmets. They are glowing from the exertion and from the sight of the casualties they have suffered trekking through the swampy forest. For the enemy, knowing of their approach, has placed a barrage of shrapnel and large-caliber shells in their path, which is already splintering through the forest in their groups and howling, splashing and flaming whips the wide fallen farmland.","They have been brought forward, these comrades, for a final thrust in a fight that has already lasted all day long, whose objective is the retaking of the hill position and the burning villages beyond, lost two days since to the enemy. It is a volunteer regiment, fresh young blood and mostly students, not long in the field. They were roused in the night, brought up in trains to morning, then marched in the rain on wretched roads—on no roads at all, for the roads were blocked, and they went over moor and ploughed land with full kit for seven hours, their coats sodden. It was no pleasure excursion. If one did not care to lose one’s boots, one stooped at every second step, clutched with one’s fingers into the straps and pulled them out of the quaking mire. It took an hour of such work to cover one meadow. But at last they have reached the appointed spot, exhausted, on edge, yet the reserve strength of their youthful bodies has kept them tense, they crave neither the sleep nor the food they have been denied. Their wet, mud-bespattered faces, framed between strap and grey-covered helmet, are flushed with exertion—perhaps too with the sight of the losses they suffered on their march through that boggy wood. For the enemy, aware of their advance, have concentrated a barrage of shrapnel and large-calibre grenades upon the way they must come; it crashed among them in the wood, and howling, flaming, splashing, lashed the wide ploughed land.","They have been called up, these comrades here, for a final push in a battle that has lasted all day, to regain that hill position and the burning villages just beyond, which were lost to the enemy two days before. It is a regiment of volunteers, youngsters, students mostly, not long at the front. They were rousted out in the night, rode the train till morning, marched in the rain until afternoon, taking wretched roads, or, since the roads were already jammed, no roads at all, just field and moor. Seven hours in heavy, rain-sodden coats, with battle gear—this was no promenade. To keep from losing your boots, you had to bend down at almost every step and grab hold of the tongue with your fingers and tug your foot out of the squishy mire. It had taken one whole hour to cross a little meadow. And now here they are—youth has done it, their exhausted but excited bodies, tense with the last reserves of energy, have no need of the sleep and food they have been denied. Their flushed, wet faces, splattered with mud, are framed by chin straps and gray cloth-covered helmets worn askew; they are flushed with exertion and the sight of the casualties they took moving through the marshy wood. For the enemy, informed of their advance, had laid a barrage across their path, shrapnel and large-caliber grenades that burst into their ranks while they were still in the woods—a splintering, howling, spraying, flaming scourge across the wide, newly plowed fields."
"Auf der Etage der Vettern, nicht weit von ihren Zimmern, lag ein ganz junges Mädchen, Leila Gerngroß mit Namen, die den Mitteilungen Schwester Alfredas zufolge im Begriffe war, zu sterben. Sie hatte binnen zehn Tagen vier heftige Blutungen erlitten, und ihre Eltern waren heraufgekommen, um sie vielleicht noch lebend heimzubringen; doch schien das nicht angängig: der Hofrat verneinte die Transportfähigkeit der armen kleinen Gerngroß. Sie war sechzehn-, siebzehnjährig. Hans Castorp sah hier die rechte Gelegenheit, seinen Plan mit dem Blumentopf und den Genesungswünschen zu verwirklichen. Zwar hatte Leila jetzt nicht Geburtstag, würde diesen auch, menschlicher Voraussicht nach, nicht mehr erleben, da er, wie {456}Hans Castorp ausgekundschaftet, erst in das Frühjahr fiel; doch brauchte das seiner Entscheidung nach kein Hindernis für eine solche barmherzige Huldigung zu sein. Auf einem Mittagsgange in die Gegend des Kurhauses trat er mit seinem Vetter in einen Blumenladen, dessen erdig-feuchte und duftüberladene Atmosphäre er mit bewegter Brust einatmete, und erstand einen hübschen Hortensienstock, den er ohne Namensnennung, mit einer Karte, auf der nur »Von zwei Hausgenossen, mit besten Genesungswünschen« geschrieben stand, der kleinen Moribunden aufs Zimmer zu schicken Weisung gab. Er handelte freudig, angenehm benommen vom Pflanzenbrodem, der lauen Wärme des Ortes, die nach der Außenkälte seine Augen tränen ließ, mit klopfendem Herzen und einem Gefühl der Abenteuerlichkeit, Kühnheit, Förderlichkeit seines unscheinbaren Unternehmens, dem er insgeheim eine symbolische Tragweite beimaß.","On the cousins' floor, not far from their rooms, lay a very young girl, Leila Gerngross, who, according to Sister Alfreda, was about to die. She had suffered four major hemorrhages in ten days, and her parents had come upstairs to perhaps bring her home alive; but that did not seem feasible: the privy councilor denied that poor little Gerngross could be transported. She was sixteen, seventeen years old. Hans Castorp saw the right opportunity here to realize his plan with the flower pot and the get well wishes. It is true that Leila's birthday was not now, nor would she, according to human foresight, live to see it, since, as Hans Castorp discovered, it was not until spring; yet, in his mind, that need not be an impediment to such merciful homage. On a midday walk in the vicinity of the Kurhaus, he and his cousin entered a flower shop, whose earthy, damp and fragrant atmosphere he breathed in with trembling chests, and bought a pretty hydrangea plant, which he bought without naming his name, with a card on which only ""From two housemates, with best wishes for a speedy recovery” was written, which gave instructions to send little moribunds to their room. He acted happily, pleasantly dazed by the bubbling plants, the mild warmth of the place that made his eyes water after the cold outside, with a pounding heart and a sense of the adventurous, daring, usefulness of his unassuming undertaking, to which he secretly attached symbolic importance.","In the same storey with the cousins, not far from their rooms, lay a young girl named Leila Gerngross. According to Sister Berta, she was about to die. Inside ten days she had had four violent hemorrhages, and her parents had come, in the hope to take her home while she still lived. But it was impossible; the Hofrat said poor little Gerngross could not stand the journey. She was sixteen or seventeen years old. Hans Castorp saw here the opportunity to carry out his plan with the pot of flowers and the good wishes for speedy recovery. There was , it is true, no birthday feast to celebrate, in all human probability little Leila would never see another—it came in the spring, Hans Castorp learned. But he felt the fact need not prevent his offering his respectful sympathy. When he went down with his cousin for their morning walk, he entered a flower-shop near the Kurhaus; and breathing in agreeably the moist, earthy, scentladen air, he chose with care from the array a charming hortensia, and ordered it conveyed to the little sufferer’s room, with a card, upon which he wrote no names, but simply “From two house-mates, with best wishes for recovery.” All this was an exquisite activity to Hans Castorp; he enjoyed the fragrant breath of the plants; the soft warmth of the shop, after the cold outside, made his eyes fill with tears. His heart beat with a feeling of adventure and audacity, a conviction of the good sense of his modest enterprise, to which, privately, he ascribed a certain symbolic value.","On the same floor as the cousins, not far from their own rooms, a young lady named Leila Gerngross lay dying, or so they were told by Sister Alfreda. She had suffered four severe hemorrhages over the last ten days, and her parents had come here with the idea of taking her back home while she still lived; but that did not appear to be a feasible plan—the director said that poor Fräulein Gerngross ought not to be moved. She was sixteen or seventeen years old. Hans Castorp saw a genuine opportunity to realize his plan to send a potted plant and best wishes for recovery. True, it was not Leila’s birthday, nor would she, in all probability, live until her next one, which Hans Castorp learned on inquiry was not until spring— yet that did not seem an obstacle to his mission of mercy. On a noonday walk with his cousin, he stopped in a flower shop near the spa hotel; he eagerly breathed in the moist, earthy, aroma-laden air and purchased a pretty potted hydrangea, which he instructed be delivered to the dying girl’s room, enclosing a card, left unsigned, on which he wrote, “From two fellow guests, with best wishes for recovery.” Pleasantly giddy from the odor of plants and the sultry warmth of the shop, which made his eyes water after the cold outdoors, he completed the transaction with a happy, pounding heart, construing his modest effort as bold, adventurous, and helpful, and secretly ascribing symbolic importance to it."
"»Aber Herr Hofrat, wie lange meinen Sie denn, daß ich …«","""But Herr Hofrat, how long do you think I'll be...""","“But Herr Hofrat, how long do you mean that I—?”","“But, Director Behrens, how long do you think that I—”"
"Im Grunde hat es eine merkwürdige Bewandtnis mit diesem Sicheinleben an fremdem Orte, dieser – sei es auch – mühseligen Anpassung und Umgewöhnung, welcher man sich beinahe um ihrer selbst willen und in der bestimmten Absicht unterzieht, sie, kaum daß sie vollendet ist, oder doch bald danach, wieder aufzugeben und zum vorigen Zustande zurückzukehren. Man schaltet dergleichen als Unterbrechung und Zwischenspiel in den Hauptzusammenhang des Lebens ein, und zwar zum Zweck der »Erholung«, das heißt: der erneuernden, umwälzenden Übung des Organismus, welcher Gefahr lief und schon im Begriffe war, im ungegliederten Einerlei der Lebensführung sich zu verwöhnen, zu erschlaffen und abzustumpfen. Worauf beruht dann aber diese Erschlaffung und Abstumpfung bei zu langer nicht aufgehobener Regel? Es ist nicht so sehr körperlich-geistige Ermüdung und Abnutzung durch die Anforderungen des Lebens, worauf sie beruht (denn für diese wäre ja einfache Ruhe das wiederherstellende Heilmittel); es ist vielmehr etwas Seelisches, es ist das Erlebnis der Zeit, – welches bei ununterbrochenem Gleichmaß abhanden zu kommen droht und mit dem Lebensgefühle selbst so nahe verwandt und verbunden ist, daß das eine nicht geschwächt werden kann, ohne daß auch das andere eine kümmerliche Beeinträchtigung erführe. Über das Wesen der Langenweile sind vielfach irrige Vorstellungen verbreitet. Man {160}glaubt im ganzen, daß Interessantheit und Neuheit des Gehaltes die Zeit »vertreibe«, das heißt: verkürze, während Monotonie und Leere ihren Gang beschwere und hemme. Das ist nicht unbedingt zutreffend. Leere und Monotonie mögen zwar den Augenblick und die Stunde dehnen und »langweilig« machen, aber die großen und größten Zeitmassen verkürzen und verflüchtigen sie sogar bis zur Nichtigkeit. Umgekehrt ist ein reicher und interessanter Gehalt wohl imstande, die Stunde und selbst noch den Tag zu verkürzen und zu beschwingen, ins Große gerechnet jedoch verleiht er dem Zeitgange Breite, Gewicht und Solidität, so daß ereignisreiche Jahre viel langsamer vergehen als jene armen, leeren, leichten, die der Wind vor sich her bläst, und die verfliegen. Was man Langeweile nennt, ist also eigentlich vielmehr eine krankhafte Kurzweiligkeit der Zeit infolge von Monotonie: große Zeiträume schrumpfen bei ununterbrochener Gleichförmigkeit auf eine das Herz zu Tode erschreckende Weise zusammen; wenn ein Tag wie alle ist, so sind sie alle wie einer; und bei vollkommener Einförmigkeit würde das längste Leben als ganz kurz erlebt werden und unversehens verflogen sein. Gewöhnung ist ein Einschlafen oder doch ein Mattwerden des Zeitsinnes, und wenn die Jugendjahre langsam erlebt werden, das spätere Leben aber immer hurtiger abläuft und hineilt, so muß auch das auf Gewöhnung beruhen. Wir wissen wohl, daß die Einschaltung von Um- und Neugewöhnungen das einzige Mittel ist, unser Leben zu halten, unseren Zeitsinn aufzufrischen, eine Verjüngung, Verstärkung, Verlangsamung unseres Zeiterlebnisses und damit die Erneuerung unseres Lebensgefühls überhaupt zu erzielen. Dies ist der Zweck des Orts- und Luftwechsels, der Badereise, die Erholsamkeit der Abwechslung und der Episode. Die ersten Tage an einem neuen Aufenthalt haben jugendlichen, das heißt starken und breiten Gang, – es sind etwa sechs bis acht. Dann, in dem Maße, wie man »sich einlebt«, macht sich allmähliche {161}Verkürzung bemerkbar: wer am Leben hängt oder, besser gesagt, sich ans Leben hängen möchte, mag mit Grauen gewahren, wie die Tage wieder leicht zu werden und zu huschen beginnen; und die letzte Woche, etwa von vieren, hat unheimliche Rapidität und Flüchtigkeit. Freilich wirkt die Erfrischung des Zeitsinnes dann über die Einschaltung hinaus, macht sich, wenn man zur Regel zurückgekehrt ist, aufs neue geltend: die ersten Tage zu Hause werden ebenfalls, nach der Abwechslung, wieder neu, breit und jugendlich erlebt, aber nur einige wenige: denn in die Regel lebt man sich rascher wieder ein, als in ihre Aufhebung, und wenn der Zeitsinn durch Alter schon müde ist oder – ein Zeichen von ursprünglicher Lebensschwäche – nie stark entwickelt war, so schläft er sehr rasch wieder ein, und schon nach vierundzwanzig Stunden ist es, als sei man nie weg gewesen, und als sei die Reise der Traum einer Nacht.","Basically, there is a strange thing about this settling in in a foreign place, this - be it also - laborious adjustment and getting used to it, which one undergoes almost for its own sake and with the specific intention of making it scarcely that it is completed, or at least soon thereafter giving up again and returning to the previous condition. Such things are inserted as an interruption and an interlude in the main context of life, namely for the purpose of ""recovery,"" that is, the renewing, revolutionary exercise of the organism, which was in danger and was already about to recover in the unstructured monotony of the conduct of life pamper, relax and dull. But what is the basis for this slackening and dulling if the rule has not been suspended for too long? It is not so much physical-spiritual fatigue and wear and tear from the demands of life that causes it (for for these simple rest would be the restorative remedy); it is rather something of the soul, it is the experience of time – which threatens to get lost if there is an uninterrupted balance and is so closely related and connected to the feeling of life itself that one cannot be weakened without the other also suffering a miserable impairment experience There are many misconceptions about the nature of boredom. On the whole one believes that the interesting and novelty of the content ""passes"" the time, that is: shortens it, while monotony and emptiness impedes and impedes its course. This is not necessarily true. Emptiness and monotony may stretch out the moment and the hour and make it ""boring,"" but the great and greatest masses of time shorten and even evaporate them to nothing. Conversely, a rich and interesting content is indeed capable of shortening and enlivening the hour and even the day, but on a large scale it lends breadth, weight and solidity to the passage of time, so that eventful years pass much more slowly than those poor, empty, light ones that the wind blows in front of it and they fly away. So what is called boredom is actually rather a pathological shortness of time as a result of monotony: large periods of time shrink in uninterrupted uniformity in a manner that frightens the heart to death; if one day is like all, they are all like one; and with perfect uniformity the longest life would be experienced as very short and would have vanished inadvertently. Getting used to it means falling asleep or at least a fading of the sense of time, and if the years of youth are experienced slowly, but later life proceeds more and more quickly and hurriedly, then that too must be based on getting used to. We know well that the involvement of changes and new habits is the only way to maintain our life, to refresh our sense of time, to achieve a rejuvenation, strengthening, slowing down of our experience of time and thus the renewal of our feeling for life in general. This is the purpose of the change of place and air, the bathing trip, the restfulness of the change and the episode. The first days of a new stay have a youthful, that is, strong and broad gait - it is about six to eight. Then, to the extent that one ""sets in,"" a gradual shortening becomes noticeable: those who cling to life, or, better said, would like to cling to life, may perceive with horror how the days are becoming light again and begin to scurry; and the last week, about four weeks, has uncanny rapidity and volatility. Of course, the refreshment of the sense of time then has an effect beyond the switch-on, makes itself felt again when one has returned to the rule: the first days at home are also experienced again, after the change, as new, broad and youthful, but only a few : because as a rule one gets used to it more quickly than when it is abolished, and if the sense of time is already tired through old age or - a sign of original weakness in life - was never strongly developed, it falls asleep again very quickly, and after that twenty-four hours it is as if one had never been away and as if the journey were a night's dream.","There is, after all, something peculiar about the process of habituating oneself in a new place, the often laborious fitting in and getting used, which one undertakes for its own sake, and of set purpose to break it all off as soon as it is complete, or not long thereafter, and to return to one’s former state. It is an interval, an interlude, inserted, with the object of recreation, into the tenor of life’s main concerns; its purpose the relief of the organism, which is perpetually busy at its task of self-renewal, and which was in danger, almost in process, of being vitiated, slowed down, relaxed, by the bald, unjointed monotony of its daily course. But what then is the cause of this relaxation, this slowing-down that takes place when one does the same thing for too long at a time? It is not so much physical or mental fatigue or exhaustion, for if that were the case, then complete rest would be the best restorative. It is rather something psychical; it means that the perception of time tends, through periods of unbroken uniformity, to fall away; the perception of time, so closely bound up with the consciousness of life that the one may not be weakened without the other suffering a sensible impairment. Many false conceptions are held concerning the nature of tedium. In general it is thought that the interestingness and novelty of the time-content are what “make the time pass”; that is to say, shorten it; whereas monotony and emptiness check and restrain its flow. This is only true with reservations. Vacuity, monotony, have, indeed, the property of lingering out the moment and the hour and of making them tiresome. But they are capable of contracting and dissipating the larger, the very large timeunits, to the point of reducing them to nothing at all. And conversely, a full and interesting content can put wings to the hour and the day; yet it will lend to the general passage of time a weightiness, a breadth and solidity which cause the eventful years to flow far more slowly than those poor, bare, empty ones over which the wind passes and they are gone. Thus what we call tedium is rather an abnormal shortening of the time consequent upon monotony. Great spaces of time passed in unbroken uniformity tend to shrink together in a way to make the heart stop beating for fear; when one day is like all the others, then they are all like one; complete uniformity would make the longest life seem short, and as though it had stolen away from us unawares. Habituation is a falling asleep or fatiguing of the sense of time; which explains why young years pass slowly, while later life flings itself faster and faster upon its course. We are aware that the intercalation of periods of change and novelty is the only means by which we can refresh our sense of time, strengthen, retard, and rejuvenate it, and therewith renew our perception of life itself. Such is the purpose of our changes of air and scene, of all our sojourns at cures and bathing resorts; it is the secret of the healing power of change and incident. Our first days in a new place, time has a youthful, that is to say, a broad and sweeping, flow, persisting for some six or eight days. Then, as one “gets used to the place,” a gradual shrinkage makes itself felt. He who clings or, better expressed, wishes to cling to life, will shudder to see how the days grow light and lighter, how they scurry by like dead leaves, until the last week, of some four, perhaps, is uncannily fugitive and fleet. On the other hand, the quickening of the sense of time will flow out beyond the interval and reassert itself after the return to ordinary existence: the first days at home after the holiday will be lived with a broader flow, freshly and youthfully—but only the first few, for one adjusts oneself more quickly to the rule than to the exception; and if the sense of time be already weakened by age, or—and this is a sign of low vitality— it was never very well developed, one drowses quickly back into the old life, and after four-and-twenty hours it is as though one had never been away, and the journey had been","Ultimately, there is something odd about settling in somewhere new—about the perhaps laborious process of getting used to new surroundings and fitting in, a task we undertake almost for its own sake and with the definite intention of abandoning the place again as soon as it is accomplished, or shortly thereafter, and returning to our previous state. We insert that sort of thing into the mainstream of our lives as a kind of interruption or interlude, for the purpose of “recreation,” which is to say: a refreshing, revitalizing exercise of the organism, because it was in immediate danger of overindulging itself in the uninterrupted monotony of daily life, of languishing and growing indifferent. And what is the cause of the enervation and apathy that arise when the rules of life are not abrogated from time to time? It is not so much the physical and mental exhaustion and abrasion that come with the challenges of life (for these, in fact, simple rest would be the best medicine); the cause is, rather, something psychological, our very sense of time itself—which, if it flows with uninterrupted regularity, threatens to elude us and which is so closely related to and bound up with our sense of life that the one sense cannot be weakened without the second’s experiencing pain and injury. A great many false ideas have been spread about the nature of boredom. It is generally believed that by filling time with things new and interesting, we can make it “pass,” by which we mean “shorten” it; monotony and emptiness, however, are said to weigh down and hinder its passage. This is not true under all conditions. Emptiness and monotony may stretch a moment or even an hour and make it “boring,” but they can likewise abbreviate and dissolve large, indeed the largest units of time, until they seem nothing at all. Conversely, rich and interesting events are capable of filling time, until hours, even days, are shortened and speed past on wings; whereas on a larger scale, interest lends the passage of time breadth, solidity, and weight, so that years rich in events pass much more slowly than do paltry, bare, featherweight years that are blown before the wind and are gone. What people call boredom is actually an abnormal compression of time caused by monotony—uninterrupted uniformity can shrink large spaces of time until the heart falters, terrified to death. When one day is like every other, then all days are like one, and perfect homogeneity would make the longest life seem very short, as if it had flown by in a twinkling. Habit arises when our sense of time falls asleep, or at least, grows dull; and if the years of youth are experienced slowly, while the later years of life hurtle past at an ever-increasing speed, it must be habit that causes it. We know full well that the insertion of new habits or the changing of old ones is the only way to preserve life, to renew our sense of time, to rejuvenate, intensify, and retard our experience of time—and thereby renew our sense of life itself. That is the reason for every change of scenery and air, for a trip to the shore: the experience of a variety of refreshing episodes. The first few days in a new place have a youthful swing to them, a kind of sturdy, long stride—that lasts for about six to eight days. Then, to the extent that we “settle in,” the gradual shortening becomes noticeable. Whoever clings to life, or better, wants to cling to life, may realize to his horror that the days have begun to grow light again and are scurrying past; and the last week—of, let us say, four—is uncanny in its fleeting transience. To be sure, this refreshment of our sense of time extends beyond the interlude; its effect is noticeable again when we return to our daily routine. The first few days at home after a change of scene are likewise experienced in a new, broad, more youthful fashion—but only a very few, for we are quicker to grow accustomed to the old rules than to their abrogation. And if our sense of time has grown weary with age or was never all that strongly developed—a sign of an inborn lack of vitality—it very soon falls asleep again, and within twenty-four hours it is as if we were never gone and our journey were merely last night’s dream."
"Vor einem Jahre, ebenfalls in ihrem Elternhaus zu Odense, hatte sie frühmorgens, in aller Frische, ihr Zimmer verlassen, das im Erdgeschoß gelegen war, und sich über die Diele die Treppe hinauf ins Eßzimmer begeben wollen, um, wie es ihre Gewohnheit war, Kaffee zu kochen, bevor die Eltern sich einfanden. Fast bis zum Podest, wo die Treppe sich wandte, war sie {1000}schon gelangt gewesen, da hatte sie auf eben diesem Podest, am Rande desselben, dicht an den Stufen, ihre in Amerika verheiratete ältere Schwester Sophie stehen sehen – leiblich und wirklich. Sie hatte ein weißes Kleid angehabt und sonderbarerweise einen Kranz von Wasserrosen, schilfigen Mummeln, auf dem Kopf getragen und die Hände an der Schulter gefaltet und hatte ihr zugenickt. »Ja, aber, Sophie, bist du da?« hatte die angewurzelte Ellen halb freudig und halb erschrocken gefragt. Da hatte Sophie noch einmal genickt und sich darnach verflüchtigt. Sie war durchsichtig geworden; bald war sie nur in dem Grade noch sichtbar gewesen, wie eine fließende Strömung heißer Luft, und dann überhaupt nicht mehr, so daß der Weg frei gewesen war für Ellen. Doch dann hatte sich erwiesen, daß in dieser selbigen Morgenstunde Schwester Sophie in New-Jersey an Herzentzündung gestorben war.","A year ago, also in her parents' house in Odense, early in the morning she had left her room, which was on the ground floor, and wanted to go up the stairs to the dining room, as was her custom, Making coffee before the parents got there. She had almost reached the platform where the stairs turned, when she had seen her older sister Sophie, who was married in America, standing on this very platform, on the edge of it, close to the steps – bodily and real . She had been wearing a white dress and, oddly enough, had carried a wreath of water lilies, reedy mummy, on her head and had clasped her hands on her shoulders and nodded to her. ""Yes, but, Sophie, are you there?"" Ellen, rooted to the ground, asked, half joyfully and half frightened. So Sophie nodded again and then disappeared. She had become transparent; soon she had only been visible to the degree, like a flowing current of hot air, and then not at all, so that the way had been clear for Ellen. But then it turned out that in that same hour of the morning Sister Sophie had died of heart infection in New Jersey.","A year before, in her parent’s house at Odense, she had risen, as was her custom, in the cool of the early morning and left her room on the ground-floor, to go up to the breakfast-room, in order to brew the morning coffee before her parents rose. She had almost reached the landing, where the stairs turned, when she saw standing there close by the steps her elder sister Sophie, who had married and gone to America to live. There she was, her physical presence, in a white gown, with, curiously enough, a garland of moist water-lilies on her head, her hands folded against one shoulder, and nodded to her sister. Ellen, rooted to the spot, half joyful, half terrified, cried out: “Oh, Sophie, is that you?” Sophie had nodded once again, and dissolved. She became gradually transparent, soon she was only visible as an ascending current of warm air, then not visible at all, so that Ellen’s path was clear. Later, it transpired that Sister Sophie had died of heart trouble in New Jersey, at that very hour.","The previous year she had been at her parents’ house in Odense again, and very early one morning she left her room, which was on the ground floor, and was crossing the hall to climb the stairs to the dining room to make herself some coffee, as she normally did before her parents got up. She had almost reached the landing where the stairway turned, and there on the landing, right at the top of the stairs, she had seen her older sister Sophie, who was married and lived in America —it was her, really, physically her. She was wearing a white dress and, what seemed very strange, a wreath of marshy water lilies on her head; holding both hands clasped against one shoulder, her sister had nodded to her. “Why, Sophie—are you home?” Ellen had asked, rooted to the spot, half in terror, half in joy. Sophie had nodded once more and then vanished into thin air. First she became transparent, then visible only in the same way you see a current of hot air rising, and finally not at all—and the stairs were free again for Ellen to pass. It turned out that on that very same morning, in New Jersey, her sister Sophie had died of inflammation of the heart."
"Zum ewig eintönigen Rhythmus des Zeitablaufs, zur kurzweilig feststehenden Gliederung des Normaltages, der immer derselbe, der sich selbst zum Verwechseln und bis zur Verwirrung ähnlich war, identisch mit sich, die stehende Ewigkeit, so daß schwer zu begreifen war, wie er Veränderung zu zeitigen vermochte, – zur unverbrüchlichen Alltagsordnung also gehörte, wie jedermann sich erinnert, der Rundgang Dr. Kro{553}kowskis zwischen halb vier und vier Uhr nachmittags durch alle Zimmer, das ist über alle Balkons, von Liegestuhl zu Liegestuhl. Wie oft hatte nicht der Berghof-Normaltag sich erneut, seit damals, als Hans Castorp in seiner horizontalen Lebenslage sich geärgert hatte, weil der Assistent einen Bogen um ihn beschrieb und ihn nicht in Betracht zog! Längst war aus dem Gaste von damals ein Kamerad geworden, – Dr. Krokowski redete ihn sogar häufig mit diesem Namen an bei seiner Kontrollvisite, und wenn das militärische Wort, dessen r-Laut er auf exotische Weise durch nur einmaliges Anschlagen der Zunge am vorderen Gaumen hervorbrachte, ihm auch scheußlich zu Gesichte stand, wie Hans Castorp gegen Joachim geurteilt hatte, so paßte es doch nicht schlecht zu seiner stämmigen, mannhaft heiteren und zu fröhlichem Vertrauen auffordernden Art, die freilich wiederum durch seine Schwarzbleichheit in gewisser Weise Lügen gestraft wurde, und der denn doch etwas Bedenkliches jederzeit anhaftete.","To the eternally monotonous rhythm of the passage of time, to the temporarily fixed structure of the normal day, which was always the same, which was confusingly similar to itself, to the point of confusion, identical to itself, standing eternity, so that it was difficult to understand how it could bring about change was able, - as everyone remembers, the round tour of Dr. Kro{553}kowskis between three-thirty and four in the afternoon through all the rooms, that's across all the balconies, from deck chair to deck chair. How often has the normal Berghof day returned since then, when Hans Castorp, in his horizontal position in life, was annoyed because the assistant described an arc around him and ignored him! The guest from back then had long since become a comrade - Dr. Krokowski often addressed him by that name during his check-up visits, even if the military word, whose r-sound he produced in an exotic way by just tapping his tongue once on the front palate, looked horrible to him, as Hans Castorp did to Joachim judged, it did not go badly with his burly, manly, cheerful manner, which called for cheerful confidence, which of course was belied in a certain way by his black pallor, and which always had something dubious about it.","In the rhythmic monotony of time’s flow, in the well-nigh minute articulation of the normal day—that day which was ever, even unto confusion and distraction, the same day, an abiding eternity, so that it was hard to say how it ever managed to bring forth any change—in the inviolable, unbreachable regimen, we say, of that normal day, Dr. Krokowski’s routine of visits took him, as of yore, through all the rooms, or rather through all the balconies, from chair to reclining-chair, between half past three and four in the afternoon. How often had the normal day of the Berghof renewed itself, since the faroff time when Hans Castorp lay and grumbled within himself because Dr. Krokowski described an arc about him and left him on one side! The guest of that day had long become the comrade— Dr. Krokowski often thus addressed him when he made his rounds; and if, as Hans Castorp said to Joachim, the military associations of the word, with the exotic pronunciation of the r, sounded singularly inappropriate in his mouth, yet the word itself did not go so badly with his robust and hearty, confidence-inviting manner. But that again, in its turn, was belied by his blackness and pallor, so that some aura of the questionable always hung about the man.","One part of the eternal monotony of time’s rhythm, of the diverting, standard segmentation of the normal day, which was always the same, to the point where each day was so confusingly like, so identical with, the next that it could be taken for it, a fixed eternity that made it hard to understand how time could ever bring forth changes—one part of the undeviating schedule (as our readers will recall) was that Dr. Krokowski made his rounds every day between half past three and four o’clock, moving from room to room, or rather balcony to balcony, lounge chair to lounge chair. And the Berghof day had itself come round many times now since that day when Hans Castorp, lying there in his horizontal position, had felt hurt because the assistant had made a detour around his room, leaving him to his own devices. The visitor in August had long ago become a comrade— Dr . Krokowski frequently called him that when he stopped to check on him, and although, as Hans Castorp remarked to Joachim, that military word, with its exotic r, a single palatalized tap of the tongue, sounded dreadful coming from the assistant, it did not fit all that badly with his rugged, virile, jovial manner, which both demanded your cheerful trust and yet at the same time had its dubious side, since it was always contradicted somehow by his black pallor."
"»Erinnern Sie sich wohl, Ingenieur, daß wir einen ähnlichen Disput schon einmal geführt haben – man kann sagen: denselben? Wir plauderten damals – ich glaube, es war auf einem Spaziergang – über Krankheit und Dummheit, deren Vereinigung Sie für eine Paradoxie erklärten, und zwar aus Hochachtung vor der Krankheit. Ich nannte diese Hochachtung eine düstere Grille, mit der man den Gedanken des Menschen entehre, und Sie schienen zu meinem Vergnügen denn doch nicht ganz abgeneigt, meinen Einwand in Erwägung zu ziehen. Wir sprachen auch von der Neutralität und geistigen Unschlüssigkeit der Jugend, von ihrer Wahlfreiheit, ihrer Neigung, mit den möglichen Standpunkten Versuche anzustellen, und davon, daß man solche Versuche noch nicht als endgültige und le{306}bensernste Optionen betrachten dürfe, – zu betrachten brauche. Wollen Sie mir –,« und Herr Settembrini beugte sich lächelnd auf seinem Stuhle vor, die Füße nebeneinander am Boden, die zusammengelegten Hände zwischen den Knien, den Kopf gleichfalls etwas schräg vorgeschoben – »wollen Sie mir auch fernerhin,« sagte er, und es war eine leichte Bewegung in seiner Stimme, »erlauben, Ihnen bei Ihren Übungen und Experimenten ein wenig zur Hand zu gehen und berichtigend auf Sie einzuwirken, wenn die Gefahr verderblicher Fixierungen droht?«","'Do you remember, engineer, that we had a similar dispute before - you could say the same one? We chatted at the time - I think it was while walking - about illness and stupidity, the combination of which you declared to be a paradox, out of respect for the illness. I called this respect a sombre whimsy dishonoring the mind of man, and to my amusement you seemed not altogether averse to considering my objection. We also spoke of the neutrality and intellectual hesitancy of young people, of their freedom of choice, their tendency to experiment with the possible points of view, and that such experiments should not yet be regarded as final and serious options - to consider need. Do you want me -"" and M. Settembrini leaned forward smiling in his chair, his feet together on the floor, his hands clasped between his knees, his head also pushed forward a little - ""do you want me to go on too,"" he said, and it was a slight movement in his voice, ""permit to lend a hand in your exercises and experiments, and to correct you when there is danger of fatal fixations?""","At length Herr Settembrini lifted his head, and said with a smile: “You very likely recall, Engineer, that we have had a similar discussion once before—one might say the same discussion. We were talking about disease and dullness—I think we were taking a walk—and you found the combination a paradox, on the ground of your reverence for ill health. I called that reverence a dismal fancy which dishonoured human thought; and I was gratified to find you not disinclined to entertain my plea. We spoke of the neutrality and the intellectual indecision of youth, of its liberty of choice, of its inclination to play with all possible points of view, and that one should not—or need not—regard these experimentations as final and definite elections. Will you permit me”—Herr Settembrini smiled and bent forward as he sat, his feet close together on the floor, his hands between his knees, his head stretched out and a little on one side—“will you permit me”—and his voice had the faintest tremor in it—“to be beside you in your essays and experiments, and to exercise a corrective influence when there appears to be danger of your taking up a destructive position?”","At last Herr Settembrini raised his head again, and said with a smile, “Do you remember, my good engineer, how we once had a similar dispute, one could well say, the same dispute? Our conversation that day—I believe we were out walking—was about sickness and stupidity; and out of a respect for illness, you declared the combination of the two a paradox. I called that respect a gloomy notion that dishonored the very idea of humanity, and to my delight you appeared not all that reluctant to take my objections into consideration. We spoke about the neutrality and intellectual hesitancy of youth, of its freedom to choose, its tendency to experiment with all sorts of standpoints, and of how one need not regard such experiments as final, life-determining options. Would you allow me”—and here Herr Settembrini bent forward on his chair, and with a smile he placed both feet on the floor, tucked his folded hands between his knees, and thrust his head forward at a slight tilt—“would you allow me,” he repeated with some emotion in his voice, “to lend you a helping hand in your exercises and experiments and to play a corrective role whenever I see danger looming in the form of some pernicious fixation?”"
"So ging das weiter, wir kennen das Spiel, Hans Castorp kannte es. Wir haben mit ihm einen Augenblick hingehört, um zu beobachten, wie, beispielsweise, ein solcher peripatetischer Waffengang sich im Schatten der nebenherwandelnden Persönlichkeit ausnahm, und auf welche Weise etwa diese Gegenwart ihn insgeheim um den Nerv brachte: nämlich so, daß ein heimlicher Zwang zur Bezugnahme auf sie den hin und her springenden Funken tötete und eine Erinnerung an jenes Gefühl matter Leblosigkeit sich aufdrängte, das uns überkommt, wenn eine elektrische Leitung sich als kontaktlos erweist. Gut! so war es. Da war kein Knistern zwischen den Widersprüchen mehr, kein Sprung des Blitzes, kein Strom, – die Gegenwart, neutralisiert durch den Geist, wie dieser meinen wollte, neutralisierte vielmehr den Geist; Hans Castorp ward es mit Staunen und Neugier gewahr.","That's how it went on, we know the game, Hans Castorp knew it. We listened with him for a moment in order to observe how, for example, such a peripatetic battle of arms appeared in the shadow of the personality walking alongside, and in what way this presence secretly got on his nerves: namely in such a way that a secret compulsion to Reference to her killed the spark that flew back and forth, and prompted a reminder of that feeling of languid lifelessness that comes over us when an electric wire proves contactless. Well! it was like this. There was no more crackling between contradictions, no more leaps of lightning, no current—the present, neutralized by the mind, as it meant, rather neutralized the mind; Hans Castorp saw it with astonishment and curiosity.","So it went on—we know already how it went, and so did Hans Castorp. We have listened, as he did, for a little while, in order to learn how such a peripatetic passageat-arms fares, in what way it is blown upon, by the presence of a personality. It seemed as though a secret impulse to animadvert upon the presence of Peeperkorn quenched the leaping spark of wit, and called up that sense of weary devitalization that comes over us when an electric connexion fails to connect. Yes, that was it. No spark leaped nimbly from pole to pole, no flash of lightning, no current. The intellect which should in its own opinion have neutralized the presence was neutralized by it— as Hans Castorp, amazed and curious, perceived.","And on and on it went, we know the game; Hans Castorp knew it, too. We listened along with him for a moment in order to observe, for instance, how such a peripatetic passage-at-arms might sound under the shadow of the personality strolling beside the combatants and how his presence might secretly enervate their struggle. And, indeed, a clandestine compulsion to take the presence of that personality into consideration killed the spark that normally leaped between the two—it was reminiscent of the dull, lifeless feeling that overcomes you when an electrical outlet turns out to be dead. Fine, that was that. Nothing crackled between the antagonists now, no lightning flashed, no current surged. The presence that intellect thought to neutralize, neutralized intellect instead. Hans Castorp observed it all with astonished curiosity."
"»Unser Sanatorium liegt noch höher als der Ort, wie du siehst«, fuhr Joachim fort. »Fünfzig Meter. Im Prospekt steht ›hundert‹, aber es sind bloß fünfzig. Am allerhöchsten liegt das Sanatorium Schatzalp dort drüben, man kann es nicht sehen. Die müssen im Winter ihre Leichen per Bobschlitten herunterbefördern, weil dann die Wege nicht fahrbar sind.«","""Our sanatorium is even higher than the town, as you can see,"" Joachim continued. 'Fifty meters. The prospectus says 'hundred', but it's only fifty. At the highest point is the Schatzalp sanatorium over there, you can't see it. In winter they have to bring their bodies down by bobsleigh because the roads are impassable then.”","“Our sanatorium is higher up than the village, as you see,” went on Joachim. “Fifty metres higher. In the prospectus it says a hundred, but it is really only fifty. The highest of the sanatoriums is the Schatzalp—you can’t see it from here. They have to bring their bodies down on bob-sleds in the winter, because the roads are blocked.”","“Our sanatorium lies at a higher altitude than the village, as you can see,” Joachim continued. “A hundred fifty feet. The brochure says ‘three hundred,’ but it’s only half that. The highest of the sanatoriums is Schatzalp, across the way, you can’t see it now. They have to transport the bodies down by bobsled in the winter, because the roads are impassable.”"
"»Sagen Sie immerhin so«, nickte Herr Settembrini. »Unbedingt wäre das ein Zug, den man loben dürfte. Der Mut der Erkenntnis und des Ausdrucks, das ist die Literatur, es ist die Humanität …«","'You say it like that,' nodded Mr Settembrini. “It would definitely be a move to praise. The courage of knowledge and expression, that is literature, it is humanity...""","“You may say so,” Settembrini acquiesced. “A trait at least worthy of praise. The courage to recognize and express—that is the quality that makes literature—that is humanism.”","“Say it in any case,” Settembrini replied with a nod. “That would definitely be a trait one might praise. The courage of self-recognition and expression—that is literature, that is humanity.”"
"Ein Tenorist trug es vor zum Klavier, ein Bursche von Takt {986}und Geschmack, der seinen zugleich simplen und gipfelhohen Gegenstand mit vieler Klugheit, musikalischem Feingefühl und rezitatorischer Umsicht zu behandeln wußte. Wir alle wissen, daß das herrliche Lied im Volks- und Kindermunde etwas anders lautet, denn als Kunstgesang. Dort wird es meist, vereinfacht, nach der Hauptmelodie strophisch durchgesungen, während diese populäre Linie im Original schon bei der zweiten der achtzeiligen Strophen in Moll variiert, um beim fünften Vers, überaus schön, wieder in Dur einzulenken, bei den darauf folgenden »kalten Winden« aber und dem vom Kopfe fliegenden Hute dramatisch aufgelöst wird und sich erst bei den letzten vier Versen der dritten Strophe wiederfindet, die wiederholt werden, damit die Weise sich aussingen könne. Die eigentlich bezwingende Wendung der Melodie erscheint dreimal und zwar in ihrer modulierenden zweiten Hälfte, das drittemal also bei der Reprise der letzten Halbstrophe »Nun bin ich manche Stunde«. Diese zauberhafte Wendung, der wir mit Worten nicht zu nahe treten mögen, liegt auf den Satzfragmenten »So manches liebe Wort«, »Als riefen sie mir zu«, »Entfernt von jenem Ort«, und die helle und warme, atemkluge und zu einem maßvollen Schluchzen geneigte Stimme des Tenoristen sang sie jedesmal mit so viel intelligentem Gefühl für ihre Schönheit, daß sie dem Zuhörer auf ungeahnte Weise ans Herz griff, zumal der Künstler seine Wirkung durch außerordentlich innige Kopftöne bei den Zeilen »Zu ihm mich immerfort«, »Hier findst du deine Ruh« zu steigern wußte. Beim wiederholten letzten Verse aber, diesem »Du fändest Ruhe dort!« sang er das »fändest« das erstemal aus voller, sehnsüchtiger Brust und erst das zweitemal wieder als zartestes Flageolett.","A tenor performed it on the piano, a lad of measure and taste, who knew how to treat his subject, which was at once simple and lofty, with a great deal of cleverness, musical sensitivity and recitative prudence. We all know that the wonderful song in the mouths of the people and children sounds something different than as an artistic song. There it is usually, simplified, sung strophically after the main melody, while this popular line in the original already varies in the second of the eight-line stanzas in minor, only to return to major in the fifth verse, extremely beautifully, with the following “cold winds « but and the hat flying off the head is resolved dramatically and is only found again in the last four lines of the third stanza, which are repeated so that the melody can sing itself out. The really compelling turn of the melody appears three times, namely in its modulating second half, the third time in the recapitulation of the last half-strophe ""Now I'm many an hour"". This magical turn of phrase, which we do not want to get too close to with words, lies on the sentence fragments »So many a dear word«, »As if they called out to me«, »Away from that place«, and the bright and warm, breath-taking and at one The tenor's voice, inclined to moderate sobs, she always sang with such an intelligent feeling for her beauty that she touched the listener's heart in an unimagined way, especially since the artist emphasized his effect through extraordinarily heartfelt head tones in the lines ""To him me forever"", ""Here you will find your rest«. But when the last verse was repeated, this ""You would find peace there!"" he sang the ""found"" the first time with a full, longing heart and only the second time again as the most tender harmonica.","It was sung to piano accompaniment by a tenor voice; and the singer was a lad of parts and discernment, who knew how to render with great skill, fine musical feeling and finesse in recitative his simple yet consummate theme. We all know that the noble lied sounds rather differently when given as a concert-number from its rendition in the childish or the popular mouth. In its simplified form the melody is sung straight through; whereas in the original art-song, the key changes to minor in the second of the eight-line stanzas, changes back again with beautiful effect to major in the fifth line; is dramatically resolved in the following “bitter blasts” and “facing the tempest”; and returns again only with the last four lines of the third stanza, which are repeated to finish out the melody. The truly compelling turn in the melody occurs three times, in its modulated second half, the third time in the repetition of the last half-strophe “Ay, onward, ever onward.” The enchanting turn, which we would not touch too nearly in bold words, comes on the phrases “Upon its branches fair,” “A message in my ear,” “Yet ever in my breast”; and each time the tenor rendered them, in his clear, warm voice, with his excellent breathing-technique, with the suggestion of a sob, arid so much sensitive, beauty-loving intelligence, the listener felt his heart gripped in undreamed-of fashion; with an effect the singer knew how to heighten by head-tones of extraordinary ardour on the lines “I found my solace there,” and “For rest and peace are here.” In the repetition of the last line, “Here shouldst thou find thy rest,” he sang the “shouldst thou” the first time yearningly, at full strength, but the second in the tenderest flute-tones.","Accompanied by a piano, it was sung by a tenor, a fellow with tact and taste, who knew how to treat its simultaneously simple and sublime material with a great deal of good sense, musical feeling, and narrative restraint. We all know that there is a great difference between how this splendid song sounds as an art song and as a tune in the mouths of children and everyday folks. In the latter case, it is sung to the basic melody, usually in simplified form, one stanza after the other; whereas here the original melody is already varied in a minor key by the second of the three eight-line stanzas, reemerges very beautifully in the major by the time the third stanza begins, is then dramatically abandoned in the “cold winds” that blow your hat from your head, and only finds its way back again in the last four lines of the stanza, where it is then repeated so that the song can be sung to an end. The most overpowering phrase of the melody occurs three times, always in its modulating second half—the third time, then, being in the reprise of the last half-stanza that begins “ And many now the hours.” This magical phrase, which we do not want to abuse with words, is found in the lines: “So many words of love,” “As if they called to me,” and “Since I have been away.” And the warm, bright tenor voice, with its fine breath control and the hint of a restrained sob, sang it each time with such intelligent sensitivity for its beauty that it would grip the listener’s heart unexpectedly, particularly since the artist knew how to heighten the effect with an extraordinarily intense head voice on the lines “It always drew me back” and “And here you’ll find your rest.” In the repetition of the last verse, however, where the line reads, “You could have found rest here,” he sang “could have” the first time in full, yearning chest voice and only the second time in the gentlest of flute tones."
"»Unbedingt, Clawdia. Sehr wohl gesprochen.

Very well spoken. Humiliation then also has format, and from the height of their humiliation the woman can speak as disparagingly to those who are not of royal format as you did to me earlier regarding the timbres-poste, in the tone in which you said: ›You should at least be precise and reliable!‹«","“Absolutely, Clavdia. Well said. For then even the humiliation is on the grand scale, and from the height of it the woman can look down on poor creatures built on smaller lines, and speak to them with such contempt as was in your voice when you said, about the postage stamps: ‘You ought to be more precise and dependable!’ ”","“Most definitely, Clavdia. Very well put. Because, then, even being demeaned brings with it a certain stature, and a woman can look down from the heights of her demeaned position to those who have no royal stature, and speak in that disparaging tone you used just now when you asked about timbres-poste and said: ‘Gentlemen should at least be punctual and dependable.’ ”"

"{951}Es ist mehr zu sagen. Nicht nur er selbst, Hans Castorp, schien sich auf solchem toten Punkte angekommen, sondern ihm war, als ob es mit der Welt, mit allem, mit »dem Ganzen« eben diese Bewandtnis habe, oder vielmehr: er fand, daß es schwer sei, hier das Besondere vom Allgemeinen zu unterscheiden. Seit dem exzentrischen Ende seiner Verbindung mit einer Persönlichkeit; seit der vielfältigen Bewegung, die dieses Ende über das Haus gebracht, und seit Clawdia Chauchats neuerlichem Ausscheiden aus der Gemeinschaft Derer hier oben, dem Lebewohl, das, beschattet von der Tragik großen Versagens, im Geiste ehrerbietiger Rücksicht, zwischen ihr und dem überlebenden Duzbruder ihres Herrn getauscht worden, – seit dieser Wende schien es dem jungen Mann, als sei es mit Welt und Leben nicht ganz geheuer; als stehe es auf eine besondere Weise und zunehmend schief und beängstigend darum; als habe ein Dämon die Macht ergriffen, der, schlimm und närrisch, zwar lange schon beträchtlichen Einfluß geübt, jetzt aber seine Herrschaft so zügellos offen erklärt habe, daß es wohl geheimnisvollen Schrecken einflößen und Fluchtgedanken nahelegen konnte, – der Dämon, des Name Stumpfsinn war.","{951}There is more to be said. Not only did he himself, Hans Castorp, seem to have arrived at such a dead end, but he felt as if the world, with everything, with ""the whole,"" was just like that, or rather: he thought it was difficult to distinguish the particular from the general. Since the eccentric end of his association with a personality; since the manifold movement that brought this end to the house, and since Clawdia Chauchat's renewed departure from the community of those above, the farewell that, shaded by the tragedy of great failure, in a spirit of respectful consideration, between her and the surviving intimate brother of her Lord had been exchanged - since this change it seemed to the young man as if he was not quite comfortable with the world and life; as if it stands in a special way and increasingly crooked and frightening about it; as if a demon had seized power, who, evil and foolish, had long exercised considerable influence, but had now professed his dominion so rampantly open that it might well incite mysterious terrors and prompt thoughts of flight—the demon whose name was stupidity .","And further. It seemed to Hans Castorp that not only he himself had arrived at this point, but that all the world, “the whole show,” as he said, had arrived there with him; he found it hard to differentiate his particular case from the general. He had experienced the extravagant ending of his connexion with a certain personality. A commotion had ensued in the house. There had been a farewell between Clavdia Chauchat and himself, the surviving member of a severed brotherhood; a farewell, uttered in the shadow of a tragic renunciation, and followed by her second departure from the Berghof. Now all these events had put the young man in a frame of mind to find life itself not precisely canny. Everything appeared to have gone permanently and increasingly awry, as though a demonic power—which had indeed for a long time given hints of its malign influence—had suddenly taken control, in a way to induce secret consternation and almost thoughts of flight. The name of the demon was Dumps.","And we can say more. It seemed to Hans Castorp that not only he had come to this dead standstill, but that the world, all of it, the “whole thing,” was in much the same state—or rather , he found it difficult up here to separate the particular from the general. Ever since the eccentric conclusion to his relationship with a certain personality and all the changes that conclusion had set into motion in the sanatorium; ever since Clavdia Chauchat’s renewed departure from the society of those up here, including a respectful, considered farewell to her master’s surviving “brother” exchanged beneath the shadow cast by the tragedy of a great failure—ever since that turning point, it had seemed to the young man as if there were something uncanny about the world and life, as if there were something peculiar, something increasingly askew and disquieting about it, as if a demon had seized power, an evil and crazed demon, who had long exercised considerable influence, but now declared his lordship with such unrestrained candor that he could instill in you secret terrors, even prompt you to think of fleeing."

"Unsere ernste Sorge ist, dies Wort möchte in einem unwürdigen und überholten Sinne mißverstanden und Vorstellungen möchten daran geknüpft werden, die einer verjährten Vorform dessen, was uns als Wahrheit vorschwebt, nicht aber dieser in unermüdlich fortbildenden Versuchen einer musisch gerichteten Technik zur vornehmsten Vollendung entwickelten Wahrheit gerecht werden. Ihr Guten! Das war das armselige Kurbelkästchen nicht, das ehemals wohl, Drehscheibe und Griffel obenauf, Anhängsel eines unförmigen Trompetenschalltrichters aus Messing, von einem Wirtshaustische herunter anspruchslose Ohren mit näselndem Gebrüll erfüllte. Der mattschwarz gebeizte Schrein, der hier, ein wenig tiefer als {965}breit, angeschlossen mit seidenem Kabel an einen elektrischen Steckkontakt der Wand, in schlichter Distinktion auf einem Fachtischchen stand, zeigte mit jener rohen und vorsintflutlichen Maschinerie überhaupt keine Ähnlichkeit mehr. Man öffnete den anmutig sich verjüngenden Deckel, dessen innere, vom Grunde gehobene Messingstütze ihn in schräg schirmender Lage automatisch feststellte, und man gewahrte in flacher Vertiefung die mit grünem Tuch ausgeschlagene Drehscheibe mit Nickelrand und dem gleichfalls vernickelten Mittelzapfen, über den das Loch der Hartgummiplatte zu fügen war. Man bemerkte ferner, rechts seitwärts im Vordergrunde, eine uhrähnlich bezifferte Vorrichtung zur Regelung des Tempos, zur Linken den Hebel, mit dem das Drehwerk in Lauf zu setzen oder zu stoppen war; links hinten aber den gewunden keulenförmigen, in weichen Gelenken beweglichen Hohlarm aus Nickel, mit der flachrunden Schalldose an seinem Ende, deren Schraubwerk die ziehende Nadel zu tragen bestimmt war. Man öffnete auch die Flügel der vorderen Doppeltür und erblickte dahinter ein jalousieartiges Gefüge schräg stehender Leisten aus schwarz gebeiztem Holze – nichts weiter.","Our serious concern is that this word might be misunderstood in an unworthy and outdated sense and that ideas might be attached to it that are an outdated precursor of what we have in mind as truth, but not of this truth developed to the noblest perfection in tireless continuing attempts at a musically directed technique satisfy. you good guys! That wasn't the poor little crank-case that used to fill undemanding ears with a nasal roar from a tavern table, probably with the turntable and stylus on top, appendages to a bulky brass trumpet bell. The matt black stained shrine, which stood here in simple distinction on a small shelf, a little lower than {965}wide, connected with a silk cable to an electrical plug contact in the wall, no longer bore any resemblance at all to that crude and antediluvian machinery. One opened the gracefully tapering lid, whose inner brass support, raised from the ground, automatically fixed it in an obliquely shielding position, and in a shallow depression one saw the turntable lined with green cloth with a nickel rim and the central pin, also nickel-plated, through which the hole in the hard rubber plate was closed add was. One also noticed, on the right side in the foreground, a clock-like numbered device for regulating the tempo, on the left the lever with which the turning gear was to be started or stopped; but behind on the left the twisted club-shaped hollow arm made of nickel, moveable in soft joints, with the flat-round sound box at its end, the screw mechanism of which was intended to carry the pulling needle. You also opened the wings of the front double doors and saw behind them a venetian blind-like structure of slanting strips of black-stained wood - nothing more.","We are seriously concerned lest the term be understood in an unworthy, outworn sense, and ideas attach to it which are applicable only to the primitive form of the instrument we have in mind, never to the elegant product evolved by a tireless application of technical means to the Muses’ own ends. My dear friends, we implore you to realize that the instrument we describe was not that paltry box with a handle to it, a disk and shaft atop and a shapeless brass funnel attached, which used to be set up on the table outside country inns, to gratify the ears of the rude with its nasal braying. This was a case finished in dull ebony, a little deeper than broad, attached by a cord to an electric switch in the wall, and standing chastely on its special table. With the antediluvian mechanism described above, it had nothing in common. You lifted the prettily bevelled lid, which was automatically supported by a brass rod attached on the inside, and there above a slightly depressed surface was the disk, covered with green cloth, with a nickelled rim, and nickelled peg upon which one fitted the hole in the centre of the hard-rubber record. At the right, in front, was a time-regulating device, with a dial and figures like a watch; at the left, the lever, which set the mechanism going or stopped it; and behind, also on the left, the hollow, curving, club-shaped, nickel-plated arm, with its flexible joints, carrying the flat round sound-box at the end, with a fitment into which the needle was screwed. If you opened the double doors at the front of the box, you saw a set of slanting shelves, rather like a blind, stained black like the case—and that was all.","We are seriously concerned that the term may be misunderstood, be associated with undignified and outdated notions, with an obsolete model that in no way does justice to the reality we envision here, the product of untiring advances in musical technology, developed to elegant perfection. My dear friends, this was no wretched crank-box, the old-fashioned sort with a turntable and stylus on top, plus a misshapen, trumpetlike brass appendage, the sort of thing you might have found at one time set up on a tavern counter to fill unsophisticated ears with nasal braying. This small cabinet, a little deeper than it was wide, was stained a dull black, had a silky cord that led to an electrical wall outlet, and stood on its special table in simple dignity—and bore no resemblance whatever to such crude, antediluvian machines. When you lifted the gracefully beveled lid, a well-secured brass rod raised automatically to hold it in place at a protective angle, and inside you saw, set slightly lower, the turntable with its green cloth cover and nickel rim, plus the nickel spindle that fitted into the hole of the ebonite disks. At the front on the right was a device like the dial on a clock for regulating the turntable’s tempo, to its left, the lever that started and stopped it; at the rear on the left, however, was the sinuous, club-shaped nickel tube that had pliant, movable joints and ended in a flat, round sound-box equipped with a screw into which the needle was inserted. When you opened the double doors at the front, you saw a diagonal pattern of wooden louvers stained black—nothing more."

It was probably not really a unified subject, but moved loosely in the spiritual, touching here and there and essentially aiming to demonstrate in a discouraging way and noticeably the ambiguity of the spiritual phenomena of life, the iridescent nature and combative uselessness of the great concepts derived from them make, in how dazzling robe the absolute appears on earth.","It would have been hard to give a name to the subject of this discourse, to which Hans Castorp listened, nodding from time to time as though in partial agreement. We may presume that it was scarcely a connected argument, but rather moved loosely in the realms of the intellectual; in general pointing out, with an accompanying comment which we may characterize as cheerless, the equivocal nature of the spiritual phenomena of life, the changeful aspects and contentious unserviceability of the great abstract conceptions man has based on them, and indicating in what a rainbow-hued garment the Absolute appears upon this earth.","It would have been difficult to give a name to the topic of this improvisation, which Hans Castorp followed only in part, all the while nodding his head in agreement. It probably had no real subject, but instead wandered about freely in intellectual realms, broaching this and that, but essentially it was aimed at proving in dismal fashion that all life’s intellectual phenomena are ambiguous, that nature is equivocal and any grand concepts abstracted from her are strategically useless, and at demonstrating how iridescent are the robes that the Absolute dons on earth."
"Sie gingen in unregelmäßiger Reihe, nebeneinander alle vier, so weit es möglich war, aber bald, wenn Entgegenkommende vorbeigingen, mußte Settembrini, der den rechten Flügel hielt, auf die Fahrstraße treten, bald löste ihre Front durch das Zurückbleiben und Einlenken einzelner Glieder, Naphtas etwa, {565}linkerseits, oder Hans Castorps, der den Platz zwischen dem Humanisten und Vetter Joachim hatte, sich vorübergehend auf. Naphta lachte kurz, mit einer vom Schnupfen sordinierten Stimme, die beim Sprechen an den Klang eines gesprungenen Tellers erinnerte, an den man mit dem Knöchel klopft. Indem er mit dem Kopf seitlich zu dem Italiener hinüberwies, sagte er mit schleppendem Akzent:","They walked in an irregular row, all four side by side, as far as possible, but soon, when oncoming people passed, Settembrini, who was holding the right wing, had to step out onto the roadway, soon their front broke loose by lagging behind and turning individual ranks, naphtas for example, {565}on the left, or Hans Castorps, who occupied the place between the humanist and cousin Joachim, temporarily stood up. Naphta laughed briefly, in a snuffle-controlled voice that, when spoken, sounded like a cracked plate being tapped with your knuckle. Nodding his head sideways at the Italian, he said with a slurred accent:","They were walking in an uneven row, four abreast whenever possible; when people came towards or passed them, Settembrini, on the right wing, had to walk in the road, or else their front for the moment broke up, and one or the other stepped back—either Hans Castorp, between the humanist and Cousin Joachim, or little Naphta on the left side. Naphta would give a short laugh, in a voice dulled by his cold: its quality in speaking was reminiscent of a cracked plate tapped on by the knuckle. Indicating the Italian by a sidewise nod, he said, with a deliberate enunciation:","They walked four abreast in a ragged row, as much as possible, but when they passed people coming from the opposite direction, Settembrini, on the right flank, was forced to step out into the road; or the line would be broken up when someone else temporarily dropped back and yielded the right-of-way—Naphta, for instance, on the left, or Hans Castorp, who had been walking between the humanist and Joachim. Naphta laughed in short bursts muted by his cold, and his voice sounded like a piece of cracked porcelain when you rap it with a knuckle. Tilting his head to point at the Italian, he said with a drawl, “Just listen to our rationalist here, our Voltairian."
"In Wirklichkeit war es noch etwas anderes, wodurch dies gereizte Beben in Joachims Stimme kam und weshalb er des botanischen Kollegs von neulich in fast höhnischem Tone erwähnt hatte. Von diesem Etwas wußte Hans Castorp nichts, oder vielmehr, er wußte nicht, daß Joachim davon wußte, denn er selbst, dieser Durchgänger, dies Sorgenkind des Lebens und der Pädagogik, er wußte nur zu gut davon. Mit einem Worte, Joachim war seinem Vetter auf gewisse Schliche gekommen, er hatte ihn unversehens bei einer Verräterei belauscht, ähnlich derjenigen, deren er sich am Faschingsdienstag schuldig gemacht, – einer neuen Treulosigkeit, verschärft durch den Umstand, an dem nicht zu zweifeln war, daß Hans Castorp sie dauernd verübte.","In fact, there was something else that caused this trembling of irritation in Joachim's voice and why he had recently mentioned the botanical college in an almost sneering tone. Hans Castorp knew nothing about this something, or rather he didn't know that Joachim knew about it, for he himself, this passerby, this problem child of life and education, knew only too well about it. In a word, Joachim had tricked his cousin into certain tricks, he had overheard him committing a treachery similar to that of which he was guilty on Shrove Tuesday—a new disloyalty, aggravated by the fact, of which there was no doubt, that Hans Castorp was constantly committing them.","In reality it was something besides all these that had given the shade of vexation to Joachim’s voice and made him mention the recent botanical lecture with contempt. Hans Castorp did not know this—or rather, he did not know that Joachim knew it; as for himself, he knew it well enough, did this venturesome spirit, this delicate nursling of life, this schoolmaster’s plague! In a word, Joachim had caught his cousin at his tricks again, had found him out in another species of disloyalty, not so unlike the one he had been guilty of on the evening of carnival, only possessed of a still keener point in the circumstance that of this one he made a practice.","In reality, it was something entirely different that brought the edginess to Joachim’s voice and made him mention the recent lecture on botany in such a sarcastic tone. Hans Castorp knew nothing at all about it—or rather, he did not know that Joachim knew; for as a man who had kicked over the traces, as a pedagogic problem child of life, he himself knew what that something was only too well. In a word, Joachim was onto his cousin’s tricks, he had accidentally eavesdropped on an act of betrayal, much like the one Hans Castorp had committed on the evening of Mardi Gras—a new treachery, exacerbated by the indisputable fact that it had become a habit with him."
"»Nun sind es bald acht Jahre,« sagte er, »daß wir dich darüber hielten und daß das Wasser, mit dem du getauft wurdest, da hinein floß … Küster Lassen von St. Jacobi goß es unserem guten Pastor Bugenhagen in die hohle Hand, und von da lief es über deinen Schopf hier in die Schale. Aber wir hatten es gewärmt, damit du nicht erschrecken und nicht weinen solltest, und das tatst du auch nicht, sondern im Gegenteil, du hattest vorher geschrien, so daß Bugenhagen es nicht leicht gehabt hatte mit seiner Rede, aber als das Wasser kam, da wurdest du still, und das war die Achtung vor dem heiligen Sakrament, wollen wir hoffen. Und vierundvierzig Jahre sind es in den nächsten Tagen, da war dein seliger Vater der Täufling, und von seinem Kopf floß das Wasser hier hinein. Das war hier im Haus, seinem Elternhaus, drüben im Saal, vor dem mittleren Fenster, und es war noch der alte Pastor Hesekiel, der ihn taufte, derselbe, den die Franzosen als jungen Menschen beinahe er{40}schossen hätten, weil er gegen ihre Räubereien und Brandschatzungen gepredigt hatte, – der ist nun auch schon lange, lange bei Gott. Aber vor fünfundsiebenzig Jahren, da war ich es selber, den sie tauften, auch da im Saal, und meinen Kopf hielten sie über die Schale hier, wie sie da auf dem Teller steht, und der Geistliche sprach dieselben Worte wie bei dir und deinem Vater, und ebenso floß das warme, klare Wasser von meinem Haar (es war nicht viel mehr damals, als ich jetzt auf dem Kopfe habe) da in das goldene Becken hinein.«","""Now it's almost eight years,"" he said, ""that we held you over it and that the water with which you were baptized flowed into it ... sexton Lassen from St. Jacobi poured it into the cupped hands of our good pastor Bugenhagen, and from there it ran over your tuft here into the bowl. But we had warmed it so that you shouldn't be frightened or cry, and you didn't do that either, on the contrary, you had screamed beforehand, so Bugenhagen hadn't had it easy with his speech, but when the water came, there you fell silent, and that was respect for the holy sacrament, we hope. And it will be forty-four years in the next few days when your blessed father was baptized, and the water flowed in here from his head. That was here in the house, his parents' house, over in the hall, in front of the middle window, and it was the old pastor Ezekiel who baptized him, the same one the French almost shot as a young man because he opposed had preached their robberies and pillages – he has been with God for a long, long time now. But seventy-five years ago, it was me that they baptized, also there in the hall, and they held my head over the bowl here, as it stands there on the plate, and the priest spoke the same words as you and your father , and in the same way the warm, clear water flowed from my hair (it was not much more then than I have on my head now) there into the golden basin.«","“Yes,” he said, “it will soon be eight years since we held you over it, and the water flowed into it from your baptism. Lassen, the sexton of St. Jacob’s, poured it into our good Pastor Bugenhagen’s hand, and it ran out over your little topknot and into the basin. We had warmed it, so it should not frighten you and make you cry, and you did not; you cried beforehand, though, so loud that Bugenhagen could hardly get on with the service, but you stopped when you felt the water—and that, let us hope, was out of respect for the Holy Sacrament. A few days from now it will be forty-four years since your blessed father was a baby at the baptismal font, and it was over his head the water flowed into the basin. That was here in this house, where he was born, in front of the middle dining-room window, and old Pastor Hezekiel was still alive. He was the man the French nearly shot when he was young, because he preached against their burning and looting. He has been with God these many years. Then, five-and-seventy years ago, I was the youngster whose head they held over this selfsame basin; that was in the dining-room too, and the minister spoke the very words that were spoken when you and your father were baptized, and the clear, warm water flowed over my head precisely the same way —there wasn’t much more hair than there is now—and fell into this golden bowl just as it did over yours.”","“And it will soon be eight years now,” he said, “since we held you over it and the water with which you were baptized trickled down into it. Lassen, the sexton from Saint Jacob’s, poured it into the cupped hands of our good Pastor Bugenhagen, and then it ran down over your hair and into the bowl here. But we had warmed it first, so that you wouldn’t be frightened and start crying, and you didn’t, either, quite the contrary, you had been bawling beforehand, making it difficult for Bugenhagen to give his homily, but then came the water, and you fell silent, and that was out of respect for the holy sacrament, let us hope. And in a very few days now, it will be forty-four years since your dear departed father was the baby being baptized, and water ran down from his head into this same bowl. That happened here, in his parents’ home, across the way in the drawing room, in front of the middle window, and it was old Pastor Hesekiel who baptized him, the same one who almost got himself shot by the French when he was a young man, for preaching against their looting and burning—he’s been resting in the Lord for a long, long time now. But seventy-five years ago, it was me they baptized, that was in the drawing room, too, and they held my head over this same bowl sitting on its tray here, and the pastor spoke the same words that were spoken over you and your father, and warm, clear water ran down over my hair, too—there wasn’t much more of it in those days than I have on my head now—and flowed into this golden basin.”"
"»Sie war unter die Decke gekrochen!« sagte Joachim. »Stelle dir meine Empfindungen vor! Der Geistliche stand dicht an der {86}Schwelle und sagte beruhigende Worte, ich sehe ihn noch, er schob immer den Kopf dabei vor und zog ihn dann wieder zurück. Der Kreuzträger und der Ministrant standen noch zwischen Tür und Angel und konnten nicht eintreten. Und ich konnte zwischen ihnen hindurch ins Zimmer sehen. Es ist ja ein Zimmer wie deins und meins, das Bett steht links von der Tür an der Seitenwand, und am Kopfende standen Leute, die Angehörigen natürlich, die Eltern, und redeten auch beschwichtigend auf das Bett hinunter, man sah nichts als eine formlose Masse darin, die bettelte und grauenhaft protestierte und mit den Beinen strampelte.«","""She crawled under the covers!"" said Joachim. “Imagine my feelings! The priest stood close to the {86}threshold and said soothing words, I can still see him, he kept putting his head forward and then pulling it back again. The cross-bearer and the altar boy were still between the door and hinge and could not enter. And I could see between them into the room. It's a room like yours and mine, the bed is on the left of the door on the side wall, and people were standing at the head end, the relatives of course, the parents, and they were also talking soothingly down to the bed, you saw nothing but a shapeless mass in it begging and protesting horribly and kicking her legs.”","“She had crawled down under the covers,” said Joachim. “Imagine how I felt! The priest stood on the threshold and spoke soothingly, I can see now just how he stuck his head out and drew it back again while he talked. The cross-bearer and the acolyte hesitated, and couldn’t get in. I could see between them into the room. It was just like yours and mine, the bed on the side wall left of the door, and people were standing at the head, the relatives of course, the parents, talking soothingly at the bed, where you could see nothing but a formless mass that was begging and protesting horribly, and kicking about with its legs.”","“She had crawled under her blanket,” Joachim said. “Just imagine how I felt. The priest was standing just on the far side of the threshold, speaking soothing words—I can still see him—the way he constantly thrust his head forward and then jerked it back. The cross-bearer and the altar boy were stuck there at the door and couldn’t get in. But I could see between them into the room. It’s a room just like yours or mine, with the bed to the left of the door along one side, and there were people standing at its head, her family of course, her parents, directing comforting words down at the bed, where you could only see a formless mass, begging and protesting hideously and kicking its legs.”"
"{122}»Bester Herr Albin, um Gottes willen, schonen Sie unsere Nerven und bringen Sie uns das entsetzliche Mordding aus den Augen!« mischte sich eine zweite darein, – worauf ein blondköpfiger junger Mann, welcher, eine Zigarette im Munde, seitwärts auf dem vordersten Liegestuhl saß, in frechem Tone erwiderte:","{122}""Best Mr. Albin, for God's sake, spare our nerves and get us out of sight of the horrible murdering!"" a second one joined in, - whereupon a blond-headed young man, who, a cigarette in his mouth, walked sideways sitting in the front deck chair, replied in a cheeky tone:","Then: “Dear Herr Albin, for heaven’s sake, spare our nerves, and take that murderous tool out of our sight,” a second voice chimed in. A blond young man, with a cigarette in his mouth, sitting in the outside easy-chair, responded pertly: “Couldn’t think of it!","“My dear Herr Albin, spare our nerves and remove that dreadful lethal object from view!” a second voice chimed in."
"»Und dann kriegt man heitere Bäckchen!« sagte Hans Castorp. »Sieh an, das ist ja hörenswert. Was der nicht alles weiß –. Er hat es mit Löffeln gegessen. Warte nur, eines Tages entdeckt er dir noch den unbekannten Stoff, der im ganzen Körper verbreitet ist, und stellt die löslichen Gifte her, die berauschend aufs Zentrum wirken, dann kann er die Leute auf eine besondere Weise beschwipsen. Vielleicht war man früher schon einmal so weit. Wenn man ihn hört, so könnte man denken, daß etwas Wahres ist an den Geschichten von Liebestränken und solchem Zeug, wovon in den Sagenbüchern die Rede ist … Gehst du schon?«","""And then you get cheerful cheeks!"" said Hans Castorp. “Look, that's worth hearing. What he doesn't know -. He ate it with spoons. Just wait, one day he'll discover the unknown substance that's spread throughout the body and make the soluble poisons that intoxicate the core, then he can get people tipsy in a special way. Maybe you've gotten that far before. Hearing it, you'd think there was some truth to the tales of love potions and stuff like that the saga books talk about...Are you going already?'","“And so you get the hectic flush,” said Hans Castorp. “But that’s all worth hearing. What doesn’t the man know! He must have simply lapped it up. You just wait, one of these days he will discover what that substance is that exists everywhere in the body and sets free the soluble toxins that act like a narcotic on the nervous system; then he will be able to fuddle us all more than ever. Perhaps in the past they were able to do that very thing. When I listen to him, I could almost think there is some truth in the old legends about love potions and the like.—Are you going?”","“So that’s what causes flushed cheeks,” Hans Castorp said. “Think of it, that’s something worth learning. The things that man knows! He’s a regular fountain of information. Just wait, someday soon he’ll identify that substance present throughout the body, and he’ll manufacture those by-products himself, the ones with the intoxicating effect on the spinal cord. He can really get folk tipsy, then. It may well be that people knew the trick of it at one time. Listening to him makes you think there’s something to those stories about love potions and the other stuff they talk about in old sagas. Are you going now?”"
"Das Atom war ein energiegeladenes kosmisches System, worin Weltkörper rotierend um ein sonnenhaftes Zentrum rasten, und durch dessen Ätherraum mit Lichtjahrgeschwindigkeit Kometen fuhren, welche die Kraft des Zentralkörpers in ihre exzentrischen Bahnen zwang. Das war so wenig nur ein Vergleich, wie es nur ein solcher war, wenn man den Leib der vielzelligen Wesen einen »Zellenstaat« nannte. Die Stadt, der Staat, die nach dem Prinzip der Arbeitsteilung geordnete soziale Gemeinschaft war dem organischen Leben nicht nur zu vergleichen, sie wiederholte es. So wiederholte sich im Innersten der Natur, in weitester Spiegelung, die makrokosmische Sternenwelt, deren Schwärme, Haufen, Gruppen, Figuren, bleich vom Monde, zu Häupten des vermummten Adepten über dem frostglitzernden Tale schwebten. War es unerlaubt, zu denken, daß gewisse Planeten des atomischen Sonnensystems – dieser Heere und Milchstraßen von Sonnensystemen, die die Materie aufbauten, – daß also einer oder der andere dieser innerweltlichen Weltkörper sich in einem Zustande befand, der demjenigen entsprach, der die Erde zu einer Wohnstätte des Lebens machte? Für einen im Zentrum etwas be{431}schwipsten jungen Adepten von »abnormer« Hautbeschaffenheit, der im Gebiete des Unerlaubten ja nicht mehr all und jeder Erfahrung entbehrte, war das eine nicht nur nicht ungereimte, sondern sogar bis zur Aufdringlichkeit sich nahelegende, höchst einleuchtende Spekulation von logischem Wahrheitsgepräge. Die »Kleinheit« der innerweltlichen Sternkörper wäre ein sehr unsachgemäßer Einwand gewesen, denn der Maßstab von Groß und Klein war spätestens damals abhanden gekommen, als der kosmische Charakter der »kleinsten« Stoffteile sich offenbart hatte, und die Begriffe des Außen und Innen hatten nachgerade gleichfalls in ihrer Standfestigkeit gelitten. Die Welt des Atoms war ein Außen, wie höchstwahrscheinlich der Erdenstern, den wir bewohnten, organisch betrachtet, ein tiefes Innen war. Hatte nicht die träumerische Kühnheit eines Forschers von »Milchstraßentieren« gesprochen, – kosmischen Ungeheuern, deren Fleisch, Bein und Gehirn sich aus Sonnensystemen aufbaute? War dem aber so, wie Hans Castorp dachte, dann fing in dem Augenblick, da man geglaubt hatte, zu Rande gekommen zu sein, das Ganze von vorn an! Dann lag vielleicht im Innersten und Aberinnersten seiner Natur er selbst, der junge Hans Castorp, noch einmal, noch hundertmal, warm eingehüllt, in einer Balkonloge mit Aussicht in die mondhelle Hochgebirgsfrostnacht und studierte mit erstarrten Fingern und heißem Gesicht aus humanistisch-medizinischer Anteilnahme das Körperleben?","The atom was a cosmic system charged with energy, in which celestial bodies rotated around a sun-like center, and through whose etheric space camets passed at light-year speeds, which the force of the central body forced into their eccentric orbits. That was just as little a comparison as calling the body of multicellular beings a ""cellular state."" The city, the state, the social community organized according to the principle of the division of labor were not only comparable to organic life, they repeated it. Thus, in the innermost part of nature, the macrocosmic world of stars was repeated in the widest reflection, whose swarms, heaps, groups, figures, pale from the moon, hovered over the frosty glittering valley at the head of the hooded adept. Was it unlawful to think that certain planets of the atomic solar system—those hosts and galaxies of solar systems that build up matter—that one or the other of these inner-worldly celestial bodies was in a state corresponding to that which the earth made a dwelling place of life? For a somewhat tipsy young adept with an ""abnormal"" skin condition, who was no longer lacking in any experience in the field of the forbidden, this was not only not absurd, but even obvious to the point of being obtrusive, highly plausible Speculation of logical truth character. The ""smallness"" of the inner-worldly stellar bodies would have been a very improper objection, for the standard of big and small had been lost at the latest when the cosmic character of the ""smallest"" parts of matter had revealed itself, and the concepts of outside and inside were now exactly the same suffered in their stability. The world of the atom was an outside, as most likely the Earth star we inhabited was, considered organically, a deep inside. Had not a researcher's dreamy boldness spoken of ""Milky Way animals""—cosmic monsters whose flesh, leg, and brain were made up of solar systems? But if that was the way Hans Castorp thought, then the moment you thought you had come to the end, the whole thing started all over again! Then maybe in the innermost and innermost of his nature he himself, the young Hans Castorp, lay again, a hundred times more, wrapped up warmly, in a balcony box with a view of the moonlit night of frost in the high mountains and studied bodily life with frozen fingers and a hot face out of humanistic-medical sympathy ?","The atom was a cosmic system, laden with energy; in which heavenly bodies rioted rotating about a centre like a sun; through whose ethereal space comets drove with the speed of light years, kept in their eccentric orbits by the power of the central body. And that was as little a mere comparison as it would be were one to call the body of any multiple-celled organism a “cell state.” The city, the state, the social community regulated according to the principle of division of labour, not only might be compared to organic life, it actually reproduced its conditions. Thus in the inmost recesses of nature, as in an endless succession of mirrors, was reflected the macrocosm of the heavens, whose clusters, throngs, groups, and figures, paled by the brilliant moon, hung over the dazzling, frost-bound valley, above the head of our muffled adept. Was it too bold a thought that among the planets of the atomic solar system—those myriads and milky ways of solar systems which constituted matter—one or other of these inner-worldly heavenly bodies might find itself in a condition corresponding to that which made it possible for our earth to become the abode of life? For a young man already rather befuddled inwardly, suffering from abnormal skin-conditions, who was not without all and any experience in the realm of the illicit, it was a speculation which, far from being absurd, appeared so obvious as to leap to the eyes, highly evident, and bearing the stamp of logical truth. The “smallness” of these innerworldly heavenly bodies would have been an objection irrelevant to the hypothesis; since the conception of large or small had ceased to be pertinent at the moment when the cosmic character of the “smallest” particle of matter had been revealed; while at the same time, the conceptions of “outside” and “inside” had also been shaken. The atom-world was an “outside,” as, very probably, the earthly star on which we dwelt was, organically regarded, deeply “inside.” Had not a researcher once, audaciously fanciful, referred to the “beasts of the Milky Way,” cosmic monsters whose flesh, bone, and brain were built up out of solar systems? But in that case, Hans Castorp mused, then in the moment when one thought to have come to the end, it all began over again from the beginning! For then, in the very innermost of his nature, and in the inmost of that innermost, perhaps there was just himself, just Hans Castorp, again and a hundred times Hans Castorp, with burning face and stiffening fingers, lying muffled on a balcony, with a view across the moonlit, frost-nighted high valley, and probing, with an interest both humanistic and medical, into the life of the body!","The atom was an energy-laden cosmic system, in which planets rotated frantically around a sunlike center, while comets raced through its ether at the speed of light, held in their eccentric orbits by the gravity of the core. That was not merely a metaphor—any more than it would be a metaphor to call the body of a multicelled creature a “city of cells.” A city, a state, a social community organized around the division of labor was not merely comparable to organic life, it repeated it. And in the same way, the innermost recesses of nature were repeated, mirrored on a vast scale, in the macrocosmic world of stars, whose swarms, clusters, groupings, and constellations, pale against the moon, hovered above the valley glistening with frost and above the head of this master of muffled masquerade. Was it illicit to think that certain planets of the atomic solar system—among all those hosts of solar systems in all those milky ways that constituted matter—that the state of some planet or other in that inner world might not correspond to the conditions that made the earth an abode of life? For a slightly tipsy young master of the muffling art with an “abnormal” skin condition, who was no longer totally lacking in experience when it came to illicit matters, this was a speculation that bore the stamp of logic and truth and, far from being absurd, seemed as perfectly obvious as it was illuminating. Once the cosmic character of the “smallest” bits of matter became apparent, any objection about the “smallness” of these stars in the inner world would have been quite irrelevant—and concepts like inner and outer had now lost their foundation as well. The world of the atom was an outer world, just as it was highly probable that the earthly star on which we lived was a profoundly inner world when regarded organically. Had not one researcher in his visionary boldness spoken of the “beasts of the milky way”—cosmic monsters whose flesh, bones, and brains were formed from solar systems? But if that was so, as Hans Castorp believed it to be, then at the very moment when one thought one had reached the outermost edge, everything began all over again. But that meant, did it not, that perhaps in inner world after inner world within his own nature he was present over and over again—a hundred young Hans Castorps, all wrapped up warmly, but with numbed fingers and flushed face, gazing out from a balcony onto a frosty, moonlit night high in the Alps and studying, out of humanistic and medical interest, the life of the human body?"
"Er riß das Thermometer aus dem Munde, so heftig, wie vorher nur einmal: nach erster Benutzung, nachdem die Oberin ihm eben das zierliche Werkzeug verkauft, und blickte mit ebensolcher Begierde wie damals darauf nieder. Merkurius war kräftig emporgewandert, er zeigte siebenunddreißig-acht, fast –neun.","He snatched the thermometer out of his mouth as violently as he had only once before: after using it for the first time, after the matron had just sold him the dainty tool, and looked down at it with the same eagerness as before. Mercury had risen vigorously, showing thirty-seven-eight, almost -nine.","He tore the thermometer out of his mouth, violently as never before save when the Oberin had sold him the toy and he had first used it. He looked at it with the same avid curiosity now as then. Ah, Mercurius had indeed bounded upwards: he stood at 100.5°, almost .6°.","He pulled the thermometer from his mouth, more violently than he had ever done before, except for that first time, the day the head nurse had sold him this dainty gadget, and he gazed down at it with the same eagerness as he had then. Mercury had climbed very robustly, reaching 100 degrees, almost 100.2."
{1032}»Ziem – ßen –!«,"{1032}""Ziem - eat -!""",sen!”,"He was bending worriedly down over her, when he heard Frau Stöhr say in a whimpering peep: “Ziems—sen!”"
»Auf halb vier Uhr.«,"""To three-thirty.""","And Joachim, with a quick look at his cousin, answered, drawing his heels together as he sat: “For half past three.”","She now continued, “Mine is for three forty-five."
"»Gut«, dachte Hans Castorp. »Schön«, dachte er. Und sogar etwas wie »Bitte sehr!« fügte er innerlich hinzu. »Wenn du eine Ahnung hättest!« sagte er in Gedanken zu dem sich Nähernden. Mit einem Worte, er nahm die Meldung mit großer Ruhe auf, gab sie übrigens an Hofrat Behrens und an die Verwaltung weiter, ließ ein Zimmer bereitstellen – das Zimmer Joachims war noch zur Verfügung – und fuhr am übernächsten Tage, um die Stunde seiner eigenen Ankunft, abends gegen acht also, es war schon dunkel, mit demselben harten Vehikel, in dem er Joachim fortgeleitet, zum Bahnhof »Dorf«, um den Sendboten des Flachlandes abzuholen, der nach dem Rechten sehen wollte.","""Good,"" thought Hans Castorp. ""Nice,"" he thought. And even something like ""There you are!"" he added inwardly. ""If you had any idea!"" he said in his mind to the approaching man. In a word, he received the report with great calm, passed it on to Hofrat Behrens and the administration, had a room made available - Joachim's room was still available - and left the day after next, at the hour of his own arrival So, around eight o'clock in the evening, it was already dark, with the same hard vehicle in which he had taken Joachim away, to the ""Dorf"" train station to pick up the messenger from the lowlands, who wanted to check on things.","“Good,” thought Hans Castorp. “Excellent,” he thought. And added to himself something like “Don’t mention it!” “If you only knew!” he silently apostrophized the oncoming one. In a word, he took the approaching visit with utter composure; announced it to Hofrat Behrens and the management, engaged a room—Joachim’s, it being still vacant—and on the next day but one, at the hour of his own arrival, towards eight o’clock—it was already dark—drove in the same uncomfortable vehicle in which he had seen Joachim off, down to station “Dorf, ” to meet the envoy from the flat-land, who had come to spy out the land.","“Fine,” Hans Castorp thought. “Lovely,” he thought. And even silently added something like, “Just as he pleases.” And addressing the approaching visitor, he thought, “If you only knew!” In short, he received the news with great calm, passed word along to both Director Behrens and management, had them ready a room—Joachim’s old one was still available. Two days later, at around eight in the evening, the same time of day that he himself had arrived—although it was dark now—he hired the same hard-riding vehicle in which he had seen Joachim off, to take him to the station in Dorf and fetch the envoy from the flatlands who had come to check up on him."
"Das Gespräch fuhr noch fort, sich mit der Pietà zu beschäftigen, da Hans Castorp mit Blick und Wort an dem Gegenstand festhielt, wobei er sich an Herrn Settembrini wandte und diesen gleichsam mit dem Kunstwerk in kritischen Kontakt zu setzen suchte, – während ja der Abscheu des Humanisten gegen diesen Zimmerschmuck deutlich genug in der Miene zu lesen war, mit der er sich danach umwandte: denn er hatte sich mit dem Rücken gegen jenen Winkel gesetzt. Zu höflich, um alles zu sagen, was er dachte, beschränkte er sich darauf, Fehlerhaftigkeiten in den Verhältnissen und den Körperformen der Gruppe zu beanstanden, Verstöße gegen die Naturwahrheit, die weit entfernt seien, rührend auf ihn zu wirken, da sie nicht frühzeitlichem Unvermögen, sondern bösem Willen, einem grundfeindlichen Prinzip entsprängen, – worin Naphta ihm boshaft zustimmte. Gewiß, von technischem Ungeschick könne nicht entfernt die Rede sein. Es handle sich um bewußte Emanzipation des Geistes vom Natürlichen, dessen Verächtlichkeit durch die Verweigerung jeder Demut davor religiös verkündet werde. Als aber Settembrini die Vernachlässigung der Natur und ihres Studiums für menschlich abwegig erklärte und gegen die absurde Formlosigkeit, der das Mittelalter und die ihm nachahmenden Epochen gefrönt hätten, das griechisch-römische Erbe, den Klassizismus, Form, Schönheit, Vernunft und naturfromme Heiterkeit, die allein die Sache des Menschen zu fördern berufen seien, in prallen Worten zu erheben begann, mischte Hans Castorp sich ein und fragte, was denn aber bei solcher Bewandtnis mit Plotinus los sei, der sich nachweislich seines Körpers geschämt, und mit Voltaire, der im Namen der Vernunft gegen das skandalöse Erdbeben von Lis{597}sabon revoltiert habe? Absurd? Das sei auch absurd gewesen, aber wenn man alles recht überlege, so könne man seiner Ansicht nach das Absurde recht wohl als das geistig Ehrenhafte bezeichnen, und die absurde Naturfeindschaft der gotischen Kunst sei am Ende ebenso ehrenhaft gewesen wie das Gebaren der Plotinus und Voltaire, denn es drücke sich dieselbe Emanzipation von Fatum und Faktum darin aus, derselbe unknechtische Stolz, der sich weigere, vor der dummen Macht, nämlich vor der Natur, abzudanken …","The conversation continued to deal with the Pietà, since Hans Castorp clung to the object with eyes and words, turning to Mr. Settembrini and trying to put him in critical contact with the work of art, as it were - while the disgust of the humanist against this decoration of the room could be read clearly enough in the expression with which he turned around to see it: for he had sat down with his back to that corner. Too polite to say all he thought, he confined himself to complaining about imperfections in the group's circumstances and bodily forms, violations of natural truth which were far from affecting him, since they were not due to early incapacity , but out of bad will, a fundamentally hostile principle, - in which Naphta maliciously agreed with him. Certainly, one cannot remotely speak of technical clumsiness. It is a question of the conscious emancipation of the spirit from the natural, the contempt of which is proclaimed religiously through the refusal of any humility before it. But when Settembrini declared the neglect of nature and its study to be humanly absurd, and against the absurd formlessness to which the Middle Ages and the epochs imitating it had indulged, the Greco-Roman heritage, classicism, form, beauty, reason and natural serenity, the Hans Castorp intervened and asked what was the matter with Plotinus, who was demonstrably ashamed of his body, and with Voltaire, who was in the name of reason revolted against the scandalous Lisbon earthquake? Absurd? That, too, was absurd, but if one thinks about everything properly, in his opinion one can quite well call the absurd spiritually honorable, and the absurd hostility to nature of Gothic art was ultimately just as honorable as the behavior of Plotinus and Voltaire, for it expresses the same emancipation from fate and fact, the same unservile pride that refuses to abdicate before stupid power, namely nature...","The conversation continued on the subject of the pietà, Hans Castorp holding it to the point with look and word, and turning to the humanist as though to put him in critical rapport with the work of art. Herr Settembrini’s aversion was obvious in the very air with which he turned towards it—for he had originally sat down with his back to that corner of the room. He was too polite to express all he felt, and confined himself to pointing out certain defects in the physical proportions of the work, offences against nature, which were far from working upon his emotions, because they did not spring from archaic ineptitude, but from deliberate bad intent—a fundamentally opposed principle.—In which latter statement Naphta maliciously concurred. Certainly, there was no question of technical lack of skill. What we had here was conscious emancipation from the natural, a contempt for nature manifested by a pious refusal to pay her any homage whatever. Whereupon Settembrini declared that disregard of nature and neglect of her study only led men into error. He characterized as absurd the formlessness to which the Middle Ages and all periods like them had been a prey, and began, in sounding words, to exalt the Græco-Roman heritage, classicism, form, and beauty, reason, the pagan joy of life. To these things and these alone, he said, was it given to ameliorate man’s lot on earth. Hans Castorp broke in here. What, he asked, about Plotinus, then, who was known to have said that he was ashamed of having a body? Or Voltaire, who, in the name of reason, protested against the scandalous Lisbon earthquake? Were they absurd? Perhaps. Yet it seemed to him, as he thought about it, that what one characterized as absurd might also be thought of as intellectually honourable; from which it would follow that the absurd hostility to nature evinced by Gothic art, when all was said and done, was as fine in its way as the gestures of Plotinus or Voltaire, since it testified to the selfsame emancipation, the same indomitable pride, which refused to abdicate in favour of blind natural forces—","The topic of conversation continued to be the pietà, for Hans Castorp kept both one eye and his remarks fixed on it as he turned now to Herr Settembrini, trying to bring him into critical contact, as it were, with the work of art, even though the humanist’s aversion to this bit of decor could very easily be read from the expression on his face when he twisted around to look at it—he had taken a seat with his back to that particular corner. Too polite to say what he thought, he confined himself to remarks concerning errors in proportion and anatomical defects in the figures; such offenses against the truth of nature did not come close to moving him, he said, since they were based not on any primitive lack of skill but arose out of willful malice, out of an antagonistic principle. And Naphta maliciously agreed, saying that it certainly was not a question of any lack of technical skill. It was, rather, a matter of the emancipation of the Spirit from the bonds of nature, indeed, the work proclaimed a religious contempt for nature by refusing’ to submit to it. But when Settembrini declared that such a neglect of nature and a refusal to study her led humankind down a false path and then began in taut words to contrast an absurd formlessness—to which the Middle Ages and epochs that imitated it were addicted—with classicism, with the Greco-Roman heritage of form, beauty, reason, and serenity born of natural piety, for classicism alone was destined to further the human enterprise, Hans Castorp interrupted him and asked how all that fitted in with Plotinus, who, as was well known, was ashamed of his own body, and with Voltaire, who in the name of reason had rebelled against the scandalous earthquake in Lisbon? Absurd? Yes, this work, too, was absurd, but when one stopped and considered the matter, one could, in his opinion, call absurdity an intellectually honorable position, and so the absurd enmity toward nature in Gothic art was ultimately as honorable as the gesture of a Plotinus or a Voltaire, for it expressed the same emancipation from facts and givens, the same proud unwillingness to be enslaved, the same refusal to submit to dumb powers, that is, to nature."
"{144}Am dritten Tage jedoch war es genau, als ob die Natur zu Falle gebracht und jede Ordnung auf den Kopf gestellt würde; Hans Castorp traute seinen Augen nicht. Es war nach der Hauptmahlzeit, und man befand sich seit zwanzig Minuten in der Liegekur, als die Sonne sich eilig verbarg, häßlich torfbraunes Gewölk über die südöstlichen Kämme heraufzog und ein Wind von fremder Luftbeschaffenheit, kalt und das Gebein erschreckend, als käme er aus unbekannten, eisigen Gegenden, plötzlich durch das Tal fegte, die Temperatur umstürzte und ein ganz neues Regiment eröffnete.","{144}On the third day, however, it was exactly as if nature were being tumbled and every order turned upside down; Hans Castorp couldn't believe his eyes. It was after main meal, and they had been resting for twenty minutes, when the sun hurriedly disappeared, ugly peat-brown clouds came up over the south-eastern ridges, and a wind of a strange quality, cold and chilling the bones as if from unknown ones , icy regions, suddenly swept through the valley, the temperature plunged and opened a whole new regiment.","But on the third day it seemed as though nature suffered a sudden reserve; everything turned topsy-turvy. Hans Castorp could scarcely trust his eyes. It happened when they were lying in their balconies, some twenty minutes after the midday meal. Swiftly the sun hid its face, ugly turf-coloured clouds drew up over the south-western ridge, and a wind from a strange quarter, whose chill pierced to the marrow, as though it came out of some unknown icy region, swept suddenly through the valley; down went the thermometer—a new order obtained.","On the third day, however, it was as if nature had taken a tumble—everything was turned upside down. Hans Castorp did not believe his own eyes. It was just after dinner and they had all been lying in the rest cure for twenty minutes or so, when the sun abruptly hid itself, ugly peat-brown clouds moved in from over the ridges to the southeast, and a wind bearing cold, alien air that went to your bones and seemed to have come from unknown regions of ice suddenly swept down through the valley, setting the temperature plunging and inaugurating a whole new regimen."
"»Feigling!« schrie Naphta, indem er mit diesem Aufschrei der Menschlichkeit das Zugeständnis machte, daß mehr Mut dazu gehöre, zu schießen, als auf sich schießen zu lassen, hob seine Pistole auf eine Weise, die nichts mehr mit Kampf zu tun hatte, und schoß sich in den Kopf.","""Coward!"" cried Naphta, conceding with that cry of humanity that it takes more courage to shoot than to be shot, raising his pistol in a way that had nothing to do with fighting. and shot himself in the head.","“Coward!” Naphta shrieked; and with this human shriek confessing that it takes more courage to fire than be fired upon, raised his pistol in a way that had nothing to do with duelling, and shot himself in the head.","Naphta screamed, conceding with this very human cry that it requires more courage to shoot than to be shot at, raised his pistol to a position that had nothing to do with the duel, and shot himself in the head."
"»Nein«, sagte Joachim. »›Je le regrette beaucoup‹ war ja soweit ganz richtig.«","""No,"" said Joachim. »'Je le regrette beaucoup' was quite correct so far.«","“No,” Joachim answered, “ ‘ Je le regrette beaucoup’ was perfectly right as far as it went.”","“No,” Joachim said. “ ‘Je le regrette beaucoup’ was quite correct as far as that goes.”"
"Um 7 Uhr war die Sonne weit entfernt, hinter ihrem Berge hervorzukommen, aber es tagte mühsam qualmend, als Hans Castorp nach unruhig verbrachter Nacht Haus Berghof verließ, um sich zum Rendezvous zu begeben. Dienstmägde, die die Halle putzten, sahen verwundert von der Arbeit nach ihm auf. Er fand jedoch das Haupttor nicht mehr verschlossen: Ferge und Wehsal, einzeln oder zu zweien, hatten es gewiß schon passiert, der eine, um Settembrini, der andere, um Naphta zum Kampfplatze abzuholen. Er, Hans, ging allein, da seine Eigenschaft als Unparteiischer ihm nicht gestattete, sich einer der beiden Parteien anzuschließen.","At 7 o'clock the sun was far away from coming out from behind its mountain, but it was suffocatingly smoking when Hans Castorp left the Berghof house after a restless night to go on a rendezvous. Maids cleaning the hall looked up at him in surprise from their work. However, he found the main gate no longer locked: Ferge and Wehsal, alone or in pairs, had certainly already passed through, one to fetch Settembrini, the other to fetch Naphta to the battlefield. He, Hans, went alone, since his capacity as referee did not permit him to join either party.","At seven o’clock next morning, the sun showed no sign of making an appearance above the mountain; yet day was dawning, difficultly, in a reek of mist, as Hans Castorp, after a restless night, left the Berghof to go to the rendezvous. The maidservants cleaning the hall looked after him in wonder. The house door, however, was unbolted; Ferge and Wehsal, alone or in company, had undoubtedly passed that threshold, the one to accompany Settembrini, the other Naphta, to the field of battle. He, Hans, went alone, his capacity of neutral not permitting him to attach himself to either party.","At seven o’clock the sun was a long way from emerging from behind their mountain, but day was struggling to break through the mist as Hans Castorp, after a very restless night, left the Berghof for the rendezvous. Housemaids cleaning the lobby looked up from their work in astonishment. The front door was no longer locked, however. Ferge and Wehsal, either singly or together, had surely passed through it already, the one to fetch Settembrini, the other to accompany Naphta to the battlefield. Hans walked alone, since in his capacity as a neutral observer he was not allowed to join either party."
"Soweit Herr Ferge, der einzige in der kleinen Gesellschaft, der außer allen hin und wider laufenden Beziehungen stand. Was aber diese betraf, so gibt es zwei kurze Unterredungen aufzuzeichnen, zwei wunderliche Konversationen unter vier Augen, geführt zu jener Zeit von unserem unheldischen Helden mit Clawdia Chauchat und ihrem Reisebegleiter: mit jedem einzeln, die eine in der Halle, um eine Abendstunde, während die »Störung« droben im Fieber lag, die andre eines Nachmittags an Mynheers Lager …","So much for Mr. Ferge, the only one in the little company who was completely out of touch with all kinds of connections. But as to these, there are to be recorded two brief intercourses, two whimsical private conversations, conducted at that time by our unheroic hero with Clawdia Chauchat and her traveling companion: each one separately, one in the hall, at one hour of the evening, during the ""disorder"" upstairs was in a fever, the other one afternoon at Mynheer's camp...","Thus Herr Ferge, the complete outsider, the only member of the group who stood detached from its complicated relationships. But now that we speak of these, it will be well to relate two conversations, two priceless conversations à deux, which our unheroic hero had, the first with Clavdia Chauchat, the second with the present companion of her travels; one in the hall, on an evening when the disturbing element lay above with a fever; the other on an afternoon by Mynheer’s bedside.","Such were the tales of Herr Ferge, the only person in the little group who stood outside its interwoven relationships. Speaking of which, there are two brief conversations from this same period that should be recorded, two curious, tête-à-tête interchanges our unheroic hero had with Clavdia Chauchat and her traveling companion, with each of them alone, that is—the first in the lobby one evening, when the “bothersome disruption” was lying upstairs with a fever; the second, one afternoon at Mynheer’s bedside."
"Ferner fühlte er, daß ganz unnötigerweise der Hofrat ihm empfohlen hatte, hier oben seiner Anämie wegen sich den Gebräuchen der Kranken anzuschließen: das ergab sich von selbst, es bestand, wie es schien, gar keine andere Denkbarkeit, und wie weit, vermöge Hans Castorps Ruhe und unberührbarer Selbstsicherheit, dies eben nur so schien, wie weit in der Tat und unbedingt genommen nichts anderes möglich und denkbar war, das war für einen wohlerzogenen Menschen von Anfang an nicht zu unterscheiden. Nichts konnte einleuchtender sein, als daß nach der ersten Liegekur das ausgiebige zweite Frühstück erfolgte, aus welchem der Lustwandel nach »Platz« hinunter überzeugend sich ergab, – und danach wickelte Hans Castorp seinen Onkel wieder ein. Er wickelte ihn ein, das war das Wort. Und in der Herbstsonne, auf einem Stuhl, dessen Bequemlichkeit völlig unbestreitbar, ja höchst rühmenswert war, ließ er ihn liegen, wie er selber lag, bis der erschütternde Gong zu einem Mittagessen im Kreise der Patientenschaft rief, das sich als erstklassig, tip-top und dermaßen ausgiebig erwies, daß der sich anschließende General-Liegedienst mehr als äu{656}ßerer Brauch, daß er innere Notwendigkeit war und aus persönlichster Überzeugung geübt wurde. So ging es fort bis zum gewaltigen Souper und zur Abendgeselligkeit im Salon mit den optischen Scherzinstrumenten, – es gab gegen eine Tagesordnung, die sich mit so milder Selbstverständlichkeit aufdrängte, ganz einfach nichts zu erinnern, und auch dann hätte sie keine Gelegenheit zu Einwänden geboten, wenn nicht des Konsuls kritische Fähigkeiten durch ein Befinden herabgesetzt gewesen wären, das er nicht geradezu Übelbefinden nennen wollte, das sich aber aus Müdigkeit und Aufregung bei gleichzeitigen Hitze- und Frostgefühlen lästig zusammensetzte.","He felt, moreover, that the Councilor had unnecessarily recommended that he join the customs of the sick up here because of his anemia: that was a matter of course, there seemed to be no other possibility, and how far, by Hans Castorps Calmness and untouchable self-confidence, which only seemed so, to the extent that nothing else was actually and absolutely possible and conceivable, that was indistinguishable for a well-bred person from the start. Nothing could be more plausible than that after the first rest cure, there was an extensive second breakfast, from which the stroll down to ""Platz"" was convincingly evident - and then Hans Castorp wrapped up his uncle again. He wrapped him up, that was the word. And in the autumn sun, in a chair whose comfort was utterly undeniable, indeed most commendable, he left it lying there until the shattering gong rang for a luncheon with the patient community that proved first-rate, tip-top and proved so extensively that the subsequent general lying duty was more than an external custom, that it was an inner necessity and was practiced out of personal conviction. So it went on up to the great supper and the evening socializing in the salon with the optical joke instruments - there was simply nothing to remember against an agenda that imposed itself with such mild self-evidence, and even then it would not have offered any opportunity for objections, if the Consul's critical abilities had not been reduced by a condition that he did not want to call downright ill health, but which was made up of tiredness and excitement combined with feelings of heat and chills, which was bothersome.","And furthermore he felt that it had been superfluous for the Hofrat to advise him, on account of his anæmia, to live during his stay here as the patients did. For, it appeared, this followed of itself; no other course seemed possible. This was perhaps partly the fruit of his nephew’s calm and invulnerable self-assurance; perhaps it was not absolutely the only and inevitable course to pursue—but how was a man of his breeding to distinguish? Nothing could be clearer than that the abundant second breakfast should follow upon the rest period, after which the stroll down to the Platz appeared the natural and inevitable sequence—and then Hans Castorp did his uncle up again. He did him up—the right phrase for it—and there, in the autumn sunlight, in a chair whose qualities should be sung rather than spoken, he let him lie, until a clanging gong summoned the patients to the midday meal. So lavish was it, so altogether tiptop and first-rate, that the main rest period which ensued seemed an inward necessity rather than an outward conformity, and James participated in it with the sincerest personal conviction. And so on until the mighty supper and the social evening in the salon with the optical diversions. What objection could be brought against a daily regimen like that, which so blandly took acquiescence for granted? None, surely, even though the Consul’s critical powers had not been diminished by a physical discomfort which, while not actual illness, yet, composed of mingled fatigue and excitement, with the concomitants of chill and feverishness, was burdensome enough.","He felt, moreover, that it had been quite unnecessary for the director to suggest he adopt the customs of the patients here because of his anemia—he would have done so all on his own. No other course of action was conceivable, or so it seemed. To what extent Hans Castorp’s calm, callous self-assurance made things seem that way, and to what extent they actually were that way, making any other course of action indeed inconceivable and impossible—that was, from the very start, something no well-bred gentleman could have decided. Nothing, then, could be more obvious than that the first rest cure would be followed by a lavish second breakfast, leading inevitably to a promenade down to Platz, whereupon Hans Castorp tied his uncle up again—tied him up, there was no other word for it—and left him lying there under an autumn sun in a lounge chair whose comfort was quite indisputable, indeed laudable, just as he himself lay there until the vibrating gong called them back into the society of patients for their midday meal, which turned out to be first-class, tip-top, and so lavish that the ensuing rest cure was more than mere custom, but a true necessity performed out of personal conviction. And so the day proceeded until the substantial supper, which was followed by a gathering in the social rooms, with optical gadgets for everyone’s amusement. How could there be any objection to the pressures of a daily schedule so gentle and so self-evident; indeed, there could have been no reason whatever to object, even if the consul’s critical abilities had not been diminished by a condition that he could not actually call sickness, but that consisted of both fatigue and agitation, accompanied by a sense of being simultaneously feverish and chilled."
"»Allerdings, der Tierkreis; zodiacus. Die uralten Himmelszeichen, – Skorpion, Schütze, Steinbock, aquarius und wie sie heißen, wie soll man sich dafür nicht interessieren!

"»Sauerstoff«, sagte der Hofrat. »Das ist Oxygen, was Sie in den Lüften spüren.

"Was war also das Leben? Es war Wärme, das Wärmeprodukt formerhaltender Bestandlosigkeit, ein Fieber der Materie, von welchem der Prozeß unaufhörlicher Zersetzung und Wiederherstellung unhaltbar verwickelt, unhaltbar kunstreich aufgebauter Eiweißmolekel begleitet war. Es war das Sein des eigentlich Nicht-sein-Könnenden, des nur in diesem verschränkten und fiebrigen Prozeß von Zerfall und Erneuerung mit süß-schmerzlich-genauer Not auf dem Punkte des Seins Balancierenden. Es war nicht materiell, und es war nicht Geist. Es war etwas zwischen beidem, ein Phänomen, getragen von Materie, gleich dem Regenbogen auf dem Wasserfall und gleich der Flamme. Aber wiewohl nicht materiell, war es sinnlich bis zur Lust und zum Ekel, die Schamlosigkeit der selbstempfindlich-reizbar gewordenen Materie, die unzüchtige Form des Seins. Es war ein heimlich-fühlsames Sichregen in der keuschen Kälte des Alls, eine wollüstig-verstohlene Unsauberkeit von Nährsaugung und Ausscheidung, ein exkretorischer Atemhauch von Kohlensäure und üblen Stoffen verborgener Herkunft und Beschaffenheit. Es war das durch Überausgleich seiner Unbeständigkeit ermöglichte und in eingeborene Bildungsgesetze gebannte Wuchern, Sichentfalten und Gestaltbilden von etwas Gedunsenem aus Wasser, Eiweiß, Salz und Fetten, welches man Fleisch nannte, und das zur Form, zum hohen Bilde, zur Schönheit wurde, dabei jedoch der Inbegriff der Sinnlichkeit und der Begierde war. Denn diese Form und {419}Schönheit war nicht geistgetragen, wie in den Werken der Dichtung und Musik, auch nicht getragen von einem neutralen und geistverzehrten, den Geist auf eine unschuldige Art versinnlichenden Stoff, wie die Form und Schönheit der Bildwerke. Vielmehr war sie getragen und ausgebildet von der auf unbekannte Art zur Wollust erwachten Substanz, der organischen, verwesend-wesenden Materie selbst, dem riechenden Fleische …","So what was life? It was heat, the heat product of form-preserving instability, a fever of matter, which accompanied the process of incessant decomposition and regeneration of protein molecules that were unsustainably complex and artificially constructed. It was the being of what could not actually be, of what could only be balanced on the point of being with sweet-painful-precise distress in this entangled and feverish process of decay and renewal. It wasn't material and it wasn't spirit. It was something between the two, a phenomenon carried by matter, like the rainbow on the waterfall and like the flame. But although not material, it was sensual to the point of lust and disgust, the shamelessness of matter that had become self-sensitive and irritable, the lewd form of being. It was a secret, sensitive stirring in the chaste cold of space, a voluptuous, furtive impurity of nourishment and excretion, an excretory breath of carbonic acid and evil substances of hidden origin and nature. It was the proliferation, unfolding and formation of something bloated out of water, albumen, salt and fats, which was made possible by overbalancing its impermanence and bound in innate laws of formation, which was called flesh, and which became a form, a high image, beauty, but at the same time was the epitome of sensuality and desire. For this form and {419}beauty was not supported by the spirit, as in the works of poetry and music, nor was it supported by a neutral and spirit-eating material that innocently sensualizes the spirit, like the form and beauty of the sculptures. Rather, it was carried and formed by the substance awakened to lust in an unknown way, the organic, decaying matter itself, the fragrant flesh...","What then was life? It was warmth, the warmth generated by a form-preserving instability, a fever of matter, which accompanied the process of ceaseless decay and repair of albumen molecules that were too impossibly complicated, too impossibly ingenious in structure. It was the existence of the actually impossible-to-exist, of a half-sweet, half-painful balancing, or scarcely balancing, in this restricted and feverish process of decay and renewal, upon the point of existence. It was not matter and it was not spirit, but something between the two, a phenomenon conveyed by matter, like the rainbow on the waterfall, and like the flame. Yet why not material—it was sentient to the point of desire and disgust, the shamelessness of matter become sensible of itself, the incontinent form of being. It was a secret and ardent stirring in the frozen chastity of the universal; it was a stolen and voluptuous impurity of sucking and secreting; an exhalation of carbonic acid gas and material impurities of mysterious origin and composition. It was a pullulation, an unfolding, a form-building (made possible by the overbalancing of its instability, yet controlled by the laws of growth inherent within it), of something brewed out of water, albumen, salt and fats, which was called flesh, and which became form, beauty, a lofty image, and yet all the time the essence of sensuality and desire. For this form and beauty were not spiritborne; nor, like the form and beauty of sculpture, conveyed by a neutral and spiritconsumed substance, which could in all purity make beauty perceptible to the senses. Rather was it conveyed and shaped by the somehow awakened voluptuousness of matter, of the organic, dying-living substance itself, the reeking flesh.","What was life, really? It was warmth, the warmth produced by instability attempting to preserve form, a fever of matter that accompanies the ceaseless dissolution and renewal of protein molecules, themselves transient in their complex and intricate construction. It was the existence of what, in actuality, has no inherent ability to exist, but only balances with sweet, painful precariousness on one point of existence in the midst of this feverish, interwoven process of decay and repair. It was not matter, it was not spirit. It was something in between the two, a phenomenon borne by matter, like the rainbow above a waterfall, like a flame. But although it was not material, it was sensual to the point of lust and revulsion, it was matter shamelessly sensitive to stimuli within and without—existence in its lewd form. It was a secret, sensate stirring in the chaste chill of space. It was furtive, lascivious, sordid—nourishment sucked in and excreted, an exhalation of carbon dioxide and other foul impurities of a mysterious origin and nature. Out of overcompensation for its own instability, yet governed by its own inherent laws of formation, a bloated concoction of water, protein, salt, and fats—what we call flesh—ran riot, unfolded, and took shape, achieving form, ideality, beauty, and yet all the while was the quintessence of sensuality and desire. This form and this beauty were not derived from the spirit, as in works of poetry and music, nor derived from some neutral material both consumed by spirit and innocently embodying it, as is the case with the form and beauty of the visual arts. Rather, they were derived from and perfected by substances awakened to lust via means unknown, by decomposing and composing organic matter itself, by reeking flesh."
"»Du sagst ›eigentlich‹. ›Eigentlich‹ kannst du nicht sagen«, entgegnete Hans Castorp. Er saß mit einem Schenkel auf der Brüstung, und das Weiße seiner Augen war rot geädert. »Die Zeit ist doch überhaupt nicht ›eigentlich‹. Wenn sie einem lang vorkommt, so ist sie lang, und wenn sie einem kurz vorkommt, so ist sie kurz, aber wie lang oder kurz sie in Wirklichkeit ist, das weiß doch niemand.« Er war durchaus nicht gewohnt, zu philosophieren und fühlte dennoch den Drang dazu.","“You say 'actually'. 'Actually' you can't say,' replied Hans Castorp. He was sitting with one thigh on the parapet and the whites of his eyes were veined red. 'Time isn't 'actual' at all. If it seems long, then it is long, and if it seems short, then it is short, but no one knows how long or short it really is.” He was not at all used to philosophizing, and yet he felt the urge to.","“You say ‘actually,’ ” Hans Castorp answered. He sat with one leg flung over the balustrade, and his eyes looked bloodshot. “But after all, time isn’t ‘actual.’ When it seems long to you, then it is long; when it seems short, why, then it is short. But how long, or how short, it actually is, that nobody knows.” He was unaccustomed to philosophize, yet somehow felt an impulse to do so.","“You said ‘actually.’ But ‘actually’ doesn’t apply,” Hans Castorp responded. He was sitting with one thigh hiked up on the railing; the whites of his eyes were bloodshot. “There is nothing ‘actual’ about time. If it seems long to you, then it is long, and if it seems to pass quickly, then it’s short. But how long or how short it is in actuality, no one knows.” He was not at all used to philosophizing, and yet felt some urge to do so."
"Doch, er war es so ziemlich. Herr Settembrini war Schöngeist, und die mittelalterliche Geschichte des Rechtsganges war ihm offenbar im Augenblick nicht übersichtlich. Sie war in der Tat ein Prozeß fortschreitender Rationalisierung und zwar so, daß allmählich, auf Grund von Vernunfterwägungen, Gott aus der Rechtspflege ausgeschaltet worden war. Das Gottesgericht war gefallen, weil man hatte bemerken müssen, daß der Stärkere siege, auch wenn er im Unrecht sei. Leute von der Art des Herrn Settembrini, Zweifler, Kritiker, hatten diese Wahrnehmung gemacht und es durchgesetzt, daß an die Stelle des alten naiven Rechtsganges der Inquisitionsprozeß trat, welcher sich auf Gottes Eingreifen zugunsten der Wahrheit nicht länger {692}verließ, sondern darauf abzielte, vom Angeklagten das Geständnis der Wahrheit zu erlangen. Keine Verurteilung ohne Geständnis, – man mochte sich nur auch heute noch im Volke umhören: der Instinkt saß tief, die Beweiskette mochte noch so geschlossen sein, die Verurteilung wurde als illegitim empfunden, wenn das Geständnis fehlte. Wie es erwirken? Wie die Wahrheit über alle bloßen Anzeichen, allen bloßen Verdacht hinaus ermitteln? Wie einem Menschen, der sie verhehlte, verweigerte, ins Herz, ins Hirn blicken? War der Geist böswillig, so blieb nichts übrig, als sich an den Körper zu wenden, dem man beikommen konnte. Die Folter, als Mittel, das unentbehrliche Geständnis herbeizuführen, war vernunftgeboten. Wer aber den Geständnisprozeß verlangt und eingeführt hatte, das war Herr Settembrini gewesen, und also war er auch Urheber der Folter.","Yes, he pretty much was. Herr Settembrini was an esthete, and the medieval history of legal proceedings was obviously not clear to him at the moment. It was in fact a process of progressive rationalization in such a way that gradually, on the basis of rational considerations, God had been eliminated from the administration of justice. The judgment of God fell because it had to be noticed that the stronger wins, even when he is in the wrong. People like Mr. Settembrini, doubters, critics, had made this observation and succeeded in replacing the old naive legal process with the Inquisition process, which no longer relied {692}on God's intervention in favor of the truth, but aimed at it to obtain the confession of truth from the accused. No conviction without a confession - one might ask around among the people even today: the instinct ran deep, no matter how close the chain of evidence was, the conviction was felt to be illegitimate if the confession was missing. How to get it? How to determine the truth beyond mere evidence, beyond mere suspicion? Like looking into the heart, into the brain of a person who concealed them, refused them? When the spirit was malevolent, there was nothing to do but turn to the body, which could be dealt with. Torture, as a means of obtaining the indispensable confession, was reasonable. But it was Herr Settembrini who demanded and instituted the confession process, and therefore he was also the author of the torture.","Oh, yes, he was pretty well in possession of them. It was Herr Settembrini, the professed æsthete, who was probably not altogether familiar with the history of the development of mediæval jurisprudence. There had been, in fact, a process of continuous rationalization, in the course of which reason had taken the place of God, who had been shoved out of the department of justice. In other words, trial by battle had fallen into disuse, because it had been observed that the stronger man conquered even when he was in the wrong. It had been people of Herr Settembrini’s kidney, the doubters and critics, who had made the observation, and brought about the Inquisition, which superseded the old naïve procedure. Justice no longer relied on the intervention of God in favour of the truth, but aimed to get it out of the accused by confession. No sentence without confession—you could hear that still among the people, for the instinct lodged deep with them; the chain of evidence might be as strong as it liked, but if there had been no confession, there would remain a lurking feeling that the sentence was illegitimate. But how get at the confession? How procure the truth, out of the mass of circumstance and suspicion? How look into the heart, the brain, of a man who denied and concealed? If the spirit was recalcitrant, there remained the body, which could be got at. The torture was recommended to reason, as a means to an end, the end of bringing out the indispensable confession. But it was Herr Settembrini who had demanded and introduced confession, and he, accordingly, who was responsible for torture.","Oh, yes he was, very much so. As a belletrist, Herr Settembrini apparently did not have an overview of the history of medieval law at his immediate command. That history had in fact been one of the progressive application of human reason, by which, on the basis of purely rational concerns, God had gradually been removed from the administration of justice. Trial by ordeal had been abandoned, because over time it became apparent that might was victorious even when it was not in the right. People of Herr Settembrini’s sort, the doubters and critics, had observed this fact and seen to it that the old naive form of justice was replaced by the Inquisition, which no longer depended on God’s intervening on behalf of truth, but was aimed at obtaining the truth through the confession of the accused. No sentence without a confession. One had only to listen to commonfolk even nowadays, the instinct ran deep: no matter how strong the links in the chain of proof, a sentence was considered illegitimate if there was no confession. And how did one obtain it? How did one find the truth beyond all suspicion, beyond all circumstantial evidence? How did one look into the heart and mind of a man who dissembled and denied? If the Spirit was willfully malicious, one had no recourse but to turn to the body, which one could get hold of. Reason dictated the use of torture as the means to obtain that indispensable confession. But the person who had demanded and initiated the process that led to confession—that had been Herr Settembrini. It was he who had originated torture."

"Das alles kostete Zeit, und so kam es, daß bis zum Stelldichein zwei Tage und drei Nächte vergingen. Der Treffpunkt war von Hans Castorps Erfindung: Es war der malerische, im Sommer blau blühende Ort seiner Regierungs-Zurückgezogenheit, den er in Vorschlag gebracht hatte. Hier sollte am dritten Morgen nach dem Streit, sobald es nur hell genug war, der Handel seine Erledigung finden. Erst am Vorabend, ziemlich spät, verfiel Hans Castorp, der sehr aufgeregt war, auf den Gedanken, daß es ja nötig sei, einen Arzt mit auf den Kampfplatz zu nehmen.","All this took time, and so it happened that two days and three nights passed before the tryst. The meeting place was Hans Castorp's invention: it was the picturesque, blue-summer spot of his government retreat that he had proposed.

It was not until the evening before, quite late, that Hans Castorp, who was very excited, thought that it was necessary to take a doctor to the battlefield.","All this took time: two days and three nights intervened between the quarrel and the meeting.

The evening before, rather late, it occurred to Hans Castorp, by this time thoroughly wrought up, that there ought to be a physician present.","All this took time, and so two days and three nights passed before the rendezvous. The meeting place was Hans Castorp’s idea; he had suggested they use his picturesque summer retreat, the blue-blossoming meadow where he “played king.” There, on the third morning after the argument, as soon as it was light enough, the issue was to be resolved.

"»Erlauben Sie, daß ich Ihnen das Glas abnehme, Mynheer Peeperkorn«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Ich folge Ihrem Gedankengang zu meiner größten Belehrung.

Alle religiöse Strenge ist natürlich beklemmend für Leute bescheideneren Formates. Ich denke nicht daran, Sie korrigieren zu wollen, sondern ich möchte nur einlenkend auf Ihre Äußerung über gewisse ›Vorurteile‹ zurückkommen, die nach Ihrer Beobachtung Herr Settembrini Madame, Ihrer Reisebegleiterin, entgegenbringt. Ich kenne Herrn Settembrini lange, sehr lange, {914}seit Jahr und Tag, seit Jahren und Tagen.

Es ist eine überaus weitläufige Angelegenheit, die ich unmöglich in zwei Worten –«","""Let me take your glass, Mynheer Peeperkorn,"" said Hans Castorp. “I am following your train of thought to my greatest lesson. You are developing a theological theory with which you ascribe a highly honorable, if perhaps somewhat one-sided, religious function to man. If I may allow myself to say so, there is a certain rigor in your way of looking at things that is oppressive - forgive me! All religious rigor is, of course, oppressive for people of modest stature. I do not intend to correct you, I would just like to come back to your statement about certain 'prejudices' which, according to your observation, Mr Settembrini has towards Madame, your traveling companion. I have known Mr. Settembrini for a long, very long time, {914}for years and days, for years and days.

It can only be about prejudices of a larger scale and therefore of an impersonal nature, about general pedagogical principles, which Mr. Settembrini frankly helped me to assert in my capacity as ""life's problem child"" - But that is going too far. It is an exceedingly vast affair which I cannot possibly sum up in two words—”","“Permit me to relieve you of your glass,” Hans Castorp said. “I find your train of thought highly edifying, Mynheer Peeperkorn. You are developing a theology there, in which you ascribe to man a highly honourable, if perhaps rather a one-sided religious function.

I have known Herr Settembrini for some time, more than a year, for years, in fact. And I can assure you that his prejudices, in so far as they exist, are in no case of a petty or bourgeois character.

You have constructed a theological theory that ascribes to man an eminently honorable, if perhaps somewhat one-sided religious function.

"Von einem Dorf konnte übrigens nicht gut die Rede sein; jedenfalls war nichts davon als der Name übrig. Der Kurort hatte es aufgezehrt, indem er sich immerfort gegen den Taleingang hin ausdehnte, und der Teil der gesamten Siedelung, welcher »Dorf« hieß, ging unmerklich und ohne Unterschied in den als »Davos Platz« bezeichneten über. Hotels und Pensionen, alle mit gedeckten Veranden, Balkons und Liegehallen reichlich versehen, auch kleine Privathäuser, in denen Zimmer {110}zu vermieten waren, lagen zu beiden Seiten; hier und da kamen Neubauten; manchmal setzte auch die Bebauung aus, und die Straße gewährte den Blick in die offenen Wiesengründe des Tals …","Incidentally, one could hardly speak of a village; in any case, nothing was left of it but the name.

"Sie standen also alle steif aufrecht an unserem Tisch: Hans Castorp und die beiden Gegner und ihnen gegenüber Ferge und Wehsal. Alle fünf waren sie blaß, mit erweiterten Augen und zuckenden Mündern. Hätten nicht die drei Unbeteiligten den Versuch machen können, beschwichtigend einzuwirken, mit einem Scherzwort die Spannung zu lösen, durch irgendein menschliches Zureden alles zum Guten zu wenden? Sie unternahmen ihn nicht, diesen Versuch. Die inneren Umstände hinderten sie daran. Sie standen und bebten, und unwillkürlich ballten ihre Hände sich zu Fäusten. Selbst A. K. Ferge, dem alles Höhere erklärtermaßen völlig fern lag und der von vornherein gänzlich darauf verzichtete, die Tragweite des Streites zu ermessen, – auch er war überzeugt, daß es hier auf Biegen und Brechen gehe, und daß man, selbst mit hingerissen, nichts tun könne, als den Dingen ihren Lauf zu lassen.

"Zwei Zwischenfälle ereigneten sich während der großen Mahlzeit und erregten Hans Castorps Aufmerksamkeit, soweit sein Befinden dies zuließ. Erstens fiel wieder die Glastür zu, – es war beim Fisch. Hans Castorp zuckte erbittert und sagte dann in zornigem Eifer zu sich selbst, daß er unbedingt diesmal den Täter feststellen müsse. Er dachte es nicht nur, er sagte es auch mit den Lippen, so ernst war es ihm.

Und dabei wandte er den ganzen Oberkörper nach links und riß seine blutüberfüllten Augen auf.","Two incidents occurred during the great meal and caught Hans Castorp's attention as far as his health would permit. First, the glass door slammed shut again—it was at the fish. Hans Castorp twitched bitterly and then said to himself in a rage that this time he absolutely had to find the culprit. He didn't just think it, he said it with his lips, he was that serious. I have to know it! he whispered with exaggerated passion, so that both Miss Robinson and the teacher looked at him in astonishment. And as he did so, he turned his whole upper body to the left and opened his blood-filled eyes.","There were two incidents during the course of the meal of which Hans Castorp took note, so far as his condition permitted. One was the banging of the glass door, which occurred while they were having the fish course. Hans Castorp gave an exasperated shrug and angrily resolved that this time he really must find out who did it. He said this not only within himself, his lips formed the words. “I must find out,” he whispered with exaggerated earnestness. Miss Robinson and the schoolmistress both looked at him in surprise. He turned the whole upper half of his body to the left and opened wide his bloodshot blue eyes.","During this major meal of the day, two incidents occurred to attract Hans Castorp’s attention, insofar as his condition allowed.

"Hinter verschneiten Felshügeln, zwischen denen er sich, bald rechts, bald links lenkend, hindurchschob, lag eine Schräge, dann eine Ebene, dann großes Gebirge, dessen weich gepolsterte Schluchten und Pässe so zugänglich und lockend schienen. Ja, die Lockung der Fernen und Höhen, der immer neu sich auftuenden Einsamkeiten war stark in Hans Castorps Gemüt, und auf die Gefahr, sich zu verspäten, strebte er tiefer ins wilde Schweigen, ins Nichtgeheure, für nichts Gutstehende hinein, – ungeachtet, daß überdies die Spannung und Beklommenheit seines Inneren zur wirklichen Furcht wurde angesichts der vorzeitig zunehmenden Himmelsdunkelheit, die sich wie graue Schleier auf die Gegend herabsenkte. Diese Furcht machte ihm bewußt, daß er es heimlich bisher geradezu darauf angelegt hatte, sich um die Orientierung zu bringen und zu vergessen, in welcher Richtung Tal und Ortschaft lagen, was ihm denn auch in erwünschter Vollständigkeit gelungen war. Übrigens durfte er sich sagen, daß, wenn er sofort umkehrte und immer bergab fuhr, das Tal, wenn auch möglicherweise fern vom »Berghof«, rasch erreicht sein werde, – zu rasch; er würde zu früh kommen, würde seine Zeit nicht aus{725}genutzt haben, während er allerdings, wenn das Schneeunwetter ihn überraschte, den Heimweg wohl vorderhand überhaupt nicht finden würde. Darum aber vorzeitig flüchtig zu werden, weigerte er sich, – die Furcht, seine aufrichtige Furcht vor den Elementen mochte ihn beklemmen wie sie wollte. Das war kaum sportsmännisch gehandelt; denn der Sportsmann läßt sich mit den Elementen nur ein, solange er sich ihr Herr und Meister weiß, übt Vorsicht und ist der Klügere, der nachgibt. Was aber in Hans Castorps Seele vorging, war nur mit einem Wort zu bezeichnen: Herausforderung. Und soviel Tadel das Wort umschließt, auch wenn – oder besonders wenn – das ihm entsprechende frevelhafte Gefühl mit so viel aufrichtiger Furcht verbunden ist, so ist doch bei einigem menschlichen Nachdenken ungefähr zu begreifen, daß in den Seelengründen eines jungen Menschen und Mannes, der jahrelang gelebt hat wie dieser hier, manches sich ansammelt, oder, wie Hans Castorp, der Ingenieur, gesagt haben würde, »akkumuliert«, was eines Tages als ein elementares »Ach was!« oder ein »Komm denn an!« von erbitterter Ungeduld, kurz eben als Herausforderung und Verweigerung kluger Vorsicht sich entlädt. Und so fuhr er denn zu auf seinen langen Pantoffeln, glitt noch den Abhang hinunter und schob sich über die folgende Halde, auf der in einiger Entfernung ein Holzhäuschen, Heuschober oder Almhütte mit steinbeschwertem Dache, stand, dem nächsten Berge zu, dessen Rücken borstig von Tannen war, und hinter dem Hochgipfel sich nebelhaft türmten. Die mit einzelnen Baumgruppen besetzte Wand vor ihm war schroff, aber schräg rechtshin mochte man sie in mäßiger Steigung halb umgehen und hinter sie kommen, um zu sehen, was da weiter sein werde, und an dieses Forschergeschäft machte sich Hans Castorp, nachdem er vor dem Feld mit der Sennhütte noch in eine ziemlich tiefe, von rechts nach links abfallende Schlucht hinabgefahren war.","Behind snow-covered rocky hills, between which he pushed his way, turning now to the right and now to the left, lay a slope, then a plain, then great mountains whose softly padded gorges and passes seemed so accessible and enticing. Yes, the lure of distance and heights, of solitude that kept opening up anew, was strong in Hans Castorp's mind, and at the risk of being late, he strove deeper into wild silence, into the unsavory, into nothing good - notwithstanding that moreover, the tension and trepidation within him became real fear in the face of the prematurely increasing darkness of the sky, which descended like gray veils over the area. This fear made him aware that until now he had secretly tried to lose his bearings and to forget in which direction the valley and the village lay, which he had succeeded in doing in the desired completeness. Incidentally, he could tell himself that if he turned around immediately and kept driving downhill, the valley would be reached quickly, even if it was possibly far from the ""Berghof""—too quickly; he would come too early, would not have used his time{725}, whereas if the snowstorm surprised him, he would probably not be able to find his way home at all for the time being. But he refused to flee prematurely for that reason - the fear, his sincere fear of the elements oppressed him as much as it might. That was hardly a sportsmanship; because the sportsman only gets involved with the elements as long as he knows he is their lord and master, exercises caution and is the wiser one who gives in. But what was going on in Hans Castorp's soul could only be described in one word: challenge. And no matter how much reproach the word encloses, even if - or especially if - the corresponding wicked feeling is connected with so much sincere fear, it is still possible to understand with a little human reflection that in the soul depths of a young person and man who for years has lived like this one, some things accumulate or, as Hans Castorp, the engineer, would have said, ""accumulates"", what one day as an elementary ""Oh what!"" or a ""Come on!"" of exasperated impatience, in short, it discharges itself as a challenge and refusal of prudent caution. And so he went on his long slippers, slid down the slope and pushed himself over the following heap, on which at some distance stood a wooden house, haystack or alpine hut with a stone-weighted roof, towards the next mountain, whose back was bristly from Fir trees were, and behind the high peak towered up misty. The wall in front of him, covered with individual clumps of trees, was rugged, but diagonally to the right one could go halfway around it at a moderate incline and come behind it to see what would be further there, and Hans Castorp set about this research business after he had Feld with the alpine hut had descended into a fairly deep gorge that sloped down from right to left.","He pressed on, turning right and left among rocky, snow-clad elevations, and came behind them on an incline, then a level spot, then on the mountains themselves—how alluring and accessible seemed their softly covered gorges and defiles! His blood leaped at the strong allurement of the distance and the height, the ever profounder solitude. At risk of a late return he pressed on, deeper into the wild silence, the monstrous and the menacing, despite that gathering darkness was sinking down over the region like a veil, and heightening his inner apprehension until it presently passed into actual fear. It was this fear which first made him conscious that he had deliberately set out to lose his way and the direction in which valley and settlement lay—and had been as successful as heart could wish. Yet he knew that if he were to turn in his tracks and go downhill, he would reach the valley bottom—even if some distance from the Berghof—and that sooner than he had planned. He would come home too early, not have made full use of his time. On the other hand, if he were overtaken unawares by the storm, he would probably in any case not find his way home. But however genuine his fear of the elements, he refused to take premature flight; his being scarcely the sportman’s attitude, who only meddles with the elements so long as he knows himself their master, takes all precautions, and prudently yields when he must—whereas what went on in Hans Castorp’s soul can only be described by the one word challenge. It was perhaps a blameworthy, presumptuous attitude, even united to such genuine awe. Yet this much is clear, to any human understanding: that when a young man has lived years long in the way this one had, something may gather—may accumulate, as our engineer might put it—in the depths of his soul, until one day it suddenly discharges itself, with a primitive exclamation of disgust, a mental “Oh, go to the devil!” a repudiation of all caution whatsoever, in short with a challenge. So on he went, in his seven-league slippers, glided down this slope too and pressed up the incline beyond, where stood a wooden hut that might be a hayrick or shepherd’s shelter, its roof weighted with flat stones. On past this to the nearest mountain ridge, bristling with forest, behind whose back the giant peaks towered upward in the mist. The wall before him, studded with single groups of trees, was steep, but looked as though one might wind to the right and get round it by climbing a little way up the slope. Once on the other side, he could see what lay beyond. Accordingly Hans Castorp set out on this tour of investigation, which began by descending from the meadow with the hut into another and rather deep gully that dropped off from right to left.","Turning now to the right, now to the left, he pushed his way along between snow-clad hillocks, behind which lay another slope, then an open plain, then a great mountain, whose softly cushioned ravines and passes seemed inviting and accessible. Yes, the lure of distance and height, of one solitude opening onto the next, had a very strong effect on Hans Castorp, and though it meant risking getting back late, he pressed ahead ever deeper into the wild silence, into this uncanny world that boded no good—ignoring a tense uneasiness that was growing into real fear as the sky continued to darken much too early, falling like a gray veil over the whole region. Fear made him realize he had secretly, and more or less purposely, been trying to lose his bearings all this time, to forget in what direction the valley and town lay—and that he had been totally successful at it. And yet he could tell himself that if he turned around now and held a course downhill, he would quickly reach the valley, though possibly at some distance from the Berghof—all too quickly; he would be back too early, would not have used his time to the full. Although if he waited until the snowstorm overtook him, he might very well not be able to find his way home all that soon. But he refused to flee ahead of time because of that—let fear, genuine fear of the elements, oppress him as much as it liked. His actions were hardly those of a sportsman, because a sportsman is a man of caution, who gets involved with the elements only as long as he knows he is their lord and master and prudently yields when he must. But there is only one word for what was happening in Hans Castorp’s soul: defiance. And although the word certainly can be used pejoratively, even when—or particularly when—a sense of wicked adventure is bound up with genuine fear, if we give it a little thought this much at least becomes clear: that a great many things gather (or, as Hans Castorp the engineer would have said, “accumulate”) in the soul of a young person, of a young man who has lived for years as this young man had; and then comes a day when something elemental erupts in a fierce, impatient cry of “Oh, so what!” or “I’ll chance it!”—when, in short, prudence is defied, even repudiated. And so he plunged ahead in his long, wooden slippers, gliding down the slope and pushing his way up the next hill, atop which, a little farther off, stood a wooden hut—a hayshed or little barn, with its roof weighted down with stones. It faced the next mountain, whose ridges bristled with firs and above which more foggy peaks towered. The rock wall directly behind the hut was steep and dotted with scattered groups of trees, but it could be circumvented by following what looked like a moderate climb on the right, from where you would then be able to see what lay beyond; and Hans Castorp set out to research the matter, leaving the open field with the hut behind him and skiing down into a rather deep ravine that dropped off from right to left."

"»Herr Albin, ich flehe Sie an, legen Sie das Messer fort, stecken Sie es ein, es geschieht ein Unglück damit!« klagte eine hohe, schwankende Damenstimme. Und:","""Mr. Albin, I beg you, put the knife away, put it in your pocket, something bad will happen with it!"" complained a high, shaky woman's voice. And:","“Herr Albin, I implore you, put away your knife; put it in your pocket, there will be an accident with it,” a high, uncertain voice besought. Then: “Dear Herr Albin, for heaven’s sake, spare our nerves, and take that murderous tool out of our sight,” a second voice chimed in.","“I beg you, Herr Albin, do put that knife away, put it in your pocket before there’s an accident!” a high, wavering female voice fretted."
"Nun war denn also der Plan eines Ausflugs zum Wasserfall an der Tagesordnung, – Peeperkorn selbst hatte das Ziel bestimmt, und er fühlte sich rüstig zu dem Unternehmen. Es war der dritte Tag nach einem Quartananfall; Mynheer ließ wissen, daß er ihn zu nutzen wünsche. Zwar war er zu den ersten Mahlzeiten des Tages nicht im Speisesaal erschienen, sondern hatte sie, wie in letzter Zeit sehr häufig, zusammen mit Madame Chauchat in seinem Salon eingenommen; aber schon beim ersten Frühstück hatte Hans Castorp durch den hinkenden Concierge Order empfangen, sich eine Stunde nach dem Mittagessen zu einer Spazierfahrt bereitzuhalten, ferner, diesen Befehl an die Herren Ferge und Wehsal weiterzugeben, auch Settembrini und Naphta zu benachrichtigen, daß man bei ihnen vorfahren werde, und endlich für die Bestellung zweier Landauer auf drei Uhr Sorge zu tragen.","So now the plan of a trip to the falls was on the order of the day--Peeperkorn himself had chosen the destination, and he felt fit for the enterprise. It was the third day after a quartan bout; Mynheer indicated that he wished to use it. It is true that he had not appeared in the dining-room for the first meals of the day, but had eaten them in his drawing-room with Madame Chauchat, as he had done very often lately; but already at the first breakfast Hans Castorp had received orders from the limping concierge to be ready for a drive an hour after lunch, and also to pass this order on to Messrs. Ferge and Wehsal, and also to notify Settembrini and Naphta that we were to drive up to them and finally to take care of ordering two landau at three o'clock.","But now the excursion to the waterfall was the order of the day; Peeperkorn himself had arranged it, and felt equal to the effort. It was the third day after the usual attack, and he announced that he wished to take advantage of it. He did not, indeed, appear at the early meals of the day, but took them, in company with Madame Chauchat, in their salon, as they often did of late. But Hans Castorp received word, through the lame concierge, to be ready for a drive an hour after the midday meal, and further, to communicate with Ferge and Wehsal, Settembrini and Naphta, and to engage two landaus for three o’clock.","But the plan for an excursion to the waterfall was now on the agenda—Peeperkorn himself had selected the goal, and he felt up to the effort. It was the third day after a quartan attack; Mynheer let it be known he wished to take advantage of the fact. He had not appeared in the dining hall for the first meals of the day, but had taken them, as he often did of late, with Madame Chauchat in his parlor. Nevertheless, as Hans Castorp made his way to first breakfast, he was greeted by the limping concierge and told to be ready for a drive one hour after dinner; he was also to pass the order on to Herr Ferge and Herr Wehsal, likewise to notify Settembrini and Naphta that they would be picked up, and, finally, was given the task of ordering two landaus for three o’clock that afternoon."

All three of his listeners had flinched, even Settembrini, who quickly recovered, however, and smiled."
"Trotzdem war Hans Castorps Lob berechtigt. Die matt schimmernde Weiße dieser zarten, aber nicht mageren Büste, die sich in der bläulichen Schleierdraperie verlor, hatte viel {392}Natur; sichtlich war sie mit Gefühl gemalt, aber unbeschadet einer gewissen Süßigkeit, die davon ausging, hatte der Künstler ihr eine Art von wissenschaftlicher Realität und lebendiger Genauigkeit zu verleihen gewußt. Er hatte sich des körnigen Charakters der Leinwand bedient, um ihn, namentlich in der Gegend der zart hervortretenden Schlüsselbeine, durch die Ölfarbe hindurch als natürliche Unebenheit der Hautoberfläche wirken zu lassen. Ein Leberfleckchen links, wo die Brust sich zu teilen begann, war nicht außer acht gelassen, und zwischen den Erhebungen glaubte man schwach-bläuliches Geäder durchscheinen zu sehen. Es war, als ginge unter dem Blick des Betrachters ein kaum merklicher Schauer von Sensitivität über diese Nacktheit, – gewagt zu sagen: man mochte sich einbilden, die Perspiration, den unsichtbaren Lebensdunst dieses Fleisches wahrzunehmen, so, als würde man, wenn man etwa die Lippen darauf drückte, nicht den Geruch von Farbe und Firnis, sondern den des menschlichen Körpers verspüren. Wir geben mit alldem die Eindrücke Hans Castorps wieder: aber wenn er besonders bereit war, solche Eindrücke zu empfangen, so ist doch sachlich festzustellen, daß Frau Chauchats Dekolleté das bei weitem bemerkenswerteste Stück Malerei in diesen Zimmern war.","Nevertheless, Hans Castorp's praise was justified. The matt shimmering whiteness of this delicate but not thin bust, lost in the bluish drapery, had a lot of nature; it was evidently painted with feeling, but notwithstanding a certain sweetness that emanated from it, the artist had been able to give it a sort of scientific reality and vivid precision. He had used the grainy character of the canvas to let it appear through the oil paint as a natural unevenness of the skin's surface, particularly in the region of the delicately protruding collarbones. A mole on the left, where the breast began to divide, was not neglected, and between the elevations one thought one could see faint bluish veins showing through. It was as if, under the gaze of the beholder, a scarcely perceptible tremor of sensitivity passed over this nudity - dare I say it: one might fancy perceiving the perspiration, the invisible vapor of life of this flesh, as if one were, if one were about the Lips pressed to it, not the smell of paint and varnish, but that of the human body. With all this we reproduce the impressions of Hans Castorp: but if he was particularly ready to receive such impressions, it is factual to state that Mrs. Chauchat's décolleté was by far the most remarkable piece of painting in these rooms.","And still Hans Castorp’s praise was deserved. The pale shimmer of this tender, though not emaciated, bosom, losing itself in the bluish shadows of the drapery, was very like life. It was obviously painted with feeling; a sort of sweetness emanated from it, yet the artist had been successful in giving it a scientific realism and precision as well. The roughness of the canvas texture, showing through the paint, had been dexterously employed to suggest the natural unevennesses of the skin—this especially in the neighbourhood of the delicate collar-bones. A tiny mole, at the point where the breasts began to divide, had been done with care, and on their rounding surfaces one thought to trace the delicate blue veins. It was as though a scarcely perceptible shiver of sensibility beneath the eye of the beholder were passing over this nude flesh, as though one might see the perspiration, the invisible vapour which the life beneath threw off; as though, were one to press one’s lips upon this surface, one might perceive, not the smell of paint and fixative, but the odour of the human body. Such, at least, were Hans Castorp’s impressions, which we here reproduce—and he, of course, was in a peculiarly susceptible state. But it is none the less true that Frau Chauchat’s portrait was by far the most telling piece of painting in the room.","All the same, Hans Castorp’s praise was justified. Where her tender, though hardly meager bosom lost itself under the bluish drape, its subdued shimmer of white seemed taken from nature. The bare skin had obviously been painted with feeling, and despite a certain aura of sweetness, the artist had been able to endow it with scientific reality and lifelike accuracy. He had used the grainy surface of the canvas under the oils to suggest its uneven texture, particularly where the collarbone delicately protruded. He had not failed to include a mole just where the breasts began, and between their soft swellings there was a hint of pale bluish veins. Under the beholder’s gaze, a barely perceptible shiver of sensitivity seemed to pass over this naked flesh—or to put it more boldly, you could imagine that you saw perspiration, the invisible vapors of life, rising from the flesh, that if you were to press your lips against the surface, you would smell a human body, not paint and varnish. We are simply describing Hans Castorp’s impressions—but although he was especially receptive to such impressions, it should be noted that in fact Frau Chauchat’s bared skin was by far the most remarkable piece of painting in the apartment."
"»Es lohnt, es lohnt. – Ingenieur!« sagte Herr Settembrini leise, indem er näher an den jungen Mann herantrat. »Wissen Sie nicht, daß es grauenhaft ist, wie Sie mit den Monaten herumwerfen? Grauenhaft, weil unnatürlich und Ihrem Wesen fremd, nur auf der Gelehrigkeit Ihrer Jahre beruhend. Ach, diese übergroße Gelehrigkeit der Jugend! – sie ist die Verzweiflung der Erzieher, denn vor allem ist sie bereit, sich im Schlimmen zu bewähren. Reden Sie nicht, wie es in der Luft liegt, junger Mensch, sondern wie es Ihrer europäischen Lebensform angemessen ist! Hier liegt vor allem viel Asien in der Luft, – nicht umsonst wimmelt es von Typen aus der moskowitischen Mongolei! Diese Leute« – und Herr Settembrini deutete mit dem Kinn über die Schulter hinter sich – »richten Sie sich innerlich nicht nach ihnen, lassen Sie sich von ihren Begriffen nicht infizieren, setzen Sie vielmehr Ihr Wesen, Ihr höheres Wesen gegen das ihre, und halten Sie heilig, was Ihnen, dem Sohn des Westens, des göttlichen Westens, – dem Sohn der Zivilisation, nach Natur und Herkunft heilig ist, zum Beispiel {369}die Zeit! Diese Freigebigkeit, diese barbarische Großartigkeit im Zeitverbrauch ist asiatischer Stil, – das mag ein Grund sein, weshalb es den Kindern des Ostens an diesem Orte behagt. Haben Sie nie bemerkt, daß, wenn ein Russe ›vier Stunden‹ sagt, es nicht mehr ist, als wenn unsereins ›eine‹ sagt? Leicht zu denken, daß die Nonchalance dieser Menschen im Verhältnis zur Zeit mit der wilden Weiträumigkeit ihres Landes zusammenhängt. Wo viel Raum ist, da ist viel Zeit, – man sagt ja, daß sie das Volk sind, das Zeit hat und warten kann. Wir Europäer, wir können es nicht. Wir haben so wenig Zeit, wie unser edler und zierlich gegliederter Erdteil Raum hat, wir sind auf genaue Bewirtschaftung des einen wie des anderen angewiesen, auf Nutzung, Nutzung, Ingenieur! Nehmen Sie unsere großen Städte als Sinnbild, diese Zentren und Brennpunkte der Zivilisation, diese Mischkessel des Gedankens! In demselben Maße, wie der Boden sich dort verteuert, Raumverschwendung zur Unmöglichkeit wird, in demselben Maße, bemerken Sie das, wird dort auch die Zeit immer kostbarer. Carpe diem! Das sang ein Großstädter. Die Zeit ist eine Göttergabe, dem Menschen verliehen, damit er sie nutze – sie nutze, Ingenieur, im Dienste des Menschheitsfortschritts.«","'It's worth it, it's worth it. ""Engineer!"" said Mr. Settembrini softly, stepping closer to the young man. 'Don't you know it's horrible the way you throw the months around? Horrible because unnatural and alien to your nature, based only on the docility of your years. Ah, this exceedingly great docility of youth! - it is the desperation of the educators, because above all it is ready to prove itself in the bad. Don't talk like it's in the air, young man, but like it's appropriate for your European way of life! There's a lot of Asia in the air here - it's not for nothing that it's teeming with guys from Muscovite Mongolia! These people' - and Mr. Settembrini nodded his chin over his shoulder behind him - 'don't conform to them, don't let their concepts infect you, rather set your being, your higher being, against theirs and stop Sacred what is sacred to you, the son of the West, the divine West, - the son of civilisation, by nature and origin, for example {369}time! This bounty, this barbaric grandiosity in the use of time, is Asian style—that may be one reason why the children of the East like it in this place. Haven't you noticed that when a Russian says 'four hours' it's no more than when we say 'one'? It is easy to think that the nonchalance of these people in relation to the time is related to the wild spaciousness of their country. Where there is a lot of space, there is a lot of time - they say that they are the people who have time and can wait. We Europeans, we cannot. We have as little time as our noble and delicately structured continent has space, we are dependent on careful management of one and the other, on use, use, engineer! Take our great cities as a symbol, these centers and focal points of civilization, these mixing cauldrons of thought! To the same extent that the land there becomes more expensive, wasting space becomes an impossibility, to the same extent, notice that, that time also becomes more and more precious there. Carpe Diem! That's what a city dweller sang. Time is a gift from the gods, bestowed upon man to use it—use it, engineer, in the service of human progress.”","One never needs the thing again, of course—but even for the five or six months it is worth while. ‘ “It is, it is.—Engineer,” said Herr Settembrini in a low voice, coming close to the young man as he addressed him, “don’t you know there is something frightful in the way you fling the months about? Frightful because unnatural, inconsistent with your character; it is due solely to the facility of your time of life. Ah, the fatal facility of youth! It is the despair of the teacher, for its proneness to display itself in the wrong direction. I beg you, my young friend, not to adopt the phrases current up here, but to speak the language of the European culture native to you. Up here there is too much Asia. It is not without significance that the place is full of Muscovite and Mongolian types. These people—” Herr Settembrini motioned with his chin over his shoulder— “do not put yourself in tune with them, do not be infected with their ideas; rather set yourself against them, oppose your nature, your higher nature against them; cling to everything which to you is by nature and tradition holy, as a son of the godlike West, a son of civilization: and, for example, time. This barbaric lavishness with time is in the Asiatic style; it may be a reason why the children of the East feel so much at home up here. Have you never remarked that when a Russian says four hours, he means what we do when we say one? It is easy to see that the recklessness of these people where time is concerned may have to do with the space conceptions proper to people of such endless territory. Great space, much time—they say, in fact, that they are the nation that has time and can wait. We Europeans, we cannot. We have as little time as our great and finely articulated continent has space, we must be as economical of the one as of the other, we must husband them, Engineer! Take our great cities, the centres and foci of civilization, the crucibles of thought! Just as the soil there increases in value, and space becomes more and more precious, so, in the same measure, does time. Carpe diem! That was the song of a dweller in a great city. Time is a gift of God, given to man that he might use it—use it, Engineer, to serve the advancement of humanity.”","“Yes, it is worth it, it is worth it, my good engineer,” Herr Settembrini said softly, stepping closer to the young man. “It is truly hideous, you know, the way you are throwing the months around. Hideous, I say, because it is so unnatural, so foreign to your nature, purely a matter of a receptive young mind. Ah, the immoderate receptivity of youth—it can drive an educator to despair, because it is always ready to apply itself to bad ends. Do not ape the words you hear floating in the air around you, young man, but speak a language appropriate to your civilized European life. A great deal of Asia hangs in the air here. It is not for nothing that the place teems with Mongolian Muscovites—people like these.” And Herr Settembrini pointed back over his shoulder with his chin. “Do not model yourself on them, do not let them infect you with their ideas, but instead compare you own nature, your higher nature to theirs, and as a son of the West, of the divine West, hold sacred those things that by both nature and heritage are sacred to you. Time, for instance. This liberality, this barbaric extravagance in the use of time is the Asian style—that may be the reason why the children of the East feel so at home here. Have you never noticed that when a Russian says ‘four hours’ it means no more to him than ‘one hour’ does to us? The idea comes easily to mind that the nonchalance with which these people treat time has something to do with the savage expanse of their land. Too much room—too much time. It has been said that they are a nation with time on their hands—they can afford to wait. We Europeans can’t wait. We have just as little time as our noble, tidily segmented continent has space; we must carefully husband the resources of the former just as we do those of the latter—put them to use, good use, engineer! Our great cities are the perfect symbol—these centers and focal points of civilization, these crucibles of thought. Just as land values rise in cities and wasted space becomes an impossibility, in the same measure, please note, time becomes more precious there, too. Carpe diem! An urbanite sang that song. Time is a gift of the gods to humankind, that we may use it—use it, my good engineer, in the service of human progress.”"
"»Ich habe das Skelett meiner Hand gesehen«, sagte Hans Castorp, indem er sich die Empfindungen zurückzurufen suchte, die bei diesem Anblick in ihm aufgestiegen waren. »Haben Sie sich Ihres auch einmal zeigen lassen?«","""I saw the skeleton of my hand,"" said Hans Castorp, trying to recall the feelings that had awoken in him at the sight. “Have you had yours shown to you?”","“I saw the skeleton of my hand,” Hans Castorp said, and sought to call up the feeling that had mounted in him at the sight. “Did you get them to show you yours?”","“I saw the skeleton of my own hand,” Hans Castorp said, trying to recall the emotions that had stirred in him at the sight of it. “Have you ever had him show you yours?”"

"{753}Es war Ende Juli, als Hans Castorp in seiner Balkonloge diese Depesche durchflog, dann las und wieder las. Er nickte leise dazu, nicht nur mit dem Kopf, sondern mit dem ganzen Oberkörper, und sagte zwischen den Zähnen: »Szo, szo, szo! Szieh, szieh, szieh! – Joachim kommt wieder!« durchfuhr ihn plötzlich die Freude. Aber er wurde gleich wieder still und dachte: »Hm, hm, schwerwiegende Neuigkeiten. Man könnte sie auch als schöne Bescherung bezeichnen. Verdammt, das ist schnell gegangen – schon reif für die Heimat! Die Mutter fährt mit –« (er sagte »die Mutter«, nicht »Tante Luise«; sein Gefühl für Verwandtschaft, Familienbeziehungen hatte sich unvermerkt bis zur Fremdheit abgeschwächt) – »das ist gravierend. Und gerade vor den Manövern, auf die der Gute so brannte! Hm, hm, es liegt eine hübsche Portion Gemeinheit darin, höhnische Gemeinheit, es ist ein gegen-idealistisches Faktum. Der Körper triumphiert, er will es anders als die Seele, und setzt sich durch, zur Blamage der Hochfliegenden, die lehren, er sei der Seele untertan. Es scheint, sie wissen nicht, was sie sagen, denn wenn sie recht hätten, so würfe das ein zweifelhaftes Licht auf die Seele, in einem Fall wie diesem. Sapienti sat, ich weiß, wie ichs meine. Denn die Frage, die ich aufstelle, ist eben, wie weit es verfehlt ist, sie gegeneinander zu stellen, wie weit sie vielmehr unter einer Decke stecken und eine abgekartete Partie spielen, – das fällt den Hochfliegenden zu ihrem Glück nicht ein. Guter Joachim, wer wollte dir und deinem Biereifer zu nahe treten! Du meinst es ehrlich – aber was ist Ehrlichkeit, frage ich, wenn Körper und Seele nun mal unter einer Decke stecken? Sollte es möglich sein, daß du gewisse erfrischende Düfte, eine hohe Brust und ein grundloses Gelächter nicht hast vergessen können, die am Tische der Stöhr deiner warten? … Joachim kommt wieder!« dachte er neuerdings und zog sich zusammen vor Freude. »Er kommt in schlechtem Zustande, offenbar, aber wir werden wieder zu zweien sein, ich werde nicht mehr so {754}ganz auf eigene Hand hier oben leben. Das ist gut. Es wird nicht alles genau wie früher sein; sein Zimmer ist ja besetzt: Mistreß Macdonald, da hustet sie auf ihre klanglose Art und hat natürlich wieder die Photographie ihres kleinen Sohnes neben sich auf dem Tischchen oder auch in der Hand. Aber das ist finales Stadium, und wenn das Zimmer noch nicht wieder vorgemerkt ist, so … Vorläufig wird ja ein anderes zu haben sein. 28 ist frei, meines Wissens. Ich will gleich auf die Verwaltung und namentlich zu Behrens. Ist das eine Neuigkeit, – traurig von der einen und famos von der anderen Seite, aber jedenfalls eine mächtige Neuigkeit! Ich möchte nur auf den gdießenden Kameraden warten, der gleich kommen muß, da es, wie ich sehe, halb vier ist. Ich möchte ihn fragen, ob er auch in diesem Falle der Meinung bleibt, daß man das Körperliche als sekundär zu betrachten hat …«","{753}It was the end of July when Hans Castorp flew through this dispatch in his balcony box, then read it and read it again. He nodded softly, not just with his head but with his whole upper body, and said between his teeth: ""Szo, szo, szo! Pull, pull, pull! ""Joachim will be back!"" Joy suddenly shot through him. But he fell silent again and thought, 'Hmm, hm, serious news. You could also call it a nice gift. Damn, that went quickly - already ready for home! The mother is going with him -' (he said 'the mother', not 'Aunt Luise'; his sense of kinship, family ties had unnoticed weakened to the point of strangeness) - 'that's serious. And just before the maneuvers that the good guy was so excited about! Hmm, hm, there's a fair amount of meanness in it, sneering meanness, it's a counter-idealistic fact. The body triumphs, it wants it differently from the soul, and prevails, to the embarrassment of the high-flyers who teach that it is subject to the soul. They don't seem to know what they're saying, because if they were right it cast a dubious light on the soul in a case like this. Sapienti sat, I know what I mean. Because the question I am asking is how far off the mark it is to put them against each other, how far they are in cahoots and playing a game that has been set up - luckily the high-flyers don't think of that. Good Joachim, who would want to offend you and your enthusiasm for beer! You mean it honestly - but what is honesty, I ask, when body and soul are in league? Could it be possible that you have not been able to forget certain refreshing scents, a high chest and a causeless laughter that await you at the table of the sturgeon? . . . Joachim is coming back!' he thought again and contracted with joy. 'He's coming in bad shape, apparently, but we'll be two again, I won't live quite on my own up here any more. It's good. Everything won't be exactly the same as it used to be; his room is occupied: Mistress Macdonald, she coughs in her soundless way and of course has the photograph of her little son next to her on the little table or in her hand. But that's the final stage, and if the room hasn't been reserved again, then... For the time being, another one will be available. 28 is free to my knowledge. I want to go straight to the administration and specifically to Behrens. Is that news - sad on the one hand and splendid on the other, but powerful news in any case! I just want to wait for the pouring comrade, who must come in a moment, as I see it is half past three. I'd like to ask him if he still thinks that the physical should be considered secondary in this case...""","It was at the end of July when Hans Castorp, lying in his balcony, ran through this dispatch, then read it, and read it again. He nodded as he did so, not with his head but with his whole torso, and said between his teeth: “Si, si, si,” like Herr Settembrini. “Joachim is coming back!” ran through him like tidings of great joy. But he grew subdued at once, on the thought “H’m, this is bad news! One might almost call it a mess. The deuce! That went fast. Ripe for ‘home’ again. The mother coming with him”—Hans Castorp said the mother, not Aunt Louisa, his family feeling having grown unconsciously very faded. “That is serious. And directly before the manœuvres he has been so on fire to go to. H’m, it’s certainly a skin game , it’s playing it low down on poor Joachim , it’s the very opposite of the ideal. By which I mean that the body triumphs, it wants something different from the soul, and puts it through—a slap in the face of all those lofty-minded people who teach that the body is subordinate to the soul. Seems to me they don’t know what they are talking about, because if they were right, a case like this would put the soul in a pretty equivocal light. Verbum sap. — I know what I mean. The question I raise is how far they are right when they set the two over against each other; and whether they aren’t rather in collusion, playing the same game. That’s something that never occurs to the lofty-minded gentry. Not that I am for a moment saying anything against Joachim and his ‘doggedness.’ He is the soul of honour—but what is honour, is what I want to know, when body and soul act together? Is it possible you have not been able to forget a certain refreshing perfume, a tendency to giggle, a swelling bosom, all waiting for you at Frau Stöhr’s table?—He is coming back!” he returned to the thought with the same joyous sensation. “He comes in bad shape, it is true, but we shall be together again, I shan’t live up here all by myself. And that’s a good thing. It won’t be quite as it was before, his room is taken. That Mrs. Macdonald sits there and coughs, a voiceless sort of cough, and keeps looking at the picture of her little son, on her table or in her hand. But she is at the last stage. If nobody else has engaged it, why—but for the present it must be another one. Twenty-eight is free, so far as I know. I’ll go down to the office—and to Behrens too. This is news. On the one hand it is bad news, on the other grand news—and in any case a change. I’d like to wait for the ‘Comrade’ though, he’ll be coming along presently, and just ask him if he is still of the opinion, in a case like this, that the physical is to be regarded as secondary.”","It was the end of July when Hans Castorp stepped out on his balcony and hastily skimmed this dispatch, then read and reread it. And as he did, he nodded lightly, not just with his head, but with his whole upper body, and said between clenched teeth: “Yes, yes, yes. I see, I see, I see.” Suddenly he was overcome with joy: “Joachim is coming back!” But then he fell silent again and thought: “Hmm, hmm, serious news. You could even call it a nice mess. Damn, it all went quickly—already ripe for home! His mother’s coming along”—he called her “his mother,” not “Aunt Luise,” any sense of kinship, of family relationships, having dwindled imperceptibly until such people were almost strangers—“that does give one pause. And just before those maneuvers that the good man was so hot for. Hmm, hmm, isn’t that a pretty twist, a nasty twist, a hard fact to contradict all ideals. The body triumphs, has other plans than the soul, and gets its way—quite a comedown for high-minded types who teach that the body must obey the soul. It seems they don’t know what they’re talking about, because if they were right, a case like this would cast a dubious light on the soul. Sapienti sat, I know what I’m saying. For the question I am raising here is whether it is not wide of the mark to see them as opposites, and whether they aren’t in cahoots instead, haven’t rigged the game—which never occurs to the high-minded types, luckily for them. Not that I would want for the world to insult you, my good Joachim, or your zealot’s love of duty. What you do, you do in all honesty—but I ask you, what is honesty, if the body and soul are in cahoots? Could it be you have not forgotten certain refreshing fragrances, prominent breasts, and pointless giggles that await you at Frau Stöhr’s table? Joachim is coming back!” he thought yet again and experienced a shiver of joy. “He’ll be arriving in bad shape, apparently, but we two shall be together again. I won’t have to live quite so much to myself now. That’s good. Although everything can’t be just like before. His room is occupied, after all— Mrs. Macdonald coughs away in that hollow cough of hers and keeps her little son’s photograph next to her on the table, or clutches it in her hand. But she’s in the last stages, and if the room hasn’t been reserved for anyone else, why then . . . but for now, it will have to be another one. Twenty-eight is vacant, as far as I know. I’ll go see management right away, and Behrens, too, for sure. This is news—sad in one sense, but spiffing in another. Big news, in any case. I’ll just wait for my ‘d’gods’ comrade, he’ll be here any moment, since it’s already half past three , I notice. I want to ask him if in light of this case he’s still of the opinion that the body is secondary.”"

"Bei alldem blieben die Leistungen des Protoplasmas ganz unerklärlich, dem Leben schien es verwehrt, sich selbst zu begreifen. Die Mehrzahl der biochemischen Vorgänge war nicht nur unbekannt, sondern es lag in ihrer Natur, sich der Einsicht zu entziehen. Man wußte von dem Aufbau, der Zusammensetzung der Lebenseinheit, die man die »Zelle« nannte, fast nichts. Was half es, die Bestandteile des toten Muskels aufzuweisen? Der lebende ließ sich chemisch nicht untersuchen; schon jene Veränderungen, die die Totenstarre hervorrief, genügten, um alles Experimentieren nichtssagend zu machen. Niemand verstand den Stoffwechsel, niemand das Wesen der Nervenfunktion. Welchen Eigenschaften verdankten die schmeckenden Körper ihren Geschmack? Worin bestand die verschiedenartige Erregung gewisser Sinnesnerven durch die Riechstoffe? Worin die Riechbarkeit überhaupt? Der spezifische Geruch der Tiere und Menschen beruhte auf der Verdunstung von Substanzen, die niemand zu nennen gewußt hätte. Die Zusammensetzung des Sekrets, das man Schweiß nannte, war wenig geklärt. Die Drüsen, die es absonderten, erzeugten Aromata, die unter Säugetieren zweifellos eine wichtige Rolle spielten, und über deren Bedeutung beim Menschen man nicht unterrichtet zu sein erklärte. Die physiologische Bedeutung offenbar wichtiger Teile des Körpers war in Dunkel gehüllt. Man konnte den Blinddarm beiseite lassen, der ein Mysterium war, und den man beim Kaninchen regelmäßig mit einem breiigen Inhalt angefüllt fand, von dem nicht zu sagen war, wie er wieder hinausgelangen oder sich erneuern mochte. Aber was hatte es auf sich mit der weißen und grauen Substanz des Kopfmarks, was mit dem Sehhügel, der mit dem Optikus kommunizierte, und mit den grauen Einlagerungen der »Brükke«? Die Hirn- und Rückenmarksubstanz war dermaßen zer{427}setzlich, daß keine Hoffnung bestand, je ihren Aufbau zu ergründen. Was enthob beim Einschlafen die Großhirnrinde ihrer Tätigkeit? Was hinderte die Selbstverdauung des Magens, die sich bei Leichen in der Tat zuweilen ereignete? Man antwortete: das Leben; eine besondere Widerstandskraft des lebenden Protoplasmas, – und tat, als bemerke man nicht, daß das eine mystische Erklärung war. Die Theorie einer so alltäglichen Erscheinung wie des Fiebers war widerspruchsvoll. Der gesteigerte Stoffumsatz hatte erhöhte Wärmeproduktion zur Folge. Aber warum steigerte sich nicht, wie sonst, kompensatorisch die Wärmeausgabe? Beruhte die Lähmung der Schweißsekretion auf Kontraktionszuständen der Haut? Aber nur bei Fieberfrost waren solche nachweisbar, denn sonst war die Haut vielmehr heiß. Der »Wärmestich« kennzeichnete das Zentralnervensystem als Sitz der Ursachen für den erhöhten Umsatz wie für eine Hautbeschaffenheit, die man abnorm zu nennen sich begnügte, da man sie nicht zu bestimmen wußte.","Despite all this, the achievements of the protoplasm remained quite inexplicable, life seemed denied the ability to understand itself. Most of the biochemical processes were not only unknown, but by their very nature eluded insight. Almost nothing was known about the structure, the composition of the life unit called the ""cell."" What did it help to show the components of the dead muscle? The living one could not be examined chemically; even those changes brought about by rigor mortis were enough to make all experimentation meaningless. Nobody understood metabolism, nobody understood the nature of nerve function. To what properties did the tasting bodies owe their taste? What was the varied excitement of certain sensory nerves by the odorous substances? In what the sniffability at all? The specific smell of animals and people was based on the evaporation of substances that no one could have named. The composition of the secretion, which was called sweat, was not well understood. The glands which secreted it produced aromata, which undoubtedly played an important part among mammals, and of the importance of which in man professed to be ignorant. The physiological significance of apparently important parts of the body was shrouded in obscurity. One could leave aside the cecum, which was a mystery, and which in the rabbit was regularly found filled with a mushy content, of which there was no telling how it might get out again or be renewed. But what about the white and gray matter of the head marrow, what about the optic hillock that communicated with the optic nerve, and the gray deposits of the ""bridge""? The brain and spinal cord substance was so decomposable that there was no hope of ever fathoming their structure. What prevented the cerebral cortex from working when you fell asleep? What hindered the self-digestion of the stomach, which indeed sometimes happened in cadavers? One answered: life; a special power of resistance of the living protoplasm, - and pretending not to notice that this was a mystical explanation. The theory of such a common phenomenon as fever was contradictory. The increased metabolism resulted in increased heat production. But why didn't the heat output increase to compensate, as usual? Was the paralysis of sweat secretion based on contraction states of the skin? But these were only detectable in the case of a fever, because otherwise the skin was rather hot. The ""heat stroke"" identified the central nervous system as the seat of the causes for the increased turnover as well as for a skin condition that one was content to call abnormal because one could not determine it.","But with all this the achievements of the protoplasm remained unaccountable: it seemed forbidden to life that it should understand itself. Most of the bio-chemical processes were not only unknown, it lay in their very nature that they should escape attention. Almost nothing was known of the structure or composition of the living unit called the “cell.” What use was there in establishing the components of lifeless muscle, when the living did not let itself be chemically examined? The changes that took place when the rigor mortis set in were enough to make worthless all investigation. Nobody understood metabolism, nobody understood the true inwardness of the functioning of the nervous system. To what properties did the taste corpuscles owe their reaction? In what consisted the various kinds of excitation of certain sensory nerves by odour-possessing substances? In what, indeed, the property of smell itself? The specific odours of man and beast consisted in the vaporization of certain unknown substances. The composition of the secretion called sweat was little understood. The glands that secreted it produced aromata which among mammals undoubtedly played an important rôle, but whose significance for the human species we were not in a position to explain. The physiological significance of important regions of the body was shrouded in darkness. No need to mention the vermiform appendix, which was a mystery; in rabbits it was regularly found full of a pulpy substance, of which there was nothing to say as to how it got in or renewed itself. But what about the white and grey substance which composed the medulla, what of the optic thalamus and the grey inlay of the pans Varolii? The substance composing the brain and marrow was so subject to disintegration, there was no hope whatever of determining its structure. What was it relieved the cortex of activity during slumber? What prevented the stomach from digesting itself—as sometimes, in fact, did happen after death? One might answer, life: a special power of resistance of the living protoplasm; but this would be not to recognize the mystical character of such an explanation. The theory of such an everyday phenomenon as fever was full of contradictions. Heightened oxidization resulted in increased warmth, but why was there not an increased expenditure of warmth to correspond? Did the paralysis of the sweat-secretions depend upon contraction of the skin? But such contraction took place only in the case of “chills and fever,” for otherwise, in fever, the skin was more likely to be hot. Prickly heat indicated the central nervous system as the seat of the causes of heightened catabolism as well as the source of that condition of the skin which we were content to call abnormal, because we did not know how to define it.","And yet, for all that, the accomplishments of protoplasm remained quite inexplicable—it seemed that life was prohibited from understanding itself. Not only were most biochemical processes unknown, but it was also their very nature to avoid examination. Almost nothing was understood about the construction and makeup of the unit of life known as the “cell.” What good did it do to uncover the components of dead muscle? The living tissue did not permit chemical analysis; the very changes that brought about rigor mortis were enough to make all such experimentation futile. No one understood metabolism, no one knew how the nervous system functioned. What made it possible for taste buds to taste? What made it possible for certain olfactory nerves to be stimulated by various odors? What, indeed, made something smell at all? The specific odor of animals or people resulted from the vaporization of substances that no one could identify. The composition of the secretion called sweat was poorly understood. The glands that excreted it also produced aromas that doubtless played an important role among mammals, but whose significance among humans no one was prepared to claim to know much about. The physiological significance of obviously important parts of the body remained shrouded in darkness. One could, of course, simply disregard the appendix, call it a mystery—except that the appendices of rabbits were regularly found filled with a pulpy substance, and no one could explain either how it ever got back out or was replenished. But what about the white and gray matter in the medulla, what about the optic thalamus and its connection to the eye, or the gray matter in the pons? Brain and spinal tissue deteriorated so quickly that there was no hope of determining its structure. What caused the cerebral cortex to shut down as one fell asleep? What prevented the stomach from digesting itself—which occasionally did happen with corpses? The answer people gave was: Life, a special immunity of living protoplasm—and acted as if they did not notice what a mystical explanation that was. The theory behind such a commonplace phenomenon as fever was self-contradictory. An increase in metabolism caused an increase in the production of body heat. But, then, why did the body not compensate, as usual, by releasing that heat? Instead, sweat production was retarded—was that because of a contraction of the skin? But that could be demonstrated only if a chill was also present—otherwise the skin remained hot. “Hot flashes” would indicate that the central nervous system was the seat both of whatever caused catabolism and of a skin condition we are content to call abnormal, simply because we do not know any better way to define it."

"Mynheer sprach in ungewöhnlich präzisem und geschlossenem Stil heute nachmittag, trotz seiner Erschöpfung durch den malignen Anfall. Es fehlte fast jede Abgerissenheit. Im Bette halb sitzend, die mächtigen Schultern, das großartige Haupt gegen den Besucher gewandt, hielt er den einen Arm über der Bettdecke ausgestreckt, und seine sommersprossige Kapitänshand, aufrecht stehend am Ende des Wollärmels, bildete den von den Fingerlanzen überragten Exaktheitsring, während sein Mund die Worte so scharf und genau, ja plastisch bildete, wie Herr Settembrini es nur hätte wünschen können, mit geroll{917}tem Kehl-r in Wörtern wie »wahrscheinlich« und »aufgedrängt«.","Mynheer spoke in an unusually precise and composed style this afternoon, despite his exhaustion from the malignancy.

"Tal und Berge im Schnee seit sechs Monaten schon? Seit sieben! Die Zeit schreitet fort, während wir erzählen, – unsere Zeit, die wir dieser Erzählung widmen, aber auch die tief vergangene Zeit Hans Castorps und seiner Schicksalsgenossen dort oben im Schnee, und sie zeitigt Veränderungen. Alles war auf dem besten Wege, sich zu erfüllen, wie Hans Castorp es am {525}Faschingstage auf dem Heimwege von »Platz« zum Zorne Herrn Settembrinis mit raschen Worten vorweggenommen hatte: nicht gerade, daß schon die Sonnenwende in unmittelbarer Aussicht gewesen wäre, aber Ostern war durch das weiße Tal gezogen, der April schritt vor, der Blick auf Pfingsten war frei, bald würde der Frühling anbrechen, die Schneeschmelze, – nicht aller Schnee würde schmelzen, auf den Häuptern im Süden, in den Felsschründen der Rhätikonkette im Norden blieb immerdar welcher liegen, von dem zu schweigen, der auch allsommermonatlich einfallen, aber nicht liegen bleiben würde; doch unbedingt verhieß die Umwälzung des Jahres entscheidende Neuerungen binnen kurzem, denn seit jener Fastnacht, in der Hans Castorp sich von Frau Chauchat einen Bleistift geliehen, ihr später denselben auch wieder zurückgegeben und auf Wunsch etwas anderes dafür empfangen hatte, eine Erinnerungsgabe, die er in der Tasche trug, waren nun schon sechs Wochen verflossen, – doppelt so viele, als Hans Castorp ursprünglich hatte hier oben bleiben wollen.","Valley and mountains in the snow for six months already? Since seven! Time advances while we tell - our time, which we devote to this story, but also the deep past time of Hans Castorp and his comrades in fate up there in the snow, and it produces changes. Everything was well on the way to being fulfilled, as Hans Castorp had anticipated with quick words on the {525} carnival day on the way home from ""Platz"" to the wrath of Mr. Settembrini: not exactly that the solstice was in the immediate prospect, but Easter had passed through the white valley, April was advancing, the view of Pentecost was clear, spring would come soon, the snow would melt - not all the snow would melt, on the heads in the south, in the chasms of the Rhaetikon chain in the north there was always one lying around, not to mention the one that would come every summer month, but wouldn't stay there; but the upheaval of the year definitely promised decisive innovations within a short time, because since that carnival in which Hans Castorp borrowed a pencil from Mrs. Chauchat, later gave it back to her and, if desired, received something else in return, a souvenir that he six weeks had passed, twice as many as Hans Castorp had originally wanted to stay up here.","Mountain and valley, then, had been lying in deep snow for six months; nay, seven, for as we talk, time strides on—not only present time, taken up with the tale we are telling, but also past time, the bygone time of Hans Castorp and the companions of his destiny, up among the snows—time strides on, and brings changes with it. The prophecy which so glibly, so much to Herr Settembrini’s disgust, Hans Castorp had made on the eve of Carnival, was in a fair way to be fulfilled. True, the solstice was not immediately at hand; yet Easter had passed over the valley, April advanced, with Whitsuntide in plain view; spring, with the melting of the snows, would soon be here. Not all the snow would melt: on the heights to the south, and on the north in the rocky ravines of the Rhatikon, some would still remain, and through the summer months more was sure to fall, though it would scarcely lie.","So, valley and mountains under snow for six months now? Seven! Time sweeps onward while we tell our tale—not only our time, the time we devote to the telling, but also the profoundly past time of Hans Castorp and those who share his fate up there in the snow—and it brings forth changes. Everything that Hans Castorp had anticipated—and all too hastily put into words for Herr Settembrini as they returned from Platz that afternoon before Mardi Gras—was well on its way to being fulfilled. Not that Midsummer Night was imminent, but Easter had already passed through the white valley , April was advancing, Pentecost loomed ahead in open view, and spring would soon begin and with it the snow would melt—though not all of it, there was always some on the peaks to the south and in the ravines of the Rhätikon chain to the north, not to mention what would fall all through summer without sticking."
"Seit Joachims Weggang saß Hans Castorp nicht mehr am Tische der Stöhr, nicht mehr an demjenigen, von dem Dr. Blu{641}menkohl weggestorben war, und an dem Marusja ihre unbegründete Heiterkeit im Apfelsinentüchlein erstickt hatte. Neue Gäste saßen jetzt dort, völlig fremde. Unser Freund aber hatte, zweieinhalb Monate tief in sein zweites Jahr eingerückt, von der Verwaltung einen anderen Platz zugewiesen bekommen, an einem Nachbartische, der schräg vor dem alten stand, weiter gegen die linke Verandatür, zwischen seinem ehemaligen und dem Guten Russentisch, kurzum am Tisch Settembrinis. Ja, an des Humanisten verwaistem Platze saß Hans Castorp jetzt, am Tischende wiederum, gegenüber dem Doktor-Sitz, der an jeder der sieben Tafeln dem Hofrat und seinem Famulus zum Hospitieren aufgespart blieb.","Since Joachim left, Hans Castorp has no longer sat at Stöhr's table, no longer at the one that Dr. {641}cauliflower had died away, and on which Marusja had suffocated her unfounded cheerfulness in a little orange handkerchief. New guests sat there now, complete strangers. But our friend, two and a half months into his second year, had been assigned another seat by the administration, at a neighboring table, which was diagonally in front of the old one, further towards the left-hand patio door, between his former table and the Good Russian Table, in short at the Table Settembrini. Yes, Hans Castorp was now sitting in the humanist's orphaned place, again at the end of the table, opposite the doctor's seat, which was reserved at each of the seven tables for the privy councilor and his famulus to sit in on.","Since Joachim’s departure Hans Castorp sat no more at Frau Stöhr’s table, the one with Dr. Blumenkohl’s empty place, at which the gay Marusja had been wont to smother her irresponsible mirth in her orange-scented pocket-handkerchief.

Our friend, two months deep in his second year, had been given a new place by the management at a near-by table, diagonally to his old one, between that and the “good” Russian table. In short, Settembrini’s table. Yes, Hans Castorp sat in the humanist’s vacated seat, again at the end, facing the “doctor’s place,” which at each of the seven tables was left free for the Hofrat and his famulus to use when they could.","Since Joachim’s departure, Hans Castorp no longer sat at Frau Stöhr’s table—the same table that had been abandoned by the late Dr. Blumenkohl and where Marusya had sat, stifling her unfounded mirth in her orange-scented handkerchief. New guests, total strangers, were sitting there now. Two and a half months into our friend’s second year, management had assigned him a different seat, at a neighboring table set crosswise to his old one, between it and the Good Russian table and farther toward the veranda door on the left—in short, Settembrini’s table. Yes, Hans Castorp was now sitting in the same spot the humanist had deserted; like his old place, it was at one end of the table, opposite the “doctor’s chair,” which was reserved at each of the seven tables for the director and his aide-de-camp."

That is highly important.”","“Benissimo!” Hans Castorp cried, availing himself in his eagerness of Herr Settembrini’s favorite expression of approval. “Time . . .as a universal divine institution—now that is extremely important!”"
"Die charitative Teilnahme nun aber für das arme Fräulein Karstedt brachte hierin einige Änderung hervor, – ohne unchristlich zu erscheinen, konnte Joachim keine Einwände dagegen erheben. Sie holten die Kranke aus ihrer dürftigen Wohnung in »Dorf« und führten sie bei prächtig heiß durchsonntem Frostwetter durch das nach dem Hotel d’Angleterre genannte Englische Viertel, zwischen den Luxusläden der Hauptstraße hin, auf der Schlitten läuteten, reiche Genießer und Tagediebe aus aller Welt, Bewohner des Kurhauses und der anderen großen Hotels, barhaupt in modischem Sportdreß aus edlen und teueren Stoffen, mit Gesichtern, bronziert von Wintersonnenbrand und Schneestrahlung, sich ergingen, und hinab auf den nicht weit vom Kurhause in der Tiefe des Tales gelegenen Eisplatz, der im Sommer eine zum Fußballspiel benutzte Wiese gewesen. Musik erscholl; die Kurkapelle konzertierte auf der Empore des hölzernen Pavillongebäudes zu Häupten der viereckig gestreckten Bahn, hinter welchem die verschneiten Berge im Dunkelblauen standen. Sie nahmen Einlaß, drängten sich durch das Publikum, das von drei Seiten, auf ansteigenden Sitzen, die Bahn umgab, fanden Plätze und schauten. Die Kunstläufer, in knapper Tracht, schwarzen Trikots, Pelzwerk an den Tressenjacken, wiegten sich, schwebten, zogen Figuren, sprangen und kreiselten. Ein virtuoses Paar, Herr und Dame, Professionals und außer Konkurrenz, vollführte etwas in der ganzen Welt nur von ihm Vermochtes, entfesselte Tusch und Händeklatschen. Im Kampf um den Schnelligkeitspreis arbeiteten sich sechs junge Männer verschiedener Nationalität, gebückt, die Hände auf dem Rücken, zuweilen das Taschentuch vor dem Munde, sechsmal um das weite Viereck. Man läutete mit einer Glocke in die Musik hin{478}ein. Zuweilen brandete die Menge in anfeuernden Zurufen und Beifall auf.","But the charitable participation for the poor Fraulein Karstedt brought about some changes in this - without appearing unchristian, Joachim could not raise any objections to it. They fetched the patient from her poor apartment in ""Dorf"" and led her through the glorious, hot, frosty weather through the English Quarter, named after the Hotel d'Angleterre, between the luxury shops and the main street, where sleighs rang, rich bon vivants and idlers from all over the world world, residents of the Kurhaus and the other large hotels, bareheaded in fashionable sportswear made of noble and expensive fabrics, with faces bronzed from winter sunburn and snow, went down to the ice rink not far from the Kurhaus in the depths of the valley, the been a meadow used for soccer games in summer. music rang out; the spa band gave concerts on the gallery of the wooden pavilion building at the top of the square stretched track, behind which the snowy mountains stood in the dark blue. They got in, pushed their way through the audience, which surrounded the track from three sides on raised seats, found seats and watched. The skaters, in skimpy costumes, black jerseys, fur on the braided jackets, swayed, hovered, pulled figures, jumped and spun. A virtuoso couple, gentleman and lady, professionals and out of competition, performed something in the whole world that only he could do, unleashed fanfare and hand clapping. In the fight for the speed prize, six young men of different nationalities worked their way around the wide arena six times, bent over, hands behind their backs, sometimes handkerchiefs over their mouths. A bell rang{478}into the music. At times the crowd erupted in cheers and applause.","But now his benevolent preoccupation with poor Fräulein Karstedt made some change in these views—and Joachim could hardly dissent without seeming unChristian. They fetched the patient at her humble lodging, in glorious, frosty-sunny weather, and escorted her through the English quarter, so named after the Hotel d’Angleterre, and along the main street, lined with luxurious shops. Sleighs were jingling up and down; there were hosts of people, the idle rich and pleasure-loving from all over the world, who filled the Kurhaus and the other hotels of the place; all hat-less, all clad in sports costumes which were the last word in elegance and beauty of fabric, all bronzed with winter sunburn and the glaring reflections from snowy slopes. All this world, including the cousins and their protegée, were betaking themselves to the rink, which lay in the depth of the valley not far from the Kurhaus; in summer it was a meadow, used for football. Music was playing, the Kurhaus band, stationed in the gallery of the wooden pavilion, above the four-cornered racecourse. Beyond all lay the mountains, in deep snow, against a dark-blue sky. Our young people passed through the entrance and the crowd that, seated in ascending tiers, surrounded the course on three sides; they found places for themselves, and sat down to look on. The professional skaters, in close-fitting costumes of black tricot with furred and braided jackets, cut figures, hovered and balanced, leaped and spun. A pair of virtuosi, male and female, professionals and hors concours, performed feats which they alone in all the world could perform, and evoked storms of applause and fanfares of trumpets. Six young men of various nationalities competed for the speed prize, and laboured six times round the four-sided course, bent over, with their hands behind their backs, some with handkerchiefs tied round their mouths. A bell rang in the midst of the music, and the crowd would burst out now and again with shouts of encouragement and applause.","Their charitable interest in poor Fräulein Karstedt, however, brought with it several changes in this respect—and Joachim could not object without seeming un-Christian. On a splendid, frosty, sun-drenched day, they stopped for the sick girl at her modest apartment in Dorf and strolled with her past the elegant shops lining the main street of the English quarter, named for the Hotel d’Angleterre. To the sound of sleigh bells, the idle, pleasure-loving rich from all over the world, residents of the Kurhaus and the other large hotels, promenaded—bareheaded, clad in the latest sports outfits of the most expensive fabrics, and bronzed by the winter sun reflected off the snow. The trio now walked toward the bottom of the valley to the ice rink, which was not far from the resort and in summer served as a soccer field. There was music in the air, the hotel band was playing a concert from a little gallery on the wooden pavilion at the far end of the rectangular rink, behind which snowcapped mountains rose against a deep blue sky. They paid to enter, pushed their way through the crowd assembling on bleachers set up on three sides of the rink, and took their seats to watch. The skaters, wearing brief tricot costumes, the jackets trimmed with fur and braid, swayed to and fro, traced figures, leapt, and spun. A man and a woman, a pair of highly talented professionals ineligible for competition, executed a feat no one else in the world could do—to great applause and a fanfare. The contestants for the race, six young men of various nationalities, sped six times around the wide rectangle— bodies bent low, hands behind their backs, some with a handkerchief pressed to their mouths. A bell rang out while the music played on. From time to time, waves of encouraging cries and applause surged up from the crowd."
Bis zu einem gewissen Grade war dadurch Herrn Settembrinis Pose unzweifelhaft zerstört. Er lächelte nicht ganz mühelos und sagte:,To a certain extent Mr. Settembrini's pose was undoubtedly destroyed by this. He smiled not quite effortlessly and said:,"To a certain point Herr Settembrini’s pose was undeniably shaken; his smile, as he answered, was slightly forced.","There was no doubt that to some extent this had a disruptive effect on Herr Settembrini’s pose. He smiled, but not without difficulty, and said, “I can appreciate a quick answer when I hear one, even when its logic borders on sophistry."

"Nun also ging das Berghof-Leben, dies gunstreiche und wohlgeregelte Leben auf engem Schauplatz wieder seinen gleichmäßigen Gang, – Hans Castorp, in Erwartung der Innenaufnahme, fuhr fort, es mit dem guten Joachim zu teilen, {315}indem er es Stunde für Stunde genau so trieb wie dieser; und diese Nachbarschaft war wohl gut für den jungen Mann. Denn obgleich es nur eine Krankennachbarschaft war, so war viel militärische Ehrbarkeit darin: eine Ehrbarkeit, die freilich, ohne es gewahr zu werden, schon im Begriffe stand, im Kurdienste Genüge zu finden, so daß dieser gleichsam zum Ersatzmittel tiefländischer Pflichterfüllung und zum untergeschobenen Berufe wurde, – Hans Castorp war nicht so dumm, es nicht ganz genau zu bemerken. Doch aber fühlte er wohl ihre zügelnde, zurückhaltende Wirkung auf sein zivilistisches Gemüt, – sogar mochte es diese Nachbarschaft sein, ihr Beispiel und die Beaufsichtigung durch sie, was ihn von äußeren Schritten und blinden Unternehmungen zurückhielt. Denn er sah wohl, was der brave Joachim von einer gewissen, täglich auf ihn eindringenden Apfelsinenatmosphäre, worin es runde braune Augen, einen kleinen Rubin, viel schwach gerechtfertigte Lachlust und eine äußerlich wohlgebildete Brust gab, auszustehen hatte, und die Vernunft und Ehrliebe, mit der Joachim den Einfluß dieser Atmosphäre scheute und floh, ergriff Hans Castorp, hielt ihn selbst in einiger Zucht und Ordnung und hinderte ihn, sich von der Schmaläugigen sozusagen »einen Bleistift zu leihen«, – wozu er ohne die disziplinierende Nachbarschaft aller Erfahrung nach sehr bereitgewesen wäre.","So now the Berghof life, this prosperous and well-regulated life on a small scene, went its steady pace again - Hans Castorp, while waiting for the interior shot, continued to share it with the good Joachim, {315}while reading it hour after hour just like this one; and this neighborhood was probably good for the young man. Because although it was only a sick neighborhood, there was a lot of military respectability in it: an honor which, without realizing it, was already on the point of finding satisfaction in the spa service, so that this became, so to speak, a substitute for fulfilling duties in the lowlands and for a job that was foisted on became, - Hans Castorp was not so stupid as not to notice it exactly. Yet he felt well their restraining, restraining effect upon his civilized mind--even it might be this neighborhood, their example, and their supervision, that restrained him from outward steps and blind enterprise. For he saw well what brave Joachim had to put up with from a certain orange atmosphere that invaded him daily, in which there were round brown eyes, a small ruby, a great deal of weakly justified lust for laughter and an outwardly well-formed chest, and the reason and love of honor, with Joachim shunned the influence of this atmosphere and fled, seized Hans Castorp, kept him in some discipline and order himself and prevented him from ""borrowing a pencil"" from the narrow-eyed woman, so to speak - which, without the disciplining neighborhood, he was very willing to do, according to all experience would.","But now the Berghof life, that wonderfully favoured and well-regulated existence, was once more in full swing on its narrow stage. Hans Castorp, whilst awaiting his xray examination, continued to enjoy its measured course, together with good Cousin Joachim, and to do, hour for hour, precisely as he did. No question but his cousin’s society was beneficial to our young man. For though Joachim’s were but a companionship in suffering, yet he suffered, as it were, conformably with military etiquette; even, though unconsciously, to the point of finding satisfaction in the service of the cure, of substituting it for the service down below and making of it an interim profession. Hans Castorp was not so dull as not to perceive all this, yet at the same time he was aware of its corrective and restraining influence upon his more civilian temper. It may have been this companionship, its example and the control it exercised, which held him back from overt steps and rash undertakings. For he saw all that Joachim had to endure from the daily assaults of an orange-scented atmosphere, commingled of such elements as round brown eyes, a little ruby, a great deal of unwarranted laughter, and a bosom fair to outward eyes. The honour and good sense which made Joachim flee these enticements gripped Hans Castorp, kept him under control, and prevented him from “borrowing a lead-pencil” so to speak—from the narrow-eyed one, a thing which he otherwise, from what we know of him, might well have been ready to do.","And so now life at the Berghof—this blessed and well-regulated life on a narrow stage—resumed its steady pace. And while Hans Castorp waited to have a picture taken of his interior, he continued to share that life with dear old Joachim, doing exactly what he did, hour for hour; and close proximity with his cousin was probably good for the young man. It was a proximity based solely on illness; all the same, Joachim had a great deal of military integrity about him—though, granted, without his even being aware of it, that integrity was being increasingly satisfied by rest cures, to the point where they had become, as it were, a substitute for duties fulfilled in the flatlands, a kind of spurious occupation. Hans Castorp was not so dull that he had not noticed that much quite accurately, but he also sensed an inhibiting, restraining effect on his own civilian sentiments—indeed it may have been this proximity, the example he took from it and its supervisory aspect, that kept him from overt actions and blind adventures. For he could observe only too well how Joachim had to endure the daily, constant assaults of orange-scented handkerchiefs, round brown eyes, a little ruby, a great many unwarranted giggles, and an externally well-formed chest; and the common sense and love of honor, which enabled Joachim to avoid those assaults and flee from them, touched Hans Castorp, kept him under some control and prevented him from “borrowing a pencil,” as it were, from a certain narrow-eyed person—which experience taught him he would have been only too ready to do without Joachim’s disciplining proximity."
"»Ich danke sehr. Ganz vorschriftsmäßig«, antwortete Hans Castorp. »Vorwiegend auf ›horizontale Art‹, wie Sie es mit Vorliebe nennen sollen.«","""Thank you very much.

"Dieser Promenaden war Hans Castorp nun übersatt. Er hegte zwei Wünsche: der stärkste davon war der, mit seinen Gedanken und Regierungsgeschäften allein zu sein, und diesen hätte seine Balkonloge ihm, wenn auch oberflächlich, gewährt. Der andere aber, verbunden mit jenem, galt lebhaft einer inniger-freieren Berührung mit dem schneeverwüsteten Gebirge, für das er Teilnahme gefaßt hatte, und dieser Wunsch war unerfüllbar, solange ein unbewehrter und unbeschwingter Fuß{713}gänger es war, der sich mit ihm trug; denn sofort hätte ein solcher bis über die Brust im Elemente gesteckt, wenn er versucht hätte, über das allerorts rasch erreichte Ende der geschaufelten Verkehrspfade hinaus vorzudringen.","Hans Castorp was now fed up with these promenades. He entertained two desires: the strongest of these was to be alone with his thoughts and affairs of government, and this his balcony box would have granted him, albeit superficially. But the other, connected with that, was keen to have a more intimate, freer contact with the snow-devastated mountains for which he had taken an interest, and this wish could not be fulfilled as long as it was an unarmed and unexcited pedestrian who was with him wore; for such a person would immediately have been up to his chest in the element if he had tried to penetrate beyond the end of the shoveled traffic paths, which was quickly reached everywhere.","Hans Castorp was thoroughly sick of all the walks. He had two desires: one of them, the stronger, was to be alone with his thoughts and his stock-taking projects; and this his balcony assured to him. But the other, allied unto it, was a lively craving to come into close and freer touch with the mountains, the mountains in their snowy desolation; toward them he was irresistibly drawn. Yet how could he, all unprovided and foot bound as he was, hope to gratify such a desire? He had only to step beyond the end of the shovelled paths— an end soon reached upon any of them—to plunge breast-high in the snowy element.","Hans Castorp was fed up with such promenades. He had only two great wishes: the first, and stronger, was to be alone with his thoughts to “play king,” and his balcony permitted him to do that, at least perfunctorily. His other wish, however, bound up with the first, was to enjoy a freer, more active, more intense experience of the snowy mountain wilderness, for which he felt a great affinity; but as long as he remained a mere unarmed, uncharioted pedestrian, his wish could never be fulfilled; and had he attempted it, he would have found himself up over his chest in snow the moment he pressed on beyond the shoveled paths, all of which quickly came to an end."
"Da hob sich, wie immer bei diesem Gesange, aber diesmal durch gewisse Möglichkeiten verstärkt und zum Wunsche verdichtet, große Rührung auf in Hans Castorps Brust, und er dachte: »Müßig und sündig oder nicht, es wäre doch herzlich seltsam und ein sehr liebes Abenteuer. Er, wenn er damit zu tun hat, wird es nicht übelnehmen, wie ich ihn kenne.« Und er erinnerte sich des gleichmütig-liberalen »Bitte, bitte!«, das er einst, im Durchleuchtungslaboratorium, aus der Nacht zur Antwort erhalten, als er um Erlaubnis zu gewissen optischen Indiskretionen einkommen zu sollen geglaubt hatte.","Then, as always with this song, but this time strengthened by certain possibilities and condensed into a wish, Hans Castorp felt a great deal of emotion, and he thought: ""Idle and sinful or not, it would be really strange and a very dear adventure . He, if he has anything to do with it, won't take it amiss as I know him."" And he remembered the calm, liberal ""Please, please!"" he had thought he should ask for permission to make certain optical indiscretions.","and, as ever, Hans Castorp was filled by emotion at the sound, an emotion which this time circumstances magnified and as it were condensed into a longing; he thought: “Barren and sinful or no, it would be a marvellous thing, a darling adventure!

"Ein eigentümlicher, persönlich gewichtiger, wenn auch undeutlicher Mann. Die Berghof-Gesellschaft nahm regen Anteil {835}an ihm. Er habe sich kürzlich von den Kolonialgeschäften zurückgezogen, hieß es, und das Seine ins Trockene gebracht. Man sprach von seinem prächtigen Hause im Haag und seiner Villa in Scheveningen. Frau Stöhr nannte ihn einen »Geld-Magneten« (Magnat! Die Fürchterliche!) und konnte dabei auf eine Perlenreihe hinweisen, die Madame Chauchat seit ihrer Heimkehr zum Abendkleide trug, und die nach Karolinens Meinung wohl kaum als Zeugnis transkaukasischer Gattengalanterie verstanden werden durfte, sondern der »gemeinsamen Reisekasse« entstammte. Sie zwinkerte dabei, wies seitlich mit dem Kopf auf Hans Castorp und zog in parodistischer Betrübnis den Mund herunter, indem sie, unverfeinert durch Krankheit und Leiden, seine Mißlage zu rücksichtsloser Verhöhnung ausnutzte. Er bewahrte Haltung. Er verbesserte ihren Bildungsschnitzer sogar nicht ohne Witz. Sie habe sich versprochen, sagte er. Geldmagnat. Aber Magnet sei auch nicht schlecht, denn offenbar habe Peeperkorn viel Anziehendes. Auch der Lehrerin Engelhart, als sie ihn matt errötend, scheel lächelnd und ohne ihn anzusehen befragte, wie der neue Gast ihm behage, antwortete er mit gut bewahrtem Gleichmut. Mynheer Peeperkorn sei eine »verwischte Persönlichkeit«, sagte er, – eine Persönlichkeit, aber verwischt. Die Genauigkeit dieser Kennzeichnung bewies Objektivität und damit Gemütsruhe; sie warf die Lehrerin aus ihrer Position. Und was nun gar Ferdinand Wehsal und seinen verzerrten Hinweis auf die unerwarteten Umstände betraf, unter denen Frau Chauchat zurückgekehrt war, so bewies hier Hans Castorp, daß es Blicke gibt, die an präziser Eindeutigkeit um kein Haar dem artikuliertesten Worte nachstehen. »Erbärmlicher!« besagte der Blick, mit dem er den Mannheimer maß, besagte es unter Ausschluß jeder auch nur aufs leichteste fehlgehenden Auslegung, und Wehsal anerkannte denn auch diesen Blick und steckte ihn ein, ja er nickte sogar dazu, indem er seine zerstörten Zähne zeigte, {836}nahm aber doch von nun an Abstand davon, auf Spaziergängen mit Naphta, Settembrini und Ferge Hans Castorps Paletot zu tragen.","A peculiar, personally weighty, if indistinct man. The Berghof Society took an active interest in him {835}. It was said that he had recently retired from the colonial business and settled his own business. People spoke of his magnificent house in The Hague and his villa in Scheveningen. Frau Stöhr called him a ""money magnet"" (magnate! The terrible one!) and was able to point to a row of pearls that Madame Chauchat had been wearing with her evening dress since her return home, and which, in Caroline's opinion, should hardly be understood as evidence of Transcaucasian spousal gallantry. but came from the »common travel fund«. She winked, nodded to the side at Hans Castorp, and pulled down her mouth in parodic sadness, while, unrefined by illness and suffering, she exploited his misfortune for ruthless mockery. He kept his composure. He even corrected her educational blunder not without a joke. She made a promise, he said. money tycoon. But Magnet is not bad either, because apparently Peeperkorn has many attractions. Even the teacher Engelhart, when she asked him, blushing faintly, smiling slyly and without looking at him, how he liked his new guest, he answered with well-maintained equanimity. Mynheer Peeperkorn was a ""blurred personality,"" he said - a personality, but blurred. The accuracy of this identification demonstrated objectivity and thus composure; she threw the teacher out of her position. And as far as Ferdinand Wehsal was concerned and his distorted reference to the unexpected circumstances under which Frau Chauchat had returned, Hans Castorp proved here that there are looks that are by no means inferior to the most articulated words in terms of precise unambiguousness. ""Paterable!"" said the look with which he measured the Mannheimer, saying it to the exclusion of even the slightest misinterpretation, and Wehsal then acknowledged this look and pocketed it, yes, he even nodded to it, showing his ruined teeth showed, but from now on refrained from carrying Hans Castorp's Paletot on walks with Naphta, Settembrini and Ferge.","An odd man, and of great personal weight, though incoherent. The population of the Berghof were enthusiastic over him. It was reported that he had only lately retired from his colonial interests and transferred them to the continent. He was said to have a magnificent house at The Hague, and another at Scheveningen. Frau Stöhr called him a money magnet (the unhappy woman meant magnate) and indicated the string of pearls Frau Chauchat had worn in the evening since her return to the Berghof. These pearls, Frau Stöhr considered, were scarcely a token of affection from the transCaucasian husband; more likely they came out of the common travelling-trunk. She winked and jerked her head in the direction of Hans Castorp, whose discomfiture she parodied with her mouth drawn down—no, illness and affliction had had no power to refine Caroline Stöhr; her jeers over the young man’s disappointment positively went beyond bounds. He preserved his composure, and corrected her blunder, not unadroitly. It was magnate, not magnet she had meant to say, he told her. Moneymagnate. But magnet was not so bad after all—certainly Herr Peeperkorn had a good deal that was attractive about him. The schoolmistress, Fräulein Engelhart, with a wry smile, flushing dully, but not looking at him as she spoke, asked how he liked the new guest. He replied, quite calmly, that he found Mynheer Peeperkorn a “blurred personality”; a personality, that is, undoubtedly, though blurred. The precision of the characterization showed objectivity and poise; it dislodged the schoolmistress from her position. Ferdinand Wehsal, too, made oblique reference to the unexpected circumstances of Frau Chauchat’s return; and got from Hans Castorp proof that a look may be every whit as telling and unequivocal as the articulate word. “You paltry wretch,” said the stare with which Hans Castorp measured the Mannheimer—said it without the shadow of a doubt of its meaning. Wehsal understood that look, and pocketed it up; even nodded and showed his bad teeth; but from that time forward he ceased to carry Hans Castorp’s overcoat, when they went their walks with Naphta, Settembrini, and Ferge.","A peculiar man, a man of some personal authority, though rather vague—the society of the Berghof was very taken by him. He had recently retired from his colonial affairs, it was said, and was home free. They spoke of his splendid house in The Hague and his villa in Scheveningen. Frau Stöhr called him a “money magnet” and could point to a pearl necklace that Madame Chauchat had been wearing with her evening gowns since her return and that in Karoline’s opinion could hardly be considered evidence of Transcaucasian marital gallantry, but rather was the result of “shared travel expenses.” She winked as she said it; unrefined by sickness and suffering, she now pointed with her head in Hans Castorp’s direction and pulled down the corners of her mouth to parody his distress, mocking and ruthlessly exploiting his sad state. He kept his composure. He even corrected her malapropism with some wit. She had misspoken herself, he said—the word was magnate. But magnet was not all that bad, either, since Peeperkorn was obviously a very attractive man. And in response to Fräulein Engelhart, who without looking at him asked, with a dull blush and a skewed smile, how he liked their new guest, he said with perfect equanimity that Mynheer Peeperkorn was a “blurred personality”—a personality, true, but a blurred one. The precision of this characterization showed both his objectivity and his composure; it put the teacher off-balance. But in the case of Ferdinand Wehsal, who offered a twisted remark about the unexpected circumstances under which Frau Chauchat had returned, Hans Castorp proved there are glances that are every whit as unambiguous as the most precisely articulated words. “Poor wretch!” that glance said as it measured the man from Mannheim, and said it in a way that excluded even the remotest possibility of any other interpretation; and Wehsal acknowledged that glance and stomached it, even nodded and displayed his rotten teeth; but from then on, he refrained from carrying Hans Castorp’s overcoat when they went for walks with Naphta, Settembrini, and Ferge."
"»Danke, Herr Settembrini; es hat nach wie vor seine Schwierigkeiten damit. Ich halte für möglich, daß es das bis zum letzten Tage haben wird. Manche gewöhnen sich nie, sagte mein Vetter mir gleich, als ich ankam. Aber man gewöhnt sich daran, daß man sich nicht gewöhnt.«","'Thank you, Mr Settembrini; it still has its difficulties with it. I think it's possible that it will be until the last day. Some people never get used to it, my cousin told me as soon as I arrived. But you get used to not getting used to it.”","“Thanks, Herr Settembrini. It still has its difficulties it seems. It very likely will have, up to the last day. My cousin told me when I came that many people never got used to it. But one gets used in time to not getting used.”","“Thank you for asking, Herr Settembrini. As before, I am having my difficulties. I think it possible I may very well continue to have them until my last day here. Some people never get used to the air here, my cousin told me the day I arrived. But one gets used to not getting used to it.”"
"Herr Settembrini wusch ihm den Kopf nach Gebühr und erzielte denn auch eine augenblickliche Gewissensstärkung und etwas wie ein Versprechen, an solchem Greuel nie wieder teilhaben zu wollen. »Achten Sie«, so forderte er, »den Menschen in sich, Ingenieur! Vertrauen Sie dem klaren und humanen Gedanken und verabscheuen Sie die Hirnverrenkung, den geistigen Pfuhl! Gaukelei? Lebensgeheimnis? Caro mio! Wo der sittliche Mut zu Entscheidungen und Unterscheidungen, wie der zwischen Betrug und Wirklichkeit, sich zersetzt, da ist es mit dem Leben überhaupt, dem Urteile, dem Werte, der bessernden Tat zu Ende, und der Verwesungsprozeß moralischer Skepsis beginnt sein schauerliches Werk.« Der Mensch sei das Maß der Dinge, sagte er noch. Sein Recht, über Gut und Böse, Wahrheit und Lügenschein erkennend zu befinden, sei unveräußerlich, und wehe dem, der ihn im Glauben an dieses schöpferische Recht zu beirren sich unterfange! Es sei ihm besser, einen Mühlstein um den Hals im tiefsten Brunnen ertränkt zu werden.","M. Settembrini washed his head properly and got a momentary strengthening of his conscience and something like a promise never to take part in such atrocities again. ""Respect,"" he demanded, ""the human being in you, engineer! Trust the clear and humane thought and abhor the contortion of the brain, the mental cesspool! trickery? life secret? caro mio Where the moral courage to make decisions and distinguish between deceit and reality decomposes, that is where life in general, judgment, value, and improving deeds come to an end, and the process of decay of moral skepticism begins its horrible work.« Man is the measure of all things, he said. His right to decide about good and evil, truth and falsehood is inalienable, and woe to him who dares to confuse his belief in this creative right! It was better for him to be drowned in the deepest well with a millstone around his neck.","Herr Settembrini duly gave him a dressing-down, and did produce a temporary reaction of the conscience, even something like a promise to steer clear in the future of such abominations. “Have respect,” he adjured him, “for your humanity, Engineer! Confide jn your God-given power of clear thought, and hold in abhorrence these luxations of the brain, these miasmas of the spirit! Delusions? The mystery of life? Caro mío! When the moral courage to make decisions and distinctions between reality and deception degenerates to that point, then there is an end of life, of judgment, of the creative deed: the process of decay sets in, moral scepsis, and does its deadly work.” Man, he went on to say, was the measure of things. His right to recognize and to distinguish between good and evil, reality and counterfeit, was indefeasible; woe to them who dared to lead him astray in his belief in this creative right. Better for them that a millstone be hanged about their necks and that they be drowned in the depth of the sea.","Herr Settembrini hauled him over the coals quite properly and managed to firm up his conscience at least temporarily, extracting something like a promise never again to participate in such horrors. “Pay attention,” he demanded, “to the human being inside you, my good engineer. Trust its clear and humane thoughts and abhor this wrenching of the brain, this intellectual swamp. Illusions? Secret of life? Caro mio! When the moral courage to decide and differentiate between fraud and reality begins to melt away, that marks the end of life itself, of formed opinions, of values, of any improving deed, and the corruptive process of moral skepticism begins its awful work.” Man was the measure of all things, he added. Man had an inalienable right to make knowledgeable judgments about good and evil, about truth and the sham of lies, and woe to anyone who dared confound his fellowman’s belief in that creative right. It would be better a millstone were hung about his neck and he were drowned in the deepest well."
"Es war einer mehr im Zimmer, als vordem. Dort, abseits von der Gesellschaft, im Hintergrund, wo die Reste des Rotlichtes sich fast in Nacht verloren, so daß die Augen kaum noch dahin drangen, zwischen Schreibtisch-Breitseite und spanischer Wand, auf dem gegen das Zimmer gedrehten Besucherstuhl des Doktors, wo während der Pause Elly gesessen, saß Joachim. Es war Joachim mit den schattigen Wangenhöhlen und dem Kriegsbart seiner letzten Tage, in dem die Lippen so voll und stolz sich wölbten. Angelehnt saß er und hielt ein Bein über das andere geschlagen. Auf seinem abgezehrten Gesicht erkannte man, obgleich es von einer Kopfbedeckung beschattet war, den Stempel des Leidens und auch den Ausdruck von Ernst und Strenge wieder, der es so männlich verschönt hatte. Zwei Falten standen auf seiner Stirn zwischen den Augen, die tief in knochigen Höhlen lagen, doch das beeinträchtigte nicht die Sanftmut des Blicks dieser schönen, groß-dunklen Augen, der still und freundlich spähend auf Hans Castorp, auf diesen allein, gerichtet war. Sein kleiner Kummer von ehedem, die abstehenden Ohren waren erkennbar auch unter der Kopfbedekkung, der sonderbaren Kopfbedeckung, auf die man sich nicht verstand. Vetter Joachim war nicht in Zivil; sein Säbel schien am übergeschlagenen Schenkel zu lehnen, er hielt die Hände am Griff, und etwas wie eine Pistolentasche glaubte man gleichfalls {1033}an seinem Gürtel zu unterscheiden. Doch war das auch kein richtiger Waffenrock, was er trug. Nichts Blankes noch Farbiges war daran zu bemerken, es hatte einen Litewkakragen und Seitentaschen, und irgendwo ziemlich tief saß ein Kreuz. Die Füße Joachims wirkten groß und die Beine sehr dünn; sie schienen eng eingewickelt, auf sportliche mehr, denn auf militärische Art. Und wie war das mit der Kopfbedeckung? Sie sah aus, als hätte Joachim sich ein Feldgeschirr, einen Kochtopf aufs Haupt gestülpt und ihn durch Sturmband unter dem Kinn befestigt. Doch wirkte das altertümlich und landsknechthaft und kriegerisch kleidsam, merkwürdigerweise.","There was one more in the room than before. There, away from society, in the background, where the remnants of the red light are almost lost in the night so that your eyes can hardly see there, between the long side of the desk and the screen, on the doctor's visitor's chair turned towards the room, where while the break Elly sat, Joachim sat. It was Joachim with the shadowy hollow cheeks and the war beard of his last days, with lips that curled so full and proud. He sat leaning against it, one leg crossed over the other. On his emaciated face, although it was shaded by a hat, one recognized the stamp of suffering and also the expression of seriousness and severity that had beautified it so manly. There were two wrinkles on his forehead between his eyes, which lay deep in bony sockets, but that didn't affect the gentleness of those beautiful, large, dark eyes, which looked quietly and friendly at Hans Castorp, at him alone. His little grief from before, the protruding ears were recognizable even under the headgear, the strange headgear that no one understood. Cousin Joachim was not in civilian clothes; his saber seemed to be leaning against his crossed thigh, he was holding his hands on the hilt, and one also thought to distinguish {1033}something like a pistol holster on his belt. But it wasn't a real tunic either, what he wore. There was nothing bright or colored about it, it had a litewka collar and side pockets, and a cross was set somewhere rather low. Joachim's feet seemed large and his legs very thin; they seemed to be wrapped up tightly, more in a sporting way than in a military way. And what about the headgear? She looked as if Joachim had put a field harness, a cooking pot, on his head and fastened it under his chin with a storm tie. But that seemed archaic and lansquenet-like and warlike becoming, strangely enough.","There was one more person in the room than before. There in the background, where the red rays lost themselves in gloom, so that the eye scarcely reached thither, between writing-desk and screen, in the doctor’s consulting-chair, where in the intermission Elly had been sitting, Joachim sat. It was the Joachim of the last days, with hollow, shadowy cheeks, warrior’s beard and full, curling lips. He sat leaning back, one leg crossed over the other. On his wasted face, shaded though it was by his head-covering, was plainly seen the stamp of suffering, the expression of gravity and austerity which had beautified it. Two folds stood on his brow, between the eyes, that lay deep in their bony cavities; but there was no change in the mildness of the great dark orbs, whose quiet, friendly gaze sought out Hans Castorp, and him alone. That ancient grievance of the outstanding ears was still to be seen under the head-covering, his extraordinary head-covering, which they could not make out. Cousin Joachim was not in mufti. His sabre seemed to be leaning against his leg, he held the handle, one thought to distinguish something like a pistol-case in his belt. But that was no proper uniform he wore. No colour, no decorations; it had a collar like a litewka jacket, and side pockets. Somewhere low down on the breast was a cross. His feet looked large, his legs very thin, they seemed to be bound or wound as for the business of sport more than war. And what was it, this headgear? It seemed as though Joachim had turned an army cook-pot upside-down on his head, and fastened it under his chin with a band. Yet it looked quite properly warlike, like an old-fashioned foot-soldier, perhaps.","There was one more person than before in the room. There, off to the side of the semicircle, in the background, where the red light was swallowed up in night that the eye could barely pierce, between the doctor’s wide desk and the folding screen, there on the patient’s chair turned toward the room, where Elly had sat during the pause—there sat Joachim. It was Joachim with the shadowy hollow cheeks and warrior’s beard from his final days, with lips arched proud and full. He sat leaning back, one leg crossed over the other. Although whatever that was on his head cast a long shadow, his emaciated face visibly bore the stamp of suffering and the same austere, earnest expression that had made him look so manly. Two deep creases were engraved on his brow between the eyes, which had sunk deep into their bony sockets, although that did not distract from the tenderness of the gaze that came from those beautiful, large, dark eyes, directed in friendly silence at Hans Castorp, at him alone. His one minor sorrow of long ago, his protruding ears, was not noticeable under whatever that strange, unidentifiable thing was that he had on his head. Cousin Joachim was not in civvies; his saber appeared to be leaning against his crossed thigh and he held the hilt in both hands; also discernible, or so it seemed, was a holster attached to his belt. But this was no proper dress uniform he was wearing—no flash of color, no shiny buttons. It had a narrow tuniclike collar and side pockets, and a cross was dangling farther down. Joachim’s feet seemed very large, his legs very thin—and they looked as if they had been wrapped, more for sport than for any military reason. And what was that thing on his head? It looked as if Joachim had plopped a bit of field gear, a cooking pot, down over his head and then fastened it under his chin with a strap. The effect was properly warlike, and yet it was like something out of the past, a sixteenth-century lansquenet perhaps—strange."
"»Ah, Sie tragen es im Portefeuille. Wie einen Ausweis sozusagen, einen Paß oder eine Mitgliedskarte. Sehr gut. Lassen Sie sehen!« Und Herr Settembrini hob die kleine, mit schwarzen Papierstreifen gerahmte Glasplatte gegen das Licht, indem er sie zwischen Daumen und Zeigefinger seiner Linken hielt, – eine oft gesehene, sehr übliche Bewegung hier oben. Sein Gesicht mit den schwarzen Mandelaugen grimassierte ein wenig, während er das funebre Lichtbild prüfte, – ohne ganz deutlich werden zu lassen, ob es nur des genaueren Sehens wegen oder aus anderen Gründen geschah.","'Ah, you carry it in your portfolio. Kind of like an ID card, a passport or a membership card. Very well. Let's see!' And Mr. Settembrini, holding it between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand, raised the small glass plate, framed with strips of black paper, towards the light - a movement often seen, very usual up here. His face, with the black almond eyes, grimaced a little as he examined the funebre photograph - without making it quite clear whether it was only for the sake of a closer look or for other reasons.","“Ah, you carry it in a case. Like a certificate, as it were—a sort of membership card. Very good. Let me see it.” And Herr Settembrini held it against the light, between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand; a little glass plate framed in strips of black paper. The gesture was a common one up here, one often saw it. His face, with the black almond-shaped eyes, displayed a slight grimace as he did so, but whether this happened in the effort to see more clearly or for other causes, he did not permit it to appear.","“Ah, you carry it in your wallet. As a kind of identification, like a passport or membership card. Very good. Let me see.” And Herr Settembrini raised the little glass plate framed with black paper up to the light, holding it between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand—a gesture one saw quite frequently up here. As he examined the funereal photograph, a little scowl passed over his face with its black almond-shaped eyes—though it was not clear if his scowl was an attempt to see better or if there were other reasons for it."
"»Nein, ich interessiere mich nicht im geringsten für mein Skelett. Und das ärztliche Ergebnis?«","'No, I'm not the least bit interested in my skeleton. And the medical result?'","“No, I don’t take the faintest interest in my skeleton. But what was the physician’s verdict?”","“No, I’m not the least bit interested in my own skeleton. And what was the medical finding?”"
"»Wie? Also nicht neulich. Du bist aber genau. Ich habe die Zahl ja nur so geraten. Also vor einiger Zeit, da habe ich doch einmal hinter die Kulissen gesehen, aus reinem Zufall, ich weiß {84}es wie heute. Das war, als sie der kleinen Hujus, einer Katholischen, Barbara Hujus, das Viatikum brachten, das Sterbesakrament, weißt du, die letzte Ölung. Sie war noch auf, als ich hier ankam, und ausgelassen lustig konnte sie sein, so dalberig, recht wie ein Backfisch. Aber dann ging es rapide mit ihr, sie stand nicht mehr auf, drei Zimmer von meinem lag sie, und ihre Eltern kamen, und nun kam denn also der Priester. Er kam, während alles beim Tee war, nachmittags, es war kein Mensch auf den Gängen. Aber stelle dir vor, ich hatte verschlafen, ich war in der Hauptliegekur eingeschlafen und hatte das Gong überhört und mich um eine Viertelstunde verspätet. Da war ich nun im entscheidenden Augenblick nicht, wo alle waren, sondern war hinter die Kulissen geraten, wie du sagst, und wie ich über den Korridor gehe, da kommen sie mir entgegen, in Spitzenhemden und ein Kreuz voran, ein goldenes Kreuz mit Laternen, der eine trug es voran wie den Schellenbaum vor der Janitscharenmusik.«","""As? So not recently. But you are accurate. I just guessed the number. Well, some time ago I saw behind the scenes, purely by chance, I know it like today. That's when they brought little Hujus, a Catholic, Barbara Hujus, the Viatikum, the last sacrament, you know, last rites. She was still up when I got here, and she could be wildly merry, as foolish, right as a fried fish. But then things happened quickly with her, she didn't get up anymore, she was three rooms from mine, and her parents came, and then the priest came. He came in the afternoon while everyone was having tea, there wasn't anyone in the corridors. But imagine, I overslept, I fell asleep during the main rest period and didn't hear the gong and was fifteen minutes late. At the crucial moment I wasn't where everyone was, but had gotten behind the scenes, as you say, and as I walk down the corridor, they come towards me, in lace shirts and a cross, a golden cross with lanterns , one of them carried it forward like the bell tree before the music of the Janissaries.«","“What? Well, not lately, then, since you’re so precise. I was just trying to reckon. Well, then, some time ago, it was, I got a glimpse behind the scenes—purely by chance—and I remember it as if it were yesterday. It was when they brought the Sacrament to little Hujus, Barbara Hujus—she was a Catholic—the Last Sacrament, you know, Extreme Unction. She was still about when I first came up here, and she could be wildly hilarious, regularly giggly, like a little kid. But after that it went pretty fast with her, she didn’t get up any more—her room was three doors off mine—and then her parents arrived, and now the priest was coming to her. It was while everybody was at tea, not a soul in the passages. But I had gone to sleep in the afternoon rest and overslept myself, I hadn’t heard the gong and was a quarter of an hour late. So that at the decisive moment I wasn’t where all the others were, but behind the scenes, as you call it; as I go along the corridor, they come toward me, in their lace robes, with the cross in front, a gold cross with lanterns—it made me think of the Schellenbaum they march with, in front of the recruits.”","“What? Well then, not so recently. You’re so precise. I was just guessing at the date. But anyway, some time ago, I had a peek backstage myself, purely by accident, but it’s as real as if it had happened today. It was the little Hujus girl, Barbara Hujus—she was Catholic— when they brought her the viaticum, the sacrament for the dying, you know, extreme unction. She was still up and about when I arrived here, and could be so playfully funny, so downright silly, a real teenager. But then it all went very fast , she couldn’t get up anymore, lay bedridden just three rooms down from me, and her parents came, and so now the priest arrived, too. He came one afternoon, when everyone was at tea, with nobody in the halls. But you have to picture it—I had overslept, had fallen asleep during my rest cure and hadn’t heard the gong and was a quarter hour late. And so at the decisive moment I happened not to be where everyone else was, but had wandered backstage, as you put it, and as I’m walking down the corridor, I see them coming toward me, in lace shirts, a cross leading the way, a gold cross with little lanterns, one of them carrying it up front like the glockenspiel in a Turkish-style military band.”"
"Zufällig blickte er ins Nebenzimmer bei diesen Worten und sah dort Frau Chauchat von vorn, ihre schmalen Augen und breiten Backenknochen. Woran, dachte er, woran und an wen in aller Welt erinnert sie mich nur. Aber sein müder Kopf wußte die Frage trotz einiger Anstrengung nicht zu beantworten.","As he said this he happened to look into the next room and saw Frau Chauchat from the front, her narrow eyes and broad cheekbones. What, he thought, what and who on earth does she remind me of. But his tired head couldn't answer the question despite some effort.","He happened, as he spoke, to direct his gaze into the next room, and saw Frau Chauchat’s full face, with its narrow eyes and broad cheek-bones. “What is it, what or whom in all the world does she remind me of?” But his weary brain, despite the effort he made, refused an answer.","And as he said it, quite by chance he caught a glimpse of Frau Chauchat in the next room, head-on—her narrow eyes and broad cheekbones. “What is it,” he thought, “what or who is it that she reminds me of, for heaven’s sake?” But try as he might, his weary brain could find no answer."
"Übrigens bekam er kein Nasenbluten mehr auf seiner Bank am Wildwasser, das war vorbei. Seine Akklimatisation, die Joachim ihm sogleich als schwierig hingestellt und die ihre Schwierigkeit denn auch bewährt hatte, war vorgeschritten, sie mußte nach elf Monaten als vollendet gelten, und Weitergehendes in dieser Richtung war kaum zu gewärtigen. Der Chemismus seines Magens hatte sich geregelt und angepaßt, Maria Mancini schmeckte, die Nerven seiner ausgetrockneten Schleimhäute kosteten längst wieder empfänglich die Blume dieses preiswerten Fabrikats, das er sich nach wie vor, wenn der {586}Vorrat zur Neige ging, mit einer Art von Pietätsgefühl aus Bremen verschrieb, obgleich sehr einladende Ware sich in den Schaufenstern des internationalen Kurortes empfahl. Bildete Maria nicht eine Art von Verbindung zwischen ihm, dem Entrückten, und dem Flachlande, der alten Heimat? Unterhielt und bewahrte sie dergleichen Beziehungen nicht wirksamer als etwa die Postkarten, die er dann und wann nach unten an die Onkel richtete, und deren Abstände voneinander in demselben Maße größer geworden waren, als er sich unter Annahme hiesiger Begriffe eine großartigere Zeitbewirtschaftung zu eigen gemacht hatte? Es waren meistens Ansichtskarten, der größeren Gefälligkeit halber, mit hübschen Bildern des Tales im Schnee wie in sommerlicher Verfassung, und sie boten für Schriftliches nur eben soviel Raum, als nötig war, um die neueste ärztliche Verlautbarung zu überliefern, das Ergebnis einer Monats- oder Generaluntersuchung verwandtschaftlich zu melden, das heißt also: etwa mitzuteilen, daß akustisch wie optisch eine unverkennbare Besserung zu verzeichnen gewesen, daß er aber noch nicht entgiftet sei, und daß die leichte Übertemperatur, in der er immer noch stehe, von den kleinen Stellen komme, die eben noch vorhanden seien, aber bestimmt ohne Rest verschwinden würden, wenn er Geduld übe, so daß er dann keinesfalls wiederzukommen brauche. Er durfte sicher sein, daß darüber hinausgehende briefstellerische Leistungen von ihm nicht verlangt und erwartet wurden; es war keine humanistisch rednerische Sphäre, an die er sich wandte; die Antworten, die er erhielt, waren ebensowenig ergußhafter Art. Sie begleiteten meistens die geldlichen Subsistenzmittel, die ihm von zu Hause zukamen, die Zinsen seines väterlichen Erbes, die sich in hiesiger Münze so vorteilhaft ausnahmen, daß er sie niemals verzehrt hatte, wenn eine neue Lieferung eintraf, und bestanden in einigen Zeilen Maschinenschrift, gezeichnet James Tienappel, mit Grüßen und Genesungswünschen vom Großonkel und manchmal auch von dem seefahrenden Peter.","By the way, he didn't get any more nosebleeds on his bank by the white water, that was over. His acclimatization, which Joachim immediately described as difficult and which proved to be difficult, had progressed; it had to be considered complete after eleven months, and further progress in this direction was hardly to be expected. The chemistry of his stomach had regulated itself and adjusted itself, Maria Mancini tasted, the nerves of his dried-up mucous membranes had long since receptively tasted the flower of this inexpensive product, which he still bought when the stock ran out with a kind of Reverence from Bremen prescribed, although very inviting goods were recommended in the shop windows of the international health resort. Didn't Maria form a kind of connection between him, the enraptured one, and the lowlands, the old homeland? She maintained and maintained such relationships no more effectively than, for example, the postcards which he now and then sent downstairs to his uncles, and the intervals between which had increased in proportion as he had adopted a grander management of his time, assuming local terms ? They were mostly picture postcards, for the sake of greater courtesy, with pretty pictures of the valley in the snow as if it were in summer condition, and they offered just enough space for writing only as was necessary to convey the latest medical report, the result of a monthly or To report relatives to the general examination, that means: to say, for example, that there was an unmistakable improvement, both acoustically and visually, but that he had not yet been detoxified and that the slight excess temperature he was still at came from the small spots, which were just there, but would certainly disappear without a trace if he was patient, so that he would not have to come back under any circumstances. He could be sure that he would not be asked or expected to do more than that; it was not a humanistic oratory sphere to which he addressed; the replies he received were just as little effusive. They mostly accompanied the monetary means of subsistence that came to him from home, the interest on his paternal inheritance, which looked so advantageous in local currency that he had never consumed it, if any new shipment arrived, and consisted of a few lines of typescript signed by James Tienappel, with greetings and get well wishes from great-uncle and sometimes from the seafaring Peter.","Now, at least, on his bench by the rushing water, he had no more nose-bleeding— that was a thing of the past. Joachim had said from the very first that it was not easy to get acclimatized, and at the time of that earlier visit he was still finding it difficult. But he had made progress; and now, after eleven months, the process must be regarded as finished. More, in that direction, could not be expected. The chemistry of his digestion had adjusted itself, Maria had her ancient relish, his parched mucous membranes having sufficiently recovered to let him savour again the bouquet of that estimable brand of cigars. He still loyally ordered them from Bremen whenever his stock ran low, although the shop-windows of the international resort displayed attractive wares. Maria, he felt, made a sort of bond between him, the exile, and his home in the “flat-land”—a bond more effectual than the postcards he now and then sent to his uncle, the intervals between which grew longer in proportion as he imbibed the more spacious time conceptions prevalent “up here.” He mostly sent picture postcards, as being pleasanter to receive, with charming views of the valley in winter and in summer dress. They gave precisely the room he needed to tell his kinsmen the latest news of his state, whatever had been let fall by the doctors after the monthly or general examination: such as that, both to sight and hearing, he had unmistakably improved, but was still not entirely free from infection; that his continued slight excess of temperature came from small infected areas which were certain to disappear without a trace if he had patience, and then he would never need to return hither. He well knew that long letters were neither asked nor expected, it being no humanistic or literary circle to which he addressed himself down there, and the replies he received were equally lacking in expansiveness. They merely accompanied the means of subsistence which came to him from home, the income from his paternal inheritance. Turned into Swiss currency, this was so advantageous that he had never spent one instalment when the next arrived, enclosed in a letter of a few typed lines signed “James Tienappel,” conveying his greetings and best wishes for recovery, together with the same from Grand-uncle Tienappel and sometimes from the seafaring Peter as well.","He no longer got nosebleeds, however, when he sat down on the bench beside the torrent—that was a thing of the past. The process of acclimatization, which from the very start Joachim had described as difficult and which had indeed proved to be so, had advanced to a point where, after eleven months, it had to be regarded as complete— further progress in that area was hardly noticeable now. His digestive chemistry had stabilized and adjusted. His Maria Mancinis tasted good again; the nerves of his dry mucous membranes had long since become receptive to the delicate aroma of the brand (a bargain at the price), so that for sentimental reasons he continued to order them from Bremen whenever his supply ran low, although the shop windows of an international resort displayed very inviting wares. Did not Maria act as a kind of connection between him, a man withdrawn from the world, and his former home in the flatlands? Did it not maintain and preserve those connections more effectively than, for instance, the postcards he now and then sent to his uncles, particularly since the intervals between them had been growing steadily longer the more he appropriated local conceptions of how to handle time on a grand scale? As a favor to the recipients, he usually sent picture postcards, with pretty views of the valley in either its snow-covered or summery state and just enough space for him to inform his kinsmen about the doctor’s latest statement after a monthly checkup or complete physical—for instance, that from what the doctor could both hear and see, some improvement was undeniable, but that he was not yet detoxified and that his chronically slightly raised temperature came from the continued presence of some small areas, which, if he were only patient, would definitely vanish completely so that he would never have to return here again. He could be certain that any literary efforts beyond these were not demanded or expected of him. The world he was addressing was not one with a tradition of humanistic rhetoric; the answers he received were no more effusive than his postcards and usually accompanied the monies needed for his maintenance here—interest on his paternal inheritance, the conversion of which into Swiss currency worked so much to his advantage that he never used up one installment before the next arrived from home. The letters consisted of a few typewritten lines signed by James Tienappel, with greetings and best wishes for recovery from his great-uncle and sometimes from seafaring Peter as well."

Eine internationale Liga, deren Ziel die gesetzliche Abschaffung der Todesstrafe in allen gesitteten Ländern sei, habe sich soeben gebildet. Herr Settembrini habe die Ehre, ihr anzugehören. Der Schauplatz ihres ersten Kongresses sei noch zu bestimmen, aber die Menschheit habe Grund, zu vertrauen, daß die Redner, die sich dabei würden vernehmen lassen, mit Argumenten gewappnet sein würden! Und er führte die Argumente an, darunter das von der immer vorhandenen Möglichkeit des Rechtsirrtums, des Justizmordes, sowie das von der niemals fahren zu lassenden Hoffnung auf Besserung; sogar »die Rache ist mein« zitierte er, lehrte auch, daß der Staat, wenn es ihm um Veredelung und nicht um Gewalt zu tun sei, nicht Böses mit Bösem vergelten dürfe, und verwarf den Begriff der »Strafe«, nachdem er vom Boden eines wissenschaftlichen Determinismus aus denjenigen der »Schuld« bekämpft hatte.","The world, smiled Mr. Settembrini confidently, will go back to business as usual about the revolution of anti-human backlash. Mr. Naphta would rather suspect art before admitting that it consecrates even the most depraved to be human. With such fanaticism it is impossible to win light-seeking youth. An international league whose goal is the legal abolition of the death penalty in all civilized countries has just been formed. Mr Settembrini had the honor of belonging to it. The venue of their first congress was yet to be determined, but mankind had reason to trust that the speakers who would be heard would be armed with arguments! And he led the arguments, including that of the ever-present possibility of error in law, of judicial murder, as well as that of never letting go of hope for improvement; he even quoted ""vengeance is mine,"" he also taught that the state, if it is about ennoblement and not violence, should not return evil for evil, and rejected the concept of ""punishment"" after it had fallen off the ground of scientific determinism from those who had fought ""guilt.""","Herr Settembrini, with a confident smile, assured them that the world, after passing through a period of inhuman reaction, would always return to the normal order of things. But Herr Naphta preferred to discredit art sooner than admit that it might have a humanizing effect upon a sunken wretch. He need not expect, by such fanatical talk, to make much headway with light-seeking youth. He, Settembrini, had the honour to belong to a newly-formed league, the scope of which was the abolition of capital punishment in all civilized countries. It was not yet settled where the first congress should meet; but one thing was sure, that those who addressed it would have plenty of arguments at hand. He submitted some of them forthwith: the ever-present possibility that justice might err and judicial murder be committed; the hope of reformation, which it was never possible to disregard; the biblical injunction “Vengeance is mine.” Then he referred to the theory that the State, in its function not as the wielder of force, but as the instrument of human betterment, may not repay evil with evil; he attacked the conception of guilt, on the ground of scientific determinism; and lastly, he repudiated the whole theory of punishment.","The world, Herr Settembrini said with a self-assured smile, would glide right past the revolution of inhuman reaction and move on to its real agenda. Herr Naphta would rather impugn art than admit it could make a human being of even the worst reprobate. Youth in search of light would never be won over by that kind of fanaticism. An international league whose goal was the abolition of capital punishment had just been formed in all civilized countries. Herr Settembrini had the honor of being a member. The venue for its first convention had not yet been chosen, but humankind could be certain that the speakers whom it would hear there would come armed with arguments. And he supplied those arguments himself, including both the ever-present possibility of a false verdict, whereby justice itself was executed, and the hope of rehabilitation, which ought never to be abandoned. And quoting the biblical verse “Vengeance is mine,” he pointed out that the state, if its purpose was ennoblement and not coercion, should not repay evil with evil, and went on to repudiate the concept of “punishment,” after first having refuted that of “guilt,” basing his argument on scientific determinism."

"Allein schon der folgende Tag, der erste Montag also, den der Hospitant hier oben verlebte, brachte eine weitere regelmäßig wiederkehrende Abwandlung des Tageslaufes: nämlich einen jener Vorträge, die Dr. Krokowski vierzehntägig im Speisesaal vor dem gesamten volljährigen, der deutschen Sprache kundigen und nicht moribunden Publikum des »Berghofes« hielt. Es handelte sich, wie Hans Castorp von seinem Vetter hörte, um eine Reihe zusammenhängender Kollegien, einen populär-wissenschaftlichen Kursus unter dem Generaltitel »Die Liebe als krankheitbildende Macht«. Die belehrende Unterhaltung fand nach dem zweiten Frühstück statt, und es war, wie wiederum Joachim sagte, nicht zulässig, wurde zum mindesten höchst ungern gesehen, daß man sich davon ausschlösse, – weshalb es denn auch als erstaunliche Frechheit galt, daß Settembrini, obgleich des Deutschen mächtiger als irgend jemand, die Vorträge nicht nur niemals besuchte, sondern sich auch in den abschätzigsten Äußerungen darüber erging. Was Hans Castorp betraf, so war er vor allem aus Höflichkeit, dann aber auch aus unverhohlener Neugier sofort entschlossen, sich einzufinden. Vorher jedoch tat er etwas ganz Verkehrtes und Fehlerhaftes: er ließ sich einfallen, auf eigene Hand einen ausgedehnten Spaziergang zu machen, was ihm über alles Vermuten schlecht bekam.","The following day alone, that is, the first Monday that the trainee spent up here, brought another regularly recurring change in the course of the day: namely one of those lectures that Dr. Krokowski held fortnightly in the dining room in front of the entire adult audience of the Berghof who spoke German and was not moribund. As Hans Castorp heard from his cousin, it was a series of related lectures, a popular-scientific course under the general title ""Love as a Disease-Creating Power."" The instructive conversation took place after the second breakfast, and, as Joachim said again, it was not permissible, or at least was seen with great reluctance, to exclude oneself from it - which is why it was also considered amazing cheek that Settembrini, although Germans more powerful than anyone, who not only never attended lectures, but also indulged in the most derogatory statements about them. As far as Hans Castorp was concerned, he decided to come, primarily out of politeness, but also out of undisguised curiosity. Before that, however, he did something completely wrong and wrong: he decided to go for a long walk on his own, which made him feel bad beyond all expectations.","But next day, the first Monday spent by the guest up here, there came another regularly recurring variation in the daily routine: the lectures, one of which Dr. Krokowski delivered every other Monday morning in the dining-room, before the entire adult population of the sanatorium, with exception of the “moribund” and those who could not understand the language. The course, Hans Castorp learned from his cousin, consisted of a series of popular-scientific lectures, under the general title: “Love as a force contributory to disease.” These instructive entertainments took place after second breakfast; it was not permissible, Joachim reiterated, to absent oneself from them—or, at least, absence was frowned upon. It was thus very daring of Settembrini, who surely must have more command of the language than anyone else, not only never to appear, but to refer to the entertainment in most disparaging terms. For Hans Castorp’s part, he straightway resolved to be present, in the first place out of courtesy, but also with unconcealed curiosity as to what he should hear. Before the appointed hour, however, he did something quite perverse and ill-judged, which proved worse for him than one could possibly have guessed: he went out for a long, solitary walk.","But the very next day, his first Monday up here as a visitor, brought another standard deviation from the routine—and that was one of the lectures Dr. Krokowski gave in the dining hall every two weeks before the entire German-speaking, nonmoribund, adult population of the Berghof. As Hans Castorp learned from his cousin, this was one of a series of popular-scientific talks presented under the general title “Love as a Force Conducive to Illness.” This instructive entertainment took place after second breakfast, and, as Joachim likewise informed him, it was not permitted, or was at the very least frowned upon, for anyone to absent himself—and it was therefore considered an amazing license that Settembrini, who surely was fluent in German as few others were, not only had never attended these lectures, but also vilified them at length. As for Hans Castorp, he had decided at once that he would attend—primarily out of courtesy, but also out of undisguised curiosity. Before the lecture, however, he did something quite perverse and ill advised: he took the notion of going for an extended walk all by himself, which turned out bad beyond all expectation."

"Hans Castorp erinnerte sich später, daß Madame Chauchat während dieser Mahlzeit einen goldgelben Sweater mit großen Knöpfen und bordierten Taschen getragen hatte, der neu, jedenfalls neu für Hans Castorp gewesen war, und worin sie bei ihrem wie immer verspäteten Eintritt, in der Art, die Hans Castorp so wohl an ihr kannte, einen Augenblick Front gegen den Saal gemacht hatte. Dann war sie, wie täglich fünfmal, zu ihrem Tische geglitten, hatte sich mit weichen Bewegungen niedergelassen und plaudernd zu essen begonnen: Hans Castorp hatte, wie jeden Tag, aber doch mit besonderer Aufmerksamkeit, ihren Kopf sich beim Sprechen bewegen sehen und aufs neue die Rundung ihres Nackens, die schlaffe Haltung ihres Rückens bemerkt, wenn er hinter dem Settembrinis vorbei, der am Ende des schräg zwischenstehenden Tisches saß, zum Guten Russentisch hinübergeblickt hatte. Frau Chauchat ihrerseits hatte sich während des Mittagessens kein einziges Mal nach dem Saale umgeblickt. Als aber der Nachtisch eingenommen gewesen war und die große Ketten- und Pendeluhr an der rechten Schmalseite des Saals, dort, wo der Schlechte Russentisch stand, zwei geschlagen hatte, da war es zu Hans Castorps rätselhafter Erschütterung dennoch geschehen: während die Uhr zwei schlug – eins und zwei –, hatte die anmutige Kranke langsam den Kopf und ein wenig auch den Oberkörper {269}gewandt und über die Schulter deutlich und unverhohlen zu Hans Castorps Tische – und nicht nur im allgemeinen zu seinem Tische, nein, unmißverständlich und streng persönlich zu ihm herübergeblickt, ein Lächeln um die geschlossenen Lippen und in ihren schmalgeschnittenen Pribislav-Augen, als wollte sie sagen: »Nun? Es ist Zeit. Wirst du gehen?« (denn wenn nur die Augen sprechen, geht ja die Rede per Du, auch wenn der Mund noch nicht einmal »Sie« gesagt hat) – und das war ein Zwischenfall gewesen, der Hans Castorp in tiefster Seele verwirrt und entsetzt hatte, – kaum hatte er seinen Sinnen getraut und entgeistert zuerst in Frau Chauchats Angesicht und dann, die Augen hebend, über ihre Stirn und ihr Haar hin ins Leere geblickt. Wußte sie denn, daß er sich auf zwei Uhr zur Untersuchung hatte bestellen lassen? Genau so hatte es ausgesehen. Und doch war es fast ebenso unwahrscheinlich, wie daß sie hätte wissen sollen, daß er soeben noch, in der jüngstvergangenen Minute, sich gefragt hatte, ob er nicht dem Hofrat durch Joachim sagen lassen sollte, seine Erkältung habe sich schon gebessert und er betrachte die Untersuchung als überflüssig: ein Gedanke, dessen Vorzüge unter jenem fragenden Lächeln freilich dahingewelkt waren und sich in lauter abstoßende Langweiligkeit verwandelt hatten. In der nächsten Sekunde hatte denn Joachim auch schon seine gerollte Serviette auf den Tisch gelegt, hatte ihm mit erhobenen Brauen zugewinkt, sich gegen die Umsitzenden verneigt und den Tisch verlassen, – worauf Hans Castorp innerlich taumelnd, wenn auch äußerlich festen Schrittes, und mit dem Gefühl, daß jenes Blicken und Lächeln immer noch auf ihm läge, dem Vetter zum Saal hinaus folgte.","Hans Castorp later recalled that during this meal Madame Chauchat had worn a yellow-gold sweater with large buttons and bordered pockets, which was new, at least new for Hans Castorp, and in which she, arriving late as usual, was of the kind that Hans Castorp, so well acquainted with her, had faced the hall for a moment. Then, as she did five times a day, she glided to her table, sat down with gentle movements and began to eat while chatting: Hans Castorp, like every day, but with special attention, had seen her head move when she spoke and again her Noticed the curve of her neck, the slackness of her back, when he looked past the Settembrinis, who was sitting at the end of the sloping table, towards the Good Russian Table. For her part, Madame Chauchat had not once looked back at the room during lunch. But when dessert had been eaten and the large chain and pendulum clock on the narrow right side of the room, where the Bad Russian Table was standing, had struck two, to Hans Castorp's mysterious shock it had happened nonetheless: while the clock struck two - one and two - the graceful patient had slowly turned her head and a little also her upper body and over her shoulder clearly and openly to Hans Castorp's table - and not only in general to his table, no, unmistakably and strictly personally glancing across at him, a smile on her closed lips and in her narrow-set Pribislav eyes, as if to say, 'Well? It's time. Will you go?” (because if only the eyes speak, the speech is on a first-name basis, even if the mouth hasn’t even said “Sie”) – and that was an incident that confused and horrified Hans Castorp to the core of his soul - he had scarcely believed his senses and, aghast, looked first at Frau Chauchat's face and then, raising his eyes, over her forehead and her hair into space. Did she know that he had been summoned for an examination at two o'clock? That's what it looked like. And yet it was almost as improbable as she should have known that just a moment ago, in the very last minute, he had been wondering whether he should not let Joachim tell the privy councilor that his cold had gotten better and that he was looking into it Examination as superfluous: a thought whose merits had certainly withered away under that questioning smile and turned into sheer repulsive boredom. In the next second Joachim had already put his rolled serviette on the table, had waved at him with raised eyebrows, bowed to those sitting around and left the table - whereupon Hans Castorp staggered inwardly, albeit with firm steps on the outside, and with the Feeling that those looks and smiles were still upon him which Cousin followed out of the hall.","Hans Castorp later recalled that Madame Chauchat was wearing that day a goldenyellow sweater, with large buttons and embroidered pockets. It was a new sweater, at least new to Hans Castorp, and when she made her entrance, tardily as usual, she had paused an instant and, in the way he knew so well, presented herself to the room. Then she had glided to her place at the table, slipped softly into it, and begun to eat and chatter to her table-mates. All this was as it happened every day, five times a day; Hans Castorp observed it as usual, or perhaps even more poignantly than usual, looking over at the “good” Russian table past Settembrini’s back, as he sat at the crosswise table between. He saw the turn of her head in conversation, the rounded neck, the stooping back. Frau Chauchat, for her part, never once turned round during the whole meal. But when the sweet had been handed, and the great clock on the wall above the “bad” Russian table struck two, it actually happened, to Hans Castorp’s amazement and mystification, that precisely as the hour struck, one, two, the fair patient turned her head and a little twisted her body and looked over her shoulder quite openly and pointedly at Hans Castorp ’s table. And not only at his table. No, she looked at himself, unmistakably and personally, with a smile about the closed lips and the narrow, Pribislav eyes, as though to say: “Well, it is time: are you going?” And the eyes said thou, for that is the language of the eyes, even when the tongue uses a more formal address. This episode shook and bewildered Hans Castorp to the depths of his being. He hardly trusted his senses, and at first gazed enraptured in Frau Chauchat’s face, then, lifting his eyes, stared into vacancy over the top of her head. Was it possible she knew he was to be examined at two o’clock? It looked like it; but that was as impossible as that she should be aware of the thought that had visited his mind in the last minute ; namely, that he might as well send word to the Hofrat, through Joachim, that his cold was better, and he considered an examination superfluous. This idea had presented itself to him in an advantageous light, but now withered away under that searching smile, transmuted into a hideous sense of futility. The second after, Joachim had laid his rolled-up serviette beside his plate, signalled to his cousin by raising his eyebrows, and with a bow to the company risen from the table. Whereat Hans Castorp, inwardly reeling, though outwardly firm in step and bearing, rose too, and feeling that look and smile upon his back, followed Cousin Joachim out of the room.","Hans Castorp remembered later that at dinner that day Madame Chauchat had worn a golden yellow sweater with large buttons and pockets trimmed with braid—a new sweater, or new at least to Hans Castorp, as he watched her make her entrance, late as always, and, just as he had come to expect, stand there at attention, facing the dining hall for a moment. Then, as she did five times every day, she had glided to her table, taken her seat in a soft, fluid motion, and begun to eat, while chatting with her neighbors. And as always Hans Castorp had glanced past Settembrini—who sat with his back to him at one end of the intervening crosswise table—to get a view of the Good Russian table; this time, however, he had paid particular notice to the way her head moved as she spoke, to the arch of her neck and the limp posture of her back. As for Frau Chauchat, she had not turned to look around the dining hall even once during the entire meal. But when they had all finished dessert, and the tall clock, a pendulum and chain affair at the far end of the room on the right, struck two, it had happened—much to Hans Castorp’s puzzlement and shock. For as the clock struck, once, then twice, the charming patient had slowly turned her head, and a little of her upper body, too, to gaze plainly and openly over her shoulder at Hans Castorp’s table—and not just at the table in general, no, quite unmistakably and very personally at him, a smile playing on her closed lips and in her narrow Pribislav eyes, as if to say: “Well? It’s time. Are you going to go, Hans?” (Because when only the eyes speak, things become quite informal, although her mouth had never even once said “Herr Castorp.”) The incident had confused and shocked Hans Castorp to the depths of his soul; he had barely been able to believe his eyes and had first gaped in stupefaction at Frau Chauchat’s face, and then, raising his gaze above her brow and hair, had stared into space. Had she known that he had made an appointment for an examination at two o’clock? It had certainly looked that way. And yet that seemed quite as unlikely as her knowing that he had just asked himself, not a minute before, whether he should not have Joachim tell the director that his cold was already better and that he now thought the examination superfluous—a new plan whose advantages had withered beneath her inquisitive smile and that had suddenly become disgustingly boring. Barely a second later, Joachim had placed his rolled-up napkin on the table, signaled with raised eyebrows, bowed to the others, and left the table—and Hans Castorp, still sensing both eyes and smile directed at him, had followed his cousin out. His step was firm, his mind was reeling."
"»Schnell und langsam, wie du nun willst«, antwortete Joachim. »Sie vergeht überhaupt nicht, will ich dir sagen, es ist gar keine Zeit, und es ist auch kein Leben, – nein, das ist es nicht«, sagte er kopfschüttelnd und griff wieder zum Glase.","""Fast and slow, as you wish,"" answered Joachim. ""It doesn't pass at all, I want to tell you, it's not time at all, and it's not life either - no, it's not that,"" he said, shaking his head and reaching for the glass again.","“Fast and slow, as you take it,” answered Joachim. “It doesn’t do at all, I tell you. You can’t call it time—and you can’t call it living either!” he said with a shake of the head, and fell to his glass again.","“Quickly and slowly, just as you like,” Joachim replied. “What I’m trying to say is that it doesn’t really pass at all, there is no time as such, and this is no life—no, that it’s not,” he said, shaking his head and reaching again for his glass."
"»Und Leopardi,« dachte Hans Castorp, »der ausdrücklich sogar an Wissenschaft und Fortschritt verzweifelte? Und er selbst, der Herr Schulmeister? Er ist doch auch krank und kommt immer wieder herauf, und Carducci hätte wenig Freude an ihm.« Laut sagte er:","'And Leopardi,' thought Hans Castorp, 'who expressly despaired even of science and progress? And he himself, the schoolmaster? He's sick too, and keeps coming up, and Carducci wouldn't take much pleasure in him."" Aloud he said:","“And Leopardi,” thought Hans Castorp, “who definitely despaired of science and progress? And our schoolmaster himself? He is infected too and keeps coming back here, and Carducci would have had small joy of him.” Aloud he said: “You are good!","“And what about Leopardi,” Hans Castorp thought, “who explicitly despaired of science and progress? Or what about our good schoolmaster himself? He’s ill and keeps coming back up here. Carducci wouldn’t have been all that happy with him, either.” But aloud he said, “Fine fellow you are."
"»Klares Bild«, sagte der Hofrat. »Das ist die anständige Magerkeit, die militärische Jugend. Ich habe hier Wänste gehabt, – undurchdringlich, beinahe nichts zu erkennen. Die Strahlen müßte man erst mal entdecken, die durch so eine Fettschicht gehen … Dies hier ist saubere Arbeit. Sehen Sie das Zwerchfell?« sagte er und wies mit dem Finger auf den dunklen Bogen, der sich unten im Fenster hob und senkte … »Sehen Sie die Buckel hier linkerseits, die Erhöhungen? Das ist die Rippenfellentzündung, die er mit fünfzehn Jahren hatte. Tief atmen!« kommandierte er. »Tiefer! Ich sage tief!« Und Joachims Zwerchfell senkte sich zitternd, so tief es konnte, Aufhellung war in den oberen Lungenteilen zu bemerken, aber der Hofrat war nicht befriedigt. »Ungenügend!« sagte er. »Sehen Sie die Hilusdrüsen? Sehen Sie die Verwachsungen? Sehen Sie die Kavernen hier? Da kommen die Gifte her, die ihn beschwipsen.« Aber Hans Castorps Aufmerksamkeit war in Anspruch genommen von etwas Sackartigem, ungestalt Tierischem, dunkel hinter dem Mittelstamme Sichtbarem, und zwar größerenteils zur Rechten, vom Beschauer aus gesehen, – das sich gleichmäßig ausdehnte und wieder zusammenzog, ein wenig nach Art einer rudernden Qualle.","""Clear picture,"" said the Hofrat. 'That's decent thinness, military youth. I had stomachs here - impenetrable, almost nothing to recognize. One would first have to discover the rays that go through such a layer of fat ... This is neat work here. See the diaphragm?” he said, pointing at the dark arch that rose and fell at the bottom of the window… “See those humps to the left here, the ridges? That's the pleurisy he had when he was fifteen. Breathe deeply!” he commanded. ""Deeper! I say deep!' And Joachim's diaphragm sank, trembling, as deeply as it could, lightening was noticeable in the upper parts of the lungs, but the privy councilor was not satisfied. ""Insufficient!"" he said. “See the hilar glands? Can you see the adhesions? Do you see the caverns here? That's where the poisons come from that make him tipsy.' But Hans Castorp's attention was occupied by something sack-like, misshapen, animal-like, visible dimly behind the central trunk, and for the most part to the right, as seen by the spectator,--extending evenly and again contracted, a little like a rowing jellyfish.","“Clear picture,” said the Hofrat, “quite a decent leanness—that’s the military youth. I’ve had paunches here—you couldn’t see through them, hardly recognize a thing. The rays are yet to be discovered that will go through such layers of fat. This is nice clean work. Do you see the diaphragm?” he asked, and indicated with his finger the dark arch in the window, that rose and fell. “Do you see the bulges here on the left side, the little protuberances? That was the inflammation of the pleura he had when he was fifteen years old. Breathe deep,” he commanded. “Deeper! Deep, I tell you!” And Joachim’s diaphragm rose quivering, as high as it could; the upper pans of the lungs could be seen to clear up, but the Hofrat was not satisfied. “Not good enough,” he said. “Can you see the hilus glands? Can you see the adhesions? Look at the cavities here, that is where the toxins come from that fuddle him.” But Hans Castorp’s attention was taken up by something like a bag, a strange, animal shape, darkly visible behind the middle column, or more on the right side of it—the spectator’s right. It expanded and contracted regularly, a little after the fashion of a swimming jelly-fish.","“Sharp picture,” the director said. “That’s the respectable leanness of military youth. I’ve had potbellies here—impenetrable, could recognize next to nothing. They still haven’t invented rays that can get through layers of fat like those. But this is clean work. Do you see the diaphragm?” he asked, and pointed a finger at a dark curve rising and sinking inside the window. “You see this knob here, this little raised spot? That’s from when he had pleurisy at the age of fifteen. Take a deep breath!” he commanded. “Deeper! I said deep!” And Joachim’s diaphragm quivered and rose as high as it would go. The upper parts of the lungs were brighter now, but the director was still not content. “Unsatisfactory,” he said. “Do you see the hilum there? Do you see those adhesions? Do you see these cavities here? That’s where the toxins come from that make him so tipsy.” But Hans Castorp was preoccupied with something that looked like a sack, or maybe a deformed animal, visible behind the middle column, or mostly to the right of it from the viewer’s perspective. It expanded and contracted regularly, like some sort of flapping jellyfish."
"»Was treibt er? Seelenzergliederung? Das ist ja widerlich!« rief Hans Castorp, und nun nahm seine Heiterkeit überhand. Er war ihrer gar nicht mehr Herr, nach allem andern hatte die Seelenzergliederung es ihm vollends angetan, und er lachte so {21}sehr, daß die Tränen ihm unter der Hand hervorliefen, mit der er, sich vorbeugend, die Augen bedeckte. Joachim lachte ebenfalls herzlich – es schien ihm wohlzutun –, und so kam es, daß die jungen Leute in großer Aufgeräumtheit aus ihrem Wagen stiegen, der sie zuletzt im Schritt, auf steiler, schleifenförmiger Anfahrt vor das Portal des Internationalen Sanatoriums Berghof getragen hatte.","""What's he up to? soul dismemberment? That's disgusting!' exclaimed Hans Castorp, and now his cheerfulness got the better of him. He was no longer her master, after all else the dismemberment of his soul had completely fascinated him, and he laughed so hard that tears ran out from under the hand with which he covered his eyes as he leaned forward. Joachim laughed heartily too – it seemed to do him good – and so it was that the young people got out of their car in great good spirits.","“He what? Psycho-analyses —how disgusting!” cried Hans Castorp; and now his hilarity altogether got the better of him. He could not stop. The psycho-analysis had been the finishing touch. He laughed so hard that the tears ran down his cheeks; he put up his hands to his face and rocked with laughter. Joachim laughed just as heartily—it seemed to do him good; and thus, in great good spirits, the young people climbed out of the wagon, which had slowly mounted the steep, winding drive and deposited them before the portal of the International Sanatorium Berghof.","“He what? Dissects their psyches? That’s disgusting!” Hans Castorp cried, and now hilarity got the better of him. He could no longer control it. Psychic dissection had finished the job, and he bent over and laughed so hard that the tears ran out from under the hand with which he had covered his eyes. Joachim laughed heartily, too—it seemed to do him good. And so the two young men were in fine good humor as they climbed down from their carriage, which had borne them at a slow trot up the steep loop of the driveway to the portal of the International Sanatorium Berghof."

"Sein täglich Geschäft war, Joachim zu trösten, namentlich darüber, daß dieser das große Kriegsspiel hier oben versäumen mußte, das in diesen Augusttagen begann, – denn das verwand er nicht und äußerte geradezu Selbstverachtung der gottverfluchten Schlappheit wegen, der er im letzten Augenblick unterlegen war.","It was his daily business to comfort Joachim, especially that he had to miss the great war game up here that began in those August days - for he didn't make up for it and downright expressed self-contempt for the goddamn slackness to which he had succumbed at the last moment .","It became his daily task to console his cousin for the disappointment of missing the manœuvres, which were beginning in these August days. Joachim could think of nothing else, and expressed the greatest self-contempt at this cursed slackness that had come over him in the last minute.","It was his daily chore to console Joachim, especially for his having to be here and miss the grand war games that had begun in early August—because he could not get over that, expressed out-and-out self-contempt for being so damned weak-willed, for having succumbed at the last moment."
"Die Atmosphäre der großen Meerstadt, diese feuchte Atmosphäre aus Weltkrämertum und Wohlleben, die seiner Väter Lebensluft gewesen war, er atmete sie mit tiefem Einverständnis, mit Selbstverständlichkeit und gutem Behagen. Die Ausdünstungen von Wasser, Kohlen und Teer, die scharfen Gerüche gehäufter Kolonialwaren in der Nase, sah er an den Hafenkais ungeheure Dampfdrehkrane die Ruhe, Intelligenz und {51}Riesenkraft dienender Elefanten nachahmen, indem sie Tonnengewichte von Säcken, Ballen, Kisten, Fässern und Ballons aus den Bäuchen ruhender Seeschiffe in Eisenbahnwagen und Schuppen löschten. Er sah die Kaufmannschaft in gelben Gummimänteln, wie er selbst einen trug, um Mittag zur Börse strömen, woselbst es scharf herging, seines Wissens, und jemand ganz leicht Veranlassung bekommen konnte, in aller Eile Einladungen zu einem großen Diner zu verschicken, um seinen Kredit zu fristen. Er sah (und hier lag ja später sein besonderes Interessengebiet) das Gewimmel der Werften, sah die Mammutleiber gedockter Asien- und Afrikafahrer, turmhoch, Kiel und Propeller entblößt, von baumdicken Streben gestützt, in ihrer monströsen Unbehilflichkeit auf dem Trockenen, bedeckt mit zwerghaften Heeren scheuernder, hämmernder, tünchender Arbeiter; sah auf den überdachten Hellings, von rauchigem Nebel umsponnen, die Spantenskelette entstehender Schiffe ragen und Ingenieure, Konstruktionszeichnung und Lenztafel zur Hand, den Bauleuten ihre Weisungen geben, – vertraute Gesichte dies alles für Hans Castorp von Jugend auf und lauter Empfindungen gemütlich-heimatlicher Zugehörigkeit in ihm erweckend, Empfindungen, die ihren Höhepunkt etwa in jener Lebenslage fanden, wenn er Sonntagvormittags mit James Tienappel oder seinem Vetter Ziemßen – Joachim Ziemßen – im Alsterpavillon warme Rundstücke mit Rauchfleisch nebst einem Glase alten Portweins frühstückte, und sich danach, mit Hingebung an seiner Zigarre ziehend, im Stuhle zurücklehnte. Denn namentlich darin war er echt, daß er gern gut lebte, ja, seines dünnblütig verfeinerten Äußern ungeachtet, innig und fest, wie ein schwelgerischer Säugling an der Mutterbrust, an des Lebens derben Genüssen hing.","The atmosphere of the great seaside city, that damp atmosphere of world mongering and living well, which had been the air of his father's life, he breathed it with deep agreement, with matter-of-factness and good contentment. The vapors of water, coal and tar, the pungent smells of heaped colonial goods in his nose, he saw on the harbor quays enormous rotary steam cranes imitating the calmness, intelligence and {51}giant power of serving elephants by lifting tons of sacks, bales, crates, barrels and Putting out balloons from the bellies of seagoing vessels at rest in railway carriages and sheds. He saw the merchants in yellow rubber coats, like himself wearing one, flocking to the Bourse at midday, where things were hot, to his knowledge, and one could very easily be roused to hurriedly sending out invitations to a big dinner to redeem his credit to expire. He saw (and this was later his special area of interest) the swarming of shipyards, saw the mammoth bodies of docked Asia and Africa ships, towering high, keel and propeller bare, supported by struts thick as trees, in their monstrous helplessness on dry land, covered with dwarf armies scrubbing, hammering, whitewashing laborer; on the roofed slipways, spun around by a smoky fog, saw the frame skeletons of ships being built and engineers, construction drawings and drainage boards at hand, giving the builders their instructions - familiar faces to Hans Castorp from his youth and pure feelings of a comfortable, homely feeling awakened feelings that reached their climax in that situation in life when he had breakfast with James Tienappel or his cousin Ziemßen – Joachim Ziemßen – in the Alster Pavilion on Sunday mornings, with warm round pieces of smoked meat and a glass of old port wine, and then, with devotion, with his cigar pulling, leaning back in the chair. For he was particularly genuine in that he liked to live well, yes, regardless of his thin-blooded, refined appearance, dearly and firmly, like a voluptuous infant at its mother's breast, clinging to life's coarse pleasures.","Yes, he was thoroughly in his element in the atmosphere of this great seaboard city: this reeking air, compact of good living and a retail trade that embraced the four corners of the earth. It had been the breath of his father’s nostrils, and the son drew it in with profound acquiescence and a sense of well-being. The exhalations from water, coals, and tar, the sharp tang in the nostrils from heaped-up stacks of colonial produce; the huge steam-cranes at the dock-side, imitating the quiet, the intelligence, and the giant strength of elephants at work, as they hoisted tons of sacks, bales, chests, vats, and carboys out of the bowels of seagoing ships and conveyed them into waiting trains and scales; the business men, in yellow rubber coats like his own, streaming to the Bourse at midday, where, as he knew, there was oftentimes pretty sharp work, and a man might have to strengthen his credit at short notice by giving out invitations to a big dinner— all this he felt, saw, heard, knew. Besides it all, there was the field in which later was to lie his own particular interest: the confusion of the yards, the mammoth bodies of great ships, Asiatic and African liners, lying in dry-dock, keel and propeller bare, supported by props as thick as tree-trunks, lying there in monstrous helplessness, swarmed over by troops of men like dwarfs, scouring, whitewashing, hammering; there were the roofed-over ways, wrapped in wreaths of smoke-like mist, holding the towering frames of rising ships, among which moved the engineers, blueprint and loading scale in hand, directing the work-people. All these were familiar sights to Hans Castorp from his youth upwards, awaking in him only the agreeable, homely sensations of “belonging,” which were the prerogative of his years. Such sensations would reach their height when he sat of a Sunday forenoon with James Tienappel or his cousin Ziemssen—Joachim Ziemssen—in the pavilion at Alster, breakfasting on hot cuts and smoked meat, with a glass of old port; or when, having eaten, he would lean back in his chair and give himself up to his cigar. For therein especially was he true to type, that he liked good living, and notwithstanding his thinbloodedness and look of over-refinement clung to the grosser pleasures of life as a greedy suckling to its mother’s breast.","The atmosphere of the metropolitan seaport, the damp atmosphere of global shopkeeping and prosperity, had been the air of life itself for his forefathers, and with great gusto he breathed it now as a matter of course and found it profoundly satisfying. His nose took in the fumes of the harbor, of coal and tar, the pungent odors of the world’s produce piled high, and his eyes watched the huge steam cranes on the docks—so calm, wise, and monumentally strong that they looked like hardworking elephants—as they transferred tons of sacks, bales, crates, barrels, and carboys from the bowels of idle seagoing vessels to railroad cars and sheds. He watched the merchants in yellow mackintoshes, like the one he himself was wearing, as they streamed at noon toward the exchange, where things could get quite fierce, as he well knew, and someone might very suddenly be motivated to hand out invitations to a grand dinner, in hopes of prolonging his credit. He watched—and this would later prove to be his special area of interest—the teeming dry docks, the towering, mammoth cadavers of ships that had sailed to Asia and Africa, but now lay braced on strutbeams thick as trees, looking monstrous and clumsy on dry land, their keels and screws naked, swarmed over by hosts of midget laborers—hammering, scouring, whitewashing. He gazed at the roofed-over slips, which were wrapped in webs of smoky fog and from which the ribs of ships under construction protruded, while engineers, blueprints and pump-charts in hand, gave orders to the workers. From boyhood on, these were all familiar sights to Hans Castorp, awakening in him a warm sense of belonging, a feeling that reached its zenith, perhaps, on those occasions when he would join James Tienappel or his cousin Ziemssen—Joachim Ziemssen—in the pavilion on the Alster for a Sunday breakfast of warm rolls and smoked beef, washed down by a glass of old port, then lean back in his chair and puff devotedly on his cigar. For in this he was true to type: that he dearly and truly loved living well, and despite his thin-blooded, refined appearance, he clung to the cruder pleasures of life as a gluttonous baby clings to its mother’s breast."
"Diese Kunde ergriff Hans Castorp noch mehr als die vorige. Er machte fortan viele verzerrte Späße darüber. Nun, gewiß, es sei ja bekannt, daß der Hofrat in Öl male, – was die Lehrerin denn wolle, das sei nicht verboten, und so stehe es jedermann frei. In des Hofrats Witwerheim also? Hoffentlich sei wenigstens Fräulein von Mylendonk bei den Sitzungen anwesend. – Die habe wohl keine Zeit. – »Mehr Zeit als die Oberin sollte auch Behrens nicht haben«, sagte Hans Castorp streng. Aber obgleich damit etwas Endgültiges über die Sache gesagt schien, war er weit entfernt, sie fallen zu lassen, sondern erschöpfte sich in Fragen nach Näherem und Weiterem: über das Bild, sein Format und ob es ein Kopf- oder Kniestück sei; auch über die Stunde der Sitzungen, – während doch Fräulein Engelhart mit Einzelheiten auch hier nicht dienen konnte und ihn auf die Ergebnisse weiterer Nachforschungen vertrösten mußte.","This news affected Hans Castorp even more than the previous one. From then on he made many distorted jokes about it. Well, of course, it was well known that the privy councilor painted in oils - whatever the teacher wanted was not forbidden, and so everyone was free to do so. So in the Hofrat's widower's home? I hope at least Fraulein von Mylendonk will be present at the meetings. - They probably don't have time. ""Even Behrens shouldn't have more time than the matron,"" said Hans Castorp sternly. But while that seemed to say something definitive about the matter, far from dismissing it, he exhausted himself with questions about the nearer and farther: about the picture, its format, and whether it was a headpiece or a kneepiece; also about the hour of the sessions – while Fraulein Engelhart could not help with details here either and had to console him with the results of further investigations.","This intelligence affected Hans Castorp even more than the other. He made several forced jokes about it. Why, certainly, the Hofrat was known to occupy himself with oil-painting. Why not? It wasn’t a crime, anybody was free to paint. And the sittings took place in the widower’s own house—he hoped, at least, that Fräulein von Mylendonk was present! The schoolmistress objected that the Directress was probably too busy. No busier than the doctor ought to be, Hans Castorp severely rejoined. The remark sounded final; but he was far from letting the subject drop. He exhausted himself in questions: about the picture, what size it was, and whether it was a head or a knee-length; about the hours of the sitting—but Fräulein Engelhart could not gratify him with these particulars, and had to put him off until she could make further inquiry.","This announcement affected Hans Castorp even more than her previous news. He now tried making several forced jokes about it. Well, of course, it was well known that the director did oils—what did the teacher want, it wasn’t forbidden, everyone was free to do so. And in the director’s own widower’s apartments, had she said? Well, he hoped that at least Fräulein von Mylendonk was present for the sittings. “But she doesn’t have the time.” “Surely Behrens doesn’t have more time than our head nurse,” Hans Castorp replied sternly. But although that seemed to be his final remark at first, he was not at all prepared to let the subject drop and almost exhausted himself asking questions about every conceivable detail: about the picture itself—its size and whether it was just a head or a seated portrait—about the hours when the sittings were held. Fräulein Engelhart, however, could not satisfy him about these matters, either, and had to put him off with assurances that she would make further inquiries."

"{789}Er gab das Wort noch nicht her, er schwang es, er ließ es triumphieren. Er warf sich zum Schützer auf des literarischen Genius, feierte die Geschichte des Schrifttums von dem Augenblick an, wo zum erstenmal ein Mensch, um seinem Wissen und Fühlen Denkmalsdauer zu geben, Wortezeichen in einen Stein gegraben hatte. Er sprach von dem ägyptischen Gotte Thot, mit dem der dreimalgroße Hermes des Hellenismus identisch gewesen, und der als Erfinder der Schrift, Schutzherr der Bibliotheken und Anreger aller geistigen Bestrebungen verehrt worden war. Er beugte redend das Knie vor diesem Trismegist, dem humanistischen Hermes, dem Meister der Palästra, dem die Menschheit das Hochgeschenk des literarischen Wortes, der agonalen Rhetorik verdankte, und veranlaßte so Hans Castorp zu der Anmerkung: dann sei dieser gebürtige Ägypter offenbar auch ein Politiker gewesen und habe in größerem Stile dieselbe Rolle gespielt wie Herr Brunetto Latini, der speziell den Florentinern Schliff verliehen und sie das Sprechen gelehrt, sowie die Kunst, ihre Republik nach den Regeln der Politik zu lenken, – worauf Naphta erwiderte, Herr Settembrini schwindle ein bißchen und habe ihm von Thot-Trismegistos ein allzu gelecktes Bild gegeben. Denn das sei vielmehr eine Affen-, Mond- und Seelengottheit gewesen, ein Pavian mit einer Mondsichel auf dem Kopf und unter dem Namen des Hermes vor allem ein Todes- und Totengott: der Seelenzwinger und Seelenführer, der schon der späteren Antike zum Erzzauberer und dem kabbalistischen Mittelalter zum Vater der hermetischen Alchimie geworden sei.","{789}He didn't give up the word yet, he swung it, he let it triumph. He threw himself on the protector of literary genius, celebrated the history of writing from the moment when for the first time a human being, in order to give his knowledge and feelings a lasting monument, dug words into a stone. He spoke of the Egyptian god Thoth, with whom the thrice-great Hermes of Hellenism was identical, and who was revered as the inventor of writing, the protector of libraries, and the inspirer of all intellectual endeavors. Speaking, he bowed his knee before this trismegist, the humanistic Hermes, the master of the palaestra, to whom mankind owed the gift of the literary word, the agonal rhetoric, and thus prompted Hans Castorp to comment: then this native Egyptian was obviously also a politician and have played, on a larger scale, the same part as M. Brunetto Latini, who specially honed the Florentines, and taught them to speak, and the art of governing their republic by the rules of politics--to which Naphta replied that M. Settembrini was cheating a little and gave him a too licked picture of Thoth-Trismegistos. Because that was rather a monkey, moon and soul deity, a baboon with a crescent moon on his head and above all a god of death and death under the name of Hermes: the soul breeder and soul guide, who in later antiquity became the arch magician and the Kabbalistic Middle Ages became the father of Hermetic alchemy.","The Italian would not give over; he brandished the word, he made it prevail. He threw himself into the fray as the defender of literary genius, celebrated the history of the written word, from the moment when man, yearning to give permanency to his knowledge or emotions, engraved word-symbols upon stone. He spoke of the Egyptian god Thoth, identical with the thrice-renowned Hermes of Hellenism; who was honoured as the inventor of writing, protector of libraries, and inciter to all literary efforts. He bent the knee metaphorically before that Trismegistus, the humanistic Hermes, master of the palæstra, to whom humanity owed the great gift of the literary word and agonistic rhetoric—which incited Hans Castorp to the remark that this Egyptian person had apparently been a politician, playing in the grand style the same rôle as that Herr Brunetto Latini who had sharpened the wits of the Florentines, taught them the art of language and how to guide their State according to the rules of politics. Naphta put in that Herr Settembrini was slightly disingenuous: his picture of Thoth-Trismegistus had a good deal of the reality smoothed away. He had been, in fact, an ape, moon and soul deity, a peacock with a crescent moon on his head, and in his Hermes aspect, a god of death and of the dead, a soul-compeller and tutelary soul-guide, of whom late antiquity made an arch-enchanter, and the cabalistic Middle Ages the Father of hermetic alchemy.","The Italian would not yield, but brandished the Word like a sword, triumphed with it. He rose up to defend literary genius, celebrated the history of literature from the first moment when man chiseled symbols into stone as a monument to his knowledge and emotion. He spoke of the Egyptian god Thoth, identical with the Hellenistic god Hermes the Thrice Great, and worshiped as the inventor of writing, the patron of libraries, the inspiration for all intellectual endeavor. He bent a metaphorical knee before Hermes Trismegistos, the humanistic Hermes, the master of the palaestra, whom mankind could thank for the sublime gift of the literary word, of agonistic rhetoric. All of which roused Hans Castorp to remark that this Egyptian must have been a politician as well, playing on a grander scale the same role as Signor Brunetto Latini, who had given the Florentines their polish and taught them how to speak and the fine art of guiding their republic by the rules of politics. To which Naphta responded that Herr Settembrini was cheating a little and had given his Thoth Trismegistos all too sleek an image. For he had been a monkey, moon, and soul god—a baboon with a crescent moon above his head and above all, under the name of Hermes, a god of death and the dead, a grabber and guide of souls, who by late antiquity had become a great sorcerer and served the cabalistic Middle Ages as the father of hermetic alchemy."
"»Herr Albin, Herr Albin, tun Sie es nicht!« zeterten mehrere Stimmen. Aber Herr Albin kam schon aus der Liegehalle hervor, um auf sein Zimmer zu gehen, – blutjung und schlenkricht, mit rosigem Kindergesicht und kleinen Backenbartstreifen neben den Ohren.","""Mr. Albin, Mr. Albin, don't do it!"" yelled several voices. But Herr Albin was already coming out of the lounge to go to his room - very young and limber, with a rosy child's face and little whiskers next to his ears.","“No, no, don’t, pray don’t, Herr Albin!” in a loud outcry from many voices. But Herr Albin had already come out to go up to his room: very young and lanky, with a rosy, childish face, and little strips of side-whisker close to his ears.","“No, Herr Albin, don’t. Herr Albin, don’t do it!” several different voices wailed. But Herr Albin was already emerging from the arcade, heading for his room—very young, with a shambling gait, a rosy childlike face, and narrow sideburns at his ears."
"Joachim hatte ohne weiteres begonnen, seinen Oberkörper freizumachen. Der Gehilfe, ein jüngerer, gedrungener und rotbäckiger Eingeborener in weißem Kittel, wies Hans Castorp an, ein gleiches zu tun. Es gehe schnell, er sei sofort an der Reihe … Während Hans Castorp die Weste auszog, kam Behrens aus dem kleinen Abteil, wo er gestanden, in den geräumigeren herüber.","Joachim had immediately begun to free his upper body. The assistant, a young, stocky, red-cheeked native in a white coat, instructed Hans Castorp to do the same. It's going fast, it's his turn immediately... While Hans Castorp was taking off his waistcoat, Behrens came over from the small compartment where he was standing to the more spacious one.","Joachim had begun, without more ado, to lay bare the upper half of his body. The helper, a square-built, rosy-cheeked young native in a white smock, motioned Hans Castorp to do the same. It went fast, and he was next in turn. As Hans Castorp took off his waistcoat, Behrens came out of the smaller recess where he had been standing into the larger one.","Joachim began without further ado to strip to the waist. The assistant, a younger, squat, red-cheeked local in a white smock, instructed Hans Castorp to do the same—it would go fast, it would soon be his turn. While Hans Castorp was removing his vest, Behrens stepped out of the smaller recess and joined them in the larger part of the room."
"»Da machen Sie Augen«, fuhr er nach einer Kunstpause fort, obgleich Hans Castorp keinerlei Augen machte, sondern ihn ziemlich schläfrig und zerstreut betrachtete, »und haben keine Ahnung, wie der alte Behrens es meinen könnte. Ich meine es aber so. Mit Ihnen stimmt etwas nicht, Castorp, das wird Ihrer werten Apperzeption ja nicht entgangen sein. Es stimmt insofern nicht, als Ihre Vergiftungserscheinungen sich schon seit längerem auf den zweifellos sehr gebesserten lokalen Zustand nicht mehr recht reimen lassen – ich meditiere nicht erst seit gestern darüber. Wir haben hier Ihr neuestes Photo … halten wir den Zauber mal gegen das Licht. Sie sehen, da findet der ärgste Nörgler und Schwarzseher, wie unser kaiserlicher Herr immer sagt, nicht allzuviel mehr zu erinnern. Ein paar Herde sind ganz resorbiert, das Nest ist kleiner geworden und schärfer umgrenzt, was, wie Sie gelehrterweise wissen, auf Heilung deutet. Aus diesem Befund ist die Unsolidität Ihres Wärmehaushalts nicht recht zu erklären, Mann; der Arzt sieht sich in die Notwendigkeit versetzt, nach neuen Ursachen zu fahnden.«","'There you are,' he continued after an artificial pause, although Hans Castorp didn't make any eyes at all, but rather looked at him rather sleepily and absent-mindedly, 'and have no idea how old Behrens could mean it. I mean it. There's something wrong with you, Castorp, your esteemed apperception can't have failed to notice that. It's not true insofar as your symptoms of poisoning have not been able to be rhymed with the undoubtedly much improved local condition for a long time - I haven't just been meditating on it since yesterday. Here's your latest photo...let's hold the magic up to the light. You see, even the worst complainer and naysayer, as our imperial lord always says, doesn't find much more to remember. A few foci have completely resorbed, the nest has become smaller and more defined which, as you scholarly know, indicates healing. This finding doesn't really explain the lack of stability in your heat balance, man; the doctor finds it necessary to search for new causes.«","“Yes,” he went on, after a pause for effect, “you may well open your eyes”—Hans Castorp had done nothing of the sort, merely blinked at him rather sleepy and distraught—“of course you haven’t an idea how old Behrens can say such a thing. Well, it’s like this: it cannot have escaped your acute apperceptions that there is something about your case that doesn’t hold water. The symptoms of infection have not for a long time corresponded to the local condition, which is undoubtedly very much improved. It’s not only since yesterday that I’ve been thinking about it. Here is your latest photo, take it and hold it up to the light. See there! The sheerest pessimist and cavillar—as the Kaiser says—could not see very much in it to find fault with. Some of the foci are absorbed, the area is smaller and more clearly defined, which you are experienced enough to know is a sign of healing. Nothing here to explain the unreliability of your domestic heater, my man. The doctor finds himself under the necessity of casting about for another cause.”","“My, what big eyes you have,” he continued after a brief rhetorical pause, although Hans Castorp’s eyes had not widened at all, but simply gazed at the director rather drowsily and absentmindedly, “and haven’t the vaguest what old man Behrens might mean. I mean this: something’s not quite right about your case, Castorp, that can’t have escaped your keen powers of observation, either. Something’s not quite right, because for some time now your symptoms of toxification have not squared with the undeniable improvement in your localized condition—and I didn’t start meditating on that just yesterday, either. We have here your latest photo. Let us hold the wizardry up to the light. You see, even the worst grouser and crepehanger, as His Imperial Majesty likes to say, won’t find much to object to there. A few foci have been fully reabsorbed, the pocket has grown smaller and is more sharply defined, which, being a well-informed patient, you know indicates healing. On the strength of these findings, then, one can come up with no real explanation for the waywardness of your body temperature. The physician sees himself compelled to explore new causes.”"

Welch ein Anblick!«","{99}""Plastic, isn't it?"" replied the Italian, fanning himself with his handkerchief, although it was rather chilly. 'That will be the word you are looking for. I have a plastic way of speaking, you mean. But stop!' he shouted. ""What do I see! There walk our hell judges! What a sight!'","“Plastic?” responded the Italian, and fanned himself with his handkerchief, though it was far from warm. “That is probably the word you seek. You mean I have a plastic way of speaking. But look!” he cried, “what do my eyes behold? The judges of our infernal regions! What a sight!”","“Graphic, perhaps?” the Italian responded, fanning himself with his handkerchief, although the air was actually rather cool. “That would be the word you’re looking for. I have a graphic way of speaking, is what you want to say. But wait,” he cried, “what do I see? Behold the judges of the dead out for a stroll! What a sight!”"

"»Herr Naphta,« sagte Hans Castorp nach einem Aufseufzen, »mich interessiert jedes Wort von dem, was Sie da hervorheben. ›Signum mortificationis‹ sagten Sie? Das werde ich mir merken. Vorher sagten Sie etwas von ›anonym und gemeinsam‹, was auch der Mühe wert scheint, darüber nachzudenken. Sie vermuten leider richtig, daß ich die Schrift des Papstes – ich nehme an, daß Innozenz der Dritte ein Papst war – nicht kenne. Habe ich richtig verstanden, daß sie asketisch und witzig ist? Ich muß gestehen, ich habe mir nie vorgestellt, daß das so Hand in Hand gehen könnte, aber wenn ich es ins Auge fasse, so leuchtet es mir ein, natürlich, eine Abhandlung über das menschliche Elend bietet zum Witz schon Gelegenheit, auf Kosten des Flei{595}sches. Ist die Schrift denn erhältlich? Wenn ich mein Latein zusammennähme, vielleicht könnte ich sie lesen.«","'Mr Naphta,' said Hans Castorp after a sigh, 'every word of what you're saying interests me. 'Signum mortificationis' did you say? I'll remember that. Earlier you said something about 'anonymous and together', which also seems worth considering. Unfortunately, you are right in assuming that I do not know the writings of the pope - I assume that Innocent III was a pope. Did I understand correctly that she is austere and witty? I must confess I never imagined that the two could go hand in hand in this way, but when I consider it, it makes sense to me, of course, that a treatise on human misery affords the opportunity for a joke, at the expense of Meat{595}ches. Is the font available? If I could get my Latin together maybe I could read them.'","Hans Castorp heaved a deep sigh. “Herr Naphta,“ he said, “every word you say interests me enormously. ‘ Signum mortificationis’— is that right? I’ll remember it. ‘Anonymous and communal’—and that will take some thinking about too. You are quite right in assuming I don’t know the work of that pope —I take it Innocent III was a pope? Did I understand you to say it is witty and ascetic? I must confess I should never have thought the two things went hand in hand; but when I put my mind to it, of course it is obvious that a discourse on human misery gives one a good chance to poke fun at the things of the flesh. Is the work obtainable? Perhaps if I got up my Latin I could read it.”","“Herr Naphta,” Hans Castorp said, heaving a sigh, “every word of everything you’ve said interests me. ‘ Signum mortificationis,’ was that it? I shall make a note of it. And just before that you mentioned ‘anonymous and communal,’ which also appears worth some serious thought. Sad to say, you guessed correctly about my not knowing the writings of that pope—I assume Innocent the Third was a pope. Did I understand you to say that the work is ascetic and witty? I must admit I’ve never thought those two things could go hand in hand, but now that I consider it, it seems quite plausible—any discussion of human misery would offer a chance for witty remarks at the expense of the flesh. Is the work to be had somewhere? If I brush up on my Latin perhaps I can read it.”"
"Hier begehrte Anton Karlowitsch Ferge auf und verteidigte den Pleurachok gegen Verunglimpfungen und Despektierlichkeiten. Wie, was, zu ernst genommen sein Pleurachok? Da danke er, und da müsse er bitten! Sein großer Kehlkopf und sein gutmütiger Schnurrbart wanderten auf und nieder, und er verbat sich jede Mißachtung dessen, was er damals durchgemacht. Er sei nur ein einfacher Mann, ein Versicherungsreisender, und alles Höhere liege ihm fern, – schon dieses Gespräch gehe weit über seinen Horizont. Aber wenn Herr Settembrini etwa zum Beispiel auch den Pleurachok mit einbeziehen wolle in das, was er gesagt habe, – diese Kitzelhölle mit dem Schwefelgestank und den drei farbigen Ohnmachten, – dann müsse er schon bitten und danke ergebenst. Denn da sei von Herabminderungen und Gnadennarkosen und Phantasiefehlern auch nicht eine Spur die Rede gewesen, sondern das sei die größte und krasseste Hundsfötterei unter der Sonne, und wer es nicht erfahren habe, wie er, der könne sich von solcher Gemeinheit überhaupt keine –","Here Anton Karlovich Ferge rebelled and defended the pleurachok against slander and disparagement. Like, what, being taken too seriously Pleurachok? Then he thanks, and then he must ask! His large larynx and good-natured mustache wandered up and down, and he forbade any disregard for what he was going through at the time. He was just a simple man, an insured traveler, and anything higher was far from him - even this conversation went far beyond his horizon. But if Herr Settembrini wanted to include the Pleurachok in what he said, for example - this tickling hell with the sulfur stench and the three colored faints - then he would have to ask and thank you sincerely. Because there was not even a trace of belittlement and mercy anesthetics and imaginary errors, but that was the biggest and most crass dog teasing under the sun, and anyone who has not experienced it, like him, can not get rid of such meanness at all -","At this point Anton Karlowitsch Ferge girded his loins to remonstrate—he defended the pleura-shock against sneers and contumely.

His great Adam’s apple and his good-natured moustaches worked up and down as he repudiated any lack of respect for the sufferings he had undergone. He was just a plain man, an insurance agent, with no high-falutin ideas; even the present conversation soared far above his head. But if Herr Settembrini meant to suggest that the pleura-shock was a good example of what he was talking about—that torture by tickling, with its stench of sulphur and its three-coloured fainting fit— well, really he was very much obliged to Herr Settembrini , he really must thank him very kindly indeed; but there had been nothing of the sort about the pleura-shock—not it! Talk about adjustments and “merciful narcosis”—why, it had been the most sickening piece of business under the shining sun, and nobody who had not been through it could have the least idea—","At this, Anon Karlovitch Ferge flared up to defend his pleural shock against such sneers and slanders. What—taken his pleural shock too seriously? Well, thanks very much, but beg your pardon! His large Adam’s apple and his good-natured moustache bobbed up and down, and he demanded some respect be shown for what he had gone through. He was just an ordinary man, a traveling insurance agent, and higher things were utterly foreign to him—this conversation, in fact, was far beyond him. But if Herr Settembrini presumed to include pleural shock, for example, in what he had said—that ticklish hell with its sulfur stench and faints in three colors—then all he could say was thanks very, very much, but beg your pardon. There had not been a trace of diminished senses or merciful self-narcosis or failures of imagination, but only the biggest, crudest piece of filth on God’s green earth, and anyone who had not undergone that beastly experience as he had could not even begin to—"
"Hiervon war Hans Castorp nun peinlich berührt, besonders da die Majorin das Wort »Flirt« obendrein nicht richtig, das heißt nicht englisch, sondern mit deutschem i ausgesprochen hatte, was ihn maßlos irritierte. Auch war er kein stattlicher Kavalier, sondern hatte die kleine Leila aus Protest gegen den herrschenden Egoismus und in medizinisch-geistlicher Meinung besucht. Kurz, er war etwas verstimmt über den letzten Ausgang der Sache, soweit die Auffassung der Majorin in Frage kam, sonst aber sehr belebt und angetan von der Durchführung des Unternehmens. Namentlich zwei Eindrücke: die erdigen Düfte des Blumenladens und die Nässe von Leilas Händchen waren ihm davon in Seele und Sinn zurückgeblieben. Und da ein Anfang gemacht war, verabredete er noch gleichen Tages mit Schwester Alfreda einen Besuch bei ihrem Pflegling Fritz Rotbein, der sich nebst seiner Pflegerin so schrecklich langweilte, obgleich ihm, wenn nicht alle Zeichen trogen, nur noch eine ganz kurze Weile beschieden war.","Hans Castorp was now embarrassed by this, especially since the majoress hadn't pronounced the word ""flirt"" correctly, that is, not in English but with a German i, which irritated him immensely. Nor was he a stately cavalier, but had visited little Leila as a protest against the prevailing egoism and in a medical-spiritual opinion. In short, he was somewhat upset about the final outcome, as far as the Major's opinion was concerned, but otherwise very animated and pleased with the conduct of the undertaking. Two impressions in particular: the earthy scents of the flower shop and the wetness of Leila's little hands had stayed with him in soul and mind. And since a start had been made, on the same day he arranged with Sister Alfreda to visit her fosterling Fritz Rotbein, who was so terribly bored along with his nurse, although, unless all signs were deceptive, he was only granted a very short while.","All this impressed Hans Castorp rather painfully— and she had pronounced the French badly too, which irritated him beyond words. He was no fine cavalier, he had visited little Leila only as a protest against the ruling spirit of egotism in the place, and in a physicianly and priestly capacity. He was rather put out over the turn the affair had taken, and the interpretation the mother had put upon it. But on the other hand, he felt a lively pleasure at having actually carried out his undertaking. Two impressions in particular lingered from the enterprise: one, the earthy odours of the flower-shop; the other, Leila’s wet little hand—they had sunk into his mind and soul. And as thus a beginning had been made, he arranged on the same day with Alfreda Schildknecht a visit to her patient, Fritz Rotbein, who was as bored with life as his nurse, though to him, unless all signs failed, only a short term still remained.","Hans Castorp was embarrassed by this last remark, particularly by the word “flirt,” which Frau Gerngross pronounced incorrectly, supplying it with a German vowel so that it sounded like “fleert”—that annoyed him no end. Nor was he a handsome cavalier, but had visited little Leila out of medical and spiritual conviction, as a protest against the prevailing egotism of the place. In brief, he was a little disgruntled by the turn things had taken, or at least by what the major’s wife had to say, but otherwise very excited and pleased at having carried out his plan. Two things in particular lingered in his mind and heart: the earthy odor of the flower shop and Leila’s wet hand. And now that a beginning had been made, he arranged an appointment that very day with Sister Alfreda to visit her patient, Fritz Rotbein, who like his nurse was terribly bored, even though, to judge by all the evidence, he had only a short time left."
»Zwiespalt?« wiederholte Hans Castorp und legte …,"""Disturbance?"" repeated Hans Castorp and laid ...","“Wound?” echoed Hans Castorp, laying afresh.","Hans Castorp repeated, and laid out his cards."
"Mochte Naphta diese Dinge vorgebracht haben, weil er daran glaubte, oder weil er sie witzig fand, oder um seinem Zuhörer nach dem Munde zu reden, als ein Armer, der schmeicheln muß und wohl berechnet, wie er sich nützen, wie schaden kann: der Pater hatte sich um ihren Wahrheitswert weniger gekümmert, als um die allgemeine Gescheitheit, von der sie zeugten; das Gespräch hatte sich fortgesponnen, Leos persönliche Umstände waren dem Jesuiten bald bekannt gewesen, und die Begegnung hatte mit der Aufforderung Unterpertingers an Leo geschlossen, ihn im Pädagogium zu besuchen.","Naphta may have brought these things up because he believed them, or because he found them funny, or to speak after the mouth of his listener, as a poor man who has to flatter and calculates how useful and how harmful he can be: he Pater had cared less about their truth value than about the general cleverness to which they testified; The conversation had spun on, Leo's personal circumstances had soon become known to the Jesuit, and the meeting ended with Unterpertinger's request that Leo visit him in the pedagogical school.","Naphta may have said these things out of conviction, or because they were clever, or because, being a poor lad, he knew how adroit flattery could be made to serve his ends. The Father laid less stress on their intrinsic value than upon the general ability of which they gave evidence. Their talk had been prolonged, the Father soon possessed himself of the facts of Leo’s personal situation, and finished by inviting the youth to visit him at the school.","Naphta may have made these remarks because he believed them, or because he found them witty, or simply because as a poor man he wanted to flatter his hearer and was well aware of how to help and how to harm himself—but the priest was less interested in the truth of his statements than in the general cleverness they revealed. As the conversation unfolded, Leo’s personal situation became clear, and the meeting ended with Unterpertinger’s request that Leo visit him at his school."
"»– Erkältet habe. Solche Erkältungen sind uns schon öfter vorgekommen. Hier!« sagte sie und kramte wieder in ihrer Tasche, um zwei längliche Lederetuis zum Vorschein zu bringen, ein schwarzes und ein rotes, die sie ebenfalls auf den Tisch legte. »Dieser hier kostet drei Franken fünfzig und der hier fünf Franken. Besser fahren Sie natürlich mit dem zu fünf. Das ist etwas fürs Leben, wenn Sie ordentlich damit umgehen.«","»- Got a cold. We've had colds like this before. Here!' she said, rummaging in her bag again to bring out two oblong leather cases, one black and one red, which she also placed on the table. 'This one costs three francs fifty and this one five francs. Of course, it's better to drive with the five. It's for life if you handle it properly.""","“Cold. We’ve often seen such colds. Here, young ’un,” she said, and rummaged again in her bag. She brought out two longish leather cases, one red and one black, and put them on the table. “This one is three francs fifty, the other five. The five-franc one is better, of course. It will last you a lifetime if you take care of it.”","“Cold. We’ve seen colds like that here often enough. Here—” she said and rummaged in her bag again, pulling out two longish leather cases, one black, one red, which she also laid on the table now. “This one costs three francs fifty, and this one five francs. You’ll do better to take the one for five, of course. It will last a lifetime if you take proper care of it.”"
"Hans Castorp schwieg. »Ja,« sagte er leise nach einer Pause, »es ist so, ich hätte gut Arzt werden können. Der Brustmilchgang … Die Lymphe der Beine … Das interessiert mich sehr. – {403}Was ist der Körper!« rief er auf einmal stürmisch ausbrechend. »Was ist das Fleisch! Was ist der Leib des Menschen! Woraus besteht er! Sagen Sie uns das heute nachmittag, Herr Hofrat! Sagen Sie es uns ein für allemal und genau, damit wir es wissen!«","Hans Castorp said nothing. ""Yes,"" he said softly after a pause, ""it's like that, I could have become a doctor. The breast milk duct... The lymph in the legs... I'm very interested in that. - {403}What is the body!' he cried suddenly, breaking out stormily. “What is the meat! What is the body of man! What is it made of! Tell us this afternoon, Herr Hofrat! Tell us once and for all and exactly, so we know!""","Hans Castorp was silent a little space. “Yes,” he said, then, in a low voice, “it is true, I might very well have been a doctor. The flow of the breast milk—the lymph of the legs—all that interests me very, very much. What is the body?” he rhapsodically burst forth. “What is the flesh? What is the physical being of man? What is he made of? Tell us this afternoon, Herr Hofrat, tell us exactly, and once and for all, so that we may know!”","Hans Castorp said nothing. “Yes,” he remarked softly after a pause, “it’s true. I could easily have become a doctor. The formation of breast milk . . .the lymph of the legs—it all interests me very much. The body!” he suddenly cried in a rapturous outburst. “The flesh! The human body! What is it? What is it made of? Tell us now, this very afternoon, Director Behrens. Tell us, for once and for all, in precise terms, so that we may know.”"
"Er war fertig zum Ausgehen, sportlich gekleidet, in kräftig gearbeiteten Stiefeln, und trug über dem Arm seinen Ulster, in dessen Seitentasche sich die flache Flasche abzeichnete.

"Die Entrüstung der Amneris über diese pfäffische Härte mußte man sich nach Kräften selber einbilden, denn hier brach die Wiedergabe ab, Hans Castorp mußte die Platte wechseln, was er mit stillen und knappen Bewegungen, gleichsam mit niedergeschlagenen Augen, tat, und wenn er sich wieder zum Lauschen niedergelassen hatte, war es schon des Melodramas letzte Szene, die er vernahm: das Schlußduett des Radames und der Aida, gesungen auf dem Grunde ihres Kellergrabes, während über ihren Köpfen bigotte und grausame Priester im Tempel ihren Kult feierten, die Hände spreizten, sich in dumpfem Gemurmel ergingen … »Tu – in questa tomba?!« schmetterte die unbeschreiblich ansprechende, zugleich süße und heldenhafte Stimme des Radames entsetzt und entzückt … Ja, sie hatte sich zu ihm gefunden, die Geliebte, um derentwillen er Ehre und Leben verwirkt, sie hatte ihn hier erwartet, sich mit ihm einschließen lassen, um mit ihm zu sterben, und die Gesänge, die sie in dieser Sache, zuweilen unterbrochen von dem dumpfen Getön des Zeremoniells im oberen Stockwerk, miteinander tauschten, oder zu denen sie sich vereinigten, – sie waren es eigentlich, die es dem einsam-nächtlichen Zuhörer in tiefster Seele angetan hatten: in Hinsicht auf die Umstände sowohl, wie auf ihren musikalischen Ausdruck. Es war vom Himmel die Rede in diesen Gesängen, aber sie selbst waren himmlisch, und sie wurden himmlisch vorgetragen. Die melodische Linie, die Radames’ und Aidas Stimmen einzeln und dann in Vereinigung unersättlich nachzogen, diese einfache und selige, um Tonika und Dominante spielende Kurve, die {978}vom Grundton zu lang betontem Vorhalt, einen halben Ton vor der Oktave, aufstieg und nach flüchtiger Berührung mit dieser sich zur Quinte wandte, erschien dem Lauscher als das Verklärteste, Bewunderungswürdigste, was ihm je untergekommen. Doch wäre er in das Lautliche weniger verliebt gewesen, ohne die zum Grunde liegende Situation, die sein Gemüt für die daraus erwachsende Süße erst recht empfänglich machte. Es war so schön, daß Aida sich zu dem verlorenen Radames gefunden hatte, um sein Grabesschicksal mit ihm zu teilen in Ewigkeit! Mit Recht protestierte der Verurteilte gegen das Opfer so lieblichen Lebens, aber seinem zärtlich verzweifelten »No, no! troppo sei bella« war doch das Entzücken endgültiger Vereinigung mit derjenigen anzumerken, die er nie wiederzusehen gemeint hatte, und dieses Entzücken, diese Dankbarkeit ihm deutlich nachzufühlen, bedurfte es für Hans Castorp keines Aufgebotes an Einbildungskraft. Was er aber letztlich empfand, verstand und genoß, während er mit gefalteten Händen auf die schwarze kleine Jalousie blickte, zwischen deren Leisten dies alles hervorblühte, das war die siegende Idealität der Musik, der Kunst, des menschlichen Gemüts, die hohe und unwiderlegliche Beschönigung, die sie der gemeinen Gräßlichkeit der wirklichen Dinge angedeihen ließ. Man mußte sich nur vor Augen führen, was hier, nüchtern genommen, geschah! Zwei lebendig Begrabene würden, die Lungen voll Grubengas, hier miteinander, oder, noch schlimmer, einer nach dem anderen, an Hungerkrämpfen verenden, und dann würde an ihren Körpern die Verwesung ihr unaussprechliches Werk tun, bis zwei Gerippe unterm Gewölbe lagerten, deren jedem es völlig gleichgültig und unempfindlich sein würde, ob es allein oder zu zweien lagerte. Das war die reale und sachliche Seite der Dinge – eine Seite und Sache für sich, die vor dem Idealismus des Herzens überhaupt nicht in Betracht kam, vom Geiste der Schönheit und der Musik aufs Triumphalste in den {979}Schatten gestellt wurde. Für Radames’ und Aidas Operngemüter gab es das sachlich Bevorstehende nicht. Ihre Stimmen schwangen sich unisono zum seligen Oktavenvorhalt auf, versichernd, nun öffne sich der Himmel und ihrem Sehnen erstrahle das Licht der Ewigkeit. Die tröstliche Kraft dieser Beschönigung tat dem Zuhörer außerordentlich wohl und trug nicht wenig dazu bei, daß diese Nummer seines Leibprogramms ihm so besonders am Herzen lag.","You had to imagine Amneris' indignation at this priestly harshness as best you could, because the playback stopped here, and Hans Castorp had to change the record, which he did with quiet, brief movements, with his eyes downcast, as it were, and when he turned again down to listen, it was already the last scene of the melodrama that he heard: the final duet of Radames and Aida, sung at the bottom of her cellar grave, while bigoted and cruel priests celebrated their cult in the temple above their heads, spread their hands, indulged in muffled murmurs... ""Tu - in questa tomba?!"" blared the indescribably appealing, at once sweet and heroic voice of Radames, horrified and delighted... Yes, she had found herself with him, the beloved, for whose sake he forfeited honor and life , she had been expecting him here, had herself locked up with him in order to die with him, and the chants which she uttered on this subject, sometimes interrupted by v From the muffled tones of the ceremonial on the upper floor, exchanged with one another, or to which they united - it was actually they who had deeply impressed the lonely-night listener: in terms of the circumstances as well as their musical Expression. Heaven was spoken of in these hymns, but they themselves were heavenly and they were sung heavenly. The melodic line that Radames' and Aida's voices insatiably traced individually and then in unison, this simple and blissful curve playing around tonic and dominant, which {978}from the root to a long stressed suspension, half a tone before the octave, rose and after a fleeting touch with it turned to the fifth, appeared to the listener as the most transfigured, most admirable thing he had ever encountered. But he would have been less in love with the phonetic without the underlying situation that made his mind all the more receptive to the sweetness that ensued. It was so beautiful that Aida had found herself with the lost Radames, in order to share the fate of his grave with him forever! The condemned man rightly protested against the victim of such a lovely life, but his tender, desperate ""No, no! troppo sei bella« the delight of final union with the one he had thought he would never see again was noticeable, and to clearly feel this delight, this gratitude, Hans Castorp required no exercise of imagination. But what he finally felt, understood and enjoyed, while he looked with folded hands at the small black blind between the slats of which all this was blooming, was the triumphant ideality of music, of art, of the human soul, the high and irrefutable embellishment, which she bestowed upon the vulgar ugliness of real things. One only had to imagine what was happening here, taken soberly! Two people buried alive, lungs full of mine gas, would die here together, or, even worse, one after the other, of starvation cramps, and then decomposition would do its unspeakable work on their bodies, until two skeletons lay under the vault, each of them would be completely indifferent and insensitive whether it was lying alone or in pairs. That was the real and factual side of things - a side and thing in itself that was completely irrelevant to the idealism of the heart, and was most triumphantly overshadowed by the spirit of beauty and music. For Radames' and Aida's operatic minds, the factual imminence did not exist. Their voices soared in unison to the blissful octave suspension, assuring them that the heavens would now open and the light of eternity would shine for their longing. The comforting power of this euphemism did the listener extraordinarily well and contributed not a little to the fact that this number of his personal program was so dear to his heart.","The outraged feelings of Amneris at this priestly severity had to be imagined, for here the record broke off. Hans Castorp changed the plate, with as few movements as possible, his eyes cast down. When he seated himself again, it was to listen to the last scene of the melodrama, the closing duet of Radames and Aida, sung in the underground vaults, while above their heads in the temple the cruel and bigoted priests perform the service of their cult, spreading forth their arms, giving out a dull, murmurous sound. “Tu—in qitesta tomba?” comes the inexpressibly moving, sweet and at the same time heroic voice of Radames, in mingled horror and rapture. Yes, she has found her way to him, the beloved one for whose sake he has forfeited life and honour, she has awaited him here, to die with him; and the exchange of song between the two, broken at times by the muffled sound of the ceremonies above them, or blending and harmonizing with it, pierced the soul of our solitary night-watcher to its very depth, as much by reason of the circumstances as by the melodic expression of them. They sang of heaven, these two; but truly the songs were heavenly themselves, and heavenly sweet the singing of them. That melodic line resistlessly travelled by the voices, solo and unisono, of Radames and Aida; that simple, rapturous ascent, playing from tonic to dominant, as it mounts from the fundamental to the sustained note a half-tone before the octave, then turning back again to the fifth—it seemed to the listener the most rarefied, the most ecstatic he had ever heard. But he would have been less ravished by the sounds, had not the situation which gave them birth prepared his spirit to yield to the sweetness of the music. It was so beautiful, that Aida should have found her way to the condemned Radames, to share his fate for ever! The condemned one protested, quite properly, against the sacrifice of the precious life; but in his tender, despairing “No, no, troppo sei bella” was the intoxication of final union with her whom he had thought never to see again. It needed no effort of imagination to enable Hans Castorp to feel with Radames all this intoxication, all this gratitude. And what, finally, he felt, understood, and enjoyed, sitting there with folded hands, looking into the black slats of the jalousies whence it all issued, was the triumphant idealism of the music, of art, of the human spirit; the high and irrefragable power they had of shrouding with a veil of beauty the vulgar horror of actual fact. What was it, considered with the eye of reason, that was happening here? Two human beings, buried alive, their lungs full of pit gas, would here together— or, more horrible still, one after the other—succumb to the pangs of hunger, and thereafter the process of putrefaction would do its unspeakable work, until two skeletons remained, each totally indifferent and insensible to the other’s presence or absence. This was the real, objective fact—but a side, and a state of affairs quite distinct, of which idealism and emotion would have none, which was triumphantly put in the shade by the music and the beauty of the theme. The situation as it stood did not exist for either operatic Radames or operatic Aida. Their voices rose unisono to the blissful sustained note leading into the octave, as they assured each other that now heaven was opening, and the light of its eternity streaming forth before their yearning eyes. The consoling power of this aesthetic palliation did the listener good, and went far to account for the special love he bore this number of his programme.","You had to use your own imagination for Amneris’s outrage, since the music broke off here, and Hans Castorp had to change records. With downcast eyes, so to speak, he accomplished this with a few silent, deft movements; and when he sat down to listen again, it was the last scene of the melodrama that he heard: the final duet of Radames and Aida, sung at the bottom of their crypt, while above their heads bigoted, cruel priests, raising and spreading their hands in the ceremonies of their cult, lifted their voices in a dull murmur. “Tu—in questa tomba?” The question rang out in the indescribably alluring voice of Radames, a tenor at once both sweet and heroic, horrified and ecstatic. Yes, his beloved has found her way to him, the woman for whom he forfeited honor and life; she has been waiting for him here, to be locked in the tomb with him, to die with him. But it was what they now sang to each other, or at times with one another, concerning this situation, interrupted now and then by the muffled tones of the ceremonies several stories above—it was this exchange of song that deeply stirred the soul of the lonely, nocturnal listener, both in regard to the situation and its musical expression. The words spoke of heaven, but the very music was heavenly, was sung in heavenly voices. The melodic line that Radames’ and Aida’s voices insatiably followed, first each alone and then together, its simple, blissful arc playing between tonic and dominant, suspended too long at the keynote, then ascending to a halftone below the octave, fleetingly brushing it, and returning to the fifth—that melody seemed to the listener the most radiant, most admirable music he had ever heard. And yet he would have been less in love with its sound had it not been for the underlying situation, which prepared him emotionally to hear the sweet music emerging from it. It was so beautiful, the way Aida had found her way to doomed Radames to share his fate in the crypt for all eternity. And the condemned man quite rightly protested her sacrificing her own dear life; and yet in his gentle, desperate, “No, no! troppo sei bella,” one could hear his true ecstasy in being united at last with the woman he had assumed he would never see again. It required no effort of imagination for Hans Castorp to share in the tenor’s ecstasy and gratitude, but as he sat there with folded hands, staring at the little black louvers, from between whose slats this all burst forth, ultimately what he felt, understood, and relished was the victorious ideality of music, of art, of human emotions, their sublime and incontrovertible ability to gloss over the crude horrors of reality. You had only to picture coolly and calmly what was actually happening here. Two people were being buried alive; their lungs full of the gases of the crypt, cramped with hunger, they would perish together, or even worse, one after the other; and then decay would do its unspeakable work on their bodies, until two skeletons lay there under those vaults, each indifferent and insensitive to whether it lay there alone or with another set of bones. That was the real, factual side of the matter—a set of facts that stood all to itself, that had nothing whatever to do with the idealism of the heart, and that was triumphantly vanquished by the spirit of beauty and music. For the Radames and Aida of the opera, this factual future did not exist. They let their voices sweep in unison to the blessed sustained note of the octave, secure in the belief that heaven was opening before them, that their longings were bathed in the light of eternity. The consoling power of beauty to gloss things over did its listener a great deal of good and contributed much to his special fondness for this segment of his favorite concert."
"Peeperkorn, mit hochgeschlagenem Mantelkragen, den Hut neben sich am Boden, trank Portwein aus einem silbernen Becher mit Monogramm, den er mehrmals leerte. Und plötzlich begann er zu sprechen. Der wunderliche Mann! Es war unmöglich, daß er seine eigene Stimme hörte, geschweige daß die anderen eine Silbe hätten verstehen können von dem, was er verlauten ließ, ohne daß es verlautete. Er aber erhob den Zei{941}gefinger, streckte, den Becher in der Rechten, den linken Arm aus, die flache Hand schräg erhoben, und man sah, wie sein Königsantlitz sich redend bewegte, sein Mund Worte formte, die tonlos blieben, als würden sie in luftleerem Raum gesprochen. Niemand dachte anders, als daß er sein nutzloses Tun, das man mit betretenem Lächeln betrachtete, sogleich wieder einstellen werde, – er aber fuhr fort, sich unter bannenden, Aufmerksamkeit erzwingenden Kulturgebärden seiner Linken in das alles verschlingende Getöse hinein zu äußern, indem er die kleinen, müden und blassen, gewaltsam aufgerissenen Augen unter gespannten Stirnfalten abwechselnd auf einen und den anderen seiner Zuschauer richtete, so daß der eben Angeredete gezwungen war, mit hochgezogenen Brauen ihm zuzunicken und offenen Mundes die hohle Hand an die Ohrmuschel zu legen, als ob das die Heillosigkeit der Sache irgend hätte bessern können. Jetzt stand er sogar auf! Den Becher in der Hand, in seinem zerdrückten, fast fußlangen Reisemantel, dessen Kragen aufgestellt war, barhäuptig, die hohe, idolhaft gefaltete Stirn vom weißen Haar umflammt, stand er am Felsen und regte das Antlitz, vor das er dozierend den lanzenüberragten Ring seiner Finger hielt, die Undeutlichkeit seines tauben Toastes mit dem bannenden Zeichen der Genauigkeit versehend. Man erkannte an seinen Gebärden und las von seinen Lippen einzelne Wörter, die man von ihm zu hören gewohnt war: »Perfekt« und »Erledigt«, – nichts weiter. Man sah sein Haupt sich schräge neigen, zerrissene Bitternis der Lippen, das Bild des Schmerzensmannes. Dann wieder sah man das üppige Grübchen erblühen, sybaritische Schalkheit, ein tanzendes Gewänderraffen, die heilige Unsittsamkeit des Heidenpriesters. Er hob den Becher, führte ihn im Halbkreis vor den Augen der Gäste hin und trank ihn in zwei, drei Schlukken so bis zum letzten aus, daß der Boden ganz nach oben stand. Dann reichte er ihn mit ausgestrecktem Arme dem Ma{942}laien, der das Gefäß, Hand auf der Brust, entgegennahm, und gab das Zeichen zum Aufbruch.","Peeperkorn, with his coat collar turned up and his hat on the floor by his side, drank port from a monogrammed silver goblet, which he emptied several times. And suddenly he began to speak. The whimsical man! There was no way he could hear his own voice, let alone understand a syllable of what he said without saying it. But he raised his forefinger, held out the cup in his right hand, stretched out his left arm, the palm of his hand raised at an angle, and one saw how his royal face moved in speaking, his mouth formed words that remained toneless when they would be spoken in a vacuum. No one thought otherwise than that he would immediately stop his useless activity, which was looked at with an embarrassed smile - but he continued to express himself with spellbinding, attention-grabbing cultural gestures of his left hand into the all-consuming din, by saying the small, tired and pale, violently wide eyes under tense forehead wrinkles directed alternately at one or the other of his spectators, so that the person just addressed was forced to nod at him with raised eyebrows and cupped his hand to his ear with his mouth open, as if that were the case the hopelessness of the matter could have been improved in some way. Now he even got up! Cup in hand, in his crushed, almost foot-long traveling coat, the collar of which was turned up, bareheaded, his high, idolatrous forehead surrounded by white hair, he stood on the rock and moved his face, in front of which he lectured the ring of his fingers surmounted by a lance stopped, marking the vagueness of his numb toast with the spellbinding mark of accuracy. You could tell from his gestures and read from his lips individual words that you were used to hearing from him: ""Perfect"" and ""Done"" - nothing more. One saw his head bowed to one side, torn bitterness on his lips, the image of the man of sorrows. Then again one saw the luxuriant dimple blossom, sybaritic mischievousness, a dancing gathering of robes, the holy immorality of the pagan priest. He lifted the cup, led it in a semicircle in front of the guests and drank it down in two or three sips until the bottom was up. Then, with outstretched arms, he handed it to the Malay, who took the vessel with his hand on his breast, and gave the signal to leave.","Peeperkorn sat with his coat-collar turned up and his hat on the ground beside him, drinking port out of a monogrammed silver cup, which he emptied many times. And suddenly he began to speak. Extraordinary man! It was impossible for him to hear his own voice, still more for the others to catch a syllable of what he let transpire without its in the least transpiring. But with the winecup in his right hand, he raised his forefinger, stretching his left arm palm outwards toward the water. They saw his kingly features move in speech, the mouth form words, which were as soundless as though spoken into empty, etherless space. No one dreamed he would continue; with embarrassed smiles they watched this futile activity, thinking every moment it would cease. But he went on, with tense, compelling gesture, to harangue the clamour that swallowed his words; directing upon this or that one of the company by turns the gaze of his pale little weary eyes, spanned wide beneath the lifted folds of his brow; and whoever felt himself addressed was constrained to nod back again, wide-eyed, openmouthed, hand to ear, as though any sort of effort to hear could better the utterly hopeless situation. He even stood up! There, in his crumpled ulster, that reached nearly to his heels, the collar turned up; bare-headed, cup in hand, the high brow creased with folds like some heathen idol’s in a shrine, and crowned by the aureole of white hair like flickering flames; there he stood by the rocks and spoke, holding the circle of thumb and forefinger, with the lancelike others above it, before his face, and sealing his mute and incomprehensible toast with that compelling sign of precision. Such words as they were accustomed to hearing from him, they could read on his lips or divine from his gestures: “Settled” and “Absolutely!”—but that was all. They saw his head sink sideways, the broken bitterness of the lips, they saw the man of sorrows in his guise. But then quite suddenly flashed the dimple, the sybaritic roguishness, the garment snatched up dancewise, the ritual impropriety of the heathen priest. He lifted his beaker, waved it half-circle before the assembled guests, and drank it out in three gulps, so that it stood bottom upwards. Then he handed it with outstretched arm to the Malay, who received it with an obeisance, and gave the sign to break up the feast.","Peeperkorn sat with his coat collar turned up and his hat on the ground beside him, drinking port from a monogrammed silver goblet, which he emptied several times. And suddenly he began to speak. What a strange man! It was impossible for him to hear his own voice, let alone for anyone else to understand a single syllable of what he expressed without expressing it. Holding his goblet in his right hand, he lifted one forefinger, stretched his left arm out, the palm raised at an angle—and his mouth formed words that remained soundless, as if spoken in an airless room. They all assumed that he would immediately cease this pointless activity, to which they responded with disconcerted smiles; but he went on holding forth in the all-devouring din. His left hand made compelling, riveting, cultured gestures that demanded their attention; his little, weary, pale eyes were opened wide under the raised creases of his brow; and he directed his gaze now at one member of his audience, now at another, so that each of them was forced to nod with mouth open and eyebrows raised and to hold one hand up to an ear, as if that would somehow improve a hopeless situation. Now he even stood up! Goblet in hand, bareheaded, the collar of his wrinkled, almost floor-length overcoat turned up, his idol-like creased brow encircled by flames of white hair—there he stood beside a boulder, and his face grew more animated as he held the ring of thumb and forefinger up to it, finger lances jutting into the air, and lectured, punctuating his vague, inaudible toast with the spellbinding token of precision. They recognized the gestures and could read the individual words they were accustomed to hear from his lips: “Agreed” and “Settled”—but nothing more. They saw his head tilt to one side, saw the ragged bitterness on his lips, the image of the Man of Sorrows. And then they saw that luxurious little dimple blossom—sybaritic roguishness, a dancing hitch of the robes, the holy lewdness of the heathen priest. He lifted his glass, passed it in a semicircle before the eyes of his guests, and downed it in two, three gulps, to the last drop, the foot of the goblet upended in the air.

"Aber einige Tage später, man hielt schon zwischen Anfang und Mitte des Monats, änderte sich alles, und ein nachträglicher Sommer fiel ein von solcher Pracht, daß es zum Verwundern war. Nicht umsonst hatte Hans Castorp den Oktober dieser Gegenden rühmen hören; wohl zweieinhalb Wochen lang herrschte Himmelsherrlichkeit über Berg und Tal, ein Tag überbot den anderen an blauender Reinheit, und mit so unvermittelter Kraft brannte die Sonne darein, daß jedermann sich veranlaßt fand, das leichteste Sommerzeug, Musselinkleider und Leinwandhosen, die schon verworfen gewesen, wieder hervorzusuchen und selbst der große Segeltuchschirm ohne Krücke, den man vermittelst einer sinnreichen Vorrichtung, einem mehrfach gelochten Pflock, an der Armlehne des Lie{344}gestuhles befestigte, in den mittleren Tagesstunden nur ungenügenden Schutz gegen die Glut des Gestirnes bot.","But a few days later, between the beginning and middle of the month, everything changed, and a belated summer fell of such splendor that it was amazing. It was not for nothing that Hans Castorp had heard these regions praised for October; For two and a half weeks heavenly splendor reigned over mountains and valleys, one day surpassed the other in blue purity, and the sun burned down with such sudden force that everyone felt compelled to take back the lightest summer clothes, muslin dresses and canvas trousers, which had already been discarded and even the large canvas umbrella without a crutch, which was fastened to the armrest of the lounger by means of an ingenious device, a peg with multiple holes, offered only insufficient protection against the glow of the stars in the middle hours of the day.","Some days later, however—that is, between the beginning and middle of the month— there came another change: a latter summer set in, with amazing splendour. The praises of this mountain October, which Hans Castorp had heard, were not idly sung. For some two and a half weeks all the glories of heaven reigned over valley and mountain, one day outvied another in blueness and clarity, and the sun burned down with such immediate power that everyone felt impelled to don the lightest of wear, muslin frocks and linen trousers already put aside. The adjustable canvas parasol without a handle was called into requisition, and fitted by its cunning device of holes and pegs on to the arm of the reclining-chair; and even its shelter was felt to be insufficient against the midday glare.","But several days later, somewhere between the beginning and the middle of the month, things turned around again, and a belated summer burst upon them with absolutely astonishing splendor. Not without good reason, then, had Hans Castorp heard people praise October in these regions. For a good two and a half weeks a splendid sky reigned above mountains and valley, each new day outdoing the last for sheer blue purity; and the sun burned with such intensity that everyone found good reason to dig out his or her lightest summer clothes, the cast-aside muslin dresses and linen trousers; and even the large white canvas sunshade, which had no handle but was ingeniously fixed with a peg and several holes to the arm of the lounge chair, offered only inadequate protection from the midday glare."

"Der Juli war warm und heiter gewesen. Aber mit Anbruch des neuen Monats fiel schlechtes Wetter ein, trübe Nässe, Schneeregen, dann unzweideutiger Schneefall, und mit Einschaltung einzelner prangender Sommertage dauerte das an, über das Monatsende hin, in den September hinein. Anfangs hielten die Zimmer sich noch warm von der vorhergegangenen Sommerperiode; man hatte zehn Grad darin, das galt für behaglich. Aber rasch wurde es kälter und kälter, und man war froh über den Schnee, der das Tal bedeckte, denn sein Anblick – nur dieser, der Tiefstand der Temperatur allein wäre ohne Folge {624}geblieben – bewog die Verwaltung, zu heizen, zuerst nur den Speisesaal, dann auch die Zimmer, und man konnte, wenn man, nach geleistetem Liegedienst aus seinen zwei Decken gewickelt, von der Loggia hereinkam, mit den feuchtstarren Händen die belebten Röhren betasten, deren trockener Hauch freilich das Brennen der Wangen verstärkte.","July had been warm and clear. But with the beginning of the new month, bad weather set in, cloudy wetness, sleet, then unequivocal snowfall, and with the addition of a few glorious summer days, this lasted through the end of the month and into September. At first the rooms were still warm from the previous summer period; it was ten degrees, which was considered comfortable. But it quickly got colder and colder, and people were happy about the snow that covered the valley, because the sight of it - just this, the low temperature alone would have had no consequences {624} - persuaded the administration to heat, at first only the dining room, then the rooms too, and when you came in from the loggia, wrapped in your two blankets after lying down, you could feel the living pipes with your stiff, damp hands, the dry breath of which admittedly increased the burning in your cheeks.","July had been warm and bright. But with August bad weather set in, cloudy and damp; with first a sleety drizzle and then actual snow. And it lasted—with interludes of single resplendent days—all through the month, and on into September. At first the rooms held the warmth of the summery period just past: they stood at fifty degrees, which passed for comfortable. But it grew rapidly colder; there were rejoicings when the snowfall whitened the valley, for the sight of it—the sight alone, for the mere drop of the temperature would not have sufficed—compelled the management to heat, first the dining-room, then the chambers as well; so that when one rolled out of the rugs, at the end of a rest period, and re-entered one’s chamber, one might warm one’s stiffened fingers against the hot pipes, though the dry air these gave out did accentuate the burning in the cheeks.","July had been warm and sunny. But at the start of the new month, bad weather set in—damp, gloomy days, with a mixture of snow and rain, then snow, clear and simple; and except for an occasional splendid burst of summer, the bad weather continued for the rest of the month and on into September. At first the rooms held the warmth of the preceding summer days—fifty-five degrees, which was considered comfortable—but they quickly grew colder and colder. People were glad to see snow cover the valley, because that sight—and only that sight, since falling temperatures accomplished nothing—moved management to turn on the heat, at first only in the dining hall, but then in the rooms as well, so that when you unwrapped yourself from your blankets at the end of a rest cure and came back into the room from the balcony, your moist, numb hands could feel warmth stirring in the radiator, even if the dry heat only made your cheeks burn all the more."

"Über die Tagesordnung nun gerade, versetzte Naphta beißend, scheine Herr Settembrini nicht ganz wohlunterrichtet. Auf der Tagesordnung eben stehe als Frage, was jener als ausgemacht zu behandeln für gut finde: nämlich, ob die mediterran-klassisch-humanistische Überlieferung eine Menschheitssache und darum menschlich-ewig – oder ob sie allenfalls nur Geistesform und Zubehör einer Epoche, der bürgerlich-liberalen, gewesen sei und mit ihr sterben könne. Dies zu entscheiden, werde Sache der Geschichte sein, und es sei Herrn Settembrini immerhin zu empfehlen, sich nicht allzu sehr in Sicherheit zu wiegen, daß die Entscheidung im Sinn seines lateinischen Konservativismus fallen werde.","Now, Naphta retorted bitingly, Mr. Settembrini does not seem to be entirely well informed about the agenda. The question on the agenda is what he thinks it is good to treat as settled: namely, whether the Mediterranean-classical-humanistic tradition is a matter of humanity and therefore human-eternal - or whether it is at most only a spiritual form and an accessory of an epoch, the bourgeois- liberal, had been and could die with her. It will be a matter for history to decide this, and it is advisable for Mr. Settembrini not to feel too certain that the decision will be in the spirit of his Latin conservatism.","It was, Naphta rejoined bitingly, just this ordered programme about which Herr Settembrini seemed not to be very well informed. That which he took for granted was precisely that which was being called in question: namely, whether the Mediterranean, classic, humanistic tradition was bound up with humanity and so coexistent with it, or whether it was but the intellectual garb and appurtenance of a bourgeois liberal age, with which it would perish. History would decide this; he would recommend Hen Settembrini not to lull himself in the secure triumph of his Latin conservatism.","As to the world’s agenda, Naphta sarcastically replied, Herr Settembrini did not appear very well informed about that. A matter that the Italian evidently preferred to take for granted would be the next item on that agenda: whether the classical tradition of the Mediterranean was intended for all humanity, and therefore eternal in human terms, or whether it had not merely been the intellectual fashion and trimmings of one particular epoch, the bourgeois liberal age, which could then die with it. It would be a matter for history to decide, and he recommended Herr Settembrini not let himself be lulled into any son of certainty that the decision would be rendered in favor of his Latin conservatism."

The travel companions appeared with only a slight delay on the outside staircase. Standing up there at Clawdia's side in long, somewhat worn ulster, Peeperkorn, whose king's head seemed to be thinning, lifted his soft, round hat, and his lips formed an inaudible general greeting.

Their companions appeared with no great delay on the threshold; Peeperkorn’s kingly head seemed narrower; he lifted his hat as he stood in a long, rather shabby ulster, by Madame Chauchat’s side, and his lips shaped a vague form of greeting to the company in general. Then he descended and shook hands with the three gentlemen, who met him at the foot of the steps.","At the appointed hour, then, they met at the portal of the Berghof. While Hans Castorp, Ferge, and Wehsal stood waiting for the residents of the royal suite, they talked and petted the horses, whose black, moist, clumsy lips took the sugar they offered on the palms of their hands.

"Ja, ein herrlicher Körper, die Fieberrinde! – es waren übrigens noch keine dreihundert Jahre, daß die Pharmakologie unseres Erdteils Kunde davon gewonnen, und noch kein Jahrhundert, daß die Chemie das Alkaloid, worauf seine Tugenden eigentlich beruhten, das Chinin also, entdeckt hatte – entdeckt und bis zu einem gewissen Grade analysiert; denn daß sie aus seiner Konstitution bis jetzt so recht klug geworden wäre oder imstande sei, es künstlich herzustellen, konnte die Chemie nicht {874}behaupten. Unsere Arzneimittelkunde tat überall gut, sich ihres Wissens nicht lästerlich zu überheben, denn wie mit dem Chinin erging es ihr mit so manchem: Sie wußte dies und das von der Dynamik, den Wirkungen der Stoffe, allein die Frage, worauf denn diese Wirkungen genau genommen zurückzuführen seien, setzte sie oft genug in Verlegenheit. Der junge Mann mochte sich doch in der Giftkunde umsehen, – über die elementaren Eigenschaften, die die Wirkungen der sogenannten Giftstoffe bedingten, würde niemand ihm Auskunft geben. Da waren zum Exempel die Schlangengifte, – über welche nicht mehr bekannt war, als daß diese tierischen Stoffe einfach in die Reihe der Eiweißverbindungen gehörten, aus verschiedenen Eiweißkörpern bestünden, die aber nur in dieser bestimmten – nämlich durchaus unbestimmten – Zusammensetzung ihre fulminanten Wirkungen taten: in den Blutkreislauf gebracht, Effekte zeitigten, über die man sich nur verwundern konnte, da man Eiweiß auf Gift nicht zu reimen gewohnt war. Aber mit der Welt der Stoffe, sagte Peeperkorn, indem er neben seinem blaßäugig vom Kissen aufgerichteten Haupt mit den Stirnarabesken den Exaktheitsring und die Lanzen seiner Finger emporhielt, – mit den Stoffen stehe es so, daß alle Leben und Tod auf einmal bärgen: alle seien Ptisanen und Gifte zugleich, Heilmittelkunde und Toxikologie seien ein und dasselbe, an Giften genese man, und was für des Lebens Träger gelte, töte unter Umständen mit einem einzigen Krampfschlage in Sekundenfrist.","Yes, a glorious body, the fever bark! Incidentally, it was less than three hundred years since the pharmacology of our continent had learned of it, and less than a century before chemistry had discovered the alkaloid on which its virtues are actually based, i.e. quinine - discovered and analyzed to a certain extent ; for chemistry could not {874}claim that up to now its constitution had made it really intelligent or that it was capable of producing it artificially. Our pharmaceutics did well everywhere not to blasphemously pride themselves on their knowledge, because as with quinine it happened to them with so many things: They knew this and that about the dynamics, the effects of the substances, just the question of what exactly these effects are based on to be traced back, often enough embarrassed them. The young man might look around in poison science - nobody would give him information about the elementary properties that caused the effects of the so-called poisonous substances. For example, there were the snake venoms – about which nothing more was known than that these animal substances simply belonged to the series of protein compounds, consisted of different protein bodies, but which only had their brilliant effects in this specific – namely quite indefinite – composition: brought into the bloodstream, brought about effects that one could only wonder about, since one was not used to rhyming protein with poison. But in the world of materials, said Peeperkorn, holding up the ring of precision and the spears of his fingers next to his pale-eyed head erected from the pillow with the forehead arabesques, - it is so with materials that all contain life and death at once: all are Ptisanes and poisons at the same time, medicinal science and toxicology are one and the same, one recovers from poisons, and what is considered to be the bearer of life, under certain circumstances, kills with a single spasm in a matter of seconds.","Yes, a wonderful substance, cinchona. It had not been three hundred years since European pharmacology made its acquaintance; not a century since the alkaloid had been isolated which was its active principle; isolated and, to a certain extent, analysed, for it would be too much to say that chemistry knew all there was to know about it, or was in a position to reproduce it synthetically. Our pharmacology need not be too arrogant over its science; for the state of its knowledge on the subject of quinine was a fair example of the rest. It had various facts about the operation of this or that drug; but was very often embarrassed to know the causes of the effect produced. If the young man were to survey the field of our toxicological knowledge, he would find that no one could tell him anything of the elementary properties conditioning the effects of the so-called poisons. For example, take the venom of snakes: all that was known of these animal substances was that they belonged to the albuminoid group, and consisted of various proteids, none of which produced a violent effect, except in this certain—and most uncertain—combination. Introduced into the blood-circulation, the effect was astonishing indeed, considering how far we were from being accustomed to think of albumen as a poison. The truth was, Peeperkorn said, and lifted his head from the pillow, elevated the arabesques on his brow, and gave point to his remarks by the little circle and the upright finger-tips—the truth was, in the world of matter, that all substances were the vehicle of both life and death, all of them were medicinal and all poisonous, in fact therapeutics and toxicology were one and the same, man could be cured by poison, and substances known to be the bearer of life could kill at a thrust, in a single second of time.","Yes, a splendid substance, this china-bark! European pharmacology had known of it, by the way, for less than three hundred years, and chemistry had discovered quinine less than a hundred years before—that is, the alkaloid that was the basis of its virtue—discovered and to some extent analyzed it, though thus far the chemists could not claim to understand its composition well enough to produce it artificially. In general, our pharmacologists would do well not to be too overweening about their knowledge, for they had the same problem with a great many things: they knew this and that about the dynamics and effects of a substance, but any question as to precise causes all too frequently proved an embarrassment. The young man needed only to look at toxicology. No one would be able to give him any information about the elementary properties that produced the effects of so-called poisons. Snake venoms, for instance, why, no more was known about them than that, as animal products, they were included among the complex proteins, were made up of simpler proteins that in certain—but as yet quite uncertain—combinations packed a wallop. Introduced into the bloodstream, they brought forth results we considered quite astounding, simply because we were not used to equating protein and poison. But the world of substances, Peeperkorn said—holding the ring of perfection and the three finger lances up next to his head, which he had now lifted from the pillow to gaze out with pale eyes from under the arabesques of his brow—the world of substances was such that they all concealed both life and death simultaneously, all were both therapeutic and poisonous. Pharmacology and toxicology were one and the same thing—we were healed by poisons, and a substance considered an agent of life could, under certain circumstances, in a single convulsion kill within seconds."
"»Mein Kind«, sagte er, »– gut. Alles ganz gut soweit. Sie sind klein, – was macht mir das? Im Gegenteil! Ich werte es positiv, ich danke Gott dafür, daß Sie sind, wie Sie sind, und durch Ihre charaktervolle Kleinheit – Nun gut denn! Auch was ich von Ihnen wünsche, ist klein, klein und charaktervoll. Vor allem, wie heißen Sie?«","'My child,' he said, '- good. Everything is fine so far. They are small - what does that matter to me? On the contrary! I take it positively, I thank God that you are the way you are and by your characterful littleness - well then! Also what I want from you is small, small and full of character. First of all, what's your name?'","“My child,” said he, “very well. Very well indeed—very. You are small—what is that to me? On the contrary. I find it a positive good, I thank God, that you are as you are; I thank God you are so small and full of character. What I want of you is also small and full of character. But in the first place, what is your name?”","“My child,” he said, “—fine. Very fine, so far. You are small—but what is that to me? On the contrary! I take it as something positive.

But first, what is your name?”"
"»Sprechend!« log Hans Castorp, weniger aus Falschheit, als in dem Bewußtsein, daß er, wenn alles mit rechten Dingen zugegangen wäre, das Modell gar nicht hätte erkennen dürfen, – so wenig, wie Joachim es aus eigenen Kräften jemals erkannt hätte, der gute, überlistete Joachim, dem nun freilich ein Licht aufging, das wahre Licht nach dem falschen, das Hans Castorp ihm vorher angezündet. »Ja so«, sagte er leise und schickte sich darein, das Bild betrachten zu helfen. Sein Vetter hatte sich für ihr Fernbleiben von der Verandageselligkeit schadlos zu halten gewußt.","""Speaking!"" Hans Castorp lied, less out of deceit than out of the awareness that, if everything had gone right, he should not have recognized the model at all - just as little as Joachim would have ever recognized it on his own. the good, outwitted Joachim, who of course now saw the light, the true light after the false light that Hans Castorp had previously lit for him. ""Yeah,"" he said quietly, preparing to help look at the picture. His cousin had been able to compensate him for her absence from the porch party.","“Speaking,” Hans Castorp lied. He did so less from insincerity than in the consciousness that, on the face of things, he ought not to have been able to recognize her. Joachim could never have done so—good Joachim, who saw the whole affair now in its true light, after the false one Hans Castorp had first cast upon it; saw how the wool had been pulled over his eyes; and with a murmured recognition applied himself to help look at the painting. His cousin had paid him out for not going into society after luncheon.","I’m pleased you see the likeness.” “The lady as she lives and breathes,” Hans Castorp lied, less out of cunning than out of an awareness that if everything had been as it should be, he ought not to have recognized the lady at all, any more than Joachim had recognized her on his own—dear old outfoxed Joachim, for whom a light now went on, the real light and not the false one Hans Castorp had lit for him. “Ah, yes,” Joachim said softly and set about helping Hans Castorp study the painting. His cousin had certainly known how to recover damages for having been kept away from the gathering on the veranda."
"{301}»Man ist reich, ja, – oder man ist es nicht. Und wenn nicht, – desto schlimmer. Ich? Ich bin kein Millionär, aber das meine ist mir sichergestellt, ich bin unabhängig, ich habe zu leben.

Hat der denn noch Geld?‹ fragen sie … Wörtlich so und mit genau solchem Gesicht; ich habe es oft gehört, und ich merke, daß es sich mir eingeprägt hat. Also muß es mir doch wohl sonderbar vorgekommen sein, obgleich ich gewöhnt war, es zu hören, – sonst hätte es sich mir nicht eingeprägt. Oder wie meinen Sie? Nein, ich glaube nicht, daß es zum Beispiel Ihnen, als homo humanus, zusagen würde bei uns; selbst mir, der ich doch dort zu Hause bin, ist es öfters kraß vorgekommen, wie ich nachträglich merke, obgleich ich persönlich ja nicht darunter zu leiden gehabt habe. Wer nicht die besten, teuersten Weine servieren läßt bei seinen Diners, zu dem geht man überhaupt nicht, und seine Töchter bleiben sitzen. So sind die Leute. Wie ich hier so liege und es von weitem sehe, kommt es mir kraß vor. Was brauchten Sie für Ausdrücke, – phlegmatisch und? Und energisch! Gut, aber was heißt das? Das heißt hart, kalt.

For suppose one is not rich, or ceases to be,—then woe betide. >The? Does he still have any money?‹ they ask … Literally like that and with exactly the same face; I've heard it often, and I feel it has made an impression on me. So it must have struck me as odd, although I was accustomed to hearing it - otherwise it would not have stuck in my mind. Or how do you mean? No, I don't think that you, as a homo humanus, would like it here with us; even to me, who is at home there, it often seemed crass, as I later realized, although I personally didn't suffer from it. If you don't have the best, most expensive wines served at your dinners, you don't go to them at all, and your daughters stay put. That's how people are. As I lie here and see it from afar, it seems crass to me. What expressions did you need – phlegmatic and? And energetic! Fine, but what does that mean? That means hard, cold.

If you aren’t rich, or if you leave off being, then woe be unto you. ‘ Oh, he?’ they will say about this or that person. ‘ He hasn’t any money, has he?’ Literally that, and making just such a face; I have often heard them, and I see now it made an impression on me—which it would not have done, of course, unless it had struck me as strange. Or don’t you think that follows? No, I don’t think you, for instance, as homo humanus, would feel very comfortable down there; it often struck me that it was pretty strong, as I can see now, though I am a native of the place and for myself have never had to suffer from it. If a man does not serve the best and dearest wines at his dinners, people don’t go, and his daughters are left on his hands. That is what they are like. Lying here and looking at it from this distance, I find it pretty gross. What were the words you used—phlegmatic and—and energetic. That’s very good. But what does it mean? It means hard, cold. And what do hard and cold mean? They mean cruel. It is a cruel atmosphere down there, cruel and ruthless.

I’m no millionaire, but what I have is well invested. I’m independent, have enough to live. But let’s leave me out of it. If you had said one has to be rich back there—I would have agreed with you. Because let us assume you are not rich, or stop being rich—you are in a sorry state! ‘ Him? Does he still have some money left?’ they ask. Those are their very words, and that’s the face they make.

That means hard, cold. And what does hard and cold mean? It means cruel. The air down there is cruel, ruthless. Lying here and watching from a distance, it almost makes me shudder.”"
"{378}»Was haben Sie gegen den Körper?« unterbrach Hans Castorp ihn rasch und blickte ihn groß an mit seinen blauen Augen, deren Weißes von roten Adern durchzogen war. Ihm schwindelte vor seiner Tollkühnheit, und man sah es ihm an. »Wovon spreche ich?« dachte er. »Es wird ungeheuerlich. Aber ich habe mich einmal auf Kriegsfuß mit ihm gestellt und werde ihm, so lange es irgend geht, das letzte Wort nicht lassen. Natürlich wird er es haben, aber das macht nichts, ich werde immerhin dabei profitieren. Ich werde ihn reizen.« Er ergänzte seinen Einwand:","{378}""What do you have against that body?"" Hans Castorp quickly interrupted him and looked at him wide with his blue eyes, the whites of which were streaked with red veins. His foolhardiness made him dizzy, and you could see it. ""What am I talking about?"" he thought. 'It's going to be outrageous. But I once quarreled with him and will not let him have the last word as long as possible. Of course he'll have it, but that doesn't matter, I'll still benefit from it. I will tease him.” He added to his objection:","Whether that protest survives in you, as you comply with the behests of our powers that be—whether it is not rather the body, the body and its evil propensities, to which you lend a ready ear—” “What have you against the body?” interrupted Hans Castorp suddenly, and looked at him with wide blue eyes, the whites of which were veined with blood. He was giddy with his own temerity and showed as much.—Whatever am I saying? he thought. I’m getting out of my depth. But I won’t give way; now I have begun, I won’t give him the last word if I can help it. Of course he will have it anyhow, but never mind, I will make the most of it while I can.—He enlarged upon his objection:","“What do you have against the body?” Hans Castorp interrupted quickly, staring at him with large blue eyes, the whites broken with bloodshot veins. He was giddy with his own foolhardiness, as was only too obvious. (“What am I saying?” he thought. “This is ghastly. But I’ve declared war on him, and if at all possible I’m not going to let him have the last word. He’ll have it, of course, but that doesn’t matter. I’ll use it to my advantage all the same. I’ll provoke him.”) And now he completed his objection by asking, “But you are a humanist, are you not?"
"»Nein«, sagte Hans Castorp, als er wieder an seinem Tischende zwischen der Nähterin und der Engländerin Platz genommen und ergeben seine Serviette entfaltet hatte, obgleich {106}er noch so schwer belastet vom ersten Frühstück war. »Nein«, sagte er, »Gott steh mir bei, Milch kann ich überhaupt nicht trinken und am wenigsten jetzt. Ist nicht vielleicht Porter da?« Und er wandte sich zuerst höflich und zart an die Zwergin mit dieser Frage. Leider war keiner da. Aber sie versprach, Kulmbacher Bier zu bringen und brachte es auch. Es war dick, schwarz, braunschaumig und ersetzte den Porter aufs beste. Hans Castorp trank durstig davon aus einem hohen Halbliterglase. Er aß kalten Aufschnitt dazu auf Röstbrot. Wieder war Haferbrei aufgestellt und wieder viel Butter und Obst. Er ließ wenigstens seine Augen darauf ruhen, da er nicht fähig war, sich davon zuzuführen. Auch betrachtete er die Gästeschaft, – die Massen begannen sich für ihn zu teilen; Einzelpersonen traten hervor.","""No,"" said Hans Castorp, when he had sat down again at his end of the table between the seamstress and the Englishwoman and devotedly unfolded his serviette, although he was still so heavily burdened from the first breakfast. 'No,' he said, 'God help me, I can't drink milk at all, least of all now. Isn't Porter there, perhaps?' And he addressed the question first to the dwarf, politely and delicately. Unfortunately nobody was there. But she promised to bring Kulmbacher beer and she did. It was thick, black, frothy brown and a perfect substitute for the porter. Thirsty, Hans Castorp drank from a tall half-litre glass. He ate cold cold cuts on toast. There was porridge again and lots of butter and fruit again. He at least kept his eyes on it, unable to feed himself from it. He also looked at the guests - the masses began to part for him; Individuals emerged.","“No,” Hans Castorp said, when he was once more in his seat between the seamstress and the Englishwoman, and had docilely unfolded his serviette, though still heavy with the earlier meal; “no, God help me, milk I never could abide, and least of all now! Is there perhaps some porter?” He applied himself to the dwarf and put his question with the gentlest courtesy, but alas, there was none. She promised to bring Kulmbacher beer, and did so. It was thick, dark, and foaming brownly; it made a capital substitute for the porter. Hans Castorp drank it thirstily from a half-litre glass, and ate some cold meat and toast. Again there was oatmeal porridge and much butter and fruit. He let his eyes dwell upon them, incapable of more. And he looked at the guests as well; the groups began to break up for him, and individuals to stand out.","“No,” Hans Castorp said, taking his seat again at the end of the table between the seamstress and the Englishwoman and conscientiously unfolding his napkin—although he was still weighed down by his first breakfast. “No,” he said, “God help me, but I do not drink milk, and certainly not now. Is there some porter, perhaps?” And he turned to ask this question politely and gently of the dwarf. There was no porter, unfortunately. But she promised him some Kulmbach beer, and indeed she brought it. It was thick and black, with a foamy brown head, and was an excellent substitute for porter. Hans Castorp drank thirstily from the tall pint glass. He ate cold cuts on toast. There was more oatmeal on the table and lots of butter and fruit again. He at least let his eyes pass over it all, since he was incapable of helping himself to any of it. And he observed the other guests, too—the crowd was beginning to sort itself out for him and individuals were emerging."
"Sie gingen zusammen spazieren, legten dreimal täglich den dienstlichen Lustwandel zurück, auf welchen der Hofrat Joachim nun genauestens eingeschränkt hatte, damit unnötige Kräfteausgabe vermieden werde. Links von seinem Vetter ging Hans Castorp, – sie waren früher so oder auch anders gegangen, wie es gerade kam, aber jetzt hielt sich Hans Castorp vorwiegend links. Sie sprachen nicht viel, redeten die Worte, die der Berghof-Normaltag ihnen auf die Lippen führte, sonst nichts. Über das Thema, das zwischen ihnen stand, ist nichts zu reden, {801}zumal zwischen Leuten von Sittensprödigkeit, die einander nur äußerstenfalls mit Vornamen nennen. Dennoch hob es sich zuweilen drängend und wallend auf in Hans Castorps Zivilistenbrust, im Begriffe, sich zu ergießen. Aber es war unmöglich. Was schmerzlich-stürmisch emporgeschwollen war, sank zurück, und er verstummte.","They went for walks together, did the official stroll three times a day, to which Hofrat Joachim had now strictly limited, so that unnecessary expenditure of strength would be avoided. Hans Castorp walked to the left of his cousin - they used to walk one way or the other as it happened, but now Hans Castorp kept mostly to the left. They didn't talk much, just said the words that everyday Berghof life brought to their lips, nothing else. There is nothing to talk about about the subject that stood between them, {801}especially between people who are immoral and only call each other by their first names. Nevertheless, at times it rose urgently and surging in Hans Castorp's civilian breast, on the point of pouring out. But it was impossible. What had swollen up painfully and violently sank back and he fell silent.","Daily they took their walks together, thrice covering the prescribed distance, to which the Hofrat had now strictly limited Joachim, in order to husband his strength. Hans Castorp walked at his cousin’s left. They had been used to walk as chance had it, but now he held consistently to the left. They did not talk much; uttered the phrases proper to the daily routine, and little else. On the subject that lay between them there is nothing to say, especially between people of traditional reserve, who could scarcely bring themselves to utter each other’s first names. Sometimes it did well up insistently in Hans Castorp’s civilian breast, as though it must out. But it could not: the painful, rebellious feeling sank away again, and he was still.","They took their walks together, dutifully promenaded three times a day, but only the limited distance expressly prescribed by the director to avoid all unnecessary expenditure of energy. Hans Castorp walked on his cousin’s left—in days past they had taken up positions, right or left, as chance would have it; but Hans Castorp now kept consistently to the left. They did not speak much, only the phrases a normal day at the Berghof brought to their lips, nothing more. There was nothing to say about the topic that stood between them, particularly not for people so reserved by custom, who used first names only on the rarest of occasions. All the same, from time to time something would well up urgently inside Hans Castorp’s civilian breast, and he would be close to pouring out his feelings. But that was impossible. And what had welled up so painfully, so stormily, sank back and died away."
"Willkommener, tröstlicher Anblick! Rüstig hatte er es geschafft, trotz aller Widrigkeiten, daß nun sogar schon menschliche Baulichkeiten erschienen, zum Zeichen, das bewohnte Tal sei nahe. Vielleicht waren Menschen dort; vielleicht konnte man bei ihnen eintreten, um unter Dach und Fach das Ende des Wetters abzuwarten und nötigenfalls Begleitung und Führung zu haben, wenn unterdessen die natürliche Dunkelheit sollte eingefallen sein. Er hielt auf das chimärische, oft ganz im Wetterdunkel verschwindende Etwas zu, hatte noch einen kräfteverzehrenden Aufstieg gegen den Wind zu überwinden, um es zu erreichen, und überzeugte sich, angekommen, mit Empörung, Staunen, Schrecken und Schwindelgefühl, daß es die bekannte Hütte, der Heuschober mit steinbeschwertem Dache war, den er auf allerlei Umwegen und mit redlichster Anspannung zurückerobert hatte.","Welcome, comforting sight! Despite all the adversities, he had made it valiantly that human buildings were already appearing as a sign that the inhabited valley was near. Maybe people were there; perhaps they could be entered to await the end of the weather under one roof, and to have company and guidance, if necessary, if meanwhile natural darkness should have fallen. He headed for the chimerical something that often disappeared completely in the dark of the weather, still had to overcome an exhausting climb against the wind to reach it, and when he arrived he convinced himself with indignation, amazement, horror and dizziness that it was the familiar hut , who was a haystack with a stone-weighted roof, which he had recaptured by all sorts of detours and with the most honest effort.","Ah, sweet and blessed sight! Verily he had done well, to march stoutly on despite all obstacles, until now human dwellings appeared, in sign that the inhabited valley was at hand. Perhaps there were even human beings, perhaps he might enter and abide the end of the storm under shelter, then get directions, or a guide if the dark should have fallen. He held toward this chimerical goal, that often quite vanished in mist, and took an exhausting climb against the wind before it was reached; finally drew near it—to discover, with what staggering astonishment and horror may be imagined, that it was only the hay-hut with the weighted roof, to which, after all his striving, by all his devious paths, he had come back.","What a welcome, comforting sight! His stout heart had pulled him through, despite all adversity, and now the first human dwellings had appeared as a sign that the populated valley was near. Perhaps there were people there; maybe they would take him in, let him wait under their roof for the bad weather to end, and provide him with directions or a guide if real darkness had fallen by then. Although it took all his energy to climb against the wind, he made for that chimerical something, which often vanished entirely in the gloom, and when he finally arrived he realized—in dizzy outrage, amazement, and terror—that it was the familiar hut, the hayshed with its roof weighted down by stones, which he had now reconquered after many a detour and so much upright exertion."
mein geliebtes Heimatland« –,my beloved homeland” –,I must leave my lovéd home”,My homeland far behind—
"Was, was? In Hansens Gedanken- und Vorstellungswerkstatt ging es drunter und drüber. Da war der blaubemantelte Tod als humanistischer Rhetor; und wenn man den pädagogischen Literaturgott und Menschenfreund näher ins Auge faßte, so hockte da statt seiner eine Affenfratze mit dem Zeichen der Nacht und der Zauberei an der Stirn … Er wehrte und winkte {790}ab mit der Hand und legte sie dann über die Augen. Aber in das Dunkel, worein er sich vor der Verwirrung gerettet, klang Settembrinis Stimme, der fortfuhr, die Literatur zu preisen. Nicht nur die betrachtende, auch die aktive Größe, rief er, sei allezeit mit ihr verbunden gewesen; und er nannte Alexander, Cäsar, Napoleon, nannte den preußischen Friedrich und weitere Helden, sogar Lassalle und Moltke. Es focht ihn nicht an, daß Naphta ihn ins Chinesische heimschicken wollte, wo die skurrilste Vergötterung des Abc herrsche, die je erreicht worden sei, und wo man Generalfeldmarschall werde, wenn man alle vierzigtausend Wortzeichen tuschen könne, was recht nach dem Herzen eines Humanisten sein müsse. Eh, Naphta wußte recht wohl, daß es sich nicht ums Tuschen handelte, sondern um die Literatur als Menschheitsimpuls, um ihren Geist, armer Spötter! welcher der Geist selber war, das Wunder der Verbindung von Analyse und Form. Er war es, der das Verständnis für alles Menschliche weckte, die Schwächung und Auflösung dummer Werturteile und Überzeugungen betrieb, die Sittigung, Veredelung und Besserung des Menschengeschlechtes herbeiführte. Indem er die äußerste moralische Verfeinerung und Reizbarkeit schuf, erzog er, fern davon, zu fanatisieren, zugleich zum Zweifel, zur Gerechtigkeit, zur Duldung. Die reinigende, heiligende Wirkung der Literatur, die Zerstörung der Leidenschaften durch die Erkenntnis und das Wort, die Literatur als Weg zum Verstehen, zum Vergeben und zur Liebe, die erlösende Macht der Sprache, der literarische Geist als edelste Erscheinung des Menschengeistes überhaupt, der Literat als vollkommener Mensch, als Heiliger: – aus dieser strahlenden Tonart ging Herrn Settembrinis apologetischer Lobgesang. Ach, aber auch der Widersacher war nicht auf den Mund gefallen; er wußte das englische Halleluja durch schlimme, glänzende Einwände zu stören, indem er sich zur Partei der Erhaltung und des Lebens schlug gegen den Geist der Zersetzung, welcher sich {791}hinter jener seraphischen Gleisnerei verberge. Die Wunderverbindung, von welcher Herr Settembrini tremoliert habe, hieß es nun, laufe auf nichts als Trug und Gaukelspiel hinaus, denn die Form, die der literarische Geist mit dem Prinzip der Untersuchung und Trennung zu vereinigen sich rühme, sei nur eine Schein- und Lügenform, keine echte, gewachsene, natürliche, keine Lebensform. Der sogenannte Verbesserer des Menschen führe wohl Reinigung und Heiligung im Munde, in Wahrheit aber sei es die Entmannung und Entblutung des Lebens, worauf er ausgehe; ja, der Geist, die eifernde Theorie sei lebensschänderisch, und wer die Leidenschaften zerstören wolle, der wolle das Nichts, – das reine Nichts, rein allerdings, da »rein« denn in der Tat das einzige Attribut sei, das allenfalls dem Nichts noch könne beigelegt werden. Darin nun aber eben zeige Herr Settembrini, der Literat, sich recht als das, was er sei, nämlich als Mann des Fortschritts, des Liberalismus und der bürgerlichen Revolution. Denn der Fortschritt sei reiner Nihilismus und der liberale Bürger ganz eigentlich der Mann des Nichts und des Teufels, ja, er leugne Gott, das konservativ und positiv Absolute, indem er zum Teuflisch-Gegen-Absoluten schwöre und sich mit seinem Todespazifismus noch wunder wie fromm dünke. Er sei aber nichts weniger als fromm, sondern ein Hochverbrecher am Leben, vor dessen Inquisition und strenge Fehme er peinlich gezogen zu werden verdiene – et cetera.","what what? Things went haywire in Hansen's thought and imagination workshop. There was the blue-cloaked Death as a humanistic rhetor; and if you take a closer look at the pedagogical god of literature and philanthropist, instead of him there crouched a monkey's face with the sign of night and magic on its forehead ... He resisted and waved {790}his hand and then put it over his eyes . But in the darkness, into which he escaped from confusion, came Settembrini's voice, who continued to praise literature. Not only the contemplative but also the active greatness, he exclaimed, had always been connected with her; and he named Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, named the Prussian Friedrich and other heroes, even Lassalle and Moltke. It didn't bother him that Naphta wanted to send him home to Chinese, where the most whimsical deification of the ABC reigned that had ever been achieved, and where one could become a Field Marshal if one could ink all forty thousand word signs, which is right after the heart of a humanist must. Eh, Naphta knew very well that it wasn't a question of ink, but of literature as a human impulse, of its spirit, poor mocker! which was the spirit itself, the marvel of the union of analysis and form. It was he who awakened an understanding of everything human, who undertook the weakening and dissolution of stupid value judgments and convictions, who brought about the morality, ennoblement and improvement of the human race. By creating the utmost moral refinement and irritability, he educated, far from fanaticizing, at the same time doubt, justice, and toleration. The cleansing, sanctifying effect of literature, the destruction of passions through knowledge and the word, literature as a path to understanding, forgiveness and love, the redeeming power of language, the literary spirit as the noblest manifestation of the human spirit, the man of letters as a perfect man, as a saint: - from this radiant key went Mr. Settembrini's apologetic canticle. Alas, but the adversary was not dumb either; he knew how to disturb the English hallelujah with terrible, brilliant objections, while he sided with the party of preservation and life against the spirit of decomposition which was hidden behind that seraphic falsehood. The miraculous combination of which Mr. Settembrini had tremulated, it was now said, amounted to nothing but deceit and trickery, because the form that the literary spirit boasts of uniting with the principle of investigation and separation is only an apparent and lying form , not a real, grown, natural, not a life form. The so-called improver of man has cleansing and sanctification on his lips, but in truth it is the emasculation and bleeding of life that he is after; Yes, the spirit, the zealous theory, is life-threatening, and whoever wants to destroy the passions wants nothing—pure nothing, pure indeed, since ""pure"" is in fact the only attribute that can at best still be nothing be settled. In this, however, Mr. Settembrini, the man of letters, really shows himself for what he is, namely as a man of progress, of liberalism and of the bourgeois revolution. Because progress is pure nihilism and the liberal bourgeois is actually the man of nothing and the devil, yes, he denies God, the conservative and positive absolute, by swearing to the devilishly counter-absolute and with his death pacifism still astonishing and pious think. But he is nothing short of pious, but a high criminal alive, before whose inquisition and strict fehme he deserves to be embarrassingly dragged - et cetera.","Hans Castorp’s brain reeled. Here was blue-mantled death masquerading as a humanistic orator; and when one sought to gaze at closer range upon this pedagogic and literary god, benevolent to man, one discovered a squatting ape-faced figure, with the sign of night and magic on its brow. He waved it away with one hand, which he laid over his eyes. But upon that darkness wherein he sought refuge from complete bewilderment, there broke the voice of Herr Settembrini, continuing to chant the praises of literature. All greatness, both contemplative and active, he said, had been bound up with it from all time; and mentioned Alexander, Cæsar, Napoleon, named the Prussian Frederick and other heroes, even Lasalle and Moltke. It disturbed him not a whit that Naphta referred him to China, where such a witless idolatry of the alphabet obtained as had never been the case in any other land, and where one might become a field-marshal if one could draw the forty thousand word-symbols of the language—a standard, one would think, directly after a humanistic heart!—Ah, Naphta well knew— pitiable scoffer though he was!—that it was a matter not of drawing symbols but of literature as a human impulse, of its spirit, which was Spirit itself, the miraculous conjunction of analysis and form. This it was that awakened the understanding of all things human, that operated to weaken and dissolve silly prejudices and convictions, that brought about the civilizing, elevating, and betterment of the human race. While it developed extreme ethical sensitiveness and refinement, far from being fanatical, it preached honest doubt, fairness, tolerance. The purifying, healing influence of literature, the dissipating of passions by knowledge and the written word, literature as the path to understanding, forgiveness and love, the redeeming might of the word, the literary spirit as the noblest manifestation of the spirit of man, the writer as perfected type, as saint—in this high key was Herr Settembnni’s apologetic pitched. But alas, his antagonist was not struck dumb—on the contrary, he straightway set about with malicious, brilliant criticism to undermine the humanist’s panegyric. He declared himself to the party of conservation and of life, and struck out against the decadent spirit which hid itself behind all that seraphic cant. The marvellous conjunction to which Herr Settembrini referred, in a voice all quavering with emotion, was nothing but a deception and juggling, for the form which the literary spirit prided itself on uniting with the principle of examination and division was only an apparent, a lying form, no true, adequate, natural, living form. These so-called reformers of humanity did indeed take the words purification and sanctification in their mouths, but what they really meant and intended was the emasculation, the phlebotomy of life. Yes, their theory and moving spirit were in violation of life; and he who would destroy passion, that man desired nothing less than pure nothingness—pure, at least, in the sense that pure was the only adjective which could be applied to nothingness. It was just here that Herr Settembrini showed himself for that which he was: namely, the man of progress, liberalism, and middleclass revolution. For the progress was pure nihilism, the liberal citizen was quite precisely the advocate of nothingness and the Devil; yes, he denied God, the conservatively and positively Absolute, by swearing to the devilish anti-Absolute. And yet with his deadly pacificism thought himself monstrously pious. But he was anything else than pious, he was a traitor to life, before whose stern inquisition and Vehmgericht he deserved to be put to the question—and so forth.","What, what? Thoughts and images tumbled topsy-turvy in Hans’s mental workshop. There sat death, a humanistic rhetorician clad in a blue coat; and when you focused on this philanthropic and pedagogic god of literature, what you saw crouching there had a monkey face, with the symbols of night and sorcery on its brow. He resisted the image, waved it off with one hand, with which he then covered his eyes. But in the darkness into which he fled to escape confusion, he could hear Settembrini’s voice droning on in praise of literature. Not just the great thinkers, he exclaimed, but the great doers in every age as well, had been part of literature; and he named Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, named Frederick the Prussian and other heroes, even Lassalle and Moltke. It did not trouble him in the least when Naphta tried to send him packing to China, a land afflicted with the most bizarre idolatry of the ABC’s ever known to history, where you could become a field marshal if you could sketch all forty thousand characters—which surely had to warm the humanist’s heart. Eh, eh, Naphta knew quite well that he wasn’t talking about sketching, but about literature as the basic impulse of humanity, about the human spirit, which, mock as he might, was spirit per se, the miracle uniting analysis and form. That was what awakened our appreciation for all things human, weakened and dispelled foolish prejudices and beliefs, led to the civilizing ennoblement and improvement of humankind. And it did so by creating highly refined morals and sensitivities, while at the same time, and without any fanaticism, teaching healthy doubt, justice, and tolerance. The purifying, sanctifying effect of literature, the destruction of passions through knowledge and the Word; literature as the path to understanding, to forgiveness, and to love; the redemptive power of language, the literary spirit as the noblest manifestation of the human spirit per se; the man of letters as the perfect man, the saint—such were the radiant tones of Herr Settembrini’s hymn of apology. Ah, but his adversary was not tongue-tied, either; he knew how to disrupt this angelic hallelujah with nasty, brilliant protests, declaring himself a partisan of life and its conservation and an opponent of the spirit of sedition lurking beneath such seraphic dissemblance. The miraculous unification that Herr Settembrini had warbled on about, so he declared, was a sham, a sleight-of-hand trick, because form, which the literary spirit was so proud of uniting with principles of inquiry and discrimination, was merely a form of illusion and lies, not a genuine, natural form growing out of life. This so-called benefactor of mankind talked a fine game about purification and sanctification, but in fact he was bent upon the emasculation of life, wanted to let it bleed to death. Yes, his spirit, his zealous theory violated life itself, and whoever wanted to destroy passions wanted nothingness, pure nothingness—pure indeed, since “pure” was the only attribute that could still be attached to nothingness. And it was precisely there that Herr Settembrini revealed himself for what he truly was, the man of progress, of liberalism, of bourgeois revolution. For progress was pure nihilism, and the liberal bourgeois was in truth a man of nothingness and the Devil—yes, he denied God, the conservative, positive Absolute, and instead pledged allegiance to the devilish Anti-Absolute, and in his deadly pacifism marveled at how devout he was. Yet he was anything but devout, was a traitor to life, who deserved to be brought before the Inquisition and the Fehme, to be put to the painful question—et cetera."
"Der Weg war eben geworden. Er lief nun in der Richtung auf Platz Davos, etwa in Drittelhöhe des Hanges, und gewährte zwischen hohen, schmal gewachsenen und windschiefen Kie{83}fern den Blick auf den Ort, der weißlich in hellerem Lichte lag. Die schlicht gezimmerte Bank, auf der sie sich setzten, lehnte sich an die steile Bergwand. Neben ihnen fiel ein Wasser in offener Holzrinne gurgelnd und plätschernd zu Tal.","The path had become level. He now ran in the direction of Platz Davos, about a third of the way up the slope, and between tall, narrow and crooked pines afforded a view of the place, which lay whitish in a brighter light. The plain wooden bench on which they sat leaned against the steep mountain face. Beside them, water fell gurgling and splashing down the valley in an open wooden channel.","The path had become level. It ran now in the direction of Davos-Platz, some third of the height, and kept a continuous view, between high, sparse, wind-blown pines, of the settlement below, gleaming whitely in the bright air. The bench on which they sat leaned against the steep wall of the mountain-side, and near them a spring in an open wooden trough ran gurgling and plashing to the valley.","They were now about a third of the way up the hill, but the path had leveled out, heading now in the direction of Davos-Platz. From between the tall firs and a few stunted ones bent by the wind, the view looked down on the village, which lay white under a brighter sky. The rudely fashioned bench on which they sat had its back to the steep slope. Water fell in an open wooden trough beside them, gurgling and splashing on its way to the valley."
"»Na, so was!« sagte er zwischen den Zähnen und machte halt. Pathetischer drückte er sich nicht aus, obgleich es ihm einen Augenblick war, als griffe eine eiskalte Hand nach seinem Herzen, so daß es aufzuckte und dann mit so raschen Schlägen gegen seine Rippen pochte wie damals, als Radamanthys die feuchte Stelle bei ihm entdeckt. Denn er sah ein, daß er kein Recht hatte auf große Worte und Gebärden, da Herausforderung sein Teil gewesen und alle Bedenklichkeiten der Lage auf seine eigenste Rechnung kamen. »Nicht schlecht«, sagte er und fühlte, daß seine Gesichtszüge, die Ausdrucksmuskeln seiner Miene, der Seele nicht mehr gehorchten und gar nichts wiederzugeben vermochten, weder Furcht, noch Wut, noch Verachtung, denn sie waren erstarrt. »Was nun? Hier schräg hinunter und fortan hübsch der Nase nach, immer genau gegen den Wind. Das ist zwar leichter gesagt als getan«, fuhr er keuchend und abgerissen, aber tatsächlich halblaut sprechend fort, indem er sich wieder in Bewegung setzte: »aber geschehen muß etwas, ich kann mich nicht hinsetzen und warten, denn dann werde ich zugedeckt von hexagonaler Regelmäßigkeit, und Settembrini, wenn er mit seinem Hörnchen kommt, um nach mir zu sehen, findet mich hier mit Glasaugen hocken, eine Schneemütze schief auf dem Kopf …« Er nahm wahr, daß er mit sich selber sprach, und zwar etwas sonderbar. Darum verwies er es sich, tat es aber wiederum halblaut und ausdrücklich, obgleich seine Lippen so lahm waren, daß er auf ihre Benut{730}zung verzichtete und ohne die Konsonanten sprach, die mit ihrer Hilfe gebildet werden, was ihn selbst an eine frühere Lebenslage erinnerte, in der es ebenso gewesen war. »Schweig still und sieh, daß du fortkommst«, sagte er und fügte hinzu: »Mir scheint, du faselst und bist nicht ganz klar im Kopf. Das ist schlimm in gewisser Hinsicht.«","he said between his teeth and stopped. He did not express himself more pathetically, although for a moment it seemed to him that an icy hand grasped his heart, so that it jumped and then throbbed in his ribs with the rapid beating it had felt when Radamanthys discovered the wet spot. For he saw that he had no right to big words and gestures, since the challenge was his part and all the uncertainties of the situation were his own responsibility. ""Not bad,"" he said, feeling that his facial features, the expressive muscles of his expression, no longer obeyed his soul and could express nothing at all, neither fear, nor anger, nor contempt, for they were frozen. ""What now? Here diagonally down and henceforth pretty to the nose, always exactly against the wind. Easier said than done,' he continued, panting and ragged, but actually speaking under his breath, as he started moving again: 'but something has to happen, I can't sit down and wait, because then I'll be covered by hexagonal Regularity, and Settembrini, when he comes with his squirrel to check on me, finds me sitting here with glass eyes, a snow cap askew on my head...' He found himself talking to himself, and a little oddly so. Therefore he rebuked himself, but did it again in a low voice and explicitly, although his lips were so lame that he gave up using them and spoke without the consonants which are formed with their help, which reminded him of an earlier one living situation in which it had also been. ""Be quiet and see that you're getting on,"" he said, adding: ""It seems to me you're rambling and your head isn't quite clear. That's bad in a way.""","“No, you don’t,” said he, suddenly, between his teeth, and halted. The words were not emotional, yet he felt for a second as though his heart had been clutched by an icy hand; it winced, and then knocked rapidly against his ribs, as it had the time Rhadamanthus found the moist cavity. Pathos in the grand manner was not in place, he knew, in one who had chosen defiance as his rôle, and was indebted to himself alone for all his present plight. “Not bad,” he said, and discovered that his facial muscles were not his to command, that he could not express in his face any of his soul’s emotions, for that it was stiff with cold. “What next? Down this slope; follow your nose home, I suppose, and keep your face to the wind—though that is a good deal easier said than done,” he went on, panting with his efforts, yet actually speaking half aloud, as he tried to move on again: “but something has to happen, I can’t sit down and wait, I should simply be buried in six-sided crystalline symmetricality, and Settembrini, when he came with his little horn to find me, would see me squatting here with a snow-cap over one ear.” He realized that he was talking to himself, and not too sensibly—for which he took himself to task, and then continued on purpose, though his lips were so stiff he could not shape the labials, and so did without them, as he had on a certain other occasion that came to his mind. “Keep quiet, and get along with you out of here,” he admonished himself, adding: “You seem to be woolgathering, not quite right in your head, and that looks bad for you.”","he said between his teeth and pulled up short. He did not choose words full of pathos, although it seemed to him at that moment as if an icy hand had gripped his heart, making it twitch and then hammer rapidly against his ribs, just as it had the day Rhadamanthus first discovered the moist spot on his lung. For he realized he had no right to grand words and gestures—he had chosen defiance and all the hazards of his present situation could be chalked up against himself alone. “Not bad,” he said and felt how his facial features, the muscles governing the expression on his face, no longer obeyed his will and were incapable of revealing anything, whether fear, rage, or disdain—they were frozen. “What now? Down across here and then straight ahead, following my nose right into the wind? Easier said than done,” he added with a choked gasp, but all the same went on speaking in a whisper as he forced himself into motion again. “But I have to do something, I can’t just sit down and wait here until I’m covered beneath hexagonal symmetry. And then when Settembrini comes to check up on me with his little horn, he’ll find me squatting here with eyes turned to glass, a snowy cap cocked to one side.” He realized he was talking to himself—and saying rather strange things at that. He reprimanded himself for it, but went right on, sotto voce, but emphatically, even though his lips were so numb that he did not bother to use them and spoke without the consonants that they helped form, which then reminded him of a previous occasion on which the same thing had happened. “Shut up and try to make some progress here,” he said. And then he added, “It seems to me you’re talking drivel, that you’re a little muddleheaded. And in certain respects, that is not good.”"
"Ja, Selbstüberwindung, das mochte wohl das Wesen der Überwindung dieser Liebe sein, – dieses Seelenzaubers mit fin{990}steren Konsequenzen!

O, er war mächtig, der Seelenzauber! Wir alle waren seine Söhne, und Mächtiges konnten wir ausrichten auf Erden, indem wir ihm dienten. Man brauchte nicht mehr Genie, nur viel mehr Talent, als der Autor des Lindenbaumliedes, um als Seelenzauberkünstler dem Liede Riesenmaße zu geben und die Welt damit zu unterwerfen. Man mochte wahrscheinlich sogar Reiche darauf gründen, irdisch-allzu irdische Reiche, sehr derb und fortschrittsfroh und eigentlich gar nicht heimwehkrank, – in welchen das Lied zur elektrischen Grammophonmusik verdarb.

Oh, it was powerful, the magic of the soul! We were all his sons, and we could accomplish great things on earth by serving him. It didn't take more genius than the author of the Lindenbaumlied, just much more talent, to be a magician of the soul, to give the song gigantic proportions and to subjugate the world with it.

"Joachim ging, und es kam die »Mittagssuppe«: ein einfältig symbolischer Name für das, was kam! Denn Hans Castorp war nicht auf Krankenkost gesetzt, – warum auch hätte man ihn darauf setzen sollen? Krankenkost, schmale Kost war auf keine Art indiziert bei seinem Zustande. Er lag hier und zahlte den vollen Preis, und was man ihm bringt in der stehenden Ewigkeit dieser Stunde, das ist keine »Mittagssuppe«, es ist das sechsgängige Berghof-Diner ohne Abzug und in aller Ausführlichkeit, – am Alltage üppig, am Sonntage ein Gala-, Lust- und Parademahl, von einem europäisch erzogenen Chef in der Luxushotelküche der Anstalt bereitet. Die Saaltochter, deren Amt es war, die Bettlägrigen zu versorgen, brachte es ihm unter vernickelten Hohldeckeln und in leckeren Tiegeln; sie schob den Krankentisch, der sich eingefunden, dies einbeinige Wunder von Gleichgewichtskonstruktion, quer über sein Bett vor ihn hin, und Hans Castorp tafelte daran wie der Sohn des Schneiders am Tischlein deck dich.","Joachim went, and ""Lunchtime Soup"" came: a simple symbolic name for what was coming! Because Hans Castorp was not put on sick food - why should he have been put on it? Sick diet, small fare, was in no way indicated in his condition. He lay here and paid the full price, and what is brought to him in the standing eternity of this hour is not a ""lunchtime soup,"" it is the six-course Berghof dinner without deduction and in great detail - sumptuous in everyday life, closed on Sundays Gala, pleasure and parade meal, prepared by a European-educated chef in the luxury hotel kitchen of the institution. The maid, whose job it was to look after the bedridden, brought it to him under nickel-plated hollow lids and in delicious jars; She pushed the patient's table that appeared, this one-legged marvel of balanced construction, across his bed in front of him, and Hans Castorp ate at it like the tailor's son at the little table, cover yourself.","Joachim went down, and the “midday broth” was brought—“broth” in a symbolic sense merely, considering in what it consisted. Hans Castorp was not on sick-diet. He lay there and paid full pension, and what they brought him in the abiding present of that midday hour was by no means broth, it was the full six-course Berghof dinner, in all its amplitude, with nothing left out. Even on week-days this was a sumptuous meal; on Sundays it was a gala banquet and “gaudy,” prepared by a cosmopolitan chef in the kitchens of the establishment, which were precisely those of a European hotel de luxe. The “dining-room girl” whose duty it was to serve the bedridden brought it to him in dainty cook-pots under nickel-plated dish-covers. She produced an invalid-table, a marvel of one-legged equilibrium, adjusted it across his bed, and Hans Castorp banqueted like the tailor’s son in the fairy-story.","Joachim would leave, and the “midday soup” would arrive—soup was the simplified, symbolic name for what came. Because Hans Castorp was not on a restricted diet—why should he have been? A restricted diet, short commons, would hardly have been appropriate to his condition. There he lay, paying full price, and what they brought him at this hour of fixed eternity was “midday soup,” the six-course Berghof dinner in all its splendor, with nothing missing—a hearty meal six days a week, a sumptuous showpiece, a gala banquet, prepared by a trained European chef in the sanatorium’s deluxe hotel kitchen. The dining attendant whose job it was to care for bedridden patients would bring it to him, a series of tasty dishes arranged under domed nickel covers. She would shove over the bed table, which was now part of the furniture, a marvel of one-legged equilibrium, adjust it across his bed in front of him, and Hans Castorp would dine from it like the tailor’s son who dined from a magic table."
"Ja, sagte Hans Castorp, ihr Beruf sei gewiß schwer, aber doch auch befriedigend, sollte er denken.","Yes, said Hans Castorp, her job is certainly difficult, but it's also satisfying, he should think.","Yes, Hans Castorp said, her calling was a hard one, but satisfying, he should think.","Yes, Hans Castorp said, her profession was certainly difficult, but it did have its satisfactions, or so he would presume."
"So ging es mit Wiedemann und Sonnenschein. Alle, die es sahen, bebten noch stundenlang. Es ist vergleichsweise eine Wohltat, im Gegensatz zu solcher Misere von einem wahren Ehrenhandel zu erzählen, der ebenfalls dieser Periode angehört, und der seinen Namen allerdings, der formalen Feierlichkeit wegen, mit der er gehandhabt wurde, bis zur Lächerlichkeit verdiente. Hans Castorp wohnte ihm in seinen einzelnen Phasen nicht bei, sondern belehrte sich über den verwickelten und dramatischen Hergang nur an der Hand von Dokumenten, Erklärungen und Protokollen, die, diese Sache betreffend, im Hause Berghof und außerhalb seiner, nämlich nicht nur am Ort, im Kanton, im Lande, sondern auch im Auslande und in Amerika abschriftlich vertrieben und auch solchen zum Studium zugestellt wurden, von denen ohne weiteres sicher sein mußte, daß sie der Angelegenheit auch nicht einen Deut von Teilnahme widmen konnten und wollten.","That's how it went with Wiedemann and sunshine. All who saw it continued to tremble for hours. It is comparatively a blessing, in contrast to such misery, to tell of a true bargain of honour, which also belongs to this period and which certainly deserved its name to the point of ridicule because of the formal solemnity with which it was handled. Hans Castorp did not attend its individual phases, but informed himself about the complicated and dramatic course of events only by means of documents, declarations and protocols, which, concerning this matter, were kept in the Berghof house and outside of him, namely not only at the place copies were distributed in the canton, in the country, but also abroad and in America, and were also sent to those for study who had to be sure that they could not and did not want to devote the least bit of interest to the matter.","Thus Wiedemann and Sonnenschein. All those who saw the encounter trembled hours after. Let us turn from it to a real affair of honour, which by contrast with such ignominy will seem almost refreshing. This affair of honour occurred at about the same period, and, on account of the solemn formality with which it was conducted, deserved the name, even to the point of absurdity. Hans Castorp did not assist in person at the successive episodes; but was informed of its involved and dramatic course by means of certain documents, protocols and formal declarations, touching the affair, circulated not only in the house and without, not only in the village, the canton, and the country, but even abroad and in America; and presented for the consideration of persons who most certainly were not in the faintest degree interested in the circumstances.","That was the Wiedemann-Sonnenschein affair. Everyone who witnessed it was still quivering hours later. In contrast to such misery, it is a comparative pleasure to tell about a genuine “affair of honor” that belongs to this same period and that definitely deserves the name, absurdly so, given the solemn formality with which it was carried out. Hans Castorp was not present at its various phases, but only learned about the complicated and dramatic course of events from documents, affidavits, and official minutes devoted to the affair, copies of which were circulated not only in the Berghof, not only in Davos, in the canton of Graubünden, in Switzerland, but also abroad, were sent as far as America, and were made available for study to persons who, one can be sure, would not and could not pay one whit of attention to the matter."
"Na, allerdings, meinte Hans Castorp, so ganz geheuer sei es ja wohl gerade nicht mit Naphta, ein bißchen sonderbar muteten seine Reden wohl manchmal an; es hätte ja geradezu geklungen, als wollte er wahrhaben, daß die Sonne sich um die Erde drehe. Doch schließlich, wie hätten sie, die Vettern, auf den Gedanken kommen sollen, es könne unratsam sein, mit einem Freunde von ihm, Settembrini, in gesellschaftlichen Verkehr zu treten? Er sage es selbst: durch ihn hätten sie Naphta kennengelernt, mit ihm hätten sie ihn getroffen, er gehe mit ihm spazieren, er komme zwanglos zu ihm zum Tee herunter; das beweise doch –","Well, of course, said Hans Castorp, it wasn't all that easy with naphtha, his speeches sometimes sounded a bit strange; it would have sounded almost as if he wanted to admit that the sun revolved around the earth. After all, how could they, the cousins, have thought that it might be inadvisable to socialize with a friend of his, Settembrini? He says it himself: they met Naphta through him, they met him with him, he goes for walks with him, he comes down to tea with him informally; that proves it -","“He does seem rather weird,” was Hans Castorp’s view. “Some of the things he said were very queer: it sounded as if he meant to say that the sun revolves round the earth.” But how could they, he went on, have suspected that a friend of his, Herr Settembrini’s, was an unsuitable person for them to associate with? As he himself admitted, they had made the acquaintance through him, had met the man first in his company, and seen that the two walked and took tea together.","Well, yes, that was true, Hans Castorp suggested, there was something a little uncanny about Naphta, he did say some rather strange things at times; it had almost sounded as if he really believed the sun revolved around the earth. But all in all, how could they, the cousins, ever have concluded it might be unadvisable to associate with one of his, Herr Settembrini’s, friends? He had said himself it was through him that they had made Naphta’s acquaintance; they had met him in his, Settembrini’s, company—and he took walks with him, came down to tea all on his own. All of which proved—"
"Die Ärzte kamen und mischten sich unter die Kurgesellschaft, Hofrat Behrens in weißem und Dr. Krokowski in schwarzem Kittel. Sie gingen die Reihe der Tischchen entlang, wobei der Hofrat beinahe an jedem ein gemütliches Witzwort fallen ließ, so daß ein Kielwasser heiterer Bewegung seinen Weg bezeichnete, und stiegen dann zur Jugend hinab, deren weiblicher Teil sich sofort mit Wippen und schrägen Blicken um Dr. Krokowski scharte, während der Hofrat dem Sonntage zu Ehren der Herrenwelt das Kunststück mit seinem Schnürstiefel zeigte: er setzte seinen gewaltigen Fuß auf eine höhere Stufe, löste die Bänder, ergriff sie nach einer besonderen Praktik mit einer Hand und wußte sie, ohne die andere zu Hilfe zu nehmen, mit solcher Fertigkeit kreuzweise einzuhaken, daß alle sich wunderten und mehrere umsonst versuchten, es ihm gleichzutun.","The doctors came and mingled with the spa society, Hofrat Behrens in white and Dr. Krokowski in a black coat. They walked down the row of little tables, the Councilor dropping a pleasant witticism at almost every one, so that a wake of cheerful movement marked his way, and then descended to the youth, whose female part immediately turned to Dr. Krokowski rallied, while the Councilor showed Sunday the trick with his lace-up boot in honor of the gentlemen: he put his mighty foot on a higher step, undid the laces, seized them with one hand, according to a special practice, and closed them without the other to take help, hooking crosswise with such skill that everyone was amazed and several tried in vain to do the same.","The physicians came and mingled with the guests of the cure, Hofrat Behrens in his white smock, Krokowski in his black. They passed along the row of tables, the Hofrat letting fall a pleasantry at nearly every one, till a wave of merriment followed in his wake; and so down the steps among the young folk, the female element of which straightway trooped up sidling and becking about Dr. Krokowski, while the Hofrat honoured the sabbath by performing a “stunt” with his bootlaces before the gentlemen’s eyes. He rested one mighty foot upon a step, unfastened the laces, gripped them with practised technique in one hand, and without employing the other, hooked them up again crosswise, with such speed and agility that the beholders marvelled, and many of them tried to emulate him, but in vain.","The doctors arrived and mingled among the hotel guests— Director Behrens in his white smock, Dr. Krokowski in his black. They walked along the rows of tables, the director dispensing a casual, witty remark to almost everyone, so that a wake of mirth rippled behind him. They now moved down to the young people, where the females, with wagging heads and sidelong glances, flocked around Dr. Krokowski. In honor of the Sabbath, the director showed the gentlemen a little stunt with his lace boots: placing one huge foot on a higher step, he undid the laces, then gathered them with a special grip in one hand, and without help of the other, crisscrossed them through the hooks so deftly that everyone stood there amazed—and several lads tried the trick out themselves, with no success."
"»Entschuldigen Sie, ich sage ja im Gegenteil … Übrigens wird Behrens sich am Ende nun doch wohl zu den Injektionen entschließen, um meine Entgiftung zu erzielen, denn ich habe unentwegt siebenunddreißig-vier, –fünf, –sechs und auch –sieben. Das will sich nicht ändern. Ich bin und bleibe nun mal ein Sorgenkind des Lebens. Langfristig bin ich ja nicht, Radamanth hat mir nie was Bestimmtes aufgebrummt, aber er sagt, es wäre sinnlos, die Kur vor der Zeit zu unterbrechen, wo ich nun doch schon so lange hier oben bin und soviel Zeit investiert habe, sozusagen. Was nützte es auch, wenn er mir einen Termin setzte? Das hätte nicht viel zu bedeuten, denn wenn er zum Beispiel sagt: ein halbes Jährchen, so ist es sehr knapp gerechnet, man muß sich auf mehr gefaßt machen. Das sieht man an meinem Vetter, der sollte Anfang des Monats fertig sein – fertig {490}im Sinne von ausgeheilt –, aber das letztemal hat Behrens ihm vier Monate zugelegt, zu seiner völligen Ausheilung, – na, und was haben wir dann? Dann haben wir Sommersonnenwende, wie ich sagte, ohne daß ich Sie reizen wollte, und es geht wieder auf den Winter zu. Aber für den Augenblick haben wir nun freilich erst einmal Fastnacht, – Sie hören ja, ich finde es gut und schön, daß wir hier alles der Reihe nach, und wie’s im Kalender steht, begehen. Frau Stöhr sagte, daß es in der Conciergeloge Kindertrompeten zu kaufen gibt?«","'Excuse me, I'm saying the opposite... By the way, Behrens will probably decide on the injections in the end to achieve my detoxification, because I'm constantly on thirty-seven-four, -five, -six and also -seven. That doesn't want to change. I am and will remain a problem child of life. I'm not long-term, Radamanth never told me anything specific, but he says there's no point in stopping the cure early when I've been up here so long and invested so much time, so to speak. What good was it if he set me an appointment? That wouldn't mean much, because if he says, for example: half a year, then it's very tight, you have to be prepared for more. You can see that in my cousin, he should be ready at the beginning of the month - finished {490}in the sense of healed - but the last time Behrens added four months to his complete healing - well, and what do we have then? Then we have the summer solstice, as I said without wanting to irritate you, and winter is approaching again. But for the moment we have Fastnacht, of course - you hear me, I think it's good and nice that we're celebrating everything here in the order it's written in the calendar. Frau Stoehr said that children's trumpets can be bought in the concierge room?""","“Pardon me, I mean it just the other way. Behrens will finally have to make up his mind to the injections, to get rid of my infection; my temperature sticks at 99.3° to four, five, six, and even seven. I am, and I continue to be, life’s delicate child! I don’t mean I am a long-termer , Rhadamanthus hasn’t let me in for any definite number of months; but he did say it would be nonsense to interrupt the cure, when I’ve been up here so long already, and invested so much time, so to speak. Even if he did set a term, what good would it do me? When he says, for instance, half a year, that is to be taken as the minimum, it is always more. Look at my cousin; he was to have finished the beginning of the month— finished in the sense of being healed, cured—and the last time Behrens saw him, he stuck on four more to make sure he is entirely sound— well, then, where are we? Why, at the summer solstice, just as I said, without the faintest notion of offending you, and on the way to winter. Well, well, for the present what we have before us is Fasching, and as I say, I consider it fit and proper to celebrate it in the usual way, just as it comes in the calender. Frau Stöhr tells me the concierge sells tin horns in his lodge, did you know that?”","“Beg your pardon, I really meant just the opposite. By the way, Behrens will probably decide sooner or later to use injections to try to detoxify me, because I’m constantly at ninety-nine point three, point five, point seven, even point nine. It simply never changes. I am and shall remain one of life’s problem children— not that I’m a long-termer. Rhadamanthus has never saddled me with any sentence, but he says it would be pointless to interrupt my cure too soon, especially since I’ve been up here for so long now—have invested so much time, so to speak. And what good would it do if he were to set a date? It wouldn’t mean all that much, because if he says six months, for example, that’s always a low estimate—you have to be ready for more. You can see that with my cousin here, who was supposed to be finished by the first of the month—finished in the sense of cured—but at his last checkup Behrens said it would take another four months for him to heal completely. Well, and where are we then? Why, Midsummer Night, just as I said—but not because I wanted to offend you. And then we start heading toward winter. But at the moment we’re about to celebrate Mardi Gras, of course. And as you heard I’m all in favor of that, of celebrating things as they come, just as the calendar dictates. Frau Stöhr mentioned that we can get little toy trumpets at the concierge’s desk, is that right?”"
"Sie hatten den erhöhten Tisch am Fenster genommen, den hübschesten Platz. An dem cremefarbenen Vorhang saßen sie einander gegenüber, die Gesichter beglüht vom Schein des rot umhüllten elektrischen Tischlämpchens. Hans Castorp faltete seine frisch gewaschenen Hände und rieb sie behaglich-erwartungsvoll aneinander, wie er zu tun pflegte, wenn er sich zu Tische setzte, – vielleicht weil seine Vorfahren vor der Suppe gebetet hatten. Ein freundliches, gaumig sprechendes Mäd{27}chen in schwarzem Kleide mit weißer Schürze und einem großen Gesicht von überaus gesunder Farbe bediente sie, und zu seiner großen Heiterkeit ließ Hans Castorp sich belehren, daß man die Kellnerinnen hier »Saaltöchter« nenne. Sie bestellten eine Flasche Gruaud Larose bei ihr, die Hans Castorp noch einmal fortschickte, um sie besser temperieren zu lassen. Das Essen war vorzüglich. Es gab Spargelsuppe, gefüllte Tomaten, Braten mit vielerlei Zutat, eine besonders gut bereitete süße Speise, eine Käseplatte und Obst. Hans Castorp aß sehr stark, obgleich sein Appetit sich nicht als so lebhaft erwies, wie er geglaubt hatte. Aber er war gewohnt, viel zu essen, auch wenn er keinen Hunger hatte, und zwar aus Selbstachtung.","They had taken the raised table by the window, the prettiest spot. They sat opposite each other by the cream-colored curtain, their faces glowing in the glow of the red-coated electric table lamp. Hans Castorp clasped his freshly washed hands and rubbed them together expectantly, as he used to do when he sat down at the table - perhaps because his ancestors had prayed before the soup. A friendly, mouth-watering girl in a black dress with a white apron and a large face of an extremely healthy complexion served them, and to his great amusement Hans Castorp allowed himself to be taught that the waitresses here are called ""waitresses"". They ordered a bottle of Gruaud Larose from her, which Hans Castorp sent off again to have it tempered better. The food was excellent. There was asparagus soup, stuffed tomatoes, roasts with many ingredients, a particularly well-prepared sweet dish, a cheese platter and fruit. Hans Castorp ate very heavily, although his appetite did not prove as lively as he had thought. But he was used to eating a lot even when he wasn't hungry, out of self-respect.","They had sat down at the raised table in the window, the pleasantest spot in the room, facing each other against the cream-coloured hangings, their faces lighted by the red-shaded table-lamp. Hans Castorp clasped his freshly washed hands and rubbed them together in agreeable anticipation—a habit of his when he sat down to table, perhaps because his ancestors had said grace before meat. They were served by a friendly maid in black frock and white apron. She had a pleasant, throaty voice, and her broad face was indisputably healthy-coloured. To his great amusement, Hans Castorp learned that the waitresses here were called “dining-room girls.” They ordered a bottle of Gruaud Larose, and Hans Castorp sent it back to have it warmed. The food was excellent: asparagus soup, stuffed tomatoes, a roast with vegetables, an exceedingly well-prepared sweet, cheese, and fruit. Hans Castorp ate heartily, though his appetite did not turn out quite so stout as he had thought. But he always ate a good deal, out of pure self-respect, even when he was not hungry.","They had taken the raised table beside a window hung with cream-colored curtains—the nicest table in the room.

They were waited on by a friendly girl in a black dress and white apron, whose large face glowed with robust health and who spoke in a guttural dialect. To his great amusement, Hans Castorp was instructed that waitresses here were called “dining attendants.” They ordered a bottle of Gruaud Larose, which Hans Castorp sent back to be brought to room temperature. The food was excellent. There was asparagus soup, followed by stuffed tomatoes, a roast with several vegetables, an especially well done dessert, and a tray of cheese and fruit.

"Später im Lauf des Tages, nach der Mittagsmahlzeit, nach dem Diner, hatte er Zuhörer bei seinem Treiben, wechselndes Publikum, – wenn man ihn selbst nicht als solches, sondern als Spender des Genusses betrachten wollte. Persönlich neigte er {973}zu dieser Auffassung, und die Hausgesellschaft bewilligte sie ihm in dem Sinne, daß sie seiner entschlossenen Selbsteinsetzung als Verwalter und Kustos der öffentlichen Einrichtung von Anfang an stillschweigend zustimmte. Das kostete diese Leute nichts; denn ungeachtet ihres oberflächlichen Entzükkens, wenn jener tenorale Abgott in Schmelz und Glanz schwelgte, die weltbeglückende Stimme in Kantilenen und hohen Künsten der Leidenschaft sich verströmte, – trotz dieses laut bekundeten Entzückens waren sie ohne Liebe und darum völlig einverstanden, jedem, der da wollte, die Sorge zu lassen. Hans Castorp war es, der den Plattenschatz in Ordnung hielt, den Inhalt der Alben auf die Innenseite der Deckel schrieb, so daß ein jegliches Stück auf Wunsch und Anruf sofort zur Hand war, und der das Instrument handhabte: Man sah es ihn mit bald geübten, knappen und zarten Bewegungen tun. Was hätten auch die anderen gemacht? Sie hätten die Platten geschändet, indem sie sie mit abgenutzten Nadeln bearbeiteten, hätten sie offen auf Stühlen herumliegen lassen, mit dem Apparat stumpfen Jux getrieben, indem sie ein edles Stück mit Tempo und Tonhöhe hundertundzehn laufen ließen oder auch den Zeiger auf Null einstellten, so daß es ein hysterisches Tirili oder ein versacktes Stöhnen ergab … Sie hatten das alles schon getan. Sie waren zwar krank, aber roh. Und darum trug Hans Castorp nach kurzer Zeit den Schlüssel des Schränkchens, worin die Alben und Nadeln aufbewahrt wurden, einfach in der Tasche, so daß man ihn rufen mußte, wenn man aufgespielt haben wollte.","Later in the day, after lunch, after dinner, he had audiences listening to what he was doing, a changing audience—if you didn't want to look at him as such, but as a source of pleasure. Personally, he leaned towards this view, and the house society granted it to him in the sense that they tacitly approved of his resolute self-appointment as administrator and custodian of the public institution from the very beginning. It didn't cost these people anything; for regardless of their superficial delight when that tenoral idol wallowed in luster and splendor, the world-blessing voice emanated in cantilenas and the high arts of passion - in spite of this loudly professed delight they were without love and therefore completely in agreement with anyone who wanted to to let go of the worry. It was Hans Castorp who kept the disc treasury in order, wrote the contents of the albums on the inside of the cover so that any piece was immediately at hand on request and when called, and who handled the instrument: you could see him with soon practiced players , do tight and delicate movements. What would the others have done? They would have desecrated the records by working them with worn needles, would have left them lying around openly on chairs, would have made dull jokes with the apparatus by running a noble piece with a tempo and pitch of one hundred and ten, or set the pointer to zero, like that that it resulted in a hysterical tirili, or a stifled moan... They had done all that before. They were sick but raw. And that's why Hans Castorp soon carried the key to the cupboard in which the albums and needles were kept in his pocket, so that you had to call him when you wanted to have it played.","Later in the day, after the noon and evening meals, he had a changing audience for his performance—unless one must reckon him in with the audience, instead of as the dispenser of the entertainment. Personally he inclined to the latter view. And the Berghof population agreed with him, to the extent that from the very first night they silently acquiesced in his self-appointed guardianship of the instrument. They did not care, these people. Aside from their ephemeral idolatry of the tenor, luxuriating in the melting brilliance of his own voice, letting this boon to the human race stream from him in cantilenas and high feats of virtuosity, notwithstanding their loudly proclaimed enthusiasm, they were without real love for the instrument, and content that anyone should operate it who was willing to take the trouble. It was Hans Castorp who kept the records in order, wrote the contents of each album on the inside of the cover, so that each piece might be found at once when it was wanted, and “ran” the instrument. Soon he did it with ease and dexterity. The others would have spoiled the plates by using worn-out needles, would have left them lying about on chairs, would have tried all sorts of imbecile tricks, playing some noble and stately piece of music at breakneck speed and pitch, or setting the indicator at zero, so that nothing but a hysterical trilling or a long expiring groan came from the instrument. They had tried all that already. Of course, they were ill; but they were also pretty crude. After a while, Hans Castorp simply took the key of the little cabinet that held the needles and albums, and kept it in his pocket, so that his permission must needs be asked if anyone desired to play.","Later that day, after both the noon meal and supper, there were other listeners, a constantly changing audience—that is if you did not count Hans Castorp himself as part of the audience but as the dispenser of these pleasures. He was himself inclined to this latter view, and his fellow residents granted him as much, at least in the sense that, from the very beginning, they silently acquiesced in his determined self-appointment as administrator and custodian of this public facility. It cost them nothing; for apart from the superficial thrills of listening to their idolized tenor wallow in molten splendor, to a voice surging in a cantabile that blessed the world with the high arts of passion— apart from such thrills, they had no love for the instrument and were quite willing to let anyone who liked take care of it. It was Hans Castorp, then, who kept the treasured disks in order, writing the contents of each album on the inside of its cover so that every piece was immediately accessible upon request, and who operated the instrument itself—they soon noticed how deftly and gently he went about it once he had some practice. And how would the others have treated it? They would have ruined the records by playing them with used needles and leaving them lying around just anywhere on chairs, would have used the apparatus for stupid jokes like playing some sublime piece with the dial set at a speed of 110 or 0, yielding hysteric tweets or intermittent groans. They had already done it. They might be ill, but they were crude. And that was why within a very short time, Hans Castorp simply pocketed the key to the cupboard containing the albums and needles and had to be called if someone wanted to play records."

"»Sehr netter Mann«, sagte Hans Castorp, als sie nach freundschaftlicher Begrüßung mit dem hinkenden Concierge, der in seiner Loge Briefe ordnete, durch das Portal hinaus ins Freie traten. Das Portal war an der Südostflanke des weißgetünchten Gebäudes gelegen, dessen mittlerer Teil die beiden Flügel um ein Stockwerk überragte und von einem kurzen, mit schieferfarbenem Eisenblech gedeckten Uhrturm gekrönt war. Man berührte den eingezäunten Garten nicht, wenn man das Haus hier verließ, sondern war gleich im Freien, angesichts schräger Bergwiesen, die von vereinzelten, mäßig hohen Fichten und auf den Boden geduckten Krummholzkiefern bestanden waren. Der Weg, den sie einschlugen – eigentlich war es der einzige, der in Betracht kam, außer der zu Tale abfallenden Fahrstraße –, leitete sie leicht ansteigend nach links an der Rückseite des Sanatoriums vorbei, der Küchen- und Wirtschaftsseite, wo eiserne Abfalltonnen an den Gittern der Kellertreppen standen, lief noch ein gutes Stück in derselben Richtung fort, beschrieb dann ein scharfes Knie und führte steiler nach rechts hin den dünn bewaldeten Hang hinan. Es war ein harter, rötlich gefärb{76}ter, noch etwas feuchter Weg, an dessen Saume zuweilen Steinblöcke lagen. Die Vettern sahen sich keineswegs allein auf der Promenade. Gäste, die gleich nach ihnen ihr Frühstück beendet, folgten ihnen auf dem Fuße, und ganze Gruppen, auf dem Rückweg, kamen ihnen mit den stapfenden Tritten absteigender Leute entgegen.","""Very nice man,"" said Hans Castorp, when, after a friendly greeting with the limping concierge, who was sorting letters in his box, they stepped out through the portal. The portal was situated on the south-eastern flank of the whitewashed building, the central part of which was a story higher than the two wings and topped by a short clock tower covered with slate-colored sheet iron. You didn't touch the fenced-in garden when you left the house here, but were immediately outside, in the face of sloping mountain meadows, which consisted of isolated, moderately tall spruces and crooked pines that crouched on the ground. The path they took - actually it was the only one that came into consideration, apart from the road sloping down to the valley - led them slightly uphill to the left at the back of the sanatorium, the kitchen and service side, where iron garbage cans at the latticework of the cellar stairs, ran a good distance further in the same direction, then described a sharp knee and led steeper to the right up the sparsely wooded slope. It was a hard, reddish-colored, {76} still somewhat damp path, at the edge of which there were sometimes boulders. The cousins were by no means alone on the promenade. Guests who finished their breakfast immediately after them followed on their heels, and whole groups, on the way back, met them with the stomping footsteps of people dismounting.","“VERY nice man,” Hans Castorp said, as after a friendly nod to the lame concierge, who was sorting letters in his lodge, they passed out into the open air. The main entrance was on the south-west side of the white building, the central portion of which was a storey higher than the wings, and crowned by a turret with a roof of slatecoloured tin. You did not issue from this side into the hedged-in garden, but were immediately in the open, in sight of the steep mountain meadows, dotted with single fir-trees of moderate size, and writhen, stunted pines. The way they took—it was the only one they could take, outside the drive going down to the valley—rose by a gentle ascent to the left, behind the sanatorium, past the kitchen and domestic offices, where huge dustbins stood at the area rails. Thence it led in the same direction for a goodish piece, then made a sharp bend to the right and mounted more rapidly along the thinly wooded slopes. It was a reddish path, firm and yet rather moist underfoot, with boulders here and there along the edge. The cousins were by no means alone upon it: guests who had finished breakfast not long after them followed hard upon their steps, and groups of others, already returning, approached with the stalking gait of people descending a steep incline.","“Very nice man,” Hans Castorp said as they walked out the front door, with a friendly nod to the limping concierge, who was sitting in his office sorting letters. The main door was on the southeast side of the large white building, whose middle section rose one story higher than the two wings and was crowned by a clock tower roofed with slate-colored sheet iron. Leaving the building by this exit, you did not approach the garden, but came out facing directly onto an open slope of mountain meadows, dotted with a few tallish firs and several low mountain pines that hugged the ground. The path they took—actually it was the only one available other than the main road that descended to the valley—led them gently up the rise to their left, past the rear of the sanatorium, where the kitchens and offices were located and steel garbage cans lined the railing beside the cellar stairs, and held to that direction for a good distance, then made a sharp hairpin to the right and began a steeper ascent up the sparsely wooded hill. It was a firm earthen path, reddish in color and a little damp, with boulders here and there along the edge. The cousins quickly learned that they were not alone on their walk. Guests who had finished breakfast shortly after them followed on their heels, and coming toward them were whole groups of people on their way back, stomping the way people tend to do walking downhill."
"Da fand er sich auf einmal in jene frühe Lebenslage versetzt, die das Urbild eines nach neuesten Eindrücken gemodelten Traumes war, den er vor einigen Nächten geträumt … Aber so stark, so restlos, so bis zur Aufhebung des Raumes und der Zeit war er ins Dort und Damals entrückt, daß man hätte sagen können, ein lebloser Körper liege hier oben beim Gießbache auf der Bank, während der eigentliche Hans Castorp weit fort in früherer Zeit und Umgebung stünde, und zwar in einer bei aller Einfachheit gewagten und herzberauschenden Situation.","Suddenly he found himself placed in that early life situation that was the archetype of a dream modeled on the latest impressions that he dreamed a few nights ago... But he was so strong, so complete, so far into the abolition of space and time he was there And then enraptured that one could have said that a lifeless body was lying up here on the bench by the Gießbache, while the real Hans Castorp was standing far away in earlier times and surroundings, and indeed in a situation that was daring and heart-warming for all its simplicity.","Quite suddenly he found himself in the far distant past, transported to a scene which had come back to him in a dream some nights before, summoned by certain impressions of the last few days. But so strongly, so resistlessly, to the annihilation of time and space, was he rapt back into the past, one might have said it was a lifeless body lying here on the bench by the waterside, while the actual Hans Castorp moved in that far-away time and place—in a situation which was for him, despite its childishness, vibrant with daring and adventure.","And he found himself transported to an earlier stage of life, one which only a few nights before had served as the basis for a dream filled with more recent impressions. And as he was pulled back into the then and there, time and space were abrogated—so intensely, so totally, that one might have thought a lifeless body lay there on the bench beside the torrent, while the real Hans Castorp was moving about in an earlier time, in different surroundings, confronted by a situation that, for all its simplicity, he found both fraught with risk and filled with intoxication."
"Behrens kam aus dem Vorbau, lang und hochnackig, einen steifen Hut auf dem Hinterkopf und eine Zigarre im Munde, blaubackig und quelläugig, so recht im Zuge der Tätigkeit, im Begriffe, seiner Privatpraxis nachzugehen, Besuche im Ort zu machen, nachdem er soeben im Operationssaal am Werke gewesen, wie er erklärte.","Behrens came out of the porch, long and tall, a bowler hat on the back of his head and a cigar in his mouth, blue-cheeked and bulging eyes, really in the course of his work, on the point of going about his private practice, making visits to the town, having just arrived in the operating room at work, he explained.","Behrens came out of the vestibule, tall and stooped, a bowler hat on the back of his head, a cigar in his mouth; purple-cheeked, watery-eyed, in the full flow of his professional activities. He had just come from the operating-room, so he said, and was on his way to private practice in the village.","Behrens was just emerging from the portico—tall, with protruding neck vertebrae, a bowler shoved to the back of his head, a cigar in his mouth, purple-cheeked and pop-eyed; he was at full swing in his daily routine, about to attend to his private practice and make calls in town, having just been on the job in the operating room, as he declared."

"Da hatte Hans Castorp seine Zurechtweisung. Was gab es darauf zu erwidern? Er schwieg in bedrücktem Grübeln. Herrn Settembrinis Worte taten gefaßt und logisch, und dennoch klangen sie fremd und unnatürlich aus ihm hervor. Seine Gedanken waren nicht seine Gedanken, – wie er ja auch auf den des Zweikampfes gar nicht von selbst verfallen war, sondern ihn nur von dem terroristischen kleinen Naphta übernommen hatte –; sie waren Ausdruck der Umfangenheit durch die allgemeinen inneren Umstände, deren Knecht und Werkzeug Herrn Settembrinis schöner Verstand geworden war. Wie, das Geistige, weil es streng war, sollte unerbittlich zum Tierischen, zum Austrag durch den körperlichen Kampf führen? Hans Castorp lehnte sich auf dagegen, oder er versuchte doch, es zu tun, – um zu seinem Schrecken zu finden, daß er es auch nicht konnte. Sie waren stark auch in ihm, die inneren Umstände, er war nicht der Mann, er auch nicht, sich ihnen zu entwinden. Furchtbar und letztgültig wehte es ihn an aus jener Erinnerungsgegend, wo Wiedemann und Sonnenschein sich in ratlos tierischem Kampfe wälzten, und er begriff mit Grauen, daß am Ende aller Dinge nur das Körperliche blieb, die Nägel, die Zähne. Ja, ja, man mußte sich wohl schlagen, denn so war wenigstens jene Milderung des Urstandes durch ritterliche Regelung zu retten … Hans Castorp bot sich Herrn Settembrini als Sekundanten an.","Then Hans Castorp had his rebuke. What was the answer to that? He was silent in gloomy brooding. Mr. Settembrini's words seemed composed and logical, and yet they sounded strange and unnatural to him. His thoughts weren't his thoughts – just as he hadn't thought of the duel of his own accord, but had only taken it over from the little terrorist Naphta –; they were expressions of the expansiveness of the general inner circumstances of which Mr. Settembrini's beautiful mind had become the servant and instrument. What, the spiritual, because it was severe, should inexorably lead to the animal, to the resolution through physical combat? Hans Castorp rebelled against it, or at least tried to do so - only to find, to his horror, that he could not either. They were strong in him too, the inner circumstances, he wasn't the man, he wasn't either, to wriggle out of them. It blew at him terribly and ultimately from that region of memory where Wiedemann and sunshine wallowed in a helpless animal struggle, and he understood with horror that in the end of all things only the physical remained, the nails, the teeth. Yes, yes, one had to fight one another, because that way at least the alleviation of the original status could be saved by chivalrous regulation ... Hans Castorp offered himself to Herr Settembrini as a second.","Thus was Hans Castorp put in his place. What should he answer? He preserved a depressed and brooding silence. Herr Settembrini had spoken with composure, logically. But his words sounded strange in his mouth. His thoughts were not his own thoughts, the idea of the duel was one he would never have come upon of himself. He had only taken it over from the terroristic little Naphta. And what he said was but an expression of the strength of that prevailing temper, whose tool and underling Herr Settembrini’s fine understanding had become. What? The intellectual, simply because it was so stern, must lead relentlessly to the animal, to the issue of physical combat? Hans Castorp set himself against it—or at least he tried, only to discover, in affright, that even he was powerless to do so. In him too the prevailing temper was strong, he was not the man to win free. There was an area of his brain where memory showed him Wiedemann and Sonnenschein grappled like animals; and with horror he understood that at the end of everything only the physical remained, only the teeth and the nails. Yes, they must fight; only thus could be assured even that small mitigation of the primitive by the rules of chivalry. Hans Castorp offered to act as Herr Settembrini’s second.","That put Hans Castorp in his place. What could he reply to that? He said nothing, only brooded gloomily. Herr Settembrini’s words seemed calm and logical, and yet they sounded strange and unnatural coming from him. His thoughts were not his thoughts—just as he would never have taken the notion to fight a duel on his own, but had only adopted it from Naphta, the little terrorist; they merely showed that he, too, was enveloped by the same inner state that had possession of them all—it had enslaved Herr Settembrini’s beautiful reason, had made it its tool. What? Ideas, simply because they were rigorous, led inexorably to bestial deeds, to a settlement by physical struggle? Hans Castorp rebelled against the notion or at least tried to do so—only to find to his horror that he could not. That inner state was strong within him, too; he was not the man—not he, either—to extricate himself from it. From his fund of memories came the dreadful, last visions of Wiedemann and Sonnenschein helplessly rolling in bestial struggle; and he shuddered as he realized that in the end it is only the physical that remains—the nails, the teeth. Yes, yes, they would probably have to fight; that way matters might at least be salvaged by chivalrous rules that moderated the primal state. Hans Castorp offered to serve as Herr Settembrini’s second."
"Da war Joachim, der gute, ehrenfeste Joachim an seiner Seite, dessen Augen in diesen Monaten einen so traurigen Ausdruck angenommen, und der zuweilen so wegwerfend-heftig mit den Achseln zuckte, wie er es früher nie und nimmer getan, – Joachim mit dem »Blauen Heinrich« in der Tasche, wie Frau Stöhr dies Gerät zu bezeichnen pflegte: mit einem so störrisch schamlosen Gesicht, daß es Hans Castorp jedesmal in der Seele ent{225}setzte … Der redliche Joachim also war da, der Hofrat Behrens tirrte und plagte, um fortzukommen und in der »Ebene« oder im »Flachlande«, wie man hier die Welt der Gesunden mit einem leisen, aber deutlichen Akzent von Geringschätzung nannte, seinen ersehnten Dienst tun zu können. Damit er schneller dazu gelange und Zeit spare, mit der man hier so verschwenderisch umging, hielt er denn vorerst einmal mit aller Gewissenhaftigkeit den Kurdienst ein, – tat es um seiner baldigen Genesung willen, ohne Frage, aber, wie Hans Castorp manchmal zu spüren glaubte, ein wenig doch auch um des Kurdienstes willen, der am Ende ein Dienst war wie ein anderer, und Pflichterfüllung war Pflichterfüllung. So drängte denn Joachim abends schon nach einer Viertelstunde aus der Geselligkeit fort in die Liegekur, und das war gut, denn seine militärische Genauigkeit kam dem zivilen Sinn Hans Castorps gewissermaßen zu Hilfe, der sich sonst wohl, sinn- und aussichtsloserweise, gern noch des längeren an der Geselligkeit beteiligt hätte, mit Aussicht auf den kleinen Russensalon. Daß aber Joachim so dringlich darauf bedacht war, die Abendgeselligkeit abzukürzen, das hatte noch einen anderen, verschwiegenen Grund, auf den sich Hans Castorp genau verstand, seit er Joachims fleckiges Erblassen und jene eigentümlich klägliche Art, in der sein Mund sich in gewissen Augenblicken verzerrte, so genau verstehen gelernt hatte. Denn auch Marusja, die ewig lachlustige Marusja mit dem kleinen Rubin an ihrem schönen Finger, dem Apfelsinenparfüm und der hohen, wurmstichigen Brust war ja bei der Geselligkeit meistens zugegen, und Hans Castorp begriff, daß dieser Umstand Joachim forttrieb, weil er ihn allzusehr, auf eine schreckliche Weise anzog. War auch Joachim »eingesperrt«, – noch enger und beklemmender sogar als er selbst, da ja Marusja mit ihrem Apfelsinentüchlein zu allem Überfluß auch noch fünfmal am Tage mit ihnen zusammen an demselben Eßtisch saß? Jedenfalls hatte Joachim viel zu {226}viel mit sich selbst zu tun, als daß sein Dasein eigentlich innerlich hilfreich für Hans Castorp hätte sein können. Seine tägliche Flucht aus der Geselligkeit wirkte zwar ehrenhaft, aber nichts weniger als beruhigend auf diesen, und dann kam es ihm augenblicksweise auch vor, als ob Joachims gutes Beispiel in bezug auf die Pflichttreue im Kurdienst, die kundige Anleitung dazu, die er ihm zuteil werden ließ, ihr Bedenkliches hätten.","There was Joachim, the good, honorable Joachim at his side, whose eyes took on such a sad expression during these months, and who at times shrugged his shoulders so violently and dismissively as he had never done before - Joachim with the » Blue Heinrich” in his pocket, as Frau Stöhr used to call this device: with such a stubborn, shameless face that it always horrified Hans Castorp in his soul … The honest Joachim was there, Hofrat Behrens tangled and tormented , so that he could get on and do his desired service on the ""plain"" or ""flatland,"" as the world of the healthy was called here with a faint but clear accent of contempt. So that he could get there faster and save time, which was wasted so lavishly here, he first of all did his spa work with all conscientiousness - he did it for the sake of his speedy recovery, without question, but as Hans Castorp sometimes thought he felt , but also a little for the sake of the spa service, which in the end was one service like any other, and fulfilling one's duties was fulfilling one's duties. So in the evening, after only a quarter of an hour, Joachim pressed away from his social life to take a rest cure, and that was good, because his military accuracy came to the aid of Hans Castorp's civil sense, who otherwise, probably, pointlessly and hopelessly, would like to spend even longer would have taken part in the conviviality, with a view of the little Russian salon. But the fact that Joachim was so anxious to shorten the evening social time had another, secret reason, which Hans Castorp knew perfectly well, since he had seen Joachim's blotchy pallor and the peculiar pitiful way in which his mouth twisted at certain moments , had learned to understand so precisely. Because Marusja, the always laughable Marusja with the little ruby on her beautiful finger, the orange perfume and the high, worm-eaten chest, was usually present at the social gatherings, and Hans Castorp understood that this circumstance was driving Joachim away because it was too annoying attracted in a horrible way. Was Joachim also ""locked up"" - even more tightly and oppressively than he himself, since Marusja, with her little orange handkerchief, to top it all off, sat with them five times a day at the same dining table? In any case, Joachim had far too much to do with himself for his existence to have been of any real help to Hans Castorp. His daily escape from social life, while honorable, was nothing short of reassuring, and then for a moment it seemed to him that Joachim's good example of dutifulness in the spa service, the expert guidance he was bestowing on him let her have doubts.","There was the good, the upright Joachim, firm as a rock—yet whose eyes in these past months had come to hold such a tragic shadow, and who had never used to shrug his shoulders, as he did so often now. Joachim, with the “Blue Peter” in his pocket, as Frau Stöhr called the receptacle. When Hans Castorp thought of her hard, crabbed face it made him shiver. Yes, there was Joachim—who kept constantly at Hofrat Behrens to let him get away and go down to the longed-for service in the “plain”—the “flat-land,” as the healthy, normal world was called up here, with a faint yet perceptible nuance of contempt. Joachim served the cure single-mindedly, to the end that he might arrive sooner at his goal and save some of the time which “those up here” so wantonly flung away; served it unquestioningly for the sake of speedy recovery—but also, Hans Castorp detected, for the sake of the cure itself, which, after all, was a service, like another; and was not duty duty, wherever performed? Joachim invariably went upstairs after only a quarter-hour in the drawing-rooms; and this military precision of his was a prop to the civilian laxity of his cousin, who would otherwise be likely to loiter unprofitably below, with his eye on the company in the small salon. But Hans Castorp was convinced there was another and private reason why Joachim withdrew so early; he had known it since the time he saw his cousin’s face take on the mottled pallor, and his mouth assume the pathetic twist. He perfectly understood. For Marusja was almost always there in the evening—laughter-loving Marusja, with the little ruby on her charming hand, the handkerchief with the orange scent, and the swelling bosom, tainted within—Hans Castorp comprehended that it was her presence which drove Joachim away, precisely because it so strongly, so fearfully drew him toward her. Was Joachim too “immured”—and even worse off than himself, in that he had five times a day to sit at the same table with Marusja and her orange-scented handkerchief? However that might be, it was clear that Joachim was preoccupied with his own troubles; the thought of him could afford his cousin no mental support. That he took refuge in daily flight was a credit to him; but that he had to flee was anything but reassuring to Hans Castorp, who even began to feel that Joachim’s good example of faithful service of the cure and the initiation which he owed to his cousin’s experience might have also their bad side.","There was Joachim, good, upright Joachim there at his side, whose eyes had taken on such a sad expression in these last months, and who at times would shrug in that dismissive, vehement way he had never, ever done before—Joachim with his Blue Henry in his pocket, as Frau Stöhr liked to call the item, with that willfully shameless look on her face that shocked Hans Castorp every time. There was honest Joachim, then, who pestered and badgered Director Behrens so that he could return to the “plains,” to the “flatlands”—as people up here called the world of the healthy with a gentle, but clear trace of contempt—and take up the military duties he so longed for. And both to do that and to save time (which people simply wasted up here) , he had from the first been as conscientious as possible in doing his rest-cure duty—doing it, no doubt, in order to recuperate as soon as possible, but as Hans Castorp sometimes thought he could sense, doing it just a little for the sake of the cure itself, which ultimately was a sort of service like any other, since doing one’s duty was doing one’s duty. And so each evening, after perhaps fifteen minutes, Joachim would propose that they leave the social gathering for their rest cure; which was fine, since his military scruples made up somewhat for Hans Castorp’s civilian attitudes, for he would probably have preferred to linger there, for no good reason and with no prospects, except a view to the little Russian salon. But Joachim was so insistent about cutting the party short that there had to be another, unspoken reason—one that Hans Castorp had come to understand only too well ever since he had realized the precise meaning of Joachim’s blotchy pallor and the peculiar, woeful way he wrenched his mouth at certain moments. Because Marusya, laughter-loving Marusya, with the little ruby on her pretty finger, her orange-blossom perfume, and her prominent, worm-eaten chest, was usually present at the gathering as well; and Hans Castorp understood that it was this circumstance that drove Joachim away, precisely because it held such a strong, terrible attraction for him. Was Joachim “locked up” here, too? Was it even more narrow and suffocating for him than for Hans Castorp himself? Marusya, after all, with her little orange-scented handkerchief, sat down at the same table with them five times a day. In any case, Joachim was much too preoccupied with himself to have been of any real inner help to Hans Castorp. His flight from the festivities each evening seemed honorable enough, but the effect was anything but calming; and then, too, there were certain moments when it seemed as if Joachim’s good example at doing one’s rest-cure duty—and even his expert introduction to its procedures—had a dubious side as well."
"»Eine gewagte Neugier bei dem Sprecher einer Gesellschaftsklasse, welche Träger der Freiheit ist, die die Welt zugrunde gerichtet hat. Ich kann auf Ihre Widerrede zur Not verzichten, denn die politische Ideologie der Bürgerlichkeit ist mir bekannt. Ihr Ziel ist das demokratische Imperium, die Selbstübersteigerung des nationalen Staatsprinzips ins Universelle, der Weltstaat. Der Kaiser dieses Imperiums? Wir kennen ihn. Ihre Utopie ist gräßlich, und doch, – wir finden uns an diesem Punkt gewissermaßen wieder zusammen. Denn Ihre kapitalistische Weltrepublik hat etwas Transzendentes, tatsächlich, der Weltstaat ist die Transzendenz des weltlichen Staates, und wir stimmen überein in dem Glauben, daß einem vollkommenen Anfangszustande der Menschheit ein in Horizontferne liegender vollkommener Endzustand entsprechen soll. Seit den Tagen Gregors des Großen, Gründers des Gottesstaates, hat die Kirche es als ihre Aufgabe betrachtet, den Menschen unter die Leitung Gottes zurückzuführen. Der Herrschaftsanspruch des Papstes wurde nicht um seiner selbst willen erhoben, sondern seine stellvertretende Diktatur war Mittel und Weg zum Erlösungsziel, Übergangsform vom heidnischen Staat zum himmlischen Reich. Sie haben diesen Lernenden hier von Bluttaten der Kirche, ihrer strafenden Unduldsamkeit gesprochen, – höchst törichterweise, denn Gotteseifer kann selbstverständlich nicht pazifistisch sein, und Gregor hat das Wort gesprochen: ›Verflucht sei der Mensch, der sein Schwert zurückhält {607}vom Blute!‹ Daß die Macht böse ist, wissen wir. Aber der Dualismus von Gut und Böse, von Jenseits und Diesseits, Geist und Macht muß, wenn das Reich kommen soll, vorübergehend aufgehoben werden in einem Prinzip, das Askese und Herrschaft vereinigt.

The emperor of this empire? we know him Your utopia is hideous, and yet - we find ourselves together again at this point, so to speak. Because your capitalist world republic has something transcendent about it, indeed, the world state is the transcendence of the world state, and we agree in the belief that a perfect final state lying in the distant horizon should correspond to a perfect initial state of mankind. Ever since the days of Gregory the Great, founder of the city of God, the Church has regarded it as her task to bring man back under God's direction. The pope's claim to power was not raised for its own sake, but his representative dictatorship was the means and way to the goal of salvation, a transitional form from the pagan state to the heavenly kingdom. You spoke to these students here about the church's bloody deeds and its punishing intolerance - very foolishly, because of course zeal for God cannot be pacifistic, and Gregory spoke the words: 'Cursed be the man who keeps his sword {607}from the blood! ' We know that power is evil.

Your Utopia is monstrous—and yet, at this point, we find ourselves to a certain extent again on common ground. For your capitalistic world-republic is, in truth, transcendental in character; the World-State is the secular State transcended; and we unite in the faith that the final, perfected State, lying dim upon the far horizon, should correspond to man’s original, primitive perfection. Since the time of Gregory the Great, the founder of the State of God, the Church has always regarded it as her task to bring mankind back under the divine guidance. Gregory’s claim to temporal power was put forward not for its own sake, but rather because his delegated dictatorship was to be the means and the way to the goal of redemption—a transitional stage between the pagan State and the heavenly kingdom. You have spoken to your pupils here of the bloody deeds of the Church, her chastisements and her intolerance; very foolishly so, for it stands to reason that the zeal of the godly cannot be pacifistic in character—Gregory himself said: ‘Cursed be the man who holds back his sword from the shedding of blood.’ That power is evil we know. But if the kingdom is to come, then it is necessary that the dualism between good and evil, between power and the spirit, here and hereafter, must be for the time abrogated to make way for a single principle, which shall unify asceticism and domination. This is what I mean by the necessity for the Terror.”","“Brash curiosity for a spokesman of a social class that is itself the agent of the freedom that has ruined the world.

Since the days of Gregory the Great, the founder of the City of God on earth, the Church has seen it as her task to bring mankind back under divine rule.

You have spoken to our pupils here about the Church’s bloody deeds and her chastening impatience—but that was very foolish of you, for the zeal of the godly cannot, by definition, be pacifistic. And Gregory himself said: ‘Cursed be the man who holds back his sword from shedding blood.’ We know power is evil.

"Das Gespräch, die Kontroverse – natürlich eine Kontroverse zwischen Naphta und Settembrini – angehend, so war sie eine Sache für sich und stand mit jenen Sondererörterungen über das Logenwesen nur in lockerem Zusammenhang. Außer den Vettern waren auch Ferge und Wehsal dabei zugegen, und aller Teilnahme war groß, obgleich nicht alle dem Gegenstande gewachsen waren, – Herr Ferge zum Beispiel war es ausdrücklich nicht. Aber ein Streit, der geführt wird, als ob es ums Leben ginge, außerdem aber mit einem Witz und Schliff, als ob es nicht ums Leben, sondern nur um ein elegantes Wettspiel ginge – und so wurden alle Dispute zwischen Settembrini und Naphta geführt –: ein solcher Streit ist selbstverständlich und an und für sich unterhaltend anzuhören, auch für den, der wenig davon versteht und seine Tragweite nur undeutlich absieht. Sogar ganz Unzugehörige, Umsitzende lauschten dem Wortwechsel mit hohen Augenbrauen, gefesselt von Leidenschaft und Zierlichkeit der Wechselrede.","As for the conversation, the controversy - a controversy between Naphta and Settembrini, of course - was a separate thing and was only loosely connected with those special discussions on lodge affairs.

But a dispute conducted as if it were a question of life, but also with a wit and polish, as if it were not a question of life but only an elegant contest - and this is how all disputes between Settembrini and Naphta were conducted -: such a dispute is natural and entertaining to listen to, even for those who know little about it and only vaguely anticipate its implications. Even strangers, bystanders, listened to the exchange with raised eyebrows, captivated by the passion and delicacy of the exchange.","As for the talk—a controversy, of course, between Settembrini and Naphta—it was an affair of itself, only slightly connected with those earlier and private utterances on the subject of Freemasonry.

"»Guter Freund, es gibt keine reine Erkenntnis. Die Rechtmäßigkeit der kirchlichen Wissenschaftslehre, die sich in Augustins Satz ›Ich glaube, damit ich erkenne‹ zusammenfassen läßt, ist völlig unbestreitbar. Der Glaube ist das Organ der Erkenntnis und der Intellekt sekundär. Ihre voraussetzungslose Wissenschaft ist eine Mythe. Ein Glaube, eine Weltanschauung, eine Idee, kurz: ein Wille ist regelmäßig vorhanden, und Sache der Vernunft ist es, ihn zu erörtern, ihn zu beweisen. Es läuft immer und in allen Fällen auf das ›Quod erat demonstrandum‹ hinaus. Schon der Begriff des Beweises enthält, psychologisch genommen, ein stark voluntaristisches Element. Die großen Scholastiker des zwölften und dreizehnten Jahrhunderts waren einig in der Überzeugung, daß in der Philosophie nicht wahr sein könne, was vor der Theologie falsch sei. Lassen wir die Theologie aus dem Spiel, wenn Sie wollen, aber eine Humanität, die nicht anerkennt, daß in der Naturwissen{600}schaft nicht wahr sein kann, was vor der Philosophie falsch ist, das ist keine Humanität. Die Argumentation des heiligen Offiziums gegen Galilei lautete dahin, daß seine Sätze philosophisch absurd seien. Eine schlagendere Argumentation gibt es nicht.«","»Good friend, there is no such thing as pure knowledge. The legitimacy of the ecclesiastical scientific doctrine, which can be summed up in Augustine's sentence 'I believe in order that I may know', is completely indisputable. Faith is the organ of knowledge and intellect secondary. Your unconditional science is a myth. A belief, a belief, an idea, in short: a will is regularly present, and it is for reason to discuss it, to prove it. It always and in all cases boils down to the ›quod erat demonstrandum‹. Psychologically speaking, the very concept of proof contains a strong voluntaristic element. The great scholastics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were unanimous in their conviction that what is false in theology cannot be true in philosophy. Let's leave theology out of the game if you like, but a humanity that does not recognize that what is false in philosophy cannot be true in natural science, that is not humanity. The argument of the Holy Office against Galileo was that his propositions were philosophically absurd. There is no more convincing argument.«","Naphta responded, with disagreeable composure: “My good sir, there is no such thing as pure knowledge. The validity of the Church’s teaching on the subject of science, which can be summed up in the phrase of Saint Augustine: Credo, ut intellegam: I believe, in order that I may understand, is absolutely incontrovertible. Faith is the vehicle of knowledge, intellect secondary. Your pure science is a myth. A belief, a given conception of the universe, an idea—in short, a will, is always in existence; which it is the task of the intellect to expound and demonstrate. It comes down every time to the quod erat demonstrandum. Even the conception of evidence itself, psychologically speaking, contains a strong element of voluntarism. The great schoolmen of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were agreed that what is false in theology cannot be true in philosophy. We can, if you like, leave theology out of the argument; but a humanity, a cultural conception, which refuses to recognize that what is philosophically false cannot be scientifically true, is not worthy the name. The accusation of the Holy Office against Galileo stated that his thesis was philosophically absurd. A more crushing arraignment could not well be.”","“My good friend,” Naphta replied with sour composure, “there is no such thing as pure knowledge. The validity of ecclesiastical science—which can be summarized in Saint Augustine’s statement: ‘I believe, that I may understand’—is absolutely incontrovertible. Faith is the vehicle of understanding, the intellect is secondary. Your unbiased science is a myth. Faith, a world view, an idea—in short, the will—is always present, and it is then reason’s task to examine and prove it. In the end we always come down to ‘quod erat demonstrandum.’ The very notion of proof contains, psychologically speaking, a strong voluntaristic element. The great scholastics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were unanimous in their conviction that nothing could be true in philosophy that was theologically false. Let us set theology aside, if you like. A human race, however, that refuses to accept the proposition that nothing can be true in science that is false in philosophy, is not human. The argumentation of the Holy Office against Galileo stated that his theses were philosophically absurd. There can be no more cogent argument than that.”"

"Das war ein Druck, eine Herabminderung und Beeinträchtigung durch den Vergleich, – fühlbar dem durchtriebenen Beobachter, fühlbar aber ohne Zweifel auch den Beteiligten, sowohl den schmächtig Überartikulierten wie dem großartig Stammelnden. Peeperkorn behandelte Naphta und Settembrini überaus höflich und aufmerksam, mit einem Respekt, den Hans Castorp ironisch genannt haben würde, wenn ihn nicht volle Einsicht in die Unvereinbarkeit dieses Begriffes mit dem des großen Formats daran gehindert hätte. Könige kennen keine Ironie, – nicht einmal im Sinn eines geraden und klassischen Mittels der Redekunst, geschweige in einem verwikkelteren Sinn. Und so war es denn eher eine zugleich feine und großartige Spötterei zu nennen, was, unter leicht übertriebenem Ernst verborgen oder offen zutage liegend, des Holländers {881}Benehmen gegen Hansens Freunde kennzeichnete. »Ja – ja – ja –!« konnte er wohl sagen, indem er mit dem Finger nach ihrer Seite drohte, den Kopf mit scherzhaft lächelnden zerrissenen Lippen abgewandt. »Das ist – Das sind –. Meine Herrschaften, ich lenke Ihre Aufmerksamkeit – – Cerebrum, cerebral, verstehen Sie! Nein – nein, perfekt, außerordentlich, das ist, da zeigt sich denn doch – –.« Sie rächten sich, indem sie Blicke tauschten, die nach der Begegnung verzweifelt himmelwärts wanderten, und in die sie auch Hans Castorp hineinzuziehen trachteten, was er aber ablehnte.","That was a pressure, a degradation and impairment through the comparison – felt by the cunning observer, but no doubt also felt by those involved, both the slightly over-articulated and the magnificently stammering. Peeperkorn treated Naphta and Settembrini extremely politely and attentively, with a respect which Hans Castorp would have called ironic if he had not been prevented from doing so by a full understanding of the incompatibility of this concept with that of large format. Kings know no irony--not even in the straight and classic sense of rhetoric, let alone in a more intricate sense. And so it was rather to be called at the same time subtle and grandiose mockery, which, concealed under slightly exaggerated seriousness or lying openly, characterized the Dutchman's {881}behaviour towards Hansen's friends. ""Yes-yes-yes-!"" he might well say, wagging his finger at her side, his head turned away, his torn lips jokingly smiling. “That is—that is—. Gentlemen, I draw your attention -- cerebrum, cerebral, you understand! No - no, perfect, extraordinary, that is, it shows - -.« They took revenge by exchanging looks, which after the encounter went heavenward in desperation, and in which they also tried to draw Hans Castorp, but he did refused.","connoisseur’s watchful eye, but very probably to the feelings of those concerned, the tongue-tied giant as well as the two insignificant and over-articulate others. Peeperkorn treated both with distinguished attention, a respect which Hans Castorp would have called ironic had he not known that irony is not on the grand scale. Kings are never ironical—not even in the sense of a direct and classic device of oratory, to say nothing of any other kind. The Dutchman’s manner toward Hans Castorp ’s friends was rather mocking than ironic. He made beautiful fun of them, either openly or veiled in exaggerated respect. “Oh, yes, yes,” he would say, with his finger threatening their direction, the head and smiling lips turned away, “this is—these are—ladies and gentlemen, I call your attention—cerebrum, cerebral, you understand! No, no—positively. Extraordinary—displays great— ” In revenge, they looked at each other, pantomimed despair, angled for Hans Castorp’s glance; but he refused to be drawn.","So heavy was the weight that in comparison they seemed diminished, impaired—which not only the sly observer noticed, but also, without doubt, those involved, both the two frail hyperarticulate gentlemen and the grand stammerer himself. Peeperkorn certainly treated Naphta and Settembrini with courtesy and attention—with a respect that Hans Castorp would have called ironic, if the insight that irony and great stature are incompatible had not prevented him from doing so. Kings know nothing of irony—not even when employed as an honest device of classical rhetoric, not to mention its more complicated forms. And so the Dutchman’s behavior toward Hans’s friends was characterized by what might better be called a refined, but grand mockery, sometimes hidden under slightly exaggerated seriousness, sometimes quite open. “Yes-yes-yes-yes!” he might say, waving an admonishing finger at them, while turning his head away with a droll smile playing on his ragged lips. “That is—those are—Gentlemen, let me call your attention to—cerebrum, cerebral, you understand. No—no, agreed, extraordinary, that is, it just goes to show— ” They took their revenge by exchanging glances—their eyes would meet and then turn heavenward in despair—and even attempted to draw Hans Castorp into the game; he, however, refused."
"Ei ja, ja, ja, das war recht schön, so mußte wohl jeder Redliche sprechen. Und dennoch stand hinter diesem holden Produkte der Tod. Es unterhielt Beziehungen zu ihm, die man lieben mochte, aber nicht ohne sich von einer bestimmten Unerlaubtheit solcher Liebe ahnungsvoll-regierungsweise Rechenschaft zu geben. Es mochte seinem eigenen ursprünglichen Wesen nach nicht Sympathie mit dem Tode, sondern etwas sehr Volkstümlich-Lebensvolles sein, aber die geistige Sympathie damit war Sympathie mit dem Tode, – lautere Frömmigkeit, das Sinnige selbst an ihrem Anfang, das sollte auch nicht aufs Leiseste bestritten werden; aber in ihrer Folge lagen Ergebnisse der Finsternis.","Oh yes, yes, yes, that was really nice, that's how every honest person should speak. And yet death stood behind this lovely product. It maintained relationships with him that one might love, but not without recognizing a certain illicitness of such love, full of foreboding and government. According to its own original nature it might not have been sympathy with death, but something very popular and full of life, but the spiritual sympathy with it was sympathy with death - pure piety, the sensible even at its beginning, that should not be disputed in the slightest will; but in their wake lay results of darkness.","Yes. Ah, yes! All very fine. Thus must every upright man speak. But for all that, behind this so lovely and pleasant artistic production stood—death. It had with death certain relations, which one might love, yet not without consciously, and in a “stocktaking” sense, acknowledging a certain illicit element in one’s love. Perhaps in its original form it was not sympathy with death; perhaps it was something very much of the people and racy of life; but spiritual sympathy with it was none the less sympathy with death. At first blush proper and pious enough, indisputably. But the issues of it were sinister.","Oh my, oh my—that was all very pretty , was what any honest man would have to say. And yet behind this sweet, lovely, fair work of art stood death. It had special ties with death, ties one might indeed love, but not without first “playing king,” not without intuitively taking into account a certain illegitimacy in such love. In its own original form, there may have been no sympathy with death, only something full of life and folk culture. But to feel spiritual and intellectual sympathy with it was to feel sympathy with death. In its beginnings, purest piety, the epitome of judicious concern—there should be no thought of contesting that. But in its train came the workings of darkness."

Übermorgen abend schleicht das Kätzchen sich wieder herein, ich hab’s telegraphisch.« Aber davon, daß Frau Chauchat nicht allein komme, hatte er nichts verlauten lassen, vielleicht weil auch er nichts davon gewußt hatte, daß sie und Peeperkorn zusammen kämen und zusammengehörten, – wenigstens gab er Überraschung vor, als Hans Castorp ihn am Tage nach der gemeinsamen Ankunft gewissermaßen zur Rede stellte.","Mynheer Peeperkorn arrived at ""Dorf"" station on the same evening train as Madame Chauchat, and rode with her in the same sleigh to Haus Berghof, where they had dinner with her in the restaurant. It was more than simultaneous, it was a joint arrival, and this commonality, which found its continuation, for example, in the arrangement that Mynheer was assigned his place at the table next to the returnee, at the Good Russian Table, opposite the Doctor's Square, where formerly the teacher Popów had organized his wild and ambiguous performances - it was this togetherness that disturbed the good Hans Castorp, since such things had escaped his foresight. The privy councilor had informed him in his own way of the day and hour of Clawdia's return. 'Well, Castorp, old boy,' he had said, 'loyal perseverance will be rewarded. The day after tomorrow the kitten will sneak in again, I've got it by telegraph.' But he hadn't said anything about Frau Chauchat not coming alone, perhaps because he too hadn't known that she and Peeperkorn were coming together and belonged together - at least he feigned surprise when Hans Castorp sort of confronted him the day after they arrived together.","Mynheer Peeperkorn arrived at the Dorf station by the same evening train as Frau Chauchat. They drove up in the same sleigh to House Berghof, and supped together in the restaurant. The arrival, in short, was not only coincident but concurrent, and continued in that sense, Mynheer taking his place beside the returned wanderer at the “good” Russian table, opposite the doctor’s seat—the place Popoff had occupied, what time he performed his wild and equivocal antics. The companionship troubled our good Hans Castorp—that it should turn out like this had never entered his mind. The Hofrat, after his own fashion, had announced the day and hour of Clavdia’s return. “Well, Castorp, old top,” he said, “there’s always a reward for faithful waiting. To-morrow the little puss will be slinking back—I’ve had a dispatch.” But not a word that she might not come alone. Perhaps he did not know that she and Peeperkorn were travelling together; at least, he showed surprise when Hans Castorp, the day after, as much as took him to task.","Mynheer Peeperkorn arrived at the station in Dorf on the evening train with Madame Chauchat and rode in the same sleigh with her to the Berghof, where he also took his evening meal with her in the restaurant. They had arrived not merely simultaneously, they had arrived together; and it was this companionship, which continued, for example, in seating arrangements that placed Mynheer beside the returnee at the Good Russian table, opposite the doctor’s chair, the seat from which Popóv the teacher had once put on his wild and dubious performances—it was this companionship that upset our good Hans Castorp, because he had failed to see anything of the sort coming. The director had announced the day and hour of Clavdia’s return in his own fashion. “Well, Castorp, old boy,” he had said, “it pays to be perseverant. Our little pussycat will come slinking home evening after next. Was all in her telegram.” But he had said nothing about Frau Chauchat’s not arriving alone; maybe he had not known himself that she and Peeperkorn would be traveling together—at least he pretended surprise when Hans Castorp more or less took him to task the day after their joint arrival."
"»Ein halbes Jahr? Bist du toll?« rief Hans Castorp. Sie hatten sich eben vor dem Stationsgebäude, das nicht viel mehr als ein Schuppen war, in das gelbe Kabriolett gesetzt, das dort auf steinigem Platze bereit stand, und während die beiden Braunen anzogen, warf sich Hans Castorp empört auf dem harten Kissen herum. »Ein halbes Jahr? du bist ja schon fast ein halbes Jahr hier! Man hat doch nicht so viel Zeit –!«","""Half a year? Are you mad?” exclaimed Hans Castorp. They had just gotten into the yellow cabriolet that was waiting on the stony spot in front of the station building, which was little more than a shed, and while the two browns were getting dressed, Hans Castorp tossed about indignantly on the hard cushion. ""Half a year? you've been here for almost half a year! You don't have that much time!'","“Half a year? Are you crazy?” shouted Hans Castorp. They had climbed into the yellow cabriolet that stood in the stone-paved square in front of the shed-like station, and as the pair of brown horses started up, he flounced indignantly on the hard cushions. “Half a year! You’ve been up here half a year already! Who’s got so much time to spend—”","“Six months? Are you crazy?” Hans Castorp cried. They were taking their seats on the hard cushions of a yellow cabriolet that had stood waiting for them on the gravel apron in front of the station, itself not much more than a shed; and as the pair of bays began to pull, Hans Castorp spun around now in vexation. “Six months? You’ve already been here for almost that long! We don’t have that much time in life!”"
»Wie beliebten Sie sich auszudrücken?« lautete Naphtas Gegenfrage …,"""How would you like to express yourself?"" was Naphta's counter-question...","“What, may I ask, was the expression you were pleased to use?” Naphta countered.","“I beg your pardon, what was it you just said?” Naphta countered with a question of his own."
"»Rechtfertige dich!« hieß es abermals. »Seht, er schweiget«, durfte der stark voreingenommene Verhandlungsleiter zum zweitenmal feststellen, und so vereinigten auch diesmal alle Richterstimmen sich mit der seinen in dem Wahrspruch: »Felonie!«","""Justify yourself!"" it said again. ""Look, he's silent,"" the strongly biased negotiator was able to state for the second time, and so this time all the judges' voices united with his in the verdict: ""Felonia!""","And again: “Justify thyself.” “Lo, he is silent,” the highly prejudiced presiding officer announces once more; and all the priests acain unanimously declare him guilty.","“Defend yourself!” the chorus cries out again. “You see, he is silent,” the totally biased judge notes for the second time. And so this time, too, all voices unite in the verdict of “Treason!”"
"»Trente-sept et huit ou neuf l’après-midi«, sagte Hans Castorp. »Und du?«","""Trente-sept et huit ou neuf l'après-midi,"" said Hans Castorp. ""And you?""",“Trente-sept et huit ou neuf l’après-midi” said Hans Castorp. “And you?”,"“A hundred, a hundred point two in the afternoon,” Hans Castorp said. “And you?”"
"»Na, du, was soll das. Es sieht ja betrunken aus, wie wir daherkommen.«","""Well, you, what are you doing. It looks drunk coming here.""","He walked on his left side expressly; and when there came a little rise to surmount, would help his cousin, who had grown by now unsteady on his feet; would put his arm across his shoulder; overcoming his shyness, would even leave it there a while, until Joachim shook it off pettishly and said: “Don’t, it looks silly—as if we were drunk, coming along like that.”","He walked on the left, made a point of doing so; and since Joachim had become somewhat unsteady on his feet, Hans Castorp was sure to offer him a hand when they were confronted with a gentle meadow slope; overcoming his customary reserve, he would put an arm around him, might even forget for a while to remove it again from Joachim’s shoulders, until his cousin shook him off in slight annoyance and said, “Say there, what’s this? We look like two drunks wandering along.”"
"Oft und nicht anders als mit fahlem Grauen kam Anton Karlowitsch Ferge auf dies »hundsföttische« Erlebnis zurück und ängstigte sich nicht wenig vor seiner Wiederholung. Übrigens hatte er sich von vornherein als einen einfachen Menschen bekannt, dem alles »Hohe« vollständig fernliege und an den man besondere Ansprüche geistiger und gemütlicher Art nicht stellen dürfe, wie auch er solche Ansprüche an niemanden stelle. Dies vereinbart, erzählte er gar nicht uninteressant von seinem früheren Leben, aus dem die Krankheit ihn dann geworfen, dem Leben eines Reisenden im Dienst einer Feuerversicherungsgesellschaft: von Petersburg aus hatte er in weitläufigen Kreuz- und Querfahrten durch ganz Rußland die assekurierten Fabriken besucht und die wirtschaftlich zweifelhaften auszukundschaften gehabt; denn es sei statistisch, daß in den gerade schlecht gehenden Industrien die meisten Fabrikbrände vorkämen. Darum sei er denn ausgesandt worden, um unter diesem und jenem Vorwande einen Betrieb zu sondieren und seiner Bank Bericht zu erstatten, damit zu rechter Zeit durch verstärkte Rückversicherung oder Prämienteilung emp{472}findlichem Verlust habe vorgebeugt werden können. Von winterlichen Reisen durch das weite Reich erzählte er, von Fahrten die Nächte hindurch bei ungeheuerem Frost, im Liegeschlitten, unter Schaffelldecken, und wie er erwachend die Augen der Wölfe gleich Sternen über dem Schnee habe glühen sehen. Gefrorenen Proviant, so Kohlsuppe wie Weißbrot, hatte er im Kasten mit sich geführt, die an den Stationen, beim Pferdewechsel, zum Genusse aufgetaut worden waren, wobei sich das Brot als frisch wie am ersten Tage erwiesen hatte. Und schlimm nur, wenn unterwegs plötzlich Tauwetter eingefallen war: dann war ihm die in Stücken mitgenommene Kohlsuppe ausgelaufen.","Anton Karlowitsch Ferge often returned to this ""dog-foettic"" experience, and with no other than a pale dread, and was not a little afraid of repeating it. Incidentally, he had known from the outset that he was a simple man, from whom everything ""high"" was completely remote and from whom one should not make special demands of an intellectual or comfortable nature, just as he made such demands of no one. Having agreed to this, he related, not at all uninterestingly, about his earlier life, from which the illness then threw him, the life of a traveler in the service of a fire insurance company: from St. Petersburg he had made extensive cruises and journeys across Russia to visit the insured factories and had to scout out economically dubious; for it is statistical that most factory fires occur in the industries that are currently ailing. That's why he was sent out to sound out a company under this and that pretext and to report to his bank so that sensitive losses could be prevented at the right time through increased reinsurance or the sharing of premiums. He told of wintry journeys through the vast empire, of journeys through the nights in tremendous frost, in a sledge, under sheepskin blankets, and how when he woke up he saw the eyes of the wolves glowing like stars over the snow. He had brought frozen provisions with him in a box, cabbage soup and white bread, which had been thawed at the stations when the horses were changed, and the bread had turned out to be as fresh as the first day. And it was only bad if there was a sudden thaw on the way: the cabbage soup that he had taken with him ran out.","Often, and never without blanching and shuddering, did Anton Karlowitsch Ferge come back to this infernal experience of his, and torture himself with it in retrospect. He had from the first professed himself a simple man; the “higher things” of this life, he said, were utterly beyond him, he expressly stipulated that no intellectual or emotional demands be made upon him; he, for his part, made none upon anybody else. This bargain once struck, he turned out to talk not unentertainingly of his experiences in the life from which his illness had withdrawn him. He had been in the employ of a fire-insurance company, and made constant extended journeys from St. Petersburg up and down the whole of Russia, visiting insured factory buildings and spying out those which were financially suspect; for it was a fact supported by statistics that the larger percentage of fires occurred in just those factories where business was not going too well. Thus he was sent out to study a plant, under this or that pretext, and render an account to his company, so that serious loss could be provided against betimes, by increased counter-insurance or dividing the risk. He told of winter journeys through the length and breadth of Russia, of night travel in extreme cold, in sledges that you lay down in, under sheepskin covers, and when you roused you could see the eyes of wolves gleaming like stars across the snow. He carried his provisions frozen, cabbage soup and white bread, in boxes; when they stopped to change horses, at a station, these could be thawed out, as required, and the bread would be as fresh as on the day it was baked. But when there came a sudden mild spell, he would find that the soup he had brought with him in chunks had melted and run away.","Anton Karlovitch Ferge came back again and again—and always with that same pallor of horror—to his “filthy” ordeal, reliving many of its torments every time he told about it. He had explained from the start that, being an ordinary man, “higher things” were utterly foreign to him. They shouldn’t make any special intellectual or emotional demands of him, and he wouldn’t make any of them. But once that was settled, he could tell some very interesting tales about the life he had led before illness wrenched him out of it—the life of a traveling fire-insurance salesman. With Petersburg as home base, he had traveled the length and breadth of Russia, visiting insured factories and ferreting out those in dubious financial condition—because statistics showed that fires occurred most often in factories where business was going badly. Which was why he was sent to investigate each factory on some pretext or other, and report back to his bank, so that they could have time to prevent serious losses by reinsuring or spreading the risk. He told about trips across the great empire in winter, about traveling all night in the incredible cold, stretched out in a sleigh under sheepskins, and when he awoke he could see the eyes of wolves glowing like stars out there in the snow. He had brought boxes of provisions with him, frozen cabbage soup and white bread, which he would thaw out and enjoy whenever they stopped to change horses, and the bread would be as fresh as on the day it was baked. The worst thing was if a sudden thaw set in—then the chunks of cabbage soup he had brought along would melt and leak."

"Es stellte sich heraus, daß Dr. Krokowski am Schlusse seines Vortrages große Propaganda für die Seelenzergliederung machte und mit offenen Armen alle aufforderte, zu ihm zu kommen. Kommet her zu mir, sagte er mit anderen Worten, die ihr mühselig und beladen seid! Und er ließ keinen Zweifel an seiner Überzeugung, daß alle ohne Ausnahme mühselig und beladen waren. Er sprach von verborgenem Leide, von Scham und Gram, von der erlösenden Wirkung der Analyse; er pries die Durchleuchtung des Unbewußten, lehrte die Wiederverwandlung der Krankheit in den bewußt gemachten Affekt, mahnte zum Vertrauen, verhieß Genesung. Dann ließ er die Arme sinken, stellte seinen Kopf wieder gerade, raffte die Druckschriften zusammen, die ihm bei seinem Vortrage ge{199}dient hatten, und indem er das Päckchen, ganz wie ein Lehrer, mit der linken Hand gegen die Schulter lehnte, entfernte er sich erhobenen Hauptes durch den Wandelgang.","It turned out that dr. At the end of his lecture, Krokowski made great propaganda for the dissection of the soul and invited everyone to come to him with open arms. Come to me, he said, in other words, you who are weary and heavy laden! And he left no doubt as to his conviction that all, without exception, were weary and burdened. He spoke of hidden suffering, of shame and grief, of the redeeming effect of analysis; he praised the x-raying of the unconscious, taught how to transform illness into conscious affect, urged trust, and promised recovery. Then he lowered his arms, straightened his head, gathered up the pamphlets that had served him during his lecture, and leaning the package with his left hand on his shoulder, just like a teacher, he walked away down the aisle, head held high.","It seemed that at the end of his lecture Dr. Krokowski was making propaganda for psycho-analysis; with open arms he summoned all and sundry to come unto him. “Come unto me,” he was saying, though not in those words, “come unto me, all ye who are weary and heavy-laden.” And he left no doubt of his conviction that all those present were weary and heavy-laden. He spoke of secret suffering, of shame and sorrow, of the redeeming power of the analytic. He advocated the bringing of light into the unconscious mind and explained how the abnormality was metamorphosed into the conscious emotion; he urged them to have confidence; he promised relief. Then he let fall his arms, raised his head, gathered up his notes and went out by the corridor door, with his head in the air, and the bundle of papers held schoolmaster fashion, in his left hand, against his shoulder.","It turned out that Dr. Krokowski concluded his lecture with a grand advertisement for psychic dissection—he spread his arms wide, and invited them to come unto him. Come unto me, he said, though not exactly in those words, all ye that labor and are heavy laden! And he left no doubt of his certainty that they all, without exception, labored and were heavy laden. He spoke of hidden suffering, of shame and affliction, of the redemptive effects of analysis; he praised the effects of light piercing the dark unconscious, explained that illness could be transformed again into conscious emotion, admonished them to trust, promised recovery. Then he let his arms fall, set his head erect again, gathered up the printed materials that he had used for his lecture, and holding the bundle against his shoulder with his left hand like an ordinary schoolteacher, he exited into the lobby, head held high."
"Hans Castorp näherte sich auf Zehenspitzen dem Bett. Die Augen des Malaien überwachten ihn bei dieser Bewegung, folg{944}ten ihm ohne Drehung des Kopfes, so daß sie ihr Weißes zeigten. Er stellte mit einem Seitenblick fest, daß Frau Chauchat sich nicht um ihn kümmerte, und stand in typischer Haltung am Lager, auf einem Beine ruhend, die Hände auf dem Unterleibe zusammengelegt, mit schräg geneigtem Kopf, in ehrerbietig sinnender Betrachtung. Peeperkorn lag unter der rotseidenen Decke in seinem Trikothemd, wie Hans Castorp ihn so oft gesehen. Seine Hände waren schwärzlichblau angelaufen, Teile seines Gesichtes ebenfalls. Das schuf beträchtliche Entstellung, obgleich seine königlichen Züge sonst unverändert waren. Die idolhafte Faltenlineatur der hohen, weiß umloderten Stirn, in vier- oder fünffacher Reihe wagerecht gezogen und dann im rechten Winkel beiderseits die Schläfen hinablaufend, ausgeprägt durch die habituelle Anspannung eines ganzen Lebens, trat auch bei gesenkten Augenlidern, im Ruhestande, stark hervor. Die bitter zerrissenen Lippen waren leicht getrennt. Der Blaulauf deutete auf jähe Stockung, auf eine gewaltsam-schlagflüssige Hemmung der Lebensfunktionen.","Hans Castorp approached the bed on tiptoe. The Malayan's eyes watched him during this movement, following him without turning his head, so that they showed their whites. He glanced sideways to see that Frau Chauchat was not paying any attention to him, and stood by the bed in the typical posture, resting on one leg, hands clasped on his abdomen, head tilted to one side, in deferential contemplation. Peeperkorn lay under the red silk blanket in his jersey shirt, like Hans Castorp had seen him so often. His hands were blackish-blue, as were parts of his face. This created considerable disfigurement, although his royal features were otherwise unchanged. The idol-like lines of folds on the high, white-blazed forehead, drawn horizontally in four or five rows and then running down the temples at right angles on both sides, marked by the habitual tension of a whole life, also appeared strongly with lowered eyelids in retirement. The bitterly torn lips were slightly parted. The bluing indicated a sudden stagnation, a violent, sudden inhibition of vital functions.","Hans Castorp approached the bed on tiptoe. The Malay without turning his head followed the movement, until his eyeballs showed white. The young man assured himself by a side glance that Frau Chauchat was paying no heed; then stood by the bed in his accustomed posture, his weight on one leg, his head on one side, his hands folded across his stomach, reverently, reflectively gazing. Pieter Peeperkorn lay under the red satin coverlet, in his tricot shirt, as Hans Castorp had so often seen him. His hands were veined a bluish black, likewise parts of his face; a considerable disfigurement, though the kingly features remained unaltered. Beneath the white aureole of hair the masklike folds carved by the habitual gesture of a lifetime ran in a row of four or five, straight across the brow and then in a right angle down the temples; they were more striking than ever, by contrast with the drooping lids and the repose of the features. The cracked lips were slightly parted. The . cyanosis indicated abrupt stoppage, a violent apoplectic arrest of the vital functions.","Hans Castorp approached the bed on tiptoe. The Malayan watched his every move without turning his head, but the whites of his eyes were clearly visible. With a quick sidelong glance of his own, he discovered that Frau Chauchat was paying him no attention, and so he stood in his usual pose beside the bed—weight on one leg, hands clasped before the abdomen, head tilted to one side—gazing down in thoughtful reverence. Under the red silk quilt, Peeperkorn lay dressed in his woolen shirt, just as Hans Castorp had so often seen him. The hands had turned a blackish blue, as had parts of the face, resulting in considerable disfigurement, although the regal features were unaffected. The eyes were closed in peace, but the idol-like tracery of creases, four or five tense horizontal lines that turned down at right angles at the temples and had been formed by the habits of a lifetime, stood out in strong relief on the high brow encircled by white flames. The pained, ragged lips were slightly open. The blue coloration indicated sudden heart congestion, a convulsive and apoplectic arrest of all vital functions."
"»Vexation, Täuschung«, bekräftigte der Hofrat. »Zeichnen Sie sie einfach schief und geschlitzt, so sind Sie verloren. Sie müssen die Schiefheit und Geschlitztheit zuwege bringen, wie die Natur sie zuwege bringt, Illusion in der Illusion treiben, sozusagen, und dazu ist natürlich nötig, daß Sie über den Epikanthus Bescheid wissen. Wissen kann überhaupt nicht schaden. Sehen Sie sich die Haut an, die Körperhaut hier. Ist das anschaulich, oder ist es nicht so besonders anschaulich Ihrer Meinung nach?«","""Vexation, deception,"" affirmed the Councilor. 'Just draw them crooked and slit and you're lost. You have to achieve the crookedness and slitting as nature achieves, drive illusion within illusion, so to speak, and for that, of course, you need to know about the epicanthus. Knowledge can't hurt at all. Look at the skin, the body skin here. Is that descriptive, or is it not particularly descriptive in your opinion?”","“Vanity,” said the Hofrat, “and vexation of spirit. If you simply draw them in slanting, you are lost. You must bring about the obliquity the same way nature does, you must add illusion to illusion—and for that you have to know about the epicanthus. What a man knows always comes in handy. Now look at the skin—the epidermis. Do you find I’ve managed to make it lifelike, or not?”","“A mirage, a deception,” the director confirmed. “If you simply draw it slanted and slit, all is lost. You have to handle it the same way that nature does, create an illusion within the illusion, so to speak, and for that, of course, you need to know all about the epicanthic fold. Knowledge never hurts. Do you see the skin, the epidermis here? Is it lifelike, or not especially so, in your opinion?”"
"Hans Castorp fand das reizend und überaus hörenswert. Ganz gewonnen, sagte er, habe ihn Herr Settembrini mit seiner plastischen Theorie. Denn man möge sagen, was man wolle – und einiges sagen lasse sich ja, zum Beispiel, daß Krankheit ein erhöhter Lebenszustand sei und also was Festliches habe –: soviel sei gewiß, daß Krankheit eine Überbetonung des Körperlichen bedeute, den Menschen gleichsam ganz und gar auf seinen Körper zurückweise und zurückwerfe und so der Würde des Menschen bis zur Vernichtung abträglich sei, indem sie ihn nämlich zum bloßen Körper herabwürdige. Krankheit sei also unmenschlich.","Hans Castorp found it charming and very much worth listening to. He said that Herr Settembrini had won him over completely with his plastic theory. Because one may say what one likes - and some things can be said, for example that illness is a heightened state of life and therefore has something festive about it: so much is certain that illness means an overemphasis on the physical, the human being as it were completely to his body and throws it back and is thus detrimental to the dignity of man to the point of annihilation, namely by reducing him to a mere body. Illness is therefore inhuman.","Hans Castorp found that charming—most edifying. Herr Settembrini had quite won him over with his plastic theory. Say what you like—and there was a lot to be said for the idea that illness had something solemn and ennobling about it—yet after all, you couldn’t deny that illness was an accentuation of the physical, it did throw man back, so to speak, upon the flesh and to that extent was detrimental to human dignity. It dragged man down to the level of his body. Thus it might be argued that disease was un-human.","Hans Castorp found that charming, well worth listening to. Herr Settembrini had won him over entirely with his graphic theory. Because say what one might, what one would—and several things might be said, for example that illness was a higher level of life and so possessed a kind of solemnity—this much was certain: illness meant an overemphasis on the physical, sent a person back to his own body, cast him back totally upon it, as it were, detracted from the worthiness and dignity of man to the point of annihilation by reducing man to mere body. Illness, therefore, was inhuman."
"So raunte die Lehrerin hinter der Hand und ungehört von den anderen, während die flaumige Röte auf ihren Altjungferwangen an ihre übernormale Körpertemperatur erinnerte; und ihre wollüstigen Redereien gingen dem armen Hans Castorp in Mark und Blut. Eine gewisse Unselbständigkeit schuf ihm das Bedürfnis, von dritter Seite bestätigt zu erhalten, daß Madame Chauchat eine entzückende Frau sei, und außerdem wünschte der junge Mann, sich von außen zur Hingabe an Empfindungen ermutigen zu lassen, denen seine Vernunft und sein Gewissen störende Widerstände entgegensetzten.","So the teacher whispered behind her hand and unheard by the others, while the downy blush on her spinster cheeks reminded her of her above-normal body temperature; and their voluptuous rhetoric went into the marrow and blood of poor Hans Castorp. A certain lack of independence created in him the need to have third parties confirm that Madame Chauchat was a delightful woman, and the young man also wished to be encouraged from outside to indulge in feelings to which his reason and conscience offered disturbing resistance .","She whispered on, behind her hand, for his ear alone; the flush that mantled on her downy old cheek bespoke a rising temperature, and the suggestiveness of her talk pierced Hans Castorp to the very marrow. It did him good to hear someone else confirm his view that Madame Chauchat was an enchanting creature. He was a young man of not very independent judgments, and glad to be encouraged in certain feelings he had, upon which both reason and conscience united to frown.","The teacher whispered all this behind her hand to keep others from hearing. Her flushed, downy spinster ’s cheeks suggested a temperature above normal, and her titillating remarks stirred Hans Castorp’s blood. A certain lack of self-reliance created in him the need to hear confirmed from a third party that Madame Chauchat was indeed an enchanting woman, and the young man also wanted others to encourage him to give himself over to his feelings, when both his reason and conscience were offering unsettling resistance."
"»Danke, ich stelle es erst mal hier an mein Stuhlbein, da steht es ja für den Augenblick ganz gut. Die griechischen Plastiker kümmerten sich aber nicht viel um den Kopf, es kam ihnen auf den Körper an, das war vielleicht gerade das Humanistische … Und die weibliche Plastik, das ist also Fett?«","“Thanks, I'll put it here on my chair leg for now, it's quite good there for the moment. But the Greek sculptors didn't bother much about the head, what mattered to them was the body, maybe that was precisely what was humanistic... And the female sculptor, so that's fat?”","“Pardon me, I’ll just lean it here against the leg of my chair, that will do very well for the moment. The Greek sculptors did not trouble themselves about the head and face, their interest was more with the body, I suppose that was their humanism.—And the plasticity of the female form— so that is fat, is it?” “That is fat,” the Hofrat said concisely.","“Yes, thanks, I’ll just put it here against the leg of my chair—it’s fine there for the moment. The Greek sculptors were not very interested in the head, it was more a matter of the body; perhaps that was the real humanistic element in fact.

"Er machte sich mit der neuen Erwerbung vertraut, durchmusterte ungestört den beigestellten Vortragsschatz, den Inhalt der schweren Alben. Es waren deren zwölf, von zweierlei Größe, zu je zwölf Platten; und da viele der eng kreisförmig geritzten schwarzen Scheiben doppelseitig waren, nicht nur weil manches Stück auch die Kehrseite in Anspruch nahm, sondern auch weil einer ganzen Reihe von Tafeln zwei ver{970}schiedene Darbietungen eingeschrieben waren, so war das ein anfangs schwer übersichtliches, ja verwirrendes Eroberungsgebiet schöner Möglichkeiten. Er spielte wohl ein Viertelhundert, indem er sich, um nicht zu stören, in der Nacht nicht gehört zu werden, gewisser sacht ziehender Nadeln bediente, die den Klang verringerten, – aber das war kaum der achte Teil dessen, was sich aller Enden lockend zum Versuche anbot. Für heute mußte es genug sein, die Titel zu überfliegen und nur dann und wann, stichprobeweise, ein Beispiel der stummen Zirkelgraphik dem Schreine einzuverleiben, um es zum Tönen zu bringen. Sie waren unterschieden durch das farbige Etikett ihres Zentrums, die Hartgummidisken, und durch nichts weiter, für das Auge. Eine sah aus wie die andere, ganz oder nicht ganz bis zur Mitte mit konzentrischen Kreisen dicht bedeckt; und doch barg ihr feines Liniengepräge die erdenklichste Musik, glücklichste Eingebungen aus allen Regionen der Kunst, in ausgesuchter Wiedergabe.","He familiarized himself with the new acquisition, undisturbedly examined the treasury provided, the contents of the difficult albums. There were twelve, of two sizes, of twelve plates each; and since many of the black disks, scratched in a tight circle, were double-sided, not only because some pieces also took up the reverse side, but also because two different performances were inscribed on a whole series of panels, it was initially difficult to get a clear view of yes bewildering conquest territory of beautiful possibilities. He probably played a quarter of a hundred, using certain gently drawn needles that reduced the sound, so as not to disturb not being heard at night - but that was scarcely the eighth part of what all ends beckoned to attempts offered. For today it would have to be enough to skim the titles, and only now and then, at random, to incorporate an example of the mute compass-graph into the shrine to make it sound. They were distinguished by the colored label of their center, the hard rubber disks, and nothing more to the eye. One looked like the other, all or not quite densely covered with concentric circles up to the middle; and yet its fine lines concealed the most imaginable music, the happiest inspirations from all regions of art, in a selected rendition.","He made himself acquainted with the new possession, and worked in undisturbed enjoyment through the contents of the heavy albums. There were twelve, in two sizes, with twelve records each; many of the flat, round, black disks were inscribed on both sides, not only with the continuation of a piece of music, but also because many of the plates held two distinct records. Here was a world to conquer, large enough that even to survey it was a difficult task at first, and bewildering; yet a world full of beautiful possibilities. He played some twenty or thirty records; using a kind of needle that moved softly over the plate and lessened the sound, in order that his activity might not offend the silence of the night. But twenty or thirty were scarcely the eighth part of the riches that lay asking to be enjoyed. He must be content tonight with looking over the titles, only choosing one now and again to set upon the disk and give it voice. To the eye one was like another, except for the coloured label in the centre of each hardrubber plate; each and all were covered to the centre or nearly so with concentric circles; but it was these fine lines that held all imaginable music, the happiest inspirations from every region of the art, in choicest reproduction.","He familiarized himself with the new acquisition; with no one to disturb him now, he examined the treasury of works that came with it, inspected the contents of the heavy albums. There were twelve in all, in two different formats, twelve records to each; and since many of the circular disks were minutely etched on both sides—not simply because many pieces required two sides, but also because a good number of them offered two different selections—it was difficult at first to get an overview of this confusing world of beautiful possibilities waiting to be conquered. Trying not to disturb the nighttime silence, he made use of certain needles that sat more lightly on the disks and thus dampened the sound. He played a good twenty-five disks, but that was barely an eighth of the temptations offered on all sides. Just a scan of the tides had to suffice for now, though from time to time he would select one at random and insert yet another example of these mute engravings into the cabinet and turn it into sound. The labels in the middle of the ebonite disks were different colors, but otherwise the eye could not differentiate them. Each looked like the other, each was filled to the center, or almost to the center, with a dense pattern of concentric circles; and yet this delicate tracery contained more sound than one could imagine, exquisite renditions of the happiest inspirations from every domain of the art of music."
"»Ja, das werden wir wohl«, sagte Hans Castorp. – Es ist ihm überlassen geblieben, von der Figur des neuen, unerwarteten Gastes ein ungefähres Bild zu zeichnen, und er hat seine Sache nicht schlecht gemacht, – wir hätten sie auch nicht wesentlich besser machen können. Allerdings war sein Beobachtungsposten der günstigste gewesen: wir wissen ja, daß er während Clawdias Abwesenheit dem Guten Russentisch nachbarlich nahegerückt war, und da der seine mit jenem parallel stand – nur daß der andere etwas weiter gegen die Verandatür sich vorschob – und Hans Castorp sowohl wie Peeperkorn die nach dem Saalinnern gelegenen Schmalseiten einnahmen, so saßen sie sozusagen nebeneinander, Hans Castorp etwas hinter dem Holländer, was eine unauffällige Exploration erleichterte, – während er Frau Chauchat im Dreiviertelsprofil schräg vor sich hatte. Ergänzend wäre seiner begabten Skizze etwa hinzuzufügen, daß Peeperkorns Oberlippe rasiert, seine Nase groß und fleischig und sein Mund ebenfalls groß und von unregelmäßiger Lippenbildung, gleichsam zerrissen war. Ferner waren seine Hände zwar ziemlich breit, aber mit langen, spitz zulaufenden Nägeln versehen, und er bediente sich ihrer beim Sprechen – bei seinem fast unaufhörlichen, wenn auch für Hans Castorp dem Inhalte nach nicht recht greifbaren Sprechen – zu {831}auserlesenen, die Aufmerksamkeit spannenden Gebärden, den delikat nuancierenden, gepflegten, genauen und reinlichen Kulturgebärden eines Dirigenten, den Zeigefinger mit dem Daumen zum Kreise gekrümmt oder die flache Hand – breit, aber nagelspitz – behütend, abdämpfend, Achtsamkeit fordernd ausgebreitet, – um dann die lächelnde Achtsamkeit, die er hervorgerufen, durch die Ungreifbarkeit seiner so stark vorbereiteten Äußerung zu enttäuschen, – oder vielmehr nicht eigentlich zu enttäuschen, sondern in ein erfreutes Staunen zu verwandeln; denn die Stärke, Zartheit und Bedeutsamkeit der Vorbereitung ersetzte in hohem Grade noch nachträglich, was ausblieb, und wirkte befriedigend, unterhaltend, ja bereichernd durch sich selbst. Zuweilen erfolgte die Äußerung überhaupt nicht. Er legte zart seine Hand auf den Unterarm seines Nachbarn zur Linken, eines jungen bulgarischen Gelehrten, oder auf den Madame Chauchats zu seiner Rechten, hob dann diese Hand schräg aufwärts, Schweigen und Spannung gebietend für das, was zu sagen er im Begriffe war, und blickte mit hochgezogenen Brauen, so daß die rechtwinklig von seiner Stirn zu den äußeren Augenwinkeln laufenden Falten sich maskenhaft vertieften, neben dem so Gefesselten auf das Tischtuch nieder, indes seine großen, zerrissenen Lippen, geöffnet, im Begriffe schienen, höchst Wichtiges zu entlassen. Nach einer Weile jedoch atmete er aus, verzichtete, winkte gleichsam »Rührt euch« und wandte sich unverrichteterdinge seinem Kaffee wieder zu, den er sich extra stark, in einer eigenen Maschine, hatte servieren lassen.","""Yes, we will,"" said Hans Castorp. - It was left to him to draw an approximate picture of the figure of the new, unexpected guest, and he didn't do his job badly - we couldn't have done it much better either. To be sure, his observation post had been the most favourable: we know that during Clavdia's absence he had moved in close proximity to the Good Russian Table, and as his stood parallel to that one - except that the other pushed a little further towards the French window - and Hans Castorp as well Peeperkorn occupied the narrow sides facing the interior of the room, so they sat side by side, so to speak, Hans Castorp a little behind the Dutchman, which facilitated an inconspicuous exploration - while he had Frau Chauchat in three-quarter profile diagonally in front of him. In addition to his gifted sketch, it should be added that Peeperkorn's upper lip was shaved, his nose was large and fleshy, and his mouth was also large and had irregular lips, torn as it were. Furthermore, his hands were quite broad, but provided with long, pointed nails, and he used them when he spoke - in his almost incessant, even if for Hans Castorp not really comprehensible speaking - to {831} selected ones, the Attention-grabbing gestures, the delicately nuanced, cultivated, precise and clean cultural gestures of a conductor, the index finger curved in a circle with the thumb or the palm of the hand – broad, but nail-pointed – protective, cushioning, demanding attentiveness – and then the smiling attentiveness, which he caused to be disappointed by the intangibility of his so strongly prepared statement - or rather not really to be disappointed, but to be transformed into delighted amazement; for the strength, delicacy and importance of the preparation made up for what was lacking to a high degree, and had a satisfying, entertaining, even enriching effect in itself. Sometimes the utterance was not made at all. He delicately placed his hand on the forearm of his neighbor on the left, a young Bulgarian scholar, or on Madame Chauchats on his right, then raised that hand obliquely upward, commanding silence and suspense for what he was about to say, and with raised eyebrows so that the wrinkles running at right angles from his forehead to the outer corners of his eyes deepened like a mask, he looked down on the tablecloth next to the man so bound, while his large, torn lips, parted, seemed about to reveal something of the utmost importance. After a while, however, he exhaled, gave up, waved, as it were, ""Stir,"" and turned back to his coffee, which he had had extra strong served in his own machine, without having achieved anything.","“Yes, I expect we shall,” said Hans Castorp. We have left it to him to describe the unlooked-for guest, and he has not come badly off—we could scarcely add anything essential to the picture. He had a good view; as we know, he had in Clavdia’s absence moved closer to the “good” Russian table; the one where he now sat stood parallel with hers, only rather farther away from the verandah door. Both he and Peeperkorn were on the inner and narrow side of their respective tables, and thus, in a way, neighbours, Hans Castorp being slightly in the Dutchman’s rear, very advantageously placed to observe him, as also to look at the three-quarter view which Frau Chauchat’s profile presented. We might round out Hans Castorp’s description by a few notes: as, that the Dutchman’s nose was large and fleshy, his mouth large too, and bare of moustaches, the lips of irregular shape, as though chapped. His hands were fairly broad, with long, pointed nails; he used them freely as he talked, and he talked almost continuously, though Hans Castorp failed to get his drift. Those adequate, compelling, cleanly attitudes of the hands—so varied, so full of subtle nuances—possessed a technique like that of an orchestral conductor. He would curve forefinger and thumb to a circle; extend the palm, that was so broad, with nails so pointed, to hush, to caution, to enjoin attention—and then, having by such means led up to some stupendous utterance, produce an anticlimax by saying something his audience could not quite grasp. Yet this, perhaps, was less a disappointment than it was a conversion of expectancy into ecstatic amaze; for the speaking gesture made good what he did not say, and was of itself alone vastly satisfying and diverting. Sometimes, indeed, after leading up to his climax, he left it out altogether. He would lay his hand tenderly on the arm of the young Bulgarian scholar next him, or on Frau Chauchat ’s on the other side; then lift it obliquely for silence, create suspense for what he was about to say, wrinkling high his brows, so that the lines running upwards from the outer corners of his eyes were deepened like those on a mask; he would look down on the cloth before his neighbour’s place, and from his thick, distorted lips words of the highest import seemed about to issue then, after more pause, he would breathe an outward breath, give up the struggle, nod, as though to say “As you were,” and return undelivered to his coffee, which was served to him of extra strength, in his own machine.","“Yes, I suppose we shall,” Hans Castorp said. It has been left to him to provide a general description of this new, unexpected guest, and he did not do a bad job of it—we could not have done all that much better ourselves. To be sure, he had observed Peeperkorn from the best possible position. As we know, during Clavdia’s absence he had moved into neighborly proximity to the Good Russian table, which, although parallel to his own, was pushed slightly forward toward the veranda door. Hans Castorp and Peeperkorn were both seated at the narrow end of their respective tables, their backs to the middle of the room, more or less beside one another, with the Dutchman a little ahead of Hans Castorp, making discreet observation easy—and he could also glance across and see Frau Chauchat in three-quarter profile. Supplemental to Hans Castorp’s accomplished sketch , we might add that Peeperkorn’s upper lip was clean-shaven, his nose large and fleshy, and his mouth equally large, with irregularly shaped lips that looked somehow ragged. His hands, moreover, were rather broad, but ended in long tapering fingernails; and he used them when he spoke (and he spoke in an almost incessant stream, although Hans Castorp could not quite comprehend what was said) in a series of exquisite gestures that riveted his listeners’ interest—the subtly nuanced, well-chosen, precise, tidy, cultured gestures of an orchestra conductor— a forefinger bent to form a circle with a thumb or a palm held out wide, but with tapering nails, to caution, to subdue, to demand attention, only to disappoint his now smiling, attentive listeners with one of his very robustly prepared, but incomprehensible phrases; or rather, he did not so much disappoint people as transform smiles into looks of delighted amazement, because the robustness, subtlety, and significance of the preparation largely compensated, even after the fact, for what he failed to say and produced a satisfying, amusing, and enriching effect all its own. Sometimes it would be followed by no utterance at all. He would gently lay one hand on the forearm of the tablemate to his left, a young Bulgarian teacher, or on Madame Chauchat’s to his right, then raise that same hand at an angle to command them all to sit in silent expectation of what he was about to say, would then gaze down at a spot on the tablecloth in the vicinity of his captive—lifting his eyebrows until the creases, which started up from the corners of his eyes and then turned in a right angle across his brow, grew even deeper and more masklike—and open his large, ragged lips as if he were about to utter something of vast import. After a moment, however, he would exhale, forgo it all, wave it aside as if to say, “At ease!”"
"»Ich will nicht so sagen,« murmelte Joachim, »bitte, schiebe es nicht auf mich. Es sind ja weitläufige Dinge, mit denen du dich beschäftigst des Abends, wenn du liegst.«","'I don't want to put it that way,' murmured Joachim, 'please don't blame me. It's a wide-ranging affair that you occupy yourself with in the evening when you're lying down.""","“But I don’t like,” growled Joachim. “Pray don’t put it off on me. Pretty large concerns you occupy yourself with, nights when you do your cure.”","“I don’t want to put it that way,” Joachim muttered, “please don’t lay the blame on me. Those are awfully grand notions you’re playing with when you’re lying there of an evening.”"
"»Glauben Sie ihnen nicht, Ingenieur, glauben Sie ihnen niemals, wenn sie schimpfen! Das tun sie alle ohne Ausnahme, obgleich sie sich nur zu sehr zu Hause fühlen. Führen ein Lotterleben und erheben auch noch Anspruch auf Mitleid, dünken sich zur Bitterkeit berechtigt, zur Ironie, zum Zynismus! ›An diesem Lustort!‹ Ist es vielleicht kein Lustort? Ich will meinen, daß es einer ist, und zwar in des Wortes zweifelhaftester Bedeutung! ›Betrogen‹, sagt dies Frauenzimmer; ›an diesem Lustort um das Leben betrogen.‹ Aber entlassen Sie sie in die Ebene, und ihr Lebenswandel dort unten wird keinen Zweifel darüber lassen, daß sie es darauf anlegt, baldmöglichst wieder heraufzukommen. Ach ja, die Ironie! Hüten Sie sich vor der hier gedeihenden Ironie, Ingenieur! Hüten Sie sich überhaupt vor dieser geistigen Haltung! Wo sie nicht ein gerades und {336}klassisches Mittel der Redekunst ist, dem gesunden Sinn keinen Augenblick mißverständlich, da wird sie zur Liederlichkeit, zum Hindernis der Zivilisation, zur unsauberen Liebelei mit dem Stillstand, dem Ungeist, dem Laster. Da die Atmosphäre, in der wir leben, dem Gedeihen dieses Sumpfgewächses offenbar sehr günstig ist, darf ich hoffen oder muß fürchten, daß Sie mich verstehen.«","'Don't believe them, Engineer, never believe them when they scold! They all do without exception, although they only feel too much at home. They lead a dissolute life and even lay claim to pity, they think they are entitled to bitterness, to irony, to cynicism! ›At this place of pleasure!‹ Is it perhaps not a place of pleasure? I want to think that it is one, and in the most dubious sense of the word! ""Betrayed,"" says this woman; 'cheated of her life in this place of pleasure.' But release her to the plain, and her conduct down there will leave no doubt that she is anxious to come up again as soon as possible. Ah yes, the irony! Beware of the irony that thrives here, engineer! Beware of this mental attitude at all! Where it is not a straight and classic means of eloquence, not for a moment misunderstood by the sane mind, it becomes licentiousness, an obstacle to civilization, an unclean flirtation with stagnation, non-spirit, vice. As the atmosphere in which we live is evidently very favorable to the growth of this marsh-growth, I may hope or fear that you will understand me.'","As they went out he said to Hans Castorp: “Don’t you believe them, Engineer, never believe them when they grumble. They all do it, without exception, and all of them are only too much at home up here. They lead a loose and idle life, and imagine themselves entitled to pity, and justified of their bitterness, irony, and cynicism. ‘ This pleasure resort,’ she said. Well, isn’t it a pleasure resort, then? In my humble opinion it is, and in a very questionable sense too. So life is a ‘sell,’ up here at this pleasure resort! But once let them go down below and their manner of life will be such as to leave no doubt that they mean to come back again. Irony, forsooth! Guard yourself, Engineer, from the sort of irony that thrives up here; guard yourself altogether from taking on their mental attitude! Where irony is not a direct and classic device of oratory, not for a moment equivocal to a healthy mind, it makes for depravity, it becomes a drawback to civilization, an unclean traffic with the forces of reaction, vice, and materialism. As the atmosphere in which we live is obviously very favourable to such miasmic growths, I may hope, or rather, I must fear, that you understand my meaning.”","Settembrini had been standing close by, too, a toothpick between his lips, and as they were leaving he said to Hans Castorp, “Don’t believe them, my good engineer, never believe them when they squawk—and there’s not a one who doesn’t, although they all feel very much at home here. Lead a free and easy life—and then demand you pity them. Think they have a right to bitterness, irony, cynicism. ‘ At this cozy resort!’ Well, isn’t it cozy? I would certainly say it is, and in the most dubious sense of the word. ‘ Cheated,’ the little minx says—‘cheated out of everything in life at this cozy resort.’ But send her back to the plains and her life down there would leave you in no doubt that her sole object was to get back up here as soon as possible. Ah yes, irony! Beware of the irony that flourishes here, my good engineer. Beware of it in general as an intellectual stance. When it is not employed as an honest device of classical rhetoric, the purpose of which no healthy mind can doubt for a moment, it becomes a source of depravity, a barrier to civilization, a squalid flirtation with inertia, nihilism, and vice. And since the atmosphere in which we live provides very favorable conditions for this swamp plant to flourish, I may hope—or perhaps I must fear—that you do understand me.”"
"»Noch nicht«, antwortete Hans Castorp.","""Not yet,"" replied Hans Castorp.","“Not yet,” Hans Castorp answered.","“Not yet,” Hans Castorp replied."
"»Placet experiri«, hatte Hans Castorp die Frechheit zu antworten, und Herr Settembrini verließ ihn, – worauf denn frei{961}lich der allein Gebliebene noch längere Zeit, ohne weiterzulegen, den Kopf in die Hand gestützt, an seinem Tische inmitten des weißen Zimmers sitzenblieb, grübelnd und im Innersten grauenhaft berührt von dem nicht geheueren und schiefen Zustand, worin er die Welt befangen sah, von dem Grinsen des Dämons und Affengottes, unter dessen rat- und zügellose Herrschaft er sie geraten fand, und des Name »Der große Stumpfsinn« war.","""Placet experiri,"" Hans Castorp had the nerve to answer, and Herr Settembrini left him - whereupon the one who remained alone for a long time, without going any further, leaning his head on his hand, at his table in the middle of the white Zimmers remained seated, brooding and deeply moved by the unsettling and crooked state in which he saw the world, by the grin of the demon and monkey god, under whose helpless and unbridled rule he found it fallen, and by the name ""The great one was stupid.","“Placet experiri,” Hans Castorp was so pert as to reply to him. Herr Settembrini left; and the abandoned one sat long, at his table in the middle of his white room, his chin supported on his hand, and brooded; shuddering in the very core of him at the cross-purposes everything in the world had got into, at the grinning and grimacing of the demons and ape-headed gods into whose hands it had fallen, at their unbridled domination, the name of which was “The Great God Dumps.”","“Placet experiri,” Hans Castorp had the impudence to reply, and Herr Settembrini departed—and then, to be sure, once left to his own devices, the young man did not lay out his cards again, but sat for a long time at the table in his white room, his head propped in his hand, brooding, gripped by the horror of the eerie and skewed state in which he saw the world entrapped, by the fear of the grinning demon and monkey-god in whose crazed and unrestrained power he now found himself—and whose name was “The Great Stupor.”"
"{849}»Kreischen Sie, kreischen Sie, Madame!« sagte er. »Es klingt schrill und lebensvoll und kommt aus tiefster – Trinken Sie, laben Sie Ihr Herz zu neuen –« Und er schenkte ihr ein, schenkte auch seinen Nachbarn und sich selber ein, bestellte drei neue Flaschen und stieß mit Wehsal und der innerlich verödeten Frau Magnus an, da diese beiden ihm der Belebung am bedürftigsten schienen. Rasch färbten die Gesichter sich hoch und höher von dem in Wahrheit wundervollen Wein, mit Ausnahme desjenigen Doktor Ting-Fus, das unveränderlich gelb blieb, mit jettschwarzen Rattenschlitzen darin, und der mit verstecktem Kichern sehr hohe Einsätze machte, und zwar mit unverschämtem Glück. Andere wollten nicht zurückstehen. Staatsanwalt Paravant forderte schwimmenden Blickes das Schicksal heraus, indem er zehn Franken auf eine nur mäßig hoffnungsvolle Anfangskarte setzte, überkaufte sich erblassend und gewann das Geld, da Herr Albin in trügerischem Vertrauen auf ein As, das er erhalten, alle Einsätze hatte dublieren lassen, verdoppelt zurück. Das waren Erschütterungen, die sich nicht auf die Person dessen beschränkten, der sie sich bereitete. Der Kreis nahm teil daran, und selbst Herr Albin, der an kalter Umsicht mit den Croupiers des Kasinos von Monte Carlo wetteiferte, wo er Stammgast zu sein erklärte, war seiner Erregung nur unzulänglich Herr. Auch Hans Castorp spielte hoch; ebenso die Kleefeld und Frau Chauchat. Man ging zu den »Touren« über, spielte »Eisenbahn«, »Meine Tante, deine Tante« und das gefährliche »Différence«. Jubel und Verzweiflungsausbrüche, Entladungen der Wut und hysterische Lachanfälle, hervorgerufen durch den Reiz, den das bübische Glück auf die Nerven ausübte, ereigneten sich, und sie waren echt und ernst, – nicht anders hätten sie lauten können in den Wechselfällen des Lebens selbst.","{849}""Screech, screech, madame!"" he said. ""It sounds shrill and full of life and comes from the deepest - drink, refresh your heart to new ones -"" And he poured out her, poured out for his neighbors and himself, ordered three new bottles and clinked glasses with Wehsal and the inwardly desolate woman Magnus as these two seemed to him the most in need of revitalization. Quickly the faces stained higher and higher with the truly wonderful wine, except for that Doctor Ting-Fu, who remained invariably yellow, with jet-black rat slits in it, and who, with hidden giggles, was betting very high, and with unashamed luck. Others didn't want to stand back. Public prosecutor Paravant challenged fate with a swimming gaze by betting ten francs on an only moderately hopeful starting card, went pale and won the money, since Mr. Albin, deceptively trusting an ace he had received, had all his stakes doubled back. These were shocks that were not limited to the person who caused them. The circle took part, and even Mr. Albin, who rivaled the croupiers of the Monte Carlo casino, where he professed to be a regular, in cold circumspection, could only inadequately control his excitement. Hans Castorp also played high; likewise Kleefeld and Mrs. Chauchat. They switched to the ""tours,"" played ""railway,"" ""my aunt, your aunt,"" and the dangerous ""différence."" Jubilation and outbursts of despair, outbursts of anger and fits of hysterical laughter, aroused by the stimulus that boyish happiness exerted on the nerves, occurred, and they were genuine and serious—they could not have sounded otherwise in the vicissitudes of life itself.","“Squeal away, madame, squeal away,” said he. “It sounds shrill and full of life, it wells up from depths—drink, madame, drink and refresh yourself for new efforts.” He filled her glass, also his neighbour’s and his own, ordered three more bottles, and clicked glasses with Wehsal and Frau Magnus the inly wasted one; they two seeming to stand in most need of enlivenment. Faces flushed more and more, from the effects of the truly marvellous wine—only Dr. Ting-fu’s remained unchangingly yellow, with jet-black slits of eyes. He staked very high, with his little suppressed giggle, and was shamelessly lucky. Lawyer Paravant, his gaze a-swim, challenged fate by putting ten francs on an only moderately hopeful opening card, bought until he was pale in the face, and then won twice his money back; for Herr Albin had rashly doubled on the strength of an ace he received. Not only the persons involved felt the shock of these events; the whole circle shared the shattering effect. Even Herr Albin, whose sangfroid outdid the croupiers of Monte Carlo, where, according to him, he was an old habitué, now scarcely mastered his excitement. Hans Castorp played high, so did Frau Stöhr and the Kleefeld, Frau Chauchat as well. They went the rounds: played Chemin de fer, “ My aunt, your aunt,” and the perilous Différence. There were outbursts of jubilation and despair, explosions of rage, attacks of hysterical laughter—all due to the reaction of this unlawful pleasure upon their nerves; and all perfectly serious and genuine. The chances and changes of life itself would have called up in them no other reaction.","“Squeal, madame, squeal,” he said. “The sound is shrill, yet full of life and emerges from deepest—but drink, regale your heart anew. “ And he poured for her, poured for his neighbor and himself, ordered three more bottles, and touched glasses with Wehsal and Frau Magnus—still wasting away on the inside—since these two seemed most in need of cheering up. Faces quickly took on higher and higher color from the truly marvelous wine—with the exception of Dr. Ting-Fu’s. It remained as yellow as ever, and the ratlike slits shone jet-black; stifling his giggles, he placed very high wagers—and had shamelessly good luck. And the others did not want to be left behind. His gaze floating vaguely, Prosecutor Paravant defied fate by betting ten francs on a less than promising first card, turned pale each time he paid for another, and won twice his money back, because Herr Albin had foolishly put his trust in the ace he had been dealt and doubled every bet. And the thrill was not limited to the person who instigated it. The whole table felt it; even Herr Albin—who wagered with the cold calculation of a croupier in a Monte Carlo casino, where he claimed to have been a regular patron—only partially mastered his agitation. Hans Castorp played for high stakes as well, as did Hermine Kleefeld and Frau Chauchat. They moved on to other games: tours; chemin de fer; ma tante, ta tante, and the ever-risky différence. And each time rascal luck tickled their nerves, there would be a moment of exaltation or despair, an eruption of anger or a hysterical fit of laughter, and all their outbursts were in genuine earnest and would have sounded no different had these been the ups and downs in life’s fortunes."

Anyway, they’re not playing serious tennis—it’s more for the outfits. And as far as not obeying orders goes, lots of forbidden games are played here—poker, you know, and petits chevaux in certain hotels. We can be discharged for playing that, they say it’s the most unwholesome of all. But there are plenty of people who sneak past the guards in the evening and come down here to gamble.

You’re collapsed like a punctured tire—if some first-class excitement doesn’t come along every day, you pull a face as though you were saying: ‘H’m, small potatoes and few in the hill!’ Am I right, or am I not?”","He said to Hans Castorp: “Castorp, old pal, you’re bored. I see you every day pulling that long face, tedium written all over it. You’re jaded, Castorp. You’ve been pampered with thrills, and if you don’t get a first-class kick every day, you sulk and fret about in the doldrums. Am I right or wrong?”"
"Diese Prozesse also, die in der Berghofgesellschaft und besonders unter der febrilen Jugend anhängig waren, und bei denen die Balkondurchgänge (an den Glaswänden vorbei und das Geländer entlang) offenbar eine bedeutende Rolle spielten: diese Vorgänge hatte man im Sinn, sie bildeten einen Hauptbestandteil der hiesigen Lebensluft, – und auch damit ist das, was hier vorschwebt, nicht eigentlich ausgedrückt. Hans Castorp hatte nämlich den eigentümlichen Eindruck, daß auf einer Grundangelegenheit, welcher überall in der Welt eine hinlängliche, in Ernst und Scherz sich äußernde Wichtigkeit zugebilligt wird, hierorts denn doch ein Ton-, Wert- und Bedeutungszeichen lag, so schwer und vor Schwere so neu, daß es die Sache selbst in einem völlig neuen und, wenn nicht schrecklichen, so doch in seiner Neuheit erschreckenden Lichte erscheinen ließ. Indem wir dies aussagen, verändern wir unsere Mienen und bemerken, daß, wenn wir von den fraglichen Beziehungen bisher in einem leichten und spaßhaften Ton gesprochen haben sollten, es aus denselben geheimen Gründen geschehen wäre, aus denen es so oft geschieht, ohne daß für die Leichtigkeit oder Spaßhaftigkeit der Sache damit irgendetwas bewiesen wäre; und in der Sphäre, wo wir uns befinden, wäre das in der Tat noch weniger der Fall als anderwärts. Hans Castorp hatte geglaubt, sich auf jene gern bewitzelte Grundangelegenheit im üblichen Maße zu verstehen, und mochte mit Recht so geglaubt haben. Nun erkannte er, daß er sich im Flachlande nur sehr unzulänglich darauf verstanden, eigentlich sich in einfältiger Unwissenheit darüber befunden hatte, – {361}während hier persönliche Erfahrungen, deren Natur wir mehrfach anzudeuten versuchten, und die ihm in gewissen Augenblicken den Ausruf »Mein Gott!« abpreßten, ihn allerdings von innen her befähigten, den steigernden Akzent des Unerhörten, Abenteuerlich-Namenlosen wahrzunehmen und zu begreifen, den unter Denen hier oben die Sache allgemein und für jeden trug. Nicht daß man nicht auch hier darüber gewitzelt hätte. Aber weit mehr noch als unten trug hier diese Manier das Gepräge des Unsachgemäßen, sie hatte etwas Zähneklapperndes und Kurzatmiges, was sie als durchsichtigen Deckmantel für die darunter verborgene oder vielmehr nicht zu verbergende Not allzu deutlich kennzeichnete. Hans Castorp erinnerte sich des fleckigen Erblassens, das Joachim gezeigt hatte, als jener zum ersten und einzigen Mal in der unschuldig neckenden Art des Tieflandes die Rede auf Marusjas Körperlichkeit gebracht hatte. Er erinnerte sich auch der kalten Blässe, die, als er Frau Chauchat vom einfallenden Abendlichte befreit, sein eigenes Gesicht überzogen hatte, – und daran, daß er sie vorher und nachher bei verschiedenen Gelegenheiten auf manchem fremden Gesicht gewahr geworden war: auf zweien zugleich in der Regel, zum Beispiel auf den Gesichtern der Frau Salomon und des jungen Gänser in jenen Tagen, da das, was Frau Stöhr so redensartlich bezeichnet, sich zwischen ihnen angebahnt hatte. Er erinnerte sich, sagen wir, daran und verstand, daß es unter solchen Umständen nicht nur sehr schwer gewesen wäre, sich nicht zu »verraten«, sondern daß auch die Bemühung darum nur wenig gelohnt haben würde. Mit anderen Worten: es mochte denn doch wohl nicht allein Hoch- und Treuherzigkeit, sondern auch eine gewisse Ermutigung durch die Atmosphäre im Spiele sein, wenn Hans Castorp sich wenig bemüßigt fand, seinen Empfindungen Zwang anzutun und aus seinem Zustande ein Hehl zu machen.","These processes, then, which were pending in Berghof society and especially among the febrile youth, and in which the balcony passages (past the glass walls and along the railing) apparently played an important role: these processes were in mind, they formed a main part of the local atmosphere, - and even that does not really express what is in mind here. Hans Castorp had the peculiar impression that a fundamental matter, which is accorded sufficient importance all over the world, expressed in seriousness and jesting, here was a sign of tone, value and meaning, so heavy and so heavy with weight new, in that it cast the thing itself in an entirely new and, if not terrible, at least startling in its novelty light. In saying this we change our countenances and observe that if we had hitherto spoken of the relations in question in a light and joking tone, it would have been for the same secret reasons for which it is so often done, without the Ease or fun of the matter to prove anything; and in the sphere in which we find ourselves this would indeed be even less the case than elsewhere. Hans Castorp had believed that he had the usual understanding of this basic matter, which he liked to joke about, and he might have been right to believe so. Now he realized that in the lowlands he understood it only very inadequately, actually found himself in simple ignorance about it - {361}while here personal experiences, the nature of which we have tried to indicate several times, and which at certain moments made him exclaim ""My God!' but enabled him from within to perceive and understand the increasing accent of the outrageous, adventurous and nameless, which among those up here the matter carried generally and for everyone. Not that it wasn't joked about here, too. But far more so than below, this mannerism bore the stamp of inappropriateness, it had something chattering of teeth and shortness of breath, which all too clearly marked it as a transparent cloak for the need that was hidden or rather could not be concealed underneath. Hans Castorp remembered the blotchy pallor that Joachim had shown when, for the first and only time, he had mentioned Marusja's physicality in the innocently teasing way of the lowlands. He also remembered the cold pallor that had covered his own face when he freed Frau Chauchat from the falling evening light - and that before and after on various occasions he had noticed it on many a stranger's face: on two at the same time in as a rule, for example on the faces of Frau Salomon and young Gänser in those days when what Frau Stöhr so eloquently describes had begun to develop between them. He remembered it, shall we say, and understood that under such circumstances it would not only have been very difficult not to ""betray"" oneself, but that the effort to do so would have been of little use. In other words: it was not just generosity and ingenuity, but also a certain encouragement from the atmosphere at play, that Hans Castorp felt little need to force his feelings and to make a secret of his condition.","These affairs then—in which, of course, the passage along the balconies, at the end of the glass partitions, played a considerable rôle—were rife in Berghof society, particularly among the fevered youth. They occupied people’s minds, they were a salient feature of life up here—and even in saying thus much we are far from having precisely defined the position with regard to them. Hans Castorp, on this subject, received a singular impression: it was that a certain fundamental fact of life, which is conceded the world over to be of great importance, and is the fertile theme of constant allusion, both in jest and earnest, that this fundamental fact of life bore up here an entirely altered emphasis. It was weighty with a new weight; it had an accent, a value, and a significance which were utterly novel—and which set the fact itself in a light to make it look much more alarming than it had been before. Thus far, whenever we have referred to any questionable performances at the Berghof, we have done so in what may have seemed a light and jesting tone; this without prejudice to our real opinion as to the levity, or otherwise, of the performances, and solely for the usual obscure reasons which prompt other people to adopt the same. But as a matter of fact, that tone was far less usual in our present sphere than it is elsewhere in the world. Hans Castorp had considered himself pretty well-informed on the subject of the above-named “fact of life” which has always and everywhere been such a favourite target for shafts of wit. And he may have been right in so considering. But now he found that the knowledge he had had down in the flat-land had been most inadequate, that he had actually been in a state of simple ignorance. For his personal emotions in the time of his stay up here—upon the nature of which we have been at some pains to enlighten the reader, and which had been at moments so acute as to wring from the young man that cry of “Oh, my God!”—had opened his eyes, had made him capable of hearing and comprehending the wild, the overstrained, the namelessly extravagant key in which all the “affairs” up here were set. Not that, even up here, they did not make jests on the subject. But up here, far more than down below, jests seemed out of place. They made one’s teeth to chatter, and took away one’s breath, they betrayed themselves too plainly for what they were, a thin and obvious disguise for a hidden extremity—or rather, an extremity impossible to hide. Hans Castorp well remembered the mottled pallor of Joachim’s skin when, for the first and only time, he had innocently alluded to Marusja’s physical charms in the light tone he might have assumed at home. He remembered the chill withdrawal of the blood from his own face, the time he had drawn the curtain to shield Madame Chauchat from the sun; he knew that he had seen the same look on other faces up here, both before and since— he usually remarked it in pairs, as, for example, on the faces of Frau Salomon and young Gänser, in the beginning of that relation between them so happily described by Frau Stöhr. Hans Castorp, we say, recalled all this, and realized that under such circumstances it would not only have been very hard for him not to “betray himself,” but that the effort would not have been worth his pains. In other words, not alone the noble simplicity which did him honour, but also a certain sympathetic something in the air urged him not to do violence to his feelings or make any secret of his condition.","These were the kinds of suits pending among the residents of the Berghof, especially among its feverish youth; and apparently one major factor in all of them was the passageway along the balconies—where one slipped past glass partitions and kept to the railing. These proceedings, then, occupied people’s minds, they were an essential component of the local ambiance—and even in saying that, we have not really expressed what was going on. Hans Castorp, in particular, had the funny feeling that in this locale a basic fact of life—which is granted sufficient importance everywhere in the world, whether spoken of in earnest or jest—acquired an accent, a value, a pattern of meaning so serious, and by its very seriousness so new, that this basic fact was cast in an entirely new light, which, if not absolutely appalling, was at least appalling in its newness. Simply mentioning such things causes our own expression to change, and we notice that, although thus far we may have spoken of such questionable liaisons in a light and jocular tone, we did it for the same mysterious reasons people usually speak of them in that fashion—not that it in any way proves the subject to be a matter of levity and jest. And in the environs where we now find ourselves, such would be the case even less than elsewhere. Hans Castorp had believed his was a typical understanding of this fact of life, which normally serves as a favorite topic of jokes, and he may have been right in his belief. But he now realized that he had understood it very inadequately down in the flatlands, had actually been in a state of innocent ignorance. His personal experiences here—the nature of which we have attempted to indicate on several occasions—had forced him at certain moments to cry, “My God!” But they also enabled him to perceive, understand, and internalize the ever-intensifying accent on shock and indescribable adventure that people up here, both generally and individually, attributed to the matter. Not that people did not joke about it here as well. But to a far greater extent than down below, there was something inappropriate about the jokes, something to do with chattering teeth and shortness of breath, something that marked such jokes all too clearly as transparent disguises for the anguish hidden beneath them, or rather for the anguish impossible to hide. Hans Castorp recalled how Joachim’s face had turned blotchy and pale the one and only time he had tried to tease him in an innocent, flatland sort of way, by bringing the conversation around to Marusya’s physical attributes. He recalled the cool pallor on his own face the evening he had freed Frau Chauchat from the setting sun; and how, on various occasions before and since, he had seen that same pallor on many another face, usually on two at once—for instance on Frau Salomon’s and young Gänser’s of late, ever since what Frau Stöhr had described in her colorful way had indeed come to pass. We repeat, he recalled all this and realized not only that it would have been difficult not to “betray” oneself under such circumstances, but also that the attempt would hardly have been worthwhile. In other words, if Hans Castorp saw no compelling reason to restrain his feelings and make a secret of his condition, that was probably due not merely to generosity of spirit and guilelessness, but also to a certain encouragement he breathed from the atmosphere all around him."
"»Ich wußte nicht, daß Sie prüde sind, Lodovico. Wenn man Sie den Mädchen zuzwinkern sieht … Wo bleibt die heidnische Unbefangenheit? Das Bett also ist der Ort der Beiwohnung des Minnenden mit dem Gemeinten und als Symbolum die beschauliche Abgeschiedenheit von Welt und Kreatur zum Zwekke der Beiwohnung mit Gott.«","'I didn't know you were a prude, Lodovico. When they see you winking at the girls... Where's the pagan innocence?

To see you looking at the girls. . . What has become of your pagan single-mindedness?

"Er hatte ein wenig Furcht vor schreckhaften Eindrücken gehabt, aber er fand sich enttäuscht: es ging ganz aufgeräumt zu hier im Saale, man hatte nicht das Gefühl, sich an einer Stätte des Jammers zu befinden. Gebräunte junge Leute beiderlei Geschlechts kamen trällernd herein, sprachen mit den Saaltöchtern und hieben mit robustem Appetit in das Frühstück ein. Auch reifere Personen waren da, Ehepaare, eine ganze Familie mit Kindern, die Russisch sprach, auch halbwüchsige Jungen. Die Frauen trugen fast sämtlich eng anliegende Jacken aus Wolle oder Seide, sogenannte Sweater, weiß oder farbig, mit Fallkragen und Seitentaschen, und es sah hübsch aus, wenn sie, beide Hände in diese Seitentaschen vergraben, standen und plauderten. An mehreren Tischen wurden Photographien herumgezeigt, neue, selbst angefertigte Aufnahmen ohne Zweifel; an einem anderen tauschte man Briefmarken. Es wurde vom Wetter gesprochen, davon, wie man geschlafen und wieviel {72}man morgens im Munde gemessen. Die meisten waren lustig, – ohne besonderen Grund wahrscheinlich, sondern nur, weil sie keine unmittelbaren Sorgen hatten und zahlreich beisammen waren. Einzelne freilich saßen, den Kopf in die Hände gestützt, am Tische und starrten vor sich hin. Man ließ sie starren und achtete nicht auf sie.","He had been a little afraid of frightening impressions, but he found himself disappointed: the hall was very tidy, one did not have the feeling of being in a place of misery. Tanned youths of both sexes came in, slurring, talking to the hall maids, and munching on breakfast with robust appetites. There were also more mature people, married couples, a whole family with children who spoke Russian, and adolescent boys too. Almost all the women wore tight-fitting jackets made of wool or silk, so-called sweaters, white or colored, with a fall collar and side pockets, and it looked pretty when they stood and chatted with both hands buried in these side pockets. Photographs were shown around several tables, new, home-made ones no doubt; at another one exchanged stamps. The weather was talked about, how one slept and how much one measured in the mouth in the morning. Most were jolly—probably for no particular reason, but only because they had no immediate concerns and were in large numbers. A few, of course, sat at the table with their heads in their hands and stared straight ahead. They let her stare and paid no attention to her.","He had been a little afraid of unpleasant impressions, but found himself agreeably disappointed. The room was lively, one had not the least feeling of being in a place of suffering. Tanned young people of both sexes came in humming, spoke to the waitresses, and fell to upon the viands with robust appetite. There were older people, married couples, a whole family with children, speaking Russian, and half-grown lads. The women wore chiefly close-fitting jackets of wool or silk—the so-called sweater—in white or colours, with turnover collars and side pockets; they would stand with hands thrust deep in these pockets, and talk—it looked very pretty. At some tables photographs were being handed about—amateur photography, no doubt—at another stamps were being exchanged. The talk was of the weather, of how one had slept, of what one had “measured in the mouth” on rising. Nearly everybody seemed in good spirits, probably on no other grounds than that they were in numerous company and had no immediate cares. Here and there, indeed, sat someone who rested his head on his hand and stared before him. They let him stare, and paid no heed.","He had been a little afraid of the dreadful effect all this might have on him, but found himself disappointed in that—the dining hall atmosphere was quite congenial, one had no sense of being in a place of misery.

There were more mature people as well, married couples, a whole family with children, including teenage boys, all speaking Russian. Almost all the women wore close-fitting jackets of wool or silk, called “sweaters,” in white or bright colors, with shawl collars and side pockets; it looked very pretty when they just stood there chatting, both hands buried in their sweater pockets. Photographs were passed around at several tables—recent shots they had taken themselves, no doubt; at one table they were trading postage stamps. The talk was of the weather, of how one had slept and what one’s “oral measurement” had been that morning. Most of them were cheerful—for no particular reason presumably, but simply because they had no immediate cares and were assembled in considerable numbers. A few people, to be sure, sat at the table with heads propped in their hands, staring straight ahead. People let them stare and paid them no attention."
"Das wurde abgelehnt. Nein, es passe nicht, es wolle sich nicht schicken, wurde ihm geantwortet, – zuerst von Herrn Settembrini mit einem Lächeln, das fein und schmerzlich war, dann auch, nach kurzer Überlegung, von Ferge und Wehsal, die ebenfalls ohne besondere Begründung fanden, es gehe nicht an, daß Hans Castorp sich an der Mensur in dieser Eigenschaft beteilige. Als Unparteiischer etwa – denn auch die Anwesenheit {1062}eines solchen gehörte ja zu den vorgeschriebenen ritterlichen Milderungen des Tierischen – möge er auf dem Kampfplatz zugegen sein. Selbst Naphta ließ sich durch den Mund seines Ehrengeschäftsträgers Wehsal in diesem Sinne vernehmen, und Hans Castorp war es zufrieden. Zeuge oder Unparteiischer, auf jeden Fall gewann er die Möglichkeit, Einfluß auf die Festsetzung der Modalitäten zu nehmen, was sich als bitter nötig erwies.","That was rejected. No, it doesn't fit, it doesn't want to be, he was answered - first by Mr. Settembrini with a smile that was delicate and painful, then also, after a short reflection, by Ferge and Wehsal, who also found, without any particular justification, it is not acceptable for Hans Castorp to take part in the mensur in this capacity. As an impartial, for example - for the presence of one {1062}was one of the prescribed knightly mitigations of the animalistic - he may be present on the battlefield. Even Naphta let himself be heard in this sense through the mouth of his honorary chargé d'affaires Wehsal, and Hans Castorp was satisfied. Witness or impartial, in any case he gained the opportunity to influence the determination of the modalities, which proved sorely needed.","The offer was refused. No, it was not fitting, it would not do, he was told: first by Herr Settembrini himself, with that fine, rueful smile; then, after brief consideration, by Ferge and Wehsal, who also, without specified reason, found it would not do for Hans Castorp to assist at the encounter in this capacity. As a neutral party, perhaps— the presence of such an one was a part of the prescribed chivalrous mitigations—he might be present. Even Naphta, through his second, let it be known that this was his view, and Hans Castorp was satisfied. As witness, or as neutral party, in either case he was able to exert his influence upon the details of the procedure now to be discussed and settled—an influence which proved necessary indeed.","His offer was refused. No, that would not do, it was not appropriate, he was told—first by Herr Settembrini with a smile both delicate and painful, and then after brief reflection, by Ferge and Wehsal, who likewise found it would be unsuitable for Hans Castorp to appear on the dueling ground in that capacity. He could attend as a neutral party, perhaps—the presence of such a person being among the chivalrous prescriptions for moderating beastliness. Even Naphta let it be known through his second , Wehsal, that this was his opinion, too—and Hans Castorp said all right. Witness or neutral party, in any case he would have a chance to influence decisions about the modalities, which proved sorely necessary."
"Hans Castorp hob den Zeigefinger, wie in der Schule. Er wünsche nach keiner Seite anzustoßen, sagte er, aber hier sei offenbar vom Fortschritt die Rede, vom menschlichen Fortschritt, also gewissermaßen von Politik und der beredsamen Republik und der Zivilisation des gebildeten Westens, und da meine er nun, daß der Unterschied, oder, wenn Herr Naphta denn durchaus wolle, der Gegensatz von Leben und Religion auf den von Zeit und Ewigkeit zurückzuführen sei. Denn Fortschritt sei nur in der Zeit; in der Ewigkeit sei keiner und auch keine Politik und Eloquenz. Dort lege man, sozusagen, in Gott den Kopf zurück und schließe die Augen. Und das sei der Unterschied von Religion und Sittlichkeit, konfus ausgedrückt.","Hans Castorp raised his index finger, like in school. He didn't want to offend either side, he said, but obviously we're talking about progress here, about human progress, that is, to a certain extent about politics and the eloquent republic and the civilization of the educated West, and he now means that the difference, or if Herr Naphta really wanted the contrast between life and religion to be traced back to that between time and eternity. For progress is only in time; in eternity there is none and also no politics and eloquence. There you put your head back, so to speak, in God and close your eyes. And that is the difference between religion and morality, to put it confusingly.","Hans Castorp, like a schoolboy, put up his hand. He wished, he said, not to offend either side. But since they were talking about progress, and thus, to a certain extent also, about politics, and the republic of eloquence and the civilization of the educated Occident, he might say that it seemed to him the difference—or, if Herr Naphta insisted, the antithesis—between life and religion went back to that between time and eternity. Only in time was there progress; in eternity there was none, nor any politics or eloquence either. There, so to speak, one laid one’s head back in God, and closed one’s eyes. And that was the difference between religion and morality—he was aware that he had put it very badly.","Hans Castorp raised a schoolboy forefinger. He did not wish to offend either side, he said, but apparently the subject had now turned to progress, to human progress, and so in a certain sense to politics, the republic of eloquence, the civilization of the educated West; and in that regard he would like to say that the difference, or if Herr Naphta preferred, the opposition between life and religion could be traced to that between time and eternity. Because progress occurred only within time; there was no progress in eternity, no politics or eloquence, either. There one laid one’s head back onto God, so to speak, and closed one’s eyes. And that was the difference between religion and morality—though put in a rather confused fashion."
"»Allerdings«, fuhr Naphta fort. »Diese menschlichen Geister haben den Gedanken einer selbsttätigen Vermehrung des Geldes als ekelhaft empfunden, alle Zins- und Spekulationsgeschäfte unter den Begriff des Wuchers fallen lassen und erklärt, daß jeder Reiche entweder ein Dieb oder eines Diebes Erbe sei. Sie sind weiter gegangen. Sie betrachteten, wie Thomas von Aquino, den Handel überhaupt, das reine Handelsgeschäft, das Kaufen und Verkaufen unter Einziehung eines Nutzens, aber ohne Bearbeitung, Verbesserung des wirtschaftlichen Gutes, als ein schimpfliches Gewerbe. Sie waren nicht geneigt, die Arbeit an und für sich sehr hoch zu schätzen, denn sie ist nur eine ethische Angelegenheit, keine religiöse, sie geschieht im Dienste des Lebens, nicht Gottes. Und wenn es sich denn bloß um das Leben handeln sollte und um Wirtschaft, so verlangten sie, daß produktive Werktätigkeit als Bedingung wirtschaftlichen Vorteils und als Maßstab der Achtbarkeit gelte. Ehrenwert war ihnen der Ackerbauer, der Handwerker, nicht der Händler, nicht der Industrielle. Denn sie wollten, daß die Produktion sich nach dem Bedürfnis richte, und verabscheuten die Massengütererzeugung. Nun denn – alle diese wirtschaftlichen Grundsätze und Maßstäbe halten nach jahrhundertelanger Verschüttung ihre Auferstehung in der modernen Bewegung des Kommunismus. Die Übereinstimmung ist vollkommen bis hinein in den Sinn des Herrschaftsanspruchs, den die internationale Arbeit gegen das internationale Händler- und Spekulantentum erhebt, das Weltproletariat, das heute die Humanität und die Kriterien des Gottesstaates der bürgerlich-kapitalistischen Verrottung entgegenstellt. Die Diktatur des Proletariats, diese politisch-wirtschaftliche Heilsforderung der {609}Zeit, hat nicht den Sinn der Herrschaft um ihrer selbst willen und in Ewigkeit, sondern den einer zeitweiligen Aufhebung des Gegensatzes von Geist und Macht im Zeichen des Kreuzes, den Sinn der Weltüberwindung durch das Mittel der Weltherrschaft, den Sinn des Überganges, der Transzendenz, den Sinn des Reiches. Das Proletariat hat das Werk Gregors aufgenommen, sein Gotteseifer ist in ihm, und so wenig wie er wird es seine Hand zurückhalten dürfen vom Blute. Seine Aufgabe ist der Schrecken zum Heile der Welt und zur Gewinnung des Erlösungsziels, der staats- und klassenlosen Gotteskindschaft.«","""Indeed,"" Naphta continued. “These human spirits found the idea of an automatic increase in money disgusting, dropped all interest and speculative transactions under the concept of usury and declared that every rich man is either a thief or a thief’s heir. You went further. Like Thomas Aquinas, they regarded trade in general, the pure trading business, buying and selling with the collection of a benefit, but without processing or improving the economic good, as a shameful trade. They were not inclined to value work in and of itself very highly, for it is only an ethical matter, not a religious one, it is done in the service of life, not God. And if it were merely a matter of life and economy, they demanded that productive labor should be a condition of economic advantage and a measure of respectability. The tiller of the land, the artisan, was honorable to them, not the trader, not the industrialist. For they wanted production to be according to need and abhorred mass production. Well then, all these economic principles and standards, after being buried for centuries, are resurrected in the modern movement of Communism. The agreement is complete right down to the sense of the claim to power that international work raises against international traders and speculators, the world proletariat, which today opposes humanity and the criteria of the theocracy to bourgeois-capitalist decay. The dictatorship of the proletariat, this political-economic demand for salvation of the {609}time, does not have the meaning of domination for its own sake and for eternity, but rather that of a temporary abolition of the antithesis of spirit and power in the sign of the cross, the meaning of overcoming the world through the means of world domination, the meaning of transition, of transcendence, the meaning of empire. The proletariat has taken up Gregory's work, its zeal for God is in it, and just as little as he will be allowed to hold back its hand from the blood. His task is the terror for the salvation of the world and to win the goal of redemption, the state and classless childhood of God.«","“Quite,” said Naphta. “Indeed, these humane spirits were revolted by the idea of the automatic increase of money; they regarded as usury every kind of interest-taking and speculation, and declared that every rich man was either a thief or the heir of a thief. They went further. Like Thomas Aquinas, they considered trade, pure and simple, buying and selling for profit, without altering or improving the product, a contemptible occupation. They were not inclined to place a very high value on labour in and for itself, as being an ethical, not a religious concern, and performed not in the service of God, but as a part of the business of living. This being the case, they demanded that the measure of profit or of public esteem should be in proportion to the actual labour expended, and accordingly it was not the tradesman or the industrialist, but the labourer and the tiller of the soil, who were honourable in their eyes. For they were in favour of making production dependent upon necessity, and held mass production in abhorrence. Now, then: after centuries of disfavour these principles and standards are being resurrected by the modern movement of communism. The similarity is complete, even to the claim for world-domination made by international labour as against international industry and finance; the world-proletariat, which is today asserting the ideals of the Civitas Dei in opposition to the discredited and decadent standards of the capitalistic bourgeoisie. The dictatorship of the proletariat, the politico-economic means of salvation demanded by our age, does not mean domination for its own sake and in perpetuity; but rather in the sense of a temporary abrogation, in the Sign of the Cross, of the contradiction between spirit and force; in the sense of overcoming the world by mastering it; in a transcendental, a transitional sense, in the sense of the Kingdom. The proletariat has taken up the task of Gregory the Great, his religious zeal burns within it, and as little as he may it withhold its hand from the shedding of blood. Its task is to strike terror into the world for the healing of the world, that man may finally achieve salvation and deliverance, and win back at length to freedom from law and from distinction of classes, to his original status as child of God.”","“Indeed it is,” Naphta remarked. “These humane minds were disgusted by the idea of wealth increasing automatically and placed all speculation and transactions involving interest under the rubric of usury, making every rich man either a thief or the heir of a thief. They went even further. Like Thomas Aquinas, they regarded trade in general—the basic commercial act of buying and selling for a profit without having altered or improved the product—as a despicable occupation. They were not inclined to assign a high value to labor in and of itself, because it is an ethical, not a religious act, performed in the service of life, not of God. And since labor was concerned exclusively with life and its maintenance, they demanded that both personal profit and public esteem be measured by the productive effort involved. They considered the peasant and the craftsman honorable people, but not the merchant or the industrialist. They wanted goods to be produced on the basis of need and loathed the idea of mass production. Well, then—after having been buried for centuries, all these economic principles and standards have been resurrected in the modern movement of communism. The correspondence is perfect, down to the meaning of international labor’s claim of dominion over international marketeering and speculation. In the modern confrontation with bourgeois-capitalist rot, the world’s proletariat embodies the humanity and criteria of the City of God. The point of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the political-economic demand for salvation in our time, is not dominion for its own sake and for all eternity, but only a temporary abrogation of the polarities of mind and Spirit under the sign of the cross. It is a way of overcoming the world by ruling the world, a transition; its point is transcendence, the kingdom itself. The proletariat has taken up Gregory the Great’s task, his godly zeal burns within it, and its hands can no more refrain from shedding blood than could his. Its work is terror, that the world may be saved and the ultimate goal of redemption be achieved: the children of God living in a world without classes or laws.”"

"Nein, er war nicht rot oder blaß geworden, aber der Eindruck, den die unverhofften Nachrichten über Frau Chauchat auf ihn gemacht, äußerte sich in Reden, auf die denn freilich nur betretenes Schweigen die Antwort sein konnte. Joachim war weniger erschrocken; er kannte des Vetters Scharfköpfigkeit hier oben von früher her. Aber in Frau Ziemßens Augen malte sich größte Bestürzung; sie verhielt sich nicht anders, als habe Hans Castorp grobe Unanständigkeiten geäußert, und hob nach einer peinlichen Pause die Tafel mit Worten taktvoller Vertuschung auf. Bevor man sich trennte, teilte Hans Castorp die Order des Hofrats mit, daß Joachim jedenfalls morgen im Bett bleiben solle, bis jener ihn untersucht habe. Das Weitere werde sich finden. Dann lagen die drei Verwandten bald in ihren offenen Zimmern in der Frische der Hochgebirgs-Sommernacht, – ein jeder mit seinen Gedanken, Hans Castorp vornehmlich mit dem an Frau Chauchats binnen Halbjahrsfrist zu erwartende Wiederkehr.","No, he hadn't turned red or pale, but the impression made on him by the unexpected news about Frau Chauchat was expressed in speeches to which, of course, only embarrassed silence could have been the answer. Joachim was less frightened; he knew his cousin's keenness up here from before. But Frau Ziemssen's eyes showed the greatest dismay; she behaved no differently than if Hans Castorp had uttered gross indecency, and after an awkward pause picked up the slate with words of tactful cover-up. Before they parted, Hans Castorp informed Castorp of the Hofrat's order that Joachim should in any case stay in bed tomorrow until the latter had examined him. The rest will be found. Then the three relatives soon lay in their open rooms in the freshness of the high mountain summer night - each with his thoughts, Hans Castorp primarily with the expected return to Frau Chauchats within six months.","No, he neither paled nor flushed; but the impression the news had made upon him betrayed itself none the less; on such talk as this nothing but perplexed silence could supervene. Joachim, of course, was less taken aback than his mother, being acquainted from aforetime with his cousin’s mental volatility up here. But a great perturbation showed in Frau Ziemssen’s eyes, as though her nephew had uttered some gross impropriety; and after a painful pause she broke up the gathering by rising from table, with a phrase or so intended to gloze over the situation. Before they separated, Hans Castorp told them that Behrens’s order was for Joachim to remain in bed at least on the morrow, or until he had come to examine him. The rest would be decided later. Soon the three relatives lay each in his room, with the door open to the freshness of the summer night in this altitude, and each with his thoughts: Hans Castorp’s were chiefly concerned with Frau Chauchat’s return, to be expected within six months’ time.","No, he did not turn red or pale, but the impression this unexpected news of Frau Chauchat had on him was obvious from his words, to which, of course, the only possible reply was awkward silence. Joachim was less shocked; he knew from previous experience how subtle his cousin’s mind had become up here. But Frau Ziemssen’s eyes registered great consternation. She reacted exactly as if Hans Castorp’s remarks had been crude and indecent, and after an embarrassed silence she ended their meal with a few tactful words to gloss things over. Before they parted, Hans Castorp passed on the director’s order that Joachim should remain in bed the next day in any case, at least until the director examined him. As for everything else—well, they would see. And the three relatives were soon lying in their rooms, doors open to the fresh air of the Alpine summer night, each lost in her or his thoughts—Hans Castorp engrossed chiefly in the news that Frau Chauchat was expected to return before another six months had passed."
"Gegen zwei Uhr flog die Nachricht auf, »der Alte« – Hofrat Behrens also – nähere sich in Gewaltmärschen den Konversationsräumen. Panik wütete in demselben Augenblick unter der entnervten Gästeschaft. Stühle und Eiskübel stürzten. Man floh durch das Bibliothekszimmer. Peeperkorn, von königlichem Koller ergriffen bei der jähen Auflösung seines Lebensfestes, schlug wohl mit der Faust auf und sandte den Fortstiebenden etwas von »furchtsamen Sklaven« nach, ließ sich aber dann durch Hans Castorp und Frau Chauchat bis zu einem gewissen Grade mit dem Gedanken versöhnen, daß dies Gastmahl, das an sechs Stunden gedauert hatte, ohnehin einmal {866}sein Ende habe nehmen müssen, schenkte auch der Mahnung an das heilige Labsal des Schlafes sein Ohr und willigte ein, sich zu Bette geleiten zu lassen.","Around two o'clock the news broke that ""the old man"" - that is, Hofrat Behrens - was approaching the conversation rooms in forced marches. At the same moment, panic raged among the unnerved guests. Chairs and ice buckets fell. They fled through the library room. Peeperkorn, seized with royal frenzy at the abrupt end of his life festival, probably banged his fist and sent the fleeing party something about ""timid slaves,"" but then Hans Castorp and Frau Chauchat to a certain extent reconciled him to the idea that this banquet, which had lasted six hours, had to come to an end anyhow {866}, also listened to the admonition of the holy refreshment of sleep and agreed to be escorted to bed.","Toward two o’clock word flew about that “the old man”—in other words, Hofrat Behrens—was approaching by forced marches. Panic reigned among the nerveless company. Chairs and ice-pails were upset. They fled through the library. Peeperkorn raged at the precipitate breaking-up of the festivities, in kingly choler struck the table with his fist and called after the retreating “cowardly slaves”—but allowed Frau Chauchat and Hans Castorp to calm him with the consideration that the banquet had already lasted some six hours, and must in any case some time come to an end. He lent an ear when they murmured something about the “holy” boon of sleep, and yielded to their efforts to lead him away to bed.","Around two o’clock the rumor sprang up that “the boss”—Director Behrens, that is—was moving toward the social rooms at a forced march. And in that same moment, panic raged among the unnerved guests. Chairs and ice-buckets were upended. People fled via the library. In a fit of royal fury at the sudden disruption of his feast of life, Peeperkorn first banged his fist on the table and then called out after the scattering company—something about “spineless slaves”—but nevertheless reconciled himself somewhat to the idea presented by Hans Castorp and Frau Chauchat that his banquet had lasted for almost six hours now and would have to come to an end at some point in any case, even lent his ear to a reminder about sleep’s holy refreshment, and at last consented to let them escort him to bed."
"Von da an verzettelt sich die Reise, die solange großzügig, in direkten Linien vonstatten ging. Es gibt Aufenthalte und Umständlichkeiten. Beim Orte Rorschach, auf schweizerischem Gebiet, vertraut man sich wieder der Eisenbahn, gelangt aber vorderhand nur bis Landquart, einer kleinen Alpenstation, wo man den Zug zu wechseln gezwungen ist. Es ist eine Schmalspurbahn, die man nach längerem Herumstehen in windiger und wenig reizvoller Gegend besteigt, und in dem Augenblick, wo die kleine, aber offenbar ungewöhnlich zugkräftige Maschine sich in Bewegung setzt, beginnt der eigentlich abenteuerliche Teil der Fahrt, ein jäher und zäher Aufstieg, der nicht enden zu wollen scheint. Denn Station Landquart liegt vergleichsweise noch in mäßiger Höhe; jetzt aber geht es auf wilder, drangvoller Felsenstraße allen Ernstes ins Hochgebirge.","From then on, the journey, which had been generous and in direct lines for so long, got bogged down. There are stays and hassles. At the town of Rorschach, on Swiss territory, you trust the railway again, but for the time being you can only get as far as Landquart, a small Alpine station, where you are forced to change trains. It is a narrow-gauge railway, which one climbs after standing around for a long time in a windy and unattractive area, and the moment the small but apparently unusually powerful machine starts to move, the really adventurous part of the journey begins, a sudden and tough ascent , which doesn't seem to want to end. Because Station Landquart is comparatively still moderately high; but now it's going on a wild, busy rocky road in all seriousness into the high mountains.","At this point the route, which has been so far over trunk-lines, gets cut up. There are stops and formalities. At Rorschach, in Swiss territory, you take train again, but only as far as Landquart, a small Alpine station, where you have to change. Here, after a long and windy wait in a spot devoid of charm, you mount a narrow-gauge train; and as the small but very powerful engine gets under way, there begins the thrilling part of the journey, a steep and steady climb that seems never to come to an end. For the station of Landquart lies at a relatively low altitude, but now the wild and rocky route pushes grimly onward into the Alps themselves.","From there the path, which until now has followed grand, direct routes, turns choppy. There are stopovers and formalities. At Rorschach, a town in Swiss territory, you reboard a train that takes you only as far as Landquart, a small station in the Alps, where you must change trains again. After standing for a while in the wind, gazing at a rather uncharming landscape, you climb aboard a narrow-gauge train, and the moment the small, but uncommonly sturdy engine pulls out, the real adventure begins, a steep and dogged ascent that will never end, it seems. The station at Landquart lies at a relatively low altitude; but now your route takes you on a wild ride up into real mountains, along tracks that squeeze their way between walls of rock."
"»Ja, wenn man ihr aufpaßt, der Zeit, dann vergeht sie sehr langsam. Ich habe das Messen, viermal am Tage, ordentlich gern, weil man doch dabei merkt, was das eigentlich ist: eine Minute oder gar ganze sieben, – wo man sich hier die sieben Tage der Woche so gräßlich um die Ohren schlägt.«","'Yes, if you watch it, time, it goes by very slowly. I really like taking measurements, four times a day, because you notice what that actually means: one minute or even a full seven – when you’re beating around your head so horribly seven days of the week here.”","A little later he took the thermometer out of his mouth, looked at it, and said: “Yes, when you watch it, the time, it goes very slowly. I quite like the measuring, four times a day; for then you know what a minute—or seven of them actually amounts to, up here in this place, where the seven days of the week whisk by the way they do!”","After a while he took the thermometer out of his mouth, looked at it, and said, “Yes, when you pay close attention to it—time, I mean—it goes very slowly. I truly like measuring my temperature four times a day, because it makes you notice what one minute, or even seven, actually means—especially since the seven days of a week hang so dreadfully heavy on your hands here.”"
"Der Knabe, mit dem Hans Castorp sprach, hieß Hippe, mit Vornamen Pribislav. Als Merkwürdigkeit kam hinzu, daß das r dieses Vornamens wie sch auszusprechen war: es hieß »Pschibislav«; und dieser absonderliche Vorname stimmte nicht schlecht zu seinem Äußeren, das nicht ganz durchschnittsmäßig, entschieden etwas fremdartig war. Hippe, Sohn eines Historikers und Gymnasialprofessors, notorischer Musterschüler folglich und schon eine Klasse weiter als Hans Castorp, obgleich kaum älter als dieser, stammte aus Mecklenburg und war für seine Person offenbar das Produkt einer alten Rassenmischung, einer Versetzung germanischen Blutes mit wendisch-slawischem – oder auch umgekehrt. Zwar war er blond, – sein Haar war ganz kurz über dem Rundschädel geschoren. Aber seine Augen, blaugrau oder graublau von Farbe – es war eine etwas unbestimmte und mehrdeutige Farbe, die Farbe etwa eines fernen Gebirges –, zeigten einen eigentümlichen, schmalen und genau genommen sogar etwas schiefen Schnitt, und gleich darunter saßen die Backenknochen, vortretend und stark ausgeprägt, – eine Gesichtsbildung, die in seinem Falle durchaus nicht entstellend, sondern sogar recht ansprechend wirkte, die aber genügt hatte, ihm bei seinen Kameraden den Spitznamen »der Kirgise« einzutragen. Übrigens trug Hippe schon lange Hosen und dazu eine hochgeschlossene, blaue, im Rücken gezogene Joppe, auf deren Kragen einige Schuppen von seiner Kopfhaut zu liegen pflegten.","The boy Hans Castorp was talking to was called Hippe, his first name was Pribislav. As an added curiosity, the r of this first name had to be pronounced like sch: it was called ""Pschibislav""; and that odd first name did not go badly with his appearance, which was not quite average, decidedly alien. Hippe, son of a historian and high school professor, consequently a notorious model student and already a grade higher than Hans Castorp, although hardly older than him, came from Mecklenburg and was obviously the product of an old race mixture, a crossover of Germanic blood with Wendish-Slavic - or vice versa. It is true that he was blond – his hair was cropped very short above his rounded skull. But his eyes, blue-grey or gray-blue in color - it was a somewhat vague and ambiguous color, the color perhaps of a distant mountain range - had a peculiar, narrow and actually somewhat crooked cut, and just below were the cheekbones, prominent and strong pronounced - a face that in his case was not disfiguring at all, but actually quite appealing, but which was enough to earn him the nickname ""the Kyrgyz"" among his comrades. Incidentally, Hippe was already wearing long trousers and a high-necked, blue jacket pulled at the back, on the collar of which there used to be a few scales from his scalp.","He with whom Hans Castorp spoke was called Hippe, Pribislav Hippe. A peculiarity of this given name was that you were to pronounce it as though it were spelled Pschibislav; and the singularity of the appellation suited the lad’s appearance, which did indeed have something exotic about it. Hippe was the son of a scholar and history professor in the gymnasium. He was, by consequence, a notorious model pupil, and, though not much older than Hans Castorp, already a form higher up. He came from Mecklenburg and was in his person obviously the product of an ancient mixture of races, a grafting of Germanic stock with Slavic, or the reverse. True, his close-shorn round pate was blond; but the eyes were a grey-blue, or a blue-grey—an indefinite, ambiguous colour, like the hue of far-distant mountain ranges—and of an odd, narrow shape; were even, to be precise, a little slanting, with strongly marked, prominent cheek-bones directly under them. It was a type of face which in this instance, far from seeming an abnormality, was distinctly pleasing, though odd enough to have won for him the nickname of “the Kirghiz” among his schoolmates. Hippe already wore long trousers, and a blue jacket belted in at the back and closed to the throat, the collar of which was usually whitened by a few scales of dandruff.","The boy that Hans Castorp was talking to was named Hippe, Pribislav Hippe—and the remarkable thing was that the r in his first name was pronounced like an sh: he called himself “Pshibislav.” And that outlandish name did not fit badly with his looks, which were not ordinary at all, indeed were decidedly foreign. Hippe, the son of a high-school history teacher—and so a notorious model student—was already a grade ahead of Hans Castorp, although he was not much older. He came from Mecklenburg, and to judge from appearances, he was obviously the product of an ancient mixing of races, the blending of Germanic blood with Slavic-Wendish, or vice versa. He was blond, and his hair was kept trimmed close to his round head. But his eyes, bluish-gray or grayish-blue eyes (a rather indefinite and equivocal color, much like that of distant mountains) had a curious, narrow, and, if you looked closely, slightly slanted shape, and right below them were prominent, strong, distinctive cheekbones—features not at all ill proportioned in his case, but really quite pleasing, although they sufficed for his schoolmates to award him the nickname of “the Kirghiz.” Hippe, by the way, already wore long trousers, plus a blue jacket, gathered at the back and buttoning up to the collar, where a few flakes of dandruff usually lay scattered."
"»Er ist etwas empfindlich«, gab Joachim zu. »Du hättest die ärztliche Behandlung nicht so brüsk zurückweisen sollen, wenigstens nicht die psychische. Er sieht es nicht gern, wenn man sich dem entzieht. Auf mich ist er auch nicht besonders zu sprechen, weil ich ihm nicht genug anvertraue. Aber dann und wann erzähl ich ihm doch einen Traum, damit er was zu zergliedern hat.«","""He's a bit touchy,"" admitted Joachim. 'You shouldn't have been so brusque about refusing medical treatment, at least not the psychological one. He doesn't like it when you evade it. He's also not particularly open to me because I don't confide in him enough. But every once in a while I tell him a dream so he has something to dissect.""","“He is rather touchy,” admitted Joachim. “You ought not to have refused the treatment so brusquely, at least not the psychical. He doesn’t like to have people get out of it. He doesn’t take much stock in me because I don’t confide in him enough. But every now and then I tell him a dream I’ve had, so he can have something to analyse.”","“He’s a little sensitive,” Joachim admitted. “You shouldn’t have been so brusque about rejecting medical treatment, at least not the psychological part. He doesn’t like for people to try to avoid it. He’s not all that well disposed toward me, either, because I don’t confide enough in him. But now and then I do tell him a dream, so that he’ll have something to dissect.”"
"»Schweigen Sie doch!« zischte Settembrini sie von der Seite an. Er war nebst Naphta gleichzeitig mit ihr im Zimmer und herzlich bewegt. Mit beiden Händen wies er die Anwesenden auf Joachim hin, indem er sie zur Klage aufforderte. »Un giovanotto tanto simpàtico, tanto stimàbile!« rief er wiederholt.","""Shut up!"" Settembrini hissed at her from the side. He was in the room with her at the same time as Naphta and was heartily moved. With both hands he pointed to Joachim and asked those present to lament. ""Un giovanotto tanto simpàtico, tanto stimàbile!"" he cried repeatedly.","“Be quiet,” hissed Settembrini, at her side. He and Naphta were with her in the room. Greatly moved, with both hands he waved the onlookers toward the bed and summoned them to mourn with him. “Un giovanotto tanto simpatico, tanto stimabile,” said he repeatedly.","“Silence!” Settembrini hissed in her direction. Both he and Naphta were in the room with her, and he was sincerely moved. He gestured with both hands for those present to look at Joachim, insisting they mourn with him. “Un giovanotto tanto simpatico, tanto stimabile!” he exclaimed over and over."
"Es war das Dienerchen, das Tee brachte, dazu einen hübschen, silberbeschlagenen Korb, worin in Stücke geschnittener Baumkuchen lag. Hinter ihm aber, durch die offene Tür, wer trat beschwingten Schrittes mit »Sapperlot!« »Accidenti!« und feinem Lächeln herein? Das war Herr Settembrini, wohnhaft eine Treppe höher, der sich einfand, in der Absicht, den Herren Gesellschaft zu leisten. Durch sein Fensterchen, sagte er, habe er die Vettern kommen sehen und rasch noch eine enzyklopädische Seite heruntergeschrieben, die er eben unter der Feder gehabt, um sich dann ebenfalls hier zu Gaste zu bitten. Nichts war natürlicher, als daß er kam. Seine alte Bekanntschaft mit den Berghofbewohnern berechtigte ihn dazu, und dann war auch sein Verkehr und Austausch mit Naphta, trotz tiefgehender Meinungsverschiedenheiten, ja offenbar überhaupt sehr lebhaft, – wie denn der Gastgeber ihn leichthin und ohne Überraschung als Zugehörigen begrüßte. Das hinderte nicht, daß Hans Castorp von seinem Kommen sehr deutlich einen doppelten Eindruck gewann. Erstens, so empfand er, stellte Herr Settembrini sich ein, um ihn und Joachim, oder eigentlich kurzweg ihn, nicht mit dem häßlichen kleinen Naphta allein zu lassen, sondern durch seine Anwesenheit ein pädagogisches Gegengewicht zu schaffen; und zweitens war klar ersichtlich, daß er gar nichts dagegen hatte, sondern die Gelegenheit recht gern benutzte, den Aufenthalt in seinem Dach auf eine Weile mit dem in Naphtas seidenfeinem Zimmer zu vertauschen und einen wohlservierten Tee einzunehmen: er rieb sich die gelblichen, an der Kleinfingerseite des Rückens mit schwarzen {596}Haaren bewachsenen Hände, bevor er zugriff, und speiste mit unverkennbarem, auch lobend ausgesprochenem Genuß von dem Baumkuchen, dessen schmale, gebogene Scheiben von Schokoladeadern durchzogen waren.","It was the little servant who brought tea and a pretty silver-bound basket, in which lay tree cake cut into pieces. But behind him, through the open door, who came in with buoyant steps, ""Sapperlot!"" ""Accidenti!"" and a delicate smile? It was Mr. Settembrini, who lives upstairs, who came with the intention of keeping the gentlemen company. Through his little window, he said, he saw his cousins coming and quickly wrote down another encyclopaedic page that he had just penned, in order to ask them to be guests here as well. Nothing was more natural than that he should come. His old acquaintance with the residents of the Berghof entitle him to do so, and then his dealings and exchanges with Naphta, despite profound differences of opinion, were apparently very lively in general - as the host then greeted him lightly and without surprise as a member. This did not prevent Hans Castorp from gaining a double impression of his coming. First, he felt, Mr. Settembrini came not to leave him and Joachim, or actually him, alone with the ugly little Naphta, but to create a pedagogical counterweight by his presence; and secondly, it was plain to see that he had nothing against it, but rather gladly took the opportunity to swap his stay in his roof for a while in Naphta's silky room and take a well-served tea: he rubbed his yellowish, on the hands covered with black hair on the little finger side of his back before he reached for it, and ate the Baumkuchen with unmistakable enjoyment, which was also expressed in praise, the narrow, curved slices of which were veined with chocolate.","The little servant was fetching the tea, also a charming silver-bound basket containing slices of layer cake. And behind him, on the threshold, who should stand, on winged feet, wreathed in his subtle smile, and exclaiming: “Sapperlot!” and “Accidente”—who, indeed, but the lodger from upstairs, Herr Settembrini, dropped in to keep them company? From his little window, he said, he had seen the cousins enter, and made haste to finish the page of the encyclopædia which he had at the moment in hand, in order to beg an invitation. Nothing more natural than his coming: it was justified by his old acquaintance with the Berghof guests, no less than by his relations with Naphta, which, despite deep-seated divergences of opinion, were lively on both sides, the host accepting his presence as a thing of course. All this did not prevent Hans Castorp from getting two impressions from his advent, one as clearly as the other: first, that Herr Settembrini had come to prevent them—or rather him—from being alone with little Naphta, and to establish, as it were, a pedagogic equilibrium; second, that Herr Settembrini did not object the least in the world, but rather the contrary, to exchanging his room in the loft for a sojourn in Naphta’s fine and silken chamber, nor to taking a good and proper tea. He rubbed together his small yellow hands, with their line of hair running down the back from the little finger, before he fell to, with unmistakable and outspoken relish upon the layer cake, which had a chocolate filling.","The little page had brought tea, plus a pretty silver-trimmed basket containing slices of layer cake. And who should come through the open door behind him—gliding swiftly, smiling delicately, exclaiming, “Zounds!” and “Accidenti!” It was Herr Settembrini, who lived one floor up and just happened to drop by to keep these gentlemen company. He had seen the cousins coming, he said, from his little window and had quickly finished off the encyclopedic page he had been working on, so that he, too, could join the party. His arrival seemed the most natural thing in the world—justified both by his old acquaintance with the Berghof residents and his relationship with Naphta, which despite profound differences of opinion was evidently characterized by regular and very lively visiting back and forth. And, indeed, the host showed no surprise as he casually greeted him as one of their number. All this, however, did not prevent Hans Castorp from gaining two distinct impressions from his arrival. First, he had the feeling that Herr Settembrini had dropped by in order to keep him and Joachim—or, actually, just him—from being left alone with ugly little Naphta and to provide a pedagogic counterweight by his presence; second, it was quite evident that he had no objection to using the occasion to leave his lodgings in the attic for a while, exchanging them for Naphta’s silk-adorned room and a properly served tea. He first rubbed his yellow hands—and a line of black hair grew down the side of each, to just below the little finger—and then helped himself. With obvious relish, indeed with open praise, he dined on layer cake, each narrow, curving slice of which was richly veined with chocolate."
"»Bier, Tabak und Musik«, sagte er. »Da haben wir Ihr Vaterland! Ich sehe, Sie haben Sinn für nationale Stimmung, Ingenieur. Sie sind in Ihrem Elemente, das freut mich.

"»Das heißt, welche Nachricht? Von der Verzögerung meiner Abreise? Ach, die Meinen, wissen Sie, die Meinen zu Hause bestehen aus drei Onkels, einem Großonkel und zwei Söhnen von ihm, zu denen ich mehr in Vetternverhältnis stehe.

Zu Anfang, als ich mich legen mußte, habe ich ihnen geschrieben, ich sei stark erkältet und könne nicht reisen. Und gestern, da es nun doch ein bißchen lange dauerte, habe ich noch einmal geschrieben und gesagt, Hofrat Behrens sei durch den Katarrh auf den Zustand meiner Brust aufmerksam geworden und dringe darauf, daß ich meinen Aufenthalt verlängere, bis Klarheit darüber geschaffen ist. Davon werden sie sehr ruhigen Blutes Kenntnis genommen haben.«","'I mean, what message? The delay in my departure? Oh, mine, you know, my family at home consists of three uncles, a great-uncle and two sons of his, to whom I am more of a cousin. I don't have any other family, I became a double orphan very early on. Recorded? You don't know much yet, not any more than I do. At the beginning, when I had to lie down, I wrote to them that I had a bad cold and couldn't travel. And yesterday, since it was taking a little longer, I wrote again and said that the catarrh made Hofrat Behrens aware of the condition of my breast and that I was urging that I extend my stay until things were clear. They will have taken note of this with very calm blood.”","“What news do you mean? Of my delayed return? Oh, my family, you know, consists of three uncles, a great-uncle and his two sons, who are more like my cousins. Other family I have none, I was doubly orphaned when I was very small. As to how they took it—they know as much, and as little, as I myself. At first, when I had to go to bed, I wrote that I had a severe cold, and could not travel. Yesterday, as it seemed rather long after all, I wrote again, saying that my catarrh had drawn Hofrat Behren’s attention to the condition or my chest, and that he insisted I should remain until he is clear what the condition is. You may be perfectly sure they took it calmly— it didn’t upset them.”","“Which news do you mean? About the delay in my departure? Ah yes, my family.

"Unvornehm gesonnen – die Kirche? Herr Settembrini wurde auf den unerbittlichen Aristokratismus aufmerksam gemacht, welcher der Idee von der Erblichkeit der Schande zugrunde gelegen habe: der Übertragung schwerer Schuld auf die – demokratisch gesprochen – doch unschuldigen Nachkommen; die lebenslange Makelhaftigkeit und Rechtlosigkeit natür{891}licher Kinder zum Beispiel. Aber er bat, davon stille zu sein, – erstens, weil sein humanes Gefühl sich dagegen empöre, und zweitens, weil er die Winkelzüge satt habe und in den Kunstgriffen der gegnerischen Apologetik den durchaus infamen und teuflischen Kultus des Nichts wiedererkenne, der Geist genannt sein wolle, und der die eingestandene Unpopularität des asketischen Prinzips als etwas so Legitimes, so Heiliges empfinden lasse.","Immodestly minded – the church? Mr. Settembrini's attention was drawn to the implacable aristocratism underlying the idea of hereditary disgrace: the passing of grave guilt to—democratically speaking—innocent offspring; the lifelong imperfection and lack of rights of natural children, for example. But he asked to be quiet about it - first because his humane feelings revolted against it, and secondly because he was fed up with the tricks and recognized in the tricks of opposing apologetics the thoroughly infamous and devilish cult of nothingness, the spirit being called wanted, and who let the admitted unpopularity of the ascetic principle be perceived as something so legitimate, so sacred.","So the Church lacked refinement? Herr Settembrini’s attention was invited to the inexorable aristocratism which underlay the idea that shame could be inherited: the passing on of guilt to the—democratically considered—innocent descendants; for example, the illegitimacy and lifelong pollution of natural children. But the Italian bade him be silent: in the first place, because his human feelings rose up in arms against Naphta’s words, and in the second, because he had had enough of such quibbles, and saw in the shifts of his opponent’s apologetics only the same old infamous and devilish cult of nihilism, which wanted to be called Spirit, and found so legitimate, so sacrosanct the admittedly existent hatred of the ascetic principle.","A lack of noble intent—the Church? Herr Settembrini’s attention was called to the implacable principle of aristocracy that lay behind the idea that shame can be inherited: the transference of major guilt to—democratically speaking—innocent offspring; the lifelong blemish attached to natural children, for example, including their lack of legal standing. Naphta was told to be silent on that account—first, because it was an outrage to humane feelings, and second, because he, Settembrini, had heard enough evasions and could see through the tricks of his opponent’s apologetics to the thoroughly infamous and devilish cult of nihilism, which desired to be called Spirit and managed to perceive something legitimizing and sanctifying in the acknowledged unpopularity of the ascetic principle."
"»Es ist die Übung«, antwortete Joachim, indem er beim Sprechen das Thermometer mit den Zähnen festhielt. »Du lernst es auch. Morgen müssen wir uns unbedingt ein paar Decken für dich besorgen. Du kannst sie unten schon wieder brauchen, und hier bei uns sind sie unerläßlich, besonders da du ja keinen Pelzsack hast.«","""It's practice,"" replied Joachim, holding the thermometer between his teeth as he spoke. “You're learning too. Tomorrow we have to get some blankets for you. You can use them again downstairs, and here with us they are essential, especially since you don't have a fur sack.""","“That’s the practice I’ve had,” Joachim answered, holding the thermometer between his teeth in order to speak. “You’ll learn. To-morrow we must certainly get you a pair of rugs. You can use them afterwards at home, and up here they are indispensable, particularly as you have no sleeping-sack.”","“It’s a matter of practice,” Joachim responded, holding the thermometer firmly between his teeth as he spoke. “You’ll learn how, too. We’ll definitely have to find a couple of blankets for you tomorrow. You’ll be able to use them down below again, too. And they’re an absolute necessity up here, especially since you don’t have a fur-lined sleeping bag.”"

"»So?« sagte Hans Castorp. »Ja, es kann ja wohl sein, daß mir was ähnliches auch schon durch den Kopf ging.«","said Hans Castorp. ""Yes, it's possible that something similar has been going through my head.""","“Was I?” said Hans Castorp. “Yes, it may be something of the kind went through my head.”","Hans Castorp said. “Yes, it may well be that something similar ran through my mind.”"
"Ja, Dr. Krokowski beschrieb auf seinem selbständigen Nachmittagsrundgang keinen Bogen mehr um Hans Castorp. Dieser zählte nun mit, er war nicht länger ein Intervall und Hiatus, er war Patient, er wurde gefragt und nicht links liegengelassen, wie es zu seinem geheimen und leichten, aber täglich wieder empfundenen Ärger so lange geschehen war. Es war am Montag gewesen, daß Dr. Krokowski zum erstenmal im Zimmer erschienen war, – wir sagen »erschienen«, denn das ist das rechte Wort für den sonderbaren und sogar etwas entsetzlichen Eindruck, dessen Hans Castorp sich damals nicht hatte erwehren können. Er hatte im Halb- oder Viertelschlummer gelegen, als er aufschreckend gewahrte, daß der Assistent im Zimmer war, ohne durch die Tür hereingelangt zu sein, und von der Außenseite her auf ihn zuschritt. Denn sein Weg war nicht über den Korridor, sondern durch die äußeren Loggien gewesen, und durch die offene Balkontür war er eingetreten, so daß sich die Vorstellung aufdrängte, als sei er durch die Lüfte gekommen. Da hatte er nun jedenfalls an Hans Castorps Lager gestanden, schwarzbleich, breitschultrig und stämmig, der Apostroph der Stunde, und in seinem geteilten Bart waren gelblich und mannhaft lächelnd die Zähne zu sehen gewesen.","yes dr On his independent afternoon tour, Krokowski no longer described any arc around Hans Castorp. He was now counting, he was no longer an interval and hiatus, he was a patient, he was asked and not ignored, as had happened for so long to his secret and slight, but daily annoyance. It was on Monday that Dr. Krokowski had appeared in the room for the first time - we say ""appeared"" because that is the right word for the strange and even somewhat dreadful impression which Hans Castorp could not help but feel at the time. He had been half or a quarter asleep when he realized with a start that the assistant was in the room without having got through the door and was approaching him from the outside. Because his way hadn't been along the corridor, but through the outer loggias, and he had entered through the open balcony door, so that the impression arose as if he had come through the air. In any case, there he was standing at Hans Castorp's bedside, pale black, broad-shouldered and stocky, the apostrophe of the hour, and his yellowish teeth, smiling like a man, could be seen in his parted beard.","Dr. Krokowski played the part of apostrophe. Yes, nowadays when Dr. Krokowski went his independent afternoon round, he no longer made a circle round Hans Castorp; our young man was no longer an interval and hiatus, he counted as much as the others, he too was a patient. He was questioned, not ignored, as had so long been the case, to his slight and concealed but daily recurring annoyance. It was on Monday that Dr. Krokowski for the first time manifested himself in the room—manifested being the only proper word for the phenomenon as Hans Castorp, with an involuntary start, perceived it. He lay in half— or quarter—slumber, and became aware that the Assistant was beside him, having entered not through the door, but approaching from outside. His round at this time lay not through the corridor, but along the balconies, and he had come through the open door of the loggia with an effect of having flown through the air. There he stood at Hans Castorp’s bedside, in all his pallor and blackness, broad-shouldered and squat, his lips parted in a manly smile that showed the yellowish teeth through his beard— the apostrophe!","And the apostrophe was Dr. Krokowski. Yes, Dr. Krokowski no longer circumvented Hans Castorp when he made his independent afternoon rounds. Hans Castorp counted now. He was no longer an interval or hiatus, he was a patient; he, too, was questioned, instead of being left lying there to his own devices, as he had been every day until now—much to his slight and secret annoyance. It was on Monday that Dr. Krokowski had first materialized in his room—we say “materialized,” because that is the best word for the strange, almost terrifying impression it had made on Hans Castorp, no matter how hard he tried to shake it that day. He had been lying there dozing for fifteen minutes or half an hour, when he was startled awake by the sudden realization that the assistant was in his room, striding toward him, having entered not by way of the door, but from outside. He had not used the corridor, but had moved along the balconies, and had come in now through the open balcony door, creating the impression that he had materialized out of thin air. At any rate, there he had stood beside Hans Castorp’s bed—black and pale, broad-shouldered, stout, the hour’s apostrophe—and visible under his two-pronged beard had been a manly smile and yellowish teeth."
"»Hoppla, Achtung die Herren!« sagte Behrens. »Das hätte {73}leicht schlecht ablaufen können für die beiderseitigen Hühneraugen.« Er sprach stark niedersächsisch, breit und kauend. »So das sind Sie«, sagte er zu Hans Castorp, den Joachim mit zusammengezogenen Absätzen präsentierte; »na, freut mich.« Und er gab dem jungen Mann seine Hand, die groß war wie eine Schaufel. Er war ein knochiger Mann, wohl drei Köpfe höher als Dr. Krokowski, schon ganz weiß auf dem Kopf, mit heraustretendem Genick, großen, vorquellenden und blutunterlaufenen blauen Augen, in denen Tränen schwammen, einer aufgeworfenen Nase und kurzgeschnittenem Schnurrbärtchen, das schief gezogen war, und zwar infolge einer einseitigen Schürzung der Oberlippe. Was Joachim von seinen Backen gesagt hatte, bewahrheitete sich vollkommen, sie waren blau; und so wirkte sein Kopf denn recht farbig gegen den weißen Chirurgenrock, den er trug, einen über die Knie reichenden Gurtkittel, der unten seine gestreiften Hosen und ein paar kolossale Füße in gelben und etwas abgenutzten Schnürstiefeln sehen ließ. Auch Dr. Krokowski war im Berufskleide, allein sein Kittel war schwarz, aus einem schwarzen Lüsterstoff, hemdartig, mit Gummizügen an den Handgelenken, und hob seine Blässe nicht wenig. Er verhielt sich rein assistierend und beteiligte sich auf keine Weise an der Begrüßung, doch ließ eine kritische Spannung seines Mundes erkennen, daß er sein untergeordnetes Verhältnis als wunderlich empfinde.","""Oops, gentlemen,"" said Behrens. ""That could have easily gone badly for the corns on both sides."" He spoke in a strong Lower Saxon style, broadly and chewing. ""So there you are,"" he said to Hans Castorp, whom Joachim presented with his heels pulled together; ""Well, I'm glad."" And he gave the young man his hand, which was the size of a shovel. He was a bony man, probably three heads taller than Dr. Krokowski, already quite white on the head, with a bulging neck, large, bulging and bloodshot blue eyes with tears swimming in them, a wrinkled nose and a close-cropped mustache that was pulled askew from a unilateral pursed upper lip. What Joachim had said about his cheeks was absolutely true, they were blue; and so his head looked quite colored against the white surgeon's coat he wore, a belted smock that reached above his knees, revealing his striped trousers and a pair of colossal feet in yellow and somewhat worn lace-up boots. also dr Krokowski was in his professional clothes, but his smock was black, made of a black luster material, like a shirt, with elastic bands at the wrists, and he was quite pale. He behaved purely as an assistant and took no part in the greeting, but a critical tightness in his mouth indicated that he found his subordinate relationship odd.","“Hullo-ullo there! Take care, gentlemen! That might have been rough on all of our corns!” He spoke with a strong low-Saxon accent, broad and mouthingly. “Oh, so here you are,” he addressed Hans Castorp, whom Joachim, heels together, presented. “Well, glad to see you.” He reached the young man a hand the size of a shovel. He was some three heads taller than Dr. Krokowski; a bony man, his hair already quite white; his neck stuck out, his large, goggling bloodshot blue eyes were swimming in tears; he had a snub nose, and a close-trimmed little moustache, which made a crooked line because his upper lip was drawn up on one side. What Joachim had said about his cheeks was fully borne out; they were really purple, and set off his head garishly against the white surgeon ’s coat he wore, a belted smock of more than kneelength, beneath which showed striped trousers and a pair of enormous feet in rather worn yellow laced boots. Dr. Krokowski too was in professional garb; but his smock was of some shiny black stuff and made like a shirt, with elastic bands at the wrists. It contrasted sharply with the pallor of his skin. His manner suggested that he was present solely in his capacity as assistant; he took no part in the greeting, but a certain expression at the corners of his mouth betrayed the fact that he felt the strain of his subordinate position.","“Whoops, heads up, gentlemen!” Behrens said. “That could have meant some badly trodden corns for all parties.” He spoke with a strong Lower Saxon accent, chewing his words broadly. “So, you’re the fellow,” he said to Hans Castorp, after Joachim clicked his heels together and made the introductions. “Well, my pleasure.” And he extended a hand as big as a shovel. He was a bony man, a good three heads taller than Dr. Krokowski, with a shock of white hair; his neck vertebrae stuck out, and his watery, bloodshot blue eyes protruded; he had a snub nose above a little short-cropped moustache, which sat slightly askew because his upper lip was turned up at one corner. What Joachim had said about his cheeks proved to be the absolute truth—they were purple, making his head look that much more colorful against his belted, white surgical smock, which fell just below the knees, revealing striped trousers and colossal feet in a pair of yellow, rather worn, laced boots. Dr. Krokowski was in professional uniform as well, except that his smock was more shirtlike, with elastic at the wrists, and of a black, shiny fabric that only emphasized his pallor. He played the role of the perfect assistant, taking no part whatever in the exchanged greetings—although the tense, critical way he held his mouth suggested that he found his subordinate position a little absurd."
"»Ich stellte mich an die Wand,« sagte Joachim, »in anständiger Haltung, und verbeugte mich etwas, als sie bei mir waren, – es war gerade vor dem Zimmer der kleinen Hujus, Nummer achtundzwanzig. Ich glaube, der Geistliche freute sich, daß ich grüßte; er dankte sehr höflich und nahm seine Kappe ab. Aber zugleich machen sie auch schon halt, und der Ministrantenjunge mit dem Räucherfaß klopft an, und dann klinkt er auf und läßt seinem Chef den Vortritt ins Zimmer. Und nun stelle dir vor und male dir meinen Schrecken aus und meine Empfindungen! In dem Augenblick, wo der Priester den Fuß über die Schwelle setzt, geht da drinnen ein Zetermordio an, ein Gekreisch, du hast nie so etwas gehört, drei, viermal hintereinander, und danach ein Schreien ohne Pause und Absatz, aus weit offenem Munde offenbar, ahhh, es lag ein Jammer darin und ein Entsetzen und Widerspruch, daß es nicht zu beschreiben ist, und so ein greuliches Betteln war es auch zwischendurch, und auf einen Schlag wird es hohl und dumpf, als ob es in die Erde versunken wäre und tief aus dem Keller käme.«","""I stood against the wall,"" said Joachim, ""in a decent posture, and bowed a little when they came to me - it was just in front of little Hujus' room, number twenty-eight. I think the minister was pleased that I greeted him; he thanked me very politely and took off his cap. But at the same time they stop, and the altar boy with the censer knocks, and then he unlatches and lets his boss go first into the room. And now imagine and picture my terror and my feelings! The moment the priest puts his foot over the threshold, there's a bang, a screeching, you've never heard anything like it, three or four times in a row, and then a scream without a break, without a break, apparently from a wide open mouth , ahhh, there was a pity in it and a horror and contradiction that it cannot be described, and it was such a horrible begging in between, and all at once it becomes hollow and dull, as if it had sunk into the earth and came from deep in the basement.""","“I stood against the wall,” Joachim went on, “as respectfully as I could, and bent over a little when they were by me—it was just at little Hujus’s door, number twentyeight. The priest seemed to be pleased that I saluted; he acknowledged very courteously and took off his cap. But at the same time they came to a stop, and the ministrant with the censer knocks, and lifts the latch, and makes way for his superior to enter. Just try to imagine my sensations, and how frightened I was! The minute the priest sets his foot over the threshold, there begins a hullabaloo from inside, a screaming such as you never heard the like of, three or four times running, and then a shriek—on and on without stopping, at the top of her lungs : Ah-h-h-h! So full of horror and rebellion, and anguish, and —well, perfectly indescribable. And in between came a gruesome sort of begging. Then it suddenly got all dulled and hollowsounding, as though it had sunk down into the earth, or were coming out of a cellar.”","“I stood back against the wall,” Joachim said, “taking up a respectful pose, and made a little bow as they came even with me—it was right in front of the little Hujus girl’s room, number twenty-eight. The priest was glad to see my response, I think, and returned my greeting very politely, doffing his cap. But by this time they have all come to a halt, and the altar boy with the censer knocks on the door, then lifts the latch, and lets his supervisor step ahead into the room. But now, just picture it, just imagine the terror I felt. The moment the priest sets a foot over the threshold, a hue and cry starts up inside, first a shriek like nothing you’ve ever heard, three or four times in a row, and then just screaming without a pause or break, like a mouth gaping wide open, I suppose, ‘Ahhh—’ and with such misery and terror and defiance in it that I can’t describe it, and such ghastly pleading mixed in, too, and then all of a sudden it turns hollow and muffled, as if it has sunk down into the earth or is coming from a deep cellar.”"
"{587}Die Verabfolgung der Injektionen, so meldete Hans Castorp nach Hause, hatte der Hofrat neuestens unterbrochen. Sie bekamen diesem jungen Patienten nicht, verursachten ihm Kopfschmerzen, Appetitlosigkeit, Gewichtsabnahme und Müdigkeit, hatten die »Temperatur« zunächst erhöht und dann nicht beseitigt. Sie glühte als trockene Hitze subjektiv fort in seiner rosenroten Miene, als Mahnung daran, daß die Akklimatisation für diesen Sprößling der Tiefebene und ihrer feuchtfröhlichen Meteorologie doch eben wohl hauptsächlich in der Gewöhnung daran bestand, daß er sich nicht gewöhnte, – was übrigens Radamanthys ja selber nicht tat, der immer blaue Backen hatte. »Manche gewöhnen sich nie«, hatte Joachim gleich gesagt, und dies schien Hans Castorps Fall. Denn auch das Genickzittern, das ihn hier oben bald nach der Ankunft zu belästigen begonnen, hatte sich nicht wieder verlieren wollen, sondern stellte sich im Gehen, im Gespräch, ja selbst hier oben am blau blühenden Orte seines Nachdenkens über den Komplex seiner Abenteuer unvermeidlich ein, so daß ihm die würdige Kinnstütze Hans Lorenz Castorps beinahe schon zur festen Gewohnheit geworden war, – nicht ohne ihn selbst, wenn er sie benützte, an die Vatermörder des Alten, die Interimsform der Ehrenkrause, an das blaßgoldene Rund der Taufschale, an den frommen Ur-Ur-Laut und ähnliche Verwandtschaften unter der Hand zu erinnern und ihn so zum Überdenken seines Lebenskomplexes neuerdings hinzuleiten.","{587}The administration of the injections, as Hans Castorp reported home, had recently been interrupted by the Hofrat. They didn't suit this young patient, causing him headaches, loss of appetite, weight loss and fatigue, first raising the ""temperature"" and then not eliminating it. It continued to glow subjectively as dry heat in his rose-red face, as a reminder that the acclimatization for this offspring of the lowlands and its boisterous meteorology consisted mainly in getting used to the fact that he did not get used to it - which, by the way, Radamanthys himself did did not, who always had blue cheeks. ""Some people never get used to it,"" Joachim said right away, and this seemed to be Hans Castorp's case. Because even the trembling of the neck, which began to bother him up here soon after his arrival, had not wanted to go away again, but inevitably came up while walking, in conversation, yes even up here in the blue blooming place of his reflections on the complex of his adventures , so that the dignified chin rest of Hans Lorenz Castorp had almost become a permanent habit – not without him himself, when he used it, of the old man’s patricides, the interim form of the ruff of honor, of the pale golden round of the baptismal font, of the pious to remember primal-primal-sound and similar relationships underhand and thus lead him to reconsider his complex of life.","The Hofrat, so Hans Castorp told his people, had latterly given up the injections: they did not suit the young patient. They gave him headache and fatigue, caused loss of appetite, reduced his weight, and, while making his temperature go up at first, had not succeeded in reducing it in the long run. His face glowed rosy-red with dry, internal heat, a sign that for this child of the lowland, bred in an atmosphere that rejoiced in a high degree of humidity, acclimatization could only consist in “getting used to not getting used to it”—which, in fact, Rhadamanthus himself never did, being perpetually purple-cheeked. “Some people can’t get used to it,” Joachim had said; and this seemed to be Hans Castorp’s case. For even that trembling of the neck, which had come upon him soon after his arrival here, had never quite passed off, but would attack him as he walked or talked—yes, even up here in his blue-blossoming retreat, while he sat pondering the whole complex of his adventures; so that the dignified chin-support of Hans Lorenz Castorp had become almost fixed habit with him. He himself would all at once be conscious of using it and have a swift memory of the old man’s choker collar, the provisional form of the ruff; the pale gold round of the christening basin; the ineffably solemn sound of the “great-great-great.” These and suchlike associations would gradually in their turn lead him back to reflect upon the whole mass of his adventures in life.","The director, Hans Castorp reported home, had recently discontinued his series of injections. For such a young patient, he was not reacting well; they had resulted in headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight, had at first raised his “fever” slightly, but then had not got rid of it. It continued to glow as a dry, subjective flush in his pink face, a reminder that for this child of the lowlands with their intoxicatingly damp meteorology, acclimatization consisted primarily of getting used to not getting used to things—which, by the way, Rhadamanthus himself, with his purple cheeks, had never done. “Some people never get used to it,” Joachim had responded right off, and this did appear to be the case with Hans Castorp. Even the tremor of his head, which had begun to bother him soon after his arrival up here, gave every indication of not wanting to clear up, but would invariably start again when he was walking or talking, or even sitting there in the blue-blossoming meadow, thinking back over the complexity of his adventures; in fact, Hans Lorenz Castorp’s dignified chin-propping method had almost become a habit for his grandson as well—and he never used it without being reminded of the old man’s stiff collar, that interim form of his ceremonial ruff, of the soft golden hollow of the baptismal bowl, the religious sound of “great-great-great,” and similar secret, private associations, all leading to yet another round of reflection on the complexity of his life."
"Am wieder nächsten Tage jedoch trat eine Erscheinung auf, die Hans Castorp bestimmte, sich innerlich von der Form zu trennen und zu lösen und tatsächlich dem Professionisten, dem üblen Hüter der Pietät, das Feld zu überlassen. Joachim nämlich, dessen Ausdruck bisher so ernst und ehrbar gewesen, hatte in seinem Kriegerbarte zu lächeln begonnen, und Hans Castorp verhehlte sich nicht, daß dieses Lächeln die Neigung zur Ausartung in sich trug – es erfüllte sein Herz mit Empfindungen der Eile. So war es in Gottes Namen denn gut, daß die Abholung bevorstand, der Sarg geschlossen und verschraubt werden sollte. Hans Castorp berührte, eingeborene Sittensprödigkeit beiseite setzend, seines ehemaligen Joachim steinkalte Stirn zum Abschied zart mit den Lippen und ging trotz allem Mißtrauen gegen den Mann der Kehrseite mit Luise Ziemßen folgsam zum Zimmer hinaus.","The very next day, however, an apparition appeared that determined Hans Castorp to separate himself inwardly from the form and actually leave the field to the professional, the evil guardian of piety. Joachim, whose expression had hitherto been so serious and honorable, had begun to smile in his warrior's beard, and Hans Castorp made no secret of the fact that this smile contained a tendency to degeneracy - it filled his heart with feelings of haste. So it was good in God's name that the collection was imminent, the coffin was to be closed and bolted. Hans Castorp, setting aside native moral primness, gently touched his former Joachim's stone-cold forehead with his lips in farewell and, in spite of all mistrust of the man on the other side, obediently went out of the room with Luise Ziemssen.","On the next day but one appeared a phenomenon which determined Hans Castorp to take inward leave of that quiet form, to void the field and leave it to the professional guardian of the amenities: Joachim, whose expression had been so noble and serious, began now to smile in his warrior beard. Hans Castorp did not conceal from himself that this smile had in it the seeds of corruption; he knew in his heart that time was pressing. It was good that the coffin was now to be closed, the lid screwed on; that the hour for removal was at hand. Hans Castorp, laying aside traditional reserve, lightly touched with his lips the icy forehead of that which once was Joachim; and though conscious still of mistrustful sentiments toward the man behind the scenes, yet submissively followed Louisa Ziemssen from the room.","Two days later, however, something occurred to convince Hans Castorp to detach himself emotionally from this shell and leave things to the professional, that offensive guardian of piety. Joachim, whose expression so far had been earnest and honorable, began to smile under his beard. Hans Castorp could not help admitting that this smile bore within it the seeds of degeneration—and it filled his heart with a sense of haste. Thank God, the body would soon be picked up, the coffin closed and screwed shut. Setting aside his native reserve, Hans Castorp touched his lips in a gesture of tender farewell to the stone-cold brow of what had once been Joachim, and despite his misgivings, turned his back on the undertaker and meekly followed Luise Ziemssen out of the room."
"»Die Weltlage verwirrt mich«, seufzte der Freimaurer. »Der Balkanbund wird zustandekommen, Ingenieur, alle meine Informationen sprechen dafür. Rußland arbeitet fieberhaft daran, und die Spitze der Kombination ist gegen die österreichisch-ungarische Monarchie gerichtet, ohne deren Zertrümmerung kein Punkt des russischen Programms zu verwirklichen ist. Begreifen Sie meine Skrupel? Ich hasse Wien mit ganzer Kraft, Sie wissen es. Aber soll ich darum die Unterstützung meiner Seele der sarmatischen Despotie zuteil werden lassen, die im Begriffe ist, die Brandfackel an unseren hochadeligen Erdteil zu legen? Andererseits würde ein auch nur gelegentliches diplomatisches Zusammenwirken meines Landes mit Österreich mich wie Entehrung treffen. Das sind Gewissensfragen, welche –«","""The state of the world confuses me,"" the Freemason sighed. 'The Balkan League will come about, Engineer, all my information points to it.

Russia is working feverishly for it. And the combination is aimed against the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, which must fall before any of the Russian programme can be realized. You understand my scruples. Austria, as of course you are aware, I hate with all my strength. But shall I, on that account, lend support and countenance in my soul to the Sarmatian despotism, which is about to set the torch to the whole of our highly civilized continent?

These are conscientious scruples which—”","“The world situation baffles me,” the Freemason said. “The Balkan League will be formed, my good engineer, all my sources tell me so.

Do you understand my scruples? I hate Vienna with all that is in me, as you know. But should I grant the support of my soul to Sarmatian despotism, when it is about to put the torch to our most noble continent?

"Settembrini sah ihn an. Er schien nicht zugehört zu haben. Wieder hatten seine Augen »sich festgesehen«, waren in eine fixe und blinde Einstellung geraten, und wie heute morgen sagte er je dreimal »so, so, so« und »sieh, sieh, sieh«, – spöttisch-nachdenklich und mit scharfem S-Laut.","Settembrini looked at him. He didn't seem to have been listening. Again his eyes had ""fixed themselves"", had gotten into a fixed and blind attitude, and like this morning he said ""so, so, so"" and ""see, see, see"" three times each - mockingly thoughtfully and with a sharp S -According to.","Settembrini looked at him. He seemed not to have been listening. His eyes were set again, they had taken on a fixed stare, and he said: “Yes, yes, yes,” and “I see, I see, I see,” each three times, just as he had done in the morning, in a considering, deriding tone, and giving a sharp sound to the s’s.","Settembrini stared at him. He hadn’t seemed to listen; his eyes had “set” again, taking on that same fixed, vacant look. Just as he had earlier that morning, he repeated a threefold “yes, yes, yes” and “I see, I see, I see” with hissing, deliberately ironic"
"»Herr Hofrat,« sagte der junge Mann, »ich wollte gehorsamst melden, daß ich mich entschlossen habe, zu reisen.«","""Herr Hofrat,"" said the young man, ""I wanted to report that I had decided to travel.""","“Herr Hofrat,” the young man said, “I should like to tell you, if you will pardon me, that I have decided to leave.” “What’s that?","“Director Behrens,” the young man said, “I wish to report that I have decided to depart.” “What’s this?"
"Naphta lachte höhnisch, während Hans Castorp beteuerte, Herrn Settembrini das Gesagte aufs Wort glauben zu wollen. Wenn er sich so vorstelle, wie dieser unter dem Schnurrbart gelächelt und den Schwachkopf mit unnachgiebiger Vernunft ins Auge gefaßt habe, so verstehe er wohl, wie der arme Kerl sich habe zusammennehmen und der Klarheit die Ehre geben müssen, wenn er natürlich auch wohl Herrn Settembrinis Erscheinen als höchst unwillkommene Störung empfunden haben werde … Aber auch Naphta hatte Irrenanstalten besucht, er entsann sich eines Aufenthaltes in dem »Unruhigen Hause« einer solchen, und da hatten Szenen und Bilder sich ihm dargeboten, vor welchen, du lieber Gott, Herrn Settembrinis vernunftvoller Blick und züchtiger Einfluß wohl kaum verfangen haben würde: Dantische Szenen, groteske Bilder des Grauens und der Qual: die nackten Irren im Dauerbade hockend, in allen Posen der Seelenangst und des Entsetzensstupors, einige in lautem Jammer schreiend, andere mit erhobenen Armen und klaffenden Mündern ein Gelächter ausstoßend, worin alle Ingredienzien der Hölle sich gemischt hatten …","Naphta laughed scornfully, while Hans Castorp protested that he wanted to believe what Herr Settembrini had said. If he imagined him smiling under his mustache and eyeing the idiot with unyielding reason, he could understand how the poor fellow had to pull himself together and give credit to clarity, even though he was, of course, Mr. Settembrinis appearance as a highly unwelcome disturbance... But Naphta too had visited insane asylums, he recalled a stay in the ""Unrestful House"" of one of these, and there scenes and images had presented themselves to him, before which, dear God, Mr. Settembrini's more reasonable gaze and chaste influence would hardly have caught: Dantic scenes, grotesque images of horror and torment: the naked lunatics squatting in the long-term bath, in all poses of anguish and stupor of horror, some screaming in loud lamentation, others with raised arms and gaping mouths uttering a laugh in which all the ingredients of hell were mixed...","Naphta laughed derisively; Hans Castorp protested his readiness to believe Herr Settembrini’s statement. Indeed, as he pictured him smiling beneath his moustaches and fixing the feeble-minded with the eye of remorseless reason, he could well understand how the poor fellow had had to pull himself together and behave with “temporary self-control,” though probably finding Herr Settembrini’s presence a most unwelcome incident.—But Naphta too had had experience of asylums for the insane. He recalled a visit to the violent ward, where he had seen such sights as—my God, such sights as would have been a bit too much even for Herr Settembrini’s intelligent eye or disciplinary powers: Dantesque scenes, monstrous tableaux of horror and agony: naked madmen squatting in the continuous bath, in every posture of mental anguish or in the stupor of despair; some shrieking aloud, others with uplifted arms and gaping mouths whence issued laughter that mingled all the elements of hell—","Naphta laughed scornfully, whereas Hans Castorp stated he believed every word Herr Settembrini had said. When he pictured him with his moustache, smiling and staring some feebleminded fellow directly in the eye, he could well understand why the poor man would have pulled himself together and given reality its due, however unwelcome a disturbance Herr Settembrini’s visit must have been for him. But Naphta had also visited madhouses, and he recalled having entered a “violent ward,” the kind of place that offered scenes and images for which, good God, Herr Settembrini’s reasonable stare and decorous influence would hardly have been a match. Grotesque images of horror and torment straight out of Dante: naked madmen living their lives squatting in tubs of water, in every pose of mental anguish and terrified stupor, some screaming aloud in lament , others with arms raised and mouths gaping as they burst with laughter—all the ingredients of hell merged in one."
"Sie drehten die gewechselten Geschenke zwischen den Fingern, prüften mit sachlicher Kennerschaft diese schlanken Körper, die mit den schräg gleichlaufenden Rippen ihrer erhöhten, hie und da etwas gelüfteten Wickelränder, ihrem aufliegenden Geäder, das zu pulsen schien, den kleinen Unebenheiten ihrer Haut, dem Spiel des Lichtes auf ihren Flächen und Kanten etwas organisch Lebendiges hatten. Hans Castorp sprach es aus:","They twirled the exchanged gifts between their fingers, examined these slender bodies with objective knowledge, with the slanting parallel ribs of their raised, here and there somewhat aired wrapper edges, their overlying veins that seemed to pulsate, the small bumps in their skin, the play of the light had something organically alive on their surfaces and edges. Hans Castorp pronounced it:","They twirled their respective offerings between their fingers, felt connoisseur-like the slender shapes that possessed, or so one might think, some organic quality of life, with their ribs formed by the diagonal parallel edges of the raised, here and there porous wrapper, the exposed veins that seemed to pulsate, the small inequalities of the skin, the play of light on planes and edges. Hans Castorp expressed it: “A cigar like that is alive—it breathes.","Each rolled his gift between his fingers, examining the slender body with expert eye—there was an organic, living quality about the even rows of raised and slanted ribs, the tiny pores along the edges here and there, the veins that seemed almost to throb, the little irregularities of skin, the play of light on surfaces and edges. Hans Castorp put it into words."
"2. da außerdem eine gerichtliche Bestrafung des Herrn Kasimir Japoll die Beleidigung, durch die Herr Kasimir Japoll den Namen und das Haus des Herrn Stanisław von Zutawski und seiner Gemahlin Jadwiga in verleumderischer Weise zu schänden versuchte, nicht zu sühnen vermöchte,","2. since a judicial punishment of Mr. Kasimir Japoll could not atone for the insult by which Mr. Kasimir Japoll tried to desecrate the name and the house of Mr. Stanisław von Zutawski and his wife Jadwiga in a slanderous way,","“2. and since furthermore, a legal chastisement of M. Kasimir Japoll would in no wise atone for the insult by which he had sought to injure and defame the name and family of M. Stanislaw von Zutawski,","“2. since no legal sentence imposed could compensate for the insult Herr Kasimir Japoll had slanderously brought upon the name and house of Herr Stanislaw von Zutawski and his wife, Jadwiga,"
"Zur Abendmahlzeit kleidete er sich gewissenhaft um und aß dann zwischen Miß Robinson und der Lehrerin Juliennesuppe, gebackenes und gebratenes Fleisch nebst Zubehör, zwei Stücke von einer Torte, in der alles vorkam: Makronenteig, Buttercreme, Schokolade, Fruchtmus und Marzipan, und sehr guten Käse auf Pumpernickel. Wieder ließ er sich eine Flasche Kulmbacher dazu geben. Als er jedoch sein hohes Glas zur Hälfte geleert hatte, erkannte er klar und deutlich, daß er ins Bett gehöre. In seinem Kopfe rauschte es, seine Augenlider waren wie Blei, sein Herz ging wie eine kleine Pauke, und zu seiner Qual bildete er sich ein, daß die hübsche Marusja, die, vornüber geneigt, ihr Gesicht in der Hand mit dem kleinen Rubin verbarg, über ihn lache, obgleich er sich so angestrengt bemüht hatte, keinerlei Veranlassung dazu zu geben. Wie aus weiter Ferne hörte er Frau Stöhr etwas erzählen oder behaupten, was ihm als so tolles Zeug erschien, daß er in verwirrte Zweifel {129}geriet, ob er noch richtig höre oder ob Frau Stöhrs Äußerungen sich vielleicht in seinem Kopfe zu Unsinn verwandelten. Sie erklärte, daß sie achtundzwanzig verschiedene Fischsaucen zu bereiten verstehe, – sie habe den Mut, dafür einzustehen, obgleich ihr eigener Mann sie gewarnt habe, davon zu sprechen. »Sprich nicht davon!« habe er gesagt. »Niemand wird es dir glauben, und wenn man es glaubt, so wird man es lächerlich finden!« Und doch wolle sie es heute einmal sagen und offen bekennen, daß es achtundzwanzig Fischsaucen seien, die sie machen könne. Das schien dem armen Hans Castorp entsetzlich; er erschrak, griff sich mit der Hand an die Stirn und vergaß vollkommen, einen Bissen Pumpernickel mit Chester, den er im Munde hatte, fertig zu kauen und hinunterzuschlucken. Noch als man von Tische aufstand, hatte er ihn im Munde.","For supper he dressed conscientiously, and then ate julienne soup between Miss Robinson and the teacher, baked and roasted meat with accessories, two slices of a cake that had everything: macaroon dough, buttercream, chocolate, fruit puree and marzipan, and very good cheese on pumpernickel. Again he asked for a bottle of Kulmbacher. However, when he was halfway through his tall glass, he realized clearly that he belonged in bed. His head roared, his eyelids were like lead, his heart beat like a little drum, and to his torment he imagined that pretty Marusya, who was bending over and hiding her face in her hand with the little ruby, laughing at him, although he had tried so hard not to give any cause to it. As if from far away, he heard Frau Stöhr say something or say something that seemed so crazy to him that he got into confused doubts as to whether he was still hearing correctly or whether Frau Stöhr's utterances were turning into nonsense in his head. She declared that she knew how to make twenty-eight different fish sauces - she had the courage to stand up for them, although her own husband had warned her not to speak of them. ""Don't talk about it!"" he said. ""Nobody will believe you, and if they do, they will find it ridiculous!"" And yet she wanted to say it today and openly admit that there were twenty-eight fish sauces that she could make. That seemed dreadful to poor Hans Castorp; he was startled, put his hand to his forehead, and completely forgot to finish chewing and swallowing a mouthful of pumpernickel with chester that he had in his mouth. He still had it in his mouth when you got up from the table.","Followed a last period of rest on the balcony, a fugitive and empty interlude of an hour and a half. He dressed conscientiously for the evening meal, and, sitting in his place between Miss Robinson and the schoolmistress, he ate: julienne soup, baked and roast meats with suitable accompaniments, two pieces of a tart made of macaroons, butter-cream, chocolate, jam and marzipan, and lastly excellent cheese and pumpernickel. As before, he ordered a bottle of Kulmbacher. But, by the time he had half emptied his tall glass, he became clearly and unmistakably aware that bed was the best place for him. His head roared , his eyelids were like lead, his heart went like a set of kettledrums, and he began to torture himself with the suspicion that pretty Marusja, who was bending over her plate covering her face with the hand that wore the ruby ring, was laughing at him— though he had taken enormous pains not to give occasion for laughter. Out of the far distance he heard Frau Stöhr telling, or asserting, something which seemed to him such utter nonsense that he was conscious of a despairing doubt as to whether he had heard aright, or whether he had turned her words to nonsense in his addled brain. She was declaring that she knew how to make twenty-eight different sauces to serve with fish; she would stake her reputation on the fact, though her own husband had warned her not to talk about it: “Don’t talk about it,” he had told her; “nobody will believe it, or, if they do, they will simply laugh at you!” And yet she would say it, say once and for all, that it was twenty-eight fishsauces she could make. All of which, to our good Hans Castorp, seemed too mad for words; he clutched his brow with his hand, and in his amazement quite forgot that he had a bite of pumpernickel and Cheshire still to be chewed and swallowed. When he rose from table, he had it still in his mouth.","He dressed painstakingly for supper, and, seated between Miss Robinson and the teacher, he ate julienne soup, pot roast with vegetables, and two pieces of a torte with layers of just about everything—macaroon, buttercream, chocolate, fruit jam, and marzipan—followed by a very good cheese and pumpernickel. He again ordered a bottle of Kulmbach beer to go with it. But he had drunk only half a glass when it became obvious to him that he belonged in bed. His head was buzzing, his eyelids were like lead, his heart beat like a little kettledrum, and to add to his agony, he took a notion that pretty Marusya, who was sitting bent forward, her face buried in the hand with the ruby ring, was laughing at him, even though he had taken considerable pains not to give her any reason to do so. Far in the distance, he could hear Frau Stöhr telling some story or making some claim that seemed so absolutely crazy that in his confusion he was not sure whether he had heard right or if what Frau Stöhr was saying had been transformed into nonsense inside his head. She was explaining that she knew how to prepare twenty-eight different sauces for fish—and she would stake her reputation on the fact, although her husband had warned her not to speak about it. “Don’t say anything about it!” he had said. “No one will believe it, and even if they do, they’ll simply find it ridiculous.” All the same, she was quite willing to confess before one and all that she could prepare a total of twenty-eight different fish sauces. This was just too horrible for poor Hans Castorp; in his dismay, he pressed his hand to his brow and simply forgot that he had a bite of pumpernickel and cheddar in his mouth, ready to be chewed and swallowed. He still had it in his mouth when everyone stood up to leave."
»Verbindlichsten Dank! Und andererseits?« erwiderte der Gefragte …,"""Thank you very much! And on the other hand?” replied the person asked …","“Topping, thanks, I hope it’s mutual,” responded the young man.","“Splendid, thanks. And that is mutual, I hope?” came the response."
"»Nein, aber in den nächsten Tagen, Mittwoch oder Donnerstag.«","""No, but in the next few days, Wednesday or Thursday.""","“No, but inside the next few days, Wednesday or Thursday.”","“No, but within a few days—Wednesday or Thursday.”"
"Mit froststarren Mienen, barhaupt, in ihren Überschuhen aus Gummistoff bald die hart knirschende und mit Asche bestreute Schneedecke tretend, die den Bürgersteig aufhöhte, bald mit den Füßen durch die lockeren Schneemassen des {685}Fahrdammes pflügend, Settembrini in einer Winterjacke, deren Biberkragen und Ärmelrevers vermöge enthaarter Stellen gleichsam räudig wirkten, die er jedoch elegant zu tragen wußte, Naphta in einem schwarzen, fußlangen und hochgeschlossenen Mantel, der mit Pelz nur gefüttert war und außen nichts davon sehen ließ, stritten sie um diese Prinzipien mit der persönlichsten Angelegentlichkeit, wobei es öfters geschah, daß sie sich nicht aneinander, sondern an Hans Castorp wandten, dem der eben Redende seine Sache vortrug und vorhielt, indem er auf den Gegner nur mit dem Haupte oder dem Daumen deutete. Sie hatten ihn zwischen sich, und er, den Kopf hin und her wendend, stimmte bald dem einen, bald dem anderen zu oder machte, stehen bleibend, den Oberkörper schräg zurückgebeugt und mit der Hand im gefütterten Ziegenlederhandschuh gestikulierend, etwas Eigenes, selbstverständlich höchst Unzulängliches geltend, indes Ferge und Wehsal die drei umkreisten, jetzt vor ihnen, dann hinter ihnen sich hielten oder auch eine Reihe mit ihnen bildeten, bis der Verkehr ihre Linie wieder auflöste.","With frozen expressions, bareheaded, in their rubber overshoes, now treading the hard, crunching and ash-strewn blanket of snow that raised the pavement, now plowing with their feet through the loose masses of snow of the roadway, Settembrini in a winter jacket, their beaver collar and Lapels on the sleeves appeared mangy, so to speak, but which he knew how to wear elegantly, Naphta in a black, ankle-length, high-necked coat that was only lined with fur and showed nothing of it on the outside, they argued about these principles with the most personal concern, whereby It often happened that they did not turn to each other, but to Hans Castorp, to whom the one who was speaking explained and reproached his case, pointing at his opponent only with his head or his thumb. They had him between them, and he, turning his head this way and that, first agreed to one thing, then to the other, or, standing still, leaning back at an angle and gesturing with his hand in the lined goatskin glove, did something of his own, which of course was highly inadequate while Ferge and Wehsal circled the three, now in front of them, then behind them, or even forming a line with them, until the traffic broke their line again.","Bare-headed, their faces stiff in the cold, they trod in their rubber galoshes the crisp, creaking, cinder-strewn snow, or ploughed through porous masses in the gutter: Settembrini in a winter jacket with beaver collar and cuffs—the fur was worn to the pelt, and looked fairly mangy, but he knew how to carry it off with an air; Naphta in a long black overcoat that came down to his heels and up to his ears, and showed none of the fur with which it was lined throughout. Both speakers treated their theme as of the utmost personal concern; and both often turned, not to each other but to Hans Castorp, with argument and exposition, referring to their opponents with a jerk of the head or thumb. They had him between them, and he turned his head to assent first to one and then to the other; now and again he stood stock-still on the path, tipping his body back from the waist and gesturing with his fur-lined glove as he made some quite inadequate contribution to the talk. Ferge and Wehsal circled about, now in front and now behind, now in a single row until they had to break up their line again to let people pass.","Faces numbed with cold, heads bare, but feet in rubber galoshes, they moved along the sidewalk, its deep layer of snow strewn with ashes and crunching underfoot, or plowed through looser mounds of snow in the road— Settembrini in his winter coat, its beaver collar and lapels worn so smooth and hard that it had a rather mangy look, though he wore it elegantly all the same; Naphta in a black, ankle-length coat that buttoned to the neck, fully lined with fur, but not so that anyone could see it. And as they moved along, they argued their principles with great personal urgency, although frequently they did not speak to one another, but instead each would turn to Hans Castorp to deliver his views, lecturing him, while pointing a head or thumb at the real opponent. Hans Castorp was trapped between them; turning his head back and forth, he would agree first with one, then with the other, or he would come to a stop, bending his body backward and gesticulating with a hand inside its fur-lined goatskin glove, and offer some opinion of his own—some highly unsatisfactory comment, of course; meanwhile Ferge and Wehsal circled the three of them, now walking in front, now behind, now forming a single row, until oncoming traffic broke the group up again."
"»Hm«, sagte Hans Castorp und zeichnete weiter. »Hinter den Kulissen also geht so etwas vor sich.«","""Hm,"" said Hans Castorp and continued to draw. ""So there's something going on behind the scenes.""","“H’m,” said Hans Castorp, and continued to draw. “I see. That sort of thing goes on behind the scenes, then.”","“Hmm,” Hans Castorp said and went on drawing. “So that quite a bit is happening backstage.”"
"Naphta enthielt sich nicht, aus seiner gebundenen Haltung heraus und ohne ihn anzublicken, leise und bissig gegen ihn hin zu äußern:","Naphta did not refrain from saying in a low, scathing voice to him from his bound posture and without looking at him:","And Naphta, without looking at him, or relaxing his contained manner, apparently could not refrain from saying, low and bitingly: “I am glad to see that despite your enthusiasm for freedom and progress, you have some feeling for serious things.”","Naphta did not look up from his own constrained pose, but he could not refrain from whispering a cutting remark in Settembrini’s direction: “I’m glad to see you have feelings not just for freedom and progress, but for serious matters as well.”"
"»Ja, ja!« sagte er abermals und ging zu etwas Viertem über, etwas sehr Liebem und Gutem.","""Yes, yes!"" he said again, moving on to something fourth, something very dear and good.","“Yes, yes,” he said, as before; and passed on to a fourth record, something very dear and good.","“Yes, yes,” he said once more, and moved onto a fourth piece, something very fine and dear to him."
"»Poète!« sagte sie. »Bourgeois, humaniste et poète, – voilà l’allemand au complet, comme il faut!«","""Poète!"" she said. »Bourgeois, humaniste et poète, – voilà l’allemand au complete, comme il faut!«","“Poète!” she said. “Bourgeois, humaniste, et poète— voilà l’allemand au complet, comme il faut!”","“A poet!” she said. “A bourgeois, a humanist, and a poet—behold, Germany all rolled into one, just as it should be!”"
"»Ein verwickelter Vorgang«, lachte der Italiener. »Eine sonderbare Art der Einbürgerung. Natürlich, die Jugend ist zu allem fähig.

It doesn’t get used to things, but it strikes roots.”","“A convoluted process,” the Italian said with a laugh. “A strange sort of naturalization. But of course, youth is capable of most anything.

"»Ich sehe, Sie haben ihn aufs Korn genommen«, antwortete Behrens, »und sich den Mann gut angesehen in seiner Eigenart, was ich vernünftig finde, denn Sie werden sich mit seinem Vorhandensein arrangieren müssen.«","""I see you took aim at him,"" answered Behrens, ""and took a good look at the man's peculiarities, which I think is reasonable, because you'll have to come to terms with his presence.""","Behrens answered: “I see you’ve taken his number—you’re right, too, for you will have to come to terms with his being here.”","“I see you’ve given him the once-over,” Behrens replied, “and have a good eye for his peculiarities. Very reasonable of you, because you’ll have to come to terms with his being here.”"
"Und dann tat er den Kräften Einhalt. Der Fußboden kam zur Ruhe, die Lichterscheinungen schwanden, das magische Fenster hüllte sich wieder in Dunkel. Das Deckenlicht ging an. Und während auch Hans Castorp sich in die Kleider warf, gab Behrens den jungen Leuten einige Auskunft über seine Beobachtungen, unter Berücksichtigung ihrer laienhaften Auffassungsfähigkeit. Was im besonderen Hans Castorp betraf, so hatte der optische Befund den akustischen so genau bestätigt, wie die Ehre der Wissenschaft es nur irgend verlangte. Es seien die alten Stellen sowohl wie die frische zu sehen gewesen, und {334}»Stränge« zögen sich von den Bronchien aus ziemlich weit in das Organ hinein, – »Stränge mit Knötchen«. Hans Castorp werde es selbst auf dem Diapositivbildchen nachprüfen können, das ihm, wie gesagt, demnächst werde eingehändigt werden. Also Ruhe, Geduld, Mannszucht, messen, essen, liegen, abwarten und Tee trinken. Er wandte ihnen den Rücken. Sie gingen. Hans Castorp, hinter Joachim, blickte im Hinausgehen über die Schulter. Vom Techniker eingelassen, betrat Frau Chauchat das Laboratorium.","And then he stopped the forces. The floor came to rest, the phenomena of light disappeared, the magic window shrouded itself in darkness again. The overhead light came on. And while Hans Castorp also threw on his clothes, Behrens gave the young people some information about his observations, taking into account their layman's ability to understand. As far as Hans Castorp was concerned in particular, the optical findings had confirmed the acoustic ones as precisely as the honor of science could ever demand. The old spots as well as the fresh ones could be seen, and {334}""strings"" stretched quite far into the organ from the bronchi - ""strings with nodules"". Hans Castorp will be able to check it himself on the slide that, as I said, will be handed to him shortly. So rest, patience, discipline, measure, eat, lie down, wait and drink tea. He turned his back on them. They went. Hans Castorp, behind Joachim, looked over his shoulder as they left. Let in by the technician, Mrs. Chauchat entered the laboratory.","He closed off the current. The floor ceased to vibrate, the lightnings to play, the magic window was quenched in darkness. The ceiling light came on. As Hans Castorp flung on his clothes, the Hofrat gave the two young men the results of his observations, in non-technical language, out of regard for their lay minds. It seemed that in Hans Castorp’s case, the test of the eye confirmed that of the ear in a way to add lustre to science. The Hofrat had seen the old as well as the fresh spots, and “strands” ran from the bronchial tubes rather far into the organ itself—“strands” with “nodules.” Hans Castorp would be able to see for himself later, in the diapositive which they would give him for his very own. The word of command was calm, patience, manly self-discipline; measure, eat, lie down, wake, and drink tea. They left; Hans Castorp, going out behind Joachim, looked over his shoulder. Ushered in by the technician, Frau Chauchat was entering the laboratory.","And then he put a stop to those great forces. The floor grew quiet, the spectacle of lights faded, the magic window wrapped itself in darkness. The ceiling lamp went on. And while Hans Castorp threw on his clothes, Behrens gave the young people some information about what he had observed, though with proper regard to their abilities as laymen to comprehend it. As for Hans Castorp’s case, the optical and acoustical results corresponded as precisely as one could ever demand of science. Both the old spots and the fresh one had been visible, and there were “strands” that ran from the bronchi well down into the lung itself—“strands with nodules.” Hans Castorp would be able to verify that for himself on the X-ray plate, a copy of which he would soon be given as promised. And so: rest, patience, manly discipline, food, thermometers, sleep—just grin and bear it. He turned his back to them. They departed. First Joachim, then Hans Castorp, who glanced back over his shoulder as they left. Ushered in by the technician, Frau Chauchat was now entering the laboratory."
"Nachmittags zwischen zwei und vier Uhr lag Hans Castorp in der Balkonloge und blickte wohlverpackt, den Kopf gestützt von der weder zu steil noch zu flach eingestellten Lehne seines vorzüglichen Liegestuhls, über die bepolsterte Brüstung hin auf Wald und Gebirge. Der grünschwarze, mit Schnee beschwerte Tannenforst stieg die Lehnen hinan, und zwischen den Bäumen war aller Boden kissenweich von Schnee. Darüber erhob sich das Felsgebirg ins Grauweiß, mit ungeheueren Schneeflächen, die von einzelnen, dunkler hervorragenden Felsnasen unterbrochen waren, und zart verdunstenden Kammlinien. Es schneite still. Alles verschwamm mehr und mehr. Der Blick, in ein wattiges Nichts gehend, brach sich leicht zum Schlummer. Ein Frösteln begleitete den Augenblick des Hinüberganges, doch gab es dann kein reineres Schlafen als dieses hier in der Eiseskälte, dessen Traumlosigkeit von keinem unbewußten Gefühl organischer Lebenslast berührt wurde, da {711}das Atmen der leeren, nichtig-dunstlosen Luft dem Organismus nicht schwerer fiel als das Nichtatmen den Toten. Beim Erwachen war das Gebirge völlig im Schneenebel verschwunden, und nur Stücke davon, eine Gipfelkuppe, eine Felsnase, traten wechselnd für einige Minuten hervor, um wieder verhüllt zu werden. Dies leise Geisterspiel war äußerst unterhaltend. Man mußte scharf achtgeben, um die Schleier-Phantasmagorie in ihren heimlichen Wandlungen zu belauschen. Wild und groß zeigte sich, frei im Dunste, eine Felsgebirgspartie, von der weder Gipfel noch Fuß zu sehen war. Aber da man sie nur eine Minute aus den Augen gelassen, war sie entschwunden.","In the afternoon between two and four o'clock Hans Castorp lay in the balcony box and looked well wrapped up, his head supported by the backrest of his excellent deck chair, which was neither too steep nor too flat, over the upholstered balustrade at the forest and mountains. The green-black forest of firs, weighed down with snow, climbed the leanings, and between the trees all the ground was soft as a pillow with snow. Above that the rocky mountains rose into gray-white, with immense snow surfaces, which were interrupted by single, darker protruding rock outcrops, and delicately evaporating crest lines. It was snowing silently. Everything blurred more and more. The look, going into a fluffy nothingness, easily broke into slumber. A shiver accompanied the moment of transition, but then there was no purer sleep than this here in the freezing cold, whose dreamlessness was not touched by any unconscious feeling of organic life burden, since breathing the empty, void, vaporless air was no more difficult for the organism fell as not breathing the dead. On waking, the mountain range had completely disappeared in the snow mist, and only pieces of it, a peak, a rocky outcrop, emerged alternately for a few minutes, only to be veiled again. This quiet ghost game was extremely entertaining. One had to be very careful to overhear the veiled phantasmagoria in its secret transformations. Wild and large, free in the haze, a rocky mountain range appeared, of which neither the summit nor the foot could be seen. But being left out of sight for just a minute, she was gone.","Afternoons between three and four, Hans Castorp lay in his balcony box, well wrapped, his head against the cushion, not too high or too low, of his excellent chair, and looked out at forest and mountain over his thick-upholstered balustrade. The snow-laden firs, dark-green to blackness, went marching up the sides of the valley, and beneath them the snow lay soft like down pillows. Above the tree line, the mountain walls reared themselves into the grey-white air: huge surfaces of snow, with softly veiled crests, and here and there a black jut of rock. The snow came silently down. The scene blurred more and more, it inclined the eye, gazing thus into woolly vacuity, to slumber. At the moment of slipping off one might give a start—yet what sleep could be purer than this in the icy air? It was dreamless. It was as free from the burden—even the unconscious burden—of organic life, as little aware of an effort to breathe this contentless, weightless, imperceptible air as is the breathless sleep of the dead. When Hans Castorp stirred again, the mountains would be wholly lost in a cloud of snow; only a pinnacle, a jutting rock, might show one instant, to be rapt away the next. It was absorbing to watch these ghostly pranks; one needed to keep alert to follow the transmutations, the veiling and unveiling. One moment a great space of snow-covered rock would reveal itself, standing out bold and free, though of base or peak naught was to be seen. But if one ceased to fix one’s gaze upon it, it was gone, in a breath.","Afternoons, between two and four, Hans Castorp would lie on his balcony—wrapped up nice and warm, his head propped neither too high nor too low, but just right, against the adjustable back of his splendid lounge chair—and look out over the pillowed railing to the forests and mountains. Laden with snow, the greenish-black pine forest marched up the slopes, and between the trees every inch of ground was cushioned soft with snow. Above the forest, mountains of rock rose into whitish gray, with vast surfaces of snow broken occasionally by dark, jutting crags and ridges gently dissolving into mist. Snow was falling silently. Everything grew more and more blurred. Gazing into cottony nothing, eyes easily closed and drifted into slumber, and at just that moment a shiver passed over the body. And yet there could be no purer sleep than here in this icy cold, a dreamless sleep untouched by any conscious sense of organic life’s burdens; breathing this empty, vaporless air was no more difficult for the body than non-breathing was for the dead. And upon awakening, you found the mountains had vanished entirely in the snowy fog, with only pieces of them, a summit, a crag, emerging for a few moments and disappearing again. This soft, ghostly pantomime was extremely entertaining. You had to pay close attention to catch each stealthy change in the misty phantasmagoria. Freed of clouds, a huge, primitive segment of mountain, lacking top and bottom, would suddenly appear. But if you took your eye off it for only a minute, it had vanished again."
"»Auch nicht übel. Legen wir uns also, Ingenieur. Beziehen wir unsere Stellungen.«","'Not bad either. So let's lie down, engineer. Let's take up positions.""","“That is good too.

"Hans Castorp drehte das rätselhafte Ding zwischen den Fingern. Es war aus Stahl, Elfenbein, Gold und Kautschuk, sehr wunderlich anzusehen. Es zeigte zwei gebogene, stahlblanke Gabelzinken mit äußerst scharfen Spitzen, einen leicht gewundenen elfenbeinernen und mit Gold eingelegten Mittelteil, in dem die Zinken bis zu einem gewissen Grade und auf eine gewisse elastische Weise, nämlich nach innen, beweglich waren, und endete in einer ballonartigen Erweiterung aus halbstarrem schwarzem Gummi.

The whole thing was only about two inches long.","Hans Castorp turned the puzzling object between his fingers. It was made of steel, ivory, gold, and rubber—curious handiwork.

"»Ja, und damals war ich frei, es zu tun, obgleich ich es unvernünftig fand, die Flinte ins Korn zu werfen, nur weil die hiesige Luft mir ein bißchen zusetzte. Seitdem hat sich die Sachlage aber doch geändert.

But now it is a rather different state of affairs: I have been examined, and Hofrat Behrens told me in so many words that it would be no good my going home, I should only have to come back again; and that if I stopped down there, the whole lobe would be at the devil before you could say Jack Robinson.”","“Yes, and at the time I was free to do so, although I thought it unreasonable to throw in the towel just because the local air was a little hard on me.

"»Eine sehr angenehme«, erwiderte Peeperkorn. »Ich lausche mit unwillkürlichem Vergnügen auf Ihr behendes kleines Wort, junger Mann. Es springt über Stock und Stein und rundet die Dinge zur Annehmlichkeit. Allein befriedigend, – nein. Ihre Antwort befriedigt mich nicht ganz, – verzeihen Sie, wenn ich Ihnen damit eine Enttäuschung bereite. ›Rigoros‹, lieber Freund, Sie brauchten dies Wort vorhin in Hinsicht auf gewisse von mir geäußerte Anschauungen. Aber auch in Ihren Äußerungen liegt eine gewisse Rigorosität, eine Strenge und Gezwungenheit, die mir mit Ihrer Natur nicht übereinzustimmen scheint, obgleich sie mir aus Ihrem Verhalten in gewisser Beziehung bekannt ist. Ich erkenne sie wieder. Es ist die nämliche Gezwungenheit, die Sie bei unseren gemeinsamen Unternehmungen, unseren Spaziergängen gegen Madame – gegen sonst niemanden – an den Tag legen, und für die Sie mir eine Erklärung – das ist eine Schuld, eine Schuldigkeit, junger Mann. Ich irre mich nicht. Die Beobachtung hat sich mir zu oft bestätigt, und es ist unwahrscheinlich, daß sie sich nicht auch anderen aufgedrängt haben sollte, mit dem Unterschiede, daß diese anderen sich möglicherweise, ja wahrscheinlich im Besitz der Erklärung des Phänomens befinden.«","""A very pleasant one,"" Peeperkorn replied. 'I listen with involuntary pleasure to your nimble little word, young man. It leaps over hill and dale and rounds things up for convenience. Satisfactory alone - no. I'm not entirely satisfied with your answer - forgive me if I've caused you disappointment. 'Rigorous', dear friend, you used that word earlier in relation to certain views I have expressed. But there is also a certain rigor in your statements, a severity and constraint that doesn't seem to agree with your nature, although I know it from your behavior in a certain respect. I recognize her. It's the same constraint that you show to Madame—to no one else—in our ventures together, our walks, and for which you give me an explanation—that's a debt, a debt, young man. I am not wrong. The observation has been confirmed to me too often, and it is unlikely that it should not have forced itself on others, with the difference that these others may, indeed probably, have the explanation of the phenomenon.""","“A very amiable answer,” Peeperkorn responded. “I listen with involuntary pleasure, young man, to your fluent little phrases. Your tongue runs on, it springs over stock and stone, and rounds off all the sharp corners. But satisfactory—no. Your answer does not quite satisfy me—you must forgive me for disappointing you. Austere, my dear friend—you used the word with reference to some of my remarks just now. But in yours too I seem to note a certain austerity, they seem a little stiff and forced, and not in harmony with your nature, though I am acquainted with the phenomenon through your bearing in one respect and therefore recognize it now. I mean the formal manner you assume toward Madame—and toward no one else in our little circle, on our walks and excursions. And of which you owe me an explanation. It is a duty, an obligation. I am not mistaken. I have confirmed my observation too many times, and it is unlikely it has not been remarked by others as well—with the difference that these others may perhaps—or even probably—possess a key which I do not.”","“A very agreeable answer,” Peeperkorn replied. “I listen with instinctive pleasure to your nimble little discourse, young man. It leaps over every hedge and ditch and rounds everything off agreeably. But satisfactory—no. Your answer does not quite satisfy me—forgive me if I disappoint you there. ‘ Rigor’—you used the word in regard to certain views I expressed just now. There is also a certain rigor in your remarks, a kind of stiffness, an austerity that does not seem consistent with your own nature, although I have noticed something of the sort in your behavior before. And I recognize it again now. It is the same stiffness you show toward Madame, and toward no one else in our group, during our strolls and outings. And you owe me an explanation—it is a debt, an obligation you owe me, young man. I am not mistaken in this. I have confirmed my observation too often, and it is not improbable that the same notion has occurred to the others—with one difference, that possibly, indeed probably, they know the explanation for this phenomenon.”"

"Becken und Teller gehörten ursprünglich nicht zueinander, wie man wohl sah, und wie sich der Kleine aufs neue belehren ließ; doch seien sie, sagte der Großvater, seit rund hundert Jahren, nämlich seit Anschaffung des Beckens, im Gebrauche vereinigt. Die Schale war schön, von einfacher, edler Gestalt, geformt von dem strengen Geschmack der Frühzeit des letzten Jahrhunderts. Glatt und gediegen, ruhte sie auf rundem Fuße und war innen vergoldet; doch war das Gold von der Zeit schon zum gelblichen Schimmer verblichen. Als einziger Zierat lief ein erhabener Kranz von Rosen und zackigen Blättern um ihren oberen Rand. Den Teller angehend, so war sein weit höheres Alter ihm von der Innenseite abzulesen. »Sechzehnhundertundfünfzig« stand dort in verschnörkelten Ziffern, und allerlei krause Gravierungen umrahmten die Zahl, ausgeführt in der »modernen Manier« von damals, schwülstig-willkürlich, Wappen und Arabesken, die halb Stern und halb Blume waren. Auf der Rückseite aber fanden sich in wechselnder Schriftart die Namen der Häupter einpunktiert, die im Gange der Zeit des Stückes Inhaber gewesen: Es waren ihrer schon sieben, versehen mit der Jahreszahl der Erb-Übernahme, und der Alte in der Binde wies mit dem beringten Zeigefinger den Enkel auf jeden einzelnen hin. Der Name des Vaters war da, der des Großvaters selbst und der des Urgroßvaters, und dann verdoppelte, verdreifachte und vervierfachte sich die Vorsilbe »Ur« im Munde des Erklärers, und der Junge lauschte seitwärts geneigten Kopfes, mit nachdenklich oder auch gedankenlos-träumerisch sich festsehenden Augen und andächtig-schläfrigem Munde auf das Ur-Ur-Ur-Ur, – diesen dunklen Laut der Gruft und der Zeitverschüttung, welcher dennoch zugleich einen fromm gewahrten Zusammenhang zwischen der Gegenwart, seinem ei{39}genen Leben und dem tief Versunkenen ausdrückte und ganz eigentümlich auf ihn einwirkte: nämlich so, wie es auf seinem Gesichte sich ausdrückte. Er meinte modrig-kühle Luft, die Luft der Katharinenkirche oder der Michaeliskrypte zu atmen bei diesem Laut, den Anhauch von Orten zu spüren, an denen man, den Hut in der Hand, in eine gewisse, ehrerbietig vorwärts wiegende Gangart ohne Benutzung der Stiefelabsätze verfällt; auch die abgeschiedene, gefriedete Stille solcher hallender Orte glaubte er zu hören; geistliche Empfindungen mischten sich mit denen des Todes und der Geschichte beim Klang jener dumpfen Silbe, und dies alles mutete den Knaben irgendwie wohltuend an, ja, es mochte wohl sein, daß er um des Lautes willen, um ihn zu hören und nachzusprechen, gebeten hatte, die Taufschale wieder einmal betrachten zu dürfen.","Basin and plate did not originally belong together, as one could see and as the little one allowed himself to be taught anew; but, said grandfather, they have been in common use for about a hundred years, since the pool was bought. The bowl was beautiful, of simple, noble form, shaped by the austere taste of the early part of the last century. Smooth and solid, it rested on a round base and was gilded on the inside; but the gold had already faded from time to a yellowish sheen. The only adornment was a raised wreath of roses and jagged leaves running around its upper edge. As for the plate, its much older age could be read on the inside. ""Sixteen hundred and fifty"" was written there in squiggly numerals, and all sorts of frilly engravings framed the number, executed in the ""modern manner"" of that time, turgidly haphazard, crests and arabesques that were half star and half flower. On the back, however, the names of the heads who had been owners of the piece over the course of time were dotted in changing fonts: There were already seven of them, provided with the year of the inheritance, and the old man in the bandage pointed with the ringed one Index finger the grandson at each one. The name of the father was there, that of the grandfather himself and that of the great-grandfather, and then the prefix ""Ur"" doubled, tripled and quadrupled itself in the mouth of the explainer, and the boy listened with tilted head, with thoughtful or even thoughtlessly dreaming himself fixed eyes and devoutly sleepy mouth on the great-great-great-great, - this dark sound of the crypt and the burying of time, which nevertheless at the same time expressed a devoutly observed connection between the present, his own life and the deeply immersed and had a very peculiar effect on him: namely, as it was expressed on his face. He thought he was breathing cool, musty air, the air of St. Catherine's Church or the Michaelis crypt with this sound, feeling the whiff of places where, hat in hand, one falls into a certain, reverentially rocking gait without using the heels of his boots ; he also thought he could hear the secluded, peaceful stillness of such echoing places; spiritual feelings mingled with those of death and history at the sound of that dull syllable, and all this seemed somehow pleasant to the boy, yes, it might well be that for the sake of the sound he had asked for it to be heard and repeated to be able to look at the baptismal bowl again.","Plate and basin, one could see, and as the little one heard once again, had not originally belonged together; but, Grandfather said, they had been in use together for a round hundred years, or since the time when the basin was made. The latter was very beautiful, of simple and elegant form, in the severe taste of the early nineteenth century. It rested, plain and solid, on a round base, and had once been gilt within, but the gilding had faded with time to a yellow shimmer. Its single decoration was a chaste garland of roses and serrated leaves about the brim. As for the plate, its far greater antiquity could be read on the inside: the date 1650 was engraved there in ornamental figures, framed in curly engraved lines executed in the “modern manner” of the period, florid and capricious devices and arabesques that were something between star and flower. On the back, engraved in a variety of scripts, were the names of its successive owners, seven in number, each with the date when it had passed into his hands. The old man named each one to his grandson, pointing with beringed index finger. There was Hans Castorp’s father’s name, there was Grandfather’s own, there was Great-grandfather’s; then the “great” came doubled, tripled, quadrupled, from the old man’s mouth, whilst the little lad listened, his head on one side, the eyes full of thought, yet fixed and dreamy too, the childish lips parted, half with awe, half sleepily. That great-great-great-great—what a hollow sound it had, how it spoke of the falling away of time, yet how it seemed the expression of a piously cherished link between the present, his own life, and the depth of the past! All that, as his face showed, made a profound impression. As he listened to the great-great-great, he seemed to smell the cool, earthy air of the vault of St. Michael’s or Saint Katherine’s; the breath of regions where one went hat in hand, the head reverently bowed, walking weavingly on the tips of one’s toes; seemed, too, to hear the remote and set-apart hush of those echoing places. Religious feeling mingled in his mind with thoughts of death and a sense of history, as he listened to the sombre syllable; he received therefrom an ineffable gratification—indeed, it may have been for the sake of hearing the sound that he so often begged to see the christening basin.","The bowl and the plate were not originally a set, as one could plainly see and as the boy was now instructed yet again; but they had been used together, his grandfather said, for around a hundred years now, ever since the bowl had been acquired. The bowl was beautiful, its lines simple and elegant, fashioned according to the austere taste of the early years of the last century. Smooth and massive, it rested on round feet, its interior lined with gold, though the yellow luster had faded with the years. The only ornamentation was an embossed wreath of roses and serrated leaves around its rim. As for the plate, one could read its much greater age right on its surface. There stood “1650” in ornate numbers, and framing the date were all sorts of curlicued engraved lines, done in the “modern fashion” of the period, bombastic and capricious arabesques and crests that were half stars, half flowers. The underside, however, was inscribed in a variety of ever-changing scripts with the names of those heads of the household who had been its owners over the course of time. There were seven names in all now, each rounded out with the date of inheritance, and the old man in the white necktie pointed with his ringed forefinger as he read off each of them to his grandson. His father’s name was there, as was in fact his grandfather’s, and his great-grandfather’s; and now that syllable came doubled, tripled, and quadrupled from the storyteller’s mouth; and the boy would lay his head to one side, his eyes fixed and full of thought, yet somehow dreamily thoughtless, his lips parted in drowsy devotion, and he would listen to the great-great-great-great—that somber sound of the crypt and buried time, which nevertheless both expressed a reverently preserved connection of his own life in the present to things now sunk deep beneath the earth and simultaneously had a curious effect on him: the same effect visible in the look on his face. The sound made him feel as if he were breathing the moldy, cool air of Saint Catherine’s Church or the crypt in Saint Michael’s, as if he could sense the gentle draft of places where as you walked, hat in hand, you fell into a certain reverential, forward rocking motion, your heels never touching the ground; and he also thought he could hear the remote, cloistered silence of those reverberating spaces. At the sound of those somber syllables, religious feelings got mixed up with a sense of death and history, and all of it together somehow left the boy with a pleasant sensation—indeed, it may well have been that it was solely for the sake of that sound, just to hear it and join in reciting it, that he had once again asked to be allowed to see the baptismal bowl."

"»Allein bedenkt! Der Berg ist heute zaubertoll,","»Alone consider! The mountain is magical today,","“But mind, the mountain’s magic-mad to-night,","There was general approval at Hans Castorp’s table of a note that Settembrini passed to him by way of Marusya, who was decked out in a jockey’s cap of green tissue paper, on which he had written in pencil: But bear in mind, the mountain’s mad with spells tonight,"
"Sein Kopf, der langsam und gelassen arbeitete, zumal Hans Castorp die beruhigende Gewohnheit des Porterfrühstücks auch auswärts beibehielt, füllte sich mit analytischer Geometrie, Differentialrechnung, Mechanik, Projektionslehre und Graphostatik, er berechnete geladenes und ungeladenes Deplacement, Stabilität, Trimmverlagerung und Metazentrum, wenn es ihm zuweilen auch sauer wurde. Seine technischen Zeichnungen, diese Spanten-, Wasserlinien- und Längsrisse, waren nicht ganz so gut, wie seine malerische Darstellung der {58}»Hansa« auf hoher See, aber wo es galt, die geistige Anschaulichkeit durch die sinnliche zu unterstützen, Schatten zu tuschen und Querschnitte in munteren Materialfarben anzulegen, tat Hans Castorp es an Geschicklichkeit den meisten zuvor.","His head, which worked slowly and calmly, especially as Hans Castorp maintained the comforting habit of porter breakfasts when he was away, filled with analytical geometry, differential calculus, mechanics, projection theory and graphostatics, calculating charged and uncharged displacement, stability, trim displacement and metacentre when it got angry at times too. His technical drawings, these frame, waterline and lengthways drawings, were not quite as good as his painterly depiction of the {58}Hansa on the high seas, but where it was necessary to support intellectual clarity with sensual clarity, shadows were added to apply ink and cross-sections in cheerful material colors, Hans Castorp had the skill of most before him.","Working slowly and deliberately—he kept up his soothing habit of porter breakfasts while he was away—he filled his brain with analytic and descriptive geometry, differential calculus, mechanics, projection, hydrostatic; reckoned full and empty displacement, stability, trim moment, and metacentre; and sometimes he got very sick of it. His technical drawings, the draughts and designs of frames, waterlines and longitudinal projections, were not quite so good as the picturesque representation of the Hansa on the high seas; but wherever it was in place to call in the sense perceptions to help out the intellectual, wherever he could wash in the shadows and lay on the cross-sections in the conventional colours, there Hans Castorp showed more dexterity than most.","His brain, which worked calmly and slowly—particularly since Hans Castorp retained the habit of drinking porter with his morning snack—gradually filled up with analytical geometry, differential equations, mechanics, projective geometry, and graphical statics. He calculated displacements—with full cargo and empty—stabilities, shifts in trim, and metacenters, though it was drudgery at times. His technical drawings, all the sketches of ribbing, waterlines, and full-length projections, were not quite as good as his watercolor depiction of the Hansa on the high sea, but when the abstract graphics required the sensual addition of a wash for shading or lively colors for various materials in a cross section, Hans Castorp proved more skillful than most."
"»Und dabei ist, was Sie hierarchische Anmaßung nennen, nichts als die Idee menschlicher Vereinigung im Zeichen des Geistes!«","""And yet what you call hierarchical presumption is nothing but the idea of human union under the sign of the spirit!""",“Though what you call hieratical presumption is nothing else than the conception of human unity in the name of the Spirit!”,"“And yet, what you call hierarchical pretension is actually nothing less than the idea of unifying mankind under the banner of the Spirit.”"
"»Das ist der Osten und die Krankheit«, erwiderte Hans Castorp. Mit Maßstäben der humanistischen Gesittung dürfe man da nicht herantreten, das sei verfehlt. Und da denke er nun darüber nach, daß Frau Chauchat also nach Spanien zu gehen beabsichtige. Hm. Spanien, das liege andererseits ebensoweit von der humanistischen Mitte ab, – nicht nach der weichen, sondern nach der harten Seite; es sei nicht Formlosigkeit, sondern Überform, der Tod als Form, sozusagen, nicht Todesauflösung, sondern Todesstrenge, schwarz, vornehm und blutig, Inquisition, gestärkte Halskrause, Loyola, Eskorial … Interessant, wie es Frau Chauchat in Spanien gefallen werde. Das Türenwerfen werde ihr dort wohl vergehen, und vielleicht kön{761}ne eine gewisse Kompensation der beiden außerhumanistischen Lager zum Menschlichen sich vollziehen. Es könne aber auch etwas recht boshaft Terroristisches zustande kommen, wenn der Osten nach Spanien gehe …","""That's the East and the disease,"" replied Hans Castorp. One should not approach this with the standards of humanistic morality, that would be wrong. And then he thought about it, that Mrs. Chauchat intended to go to Spain. Hm. Spain, on the other hand, is just as far from the humanistic center - not on the soft, but on the hard side; it was not formlessness, but superform, death as form, so to speak, not the dissolution of death, but the severity of death, black, noble and bloody, Inquisition, starched ruff, Loyola, Eskorial ... Interesting how Mrs. Chauchat would like it in Spain. She will probably forget about throwing doors there, and perhaps a certain compensation of the two non-humanist camps towards the human can take place. But something quite maliciously terrorist could also come about if the East went to Spain...","“That is the East—and the illness,” replied Hans Castorp. “One mustn’t try to measure her by humanistic standards.” He thought he remembered that she had intended to make a journey into Spain. H’m, Spain. That country too lay remote from the humanistic mean, though on the side of austerity rather than of softness. There it was not lack but excess of form that obtained; death itself was in the guise of form, not dissolution—black, refined, sanguinary, Inquisition, stiff ruff, Loyola, the Escurial, et cetera— h’m , yes, it was interesting; he wondered what Frau Chauchat would say to Spain. She’d probably get over banging doors—and perhaps a combination of the two extremes would bring her closer to the humane mean. Yet something pretty awful, terroristic, might come to pass if the East went to Spain. . .","“That comes from the Asiatic East and her illness,” Hans Castorp replied. One ought not to attempt to measure things by humanistic standards there, it didn’t work. But that was something to think about—Frau Chauchat’s plan to go to Spain. Hmm. Spain—it lay equally as far from the humanistic middle, not toward the soft side, but the hard. Spain was not a lack of form, but an excess of form, death as form, so to speak—not death as dissolution, but death as something austere, black, elegant, and bloody, the Inquisition, starched ruffs, Loyola, the Escorial. He would be interested to know how Frau Chauchat liked Spain. She would probably have to get over slamming doors there, and perhaps those two extrahumanistic camps would compensate for one another, have a humane effect on her. But then, too, something very nasty and terroristic might come of the East’s going off to Spain."
"»Nein, das muß ich Herrn Settembrini bestätigen«, mischte sich Hans Castorp in den Disput, dem er im Gehen gefolgt war, indem er den jeweils Sprechenden mit schrägem Kopfe aufmerksam von der Seite betrachtet hatte. »Mein Vetter und ich haben ja schon manchmal den Vorzug gehabt, uns mit ihm über diese und ähnliche Dinge zu unterhalten, das heißt, natürlich lief es darauf hinaus, daß wir ihm zuhörten, wie er seine Meinungen entwickelte und alles klarstellte. Und da kann ich denn bestätigen, und auch mein Vetter hier wird sich daran erinnern, daß Herr Settembrini mehr als einmal mit großer Begeisterung von dem Prinzip der Bewegung und der Rebellion und der Weltverbesserung sprach, das ja an sich kein so ganz friedliches Prinzip ist, sollte ich meinen, und daß diesem Prinzip noch große Anstrengungen bevorständen, ehe es überall gesiegt haben werde und die allgemeine glückliche Weltrepublik stattfinden könne. Das waren seine Worte, wenn sie auch natürlich viel plastischer und schriftstellerischer waren als meine, das versteht sich von selbst. Was ich aber ganz genau weiß und wörtlich behalten habe, weil ich als ausgepichter Zivilist direkt etwas darüber erschrak, das war, daß er sagte, {577}dieser Tag werde, wenn nicht auf Taubenfüßen, so auf Adlersschwingen kommen (über die Adlersschwingen erschrak ich, wie ich mich erinnere), und Wien müsse aufs Haupt geschlagen sein, wenn man das Glück in die Wege leiten wolle. Man kann also nicht sagen, daß Herr Settembrini den Krieg überhaupt verworfen hat. Habe ich recht, Herr Settembrini?«","""No, I have to confirm that to Herr Settembrini,"" Hans Castorp interjected into the dispute, which he followed as he walked, carefully glancing sideways at the speaker with his head tilted to one side. 'My cousin and I have sometimes had the privilege of conversing with him on these and similar matters, that is, of course, we ended up listening to him develop his opinions and make things clear. And I can confirm that, and my cousin here will also remember that Mr Settembrini spoke more than once with great enthusiasm about the principle of movement and rebellion and world improvement, which in itself is not a very peaceful principle, I should think so, and that great efforts are still to be made for this principle before it will be victorious everywhere and the universally happy world republic can take place. Those were his words, even if they were of course much more graphic and literary than mine, that goes without saying. But what I know for sure and remembered literally, because as a cunning civilian I was a bit frightened by it, was what he said , {577}this day will come, if not on dove's feet, then on eagle's wings (I was frightened by the eagle's wings, as I remember), and Vienna must have been beaten on the head if luck was to be set in motion. So it cannot be said that M. Settembrini rejected war altogether. Am I right, Mr Settembrini?'","“No, here I must really corroborate Herr Settembrini,“ Hans Castorp mixed in the dispute, which he had been following as they went, regarding attentively each speaker in turn, with his head on one side. “My cousin and I have had the privilege of frequent conversations with him on this and kindred subjects—what it amounted to, of course, was that we listened while he explained and developed his views—so I can vouch for the fact, and my cousin here will confirm me, that Herr Settembrini spoke more than once, with great enthusiasm, of the revolutionary principle, and about rebellion and reform—which is no very peaceful principle, I should think—and of the mighty efforts still to be made before it triumphs everywhere, and the great universal worldrepublic can come into being. Those were his words, though of course it sounded much more plastic and literary as he said it. But the part I have the most exact memory of, and have retained quite literally, because being a thorough-going civilian I found it quite alarming, was that he said the day would come, if not on the wings of doves, then on the pinions of eagles—it was the eagles’ pinions I was startled at—and that Vienna must be brought low before peace and prosperity could ensue. So it is not possible to say that Herr Settembrini condemned war as such. Am I right, Herr Settembrini?”","“No, I must confirm what Herr Settembrini says,” Hans Castorp remarked, breaking into the argument, which he had followed as they walked along, tilting his head to one side or the other, depending on the speaker. “My cousin and I have often had the privilege of conversing with him about these and similar matters—what I mean is, of course, that we listened to him develop and spell out his opinions. And I can confirm, as I’m sure my cousin also recalls, that Herr Settembrini has more than once waxed enthusiastic for the principle of motion and rebellion, of improvement in the world—hardly a principle of peace, I don’t suppose—and has noted that great efforts still lie ahead before such a principle will have triumphed everywhere and the universal, happy Republic of the World is established. I am more or less quoting him, although his words, of course, were much more graphic and literary than mine, but that’s obvious. One thing that has remained exactly in my memory, and I can quote it verbatim—because as a seasoned civilian I was somewhat appalled by it—was his saying that such a day would come, if not on the feet of doves, then on the pinions of eagles (it was the eagle pinions that appalled me, as I recall) and that the fatal blow must be struck against Vienna, if we wish to bring about universal happiness. So that one cannot say that Herr Settembrini has repudiated war. Am I not correct, Herr Settembrini?”"
"»Donner – Keil«, murmelte Hans Castorp. »Und ich habe überhaupt nicht gewußt und gedacht, daß es sowas in allem Ernste noch gäbe! Ein Jesuit. Ja so! … Aber sagen Sie mir eins: Wenn er nun also von dorther so wohl versorgt und versehen ist – warum in aller Welt wohnt er dann … Ich will gewiß Ihrem Logis nicht zu nahe treten, Herr Settembrini, Sie haben es reizend bei Lukaček, so angenehm separiert und außerdem besonders traulich. Ich meine aber: wenn Naphta es nun doch so dicke hat, um mich gewöhnlich auszudrücken – warum nimmt er sich nicht eine andere Wohnung, statiöser, mit ordentlichem Aufgang und großen Zimmern, in einem feinen Haus? Es hat ja direkt was Verstecktes und Abenteuerliches, wie er da in dem Loch mit all seiner Seide …«","""Thunder - wedge,"" murmured Hans Castorp. »And I didn't know at all and didn't think that something like that still existed in all seriousness! A Jesuit. So yes! ... But tell me one thing: If he is so well taken care of and cared for from there - why on earth does he live ... I certainly don't want to offend your lodgings, Mr Settembrini, you have a lovely time at Lukaček's, so pleasant separate and also particularly intimate. But I mean: if Naphta has it so big after all, to use my usual expression, why doesn't he take another apartment, more stately, with a decent entrance and large rooms, in a fine house? There's something hidden and adventurous about him there in that hole with all his silk...""","“Thunder and lightning!” Hans Castorp said. “And I never even knew that such things existed any more! A Jesuit! Well, well! But do tell me—if he is so well looked after by those people, why in the world does he live —I don’t mean to say a word about your lodgings, Herr Settembrini, and you are certainly charmingly fixed, at Lukaçek ’s, it is so retired and cosy there; but I mean, if Naphta really has such a pile as that, to speak vulgarly, why doesn’t he take another apartment, in a better house, more stately, with a proper entrance and large rooms? There is something secret and suspicious-looking about him, there in that hole, with all that silk—”","“I’ll be damned,” Hans Castorp muttered. “And I didn’t even know, never even thought that there still actually was such a thing. A Jesuit— so that’s it! But tell me one thing: if he’s so well taken care of by those people, why in the world would he live . . . I certainly don’t want to disparage your lodgings, Herr Settembrini, you have a very charming place there with Lukaček, it’s so nice and private, and especially cozy, too. But what I mean is—if Naphta is so flush, to use the vulgar term, why doesn’t he rent a different apartment, something grander, with a normal entrance and big rooms, in a large, fine home? There’s something almost furtive, even bizarre about the way he lives there in his little hole with all that silk.”"

"Hans Castorp erfuhr, daß man eine Fertigkeit rasch gewinnt, deren man innerlich bedürftig ist. Er erhob keine Ansprüche auf Virtuosentum. Was er brauchte, war ohne Überhitzung und Atemlosigkeit in ein paar Tagen erlernt. Er hielt sich an, die Füße hübsch beieinander zu halten und gleichlaufende Spuren zu schaffen, probte aus, wie man sich bei der Abfahrt des Stokkes zum Lenken bedient, lernte Hindernisse, kleine Bodenerhebungen, die Arme ausgebreitet, im Schwunge nehmen, aufgehoben und abtauchend wie ein Schiff auf stürmischer See, {716}und fiel seit dem zwanzigsten Versuch nicht mehr um, wenn er in voller Fahrt mit Telemarkschwung bremste, das eine Bein vorgeschoben, das andere ins Knie gebeugt. Allmählich erweiterte er den Umkreis seiner Übungen. Eines Tages sah Herr Settembrini ihn im weißlichen Nebel verschwinden, rief ihm durch die hohlen Hände eine Warnung nach und ging pädagogisch befriedigt nach Hause.","Hans Castorp learned that one quickly acquires a skill that one inwardly needs. He made no claims to virtuosity. What he needed was learned in a few days without overheating and breathlessness. He learned to keep his feet neatly together and create parallel tracks, practiced using the Stokke to steer downhill, learned obstacles, small bumps, arms outstretched, swinging, picking up and diving like a ship on a stormy sea, {716}and has not fallen over since the twentieth attempt when he brakes at full speed with a telemark swing, one leg out and the other bent on the knee. Gradually he widened the scope of his exercises. One day Mr. Settembrini saw him disappearing in the whitish mist, called out a warning through cupped hands and went home pedagogically satisfied.","Hans Castorp found that one quickly gets readiness in an art where strong desire comes in play. He was not ambitious for expert skill, and all he needed he acquired in a few days, without undue strain on wind or muscles. He learned to keep his feet tidily together and make parallel tracks; to avail himself of his stick in getting off; he learned how to take obstacles, such as small elevations of the ground, with a slight soaring motion, arms outspread, rising and falling like a ship on a billowy sea; learned, after the twentieth trial, not to trip and roll over when he braked at full speed, with the right Telemark turn, one leg forward, the other bent at the knee. Gradually he widened the sphere of his activities. One day it came to pass that Herr Settembrini saw him vanish in the far white mist; the Italian shouted a warning through cupped hands, and turned homewards, his pedagogic soul well-pleased.","Hans Castorp discovered that you quickly learn a skill if you truly need to. He made no pretense of becoming a virtuoso. What he required to know he learned in a few days, without overheating or having to fight for breath. He worked hard at keeping his feet nicely parallel, leaving a set of even tracks, practiced how to push himself off by steering with his poles, learned to negotiate obstacles, leaping over little mounds with arms widespread, rising and falling like a ship on a stormy sea; and after about the twentieth try he no longer upended when he put on the brakes by executing a telemark turn at full speed, sticking one leg out and bending the other at the knee. He gradually increased the range of his activities. One day Herr Settembrini saw him vanish in a burst of white fog; cupping his hands and calling after him to be careful, the contented pedagogue turned homeward."
"»Es war an jenem Abend, der mir den Vorzug Ihrer Bekanntschaft gebracht hatte«, begann er in singendem Ton und ließ am Schlusse die Stimme sinken, als sei das der erste Satz einer längeren Erzählung. »Wir hatten ein kleines Fest gefeiert, Speise und Trank genossen, und in gehobener Stimmung, in menschlich gelöster und kühner Verfassung suchten wir zu vorgerückter Stunde Arm in Arm unser Nachtlager auf. Da geschah es, hier vor meiner Tür, beim Abschiede, daß mir die Eingebung kam, die Aufforderung an Sie zu richten, Sie möchten mit den Lippen die Stirn der Frau berühren, die Sie mir als einen guten Freund von früherem Aufenthalte her vorgestellt hatte, und es ihr anheimzugeben, diese feierlich-heitere Handlung zum Zeichen der erhöhten Stunde vor meinen Augen zu erwidern. Sie verwarfen rundweg meine Anregung, verwarfen sie mit der Begründung, Sie empfänden es als unsinnig, mit meiner Reisebegleiterin Stirnküsse zu tauschen. Sie werden nicht bestreiten, daß das eine Erläuterung war, die selbst der Erklärung bedurft hätte, einer Erklärung, die Sie mir bis zur Stunde schuldig geblieben sind. Sind Sie gewillt, diese Schuld jetzt abzutragen?«","""It was on that evening that brought me the privilege of your acquaintance,"" he began in a singing tone, and at the end let his voice drop, as if this were the first sentence of a longer story. ""We had celebrated a little party, enjoyed food and drink, and in high spirits, in a relaxed and bold human condition, we went arm in arm to our camp for the night at a late hour. Then it happened, here in front of my door, as we were leaving, that the inspiration came to me to ask you to touch your lips to the forehead of the woman who had introduced you to me as a good friend from a previous stay. and leave it up to her to respond to this solemn, cheerful act as a sign of the elevated hour before my eyes. You flatly rejected my suggestion, on the grounds that you found it absurd to exchange kisses on the forehead with my traveling companion. You won't deny that that was an explanation that itself needed explanation, an explanation that you haven't given me until now. Are you willing to pay off that debt now?”","“On the evening when I first had the pleasure of making your acquaintance,” he said, beginning in a singsong tone, and letting his voice fall at the end, as though embarked on a long recitative, “we had a little celebration, sat very late eating and drinking and making merry, and then, in an elevated mood, of spirit free and unrestrained, arm in arm we sought our beds. As we parted, here at my door, the idea came to me to ask you to salute Madame on the brow, as a good friend from her former visit up here. You bluntly refused, rejected the idea on the ground that it would be preposterous. You will not deny that the expression itself demanded an explanation—an explanation for which you have remained until now in my debt. Are you willing to absolve yourself of it?”","“It was on the evening when I had the privilege of first making your acquaintance,” he began in a lilting tone, letting his voice fall at the end, as if this were the first sentence in a long story. “We had just celebrated a little feast, had enjoyed food and drink, and linking arms in an elevated mood, in a humanely relaxed and adventurous spirit, we sought out our nocturnal couches in the small hours of the morning. And then it was, here at my door, as we took our leave of one another, that the inspiration came to me to invite you to place your lips upon the brow of the lady who had introduced you to me as a good friend from her previous stay here, leaving it then to her to respond in my presence to such a solemn, yet cheerful token of the advanced hour. You rejected my proposal outright, rejected it because you found it nonsensical to exchange kisses on the brow with my traveling companion. You will surely not dispute that was your explanation, which itself would have demanded an explanation—an explanation which you still owe me to this day. Are you willing to pay that debt now?”"
"»Was Kuckuck, sind Sie schon fertig?« sagte Behrens. »Lassen Sie mal sehen; wahrhaftig, es stimmt. Gott, wie man alt wird. Geändert hat sich mit Ihnen ja nicht gerade viel unterdessen. Was, gestern war es normal? Ja, bis auf die 6-Uhr-Nachmittagsmessung. Na, Castorp, dann will ich ja auch nicht so sein und will Sie der menschlichen Sozietät zurückerstatten. Stehen Sie auf und wandeln Sie, Mann! In den gegebenen Grenzen und Maßen natürlich. Wir machen nächstens Ihr Innenkonterfei. Vormerken!« sagte er im Hinausgehen zu Dr. Krokowski, indem er mit seinem riesigen Daumen über die Schulter auf Hans Castorp deutete und den bleichen Assistenten mit seinen blutigen, tränenden blauen Augen ansah … Hans Castorp verließ die »Remise«.","""What the heck, are you done yet?"" said Behrens. 'Let's see; truly it is true. God how you get old. Not much has changed with you in the meantime. What, yesterday was normal? Yes, except for the 6 p.m. measurement. Well, Castorp, then I don't want to be like that either and I want to put you back to human society. Get up and walk, man! Within the given limits and dimensions, of course. We'll do your interior portrait soon. Make a note of it!” he said to Dr. Krokowski, pointing at Hans Castorp over his shoulder with his huge thumb and looking at the pale assistant with his bloody, tearing blue eyes... Hans Castorp left the ""Remise"".","“What the deuce—you don’t say!” said Behrens. “Time’s up, is it? Let’s see: yes, you’re right— good Lord, how fast we grow old! Things haven’t changed much with you, in the mean time. Normal yesterday? Yes, up to six o’clock in the afternoon. Well, Castorp, I won’t grudge you human society any longer. Up with you, man, and get on with your walks—within the prescribed limits, of course. We’ll take a picture of the inside of you—make a note of it,” he said as he went out, jerking his great thumb over his shoulder at Hans Castorp, and looking at the pallid assistant with his bloodshot, watery blue eyes. Hans Castorp left the “caboose.”","“What the—is your time up already?” Behrens said. “Let me think. I do declare, it’s true. Good God, how quickly we do get old. Not that your condition has changed all that much in the meantime. What? It was normal yesterday? Yes, except for the measurement at six in the evening. Well, Castorp, I don’t want to be like that, and so I’ll return you to human society. Arise, go thy way, my good man. Within the prescribed borders and limits, of course. We shall do a portrait of your interior here shortly. Make a note of that,” he said to Dr. Krokowski as they departed, pointing over his shoulder with a giant thumb at Hans Castorp and training his watery, bloodshot, blue eyes on his pallid assistant. And so Hans Castorp left the “stall.”"
"»Ja, ich muß gestehen, es ist das erste, was ich über diese … diese Anstrengungen höre.«","""Yes, I must confess, it's the first thing I've heard about this . . . effort.""","“Yes, I confess this is the first time I have heard of these—these endeavours.” “Ah,” Settembrini murmured, “ah, if you had only heard of them earlier!","“Yes, I must admit this is the first time I’ve heard about these . . . these efforts.”"
"»Ich sehe, Sie fangen an, zu begreifen«, sagte er. »In der Tat, dazu halte ich ihn mir«, fuhr er leichthin fort, nachdem er trotz der überstandenen Lungenentzündung eine Menge Rauch eingezogen und wieder von sich geblasen hatte. »Ich halte ihn in Bereitschaft für den Tag, wo mir dieser Trödel hier zu langweilig wird und wo ich die Ehre haben werde, mich ergebenst zu empfehlen. Die Sache ist ziemlich einfach … Ich habe einiges Studium darauf verwandt und bin mit mir im reinen darüber, wie sie am besten zu deichseln ist.« (Bei dem Worte »deichseln« ertönte ein Schrei.) »Die Herzpartie scheidet aus … Der Ansatz ist mir da nicht recht bequem … Auch ziehe ich es vor, das Bewußtsein an Ort und Stelle auszulöschen, nämlich indem ich mir so einen hübschen kleinen Fremdkörper in dieses interessante Organ appliziere …« Und Herr Albin deutete mit dem Zeigefinger auf seinen kurzgeschorenen Blondschädel. »Man muß hier ansetzen –« Herr Albin zog den vernickelten Revolver wieder aus der Tasche und klopfte mit der {124}Mündung an seine Schläfe – »hier oberhalb der Schlagader … Sogar ohne Spiegel ist es eine glatte Sache …«","""I see you're beginning to get it,"" he said. ""Indeed, that's what I keep it for,"" he went on lightly, having inhaled and blown a lot of smoke despite surviving pneumonia. 'I'll keep him in readiness for the day when I get bored with this junk and have the honor of commending myself. It's pretty simple... I've done some study on it and I'm clear on the best way to draw it."" (There was a scream at the word draw.) ""The heart part is out... The approach is I'm not very comfortable there... I also prefer to snuff out consciousness on the spot, by inserting a nice little foreign body into this interesting organ...' And Herr Albin pointed with his forefinger at his close-cropped blond head. ""You have to start here -"" Herr Albin pulled the nickel-plated revolver out of his pocket and tapped the muzzle on his temple - ""here above the artery... Even without a mirror it's a smooth affair...""","“I see you begin to understand,” he said. “In fact, you are right, that is what I keep it for,” he went on airily, inhaling, despite the recent inflammation of the lungs, a mass of smoke and breathing it slowly out again. “I keep it in readiness for the day when I can’t stand this farce any longer, and do myself the honour to bid you a respectful adieu. It is all very simple. I’ve given the matter some study, and I know precisely how to do it.” Another screech at the word. “I eliminate the region of the heart, the aim is not very convenient there. I prefer to annihilate my consciousness at its very centre by introducing my charming little foreign body direct into this interesting organ. ”—Herr Albin indicated with his index finger a spot on his close-cropped blond pate. “You aim here”—he drew the nickel-plated revolver out of his pocket once more and tapped with the barrel against his skull—“just here, above the artery; even without a mirror the thing is simple—”","“I see you’re beginning to understand,” he said. “And in fact, that is why I keep it handy,” he went on lightly, after first inhaling and then exhaling a great quantity of smoke, despite his recent bout with pneumonia. “I keep it at the ready for the day when all this malarkey here gets too boring and I shall have the honor of paying my final regards. It really is very simple. I’ve studied the matter at some length, and I have a very clear idea about how best to pull it off.” (Another shriek in response to the words “pull it off.”) “The region of the heart is out of the question—it’s rather awkward to aim there. And besides, I prefer snuffing out the conscious mind on the spot, and can do so by applying one of these pretty little foreign objects to this interesting organ . . .” And Herr Albin pointed with his index finger to his close-cropped blond head. “One aims here”—Herr Albin pulled the nickel-plated revolver from his pocket again and tapped the barrel against one temple—“here, just above the artery. Slick as a whistle, even without a mirror.”"

"Hinter ihr, als die Tür sich geöffnet hatte, war es viel dunkler gewesen als auf dem weißen Korridor: die klinische Helligkeit dieser unteren Räume reichte offenbar nicht bis dorthinein; verhülltes Halblicht, tiefe Dämmerung herrschte, wie Hans Castorp bemerkte, in Dr. Krokowskis analytischem Kabinett.","Behind her, when the door had opened, it had been much darker than the white corridor: the clinical brightness of these lower rooms evidently did not reach there; veiled semi-light, deep twilight reigned, as Hans Castorp remarked, in Dr. Krokowski's analytical cabinet.","Behind her, when she opened the office door, it had been much darker than in the white corridor.

"»Was Sie nicht sagen. Und die abendländische Mystik? Und der Quietismus, der Fénelon zu den Seinen zählen darf, und der lehrte, daß jedes Handeln fehlerhaft sei, da tätig sein zu wollen, Gott beleidigen heiße, der allein handeln wolle?

And the occidental mysticism? And the quietism that Fénelon is allowed to count among his own, and that taught that every action is wrong, since wanting to act is to offend God, who wants to act alone? I quote Molinos' propositions. It seems, however, that the spiritual possibility of finding salvation in peace is universal in human existence.”","“Oh, indeed! And what about Western mysticism—and what about quietism, a religion that numbers Fénelon among its disciples? Fénelon taught that every action is faulty, since every will to act is an insult to God, who wills to act alone. I cite the propositions of Molinos. There is no doubt that the spiritual possibility of finding salvation in repose has been disseminated pretty generally all over the world.”","“You don’t say. And Western mysticism? And quietism? Among whose adherents one may include Fenelon, who taught that every act is flawed, since the will to act is an affront to God, who alone can will to act. I need only mention Molinos’s propositions.

"»Ja, ja!« sagte Hans Castorp schwergemut und dankbar und {984}legte auch noch das Finale ein, wo alle den jungen José dazu beglückwünschten, daß ihm durch das Renkontre mit dem Offizier der Rückweg abgeschnitten war, so daß er nun fahnenflüchtig werden mußte, wie Carmen es zu seinem Entsetzen schon vorher von ihm verlangt hatte.","""Yes, yes!"" said Hans Castorp, sadly and gratefully, and {984}also put in the finale, where everyone congratulated young José on the fact that the renkontre with the officer cut off his way back, so that he is now deserting had to do, as Carmen, to his horror, had asked him to do beforehand.","“Yes, ah, yes,” said Hans Castorp, with mournful satisfaction, and put on the finale: where they are all congratulating young José because the meeting with the officer has cut off his retreat, and now it only remains open to him to desert, as Carmen, to his horror, had before now demanded he should.","“Yes, yes,” Hans Castorp said in somber gratitude, and put on the finale, where everyone congratulated young José for standing up to his officer and thus cutting off his retreat, so that he would now have to desert the colors, just as Carmen had demanded, to his horror, only moments before."
"Gleich nach dem Abgange des Chefs setzte man sich an die Spieltische. Die russische Gesellschaft bezog, wie immer, den kleinen Salon. Einige Gäste umstanden im Saale den Weihnachtsbaum, sahen dem Erlöschen der Lichtstümpfchen in ihren kleinen Metallhülsen zu und naschten von dem Aufgehängten. An den Tischen, die schon für das erste Frühstück gedeckt waren, saßen vereinzelte Personen, weit voneinander entfernt, verschiedentlich aufgestützt, in getrenntem Schweigen.","As soon as the boss left, everyone sat down at the gaming tables. As always, the Russian company moved into the small salon. A few guests stood around the Christmas tree in the hall, watched the stumps of light go out in their little metal cases and nibbled on the ones hanging. At the tables, which had already been set for the first breakfast, a few people sat far apart, propping themselves up on various occasions, in separate silence.","Directly the head went out, the guests sat down to cards, the Russians occupying, as usual, the small salon. Some of the patients still stood about the room where the Christmas-tree was, watching the candle stumps die down in their sockets, and munching the goodies hanging from the boughs. Here and there at the tables, which were already laid for breakfast, sat a solitary person, with his head on his hand, silently brooding.","No sooner had the director departed than people sat down at the card tables. The Russian group withdrew, as usual, to their little salon. A few guests stood around the dining hall Christmas tree, nibbling at the ornaments and watching the stubs of candles flicker out in their little metal jackets.

"Damals war er zwanzigjährig, und drei Jahre später hatte unter dem Einfluß eines ihm gefährlichen Klimas und geistiger Anstrengungen sein ererbtes Leiden solche Fortschritte gemacht, daß sein Verbleib sich bei Lebensgefahr verbot. Ein Blutsturz, den er erlitt, alarmierte seine Oberen, und nachdem er wochenlang zwischen Leben und Tod geschwebt, schickten sie den notdürftig Genesenen an seinen Ausgangspunkt zurück. In derselben Erziehungsanstalt, deren Schüler er gewesen, fand er als Präfekt, als Aufseher der Alumnen und Lehrer der Humaniora und Philosophie Verwendung. Diese Ein{673}schaltung war ohnedies Vorschrift, nur, daß man von solcher Dienstleistung gemeinhin nach wenigen Jahren ins Kolleg zurückkehrte, um das siebenjährige Gottesstudium fortzuführen und abzuschließen. Dies war dem Bruder Naphta verwehrt. Er kränkelte fort; Arzt und Obere urteilten, der Dienst hier am Orte, in gesunder Luft mit den Zöglingen und bei landwirtschaftlicher Betätigung, sei der ihm vorläufig angemessene. Er empfing wohl die erste höhere Weihe, gewann das Recht, am Sonntag beim feierlichen Amt die Epistel zu singen, – ein Recht, das er übrigens nicht ausübte, erstens, weil er vollständig unmusikalisch war und dann auch, weil die krankhafte Brüchigkeit seiner Stimme ihn zum Singen wenig geschickt machte. Über das Subdiakonat aber brachte er es nicht hinaus, – weder zum Diakonat noch gar zur Priesterweihe; und da die Blutung sich wiederholte, auch das Fieber nicht schwinden wollte, so hatte er auf Ordenskosten zu längerer Kur hier oben Aufenthalt genommen, und sie zog sich hin in das sechste Jahr – kaum noch als Kur, sondern bereits und nachgerade im Sinne kategorischer Lebensbedingung, in dünner Höhe, beschönigt durch einige Tätigkeit als Lateinlehrer am Krankengymnasium …","He was then twenty years old, and three years later, under the influence of a dangerous climate and mental exertion, his inherited disease had progressed to such an extent that he could not remain in life if his life was in danger. A hemorrhage he suffered alarmed his superiors, and after he had been hovering between life and death for weeks, they sent the barely recovered man back to his starting point. In the same educational institution where he had been a student, he found employment as prefect, as supervisor of the students and teacher of Humaniora and philosophy. In any case, this involvement was the rule, except that one generally returned to the college after a few years of such service in order to continue and complete the seven-year study of God. This was forbidden to Brother Naphta. He continued to get sick; The doctor and superiors judged that the service here on site, in the healthy air with the pupils and with agricultural work, was the right one for the time being. He probably received his first higher ordination, won the right to sing the epistle on Sunday at the solemn office - a right which he did not exercise, firstly because he was completely unmusical and secondly because the pathological fragility of his voice made him little adept at singing. But he did not make it beyond the subdiaconate – neither to the diaconate nor even to the priestly ordination; and since the bleeding kept coming and the fever didn’t want to go away either, he had stayed up here for a longer cure at the Order’s expense, and it lasted into the sixth year – hardly as a cure, but already and almost in the sense of a categorical condition of life , in a thin height, glossed over by some work as a Latin teacher at the sick school ...","He was then twenty years old. At the end of three years, the unfavourable climate and the continued mental strain had so combined to aggravate his hereditary complaint that a longer stay would have endangered his life. His superiors were alarmed by a hæmorrhage; he hovered for weeks between life and death, when they hurried him, barely convalescent, back whence he had come. In the institution where he had been a pupil he found occupation as prefect and supervisor of the boarders, and teacher of the humanities and philosophy. Such an interval was in any case prescribed for the students of the Society; but it usually lasted only a few years, after which one returned to the college to take up again the seven years’ course of study and carry it to its conclusion. This, however, it was not granted Brother Naphta to do. He continued ailing; doctor and superior decided that it was best for him to serve his order here among the pupils, in the good country air, with plenty of outdoor occupation on the farm. He took indeed the first of the higher orders, and won therewith the right to chant the Epistle on Sundays at mass—a right, however, which he never exercised, first because he was entirely unmusical, and second because of his weak chest, which made his voice break and unfitted it for singing. He never got further than being subdeacon—not even to diaconate, much less to priesthood. The hæmorrhages recurred, the fever persisted, and he had finally come to the mountains for an extended cure at the Society’s expense. This was now in its sixth year, and gradually coming to be no longer so much a cure as a fixed condition of existence, a residence for life in rarefied atmosphere, coloured by some activity as Latin master in the Davos gymnasium for slightly tubercular boys.","He was twenty years old at the time, and three years later, thanks to a deleterious climate and intellectual exertion, his inherited illness had advanced to the point where a further stay would have been fatal. A sudden hemorrhage alerted his superiors to the problem; after hovering for weeks between life and death and still in precarious health, he was sent back to where he started. He returned to the institution where he had been a pupil and was given a position as prefect, a supervisor of the students, a teacher of philosophy and humanities. This hiatus was prescribed by regulation in any case—except that one normally returned to college after a few years in order to conclude the seven-year course of instruction. This was now denied to Brother Naphta. His illness continued; his doctor and father superior decided it would be more appropriate for him temporarily to serve pupils where the air was healthy and outdoor farm work available. He received the first of the major orders, which gave him the right to chant the Epistle at solemn mass on Sunday—a right, however, which he never exercised, first because he was completely unmusical and second because illness had left his voice cracked and hardly suitable for singing. He did not advance beyond the subdiaconate—was never ordained deacon or priest. But when both hemorrhages and fever persisted, he had come up here for a long-term cure, which was paid for by his order and was now into its sixth year—hardly a cure by now and more a kind of categorical form of life at rarefied heights, mitigated by his duties as a teacher of Latin at the local school for tubercular boys."
"Die »Verwaltung« befand sich zu ebener Erde: wenn man, jenseits der Halle, an der Garderobe und den Küchen- und Anrichteräumen vorüber den Flurgang verfolgte, konnte man die Tür nicht verfehlen, zumal sie durch ein Porzellanschild ausgezeichnet war. Hans Castorp gewann dort mit Interesse einen gewissen Einblick in das kaufmännische Zentrum des Anstaltsbetriebes. Es war ein richtiges kleines Kontor: ein {201}Schreibmaschinenfräulein war tätig, und drei männliche Angestellte saßen über Pulte gebückt, während im anstoßenden Raum ein Herr von dem höheren Ansehen eines Chefs oder Direktors an einem frei stehenden Zylinderbureau arbeitete und nur über sein Augenglas hinweg einen kalten und sachlich musternden Blick auf die Klienten warf. Während man sie am Schalter abfertigte, einen Schein wechselte, kassierte, quittierte, bewahrten sie eine ernst-bescheidene, schweigsame, ja botmäßige Haltung, wie junge Deutsche, die die Achtung vor der Behörde, der Amtsstube auf jedes Schreib- und Dienstlokal übertragen; aber draußen, auf dem Wege zum Frühstück und später im Laufe des Tages plauderten sie einiges über die Verfassung des Berghof-Instituts, wobei Joachim als der Eingesessene und Kundige die Fragen seines Vetters beantwortete.","The ""administration"" was on the ground floor: if you followed the corridor beyond the hall, past the cloakroom and the kitchen and pantry, you could not miss the door, especially since it was marked by a porcelain sign. Hans Castorp was interested in gaining a certain insight into the commercial center of the institution. It was a real little office: a typist was at work, and three male clerks sat hunched over desks, while in the adjoining room a gentleman of the higher standing of a boss or director worked at a free-standing cylinder office and only over his eyeglass cast a cold and matter-of-fact look at the clients. While they were checked in at the counter, changing bills, cashing in, receipting, they maintained a serious, modest, silent, even obedient attitude, like young Germans who transfer respect for the authorities, the office, to every office and office; but outside, on the way to breakfast and later during the day, they chatted a bit about the condition of the Berghof Institute, with Joachim, as the established and knowledgeable one, answering his cousin's questions.","The management was on the ground-floor. You reached it after passing the hall, the garderobe, the kitchens and domestic offices; you could not miss the door, it had a porcelain shield. Hans Castorp took an interest in this glimpse into the business side of the enterprise. There was a neat little office, with a typist busy at her machine and three clerks bending over desks. In an adjoining office a man who looked like a head or director was working at a desk in the middle of the room; he flung a cool and calculating glance at the clients over the top of his glasses. Their affair was dispatched at the cashier’s window, a note changed, money received, the bill receipted; the cousins preserving throughout these transactions the solemn, discreet, almost overawed bearing which the young German’s respect for authority leads him to assume in the presence of pens, ink, and paper, or anything else which bears to his mind an official stamp. But on the way to breakfast, and later in the course of the day, they talked about the direction of the Berghof sanatorium, and Joachim, in his character as inmate, answered his cousin’s questions.","“Management” was on the ground floor: after crossing the lobby and following the hallway past the cloakroom, kitchen, and housekeeping, you could not miss it, especially given the porcelain sign on the door. Hans Castorp’s interest was aroused by the glimpse it offered him into the business side of the establishment. It was a normal, small office where a woman was busy at a typewriter, and three male employees stood bent over lecterns, while in the adjoining room a gentleman with the imposing look of a department head or manager sat working at a freestanding, barrel-like desk and cast his clients a glance just over the top of his glasses, measuring them with cold, practical eyes. While their business was being taken care of—payment made with a large bill, change returned, a receipt written out—they both took on that serious, modest, silent, even subservient look by which young Germans show that their respect for authority applies to all offices, to any room where records are kept and services rendered; but once they were outside and were heading off to breakfast—and later on that day, too—they chatted about the general setup of the Berghof, with Joachim, as the older, more knowledgeable resident, answering his cousin’s questions."

First you distinguish, and then you equate. That's gibberish...""","“Well, and—?” he asked. “I thought it was different with you. It seems to me you are contradicting yourself; first you say our cases are different; then you say they are alike. That seems sheer twaddle to me.”","“So what?” he asked. “I thought yours was an entirely different problem, was it not? It seems to me you’re getting tangled up in contradictions. First you differentiate the two cases, then equate them. That’s just twiddle-twaddle.”"
"{582}»Der Kleine? Nicht gut. Er sagte manches, was mir gefiel. Schiedsgerichte sind natürlich eine Duckmäuserei. Aber er selbst hat mir wenig gefallen, und da kann einer noch so viel Gutes sagen, was habe ich davon, wenn er selbst ein zweifelhafter Kerl ist. Und zweifelhaft ist er, das kannst du nicht leugnen. Allein schon die Geschichte mit dem ›Orte der Beiwohnung‹ war entschieden bedenklich. Und dabei hat er ja eine Judennase, sieh ihn dir doch an! So miekrig von Figur sind auch immer nur die Semiten. Hast du denn ernstlich vor, den Mann zu besuchen?«","{582}""The little one? Not good. He said some things I liked. Arbitration courts are of course a cowardice. But I didn't like him much himself, and no matter how good a man can say, what's in it for me if he's a dubious fellow himself. And doubtful he is, you can't deny that. The story of the 'places of congregation' alone was decidedly dubious. And he has a Jew nose, look at him! Only the Semites are ever so miserable in shape. Do you seriously intend to visit the man?”","“Who? The little man? Not very much. Though he said some things I liked. That about courts of arbitration—they are nothing but canting hypocrisy, of course. But I did not care much for the man himself—a person may say as many good things as he likes, it doesn’t matter to me, if he himself is a queer fish. And queer he is, you can’t deny it. That stuff about the ‘place of intercourse’ was distinctly shady, not to mention anything else. And did you see the big Jewish nose he had? Nobody but Jews have such puny figures. Are you really thinking of visiting the man?”","“The little fellow? Not very well. I liked some things he said. Courts of arbitration are goody-goody nonsense, of course. But I didn’t think that much of him. A fellow can say all sorts of fine things—but what good is that, if he’s a dubious character? And there is something dubious about him, you can’t deny it. His story about the ‘place of cohabitation’ was definitely suspect. And that nose is Jewish, too—take a good look at him. And only Semites are such puny physical specimens. Do you seriously intend to visit the man?”"

"Sie sah; und an ihrer Seite sah Hans Castorp. Bis zu diesem Augenblick waren ihm die Veränderungen, die sich in den letzten Wochen an Joachim vollzogen hatten, gar nicht so bemerklich geworden, – junge Leute haben ja nicht viel Blick für solche Dinge. Jetzt aber, neben der von außen kommenden Mutter, betrachtete er ihn gleichsam mit ihren Augen, als hätte er ihn lange nicht gesehen, und erkannte klar und deutlich, was zweifellos auch sie erkannte, was aber ganz gewiß am besten von allen dreien Joachim selber wußte, nämlich, daß er ein Moribundus war. Er hielt Frau Ziemßens Hand in der seinen, die ebenso gelb und abgezehrt war, wie sein Gesicht, von welchem, eben infolge der Abmagerung, seine Ohren, dieser leichte Kummer seiner guten Jahre, stärker als ehedem und in bedauerlich entstellendem Maße abstanden, das aber bis auf diesen Fehler und trotz seiner durch den Stempel des Leidens und durch den Ausdruck von Ernst und Strenge, ja Stolz, den es trug, eher noch männlich verschönt erschien, – obgleich seine Lippen mit dem schwarzen Bärtchen darüber jetzt gar zu voll {806}wirkten gegen die schattigen Wangenhöhlen. Zwei Falten hatten sich in die gelbliche Haut seiner Stirn zwischen den Augen eingegraben, die, obgleich tief in knochigen Höhlen liegend, schöner und größer waren als je, und an denen Hans Castorp sich freuen mochte. Denn alle Störung, Trübung und Unsicherheit war, seit Joachim lag, daraus geschwunden, und nur jenes früh bemerkte Licht war in ihrer ruhigen, dunklen Tiefe zu sehen – und freilich auch jene »Drohung«. Er lächelte nicht, während er die Hand seiner Mutter hielt und ihr flüsternd Guten Tag und Willkommen sagte. Auch bei ihrem Eintritt hatte er nicht einen Augenblick gelächelt, und diese Unbeweglichkeit, Unveränderlichkeit seiner Miene sagte alles.","She saw; and at her side saw Hans Castorp. Up to this point he hadn't really noticed the changes that had taken place in Joachim over the past few weeks - young people don't see things like that very much. But now, next to his mother, who was coming from outside, he looked at him with her eyes, as it were, as if he hadn't seen him for a long time, and recognized clearly what she doubtless also recognized, but what Joachim himself knew best of all three , namely that he was a moribundus. He held Frau Ziemssen's hand in his, which was just as yellow and emaciated as his face, from which, precisely because of his emaciation, his ears, this slight sorrow of his good years, protruded more than before and to a regrettable disfiguring extent, but that apart from this error and despite it, it still appeared manly beautified by the stamp of suffering and by the expression of seriousness and severity, yes pride it wore - although its lips with the little black beard above it are now too full {806} worked against the shadowy cavities of the cheeks. Two wrinkles had dug themselves into the yellowish skin of his forehead between his eyes, which, although set deep in bony sockets, were larger and more beautiful than ever, and Hans Castorp might have been pleased about them. For all disturbance, cloudiness and uncertainty had disappeared from it since Joachim lay there, and only that light, noticed early on, could be seen in its quiet, dark depths - and of course that ""threat"" too. He didn't smile as he held his mother's hand and whispered hello and welcome to her. Even when she entered he hadn't smiled for a moment, and the immobility, unchangeability of his expression said everything.","She saw; and beside her, Hans Castorp saw too. Up to that moment he had not been fully aware of the changes the last weeks had made in Joachim—the young have not much eye for such things. But now he looked with the eyes of the newly arrived mother, as though he had not seen Joachim for weeks; and realized clearly and distinctly, as doubtless she did too, and beyond a doubt Joachim himself clearest of all, that he was a moribundus. He took Frau Ziemssen’s hand and held it—his own was as yellow and wasted as his face. And his ears, because of the emaciation, stood out almost disfiguringly. Yet despite this blemish, the one affliction of his young days, and despite the austere expression illness set upon his features, their manly beauty seemed intensified—the lips, perhaps, beneath the small black moustache, looked a shade too full by contrast with the hollow cheek. Two lengthwise folds had graven themselves in the yellow surface of his brow; his eyes, deep in their bony sockets, were larger and more beautiful than ever, Hans Castorp never tired of looking at them. For all the distressed and wavering look was gone, now Joachim lay in bed; there was only that earlier light in their dark, quiet depths—yes, there was the “ominous” look as well. He did not smile, he took his mother’s hand and whispered her a welcome. He had not even smiled on her entrance; and this immobility of his mien said all.","She saw, and at her side, Hans Castorp saw, too. Until that moment the changes that Joachim had undergone in the last weeks had not been so noticeable—young people do not have much of an eye for such things. But now, standing beside the mother who had rushed here from elsewhere, he looked at his cousin with her eyes, as it were, as if he had not seen him for a long time, and saw clearly and distinctly what she doubtless also recognized and Joachim certainly knew better than either of them: that he was a moribundus. Joachim grasped Frau Ziemssen’s hand with hands that were as yellow and wasted as his emaciated face, from which his ears, the one minor sorrow of his youth, stuck out more than ever; but despite that regrettable disfigurement, suffering had stamped his face with an expression of austere earnestness, even pride, and he still looked very manly—although the lips beneath his dark little moustache seemed too full now against the shadows of his hollow cheeks. Two deep creases were engraved in the yellowish skin between his eyes, which although they had sunk deep into their bony sockets, were larger and more beautiful than ever. Hans Castorp took comfort in that, because all the worry, gloom, and unsteadiness had vanished from them now that his cousin was bedfast, and only the light he had noticed early on was visible in their calm, dark—and, to be sure, ominous—depths. Joachim did not smile as he held his mother’s hand and whispered his welcome. He had not even smiled when she first entered the room; and that immobility, that immutability in his expression said everything."
"»Gut,« sagte Joachim, »dann ist es wohl auch bloß Konvention, daß ich hier vier Striche zuviel habe auf meinem Thermometer! Aber wegen dieser fünf Striche muß ich mich hier herumräkeln und kann nicht Dienst machen, das ist eine ekelhafte Tatsache!«","'Good,' said Joachim, 'then it's just a matter of convention that I have four lines too many on my thermometer! But because of those five dashes I have to loll about here and not be on duty, that's a disgusting fact!'","“Good,” Joachim said. “Then perhaps it is pure convention that I have five points too much here on my thermometer. But on account of those lines I have to drool about here instead of joining up, which is a disgusting fact.”","“Fine,” Joachim said, “ then it’s probably also just a convention that my thermometer has risen four and a half lines above normal. And because of those four little lines I have to loaf around here and can’t go on active duty—and that’s a disgusting fact all to itself.”"
"Was war das Leben? Man wußte es nicht. Es war sich seiner bewußt, unzweifelhaft, sobald es Leben war, aber es wußte nicht, was es sei. Bewußtsein als Reizempfindlichkeit, unzweifelhaft, erwachte bis zu einem gewissen Grade schon auf den niedrigsten, ungebildetsten Stufen seines Vorkommens, es war unmöglich, das erste Auftreten bewußter Vorgänge an irgendeinen Punkt seiner allgemeinen oder individuellen Geschichte zu binden, Bewußtsein etwa durch das Vorhandensein eines Nervensystems zu bedingen. Die niedersten Tierformen hatten kein Nervensystem, geschweige daß sie ein Großhirn gehabt hätten, doch wagte es niemand, ihnen die Fähigkeit der Empfindung von Reizen abzusprechen. Auch konnte man das Leben betäuben, dieses selbst, nicht nur besondere Organe der Reizempfänglichkeit, die es etwa ausbildete, nicht nur die Nerven. Man konnte die Reizbarkeit jedes mit Leben begabten Stoffes im Pflanzen- wie im Tierreich vorübergehend aufheben, konnte Eier und Samenfäden mit Chloroform, Chloralhydrat oder Morphium narkotisieren. Bewußtsein seinerselbst war also schlechthin eine Funktion der zum Leben geordneten Materie, und bei höherer Verstärkung wandte die Funktion sich gegen ihren eigenen Träger, ward zum Trachten nach Ergründung und Erklärung des Phänomens, das sie zeitigte, einem hoffnungsvoll-hoffnungslosen Trachten des Lebens nach Selbsterkenntnis, einem Sich-in-sich-Wühlen der Natur, vergeblich am Ende, da Natur in Erkenntnis nicht aufgehen, Leben im Letzten sich nicht belauschen kann.","what was life You didn't know. It was aware of it, no doubt once it was life, but it didn't know what it was. Awareness as sensibility, no doubt, awoke to some degree even at the lowest, most illiterate stages of its occurrence, it was impossible to link the first appearance of conscious processes to any point in its general or individual history, such as consciousness by the existence of a nervous system condition. The lowest animal forms had no nervous system, let alone a cerebrum, but no one dared deny their ability to sense stimuli. One could also anaesthetize life, life itself, not just special organs of stimulus sensitivity that it might develop, not just the nerves. One could temporarily stop the irritability of every living substance in the plant and animal kingdoms, one could anesthetize eggs and seminal fibers with chloroform, chloral hydrate or morphine. Consciousness of oneself was therefore simply a function of the matter ordered to life, and with higher reinforcement the function turned against its own bearer, became a striving for investigation and explanation of the phenomenon that it produced, a hopeful-hopeless striving of life for self-knowledge, nature digging within itself, in vain in the end, since nature cannot be absorbed in knowledge, life cannot overhear itself in the ultimate.","What was life? No one knew. It was undoubtedly aware of itself, so soon as it was life; but it did not know what it was. Consciousness, as exhibited by susceptibility to stimulus, was undoubtedly, to a certain degree, present in the lowest, most undeveloped stages of life; it was impossible to fix the first appearance of conscious processes at any point in the history of the individual or the race; impossible to make consciousness contingent upon, say, the presence of a nervous system. The lowest animal forms had no nervous systems, still less a cerebrum; yet no one would venture to deny them the capacity for responding to stimuli. One could suspend life; not merely particular sense-organs, not only nervous reactions, but life itself. One could temporarily suspend the irritability to sensation of every form of living matter in the plant as well as in the animal kingdom; one could narcotize ova and spermatozoa with chloroform, chloral hydrate, or morphine. Consciousness, then, was simply a function of matter organized into life; a function that in higher manifestations turned upon its avatar and became an effort to explore and explain the phenomenon it displayed—a hopeful-hopeless project of life to achieve self-knowledge, nature in recoil—and vainly, in the event, since she cannot be resolved in knowledge, nor life, when all is said, listen to itself.","What was life? No one knew. It was aware of itself the moment it became life, that much was certain—and yet did not know what it was. Consciousness, as sensitivity to stimuli, was undoubtedly aroused to some extent at even the lowest, most undeveloped stages of its occurrence; it was impossible to tie the emergence of consciousness to any particular point in life’s general or individual history—to link it, for instance, to the presence of a nervous system. The lowest animals had no nervous systems, let alone a cerebral cortex, and yet no one dared deny that they were capable of responding to stimuli. And you could anesthetize life, life itself, not just the special organs capable of the response that informs life, not just the nerves. You could temporarily suspend the responses of every speck of living matter, in both the plant and animal kingdoms, narcotize eggs and sperm with chloroform, chloral hydrate, or morphine. Consciousness of self was an inherent function of matter once it was organized as life, and if that function was enhanced it turned against the organism that bore it, strove to fathom and explain the very phenomenon that produced it, a hope-filled and hopeless striving of life to comprehend itself, as if nature were rummaging to find itself in itself—ultimately to no avail, since nature cannot be reduced to comprehension, nor in the end can life listen to itself."
"Doktor Blumenkohl, dem es eben wieder sehr schlecht ging, murmelte mit jenem ihm eigentümlichen Gesichts- oder eigentlich Lippenausdruck etwas vor sich hin, woraus man entnehmen konnte, was das für Verse seien. Hans Castorp seinerseits meinte die Antwort nicht schuldig bleiben zu dürfen, fühlte sich scherzhaft verpflichtet, eine Replik auf den Zettel zu schreiben, die freilich nur höchst unbedeutend hätte ausfallen können. Er suchte in seinen Taschen nach einem Bleistift, fand aber keinen und konnte auch von Joachim und der Lehrerin keinen erhalten. Seine rot geäderten Augen gingen nach Aushilfe gen Osten, in den links-rückwärtigen Winkel des Saales, und man sah, wie sein flüchtiges Vorhaben in so weitläufigen Assoziationen ausartete, daß er erbleichte und seine Grundabsicht überhaupt vergaß.","Dr. Blumenkohl, who was feeling very bad again, murmured something to himself with that peculiar expression on his face or actually on his lips, from which one could infer what kind of verses those verses were. For his part, Hans Castorp said he shouldn't be left with the answer, jokingly felt obliged to write a reply on the note, which of course could only have been extremely insignificant. He looked in his pockets for a pencil, but couldn't find one and couldn't get one from Joachim and the teacher either. His red-veined eyes went east for help, to the left-rear corner of the hall, and you could see how his fleeting project degenerated into such extensive associations that he turned pale and forgot his basic intention altogether.","This was received with enthusiasm, though Dr. Blumenkohl, whose state had now much altered for the worse, muttered something to himself, with the expression peculiar to him upon his face, or rather upon his lips; he seemed to be asking what sort of verses were these. But Hans Castorp considered that an answer was due, he felt it incumbent on him to cap the quotation, though it was unlikely he would have produced anything very striking. He searched his pockets for a pencil, but found none, nor could Joachim or the schoolmistress supply his need; and his bloodshot eyes looked to the east for aid, to the farther left-hand corner of the room—it was plain that his fleeting purpose was dissipated in a widening circle of associations. He paled a little, and entirely lost sight of his original intention.","Dr. Blumenkohl, who had been doing very poorly again of late, muttered something to himself—with a look on his face, or better, about his lips, that was peculiarly his own—that indicated the source of these verses. For his part, Hans Castorp felt that he ought to reciprocate tit for tat, that he had to respond by writing a jocular note of his own, though it could have been only some very lightweight quotation. He searched his pockets for a pencil, but could not find one, and neither Joachim nor the teacher had one to lend him. His bloodshot eyes wandered eastward for help, to the far left-hand corner of the dining hall. And it was at once apparent that what had been a fleeting notion had dissipated into a wider circle of associations—he turned pale and completely forgot his original intention."

"Jedoch war er außer der Reihe und Zeit zu Radamanthys bestellt. Die Oberin hatte ihn angezeigt und wohl nicht einmal dumm daran getan; denn da ein Kehlkopfspiegel im Hause war, so schien diese hartnäckige Heiserkeit, die stundenweise in wirkliche Stimmlosigkeit ausartete, und auch dies Halsweh, das wieder hervortrat, sobald Joachim versäumte, seine Kehle durch speicheltreibende Mittel geschmeidig zu halten, ein hinlänglicher Anlaß, das klug erdachte Instrument einmal aus dem Schranke zu nehmen, – zu schweigen davon, daß, wenn Joachim sich jetzt mit normaler Seltenheit verschluckte, dies nur der großen Vorsicht zu danken war, die er beim Essen aufwandte, und die ihn bei den Mahlzeiten fast regelmäßig in Rückstand hielt.","However, he was out of turn and time ordered to Radamanthys. The mother superior had reported him and was probably not even stupid about it; for since there was a laryngeal mirror in the house, this stubborn hoarseness, which by the hour degenerated into real voicelessness, and also this sore throat, which reappeared as soon as Joachim neglected to keep his throat supple with salivating agents, seemed a sufficient reason that cleverly thought up To take the instrument out of the cupboard for once, - not to mention that if Joachim now choked with normal rarity, this was only due to the great care he took when eating, and which almost always kept him in arrears at meals .","But he was summoned out of his order to Rhadamanthus. The Oberin had so arranged it, probably with good sense; since there was a laryngeal mirror at hand, it was well to make use of that clever little device for the relief of the obstinate hoarseness or even total lack of voice from which he suffered for hours at a time, and the sore throat, which recurred whenever he omitted to keep his throat passages soft by various salivating medicaments. Not to mention, indeed, that though he choked as other people do, and no more frequently, this was only by dint of the very greatest care, which hindered him at his meals, and made him late in finishing.","All the same, he was summoned to Rhadamanthus out of turn. The head nurse had informed on him, which was really not all that foolish of her; there was a laryngoscope in the house, after all, and given Joachim’s stubborn hoarseness, which sometimes progressed to a total loss of voice for hours, and given his sore throat, which returned whenever he neglected to keep his throat moistened with medications that increased salivary flow, there seemed sufficient reason to take that ingenious instrument from the cupboard—not to mention the fact that although Joachim swallowed the wrong way with normal infrequency, he did so only because of the special care he took when eating, so that he was almost always slow to finish his meal."
"»Sie beklagen sich nicht?« fragte Peeperkorn und wandte ihm das Antlitz zu … Es schien fahl in der Dämmerung; die Augen blickten bleich und matt unter der idolhaften Stirnlineatur, der große, zerrissene Mund stand halb geöffnet wie bei einer tragischen Maske.","'You don't complain?' asked Peeperkorn, turning his face towards him... It seemed livid in the twilight; the eyes looked pale and dull under the idol-like forehead line, the large, torn mouth was half open as in a tragic mask.","“You don’t complain?” asked Peeperkorn, and turned his face. It seemed ashen in the twilight, the pale, weary eyes stared out beneath the great folds of brow, the large chapped lips stood half open, like the mouth of a tragic mask.","“And so you have no complaints?” Peeperkorn asked, turning his countenance to him now—it looked ashen in the twilight. The eyes gazed out pale and dull from under the idol-like tracery of the brow; the large, ragged lips hung half-open, like the mouth on the mask of tragedy."
»Ich möchte meinen verstorbenen Vetter Joachim Ziemßen sehen.«,»I would like to see my deceased cousin Joachim Ziemßen.«,"But the pause was too long; he turned his head toward their leader, and said, in a husky voice: “I should like to see my departed cousin, Joachim Ziemssen.”","But it all seemed to be taking too long, and so turning his head to address the leader of the session, he said with a husky voice, “I would like to see my dead cousin, Joachim Ziemssen.”"
"Es dauerte eine Woche, bis Hans Castorp durch die Oberin von Mylendonk ins Durchleuchtungslaboratorium bestellt wurde. Er mochte nicht drängen. Man war beschäftigt im Hause »Berghof«, offenbar hatten Ärzte und Personal alle Hände voll zu tun. Neue Gäste waren in den letzten Tagen angelangt: zwei russische Studenten mit dickem Haar und geschlossenen schwarzen Blusen, die keinen Schimmer von Wäsche sehen ließen; ein holländisches Ehepaar, dem an Settembrinis Tische Plätze angewiesen wurden; ein buckliger Mexikaner, der die Tischgesellschaft durch furchtbare Anfälle von Atemnot in Schrecken setzte: er klammerte sich dabei mit ehernem Griff seiner langen Hände an seine Nachbarn, ob Herr oder Dame, hielt fest wie ein Schraubstock und zog die entsetzt Widerstrebenden, um Hilfe Rufenden so in seine Ängste hinein. Kurzum, der Speisesaal war beinahe voll besetzt, obgleich die Wintersaison erst mit dem Oktober begann. Und die Schwere von Hans Castorps Fall, sein Krankheitsgrad, gab ihm kaum ein Recht, besonderen Anspruch auf Beachtung zu erheben. Frau Stöhr etwa war in all ihrer Dummheit und Unbildung ohne Zweifel viel kränker als er, von Dr. Blumenkohl ganz zu schweigen. Man hätte jedes Sinnes für Rangordnung und Abstand entbehren müssen, um in Hans Castorps Fall nicht bescheidene Zurückhaltung zu üben, – besonders da eine solche Gesinnung zum Geiste des Hauses gehörte. Leichtkranke galten nicht viel, er hatte es öfters aus den Gesprächen herausgehört. Man sprach mit Geringschätzung von ihnen, nach dem hierorts geltenden Maßstab, sie wurden über die Achsel angesehen, und zwar nicht allein von den Höher- und Hochgradigen, sondern auch von solchen, {311}die selbst nur »leicht« waren: womit diese freilich Geringschätzung auch ihrerselbst an den Tag legten, aber eine höhere Selbstachtung retteten, indem sie dem Maßstab sich unterwarfen. So ist es menschlich. »Ach, der!« konnten sie wohl voneinander sagen, »dem fehlt eigentlich nichts, kaum daß er das Recht hat, hier zu sein. Nicht mal eine Kaverne hat er …« Dies war der Geist; er war aristokratisch in seinem besonderen Sinn, und Hans Castorp salutierte ihn aus angeborener Achtung vor Gesetz und Ordnung jeder Art. Ländlich, sittlich, heißt es. Reisende zeigen sich wenig gebildet, wenn sie über die Sitten und Werte ihrer Wirtsvölker sich lustig machen, und der Eigenschaften, die Ehre schaffen, gibt es diese und jene. Sogar gegen Joachim selbst beobachtete Hans Castorp eine gewisse Ehrerbietung und Rücksicht, – nicht sowohl, weil dieser der länger Eingesessene war und sein Anleiter und Cicerone in dieser Welt –, sondern namentlich, weil er der zweifellos »Schwerere« war. Da aber alles so lag, war es begreiflich, daß man dazu neigte, aus seinem Falle das Mögliche zu machen und in Hinsicht auf ihn auch wohl zu übertreiben, um zur Aristokratie zu gehören oder ihr näher zu kommen. Auch Hans Castorp, wenn er bei Tische gefragt wurde, nannte wohl ein paar Striche mehr, als er in Wahrheit gemessen, und konnte unmöglich umhin, sich geschmeichelt zu fühlen, wenn man ihm mit dem Finger drohte, wie einem, der es faustdick hinter den Ohren hat. Aber auch, wenn er ein wenig auftrug, blieb er immer noch, eigentlich gesprochen, eine Person von geringen Graden, und so waren Geduld und Zurückhaltung denn sicherlich das ihm zukommende Betragen.","It was a week before Hans Castorp was summoned to the fluoroscopy laboratory by the matron of Mylendonk. He didn't like to push. People were busy in the ""Berghof"" house, and doctors and staff evidently had their hands full. New guests had arrived in the last few days: two Russian students with thick hair and closed black blouses that showed no sign of washing; a Dutch couple seated at Settembrini's tables; a hunchbacked Mexican who frightened the table company with terrible attacks of shortness of breath: he clung to his neighbors, whether gentleman or lady, with a brazen grip of his long hands, held tight like a vise and pulled the terrified reluctant ones who called for help like that into his fears. In short, the dining room was almost full, even though the winter season didn't start until October. And the seriousness of Hans Castorp's case, the degree of his illness, hardly gave him a right to claim special attention. Frau Stöhr, for example, in all her stupidity and lack of education, was without a doubt much sicker than he, from Dr. Not to mention cauliflower. One would have had to be without any sense of hierarchy and distance not to exercise modest restraint in Hans Castorp's case—especially since such an attitude was part of the spirit of the house. Slightly ill people didn't count for much, he'd heard it often from conversations. They were spoken of with contempt, according to the standards that applied here, they were looked down on, and not only by those of higher and higher rank, but also by those who themselves were only ""light"": with what these of course Showing contempt for themselves too, but salvaging a higher self-respect by submitting to the standard. That's human. 'Oh, that one!' they could probably say to each other, 'there's nothing wrong with him, hardly that he has the right to be here. He doesn't even have a cavern…” This was the spirit; he was aristocratic in his special sense, and Hans Castorp, out of innate respect for law and order of every kind, saluted him. Rural, moral, they say. Travelers show themselves uneducated when they ridicule the customs and values of their host peoples, and there are such and such qualities of qualities that bring honor. Even towards Joachim himself, Hans Castorp observed a certain deference and consideration - not so much because he was the longer resident and his guide and cicerone in this world - but especially because he was undoubtedly the ""heavier"" one. But since everything was like that, it was understandable that one tended to make the best of one's case and also to exaggerate in relation to it in order to belong to the aristocracy or to come closer to it. Even Hans Castorp, when asked at the table, probably named a few points more than he actually measured, and could not help but feel flattered when someone threatened him with a finger, like someone who was a sly old man has ears. But even if he applied a little, he still remained, actually speaking, a person of inferior rank, and so patience and restraint were certainly his due demeanor.","A WEEK passed before Hans Castorp received, through the Directress von Mylendonk, the summons to present himself in the x-ray laboratory. He had not liked to press matters. The Berghof was a busy place, doctors and assistants had their hands full. New guests had recently come in: two Russian students with shocks of hair and black blouses closed to the throat, showing not a vestige of linen; a Dutch married couple, who were given places at Settembrini’s table; and a hunch-backed Mexican, who frightened his table by fearful attacks of asthma, when he would clutch his neighbour, whether man or woman, in an iron grip like a vice, and draw him, as it were, struggling and crying for help, into the circle of his own extremity. The dining-room was nearly full, though the winter season did not actually begin until October. And Hans Castorp’s case was scarcely of such severity as to give him any special claim to attention. Frau Stöhr, for all her stupidity and ill breeding, was unquestionably worse off than he—not to mention Dr. Blumenkohl. One must have lacked all discrimination not to have behaved retiringly, in Hans Castorp’s place—particularly since discrimination was in the atmosphere of the house. The mild cases were of no great account, that he had often heard. They were slightingly spoken of, looked at askance, not only by the more serious and the very serious cases, but even by each other. Logically, of course, each mild case was thus driven to think slightingly of itself; yet preserved its individual self-respect by merging it with the general, as was natural and human. “Oh,” they would say, of this or that patient, “there’s not much amiss with him. He hardly even ought to be up here, he has no cavities at all.” Such was the spirit—it was aristocratic in its own special sense, and Hans Castorp deferred to it, out of an inborn respect for law and order of every sort. It was natural to him to conform to the proverb which bids us, when in Rome, do as the Romans do. And indeed travellers show small breeding when they jeer at the customs and standards of their hosts, for of characteristics that do honour to their possessors there are all sorts and kinds. Even toward Joachim Hans Castorp felt a certain deference—not so much because he was the older inhabitant, his guide and cicerone in these new surroundings, as because he was unquestionably the more serious case of the two. Such being the attitude, it was easy to understand that each patient inclined to make the most he could of his individual case, even exaggerating its seriousness, so as to belong to the aristocracy, or come as close to it as possible. So Hans Castorp, when asked at table, might add a couple of tenths to his temperature, and could never help feeling flattered when they shook their fingers at him and called him an artful dodger. But even when he laid it on a little, he still remained a member of the lower orders, in whom an attitude of unassuming diffidence was only right and proper.","A week passed before Hans Castorp received orders from Head Nurse Mylendonk to report to the X-ray laboratory. He had not wanted to press the matter. It was apparent that this was a busy time for the Berghof, that the doctors and staff had their hands full. New guests had arrived in the last few days: two Russian students, both with heads of thick hair and high-buttoned black blouses without a trace of collar or cuff; a Dutch married couple, who were assigned places at Settembrini’s table; a hunchbacked Mexican, who terrified his tablemates with horrible asthma attacks, when he suddenly could not get his breath and would then grab his neighbor, man or woman, in the iron grip of one of his long hands, hold on tight as a vise, and drag his struggling, panicky victim, now shouting for help, down into the pool of dread with him. In short, the dining hall was already as good as full, although the winter season did not begin until October. And Hans Castorp’s case was hardly severe enough, high enough on the scale of illness, for him to have any right to claim special treatment. For all her stupidity and ignorance, Frau Stöhr, for instance, was without doubt much more ill than he, not to mention Dr. Blumenkohl. One would have to lack all sense of decorum or hierarchy not to have exercised restraint in Hans Castorp’s case—particularly since such sensibilities were essential to the spirit of the house. People who were only slightly ill did not count for much—he had often overheard conversations to that effect. They were spoken of disparagingly and considered inferior by local standards, not only by those of higher or highest rank, but also by those who themselves were only “mildly ill”—which allowed them to shrug off their own cases; while at the same time, by subjecting themselves to such standards, they were able to preserve and enhance their own self-esteem. Which is only human. “Oh, him,” they might say about one another, “there’s really not much wrong with him, hardly has the right to be here. Doesn’t even have a cavity.” Such was the spirit of the place—aristocratic in its own special way; and Hans Castorp greeted it out of an inborn respect for law and order of every sort. When in Rome, as the saying goes. Travelers prove their lack of education if they make fun of the customs and values of their hosts, and the qualities that do a person honor are many and varied. Hans Castorp even showed a certain regard and consideration for Joachim—not so much because he was an old-timer here and had served as his guide and cicerone in this world, but more particularly because there was no doubt that he was “seriously ill.” But since this was how things were, it was only understandable if someone made as much of his case as possible, even exaggerated a little to be part of the aristocracy or at least get closer to it. Whenever his tablemates asked about his temperature, Hans Castorp, too, would add a few tenths, and he found it impossible not to feel flattered when they shook their fingers at him as if he were a particularly sly rascal. But even if he laid it on a little thick, he was still low on the ladder, as it were, and so patience and reticence were certainly appropriate behavior."
"»Erzählen Sie uns doch noch etwas von der Haut,« bat er, »wenn Sie so freundlich sein wollen, Herr Hofrat!« Er hatte Frau Chauchats Porträt wieder an sich genommen, hatte es auf sein Knie gestellt und betrachtete es, in den Stuhl zurückgelehnt, die Zigarette zwischen den Lippen. »Nicht gerade von der Fetthaut, das wissen wir ja nun, was es damit auf sich hat. Aber von der menschlichen Haut im allgemeinen, die Sie so gut zu malen verstehn.«","""Tell us something more about the skin,"" he begged, ""if you'd be so kind, Herr Hofrat!"" He had taken Frau Chauchat's portrait back, put it on his knee and looked at it from the chair leaning back, cigarette between his lips. “Not exactly from the fatty skin, we now know what that's all about. But of human skin in general, which you paint so well.”","“Tell us some more about the skin,” he begged the Hofrat; “that is, if you will be so kind.” He had taken Frau Chauchat’s portrait on his knee, and was gazing at it, leaning back in his chair, the cigarette between his lips. “Not about the fat-layer, we know about that now. About the human skin in general, that you know so well how to paint.”","“If you would be so kind, Director Behrens,” he requested, “do tell us something more about skin.” He had picked up Frau Chauchat’s portrait again, balancing it on one knee. Leaning back in his chair, the cigarette between his lips, he regarded it now. “Not specifically about the fatty layer—we’ve learned what that’s about. But about human skin in general, since you’re so good at painting it.”"

"»Sie scheinen überrascht, mich zu sehen, Herr Castorp,« hatte er mit baritonaler Milde, schleppend, unbedingt etwas geziert und mit einem exotischen Gaumen-r gesprochen, das er {291}jedoch nicht rollte, sondern durch ein nur einmaliges Anschlagen der Zunge gleich hinter den oberen Vorderzähnen erzeugte; »ich erfülle aber lediglich eine angenehme Pflicht, wenn ich bei Ihnen nun auch nach dem Rechten sehe. Ihr Verhältnis zu uns ist in eine neue Phase getreten, über Nacht ist aus dem Gaste ein Kamerad geworden …« (Das Wort »Kamerad« hatte Hans Castorp etwas geängstigt.) »Wer hätte es gedacht!« hatte Dr. Krokowski kameradschaftlich gescherzt … »Wer hätte es gedacht an dem Abend, als ich Sie zuerst begrüßen durfte und Sie meiner irrigen Auffassung – damals war sie irrig – mit der Erklärung begegneten, Sie seien vollkommen gesund. Ich glaube, ich drückte damals etwas wie einen Zweifel aus, aber, ich versichere Sie, ich meinte es nicht so! Ich will mich nicht scharfsichtiger hinstellen, als ich bin, ich dachte damals an keine feuchte Stelle, ich meinte es anders, allgemeiner, philosophischer, ich verlautbarte meinen Zweifel daran, daß ›Mensch‹ und ›vollkommene Gesundheit‹ überhaupt Reimworte seien. Und auch heute noch, auch nach dem Verlauf Ihrer Untersuchung, kann ich, wie ich nun einmal bin, und im Unterschiede von meinem verehrten Chef, diese feuchte Stelle da« – und er hatte mit der Fingerspitze leicht Hans Castorps Schulter berührt – »nicht als im Vordergrunde des Interesses stehend erachten. Sie ist für mich eine sekundäre Erscheinung … Das Organische ist immer sekundär …«","""You seem surprised to see me, Mr. Castorp,"" he had spoken with baritonal gentleness, hesitantly, somewhat pretentiously and with an exotic palate-r, which he {291}but did not roll, but only with a single tap of the tongue generated just behind the upper front teeth; ""But I'm only fulfilling a pleasant duty if I see to it that things are all right with you. Your relationship with us has entered a new phase, overnight the guest has become a comrade...' (The word 'comrade' had frightened Hans Castorp a little.) 'Who would have thought it!' Krokowski joked comradely… “Who would have thought it that night when I was first allowed to greet you and you countered my erroneous notion – it was erroneous at the time – by explaining that you were perfectly healthy. I think I expressed something of a doubt at the time, but, I assure you, I didn't mean it! I don't want to pretend to be more perspicacious than I am, I wasn't thinking of a wet spot at the time, I meant it differently, more generally, more philosophically, I voiced my doubts that 'man' and 'perfect health' were rhyming words at all. And even today, even after the course of your investigation, I, as I happen to be and in contrast to my dear boss, can't use this wet spot there"" - and he had lightly touched Hans Castorp's shoulder with his fingertip - ""not as consider to be in the foreground of interest. For me it is a secondary phenomenon... The organic is always secondary...""","“You seem surprised to see me, Herr Castorp,” he said, mildly baritone, drawling, unquestionably rather affected: he gave the r a foreign, palatal sound, not rolled, but pronounced with a single impact of the tongue against the upper front teeth. “But I am only performing my pleasant duty, in seeing after your welfare. Your relations with us have entered upon a new phase. Overnight the guest has become the comrade.” His patient was rather alarmed by the word comrade.—“Who would have thought it?” he jested fraternally. “Who would have thought it on that evening when I had the honour of making your acquaintance, and you replied to my mistaken supposition—at that time mistaken—with the explanation that you were perfectly healthy? I believe I expressed some doubt, but I assure you I did not mean it in that sense. I will not pretend to being more sharp-sighted than I am. I was not thinking of a moist spot. My remark was meant only in the general, philosophical sense, as a doubt whether the two conceptions, man and perfect health, were after all consistent one with the other. Even to-day, after the examination, I confess that I personally, as distinguished from my honoured chief, cannot regard the moist spot as the most important factor in the situation. It is, for me, a secondary phenomenon—the organic is always secondary—”","“You seem surprised to see me, Herr Castorp,” he had said in his gentle baritone; his consciously affected, drawling accent had an exotic, palatalized r—not a rolled r, but simply a single tap of the tongue just behind the upper front teeth. “I am merely fulfilling a pleasant duty in stopping by to see how you are doing. Your association with us has entered a new phase—overnight our guest has become a comrade.” (The word “comrade” had made Hans Castorp feel rather uneasy.) “Who would have thought it!” Dr. Krokowski had joked in a comradely voice. “Who would have thought that evening when I first had the pleasure of greeting you, and you responded to my mistaken view— it was a mistake at the time—by declaring that you were perfectly healthy. I think I expressed something of my doubts at the time, but I assure you that I did not mean this. I do not wish to represent myself as more perspicacious than I am. I certainly wasn’t thinking at the time of a moist spot, my intentions were quite different, more general, more philosophical. I was articulating my doubts that the words ‘human being’ and ‘perfect health’ could ever be made to rhyme. And even today, despite what happened at your examination, from my viewpoint—which is different from that of my distinguished supervisor— this moist spot here”—and he had lightly touched Hans Castorp’s shoulder with the tip of one finger—“cannot be regarded as the primary object of interest. It is merely a secondary phenomenon. Organic factors are always secondary.”"

"Wirklich hatte er gleich bei seinem Eintritt seinen zierlichen Erwerb von heute morgen vom Waschtisch genommen, hatte die 37,6, die nun ihre Rolle ausgespielt hatten, durch senkrechte Stöße zerstört und sich ganz wie ein Alter, die gläserne Zigarre im Munde, in die Liegekur verfügt. Aber allzu hochfliegenden Erwartungen entgegen und obgleich er das Instrument volle acht Minuten unter der Zunge behalten, hatte {268}Merkurius sich nicht weiter ausgedehnt, als wieder nur bis 37,6, – was ja übrigens Fieber war, wenn auch kein höheres, als schon am früheren Vormittage vorhanden gewesen. Nach Tische stieg das schimmernde Säulchen auf 37,7, verharrte abends, als der Patient nach den Erregungen und Neuigkeiten des Tages sehr müde war, auf 37,5, und zeigte in der nächsten Morgenfrühe gar nur auf 37, um gegen Mittag die gestrige Höhe wieder zu erreichen. Unter diesen Ergebnissen kam die Hauptmahlzeit des folgenden Tages und mit ihrer Beendigung die Stunde des Rendezvous heran.","In fact, as soon as he entered he had taken his dainty acquisition from the washstand the morning before, had destroyed the 37.6, which had now played out its role, with vertical blows and, looking like an old man, with a glass cigar in his mouth, had gone into the rest cure has. But contrary to all too lofty expectations, and although he kept the instrument under his tongue for a full eight minutes, {268}Mercury had expanded no further than again only to 37.6 - which, by the way, was a fever, although no higher than before been present earlier in the morning. After Tische the shimmering column rose to 37.7, stayed at 37.5 in the evening when the patient was very tired after the excitement and news of the day, and the next morning it was only 37, about noon the previous day's level to reach again. Under these results came the main meal of the following day, and with its conclusion the hour of the rendezvous.","He had in fact, directly he entered, taken up his new acquisition from the washhand-stand and plunged it repeatedly through the air, to obliterate the morning’s record. Then he went into the balcony with the glass cigar in his mouth, like an old hand. But contrary to some rather exaggerated expectations, Mercurius climbed no further than before—though Hans Castorp kept the instrument under his tongue eight minutes for good measure. But after all, 99.6° was unquestionably fever, even though no higher than the earlier record. In the afternoon the gleaming column mounted up as far as 99.7°, but declined to 99.5° by evening, when the patient was weary with the excitement of the day. Next morning it showed 99.6°, climbing during the morning to the same level as before. And so arrived the hour for the main meal of the day, bringing the examination in its wake.","In actuality, no sooner had he entered his room than he had picked up his recent fragile purchase from the washstand, given it a few vertical shakes to erase the 99.7, which had served its purpose now, and with the glass cigar in his mouth had taken to his rest cure like an old hand. But despite his rather soaring expectations and although he held the instrument under his tongue for a full eight minutes, Mercury stretched himself again just to 99.7, but no farther—which was indeed a fever, but no higher than it had been earlier that morning. After dinner, the little column rose to 99.9, but that evening, when the patient was very tired after all the excitement and novelty of the day, it held at 99.5, and by the next morning was even down to 98.6, only to return by noon to the high of the previous day. And that was how things stood as the hour neared for the day’s main meal and, once it was over, his appointed rendezvous."
"Und er blieb vor ihnen stehen, die Zigarre zwischen Zeige- und Mittelfinger seiner riesigen Rechten.","And he stopped in front of them, the cigar between the index and middle fingers of his huge right hand.","and he remained standing before them, holding the cigar between the index and middle fingers of his great right hand.","And there he stood before them, his cigar held between the first and second fingers of his gigantic right hand."
"»… Und also ist Ihr Katarrh in meinen Augen eine Erscheinung dritter Ordnung«, hatte Dr. Krokowski sehr leicht hinzugefügt. »Wie steht es damit? Die Bettruhe wird in dieser Hinsicht gewiß rasch das Ihre tun. Was haben Sie heute gemessen?« Und von da an hatte der Besuch des Assistenten den Charakter einer harmlosen Kontrollvisite getragen, wie er ihn denn auch in den folgenden Tagen und Wochen beständig trug: Dr. Krokowski kam ¾4 Uhr oder auch schon etwas frü{292}her über den Balkon herein, begrüßte den Liegenden auf mannhaft heitere Art, stellte die einfachsten ärztlichen Fragen, leitete auch wohl ein kurzes, persönlicher bestimmtes Geplauder ein, scherzte kameradschaftlich, – und wenn alles dies eines Anfluges von Bedenklichkeit nicht entbehrte, so gewöhnt man sich endlich auch an das Bedenkliche, falls es in seinen Grenzen bleibt, und Hans Castorp fand bald nichts mehr gegen das regelmäßige Erscheinen Dr. Krokowskis zu erinnern, das nun einmal zum stehenden Normaltage gehörte und die Stunde der großen Liegekur apostrophierte.","""... And so, in my eyes, your catarrh is a third-order phenomenon,"" Dr. Added Krokowski very easily. 'How about that? Bed rest will certainly quickly do its part in this regard. What did you measure today?' And from then on the assistant's visit had taken on the character of a harmless check-up, which he continued to do in the following days and weeks: Dr. Krokowski came in through the balcony at three-quarters o'clock or a little earlier, greeted the patient in a manfully cheerful manner, asked the simplest medical questions, probably also initiated a short, more personal chat, joked comradely - and if everything if this was not without a hint of dubiousness, then one finally gets used to the dubious thing, provided it remains within its limits, and Hans Castorp soon found nothing more against the regular appearance of Dr. To remind Krokowskis, which now once belonged to the standing normal day and apostrophized the hour of the long rest cure.","“—and thus your catarrh is, in my view, a third-line phenomenon,” Dr. Krokowski concluded, very softly. “How is it? The rest in bed will undoubtedly be efficacious, in this respect. What have you measured to-day?” And from then on the Assistant’s visit was in the key of an ordinary professional call, to which it kept during the following days and weeks. Dr. Krokowski would enter by the open balcony door at a quarter to four or earlier, greet the patient with manly readiness, put the usual professional questions, with perhaps a little personal touch as well, a jest or two—and if all this had a slight aura of the questionable about it, yet one can get used even to the questionable, provided it keeps within bounds. It was not long before Hans Castorp forgot any feeling he may have had about Dr. Krokowski’s visits. They took their place in the programme of the normal day, and performed, as it were, an elision in the latter end of the main rest period.","“So in my eyes at least, your catarrh is merely a tertiary phenomenon,” Dr. Krokowski had added very nonchalantly. “How is that cold, by the way? I’m certain bed rest will soon take care of it. Have you been measuring your temperature today?” And at that point the assistant’s visit had taken on the character of a rather harmless inspection, which continued to be the case in the following days and weeks. Dr. Krokowski would enter by way of the balcony at a quarter till four or a little earlier, greet the recumbent patient in his cheerful, manly way, make a few very elementary medical inquiries, bring the conversation around briefly to more personal topics, and make a comradely joke or two. And although these visits never failed to have a certain dubious aura about them, one can eventually become accustomed to dubious things—if they remain within limits. And Hans Castorp soon found he had no objections to Dr. Krokowski’s regular “materializations.” They simply belonged to the fixed schedule of a normal day, and ended the main rest cure with an apostrophe."

"Es war eine polnische Angelegenheit, ein Ehrentrubel, entstanden im Schoße der polnischen Gruppe, die sich kürzlich im Berghof zusammengefunden hatte, einer ganzen kleinen Kolonie, die den Guten Russentisch besetzt hielt – (Hans Castorp, dies hier einzuflechten, saß nicht mehr dort, sondern war mit der Zeit an den der Kleefeld, dann an den der Salomon und dann an den Fräulein Levis gewandert).

"Die pathologische Anatomie, von der er einen Band seitlich in den roten Schein seines Tischlämpchens hielt, belehrte ihn durch einen Text, der mit Abbildungen durchsetzt war, über das Wesen der parasitischen Zellvereinigung und der Infektionsgeschwülste. Diese waren Gewebsformen – und zwar besonders üppige Gewebsformen –, hervorgerufen durch das Eindringen fremdartiger Zellen in einen Organismus, der sich für sie aufnahmelustig erwiesen hatte und ihrem Gedeihen auf {432}irgendeine Weise – aber man mußte wohl sagen: auf eine irgendwie liederliche Weise – günstige Bedingungen bot. Weniger, daß der Parasit dem umgebenden Gewebe Nahrung entzogen hätte; aber er erzeugte, indem er, wie jede Zelle, Stoff wechselte, organische Verbindungen, die sich für die Zellen des Wirtsorganismus als erstaunlich giftig, als unweigerlich verderbenbringend erwiesen. Man hatte von einigen Mikroorganismen die Toxine zu isolieren und in konzentriertem Zustande darzustellen verstanden, und es verwunderlich gefunden, in welchen geringen Dosen diese Stoffe, die einfach in die Reihe der Eiweißverbindungen gehörten, in den Kreislauf eines Tieres gebracht, die allergefährlichsten Vergiftungserscheinungen, reißende Verderbnis bewirkten. Das äußere Wesen dieser Korruption war Gewebswucherung, die pathologische Geschwulst, nämlich als Reaktionswirkung der Zellen auf den Reiz, den die zwischen ihnen angesiedelten Bazillen auf sie ausübten. Hirsekorngroße Knötchen bildeten sich, zusammengesetzt aus schleimhautgewebartigen Zellen, zwischen denen oder in denen die Bazillen nisteten, und von welchen einige außerordentlich reich an Protoplasma, riesengroß und von vielen Kernen erfüllt waren. Diese Lustbarkeit aber führte gar bald zum Ruin, denn nun begannen die Kerne der Monstrezellen zu schrumpfen und zu zerfallen, ihr Protoplasma an Gerinnung zugrunde zu gehen; weitere Gewebsteile der Umgebung wurden von der fremden Reizwirkung ergriffen; entzündliche Vorgänge griffen um sich und zogen die angrenzenden Gefäße in Mitleidenschaft; weiße Blutkörperchen wanderten, angelockt von der Unheilsstätte, herzu; das Gerinnungssterben schritt fort; und unterdessen hatten längst die löslichen Bakteriengifte die Nervenzentren berauscht, der Organismus stand in Hochtemperatur, mit wogendem Busen, sozusagen, taumelte er seiner Auflösung entgegen.","Pathological Anatomy, a volume of which he held aside in the red glow of his table lamp, instructed him, through a text interspersed with illustrations, on the nature of parasitic cell union and infectious tumors. These were tissues--and particularly lush tissues--produced by the intrusion of alien cells into an organism that had proved receptive to them, and causing them to thrive in some way--but one might have to say, in some slovenly way-- favorable conditions. Less that the parasite would have deprived the surrounding tissue of nourishment; but by changing substance, like every cell, it produced organic compounds which proved to be astonishingly poisonous and inevitably fatal to the cells of the host organism. People had understood how to isolate the toxins from some microorganisms and to present them in a concentrated state, and it was found surprising at what small doses these substances, which simply belonged to the series of protein compounds, brought the most dangerous symptoms of poisoning, tearing spoilage, into the animal's circulation effected. The outer essence of this corruption was tissue proliferation, the pathological growth, namely as a reaction of the cells to the stimulus exerted on them by the bacilli settled between them. Nodules the size of millet-seeds formed, composed of mucous tissue-like cells, between or in which the bacilli nested, and some of these were extraordinarily rich in protoplasm, gigantic, and filled with many nuclei. But this merrymaking soon led to ruin, for now the nuclei of the monster cells began to shrink and disintegrate, and their protoplasm perished from coagulation; other parts of tissue in the vicinity were seized by the foreign stimulus; inflammatory processes spread and affected the adjacent vessels; white blood-corpuscles migrated, attracted by the place of disaster; death from clotting progressed; and meanwhile the soluble bacterial toxins had long since intoxicated the nerve centers, the organism stood at a high temperature, with heaving breasts, so to speak, staggering towards its dissolution.","He held a volume of pathological anatomy in the red ray from his table-lamp, and conned its text and numerous reproductions. He read of the existence of parasitic celljuncture and of infectious tumours. These were forms of tissue—and very luxuriant forms too—produced by foreign cell-bodies in an organism which had proved receptive to them, and in some way or other—one must probably say perversely—had offered them peculiarly favourable conditions. It was not so much that the parasite took away nourishment from the surrounding tissues, as that, in the process of building up and breaking down which went on in it as in every other cell, it produced organic combinations which were extraordinarily toxic—undeniably destructive—to the cells where it had been entertained. They had found out how to isolate the toxin from a number of micro-organisms and produce it in concentrated form; and it was amazing to see what small doses of this substance, which simply belonged to a group of protein combinations, could, when introduced into the circulation of an animal, produce symptoms of acute poisoning and rapid degeneration. The outward sign of this inward decay was a growth of tissue, the pathological tumour, which was the reaction of the cells to the stimulus of the foreign bacilli. Tubercles developed, the size of a millet-seed, composed of cells resembling mucous membrane, among or within which the bacilli lodged; some of these were extraordinarily rich in protoplasm, very large, and full of nuclei. However, all this good living soon led to ruin; for the nuclei of these monster cells began to break down, the protoplasm they contained to be destroyed by coagulation, and further areas of tissue to be involved. They were attacked by inflammation, the neighbouring blood-vessels suffered by contagion. White blood-corpuscles were attracted to the seat of the evil; the breakingdown proceeded apace; and meanwhile the soluble toxins released by the bacteria had already poisoned the nerve-centres, the entire organization was in a state of high fever, and staggered—so to speak with heaving bosom—toward dissolution.","He learned pathological anatomy from a volume he was now holding to one side to catch the reddish glow of his table lamp; the text, with a series of illustrations, discussed parasitic cell fusion and infectious tumors. These were tissue formations—and very luxuriant formations they were—caused by foreign cells invading an organism that proved receptive to them and for some reason offered favorable conditions (although, one had to admit, rather dissolute conditions at that) for them to flourish. It was not so much that the parasite deprived the surrounding tissue of its nourishment, but rather, in exchanging materials with its host cell, it formed organic compounds that proved amazingly toxic, indeed ultimately destructive, to the cells of the host organism. Researchers had been able to isolate and concentrate the toxins from several such microorganisms and were amazed to find that, if injected into an animal’s bloodstream, even tiny doses of such materials, which could be classified as simple proteins, produced the most acute toxic effects, leading to rapid demise. The external form of this contamination was a rapid growth of tissue, a tumor, pathologically speaking, which was the cells’ reaction to the stimulus of bacilli having taken up residence among them. The cells of the mucuslike tissue between which or in which the bacilli resided formed millet-seed-size nodules, some of which were very large indeed and extraordinarily rich in protoplasm containing numerous nuclei. This riotous living, however, soon led to ruin, because the nuclei of these monster cells began to shrink and break down, their protoplasm began to congeal and decompose; other tissues in the vicinity were affected by the same foreign stimuli. Inflammation spread to adjacent blood vessels; lured to the scene of the accident, white corpuscles now arrived; death by congealing proceeded apace. Meanwhile the soluble toxins from the bacteria had long since intoxicated the nerve centers; the organism was already feverish, and with heaving bosom, so to speak, it reeled toward its disintegration."

"Es gibt auf Erden eine Lebenslage, gibt landschaftliche Umstände (wenn man von »Landschaft« sprechen darf in dem uns vorschwebenden Falle), unter denen eine solche Verwirrung und Verwischung der zeitlich-räumlichen Distanzen bis zur schwindeligen Einerleiheit gewissermaßen von Natur und Rechtes wegen statthat, so daß denn ein Untertauchen in ihrem Zauber für Ferienstunden allenfalls als statthaft gelten möge. Wir meinen den Spaziergang am Meeresstrande, – ein Sichbefinden, dessen Hans Castorp nie ohne größte Zuneigung gedachte, – wie wir ja wissen, daß er sich durch das Leben im Schnee an heimatliche Dünengefilde gern und dankbar erinnern ließ. Wir vertrauen, daß auch Erfahrung und Erinnerung des Lesers uns nicht im Stiche lassen werde, wenn wir auf diese wundersame Verlorenheit Bezug nehmen. Du gehst und gehst … du wirst von solchem Gange niemals zu rechter Zeit nach Hause zurückkehren, denn du bist der Zeit und sie ist dir abhanden gekommen. O Meer, wir sitzen erzählend fern von dir, wir wenden dir unsere Gedanken, unsre Liebe zu, ausdrücklich und laut anrufungsweise sollst du in unserer Erzählung gegenwärtig sein, wie du es im stillen immer warst und bist und sein wirst … Sausende Öde, blaß hellgrau überspannt, voll herber Feuchte, von der ein Salzgeschmack auf unseren {825}Lippen haftet. Wir gehen, gehen auf leicht federndem, mit Tang und kleinen Muscheln bestreutem Grunde, die Ohren eingehüllt vom Wind, von diesem großen, weiten und milden Winde, der frei und ungehemmt und ohne Tücke den Raum durchfährt und eine sanfte Betäubung in unserem Kopfe erzeugt, – wir wandern, wandern und sehen die Schaumzungen der vorgetriebenen und wieder rückwärts wallenden See nach unseren Füßen lecken. Die Brandung siedet, hell-dumpf aufprallend rauscht Welle auf Welle seidig auf den flachen Strand, – so dort wie hier und an den Bänken draußen, und dieses wirre und allgemeine, sanft brausende Getöse sperrt unser Ohr für jede Stimme der Welt. Tiefes Genügen, wissentlich Vergessen … Schließen wir doch die Augen, geborgen von Ewigkeit! Nein, sieh, dort in der schaumig graugrünen Weite, die sich in ungeheueren Verkürzungen zum Horizont verliert, dort steht ein Segel. Dort? Was ist das für ein Dort? Wie weit? Wie nah? Das weißt du nicht. Auf schwindelige Weise entzieht es sich deinem Urteil. Um zu sagen, wie weit dies Schiff vom Ufer entfernt ist, müßtest du wissen, wie groß es an sich selber als Körper ist. Klein und nahe oder groß und fern? In Unwissenheit bricht sich dein Blick, denn aus dir selber sagt kein Organ und Sinn dir über den Raum Bescheid … Wir gehen, gehen, – wie lange schon? Wie weit? Das steht dahin. Nichts ändert sich bei unserem Schritt, dort ist wie hier, vorhin wie jetzt und dann; in ungemessener Monotonie des Raumes ertrinkt die Zeit, Bewegung von Punkt zu Punkt ist keine Bewegung mehr, wenn Einerleiheit regiert, und wo Bewegung nicht mehr Bewegung ist, ist keine Zeit.","There is a life situation on earth, there are scenic circumstances (if one can speak of ""landscape"" in the case before us), under which such a confusion and blurring of the temporal-spatial distances to the point of dizzy monotony takes place, so to speak, by nature and rightly, so that immersing yourself in their magic for vacation hours may at best be considered permissible. We mean the walk on the seashore - a feeling that Hans Castorp never thought of without the greatest affection - as we know that he was fondly and gratefully reminded of his native dune regions through life in the snow. We trust that the reader's experience and memory will not fail us when we refer to this wondrous forlornness. You go and go... you will never return home in time from such a walk, for you are the time and you have lost it. O sea, we sit far away from you telling stories, we turn our thoughts and our love to you, explicitly and loudly invoking you should be present in our story, as you always were and are and always will be in secret... Roaring wasteland, pale light grey tense, full of bitter moisture, from which a salty taste clings to our {825}lips. We walk, walk on lightly springy ground strewn with seaweed and small shells, our ears enveloped by the wind, by that great, wide and gentle wind that traverses space freely and unrestrainedly and without malice and creates a gentle numbness in our heads. – we hike, hike and see the tongues of foam of the sea that is pushed forward and back again licking at our feet. The surf simmers, wave after wave crashing softly onto the flat beach, - as there as here and on the benches outside, and this confused and general, softly roaring roar blocks our ear to every voice in the world. Deep satisfaction, knowingly forgetting ... Let's close our eyes, safe from eternity! No, look, there in the frothy grey-green expanse, which loses itself in immense foreshortenings to the horizon, there stands a sail. There? What is that there? How far? how close You do not know that. It dizzily eludes your judgment. In order to tell how far this ship is from shore, you would need to know how large it is in itself as a body. Small and near or big and far? Your gaze breaks in ignorance, because no organ or sense tells you about the space in yourself... We're walking, walking - how long has it been? How far? That's there. Nothing changes at our step, there is as here, before as now and then; time drowns in the unmeasured monotony of space, movement from point to point is no longer movement when monotony reigns, and where movement is no longer movement there is no time.","There is a state, in our human life, there are certain scenic surroundings—if one may use that adjective to describe the surroundings we have in mind—within which such a confusion and obliteration of distances in time and space is in a measure justified, and temporary submersion in them, say for the term of a holiday, not reprehensible. Hans Castorp, for his part, could never without the greatest longing think of a stroll along the ocean’s edge. We know how he loved to have the snowy wastes remind him of his native landscape of broad ocean dunes; we hope the reader’s recollections will bear us out when we speak of the joys of that straying. You walk, and walk—never will you come home at the right time, for you are of time, and time is vanished. O ocean, far from thee we sit and spin our tale; we turn toward thee our thoughts, our love, loud and expressly we call on thee, that thou mayst be present in the tale we spin, as in secret thou ever wast and shalt be!—A singing solitude, spanned by a sky of palest grey; full of stinging damp that leaves a salty tang upon the lips.—We walk along the springy floor, strewn with seaweed and tiny mussel-shells. Our ears are wrapped about by the great mild, ample wind, that comes sweeping untrammelled blandly through space, and gently blunts our senses. We wander— wander—watching the tongues of foam lick upward toward our feet and sink back again. The surf is seething; wave after wave, with high, hollow sound, rears up, rebounds, and runs with a silken rustle out over the flat strand: here one, there one, and more beyond, out on the bar. The dull, pervasive, sonorous roar closes our ears against all the sounds of the world. O deep content, O wilful bliss of sheer forgetfulness! Let us shut our eyes, safe in eternity! No—for there in the foaming grey-green waste that stretches with uncanny foreshortening to lose itself in the horizon, look, there is a sail. There? Where is there? How far, how near? You cannot tell. Dizzyingly it escapes your measurement. In order to know how far that ship is from the shore, you would need to know how much room it occupies, as a body in space. Is it large and far off, or is it small and near? Your eye grows dim with uncertainty, for in yourself you have no sense-organ to help you judge of time or space.—We walk, walk. How long, how far? Who knows? Nothing is changed by our pacing, there is the same as here, once on a time the same as now, or then; time is drowning in the measureless monotony of space, motion from point to point is no motion more, where uniformity rules; and where motion is no more motion, time is no longer time.","There are situations in life on earth, or circumstances of landscape (if one can speak of “landscape” in this case), in which a confusion and obliteration of temporal and spatial distances, ending in total dizzying monotony, is more or less natural and legitimate, so that immersion into its magic during a vacation, for instance, might likewise be considered legitimate. We are talking about a stroll by the shore—a state of being for which Hans Castorp always felt a great partiality; and, as we know, he gratefully enjoyed thinking of life in the snow as reminiscent of the rolling dunes of his homeland. We assume that our reader’s experiences and memories will join us as we expand on this marvelous state of lostness. You walk and walk, and you never get back home on time, because you are lost to time and it to you. O sea—we sit here telling our story far from you, but our eyes and heart turn toward you now, and we explicitly invoke you, speak your name aloud, making you as present as you constantly have been, are, always will be, in our silent thoughts . . .Blustering wasteland, spanned by pale, bright gray, drenched with a dry, salty tang that clings to our lips. We walk and walk along the light springy beach strewn with seaweed and tiny shells, our ears swathed by the wind, by the great, ample, mild wind that passes freely through space, unencumbered and without malice, filling our heads with a gentle numbness—we wander, wander and watch the roiling sea send tongues of onrushing foam to lick our feet and fall back again. The surf seethes, wave upon silken wave crashes with a bright thud against the level beach—here, there, on sandbars farther out. And the universal turmoil, the tenderly booming din closes our ears against every other voice in the world. Profound contentment, knowing forgetfulness. Sheltered in eternity, let us close our eyes. No, look, there in the foamy gray-green expanse as it loses itself, diminishing vastly against the horizon, there is a sail. There? What sort of there? How far? How near? You do not know. It dizzyingly evades all certainty. To say how far the boat is from the shore you would have to know its size. Small and near, or large and distant? And in your ignorance, your gaze falters, for no organ, no internal sense, can tell you for sure. We walk and walk—how long has it been now? How far? It does not matter. And at every step, nothing changes—“there” is “here,” “before” is both “now” and “then.” Time drowns in the unmeasured monotony of space. Where uniformity reigns, movement from point to point is no longer movement; and where movement is no longer movement, there is no time."

"So hatten sie heute die große Nachmittagsliegekur um dreißig Minuten abgekürzt, waren mit dem Schlage halb vier die steinerne Treppe in das falsche Kellergeschoß »hinab«gestiegen und saßen zusammen in dem kleinen Warteraum, der das Ordinationszimmer vom Durchleuchtungslaboratorium trennte, – Joachim, dem nichts Neues bevorstand, in guter Ruhe, Hans Castorp etwas fiebrig erwartungsvoll, da man bisher noch niemals Einblick in sein organisches Innenleben genommen. Sie waren nicht allein: mehrere Gäste hatten, zerrissene illustrierte Zeitschriften auf den Knien, schon im Zimmer gesessen, als sie eingetreten waren, und warteten mit ihnen: ein reckenhafter junger Schwede, der im Speisesaal an Settembrinis Tische saß und von dem man sagte, er sei bei seiner Ankunft im April so krank gewesen, daß man ihn kaum habe aufnehmen wollen; nun aber habe er achtzig Pfund zugenommen und sei im Begriffe, als völlig geheilt entlassen zu werden; ferner eine Frau vom Schlechten Russentisch, eine Mutter, selbst kümmerlich, mit ihrem noch kümmerlicheren, langnäsigen und häßlichen {321}Knaben namens Sascha. Diese Personen also warteten schon länger als die Vettern; offenbar hatten sie in der Reihenfolge der Bestellungen den Vorrang vor ihnen, Verspätung schien eingerissen nebenan im Durchleuchtungsraum, und so stand kalter Tee in Aussicht.","So today they had shortened the long afternoon rest treatment by thirty minutes, at the stroke of three-thirty they had “climbed” down the stone stairs to the wrong basement floor and were sitting together in the small waiting room that separated the surgery room from the X-ray laboratory—Joachim, nothing new to him imminent, in good calm, Hans Castorp somewhat feverishly full of expectation, since one had never seen his organic inner workings before. They were not alone: several guests, torn illustrated magazines on their knees, were already sitting in the room when they entered and were waiting with them: a brave young Swede who was sitting at Settembrini's tables in the dining room and who was said to be him was so ill when he arrived in April that they hardly wanted to take him in; but now he has gained eighty pounds and is about to be discharged as fully healed; also a woman from the bad Russian table, a mother, herself wretched, with her still wretched, long-nosed and ugly boy named Sascha. So these people had been waiting longer than the cousins; Apparently they had priority over them in the order in which they were ordered, the delay seemed obvious in the X-ray room next door, and so cold tea was in prospect.","They shortened the main rest period by thirty minutes and, promptly as the clock struck half past three, descended the stairs to the so-called basement, and sat down in the small antechamber between the consulting-room and the laboratory. Joachim was quite cool, this being for him no new experience, Hans Castorp rather feverishly expectant, as no one, up to the present, had ever had a view into his organic interior. They were not alone. Several other patients were already sitting when they entered, with tattered illustrated magazines on their laps, and they all waited together: a young Swede, of heroic proportions, who sat at Settembrini’s table; of whom one heard that, when he entered, the previous April, he had been so ill they had almost refused to take him, but he had put on nearly six stone, and was about to be discharged cured. There was also a mother from the “bad” Russian table, herself a lamentable case, with her long-nosed, ugly boy, named Sascha, whose case was more lamentable still. These three had been waiting longer than the cousins and would therefore go in before them—evidently there had been some sort of hitch in the laboratory, and a cold tea was on the cards.","And so they both had cut short the main afternoon rest cure by a half hour, had “descended” the stairs to the pseudo-basement at three-thirty on the dot, and now sat in the little waiting room that separated the consulting and X-ray rooms. Joachim, for whom this was nothing new, was quite calm; Hans Castorp was a little feverish with expectation, since until now no one had ever taken a look into his organic interior. They were not alone. Several guests were already seated in the room, tattered illustrated magazines spread over their knees. They all waited together: a young, big bruiser of a Swede, who sat at Settembrini’s table in the dining hall and who people said had been so ill when he arrived the previous April that he had been admitted only with great reluctance, but who now had put on eighty pounds and was about to be released as fully cured; a woman from the Bad Russian table, a mother, a wretched soul; and her even more wretched, long-nosed, ugly son named Sasha. The three had been waiting before the cousins’ arrival and presumably had precedence on the appointment list. Evidently they were well behind schedule in the adjoining X-ray room, and a long wait appeared likely."
"Hans Castorp hatte dem Ereignis mit den äußeren Zeichen respektvollen Schreckens beigewohnt, im Grunde aber mutete auch dies ihn nicht ernst an, Gott mochte ihm helfen. Popów hätte an seinem Fischbissen freilich ersticken können, aber in Wirklichkeit war er ja nicht erstickt, sondern hatte, bei aller bewußtlosen Wut und Lustbarkeit, im Stillsten wohl dennoch ein wenig achtgegeben. Nun saß er heiter, aß fertig und tat, als habe er sich nie wie ein Berserker und rasender Trunkenbold benommen, erinnerte sich gewiß auch nicht daran. Auch seine Erscheinung aber war nicht danach angetan, Hans Castorps Ehrfurcht vor dem Leiden zu stärken; auch sie, in ihrer Art, vermehrte die Eindrücke unernster Liederlichkeit, denen er sich widerstrebend hier oben ausgesetzt fand, und denen er durch eine den herrschenden Sitten widersprechende nähere Beschäftigung mit den Schweren und Moribunden entgegenzuwirken wünschte.","Hans Castorp had witnessed the event with outward signs of respectful terror, but basically this didn't strike him as serious either, God help him. Of course, Popów could have choked on his bite of fish, but in reality he hadn't choked, but in spite of all his unconscious anger and merriment he had been paying attention to himself. Now he sat happily, finished his meal, and acted as if he had never behaved like a berserk and a frenzied drunkard, certainly did not remember it. But even his appearance was not designed to strengthen Hans Castorp's reverence for suffering; She, too, in her own way, increased the impressions of irresponsible licentiousness to which he reluctantly found himself exposed up here, and which he wished to counteract by a closer study of the heavy and moribund, which was contrary to prevailing customs.","Hans Castorp was present at this episode, and evinced all the outward signs of concern and alarm, but at bottom he was not edified, God help him! True, Popoff might have choked on his mouthful of fish; but he had not. Perhaps, in all his unconscious mouthings and goings-on, he had all the while somehow taken jolly good care not to. Now he was sitting there, eating blithely away, as though he had never been behaving like a drunken berserk—very probably he remembered nothing at all about it. But in his person he was not a man to strengthen Hans Castorp’s respect for suffering; his wife, too, after her fashion, only added to those impressions of frivolous irregularity against which Hans Castorp wrestled and which he sought to counteract by coming into closer touch, despite the prevailing attitude, with the suffering and dying in the establishment.","Hans Castorp had sat through the incident with every outward sign of concerned horror, but ultimately—God help him!—not even this event seemed all that serious. To be sure, Popóv might have choked to death on his mouthful of fish; but, in fact, he had not choked to death and despite all his unconscious cavorting rage had evidently quietly managed to keep from doing so. And then there he sat cheerfully finishing his meal and pretending as if he had never carried on like a crazy drunkard gone berserk —presumably did not even recall what had happened. Nor was there anything to inspire greater reverence for suffering in his appearance; in its own way, this incident, too, bolstered Hans Castorp ’s impression that he was being exposed up here, against his will, to frivolous slovenliness, and, counter to all local custom , he hoped to offset this process by paying closer attention to those seriously ill and moribund."

"»Gut gebrüllt, Löwe«, konnte Hans Castorp nicht umhin zu denken, wie gewöhnlich, wenn Herr Settembrini etwas Pädagogisches geäußert. Er sagte aber nur:","""Well roared, lion,"" Hans Castorp couldn't help but think, as he usually did when Herr Settembrini said something pedagogical. But he only said:","“Well roared, lion,” Herr Castorp could not help thinking, as he often did when Herr Settembrini delivered himself of something pedagogic. Aloud he only said:","“Well roared, lion,” Hans Castorp could not help thinking, as he usually did when Herr Settembrini uttered something pedagogic. But now he said, “We recently participated in some illuminated anatomy downstairs on the ground floor."
"{736}Dies dilettantische Getränk hatte er zu sich gesteckt, einzig und allein, weil es auf »Berghof« in flachen Fläschchen bereitgehalten und Ausflüglern verkauft wurde, wobei selbstverständlich nicht an solche gedacht war, die sich unerlaubterweise bei Schnee und Frost im Gebirge verirrten und unter solchen Umständen die Nacht erwarteten. Bei minder herabgesetzten Sinnen hätte er sich sagen müssen, daß es, unter dem Gesichtspunkt des Heimkommens, beinahe das Falscheste war, was er hätte zu sich nehmen können; und das sagte er sich auch, nachdem er einige Schlucke genommen, die sofort eine Wirkung zeitigten, ganz ähnlich derjenigen des Kulmbacher Bieres am Abend seines ersten Tages hier oben, als er durch liederlich unbeherrschte Reden von Fischsaucen und dergleichen mehr bei Settembrini angestoßen hatte, – bei Herrn Lodovico, dem Pädagogen, der sogar die Tollen, die sich gehen ließen, mit seinem Blick zur Vernunft anhielt, und dessen wohllautendes Hörnchen Hans Castorp eben durch die Lüfte vernahm, zum Zeichen, der rednerische Erzieher nähere sich in großen Märschen, um den Schmerzenszögling, das Sorgenkind des Lebens aus seiner tollen Lage zu befreien und heimzuführen … Was selbstverständlich lauter Unsinn war und nur von dem Kulmbacher herrührte, das er aus Versehen getrunken. Denn erstens hatte Herr Settembrini gar kein Hörnchen, sondern nur seine Drehorgel, die auf einem Stelzbein auf dem Pflaster stand, und zu deren geläufigem Spiel er humanistische Augen an den Häusern emporsandte; und zweitens wußte und merkte er gar nichts von dem, was vorging, da er sich nicht mehr im Sanatorium »Berghof«, sondern bei Damenschneider Lukaček in seinem Speicherstübchen mit der Wasserflasche, oberhalb von Naphtas seidener Zelle, befand, – hatte auch gar kein Recht und keine Möglichkeit zum Einschreiten, so wenig wie dermaleinst in der Faschingsnacht, als Hans Castorp sich in ebenso toller und schlimmer Lage befunden, indem er der kranken Clawdia {737}Chauchat son crayon, seinen Bleistift, Pribislav Hippes Bleistift zurückgegeben hatte … Wie war das übrigens mit der »Lage«? Um sich in einer Lage zu befinden, mußte er liegen und nicht stehen, damit das Wort seinen gerechten und ordentlichen Sinn, statt eines bloß metaphorischen, gewänne. Horizontal, das war die Lage, die einem langjährigen Mitgliede Derer hier oben zukam. War er denn nicht daran gewöhnt, bei Schnee und Frost im Freien zu liegen, nachts sowohl wie am Tage? Und er machte Anstalt, sich niedersinken zu lassen, als ihn die Einsicht durchfuhr, ihn sozusagen beim Kragen nahm und aufrecht hielt, daß auch dieses sein Gedankengeschwätz von der »Lage« nur auf Rechnung des Kulmbacher Bieres zu setzen war, nur seiner unpersönlichen, als typisch gefährlich im Buche stehenden Lust zum Liegen und Schlafen entsprang, die ihn mit Sophismen und Wortspielen betören wollte.","{736}He had taken this amateurish drink with him solely because it was available in flat bottles at ""Berghof"" and sold to trippers, whereby of course people who got lost in the snow and frost in the mountains without permission and under such circumstances awaited the night. With less degraded senses he would have had to tell himself that, from the point of view of coming home, it was almost the worst thing he could have eaten; And he also said that to himself after he had taken a few sips, which had an immediate effect, very similar to that of the Kulmbacher beer on the evening of his first day up here, when he had toasted Settembrini with slovenly, uncontrolled talk about fish sauces and the like - at Herr Lodovico, the educator, who, with his eyes, even stopped the madmen who let themselves go to reason, and whose euphonious horn Hans Castorp just heard through the air, as a sign that the eloquent educator was approaching in long marches, around the Pupil in pain, to free the problem child of life from its mad situation and bring it home ... Which of course was sheer nonsense and only came from the Kulmbacher that he accidentally drank. In the first place, M. Settembrini had no horn at all, only his barrel organ, which stood on a pedestal on the pavement, and to the fluent playing of which he sent humanistic eyes up to the houses; and secondly, he didn't know or notice anything about what was going on, since he was no longer in the Berghof sanatorium, but in Lukaček's dressmaker's little storage room with the water bottle, above Naphta's silk cell - he had no right at all and no opportunity to intervene, any more than that time on Mardi Gras night when Hans Castorp found himself in a situation that was just as great as it was bad, by giving the sick Clawdia {737}Chauchat son crayon his pencil, Pribislav Hippe's pencil back... How was that by the way with the ""location""? To be in a position he had to lie down and not stand, lest the word gain its just and proper sense, rather than a mere metaphorical one. Horizontally, that was the position befitting a longtime member of those up here. Wasn't he accustomed to lying outside in the snow and frost, both night and day? And he was preparing to sink down when the realization struck him, took him by the collar, so to speak, and maintained that this gibberish about the ""location"" was only to be attributed to the Kulmbacher beer, only to its impersonal nature, as a typically dangerous desire to lie down and sleep, which was written in books, and which wanted to beguile him with sophisms and puns.","He had brought with him a bottle of that amateurish drink, simply because it was always kept ready in flat bottles at the Berghof, for excursions—though not, of course, excursions like this unlawful escapade. It was not meant for people who went out in the snow and got lost and night-bound in the mountains. Had his senses been less befogged, he must have said to himself that if he were bent on getting home, it was almost the worst thing he could have done. He did say so, after he had drunk several swallows, for they took effect at once, and it was an effect much like that of the Kulmbacher beer on the evening of his arrival at the Berghof, when he had angered Settembrini by his ungoverned prattle anent fish-sauces and the like— Herr Ludovico, the pedagogue, the same who held madmen to their senses when they would give themselves rein. Hans Castorp heard through thin air the mellifluous sound of his horn; the orator and schoolmaster was nearing by forced marches, to rescue his troublesome nursling, life’s delicate child, from his present desperate pass and lead him home.—All which was of course sheer rubbish, due to the Kulmbacher he had so foolishly drunk. For of course Herr Settembrini had no horn, how could he have? He had a hand-organ, propped by a sort of wooden leg against the pavement, and as he played a sprightly air, he flung his humanistic eyes up to the people in the houses. And furthermore he knew nothing whatever of what had happened, as he no longer lived in House Berghof, but with Lukaçek the tailor, in his little attic room with the water-bottle, above Naphta’s silken cell. Moreover, he would have no right nor reason to interfere—no more than upon that carnival night on which Hans Castorp had found himself in a position quite as mad and bad as this one, when he gave the ailing Clavdia Chauchat back son crayon—his, Pribislav Hippe’s, pencil. What position was that? What position could it be but the horizontal, literally and not metaphorically the position of all long-termers up here? Was not he himself used to lie long hours out of doors, in snow and frost, by night as well as day? And he was making ready to sink down when the idea seized him, took him as it were by the collar and fetched him up standing, that all this nonsense he was uttering was still inspired by the Kulmbacher beer and the impersonal, quite typical and traditional longing to lie down and sleep, of which he had always heard, and which would by quibbling and sophistry now betray him.","The only reason he had pocketed a bottle of this amateurish drink was that it was available for purchase in little flasks at the Berghof, intended for guests going on excursions, but certainly never for anyone illicitly wandering off and getting lost in the snow and frost of the mountains and then waiting for night to fall. Had his mind been less muddled, he would have had to admit that in terms of getting back home this was perhaps the worst thing he could have done; and indeed he told himself as much after he had taken a few sips, which produced an immediate effect, much the same effect as that caused by Kulmbach beer his first evening up here, when with a lot of loose, disreputable talk about fish sauces and the like he had offended Settembrini—Herr Lodovico, the pedagogue, who could keep madmen from letting themselves go, return them to reason with just a glance, and whose melodious little horn Hans Castorp now heard in the air around him, the signal that his oratorical teacher was now approaching at a forced march to free his troublesome pupil, life’s problem child, from his mad situation and lead him home. Which was pure nonsense of course, it was the Kulmbach beer he had drunk by mistake that made him think that. Because firstly, Herr Settembrini did not have a little horn, but only his barrel organ, which had a folding leg so he could set it up on the cobblestones and cast a humanistic eye up at the houses as it played its familiar songs; and secondly, he knew nothing about what was going on, since he no longer lived at Berghof Sanatorium, but at Lukaček’s, in his little garret with a water carafe, just above Naphta’s silken cell—and had no right, and no opportunity, either, to interfere, just as he had had no such right to do so on Mardi Gras night, when Hans Castorp had found himself in a position equally as mad and difficult, when he had given son crayon, his pencil, Pribislav Hippe’s pencil, back to the ailing Clavdia Chauchat. But what was that about “position”? Was that a horizontal position? But that meant you had to be lying down, that was the only way the word achieved its true and special meaning, rather than remaining merely metaphorical. Horizontal, that was the position appropriate to long-term members of “society up here.” Was he not accustomed to lying down in the open air, in the snow and frost, by night as well as by day? And he was about to sink down to rest, when the realization suddenly came to him, grabbed him by the collar, so to speak, that these babbling thoughts about his “position” could likewise be due only to the effects of Kulmbach beer, had arisen solely from an impersonal desire to lie down and sleep, the same typical and dangerous desire you found discussed in books, a desire that was trying to delude him with its sophistries and puns."
"Dies war die geltende Parole, über die einig zu sein man stillschweigend vorgab. Aber die Wahrheit sah so aus, daß einer vom andern nicht so ganz sicher war, ob er in tiefster Seele an diese Parole glaubte, und wenn man die Augen voreinander niederschlug, so geschah es in diesem Zweifel, und es geschah nicht, ohne daß zuvor die Augen sich getroffen hätten. Das aber kam öfters vor seit jenem Kolloquium über die Literatur, während dessen Hans Castorp zum erstenmal das neuartige Licht im Hintergrund von Joachims Augen sowie den eigentümlich »drohenden« Ausdruck darin bemerkt hatte. Namentlich einmal bei Tische kam es vor: als nämlich der heisere Joachim sich unversehens ausnehmend heftig verschluckte und kaum wieder zu Atem kommen konnte. Da also, während Joachim hinter seiner Serviette keuchte und Frau Magnus, seine Nachbarin, ihm einer alten Praktik gemäß den Rücken klopfte, trafen sich ihre Augen auf eine Art, die Hans Castorp schreckhafter bewegte, als der Unfall selbst, der selbstverständlich jedem zustoßen konnte, und dann schloß Joachim die seinen und verließ, mit der Serviette verhüllt, Tisch und Saal, um sich draußen auszuhusten.","This was the prevailing slogan, on which one tacitly pretended to agree. But the truth was that one of the other was not quite sure whether he believed in this slogan in his deepest soul, and if one looked down on one another, it was in this doubt, and it did not happen without first knowing eyes had met. But this has happened more often since that colloquium on literature, during which Hans Castorp first noticed the new light in the background of Joachim's eyes and the peculiar ""threatening"" expression in them. It happened once at table in particular, when the hoarse Joachim suddenly choked and could hardly catch his breath. So, while Joachim was panting behind his napkin and Frau Magnus, his neighbor, was patting him on the back according to an old practice, their eyes met in a way that moved Hans Castorp more frighteningly than the accident itself, which of course could happen to anyone, and then Joachim closed his and, wrapped in his serviette, left the table and the room to cough outside.","Such was the decree with which, one and all, they silently pretended to be in agreement. But the truth was, neither of the cousins was sure the other believed it; if they did not meet each other’s eyes, it was because of the doubt both pairs of eyes sought to hide, and because the eyes had met before. That, of course, often happened, after the colloquy on the subject of literature, during which Hans Castorp had first remarked the strange new light and ominous expression in the depths of his cousin’s eyes. And happened once at table. Joachim suddenly choked violently, and could scarcely get his breath. While he gasped behind his serviette, and his neighbour, Frau Magnus, performed the time-honoured service of slapping him on the back, the cousins’ eyes met, in a way more alarming to Hans Castorp than the incident itself, that being something that might happen to anyone. Then Joachim closed his eyes and left the table, his face covered with his serviette, to cough himself out in the garden.","This was the watchword, with which everyone pretended to be in silent agreement. The truth was, however, that no one was quite certain whether anyone else believed this watchword in the depths of his soul; and because of their doubts the cousins would turn their downcast eyes away—but only after their eyes had first met. This had happened often since the colloquy on literature, the day when Hans Castorp had first noticed a new light and the ominous expression deep in Joachim’s eyes. It happened once at the dinner table—when Joachim, still hoarse, quite unexpectedly choked on something, so violently he could hardly get his breath. And while Joachim gasped behind his napkin and Frau Magnus, his neighbor, pounded on his back in the time-honored fashion, the cousins’ eyes met in a way that frightened Hans Castorp even more than the incident itself, which of course could happen to anyone; and then Joachim lowered his eyes, hid his face in his napkin, and left the table and the dining hall to cough himself out elsewhere."

"Sie lachte, die Zigarette im Munde, daß ihre tatarischen Augen sich zusammenzogen, und ließ, gegen die Boiserie zurückgelehnt, die Hände neben sich auf die Bank gestützt und ein Bein über das andre geschlagen, den Fuß im schwarzen Lackschuh wippen.","She laughed, the cigarette in her mouth so that her Tartar eyes narrowed, and, leaning back against the panelling, her hands on the bench beside her and one leg crossed over the other, she let her foot in the black patent-leather shoe sway.","She laughed, cigarette in mouth, so that the Tartar eyes became narrow slits; leaning back against the wainscoting, her hands resting on the bench on either side of her, one leg crossed over the other, and swinging,her foot in its patent-leather shoe. “Quelle générosité!","She laughed, the cigarette still in her mouth, and her Tartar eyes narrowed to slits; leaning back against the wainscoting and supporting herself on both sides with her hands, one leg still crossed over the other, she jiggled her foot in its patent leather shoe."
»Woran Sie wohltun!« rief Settembrini dankbar.,"""How good you are!"" Settembrini cried gratefully.","“And very rightly so,” cried Settembrini gratefully.",“Very wise of you!” Settembrini exclaimed gratefully.
"»Ebbè, nun also!«","""Ebbe, now then!""",“Ebbè!,“Ebbè— so you see!”
"Plötzlich zuckte Hans Castorp geärgert und beleidigt zusammen. Eine Tür war zugefallen, es war die Tür links vorn, die gleich in die Halle führte, – jemand hatte sie zufallen lassen oder gar hinter sich ins Schloß geworfen, und das war ein Geräusch, das Hans Castorp auf den Tod nicht leiden konnte, das er von jeher gehaßt hatte. Vielleicht beruhte dieser Haß auf Erziehung, vielleicht auf angeborener Idiosynkrasie, – genug, er verabscheute das Türenwerfen und hätte jeden schlagen können, der es sich vor seinen Ohren zuschulden kommen ließ. In diesem Fall war die Tür obendrein mit kleinen Glasscheiben gefüllt, und das verstärkte den Chok: es war ein Schmettern und Klirren. Pfui, dachte Hans Castorp wütend, was ist denn das für eine verdammte Schlamperei! Da übrigens in demselben Augenblick die Nähterin das Wort an ihn richtete, so hatte er keine Zeit, festzustellen, wer der Missetäter gewesen sei. Doch standen Falten zwischen seinen blonden Brauen, und sein Gesicht war peinlich verzerrt, während er der Nähterin antwortete.","Suddenly Hans Castorp winced, annoyed and offended. A door had slammed shut, it was the front left door that led straight into the hall - someone had let it shut or even slammed it behind them, and that was a noise that Hans Castorp couldn't stand, that he had always hated. Perhaps that hatred was from education, perhaps from innate idiosyncrasy—enough he detested door-smashing, and could have punched anyone who threw it in front of his ears. In this case the door was also filled with small panes of glass, and that added to the shock: it was a smash and clink. Pfui, thought Hans Castorp angrily, what kind of damned sloppiness is that! Incidentally, since the seamstress spoke to him at the same moment, he had no time to establish who the culprit was. But there were lines between his blond brows and his face was awkwardly contorted as he answered the seamstress.","Hans Castorp gave a sudden angry start. A door was slammed—it was the one on the left, leading into the hall, and someone had let it fall shut, or even banged it, a thing he detested; he had never been able to endure it. Whether from his upbringing, or out of a natural idiosyncrasy, he loathed the slamming of doors, and could have struck the guilty person. In this case, the door was filled in above with small glass panes, which augmented the shock with their ringing and rattling. “Oh, come,” he thought angrily, “what kind of damned carelessness was that?” But at the same time the seamstress addressed him with a remark, and he had no time to see who the transgressor had been. Deep creases furrowed his blond brows, and his face was contorted as he turned to reply to his neighbour.","Suddenly Hans Castorp flinched—he was annoyed and offended. A door, the one to his left that led to the lobby, had banged shut—someone had simply let it slam, or perhaps even slammed it intentionally, and that was a noise that Hans Castorp absolutely could not tolerate, he had always hated it. Perhaps it was a learned dislike, perhaps an inborn idiosyncrasy— whatever it was, he abhorred banging doors and could have slapped anyone guilty of slamming one within earshot. In this case, the door was divided into little glass panes, which only heightened the shock: it was a bang and a rattle. “Damn it,” Hans Castorp thought angrily, “what kind of sloppiness is that?” Since the seamstress had said something to him at the same moment, he had no chance to determine who the malefactor was. But as he answered the seamstress, there were deep furrows between his blond eyebrows and his face was wrenched with distress."

"Es war ein Anblick voll Grauen und Jammer. Sie katzbalgten sich wie kleine Jungen, aber mit der Verzweiflung erwachsener Männer, mit denen es dahin gekommen ist. Sie gingen einander mit den Krallen ins Gesicht, hielten sich an Nase und Kehle, während sie aufeinander losschlugen, umschlangen sich, wälzten sich in furchtbarem und radikalem Ernste am Boden, spieen nach einander, traten, stießen, zerrten, hieben und schäumten. Herbeigeeiltes Bureaupersonal trennte mit Mühe die Verbissenen und Verkrallten. Wiedemann, speichelnd und blutend, wutverblödeten Angesichts, zeigte das Phänomen der zu Berge stehenden Haare. Hans Castorp hatte das noch nie gesehen und nicht geglaubt, daß es eigentlich vorkomme. Die Haare standen Herrn Wiedemann starr und steif zu Berge, und so stürzte er davon, während Herr Sonnenschein, das eine Auge in Bläue verschwunden und eine blutende Lücke in dem Kranz {1039}lockigen schwarzen Haares, das seinen Schädel umgab, ins Bureau geführt wurde, wo er sich niederließ und bitterlich in seine Hände weinte.","It was a sight of horror and sorrow. They tussled like little boys, but with the desperation of grown men who've gotten it there. They clawed at each other's faces, held each other's noses and throats as they struck at each other, entwined, rolled on the ground in terrible and radical earnest, spat at one another, kicked, pushed, pulled, slashed and foamed. Office staff rushed to separate with difficulty the dogged and the clawed. Wiedemann, salivating and bleeding, face dazed with anger, showed the phenomenon of hair standing on end. Hans Castorp had never seen that before and didn't believe it actually happened. Herr Wiedemann's hair stood stiff and stiff on end, and so he tumbled away while Herr Sonnenschein, one eye gone blue and a bleeding gap in the wreath of curly black hair that surrounded his skull, was led into the office , where he sat down and wept bitterly into his hands.","It was a horrid sight. They scuffled like small boys, but with the grimness of grown men when things have got to such a pitch. They clawed at each other’s faces, clutched throats or noses, grappled, hewed loose from each other and rolled together on the floor, spat, kicked, worried, and foamed at the mouth. The “management” came running and by main strength dragged them asunder, scratched and bitten. Herr Wiedemann, bleeding and frothing, his face brutish with rage, displayed a phenomenon Hans Castorp had never before seen and had always supposed a figure of speech: his hair stood on end. He staggered away. Herr Sonnenschein, with one black eye, a bleeding lacuna in the curling black locks about his brow, was led into the bureau, where he sat down, buried his face in his hands and wept bitterly.","What a horrible, wretched sight they were. They scuffled like little boys, but with the desperation of grown men who have come to such a pass. They clawed faces, pinched noses, clutched throats, all the while punching away at one another, grappling, rolling about on the floor in terribly dead earnest; they spat, kicked, grabbed, trounced, whacked, and frothed at the mouth. Clerks from the management office came running and with some difficulty separated the two bitten and scratched opponents. Drooling and bleeding, his face doltish with rage, Wiedemann stood there with his hair literally standing on end. Hans Castorp had never seen the phenomenon before, had never believed it could really occur—but Herr Wiedemann’s hair stood up stiff and straight as nails. And he staggered away like that, while Herr Sonnenschein—with one eye turning black now and a bloody patch in the curly black hair that wreathed his head—was led away to the office, where he sat down, hid his face in his hands, and wept bitterly."
"Denn Naphta war ja außer Rand und Band mit seinen Vorschlägen. Er verlangte fünf Schritt Distanz und dreimaligen Kugelwechsel, falls es nötig sein sollte. Diesen Wahnsinn ließ er noch am Abend des Zerwürfnisses durch Wehsal überbringen, der sich völlig zum Mundstück und Vertreter seiner wilden Interessen gemacht hatte und teils im Auftrage, teils gewiß auch nach eigenem Geschmack mit größter Zähigkeit auf solchen Bedingungen bestand. Natürlich fand Settembrini nichts daran auszusetzen, aber Ferge, als Sekundant, und der unparteiische Hans Castorp waren außer sich, und dieser wurde sogar grob mit dem elenden Wehsal. Ob er sich nicht schäme, fragte er, solche wüsten Unannehmlichkeiten auszukramen, wo es sich um ein rein abstraktes Duell handle, dem gar keine Realinjurie zugrunde liege! Pistolen seien schon kraß genug, aber nun diese mörderischen Einzelheiten. Da höre die Ritterlichkeit auf, und ob man sich nicht gleich übers Schnupftuch schießen wolle! Er, Wehsal, solle ja nicht auf sich feuern lassen auf solche Entfernung, darum gehe ihm der Blutdurst wohl so leicht von den Lippen – und so fort. Wehsal zuckte die Achseln, wortlos andeutend, daß eben die radikale Situation vorliege, wodurch er denn die Gegenseite, die dies zu vergessen geneigt war, gewissermaßen entwaffnete. Immerhin gelang es dieser beim Hin und Her des folgenden Tages, vor allem den dreimaligen Kugelwechsel auf einen zurückzuführen, dann aber die Distanzfrage so zu regeln, daß die Kombattanten sich auf {1063}fünfzehn Schritte gegenüberstehen und das Recht haben sollten, fünf Schritte vorzugehen, bevor sie schössen. Aber auch dies wurde nur erreicht gegen die Zusicherung, daß keine Versöhnungsversuche gemacht werden sollten. Übrigens hatte man keine Pistolen.","Because Naphta was out of control with his suggestions. He demanded a five-step distance and three ball changes if necessary. He let this madness be conveyed on the evening of the quarrel by Wehsal, who had made himself the mouthpiece and representative of his wild interests and insisted on such conditions with the greatest tenacity, partly on orders and partly also to suit his own taste. Of course Settembrini found nothing wrong with it, but Ferge, as a second, and the impartial Hans Castorp were beside themselves, and the latter even got rude about the wretched misery. Wasn't he ashamed, he asked, of digging up such wild inconveniences when it was a question of a purely abstract duel, which was not based on any real injury at all! Pistols are crass enough, but now these murderous details. That's where the chivalry ends, and don't you want to shoot yourself over the handkerchief right away! He, Wehsal, shouldn't allow himself to be fired on from such a distance, that's why his thirst for blood runs so easily from his lips - and so on. Wehsal shrugged his shoulders, wordlessly implying that the situation was radical and in a way he disarmed the other side, who tended to forget it. Nevertheless, during the back and forth of the following day, he succeeded, above all, in reducing the three bullet changes to one, but then in regulating the distance question in such a way that the combatants should face each other at {1063}fifteen paces and should have the right to advance five paces, before they shoot. But even this was only achieved against assurances that no attempts at reconciliation should be made. By the way, they didn't have pistols.","For Naphta’s proposals went beyond all bounds. He demanded a distance of five paces, and, if necessary, three exchanges of fire. These insane conditions he sent by Wehsal the very evening of the quarrel; Wehsal had succeeded in fully identifying himself with Naphta’s mad ideas, and partly as representative, but certainly also in accordance with his personal taste, obstinately insisted upon them. Settembrini, of course, found nothing in them to object to. But Ferge, as second, and the neutral Hans Castorp, were beside themselves, and the latter fell heavily upon the wretched Wehsal. Was he not ashamed to bring forward such frantic and inhuman ideas to meet a case where the injury was purely abstract, not sensible at all? As though pistols were not bad enough, that they must add these murderous conditions! Where did the chivalrous mitigation come in? He might as well suggest firing across a handkerchief! He, Wehsal, was not going to be fired at five paces off—it was easy for him to be blood-thirsty! And so forth. Wehsal shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that precisely that extreme case was a contingency; thus reducing to silence Hans Castorp, who was inclined to forget the fact. But he succeeded, during the negotiations of the following day, in fixing the number of shots at one instead of three, and in dealing with the question of distance so as to arrange that the combatants should be placed fifteen paces apart, and have the right to advance five paces before firing. But in exchange for these concessions, he had to promise that no attempt should be made at reconciling the parties.—It was discovered that none of them had any pistols.","For Naphta was truly out of control in his suggestions. He demanded a distance of five paces and three exchanges of fire, if that should prove necessary. These mad proposals were delivered on the very evening of the argument by way of Wehsal, who turned out to be the perfect mouthpiece and representative for Naphta’s savage ideas and doggedly insisted on such conditions—in part because they suited his own tastes. Settembrini, of course, had no objections to any of it; but Ferge as his second and Hans Castorp as the neutral party were beside themselves, and the latter even turned abusive with wretched Wehsal. Was he not ashamed of himself, he asked, to come peddling such vile, unacceptable proposals when it was nothing but a purely abstract duel, based on no real injury whatever? Pistols were awful enough as it was, and then to add these murderous particulars. That definitely put an end to chivalry—why not go ahead and shoot at each other separated by only a handkerchief! He, Wehsal, was not the one who would be shot at from that distance, and so it was easy for him to be bloodthirsty—and so on. Wehsal gave a shrug, as if to say that this was, after all, a radical situation, thus more or less disarming his opponent, who was inclined to forget that fact. All the same, in tedious negotiations the following day, Hans Castorp managed to reduce the three exchanges of fire to one and to resolve the issue of distance by having the combatants stand fifteen paces apart, but with each retaining the right to step forward five paces before firing. Even that concession, however, was achieved only on the assurance that no attempt at reconciliation was to be made. By the way, none of them owned pistols."
"Hans Castorp hatte gefürchtet, die Zeit zu verschlafen, da er so überaus müde gewesen war, aber er war früher als nötig auf den Beinen und hatte Muße im Überfluß, seinen Morgengewohnheiten ausführlich nachzukommen, hochzivilisierten Gewohnheiten, unter denen eine Gummiwanne sowie eine Holzschale mit grüner Lavendelseife nebst zugehörigem Strohpinsel eine Hauptrolle spielten, – und mit den Geschäften der Säuberung und der Körperpflege das andere des Auspackens und Einräumens zu verbinden. Während er den versilberten Hobel über seine mit parfümiertem Schaum bedeckten Wangen führte, erinnerte er sich seiner verworrenen Träume und schüttelte nachsichtig lächelnd, mit dem Überlegenheitsgefühl des im Tageslicht der Vernunft sich rasierenden Menschen den Kopf über so viel Unsinn. Sehr ausgeruht fühlte er sich eben nicht, aber frisch mit dem jungen Tage.","Hans Castorp had feared oversleeping the time, since he had been so exceedingly tired, but he was up earlier than necessary and had plenty of leisure to follow his morning habits at length, highly civilized habits including a rubber tub and a wooden bowl of green Lavender soap and the straw brush that went with it played a leading role – and to combine the unpacking and putting away with the business of cleaning and body care. Raising the silver-plated plane over his perfumed foam-covered cheeks, he recalled his confused dreams and, smiling indulgently, shook his head at so much nonsense with the superiority of a man shaving in the daylight of reason. He didn't feel very rested, but fresh with the young day.","HE had been so utterly weary, he had feared to oversleep; but he was on his legs rather earlier than usual, and had a superfluity of leisure in which to perform the accustomed ritual of his morning toilet, in which a rubber tub, a wooden bowl of green lavender soap, and the accompanying little brush played the principal parts. He had even time to do some unpacking and moving in. As he covered his cheeks with scented lather and drew over them the blade of his silver-plated “safety,” he recalled his confused dreams and shook his head indulgently over so much nonsense, with the superior feeling a man has when shaving himself in the clear light of reason. He did not feel precisely rested, yet had a sense of morning freshness.","Hans Castorp had been afraid he would oversleep, he had been so thoroughly exhausted, but he was up and about earlier than necessary and had plenty of time leisurely to pursue his usual, highly civilized morning routine—its chief utensils included a rubber basin, a wooden bowl of green, lavender-scented soap, and a straw-colored brush—and was able not only to tend to matters of personal hygiene but also to unpack and put his things away. And as he passed the silver-plated blade across the perfumed foam on his cheeks, he recalled his muddled dreams and smiled an indulgent smile at such nonsense, shaking his head with the superiority of a man shaving by the light of reasonable day. He did not feel all that well rested, but fresh enough to meet the morning."
"»Die Herren sind aufgeräumt, – mit Grund, mit Grund. Ein prächtiger Morgen! Der Himmel ist blau, die Sonne lacht –« und er hob mit einem leichten und gelungenen Schwung seines Armes die kleine, gelbliche Hand zum Himmel, während er zugleich einen schrägen, heiteren Blick ebenfalls dort hinaufsandte. »Man könnte in der Tat vergessen, wo man sich befindet.«","“The gentlemen are in a good mood – with reason, with reason. A glorious morning! The sky is blue, the sun is smiling -' and with a light and successful swing of his arm he raised his small, yellowish hand to the sky, while at the same time he sent a slanting, cheerful look up there as well. ""Indeed, one might forget where one is.""","Settembrini said: “You are in good spirits—and with reason too, with excellent reason. What a splendid morning! A blue sky, a smiling sun—“with an easy, adequate motion of the arm he raised a small, yellowish-skinned hand to the heavens, and sent a lively glance upward after it—“one could almost forget where one is.”","Settembrini said, “The gentlemen are in high spirits—and with good cause, good cause. A splendid morning! The sky is blue, the sun is smiling.” And with an easy, felicitous wave of his arm he lifted his little, yellowish hand toward the heavens and simultaneously cast an oblique glance in the same upward direction. “One could in fact forget completely just where one is.”"
"Hans Castorp drehte die röhrenförmige Kaffeemühle zwischen den Händen. Sie war, wie die ganze Garnitur, wohl eher indischer oder persischer, als türkischer Herkunft: der Stil der in das Messing gearbeiteten Gravierungen, deren Flächen blank aus dem matt gehaltenen Grunde traten, deutete darauf hin. Hans Castorp betrachtete die Ornamentik, ohne gleich klug daraus werden zu können. Als er klug daraus geworden war, errötete er unversehens.","Hans Castorp turned the tubular coffee grinder between his hands. Like the rest of the set, it was probably of Indian or Persian rather than Turkish origin: the style of the engravings worked into the brass, the surfaces of which emerged bare from the matt background, indicated this. Hans Castorp looked at the ornamentation without being able to gain any insight from it. When he had figured it out, he suddenly blushed.","Hans Castorp turned the cylindrical coffee-mill about in his hands. It was, like the rest of the set, Indian or Persian rather than Turkish; the style of the engraving showed that, with the bright surface of the pattern standing out against the purposely dulled background. He looked at the design, without immediately seeing what it was. When he did, he blushed unawares.","Hans Castorp rolled the cylindrical coffee mill between his palms. Like all the furnishings in the room, its origin was probably more Indian or Persian than Turkish—certainly the style of its brass engraving, the surface pattern shiny against the dull background, suggested as much. Hans Castorp studied the design, without making much of it at first. When he suddenly did make something of it, he blushed."
"Dieses »Kabinett« war dadurch entstanden, daß man das Eßzimmer dreifenstrig gemacht und durch die ganze Breite des Hauses gelegt hatte, weshalb nicht, wie sonst bei diesem Haustypus, Raum für drei Salons, sondern nur für zwei übrigge{37}blieben war, von denen jedoch der eine, senkrecht zum Eßsaal gelegene, mit nur einem Fenster nach der Straße, unverhältnismäßig tief ausgefallen wäre. Darum hatte man etwa den vierten Teil seiner Länge von ihm abgesondert, eben das »Kabinett«, einen schmalen Raum mit Oberlicht, dämmerig und nur mit wenigen Gegenständen ausgestattet: einer Etagere, auf der des Senators Zigarrenschrank stand, einem Spieltisch, dessen Schublade anziehende Dinge enthielt: Whistkarten, Spielmarken, kleine Markierbrettchen mit aufklappbaren Zähnchen, eine Schiefertafel nebst Kreidegriffeln, papierne Zigarrenspitzen und anderes mehr; endlich mit einem Rokoko-Glasschrank aus Palisanderholz in der Ecke, hinter dessen Scheiben gelbseidene Vorhänge gespannt waren.","This ""cabinet"" was created by making the dining room three-windowed and laying it across the entire width of the house, which is why there was only room for two living rooms instead of three, as is usually the case with this type of house where, however, the one perpendicular to the dining room, with only one window facing the street, would have been disproportionately low. That is why about a fourth part of its length had been separated from it, the ""cabinet,"" a narrow room with a skylight, dim and furnished with only a few objects: an etagere on which the senator's cigar cabinet stood, a gaming table, and its drawer with attractive things contained: whist cards, tokens, small marker boards with opening teeth, a slate with chalk styli, paper cigar holders and much more; finally with a rococo glass cabinet made of rosewood in the corner, with yellow silk curtains stretched behind the panes.","This office had come to exist because of a peculiarity in the arrangement of the lower floor—namely, that the dining-room had been planned with three windows instead of two, and ran the whole width of the house; which left space for only two drawing-rooms, instead of the usual three, and gave to one of them, at right angles to the dining-room, with a single window on the street, a quite disproportionate depth. Of this room, therefore, some quarter of the length had been cut off, and turned into a cabinet. It was a strip of a room, with a skylight; twilighted, and not much furnished—there was an étagère, on which stood the Senator’s cigar case; a cardtable, the drawer of which held whist cards, counters, little marking-boards with tiny teeth that clapped open and shut, a slate and slate-pencil, paper cigar-holders, and other such attractions; and finally, in the corner, a rococo case in palisander-wood, with yellow silk stretched behind its glass doors.","This “den” was the result of the dining room’s having been designed with three windows, so that it extended across the full width of the house, thus leaving no space for three drawing rooms, as was usual with this style of house, but for only two, one of which, placed at right angles to the dining room, would have been disproportionately deep, with only one window to the street. This was why one quarter of its length had been partitioned off, forming the “den,” a dim, narrow room lit by a skylight and furnished with only a few items: a whatnot stand for the senator’s cigar cabinet, a card table with a drawer full of enticing objects—a deck of whist cards, game tokens, scorecards with little hinged stands, a slate and chalk styluses, paper cigar holders, and other things, too—and finally, set back in one corner, a rococo china cabinet made of rosewood, with yellow silk curtains pulled across the inside of its window-panes."
"Joachim nickte und zuckte mit seinen bloßen Schultern, obgleich er hätte einwenden können, daß er ja keineswegs erst seit gestern hier oben sei.","Joachim nodded and shrugged his bare shoulders, although he could have objected that he hadn't been up here since yesterday.",Joachim nodded and shrugged his bare shoulders. He refrained from saying that he had been up here since a good deal longer than yesterday.,"Joachim nodded and gave a shrug of his bare shoulders, although he might have protested that he hadn’t arrived up here only the day before."
"Eigentlich war es schön von Herrn Settembrini, daß er unter solchen Umständen auf Hans Castorp zutrat, um ihn in ein Gespräch zu ziehen und nach seinem Ergehen zu fragen; aber es ist zweifelhaft, ob dieser die menschenfreundliche Vorurteilslosigkeit, die darin lag, dankbar zu würdigen wußte. Es mochte im Vestibül sein, am Sonntagnachmittag. Beim Concierge drängten sich die Gäste und streckten die Hände nach ihrer Post. Auch Joachim war dort vorn. Sein Vetter war zurückgeblieben und trachtete in der beschriebenen Verfassung, einen Blick Clawdia Chauchats zu gewinnen, die mit ihrer Tischgesellschaft in der Nähe stand, wartend, daß das Gedräng an der Loge sich lichten möge. Es war eine Stunde, die die Kurgäste durcheinandermischte, eine Stunde der Gelegenheiten, geliebt und ersehnt aus diesem Grunde von dem jungen Hans Castorp. Vor acht Tagen war er am Schalter in sehr nahe Berührung mit Madame Chauchat gekommen, so daß sie ihn sogar etwas gestoßen und mit flüchtiger Kopfwendung »Pardon« zu ihm ge{364}sagt hatte, – worauf er kraft einer febrilen Geistesgegenwart, die er segnete, zu antworten vermocht hatte:","Actually, it was nice of Herr Settembrini to approach Hans Castorp under such circumstances in order to engage him in conversation and ask how he was doing; but it is doubtful whether he gratefully appreciated the philanthropic impartiality that lay in it. It might be in the vestibule, on a Sunday afternoon. At the concierge, guests crowded and reached for their mail. Joachim was there too. His cousin had stayed behind and, in the state described, was trying to catch a glimpse of Clawdia Chauchat, who was standing nearby with her dinner party, waiting for the crowd at the box to clear. It was an hour that mixed up the spa guests, an hour of opportunities, loved and longed for by young Hans Castorp for this reason. A week ago he had come into very close contact with Madame Chauchat at the counter, so that she even pushed him a little and said ""Pardon"" to him with a hasty turn of her head - whereupon he had a febrile presence of mind, which he blessed , had been able to answer:","It was really splendid of Herr Settembrini, under these circumstances, to go up to Hans Castorp, engage him in conversation, and ask him how he did. But it is doubtful whether the young man knew how to value and to be grateful for such benevolence and freedom from prejudice. One Sunday afternoon the guests were thronging about the porter’s lodge, stretching out their hands for letters. Joachim was among the foremost; but Hans Castorp had stopped in the rear, angling, in the fashion we have described, for a look from Clavdia Chauchat. She was standing near by, among a group of her table-mates, waiting until the press about the lodge should be lightened. It was an hour when all the patients mingled, an hour rich in opportunity, and for that reason beloved of our young man. The week before, he had stood at the window so close to Madame Chauchat that she had in fact jostled him, and then, with a little bow, had said: “Pardon.”","Given this state of affairs, it was actually a good thing that Herr Settembrini would sometimes approach Hans Castorp and start up a conversation, asking him how he was feeling; but it is doubtful whether the younger man knew what thanks he owed him for this humane broad-mindedness. It might happen, for instance, in the lobby on a Sunday afternoon. . . . The guests were pressing around the concierge’s desk, hands stretched out for their mail. Joachim was up front with them. His cousin held back, busy watching it all in the state described above, trying to catch Clavdia Chauchat’s eye. She was standing nearby with her tablemates, waiting for the crowd at the desk to thin out. It was an hour when all the patients mingled, an hour of opportunities, and for precisely that reason an hour that young Hans Castorp loved and longed for. The week before, he had been so close to Madame Chauchat at the desk that she had bumped against him just the least bit and with a cursory turn of her head had said, “Pardon.”"
"»Abgemacht!« quäkte die Oberin. »Nur nicht knausern bei wichtigen Anschaffungen! Eilt nicht, es kommt auf die Rechnung. Geben Sie her, wir wollen ihn erst noch recht klein machen, ganz hinunterjagen – so.« Und sie nahm ihm das Thermometer aus der Hand, stieß es wiederholt in die Luft und trieb so das Quecksilber noch tiefer, bis unter 35 hinab. »Wird schon steigen, wird schon emporwandern, der Merkurius!« {257}sagte sie. »Hier haben Sie Ihre Erwerbung!

'Here is your acquisition! You know how we do it, don't you? Put it under your tongue, for seven minutes, four times a day, and close your lips tightly around it. Good-bye, man! Good results!' And she was out of the room.","“Then that’s settled,” croaked the Directress. “I see you don’t niggle over important purchases. No hurry, it will come on the bill. Give him to me. We’ll drive him right down”—She took the thermometer out of his hand and plunged it several times through the air, until the mercury stood below 95°. “He’ll soon climb up again!” she said. “Here is your new acquisition. You know how we do it up here? Straight under the tongue, seven minutes, four times a day, and shut the lips well over it. Well, young ’un, I must get on. Good luck!” And she was out at the door.","“That settles that!” the head nurse squawked. “Never be niggardly when it comes to important procurements. No hurry —it will be on your bill. Give it to me, we need to shrink him down to nothing, all the way down—like this.” And she took the thermometer out of his hand, thrusting it at the air several times and driving the mercury down even further, below ninety-five degrees. “He’ll climb back up, wander right up the column, old Mercury will,” she said. “Here is your purchase. You do know, don’t you, how we do things up here? We put it under our pretty tongue, for seven minutes, four times a day, and keep our lips nicely tucked around it. Adieu! Good man alive, my best wishes for good results.” And she was out of the room."
"»Laß das gut sein, Clawdia. Ich bin natürlich von Hause aus kein homme de génie, so wenig wie ich ein Mann von Format bin, du lieber Gott, nein. Aber dann bin ich durch Zufall – nenne es Zufall – so hoch heraufgetrieben worden in diese genialen Gegenden … Mit einem Worte, du weißt wohl nicht, daß es etwas wie die alchimistisch-hermetische Pädagogik gibt, Transsubstantiation, und zwar zum Höheren, Steigerung also, wenn du mich recht verstehen willst. Aber natürlich, ein Stoff, der dazu taugen soll, durch äußere Einwirkungen zum Höheren hinaufgetrieben und –gezwängt zu werden, der muß es {903}wohl im voraus ein bißchen in sich haben. Und was ich in mir hatte, das war, ich weiß es genau, daß ich von langer Hand her mit der Krankheit und dem Tode auf vertrautem Fuße stand und mir schon als Knabe unvernünftigerweise einen Bleistift von dir lieh, wie hier in der Faschingsnacht. Aber die unvernünftige Liebe ist genial, denn der Tod, weißt du, ist das geniale Prinzip, die res bina, der lapis philosophorum, und er ist auch das pädagogische Prinzip, denn die Liebe zu ihm führt zur Liebe des Lebens und des Menschen. So ist es, in meiner Balkonloge ist es mir aufgegangen, und ich bin entzückt, daß ich es dir sagen kann. Zum Leben gibt es zwei Wege: Der eine ist der gewöhnliche, direkte und brave. Der andere ist schlimm, er führt über den Tod, und das ist der geniale Weg!«","'Never mind, Clawdia. Of course I'm not a homme de génie by nature, just as I'm not a man of stature, dear God, no. But then by coincidence - call it coincidence - I was pushed so high up into these brilliant regions... In a word, you probably don't know that there is something like alchemical-hermetic pedagogy, transubstantiation, and indeed to the higher, i.e. increase, if you want to understand me correctly But of course, a substance that is supposed to be suitable for being pushed and forced upwards to higher levels by external influences must {903}be a bit in itself beforehand. And what I had in me was, I know for sure, that I had been on familiar terms with illness and death for a long time and that even as a boy I unreasonably borrowed a pencil from you, like here on Mardi Gras night. But unreasonable love is genius because death, you know, is the genius principle, the res bina, the lapis philosophorum, and it is also the pedagogical principle, because love for it leads to love of life and of man. That's how it is, it dawned on me in my balcony box, and I'm delighted that I can tell you. There are two ways to life: One is the ordinary, direct and good. The other is bad, it leads through death, and that is the way of genius!«","“Don’t, Clavdia. I am no homme de génie— as little as I am a personality. Lord, no. But chance—call it chance—brought me up here to these heights of the spirit—you, of course, do not know that there is such a thing as alchemistic-hermetic pedagogy, transubstantiation, from lower to higher, ascending degrees, if you understand what I mean. But of course matter that is capable of taking those ascending stages by dint of outward pressure must have a little something in itself to start with. And what I had in me, as I quite clearly know, was that from long ago, even as a lad, I was familiar with illness and death, and had in the face of all common sense borrowed a lead pencil from you, as I did again on carnival night. But unreasoning love is spirituel; for death is the spirituel principle, the res bina, the lapis philosophorum, and the pedagogic principle too, for love of it leads to love of life and love of humanity. Thus, as I have lain in my loge, it has been revealed to me, and I am enchanted to be able to tell you all about it. There are two paths to life: one is the regular one, direct, honest. The other is bad, it leads through death—that is the spirituel way.”","“Enough of that, Clavdia. I am certainly no homme de génie by birth, any more than I am a man of stature—good God, no. But purely by chance—let us call it chance—I have been forced upward into these regions where genius flourishes. In a word—though you probably are not aware that there is such a thing as alchemistic, hermetic pedagogy—an enhancement, a transubstantiation to something higher, if you understand what I mean. Naturally, the substance that is forced upward by the application of external influences must have a little something to it to begin with. And I know very well just what there was to me: I have been an intimate of sickness and death for a very long time, and even as a boy I borrowed a pencil from you, in the same irrational way I did again on that Mardi Gras night. But irrational love is a mark of genius, because death, you see, is the principle of genius, the res bina, the lapis philosophorum, and it is also the pedagogic principle. For the love of death leads to the love of life and humanity. That is how it is. It came to me up on my balcony, and I am delighted to be able to tell it to you. There are two ways to life: the one is the regular, direct, and good way. The other is bad, it leads through death, and that is the way of genius.”"

"Hans Castorp mußte plötzlich erkennen, daß Peeperkorn schwer betrunken war. Doch wirkte auch seine Betrunkenheit nicht gering und beschämend, nicht als Entwürdigungszustand, sondern verband sich mit der Majestät seiner Natur zu einer großartigen und ehrfurchtgebietenden Erscheinung. Auch Bacchus selbst, dachte Hans Castorp, stützte sich betrunken auf seine enthusiastischen Begleiter, ohne darum an Gott{855}heit einzubüßen, und im höchsten Grade kam es darauf an, wer betrunken war, eine Persönlichkeit oder ein Leineweber. Er hütete sich innerlichst, im Respekt vor dem erdrückenden Reisebegleiter im geringsten nachzulassen, dessen Kulturgebärden schlaff geworden waren und dessen Zunge lallte.","Hans Castorp suddenly realized that Peeperkorn was very drunk. Yet his drunkenness did not appear small and shameful, not as a state of degradation, but combined with the majesty of his nature to create a magnificent and awe-inspiring appearance. Even Bacchus himself, thought Hans Castorp, leaned drunkenly on his enthusiastic companions without losing his divinity, and it depended in the highest degree on who was drunk, whether a personality or a linen weaver. Inwardly he was careful not to slacken his respect for the oppressive travel companion, whose cultural gestures had become slack and whose tongue was slurring.","Hans Castorp was suddenly driven to realize that Peeperkorn was very drunk. Still, his drunkenness was not debasing, there was no loss of dignity; rather it combined with the nobility of his nature to produce an immense and awe-inspiring effect. Bacchus himself, thought Hans Castorp, without detriment to his godhead, leaned for support on the shoulders of his troop. Everything depended upon who was drunk—a drunken personality was far from being the same as a drunken tinker. He took care not to abate, even inwardly, his respect for this overwhelming person, whose gestures had grown lax, and his tongue stammering.","Hans Castorp was suddenly confronted with the realization that Peeperkorn was very drunk. And yet his drunkenness did not belittle or demean him, caused him no disgrace, but rather, when joined with the majesty of his nature, it only made him grander and more awe-inspiring. Even drunken Bacchus, Hans Castorp thought, had propped himself on his exuberant companions without losing anything of his divinity, and ultimately it depended on who was drunk—a personality or a tinker. He steeled himself against any loss of respect for this overwhelming traveling companion, whose cultured gestures had grown flaccid and whose tongue was thick."

"Das seien keine »menschenähnlichen Wesen«, belehrte ihn Herr Settembrini; es seien Menschen, wie er, der Ingenieur, und wie der Redende selbst, – nur willensschwach und Opfer einer fehlerhaften Gesellschaft. Und er erzählte von einem Schwerverbrecher, einem vielfachen Mörder, jenem Typ zugehörig, den die Staatsanwälte in ihren Plädoyers als »vertiert«, als »Bestien in Menschengestalt« zu bezeichnen pflegten. Dieser Mann hatte die Wände seiner Zelle mit Versen bedeckt. Und sie waren keineswegs schlecht gewesen, diese Verse, – viel besser als die, welche von Staatsanwälten wohl gelegentlich angefertigt wurden.","They weren't ""human beings,"" Herr Settembrini informed him; they are people like him, the engineer, and like the speaker himself - just weak-willed and victims of a flawed society. And he told of a criminal, a multiple murderer, of the type prosecutors used to call ""verted"" in their pleadings, ""beasts in human form."" This man had covered the walls of his cell with verse. And they were by no means bad, these verses - much better than those which prosecutors probably occasionally wrote.","They were not “certain half-human beings” Settembrini corrected him. They were men, like the Engineer, like himself, Settembrini—only weak-willed victims of a defective social system. He cited the case of an abandoned criminal, the kind always referred to by the prosecuting attorneys as a “beast in human form,” who had covered the walls of his cell with verse, and not at all bad verse either, much better than most prosecuting attorneys ever managed to write.","Those were not “subhuman creatures,” Herr Settembrini informed him. They were human beings like the engineer, like himself—although weak-willed victims of an imperfect society. And he told them about a hardened criminal, a mass murderer, the sort of man prosecutors loved to portray in their closing arguments as a “brute” and a “beast in human form.” The man had covered the walls of his cell with verses. And they hadn’t been bad verses, either—much better than those occasionally penned by prosecutors."
"Jenen Anflug von Betroffenheit oder Verstimmung beim Gewahrwerden der jungen Leute hatte Settembrini sofort mit Eleganz überwunden. Er zeigte sich in der besten Laune und machte die drei unter Scherzreden bekannt, – zum Beispiel bezeichnete er Naphta als »Princeps scholasticorum«. Die Fröhlichkeit, sagte er, »halte glanzvoll Hof im Saale seiner Brust«, wie Aretino sich ausgedrückt habe, und das sei des Frühlings Verdienst, eines Frühlings, den er sich lobe. Die Herren wüßten, daß er gegen die Welt hier oben manches auf dem Herzen habe, sooft er es sich bereits davon heruntergeredet. Ehre jedoch dem Hochgebirgsfrühling! – vorübergehend vermöge er ihn mit allen Greueln dieser Sphäre zu versöhnen. Da fehle alles Verwirrende und Aufreizende des Frühlings der Ebene. Kein Gebrodel in der Tiefe! Keine feuchten Düfte, kein schwüler Dunst! Sondern Klarheit, Trockenheit, Heiterkeit und herbe Anmut. Es sei nach seinem Herzen, es sei süperb!","Settembrini elegantly overcame any hint of dismay or irritation when he saw the young people. He showed himself to be in the best of spirits, and introduced the three to jokes—for example, he referred to Naphta as ""Princeps scholasticorum."" Cheerfulness, he said, ""gloriously hold court in the hall of his breast,"" as Aretino put it, and that is the merit of spring, a spring that he praises. The gentlemen knew that he had a lot on his mind about the world up here, as often as he talked it down to himself. However, honor to the high mountain spring! - temporarily he can reconcile him with all the horrors of this sphere. It lacks everything that is confusing and provocative about the springtime of the plain. No seething in the depths! No damp scents, no sultry haze! But clarity, dryness, cheerfulness and austere grace. It's up to his heart, it's super!","Herr Settembrini at once and elegantly overcame the hint of embarrassment or vexation he had betrayed at first sight of the young people. He was in his gayest mood, and made all sorts of jesting allusions as he performed the introductions—for example, he called Naphta “princeps scholasticorum.” Joy, he said, quoting Aretine, held brilliant court within his, Settembrini’s, breast; a joy due to the blessing of the springtime—to which commend him. The gentlemen knew he had a certain grudge against life up here often enough he had railed against it!—All honour, then, to the mountain spring! It was enough of itself to atone for all the horrors of the place. All the disquieting, provocative elements of spring in the valley were here lacking: here were no seething depths, no steaming air, no oppressive humidity! Only dryness, clarity, a serene and piercing charm. It was after his own heart, it was superb.","Settembrini had at once elegantly overcome any trace of the embarrassment or annoyance he had shown upon first seeing the young men. He seemed in the best of moods and wittily helped all three get better acquainted—calling Naphta a “princeps scholasticorum,” for example. Mirth, he claimed, quoting Aretino, “held brilliant court in the hall of his breast” today—and that was the work of spring, a spring that he could only praise. As the gentlemen knew, he harbored considerable ill will against the world up here, had surely disparaged it often enough. Yet one must give the Alpine spring its due—for the moment, spring was atoning for all the horrors of the region. There was none of the confusion and provocation of spring down on the plains—no seething in the depths, no damp odors, no sultry vapors. And instead—clarity, serenity, a dry, austere charm. It was all to his taste, it was superb!"

"Tatsächlich waren alle in tiefster Seele ergriffen und beschämt. Er hatte die Hände vor der Brust über dem schmalen Kinnbart gefaltet und das Haupt schräg geneigt. Sein blasser Blick hatte sich gebrochen bei dem, was an einsamem Todesschmerz von seinen zerrissenen Lippen gekommen. Frau Stöhr schluchzte. Frau Magnus stieß einen hohen Seufzer aus. Staatsanwalt Paravant sah sich veranlaßt, vertretungsweise, gleichsam als Abgeordneter der Gesellschaft, einige Worte mit gesenkter Stimme an den verehrten Gastgeber zu richten, um ihn der allgemeinen Gefolgschaft zu versichern. Hier müsse ein Irrtum vorliegen. Man sei frisch und munter, flott, fidel und bei der Sache mit Herz und Sinn. Es sei ein so schöner, festlicher, schlechthin außerordentlicher Abend, – alle verständen und empfänden das, und niemand denke vorläufig daran, von dem Lebensgute des Schlafs Gebrauch zu machen. Mynheer Peeperkorn könne sich auf seine Gäste verlassen, auf jeden einzelnen von ihnen.","In fact, everyone was deeply moved and ashamed. He had clasped his hands in front of his chest over his narrow goatee and tilted his head to one side. His pale gaze had broken at the lonely pain of death that came from his torn lips. Frau Stoehr sobbed. Mrs. Magnus let out a deep sigh. Prosecutor Paravant felt compelled to address a few words in a lowered voice to the honored host as a representative, as if he were a representative of the company, in order to assure him of the general following. There must be a mistake here. One is fresh and lively, brisk, jolly and in the matter with heart and mind. It is such a beautiful, festive, absolutely extraordinary evening - everyone understands and feels that, and for the time being no one is thinking of making use of the good life of sleep. Mynheer Peeperkorn can rely on its guests, on each and every one of them.","In truth, they were all cut to the quick, they were crushed. He had folded his hands across his chest, upon His scanty beard, and laid his head on one side. His eyes had grown dim with feeling as the words expressive of the lonely anguish of death fell from his chapped lips. Frau Stöhr sobbed. Frau Magnus heaved a heavy sigh. Lawyer Paravant saw it was incumbent upon him to represent the sense of the meeting. In a voice solemnly sunk, he assured their honoured host that the circle was his to command. Herr Peeperkorn mistook them. Here they were, blithe as the dawn, jolly as sand-boys, ready for anything. This, he said, was a priceless evening, so festive, so out of the ordinary. Such was their feeling, and no one of them had any present idea of availing himself of life’s good gift of sleep. Mynheer Peeperkorn could count on them, one and all.","And indeed they were all profoundly moved and embarrassed. He had crossed his hands over his breast and scant beard, his head tilted to one side. His pale eyes had faltered as those words spoken from the throes of lonely death crossed his ragged lips. Frau Stöhr sobbed. Frau Magnus heaved a great sigh. Prosecutor Paravant felt it incumbent upon him, as the party’s representative as it were, to speak in their behalf, to offer in a low voice a few words to their honored host. There must be some mistake here. They were fresh and alert, gay and merry, engaged with all their hearts and souls. It was such a lovely, festive, absolutely extraordinary evening—they all understood and felt it, and for now no one would even think of making use of the gift of life called sleep. Mynheer Peeperkorn could depend on his guests, on every single one of them."

"»Ja, das wollen wir«, pflichtete er bei und schaute neben ihr hin, mit seinem bleichen Gesicht, mit den blauen, sinnig blikkenden Augen seines Großvaters, in das Gehüpf der maskierten Patienten hier im Salon und drüben im Schreibzimmer. Da hüpfte die Stumme Schwester mit dem Blauen Heinrich, und Frau Salomon, die als Ballherr, in Frack und weiße Weste, gekleidet war, mit hochgewölbter Hemdbrust, gemaltem Schnurrbart und Monokel, drehte sich auf kleinen Lack-Stökkelschuhen, die unnatürlicherweise aus ihren schwarzen Her{510}renhosen hervorkamen, mit dem Pierrot, dessen Lippen blutrot in seinem geweißten Antlitz leuchteten und dessen Augen denen eines Albino-Kaninchens glichen. Der Grieche im Mäntelchen schwang das Ebenmaß seiner lila Trikotbeine um den dekolletierten und dunkel glitzernden Rasmussen; der Staatsanwalt im Kimono, die Generalkonsulin Wurmbrandt und der junge Gänser tanzten sogar selbdritt, indem sie sich mit den Armen umschlungen hielten; und was die Stöhr betraf, so tanzte sie mit ihrem Besen, den sie ans Herz drückte und dessen Borsten sie liebkoste, als wären sie eines Menschen aufrecht stehendes Haupthaar gewesen.","""Yes, we want that,"" he agreed, looking beside her, with his pale face, with his grandfather's blue, pensive eyes, at the pacing of the masked patients here in the drawing room and over in the study. Then the mute sister hopped around with Blue Heinrich, and Frau Salomon, who was dressed as the ball master, in tails and a white waistcoat, with a high arched shirt front, painted mustache and monocle, turned around on little patent-leather heeled shoes that unnaturally protruded from her black hearts {510}reindeer pants came out with which Pierrot, whose lips gleamed crimson in his whitened countenance, and whose eyes resembled those of an albino rabbit. The Greek in the little coat swung the proportions of his purple jersey legs around the low-cut and darkly glittering Rasmussen; the prosecutor in kimono, Consul General Wurmbrandt and the young goose even danced the three of them holding each other's arms; and as for Stohr, she danced with her broomstick, which she pressed to her heart and whose bristles she caressed as if they had been a man's standing hair.","“Yes, let’s,” he assented, and gazed beyond her, with his blue eyes, his grandfather’s musing eyes, in his pale young face, at the antics of the masked patients in salon and writing-room.

The Greek flourished his symmetrical legs in their lavender tights alongside the darkly glittering Rasmussen in his low-cut gown. Lawyer Paravant in his kimono, Frau ConsulGeneral Wurmbrandt, and young Gänser danced all three together, with their arms round each other.

"Er riß die Augen auf, verwirrt von der Tiefe seiner Entrückt{189}heit. »Ich glaube, ich habe geträumt!« dachte er. »Ja, das war Pribislav. Lange habe ich nicht mehr an ihn gedacht. Wo sind die Schnitzel hingekommen? Das Pult ist auf dem Boden, zu Hause bei Onkel Tienappel. Sie müssen noch in der inneren kleinen Schublade links hinten sein. Ich habe sie nie herausgenommen. Nicht einmal soviel Aufmerksamkeit, sie wegzuwerfen, erwies ich ihnen … Es war ganz Pribislav, wie er leibte und lebte. Ich hätte nicht gedacht, daß ich ihn je so deutlich wiedersehen würde. Wie merkwürdig ähnlich er ihr sah, – dieser hier oben! Darum also interessiere ich mich so für sie? Oder vielleicht auch: habe ich mich darum so für ihn interessiert? Unsinn! Ein schöner Unsinn.

""I think I dreamed!"" he thought. 'Yes, that was Pribislav. I haven't thought about him for a long time. Where did the schnitzel go? The desk is on the floor, at Uncle Tienappel's house. They must still be in the inner small drawer at the back left. I never took them out. I didn't even pay them enough attention to throw them away... It was all Pribislav as he lived. I didn't think I would ever see him so clearly again. How strangely like her he looked - this one up here! So that's why I'm so interested in her? Or maybe also: was that why I was so interested in him? Nonsense! Nice nonsense. By the way, I have to go, and as soon as possible.' But he stayed lying there, thinking and remembering. Then he straightened up. ""Well, farewell and thank you!"" he said, tears welling up in his eyes as he smiled. With that he wanted to leave; but he quickly sat down again, hat and cane in hand, for he had noticed that his knees were not quite supporting him. ""Oops,"" he thought, ""I don't think that's going to work! And I'm supposed to be in the dining room for the lecture at eleven sharp. Walking here has its beauty but also its difficulties, it seems. Yes, yes, but I can't stay here. It's just that I've gotten a little lame from lying down; it will get better with movement.” And he tried again to get to his feet, and since he pulled himself together, it worked.","He wrenched his eyes open, amazed at the depths of the trance in which he had been sunk. “I’ve been dreaming,” he thought. “Yes, that was Pribislav. It’s a long time since I thought of him. I wonder what became of the shavings. My desk is in the attic at Uncle Tienappel’s; they must be there yet, in the little inner back drawer. I never took them out, never thought enough about them to throw them away! That was certainly Pribislav, his very own self. I shouldn’t have thought I could remember him so clearly. How remarkably like her he looked—like this girl up here! Is that why I feel interested in her? Or was that why I felt so interested in him? What rubbish! Anyhow, I must be stirring, and pretty fast, too.” But he lay another moment, musing and recalling, before he got up. “Then thank ye kindly, and God be with ye,” he said—the tears came to his eyes as he smiled And with that he would have been off, but instead sat suddenly down again with his hat and stick in his hand, being forced to the realization that his knees would not support him. “Hullo,” he thought, “this won’t do. I am supposed to be back in the dining-room punctually at eleven, for the lecture. Taking walks up here is very beautiful—but appears to have its difficult side. Well, well, I can’t stop here. I must have got stiff from lying; I shall be better as I move about.” He tried again to get on his legs and, by dint of great effort, succeeded.","He opened his eyes wide, confused by the depth of his trance. “I suppose I was dreaming,” he thought. “Yes, that was Pribislav. I haven’t thought of him in a long time. What ever became of those shavings? The desk is up in the attic at Uncle Tienappel’s. They must still be in that same little drawer, clear at the back on the left. I never removed them. Didn’t even pay them enough attention to throw them out. It was Pribislav , it was him all over. I never would have thought that I’d see him so clearly again. And he looked so strangely like her—that woman up here. Is that why I’ve been so intrigued by her? Or maybe that’s why I was suddenly so interested in him. What nonsense. What a lot of nonsense. I’ve got to be on my way, and I mean right now. ” But he lay there a while longer, pondering and remembering. Then he sat up. “Well, fare thee well and much obliged!” he said out loud, and tears came to his eyes even as he smiled. And with that he stood up to go, and just as quickly sat back down, hat and cane in hand, forced to admit that his knees couldn’t support him. “Whoops,” he thought, “I don’t think that’s going to work. And I’m supposed to be at the lecture in the dining hall at eleven on the dot. A long walk up here can be lovely, but it has its drawbacks, too, it seems. Yes, indeed—but I can’t stay here. It’s just that I’m a little stiff from lying down; it will get better once I’m moving.” And he tried to get to his feet again—and making a concerted effort to pull himself together, he succeeded."

"Naphta, der seinen Pelzmantel in den Schnee geworfen hatte, so daß man das Nerzfutter sah, trat, die Pistole in der Hand, auf einen der äußeren Absatzstriche, sobald er nur gezogen war und während Ferge an weiteren Markierungen noch arbeitete.

Hans Castorp wrenched himself out of his paralysis and quickly stepped forward once again."
"»Ja, Ihnen traue ich’s zu; Sie sind ein anständiger Mensch«, sagte Settembrini. »So, so, so«, sagte er dreimal mit scharfem S, indem er sich wieder gegen Hans Castorp wandte, und schnalzte dann ebensooft mit der Zunge leise am oberen Gaumen. »Sieh, sieh, sieh«, sagte er hierauf, ebenfalls dreimal und mit scharfem S-Laut, indem er dem Neuling so unverwandt ins Gesicht blickte, daß seine Augen in eine fixe und blinde Einstellung gerieten, und fuhr dann, seinen Blick wieder belebend, fort:","“Yes, I trust you; You're a decent man,' Settembrini said. ""So, so, so,"" he said three times with a sharp S, turning back to Hans Castorp, and then just as often clicked his tongue softly on the upper palate.

Turning again to Hans Castorp, he clicked his tongue softly an equal number of times. “I see, I see, I see,” he now said in another triplet of sharp s’s, gazing at the newcomer so steadily that his eyes took on a fixed, vacant look; but then life returned to them again and he went on, “"

"Der Saal war in jenem neuzeitlichen Geschmack gehalten, welcher der sachlichsten Einfachheit einen gewissen phantastischen Einschlag zu geben weiß. Er war nicht sehr tief im Verhältnis zu seiner Länge und von einer Art Wandelgang umlaufen, in dem Anrichten standen und der sich in großen Bögen gegen den Innenraum mit den Tischen öffnete. Die Pfeiler, bis zu halber Höhe mit Holz in Sandelpolitur bekleidet, dann glatt geweißt, wie der obere Teil der Wände und die Decke, wiesen buntfarbige Bandstreifen auf, einfältige und lustige Schablonen, die sich an den weitgespannten Gurten des flachen Gewölbes fortsetzten. Mehrere Kronenleuchter, elektrisch, aus blankem Messing, schmückten den Saal, bestehend aus je drei übereinander gelagerten Reifen, welche mit zierlichem Flechtwerk verbunden waren und an deren unterstem wie kleine Monde Milchglasglocken im Kreise gingen. Es waren vier Glastüren da, – an der entgegengesetzten Breitseite zwei, die hinaus auf eine vorgelagerte Veranda gingen, eine dritte vorn links, die geradeswegs in die vordere Halle führte, und dann jene, durch die Hans Castorp von einem Flur aus eingetreten war, da Joachim ihn eine andere Treppe hinabgeführt hatte, als gestern abend.","The hall was furnished in that modern taste which knows how to give a certain fantastic touch to the most objective simplicity. It was not very deep in relation to its length and was surrounded by a kind of gallery with sideboards and which opened in large arches towards the interior with the tables. The pillars, clad halfway up in wood polished with sandalwood, then whitewashed smooth, like the upper part of the walls and the ceiling, sported bands of brightly colored bands, simple and amusing stencils, which continued along the wide girders of the flat vault. Several chandeliers, electric, made of bright brass, adorned the hall, each consisting of three superimposed hoops, which were connected with delicate braiding and on the bottom of which frosted glass bells went in circles like small moons. There were four glass doors there--on the opposite broadside two leading out onto a front porch, a third forward on the left leading straight into the front hall, and then the one through which Hans Castorp had entered from a hallway, there Joachim had led him down a different set of stairs than last night.","The hall was done in that modern style which knows how to give just the right touch of individuality to something in reality very simple. It was rather shallow in proportion to its length, and opened in great arched bays into a sort of lobby surrounding it, in which serving-tables were placed. The pillars were faced halfway up with wood finished to look like sandalwood, the upper part white-enamelled, like the ceiling and upper half of the walls. They were stenciled in gay-coloured bands of simple and lively designs which were repeated on the girders of the vaulted ceiling. The room was further enlivened by several electric chandeliers in bright brass, consisting of three rings placed horizontally one over the other and held together by delicate woven work, the lowest ring set with globes of milky glass like little moons. There were four glass doors, two on the opposite wall, opening on the verandah, a third at the bottom of the room on the left, leading into the front hall, and a fourth, by which Hans Castorp had entered through a vestibule, as Joachim had brought him down a different stair from the one they had used yesterday evening.","The room was done in the kind of modern decor that combines the most efficient simplicity with just a dash of fantasy. It was not deep in relation to its width, and on all four sides was a kind of passageway where the sideboards stood and that opened as a series of arches onto the central dining area. Its columns were paneled with a sandalwood finish, but only partway up; the top of each was painted white, like the upper half of the walls and the ceiling, but colorfully trimmed with simple, cheerful stenciled stripes, which then continued along the broad arches of the low ceiling. The hall was also decorated with several shiny brass chandeliers, all electric, each a series of three stacked rings joined by delicate filigree, with bells of milk glass set like little moons on the lowest circle. There were four glass doors—two on the long wall opposite, opening onto a veranda outside; a third up front to the left, leading directly into the front lobby; and finally the one through which Hans Castorp had entered and that opened off a different hallway, because Joachim had not used the same set of stairs as the night before."
"In Gottes Namen, er konnte ihn selber tragen, er trug ihn sogar lieber selbst, und nur aus Freundlichkeit hatte er ihn dem Elenden dann und wann überlassen. Das aber verkennt wohl niemand in unserer Runde, daß Hans Castorp hart betroffen war durch jene völlig unvorhergesehenen Umstände, die alle Vorbereitungen zuschanden machten, die er für das Wiedersehen mit dem Gegenstand seiner Faschingsabenteuer innerlich getroffen hatte. Besser gesagt: sie machten sie überflüssig, und darin lag das Beschämende.","In God's name, he could carry it himself, he even preferred to carry it himself, and it was only out of kindness that he had let the miserable man have it every now and then. But no one in our circle will fail to recognize that Hans Castorp was hard hit by those completely unforeseen circumstances, which ruined all the preparations he had made inwardly for seeing the subject of his carnival adventures again. Or rather, they made them superfluous, and that was the shame.","But dear me, Hans Castorp could carry his own coat, couldn’t he—and much preferred to; he had only let the poor creature take it now and then out of sheer good feeling. However, there was no doubt everybody in the circle knew that Hans Castorp was hard hit by the wholly unforeseen circumstance, which frustrated all the hopes he had cherished against the return of his carnival partner. It would be putting it even better to say that she had rendered nugatory all his hopes; that, precisely, was the mortifying fact.","But good God, he could carry it himself, preferred to carry it himself, and had handed it over to the poor wretch now and then just to be friendly. But no one in our circle could fail to note that Hans Castorp had been hit hard by these totally unforeseen circumstances, which ruined all his mental preparations for greeting the partner of his carnival adventure on her return. Or better: the circumstances made preparations superfluous—that was the humiliating pan."
"»Ja, das sagen Sie so ironisch … mit der richtigen Ironie natürlich, die keinen Augenblick mißverständlich ist, sondern ein gerades und klassisches Mittel der Redekunst, – Sie sehen, ich merke mir Ihre Worte.

"Aber auf Nummer fünfzig lag Frau von Mallinckrodt, Natalie mit Vornamen, mit schwarzen Augen und goldenen Ringen in den Ohren, kokett, putzsüchtig und dabei ein weiblicher Lazarus und Hiob, von Gott mit jederlei Bresthaftigkeit geschlagen. Ihr Organismus schien mit Giftstoffen überschwemmt, so daß alle möglichen Krankheiten sie abwechselnd und gleichzeitig heimsuchten. Sehr in Mitleidenschaft gezogen war ihr Hautorgan, das zu großen Teilen von einem qualvoll juckenden, da und dort wunden Ekzem überzogen war, auch am Munde, woraus der Einführung des Löffels Schwierigkeiten erwuchsen. Innere Entzündungen, solche des Rippenfells, der Nieren, der Lungen, der Knochenhäute und selbst des Hirns, so daß Bewußtlosigkeit einfiel, lösten einander ab bei Frau von Mallinckrodt, und Herzschwäche, hervorgerufen durch Fieber und Schmerzen, schuf ihr große Ängste, bewirkte zum Beispiel, daß sie beim Schlucken das Essen nicht ordentlich hinunterbrachte: gleich oben in der Speiseröhre {474}blieb es ihr stecken. Kurzum, die Frau war gräßlich daran und außerdem ganz allein in der Welt; denn nachdem sie Mann und Kinder um eines anderen Mannes, das heißt eines halben Knaben, willen verlassen, war sie ihrerseits von ihrem Geliebten verlassen worden, wie die Vettern von ihr selbst erfuhren, und war nun heimatlos, wenn auch nicht ohne Mittel, da der Ehemann sie mit solchen versah. Sie machte ohne unangebrachten Stolz von seiner Anständigkeit oder seiner fortdauernden Verliebtheit Gebrauch, da sie sich selber nicht ernst nahm, sondern einsah, daß sie nur ein ehrloses, sündhaftes Weibchen war, und trug denn auf dieser Basis alle ihre Hiobsplagen mit erstaunlicher Geduld und Zähigkeit, der elementaren Widerstandskraft ihrer Rasse-Weiblichkeit, die über das Elend ihres bräunlichen Körpers triumphierte und noch aus dem weißen Gazeverband, den sie aus irgendeinem schlimmen Grunde um den Kopf tragen mußte, ein kleidsames Kostümstück machte. Beständig wechselte sie den Schmuck, begann in der Frühe mit Korallen und endete abends mit Perlen. Erfreut durch Hans Castorps Blumensendung, der sie offensichtlich eine mehr galante als charitative Bedeutung beilegte, ließ sie die jungen Herren zum Tee an ihr Lager bitten, den sie aus einer Schnabeltasse trank, die Finger ohne Ausnahme der Daumen und bis zu den Gelenken mit Opalen, Amethysten und Smaragden bedeckt. Bald, während die goldenen Ringe an ihren Ohren schaukelten, hatte sie den Vettern erzählt, wie alles sich mit ihr zugetragen: von ihrem anständigen, aber langweiligen Mann, ihren ebenfalls anständigen und langweiligen Kindern, die ganz dem Vater nacharteten und für die sie sich niemals sonderlich hatte erwärmen können, und von dem halben Knaben, mit dem sie das Weite gesucht und dessen poetische Zärtlichkeit sie sehr zu rühmen wußte. Aber seine Verwandten hätten ihn mit List und Gewalt von ihr losgemacht, und dann habe sich der Kleine auch wohl vor ihrer Krankheit geekelt, die da{475}mals vielfältig und stürmisch zum Ausbruch gekommen. Ob die Herren sich etwa auch ekelten, fragte sie kokettierend; und ihre Rasse-Weiblichkeit triumphierte über das Ekzem, das ihr das halbe Gesicht überzog.","But at number fifty lay Frau von Mallinckrodt, Natalie by her first name, with black eyes and gold rings in her ears, coquettish, addicted to preening, and at the same time a female Lazarus and Job, smitten by God with every kind of stubbornness. Her organism seemed so overwhelmed with toxins that all sorts of diseases afflicted her alternately and simultaneously. Her skin, which was largely covered with an agonizingly itchy, here and there sore eczema, was badly affected, including her mouth, which made it difficult to insert the spoon. Internal inflammations, such as those of the pleura, kidneys, lungs, periosteum, and even of the brain, so that she became unconscious, took turns in Frau von Mallinckrodt, and cardiac weakness, caused by fever and pain, created great anxiety for her, caused her, for example that she couldn't swallow the food properly when she swallowed: it got stuck right up in her esophagus. In short, the woman was dreadful, and besides, quite alone in the world; for after she left her husband and children for another man, that is, half a boy, she had in turn been abandoned by her lover, as her cousins found out herself, and was now homeless, though not without means, since the husband provided them with such. She made use of his decency or his continued infatuation without undue pride, not taking herself seriously but realizing that she was just a dishonorable, sinful woman, and on that basis she bore all her troubles with astonishing patience and tenacity. the elementary resilience of her racial femininity, which triumphed over the misery of her tanned body and still made a fitting costume out of the white gauze bandage that she had to wear around her head for some terrible reason. She was constantly changing her jewelry, starting with corals in the morning and ending with pearls at night. Delighted by Hans Castorp's flower show, to which she evidently attached a more gallant than charitable meaning, she invited the young gentlemen to tea at her bedside, which she drank from a sippy cup, her fingers without exception the thumbs and set with opals up to the joints, amethysts and emeralds covered. Soon, while the gold rings in her ears were swinging, she had told her cousins how everything had happened to her: about her decent but boring husband, her decent and boring children, who were just like their father and for whom she never cared particularly warming, and about the half-boy with whom she fled and whose poetic tenderness she knew to praise very much. But his relatives got rid of her with cunning and violence, and then the little one was probably disgusted by her illness, which at that time broke out in many different ways and stormy. She asked coquettishly whether the gentlemen were disgusted too; and her racial femininity triumphed over the eczema covering half her face.","Then there was Frau Mallinckrodt in number fifty, Natalie by name, with the black eyes and the gold rings in her ears; coquettish, fond of dress, but a perfect Lazarus and Job in female form, whom God had been pleased to afflict with every kind of infirmity. Her entire organism seemed infected, and she suffered from all possible complaints by turns and simultaneously. The skin was sympathetically involved, being covered in large tracts by an itching eczema, with open sores here and there, even on the mouth, which made feeding difficult. Then she suffered from internal inflammations of various kinds—of the pleura, the kidneys, the lungs, the periosteum, even of the brain, so that she was subject to loss of consciousness; finally cardiac weakness, the result of constant pain and fever, gave her the greatest distress and even made it, at times, impossible for her to swallow, so that a mouthful of food would remain stuck in her throat. The woman’s state was truly pitiable, and she was alone in the world; for she had left home and children for the sake of a lover, a mere youth, only to be forsaken in her turn—all this she herself related to the cousins—and now was without a home, if not without means, since her husband saw that she should not want. She accepted with no false pride the fruits of his charity or his unquenched love, whichever it was, seeing herself quite humbly as a dishonoured and sinful creature; and so bore all the plagues of Job with astounding patience and resilience, with the elementary powers of resistance of her sex, which triumphed over all the misery of her tawny body, and even made of the gauze dressings which she had to wear about her head a becoming personal adornment. She changed her jewels many times in the day, began with corals in the morning and ended at night with pearls. Hans Castorp’s flowers greatly delighted her; she obviously regarded them as the expression of gallant rather than charitable sentiments, and invited both young men to tea in her room. She drank from an invalid cup, all her fingers decked to the joint with opals, amethysts, and emeralds; in no long time she had told her guests her story, the golden ear-rings swaying as she talked. Told of her respectable, tiresome husband, her no less respectable and tiresome children, who were precisely like their father, and for whom she had not been able to feel great warmth of affection; of the half boy, half man with whom she had fled, whose poetic tenderness she never tired of describing. But his family had taken him away from her, by guile and force commingled—and perhaps he too had been revolted by her illness, which had then suddenly and violently broken out. Perhaps the gentlemen were revolted too, she asked coquettishly, and her inborn femininity triumphed even over the eczema that covered half her face.","In room number 50 lay Frau von Mallinckrodt— Natalie was her first name. She had black eyes and wore golden earrings; a flirt who loved her finery, she was nevertheless a perfect Job, a Lazarus in a female body, whom God had visited with every sort of affliction. Her organism seemed to be so inundated by toxins that she was ravaged by numerous illnesses, sometimes alternately, sometimes all at once. Her skin was a particular problem, great portions of it subject to a tormenting itch that erupted here and there into the open sores of eczema, even around the mouth—which was why she found it difficult to use a spoon. Frau von Mallinckrodt suffered by turns from various internal inflammations—of the pleura, the kidneys, the lungs, the periosteum, even of the brain, which would cause her to lapse into unconsciousness; a weak heart, the result of fever and constant pain, was her greatest worry, for it sometimes resulted in food becoming lodged at the top of the esophagus, making it difficult for her to swallow normally. In short, the woman’s life was a horror. She was all alone in the world, too, having left her husband and children—as she freely admitted to the cousins—for another man (still half a boy), only to be left in turn by her lover. She now had no home, although she was not penniless—her former husband saw to that. She did not take herself seriously and therefore did not let false pride prevent her from making full use of his decency—or was it enduring love? Well aware that she was a faithless and sinful woman, she bore all the plagues of Job with amazing patience and poise, with a fiery female’s elemental powers of resistance; she triumphed over the misery of her dark-skinned body, even turned a white gauze bandage, which she was forced to wear wrapped around her head for some awful reason, into a becoming piece of attire. She was constantly changing her jewelry—beginning each morning with corals and ending each evening with pearls. She had been delighted by the flowers Hans Castorp had sent, regarding them as a gesture more of gallantry than charity, and she invited the two young men for tea at her bedside—drinking hers from a spouted cup; her fingers, including thumbs, were adorned to the knuckles with opals, amethysts, and emeralds. With golden rings dangling at her ears, she quickly told the cousins what had happened to her: about her respectable, but boring husband, her equally respectable and boring children, who had turned out just like their father and whom she had never especially warmed to, and about the half-grown boy with whom she had run off and whose poetic displays of affection she praised at length. But by ruses and coercion, his family had taken him away from her—and the lad had probably been. repulsed by her illness, too, which by then had begun to evidence itself in various violent eruptions. Were the gentlemen repulsed by it, too? she asked coquettishly; and her fiery femininity triumphed over the eczema covering half her face."

"Hans Castorp, in seinem Verlangen nach dem gewohnten, geliebten Lebensreiz, hatte sich wieder eine Zigarre angezündet, und wahrscheinlich dank dem vorangegangenen Biere vermochte er zu seiner unaussprechlichen Genugtuung hier und da etwas von dem ersehnten Aroma zu verspüren: nur selten und schwach freilich, – es war eine gewisse nervöse Anstrengung nötig, um eine Ahnung des Vergnügens zu empfangen, und der abscheuliche Ledergeschmack herrschte bei weitem vor. Unfähig, sich in seine Ohnmacht zu finden, rang er eine Weile nach dem Genuß, der sich ihm entweder versagte oder nur spottend ahnungsweise von ferne zeigte, und warf die Zigarre endlich ermüdet und angewidert fort. Trotz seiner Benommenheit fühlte er die Höflichkeitsverpflichtung, Konversation zu machen, und suchte sich zu diesem Zwecke der ausgezeichneten Dinge zu erinnern, die er vorhin über die »Zeit« zu sagen gehabt hatte. Allein es erwies sich, daß er den ganzen »Komplex« ohne Rest vergessen hatte und über die Zeit auch nicht den geringsten Gedanken mehr in seinem Kopfe beherbergte. Dafür begann er von körperlichen Angelegenheiten zu reden, und zwar etwas sonderbar.","Hans Castorp, in his longing for the familiar, beloved charm of life, had lit a cigar again, and probably thanks to the previous beer, to his inexpressible satisfaction he was able to smell something of the longed-for aroma here and there: only rarely and weakly, of course - it took a certain nervous effort to get a glimpse of pleasure, and the hideous taste in leather was far predominant. Unable to find himself in his swoon, he struggled for a while for the pleasure, which either denied him or only appeared mockingly from afar, and finally, tired and disgusted, threw the cigar away. In spite of his daze, he felt the courtesy obligation of making conversation, and for that purpose he tried to recall the excellent things he had just had to say about the 'time'. But it turned out that he had completely forgotten the whole ""complex"" and that over time he no longer harbored the slightest thought in his head. Instead, he began to talk about physical matters, and in a strange way.","Hans Castorp, craving his familiar and wonted indulgence, had once more lighted a cigar; and, thanks probably to the beer that had gone before, he succeeded now and then in getting a whiff of the longed-for aroma—to his inexpressible satisfaction. But only now and then, but only faintly; the anxious receptivity of his attitude was a strain on the nerves, and the hateful leathery taste distinctly prevailed. Unable to reconcile himself to his impotence, he struggled awhile to regain the enjoyment which either escaped him wholly, or else mocked him by its brief presence; finally, worn out and disgusted, he flung the cigar away. Despite his benumbed condition he felt it incumbent upon him to be polite, to make conversation, and to this end he sought to recall those brilliant ideas he had previously had, on the subject of time. Alas, they had fled, the whole “complex” of them, and left not a trace behind: on the subject of time not one single idea, however insignificant, found lodgment in his head. He began, therefore, to talk of ordinary matters, of the concerns of the body—what he said sounded odd enough in his mouth.","In his desire for his customary and cherished stimulant, Hans Castorp had lit another cigar; and, thanks apparently to the beer he had drunk and much to his indescribable satisfaction, now and then he was able to whiff something of the aroma he craved—but only rarely and faintly, to be sure. It was a strain on his nerves just to try to detect a hint of his usual enjoyment—and that repulsive leathery taste predominated. Unwilling to accommodate himself to such failure, he struggled for a while to find a pleasure that either was totally denied him or simply teased him with a distant inkling of itself, and finally out of weary disgust he tossed the cigar aside. Despite his dazed state, he felt courtesy demanded that he carry on a conversation, and for that purpose he tried to recall the excellent things he had wanted to say about “time” earlier. Except it turned out that he had forgotten every bit of the whole “complex”—not one single thought about time still resided in any corner of his brain. And so instead he began to speak about bodily functions, although in a rather strange fashion."
"Sie wurde lebhaft begrüßt. »Hallo, Elly! Wie reizend sie wieder aussieht! Die reine Fee! Mach’s gut, mein Engel!« Sie lächelte über die Zurufe, über ihren Aufzug, von dem sie wohl wußte, daß er sie kleidete. »Vorkontrolle negativ«, stellte Dr. Krokowski fest. »Frisch ans Werk denn, Kameraden!« fügte er mit nur einmal anschlagendem exotischen Zungen-r hinzu; und Hans Castorp, übel berührt von der Anrede, war im Begriff, {1020}sich gleich den anderen, die unter Hallos, Geschwätz und Schulterschlägen den Halbkreis der Stühle einzunehmen begannen, irgendeinen Platz zu suchen, als der Doktor sich persönlich an ihn wandte.","She was greeted warmly. ""Hello Elly! How lovely she looks again! The pure fairy! Farewell, my angel!' She smiled at the shouts, at her attire, which she knew well clothed her. ""Preliminary check negative,"" stated Dr. Krokowski firmly. ""Let's get to work then, comrades!"" he added, striking the exotic tongue r only once; and Hans Castorp, badly affected by the address, was about to find a seat like the others, who began to take up the semicircle of chairs with hellos, gossip and slaps on the back, when the doctor addressed him personally.","They all hailed her gaily. “Hullo, Elly! How lovely she looks again! A perfect fairy! Very pretty, my angel!” She smiled at their compliments to her attire, probably well knowing it became her. “Preliminary control negative,” Krokowski announced. “Let’s get to work, then, comrades,” he said. Hans Castorp, conscious of being disagreeably affected by the doctor’s manner of address, was about to follow the example of the others, who, shouting, chattering, slapping each other on the shoulders, were settling themselves in the circle of chairs, when the doctor addressed him personally.","She was greeted enthusiastically. “Hello, Elly! Charming as ever! A perfect fairy! Good luck, my angel!” She smiled in response to the calls, fully aware that her outfit looked good on her. “Preparatory examination negative,” Dr. Krokowski announced. “Let’s get down to some hard work now, comrades!” he added, with only one of his palatalized, exotic tongue-tapping r’s. The others began to take their seats, hallooing, chatting, and clapping shoulders, and Hans Castorp, feeling put off by the tone of these opening remarks, was likewise moving to find a spot in the semicircle of chairs, when the doctor turned to address him personally."

"Wahrhaftig, der Literat Settembrini war nicht eben der Mann seines unbedingten Vertrauens, aber er erinnerte sich einiger Belehrung, die der klare Mentor ihm einst, vor Zeiten, am Anfang seiner hermetischen Laufbahn, über »Rückneigung«, die geistige »Rückneigung« in gewisse Welten hatte zuteil werden lassen, und er fand es ratsam, diese Unterweisung mit Vorsicht auf seinen Gegenstand zu beziehen. Herr Settembrini hatte das Phänomen jener Rückneigung als »Krankheit« bezeichnet, – das Weltbild selbst, die Geistesepoche, der die Rückneigung galt, mochte seinem pädagogischen Sinn wohl als »krankhaft« erscheinen. Wie denn nun aber! Hans Castorps holdes Heimwehlied, die Gemütssphäre, der es angehörte, und die Liebesneigung zu dieser Sphäre sollten – »krank« sein? Mit nichten! Sie waren das Gemütlich-Gesundeste auf der Welt. Allein das war eine Frucht, die, frisch und prangend gesund diesen Augenblick oder eben noch, außerordentlich zu Zersetzung und Fäulnis neigte, und, reinste Labung des Gemütes, wenn sie im rechten Augenblicke genossen wurde, vom nächsten unrechten Augenblicke an Fäulnis und Verderben in der genießenden Menschheit verbreitete. Es war eine Lebensfrucht, vom Tode gezeugt und todesträchtig. Es war ein Wunder der Seele, – das höchste vielleicht vor dem Angesicht gewissenloser Schönheit und gesegnet von ihr, jedoch mit Mißtrauen betrachtet aus triftigen Gründen vom Auge verantwortlich regierender Lebensfreundschaft, der Liebe zum Organischen, und Gegenstand der Selbstüberwindung nach letztgültigem Gewissensspruch.","True, the man of letters Settembrini was not exactly the man he unconditionally trusted, but he remembered some instruction that the clear mentor once gave him, a long time ago, at the beginning of his hermetic career, about ""reclining,"" the spiritual ""reclining"" in certain worlds had received, and he found it advisable to apply this instruction to his subject with caution. Herr Settembrini had described the phenomenon of that backward inclination as an ""illness"" - the world view itself, the intellectual epoch to which the backward inclination was directed, might well have seemed ""morbid"" to his pedagogical sense. But how now! Hans Castorp's lovely homesick song, the emotional sphere to which it belonged, and the affection for this sphere should be - ""sick""? Not! They were the most comfortable and healthy thing in the world. But that was a fruit that, fresh and resplendently healthy at this moment or just now, was extraordinarily prone to decay and putrefaction, and, the purest refreshment of the soul, if it was enjoyed at the right moment, from the next wrong moment onwards, rot and ruin in the enjoying humanity spread. It was a fruit of life, begotten of death and deadly. It was a miracle of the soul - perhaps the highest in the face of unscrupulous beauty and blessed by her, but viewed with distrust for good reasons of the eye's responsible ruling life friendship, the love of the organic, and the object of self-overcoming according to the final verdict of conscience.","Unquestioning confidence, Hans Castorp knew, he had never placed in Herr Settembrini. But he remembered now an admonition the enlightened mentor had given him in past time, at the beginning of his hermetic career, on the subject of “spiritual backsliding” to darker ages. Perhaps it would be well to make cautious application of that wisdom to the present case. It was the backsliding which Herr Settembrini had characterized as “disease”; the epitome itself, the spiritual phase to which one backslid—that too would appeal to his pedagogic mind as “diseased”? And even so? Hans Castorp’s loved nostalgic lay, and the sphere of feeling to which it belonged—morbid? Nothing of the sort. They were the sanest, the homeliest in the world. And yet—This was a fruit, sound and splendid enough for the instant or so, yet extraordinarily prone to decay; the purest refreshment of the spirit, if enjoyed at the right moment, but the next, capable of spreading decay and corruption among men. It was the fruit of life, conceived of death, pregnant of dissolution; it was a miracle of the soul, perhaps the highest, in the eye and sealed with the blessing of conscienceless beauty; but on cogent grounds regarded with mistrust by the eye of shrewd geniality dutifully “taking stock” in its love of the organic; it was a subject for self-conquest at the definite behest of conscience.","Settembrini, that old man of letters, was certainly not someone in whom he placed unqualified trust, but he recalled a certain lecture that his clear-minded mentor had once delivered, long ago, back at the start of his hermetic career—a lecture on “backsliding,” on “intellectual backsliding” in certain spheres. And he found it useful to apply those teachings, with some caution, to the object at hand. Herr Settembrini had characterized the phenomenon of backsliding as a “sickness”—and from his pedagogic viewpoint, even the worldview, the intellectual epoch, toward which one “slid back” might appear “sick” as well. But what’s this? Hans Castorp’s sweet, lovely, fair song of nostalgia, the emotional world to which it belonged, his love for that world—they were supposed to be “sick”? Not at all. There was nothing more healthy, more genial on earth. Except that this was a fruit—a fresh, plump, healthy fruit, that was liable, extraordinarily liable, to begin to rot and decay at that very moment, or perhaps the next; and although it was purest regalement of the spirit when enjoyed at the right moment, only a moment later and it could spread rot and decay among those who partook of it. It was a fruit of life, sired by death and pregnant with death. It was a miracle of the soul—the ultimate miracle, perhaps, in the eyes of unscrupulous beauty, who gave it her blessing; yet it was regarded with mistrust, and for valid reasons, by the responsible eye of someone “playing king,” who affirmed life and loved its organic wholeness. Both a miracle and, in response to the final compelling voice of conscience, the means by which he triumphed over himself. Yes, triumph over self"

"Man lachte, soweit man in Hörweite saß, denn Herr Settembrini erzählte drollig. Er zeigte sich auf dem Laufenden über die letzten Neuigkeiten, obgleich er sich doch gegen das Gemeinschaftsleben Derer hier oben so kritisch-spöttisch verhielt. Er wußte alles. Er kannte die Namen und ungefähr auch die Lebensumstände Neuangekommener; er berichtete, daß gestern bei dem und dem oder der und der eine Rippenresektion vorgenommen worden und hatte es aus bester Quelle, daß vom Herbst an Kranke über 38,5 Grad nicht mehr aufgenommen werden würden. In der letzten Nacht hatte sich, seiner Erzählung nach, das Hündchen der Madame Capatsoulias aus Mytilene auf den Knopf des elektrischen Lichtsignals auf dem Nachttisch seiner Herrin gesetzt, woraus viel Rennerei und Tumult entstanden war, besonders, da man Madame Capatsoulias nicht allein, sondern in Gesellschaft des Assessors Düstmund aus Friedrichshagen gefunden habe. Selbst Dr. Blumenkohl mußte lächeln über diese Geschichte, die hübsche Marusja wollte in ihrem Orangentüchlein fast ersticken, und Frau Stöhr schrie gellend, indem sie die linke Brust mit beiden Händen preßte.","There was laughter as far as one sat within earshot, for Mr. Settembrini was telling amusing stories. He kept himself up to date on the latest news, although he was so critical and mocking of the community life of those up here. He knew everything. He knew the names and roughly the living conditions of newcomers; he reported that yesterday a rib resection was carried out on so-and-so and had it from the best source that from the autumn onwards patients over 38.5 degrees would no longer be admitted. Last night, according to him, Madame Capatsoulias of Mytilene's little dog sat on the button of the electric light signal on his mistress' bedside table, which caused a lot of running and commotion, especially since Madame Capatsoulias was not alone but in I found the company of Assessor Düstmund from Friedrichshagen. even dr Cauliflower had to smile at this story, pretty Marusja almost wanted to suffocate in her little orange handkerchief, and Frau Stoehr screamed shrilly, squeezing her left breast with both hands.","“Everybody within ear-shot laughed; Herr Settembrini had such a droll way of telling a story. Despite his contemptuous attitude toward the society of the place, he always knew everything that went on. He knew the name and circumstances of each patient. He knew that such and such a person had been operated on for rib resection; had it on the best authority that from the autumn onward no one with a temperature of more than 101.3 ° would be admitted into the establishment. He told them how last night the little dog belonging to Madame Capatsoulias from Mitylene stepped on the button of the electric signal on his mistress’s night-table and occasioned much commotion and running hither and yon—particularly because Madame Capatsoulias had been found not alone, but in the society of Assessor Düstmund from Friedrichshagen. Even Dr. Blumenkohl had to laugh at that. Pretty Marusja well-nigh choked in her orange-scented handkerchief, and Frau Stöhr yelled with laughter, holding her breast with both hands.","Everyone within earshot began to laugh, because Herr Settembrini had a droll way of telling stories.

The night before, or so he said, the little dog kept by Madame Kapatsoulias from Mytilene had sat on the emergency button on her nightstand, which resulted in considerable commotion and tumult, particularly since Madame Kapatsoulias was not alone, but in the company of Judge Düstmund from Friedrichshafen. Even Dr. Blumenkohl had to laugh at the story. Pretty Marusya almost choked on her orange-scented handkerchief, and Frau Stöhr began to shriek, holding both hands to her left breast."

"Im Restaurant war es hell, elegant und gemütlich. Es lag gleich rechts an der Halle, den Konversationsräumen gegenüber, und wurde, wie Joachim erklärte, hauptsächlich von neu angekommenen, außer der Zeit speisenden Gästen, und von solchen, die Besuch hatten, benutzt. Aber auch Geburtstage und bevorstehende Abreisen wurden dort festlich begangen, sowie günstige Ergebnisse von Generaluntersuchungen. Manchmal gehe es hoch her im Restaurant, sagte Joachim; auch Champagner werde serviert. Jetzt saß niemand als eine einzelne etwa dreißigjährige Dame darin, die in einem Buche las, aber dabei vor sich hin summte und mit dem Mittelfinger der linken Hand immerfort leicht auf das Tischtuch klopfte. Als die jungen Leute sich niedergelassen hatten, wechselte sie den Platz, um ihnen den Rücken zuzuwenden. Sie sei menschenscheu, erklärte Joachim leise, und esse immer mit einem Buche im Restaurant. Man wollte wissen, daß sie schon als ganz junges Mädchen in Lungensanatorien eingetreten sei und seitdem nicht mehr in der Welt gelebt habe.","The restaurant was bright, elegant and comfortable. It was just to the right of the hall, opposite the conversation rooms, and, as Joachim explained, was mainly used by newly arrived guests dining out of time, and by those who had visitors. But birthdays and forthcoming departures were also celebrated there, as well as favorable results from general medical examinations. Sometimes things get really busy in the restaurant, said Joachim; champagne is also served. Now there was no one in it but a single lady of about thirty, reading a book while humming to herself and tapping the tablecloth lightly with the middle finger of her left hand. When the young people were settled, she changed places to have her back to them. She was shy of people, Joachim explained quietly, and always ate with a book in the restaurant. They wanted to know that she had entered a pulmonary sanatorium as a very young girl and hadn't lived in the world since.","IT was charming in the restaurant, elegantly appointed and well lighted. The room lay to the right of the hall, opposite the salons, and was, Joachim explained, used chiefly by new arrivals, and by guests eating out of the usual meal hours or entertaining company. But it also served for birthday feasts, farewell parties, even to celebrate a favourable report after a general examination. There were lively times here in the restaurant on occasion, Joachim said, and champagne flowed freely. Now, no one was here but a solitary lady of some thirty years, reading a book and humming; she kept tapping the table-cloth lightly with the middle finger of her left hand. After the young people had taken their places, she changed hers, in order to sit with her back to them. Joachim explained in a low voice that she suffered from shyness as from a disease, and ate all her meals in the restaurant, with a book. It was said that she had entered her first tuberculosis sanatorium as a young girl, and had never lived in the world since.","The restaurant was well lit, elegant, and comfortable. It was to the right of the lobby, directly across from the social rooms, and was used, as Joachim explained, primarily for new arrivals or residents who either had missed a regularly scheduled meal or had visitors.

Things could get very lively in the restaurant on occasion, Joachim said; they even served champagne. There was no one there now except one lady, perhaps thirty years old, sitting alone and reading—humming to herself the whole time while drumming softly on the tabletop with the middle finger of her left hand. When the young gentlemen had seated themselves, she changed places, so that her back was to them now. She was standoffish, Joachim explained in a low voice, and always ate in the restaurant with just her book.

"Hans Castorp bestimmte in seiner Loge ein Pflanzengewächs, das jetzt, da der astronomische Sommer begonnen hatte und die Tage kürzer zu werden begannen, an vielen Stellen wucherte: die Akelei oder Aquilegia, eine Ranunkulazeenart, die staudenartig wuchs, hochgestielt, mit blauen und veilchenfarbnen, auch rotbraunen Blüten und krautartigen Blättern von geräumiger Fläche. Die Pflanze wuchs da und dort, massenweis aber namentlich in dem stillen Grunde, wo er sie vor nun bald einem Jahre zuerst gesehen: der abgeschiedenen, wildwasserdurchrauschten Waldschlucht mit Steg und Ruhebank, wo sein voreilig-freizügiger und unbekömmlicher Spaziergang von damals geendigt hatte, und die er nun manchmal wieder besuchte.","Hans Castorp identified a plant in his lodge that was growing rampant in many places now that the astronomical summer had begun and the days were beginning to get shorter: the Columbine, or Aquilegia, a species of Ranunculaceae that grew like a perennial, high-stalked, with blue and violet-colored, also red-brown flowers and herbaceous leaves of a spacious area. The plant grew here and there, but en masse in the quiet ground where he first saw it almost a year ago: the secluded forest gorge, riddled with wild water, with jetty and bench, where his hasty, permissive and unwholesome walk from back then had ended, and which he now sometimes visited again.","HANS CASTORP was in his loggia, studying a plant which, now that the astronomical summer had begun, and the days were shortening, flourished luxuriantly in many places: the columbine or aquilegia, of the ranunculus family, which grew in clumps, with long stalks bearing the blue, violet, or reddish-brown blossoms, and spreading herbaceous foliage. They grew everywhere, but most profusely in that quiet bottom where, nearly a year ago, he had first seen them: that remote and wooded ravine, filled with the sound of rushing water, where on the bench above the footbridge, that ill-risked, ill-timed, ill-fated walk of his had ended. He revisited it now and again.","Reclining on his balcony, Hans Castorp identified a plant that .had started to flourish in a great many places now that the astronomical summer had begun and the days were growing shorter again: columbine, or aquilegia, from the family Ranunculaceae, a long-stemmed herbaceous perennial, with blue and violet, sometimes almost reddish-brown flowers and flat, spreading, weedlike foliage. The plant could be found most everywhere, but it grew in particular abundance on the remote meadow where he had first noticed it almost a year before—the same secluded woodland valley with footbridge and bench where his premature, freewheeling walk had come to such a disconcerting end. He had been revisiting the spot now and then of late."
"Ah, selbstverständlich, Naphta beabsichtigte, die Menschheit in ihrer irrationalen Stellung zu den biologischen Tatsachen festzuhalten, er behauptete die primitiv religiöse Stufe, auf welcher der Tod ein Schrecknis war und von Schauern so geheimnisvoller Art umweht, daß es sich verbot, den Blick klarer Vernunft auf dies Phänomen zu richten. Welche Barbarei! Das Todesgrauen stammte aus Epochen niederster Kultur, wo der gewaltsame Tod die Regel gewesen, und das Entsetzliche, das diesem in der Tat anhaftete, hatte sich für das Gefühl des Menschen auf lange mit dem Todesgedanken überhaupt vermählt. Immer mehr jedoch wurde dank der Entwicklung der allgemeinen Gesundheitslehre und der Festigung der persönlichen Sicherheit der natürliche Tod zur Norm, und dem modernen Arbeitsmenschen erschien der Gedanke ewiger Ruhe nach sachgemäßer Erschöpfung seiner Kräfte nicht im {690}geringsten als grauenhaft, sondern vielmehr als normal und wünschenswert. Nein, der Tod war weder ein Schrecknis noch ein Mysterium, er war eine eindeutige, vernünftige, physiologisch notwendige und begrüßenswerte Erscheinung, und es wäre Raub am Leben gewesen, länger, als gebührlich, in seiner Betrachtung zu verharren. Darum war denn auch geplant, jenem Musterkrematorium und der zugehörigen Urnenhalle, der »Halle des Todes« also, eine »Halle des Lebens« anzubauen, worin Architektur, Malerei, Skulptur, Musik und Dichtkunst sich vereinigen sollten, um den Sinn des Fortlebenden von dem Erlebnis des Todes, von stumpfer Trauer und tatenloser Klage auf die Güter des Lebens zu lenken …","Ah, of course, Naphta intended to keep mankind in its irrational attitude to biological facts, he asserted the primitive religious stage at which death was a terror and shuddered with shudders of such a mysterious kind that it forbade the glimpse of clear reason address this phenomenon. What barbarism! The horror of death came from epochs of the lowest culture, when violent death was the rule, and the dreadfulness that actually clung to it had for a long time been married to the thought of death in general in human feelings. More and more, however, with the development of public health and the establishment of personal security, natural death was becoming the norm, and to the modern working man the thought of eternal rest after proper exhaustion of his strength seemed not the least bit horrible, but rather normal and desirable. No, death was neither a horror nor a mystery, it was a definite, reasonable, physiologically necessary, and welcome phenomenon, and it would have been a robbery to live longer than was proper to linger in its contemplation. That is why it was also planned to add a ""Hall of Life"" to that model crematorium and the associated urn hall, i.e. the ""Hall of Death"", in which architecture, painting, sculpture, music and poetry should unite to convey the meaning of what survived from the To direct the experience of death, from dull grief and idle lamentation, to the goods of life...","Naphta evidently meant to hold humanity fast to its old, irrational position in the face of established biological fact; meant to force it to remain at the stage of primitive religion, where death was a spectre surrounded by such mysterious terrors that the gaze of reason could not be focused upon it. What barbarism! The fear of death went back to a very low cultural stage, when violent death was the rule, and its horrors thus became associated with the idea of death in general. But now, thanks to the development of hygiene and the increase in personal security, a natural death was the rule, a violent one the exception; modern man had come to think of repose, after exhaustion of his powers, as not at all dreadful, but normal and even desirable. No, death was neither spectre nor mystery. It was a simple, acceptable, and physiologically necessary phenomenon; to dwell upon it longer than decency required was to rob life of its due. Accordingly, the Hall of Death (as the modern crematory and vault for the urns was to be called) would be supplemented by a Hall of Life, where architecture, painting, sculpture, music, and poetry would combine to draw the thoughts of the survivors from the contemplation of death, from weak and unavailing grief, and fix them upon the joys of life.","Ah, but of course Naphta would like nothing better than for humankind to retain its irrational attitude toward biological fact; of course he would defend the primitive religious level on which death was a terror wrapped in horrors most mysterious and so prevent the phenomenon from being viewed with the clear eye of reason. What barbarism! The fear of death came from epochs of lowest human culture, when violent death was the rule, and the terror rightly associated in man’s emotions with a violent death had been wedded to the idea of death itself for ages now. But more and more, thanks to the development of hygienics and the consolidation of personal security, natural death was becoming the norm; and for the modern workingman the thought of eternal rest after having exhausted one’s energies in labor was not at all horrible, but rather perfectly normal and desirable. No, death was neither a terror nor a mystery , it was an unambiguous, reasonable, physiologically necessary, and welcome phenomenon, and to dwell on the thought of it longer than was seemly was to rob life itself. Which was why the model crematorium and its hall of urns, the “Hall of Death” as such, had been planned with an adjoining “Hall of Life,” where architecture, painting, sculpture, music, and poetry would be united, so that the mind of the survivor might be directed away from the experience of death, from dull mourning and idle laments, toward the good things of life."
"Von dem humanistischen Klapp-Pult am Fensterchen, vor dem er gestanden, war Herr Settembrini an den Rundtisch mit der Wasserflasche getreten, näher zu seinem Schüler hin, der auf dem an die Wand gerückten Ruhebette saß, ohne Rückenlehne, den Ellenbogen aufs Knie und das Kinn in die Hand gestützt.","From the humanistic folding desk by the little window in front of which he was standing, Mr. Settembrini went to the round table with the water bottle, closer to his pupil, who was sitting on the daybed pushed against the wall, without a backrest, his elbows on his knees and all that Chin in hand.","Herr Settembrini walked from the humanistic folding-desk in the little window, where he had been standing, up to the table, nearer his pupil, who was sitting on the cot against the wall, his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands.","Herr Settembrini had moved now from his humanist’s folding lectern to the round table with its water carafe, closer to his pupil, who was sitting on the backless divan pushed up against one wall, his elbows on his knees and his chin propped in one hand."

"Beide Vettern waren überrascht durch den Luxus des zweifenstrigen Arbeitszimmers, das sie aufgenommen hatte, ja geblendet durch Überraschung; denn die Dürftigkeit des Häuschens, seiner Treppe, seines armseligen Korridors ließ dergleichen nicht entfernt erwarten und verlieh der Eleganz von Naphtas Einrichtung durch Kontrastwirkung etwas Märchenhaftes, was sie an und für sich kaum besaß und auch in den Augen Hans Castorps und Joachim Ziemßens nicht besessen hätte.

Es war zuviel Seide darin, weinrote, purpurrote Seide: die Vorhänge, die die schlechten Türen verbargen, waren daraus, die Fenster-Überfälle und ebenso die Bezüge der Meubles-Gruppe, die an einer Schmalseite, der zweiten Tür gegenüber, vor einem die Wand fast ganz bespannenden Gobelin angeordnet war. Es waren Barockarmstühle mit kleinen Polstern auf den Seitenlehnen, um einen runden, metallbeschlagenen Tisch gruppiert, hinter dem ein mit Seidenplüschkissen ausgestattetes Sofa desselben Stiles stand. Die Bücherspinde nahmen die Wandpartien neben den beiden Türen ein. Sie waren, wie der Schreibtisch, oder vielmehr der mit einem gewölbten Rolldeckel versehene Sekretär, der zwischen den Fenstern Platz gefunden hatte, in Mahagoni gearbeitet, mit Glastüren, hinter die grüne Seide gespannt war. Aber in dem Winkel links von der Sofagruppe war ein Kunstwerk zu sehen, eine große, auf rot verkleidetem Sockel erhöhte bemalte Holzplastik, – etwas innig Schreckhaftes, eine Pietà, einfältig und wirkungsvoll bis zum Grotesken: die Gottesmutter in der Haube, mit zusammengezogenen Brauen und jammernd schief geöffnetem Munde, den Schmerzensmann auf ihrem Schoß, eine im Größenverhältnis primitiv verfehlte Figur mit kraß herausgearbeiteter Anatomie, die jedoch von Unwissenheit zeugte, das hängende Haupt von Dornen starrend, Gesicht und Glieder mit Blut befleckt und berieselt, dicke Trauben geronnenen Blutes an der Seitenwunde und den Nägelmalen der Hände und Füße. Dies Schaustück verlieh dem seidenen Zimmer nun freilich einen besonderen Akzent. Auch die Tapete, über den Bücherschränken und an der Fensterwand sichtbar, war übrigens offenbar eine Leistung des Mieters: das Grün ihrer Längsstreifen war das des weichen Teppichs, der über die rote Bodenbespannung gebreitet war. Nur der niedrigen Decke war wenig zu helfen gewesen. Sie war {593}kahl und rissig. Doch hing ein kleiner venezianischer Lüster daran herab. Die Fenster waren mit cremefarbenen Stores verhüllt, die bis zum Boden reichten.","Both cousins were surprised by the luxury of the double-windowed study which had taken them in, yes, dazzled by surprise; for the poverty of the little house, its staircase, its miserable corridor did not remotely suggest anything of the sort and, through contrasting effects, lent the elegance of Naphta's furnishings something fairytale-like, which it hardly possessed in and of itself and would not have possessed in the eyes of Hans Castorp and Joachim Ziemssen either . All the same, it was fine, even shiny, in such a way that, despite the desk and bookcases, it really didn't retain the character of the study. There was too much silk in it, wine-red, crimson silk: the curtains that hid the bad doors were made of it, the window sills and also the covers of the furniture group that was on one narrow side, opposite the second door, in front of the wall almost completely covered Gobelin was arranged. They were baroque armchairs with small cushions on the armrests, grouped around a round metal-studded table, behind which stood a sofa of the same style, upholstered with silk plush cushions. The book lockers took up the wall sections next to the two doors. They were, like the desk, or rather the bureau with a domed tambour door, that had found its place between the windows, made of mahogany, with glass doors stretched behind green silk. But in the corner to the left of the group of sofas a work of art could be seen, a large painted wooden sculpture raised on a red-clad pedestal - something intimately frightening, a Pietà, simple and effective to the point of the grotesque: the Blessed Mother in the cap, with knitted brows and wailing, crooked mouth, the Man of Sorrows on her lap, a primitively outsized figure with grossly worked out anatomy, which, however, betrayed ignorance, the drooping head bristling with thorns, face and limbs stained and sprinkled with blood, thick clusters of clotted blood on the side wound and the nail marks on the hands and feet. This showpiece gave the silken room a special accent. Incidentally, the wallpaper that can be seen above the bookcases and on the window wall was obviously the tenant's work: the green of its longitudinal stripes was that of the soft carpet that was spread over the red floor covering. Only the low ceiling had been of little help. She was {593}bald and chapped. But a small Venetian chandelier hung from it. The windows were covered with cream-colored blinds that reached to the floor.","Both cousins were surprised by the luxury of the two-windowed study. They were even astonished; for the poverty of the cottage, the mean stair and wretched corridor, led one to expect nothing of the kind. The contrast lent to Naphta’s elegant furnishings a note of the fabulous, which of themselves they scarcely possessed, and would not otherwise have had in the eyes of Hans Castorp and Joachim Ziemssen. Yet they were elegant too, even strikingly so; indeed, despite writing-table and bookshelves the room hardly had a masculine look. There was too much silk about— wine-coloured, purplish silk; silken window-hangings, silken portières, and silken coverings to the furniture arranged on the narrow side of the room in front of a wall almost entirely covered with a Gobelin tapestry. Baroque easy-chairs with little pads on the arms were, grouped about a small metal-bound table, and behind it stood a baroque sofa with velvet cushions. Bookcases lined the entrance wall on both sides of the door. They and the writing-table or, rather, roll-top desk, which stood between the windows, were of carved mahogany; the glass doors of the bookcases were lined with green silk. But in the corner to the left of the sofa-group stood a work of art, a large painted wood-carving, mounted on a red-covered dais: a pietà, profoundly startling, artlessly effective to the point of being grotesque. The Madonna, in a cap, with gathered brows and wry, wailing mouth, with the Man of Sorrows on her lap— considered as a work of art it was primitive and faulty, with crudely emphasized and ignorant anatomy, the hanging head bristling with thorns, face and limbs bloodbesprinkled, great blobs of blood welling from the wound in the side and from the nail-prints in hands and feet. This show-piece did indeed give a singular tone to the silken chamber. The wall-paper, on the window wall and above the bookcases, had obviously been supplied by the tenant: the green stripe in it matched the soft velvet carpet spread over the red drugget. The windows had cream-coloured blinds down to the floor. Only the ceiling had been impossible to treat: it was bare and full of cracks; but a small Venetian lustre hung down from it.","Both cousins were surprised by the luxury of the two-windowed study into which they had stepped—indeed, they were dazzled, for they had not expected anything of the sort given the shabby little house with its dingy corridor and stairway, in contrast to which Naphta’s furnishings seemed almost fabulously elegant, when in point of fact they weren’t, nor would Hans Castorp or Joachim Ziemssen normally have regarded them as such. But the decor was first-rate, and so ornate that despite the desk and bookcases the room did not have much of a masculine look. There was too much silk, burgundy and purple silk: silk curtains to conceal the shoddy doors, silk valances above the windows, and silk upholstery on a sofa and armchairs grouped at the far end of the room, opposite a second door and directly below a tapestry covering almost the entire wall. The baroque chairs, with little upholstered cushions on the arms, were placed around a circular, brass-trimmed table; behind this stood the sofa, likewise baroque and strewn with silk plush pillows. The bookcases, fitted with glass doors and green silk curtains, filled the walls at the sides of both doors; they were mahogany, as was the desk, or rather the rolltop secretary, which had been placed between the two windows. In the corner, to the left of the sofa and chairs, was a work of art: a painted wooden sculpture set atop a large pedestal draped in red, a profoundly terrifying work, a naive pietà—very effective, almost grotesque. The Mother of God, her hood drawn up, her brows furrowed in agony, her mouth skewed and gaping in lamentation; the Man of Sorrows on her lap, a primitive figure, badly out of scale, the crudely fashioned body revealing an ignorance of anatomy, the drooping head studded with thorns, the face and limbs splattered and dripping with blood, thick globs of congealed blood at the wound in the side, nail marks on the hands and feet—this showpiece definitely lent the silk room a special accent. The wallpaper visible above the bookcases and at the sides of the windows was also apparently the work of the tenant, with vertical stripes in the same green as the soft carpet spread over the simple red floor-covering. Only the low ceiling was more or less beyond help; it was cracked and bare—although a small Venetian chandelier had been hung. The windows were hidden by floor-length cream-colored curtains."

"»Ach, doch,« antwortete Joachim, »ganz unmöglich ist es nicht. Dergleichen kommt vor hier oben. Zwei Monate bevor ich kam hat sich ein Student, der schon lange hier war, nach einer Generaluntersuchung im Walde drüben aufgehängt. Es war in meinen ersten Tagen noch viel die Rede davon.«","""Oh yes,"" replied Joachim, ""it's not entirely impossible. The same thing happens up here. Two months before I came, a student who had been here for a long time hung himself over in the woods after a general examination. There was a lot of talk about it in my early days.«","“Oh,” answered Joachim, “it isn’t so out of the question, more’s the pity. Such things do happen up here. Two months before I came, a student who had been here a long time hanged himself down in the wood, after a general examination. It was a good deal talked about still, in the early days after I came.”","“Oh, indeed,” Joachim replied, “it’s certainly not impossible. That sort of thing happens up here. Two months before I arrived, a student who had been here for a long time went for his checkup—and then hanged himself out in the woods. Everyone was talking about it my first few days here.”"
"Aber er lachte nur höhnisch im Weggehen, und schon nach wenigen Minuten kehrte er mit dem Revolver zurück.

"»Harzgebirg«, sagte er. »Gegend von Schierke und Elend. Habe ich Ihnen zu viel versprochen, Ingenieur? Heiß ich mir das doch eine Messe! Aber warten Sie nur, unser Witz erschöpft sich nicht so bald, wir sind noch nicht auf der Höhe, geschweige am Ende. Nach allem, was man hört, wird es noch mehr Masken geben. Gewisse Personen haben sich zurückgezogen, – das berechtigt zu allerlei Erwartungen, Sie werden sehen.«","""Harz Mountains,"" he said. »Area of Schierke and misery. Did I promise you too much, engineer? I call that a fair! But just wait, our wit won't be exhausted any time soon, we're not up to par, let alone the end. From what we hear, there will be more masks. Certain people have withdrawn - that justifies all sorts of expectations, you will see.""","“ ‘The Harz,’ ” he said. “ ‘Near Schierke and Elend.’ Did I exaggerate, Engineer? Here’s a bedlam for you! But wait, the fun is not over so soon; far from leaving off, it has not even reached its height. From what I hear, there will be more masquerading; certain people have left the room, we are justified in anticipating almost anything.”","“In the Harz Mountains,” he said, “are towns with names like Schierke and Elend—Imps and Misery. Did I exaggerate, my good engineer? Now here’s a holy mass, I do declare. But just wait, our mirth’s not yet about to fade, we’ve not yet reached our heights—let alone come to an end. To judge from what one hears, still further masquerades await us. Certain persons have already withdrawn—and therefore we are permitted to make all sorts of assumptions. You’ll see.”"
"Seine Vorsätze waren die zartesten, besonnensten gewesen, weit entfernt von täppischem Ungestüm. Kein Gedanke daran, daß er Clawdia etwa vom Bahnhof hatte abholen wollen, – und ein Glück nur, daß er diesen Gedanken nicht hatte aufkommen lassen! Überhaupt aber war ganz ungewiß gewesen, ob eine Frau, der die Krankheit so große Freiheit verlieh, die phantastischen Ereignisse einer fernen maskierten und fremdsprachigen Traumnacht auch nur werde wahrhaben wollen, oder ob sie wünschen werde, unmittelbar daran erinnert zu sein. Nein, keine Zudringlichkeit, kein plumper Anspruch! Selbst zugegeben, daß sein Verhältnis zu der schrägäugigen Kranken die Grenzen abendländischer Vernunft und Gesittung dem Wesen nach hinter sich ließ, – in der Form war vollkommenste Zivilisation und für den Augenblick sogar der Schein der Gedächtnislosigkeit zu wahren. Ein Kavaliersgruß von Tisch zu Tisch – fürs erste nichts weiter! Ein höfisches Hinzutreten bei späterer Gelegenheit, unter leichter Erkundigung nach dem Ergehen der Reisenden seit neulich … Das eigentliche Wiedersehen mochte sich zu seiner Stunde als Lohn beherrschter Ritterlichkeit daraus ergeben.","His resolutions had been the gentlest, most prudent, far removed from clumsy impetuosity. No thought that he might have wanted to fetch Clawdia from the train station - and just lucky that he hadn't let that thought arise! In general, however, it was quite uncertain whether a woman who was given such great freedom by the illness would even want to acknowledge the fantastic events of a distant, masked dream night in a foreign language, or whether she would wish to be directly reminded of them. No, no importunity, no clumsy claim! Even admitted that his relationship to the slanting-eyed patient essentially left the limits of Western reason and civility behind - in this form the most perfect civilization and, for the moment, even the appearance of amnesia had to be preserved. A gentle greeting from table to table – nothing more for now! A courtly appearance on a later occasion, with a light inquiry into how the travelers had fared recently … The actual reunion might result from this at his hour as a reward for controlled chivalry.","His designs had been of the most discreet and delicate, he had meant nothing clumsy or abrupt. He would not even fetch her from the station—what a mercy, indeed, he had not thought of doing so! Uncertain whether a woman—upon whom illness had conferred such a degree of freedom—uncertain whether she would even admit the fantastic adventures of a dream dreamed on carnival night, in a foreign tongue to boot! Whether she would even wish in the first instance to be reminded of them. No, there would be no exigence, no clumsy pressing of claims. Admitted that his relations with the slant-eyed sufferer went beyond the limits prescribed by the traditions of the Occident; the uttermost formality of civilization, even for the moment apparent forgetfulness—was indicated as the suitable procedure. A respectful greeting from table to table—only that, for the time, no more. A courtly approach as occasion indicated, an easy inquiry after the health of the traveller. The actual meeting would follow in good time, as a reward for his chivalrous reserve.","His intentions had been of the most delicate, prudent sort—nothing even vaguely impetuous or awkward. He had not given a thought to fetching Clavdia from the station, for instance—and a good thing the idea had not occurred to him. He had been quite uncertain whether a woman, one whose illness granted her such freedom, would even want to admit the fantastic events of that dreamy night of masquerade in a foreign language. Or would she perhaps prefer that he immediately remind her? No, nothing obtrusive, no coarse claims on her. Even if one granted that his relationship to the slant-eyed patient had by its very nature exceeded the bounds of Western reason and behavior, what had to be maintained now was very civilized formality, even, for the present, a feigned forgetfulness. A cavalier’s greeting from table to table—nothing more than that at first. On some later occasion, he might politely approach the traveler and casually inquire about how she had been doing of late. The real meeting would then follow at the appropriate time as a reward for his level-headed chivalry."
"Und Joachim, wie stand es um ihn? War er befreit und erleichtert seitdem, oder litt seine Seele schwere Entbehrung angesichts der leeren Tischseite? Hing seine ungewohnte und empörerische Ungeduld, seine Drohung, wilde Abreise halten zu wollen, wenn man ihn länger an der Nase führe, mit der Abreise Marusjas zusammen? Oder war vielmehr die Tatsache, daß er vorderhand eben doch noch nicht reiste, sondern der hofrätlichen Verherrlichung der Schneeschmelze sein Ohr lieh, auf jene andere zurückzuführen, daß die hochbusige Marusja nicht ernstlich abgereist, sondern nur etwas verreist war und in fünf kleinsten Teileinheiten hiesiger Zeit wieder eintreffen würde? Ach, das war wohl alles auf einmal der Fall, alles in gleichem Maße; Hans Castorp konnte es sich denken, auch ohne je mit Joachim über die Sache zu sprechen. Denn dessen enthielt er sich ebenso streng, wie Joachim es vermied, den Namen einer anderen etwas Verreisten zu nennen.","And Joachim, how was he? Has he been liberated and relieved since then, or has his soul suffered severe deprivation in the face of the empty side of the table? Was his unaccustomed and rebellious impatience, his threat to hold wild departure if he was led by the nose any longer, connected with Marusya's departure? Or was the fact that he wasn't traveling just yet, but listening to the Court Councilor's glorification of the melting snow, due to the fact that the big-breasted Marusja hadn't seriously left, but had only gone away a little, and in five small fractions of the time here would arrive again? Ah, that was probably the case all at once, all to the same extent; Hans Castorp could imagine it without ever speaking to Joachim about the matter. For he refrained from doing this just as strictly as Joachim avoided mentioning the name of someone else who was a little out of town.","And Joachim? Did he find things easier, for that? Or did he suffer an agony of inward emptiness in view of the vacant places at table? Had his unwonted irritability, his threats of taking un-sanctified leave, anything to do with Marusja’s departure? Or, on the other hand, that he had after all not left, but lent an ear to the Hofrat’s gospel of the melting snows—was that fact any way connected with the circumstance that the full-bosomed Marusja was not gone for good but only on a journey, and would be back again in five of the smallest time-units known to House Berghof? Ah, yes, they were both true, this and the other, as Hans Castorp was well aware, without ever having exchanged a syllable with Joachim on the subject—which he was as careful to refrain from doing as his cousin was, on his side, to avoid mention of another person also lately gone off for a little trip.","And Joachim, how was he doing? Did he feel liberated, was his mind easier—or did his spirit suffer great privation when he saw one whole side of the table empty? And his uncharacteristic, rebellious impatience, including his threat to carry out a wild departure of his own if they kept on leading him around by the nose—did that have anything to do with Marusya’s being gone? Or was the fact that he did not leave, at least for now, and instead lent an ear to the director’s testimonials on the thaw, traceable to full-bosomed Marusya’s not having departed for good, to her certain return after only five of the smallest units of local time? Ah, it was probably all true at once, and in equal measure. Hans Castorp could well imagine that was the case, without ever speaking to Joachim. For he refrained from mentioning anything about the matter, just as Joachim avoided the name of someone else who had departed for a while."
"Sie schwiegen ein Stück Weges, aber ihr Schweigen handelte von Naphta, und Hans Castorp konnte warten: es war gewiß, daß Herr Settembrini auf seinen Hausgenossen zu sprechen kommen werde, ja, daß er zu diesem Zwecke mit ihnen gegangen sei. Er täuschte sich nicht. Nach einem Aufatmen, das einem Anlauf gleichkam, begann der Italiener:","They were silent for a while, but their silence was about naphtha, and Hans Castorp could wait: it was certain that Herr Settembrini would talk about his housemates, yes, that he had gone with them for this purpose. He wasn't wrong. After a sigh of relief that was like a run-up, the Italian began:","They were silent for some way; but the silence spoke of Naphta, and Hans Castorp could wait. He felt sure Herr Settembrini would mention his house-mate, had come out with them for that very purpose. He was not mistaken. Drawing a long breath, as if to get a good start, the Italian began: “My friends, I should like to warn you.”","They said nothing for part of the way, but their silence was all about Naphta, and Hans Castorp could wait—he was certain that Herr Settembrini would come around to speaking of his housemate, that in fact he had come with them for that very purpose.

"»Bravo!« rief Settembrini. »Bravo, Leutnant! Sie bezeichnen sehr gut ein unzweifelhaft sittliches Moment im Wesen der Musik, nämlich dieses, daß sie dem Zeitablaufe durch eine ganz eigentümlich lebensvolle Messung Wachheit, Geist und Kostbarkeit verleiht. Die Musik weckt die Zeit, sie weckt uns zum feinsten Genusse der Zeit, sie weckt … insofern ist sie sittlich. Die Kunst ist sittlich, sofern sie weckt. Aber wie, wenn sie das Gegenteil tut? Wenn sie betäubt, einschläfert, der Aktivität und dem Fortschritt entgegenarbeitet? Auch das kann die Musik, auch auf die Wirkung der Opiate versteht sie sich aus dem Grunde. Eine teuflische Wirkung, meine Herren! Das Opiat ist vom Teufel, denn es schafft Dumpfsinn, Beharrung, Untätigkeit, knechtischen Stillstand … Es ist etwas Bedenkliches um die Musik, meine Herren. Ich bleibe dabei, daß sie zweideutigen Wesens ist. Ich gehe nicht zu weit, wenn ich sie für politisch verdächtig erkläre.«","""Bravo!"" Settembrini exclaimed. “Bravo, lieutenant! They describe very well an undoubted moral moment in the essence of music, namely this that it lends alertness, spirit and preciousness to the passage of time through a quite peculiarly lively measurement. Music awakens time, it awakens us to the finest enjoyment of time, it awakens ... to that extent it is moral. Art is moral insofar as it awakens. But what if she does the opposite? When it numbs, lulls, counteracts activity and progress? Music can do that, too, and for that reason it understands the effects of opiates. A devilish effect, gentlemen! The opiate is from the devil because it creates dullness, inertia, idleness, servile standstill... There is something dubious about music, gentlemen. I maintain that it is of an ambiguous nature. I'm not going too far in calling them political suspects.""","“Bravo!” cried Settembrini. “Bravo, Lieutenant! You are describing very well indeed an aspect of music which has indubitably a moral value: namely, that her peculiarly life-enhancing method of measuring time imparts a spiritual awareness and value to its passage. Music quickens time, she quickens us to the finest enjoyment of time; she quickens—and in so far she has moral value. Art has moral value, in so far as it quickens. But what if it does the opposite? What if it dulls us, sends us to sleep, works against action and progress? Music can do that too; she is an old hand at using opiates. But the opiate, my dear sirs, is a gift of the Devil; it makes for lethargy, inertia, slavish inaction, stagnation. There is something suspicious about music, gentlemen. I insist that she is, by her nature, equivocal. I shall not be going too far in saying at once that she is politically suspect.”","“Bravo!” Settembrini cried. “Bravo, lieutenant. You have described very nicely an indubitably moral element in the nature of music: to wit, that by its peculiar and lively means of measurement, it lends an awareness, both intellectual and precious, to the flow of time. Music awakens time, awakens us to our finest enjoyment of time. Music awakens—and in that sense it is moral. Art is moral, in that it awakens. But what if it were to do the opposite? If it were to numb us, put us asleep, counteract all activity and progress? And music can do that as well. It knows all too well the effect that opiates have. A devilish effect, gentlemen. Opiates are the Devil’s tool, for they create dullness, rigidity, stagnation, slavish inertia. There is something dubious about music, gentlemen. I maintain that music is ambiguous by its very nature. I am not going too far when I declare it to be politically suspect.”"
"Naphtas Bosheit lag auf der Lauer nach Gelegenheiten, die Schwächen des naturbezwingenden Fortschritts zu erspähen, seinen Trägern und Pionieren menschliche Rückfälle ins Irrationale nachzuweisen. Aviatiker, Flieger, sagte er, seien meist recht üble und verdächtige Individuen, vor allem sehr abergläubisch. Sie nähmen Glücksschweine, eine Krähe mit an Bord, sie spuckten dreimal dahin und dorthin, sie zögen die Handschuhe von glücklichen Fahrern an. Wie sich so primitive Unvernunft mit der ihrem Beruf zum Grunde liegenden Weltanschauung reime? – Der Widerspruch, den er aufzeigte, ergötzte ihn, bereitete ihm Genugtuung; er hielt sich lange darüber auf … Aber wir greifen im Unerschöpflichen hin und her nach Proben von Naphtas Feindseligkeit, während es nur allzu Gegenständliches zu erzählen gibt.","Naphta's malice lurked in wait for opportunities to glimpse the weaknesses of nature-conquering progress, to demonstrate human relapses into the irrational in its bearers and pioneers. Pilots, he said, were mostly very bad and suspicious individuals, and above all very superstitious.

How does such primitive unreasonableness rhyme with the ideology on which her profession is based? - The contradiction that he pointed out amused him, gave him satisfaction; he dwelt long on it... But we reach back and forth in the inexhaustible for samples of Naphta's animosity while there is only too concrete a story to tell.","Naphta’s malicious wit lay in ambush, to spy out the weaknesses of the naturecompelling forces of progress, and convict its standard-bearers and pioneers of human relapses into the irrational. Aviators, flying men, he said, were mostly a bad lot, untrustworthy, above all exceedingly superstitious. They carried mascots on board with them, pigs and ravens and such-like; they spat three times in different directions, they wore the gloves of lucky flyers. How could such primitive unreason be reconciled with the conception of the universe which underlay their calling? The contradiction diverted him, he held forth upon it in extenso. But such illustrations of Naphta’s malevolence are without number—let us abandon them for the all-toopertinent tale we have to tell.","Naphta’s malice lay in ambush for any opportunity to detect weaknesses in a theory of progress that tried to bend nature to its will; he loved to catch its agents and pioneers taking very human steps backward into irrationality. Aviators, pilots, he said, were mostly very nasty, untrustworthy sorts, and were above all very superstitious. They took rabbit’s feet up with them, or kept a crow on board; they would spit three times this way and that, wore gloves of lucky fellow pilots. How could such a primitive lack of reason be made to square with the worldview on which their profession was based? He took delight in pointing out the contradiction, it gratified him . . . But here we are selecting general items from Naphta’s inexhaustible hostility, when we have matters that are only all too concrete to talk about."
O Margarete!«,Oh Margaret!«,O Marguerite!”,"O Marguerite. And as always when Hans Castorp listened to this aria, deep emotions stirred within him, strengthened this time by certain possibilities that were compacted into a wish, and he thought, “Idle and sinful or not, it would certainly be wonderfully strange and a very special adventure."

Das waren die jungen Nadelbüschel der Lärchen, – Hans Castorp konnte auf Dienstwegen selten umhin, sie mit der Hand zu liebkosen und sich die Wange damit zu streicheln, so unwiderstehlich lieblich waren sie in ihrer Weichheit und Frische. »Man könnte zum Botaniker werden,« sagte der junge Mann zu seinem Begleiter, »man könnte wahr und wahrhaftig Lust bekommen zu dieser Wissenschaft vor lauter Spaß an dem Wiedererwachen der Natur nach einem Winter bei uns hier oben!

Aber hier haben wir Ranunkeln, sie sehen unten ja auch nicht anders aus, aus der Familie der Ranunkulazeen, gefüllt, wie mir auffällt, eine besonders reizende Pflanze, zwittrig übrigens, du siehst da eine Menge Staubgefäße und eine Anzahl Fruchtknoten, ein An{550}drözeum und ein Gynäzeum, soviel ich behalten habe. Ich glaube bestimmt, ich werde mir einen oder den anderen botanischen Schmöker zulegen, um mich etwas besser zu informieren auf diesem Lebens- und Wissensgebiet. Ja, wie es nun bunt wird auf der Welt!«","What a mild treat for the eyes, the meadow green after the endless white! And yet another green was there, far surpassing the green of the new grass in tenderness and lovely softness. Those were the young tufts of needles from the larches – Hans Castorp could seldom avoid caressing them with his hand on official business and stroking his cheeks with them, they were so irresistibly lovely in their softness and freshness. ""You could become a botanist,"" said the young man to his companion, ""you could really get excited about this science for the sheer fun of nature waking up again after a winter up here! That's gentian, man, what you see on the slope, and this here is a certain kind of little yellow violets, unknown to me. But here we have ranunculus, they don't look any different below, from the Ranunculaceae family, double, as I notice, a particularly charming plant, hermaphrodite by the way, you see there a lot of stamens and a number of ovaries, an {550 }drözeum and a gynaecium, as much as I have kept. I'm sure I'll buy one or the other botanical book to get a little better information on this area of life and knowledge. Yes, how colorful the world is now!”","What a joy that was, what a boon to the eyes, after so much white! But there was another green, surpassing in its tender softness even the hue of the new grass, and that was the green of young larch buds. Hans Castorp could seldom refrain from caressing them with his hand, or stroking his cheeks with them as he went on his walks—their softness and freshness were irresistible. “It almost tempts one to be a botanist,” he said to his companion. “It’s a fact, I could almost wish to be a natural scientist, out of sheer joy at the reawakening of nature, after a winter like this up here. That’s gentian, man, that you see up there on the cliffs; and this is a sort of little yellow violet— something I’m not familiar with. And this is ranunculus, they look just the same down below, the natural order Ranunculaceæ: compound, I remember, a particularly charming plant, androgynous, you can see a lot of stamens and pistils, an androecium and a gynaeceum, if I remember rightly. I really must root out some old volume of botany or other, and polish up my knowledge in this field.—My hat, how gay it’s getting to look in the world!”","What a comforting sight those green meadows were after an infinity of white. And another green appeared as well, its delicate, tender softness far exceeding the green of new grass—young clusters of needles on the larches. When taking his constitutionals, Hans Castorp could not help caressing them and brushing them against his cheek—their softness and freshness were so irresistibly enchanting. “It’s enough to make a botanist of you,” the young man said to his companion. “A man could really and truly decide to become a scientist from the pure joy of watching nature reawaken after one of our winters up here. That’s gentian you see there on that slope, my man, and right there is a kind of little yellow violet I don’t recognize. But here we have buttercups, no different from the ones down below, from the family Ranunculaceae, a compound flower, as I recall, an especially charming plant, bisexual, you can see the great number of stamens and several pistils, the androecium and gynoecium, if I remember correctly. I really think I shall add some botanical tomes to my collection, just to become somewhat better informed about this part of life, this realm of knowledge. Yes, just look at the world’s colorful variety.”"
"In dieser Haltung traf ihn Herr Settembrini, – stark bildlich gesprochen, wie sich versteht; denn in Wirklichkeit, das wissen wir, schloß unseres Helden Sittensprödigkeit solches Theater aus. In spröder Wirklichkeit traf ihn der Mentor beim Kofferpacken, – denn seit dem Augenblick seines Erwachens sah Hans Castorp sich in den Trubel und Strudel von wilder Abreise gerissen, den der sprengende Donnerschlag im Tale angerichtet. Die »Heimat« glich einem Ameisenhaufen in Panik. Fünftausend Fuß tief stürzte das Völkchen Derer hier oben sich kopfüber ins Flachland der Heimsuchung, die Trittbretter des gestürmten Zügleins belastend, ohne Gepäck, wenn es sein mußte, das in Stapelreihen die Steige des Bahnhofs bedeckte, – des wimmelnden Bahnhofs, in dessen Höhe brenzlige Schwüle von unten heraufzuschlagen schien, – und Hans stürzte mit. Im Tumult umarmte ihn Lodovico, – buchstäblich, er schloß ihn in seine Arme und küßte ihn wie ein Südländer (oder auch wie ein Russe) auf beide Wangen, was unseren wilden Reisen{1080}den in aller Bewegung nicht wenig genierte. Aber fast hätte er die Fassung verloren, als Herr Settembrini ihn im letzten Augenblick mit Vornamen, nämlich »Giovanni« nannte und dabei die im gesitteten Abendland übliche Form der Anrede dahin fahren und das Du walten ließ!","It was in this attitude that Mr. Settembrini met him - to put it figuratively, of course; for in reality, we know, our hero's decency ruled out such theatre. In brittle reality, the mentor met him while he was packing his suitcase - for from the moment he woke up Hans Castorp saw himself being drawn into the turbulence and whirlpool of wild departure caused by the blasting thunderclap in the valley. ""Heimat"" was like an anthill in panic. Five thousand feet the little people of those up here threw themselves headlong into the flat land of the affliction, straining the running boards of the rushed train, without luggage, if it had to be, that covered the platforms of the station in piles—the teeming station, with a sweltering humidity high up seemed to be hitting from below - and Hans fell with it. In the tumult, Lodovico hugged him - literally, he threw his arms around him and kissed him like a southerner (or like a Russian) on both cheeks, which was not a little embarrassing to our wild travels in all their movement. But he almost lost his composure when, at the last moment, Mr. Settembrini called him by his first name, namely ""Giovanni"", using the form of address customary in the civilized Occident and using the familiar form of address!","And in this attitude Herr Settembrini found him—figuratively and most figuratively spoken, for full well we know our hero’s traditional reserve would render such theatricality impossible. Herr Settembrini, in fact, found him packing his trunk. For since the moment of his sudden awakening, Hans Castorp had been caught up in the hurry and scurry of a “wild” departure, brought about by the thunder-peal. “Home”—the Berghof—was the picture of an ant-hill in a panic: its little population was flinging itself, heels over head, five thousand feet downwards to the catastrophe-smitten flat-land. They stormed the little trains, they crowded them to the footboard—luggageless, if needs must, and the stacks of luggage piled high the station platform, the seething platform, to the height of which the scorching breath from the flat-land seemed to mount—and Hans Castorp stormed with them. In the heart of the tumult Ludovico embraced him, quite literally enfolded him in his arms and kissed him, like a southerner—but like a Russian too—on both his cheeks; and this, despite his own emotion, took our wild traveller no little aback. But he nearly lost his composure when, at the very last, Herr Settembrini called him “Giovanni” and, laying aside the form of address common to the cultured West, spoke to him with the thou!","And it was in this position that Herr Settembrini found him—metaphorically speaking, of course; for in reality, as we know, our hero’s cool, reserved manners excluded such theatrics. In cool reality, his mentor found him packing his bags—for since the moment of his awakening, Hans Castorp had been caught up in the turmoil and confusion of a wild departure, the result of that bursting thunderbolt in the valley. His “home” was now like an anthill in panic. The “people up here” were tumbling head over heels all five thousand feet down to the flatlands and its ordeal, were storming the little train, thronging its running boards—if need be, even without their baggage, which lay piled in rows on the platforms of the teeming little station, where even high in the mountains one could catch a whiff of the stifling smoke drifting up from below. And Hans tumbled with them. There in the tumult, Lodovico embraced him, literally took him in his arms and gave him a Mediterranean—or perhaps a Russian—kiss, a cause of no little embarrassment for our wild traveler, despite his own surge of emotion. And he almost lost his composure when at the last moment Herr Settembrini called him by his first name, said “Giovanni,” and casting aside the forms appropriate to the educated West, let informal pronouns reign."
"»Schön«, sagte Joachim. »Haben sie dich denn so gestört? Ja, es sind gewissermaßen Barbaren, unzivilisiert mit einem Wort, ich hab es dir ja im voraus gesagt. Er kommt immer in einer Lederjoppe zum Essen, – abgeschabt sage ich dir, mich wundert immer, daß Behrens nicht dagegen einschreitet. Und sie ist auch nicht die Properste, trotz ihrem Federhut … Übrigens kannst du ganz unbesorgt sein, sie sitzen weit von uns fort, am Schlechten Russentisch, denn es gibt einen Guten Russentisch, wo nur feinere Russen sitzen –, und es ist kaum eine Möglichkeit, daß du mit ihnen zusammentriffst, selbst wenn du wolltest. Es ist überhaupt nicht leicht, Bekanntschaften zu machen, schon weil so viele Ausländer unter den Gästen sind, und ich selbst kenne persönlich nur wenige, so lange ich hier bin.«","""Nice,"" said Joachim. ""Did they bother you that much? Yes, they are barbarians, so to speak, uncivilized in a word, I told you beforehand. He always comes to dinner in a leather jacket - I tell you it's shabby, I'm always surprised that Behrens doesn't intervene. And she's not the most proper either, in spite of her feathered hat... By the way, don't worry, they sit far away from us, at the Bad Russian Table, because there's a Good Russian Table where only finer Russians sit - and it's hardly a possibility that you meet them even if you wanted to. It is not at all easy to make acquaintances, if only because there are so many foreigners among the guests, and I personally only know a few as long as I have been here.«","“Very good,” Joachim said. “Did they disturb you? Yes, they are barbarians, more or less; uncivilized, I told you so before. He comes to the table in a leather jacket, very shabby , I always wonder Behrens doesn’t make a row. And she isn’t the cleanest in this world, with her feather hat. You may make yourself quite easy, they sit at the ‘bad’ Russian table, a long way off us—there is a ‘good’ Russian table, too, you see, where the nicer Russians sit—and there is not much chance of you coming into contact with them, even if you wanted to. It is not very easy to make acquaintance here, partly from the fact that there are so many foreigners. Personally, as long as I’ve been here, I know very few.”","“Fine,” Joachim said. “Did they disturb you all that much? Yes, they are barbarians, so to speak—uncivilized, to put a word on it—I did warn you. He always comes to meals in a leather jacket— quite shabby, let me tell you. I’m amazed Behrens doesn’t do something about it. And she’s not all that well groomed herself, despite the plumed hat. But in any case, you needn’t worry, they sit a good distance away, at the Bad Russian table—because there’s also a Good Russian table, where the more refined Russians sit. So there’s hardly any possibility you’d meet them, even if you wanted to. It’s not at all easy to make acquaintances here, if only because there are so many foreigners among the guests. I personally have got to know only a few myself in all my months here.”"
"Er nahm lächelnd das rote Etui vom Tisch und öffnete es. Schmuck wie ein Geschmeide lag das gläserne Gerät in die genau nach seiner Figur ausgesparte Vertiefung der roten Samtpolsterung gebettet. Die ganzen Grade waren mit roten, die Zehntelgrade mit schwarzen Strichen markiert. Die Bezifferung war rot, der untere, verjüngte Teil mit spiegelig glänzendem Quecksilber gefüllt.

The glass device lay like a piece of jewellery, embedded in the deepening of the red velvet upholstery, which had been cut out exactly according to its figure.

"{924}»Es ist schwer, davon abzusehen,« sagte Hans Castorp, »und es empfiehlt sich für mich auch gar nicht, davon abzusehen, um Ihre Frage in aller Anspruchslosigkeit zu bejahen. Denn daß es eine Persönlichkeit Ihres Formates war, in deren Begleitung Clawdia zurückkehrte, konnte das Ungemach, das für mich darin lag, daß sie überhaupt in Begleitung eines anderen Mannes zurückkehrte, natürlich nur verstärken und verwickelter gestalten. Es hat mir bedeutend zu schaffen gemacht und tut es heute noch, das leugne ich nicht, und ich habe mich absichtlich nach Kräften an die positive Seite der Sache gehalten, das heißt: an meine aufrichtigen Verehrungsgefühle für Sie, Mynheer Peeperkorn, worin übrigens nebenbei eine kleine Bosheit gegen Ihre Reisebegleiterin lag; denn die Frauen sehen es gar nicht besonders gern, wenn ihre Liebhaber zusammenhalten.«","{924}""It is difficult to refrain from doing so,"" said Hans Castorp, ""and it is not at all advisable for me to refrain from doing so, in order to answer your question in the affirmative in all unpretentiousness.

It bothered me greatly, and still does, I don't deny it, and I've purposely stuck to the positive side of things as best I can, that is, to my sincere feelings of reverence for you, Mynheer Peeperkorn, in which, by the way, is a little malice against your traveling companion; because women don't particularly like it when their lovers stick together.""","“It is difficult,” Hans Castorp said, “to divorce the two; and the idea does not commend itself to me that I should divorce them in order to be free to reply in the affirmative to your question. The very fact that it was a personality like you in whose company Clavdia returned could only make more distressing and involved her coming back in the company of anybody whatever. It gave me a quarter of an hour, I assure you, and still does, that I do not deny; I have purposely kept as much as I could to the positive element, that is my sincere feeling of honour and reverence for you, Mynheer Peeperkorn—in which there mingled a spice of malice against your mistress; for women are never at ease when their lovers come to terms.”","“It is difficult to set it aside,” Hans Castorp said, “and indeed it would hardly be advisable for me to do so if I am to answer your question in the affirmative with no pretense.

It certainly was hard for me to deal with, and still is, I cannot deny it. But I have intentionally held to the positives of the matter as best I could, that is, to my sincere feelings of respect for you, Mynheer Peeperkorn—which, by the by, also permitted me to needle your traveling companion just a little, since women do not particularly enjoy seeing their lovers getting along.”"

"Wie schrecklich schwer sie vonstatten ging! Sie schien nicht vonstatten gehen zu wollen, – und konnte sie denn? Welcher Wahnsinn! Woher hier Mutterschaft? Entbindung – wie und wovon? »Helft!

"»Noch eins, Mynheer Peeperkorn«, fuhr Hans Castorp fort. »Noch eins ließ mich wünschen, Ihnen reinen Wein einschenken zu dürfen, nämlich die persönliche Erfahrung, wie irritierend die Unsicherheit, das Angewiesensein auf halbe Vermutungen in dieser Richtung wirken kann. Sie wissen nun, wer es war, mit dem Clawdia, bevor das gegenwärtige positive Rechtsverhältnis sich herstellte, das nicht zu respektieren natürlich ausgemachter Wahnsinn wäre, einen – einen neunundzwanzigsten Februar erlebt, verbracht, begangen – also begangen hat. Ich habe für mein Teil diese Klarheit nie gewinnen können, obgleich ich mir klar darüber war, daß jeder, der in die Lage kommt, darüber nachzudenken, mit solchen Vorgängen, ich meine eigentlich Vorgängern, rechnen muß, und obgleich ich ferner wußte, daß Hofrat Behrens, der, wie Sie vielleicht wissen, in Öl dilettiert, im Laufe vieler Sitzungen ein hervorragendes Porträt von ihr angefertigt hatte, von einer Anschaulichkeit in der Wiedergabe der Haut, die unter uns gesagt zu starkem Stutzen Anlaß gibt. Das hat mir viel Qual und Kopfzerbrechen verursacht und tut es noch heute.«","'One more thing, Mynheer Peeperkorn,' continued Hans Castorp. 'One more thing that made me want to give you the clear wine, and that is personal experience of how irritating uncertainty can be, of having to rely on half guesswork in this direction. You now know who it was with whom Clawdia, before the current positive legal relationship was established, which, of course, not to respect would be outright madness, spent, committed - that is, committed - a February 29th. For my part, I have never been able to gain this clarity, although I was aware that anyone who is able to think about it must reckon with such events, I actually mean predecessors, and although I also knew that Hofrat Behrens, who, as you may know, is a dabbler in oils, had painted an excellent portrait of her in the course of many sessions, with a vivid depiction of the skin that, between us, gives cause for a great deal of amazement. It caused me a lot of anguish and a headache, and it still does today.«","“One thing more, Mynheer Peeperkorn,” Hans Castorp went on. “There was another thing that made me wish to make a clean breast of it to you: and that was the personal experience I had with the irritating effect of uncertainty, being let in for suspicions that could be neither confirmed nor dismissed. You know now who it was—before this present relationship was established which it would be absurd of me not to respect—with whom Clavdia spent—or experienced, or committed—that twenty-ninth of February. It is clear to you now. But for my part I have never been able to know—though of course I realized that anyone in my situation has to reckon with the past—by which I really mean predecessors—and though I also realized that Hofrat Behrens is an amateur portrait-painter, and had, in the course of many sittings, made a capital portrait of her, with a treatment of the skin so very lively and realistic that—between ourselves—it gave me very seriously to think. I have tormented myself no end with that riddle, and still do.”","“And there was one more reason, Mynheer Peeperkorn,” Hans Castorp continued, “one more reason why I wanted to make a clean breast of things—and that is that I know from personal experience how annoying uncertainty can be in this area, when one is at the mercy of surmises and guesses. You now know who it was with whom Clavdia marked, spent, observed—yes, that’s it—observed her twenty-ninth of February before the establishment of the present legitimate state of affairs, which it would be utter madness not to respect. I, for my part, was never able to attain such clarity, although it was clear to me that anyone who found himself in a situation where he must ponder such matters would have to assume certain precedents, or indeed predecessors—though I did know that Director Behrens, who as you are perhaps aware is an amateur painter in oils, had in the course of a great many sittings produced a magnificent portrait of her, with a lifelike mastery of the skin that, just between us, certainly takes one aback. It caused me a great deal of torment as I racked my brains over it, and does so even today.”"

Das heißt ›ihr‹ crayon, und nicht seines, in diesem Fall, und man sagt nur ›son‹, weil ›crayon‹ ein Maskulinum ist, alles übrige ist Witzelei. Daß ich mich überhaupt dabei aufhalte! Während zum Beispiel die Tatsache viel vordringlicher ist, daß mein linkes Bein, gegen das ich mich stütze, auffallend an das hölzerne Stelzbein von Settembrinis Drehorgel erinnert, das er immer mit dem Knie vor sich herstößt, über das Pflaster hin, wenn er näher unter das Fenster tritt und den Sammethut hinhält, damit das Mägdlein droben ihm etwas hineinwirft.

That means 'her' crayon, not his, in this case, and you only say 'son' because 'crayon' is masculine, all the rest is quip. That I dwell on it at all! For example, while the fact is far more salient that the left leg I lean against is strikingly reminiscent of the wooden stilt on Settembrini's barrel organ, which he always knees in front of him, over the pavement as he gets closer under the window and holds out the velvet hat so that the maid upstairs can throw something into it. And at the same time, impersonally, my hands are literally drawn to lie down in the snow. The only thing that helps is movement. I have to exercise to punish the Kulmbacher and to smooth the wooden leg.""","“That was the wrong way to go to work,” he acknowledged to himself. “The port was not at all the right thing; just the few sips of it have made my head so heavy I cannot hold it up, and my thoughts are all just confused, stupid quibbling with words. I can’t depend on them—not only the first thought that comes into my head, but even the second one, the correction which my reason tries to make upon the first—more’s the pity. ‘ Son crayon!’ That means her pencil, not his pencil, in this case; you only say son because crayon is masculine. The rest is just a pretty feeble play on words. Imagine stopping to talk about that when there is a much more important fact; namely, that my left leg, which I am using as a support, reminds me of the wooden leg on Settembrini’s hand-organ, that he keeps jolting over the pavement with his knee, to get up close to the window and hold out his velvet hat for the girl up there to throw something into. And at the same time, I seem to be pulled, as though with hands, to lie down in the snow. The only thing to do is to move about. I must pay for the Kulmbacher, and limber up my wooden leg.”","“That was a major blunder,” he admitted. “The port was not the right thing—just a few sips and my head feels much too heavy, it’s all I can do to hold it up. And my thoughts are all muddled, and I end up making insipid plays on words that I dare not trust—and not just the basic idea that first occurs to me, but the second one, too, which is a critique of the first, that’s where I get into trouble. ‘Son crayon’! In this case that means ‘her’ pencil, not ‘his,’ and you only say ‘son’ because ‘crayon’ is masculine—all the rest is just a vapid joke. Why am I even bothering with this, when there are much more urgent matters at hand—for example, the leg I’m using to brace myself bears a striking resemblance to the wooden folding leg on Settembrini’s barrel organ, which he nudges with his knee so that he can move across the cobblestones and get closer to the window and hold out his velvet hat, so that the lass upstairs can throw something down to him. And all the while there’s this impersonal force tugging at my hands to get me to lie down in the snow. Movement is the only thing that can help. I have to move, to make up for that Kulmbach beer and limber up my wooden leg.”"
"Er stieg noch höher, in Serpentinen. Kuhglockengeläut zog ihn an, und er fand auch die Herde; sie graste in der Nähe einer Blockhütte, deren Dach mit Steinen beschwert war. Zwei bärtige Männer kamen ihm entgegen, mit Äxten auf den Schultern, und trennten sich, als sie nahe herangekommen. »Nun, so leb wohl und hab Dank!« sagte der eine zum andern mit tiefer, gaumiger Stimme, legte seine Axt auf die andere Schulter und begann ohne Weg und mit knackenden Tritten zwischen den Fichten zu Tal zu schreiten. Es hatte so sonderbar in der Einsamkeit geklungen, dieses »Leb wohl und hab Dank« und träumerisch Hans Castorps vom Steigen und Singen benommenen Sinn berührt. Er sprach es leise nach, indem er sich bemühte, die gutturale und feierlich-unbeholfene Mundart des Gebirglers nachzuahmen, und stieg noch ein Stück über die Almhütte hinaus, da es ihm darum zu tun war, die Baumgrenze zu er{182}reichen; doch ließ er nach einem Blick auf die Uhr von diesem Vorhaben ab.","He climbed even higher, in switchbacks. Ringing of cowbells attracted him, and he also found the flock; she was grazing near a log cabin whose roof was weighed down with stones. Two bearded men came towards him, axes on their shoulders, and parted as they drew near. ""Well, farewell, and thank you,"" said one to the other in a deep, full-bodied voice, put his ax on his other shoulder, and began to stride down the valley between the pines, without a path and with cracking steps. It had sounded so strange in solitude, this ""Farewell and have thanks"" and dreamily touched Hans Castorp's mind, dazed from climbing and singing. He repeated it softly, trying to imitate the guttural and solemnly clumsy dialect of the mountaineer, and climbed a little further beyond the alpine hut because he was trying to reach the tree line; but after a glance at the clock he gave up on this project.","He mounted still higher on the zigzag path, drawn by the sound of cow-bells, and came at length upon the herd, grazing near a hut whose roof was weighted with stones. Two bearded men approached him, with axes on their shoulders. They parted, a little way off him, and “Thank ye kindly, and God be with ye,” said the one to the other, in a deep guttural voice, shifted his axe to the other shoulder, and began breaking a path through crackling pine-boughs to the valley. The words sounded strange in this lonely spot: they came dreamlike to Hans Castorp ’s senses, strained and benumbed. He repeated them, softly, trying to reproduce the guttural, rustically formal syllables of the mountain tongue, as he climbed another stretch higher, above the hut.","He kept climbing along the serpentine path. The sound of cowbells drew him on and he found the herd, too; they were grazing near a wooden hut, whose roof was weighed down with stones. Two bearded men were coming toward him, axes on their shoulders, but then, not all that far from him, they took leave of one another. “Well, fare thee well and much obliged,” the one said to the other in a deep, guttural voice; he now switched his axe to his other shoulder and began to stride down toward the valley, his steps cracking loudly as he forged a path through the pines. It had sounded so strange there in this lonely, remote place, that “fare thee well and much obliged,” like words in a dream brushing past Hans Castorp’s senses, numbed by climbing and singing. He spoke the words softly to himself, trying to imitate the guttural and sober rustic dialect of these mountain men; and he kept climbing for some distance beyond the hut, determined to reach the tree line. But one glance at his watch, and he gave up that plan."
"Jünglinge tummelten Pferde, liefen, die Hand am Halfter, neben ihrem wiehernden, kopfwerfenden Trabe her, zerrten {741}die Bockenden an langem Zügel oder trieben sie, sattellos reitend, mit bloßen Fersen die Flanken der Gäule schlagend, ins Meer hinein, wobei die Muskeln ihrer Rücken unter der goldbraunen Haut in der Sonne spielten und die Rufe, die sie tauschten oder an ihre Tiere richteten, aus irgend einem Grunde bezaubernd klangen. An einer wie ein Bergsee die Ufer spiegelnden Bucht, die weit ins Land trat, war Tanz von Mädchen. Eine, von deren zum Knoten hochgenommenem Nackenhaar besonderer Liebreiz ausging, saß, die Füße in einer Bodenvertiefung und blies auf einer Hirtenflöte, die Augen über ihr Fingerspiel hinweg gerichtet auf die Gefährtinnen, die, lang- und weitgewandet, einzeln, die Arme lächelnd ausgebreitet, und zu Paaren, die Schläfen lieblich aneinander gelehnt, im Tanze schritten, während im Rücken der Flötenden, der weiß und lang und zart und seitlich gerundet war, infolge der Stellung der Arme, andere Schwestern saßen oder umschlungen standen, zuschauend in ruhigem Gespräch. Weiterhin übte sich Jungmannschaft im Bogenschießen. Es war glücklich und freundschaftlich zu sehen, wie Ältere noch Ungeschickte, Lokkige im Spannen der Sehne, im Anlegen unterwiesen, mit ihnen zielten und die vom Rückschlag Taumelnden lachend stützten, wenn der Pfeil schwirrend hinausging. Andere angelten. Sie lagen bäuchlings auf Uferfelsenplatten, mit einem Beine wippend, und hielten die Schnur ins Meer, den Kopf gemächlich plaudernd dem Nachbarn zugewandt, der, in schrägem Sitz den Körper reckend, seinen Köder recht weit hinauswarf. Wieder andere waren beschäftigt, ein hochbordiges Boot mit Mast und Segelstange unter Zerren, Schieben und Stemmen ins Meer zu fördern. Kinder spielten und jauchzten zwischen den Wellenbrechern. Ein junges Weib, lang hingestreckt, hintüber blickend, zog mit der einen Hand das blumige Gewand zwischen den Brüsten hoch, indem sie mit der andren verlangend in die Luft nach einer Frucht mit Blättern griff, die {742}der Schmalhüftige, zu ihren Häupten aufrecht, ihr mit gestrecktem Arme spielend vorenthielt. Man lehnte in Felsennischen, man zögerte am Rande des Bades, indem man kreuzweise mit den Händen die eigenen Schultern hielt und mit der Zehenspitze die Kühle des Wassers prüfte. Paare ergingen sich das Ufer entlang, und am Ohr des Mädchens war dessen Mund, der sie vertraulich führte. Langzottige Ziegen sprangen von Platte zu Platte, überwacht von einem jungen Hirten, der, eine Hand in der Hüfte, mit der andern auf seinen langen Stab gestützt, einen kleinen Hut mit hinten aufgeschlagener Krempe auf braunen Locken, am erhöhten Orte stand.","Young men frolicked horses, ran with their hands on their halters alongside their whinnying, head-throwing trot, [741]pulling the bucking men on long reins or driving them, riding bareback, hitting the flanks of the horses with their bare heels into the sea, whereby the The muscles of their backs flexed in the sun beneath their golden-brown skin, and the calls they exchanged or made to their animals sounded charming for some reason. On a bay that mirrored the shore like a mountain lake and stretched far into the country, there was a dance of girls. One, whose nape of hair, tied up in a bun, exuded particular charm, sat with her feet in a hollow in the floor and blew a shepherd's flute, her eyes fixed over her fingerplay at the companions, who, long and loosely robed, individually, arms spread smiling, and in couples, their temples lovingly leaning against each other, dancing, while behind the flutist, which was white and long and delicate and rounded at the sides, due to the position of the arms, other sisters sat or stood embracing, watching in quiet conversation. Furthermore, the young team practiced archery. It was happy and friendly to see how the older, still clumsy, curly ones instructed how to stretch the string, how to put it on, aim with them and laughingly support those who were reeling from the recoil when the arrow whizzed out. Others fished. They lay on their stomachs on ledges of rock, one leg bobbing, and held the line into the sea, chatting leisurely, their heads turned to the neighbor, who, stretching his body at an angle, threw his bait quite far out. Still others were engaged in hauling, pushing and heaving a high-boarded boat with mast and sail into the sea. Children played and cheered between the breakwaters. A young woman stretched out, looking across, with one hand pulling up the flowered robe between her breasts, while with the other she reached longingly in the air for a fruit with leaves, which {742}the narrow-hipped one erect at her head , playfully withheld from her with outstretched arms. People leaned in rock niches, hesitated at the edge of the bath, crossing their shoulders with their hands and testing the coolness of the water with their toes. Couples strolled along the shore, and the girl's mouth was on her ear, guiding her confidentially. Long-shaggy goats sprang from slab to slab, watched over by a young shepherd who stood on the raised spot, one hand on hip, the other leaning on his long staff, a small hat with the brim turned down on brown curls.","Youths were at work with horses, running hand on halter alongside their whinnying, head-tossing charges; pulling the refractory ones on a long rein, or else, seated bareback, striking the flanks of their mounts with naked heels, to drive them into the sea. The muscles of the riders’ backs played beneath the sun-bronzed skin, and their voices were enchanting beyond words as they shouted to each other or to their steeds. A little bay ran deep into the coast line, mirroring the shore as does a mountain lake; about it girls were dancing. One of them sat with her back toward him, so that her neck, and the hair drawn to a knot above it smote him with loveliness. She sat with her feet in a depression of the rock, and played on a shepherd’s pipe, her eyes roving above the stops to her companions, as in long, wide garments, smiling, with outstretched arms, alone, or in pairs swaying gently toward each other, they moved in the paces of the dance. Behind the flute-player—she too was white-clad, and her back was long and slender, laterally rounded by the movement of her arms—other maidens were sitting, or standing entwined to watch the dance, and quietly talking. Beyond them still, young men were practising archery. Lovely and pleasant it was to see the older ones show the younger, curly-locked novices, how to span the bow and take aim; draw with them, and laughing support them staggering back from the push of the arrow as it leaped from the bow. Others were fishing, lying prone on a jut of rock, waggling one leg in the air, holding the line out over the water, approaching their heads in talk. Others sat straining forward to fling the bait far out. A ship, with mast and yards, lying high out of the tide, was being eased, shoved, and steadied into the sea. Children played and exulted among the breaking waves. A young female, lying outstretched, drawing with one hand her flowered robe high between her breasts, reached with the other in the air after a twig bearing fruit and leaves, which a second, a slender-hipped creature, erect at her head, was playfully withholding. Young folk were sitting in nooks or the rocks, or hesitating at the water’s edge, with crossed arms clutching either shoulder, as they tested the chill with their toes. Pairs strolled along the beach, close and confiding, at the maiden’s ear the lips of the youth. Shaggyhaired goats leaped from ledge to ledge of the rocks, while the young goatherd, wearing perched on his brown curls a little hat with the brim turned up behind, stood watching them from a height, one hand on his hip, the other holding the long staff on which he leaned.","Lads exercised trotting, whinnying, head-tossing horses, ran beside them, one hand on the halter, tugged at their long bridles when they reared, or rode them bareback, naked heels drumming at the animals’ flanks, out into the sea—and then the muscles of the boys’ golden-tan backs played in the sunlight and the cries they exchanged or shouted to the horses sounded inexplicably enchanting. Maidens were dancing beside a bay that extended far inland and mirrored its shores like a mountain lake. One girl, her hair wound in a knot, but with a few, especially charming stray strands at the back of her neck, sat with her feet dangling in a little dell and played a shepherd’s pipe, her eyes gazing out over her capering fingers to her playmates dressed in long, loose robes, some of whom stood alone, smiling, arms spread wide, while others danced in couples, leaning against one another, temples sweetly touching; and at the piper’s back—bent to one side in a long, graceful, white curve because of the way she held her arms—still more of her sisters sat or stood together, embracing, watching, and talking quietly. Another group of young men were engaged in archery. What a happy, friendly sight it was—the way the older lads worked with the unskilled, curly-haired boys, helping them string their bows, showing them how to draw and take aim, supporting them when they reeled back laughing from the recoiling bow as the arrow left it with a whir. Still others were fishing. They lay on their stomachs across flat rocks along the shore; wiggling a leg in the air and holding a line down into the sea, one fellow would turn his head for a leisurely chat with his neighbor, who from the same odd angle stretched his body and threw his bait far out to sea. There was also a group busy dragging, pulling, and shoving a deep-drafted boat with mast and boom into the water. Children played and hooted among the breaking waves. A young woman lay stretched out on her back, gazing up and behind her; with one hand she clutched her flowered garment tight above her breasts and with the other reached into the air, demanding a twig with fruit, which a narrow-hipped lad standing at her head held out at arm’s length, teasing her. Some young people reclined in niches in the rocks, others hesitated at the edge of the pool, arms crossed, hands clutching their shoulders, testing the cool water with their toes. Couples strolled along the shore, and each lad’s lips were pressed to the ear of the girl he escorted. Longhaired goats leapt from ledge to ledge, watched over by a young shepherd, who stood farther up and wore a little hat cocked over his brown curls, the brim rolled up at the back; he leaned against his long staff, grasping it tightly in one hand, setting the other to his hip."
"Ein schlimmer, apokalyptischer Name, ganz danach angetan, geheime Beängstigung einzuflößen. Hans Castorp saß und rieb sich Stirn und Herzgegend mit den flachen Händen. Er fürchtete sich. Ihm war, als könne »das alles« kein gutes Ende nehmen, als werde eine Katastrophe das Ende sein, eine Empörung der geduldigen Natur, ein Donnerwetter und aufräumender Sturmwind, der den Bann der Welt brechen, das Leben über den »toten Punkt« hinwegreißen und der »Sauregurkenzeit« einen schrecklichen Jüngsten Tag bereiten werde. Er hatte Lust zu fliehen, wir sagten es schon, – und ein Glück denn nur, daß die Obrigkeit das vorerwähnte »unverwandte Auge« auf ihn hatte, daß sie in seinen Mienen zu lesen verstand und auf seine Divertierung mit neuen, fruchtbaren Hypothesen bedacht war!","A wicked, apocalyptic name, all set to instill secret terror. Hans Castorp sat and rubbed his forehead and heart with his flat hands. He was afraid. He felt as if “all this” could not have a happy ending, as if a catastrophe would be the end, an outrage of patient nature, a thunderstorm and a cleansing storm wind that would break the spell on the world, tear life away from the “dead spot”. and will prepare a terrible Judgment Day for the »sour pickle time«. He felt like fleeing, as we said, and it was just fortunate that the authorities had the above-mentioned ""close eye"" on him, that they knew how to read his expression and were intent on his divergence with new, fruitful hypotheses !","An apocalyptic, evil name, calculated to give rise to mysterious fears. Hans Castorp sat and rubbed his brow and his heart with the flat of his hand. He was frightened. It seemed to him “all this” could come to no good, that a catastrophe was impending, that long-suffering nature would rebel, rise up in storm and whirlwind and break the great bond which held the world in thrall; snatch life beyond the “dead point” and put an end to the “small potatoes” in one terrible Last Day. He longed to flee—as we have seen already. It was fortunate, then, that the heads had their unchanging eyes upon him, that they knew how to read his face, and were ready to tide him over the hard place with new and fruitful diversions.","A fearful, apocalyptic name, very much calculated to instill secret terrors. Hans Castorp sat and rubbed his brow and the area around his heart with the palms of his hands. He was afraid. It was as if “all this” could come to no good end, as if the end was surely a catastrophe, a rebellion of patient nature, a thunderstorm and a great cleansing wind that would break the spell cast over the world, wrench life from its “dead standstill,” and overturn the “doldrums” in a terrible Last Judgment. He longed to flee, as noted—it was just lucky that medical authority had, as mentioned before, kept an “unblinking eye” on him, that it had known how to read the expression on his face and was intent on diverting him with new, fertile hypotheses."

"Das war natürlich die rechte Art nicht einzuschlafen, und Hans Castorp spürte jetzt auch gar keine Neigung dazu. Seit er {139}auf so neuartige und lebhafte Weise verstanden, warum Joachim sich verfärbt hatte, schien die Welt ihm neu, und jenes Gefühl ausschweifender Freude und Hoffnung berührte ihn wieder in seinem Innersten. Übrigens wartete er noch auf etwas, ohne sich recht zu fragen, worauf. Als er aber hörte, wie die Nachbarn zur Rechten und Linken die abendliche Liegekur beendeten und ihre Zimmer aufsuchten, um die horizontale Lage draußen mit derjenigen drinnen zu vertauschen, gab er vor sich selbst der Überzeugung Ausdruck, daß das barbarische Ehepaar Frieden halten werde. Ich kann ruhig einschlafen, dachte er. Sie werden heute abend Frieden halten, das erwarte ich aufs bestimmteste! Aber sie taten es nicht, und Hans Castorp hatte es auch gar nicht aufrichtig gedacht, ja, die Wahrheit zu sagen, hätte er es persönlich und seinerseits nicht einmal verstanden, wenn sie Frieden gegeben hätten. Trotzdem erging er sich in tonlos hervorgestoßenen Ausrufen des heftigsten Erstaunens über das, was er hörte. »Unerhört!« rief er ohne Stimme. »Das ist enorm! Wer hätte dergleichen für möglich gehalten?« Und zwischendurch beteiligte er sich wieder mit flüsternden Lippen an der abgeschmackten Operettenmelodie, die hartnäckig herübertönte.","Of course that wasn't the right way to fall asleep, and Hans Castorp didn't feel any inclination to do so now. Ever since he understood in such a novel and vivid way why Joachim had changed his color, the world seemed new to him, and that feeling of excessive joy and hope touched his innermost being again. Besides, he was still waiting for something without really asking himself what for. But when he heard the neighbors on the right and left finish their evening rest and go to their rooms to exchange the horizontal position outside for that inside, he expressed to himself the conviction that the barbaric couple would keep peace. I can go to sleep, he thought. They will keep peace tonight, I expect that most definitely! But they didn't do it, and Hans Castorp hadn't since thought it at all, in fact, to tell the truth, he personally and for his part wouldn't have understood it even if they had made peace. Nevertheless, he indulged in toneless exclamations of the greatest astonishment at what he heard. he exclaimed without a voice. “That's enormous! Who would have thought such a thing possible?' And now and then he took part again with whispering lips in the insipid operetta melody that sounded persistently.","That was, of course, the right way not to go to sleep, and now he felt not the slightest inclination. Since he had understood in that new, penetrating sense why Joachim had changed colour, the whole world seemed altered to him, he felt pierced for the second time by that feeling of extravagant joy and suspense. And he waited for, expected something, without asking himself what. But when he heard his neighbours to right and left conclude their evening cure and re-enter their rooms to exchange the horizontal without for the horizontal within, he gave utterance to the conviction that at least this evening the barbaric pair would keep the peace. “I can surely go to sleep without being disturbed; they will behave themselves,” he said. But they did not, nor had Hans Castorp been sincere in his conviction that they would. For his part, to tell the truth, he would not have understood it if they had. Notwithstanding which, he indulged in soundless expressions of utter astonishment as he listened. “Unheard of,” he whispered. “It’s incredible—who would have believed it?” And between such exclamations joined again in the insipid music that swelled insistently up from the Platz.","This was, of course, no way to fall asleep, and Hans Castorp now felt no inclination to do so, either. Now that he had such a new, vivid understanding of why Joachim had blushed, the whole world seemed new, and that sense of extravagant joy and hope stirred again deep within him. But he was still waiting for something else, too, although he did not really ask himself what it was. But when he heard his neighbors on the right and left ending their evening rest cure and returning to their rooms to exchange one horizontal position outside for another inside, he announced to himself his conviction that the barbaric married couple would be quiet. “I’ll be able to fall peacefully asleep,” he thought. “They’ll be quiet this evening, at least I certainly expect them to be.” But they weren’t, and in all honesty Hans Castorp had not assumed they would be—to tell the truth, from his personal point of view, he would not have understood it if they had remained quiet. Nevertheless, he blurted out a monotone cry of furious amazement at what he now heard. “Scandalous!” he cried under his breath. “That’s outrageous. Who would have thought it possible?” And periodically his lips returned to their whispered whistling of the operetta melody, which was still surging stubbornly in the distance."

"Hans Castorp stand starr und blickte ins Weite. Dann wandte er sich hastig um und begriff wenigstens so viel, daß das Abscheuliche ein Scherz, eine abgekartete Fopperei gewesen sein mußte, denn er sah an den Schultern der Abziehenden, daß sie lachten, und ein untersetzter Jüngling mit Wulstlippen, welcher, beide Hände in den Hosentaschen, auf ziemlich unschickliche Art seine Jacke emporgerafft hielt, drehte sogar unverhohlen den Kopf nach ihm und lachte … Joachim war herangekommen. Er grüßte die Gruppe, indem er nach seiner ritterlichen Gewohnheit beinahe Front machte und sich mit zusammengezogenen Absätzen verbeugte, und trat dann sanft blickend zu seinem Vetter.","Hans Castorp stood rigid and looked into the distance. Then he turned around hastily and understood at least that much that the abominable thing must have been a joke, a set-up trick, for he saw on the shoulders of those who were leaving that they were laughing, and a stocky youth with bulging lips, who, with both hands in in his trouser pockets, holding his jacket up in a rather unseemly way, even turned his head openly towards him and laughed... Joachim had come over. He saluted the group, almost fronting and bowing with heels together, in the manner of his chivalry, and then went to his cousin, looking softly.","Hans Castorp stood and stared. In a moment he turned round, understanding at least so much, that the atrocious thing must have been a joke, a put-up job; for he saw over his shoulder that they were laughing as they went, that a stodgy, thick-lipped youth, whose coat was turned up in an unseemly way about him so that he could put both hands in his trouser pockets, turned his head and laughed quite openly. Joachim approached. He had greeted the group with his usual punctiliousness, almost pausing, and bowing with heels together; now he came mildly up to his cousin.","Hans Castorp stood there aghast, staring straight ahead. Then he quickly turned around and decided that the horrid sound must have been a joke, a prearranged prank—that much at least was clear now, because as they moved off he saw their shoulders jiggling with laughter, and one stocky lad with thick lips, his hands stuck in his pants pockets, hitching his jacket up in a rather unbecoming way, blatantly turned to look back—and laughed. Joachim had caught up by now. He greeted the party in his usual chivalrous way, bowing and clicking his heels, almost standing at attention, and there was a gentle look in his eye as he joined his cousin."
"»Guten Morgen!« sagte er. »Haben Sie wohl geruht? Ich hoffe, Sie haben von Ihrer schönen Minka geträumt? … Nein, wie Sie gleich rot werden, wenn man sie nur erwähnt! Ganz vernarrt sind Sie in sie, das leugnen Sie nur lieber nicht!«","""Good morning!"" he said. 'Have you been resting? I hope you dreamed about your beautiful Minka? ... No, how you'll blush just by mentioning them! You're infatuated with her, you better not deny it!'","“Good-morning,” he greeted her, “I hope you slept well and dreamed of your charmer? Mistress Mary, quite contrary—or whatever her name is! Upon my word, one has only to speak of her to make you blush! You have completely lost your head over her—you can’t deny it.”","“Good morning,” he said. “Did you rest well? You did dream about lovely Minka, your Russian miss, didn’t you? No, look at you blush at the mere mention of her. You’re terribly infatuated, don’t try to deny it.”"

"Auf dem Wege von links kam ein Fremder daher, ein zierlicher brünetter Herr mit schön gedrehtem schwarzen Schnurrbart und in hellkariertem Beinkleid, der, herangekommen, mit Joachim einen Morgengruß tauschte – der seine war präzis und wohllautend – und mit gekreuzten Füßen, auf seinen Stock gestützt, in anmutiger Haltung vor ihm stehen blieb.","On the path from the left came a stranger, a petite dark-haired gentleman with a beautifully twisted black mustache and in light checked trousers, who approached and exchanged a morning greeting with Joachim - his was precise and euphonious - and with crossed feet, leaning on his cane , stood gracefully in front of him.","A stranger was approaching them from the left, a dark man of graceful carriage, with curling black moustaches, wearing light-coloured check trousers.

"Wir haben da nur auf gut Glück aus dem Uferlosen ein Beispiel herausgegriffen dafür, wie er es darauf anlegte, die Vernunft zu stören. Aber noch schlimmer wurde es, wenn er auf die Wissenschaft zu sprechen kam, – an die er nicht glaubte. Er glaube nicht an sie, sagte er, denn es stehe dem Menschen völlig frei, an sie zu glauben oder nicht. Sie sei ein Glaube, wie jeder andere, nur schlechter und dümmer als jeder andere, und das Wort »Wissenschaft« selbst sei der Ausdruck des stupidesten Realismus, der sich nicht schäme, die mehr als fragwürdigen Spiegelungen der Objekte im menschlichen Intellekt für bare Münze zu nehmen oder auszugeben und die geist- und trostloseste Dogmatik daraus zu bereiten, die der Menschheit je zugemutet worden sei. Ob etwa nicht der Begriff einer an und für sich existierenden Sinnenwelt der lächerlichste aller Selbstwidersprüche sei? Aber die moderne Naturwissenschaft als Dogma lebe einzig und allein von der metaphysischen Voraussetzung, daß die Erkenntnisformen unserer Organisation, Raum, Zeit und Kausalität, in denen die Erscheinungswelt sich abspiele, reale Verhältnisse seien, die unabhängig von unserer Erkenntnis existierten. Diese monistische Behauptung sei die nackteste Unverschämtheit, die man dem Geiste je geboten. Raum, Zeit und Kausalität, das heiße auf monistisch: Entwicklung, – und da habe man das Zentraldogma der freidenkerisch-atheistischen Afterreligion, womit man das erste Buch Mosis außer Kraft zu setzen und einer verdummenden Fabel aufklärendes Wissen entgegenzustellen meine, als ob Haeckel bei der Entstehung der Erde zugegen gewesen sei. Empirie! Der Weltäther sei wohl exakt? Das Atom, dieser nette mathematische Scherz des »kleinsten, unteilbaren Teilchens« – bewiesen? Die Lehre von der Unendlichkeit des Raumes und der Zeit fuße {1049}sicherlich auf Erfahrung? In der Tat, man werde, ein wenig Logik vorausgesetzt, zu lustigen Erfahrungen und Ergebnissen gelangen mit dem Dogma von der Unendlichkeit und Realität des Raumes und der Zeit: nämlich zum Ergebnis des Nichts. Nämlich zur Einsicht, daß Realismus der wahre Nihilismus sei. Warum? Aus dem einfachen Grunde, weil das Verhältnis jeder beliebigen Größe zum Unendlichen gleich null sei. Es gebe keine Größe im Unendlichen und weder Dauer noch Veränderung in der Ewigkeit. Im räumlich Unendlichen könne es, da jede Distanz dort mathematisch gleich null sei, nicht einmal zwei Punkte nebeneinander, geschweige denn Körper, geschweige denn gar Bewegung geben. Dies stelle er, Naphta, fest, um der Dreistigkeit zu begegnen, mit der die materialistische Wissenschaft ihre astronomischen Flausen, ihr windiges Geschwätz vom »Universum« für absolute Erkenntnis ausgäbe. Beklagenswerte Menschheit, die sich durch ein prahlerisches Aufgebot nichtiger Zahlen ins Gefühl eigener Nichtigkeit habe drängen, um das Pathos der eigenen Wichtigkeit habe bringen lassen! Denn es möge noch leidlich heißen, wenn menschliche Vernunft und Erkenntnis sich im Irdischen hielten und in dieser Sphäre ihre Erlebnisse mit den Subjektiv-Objekten als real behandle. Greife sie aber darüber hinaus ins ewige Rätsel, indem sie sogenannte Kosmologie, Kosmogonie treibe, so höre der Spaß auf, und die Anmaßung komme auf den Gipfel ihrer Ungeheuerlichkeit. Welch ein lästerlicher Unsinn, im Grunde, die »Entfernung« irgendeines Sternes von der Erde nach Trillionen Kilometern oder auch Lichtjahren zu berechnen und sich einzubilden, mit solchem Zifferngeflunker verschaffe man dem Menschengeist Einblick ins Wesen der Unendlichkeit und Ewigkeit, – während doch Unendlichkeit mit Größe und Ewigkeit mit Dauer und Zeitdistanzen überhaupt und schlechterdings nichts zu schaffen hätten, sondern, weit entfernt, naturwissenschaftliche Begriffe zu sein, vielmehr geradezu die {1050}Aufhebung dessen bedeuteten, was wir Natur nennten! Wahrhaftig, die Einfalt eines Kindes, das glaube, die Sterne seien Löcher im Himmelszelt, durch welche die ewige Klarheit scheine, sei ihm vieltausendmal lieber, als das ganze hohle, widersinnige und anmaßende Geschwätz, das die monistische Wissenschaft vom »Weltall« verübe!","We just randomly picked out an example from the vast expanse of how he set about disturbing reason. But it got worse when he turned to science—in which he didn't believe. He doesn't believe in them, he said, because people are completely free to believe in them or not. It is a faith like any other, only worse and stupider than any other, and the word ""science"" itself is the expression of the most stupid realism that is not ashamed to accept at face value the more than questionable reflections of objects in the human intellect take it or give it out and use it to prepare the most inane and hopeless dogmatics that mankind has ever been expected of. Isn't the concept of a sensory world existing in and for itself the most ridiculous of all self-contradictions? But modern natural science as a dogma lives solely on the metaphysical presupposition that the forms of knowledge of our organization, space, time and causality, in which the world of phenomena takes place, are real conditions that exist independently of our knowledge. This monistic assertion is the most naked insolence that the spirit has ever been offered. Space, time and causality, that means in monistic terms: development, - and there you have the central dogma of the free-thinking, atheistic post-religion, by which you mean to override the first book of Moses and to oppose a dumbing-down fable with enlightening knowledge, as if Haeckel were formation of the earth was present. empiricism! The world ether is probably exact? The atom, that nice mathematical quip about the ""smallest, indivisible particle"" - proven? The doctrine of the infinity of space and time is {1049}certainly based on experience? In fact, given a little logic, one will arrive at amusing experiences and results with the dogma of the infinity and reality of space and time: namely the result of nothing. Namely, to realize that realism is true nihilism. Why? For the simple reason that the ratio of any quantity to infinity is zero. There is no size in infinity and neither duration nor change in eternity. In spatial infinity, since every distance there is mathematically equal to zero, there cannot even be two points next to each other, let alone bodies, let alone movement. He, Naphta, states this in order to counteract the audacity with which materialistic science passes off its astronomical nonsense, its windy chatter about the ""universe"" for absolute knowledge. Deplorable mankind, who let a boastful array of vain numbers urge them to feel their own nullity, deprived of the pathos of their own importance! For it may still be called tolerable if human reason and knowledge remain in the earthly sphere and treat their experiences with the subjective objects as real in this sphere. But if it goes beyond that into the eternal enigma by pursuing so-called cosmology, cosmogony, then the fun stops and the arrogance reaches the peak of its monstrosity. What blasphemous nonsense, basically, to calculate the ""distance"" of any star from the earth in trillions of kilometers or even light years and to imagine that with such nonsense about figures one gives the human spirit an insight into the nature of infinity and eternity - while infinity is great and eternity had absolutely nothing to do with duration and time distances, but, far from being scientific concepts, actually meant the {1050}abolition of what we called nature! Truly, the simplicity of a child who believes that the stars are holes in the sky, through which eternal clarity shines, is a thousand times dearer to him than all the hollow, absurd, and presumptuous chatter that the monistic science of the ""universe"" perpetrates!","Out of his shoreless stream of words, we have hit upon these in illustration of the way he sought to confound the reason. But even worse was the way he talked about science—in which he did not believe. He did not believe, he said, in it, because it was permissible to exercise choice, whether to believe in it or not. It was a belief, like any other, only worse, stupider than any; the word science was the expression of the silliest realism, which did not blush to take at their face value the more than dubious reflections of objects in the human intellect; to pass them current, and to shape out of them the sorriest, most spiritless dogma ever imposed upon humanity. Was not the idea of a material world existing by and for itself the most laughable of all selfcontradictions? But the modern natural sciences, as dogma, rested upon the metaphysical postulate that time, space, and causality, the forms of cognition, in which all phenomena are enacted, are actual conditions, existing independently of our knowledge of them. This monistic position was an insult to the spirit. Space, time, and causality—in monistic language, evolution: here was the central dogma of a freethinking, atheistical, bastard religion, by virtue of which one thought to supersede the first book of Moses, and oppose the pure light of knowledge to a stultifying fable—as though Haeckel had been present at the creation! Empiricism! The universal ether— based on exact knowledge, of course? The atom, that pretty mathematical joke of the smallest, the indivisible particle of matter—its existence had been demonstrated, undoubtedly? The doctrine of the illimitability of time and space was, surely, based on experience? In fact, anybody with a very little logic could make very merry over the theory of the endlessness and the reality of space and time; and could arrive at the result of—nothing: that is, at the view that realism is your true nihilism. How? Quite simply; since the relation to infinity of any size you chose to postulate was as zero. There was no size to the infinite; in eternity was neither duration nor change. In the spatially infinite, since every distance was, mathematically, as zero, there could not even be two points close together, to say nothing of two bodies, or of motion as such. He, Naphta, stated this, in order to counter the arrogance of materialistic science, which gave out for absolute knowledge its astronomical quackery, its windbaggery about the universe. Pitiable human kind, that by a vain mustering of meaningless figures have let themselves be driven to a conclusion of their own insignificance, to the destruction of any emphasis upon their own importance! It might be tolerable that human reason and knowledge should confine themselves to the terrestrial, and within this sphere treat as actual their experience with the subjective object. But let them go beyond that, let them once attempt to grapple with the riddle of eternity, and invent so-called cosmologies and cosmogonies, and it was beyond a jest; the presumptuousness of it reached a climax. What blasphemous rubbish, to reckon the “distance” of any star from the earth in terms of trillions of kilometres, or in light years, and to imagine that with such a parade of figures the human spirit was gaining an insight into the essence of infinity and eternity—whereas infinity had absolutely nothing whatever to do with size, nor yet eternity with duration or distance in time; they had nothing in common with natural science, being, as they were, the abrogation of that which we called nature! Verily, the simplicity of a child, who thinks the stars are holes in the tent of heaven, through which the eternal brightness shines, was a thousand times more to his mind than the whole hollow, preposterous, overweening drivel of monistic science on the subject of the “universe.”","We have lifted one example, quite at random, from among his infinite attempts to rupture reason. But things got even worse when he turned to science—in which he did not believe. He did not believe in it, he said, for every man was perfectly free to believe in it or not. It was a faith like any other, only worse and more obtuse than all the rest; and the word “science” itself was the expression of the most stupid sort of realism, which did not blush at taking at face value the dubious reflections that objects left on the human mind and seeing them as the basis for the most dismal and vapid dogma anyone ever foisted on humanity. Was not the very idea of a world of senses that existed in and of itself the most ridiculous of all possible self-contradictions? But as a dogma, modern natural science lived exclusively and solely from the metaphysical assumption that the forms by which we recognize and organize reality—space, time, causality—reflect a real state of affairs existing independent of our knowledge. That monistic claim was the most naked piece of effrontery the Spirit had ever had to endure. Space, time, and causality—in monistic terms that meant evolution. And there you had the central dogma of atheistic freethinkers and their pseudo-religion, which presumed to abolish the Book of Genesis and replace it with a stultifying fable of enlightened knowledge, as if Haeckel had been present at the creation of the earth. Empiricism? The ether of space—that was exact, was it? The atom, that nice little mathematical joke, “the smallest, indivisible particle”—proved, was it? The theory of infinite space and time—that was definitely based on experience, was it? Indeed, with just a modicum of logic, one could achieve very amusing results from the dogma of infinite space and time—to wit: nothing. To wit, the insight that realism was true nihilism. And why? For the simple reason that in relation to infinity any given unit of mass approached zero. There was no size in infinity, and no duration or change in eternity, either. In infinite space, given that every distance is the mathematical equivalent of zero, there could be no two adjacent points, let alone a body, let alone movement. He, Naphta, asserted this to counter the impudence with which materialistic science passed off as absolute knowledge all its astronomical bunkum and windy palaver about the “universe.” We ought to pity a humanity that had let a tawdry array of flimsy numbers compel it to believe in its own nothingness, that had allowed itself to be deprived of the pathos of its own importance. For although it might be tolerable if human reason and knowledge held themselves within earthly bounds and treated the subject-object experience as real within that sphere, the moment it reached out into the eternal riddle, into so-called cosmology or cosmogony, the joke was over, and presumptuousness had achieved the acme of monstrosity. What blasphemous nonsense, ultimately, to measure the “distance” of some star or other from the earth in trillions of miles or even light-years and to imagine that by the ruse of numbers you had given the human spirit an insight into the nature of infinity and eternity—when infinity had absolutely nothing to do with size, nor eternity with duration and distances in time, had nothing in common with the notions of natural science, were the abrogation of what we meant by the word “nature.” Indeed, the child’s simple belief that stars were holes in the tent of heaven through which eternal brightness shone was many thousand times dearer to his heart than all the empty, absurd, and presumptuous babble about the “cosmos” perpetrated by monistic science."

"»Es ist nicht viel, es ist eher billig, du kannst nicht klagen, daß man dich überfordert hier oben«, sagte der Hospitant zu dem Eingesessenen. »Du brauchst also rund 650 Franken den Monat für Wohnung und Essen, und dabei ist ja die ärztliche Behandlung schon einbegriffen. Gut. Nimm an, du wirfst im Monat noch dreißig Franken für Trinkgelder aus, wenn du anständig bist und Wert legst auf freundliche Gesichter. Das sind 680 Franken. Gut. Du wirst mir sagen, daß es noch Spesen und Sporteln gibt. Man hat Auslagen für Getränke, für Kosmetik, für Zigarren, man macht mal einen Ausflug, eine Wagenfahrt, wenn du willst, und dann und wann gibt es eine Schuster- oder Schneiderrechnung. Gut, aber bei alldem bringst du mit dem besten Willen noch keine tausend Franken im Monat unter! Noch keine achthundert Mark! Das sind noch keine 10 000 Mark im Jahr. Mehr ist es auf keinen Fall. Davon lebst du.«","""It's not much, it's rather cheap, you can't complain that you're being overwhelmed up here,"" said the visitor to the inmate. “So you need around 650 francs a month for accommodation and food, and that includes medical treatment. Good. Suppose you spend another thirty francs on tips a month if you're decent and value friendly faces. That's 680 francs. Good. You will tell me that there are still expenses and sports. You have expenses for drinks, for cosmetics, for cigars, you go on an excursion, a car ride if you want, and now and then there is a shoemaker's or tailor's bill. Good, but with all that, you still can't bring in a thousand francs a month with the best will in the world! Not eight hundred marks yet! That's not even 10,000 marks a year. It is definitely not more. That's what you live on.""","“It isn’t much, it is rather cheap than otherwise,” remarked the guest to the old inhabitant. “You cannot complain of being overcharged up here. You need a round six hundred and fifty francs a month for board and lodging, treatment included. Let us assume that you spend another thirty francs for tips, if you are decent and like to have friendly faces about you. That makes six hundred and eighty. Good. Of course I know there are fixed fees and other sorts of small expenses: toilet articles, tobacco, drives, and excursions, now and then a bill for shoes or clothing. Very good. But all that won’t bring it up to a thousand francs, say what you like. Not eight hundred even. That isn’t ten thousand francs a year. Certainly not more. That is what it costs you.”","“It’s not so much, it’s rather cheap. You can’t complain they’re overcharging,” the visitor said to the long-term guest. “You need around six hundred fifty francs a month for room and board, and that’s with medical treatment included. Fine. Let’s assume you give out about thirty francs a month in tips—if you’re a decent fellow and like to see friendly faces. That makes six hundred eighty. Fine. And now you’ll say that there are other fees and expenses. You have to lay out money for drinks, toiletries, cigars, an occasional excursion, a carriage ride if you like, and now and then a bill for the cobbler or tailor. Fine, but even with all that included, try as you will, you’ll still be under a thousand francs a month. That’s not even eight hundred marks! Which adds up to less than ten thousand marks a year. It certainly can’t be more than that. That’s all it costs you.”"

"»Ich bringe ein wenig Logik in Vorschlag«, versetzte Naphta. »Entweder Ptolemäus und die Scholastik behalten recht, und die Welt ist endlich in Zeit und Raum. Dann ist die Gottheit transzendent, der Gegensatz von Gott und Welt bleibt aufrecht, und auch der Mensch ist eine dualistische Existenz: das Problem seiner Seele besteht in dem Widerstreit des Sinnlichen und des Übersinnlichen, und alles Gesellschaftliche ist mit Abstand zweiten Ranges. Nur diesen Individualismus kann ich {602}als konsequent anerkennen. Oder aber Ihre Renaissance-Astronomen fanden die Wahrheit, und der Kosmos ist unendlich. Dann gibt es keine übersinnliche Welt, keinen Dualismus; das Jenseits ist ins Diesseits aufgenommen, der Gegensatz von Gott und Natur hinfällig, und da in diesem Falle auch die menschliche Persönlichkeit nicht mehr Kriegsschauplatz zweier feindlicher Prinzipien, sondern harmonisch, sondern einheitlich ist, so beruht der innermenschliche Konflikt lediglich auf dem der Einzel- und der gesamtheitlichen Interessen, und der Zweck des Staates wird, wie es gut heidnisch ist, zum Gesetz des Sittlichen. Eines oder das andere.«","""I suggest a little logic,"" Naphta replied. 'Either Ptolemy or scholasticism are right, and the world is finite in time and space. Then the divinity is transcendent, the opposition between God and world remains intact, and man too is a dualistic existence: the problem of his soul consists in the conflict between the sensual and the supersensible, and everything social is by far second-rate. I can only {602}recognize this individualism as consistent. Or your Renaissance astronomers found the truth and the cosmos is infinite. Then there is no supernatural world, no dualism; the hereafter has been incorporated into this world, the contrast between God and nature has become obsolete, and since in this case the human personality is no longer a theater of war between two hostile principles, but is harmonious and unitary, the inner-human conflict is based solely on that of the individual and of the common interests, and the purpose of the state becomes, as is well pagan, the law of the moral. One or the other.«","“If I might be permitted,” Naphta interpolated, “to introduce a little logic into the premisses, I should state the question thus: either Ptolemy and the schoolmen were right, and the world is finite in time and space, the deity is transcendent, the antithesis between God and man is sustained, and man’s being is dual; from which it follows that the problem of his soul consists in the conflict between the spiritual and the material, to which all social problems are entirely secondary—and this is the only sort of individualism I can recognize as consistent—or else, on the other hand, your Renaissance astronomers hit upon the truth, and the cosmos is infinite. Then there exists no suprasensible world, no dualism; the Beyond is absorbed into the Here, the antithesis between God and nature falls; man ceases to be the theatre of a struggle between two hostile principles, and becomes harmonious and unitary, the conflict subsists merely between his individual and his collective interest; and the will of the State becomes, in good pagan wise, the law of morality. Either one thing or the other.”","“I move we apply a little logic here,” Naphta retorted. “Either Ptolemy and the scholastics are right, and the world is finite in time and space, which means that God is transcendent and the polarity of God and world is maintained, so that man, too, leads a dualistic existence, and the problem of his soul rests in the conflict between what his senses register and what transcends his senses, making all social issues entirely secondary—this is indeed the only form of individualism that I recognize as logically consistent. Or, conversely, your Renaissance astronomers discovered the truth, and the cosmos is infinite, which means there is no world that transcends the senses, no dualism; the world beyond is absorbed into this world, the polarity of God and nature is annulled, and since the human personality is no longer the battlefield of two hostile principles, but rather harmonious and unified, all human conflict stems from the clash between the interests of the individual and of society as a whole, and so the purposes of the state become the law of morality, just as in good old heathen days. It’s either one or the other.”"
"»Ich bitte um Zutritt in diesen edlen Kreis«, sagte er, indem er den Vettern die Hand schüttelte und die übrigen Personen mit einer Verbeugung umfaßte. »Dieser Bierbrauer dort drüben … von dem verzweiflungsvollen Anblick der Bierbrauerin zu schweigen. Aber dieser Herr Magnus, – soeben hat er einen völkerpsychologischen Vortrag gehalten. Wollen Sie hören? ›Unser liebes Deutschland ist eine große Kaserne, gewiß. Aber es steckt viel Tüchtigkeit dahinter, und ich tausche unsere Gediegenheit für die Höflichkeit der andern nicht ein. Was hilft mir alle Höflichkeit, wenn ich vorn und hinten betrogen werde?‹ In diesem Stile. Ich bin am Rand meiner Kräfte. Dann sitzt da mir gegenüber ein armes Wesen mit Friedhofsrosen auf den Backen, eine alte Jungfer aus Siebenbürgen, die ohne Unterbrechung von ihrem ›Schwager‹ spricht, einem Menschen, von dem niemand etwas weiß, noch wissen will. Kurzum, ich kann nicht mehr, ich habe mich aus dem Staub gemacht.«","""I request admission into this noble circle,"" he said, shaking hands with the cousins and embracing the others with a bow.

'Our dear Germany is one big barracks, of course. But there's a lot of skill behind it, and I won't trade our solidity for the politeness of others. What use is all politeness if I'm being deceived in every way?' In that style. I'm at the limit of my strength. Then, across from me, sits a wretched creature with graveyard roses on her cheeks, an old maid from Transylvania, who keeps talking about her 'brother-in-law', a person nobody knows or wants to know anything about. In short, I can't take it anymore, I've run away.""","“May I beg for admission into this charmed circle?” he would say, shaking hands with the cousins, and comprehending the rest of the table in a sweeping bow. “My brewer over there—not to mention the despairing gaze of the breweress!—But, really, this Herr Magnus! Just now he has been delivering a discourse on folk-psychology. Shall I tell you what he said? ‘The Fatherland, it is true, is one enormous barracks. But all the same it’s got a lot of solid capacity, it’s genuine. I wouldn’t change it for the fine manners of the rest of them. What good are fine manners to me if I’m cheated right and left?’ And more of the same kind. I am at the end of my patience. And opposite me I have a poor creature, with churchyard roses blooming in her cheeks, an old maid from Siebenbürgen, who never stops talking about her brother-in-law, a man we none of us either know or wish to know. I could stand it no longer, I shook their dust from my feet, I bolted.”","“I beg admission to this noble circle,” he would say, shaking both cousins’ hands and including all the others in his bow. “It’s my beer-brewer yonder—not to mention the depressing sight of Madame Beer-brewer. But as for Herr Magnus himself—he has just delivered a lecture on ethnic psychology. Would you like to hear? ‘Our beloved Germany is one huge barracks, granted. But a great deal of hard work went into it, and I would not trade our sturdy honesty for the fine manners of other nations. What good are fine manners if I’m being cheated up one side and down the other?’ In that sort of style. I’m at the breaking point. And then across from me sits a poor creature with graveyard blossoms on her cheeks, an old maid from Transylvania, who goes on endlessly about her ‘brother-in-law,’ a gentleman whom no one knows, nor wishes to know.

"Es war der erste Moribundus, den Hans Castorp in seinem Leben zu sehen bekam, denn seine Eltern sowohl wie der Großvater waren ja damals gleichsam hinter seinem Rücken gestorben. Wie würdevoll der Kopf des jungen Mannes mit aufwärts geschobenem Kinnbart auf dem Kissen gelegen hatte! Wie bedeutend der Blick seiner übergroßen Augen gewesen war, als er sie langsam zur Tür gedreht hatte! Hans Castorp, noch ganz vertieft in den flüchtigen Anblick, versuchte unwillkürlich, ebenso große, bedeutende und langsame Augen wie der Moribundus zu machen, während er weiter zur Treppe ging, und mit diesen Augen blickte er eine Dame an, die hinter ihm aus einer Tür getreten war und ihn am Treppenkopf überholte. Er erkannte nicht gleich, daß es Madame Chauchat war. Sie lächelte leise über die Augen, die er machte, stützte dann mit der Hand die Flechte an ihrem Hinterkopf und ging vor ihm die Treppe hinunter, geräuschlos, schmiegsam und etwas vorgeschobenen Kopfes.","It was the first moribundus that Hans Castorp saw in his life, because both his parents and his grandfather had died behind his back, so to speak. How dignified the young man's head had been lying on the pillow with his beard pushed up! How significant the look in his oversized eyes had been as he slowly turned them towards the door! Hans Castorp, still engrossed in the fleeting sight, tried involuntarily to make eyes as large, significant and slow as the moribundus as he walked on towards the stairs, and with those eyes he looked at a lady who was coming out of a door behind him kicked and overtook him at the top of the stairs. He didn't recognize at first that it was Madame Chauchat. She smiled softly at the eyes he made, then supported the braid on the back of her head with her hand and walked down the stairs in front of him, silently, pliantly and with her head slightly forward.","This was the first dying man Hans Castorp had ever seen; for his father and mother, and his grandfather too had died, so to speak, behind his back. How full of dignity the young man’s head, with the little beard thrust upward, had lain upon his pillow! How speaking the glance those unnaturally great eyes had slowly turned upon the door! Hans Castorp, still quite absorbed by that glimpse, instinctively tried to make his own eyes as large, as slowly gazing and meaningful as those of the dying man, walking on as he did so, toward the stairs, and encountering a lady who came out of a room behind him and overtook him at the landing. He did not at once realize that it was Madame Chauchat; she, on her side, smiled at the eyes he was making at her, put her hands to the braids at the back of her head, and passed before him down the stairs, soundless, supple, with her head somewhat thrust out.","This was the first moribundus that Hans Castorp had ever seen in his life, inasmuch as both his parents and his grandfather had died behind his back, so to speak.

Returning to the stairway now, still absorbed in that fleeting glimpse, Hans Castorp instinctively tried to make the same large, meaningful, and deliberate eyes as those:-of the dying man; and it was with that look that he greeted a lady who had emerged from a door behind him and caught up with him now at the head of the stairs.
