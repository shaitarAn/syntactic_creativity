"»Famos, famos, jetzt hab ich’s! Damit kriegen wir den Karren aus dem Dreck. Klar wie Stiefelwichs! Ich erklär ihnen halt allen, du warst b’soffen wie ein Schwein und hast nicht g’wußt, was d’redst. Ehrenwort hast doch keins ’geben?«","""Great, great, now I've got it! That'll get the cart out of the mud. Clear as boot wax! I'll just tell them all that you were drunk as a pig and didn't know what you were talking about. You didn't give a word of honour?""","“Famous, excellent, now I know what to do! That’s the way to get us out of the mire and away scot free! Clear as day! I’ll just tell ’em all you’d gone on the spree, been drinking like a fish, hadn’t the faintest what you were saying, couldn’t even hear straight and must have misunderstood whatever they asked you.","‘Capital, capital, now I’ve got it! That’s how we’ll clear up the mess. It’s clear as daylight. I’ll simply tell them all you were as drunk as a lord and didn’t know what you were saying. You didn’t give your word of honour, I suppose?’"
"»Nein, so geht’s nicht«, äußerte er schließlich betrübt, ohne den Kopf zu heben. »Am besten, Herr Leutnant, ich schick den Chauffeur in die Kaserne und laß einen anderen Rock holen. So können Herr Leutnant nicht ausgehen. Aber verlassen sich Herr Leutnant darauf, in einer Stunde ist alles getrocknet und ich bügel die Hose gleich sauber auf.«","""No, it won't work like that,"" he finally said sadly, without raising his head. 'It would be best, Herr Leutnant, I'd send the chauffeur to the barracks and have another coat fetched. Herr Leutnant can't go out like that. But rely on it, Herr Leutnant, everything will be dry in an hour and I'll iron the trousers clean straight away.""","“No, it’s no good,” he said apologetically at last, without looking up. “It will be best if I send the chauffeur to the barracks to fetch you a change of clothes, sir. You can’t go back like that, Lieutenant. But depend on it, sir, it will all be dry in an hour’s time, and I’ll iron your trousers nicely.”","‘No, it’s no good,’ he said sadly at last, without raising his head. ‘I had better send the chauffeur to the barracks to fetch another coat for the Herr Leutnant. The Herr Leutnant cannot go out like this. But the Herr Leutnant may rest assured that everything will be dry in an hour’s time, and I shall give the trousers a good press.’"
"Der Regimentsarzt Goldbaum, wirklich Sohn eines Goldschmieds in Drohobycz, stülpt den Zwicker auf die etwas dickliche Nase, nimmt die Tabatière, wiegt sie, beschaut sie von allen Seiten und klopft sie geschult mit dem Knöchel ab.","The regimental doctor Goldbaum, actually the son of a goldsmith in Drohobycz, puts his pince-nez on his somewhat plump nose, takes the snuff box, weighs it, examines it from all sides and, in a trained manner, knocks it down with his knuckles.","Dr Goldbaum, who is indeed the son of a goldsmith in Drohobycz, puts his pince-nez on his rather fleshy nose, picks up the cigarette case, weighs it in his own hand, examines it from all angles and taps it expertly with a knuckle.","Goldbaum, who was the son of a Jewish goldsmith in Drohobycz, clamped his pince-nez on to his somewhat fleshy nose, took the cigarette-case, weighed it, examined every facet of it and rapped on it with his knuckles in the manner of an expert."
"Ich bin nicht sehr zufrieden mit mir. Warum diese merkwürdige Eile Ilonas, diese Geniertheit, als fürchte sie sich, mit mir gesehen zu werden, und wozu dieses hitzige Losfahren? Und dann: wenigstens einen Gruß hätte ich höflicherweise mitschicken sollen an den Vater, irgendein nettes Wort an Edith, sie haben mir doch nichts getan! Aber anderseits bin ich auch zufrieden mit meiner reservierten Haltung. Ich habe standgehalten. Jetzt können sie wenigstens von mir nicht denken, daß ich mich ihnen aufdrängen will.","I'm not very happy with myself. Why Ilona's strange haste, this embarrassment, as if she were afraid to be seen with me, and why this heated drive off? And then: To be polite, I should have at least sent a greeting to Father, a kind word to Edith, they didn't do anything to me! But on the other hand, I'm also satisfied with my reserved attitude. I stood my ground. Now at least they can't think of me as trying to impose myself on them.","I am not very pleased with myself. Why this curious haste on Ilona’s part, that awkwardness, as if she were afraid of being seen with me, and why her swift departure? What’s more, out of mere courtesy I ought to have asked her to give my regards to Edith’s father, I should have sent a kind message to Edith, what have they done to harm me? On the other hand I am quite pleased to have shown some reserve. I did hold out. Now at least they can’t think that I am trying to force my company on them.","I wasn’t very pleased with myself, I can tell you. Why had Ilona been in such a hurry , why had she been so embarrassed, as though she were afraid of being seen with me, and why had she driven off so impetuously? And then, too, I ought at least to have sent my regards to her uncle and some little message to Edith; after all, they’d done me no harm. But, on the other hand, I was pleased with my reserved behaviour, I had stood my ground. Now at least they couldn’t say that I tried to thrust myself on them."
"»Haben Sie Lust auf eine Partie?« konnte ich jetzt Edith unbefangen fragen, und","""Would you like to play a game?"" I was able to ask Edith impartially, and","I could now ask Edith, “Would you care for a game of chess?”",‘Would you care for a game?’ I was able to ask Edith in a casual tone.
"Mit einer zögernden Bewegung nahm Condor das Blatt, einen beunruhigten Blick auf mich werfend, ehe er hinüber ging zum kleinen Lichtkreis der Lampe. Er las stumm und langsam. Dann faltete er das Blatt zusammen und äußerte ganz ruhig in dem sachlichsten Ton der Selbstverständlichkeit:","With a hesitant movement, Condor took the sheet, casting a worried look at me before walking over to the lamp's small circle of light. He read silently and slowly. Then he folded the sheet of paper and said very calmly in the most matter-of-fact tone of matter-of-factness:","Casting me an uneasy glance, Condor hesitantly took the sheet of paper before going over to the little circle of lamplight. He read it slowly and in silence. Then he folded the paper up again and said very calmly, in a matter-of-fact tone suggesting that he was stating the obvious, “I take it that, after what I told you just now, you are fully aware of the consequences?","Hesitatingly Condor took the document, throwing me an uneasy look before going over to the tiny circle of lamplight. He read it slowly, and in silence. Then he folded it up and said quite calmly, in perfectly matter-of-fact tones:"
"»Weg … weg … weg, Sie gemeiner, Sie roher Mensch …«","""Gone... gone... gone, you mean, you rude man...""","I tried to raise her light body, but she resisted, and shouted at me, “Go away … away … away, you horrible, beastly man!”","‘Go away ... go away!’ she sobbed. ‘You beast, you brute!’"

"Ich beugte mich nieder und küßte ihre Hand. Als ich aufsah, begriff ich nicht, daß mir diese Frau mit ihrem grauen Haar, ihrem herben Mund und der Bitternis ihrer blinden Augen zuerst häßlich erschienen war. Denn ihr Antlitz leuchtete von Liebe und menschlichem Mitgefühl. Mir war, als ob diese nur das Dunkel ewig spiegelnden Augen mehr vom Wirklichen des Lebens wüßten als all jene, die hell und strahlend in die Welt sehen.","I bent down and kissed her hand. When I looked up, I didn't understand that this woman, with her gray hair, her harsh mouth and the bitterness of her blind eyes, had struck me as ugly at first. For her face shone with love and human compassion. It seemed to me as if these eyes, which only ever reflected the darkness, knew more about the reality of life than all those who see the world brightly and radiantly.","I bent down and kissed her hand. When I looked up, I couldn’t understand how this woman, with her grey hair, her bitter mouth and the sadness of her blind eyes, could have struck me at first sight as ugly. Her face was radiant with love and human sympathy. I felt as if those eyes that never reflected anything but darkness knew more about the reality of life than all the eyes that see the world shining in its full brightness.","I bent down and kissed her hand. When I looked up, I could not understand how this woman with the grey hair, the harsh mouth, and that bitter look in her blind eyes had at first seemed ugly to me. For her countenance now shone with love and human sympathy. I felt as though those eyes that mirrored nothing but eternal darkness knew more of the reality of life than all those that gazed out, clear and radiant, upon the world."
"Jetzt erst begriff ich, was sie meinte; die Vorstellung war tatsächlich zu absurd für mich gewesen, ich sollte mir, ich, der ich gerade meine letzten baren sieben Kronen für jene Blumen ausgegeben hatte und dem jeder Abstecher nach Wien trotz der halben Fahrkarte schon eine Art Luxus bedeutete, so mir nichts dir nichts eine Reise ins Engadin leisten.","Only then did I understand what she meant; the idea had actually been too absurd for me, I should, I, who had just spent my last cash kroner on those flowers and for whom every trip to Vienna, despite half the ticket, was a kind of luxury, so I shouldn't care make a trip to the Engadin.","Only now did I understand her. When I had just spent my last seven crowns on the flowers I had brought her, when every trip to Vienna was a kind of luxury, even though as military men we could travel half price, the idea that I could afford a trip to the Engadine valley had really been too absurd even to occur to me.","And only now did I realize what she meant; the idea that I, I who had just spent my last seven crowns in cash on flowers and to whom every trip to Vienna was a luxury despite the fifty per cent reduction on the fare, should go off just like that for a holiday in the Engadine was too absurd even to contemplate."
Etwas schien mir in seinem laschen Wesen verändert. Erregt und beherrscht zugleich stapfte er voran in das Lokal und befahl der eilfertigen Kellnerin beinahe grob: »Einen Liter Wein. Denselben wie vorgestern. Und lassen Sie uns dann allein. Ich ruf Sie schon.«,"Something seemed to have changed in his lax nature. Excited and controlled at the same time, he trudged ahead into the bar and ordered the hasty waitress, almost rudely: ""A liter of wine. The same as the day before yesterday. And then leave us alone. I'll call you.""","I could tell that his former almost listless bearing had changed. He marched ahead of me into the inn in a manner that was both energetic and self-controlled, and asked the waitress who came hurrying up for, “A litre of wine—the same as we were drinking the day before yesterday. And then leave us alone; I’ll call if I need you.”","He seemed, somehow, different from the flabby creature of a few days ago. Agitated and yet controlled, he marched on ahead of me into the bar and almost rudely ordered the waitress who came hurrying up: ‘A litre of wine. The same as we had the other day. And leave us alone. I’ll call you when I want you.’"
"Hastig habe ich die Tür aufgestoßen, und sofort regt sich, wie aus dem Schatten herausgewachsen, im äußersten Ende des verdunkelten Raumes (Kusma hat die Rolläden der Hitze wegen herabgelassen) eine Gestalt. Schon will ich Condor herzlich entgegen, da erkenne ich – das ist doch gar nicht Condor. Es ist jemand anderer, der hier auf mich wartet, und gerade der Mensch, den ich am wenigsten hier erwartet hätte. Es ist Kekesfalva: auch wenn das Dunkel noch dichter wäre, würde ich ihn unter Tausenden an seinem verschüchterten Aufstehen und Sicherverbeugen erkennen. Und noch ehe er räuspernd zum Sprechen ansetzt, weiß ich schon den demütigen, den erschütterten Ton seiner Stimme voraus.","I hastily pushed open the door, and immediately a figure stirred, as if it had grown out of the shadows, at the far end of the darkened room (Kuzma has lowered the blinds because of the heat). I'm about to say hello to Condor when I realize - that's not Condor at all. It's someone else waiting for me here, and the very person I least expected to be here. It is Kekesfalva: even if the darkness were thicker, I would recognize him among thousands by his timid rising and sure bow. And even before he clears his throat and begins to speak, I already know the humble, shaken tone of his voice.","When I quickly push the door open, a figure instantly moves as if materialising from the shadows at the far end of the darkened room; Kusma has let down the roller blinds because of the heat. I am about to hurry to welcome Condor when I see that it isn’t Condor after all. Someone else is waiting for me, the very last person I would have expected to see here. It is Kekesfalva; if the room were even darker I would still know him from his timid way of rising and bowing. And before he clears his throat as a prelude to addressing me I know in advance the humble, diffident voice in which he will speak.","As I threw open the door a figure stirred, seemed to take shape out of the shadows of the darkened room (Kusma had pulled down the blinds because of the heat). I was just about to give Condor a hearty greeting when I realized — this was not Condor at all. It was someone else waiting for me, the very person whom I had least expected to find here — Kekesfalva. Even had the darkness been denser I should have recognized him among thousands by the timid way in which he got up and bowed. And even before he cleared his throat to speak, I imagined I could hear his dejected, despondent tones."
"Früher als sonst (ich hatte mich eigens freigemacht) erschien ich darum am nächsten Tage. Diesmal empfing mich Ilona allein. Der Arzt aus Wien sei gekommen, erklärte sie mir, er sei jetzt bei Edith und scheine sie diesmal besonders gründlich zu untersuchen. Zweieinhalb Stunden sei er schon da, und wahrscheinlich würde Edith dann zu müde sein, um noch herüberzukommen; ich müßte diesmal mit ihr allein vorliebnehmen – das heißt, fügte sie bei, wenn ich nichts Besseres vorhätte.","So I showed up the next day earlier than usual (I had made myself free). This time Ilona received me alone. The doctor from Vienna had come, she explained to me, he was with Edith now and seemed to be examining her particularly thoroughly this time. He's been there for two and a half hours, and Edith would probably be too tired to come over by then; I'd have to be content with her alone this time—that is, she added, if I had nothing better to do.","So I arrived next day earlier than usual, after specially requesting extra leave of absence. This time Ilona received me on her own. The doctor from Vienna had come, she told me, he was now with Edith, and today he seemed to be giving her a particularly thorough examination. He had already been here for two and a half hours, and afterwards Edith would probably be too tired to join us, so I would have to make do with only her, Ilona’s, company—that was to say, she added, if I had nothing better to do.","The next day, therefore (I had specially arranged to get off duty), I turned up earlier than usual at the Kekesfalvas’. Ilona received me. The doctor from Vienna had arrived, she told me; he was with Edith now, and was apparently giving her an especially thorough examination. He had been here for two and a half hours already, and Edith would probably be too tired afterwards to come and join us, so I should have to put up with her company — that was, she added, if I had nothing better to do."
"Er konstatierte das alles scheinbar bloß fachmännisch beflissen. Aber ein anteilnehmender und etwas bestürzter Ton klang verräterisch mit. Und als ich ihm bedeutete, nein, das sei gar nicht nötig, er solle lieber um einen Wagen telephonieren, ich wolle ohnehin gleich nach Hause, da räusperte er sich unvermutet und hob seine guten, etwas müden Augen bittend empor.","He stated all this apparently only professionally assiduous. But a sympathetic and somewhat dismayed tone echoed treacherously. And when I indicated to him that no, that wasn't necessary, that he should telephone for a car, I wanted to go home straight away anyway, he cleared his throat unexpectedly and lifted his good, somewhat tired eyes in a pleading manner.","He spoke almost with the matter-of-fact expertise of a valet. But a sympathetic and rather distressed note in his voice gave him away. And when I said that would not be necessary, and could he telephone for a cab instead, because I wanted to go straight back anyway, he unexpectedly cleared his throat and raised his kindly, rather tired eyes pleadingly.","He stated all this in what appeared to be merely the matter-of-fact tones of an attentive man-servant. But there was an undertone in his voice that betrayed his sympathy and consternation. And when I pointed out that it was not in the least necessary, and that I should prefer him to ring up for a carriage, since I was in any case going straight home, he unexpectedly cleared his throat and raised his kind, somewhat weary eyes pleadingly up to my face."
"Und nun geschieht mir das Unsinnige, daß ich nicht wage, ihr in die blinden Augen zu schauen. Ich habe, ich weiß nicht wieso, das Gefühl, sie wüßte schon alles, sie hätte alles erraten. Eben darum schäme ich mich so sehr und stammle nur:","And now the absurd thing happens to me, that I dare not look into her blind eyes. I have the feeling, I don't know why, that she already knows everything, that she has guessed everything. That's why I'm so ashamed and only stammer:","And now something odd happens; ridiculously, I cannot look the blind woman in the face. I have , I don’t know why, a feeling that she already knows or has guessed everything. The idea makes me feel so ashamed that I can only stammer, “That’s very, very kind of you, ma’am …","And now an absurd thing happened to me: I did not venture to look this blind woman straight in the face. I don’t know why, but I had a feeling that she knew everything, had guessed everything. I felt ashamed, and could only stammer out:"
"Die Erbitterung wuchs in mir, daß er mich so mißverstand. Mich ärgerte, daß dieser im Grunde gutmütige Hartschädel mir durchaus die Steigbügel hinhalten wollte; am Ende meinte er, ich hätte ihn aus Feigheit beim Ärmel gepackt, um mich herauszuretten. Zum Teufel, warum wollte er das Erbärmliche partout nicht begreifen! So riß ich mich zusammen.","The bitterness grew in me that he had so misunderstood me. It annoyed me that this basically good-natured hardhead wanted to hold out the stirrups to me; at the end he said I grabbed his sleeve out of cowardice to save me. Hell, why didn't he want to understand the pathetic! So I pulled myself together.","I was feeling increasingly bitter. He entirely misunderstood me. I didn’t like the way this well-meaning old bonehead was trying to get me out of the mess I was in. He might even think I’d come to him out of cowardice, wanting him to help me. For God’s sake, why couldn’t he understand the pitiful nature of what I’d done? I pulled myself together.","I seethed with indignation to think that he should so misunderstand me. It infuriated me to find that this fundamentally good-natured blockhead was, as it were, trying to hold the stirrup for me; obviously he thought I had buttonholed him out of funk, and wanted him to get me out of a scrape. Devil take it, why shouldn’t he understand? And so I drew myself up."
"Und ohne mir die Hand zu geben, lief er sichtlich verärgert (ich begriff nicht, weswegen) mit seinen kurzen und, wie mir schien, etwas plattfüßigen Beinen dem Bahnhof zu.","And without shaking my hand, he ran, visibly annoyed (I didn't understand why) with his short and, it seemed to me, somewhat flat-footed legs towards the station.","And without shaking hands, visibly ruffled (I had no idea why), he walked away on his short legs and, as it struck me, his rather flat feet to the station.","Without shaking hands, and obviously put out — I could not understand why — he rushed off on his short legs and, as it seemed to me, somewhat flat feet, to the station."
"So setze ich mich auf den harten Holzsessel, den mir der Portier etwas verwundert hinstellt, und warte, die nackten Beine unter dem Mantel verborgen, den Blick starr auf den Apparat gerichtet. Ich warte eine Viertelstunde, eine halbe Stunde, zitternd vor Unruhe und vielleicht Kälte, dazwischen immer wieder mit dem Hemdärmel den plötzlich aufbrechenden Schweiß von der Stirne wischend. Endlich – rrr – eine Klingel. Ich stürze hin, reiße den Hörer: jetzt, jetzt werde ich alles erfahren!","So I sit down on the hard wooden chair, which the doorman puts in front of me, somewhat puzzled, and wait, my bare legs hidden under my coat, my eyes fixed on the phone. I wait a quarter of an hour, half an hour, trembling with restlessness and perhaps cold, in between wiping the suddenly breaking sweat from my forehead with my shirt sleeve. Finally - rrr - a bell. I fall down, snatch the receiver: now, now I will find out everything!","So I sit down on the hard wooden chair that the night porter, rather surprised, gives me, and I wait, my bare legs hidden by my coat, my eyes glued to the telephone. I wait for quarter-of-an-hour, half-an-hour, trembling with uneasiness and perhaps with cold, wiping away the sweat that suddenly breaks out on my forehead with my shirtsleeve. At last—rrrr! rrr!—the telephone rings. I rush to it, snatch up the receiver. Now I shall find out what’s happened!","And so I sat down on the hard wooden chair which the somewhat surprised porter brought for me, and waited, my bare legs hidden under my great-coat, my gaze riveted on the instrument. I waited for a quarter of an hour, half an hour, shivering with anxiety and, I expect, with cold, again and again wiping away with my shirtsleeve the sweat that kept breaking out on my forehead. At last — rrr — a ring. I rushed to the instrument, snatched off the receiver. Now, now I should hear everything."
"»Hofmiller«, ergänze ich.","""Hofmiller,"" I add.","“Hofmiller,” I say.","‘Hofmiller,’ I said."
"»Diesmal, Kind«, lachte er und strich zugleich wieder mit der Hand über ihr Haar (ich verstand, er tat es, damit sein Lachen sie nicht kränken könnte), »hast du dich aber mit dem Abschieben gründlich geirrt. Dieser Herr, der Herr Leutnant Hofmiller, ist glücklicherweise kein Patient, sondern ein Freund, der schon lang versprochen hat, mich zu besuchen, wenn er einmal in die Stadt kommt. Er kann sich ja nur immer abends freimachen, bei Tag steckt er im Dienst. Jetzt bleibt nur die Hauptfrage: hast du auch für ihn etwas Gutes zum Nachtmahl?«","'This time, child,' he laughed, at the same time stroking his hand over her hair again (I understood, he did it so that his laughter wouldn't offend her), 'but you made a big mistake about pushing it off. Fortunately, this gentleman, Herr Leutnant Hofmiller, is not a patient but a friend who has long promised to visit me when he comes to town. He can only take time off in the evening, during the day he's on duty. Now only the main question remains: do you have something good for him for supper too?”","“But this time, my dear,” he laughed, caressing her hair again (I realised that he did that so that the laughter in his voice would not hurt her feelings), “this time you were wrong to put him off. Fortunately this gentleman, Lieutenant Hofmiller, is not a patient but a friend, and he promised long ago to visit me when he was in Vienna. His only time off is in the evening, because he has his military duties by day. Now we just have to settle the main question—do you have something nice we can give him for supper too?”","‘This time, my child,’ he laughed, stroking her hair again (I realized that he was doing this so that she should not be hurt by his laugh), ‘you were wrong to put the gentleman off. Lieutenant Hofmiller is, I’m glad to say, not a patient, but a friend who has long promised to look me up when in town. He can only get off in the evenings, for he’s on duty all day. And now the main thing is: have you anything nice to give us for supper?’"
"Condor unterbrach. »So! Was ich Ihnen bisher berichtete, weiß ich nur aus zweiter Hand. Diese letzte Geschichte aber weiß ich von ihm selbst. Er hat sie mir in der Nacht erzählt, als wir nach der Operation seiner Frau in einem Zimmer des Sanatoriums von zehn Uhr abends bis ins Morgengrauen warteten. Von hier an kann ich mich für jedes Wort verbürgen, denn in solchen Augenblicken lügt man nicht.«","Condor interrupted. ""So! What I have told you so far, I only know second-hand. But I know this last story from himself. He told it to me the night we waited in a room of the sanatorium after his wife's operation from ten o'clock in the evening until dawn. From here on I can vouch for every word, because at such moments one does not lie.”","At this point Condor interrupted himself. “ Well, what I’ve told you so far is known to me only at second hand. This last story, however, I have from Kekesfalva himself. He told it to me on the night of his wife’s operation, when we were sitting in a room in the sanatorium from ten in the evening until dawn, waiting for news. From here on I can vouch for every word. At such moments, no one tells lies.”","Condor broke off. ‘What I have told you so far, I know only at secondhand. The story that follows, however, I had from him himself. He told it me after the operation on his wife, while we sat waiting in a room at the sanatorium from ten o’clock at night until dawn. From this point on I can vouch for every word, for at such moments a man does not lie.’"
"Er war aufgestanden und machte eine heftige Bewegung mit den Armen, als würde ihm mit einmal der Rock zu eng. Plötzlich wandte er sich um.","He had stood up and was shaking his arms violently, as if his skirt were suddenly becoming too tight. Suddenly he turned around.","He had got to his feet and was waving his arms vigorously about, as if his coat suddenly felt too tight for him. Suddenly he turned round.",He got up and threw his arms wide as though he suddenly felt his coat too tight for him.
"Als dann die vier endlosen Jahre vorüber waren, entdeckte ich zu meiner eigenen Überraschung, daß ich in jener früheren Welt trotzdem wieder zu leben vermochte. Denn wir vom Hades Heimkehrenden wogen alle Dinge mit einem neuen Gewicht. Den Tod eines Menschen auf dem Gewissen zu haben, galt einem Weltkriegssoldaten nicht mehr das gleiche wie dem Menschen der Friedenswelt; meine eigene private Schuld, sie hatte sich in dem riesigen Blutsumpf völlig aufgelöst in die allgemeine; denn dasselbe Ich, dieselben Augen, dieselben Hände, hatten doch auch das Maschinengewehr eingestellt, das bei Limanova die erste Welle der russischen Infanterie vor unserem Graben hinmähte, selbst hatte ich mit dem Feldstecher nachher die grassen Augen der durch mich Getöteten, der durch mich Verwundeten gesehen, die im Stacheldraht stundenlang noch stöhnten, ehe sie elend verreckten. Ich hatte vor Görz ein Flugzeug heruntergeholt; dreimal überschlug es sich in der Luft, ehe es mit aufzuckender Stichflamme am Karstgestein zerschellte, und mit eigener Hand hatten wir dann die verkohlten und noch grausig schwelenden Leichen nach der Erkennungsmarke abgesucht. Abertausende, die neben mir in Reih und Glied marschierten, hatten das gleiche getan, mit dem Karabiner, dem Bajonett, dem Flammenwerfer, dem Maschinengewehr und der nackten Faust, Hunderttausende und Millionen meiner Generation in Frankreich, in Rußland und Deutschland – was galt da ein einzelner Mord noch viel, was eine private, persönliche Schuld innerhalb der tausendfältigen und kosmischen, dieser fulminantesten Massenzerstörung und Massenvernichtung menschlichen Lebens, die bisher die Geschichte gekannt?","Then, when the four endless years were up, I discovered to my own surprise that I could still live in that earlier world. For we, the returnees from Hades, weighed all things with a new weight. Having someone's death on one's conscience no longer meant the same for a soldier in the World War as it did for people in the world of peace; my own private guilt, it had completely dissolved into the general one in the huge swamp of blood; because the same I, the same eyes, the same hands, had also adjusted the machine gun that mowed down the first wave of Russian infantry in front of our trench near Limanova, I myself afterwards had the wild eyes of those who had been killed or wounded by me with my binoculars seen moaning for hours in the barbed wire before dying miserably. I had brought down an airplane before Gorizia; it rolled over three times in the air before it smashed into pieces on the karst rock with a spurt of flame, and we then searched the charred and still horribly smoldering corpses for the identification tag with our own hands. Thousands and thousands who marched in rank and file beside me had done the same thing, with the carbine, the bayonet, the flamethrower, the machine gun and the bare fist, hundreds of thousands and millions of my generation in France, in Russia and Germany - who cares single murder much, what a private, personal guilt within the thousandfold and cosmic, this most brilliant mass destruction and mass annihilation of human life that history has known so far?","When those four endless years were over at last, I found to my own surprise that I could go on living in the world as it then was all the same. For we who came home from Hades judged everything by new criteria. To a man who had fought in the Great War, the death of another human being no longer meant what it did to a man in peacetime. My own private guilt had been dissolved in the huge bloodbath of general guilt, for the same man, the same eyes and the same hands, had also set up the machine gun that mowed down the first wave of Russian infantry to attack our trenches at Limanova, and I had even seen, through my field glasses afterwards, the glazed eyes of the men I had killed, and the men I had wounded who lay for hours in the barbed wire, still moaning, before they perished miserably. I had brought down an aircraft outside Görz and seen it turning over three times in the air before crashing on the rocks and going up in flames, and with our own hands we had then searched the charred bodies of the airmen, still smouldering horribly, for identity discs. Thousands upon thousands of the men who marched beside me had done the same, with rifles, bayonets, flame-throwers, machine-guns and their bare hands, hundreds of thousands and millions of my generation had killed enemy soldiers in France, Russia and Germany—what was a single murder beside all that , what was a private, personal guilt within the cosmic, thousandfold guilt, the most terrible mass destruction and mass annihilation yet known to history?","When those four interminable years came to an end, I discovered to my own astonishment that, despite everything, I was able to go on living in my former world. For we who had returned from hell measured everything by new standards. To have the death of a human being on one’s conscience no longer meant the same to a man who had been to the front as to a man of the pre-war era. In the vast blood-bath of the war my own private guilt had been absorbed into the general guilt; for I was the same person, it was the same eyes, the same hands, that had, after all, set up the machine-gun at Limanova which had mown down the first wave of Russian infantry to advance on our trenches, and I myself had afterwards seen through my field-glasses the hideous eyes of those whom I had been instrumental in killing, in wounding, and who, impaled on barbed wire, groaned for hours until they died a pitiable death. I had brought down an aeroplane on the outskirts of Görz; three times it had turned a somersault in the air until it crashed in the Alps and went up in a sheet of flame, and then with our own hands we had searched the charred and still gruesomely smouldering bodies for their identity discs. Thousands upon thousands of those who went to the war with me did the same, with rifle, bayonet, hand-grenade, machine-gun and naked fist, hundreds of thousands, millions of my generation, in France, in Russia and Germany — of what moment, then, was one murder more, what mattered private, personal guilt in the midst of this thousandfold, cosmic destruction and wrecking of human life, the most appalling holocaust history had ever known?"
"Wortlos waren wir bis zur Gittertür gelangt. Um sie zu schließen, mußten wir notwendigerweise zurückblicken. Wie mit bläulichem Phosphor gestrichen leuchtete die Front des Hauses, ein einziger Block blanken Eises, und derart vehement blendete das überschwengliche Mondlicht, daß man nicht unterscheiden konnte, welche der Fenster noch von innen beleuchtet waren und welche von außen. Erst der harte Zuschlag der Türklinke brach die Stille entzwei; gleichsam ermutigt durch dies irdische Geräusch inmitten des geisterhaften Schweigens wandte sich Condor mir mit einer Unbefangenheit zu, die ich nicht erhofft hatte.","Without a word we had reached the lattice door. In order to close them, we had necessarily to look back. The front of the house shone as if it had been painted with bluish phosphorus, a single block of bare ice, and the exuberant moonlight was so vehemently blinding that one could not tell which of the windows were lit from within and which from without. Only the hard slam of the doorknob broke the silence; encouraged, as it were, by that earthly sound in the midst of the ghostly silence, Condor turned to me with an impartiality I had not hoped for.","We had reached the wrought-iron gate without speaking a word. In closing it we necessarily had to look back. The facade of the house looked as if it were painted with bluish phosphorus, and in the dazzling moonlight we couldn’t see which of the windows were still lit from within and which only on the outside. Nothing but the sharp sound of the gate latching broke the silence.","We reached the gate without exchanging a single word. In order to close it, we were obliged to look back. The front of the house, a single block of glittering ice, shone as though painted with bluish phosphorus, and this gleaming façade was so dazzling that it was impossible to tell which of the windows was lit from within and which from without, so brilliant was the light shed upon it by the exuberant moon. Not until the gate banged to was the silence broken; and as though encouraged by this earthly sound in the midst of the spectral silence, Condor turned to me with an ease of manner which I had not hoped for."
"»Nun … daß diese Verliebtheit einfach eine Kinderei, ein Unsinn ist. Sie müssen ihr das ausreden.«","“Well . . . that this infatuation is just childishness, nonsense. You have to talk her out of it.”",“Tell her what?” “Well … that this idea of being in love is just childish nonsense. You must talk her out of it.”,‘Tell her what?’ ‘Why ... that this infatuation is mere childish nonsense. You must talk her out of it.’
"Doch schon hält er inne, denn um ihren Mund hat ein Zucken begonnen, die schmalen Nasenflügel erzittern. Genau so hat es damals um die Lippen gebebt, und schon ängstige ich mich vor einem neuen Ausbruch. Aber plötzlich errötet sie und murmelt nachgiebig:","But he already stops because a twitching has started around her mouth, the narrow nostrils are trembling. That's exactly what trembled around my lips back then, and I'm already afraid of another outbreak. But suddenly she blushes and murmurs indulgently:","However, he stops, because the corners of her mouth have begun to twitch, and her delicate nostrils are quivering. Her lips had looked just the same at our fateful first encounter, and I fear another outburst. However, she suddenly blushes and murmurs with more docility, “It’s all right, there’s no point in it, but I’ll go.","He broke off, however, for her mouth had begun to work and her nostrils were quivering. It was in just this way that her lips had trembled on that fateful evening, and I began to dread a fresh outburst. But suddenly she blushed and murmured submissively:"
"Sie tappt näher heran, und wie schuldbewußt weiche ich zurück vor diesem zornig erregten Gesicht, in dem die aufgerissenen Augen plötzlich glänzen wie angeleuchtete weiße Kugeln.","She gropes closer and, feeling guilty, I retreat from that angry, excited face, in which the wide eyes suddenly shine like illuminated white spheres.","She gropes her way closer to me, and I guiltily retreat from her angry face, in which the whites of her wide-open eyes suddenly look very bright.","She groped her way nearer, and with a feeling of guilt I shrank back at the sight of the angry face, in which the wide-open eyes suddenly gleamed like glowing white marbles."
"»Ich wollte Ihnen nur sagen«, spricht sie – wie mir scheint, etwas befangen – in den Apparat, »es wäre besser, Sie kämen heute nicht heraus. Edith fühlt sich nicht ganz wohl …«","""I just wanted to tell you,"" she speaks into the phone, somewhat self-consciously, I think, ""it would be better if you didn't come out today. Edith doesn't feel quite well...""","“I just wanted to say,” she says down the phone (sounding rather awkward, it seems to me), “I just wanted to say it would be better if you didn’t come to see us today. Edith isn’t feeling very well …”","‘I only wanted to say,’ she said, speaking, it seemed to me, in a somewhat strained voice, ‘that it would be better if you didn’t come today. Edith doesn’t feel very well ...’"
"Da plötzlich wurde die Tür aufgerissen, der Oberst (von dem ich später mehr zu reden haben werde) rasselte herein, und da im wüsten Getöse nur ein paar ihn bemerkten oder erkannten, trat er schroff an den Tisch, hieb mit der Faust auf die beschmutzte Platte, daß Teller und Gläser klirrten. Dann kommandierte er mit seiner härtesten schneidendsten Stimme: »Ruhe!«","Suddenly the door was flung open, the colonel (of whom I will have more to say later) rattled in, and since only a few noticed or recognized him in the tumult, he stepped abruptly to the table and banged his fist on the soiled one Platter that plates and glasses rattled. Then he commanded in his harshest, cutting voice, ""Silence!""","Then, suddenly, the door was flung open, the Colonel strode in (I shall have more to say about our colonel later), and as only a few of us even noticed or recognised him in all the racket we were making, he marched up to the table and struck its dirty top with his fist, making the plates and glasses clink. Then, in his harshest, most cutting voice, he ordered, “Quiet!”","Suddenly the door was flung open, and the Colonel (of whom I shall have more to say later) came bustling in. Since in the frightful hullabaloo only a few of us either noticed or recognized him, he strode abruptly up to the table, and banged his fist down so violently that the plates and glasses clattered. Then he roared in his most acid, incisive tones, ‘Silence!’"
"Wie ein Genesener nahm ich Abschied. Daß ich in dieser Stunde einer andern Verstörten und Verstoßenen des Lebens mich neu und für immer versprochen hatte, dünkte mir mit einem Mal kein Opfer mehr. Nein, nicht die Gesunden, die Sicheren, die Stolzen, die Frohen, die Freudigen lieben – die brauchen es nicht! Die nehmen Liebe nur als gebotene Huldigung, als ihnen schuldige Pflicht hin, hochmütig und gleichgültig. Eine bloße Zutat, ein Schmuck im Haar, eine Spange an den Armen ist ihnen Hingabe eines andern, nicht ihres Lebens ganzer Sinn und Seligkeit. Einzig denen, die das Schicksal benachteiligt hat, einzig den Verstörten, den Zurückgesetzten, den Unsicheren, den Unschönen, den Gedemütigten kann man wahrhaft helfen durch Liebe. Wer ihnen sein Leben hingibt, entgilt, was das Leben ihnen genommen. Nur sie wissen zu lieben und geliebt zu werden, wie man lieben soll: dankbar und demütig.","I said goodbye like someone who had recovered. The fact that in this hour I had made a new and forever promise to someone else who had been disturbed and rejected in life suddenly no longer seemed to me a victim. No, not the healthy, the secure, the proud, the happy, the joyful love - they don't need it! They accept love only as a due homage, as a duty owed them, haughty and indifferent. A mere ingredient, a jewel in their hair, a clasp on their arms, is someone else's devotion, not the whole meaning and happiness of their lives. Only those who have been disadvantaged by fate, only the disturbed, the neglected, the insecure, the ugly, the humiliated can one truly help through love. Anyone who gives their life to them repays what life has taken from them. Only they know how to love and be loved as one should love: gratefully and humbly.","I said goodbye feeling like someone recovering from illness. Suddenly it no longer seemed to me any sacrifice to have promised myself again, and for ever, to another woman who had suffered and was an outcast from normal life. Why love the healthy, confident, proud and happy? They don’t need it. They take love as their rightful due, as the duty owed to them, they accept it indifferently and arrogantly. Other people’s devotion is just another gift to them, a clasp to wear in the hair, a bangle for the wrist, not the whole meaning and happiness of their lives. Love can truly help only those not favoured by fate, the distressed and disadvantaged, those who are less than confident and not beautiful, the meek-minded. When love is given to them it makes up for what life has taken away. They alone know how to love and be loved in the right way, humbly and with gratitude.","Like a man cured of an illness I took my leave. The fact that at this moment I had pledged myself anew and for ever to another helpless outcast no longer seemed to me to entail a sacrifice. No, it was not the healthy, the confident, the proud, the joyous, the happy that one must love — they had no need of one’s love! Arrogant and indifferent, they accepted love only as homage that was theirs to command, as their due. The devotion of another was to them a mere embellishment, an ornament for the hair, a bracelet on the arm, not the whole meaning and bliss of their lives. Only those with whom life had dealt hardly, the wretched, the slighted, the uncertain, the unlovely, the humiliated, could really be helped by love. He who devoted his life to them atoned to them for what life had taken from them. They alone knew how to love and be loved as one should love and be loved — gratefully and humbly."

"Kekesfalva und Ilona blickten einander verstört an. Beide verstanden sofort, daß eine lang aufgestaute Erregung mich völlig sinnlos ansprang; an der ängstlichen Art, wie sie sich mir zuwandten, ahnte ich ihre Besorgnis, ich würde grob dieser Grobheit erwidern. Eben darum nahm ich mich besonders zusammen.","Kekesfalva and Ilona looked at each other in confusion. Both understood at once that a long pent-up excitement was leaping at me in a completely senseless manner; from the anxious way in which they turned to me, I guessed their concern, I would rudely reply to this rudeness. That's why I pulled myself together.","Kekesfalva and Ilona looked at each other in dismay. They both realised at once that her pent-up feelings were attacking me for no good reason. From the anxious way they turned to me, I guessed that they feared I would reply in kind to this incivility, and for their sake I took pains to pull myself together.",Kekesfalva and Ilona looked at one another in distress. They both realized that I was quite unreasonably being made the victim of her long-pent-up feelings; and from their anxious glances at me I could see that they were afraid that I might return rudeness for rudeness. And for that very reason I made a special effort to control myself.
"Er starrte noch immer hin auf die imaginären Figuren, die seine zitternde Hand mit der Zuckerzange ins Leere zeichnete. Und plötzlich klirrte er sie wie erschreckt hin. Es war, als ob er aufwachte und dadurch erst bewußt würde, nicht zu sich allein, sondern vor einem völlig Fremden gesprochen zu haben. Mit einer ganz andern Stimme, einer wachen und gedrückten, begann er sich ungeschickt zu entschuldigen.","He was still staring at the imaginary figures that his trembling hand was drawing in emptiness with the sugar tongs. And suddenly he rattled them as if frightened. It was as if he were waking up and only then realizing that he had not spoken to himself but to a complete stranger.

It was as though he had started up and had only just realized that he had been speaking not to himself, but in the presence of an utter stranger. In a quite different voice, a waking, distressed voice, he began to stammer out an awkward apology."

No, everything else can wait until later. First I must report for duty. I gave the Colonel my word of honour.","When I awoke, it was daylight. A glance at my watch: half-past ten. My God, and I had been ordered by the Colonel to report immediately! Once again, before I had time to think of anything personal, the military part of my brain began to function automatically.

"Ich blickte diesen Menschen, den mir das Schicksal geschickt, wirklich ganz ergriffen an. Mit seiner wunderbaren Leichtigkeit hatte er mir das Schwerste abgenommen, das Bitten und Zögern und die quälende Spannung vor der Entschließung, so daß mir selbst nichts mehr zu tun übrig blieb als die einzige kleine Förmlichkeit: mein Abschiedsgesuch zu schreiben. Dann war ich frei und gerettet.","I looked at this person, whom fate had sent me, really moved. With his wonderful ease he had relieved me of the hardest part, the begging and hesitation and the agonizing tension of making up my mind, so that there was nothing left for me to do but the one small formality: to write my farewell letter. Then I was free and saved.","I looked at this man, sent to me by Fate, with strong emotion. With his wonderfully easy manner he had lightened the worst of my burden—asking for help, hesitating, the torment of making up my mind. And now there was nothing left for me to do but observe the one little formality of resigning my commission. Then I would be free and delivered from my troubles.","I felt deeply moved as I looked at this man whom Fate had sent to my aid. In his marvellously light-hearted, casual way he had taken the heaviest part of my burden off my shoulders, the asking of favours, the hesitation, and the torturing doubt and agony attendant on the taking of momentous decisions. All that was left for me to do was to carry out one small formality — to write out and hand in my resignation. After that I should be free, saved."

"Aber noch merkwürdiger: selbst wir Offiziere konnten uns einer gewissen Bindung an ihn nicht entziehen. Auch uns imponierte die dumpfe Ehrlichkeit in seiner Unerbittlichkeit und vor allem seine unbedingte kameradschaftliche Solidarität. Genau wie er keinen Tupf Staub auf einer Ulanka, keinen Kotspritzer auf dem Sattel beim letzten Soldaten ertrug, duldete er nicht die geringste Ungerechtigkeit; jeden Skandal im Regiment empfand er wie einen Hieb gegen die eigene Ehre. Wir gehörten zu ihm und wußten genau, daß, wenn einer etwas ausgefressen hatte, er am klügsten tat, geradewegs zu ihm zu gehen, worauf er einen zunächst angrobste, dann aber sich doch in die Stiefel steckte, um einen aus dem Schlamassel herauszupaddeln. Wenn es hieß, ein Avancement durchzusetzen oder einem, der in die Patsche geraten war, einen Vorschuß aus dem Albrechtsfonds herauszufechten, dann hielt er stramm, fuhr stracks ins Ministerium und stemmte mit seinem dicken Schädel die Sache durch. Gleichgültig, wie er uns ärgerte und trakassierte, wir spürten eben alle in einem versteckten Winkel unseres Herzens, daß dieser Bauernkerl aus dem Banat auf seine plumpe und bornierte Art treuer und ehrlicher als alle Nobeloffiziere den Sinn und die Tradition der Armee verteidigte, diesen unsichtbaren Glanz, von dem wir, die schlechtbezahlten Subalternoffiziere, innerlich mehr lebten als von unserer Gage.","But even stranger: even we officers could not escape a certain bond with him. We were also impressed by the dull honesty in his relentlessness and above all his unconditional comradely solidarity. Just as he would not endure a speck of dust on an ulanka, nor a speck of feces on the saddle of the last soldier, he would not tolerate the slightest injustice; he felt every scandal in the regiment as a blow to his own honor. We belonged to him and knew very well that when someone had screwed something up, the wisest thing he did was to go straight to him, whereupon he would scold you at first, but then put on his boots to paddle you out of the mess. When it came to getting an advancement or getting an advance out of the Albrechtsfonds from someone who had gotten into trouble, he stood to attention, drove straight to the ministry and stuck through the matter with his thick head. No matter how he teased and teased us, we all felt in a hidden corner of our hearts that this peasant fellow from the Banat in his clumsy and narrow-minded way more faithfully and honestly than all noble officers defended the meaning and tradition of the army, this invisible splendor , from which we, the badly paid subaltern officers, lived more internally than from our salary.","Yet more remarkable was the fact that even we officers could not help feeling a certain liking for him. We too were impressed by the dogged honesty of his implacable nature, and above all by his unconditional solidarity with us as his comrades. Just as he would not have a speck of dust on a lancer’s tunic or a splash of dirt on the saddle of the last man to pass by, he would not put up with injustice. He felt that any scandal in the regiment was a slur on his own honour. We were his protégés, and we knew very well that if anyone was in trouble his best course was to go straight to the Colonel, who would begin by bawling him out but then set to work to get him out of whatever mess he was in. When someone was waiting for promotion to come through, or if one of us was in financial difficulty and needed a loan from military funds to tide him over, the Colonel would go straight to the Ministry and put his mind to ensuring that everything went the way he wanted. However much he infuriated and tormented us, every one of us felt, in some remote corner of his heart, that in his own crude and bigoted way this rustic from the Banat showed more loyalty and honesty than any of the aristocratic officers in defending the spirit and tradition of the army, its invisible aura, which meant more to us impecunious junior officers than our pay.","But what was odder still, even we officers could not help feeling a certain affection for him. We too were impressed by his blunt, implacable honesty, and above all by his feeling of absolute solidarity with officers and men. Just as he would not tolerate a speck of dust on a tunic, a splash of mud on the saddle of a single horse, so he could not endure the slightest injustice; he felt that any breath of scandal in the regiment was a slur on his own honour. We belonged to him and knew perfectly well that if ever one of us got into a scrape the wisest thing to do was to go straight to him. At first he might abuse us roundly, but in the end he would do his utmost to get us out of it. When there was any question of obtaining promotion or of securing an advance from the special officers’ fund for any of us who was in a tight corner, he always took a firm line, went straight to the War Ministry, and forced the matter through with his bullet head. No matter how he might annoy and plague us, we all felt deep down in our hearts that this peasant from the Banat upheld more loyally and honestly than all the sprigs of the aristocracy the spirit and tradition of the army, that invisible glory on which we poorly-paid subalterns subsisted far more than on our pay."
"Ganz unbeherrscht hat sie die letzten Worte herausgestoßen, brennend die Augen, fahl das Gesicht. Dann löst sich mit einemmal der Krampf. Wie erschöpft fällt der Kopf an die Lehne, und erst allmählich füllt wieder Blut die von der Erregung noch zitternden Lippen.","She uttered the last words quite uncontrollably, her eyes burning, her face pale. Then suddenly the spasm goes away. As if exhausted, the head falls against the backrest, and blood only gradually fills the lips, which are still trembling from excitement.","As she utters these last words she sounds absolutely beside herself, her eyes burning, her face pale. Then her tension suddenly dies down. As if exhausted, she lets her head fall against the back of the chair, and gradually blood comes back into her lips, which are still quivering with emotion.","Quite beside herself, she had positively shouted the last few words at me, her eyes smouldering, her face livid. Then suddenly her fury subsided. Her head fell back as though exhausted on the chair, and only gradually did the colour return to her still quivering lips."
"Aber was hilft alles Sichzureden und Sichaufrichten, wenn einmal das innere Gleichgewicht ins Schwanken gekommen ist! Ich spüre: das Schmatzen und Staunen von Jozsi und Ferencz hat mir meine gute, meine leichte Unbefangenheit zerstört. Gehst du wirklich nur aus Mitleid, nur aus Mitgefühl zu diesen reichen Leuten, frage ich mich argwöhnisch? Steckt nicht auch ein gutes Stück Eitelkeit und Genießerei dahinter? Jedenfalls, da muß Klarheit geschaffen werden. Und als erste Maßnahme beschließe ich, von nun ab Pausen in meine Visiten einzuschalten und gleich morgen den üblichen Nachmittagsbesuch bei den Kekesfalvas zu unterlassen.","But what good is all the talking and straightening up once your inner balance has started to falter! I can feel: the smacking and astonishment of Jozsi and Ferencz has destroyed my good, easy impartiality. Are you really just going out of pity, just out of compassion for these rich people, I wonder suspiciously? Isn't there a good deal of vanity and indulgence behind it? In any case, there must be clarity. And as a first measure, I decide to include breaks in my rounds from now on and to refrain from the usual afternoon visit to the Kekesfalvas tomorrow.","But what use is all this persuading and encouraging myself now that I have been knocked off balance? I can tell that the lip-smacking astonishment of Jozsi and Ferencz has destroyed my peace of mind. Do you really go to see these rich people , I ask myself suspiciously, only out of sympathy, out of pity? Isn’t there a good deal of vanity and self-indulgence in it as well? I have to clear this up. And for a start I decide to visit less regularly from now on.","But of what use is any amount of self-persuasion and self-encouragement once one’s inner equilibrium has been shaken? I felt that Jozsi’s and Ferencz’s good-natured ragging had shattered my spontaneity. Do you really go there only out of pity, out of sympathy for these rich people? I kept asking myself. Are you not actuated to a certain extent by vanity, a desire for a good time? In any case, I must get the whole thing straight. No one shall say that I have forced myself on them."
"Ich mußte unwillkürlich eine Bewegung gemacht haben, denn er hieb gleich in die Kerbe.","I must have made an involuntary movement, because he immediately hit the notch.","I must have made an instinctive movement, for he immediately went on in the same vein.","I must involuntarily have recoiled, for he went on firmly:"
"Jetzt ist mir leichter. Ich eile zurück in die Kaserne, schütte meinen Kaffee hinunter und halte schlecht und recht meine Instruktionsstunde ab, wahrscheinlich nervöser, zerfahrener als sonst. Aber beim Militär fällt’s nicht sonderlich auf, wenn ein Leutnant morgens verkatert in den Dienst kommt. Wie viele fahren nach durchbummelter Nacht von Wien so ausgemüdet zurück, daß sie kaum die Augen aufhalten können und im schönsten Trab einschlafen. Eigentlich kommt’s mir sogar gut zupaß, die ganze Zeit kommandieren, examinieren und dann ausreifen zu müssen. Denn der Dienst lenkt die Unruhe doch einigermaßen ab, freilich, noch immer rumort zwischen den Schläfen das unbehagliche Erinnern, noch immer steckt mir etwas dick in der Kehle wie ein galliger Schwamm.","It's easier for me now. I hurry back to the barracks, down my coffee and do my briefing rudely, probably more nervous, more confused than usual. But in the military it doesn't attract much attention when a lieutenant comes into the morning with a hangover. How many drive back from Vienna after a night of strolling so exhausted that they can hardly keep their eyes open and fall asleep at their best trot. Actually, it even suits me well to have to command, examine and then mature all the time. Because the work distracts the restlessness to a certain extent, of course, uneasy memories still rumble between my temples, something is still thick in my throat like a bilious sponge.","Now I feel better. I hurry back to barracks, swallow some coffee, and get through my hour’s drill as best I can, probably more nervous and distracted than usual. But in the army it’s not particularly unusual for a lieutenant to come on duty with a hangover in the morning. Think how many come back from a night on the tiles in Vienna so exhausted that they can hardly prop their eyes open, and fall asleep on a trotting horse. In fact it suits me very well to be occupied in giving commands, inspecting the men, and then riding out. To a certain extent action takes my mind off my troubles, although my uncomfortable memories are still churning away inside my head, and there’s a lump in my throat like a sponge soaked in bitter gall.","Now I felt relieved. I hurried back to barracks, gulped down my coffee and got through the morning’s drill somehow, perhaps a little more absently and less calmly than usual. But in the army no one pays much attention if a lieutenant comes on duty in the morning with a bit of a hang-over. How many there are who come back, after a riotous night in Vienna, so tired out that they can scarcely keep their eyes open, and fall asleep while trotting briskly along! As a matter of fact, it suited my book very well just then to have my whole time taken up with shouting words of command, inspecting my men and then riding out. For my military duties to some extent kept at bay my uneasiness ; the disquieting memory was still, it was true, drumming behind my temples, and I still felt as though an acrid sponge were lodged in my throat."
"So setze ich mich, während nebenan der Spieltisch aufgeschlagen wird, zu den beiden Mädchen, und sonderbar – ist es der Wein oder die gute Laune, die mir alles verklärt? – sie scheinen mir heute beide besonders hübsch. Edith sieht nicht so blaß, so gelblich, so kränklich aus wie das letztemal – mag sein, daß sie den Gästen zu Ehren etwas Rot aufgelegt hat, oder es ist wirklich nur die animierte Stimmung, die ihr die Wangen färbt; jedenfalls, es fehlt die gespannte, nervös flattrige Falte um ihren Mund und das eigenwillige Zucken der Brauen. In einem langen rosa Kleid sitzt sie da, kein Pelz, keine Decke verbirgt ihr Gebrest, und doch denke ich, denken wir alle in unserer guten Laune nicht »daran«. Bei Ilona hege ich sogar den leisen Verdacht, daß sie sich einen leichten Schwips angetrunken hat, ihre Augen knallen nur so, und wenn sie lachend ihre schönen, vollen Schultern zurückwirft, muß ich wirklich abrücken, um der Versuchung zu widerstehen, ihre bloßen Arme durch halben Zufall anzustreifen!","So I sit down with the two girls while the gaming table is being set up next door, and strangely - is it the wine or the good mood that makes everything clear to me? – they both seem particularly pretty to me today. Edith doesn't look so pale, so yellowish, so sickly as last time - it may be that she put some red on the guests to honor them, or it's really just the animated mood that colors her cheeks; In any case, the tense, nervously fluttering folds around her mouth and the idiosyncratic twitching of her eyebrows are missing. She sits there in a long pink dress, no fur, no blanket hides her illness, and yet I think, in our good mood, none of us ""think about it."" I even suspect Ilona's gotten a little tipsy, her eyes pop and when she laughs and throws back her nice full shoulders I really have to move away to resist the temptation to stretch her bare arms touching on half coincidence!","So while the card table is set up in the room next door, I sit down with the two girls, and strange to say—is it the wine, or does my good mood transfigure everything before my eyes?—they both strike me as particularly pretty today. Edith doesn’t look as pale, sallow and sickly as last time I saw her—perhaps she has applied a little rouge, or is it really just her animation that brings the colour to her cheeks? Whatever the answer, the tense, nervous twitch of that line around her mouth is gone, and so is the arrogant lift of her eyebrows. She is wearing a long pink dress, with no fur or rug to hide her lame legs, and yet it seems to me that in our present cheerful mood none of us is thinking of ‘that’. In Ilona’s case, I even suspect, from the way her eyes are flashing, that she is slightly tipsy, and when she throws back her beautiful white shoulders, laughing, I have to move away if I am to resist the temptation of touching her bare arms as if by chance!","And so, while the card-table was being put out in the adjoining room, I sat down by the two girls, and oddly enough — was it the wine or my own good spirits that cast a glamour over everything? — they both of them seemed to me today to be looking uncommonly pretty. Edith did not look so pale, so sallow, so sickly as when I had last seen her. Had she put on some rouge in honour of her guests, or was it really the general animation that had brought a flush to her cheeks? At any rate, there was no sign of the drawn, tremulous line round her lips or the petulant twitching of her brows. There she sat in a long pink gown; no rug, no coverlet concealed her infirmity, and yet I and the rest of the company were in too good a mood to think of ‘it’. As for Ilona, I even had a faint suspicion that she was slightly tipsy, so brightly did her eyes twinkle, and when, with a smile, she threw back her lovely rounded shoulders, I positively had to draw back to withstand the temptation of touching her bare arms as though by accident."
"»Natürlich«, sagte ich unwillkürlich; es war das erste Wort, das ich an ihn richtete. All das schien mir so selbstverständlich und klar.","""Of course,"" I said involuntarily; it was the first word I addressed to him. All this seemed so natural and clear to me.","“Of course,” I instinctively said. It was the first remark that I had made directly to him, and indeed what he said seemed to me clear and sensible.","‘Of course,’ I said involuntarily. It was the first word I had addressed to him. It all seemed to me so obvious and plain."
"Als eine »Kleinigkeit« hatte ich Kekesfalva gegenüber jenen Wunsch bezeichnet, den mir noch unbekannten Arzt möglichst unbefangen über die Genesungsmöglichkeiten der Gelähmten auszukundschaften, und von außen her betrachtet war mir damit wirklich nur eine unbeträchtliche Bemühung auferlegt. Aber ich vermag schwer zu schildern, wieviel dieser unvermutete Auftrag mir persönlich bedeutete. Nichts erhöht ja in einem jungen Menschen dermaßen das Selbstbewußtsein, nichts fördert derart die Formung seines Charakters, als wenn er unerwartet sich vor eine Aufgabe gestellt sieht, die er ausschließlich aus eigener Initiative und eigener Kraft zu bewältigen hat. Selbstverständlich war mir schon früher Verantwortung zugefallen, aber immer war es eine dienstliche, eine militärische gewesen, immer bloß eine Leistung, die ich als Offizier auf Befehl meiner Vorgesetzten und im Rahmen eines eng umschriebenen Wirkungskreises durchzuführen hatte; etwa eine Schwadron zu kommandieren, einen Transport zu führen, Pferde einzukaufen, Streitigkeiten der Mannschaft zu schlichten. All diese Befehle und ihre Durchführung aber standen innerhalb der ärarischen Norm. Sie waren gebunden an geschriebene oder gedruckte Instruktionen, und im Zweifelsfall brauchte ich nur einen älteren und erfahreneren Kameraden um Rat anzugehen, um mich meines Mandats verläßlich zu entledigen. Die Bitte Kekesfalvas dagegen sprach nicht den Offizier in mir an, sondern jenes mir noch ungewisse innere Ich, dessen Fähigkeit und Leistungsgrenzen ich erst zu entdecken hatte. Und daß dieser fremde Mensch gerade mich in seiner Not unter allen seinen Freunden und Bekannten auswählte, dieses Vertrauen beglückte mich mehr als jedes bisher erhaltene dienstliche oder kameradschaftliche Lob.","I had described to Kekesfalva as a ""little thing"" my desire to find out as unbiased as possible about the chances of recovery of the paralyzed from the doctor, who was still unknown to me, and seen from the outside, it was really only an inconsiderable effort imposed on me. But it is difficult for me to describe how much this unexpected assignment meant to me personally. Nothing increases a young person's self-confidence so much, nothing promotes the formation of his character so much as when he is unexpectedly faced with a task that he has to master solely on his own initiative and with his own strength. Of course, I'd had responsibilities before, but it was always official, military, always just a job that I, as an officer, had to carry out on the orders of my superiors and within a narrowly defined sphere of activity; commanding a squadron, leading a transport, buying horses, settling disputes among the crew. But all these orders and their execution were within the norms of the era. They were tied to written or printed instructions, and when in doubt I only had to ask an older and more experienced comrade for advice in order to reliably discharge my mandate. Kekesfalva's request, on the other hand, did not appeal to the officer in me, but to that inner self, still uncertain to me, whose ability and performance limits I had yet to discover. And the fact that this stranger, in his distress, chose me from among all his friends and acquaintances made me happier than any official or comradely praise I had ever received.","I really had undertaken to make only a modest effort. But I can hardly describe how much this unexpected request meant to me personally. Nothing increases a young man’s self-assurance, nothing encourages the formation of his character so much as to find himself unexpectedly facing a task that he must perform entirely on his own initiative and by his own powers. Naturally I had already shouldered responsibility, but it had always been of a military nature, just something that I had to do as an officer on the orders of those who outranked me, and within a closely circumscribed sphere of influence, for instance commanding a squadron, taking charge of a transport of material, buying horses, settling quarrels between the men. All these orders, however, and the task of carrying them out were only what was usual. I had written or printed instructions, and if I was in any doubt I had only to ask an older and more experienced comrade for advice before doing exactly what I was expected to do. Kekesfalva’s request, on the other hand, was an appeal not to the soldier in me but to the essence of my character, of which I myself was still uncertain. I had not yet discovered my powers and their limitations. For Kekesfalva, a relative stranger, to appeal to me in his time of need, out of all his friends and acquaintances, was more gratifying than any praise I had yet received in my military career from any of my fellow soldiers.","A ‘trifle’, I had called Kekesfalva’s request that I should inquire as casually as possible of a doctor whom I had not yet met what were the prospects of the crippled girl’s recovery; and, looked at dispassionately , it really was a small thing he was asking me to do. But I can scarcely describe how much this unexpected commission meant to me personally. There is nothing that so raises a young man’s self-esteem, that so contributes to the formation of his character, as for him to find himself unexpectedly confronted with a task which he has to accomplish entirely on his own initiative and by his own efforts. Responsibility had often come my way before, of course, but it had always been connected with the carrying out of my military duties, with tasks that I had to perform as a junior officer on the orders of my superiors and within the framework of certain narrow and circumscribed limits: duties such as commanding a troop, taking charge of a transport, buying mounts, settling quarrels amongst my men. All these orders and the execution of them were a normal part of army life. I had merely to follow certain written or printed instructions, and when in doubt to apply to an older and more experienced officer, in order to carry them out satisfactorily. Kekesfalva’s request, on the other hand, was not addressed to the officer in me, but to that ‘inner’ me who was as yet only vaguely known to myself, whose capacities and limitations I had yet to discover. The fact that in his distress an almost complete stranger had selected me, me of all people, from among all his friends — this confidence in me gratified me more than all the praise I had hitherto received from superiors or friends."
"Diesmal aber schlief unser Freund nicht ein, denn noch drei andere Leute saßen im Abteil und erzählten von Geschäften. Und wenn Menschen von Geschäften erzählten, konnte Kanitz nicht weghören. Seine Lerngier hatte mit den Jahren ebensowenig nachgelassen wie seine Habgier; wie die zwei Beißer einer Zange waren sie mit eiserner Schraube verbunden.","But this time our friend didn't fall asleep because three other people were sitting in the compartment talking about business. And when people talked about business, Kanitz couldn't ignore them. His thirst for learning had not diminished over the years, nor had his greed; like the two jaws of a pair of pliers, they were connected with an iron screw.","“This time, however, our friend did not drop off to sleep, because there were three other men in the compartment, discussing the business they had been doing. And when people talked business, Kanitz couldn’t help pricking up his ears. His avid desire to learn had persisted through the years, like his wish to make money. They were bound together as if by an iron screw, like the two parts of a pair of pincers.","But on this occasion our friend did not fall asleep, for there were three other people besides himself in the compartment, and they were talking “shop”. And when people talked “shop”, Kanitz could never keep his ears shut. His thirst for knowledge had diminished as little with the years as his thirst for possessions; the two were no more to be sundered than are a pair of pincers."
"»Und nicht wahr, erledigt die Sache für heute. Meinen Eindruck habe ich Ihnen gesagt, alles Weitere wäre Faselei und Geflunker … Selbst wenn Edith faktisch in nächster Zeit noch etwas irritabler werden sollte, erschrecken Sie nicht gleich, ich werde schon draufkommen, welche Schraube da losgegangen ist. Sie haben nur eines zu tun: nicht immer so verstört, so ängstlich um die Kranke herumzuschleichen. Und dann zum zweiten: gründlich auf Ihre eigenen Nerven achtzuhaben. Sie sehen ziemlich übernächtig aus und ich fürchte, Sie bringen sich mit Ihrem Bohren und Wühlen mehr herunter, als Sie vor Ihrem Kind verantworten können. Am besten, Sie fangen gleich an, indem Sie sich heute abend früh zu Bett legen und ein paar Tropfen Baldrian vor dem Schlafengehen nehmen, damit Sie morgen wieder frisch sind. Das ist alles. Schluß der Ordination für heute! Ich rauch noch meine Zigarre fertig, dann trabe ich weiter.«","'And don't you, that's it for today. I told you my impression that everything else would be babble and fibs... Even if Edith should actually become a bit more irritable in the near future, don't be alarmed right away, I'll figure out what screw went off. You only have one thing to do: not always sneaking around the patient so distraught, so anxious. And then, secondly, to pay close attention to your own nerves. You look rather bleary-eyed and I'm afraid you're bringing yourself down more with your digging and digging than you can answer to your child. Best to start right away by going to bed early tonight and taking a few drops of valerian before bed so you can feel fresh tomorrow. That's all. Closing of the ordination for today! I'll finish my cigar and then I'll trot on.""","“And that’s enough for today, don’t you think? I have told you what I think, anything else would be nothing but nonsense and drivel … even if Edith proves more irritable than usual in the near future, don’t take alarm, I’ll soon find out what’s behind it. All you have to do is refrain from pestering her with your own distress and anxiety. Oh, and another thing—do take good care of your own nerves. You don’t look to me as if you are getting enough sleep, and I’m afraid that with all your fretting and worrying you’ll do harm to your own health. You can’t inflict that distress on your child. You’d better start by going to bed early this evening—take a few valerian drops before you fall asleep, and then you’ll feel well rested in the morning. There, that’s the end of my prescription for today! I’ll finish smoking my cigar, and then I’ll be off.”","‘Well, I think that’s all for today. I have given you my impressions, anything more would be sheer mumbo-jumbo and quackery. Even if Edith should actually get somewhat more irritable in the next few days, don’t be alarmed. I shall soon put my finger on what is wrong. There’s only one thing for you to do, and that’s to try not to hover round the invalid looking so worried and anxious. And then one more thing: you must take great care of your own nerves. You’re looking rather washed out, and I’m afraid that all this worrying and fussing is only sapping your own strength more than is fair to your daughter. The best thing you can do is to start by going to bed early tonight and taking a few Valerian drops before going to sleep, so that you will wake up fresh tomorrow. That’s all. That brings my visit to an end for today. I’ll just finish this cigar, then I’ll be off.’"
"»Sie müssen ihr helfen … nur Sie können ihr helfen, nur Sie … auch Condor sagt es: nur Sie und kein anderer! … ich flehe Sie an, erbarmen Sie sich … es geht nicht so weiter … sie tut sich sonst etwas an, sie richtet sich selbst zugrunde.«","»You have to help her… only you can help her, only you… even Condor says so: only you and no one else! ... I beg you, have mercy ... it cannot go on like this ... otherwise she will harm herself, she will destroy herself.""","As I moved quickly to help him, I failed to notice it at first, but he sank from the chair to his knees on purpose and now, as I try to raise him, he moves closer to me, takes my hands and begs me, “You must help her … you are the only one who can help her … Condor says so too, only you, no one else! I beg you to show mercy … it can’t go on like this … she’ll do herself harm, this will kill her!”","‘You must help her!’ he implored. ‘You are the only one who can help her ... even Condor says so — you and no one else ... I beseech you, have pity on her! Things can’t go on like this ... She’ll do something desperate, she’ll do away with herself!’"

"»Natürlich! Darauf hätt ich eigentlich gefaßt sein müssen. Damit endet’s immer. Heilbar oder unheilbar, schwarz oder weiß. Als ob das so einfach wäre! Schon ›gesund‹ und ›krank‹ sind zwei Worte, die ein anständiger Arzt guten Gewissens nicht aussprechen sollte, denn wo fängt die Krankheit an und wo endet die Gesundheit? Und gar ›heilbar‹ und ›unheilbar‹! Natürlich, sie sind sehr usuell, diese beiden Ausdrücke, und man kommt in der Praxis kaum ohne sie aus. Aber mich werden Sie nie dazu bekommen, das Wort ›unheilbar‹ auszusprechen. Mich nie! Ich weiß, der gescheiteste Mensch des letzten Jahrhunderts, Nietzsche, hat das furchtbare Wort hingeschrieben: Am Unheilbaren soll man nicht Arzt sein wollen. Aber das ist so ziemlich der falscheste Satz unter all den paradoxen und gefährlichen, die er uns zum Auflösen gegeben. Genau das Gegenteil ist richtig, und ich behaupte: gerade am Unheilbaren soll man Arzt sein wollen, und mehr noch: nur am sogenannt Unheilbaren bewährt sich ein Arzt. Ein Arzt, der von vorneweg den Begriff ›unheilbar‹ akzeptiert, desertiert vor seiner eigentlichen Aufgabe, er kapituliert vor der Schlacht. Selbstverständlich, ich weiß, einfacher, handlicher ist es schon, in gewissen Fällen einfach ›unheilbar‹ zu sagen und mit resigniertem Gesicht und eingeheimstem Konsultationshonorar sich wegzudrehen, – jaja, höchst bequem und einträglich, sich ausschließlich mit den erwiesenen, den erprobt heilbaren Fällen zu befassen, wo man in der Schwarte Seite soundsoviel die ganze Therapie fertig aufblättern kann. Na, wem’s Spaß macht, der mag so herumbadern. Mir ad personam scheint das als Leistung genau so kläglich, wie wenn ein Dichter nur das Schongesagte noch einmal sagen wollte, statt zu versuchen, das Ungesagte, ja, das Unsagbare ins Wort zu bändigen, wenn ein Philosoph das längst Erkannte zum neunundneunzigstenmal explizierte, statt dem Unerkannten, dem Unerkennbaren entgegenzudenken. Unheilbar – das ist doch nur ein relativer Begriff, kein absoluter; unheilbare Fälle gibt’s für die Medizin als einer fortschreitenden Erkenntnis doch nur im Momentanen, im Raum unserer Zeit, unserer Wissenschaft, also innerhalb unserer begrenzten, bornierten Froschperspektive! Aber auf unsern Augenblick kommt es doch nicht an. In hundert Fällen, wo wir heute keine Heilungsmöglichkeiten sehen, kann – unsere Wissenschaft rennt ja in rasendem Tempo vorwärts – morgen, übermorgen eine schon gefunden, schon erfunden sein. Es gibt also, merken Sie sich das gefälligst« – er sagte es ärgerlich, als hätte ich ihn beleidigt – »es gibt für mich keine unheilbaren Krankheiten, ich gebe prinzipiell nichts und niemanden auf, und niemand wird mir jemals das Wort ›unheilbar‹ abringen. Das Äußerste, was ich auch im verzweifeltsten Falle behaupten würde, wäre, daß ich eine Krankheit ›noch-nicht-heilbar‹ nenne – will sagen: von unserer zeitgemäßen Wissenschaft noch nicht heilbar.«","""Naturally! I really should have been prepared for that. It always ends with that. Curable or incurable, black or white. As if it were that easy! Even 'healthy' and 'sick' are two words that a decent doctor should not utter in good conscience, because where does the disease begin and where does health end? And even ›curable‹ and ›incurable‹! Of course, these two expressions are very common, and in practice one can hardly do without them. But you'll never get me to say the word 'incurable'. Me never! I know that the cleverest person of the last century, Nietzsche, wrote down the terrible saying: One should not want to be a doctor of the incurable. But that is pretty much the most wrong sentence among all the paradoxical and dangerous ones he has given us to resolve. Exactly the opposite is true, and I maintain that one should want to be a doctor precisely with the incurable, and even more: a doctor only proves his worth with the so-called incurable. A doctor who accepts the term 'incurable' from the outset deserts before his actual task, he capitulates before the battle. Of course, I know, it's easier, handier in certain cases to simply say ""incurable"" and turn away with a resigned face and pocketed the consultation fee - yes yes, extremely convenient and profitable to deal exclusively with the proven, curable cases deal with, where in the rind side one can leaf through the whole therapy. Well, if you enjoy it, you can swim around like that. To me ad personam, that seems just as pathetic as an achievement, as if a poet just wanted to say again what has already been said instead of trying to tame what has not been said, yes, the unspeakable, into words, if a philosopher explained what has long been known for the ninety-ninth time instead of to contemplate the unrecognized, the unknowable. Incurable - that's only a relative term, not an absolute one; Incurable cases for medicine as a progressive knowledge only exist at the moment, in the space of our time, our science, i.e. within our limited, narrow-minded frog perspective! But our moment is not important. In a hundred cases where we don't see any possibilities for a cure today - our science is advancing at breakneck speed - tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, one can already be found, already invented. So there are, remember that' - he said it angrily, as if I had insulted him - 'there are no incurable diseases for me, I give up nothing and nobody on principle, and nobody will ever wring the word 'incurable' from me . The most I would say, even in the most desperate case, would be to call an illness 'not yet curable' - that is to say: not yet curable by our contemporary science.«","I ought to have been prepared for this. That’s what it always comes down to. Curable or incurable, black or white. As if it were so simple! Even ‘healthy’ and ‘sick’ are two words that a good doctor can’t really use with a clear conscience, because where does sickness begin and where does health end? As for ‘curable’ and ‘incurable’ … well, of course those two expressions are extremely common, and medical practice can’t do without them. But you will never get me to say that something is incurable. Never! I know that the cleverest man of the last century, Nietzsche, came up with the terrible maxim that a doctor should never attempt to treat the incurable, but that is probably the most misleading of all the paradoxical and dangerous precepts that he left us to unravel. Precisely the opposite is true—the incurable, above all, are the patients whom a doctor ought to treat. What’s more, it’s in his treatment of the incurable that a doctor shows what he is really worth. It’s a dereliction of duty for him to accept the term ‘incurable’ from the start. He’s surrendering before the battle has even begun. Of course I know that it is simpler, a useful shorthand, to say that certain cases are downright ‘incurable’, turning away with an expression of resignation after pocketing your fee for the consultation— yes, it’s very comfortable and lucrative to concentrate entirely on the cases that are known to be curable, where you can look up the therapy on page such-and-such of a medical manual. I’ll leave that to the quacks who enjoy it. Personally, I consider it as pitiful an achievement as for a poet just to want to repeat what’s been well said already, instead of trying to find words for what is still unsaid, or indeed is beyond normal verbal expression. Or for a philosopher to explain, for the ninety-ninth time, some recognised truth known for years, rather than looking for ways to express what isn’t known or is unknowable. ‘Incurable’ is only a relative term, not absolute; incurable cases in medicine, a field where progress is always being made, occur only in the present moment, in the context of our own time, of what we know so far—I mean within our limited, opinionated worm’s-eye view. But our own view is not all that matters. In a hundred cases where we see no possibility of a cure today—even though our knowledge is making huge strides—one may be discovered tomorrow or the next day, discovered or devised. So kindly take note”—he said this angrily, as if I had offended him—“as I see it, there are no incurable illnesses. On principle I will never give up hope for a patient, and no one will ever get me to say a case is incurable. The most I would ever say, even in the most desperate cases, is that an illness cannot yet be cured—cannot be cured, I mean, by medicine in its present state.” Condor was striding along so vigorously that I had difficulty in keeping up with him.","‘Why, of course,’ he muttered, ‘I might have expected that! It always comes to that in the end. Curable or incurable, black or white. As though it were as simple as all that. Even “well” or “ill” are words that no self-respecting doctor should utter with a clear conscience, for where does illness begin and health end? And he should certainly avoid such expressions as “curable” and “incurable”! Of course they are very common, both of them, and one can’t get along in practice without them. But you’ll never get me to utter the word “incurable”. Never! I know that it is to the most brilliant man of the last century, Nietzsche, that we owe the horrible aphorism: a doctor should never try to cure the incurable. But that is about the most fallacious proposition of all the paradoxical and dangerous propositions he propounded. The exact opposite is the truth. I maintain that it is precisely the incurable one should try to cure, and, what is more, that it is only in so-called incurable cases that a doctor shows his mettle. A doctor who from the outset accepts the concept “incurable” is funking his job, capitulating before the battle begins. Of course I know that it is easier, more convenient, to pronounce certain cases “incurable” and, after pocketing one’s fee, to turn one’s back on them with a sigh of resignation — indeed, extremely convenient and profitable to concern oneself exclusively with those cases that have been shown to be curable, in which one can turn up page so-and-so of the medical text-book and find the whole treatment set out for one in black and white. Ah well, those that care to can go in for that kind of witch-doctoring. As for me, it seems to me as pitiable a thing as if a writer were only to attempt to say what had already been said, instead of trying to force into the medium of the spoken word the unsaid, nay, the unsayable; as though a philosopher were to expatiate for the ninety-ninth time on what has long been known instead of tackling the unknown, the unknowable. Incurable — that is, after all, only a relative, not an absolute, concept. For a progressive science such as medicine incurable cases are only so for the time being, within the time-limits of our own age, within the compass of our present knowledge, that is to say, within the limits of our restricted perspective. But it’s not a question merely of the moment. In hundreds of cases where today we know of no cure, tomorrow, the day after, a cure may be found, for medical science is, after all, making tremendous strides. So for me, you see, I would have you note’ — he said this irritably, as though I had offended him — ‘there are no incurable illnesses. On principle, I never give a case or a patient up, and no one will ever wring from me the word “incurable”. The utmost that I would say in the most desperate case would be that an illness was “not yet curable”, that is to say, that contemporary science had not yet found a cure for it.’"
"Ich trete also nochmals in den Laden, nehme eine Visitenkarte und schreibe darauf: »Mit der Bitte um Entschuldigung.« Nein – unmöglich! Das wäre schon der vierte Unsinn: wozu noch an meine Tölpelei erinnern? Aber was sonst schreiben? »In aufrichtigem Bedauern« – nein, das geht schon gar nicht, am Ende könnte sie meinen, das Bedauern gelte ihr. Am besten also gar nichts dazuschreiben, überhaupt nichts.","So I go back into the shop, take a business card and write on it: »With my apologies.« No – impossible! That would be the fourth piece of nonsense: what's the point of reminding me of my stupidity? But what else to write? ""With sincere regrets"" - no, that's definitely not possible, in the end she might think that the regrets are for her. So it's best not to write anything at all, nothing at all.","So I go back into the shop again, take out a visiting card and write on it, “A plea for forgiveness.” No—impossible! That would be a fourth mistake—why remind anyone of my folly? But what else can I put? “With genuine regret”—no, that won’t do either. She might think I was sorry for her. Better not to write anything at all.","So once more I entered the shop. Taking a visiting-card, I wrote on it: ‘With apologies.’ No — that was impossible. That in itself would be a fourth piece of folly. Why should I remind her of my blunder?

"Der Chauffeur hält wunschgemäß am Rathausplatz, zwei Straßen von der Kaserne. Ich steige aus, schlage den Kragen hoch und will rasch den weiten Platz überqueren. Aber gerade in diesem Augenblick strubelt das Unwetter mit verdoppelter Wucht los, mit nassem Hieb schlägt der Wind mir gradaus ins Gesicht. Besser darum unter einem Haustor ein paar Minuten warten, ehe man die zwei Gassen zur Kaserne hinüberläuft. Oder am Ende ist das Kaffeehaus noch offen und ich kann dort im Sicheren sitzen, bis der liebe Himmel seine dicksten Gießkannen verschüttet hat. Zum Kaffeehaus hinüber sind es nur sechs Häuser, und siehe da, hinter den schwimmenden Scheiben glänzt schummrig das Gaslicht. Am Ende hocken die Kameraden noch am Stammtisch; famose Gelegenheit das, allerhand gutzumachen, denn es gehört sich längst, daß ich mich wieder einmal zeige. Gestern, vorgestern, die ganz Woche und die letzte bin ich vom Stammtisch weggeblieben. Eigentlich hätten sie guten Grund, gegen mich verärgert zu sein; wenn man schon untreu wird, soll man wenigstens die Formen wahren.","As requested, the chauffeur stops at Rathausplatz, two streets from the barracks. I get out, turn up my collar and want to quickly cross the wide square. But just at that moment the storm swept up with doubled force, the wind hitting me straight in the face with a wet blow. So it's better to wait a few minutes under a house gate before walking down the two streets to the barracks. Or in the end the coffee house is still open and I can sit there in safety until the good heavens have spilled their biggest watering cans. There are only six houses across from the coffee house, and lo and behold, the gaslight gleams dimly behind the floating panes. In the end, the comrades are still sitting at the regulars' table; It's a splendid opportunity to make up for all sorts of things, because it's been a good thing for me to show myself again for a long time. Yesterday, the day before yesterday, the whole week and the last I stayed away from the regulars' table. In fact, they would have good reason to be angry with me; if one is going to be unfaithful, one should at least keep up the forms.","At my request, the chauffeur stops in the town-hall square, two streets away from the barracks. I get out, turn up my coat collar and am about to cross the wide square. But just at that moment the storm breaks again with redoubled fury, and the wind blows rain straight into my face. Better to wait in the entrance to a building for a few minutes before walking back to the barracks. Or perhaps the café is still open, and I can sit in shelter there until the heavens have finished pouring the contents of their largest watering can over us. The café is only six buildings away, and I’m glad to see the gaslight glowing faintly behind the streaming wet windowpanes. My comrades may still be at their regular table in there , a good opportunity to make up for various omissions. It’s high time I kept them company again. Yesterday, the day before, all week and all last week too, I’ve been away from our regular table. They’d be justified in feeling annoyed with me; if you’re going to be unfaithful you should at least observe the proprieties.","The chauffeur drew up obediently in the Rathausplatz, two streets away from the barracks. I got out, turned up my collar and was about to walk rapidly across the wide square. But just at that moment the storm burst forth with redoubled fury, and the wind rained wet blows full in my face. Better, therefore, to wait a few minutes in the shelter of a house-door before running across the two streets to the barracks. Or, to be sure, the café was still open and I could sit there in safety until the heavens had emptied the contents of their largest watering-can. The café was only six doors away, and lo and behold, behind the dripping window-panes there was still a glimmer of gas-light! Perhaps some of my comrades were still squatting round our table; it would be a splendid opportunity to set things right, for it was high time I put in an appearance again. Yesterday, the day before yesterday, the whole of this week and last week I had absented myself. Really, they had every reason to be fed up with me, for even if one is fickle, one should at least observe the formalities."
"»Ich kann ja bloß von mir aus urteilen, und zu mir hat sich Herr von Kekesfalva bei jeder Gelegenheit von der vornehmsten und gütigsten Seite gezeigt … man hatte uns beim Regiment die ungarische Gentry immer als besonders hochfahrend geschildert … Aber … ich … ich bin nie einem gütigeren Menschen begegnet … ich … ich …«","“I can only judge for myself, and Herr von Kekesfalva has shown himself to me on every occasion from the noblest and kindest side ... the Hungarian gentry had always been described to us in the regiment as particularly haughty ... But ... I ... I am never met someone kinder... I... I...""","I just had a sense of having said something foolish, and I replied, in embarrassment, “Well, I can’t judge that kind of thing for myself, but Herr von Kekesfalva has always shown his kindest, most distinguished side to me … and in the regiment we’ve always had the Hungarian gentry described to us as particularly arrogant. But … I … I never met a kindlier man … I … I …”","‘I can only judge from my own personal experience, and to me Herr von Kekesfalva has at all times shown himself to be most well-bred and gracious ... we’ve always heard Hungarian landowners referred to in the regiment as particularly overbearing ... But ... I ... I never met a more gracious person ... I ... I ...’"
"Wohltat darum die Reveille, Wohltat der Dienst, diese bessere, diese mildere Gefangenschaft! Wohltat, sich auf sein Pferd zu schwingen und vorwärts im Trab mit den andern, ununterbrochen achtsam sein zu müssen und angespannt! Man hat zu gehorchen, man hat zu befehlen! Drei Exerzierstunden, vier Stunden vielleicht entrinnt, entreitet man sich selbst.","So reveille is a blessing, service is a blessing, this better, this milder captivity! A blessing to jump on your horse and trot forward with the others, having to be alert and tense all the time! One has to obey, one has to command! Three hours of drill, maybe four hours escapes, one eludes oneself.","So reveille comes as a relief, and my military duties—a kinder and better form of captivity—do me good. It is good to mount my horse and trot on with the others, to have to pay attention and concentrate the whole time. I have to obey and I have to command. For the hours of military exercises, perhaps four hours in all, I can escape, I can ride away from myself.","What a solace then is reveille, what a solace your duties, that far milder form of bondage! What a comfort to vault into the saddle and to have to trot along with all the others, to have to be unceasingly on the qui vive! You have to obey, you have to give orders. For three hours, perhaps four, you escape, ride away from yourself."
"»Aber solang du willst. Bis die Kraxen da repariert ist, dauert’s ohnehin noch eine halbe Stund. Nur sehr bequem wirst du’s oben bei mir nicht finden. Der Wirt will mir immer das noble Zimmer im ersten Stock geben, aber aus einer g’wissen Sentimentalität nehm ich immer das alte von damals. Ich hab da einmal … na, reden wir nicht davon.«","'But as long as you want. It will still take half an hour for the Kraxen to be repaired anyway. You won't find it very comfortable upstairs with me. The landlord always wants to give me the noble room on the first floor, but out of a certain sentimentality I always take the old one from back then. I once… well, let's not talk about it.”","“Take as long as you like. It’s going to be another half-an-hour before they get that clatterbox on the road again. Only you won’t think my room very comfortable. The landlord always wants to give me a grand first-floor room, but call it sentimental if you like, I prefer to stay where I once did in the old days. And when I was there … but never mind that.”","‘As long as you like, old chap. It’ll take half an hour in any case for the old bus to be repaired. But it’s not very comfortable up there.

"Er stand auf, überwältigt von seiner Erregung, und trat mit drei hastig-heftigen Schritten ans Fenster. Ich kannte das nun schon an ihm. Immer wenn ihm die Tränen in die Augen stiegen, rettete er sich in dieses brüske Wegwenden. Auch er wollte kein Mitleid – weil er ihr doch ähnlich war! Ungeschickt tastete zugleich seine rechte Hand in die rückwärtige Rocktasche des tristen schwarzen Jacketts, knüllte ein Tuch heraus; und vergeblich, daß er dann so tat, als hätte er sich nur den Schweiß von der Stirne gewischt: ich sah zu deutlich die geröteten Lider. Einmal, zweimal ging er im Zimmer auf und nieder; es stöhnte und stöhnte, ich wußte nicht, waren es die abgemorschten Balken unter seinem Schritt oder war er es selbst, der morsche, alte Mann. Dann holte er wie ein Schwimmer vor dem Abstoß wieder Atem.","He got up, overwhelmed by his excitement, and took three hasty strides to the window. I already knew that about him. Whenever tears welled up in his eyes, he saved himself by turning away brusquely. He didn't want pity either - because he was like her! At the same time, his right hand clumsily groped into the back pocket of his drab black jacket and crumpled out a handkerchief; and in vain that he then acted as if he had only wiped the sweat from his forehead: I saw the reddened eyelids too clearly. Once, twice he paced up and down the room; It moaned and moaned, I didn't know whether it was the rotted beam under his crotch or it was he himself, the rotten old man. Then, like a swimmer before the push-off, he caught his breath again.","He stood up, overwhelmed by his emotion, and took three firm and rapid steps over to the window. I knew him by now; whenever tears rose to his eyes, he resorted to that brusque turning away. He didn’t want pity either—he was very like her! At the same time, his right hand was feeling clumsily in the back pocket of his sombre black coat, crumpling up a handkerchief as he brought it out, and then pretending that he only wanted to mop the sweat from his brow with it. But in vain; I saw his reddened eyelids only too clearly. He paced up and down the room once, twice; the crumbling floorboards groaned under his tread, or was it he who was groaning, an old man also in decline? Then he took a deep breath, like a swimmer about to push off.","Overcome by his agitation, he rose and took three vigorous, rapid paces to the window. I had seen him like this before. Always when the tears rushed to his eyes he would turn away abruptly like this. He too refused to be pitied — how like her he was! His right hand fumbled clumsily in the back pocket of his pitiful old black coat and drew out a handkerchief, but it was in vain that he pretended he had only been wiping the sweat from his brow, for I could see only too clearly the reddened lids. Once, twice, he paced up and down the room; I could not tell whether the groans I heard issued from the rotting floor-boards or from the decrepit old man himself. Then, like a swimmer about to plunge, he took a deep breath."
"»Gott gebe es!« Der Vater war aufgestanden, er konnte nicht an sich halten. Die Tränen feuchteten ihm die Brille, er nahm sie ab und putzte umständlich daran herum. Ich spürte, daß seine Hände sich kaum zähmen konnten, mich zu berühren, und ich weigerte mich nicht. Auch ich fühlte das Bedürfnis, ihm dankbar zu sein, ich trat an ihn heran und umarmte ihn, daß sein Bart meine Wange streifte. Als er sich von mir löste, merkte ich, daß Edith auf mich blickte. Ihre Lippen bebten leicht; ich ahnte, wie sehr die halb aufgetanen Lippen sich nach gleich inniger Berührung sehnten. So beugte ich mich rasch zu ihr nieder und küßte ihren Mund.","""God grant it!"" Father had stood up, he couldn't contain himself. The tears wet his glasses, he took them off and cleaned them laboriously. I felt that his hands could hardly bring themselves to touch me, and I did not refuse. I too felt the need to be grateful to him, I approached him and hugged him so that his beard brushed my cheek. When he broke away from me, I noticed that Edith was looking at me. Her lips quivered slightly; I guessed how much the half-open lips longed for the same intimate touch. So I quickly bent down to her and kissed her mouth.","“May God grant it!” Her father had risen. He could not control his tears; they moistened his glasses, and he took them off to clean them with much ceremony. I felt that his hands could hardly help moving to touch me, and I did not object. I too felt a need to show him gratitude. I went up to him and embraced him, and his beard brushed my face. When I moved away from him I saw that Edith was looking at me. Her lips were trembling slightly, and I guessed how much she longed for the same ardent touch. So I leant quickly down to her and kissed her on the mouth.","‘God grant it!’ Her father had risen, unable to contain himself. His spectacles were misty with tears; he took them off and polished them slowly and deliberately. I could tell that he could scarcely keep his hands off me, and I for my part was ready to respond. I too felt impelled to show some sign of my gratitude, and I went up to him and embraced him. As he returned to his seat, I could feel Edith’s eyes upon me. Her lips trembled slightly; I realized how much her parted lips were yearning for the same fond touch. I quickly bent over her and kissed her on the mouth."
"Jedoch etwas Erschreckendes muß in meinem brüsken Gehaben gewesen sein, denn Ilona faßte mich resolut am Arm und drückte, ja stieß mich in einen Fauteuil.","However, there must have been something frightening about my brusque demeanor, because Ilona resolutely grabbed my arm and pushed, even pushed me into an armchair.","But there must have been something alarming in my brusque manner, because Ilona firmly took my arm and guided me—no, pushed me, into an armchair.","There must, however, have been something alarming in my brusque behaviour, for she seized me resolutely and forced, nay, pushed me, into an armchair."
"Aber meine Verzweiflung hatte mich rücksichtslos gemacht. »Nein, nein, nein«, hämmerte ich heftig mit der Hand auf die Lehne. »Nein, ich kann nicht … ich will nicht geliebt sein, nicht so geliebt … Und ich kann auch jetzt nicht weiter so machen, als merkte ich nichts, ich kann nicht mehr unbefangen sitzen und Süßholz raspeln … ich kann nicht! Sie wissen ja nicht, was vorgefallen ist … dort, dort drüben und … sie mißversteht mich ganz. Ich habe doch nur Mitleid mit ihr gehabt. Nur Mitleid, sonst nichts und sonst gar nichts!«","But my desperation had made me ruthless. ""No, no, no,"" I pounded my hand hard on the seat back. ""No, I can't... I don't want to be loved, not loved that much... And even now I can't go on acting as if I didn't notice anything, I can't sit at ease and grate sweets any longer... I can't! You don't know what happened... over there, over there and... she completely misunderstands me. I just felt sorry for her. Only pity, nothing else and nothing else at all!«","But my desperation had made me ruthless. “No, no, no!” I insisted, bringing my hand down on the arm of the chair. “No, I can’t … I won’t have her loving me, not like that … And I can’t go on acting now as if I didn’t notice anything, I can’t sit here at my ease saying sweet nothings … I can’t! You don’t know what happened … what happened in there, and … oh, she misunderstands me entirely. I only felt sorry for her. It was only pity, that’s all, no more.”","But desperation had made me ruthless. ‘ No, no, no!’ I said, hammering violently on the arm of the chair. ‘ No, I can’t ... I won’t be loved, loved like this. And I can’t go on behaving as though I had noticed nothing, I can’t go on sitting about unconcernedly and playing the cavalier. I can’t! You don’t know what happened there in her room ... she’s under a complete misapprehension about me. I really only felt pity for her. Only pity, nothing else, nothing else whatever.’"
"Es ist der weißhaarige Diener mit den schöngeschnittenen Franz Joseph-Koteletten, der die Tür vorsichtig öffnet; hinter ihm schiebt Ilona einen reichgedeckten Teetisch auf Gummirädern herein. Sie serviert, setzt sich zu uns, und sofort fühle ich mich wieder sicherer. Den willkommenen Anlaß zur Konversation gibt die mächtige Angorakatze, die unhörbar mit dem Teewagen hereingeschlichen ist und sich nun mit unbefangener Vertraulichkeit an meinen Beinen reibt. Ich bewundere die Katze, dann beginnt ein Hin-und Herfragen, wie lange ich hier sei und wie ich mich in der Garnison fühle, ob ich den Leutnant Soundso kenne, ob ich oft nach Wien fahre – unwillkürlich entsteht ein landläufiges, unbeschwertes Gespräch, in dem sich die arge Spannung unmerklich löst. Allmählich traue ich mich sogar schon, die beiden Mädchen ein bißchen von der Seite anzusehen, völlig verschieden ist die eine von der andern, Ilona schon ganz Frau, sinnlich warm, voll, üppig, gesund; neben ihr wirkt Edith, halb Kind und halb Mädchen, vielleicht siebzehn Jahre alt, vielleicht achtzehn, noch irgendwie unfertig. Sonderbarer Kontrast: mit der einen möchte man tanzen, möchte man sich küssen, die andere wie eine Kranke verwöhnen, sie schonend streicheln, sie behüten und vor allem beschwichtigen. Denn eine merkwürdige Unruhe geht von ihrem Wesen aus. Nicht einen Augenblick hält ihr Gesicht still; bald blickt sie nach rechts, bald nach links, bald spannt sie sich auf, bald lehnt sie sich wie erschöpft zurück; und mit der gleichen Nervosität, wie sie sich bewegt, spricht sie auch, immer sprunghaft, immer staccato, immer ohne Pausen. Vielleicht, denke ich mir, daß diese Unbeherrschtheit und Unruhe eine Kompensation ist für die aufgezwungene Unbeweglichkeit ihrer Beine, vielleicht auch ein ständiges leichtes Fieber, das ihre Gesten und ihr Gespräch rascher taktiert. Aber mir bleibt wenig Zeit zum Beobachten. Denn sie versteht mit ihren raschen Fragen und der leichten, fliegenden Art ihres Erzählens die Aufmerksamkeit völlig auf sich zu ziehen; überrascht gerate ich in ein anregendes und interessantes Gespräch.","It is the white-haired servant with the beautifully trimmed Franz Joseph sideburns who carefully opens the door; behind him Ilona pushes in a richly set tea table on rubber wheels. She serves, sits down with us, and immediately I feel safer again. The mighty Angora cat, which has crept in with the tea trolley inaudibly and is now rubbing itself against my legs with uninhibited familiarity, gives a welcome start to the conversation. I admire the cat, then I start asking back and forth how long I've been here and how I feel in the garrison, whether I know Lieutenant So-and-so, whether I often go to Vienna - an involuntary, casual conversation ensues, in where the intense tension is imperceptibly relieved. Gradually I even dare to look at the two girls from the side, one is completely different from the other, Ilona already quite a woman, sensually warm, full, voluptuous, healthy; next to her Edith, half child and half girl, maybe seventeen years old, maybe eighteen, still somehow unfinished. Strange contrast: you want to dance with one, you want to kiss, spoil the other like a sick person, caress her gently, protect her and, above all, soothe her. Because a strange restlessness emanates from her nature. Her face does not stay still for a moment; now she looks to the right, now to the left, now she tenses up, now she leans back as if exhausted; and she speaks with the same nervousness as she moves, always erratic, always staccato, always without pauses. Perhaps, I think to myself, that this lack of self-control and restlessness is a compensation for the forced immobility of her legs, perhaps also a constant slight fever that makes her gestures and her conversation faster. But I have little time to observe. Because she knows how to draw attention to herself with her quick questions and the light, flying way of her storytelling; Surprised, I stumbled into a stimulating and interesting conversation.","It is the white-haired manservant with the neatly trimmed side whiskers, reminiscent of Emperor Franz Josef’s, who carefully opens the door. Behind him comes Ilona, pushing in a lavishly laden tea trolley on rubber wheels. She pours tea and coffee, sits down with us, and I immediately feel safer. The enormous angora cat who has slipped soundlessly into the room with the tea trolley, and begins rubbing around my legs with friendly familiarity, provides a welcome subject for comment. I admire the cat, an exchange of questions and answers begins—how long have I been here, how do I like the garrison , do I know Lieutenant So-and-So , do I often go to Vienna? Soon we have fallen easily into light conversation. After a while I even venture to cast a few sidelong glances at the two girls, so very different from each other. Ilona is already a grown woman, sensuously warm, full-breasted, opulent, healthy; beside her Edith, half child and half young girl, maybe seventeen years old, maybe eighteen, seems somehow immature. A strange contrast—a man would want to dance with Ilona and kiss her, but to spoil Edith as an invalid, caress her with care, protect and above all soothe her, for she seems very restless. Her face is never for a moment still; now she looks right, now left, sometimes her attitude is tense, then she leans back again exhausted, and she speaks as nervously as she moves, always disjointedly, always staccato, never stopping to pause. Perhaps, I think, this restlessness and lack of self-control is a way of compensating for the forced immobility of her legs, or perhaps a constant slight fever speeds up her gestures and her speech. But I do not have much time to observe her, for she is good at drawing attention to herself with her rapid questions and the light volatility of her remarks. To my surprise, I become involved in a stimulating and interesting conversation.","It was the white-haired man-servant with the beautifully trimmed mutton-chop whiskers who was discreetly opening the door; behind him Ilona was wheeling in a rubber-tyred tea-trolley piled with good things. She poured out, then came and sat down by us; I immediately felt my self-assurance return. A welcome subject of conversation was provided by the huge Angora cat, who had crept in noiselessly with the tea-trolley and was rubbing himself with unconstrained familiarity against my legs. After I had admired the cat, I was subjected to a cross-fire of questions: how long had I been here, how did I like the new garrison, did I know Lieutenant So-and-so, did I often go to Vienna? And involuntarily I found myself taking part in a natural, easy conversation, in the course of which the painful tension imperceptibly vanished. Gradually I even ventured to take occasional sidelong looks at the two girls. The one was completely different from the other: Ilona, already a woman, full-blooded, well-developed, voluptuous, healthy; beside her, Edith, half child, half young woman, about seventeen or eighteen, still appeared somehow immature. Curious contrast: one would have liked to dance with the one, to kiss her; the other one wanted to spoil as an invalid, to pet and make a fuss of, to protect and, above all, to soothe. For a strange restlessness emanated from her. Not for one moment were her features in repose; now she looked to the left, now to the right, now she leaned back as though exhausted; and she spoke as nervily as she moved in jerky, staccato tones, without pausing for breath. Perhaps, I thought to myself, this lack of restraint, this restlessness, is a compensation for the enforced immobility of her legs; perhaps, too, the result of a perpetual state of semi-fever, which quickens the tempo of her gestures and her speech. But I had little time for observation. For with her blunt questions and her light, volatile manner of talking she had a way of focusing attention completely on herself; and to my surprise I found myself taking part in a really enlivening and interesting conversation."

Rechts und links höre ich verhangene Worte um mich, ohne sie zu verstehen; es ist, als sprächen alle eine fremde Sprache. Ich sehe vor mir, neben mir Gesichter, Schnurrbärte, Augen, Nasen, Lippen, Uniformen, aber mit jener Stumpfheit, mit der man durch eine Glasscheibe Dinge einer Auslage wahrnimmt. Ich bin da und doch nicht dabei, starr und doch beschäftigt, denn ich murmle noch immer mit lautlosen Lippen die einzelnen Worte des Briefes nach, und manchmal, wenn ich nicht weiter weiß oder mich verwirre, zuckt mir die Hand, um heimlich in die Tasche zu greifen, wie man in der Kadettenschule während der Taktikstunde verbotene Bücher hervorholte.","The waiter served me in vain. I leave everything untouched, this inward listening paralyzes me like a kind of sleep with my eyes open. Right and left I hear veiled words around me without understanding them; it's like everyone is speaking a foreign language. In front of me, next to me, I see faces, mustaches, eyes, noses, lips, uniforms, but with that dullness with which one perceives things on display through a pane of glass. I'm there and yet not there, rigid and yet busy, because I'm still murmuring the individual words of the letter with silent lips, and sometimes, when I don't know what to do or am confused, my hand twitches to secretly put it in my pocket to grasp, as one took out forbidden books during tactics lesson in the cadet school.","The waiter serves me, but I leave the food untouched. I am deep in thought, dazed, it’s like being asleep with my eyes open. I vaguely hear words around me, to right and left, without understanding them. My comrades might as well be speaking a foreign language.

I am here yet not here, fixed where I sit yet with my mind elsewhere. Soundlessly, I am murmuring phrases from the letter in my mind, and sometimes, when I can’t remember how it goes on, or I get confused, my hand itches to reach for my breast pocket, just as we surreptitiously used to read forbidden books during tactics lessons at military academy.","In vain the waiter placed food before me; I left everything untouched. This listening to my inner self paralysed me. It was as though I was asleep with my eyes wide open. To right and left of me I heard people talking as through a fog, without understanding a word of what they were saying; they might have been speaking a foreign language. Before me, beside me, I saw faces, moustaches, eyes, noses, lips, uniforms, but saw them dimly as one sees things through the plate-glass of a shop-window. I was there and yet not there, immobile and yet occupied, for I kept murmuring with soundless lips the individual phrases of the letter, and sometimes, when I could not remember how it went on or I got mixed up, my hand would move stealthily towards my pocket, as though I were a cadet, bringing out proscribed books during the lecture on tactics."
"Aber zwischen einer Frau, die ihre Neigung an einen Mann einmal verraten, und diesem Mann schwingt eine feurige, eine geheimnisvolle, eine gefährliche Luft. Liebenden ist immer unheimliche Hellsichtigkeit für das wahre Glück des Geliebten zu eigen, und da Liebe ihrem innersten Wesen gemäß allemal das Grenzenlose will, muß alles Maßvolle, alles Gemäßigte ihr widrig, ihr unerträglich sein. In jedem Gehemmtsein und Eingedämmtsein des andern ahnt sie den Widerstand, in jedem Nicht-voll-sich-Gewähren mit Recht die verborgene Gegenwehr. Und etwas mußte damals offenbar verlegen und verwirrt in meiner Haltung, etwas unehrlich und ungeschickt in meinen Worten gewesen sein, denn alle meine Bemühungen hielten ihrem wachsamen Warten nicht stand. Das Letzte gelang mir nicht: sie zu überzeugen, und immer unruhiger ahnte ihr Mißtrauen, daß ich das Eigentliche, das Einzige nicht gab, das sie von mir begehrte: die Gegenliebe der Liebe. Manchmal hob sie inmitten des Gesprächs – und gerade dann, wenn ich am eifrigsten um ihr Zutrauen, um ihre Herzlichkeit warb – den grauen Blick scharf zu mir empor; dann mußte ich immer die Lider senken. Mir war, als hätte sie eine Sonde hinabgestoßen, um den untersten Grund meines Herzens zu erkunden.","But between a woman who once betrays her attraction to a man and this man there is a fiery, mysterious, dangerous atmosphere. Lovers always possess an uncanny clairvoyance for the true happiness of their loved one, and since love, in accordance with its innermost nature, always wants the limitless, everything moderate, everything moderate must be repugnant and unbearable to it. She suspects resistance in each other's inhibition and containment, and rightly the hidden resistance in each failure to fully grant oneself. And at that time there must have been something embarrassed and confused in my attitude, something dishonest and clumsy in my words, for all my efforts did not stand up to her watchful waiting. I couldn't do the last thing: convince her, and her distrust suspected more and more uneasily that I wasn't giving the real, the only thing she wanted from me: love in return. Sometimes, in the middle of the conversation—and just when I was most eagerly courting her trust and cordiality—she raised her gray eyes sharply to me; then I always had to lower my eyelids. I felt as if she had dropped a probe to probe the bottom of my heart.","But there is always something fiery, dangerous and mysterious in the air between a woman who has once shown a man her feelings for him and the man himself. Those who love have an uncanny perception of what makes the beloved truly happy, and as it is the essence of love is to wish for boundless ardour, anything measured and temperate is alien and indeed intolerable to it. Love detects rejection in every inhibition of the beloved, every evidence of restraint, it suspects unwillingness in any reluctance to make an unconditional commitment, and it is right. There must obviously have been something awkward, confused and clumsy in my attitude at the time, a touch of falsity in my voice, for none of my efforts could withstand her watchful waiting for some sign from me. I could not manage it , I could not convince her, and she suspected, with increasing uneasiness, that I was not giving her the real and only thing she wanted from me, my love in return for hers. Sometimes, in the middle of a conversation—and just when I was trying my hardest to make her believe in the warmth of my feelings—she would suddenly raise her grey eyes, and then I had to lower my own eyelids. I felt as if she were probing my heart, exploring its depths.","But between a woman who has once let a man see her desire and that man the atmosphere is charged with mysterious, dangerous tension. It is characteristic of those who love to have an uncanny insight into the true feelings of the beloved; and since love, according to the inmost laws of its being, ever desires the illimitable, all finiteness, all moderation, is repugnant, intolerable to it. In every sign of constraint, of restraint, on the part of the other it suspects opposition; any reluctance to yield utterly it rightly interprets as secret resistance. And there must have been a trace of embarrassment and confusion in my behaviour, of disingenuousness and gaucherie in what I said, for all my efforts were no match for her alert expectancy. I failed in my ultimate task: that of convincing her, and in her mistrust she divined with growing disquiet that I was failing to do the one thing, the only thing, she desired: to reciprocate her love. Sometimes, in the middle of a conversation, and at a moment when I was most eagerly making a bid for her confidence, her friendliness, she would throw me a keen look out of her grey eyes, and I would be obliged to lower my gaze. I would feel as though she were sounding the very depths of my heart."
Wie sollte ich mich weigern? Vor mir saß mit schwimmenden Augen der alte Mann und wartete auf mein Ja wie auf die Posaune des Jüngsten Gerichts. Selbstverständlich versprach ich ihm alles. Mit einem Ruck stießen mir seine beiden Hände entgegen.,"How should I refuse? The old man sat in front of me with swimming eyes and waited for my yes as for the trumpet of judgment. Of course I promised him everything. With a jerk, both his hands came towards me.","How could I refuse? The old man was sitting in front of me, eyes swimming with tears, waiting for me to say yes as if waiting for the last trump to blow on Judgement Day. Of course I promised to do as he wanted. He impulsively reached both hands out to me.","How was I to refuse? There in front of me, his eyes swimming, sat the old man, waiting for my assent as though for the Last Trump. Naturally I promised all he asked. His hands shot out towards me."
"Ich rase die Treppe hinab. Tatsächlich, im Hof sind sie alle schon versammelt, die ganze Garnison; mir bleibt gerade noch Zeit, neben den Feldkuraten zu treten, und schon erscheint der Divisionär. Er schreitet sonderbar langsam und feierlich, entfaltet ein Blatt und beginnt mit weithin tönender Stimme:","I race down the stairs. Indeed, in the yard they are all already assembled, the whole garrison; I have just enough time to step up to the field chaplain and the general appears.

Walking exercises, stretching exercises, all very decent. It might be about an atom better than last time. As I said, we can be satisfied.

But you ought to know me by now. You know I don’t like mixing shop with food — and besides, I really was too frightfully hungry, too tired. I’ve been on the go continuously since half-past seven this morning, and I felt as though not only my stomach, but my head, were left high and dry. Well then’ — he took a long pull at his cigar and blew out a ring of blue smoke — ‘well then, my dear friend, let us get down to business. Everything is quite satisfactory — walking exercises, stretching exercises, all going very well indeed. Perhaps even a shade better than when I saw her last. As I have said, we may be very satisfied. The only thing is’ — he took another pull at his cigar — ‘her general state of mind, what one may term her psychical condition, as regards that , I found her — now don’t be alarmed , I beg you, my dear friend! — I found somewhat of a change in her today.’"
"»Armer Kerl, dir müssen’s aber gehörig zugesetzt haben – keine Angst, ich inquirier dich nicht, ich seh schon selber genug. Wenn’s einmal so weit ist, nutzt kein Zureden und Wegreden mehr. Da muß man eben als Kamerad zugreifen, und daß da nix fehlen wird, dafür braucht’s kein besonderes Jurament. Nur eins, Hofmiller, so vernünftig wirst doch sein, daß dir nicht einredst, ich könnt dich bei uns gleich in Glanz und Glorie hinaufschubsen. So was gibt’s in keinem ordentlichen Betrieb, das möchte nur böses Blut machen bei die andern, wenn einer ihnen mir nix, dir nix über die Schultern springt. Du mußt schon ganz von unten anfangen, vielleicht ein paar Monate bei blödsinnigen Schreibereien im Kontor sitzen, bevor man dich hinüberschicken kann in die Plantagen oder sonst was herauszaubern. Jedenfalls, wie g’sagt, ich wer’s schon deichseln. Morgen fahren wir ab, meine Frau und ich, acht oder zehn Tage bummeln wir in Paris, dann geht’s für ein paar Tage nach Havre und Antwerpen, Inspektion in den Agenturen. Aber in rund drei Wochen sind wir zurück, und gleich aus Rotterdam schreib ich dir. Keine Sorg – ich vergeß nicht! Auf den Balinkay kannst dich verlassen.«","""Poor fellow, it must have gotten you pretty bad - don't worry, I'm not asking you, I've seen enough for myself. Once the time has come, persuasion and talking away is no longer of use. You have to take action as a comrade, and you don't need a special Jurament to ensure that nothing is missing. Just one thing, Hofmiller, you'll be so reasonable that you won't persuade yourself that I could shove you up here in pomp and glory. There's nothing like that in any regular company, it just wants to cause bad blood for the others if someone jumps over their shoulders for me, nothing for you. You have to start from the bottom, maybe sit in the office for a couple of months writing nonsense before they can conjure you up to the plantations or something else. Anyway, as I said, I'll draw it up. We're leaving tomorrow, my wife and I, we'll stroll around Paris for eight or ten days, then we'll go to Havre and Antwerp for a few days, inspection in the agencies. But we'll be back in about three weeks, and I'll write to you straight from Rotterdam. Don't worry - I won't forget! You can count on the Balinkay.”","“Poor lad, you certainly seem to be in a bad way—don’t worry, I won’t put you through an interrogation. I can see enough for myself. Once you get to that stage, no amount of persuasion is any use. Well, a comrade has to lend a hand, and I don’t suppose I need to say I won’t be backward in that. Just one thing, Hofmiller , I’m sure you have enough sense not to think I can simply snap my fingers and set you up in grand style in one of our companies. Such things don’t happen in a good organisation, it only makes for bad feeling if one man suddenly gets preferential treatment. You’d have to start at the very bottom, maybe spend a few months on tedious clerical work in an office before you could be sent over to the plantations, or we could think up something else for you. But as I said, I’ll start the wheels turning. We’re leaving tomorrow, my wife and I, we’ll spend a week or ten days strolling around Paris, then we’ll be in Le Havre and Antwerp for a few days, looking into our agencies there. But we’ll be back in around three weeks’ time, and I’ll write to you as soon as I’m home in Rotterdam. I won’t forget, don’t worry. You can rely on the word of a Balinkay.”","‘Poor fellow, you must have been through it — oh, don’t worry, I’m not going to cross-examine you! I can see for myself. When things have got to such a pass, persuasion and dissuasion are of no more use. One’s got to hold out a helping hand, and there’s no need for me to tell you I’ll do my very best. There’s only one thing, though, Hofmiller; you must be sensible and not get the idea into your head that I can push you up to the top of the tree straight away. That sort of thing’s out of the question in a decent business; it only makes bad blood if one man is promoted over the heads of the others. You’ll have to begin right at the bottom. You may even have to sit at a desk in the counting-house for a few months before we can send you out to the plantations or fit you in somewhere else. Anyway, as I have said, I’ll fix up something for you. My wife and I are leaving tomorrow, and after a week or ten days in Paris we’re going for a few days to Le Havre and Antwerp to have a look at our agencies.

"Ich reite voran. Ich reite leidenschaftlich gern. Rieselnd spüre ich von den Hüften her das schwingende, schlingernde Blut im aufgelockerten Leib als lebendige Lebenswärme kreisen, indes einem sausend die kalte Luft um Stirn und Backen fährt. Herrliche morgendliche Luft: den Tau der Nacht schmeckt man noch darin, den Atem der aufgelockerten Erde, den Ruch der blühenden Felder, und zugleich umfließt einen der warme, sinnliche Dampf der atmenden Nüstern. Immer begeistert mich von neuem dieser erste Morgengalopp, der den stockigen, schlaftrunkenen Leib so wohlig durchschüttelt und die Benommenheit wie dumpfen Nebel wegreißt; unwillkürlich dehnt das Gefühl der Leichtigkeit, die mich trägt, mir die Brust, und mit aufgetanen Lippen trinke ich die sausende Luft in mich ein. »Galopp! Galopp!« – ich spüre die Augen heller, die Sinne lebendiger werden, und hinter mir klingt in regelmäßigem Rhythmus das Klickern der Säbel, das stoßende Schnauben der Pferde, das weiche, knisternde Quellen und Quietschen der Sättel, der gleiche schlagende Takt der Hufe. Ein einziger centaurischer Leib ist diese sausende Gruppe der Männer und Pferde, von einem einzigen Schwung getragen. Vor, vor, vor, Galopp, Galopp, Galopp! Ah, so reiten, so reiten bis ans Ende der Welt! Mit dem heimlichen Stolz, Herr und Schöpfer dieser Lust zu sein, wende ich mich manchmal im Sattel zurück, um meine Leute anzuschauen. Und mit einemmal sehe ich, alle meine braven Ulanen haben andere Gesichter. Die schwere ruthenische Bedrücktheit, die Dumpfheit, die Unausgeschlafenheit ist wie Ruß weggewischt von ihren Augen. Straffer richten sie sich auf, da sie sich beobachtet fühlen, mit lächelndem Mund erwidern sie die Freude in meinem Blick. Ich spüre, auch diese dumpfen Bauernburschen sind durchdrungen von der Lust der sausenden Bewegung, diesem Vortraum menschlichen Flugs. Alle empfinden sie genau so beseligt wie ich das animalische Glück ihres Jungseins, ihrer angespannten und zugleich erlösten Kraft.","I ride ahead. I am passionate about horseback riding. From my hips, I can feel the swaying, lurching blood circling in my relaxed body like living warmth, while the cold air rushes across my forehead and cheeks. Wonderful morning air: you can still taste the dew of the night in it, the breath of the loosened earth, the smell of the blooming fields, and at the same time the warm, sensual steam of your breathing nostrils flows around you. I'm always fascinated by this first morning gallop, which soothingly shakes my stuffy, drowsy body and sweeps away my drowsiness like dull fog; involuntarily the feeling of lightness that carries me expands my chest, and with open lips I drink in the rushing air. ""Gallop! Gallop!” – I can feel my eyes brighten, my senses become more alive, and behind me the clicking of sabers, the snort of the horses, the soft, crackling swelling and squeaking of the saddles, the same beating rhythm of the hooves sounds in a regular rhythm. A single Centaurian body is this dashing company of men and horses, borne by a single momentum. Before, before, before, gallop, gallop, gallop! Ah, ride like that, ride like that, to the end of the world! With secret pride in being the master and creator of this lust, I sometimes turn back in the saddle to look at my people. And all of a sudden I see that all my brave Uhlans have different faces. The heavy Ruthenian oppression, the dullness, the lack of sleep has been wiped away from her eyes like soot. They straighten up tighter because they feel like they're being watched, with a smile on their face they return the joy in my eyes. I feel that even these dull peasant lads are imbued with the joy of rushing movement, this pre-dream of human flight. They all feel just as blissful as I do the animal happiness of their youth, their tense and at the same time redeemed strength.","I am in the lead. I am passionately fond of riding.

Wonderful morning air; you can still taste last night’s dew in it, the breath of the turned soil, the scent of fields in flower, and at the same time you are surrounded by the warm, sensuous moisture from the horses’ nostrils as they breathe out. I always love this first morning gallop that does the lethargic, still sleepy body such good, shaking it up, snatching away drowsiness like a dull mist. Instinctively, my parted lips drink in the air rushing by as a sense of being weightless carries me forward and my chest expands. “Gallop! Gallop!” I feel that my eyes are brighter, my senses livelier, and behind me the men’s swords clink in a regular rhythm, the horses snort , there’s a soft squeal and squeak from the saddles, the beat of hoofs falling in time.

Gone is their heavy Ruthenian air of morose depression, they are wide awake now, the drowsiness wiped from their eyes as if it were soot. Aware that I am observing them, they straighten themselves in the saddle and smile back, in response to the pleasure in my own gaze. I sense that even these dull-witted peasant lads are full of the joy of swift movement, a dreamlike anticipation of human flight.

I was always thrilled afresh by this first morning gallop, which so agreeably shook up one’s fusty, drowsy body and chased away one’s stupor as though it were a suffocating fog; the feeling of buoyancy which bore me along automatically expanded my lungs, and with mouth wide open I drank in the rushing air. ‘ Gallop! Gallop!’ I felt my eyes brighten, my senses quicken, and behind me I could hear the rhythmic clank of the swords, the spasmodic snorts of the horses, the faint creaking of the saddles as they rose and fell, the even thud of the hoofs. It was one single Centaurian body, this charging group of men and horses, carried along by one single impetus. On, on, on, gallop, gallop, gallop! Ah, to ride thus, to ride thus to the ends of the earth! With a secret, proud feeling that I was the Lord and Creator of this exhilaration, I turned round in my saddle from time to time to glance at my men. And suddenly I saw all my good Uhlans had a new expression on their faces. The Ruthenian sullenness, the lethargy, the sleep had been wiped from their eyes as though it were a layer of soot. Feeling my gaze on them, they drew themselves up in the saddle and answered with smiling lips the joy in my eyes.

They will sing, they will sing the latest verses from the ""Wirtin an der Lahn,"" they will tell jokes, they will laugh and laugh and laugh. Suddenly I can no longer see the good-natured, shiny faces. Didn't she write that I should just send a note, just one word? Shouldn't I just pick up the phone and call outside? You can't keep people waiting like that! You have to tell him something, you have to...","But I am suddenly overcome by horror. The coarse laughter is like a claw tightening on my heart. How can they laugh like that when someone, somewhere, is crying out and suffering in unimaginable pain? How can they joke and tell dirty stories while another human being is in a state of desperation? I know that once Wondraczek has finished his comic turn the evening will lapse into horseplay. There will be singing, they’ll sing the latest hilarious verses of the song about ‘The Landlady on the River Lahn’, they’ll crack jokes and fall about with uproarious laughter. Suddenly I can’t stand the sight of their well-meaning, cheerful faces. Didn’t she ask me to send her a note, a single word? Why don’t I go to the telephone and call Kekesfalva’s house? I can’t keep another human being waiting like that! I have to say something, I have to …","But suddenly I was seized with a feeling of revulsion. This ribald laughter clawed at my heart. How could they laugh like that when somewhere someone was groaning in despair, suffering boundless torments? How could they crack smutty jokes when someone was in agony of soul? The moment Wondraczek had come to an end of his silly twaddle, the real orgy, I knew, would begin. There would be songs; they would bawl out ‘The Good-wife on the Lahn,’ they would retail funny stories, they would laugh uproariously. All of a sudden I felt unable to bear the sight of all these good-humoured, glowing faces. Had she not asked me in her letter to send her just a note, just one word? Ought I not to go to the telephone and ring her up? One couldn’t leave a person in suspense like that. One ought to send some message, one ought ..."
"Wie sie sich jetzt nach erledigter Bestellung zum Gehen wendet, springt Herr Großmaier hastig vor, um ihr die Tür zu öffnen. Auch mein Herr Apotheker erhebt sich von seinem Sitze, um sich von der Vorbeischwebenden respektvollst zu empfehlen. Sie dankt mit souveräner Freundlichkeit – Donnerwetter, was für samtene, rehbraune Augen! – und ich kann kaum erwarten, bis sie, überzuckert von vielen Komplimenten, den Laden verlassen hat, um neugierigst meinen Partner nach diesem Hecht im Karpfenteich zu fragen.","As she now turns to leave after completing her order, Herr Großmaier hastily jumps forward to open the door for her. My pharmacist also rises from his seat to respectfully commend himself to the passing woman. She thanks you with sovereign friendliness – gosh, what velvety, fawn-colored eyes! – and I can hardly wait until she has left the shop, smothered in so many compliments, to curiously ask my partner about that pike in the carp pond.","Now, as she turns to go after leaving her order, Herr Grossmaier hastily leaps forward to open the door for her. My friend the pharmacist also rises from his chair to offer his respectful greetings as she floats past. She thanks him with gracious friendliness—heavens, what velvety brown eyes, the colour of a roe deer— and I can hardly wait until she has left the shop, amidst many fulsome compliments, to ask my chess partner with great interest about this girl, a pike in a pond full of fat carp.","As, her order completed, she turned to go, Herr Grossmaier rushed forward to open the door for her. My friend the apothecary also got up to bow most respectfully as she swept past. She acknowledged the courtesy with regal graciousness — devil take it, what velvety deep-brown eyes! — and I could scarcely wait until, overwhelmed with sugary compliments, she had left the shop, to begin pumping my companion about this swan in our duck-pond."
"Diesem Balinkay mußte unser Oberst Bubencic damals aus einem dicken Schlamassel geholfen haben, denn Balinkays Treue zu ihm und zum Regiment blieb wirklich rührend. Jedesmal, wenn er nach Österreich kam, fuhr er eigens herüber in die Garnison und schmiß mit dem Gelde so toll herum, daß man noch wochenlang davon in der Stadt erzählte. Die alte Uniform für einen Abend anzuziehen, wieder Kamerad unter Kameraden zu sein, war ihm eine Art Herzensbedürfnis. Wenn er an dem gewohnten Offizierstisch saß, locker und leicht, spürte man ihm an, daß ihm dieser schlechtgetünchte rauchige Saal im »Roten Löwen« hundertmal mehr Heimat war als sein feudales Palais an einer Amsterdamer Gracht: wir waren und blieben seine Kinder, seine Brüder, seine wahre Familie. Alljährlich stiftete er Preise für unsere Steeplechase, regelmäßig kamen zu Weihnachten zwei oder drei Kisten bunter Bolsschnäpse und Champagnerkörbe angerückt, und mit absoluter Verläßlichkeit konnte der Oberst jedes Neujahr einen saftigen Scheck für die Kameradschaftskasse bei der Bank einkassieren. Wer die Ulanka und am Kragen unsere Aufschläge trug, durfte sich auf Balinkay verlassen, wenn er irgend einmal in Schwulitäten geriet: ein Brief und alles war ausgeputzt.","Our Colonel Bubencic must have helped this Balinkay out of a big mess, because Balinkay's loyalty to him and to the regiment was really touching. Every time he came to Austria he drove over to the garrison and threw the money around so madly that people in town talked about it for weeks. To put on the old uniform for an evening, to be comrades among comrades again, was a kind of heartfelt need for him. When he sat at the usual officers' table, relaxed and easy, you could tell that this badly whitewashed, smoky hall in the ""Roter Löwen"" was a hundred times more home to him than his feudal palace on an Amsterdam canal: we were and will remain his children, his brothers , his real family. Every year he donated prizes for our steeplechase, two or three cases of colorful Bols schnapps and champagne baskets regularly arrived at Christmas, and with absolute reliability the colonel was able to collect a hefty check for the comradeship fund at the bank every New Year. Anyone who wore the ulanka and our lapels on their collars could rely on Balinkay if they ever got into gay affairs: one letter and everything was cleaned up.","Colonel Bubencic must have helped this Balinkay out of some appalling fix back in the past, because Balinkay’s loyalty to him and the regiment was nothing short of touching. Whenever he was in Austria he came over here especially to visit the garrison, and he would throw his money about so freely that it was the talk of the town for weeks. He seemed to feel a need to wear his old uniform just for an evening, be one of the lads with his comrades again. When he was sitting at the officers’ regular table, easy-going and relaxed, you felt that he was a hundred times more at home in that smoky, badly whitewashed room in the Red Lion that in his grand feudal palace on an Amsterdam canal; the men of the regiment were, and always would be, his children, his brothers, his real family. Every year he donated prizes for our steeplechase, two or three crates of liqueurs and champagne regularly arrived at Christmas, and every New Year the Colonel could count for certain on a generous cheque to be paid into the bank for the mess funds. Anyone in lancers’ uniform, with our facings on the collar, knew that if he was ever in trouble he could rely on Balinkay—a letter to him, and his problems would be over.","Colonel Bubencic must have got Balinkay out of the dickens of a scrape, for Balinkay’s loyalty to him and the regiment was really touching. Whenever he returned to Austria, he made a point of paying a visit to the garrison, and he would throw his money about so wildly that it would be the talk of the town for weeks afterwards. It seemed to be a sort of emotional necessity for him to put on the old uniform for one evening, to be accepted once more by the officers as one of themselves. When he sat, entirely at his ease, at the familiar table, one felt that he was a hundred times more at home in the smoky room at the Red Lion with its grubby walls than in his feudal palace on an Amsterdam canal. We were and always would be his children, his brothers, his real family. Every year he offered a prize for our steeple-chase, regularly every Christmas he would send along two or three cases of Bols and of champagne, and every New Year the Colonel was able to pay a nice fat cheque into the mess account at the bank. Anyone who wore the Uhlan’s tunic and our facings on his collar could depend on Balinkay if ever he got into difficulties — a letter, and the whole thing was cleared up."
"»Alles ist in bester Ordnung«, beruhigte ich ihn. »Alles wird gut, ich habe volle Zuversicht. Morgen nachmittag erzähle ich Ihnen mehr, ganz genau berichte ich Ihnen jedes Wort. Aber jetzt nur rasch zum Wagen, Sie sehen doch, wir haben keine Zeit zu verlieren.«","""Everything is fine,"" I reassured him. “Everything will be fine, I have full confidence. I'll tell you more tomorrow afternoon, I'll tell you every word in detail. But now hurry to the car, you see, we have no time to lose.”","“Everything’s fine,” I reassured him. “I have every confidence that it will all turn out well. I’ll tell you more tomorrow afternoon , I’ll tell you every word we said. But now you must get back to the car. You can see that there’s no time to lose.”","‘Everything is quite all right,’ I said reassuringly. ‘Everything will be all right, I am confident of that. Tomorrow afternoon I will tell you more, I’ll tell you every word that was said. But now we must get you to your car, quickly. You can see for yourself there’s no time to lose ...’"
"Alle drei starren mich jetzt an. »Donnerwetter«, schnauft schließlich Ferencz, »du suchst dir aber deine Kameraden neuestens gut aus! Alle Hochachtung! Von mir hättst höchstens eine tombakene Zündholzdosen statt so was bekommen.«","All three are staring at me now. Finally, Ferencz snorts, “You choose your comrades well these days! All respect! The best you could have gotten from me was a tombakene matchbox instead of something like that.”","All three are now staring at me. “Good heavens,” says Ferencsz at last, “you choose your friends well these days. My respects! You’d have got a brass matchbox from me at the most.”",All three of them now stared at me. ‘The devil!’ breathed Ferencz at last. ‘I must say you choose your friends well these days. My compliments! You’d have got a metal matchbox case from me and have considered yourself deuced lucky!’
"Der alte Mann blieb unbeweglich. Zuerst meinte ich, er hätte gar nicht begriffen, was ich sagte. Aber allmählich ging eine Bewegung durch seinen kraftlosen Körper. Mühsam hob er den Kopf und starrte vor sich hin ins Leere. Dann griff er mit beiden Händen an die Tischkante, und ich merkte, er wollte den lastenden Körper aufstemmen, er wollte aufstehen, jedoch es gelang ihm nicht gleich. Zweimal, dreimal versagte ihm die Kraft. Endlich arbeitete er sich hoch und stand, schwankend noch von der Anstrengung, dunkel im Dunkel, die Pupillen starr wie schwarzes Glas. Dann sagte er mit einem ganz fremden, einem grauenhaft gleichgültigen Ton, als ob seine eigene, seine menschliche Stimme ihm gestorben wäre, vor sich hin:","The old man remained motionless. At first I thought he didn't understand what I was saying. But gradually a movement went through his limp body. He raised his head with difficulty and stared into space. Then he grabbed the edge of the table with both hands and I noticed that he wanted to pry open the weight of his body, he wanted to get up, but he didn't succeed right away. Twice, three times he lost his strength. At last he worked his way up and stood, still swaying from the exertion, dark in the dark, his pupils fixed like black glass. Then he said to himself in a very strange, horribly indifferent tone, as if his own human voice had died to him:","The old man did not move for some time. At first I thought he simply hadn’t taken in what I was saying. But gradually a movement did run through his exhausted body. He laboriously raised his head and stared into the empty air. Then he took hold of the edge of the table with both hands, and I realised that he was trying to brace his weight on it, trying to stand up, but he couldn’t do it at once. Twice, three times he could not summon up the strength. At last he managed to get to his feet, and stood there, still swaying with the effort, a dark figure in the dim light, his pupils staring like black glass. Then he said in a new and shockingly indifferent tone of voice, as if his own human voice had failed him, “Then …","The old man remained motionless. At first I thought he had not taken in what I had said, but gradually his frail body stirred. With an effort he raised his head and stared before him into space. Then he gripped the edge of the table with both hands, and I realized that he was trying to lever up his feeble body, that he was trying to get up, but could not. Twice, thrice his strength gave out. At length he struggled to his feet and stood there, still swaying from the effort, a dark shadow in the darkness, his pupils fixed and rigid, like black glass. Then he said to himself in a far-away, dreadfully casual tone, as though his own, his human voice, had left him:"
"»Gehen Herr Leutnant schon?« fragt bei der Garderobe erstaunt die Ordonnanz. Hol dich der Teufel, murre ich innerlich und schiebe ohne ein Wort an ihm vorbei. Nur die Straße hinüber, rasch ums Eck und die Treppen der Kaserne in mein Stockwerk hinauf: allein sein, allein!","""Are you leaving, Herr Leutnant?"" the orderly asked in the cloakroom, amazed. Damn you, I grumble inwardly, pushing past him without a word. Just across the street, quickly around the corner and up the stairs of the barracks to my floor: to be alone, alone!","“Leaving already, sir?” asks the orderly on cloakroom duty in surprise. Oh, go to hell, I mutter silently to myself, pushing my way past him without a word. Now down the street, around the corner, up the stairs of the barracks to my floor, and I’ll be alone!","‘Is the Herr Leutnant going already?’ asked the orderly at the cloakroom in amazement. ‘ Go to the devil!’ I murmured under my breath, and pushed past him without a word. Across the road, round the corner and up the stairs to my room. Oh to be alone, alone!"
"»Natürlich, aber warum denn?«","""Of course, but why?""","“Of course, but why?”","‘Certainly, but why?’"
"Ich stockte. Auch Condor schwieg. Er wartete offenbar. Dann machte er unvermittelt zwei starke Schritte zur Tür und griff an den Lichtschalter. Scharf und mitleidslos – der grelle Schuß Licht zwang mich unwillkürlich, die Lider zu schließen – fuhren drei weiße Flammen in die Glühbirnen. Mit einem Schlag war das Zimmer taghell.",I stopped. Condor was also silent. Apparently he was waiting. Then suddenly he took two strong steps to the door and reached for the light switch. Sharp and pitiless - the glare of light forced me to shut my eyelids - three white flames shot into the bulbs. Suddenly the room was bright as day.,"I stopped. Condor was silent too. He was obviously waiting. Then he suddenly took two firm steps to the door and reached for the light switch. The flood of bright light, sharp and pitiless, forced me to close my eyes instinctively. Three electric bulbs flared into glaring light, and all at once the room was bright as day.","I faltered. Condor too was silent. He was evidently waiting for me to go on. Then, quite unexpectedly, he took two vigorous strides to the door and put his hand on the electric-light switch. Harsh and pitiless — the shrill blaze forced me to close my eyes — three white flames sprang to life in the bulbs, and the room was bright as day."
"Der schwarze Kaffee wird im Boudoir serviert, Kognak marschiert auf in großen, bauchigen, eisgekühlten Gläsern und dazu wiederum jenes Kaleidoskop von Schnäpsen, selbstverständlich auch die famosen dicken Zigarren mit den pompösen Bauchbinden. Mitten im Gespräch beugt sich Kekesfalva zu mir heran, um diskret anzufragen, was mir lieber sei: ob ich mitspielen wolle bei der Kartenpartie oder vorzöge, mit den Damen zu plaudern. Natürlich das letztere, erkläre ich schleunigst, denn mir wäre es doch nicht ganz behaglich, mit einem Oberstleutnant aus dem Kriegsministerium einen Rubber zu riskieren. Gewinnt man, so kann man ihn vielleicht verärgern, verliere ich, ist mein Monatsbudget geschmissen. Und dann, erinnere ich mich, habe ich im ganzen höchstens zwanzig Kronen in der Brieftasche.","The black coffee is served in the boudoir, cognac marches up in large, bulbous, ice-cold glasses and in turn that kaleidoscope of schnapps, of course also the famous thick cigars with the pompous lower thirds. In the middle of the conversation, Kekesfalva leans over to discreetly ask what I prefer: whether I want to play at the card game or whether I prefer to chat with the ladies. The latter, of course, I explain hastily, because I wouldn't be very comfortable risking a rubber with a lieutenant colonel from the War Department. If you win, you might annoy him, if I lose, my monthly budget is gone. And then, I remember, I have at most twenty crowns in my wallet.","Then black coffee is served in the boudoir, cognac is brought in large, chilled, balloon-shaped glasses, and once again that kaleidoscope of liqueurs is on offer. So, of course, are the fat cigars with showy bands around them. In the middle of the conversation Kekesfalva leans over to me and asks discreetly whether I would rather join the card party or talk to the ladies. The latter, of course, I am quick to say, because I am not entirely happy with the idea of risking a rubber with a Lieutenant Colonel from the War Ministry. If I were to win it might annoy him; if I were to lose, there went my budget for the rest of this month. Moreover, I remind myself, I have only twenty crowns in my wallet at the most.","Black coffee was served in the drawing room, brandy made its bow in huge, big-bellied ice-cold glasses, accompanied by a whole kaleidoscope of liqueurs, and those marvellous fat cigars, of course, with the imposing bands. In the midst of the conversation Kekesfalva bent over me to ask whether I would prefer to join the gentlemen at cards or to stay and chat with the ladies. The latter, of course, I declared with alacrity, for I should not have felt altogether easy at risking a rubber with a Lieutenant-Colonel from the War Ministry. If I won, I might perhaps annoy him; if I lost, then goodbye to my month’s allowance. And then, too, I remembered that I had only twenty crowns on me."
"»Nun, was ist los … warum zögern Sie denn so herum?« drängte Edith. »Sie wissen doch, wie wichtig mir jedes Wort ist. Also – was hat Condor Ihnen gesagt!«","'Well, what's the matter… why are you hesitating?' Edith pressed. “You know how important every word is to me. So - what did Condor tell you!'",“What is it … why do you hesitate like that?” Edith pressed me. “You know how much every word matters to me. So what did Condor tell you?”,"‘Well, what’s the matter ... why are you hesitating?’ said Edith in persistent tones. ‘You must know how important every word is to me. Well — what did Condor say to you?’"
»Gewiß.«,"""Certainly.""",“By all means.”,"‘Why, of course.’"
"Erst duldete man ihn. Bald begann man ihn zu bemerken und sogar schon zu brauchen. Denn er wußte von allem und kannte sich in allem aus; da war eine Witwe, die eine Tochter zu verheiraten suchte, sofort improvisierte er sich als Heiratsvermittler; dort einer, der nach Amerika auswandern wollte und dazu Auskünfte und Papiere brauchte: Leopold brachte sie zusammen. Außerdem kaufte er alte Kleider, Uhren, Antiquitäten, schätzte und tauschte Felder und Waren und Pferde, und wenn ein Offizier Bürgschaft benötigte, schaffte er sie herbei. Von Jahr zu Jahr erweiterten sich gleichzeitig seine Kenntnisse und sein Wirkungskreis.","At first they tolerated him. Soon people began to notice him and even needed him. Because he knew everything and knew everything; there was a widow who was trying to marry off a daughter, he immediately improvised as a matchmaker; there someone who wanted to emigrate to America and needed information and papers: Leopold brought them together. He also bought old clothes, clocks, antiques, appraised and bartered fields and goods and horses, and if an officer needed surety he would procure it. From year to year both his knowledge and his sphere of activity expanded.","“At first he was merely tolerated. But soon people began to notice him, even to need his services. He knew about everything, he knew the way of the world in general. If there was a widow who wanted to get her daughter married, he would instantly set up shop as a marriage broker; if there was a man planning to emigrate to America who needed information and papers, Leopold would get them for him. He also dealt in old clothes, watches and clocks, and antiques; he gave estimates of the value of land, goods and horses and saw the subsequent deals through, and if an officer needed someone to stand surety for him, Kanitz would fix it. His knowledge and his sphere of influence expanded in parallel to each other year after year.","At first people tolerated him. Soon they began to take notice of him and even to need him. For he knew everything and was an expert on everything; was there a widow, for example, who was trying to marry off her daughter, he would come out in the role of marriage broker; was there someone who wanted to emigrate to America and needed information and papers, Leopold would procure them. In addition, he bought and sold old clothes, clocks, antiquarian articles, valued and exchanged land and goods and horses, and when an officer wanted a loan, he always managed to procure it for him. His knowledge and his sphere of operations widened from year to year."
»Tu dich kommod! Und jetzt keine Faxen – schieß los. Schwulitäten mit Geld oder Weiberg’schichten?«,"""Get comfortable! And now no faxes - shoot away. Gays with money or Weiberg'shifts?""","Finally he growled briefly, without offering me a chair, “Well, make yourself comfortable. Now, no havering, out with it! Money problems, eh? Or trouble with women?”","‘Make yourself at home,’ he growled at length, without offering me a chair; he was still panting for breath. ‘ Let’s have no beating about the bush — out with it. Is it money difficulties, or trouble with women?’"
»So.« Er stieß das Notizbuch in die Brusttasche zurück wie einen Säbel in die Scheide. Es war der gleiche klirrende Ton in diesem abschließenden »so«.,"""So."" He thrust the notebook back into his breast pocket like a saber into its scabbard. It was the same jangly note in that final ""so.""","He put the notebook back in his breast pocket as if he were sheathing a sword, with the same sharp sound as his utterance of that final “Good”.",He stowed the notebook away in his breast-pocket as though sheathing a sword — and there was the same ring of finality in his ‘I see.’ ‘I see.
"»Nein, nein … ich glaube nur, wir lassen sie lieber heute ausruhen, und dann …« – sie zögert merkwürdig lange – »und dann … es kommt ja jetzt auf einen Tag nicht so an. Wir müssen doch … wir werden doch die Abreise noch verschieben müssen.«","'No, no... I just think we'd better let her rest today, and then...' - she hesitates for a long time - 'and then... one day doesn't really matter. We've got to ... we'll have to postpone our departure.""","“No, no … I just think we’d better let her rest today, and then … ” Here she hesitates for quite a long time. “And then … well, a day or so here or there makes no difference, not now. We must … we have to put off the trip to Switzerland.”","‘Oh no ... but I think we’d better let her have a good rest today, and then ...’ — she hesitated for a remarkably long time — ‘and then ... one day doesn’t matter so much now. We shall have to ... we shall have to postpone our departure.’"
Kapitel 28,Chapter 28,Where now?,Where was I to go now?
"»Keine neuen Erfindungen jetzt … nur keine neuen Unwahrheiten, ich ertrag keine mehr! Mit Lügen bin ich überfüttert bis zum Erbrechen. Von früh bis abends löffelt man sie mir ein: ›Wie gut du heute aussiehst, wie famos du heute marschierst … großartig, es geht schon viel, viel besser‹ – immer dieselben Beruhigungspillen von früh bis abends, und keiner merkt, daß ich daran ersticke. Warum sagen Sie nicht kerzengrad: Ich habe gestern keine Zeit, keine Lust gehabt. Wir haben doch kein Abonnement auf Sie und nichts hätt mich mehr gefreut, als wenn Sie mir durchs Telephon hätten sagen lassen: ›Ich komm heut nicht hinaus, wir bummeln lieber in der Stadt lustig herum.‹ Halten Sie mich für so albern, daß ich’s nicht verstehen sollte, wie Ihnen das manchmal über sein muß, hier tagtäglich den barmherzigen Samariter zu spielen, und daß ein erwachsener Mann lieber herumreitet oder seine gesunden Beine spazierenführt, statt an einem fremden Lehnstuhl herumzuhocken? Nur eins ist mir widerlich und eins ertrag ich nicht: Ausreden und Schwindel und Lügereien – damit bin ich eingedeckt bis an den Hals. Ich bin nicht so dumm, wie ihr alle meint, und kann schon einen guten Brocken Aufrichtigkeit vertragen. Sehen Sie, vor ein paar Tagen kriegten wir eine neue böhmische Aufwaschfrau ins Haus, die alte war gestorben, und am ersten Tag – sie hatte noch mit niemandem gesprochen – merkt sie, wie man mir mit meinen Krücken hinüberhilft in den Fauteuil. Im Schreck läßt sie die Schrubbürste fallen und schreit laut: ›Jeschusch, so ein Unglück, so ein Unglück! Ein so reiches, so vornehmes Fräulein … und ein Krüppel!‹ Wie eine Wilde ist Ilona auf die ehrliche Person losgefahren; gleich wollten sie die Arme entlassen und wegjagen. Aber mich, mich hat das gefreut, mir hat ihr Schrecken wohlgetan, weil es eben ehrlich, weil es menschlich ist, zu erschrecken, wenn man unvorbereitet so was sieht. Ich hab ihr auch sofort zehn Kronen geschenkt, und gleich ist sie in die Kirche gelaufen, um für mich zu beten … Den ganzen Tag hat’s mich noch gefreut, ja, faktisch gefreut, endlich einmal zu wissen, was ein fremder Mensch wirklich empfindet, wenn er mich zum erstenmal sieht … Aber ihr, ihr meint immer, mit eurer falschen Feinheit mich ›schonen‹ zu müssen, und bildet euch ein, daß ihr mir am End’ noch wohltut mit eurer verfluchten Rücksicht … Aber meint ihr, ich hab keine Augen im Kopf? Meint ihr, ich spür nicht hinter eurem Geschwätz und Gestammel das gleiche Grausen und Unbehagen heraus wie bei jener braven, jener einzig ehrlichen Person? Glaubt ihr, ich merk’s nicht, wie es euch mitten in den Atem fährt, wenn ich die Krücken anfaß und wie ihr hastig Konversation forciert, nur daß ich nichts merke – als ob ich euch nicht durch und durch kennte mit eurem Baldrian und Zucker, Zucker und Baldrian, diesem ganzen ekelhaften Geschleim … Oh, ich weiß haargenau, daß ihr jedesmal aufatmet, wenn ihr die Tür wieder hinter euch habt und mich liegen laßt wie einen Kadaver … genau weiß ich’s, wie ihr dann augenverdreherisch seufzt ›Das arme Kind‹, und gleichzeitig doch höchst zufrieden seid mit euch selbst, da ihr so schonungsvoll eine Stunde, zwei Stunden dem ›armen kranken Kind‹ geopfert habt. Aber ich will keine Opfer!","'No new inventions now... just no new untruths, I can't take any more! I'm fed up with lies to the point of vomiting. From morning to evening they are spooned into me: 'How good you look today, how splendidly you march today ... great, it's getting much, much better' - always the same tranquilizer pills from morning to evening, and nobody notices that I'm choking on them . Why don't you say straight out: I didn't have the time yesterday, nor did I feel like it. We don't have a subscription to you, and nothing would have made me happier than if you had let me know over the phone: 'I'm not going out today, we'd rather stroll around town.' You think I'm so silly that I do it shouldn't understand how you must sometimes get tired of playing the good Samaritan here every day, and that a grown man would rather ride around or walk his healthy legs than sit around in someone else's armchair? There's only one thing I disgust and one thing I can't stand: excuses and swindles and lies – I'm covered up to my neck with them. I'm not as dumb as you all think I am, and I can use a fair bit of sincerity. You see, a few days ago we got a new Bohemian cleaning woman into the house, the old one had died, and on the first day - she hadn't spoken to anyone yet - she noticed how they helped me over to the armchair with my crutches. Terrified, she drops the scrubbing brush and yells loudly: 'Yesush, such a misfortune, such a misfortune! Such a rich, such a distinguished young lady … and a cripple!‹ Ilona attacked the honest person like a savage; immediately they wanted to let go of the poor and chase away. But it made me happy, her terror did me good, because it's honest, because it's human to be shocked when you see something like that unprepared. I gave her ten crowns right away, and she immediately ran to church to pray for me... I was happy all day, yes, actually happy, to finally know what a stranger really feels when he sees me for the first time... But you always think you have to ""spare"" me with your false subtlety, and you imagine that in the end you'll do me good with your cursed consideration... But you think I have no eyes in the head? Don't you think I sense the same horror and uneasiness behind your chatter and rambling as I do in that good, that only honest person? Do you think I don't notice how it catches your breath when I pick up the crutches and how you hastily force conversation, only that I don't notice anything - as if I didn't know you through and through with your valerian and sugar, sugar and valerian, all that disgusting mucus... Oh, I know exactly how you breathe a sigh of relief every time you get through the door and leave me lying there like a corpse... I know exactly how you sigh, eyes rolling, 'Poor kid', and at the same time you are extremely satisfied with yourselves, since you have sacrificed an hour, two hours so graciously to the ""poor sick child"". But I don't want sacrifices!","But she snaps at me, “No more inventions, please … no new lies, I can’t bear any more. I get told so many lies that I feel quite sick. People are always coming up with lies from morning to night. ‘ Oh, you look so well today, you’re walking very well, wonderful , you’re much, much better!’ Always the same soothing, sugary stuff all day long, and no one notices it choking me. Why don’t you say, straight out: ‘I didn’t have either the time or the inclination to visit you yesterday’? We haven’t taken out a monopoly on your time, nothing would have pleased me more than if you’d just phoned to tell me, ‘I’m not coming out to see you today, we’re going to have a good time strolling about the town.’ Do you think I’m so silly that I can’t understand how boring it must be for you sometimes, acting the Good Samaritan here day after day , do you think I don’t realise that a grown man would rather go riding or walk about on his own strong legs instead of feeling bound to a stranger’s armchair? There’s only one thing that I simply can’t bear, and that’s excuses and deceit and lies—I’m sick and tired of them, sick and tired. I’m not as stupid as you all think , I can bear to hear the truth. You know, a few days ago we engaged a new Bohemian maid to do the dishes and scrub the floors because our old maid-of-all-work had died, and on her very first day, before she’d had a chance to talk to anyone yet, she sees me being helped into my chair with my crutches. She drops her scrubbing brush in horror, crying out loud, ‘Oh, dear Jesus, what a misfortune, oh, how sad! Such a rich, distinguished young lady, and a cripple!’ Ilona went for the good woman like a spitfire, she was all for having the poor soul dismissed and turned out. But I was glad, her horror did me good because it was honest, because it’s only human to take fright when you see something like that unexpectedly. I gave her ten crowns at once, and she went straight off to church to pray for me. I felt glad of it all day, genuinely glad to know for once what a stranger really feels on seeing me for the first time. But the rest of you, you always think you ought to ‘spare me’ with your false delicacy of feeling, you imagine that your wretched consideration for me does me good … do you think I don’t have eyes in my head? Do you think that, hidden behind all your chattering and stammering, I don’t sense the same discomfort, the same horror as that good, that genuinely honest soul? Do you all think I don’t notice you suddenly catching your breath when I pick up my crutches, hastily talking on so that I won’t notice—as if I didn’t see through you all with your sugary-sweet talk, valerian pills to soothe me, oh, it’s all so slimy and disgusting! I know just how you all breathe a sigh of relief when you can close the door behind you and leave me lying there like a dead body , do you think I don’t? I know exactly how you instantly sigh, ‘Oh, poor child,’ and at the same time you’re very pleased with yourselves for so generously giving up an hour or so of your time to the ‘poor child’. But I don’t want any sacrifices.","‘No more trumped-up stories, please — no fresh lies, I can’t do with any more. I’m stuffed up with lies till I’m absolutely sick. They’re dished up to me from morning to night. “How well you’re looking today, how splendidly you’re walking today ... really you’re much, much better!” — that’s how they try and drug me day in, day out, and no one seems to realize that I’m being suffocated. Why don’t you tell me straight out that you had no time to come yesterday, and no inclination either? We haven’t taken out a subscription in your company, and nothing would have pleased me better than if you had rung up and left a message to say you were not coming, but were going out on the spree somewhere with your friends. Do you think I’m so silly that I can’t understand your sometimes getting fed up with playing the Good Samaritan here day after day , can’t realize that a grown man would rather go for a ride or take his sound legs for a walk than sit about by an invalid’s chair? There’s only one thing that disgusts me, one thing I can’t stand, and that is excuses, humbug, lies — I’m fed to the teeth with them. I’m not so stupid as you all think, and I can stand quite a lot of frankness. A few days ago we engaged a new charwoman in place of the old one who had died, and the very first day she was here, before she had talked to anyone — she saw me being helped across to an arm-chair on my crutches. She dropped her scrubbing brush in horror and screamed out: “Lord Jesus, such a rich, distinguished young lady ... being a cripple!” Ilona went for the poor, honest creature like a wild thing; she was going to dismiss her and throw her out on the spot. But I, I liked it, the woman’s horror did me good, because, after all, it is honest, it is human, to be horrified at seeing such a sight all of a sudden. I promptly gave her ten crowns and she went off to the church to pray for me. The whole day I felt glad, yes, positively glad, at knowing at last what others really feel when they see me for the first time ... But you, all of you, you always think you’ve got to spare my feelings with your false sense of delicacy, and you fancy you’re being kind to me with your beastly consideration ... But do you think I haven’t eyes in my head? Do you think I can’t detect behind your chatter, your stuttering and stammering, the same horror and discomfiture as was felt by that good woman, that one honest person? Do you imagine I don’t see your embarrassed, dismayed looks when I pick up my crutches , don’t see how you hurriedly make conversation so that I shan’t notice? Just as though I didn’t know you all through and through, you and your Valerian drops and sugar, sugar and Valerian drops, that utterly disgusting muck! I know perfectly well that you heave a sigh of relief when you’ve shut the door behind you and left me lying there like a corpse ... I know perfectly well how you turn up your eyes and sigh, “The poor child!” And all the time you’re so jolly pleased with yourselves for having given up one or two hours to cosseting the “poor invalid”. But I don’t want your sacrifices."
"Um uns zischte, sauste und zuckte der Wind. Aber der alte Mann merkte nichts. Es gab keinen Himmel für ihn und keine Wolken und keinen Regen, es gab nur sein Kind und dessen Genesung auf Erden; wie hätte ich es da über mich bringen können, dem vor Aufregung und Schwäche Schlotternden nur karg das Faktische und Wahrhaftige zu berichten, daß Condor seiner Sache sich noch keinesfalls sicher fühle? Er brauchte doch etwas, an das er sich anklammern konnte wie vordem, im Hinsinken, an meinen helfenden Arm. So raffte ich das wenige Trostversprechende, das ich Condor mühsam abgerungen, hastig zusammen: ich erzählte ihm, daß Condor von einer neuen Kur gehört hätte, die Professor Viennot mit großem Erfolg in Frankreich erprobt habe. Sofort spürte ich im Dunkel etwas neben mir rascheln und sich regen; sein eben noch schlaff hingelehnter Leib drängte näher heran, als wollte er sich an mir wärmen. Eigentlich hätte ich jetzt nicht mehr versprechen dürfen, aber mein Mitleid riß mich weiter, als ich verantworten konnte. Ja, diese Kur hätte außerordentliche Erfolge, ermutigte ich ihn immer wieder und wieder, in vier Monaten, in drei Monaten seien damit ganz überraschende Heilungen erzielt worden und wahrscheinlich – nein: sogar soviel wie gewiß werde sie bei Edith nicht versagen. Allmählich kam eine Lust an diesen Übertreibungen in mich, denn wunderbar, wie diese Beschwichtigung wirkte. Jedesmal, wenn er mich gierig fragte: »Glauben Sie wirklich?« oder »Hat er das wirklich gesagt? Hat er das selber gesagt?« und ich in meiner Ungeduld und Schwäche alles leidenschaftlich bejahte, wurde der Druck seines angepreßten Körpers gleichsam leichter. Ich spürte, wie seine Sicherheit unter meinen Worten wuchs, und zum ersten-und letztenmal in meinem Leben ahnte ich in dieser Stunde etwas von der berauschenden Lust, die allem Schöpferischen innewohnt.","The wind hissed, hissed and jerked around us. But the old man didn't notice. There was no heaven for him and no clouds and no rain, there was only his child and his recovery on earth; How could I have brought myself to tell the man trembling with excitement and weakness the factual and truthful information, that Condor by no means felt secure in his cause? He needed something to cling to like before, sinking down, my helping arm. So I hastily gathered together what little promise of consolation I had laboriously wrested from Condor: I told him that Condor had heard of a new cure that Professor Viennot had tried out in France with great success. I immediately felt something rustling and stirring in the darkness next to me; his body, which had just been leaning limply, pushed closer, as if he wanted to warm himself against me. Actually I shouldn't have promised more now, but my pity tore me further than I could answer. Yes, this cure would have extraordinary success, I kept encouraging him over and over again, in four months, in three months quite surprising healings had been achieved and probably - no: even as much as certain it would not fail with Edith. Gradually I began to enjoy these exaggerations, because it was wonderful how this appeasement worked. Every time he asked me greedily, ""Do you really think so?"" or ""Did he really say that? Did he say that himself?' and in my impatience and weakness I passionately affirmed everything, the pressure of his pressed body eased, so to speak. I felt his confidence growing under my words, and for the first and last time in my life I had a glimpse of the intoxicating joy inherent in everything creative.","The wind roared, whistled and howled around us, but the old man never noticed. For him, the sky, the clouds, the rain did not exist, there was nothing on earth but his child and the hope of curing her. How could I have brought myself to tell him, shaking with agitation and weakness as he was, the bleak facts of the matter—how could I have said that Condor was by no means sure of the best course to take? He needed something to cling to, just as a moment ago, near collapse, he had clung to my arm as I helped him along. So I hastily resorted to the few comforting words that I had been able to extract with such difficulty from Condor. I told him that Condor had heard of a new course of treatment, one that Professor Viennot had tried out in Paris with great success. At once I heard rustling and sensed movement in the dark; Kekesfalva, who had just been leaning back, limp and exhausted, was moving closer as if to warm himself against me. I ought not to have promised him anything else now, but my pity led me to say more than I could answer for. Yes, indeed, I encouragingly told him again and again, this treatment had been very successful, it had achieved surprising results within three or four months, and probably—well, almost certainly—it would not fail with Edith. A certain pleasure in my own exaggeration came over me as I took in the miraculous effect of my reassurances. He kept avidly asking me, “Do you really think so?” or, “Did he really say that? Did he say it himself?” And in my impatience and weakness I fervently assured him that it was so, that was indeed what Condor had said. The weight of the old man as he leant on me became less. I felt his certainty growing as I talked, and for the first and last time in my life I guessed, in that hour, something of the intoxicating pleasure of creativity.","All around us the wind hissed, roared and spluttered. But the old man did not notice it. For him there was no sky and no wind and no rain — all that existed for him on this earth was his child and her recovery. How could I possibly have brought myself to report to him nothing but the blunt, naked truth, which was that Condor was as yet by no means certain of being able to effect a cure? He needed something, after all, to cling to, just as he had clung to my outstretched arm as he sank down on the bench. And so I hastily scraped together the few words of consolation that I had with difficulty wrung from Condor: I told him that Condor had heard of a new treatment which had been tried out with great success in France by Professor Viennot. Immediately I could feel a rustling and stirring at my side in the dark, and the body that but now had seemed lifeless and inert edged closer, as though to get warmth from mine. I ought really to have said nothing further at this stage, but my pity urged me further than I had any right to go. Yes, this treatment had been carried out in several cases with remarkable success, I said, encouraging him further and further; in three or four months quite astonishing cures had been effected, and probably, no, almost certainly, a cure would be effected in Edith’s case. Gradually a positive craving to exaggerate came over me, for it was wonderful to observe the effect of my reassuring words. Every time that he inquired avidly, ‘Do you really think so?’ or ‘Did he really say that? Did he really say that himself?’ and I in my impatience and weakness answered with an eager affirmative, the body that was pressed against mine seemed to grow lighter. I could feel the old man’s confidence increasing as I spoke, and for the first and last time in my life I had some inkling of the elation that accompanies all creative activity."
"»Nein« – (ich packe Ilona in meiner Verzweiflung am Arm) – »einen Augenblick noch, einen Augenblick … Sie müssen mich bei ihr entschuldigen.

You'll have to excuse me with her. I had no idea... I only saw her at the table, just for a second...

I couldn’t guess … I’d only seen her sitting at the dinner table, just for a second … please explain that …”","‘No!’ In my despair I seized Ilona by the arm. ‘Just a moment, just a moment ...

"Unserm Freund stockte der Fuß, stockte das Herz. Das war zu viel! Darauf war er nicht gefaßt gewesen.

But it really is odd, you must admit, very strange … you’ve been going to the house for some weeks, I hear. And you’re living in a small town, a kind of chicken coop full of cackling fowls at that, and you still think Kekesfalva is a great magnate.

"Jetzt erst begriff ich. Selbstverständlich war diese Begegnung im Dunkel kein Zufall. Hier im Park knapp vor dem Kaserneneingang hatte der Ungeduldige gewartet, um nur rasch Gewißheit zu haben, hier knapp vor dem Eingang, wo ich ihm nicht entgehen konnte, hatte er mir aufgelauert. Zwei Stunden, drei Stunden war er in fürchterlicher Ruhelosigkeit auf und ab gegangen, kärglich verborgen in dem Schatten dieses schäbigen Kleinstadtgärtchens, wo sich nachts sonst nur die Dienstmädchen mit ihren Liebhabern trafen. Wahrscheinlich hatte er vermutet, ich würde Condor bloß den kurzen Weg bis zum Bahnhof begleiten und gleich in die Kaserne heimkehren; ich aber hatte ahnungslos ihn hier warten, warten, warten lassen, die zwei oder drei Stunden lang, die ich unterdes mit jenem in der Weinstube gesessen, und der alte kranke Mann hatte gewartet wie einst auf seine Schuldner, zäh, geduldig, unnachgiebig. In dieser fanatischen Beharrlichkeit war etwas, das mich aufreizte und doch gleichzeitig rührte.","Only now did I understand. Of course, this encounter in the dark was no coincidence. Here in the park just before the entrance to the barracks the impatient man had waited, just to be sure quickly, here just before the entrance, where I couldn't escape him, he had ambushed me. For two hours, three hours he had been pacing in dreadful restlessness, scantily concealed in the shade of that shabby little town garden where at night only maids met their lovers. He probably assumed that I would only accompany Condor the short way to the train station and go straight home to the barracks; but I had unsuspectingly let him wait, wait, wait for the two or three hours that I had been sitting with him in the wine bar, and the sick old man had waited as he once did for his debtors, tenaciously, patiently, unyieldingly. There was something in that fanatical persistence that bothered me and moved me at the same time.","Only now did I understand. Of course this encounter in the dark was no accident. The old man had been waiting impatiently here in the little park just outside the barracks, wanting to know the answer for certain. He had been lying in wait for me at the entrance, where I couldn’t escape him. He must have been pacing up and down in terrible anxiety for two or three hours, poorly concealed in the shadows of this run-down little town park where maidservants waited at night to meet their lovers. He had probably assumed that I would only be going the short distance to the railway station with Condor, and then I would return to the barracks straight away. Guessing nothing of that, I had kept him waiting for the two or three hours that I had spent sitting in the wine bar with the doctor, and the sick old man had waited as he used to lie in wait for his debtors—tough, patient, unyielding. There was something about his fanatical persistence that both irritated and moved me.","And now at last I understood. This encounter in the dark was, of course, no accident. In his impatient longing for certainty the old man had waited, had lain in wait for me in the park just outside the entrance to the barracks, where he knew I could not escape him. For three whole hours he had paced up and down in a state of terrible anxiety, barely concealed in the shadow of the dingy little park, which, as a rule, was frequented at night only by servant girls meeting their lovers. Evidently he had assumed that I should accompany Condor the short distance to the station and then return immediately to barracks, whereas I had quite innocently let him wait, wait, wait for three whole hours while I had sat with the doctor in the wine-bar, and the ailing old man had waited, just as in the past he had waited for people who owed him money, stubbornly, patiently, relentlessly. There was something about this fanatical persistence that irritated and yet touched me."
"Mit offenen Augen starre ich ins Dunkel des fremden Raumes. Aber da abermals: Tok-tok – ein heftiges Pochen von hartem Knöchel. Nein, ich träume nicht mehr, jemand hat angeklopft. Jemand klopft von außen an meine Tür. Ich springe aus dem Bett und öffne hastig. Draußen steht der Nachtportier.","With open eyes I stare into the darkness of the strange room. But there again: Tok-tok - a violent throbbing from a hard knuckle. No, I'm not dreaming anymore, someone knocked. Someone is knocking on my door from outside. I jump out of bed and hastily open it. The night porter is outside.","I stare open-eyed into the darkness of the strange room. But there it is again—a tapping sound, knuckles knocking on wood.

"»Weißt, Hofmiller, ich hab dir ja nix dreinreden wollen – chacun à son goût! Aber wenn d’ mich ehrlich fragst, mir hat’s von Anfang an net g’fallen, wie ich g’hört hab, daß d’ allerweil bei die draußen steckst. Unsereins muß sich überlegen, wem man die Ehr antut, daß man bei ihm verkehrt. Was der für G’schäfte macht oder g’macht hat, davon weiß ich nix, und das geht mich nix an. Ich rechne niemandem was nach. Aber ein bissel muß unsereins Reserve halten – du siehst ja, auf ja und nein kommt ein blödes G’red zustand. Nur net rühren an Leut, die man net g’nau kennt.

But if you ask me honestly, I didn't like it from the start, as I've heard that you're always with the outsiders. The likes of us have to think about who we do the honor of associating with. I don't know what kind of business he does or has done, and that's none of my business. I don't count anyone. But we have to keep a little reserve - you see, yes and no result in a stupid G'red. Just don't touch people you don't really know. The likes of us must keep clean and always clean; you can get dirty just by touching it. Well, I'm glad you didn't let yourself in too much.""","“D’you know, Hofmiller, I didn’t like to say anything—chacun à son goût and all that. But if you really want to know, I didn’t much care for it when I heard how you kept going up there. We officers ought to be careful when we do someone the honour of calling on him. I don’t know much about the kind of business that fellow Kekesfalva did or does, nothing to do with me, and I don’t go around poking my nose into other people’s affairs. But we have to stand on our dignity a little— well, you see how easily talk starts going the rounds. We don’t want to mix with persons we don’t know. Our sort have to keep our hands clean, y’know—touch pitch and some of it will stick. I’m only glad you didn’t get drawn further in.”","‘I say, Hofmiller,’ he said, ‘I didn’t like to interfere — chacun à son goût! But if you want my frank opinion, from the start I wasn’t too pleased when I heard that you were spending so much time with those people. We officers have got to consider whom we’re honouring by going to their houses. What his business is, or was, I don’t know, and it’s not my affair. I don’t go about checking up on people. But we fellows must maintain a certain reserve — you can see for yourself, before you know where you are all sorts of gossip goes flying around. We simply can’t mix with people we don’t really know. We must keep our hands clean, always. You can’t touch pitch without being defiled. Well, I’m jolly glad you haven’t got yourself into a worse mess.’"
"»Bitte nehmen Sie’s dem Kind nicht übel, Herr Leutnant, wenn sie ein wenig brüsk war, aber … Sie wissen ja nicht, wie viel man sie gequält hat in all diesen Jahren … immer etwas anderes, und es geht so furchtbar langsam vorwärts, ich versteh ja, daß sie ungeduldig wird.

"Und »Ja, wunderschön ist es hier«, sage ich, sofort peinlich bewußt werdend, daß ich etwas beschämend Banales ausspreche, und stocke schon wieder. Um die Befangenheit zu lösen, beugt sich Kekesfalva über den Fauteuil.","And ""Yes, it's beautiful here,"" I say, immediately realizing with embarrassment that I'm saying something embarrassingly banal, and stop again. Kekesfalva bends over the armchair in order to relieve the embarrassment.","“Yes, it’s really beautiful up here,” I say, and instantly I am painfully aware of making a shockingly banal remark, and my voice falters again. To ease the general awkwardness, Kekesfalva leans over the wicker wheelchair.","‘Yes, it’s wonderful up here,’ I said, conscious as I spoke of the pitiful banality of my words, and then relapsed into silence. To hide his embarrassment, Kekesfalva bent over Edith’s chair."
"Und siehe, da saß ein Mädchen im Lehnstuhl, das ich kaum erkannte, so heiter blickte sie und solche Helligkeit ging von ihr aus. Sie trug ein zartblaues seidenes Kleid, das sie noch mädchenhafter, noch kindlicher erscheinen ließ. Im rötlichen Haar glänzten – waren es Myrten? – weiße Blüten, und um den Lehnstuhl gereiht standen – wer hatte sie ihr geschenkt? – Blumenkörbe, ein bunter Hain. Sie mußte längst gewußt haben, daß ich im Hause war; zweifellos hatte die Wartende das heitere Begrüßen vernommen und meinen nahenden Schritt. Aber vollkommen fehlte diesmal jener nervös prüfende, überwachende Blick, der sich sonst immer bei meinem Eintreten aus halb gedeckten Lidern mißtrauisch auf mich richtete. Leicht und aufrecht saß sie in ihrem Lehnstuhl; völlig vergaß ich diesmal, daß die Decke ein Gebrest verhüllte und der tiefe Fauteuil eigentlich ihr Kerker war, denn ich staunte nur über dies neue Mädchenwesen, das kindlicher in seiner Freude, fraulicher in seiner Schönheit schien. Sie bemerkte mein leises Überraschtsein und nahm es wie eine Gabe dar. Der alte Ton unserer unbesorgt-kameradschaftlichen Tage klang sofort auf, als sie mich einlud:","And behold, there was a girl sitting in the armchair, whom I hardly recognized, she looked so cheerful and radiated such brightness. She was wearing a delicate blue silk dress that made her appear even more girlish, more childlike. In the reddish hair glistened - was it myrtle? - white flowers, and lined up around the armchair - who had given them to her? – Flower baskets, a colorful grove. She must have known long ago that I was in the house; no doubt those waiting had heard the cheerful greeting and my approaching step. But this time there was a total lack of that nervous, scrutinizing, scrutinizing look that was usually directed at me suspiciously from half-covered eyelids when I entered. She sat light and upright in her armchair; This time I completely forgot that the blanket was hiding a corpse and that the deep armchair was actually her dungeon, because I was amazed at this new girl, who seemed more childlike in her joy, more womanly in her beauty. She noticed my faint surprise and accepted it as a gift. The old tone of our carefree-comradely days rang out as soon as she invited me:","And there in her easy chair sat a girl whom I hardly recognised, she looked so bright and happy. She was wearing a pale-blue silk dress that made her seem even more girlish, more childlike, there were white flowers in her pale-red hair—were they myrtle?—and around her chair stood a colourful array of baskets of flowers (I wondered who had given them to her). She must have known for some time that I was in the house; no doubt, as she waited, she had heard the cheerful greetings and my approaching footsteps. But today there was none of that nervously probing, watchful expression in her eyes, the look that had recently been turned distrustfully on me from under her lowered lids when I came in. She was sitting relaxed and erect in her chair, and today I quite forgot that the rug on her lap concealed an infirmity, and the easy chair was really her dungeon, for I was so amazed by this new girlish creature. She seemed more childlike in her joy, but more womanly in her beauty. She noticed my surprise, and took it as a gift. The old tone of our carefree friendly conversations was struck as soon as she invited me in.","And behold, there sat a girl in a chaise-longue whom I scarcely recognized, so gaily did she look up, such brightness emanated from her. She was wearing a dress of pale blue silk which made her look more girlish, more childish than ever. In her auburn hair gleamed white blossoms — were they myrtle? — and arranged round her chair were baskets of flowers, a gaily coloured hedge. She must long since have known that I was in the house, and had doubtless heard the delighted greetings of the others and my approaching footsteps. But this time there was no sign as I entered the room of that restless, inquisitorial gaze which was usually directed at me out of half-closed, suspicious lids. She sat there graceful and upright; and now I completely forgot that the rug concealed a deformity, and that the deep chaise-longue was actually her prison. I could do nothing but marvel at this new girlish creature, who seemed more childish than ever in her joy, yet more womanly in her beauty. She noticed my faint astonishment and accepted it as a gift."
"Mit einem großen, langen Schluck leerte er das Glas und begann dann, von der rasch servierten Platte sich kräftige Stücke auf den Teller holend, langsam und behaglich zu kauen. Da er unser Vorhandensein überhaupt nicht zu bemerken schien, blieb mir Zeit, den Schmausenden von der Seite her zu beobachten. Enttäuscht konstatierte ich an diesem so begeistert gerühmten Manne das bürgerlichste, behäbigste Gesicht, vollmondrundlich und von kleinen Grübchen und Pusteln durchkratert, kartofflig die Nase, verschwommen das Kinn, rötlich und von starker Bartspur beschattet die Backen, kuglig und kurz der Hals – ganz und gar das, was die Wiener dialektisch einen »Sumper« nennen, einen gutmütig, brummligen Genießer. Genau so behaglich saß und aß er auch, die Weste verknüllt und halb aufgeknöpft; allmählich bekam die beharrliche Behäbigkeit, mit der er kaute, etwas Aufreizendes für mich – mag sein, weil ich mich erinnerte, wie zuvorkommend höflich an dem gleichen Tisch der Oberstleutnant und jener Fabrikant mich behandelt hatten, vielleicht aber auch, weil ich ein gewisses Bedenken empfand, ob man einem so opulenten Schmauser und Trinker, der immer den Wein erst gegen das Licht hob, ehe er ihn mit schmatzigen Lippen ankostete, eine präzise Antwort auf eine derart vertrauliche Anfrage würde entlocken können.","He emptied the glass in one long, long gulp and then began to chew slowly and comfortably, taking hearty chunks from the quickly served platter onto the plate. Since he didn't seem to notice our presence at all, I had time to watch the feaster from the side. Disappointed, I noticed that this man, who was praised so enthusiastically, had the most bourgeois, portly face, round with a full moon and cratered with small dimples and pustules, the nose like potatoes, the chin blurred, the cheeks reddish and heavily shadowed by a beard, the neck rounded and short – completely what the Viennese dialectically call a »Sumper«, a good-natured, grumpy epicure. He sat and ate just as comfortably, his waistcoat rumpled and half unbuttoned; gradually the insistent slow-moving with which he chewed became something irritating to me-maybe because I remembered how courteous the lieutenant-colonel and that factory owner had been at the same table, but maybe because I felt a certain hesitancy whether one could elicit a precise answer to such a confidential inquiry from such an opulent feaster and drinker, who always lifted the wine up to the light before tasting it with smacking lips.","Emptying the glass of beer at a single draught, he began helping himself lavishly from the dish quickly served up, and then slowly munched with relish. As he seemed to be ignoring the rest of us, I had plenty of time to observe him from one side as he feasted. Disappointed, I saw that this man, so enthusiastically praised to me, had the most ordinary, fleshy face imaginable, like a full moon pitted with little dimples and craters, a potato-shaped nose, a double chin, ruddy cheeks with a dark five o’clock shadow, a short, thick neck—exactly the sort of man known in Viennese dialect as a Sumper, a jovial, outspoken bon viveur. He sat there eating at his leisure in exactly the Sumper way, his waistcoat creased and half unbuttoned, and gradually the ponderous persistence of his munching came to irritate me—perhaps because I remembered how very civil to me the Lieutenant Colonel and the sugar manufacturer had been at this same table, or perhaps because I rather doubted whether a man who ate and drank so copiously, holding his wine up to the light before gulping it and smacking his lips, would be able to give me a precise answer to such a discreet question as I had to ask.","He emptied his glass at a draught and then, helping himself to an enormous portion of the dish that was quickly offered him, he fell to in leisurely and comfortable fashion. Since he appeared to be entirely oblivious of our presence, I had ample opportunity of observing this gourmand in profile. I discovered, to my great disappointment, that this man who had been so enthusiastically held up to my admiration had the most bourgeois, homely features imaginable: a full moon of a face, pitted with little holes and disfigured with pimples, a bottle nose, a nebulous chin, reddish cheeks covered with a strong stubble of beard, a short bull neck — in fact, everything that went to make up what is known in Viennese dialect as a ‘Sumper’ — a good-natured, roistering sort of fellow, without a thought above eating and drinking. As he sat there comfortably eating away, his waistcoat crumpled and half-unbuttoned, he looked the part to the life. Gradually the indefatigable gusto with which he chewed away began to get on my nerves — it may have been because I remembered the courteous and polite way in which I had been treated at this very same table by the Colonel and the factory owner, perhaps also because I felt somewhat doubtful of ever being able to extract from this glutton, who held his glass of wine up to the light before rolling it over on his tongue, a precise answer to the kind of intimate question I had to ask."
"›Nein, nein‹, wehrte er ganz betroffen ab, ›nichts, gar nichts schulden Sie mir‹, und er spürte zugleich, wie ihm der Schweiß aus den Poren brach. Ihm, der alles vorausberechnete, der seit Jahren gelernt hatte, jede Reaktion im vorhinein durchzukalkulieren, war etwas völlig Neues geschehen. Er hatte in seinen bitteren Agentenjahren erlebt, daß man die Türen vor ihm zuwarf, daß man seinen Gruß nicht erwiderte, und es gab manche Gassen in seinem Rayon, die er lieber vermied. Aber daß jemand ihm noch dankte – dies war ihm noch niemals geschehen. Und vor diesem ersten Menschen, der ihm trotz allem, trotz allem vertraute, schämte er sich. Wider seinen Willen fühlte er das Bedürfnis, sich zu entschuldigen.","'No, no,' he said, quite taken aback, 'you owe me nothing, nothing at all', and at the same time he felt sweat breaking out of his pores. Something completely new had happened to him, who calculated everything in advance, who had learned over the years to calculate every reaction in advance. During his bitter years as an agent, he had seen doors slammed in his face, his greetings ignored, and there were many streets in his district that he preferred to avoid. But that someone thanked him - this had never happened to him before. And in front of this first person who trusted him in spite of everything, in spite of everything, he was ashamed. Against his will, he felt the need to apologize.","“‘No, no,’ he protested, dismayed. ‘You owe me nothing, nothing at all.’ And at the same time he felt sweat breaking out of every pore. He thought he was ready for anything, he had learnt, years ago, to calculate every reaction in advance, and now something entirely new had happened to him. In his hard years working as an agent he had had doors slammed in his face, he had known people who wouldn’t return his greeting, and there were some streets in the district where he operated that he preferred to avoid. But for someone he had tricked to thank him for it too—that had never happened before. And he felt ashamed in front of this first human being who trusted him in spite of everything, in spite of all he had done. Against his own will, he felt an urge to apologise.","‘No, no,’ he protested in genuine dismay, ‘you owe me nothing, nothing at all.’ And he could feel the sweat breaking out all over him. To him, to this man who always foresaw everything, who for years had learned to be prepared for every reaction on the part of a client, this was an entirely novel experience. During the hard years when he had been a little agent doors had been shut in his face, people had turned their backs on him, and there had been streets in his district which he had preferred to avoid. But that someone should actually thank him — that had never yet happened to him. And he felt ashamed in the presence of this, the first person to trust, to go on trusting him. He felt constrained to make excuses."
»Aber was haben Sie denn? Sie zittern ja … Was … was erregt Sie denn so? … Was geht Sie denn das alles an?«,"""But what's the matter with you? You're trembling... What... what excites you so much? . . . what business is it of yours?”","However, she must have noticed my obvious clumsiness, shaken as I was, for now she asks me, quietly, in a very different, an amazed and concerned voice, “Oh, what’s the matter? You are trembling. What … what has upset you? What is it?”",‘Whatever is the matter with you? You’re trembling.... What ... what is upsetting you so? ... What is all this to you?’

"Nie in meinem Leben habe ich – ich muß es wiederholen – irgend etwas klarer, präziser, exakter disponiert als damals meinen Tod. Übersichtlich wie in einer Registratur war alles zurechtgelegt, Minute für Minute eingeteilt, als ich nach einer Stunde scheinbar ziellosen Herumirrens vor der Kaserne anlangte. Mein Schritt war die ganze Zeit über vollkommen ruhig, mein Puls ebenmäßig gegangen, und wie sicher meine Hand geblieben, merkte ich mit einem gewissen Stolz, als ich nun den Schlüssel ins Schloß der kleinen Seitentür steckte, die wir Offiziere nach Mitternacht immer benützten. Nicht um einen Zoll verfehlte ich selbst im Dunkel die schmale Öffnung. Jetzt noch den Hof überqueren und die drei Treppen hinauf! Dann bin ich mit mir allein und kann anfangen und enden zugleich. Doch da ich mich vom mondhellen Geviert des Hofs dem Torschatten der Treppe nähere, regt sich dort eine Gestalt. Verdammt, denke ich mir: irgendein heimkehrender Kamerad, der, knapp vor mir gekommen, mich noch begrüßen und am Ende lang herumschwatzen will! Im nächsten Augenblick aber erkenne ich, peinlichst berührt, an den breiten Schultern den Oberst Bubencic, der mich erst vor wenigen Tagen angepfiffen hat. Mit Absicht scheint er im Torbogen stehengeblieben zu sein; ich weiß, dieser Kommißknopf sieht’s nicht gern, wenn unsere Leute spät nach Hause kommen. Aber zum Teufel, was geht das alles mich noch an! Morgen stehe ich vor jemand ganz anderm beim Rapport. So will ich mit einer verbissenen Entschlossenheit, als ob ich ihn nicht bemerkte, weiter, doch schon tritt er aus dem Schatten heraus. Scharf stößt seine knarrige Stimme auf mich zu:","Never in my life have I - I have to repeat it - planned anything more clearly, more precisely, more exactly than I did when I died. Everything was laid out clearly, like in a registry, divided up minute by minute when, after an hour of seemingly aimless wandering, I arrived in front of the barracks. My step was perfectly calm the whole time, my pulse was even, and I noted with a certain pride how secure my hand remained as I put the key in the lock of the small side door, which we officers always used after midnight. I didn't miss the narrow opening by an inch, even in the dark. Now cross the courtyard and up the three flights of stairs! Then I'm alone with myself and can start and end at the same time. But as I approach the shadow of the gate of the staircase from the moonlit square of the courtyard, a figure stirs there. Damn it, I think to myself: some comrade coming home who, just ahead of me, still wants to greet me and end up chatting around for a long time! The next moment, however, I recognize, embarrassed, by the broad shoulders of Colonel Bubencic, who whistled at me only a few days ago. He seems to have stopped in the archway on purpose; I know that clerk doesn't like it when our people come home late. But what the hell is it to me? Tomorrow I'll be standing in front of someone completely different at the report. So I want to go on with a dogged determination, as if I didn't notice him, but he steps out of the shadows. His creaky voice comes sharply towards me:","Never in my life, I must repeat, have I done anything more clearly, precisely and exactly than in making these arrangements for my death. By the time I reach the barracks after an hour of apparently aimless wandering, I have the list all worked out in my head, minute by minute. My steps have been steady all that time, my pulse regular, and with a touch of pride I notice how steady my hand is as I put the key into the keyhole of the little side door that we officers always used after midnight. I haven’t missed the tiny opening by so much as a fraction of an inch. Now to cross the yard and climb the three flights of stairs. Then I will be alone, I can begin what I have to do and at the same time put an end to it all. But as I approach the shadow of the gateway across the moonlit quad, I see a figure moving. Damn it all, I think, one of my comrades coming back and getting in just before me. He’ll want to say good evening and maybe have a long chat. Next moment, however, I am irritated to recognise, from the broad shoulders, that it is Colonel Bubencic. Colonel Bubencic, who bawled me out only a few days ago. He seems to be waiting in the gateway on purpose. I know the old boy doesn’t like his officers coming in late. But what the hell? That’s no business of mine. Tomorrow I’ll be reporting to a very different authority. So I walk on with grim determination, pretending not to have noticed him. However, he is already stepping out of the shadows. He growls sharply at me, “Lieutenant Hofmiller!”","Never in my life — I must repeat — had I made clearer, more precise, more exact arrangements for anything than I did that night for my death. When, after an hour of apparently aimless wandering, I arrived outside the barracks, the whole programme was worked out in my mind, minute by minute, with all the precision of an official instruction. My step during the whole of that time was unhurried, my pulse regular, and I noticed with a certain pride how steady my hand was when I put the key into the lock of the little side-door which we officers always used after midnight. Even in the darkness I did not miss the little opening by a single inch. Now all I had to do was to cross the courtyard and climb three flights of stairs. Then I should be alone with myself, and could begin — and end — everything. But as I approached the dark entrance from the moonlit quadrangle a figure moved in the doorway. Confound it! I thought. One of the fellows getting back just before me; he’ll buttonhole me and keep me talking for God knows how long! The next moment, however, to my extreme discomfiture, I recognized the broad shoulders of Colonel Bubencic, my commanding officer, who had given me such a dressing-down only a few days before. He seemed deliberately to have stationed himself in the doorway; I knew that the old martinet did not care to see us subalterns arriving back late. But hell, what did it matter to me now! I should be reporting to Someone very different tomorrow. And so I was about to go doggedly on my way, as though I had not noticed him, when he stepped forward out of the shadow. His grating voice pulled me up sharply."

"›Wollen Sie nicht Platz nehmen?‹ sagte sie in ihrer Verwirrung, und ungeschickt setzte sich Kanitz ihr gegenüber.","""Wouldn't you like to sit down?"" she said in her confusion, and Kanitz awkwardly sat down opposite her.","“‘Won’t you sit down?’ she asked in her confusion, and Kanitz awkwardly sat down opposite her.","‘Won’t you sit down?’ she said in her confusion, and Kanitz sat down awkwardly opposite her."
"»Und du, Ferencz«, antworte ich, mich zu einem Lachen zwingend, »wirst gütigst erlauben, daß ich einmal Schädelweh hab und mich nicht extra fühl.«","""And you, Ferencz,"" I reply, forcing myself to laugh, ""will graciously allow my head to ache for once and not feel extra.""","“And I suppose you’ll admit, Ferencz,” I reply, forcing a smile, “that I can have a headache once in a while and feel, well, not too good.”","‘And you, Ferencz,’ I said, forcing a laugh, ‘will perhaps kindly allow me to have a splitting headache and to feel out of sorts once in a while.’ ‘Oh, sorry, Toni!’"
"In diesem Augenblick flirrt hinter uns ein leises Surren. Es ist der Lift, der zu unserer Terrasse herauffährt. Johann öffnet den Verschlag, und heraus tritt Kekesfalva mit jener schuldbewußten, scheuen Art, die ihm unsinnigerweise immer die Schultern niederdrückt, sobald er sich der Kranken nähert.","At this moment, a soft buzzing shimmers behind us. It's the lift that goes up to our terrace. Johann opens the closet, and Kekesfalva comes out with that guilty, shy manner that absurdly always weighs down his shoulders as soon as he approaches the patient.","At that moment I hear a slight humming sound behind us. It is the lift coming up to the roof terrace. Josef opens it and out steps Kekesfalva with the shy, somehow guilty manner","At that moment there was a faint droning noise behind us. It was the lift, on its way up to the terrace. Josef opened the gate, and Kekesfalva stepped out with that guilty, shy air of his, that droop of the shoulders that for some reason was always more noticeable whenever he approached his crippled daughter."
"Ich will nicht zu weitschweifig werden und kürze lieber die Einzelheiten. Nur das will ich Ihnen verraten, daß diese Stunden die gespanntesten, die erregtesten seines Lebens wurden. Überdenken Sie selbst die Situation: einem Menschen, bisher bloß ein mittlerer Agent, ein obskurer Geschäftemacher, saust plötzlich die Chance wie ein Meteor aus dem Himmel zu, über Nacht ein schwerreicher Mann zu werden. Er konnte innerhalb von vierundzwanzig Stunden mehr verdienen als bisher in vierundzwanzig Jahren aufopferndster, kläglichster Kleinschacherei und – ungeheure Verlockung – er brauchte dem Opfer gar nicht nachzulaufen, es nicht zu fesseln, nicht zu betäuben – im Gegenteil, das Opfer ging ihm freiwillig in die Schlinge, es leckte geradezu noch die Hand, die schon das Messer hielt. Die einzige Gefahr bestand darin, daß jemand anderer ihm dazwischenkäme. Darum durfte er die Erbin nicht einen Augenblick lang aus der Hand lassen, ihr nicht Zeit lassen. Er mußte sie fortschleppen von Kekesfalva, ehe der Verwalter zurückkam, und durfte doch während all dieser Vorsichtsmaßnahmen in keiner Sekunde verraten, daß er selbst ein Interesse an dem Verkauf hatte.","I don't want to get too long and prefer to cut down on the details. All I want to tell you is that these hours were the most tense, the most exciting of his life. Think about the situation for yourself: a person, previously just a middle agent, an obscure profiteer, suddenly has the chance to become a very rich man overnight like a meteor out of the sky. Within twenty-four hours he was able to earn more than he had previously in twenty-four years of self-sacrificing, pathetic petty haggling and - tremendous temptation - he didn't have to run after the victim, neither tie him up nor stun him - on the contrary, the victim went into his noose voluntarily , it practically licked the hand that was already holding the knife. The only danger was that someone else would intervene. That's why he couldn't let the heiress out of his hands for a moment, he couldn't give her time. He had to drag her away from Kekesfalva before the steward returned, and during all these precautions he was not allowed to reveal for a second that he himself had an interest in the sale.","“I don’t want to go into it at too much length, I’d rather summarise the details. But I will tell you this—those hours were to be the most moving and disturbing of his life. Think about it —here’s a man who has been only an ordinary sort of agent so far, an obscure fixer of this and that, and suddenly the chance of becoming rich overnight drops into his lap like a meteor falling from the sky. He could earn more within the next twenty-four hours than he had earned in twenty-four years of petty bargaining, devoting himself entirely to his work—and there was another, extraordinary temptation too. He didn’t have to pursue, confine or drug his victim to make her go to her fate—on the contrary, the sacrifice went willingly to the slaughter, actually licked the hand already holding the knife. The one danger was that someone else might step in to stop him. So he couldn’t let the heiress out of his power for a moment, couldn’t give her time to think. He had to get her away from Kekesfalva before Petrovic the manager came back, and while he was taking all these precautions he must not for a moment let her know that he himself had an interest in buying the estate.","I don’t want to spin out my story more than necessary, and I’ll skip some of the details. I will merely tell you that the hours that followed were the most tense, the most agitated, of his whole life. Just picture the situation to yourself: here you have a man who has hitherto been merely an insignificant little agent, an obscure dealer, and suddenly an opportunity to become immensely rich comes whirling his way like a meteor out of the sky. Within the space of twenty-four hours he would be able to earn more than he had earned hitherto in twenty-four years of the most exacting toil, the most wretched huckstering, and — tremendous temptation! — there was no need for him even to run after this victim, to captivate her, to bemuse her; on the contrary, his victim was walking of her own free will into his toils, she was positively licking the hand that held the knife. The only danger lay in the fact that someone else might intervene. Hence he dared not let the heiress slip from his grasp for a single instant, dared not give her time to think. He would have to get her away from Kekesfalva before Petrovic returned, and while taking these precautionary measures he must not for one instant betray the fact that he himself was interested in the sale of the estate."
"Nur einmal kam das Erinnern vom andern Ufer zurück. Ich saß im Parterre der Wiener Oper auf einem Ecksitz der letzten Reihe, um wieder einmal den Gluck’schen »Orpheus« zu hören, dessen reine und verhaltene Schwermut mich mehr als jede andere Musik ergreift. Eben endete die Ouvertüre, man erhellte in der knappen Pause nicht den verdunkelten Saal, ließ aber einigen Nachzüglern noch Gelegenheit, sich im Dunkel auf ihre Plätze zu begeben. Auch zu meiner Reihe schatteten zwei dieser Spätkömmlinge, ein Herr und eine Dame.","Only once did memory come back from the other bank. I sat on the ground floor of the Vienna Opera in a corner seat from the back row to hear once again Gluck's Orpheus, whose pure and restrained melancholy moves me more than any other music. The overture has just ended, the darkened hall was not lit up during the brief interval, but a few latecomers were given the opportunity to go to their seats in the dark. Also to my rank shadowed two of these latecomers, a gentleman and a lady.","Only once did a memory come back to me from the opposite bank of the river of Lethe. I was sitting in the stalls of the Opera House in Vienna, in a seat at the end of a row, to hear Gluck’s Orpheus again; its pure, restrained melancholy moves me more than any other music. The overture was just ending, the lights in the dimmed auditorium did not go up in the brief pause which gave a few late arrivals a chance to take their seats in the dark. Two of these latecomers, a lady and a gentlemen, cast their shadows on my own row.","Only once did a reminder come to me from the other shore. I was sitting in the Vienna Opera House, in a corner seat of the last row of the stalls, listening to Gluck’s Orphée, the pure and restrained melancholy of which grips me more than any other music. The overture had just ended, and although the house lights did not go up for the brief interval, one or two stragglers were given an opportunity of finding their way in the dark to their seats. Two of these late-comers, a lady and a gentleman, hovered dimly at the end of my row."

I'm afraid - pardon my immodesty - your husband is showing too much of himself.'","“You were perfectly right, ma’am, and indeed you should have spoken to me more sternly. I’m afraid—forgive me for speaking frankly —I’m afraid your husband gives too much of himself to his patients.”","‘You were quite right, gnädige Frau, and you should be even firmer.

"Ich weiß heute, daß es dumm, daß es verbrecherisch von mir war, mich dermaßen von meiner Bitterkeit hinreißen zu lassen. Wie sollte ein siebzehnjähriges Kind, verwöhnt und weltfremd auferzogen, wie sollte diese Gelähmte, ständig an ihr Zimmer gefesselt, etwas von Geldwert und Gage und unserem glänzenden Elend ahnen? Aber die Lust, mich für zahllose kleine Erniedrigungen einmal an jemandem zu rächen, hatte mich gleichsam hinterrücks angefallen, und ich drosch zu, blindlings, besinnungslos, wie man immer im Zorn zuschlägt, ohne die Wucht des Hiebs in der eigenen Hand zu fühlen.","Today I know that it was stupid, that it was criminal of me to allow myself to be so carried away by my bitterness. How could a seventeen-year-old child, brought up spoiled and unworldly, how could this paralytic, constantly chained to her room, have any inkling of the value of money and our wages and our glittering misery? But the desire to take revenge on someone for countless little humiliations had attacked me from behind, so to speak, and I struck, blindly, senseless, as one always strikes in anger, without feeling the force of the blow in my own hand.","I know today that it was stupid, indeed criminally stupid of me to let myself be provoked into expressing so much of my bitterness. How was a child of seventeen, spoilt and brought up in isolation from the real world, how was a lame girl always tied to her room to know anything about the value of money, and a soldier’s pay, and the wonderful poverty in which we young officers lived? But the urge to revenge myself on someone for countless little humiliations, just for once, had somehow crept up on me, and I struck out blindly, mindlessly, without letting my own hand feel the force of the blow it inflicted.","I know now that it was stupid, criminal of me, to let myself be so carried away by my bitter feelings.

"»Wissen Sie, eigentlich haben Sie recht, Edith«, sagte ich so warmherzig, als es mir mit hämmerndem Herzen möglich war. »Einen guten Gesellschafter kriegt’s ihr wirklich nicht an mir, wenn ich dermaßen abgeschunden herauskomm; die ganze Zeit spür ich’s selber, daß ich Sie heute gründlich angeödet hab! Aber Sie sollten die paar Tage auch mit einem so abgerackerten Kerl vorliebnehmen. Wie lang wird’s denn noch sein, daß ich zu euch kommen darf? Auf ja und nein wird das Haus leer sein und ihr alle fort. Ich kann’s mir noch gar nicht ausdenken, daß wir im ganzen nur mehr vier Tage zusammen sein sollen, vier Tage oder eigentlich nur dreieinhalb Tage, ehe ihr …«","""You know, you're actually right, Edith,"" I said as warmly as my heart was pounding. 'You really don't get good companions from me when I come out so worn out; all the time I feel it myself that today I thoroughly bored you!

I can't even imagine that we're only supposed to be together for four more days altogether, four days, or actually only three and a half days before you—""","“I think you may be right, Edith,” I said, as warmly as my thudding heart would allow. “I’m not very good company for anyone just now, not when I’m worn down like this. I’ve felt myself that you were bored all afternoon today! You shouldn’t have a tedious fellow like me descending on you. But how long before I can come and see you here again? Pretty soon the house will be empty and you’ll all be away. I can hardly imagine it—we can be together again for only four days in all, or strictly speaking three and a half days, before you …”","‘Do you know, I really think you’re right, Edith,’ I said as cordially as my hammering heart would permit me. ‘When I turn up so dog-tired I’m really not awfully good company. I’ve been feeling the whole time today that I’ve been boring you stiff. But you should be able to put up with a poor fagged-out fellow for a few days. After all, I shan’t be able to come to see you much longer. The house will be empty very soon and you’ll all be gone. I simply can’t believe that we’ve only got four more days — four, or rather three and a half, before you ...’"
"Auf alles war ich gefaßt gewesen, nur nicht auf diese Frage. In meiner Verblüffung stammelte ich, um Zeit zu gewinnen, ein vorbereitendes:","I had been prepared for anything but this question.

"Aber noch immer hatte sich das Füllhorn der Überraschungen nicht völlig ausgestreut. Angelockt von dem verschwenderischen Geschenk an die Braut, hatte sich eine jener alten Zigeunerinnen, wie sie bei solchen Festen niemals fehlen, zur Estrade hinaufgedrängt und redete Edith heftigst zu, sich aus der Hand wahrsagen zu lassen. Diese zeigte sich sichtlich geniert. Einerseits ehrlich neugierig, schämte sie sich andererseits, in Gegenwart so vieler Zuschauer solchem Hokuspokus nachzugeben. Ich schaffte rasch Rat, indem ich Herrn von Kekesfalva und alle andern sanft von der Estrade wegdrängte, damit niemand etwas von den geheimnisvollen Prophezeiungen erlauschen könne, und den Neugierigen blieb nichts übrig, als von ferne lachend zuzuschauen, wie mit manchem Abrakadabra die hingekniete Alte Ediths Hand nahm und studierte; jeder in Ungarn kennt ja den ewigen Trick dieser Weiber zur Genüge, jedem das Allererfreulichste zu künden, um dann an der guten Botschaft kräftig zu profitieren. Aber zu meinem Erstaunen schien Edith alles, was die krumme Person ihr mit rauher und eilfertiger Stimme zuflüsterte, merkwürdig zu erregen. Jenes Zittern um ihre Nasenflügel begann, das bei ihr heftige Anspannung unvermeidlich begleitete. Immer tiefer sich niederbeugend, horchte sie hin, manchmal sich ängstlich umschauend, ob nicht jemand mitlausche; dann winkte sie ihren Vater heran, flüsterte ihm etwas befehlend zu, worauf er, gefügig wie immer, in die Brusttasche griff und der Zigeunerin einige Noten zusteckte. Der Betrag mußte nach dörflichen Begriffen ein unermeßlich großer gewesen sein, denn das alte gierige Weib fiel wie hingemäht in die Knie, küßte, einer Besessenen gleich, Edith den Rocksaum und strich mit unverständlichen Beschwörungen immer hastiger über die lahmen Füße hin. Dann sprang sie mit einem Ruck weg, als hätte sie Angst, jemand könnte ihr das viele Geld wieder abnehmen.","But the cornucopia of surprises had still not been fully dispersed. Lured by the lavish present for the bride, one of those old gypsy women, who are always to be found at such festivals, had pushed her way up to the dais and was vehemently persuading Edith to have her fortune told. This was visibly embarrassed. On the one hand genuinely curious, on the other hand ashamed to indulge in such mumbo-jumbo in the presence of so many spectators. I got advice quickly by gently pushing Herr von Kekesfalva and all the others away from the dais, so that no one could overhear the mysterious prophecies, and the curious could do nothing but watch from afar, laughing, like Old Ediths kneeling down with many an abracadabra hand took and studied; everyone in Hungary knows well enough the eternal trick of these women, to tell everyone the very best, in order to then benefit greatly from the good news. But to my astonishment, whatever the crooked person whispered to her in a hoarse and hasty voice, Edith seemed strangely aroused. The trembling around her nostrils began that inevitably accompanied intense tension. Bending down ever lower, she listened, sometimes looking around anxiously to see if anyone was listening; then she beckoned to her father and whispered something commandingly to him, whereupon he, docile as ever, reached into his breast pocket and slipped the gypsy some notes. According to village standards, the sum must have been immeasurably large, for the greedy old woman fell to her knees as if mown, kissed the hem of Edith's skirt like a possessed woman, and stroked her lame feet more and more hastily with incomprehensible incantations. Then she jumped away with a jerk, as if afraid someone might take all the money away from her.","But the cornucopia of surprises wasn’t empty yet. Attracted to us by the handsome present of that ring to the bride, one of those old Gypsy women who are sure to be found at such festivities made her way up to the table and offered, volubly, to read Edith’s palm for her. Edith was clearly in some difficulty. On the one hand she was genuinely curious, on the other she was ashamed to give way to such mumbo-jumbo in front of so many spectators. I quickly intervened, gently persuading Herr von Kekesfalva and the rest of our party to move away from the table raised on its platform so that no one could overhear the woman’s mysterious prophecies, and anyone interested had no option but to watch from a distance, smiling, as the old Gypsy knelt down, with much incomprehensible muttering, took Edith’s hand and studied it. Everyone in Hungary knows the old trick practised by such women, who give their customers only good tidings so as to profit by the news. But to my surprise Edith seemed strangely agitated by everything the bent old woman said in her hoarse, rapid whisper; I saw her nostrils begin to quiver in the way that always indicated strong emotion in her. Bending lower and lower, she listened, sometimes glancing around to see whether anyone could overhear. Then she beckoned her father over, whispered something to him in imperious tones, and he, as usual doing what she wanted, put his hand into his breast pocket and brought out several banknotes, which he gave to the old woman. The sum must have been enormous by the standards of this village, for the greedy old woman fell on her knees, kissed the hem of Edith’s skirt, and stroked her lame feet faster and faster, murmuring strange invocations. Then she suddenly jumped up as if afraid that someone might take all that money away from her.","But the cornucopia of surprises had not yet been emptied of its contents. Tempted by Edith’s extravagant present to the bride, one of those old gypsy women who are never absent from such festivals had pushed her way on to the dais and was using all her arts to wheedle Edith into having her fortune told. Edith was visibly disturbed. Genuinely curious on the one hand, she was on the other hand ashamed of lending herself to such quackery in the presence of so many spectators. I quickly stepped into the breach by gently edging Herr von Kekesfalva and the others away from the dais, so that no one should overhear a word of the old woman’s mysterious predictions, and the curious were reduced to looking on in amusement from a distance as the old woman, mumbling all kinds of gibberish, knelt before Edith and studied her hand. Everyone in Hungary is only too familiar with these old wives’ age-old dodge of telling their clients the most agreeable things possible about their future, so as to reap a rich reward as the bearers of good tidings. But to my astonishment what the old crone whispered to Edith in wheezy, insistent tones seemed to throw the young girl into an extraordinary state of agitation. That twitching at the nostrils began which was the inevitable precursor of violent emotion. Bending down lower and lower, she listened intently, now and again looking round anxiously to make sure that no one was listening. At last she beckoned her father to come to her, and whispered something imperiously in his ear, whereupon, compliant as ever, he felt in his breast-pocket and handed the old gypsy a bundle of notes. The amount must, according to village notions, have been simply terrific, for the greedy old woman fell on her knees as though mown to the ground, kissed the hem of Edith’s skirt like one possessed, and with incomprehensible mutterings and mumblings feverishly stroked the crippled girl’s feet. Then she bounded away as though afraid the money might be taken back again."
"»Es wäre wirklich nicht wahr, Herr von Kekesfalva, ich schwöre es Ihnen … und nichts wäre mir so schrecklich, als Ihre Tochter, als Edith zu … kränken oder … oder in ihr das Gefühl aufkommen zu lassen, ich hätte sie nicht aufrichtig gern … niemand empfindet doch herzlicher für sie, ich schwöre es Ihnen, niemand kann sie lieber haben als ich … es ist wirklich nur ein Wahn von ihr, daß … sie mir gleichgültig ist … im Gegenteil … im Gegenteil … ich meinte doch bloß, es hätte keinen Sinn, wenn ich jetzt … wenn ich heute etwas sagte … zunächst ist nur eines wichtig … daß sie sich schont … daß sie wirklich geheilt wird!«","'It really wouldn't be true, Herr von Kekesfalva, I swear to you... and nothing would be more dreadful to me than to... hurt your daughter, as Edith, or... or make her feel like I didn't really like her... nobody feels more warmly for her, I swear to you, nobody can love her better than I do...it's really just a delusion on her part that...I don't care about her...on the contrary...on the contrary...I just thought it wasn't Sinn, if I now ... if I said something today ... first of all, only one thing is important ... that she takes it easy ... that she really gets healed!""","“It really wouldn’t be quite true, Herr von Kekesfalva, I swear … and nothing would be worse for me than to think I had offended your daughter, I’d hurt Edith’s feelings … or … or made her feel I didn’t really like her. No one has warmer feelings for her, I assure you, no one can like her better than I do … it’s really just her imagination that … that I’m indifferent to her … on the contrary, on the contrary … I only mean there’d be no sense if just now I were to … if I said anything today. What’s most important is for her to spare herself … so that she really will get better!”","‘It really wouldn’t be true, Herr von Kekesfalva, I swear to you ... and nothing would distress me more than to insult your daughter Edith or ... or to let her think that I was not genuinely fond of her ... No one has warmer feelings for her than I have, I swear to you, no one could have more affection for her than I have. It’s really a delusion on her part to think that ... she means nothing to me ... On the contrary ... on the contrary ... I only meant that there would be no point in my ... in my saying anything now ... The only thing that matters at the moment is that she should take care of herself ... that she should really be cured.’"
"Ich ging die paar Schritte hinaus in den Vorraum, wo der Diener mit Kappe und Säbel schon bereitstand. Aber wäre ich nur rascher gegangen! Wäre ich nur rücksichtsloser gewesen! Doch der alte Mann konnte sich noch nicht von mir trennen. Noch einmal faßte er mich, noch einmal streichelte er mir den Arm, um mir noch-und nochmals zu bekunden, wie dankbar er mir sei und was ich für ihn getan. Jetzt könne er beruhigt sterben, das Kind werde geheilt, alles sei jetzt gut, und alles durch mich, nur durch mich. Es wurde mir immer peinlicher, mich so streicheln, mir so schmeicheln zu lassen in Gegenwart des Dieners, der geduldig wartend und gesenkten Haupts danebenstand. Mehrmals hatte ich dem alten Mann schon die Hand zum Abschied geschüttelt, aber immer wieder begann er von neuem. Und ich Narr meines Mitleids, ich stand, ich blieb. Ich fand nicht die Kraft, mich loszureißen, obwohl innen eine dunkle Stimme drängte: genug und zu viel!","I walked the few steps out into the anteroom, where the servant with cap and saber was already waiting. But if only I had gone faster! If only I had been more ruthless! But the old man couldn't part with me yet. Once more he grabbed me, once more he stroked my arm to tell me again and again how grateful he was to me and what I had done for him. Now he could die in peace, the child would be healed, everything was fine now, and everything through me, only through me. It was becoming more and more embarrassing to allow myself to be caressed and flattered in the presence of the servant who stood by, patiently waiting, his head bowed. I'd shaken hands with the old man several times before, but he kept starting over. And I fool of my pity, I stood, I stayed. I couldn't find the strength to tear myself away, although a dark voice urged from within: enough and too much!","I went the few steps into the front hall, where the servant was standing ready with my cap and sword. I only wish I had walked faster , I wish I had been less considerate of old Kekesfalva’s feelings, for he still couldn’t bear to see me go. Once again he embraced me, caressed my arm to show me yet again how grateful he was for what I had done for him. Now he could die in peace, he said, his child would be cured, everything was good now, and it was all because of me, all my doing. I felt it increasingly embarrassing to be caressed and flattered like that in front of the servant, who still stood waiting patiently with his head bowed. I had already shaken the old man’s hand and said goodbye several times, but he always began again. And I, made foolish by my pity, stayed standing there. I could not find the strength to tear myself away, although a sombre voice inside me said firmly—this is enough, this is too much.","I went out into the hall, where Josef was waiting for me with my cap and sword. If only I had gone more quickly! If only I had been more ruthless! But old Kekesfalva could not bring himself to part from me. Once more he seized me, once more he patted my arm, kept telling me over and over again how grateful he was to me, and what I had done for him. Now he could die in peace, his child would be cured, all was well now, and it was all my doing, all my doing! I grew more and more uncomfortable at being patted and flattered, in the presence of Josef, who was waiting patiently with bowed head. Several times I had shaken the old man by the hand in farewell, but he kept thanking me all over again. And I, the slave of my pity, I stood there, I stayed, unable to summon up the strength to tear myself away, although an ominous voice within me urged: enough, no more of this!"
"Aber schließlich gebe ich mir, nach beendeter Umkreisung wieder beim Gittertor von der anderen Seite angelangt, den entscheidenden Ruck. Ich durchschreite den Kiesweg zwischen den kerzengrade geschnittenen Bäumen und lasse an der Haustür den schweren bronzegetriebenen Klopfer niederfallen, der hier nach altem Brauch statt einer Glocke dient. Sofort erscheint der Diener – sonderbar, er scheint gar nicht erstaunt über den unangemeldeten Besuch. Ohne weiter zu fragen oder meine schon vorbereitete Visitenkarte entgegenzunehmen, lädt er mich mit höflicher Verbeugung ein, im Salon zu warten, die Damen seien noch auf ihrem Zimmer, würden aber gleich kommen; daß ich empfangen werde, scheint also zweifellos. Wie einen angesagten Besuch führt er mich weiter; mit erneutem Unbehagen erkenne ich den rottapezierten Salon wieder, in dem damals getanzt wurde, und ein bitterer Geschmack in der Kehle erinnert mich, daß nebenan jener Raum mit der verhängnisvollen Ecke sich befinden muß.","But finally I give myself the decisive push, having reached the lattice gate from the other side after completing the circle. I stride through the gravel path between the trees that have been pruned to perfection and let the heavy bronze knocker fall on the front door, which, according to old custom, serves here instead of a bell. The servant appears immediately - strange, he doesn't seem at all surprised at the unannounced visit. Without asking any more questions or accepting my visiting card, which I had already prepared, he invites me with a polite bow to wait in the drawing room, the ladies are still in their rooms but will come in a moment; that I will be received seems therefore indubitable. Like a hip visitor, he leads me on; With renewed uneasiness I recognize the red-papered salon where people used to dance, and a bitter taste in my throat reminds me that the room with the fateful corner must be next door.","But finally, after concluding my circuit of the house and finding myself approaching the wrought iron gate again from the other side, I pull myself together. I walk up the gravel path between trees pruned to stand ramrod straight, lift the heavy, chased bronze knocker that, in the old way, serves instead of a doorbell here, and bring it down. At once the manservant appears—strange to say, he does not even seem surprised by my unannounced visit. Without asking questions, or taking the visiting card I have ready to offer him, he asks me, with a civil bow, to wait in the salon; the ladies, he says, are still in their boudoir but will be with me directly, so it seems there is no doubt that they will receive me. He leads me on like an expected visitor, and feeling uncomfortable again I recognise the salon wallpapered in red where couples danced, and a bitter taste in my throat reminds me that the boudoir with the fateful corner must be next door.","But at length, having walked right round the outer wall and reached the gate again from the other side, I screwed up my courage, walked along the gravel path between a double row of pollarded trees to the front door and lifted the heavy chased bronze knocker, which, in accordance with old custom, served the purpose of a bell. A moment later the butler appeared. Strange, he did not seem at all taken aback by my unannounced visit. Without inquiring further or taking the visiting-card which I held in my hand, he invited me, with a polite bow, to wait in the salon, saying that the ladies were still in their room, but would come in a moment; there seemed to be no doubt, then, of my being received. He led me into the house as though my visit were expected; with renewed uneasiness I recognized the red-tapestried salon in which we had danced that first evening, and a bitter taste in my mouth reminded me that next door must be that room with the fateful corner."
"Jetzt galt es, die Volte zu schlagen, jetzt oder nie! Kanitz rang gewaltsam den Atem nieder. ›Der Schätzwert … ja, der Schätzwert, mit dem … mit dem ist es immer eine ungewisse … eine sehr dubiose Sache … denn … denn … der amtliche Schätzwert entspricht nie völlig dem Verkaufswert. Man kann nie darauf rechnen, das heißt, bestimmt darauf rechnen, den ganzen Schätzwert zu erzielen … in manchen Fällen natürlich kann man ihn erzielen, in manchen sogar noch mehr … aber doch nur unter gewissen Umständen … es bleibt immer eine Art Glücksspiel wie bei jeder Lizitation … Der Schätzwert bedeutet schließlich nichts als einen Anhaltspunkt, natürlich einen ganz vagen … zum Beispiel … man kann zum Beispiel annehmen‹ – Kanitz zitterte: nicht zuwenig jetzt und nicht zuviel! – ›wenn ein Objekt wie dieses hier amtlich auf hundertneunzigtausend Kronen geschätzt ist … dann kann man immerhin annehmen, daß … daß … daß im Verkaufsfall hundertfünfzigtausend jedenfalls zu erzielen sind, jedenfalls! Damit kann man auf jeden Fall rechnen.‹","Now it was time to do the volte, it was now or never! Kanitz gasped for breath. 'The appraised value... yes, the appraised value, with which... it's always an uncertain... a very dubious matter... because... because... the official appraised value never fully corresponds to the sales value. You can never count on, that is, definitely count on, getting the full appraisal... in some cases, of course, you can get it, in some even more... but only under certain circumstances... it's always a kind of gamble, like anything else Bidding ... After all, the estimated value means nothing but a clue, of course a very vague one ... for example ... one can assume, for example' - Kanitz trembled: not too little now and not too much! – 'If an object like this one here is officially valued at 190,000 crowns ... then one can at least assume that ... that ... that in the event of a sale, 150,000 can be achieved, anyway! You can definitely count on that.‹","“And now for some quick sleight of hand, now or never! Kanitz forced himself to breathe calmly. ‘The estimated value … well, the estimated value is always an uncertain, a very dubious figure, because … because the official estimate never corresponds entirely to the real sale value. You can never be sure … I mean, you can never rely for certain on receiving the full estimated value … in some cases of course you may get it, in some even more, but only in certain circumstances … this kind of procedure, selling to the highest bidder, is always something of a game of chance. The estimated value, after all, is nothing but a kind of reference point, and of course a very vague one. For instance … we could assume—’ Kanitz was trembling, he mustn’t say too little or too much now!—‘we could assume that if an item like this is officially valued at a hundred and ninety thousand crowns … then we can assume that … that … that in a sale at auction you could expect to get at least a hundred and fifty thousand, yes, at least that! You could count on getting that in any event.’","Now was the time to clinch matters, now or never. Kanitz tried to suppress his laboured breathing. ‘The estimated value ... yes, the estimated value, there’s always some uncertainty about it, it’s ... always a very doubtful matter ... for ... the official valuation never quite corresponds to the real value for selling purposes. One can never rely — that is definitely rely — on getting the whole amount at which an estate is assessed. In some cases, of course, one can get it, in some cases even more ... but only in certain circumstances ... it’s always a bit of a gamble, as in the case of an auction ... The estimated value is, after all, no more than a figure to go upon, a very vague figure, of course. One can assume, for example’ — Kanitz trembled; not too little now and not too much! — ‘if an estate like this, for example, is officially assessed at a hundred and ninety thousand crowns ... one may assume that ... that ... in the event of a sale one could at any rate get a hundred and fifty thousand. One could count on that at any rate.’"
"»Ach, das meinen Sie?« sagte sie völlig unbefangen. »Das kann doch nicht arg sein. Ein paar hundert Kronen höchstens. Die werden’s doch nicht ausmachen.«","""Oh, that's what you mean?"" she said, completely unabashed. 'It can't be bad. A few hundred crowns at most. They won't mind.""","“Oh, that’s what you’re talking about?” she said, not at all abashed. “Surely it can’t be that much! A few hundred crowns at the most. That can’t make such a difference.”","‘Oh, is that what you mean?’ she said with an utter lack of embarrassment. ‘ That won’t come to so very much. A few hundred crowns at the most. That surely can’t make any difference.’"
»Was sagen?«,"""To say something?""",“Tell her what?”,‘Tell her what?’
"»Wie lieb von dir, Klara«, und seine Stimme streichelte gleichsam mit.","""How kind of you, Klara,"" and his voice caressed me, so to speak.",It was as if his voice itself caressed her.,"‘How sweet of you, Klara!’ And even his voice seemed like a caress."
"Sein erster Blick im Salon gilt den vier Guardis, die Sie ja kennen, und nebenan, in Ediths Boudoir, dem Glasschrank mit dem chinesischen Porzellan, den Tapisserien und kleinen Plastiken aus Jade. Erleichterung! – alles ist noch da. Petrovic hat nichts gestohlen, der dumme Kerl holt sich lieber beim Hafer, beim Klee, bei den Kartoffeln, bei den Reparaturen sein Teil. Fräulein Dietzenhof, offenbar aus Verlegenheit, den fremden Herrn bei seinem nervösen Herumblicken zu stören, öffnet unterdes die verschlossenen Jalousien. Licht flutet herein, man sieht durch die hohen Glastüren weit in den Park hinaus. Konversation machen, denkt sich Kanitz. Sie nicht auslassen! Sich mit ihr anfreunden!","His first glance in the salon is of the four Guardis you know, and next door, in Edith's boudoir, the glass cabinet with the Chinese china, the tapestries and small jade sculptures. Relief! – everything is still there. Petrovic didn't steal anything, the stupid guy prefers to get his share from the oats, from the clover, from the potatoes, from the repairs. Fraulein Dietzenhof, obviously embarrassed to disturb the strange gentleman with his nervous glance around, is meanwhile opening the closed blinds. Light floods in, you can see far out into the park through the high glass doors. Make conversation, thinks Kanitz. Don't miss them! Make friends with her!","“His first glance in the salon is for the four Guardis, the Venetian scenes that you know yourself, and next door, in what is now Edith’s boudoir, he checks the glass-fronted cupboard of Chinese porcelain, the tapestries and the little jade figurines. What a relief! It’s all still there. Petrovic hasn’t stolen anything from indoors, the stupid fellow has confined himself to oats, clover and potatoes, and to seeing that his own domain is kept in repair. Meanwhile Fräulein Dietzenhof, obviously fearing to disturb the strange gentleman as he looks nervously around, throws open the closed shutters. Light floods in, and there is a view through the tall French windows far out in the park. I must get into conversation, thinks Kanitz, mustn’t neglect her. Make friends with her, he tells himself.","His first thought was for the four Guardis in the salon, which I expect you know, and the glass cabinet in the adjoining room, now Edith’s drawing room, with the Chinese porcelain, the tapestries and little jade figures. What a relief, everything was still there! Petrovic hadn’t stolen anything; the dolt was more interested in making what he could on the sale of the oats, the clover, the potatoes, and on the contracts for repairs. Meanwhile Fräulein Dietzenhof, obviously anxious not to disturb the stranger on his restless tour of inspection, threw open the shutters. The light came pouring in, and it was possible to see through the tall French windows right out into the park. I must make conversation, thought Kanitz. Mustn’t let her slip through my fingers. Must make friends with her."
"Und dann saßen wir rund um den Tisch, Edith mir gegenüber. Nicht ein einziges Mal blickte sie auf, zu niemandem sprach sie ein Wort. Alle drei spürten wir das Obstinate, das aggressiv Beleidigende ihrer verpreßten Stummheit. Um so gewaltsamer versuchte ich darum, Stimmung zu machen. Ich erzählte von unserem Obersten, der wie ein Quartalsäufer regelmäßig im Juni und Juli seine sogenannte »Manöverkrankheit« bekam, und wie er, je näher der Termin der großen Übung heranrückte, immer aufgeregter, immer federfuchsiger werde: ich schmückte, um die dumme Geschichte auszuwalken, obwohl der Kragen um meine Kehle sich gleichsam nach innen würgte, sie mit immer läppischeren Details aus. Jedoch nur die andern lachten, auch sie gezwungen und sichtlich bemüht, das peinliche Schweigen Ediths zu decken, die nun schon zum drittenmal ostentativ gähnte. Aber nur weitersprechen, sagte ich mir, und so erzählte ich, wie wir jetzt herumgehetzt würden, niemand wisse mehr ein und aus. Obwohl gestern zwei Ulanen mit Sonnenstich vom Pferd gefallen seien, nehme der rabiate Menschenschinder uns jeden Tag noch schärfer vor. Wann man aus dem Sattel komme, könne jetzt niemand mehr voraussagen, zwanzigmal, dreißigmal lasse er in seinem Manöverkoller die dümmste Übung wiederholen. Mit Müh und Not sei’s mir heute noch gelungen, mich rechtzeitig fortzudrücken, aber ob ich morgen ganz pünktlich kommen könnte, wüßte nur der liebe Gott und der Herr Oberst, der sich zur Zeit für seinen Statthalter auf Erden halte.","And then we sat around the table, Edith across from me. She didn't look up once, didn't say a word to anyone. All three of us felt the obstinacy, the aggressive insult of their suppressed muteness. That's why I tried all the more violently to create a mood. I told them about our colonel, who, like a quarter-turner, got his so-called ""maneuver sickness"" regularly in June and July, and how, the closer the date of the big exercise drew, he became more and more excited, more and more penny-pinching: I adorned myself in order to flatten out the stupid story , although the collar around my throat seemed to be choking inward, squeezing it out with more and more silly details. However, only the others laughed, they, too, forced and visibly trying to cover Edith's embarrassing silence, who was now ostentatiously yawning for the third time. But just keep talking, I said to myself, and so I told how we were being rushed around now, no one knew what to do anymore. Although yesterday two Uhlans fell from their horses with sunstroke, the ruthless human flayer takes us even harder every day. No one could now predict when you would get out of the saddle, twenty or thirty times in his maneuvering frenzy he had the stupidest exercise repeated. With great difficulty I managed to get away in time today, but only God and the Colonel, who currently considers himself his governor on earth, know whether I could be there on time tomorrow.","And then there we were sitting around the table, with Edith opposite me. She didn’t look up once , she said not a word to anyone. All three of us were aware of her dogged and aggressively offensive silence. I tried all the harder to lighten the atmosphere. I talked about our colonel, who like a habitual drunk regularly suffered from a disorder at a given time of year, in his case in June and July when he became more and more obsessed with the forthcoming manoeuvres, turning more pernickety and agitated the closer the date for them came. Although I felt as though my collar was strangling me, I padded this stupid story out by embroidering it with many silly details. However, only the others laughed; they too were obviously forcing themselves to cover up for Edith’s embarrassing silence. She was now yawning ostentatiously for the third time during dinner. Keep talking, I told myself, and so I said that we were being worked to death these days, no one knew whether he was coming or going. Even though two lancers fell off their horses with sunstroke yesterday, I added, that crazy slave-driver our colonel made more demands on us every day. We could never predict when we’d be allowed to get out of the saddle; he had the most pointless exercise carried out twenty to thirty times running. I’d managed to get away just in time to come here today, I said, but whether I’d be able to arrive punctually tomorrow was known only to the Lord God and the Colonel, who considered himself God’s representative on earth anyway.","he asked. And then we sat round the table, Edith opposite me. Not once did she look up, not a word did she address to any of us. We all three felt how aggressively offensive was this stubborn silence of hers. All the more strenuous, therefore, were the efforts I made to brighten things up. I told them about our Colonel, who, like a man subject to bouts of drinking, had an attack of ‘manoeuvre-itis’ every June and July, and how as the date for the manoeuvres drew nearer he became more and more excitable, and in order to spin out the silly story I embroidered it with more and more absurd details, although all the time I felt as though my collar were strangling me. But only Kekesfalva and Ilona laughed, constrainedly, in an obvious endeavour to cover up Edith’s painful silence, for she was now yawning ostentatiously for the third time. At all costs go on talking, I said to myself; and so I told them how we should be chivvied about all summer and hardly know whether we were on our heads or our heels. Although two Uhlans had fallen off their horses yesterday from sunstroke, the fanatical old martinet drove us harder every day. No one could ever tell when we should dismiss, for in his maniacal zeal he would have the silliest evolution repeated twenty or thirty times over. It was only with the greatest difficulty, I said, that I had succeeded in getting off in time today, and whether I should be able to turn up punctually tomorrow only God knew and the Colonel, who for the time being regarded himself as the Almighty’s representative on this earth."
»Nun – viel habe ich nicht bemerkt von Ihrer großen Freude!«,"""Well - I didn't notice much of your great joy!""","“Well, I haven’t noticed you taking it as such a delightful surprise yourself!”","‘Well, I can’t say I have exactly noticed your great pleasure!’"
"So saß ich auch diesmal eines Nachmittags, es muß Mitte Mai 1914 gewesen sein, mit einem gelegentlichen Partner, dem Apotheker zum Goldenen Engel, der gleichzeitig Vizebürgermeister unseres Garnisonsstädtchens war, in der Konditorei. Wir hatten unsere üblichen drei Partien längt zu Ende gespielt, und man redete nur aus Trägheit, sich aufzurappeln – wohin denn in diesem langweiligen Nest? – noch so hin und her, aber das Gespräch qualmte schon schläfrig wie eine abgebrannte Zigarette. Da geht mit einem Mal die Tür auf, und ein wehender Glockenrock schwingt mit einem Büschel frischer Luft ein hübsches Mädel herein: braune, mandelförmige Augen, dunkler Teint, famos gekleidet, gar nicht Provinz, und vor allem ein neues Gesicht in diesem gottsjämmerlichen Einerlei. Leider schenkt die smarte Nymphe uns respektvoll Aufstaunenden keinen Blick; scharf und rassig, mit sportlich festem Schritt quert sie an den neun kleinen Marmortischchen des Lokals vorbei geradewegs auf das Verkaufspult zu, um dort gleich en gros ein ganzes Dutzend Kuchen, Torten und Schnäpse zu bestellen. Mir fällt sofort auf, wie devotissime sich der Herr Kuchenbäcker vor ihr verneigt – nie habe ich die Rückennaht seines Schwalbenrocks so straff hinabgespannt gesehen. Sogar seine Frau, die üppig-grobschlächtige Provinzvenus, die sich sonst von allen Offizieren nachlässigst hofieren läßt (oft bleibt man ja bis Monatsende allerhand Kleinigkeiten schuldig), erhebt sich von ihrem Sitz an der Kasse und zergeht beinahe in pflaumenweicher Höflichkeit. Das hübsche Mädel knabbert, während der Kuchenbäcker die Bestellung ins Kundenbuch notiert, achtlos ein paar Pralinés an und macht ein bißchen Konversation mit Frau Großmaier; für uns aber, die wir vielleicht ungebührlich eifrig die Hälse recken, fällt nicht einmal ein Augenblink ab. Natürlich beschwert sich die junge Dame nicht mit einem einzigen Päckchen die hübsche Hand; es wird ihr alles, wie Frau Großmaier submissest versichert, zuverlässig geschickt. Und sie denkt auch nicht im mindesten daran, wie wir gewöhnlichen Sterblichen an der stählernen Automatenkasse bar zu bezahlen. Sofort wissen wir alle: extrafeine, vornehme Kundschaft!","So this time too, one afternoon, it must have been mid-May 1914, I was sitting in the pastry shop with an occasional partner, the pharmacist zum Goldenen Engel, who was also the deputy mayor of our little garrison town. We had long played our usual three games to the end, and it was only talk of laziness to get up - where was this boring place to go? – still so back and forth, but the conversation was already smoked sleepily like a burnt cigarette. Suddenly the door opens and a waving flared skirt swings in with a tuft of fresh air a pretty girl: brown, almond-shaped eyes, dark complexion, splendidly dressed, not provincial at all, and above all a new face in this pitiful monotony. Unfortunately, the smart nymph doesn't look at us, who are respectfully amazed; hot and racy, with a sporty, firm step, she crosses the nine small marble tables in the bar straight to the sales counter to order a whole dozen cakes, tarts and schnapps in bulk. I immediately notice how devoutly the pastry chef bows to her - I've never seen the back seam of his swallow skirt stretched so tightly. Even his wife, the voluptuous, coarse provincial Venus, who otherwise allows all the officers to carelessly court her (one often owes all sorts of little things until the end of the month), gets up from her seat at the cash register and almost melts in plump politeness. While the cake baker notes the order in the customer book, the pretty girl carelessly nibbles on a few pralines and makes a little conversation with Mrs. Großmaier; but for us, who perhaps crane our necks unduly eagerly, we don't even blink an eye. Of course, the young lady doesn't complain to the pretty hand with a single packet; Everything will be reliably sent to her, as Frau Großmaier assures submissest. And she doesn't give a damn about paying cash at the steel machine till like us mere mortals. Immediately we all know: extra fine, distinguished clientele!","So one afternoon—it must have been in the middle of May 1914—I was sitting in the cake shop with one of my occasional partners, the pharmacist who kept his shop at the sign of the Golden Eagle, and who was also deputy mayor of our little garrison town. We had long ago finished playing our usual three games, and were just talking idly about this or that —what was there in this tedious place to make you want to get up in the morning?—but the conversation was drowsy, and as slow as the smoke from a cigarette burning down. At this point the door suddenly opens, and a pretty girl in a full-skirted dress is swept in on a gust of fresh air, a girl with brown, almond-shaped eyes and a dark complexion. She is dressed with real elegance, not at all in the provincial style. Above all she is a new face in the monotony of this godforsaken town. Sad to say, the elegantly dressed young lady does not spare us a glance as we respectfully admire her, but walks briskly and vivaciously with a firm, athletic gait past the nine little marble tables in the cake shop and up to the sales counter, to order cakes, tarts and liqueurs by the dozen. I immediately notice how respectfully the master confectioner bows to her—I’ve never seen the back seam of his swallow-tailed coat stretched so taut. Even his wife, that opulent if heavily built provincial Venus, who in the usual way negligently allows the officers to court her (all manner of little things often go unpaid for until the end of the month), rises from her seat at the cash desk and almost dissolves in obsequious civilities. While the master confectioner notes down the order in the customers’ book, the pretty girl carelessly nibbles a couple of chocolates and makes a little conversation with Frau Grossmaier. However, she has no time to spare for us, and we may perhaps be craning our necks with unbecoming alacrity. Of course the young lady does not burden her own pretty hands with a single package; everything, as Frau Grossmaier assures her, will be delivered, she can rely on that. Nor does she think for a moment of paying cash at the till, as we mere mortals must. We all know at once that this is a very superior and distinguished customer.","And so one afternoon — it must have been somewhere about the middle of May, 1914 — I was sitting in the pâtisserie with our local apothecary and deputy mayor, who from time to time took me on at chess. We had long since finished our customary three games, and were chatting away out of sheer inertia — what was there to do in this boring hole? — but the conversation was already petering out like a smouldering cigarette-end. Then, suddenly, the door opened, and a billowing skirt swept in a gust of fresh air and a pretty girl: brown, almond eyes, dark complexion, superbly dressed, not a bit provincial, and, what was more, a new face in this Godforsaken monotony. But alas! the elegant nymph did not vouchsafe us a glance as we looked up in awed admiration; briskly and spiritedly, with firm athletic tread, she walked past the nine little marble-topped tables straight to the counter, where she proceeded to order cakes, pastries and liqueurs by the dozen. I was immediately struck by the very obsequious way in which the proprietor bowed to her; never had I seen the back-seam of his swallow-tails arched so tautly. Even his wife, the buxom, overblown provincial beauty, who was accustomed to accept the attentions of us officers in the most perfunctory manner (we were often in debt for all kinds of little trifles until pay-day came round), rose from her seat at the cash desk and almost dissolved in treacly politeness. While the worthy proprietor was entering her order in his book, the pretty young lady carelessly nibbled at a few chocolates and made conversation with Frau Grossmaier: but as for us, who were, I fear, craning our necks with unseemly eagerness, we were not accorded so much as the flicker of an eyelid. Naturally the young lady did not burden her pretty hands with a single parcel; everything, Frau Grossmaier humbly assured her, would be sent at once without fail. Nor did it even enter her head to pay at the cash desk like us ordinary mortals. We all realized at once that here was a quite unusually grand, distinguished customer."
"Der Oberst schloß auf. Wir traten in sein Zimmer, das in seiner spartanischen Nüchternheit eher einer Studentenbude glich: ein eisernes Feldbett – er wollte in keinem besseren schlafen als Franz Joseph in der Hofburg – zwei Farbdrucke, der Kaiser rechts, die Kaiserin links, vier oder fünf billig gerahmte Erinnungsphotographien von der Ausmusterung und Regimentsabenden, ein paar überkreuzte Säbel und zwei türkische Pistolen – das war alles. Kein bequemer Fauteuil, keine Bücher, gerade nur vier Strohsessel um einen harten leeren Tisch.","The Colonel unlocked the door. We went into his room, which in its spartan sobriety was more like a student shack: an iron camp bed - he didn't want to sleep in any better one than Franz Joseph in the Hofburg - two color prints, the Kaiser on the right, the Empress on the left, four or five cheaply framed souvenir photographs from retirement and regimental evenings, a pair of crossed sabers and two Turkish pistols—that was all. No comfortable armchair, no books, just four straw chairs around a hard empty table.","The Colonel unlocked his door. We entered his room, which was plain and spartan, more like a student’s lodgings.

No comfortable easy chair, no books, just four cane chairs round a hard, empty table.","The Colonel unlocked his door and we entered his room, which, in its Spartan simplicity, resembled a student’s cubicle: an iron camp-bed — he refused to sleep in greater comfort than Francis Joseph in the Hofburg — two coloured prints, on the right the Emperor, on the left the Empress, four or five cheaply framed photographs of inspections and regimental dinners, a pair of crossed swords and two Turkish pistols — that was all.

In the meantime you two can start your game of chess. I’ve got one or two matters to settle with regard to our journey, but I’ll be with you again in an hour.’"
"Sie sagte es leer vor sich hin und hob dann die blauen Augen zu ihm auf, als erhoffte sie von ihm einen Rat – (Solche Augen müßte man haben, hatte Kanitz gestern zu sich selber gesagt) –, und plötzlich, er wußte nicht, wieso es ihm geschah, fühlte er einen Gedanken, einen Wunsch sich zur Lippe drängen.","She said it blankly to herself and then lifted her blue eyes to him as if she were hoping for some advice from him—(One should have eyes like that, Kanitz had said to himself yesterday)—and suddenly, he didn't know why when it happened to him, he felt a thought, a wish, rush to his lips.","“She spoke tonelessly, and then raised her blue eyes to him as if hoping for advice of some kind.

"Aber da erschien sie schon wieder an der Tür, sie hatte feuchte Augen und war furchtbar erregt. Ihre Schultern zitterten. Sie kam auf den Tisch zu.

Dann atmete sie leise, ohne den Blick zu heben:","But then she appeared at the door again, she had teary eyes and was terribly excited. Her shoulders trembled. She approached the table.

"Dann kam die erste Prüfung über ihn. Schon längere Zeit hatte seine Frau an inneren Schmerzen gelitten, die Speisen widerten sie an, sie magerte ab, ging immer müder und erschöpfter; aber aus Furcht, den vielbeschäftigten Mann mit ihrer unbedeutsamen Person zu beunruhigen, preßte sie die Lippen zusammen, wenn ein Anfall kam, und verschwieg ihre Schmerzen. Als schließlich ein Verbergen sich nicht länger mehr möglich erwies, war es zu spät. Man brachte sie im Krankenwagen nach Wien, um das vermeintliche Magengeschwür – in Wirklichkeit einen Krebs – zu operieren. Bei dieser Gelegenheit lernte ich Kekesfalva kennen, und eine wildere, eine grausamere Art der Verzweiflung habe ich nie bei einem Menschen gesehen. Er konnte, er wollte einfach nicht begreifen, daß die Medizin seine Frau nicht mehr zu retten vermochte; nur Trägheit, nur Gleichgültigkeit, nur Unfähigkeit der Ärzte schien es ihm, daß wir nicht mehr taten, nicht mehr tun konnten. Fünfzigtausend, hunderttausend Kronen bot er dem Professor, wenn er sie gesund mache. Telegraphisch ließ er am Tag der Operation noch aus Budapest, aus München, aus Berlin die ersten Autoritäten kommen, nur um einen zu finden, der sagte, daß man sie vielleicht vor dem Messer bewahren könne. Und nie in meinem Leben werde ich seine irren Augen vergessen, während er uns anschrie, wir seien insgesamt Mörder, als die Unrettbare, wie nicht anders zu erwarten war, unter dem Messer blieb.","Then the first test came over him. His wife had been suffering from internal pain for a long time, the food disgusted her, she lost weight, walked more and more tired and exhausted; but, afraid of disturbing the busy man with her insignificant person, she pressed her lips together when an attack came, and kept silent about her pain. When finally concealment proved no longer possible, it was too late. She was taken to Vienna in an ambulance to operate on what she thought was a stomach ulcer – which was actually cancer. It was on this occasion that I met Kekesfalva, and I have never seen a wilder, a crueler despair in a man. He couldn't, he just didn't want to understand that medicine could no longer save his wife; It seemed to him that it was just inertia, just indifference, just incompetence on the part of the doctors that we didn't do more, couldn't do more. He offered the professor fifty thousand, one hundred thousand crowns if he would make her well. On the day of the operation he sent for the first authorities by telegraph from Budapest, Munich, and Berlin, only to find one who said that perhaps they could be saved from the knife. And never in my life will I forget his mad eyes as he yelled at us that we were all murderers when, as was to be expected, the elusive stayed under the knife.","“Then his first time of trial began. His wife had been suffering internal pains for some time, she lost her appetite and grew thin, and she felt constantly tired and exhausted, but for fear of causing her busily occupied husband anxiety about her insignificant self she gritted her teeth when an attack came on, and said nothing about her pain. By the time it was impossible to conceal it any longer, it was too late. She was taken to Vienna by ambulance for an operation on her supposed stomach ulcer, which in fact was cancer. This was when I came to know Kekesfalva, and I have never seen a man suffer more savage and cruel despair. He could not, absolutely would not grasp the fact that medical science could not save his wife now, and he thought that we doctors did not do more—could not do more—out of mere apathy, indifference, and lack of skill on our part. He offered the Professor at the University Hospital fifty thousand, a hundred thousand crowns to cure her. On the day of the operation he was still summoning the leading authorities from Budapest, Munich and Berlin by telegraph, just to find one who would say that she might not have to go under the knife. And I shall never forget the madness in his eyes when she died during the operation—as was only to be expected, for there was no hope of saving her—and he screamed at us that we were all murderers.","Then came his first trial. For a long time his wife had suffered from internal pains. She went off her food, lost weight, and dragged herself about, looking more and more weary and exhausted.

"Das sogenannte »Kanzleipapier«, ein auf den Millimeter vorschriftsmäßig ausgemessener Foliobogen ganz bestimmten Formats, war vielleicht das unentbehrlichste Requisit der österreichischen Zivil-und Militärverwaltung. Jedes Gesuch, jedes Aktenstück, jede Meldung hatte auf diesem säuberlich geschnittenen Papier erstattet zu werden, das durch die Einmaligkeit seiner Form alles Amtliche sichtbar vom Privaten absonderte; auf den Millionen und Milliarden dieser in den Kanzleien aufgeschichteten Blätter wird einmal vielleicht einzig verläßlich die ganze Lebens-und Leidensgeschichte der Habsburgischen Monarchie nachzulesen sein. Keine Mitteilung galt als richtig erstattet, wenn sie nicht auf diesem weißen Rechteck ausgefertigt wurde, und so war es denn auch mein erstes Geschäft, in der nächsten Tabaktrafik zwei solcher Bogen zu kaufen, dazu einen sogenannten »Faulenzer« – ein liniertes Unterlageblatt – sowie das dazugehörige Kuvert. Dann noch hinüber in ein Kaffeehaus, wo man in Wien alles erledigt, das Ernsteste wie das Übermütigste. In zwanzig Minuten, um sechs Uhr, konnte das Gesuch bereits geschrieben sein; dann gehörte ich wieder mir selbst und mir allein.","The so-called »Kanzleipapier«, a folio sheet of a very specific format measured to the millimeter according to regulations, was perhaps the most indispensable prop of the Austrian civil and military administration. Every request, every file, every report had to be submitted on this neatly cut paper, which visibly separated everything official from the private through the uniqueness of its form; on the millions and billions of these sheets piled up in the chancellery, one day it will perhaps be the only reliable way to read the entire life and suffering history of the Habsburg monarchy. No notification was considered correct if it was not made out on this white rectangle, and so it was my first business to buy two such sheets in the nearest tobacconist, plus a so-called ""Faulenzer"" - a lined backing sheet - and that associated envelope. Then over to a coffee house, where in Vienna everything is taken care of, the most serious as well as the most cocky. In twenty minutes, at six o'clock, the request could already be written; then I was mine again and mine alone.","The chancery registration form, a folio sheet measured to the precise millimetre specified for its particular format, was perhaps the most essential requisite of the pre-war Austrian civil service and military administration. Every petition, every official document, every report had to be made out on this form, neatly trimmed to size. Its unique format clearly marked the line between official and private papers, and some day, perhaps, the millions and millions of registration forms filed away in the chancery offices will give an idea of the entire social history of the Habsburg monarchy. No communication was considered correct unless it was entered on this white rectangle, and so the first thing for me to do was to buy two such forms in the nearest tobacconist’s, along with a “lazy man’s guide”—the lined sheet to place under the form so that you were sure to write neatly—and the proper size of envelope. Then I would go over to a café, for all business, whether serious or frivolous, is transacted in cafés in Vienna. In twenty minutes’ time, around six o’clock, I could have my resignation written out, and then I would be my own master and mine alone.","The so-called ‘chancery double’, a folded sheet of paper of prescribed dimensions and format, was perhaps the most indispensable requisite of the Austrian civil and military administration. Every request, every memorandum, every report, had to be sent in on this neatly trimmed form, which, owing to the uniqueness of its format, enabled official documents to be distinguished at a glance from private correspondence. From the millions and millions of such forms piled up in government offices it may one day be possible to glean the only reliable account of the history and misfortunes of the Habsburg monarchy. No communication is officially recognized unless it is made on this white rectangle of paper, and so my first task was to buy two such forms at the nearest tobacconist ’s, an envelope, and, in addition, one of those so-called ‘guides’ which you place underneath so that the lines show through. The next thing was to go across to a café, the place in Vienna where all business, the most serious as well as the most frivolous, is transacted. In twenty minutes’ time, that is to say by six o’clock, I should have my resignation written out, and I should once more belong to myself and myself alone."
"Ich fragte und staunte: warum sieht dieser fremde Mensch, dieser alte Lakai mich so ekstatisch an? Warum liebt er mich so? Macht es wirklich die Menschen schon gut und glücklich, wenn sie bei andern Güte und Mitleid sehen? Ja, dann behielte Condor recht, dann hätte wirklich, wer auch nur einem einzigen Menschen hilft, den Sinn seines Lebens erfüllt, dann lohnte es wahrhaftig, andern sich hinzugeben bis ans Ende seiner Kraft und sogar über seine Kraft. Dann wäre jedes Opfer gerecht und selbst eine Lüge, die andere glücklich macht, wichtiger als alle Wahrheit. Mit einmal spürte ich meinen Fuß sicher bis zur Sohle hinab; anders schreitet der Mensch, wenn er weiß, daß er Freude mit sich bringt.","I asked and was amazed: why is this stranger, this old footman looking at me so ecstatically? Why does he love me so? Does it really make people good and happy when they see kindness and compassion in others? Yes, then Condor would be right, then whoever helps just one person would have really fulfilled the meaning of his life, then it would really be worth giving yourself to others to the end of one's strength and even beyond one's strength. Then every sacrifice would be just and even a lie that makes others happy would be more important than any truth. Suddenly I felt my foot firmly down to the sole; man walks differently when he knows that he brings joy with him.","I wondered, in astonishment, why does this stranger, this old manservant, look at me so ecstatically? Why does he seem so fond of me? Does it really make someone kind and happy to see kindness and sympathy in others? If so then Condor was right—if you help only one other human being you have made sense of your life, and it was truly rewarding to sacrifice yourself for others, to the full extent of your powers and even beyond. Then any sacrifice was worthwhile, even a lie if it made others happy was more important than the truth. Suddenly I felt my tread was sure and steady. A man who knows he brings joy with him walks in a new way.","Why was the old retainer looking at me so ecstatically? I asked myself in amazement. Why was he so fond of me? Were people really made so kind and happy by seeing others display kindness and pity? If that were so, Condor was right; if that were so, anyone who made a single person happy had fulfilled the purpose of his existence; it was really worth while to devote oneself to others to the very limit of one’s strength, and even beyond. If that were so, every sacrifice was justified, and even a lie that made others happy was more important than truth itself. Of a sudden I felt my step grow firm, for a man who knows that he is bringing happiness with him has a new lightness in his tread."
"Er hat es gut gemeint, der brave, treue Bursch, aber er hätte mir das »Nein« nicht so leicht machen sollen. Ein grenzenloser Ekel ergreift mich vor dieser burschikosen, spottlustigen Neugier.

Ohne recht zu bedenken, wehre ich ärgerlich ab:","He meant well, the good, loyal fellow, but he shouldn't have made the ""No"" so easy for me.

Without really thinking about it, I angrily repel:","He means well, he’s a good sort, but he shouldn’t have made it so easy for me to say “No.” Nausea seizes me in the face as I anticipate their jovial, mocking curiosity.

Without thinking properly, I reply angrily, “Not a bit of it.”","He meant well, the good, loyal fellow, but he shouldn’t have made it so easy for me to say ‘No’.

"Entsetzlich war dieser Ton, entsetzlich dies völlige Sichaufgeben. Noch immer den Blick starr ins Leere gerichtet, tappte er, ohne niederzuschauen, mit der Hand die Tischplatte entlang nach der Brille. Aber er stülpte sie nicht vor die steinernen Augen – wozu noch sehen? wozu noch leben? – sondern stopfte sie ungelenk in die Tasche. Abermals wanderten die bläulichen Finger (in denen Condor den Tod gesehen) rings um den Tisch, bis sie am Rande endlich auch den schwarzen zerknüllten Hut ertasteten. Dann erst wandte er sich zum Gehen und murmelte, ohne mich anzuschauen:","This tone was horrible, this complete surrender horrible.

Once again those blue-tinged fingers (Condor had seen their colour as a sign of death) wandered around the table until they finally found his crumpled black hat as well. Only then did he turn to go, murmuring without looking at me, “Please forgive me for troubling you.”","It was terrible, this tone, this utter resignation. Still staring fixedly into empty space, he groped along the table-top, without looking down for his spectacles. But he did not place them before his stony eyes — what was the point of seeing any more, of living any more? — he thrust them clumsily into his pocket.

"Doch nun sprach Condor nicht mehr, jetzt schrie er mich geradewegs an, und zwar derart zornig und hemmungslos laut, daß in der leeren Gasse zwei verspätete Spaziergänger sich neugierig umwandten,","But now Condor didn't speak any more, now he shouted straight at me, so angry and so loudly that two late walkers in the empty alley turned curiously,","However, Condor was not speaking any more, he positively shouted in my face now, in such a loud and angry voice that two people out walking late in the otherwise deserted street turned to look at us curiously.","But at this point Condor no longer spoke, he positively shouted at me, so indignantly and hysterically, moreover, that two belated passers-by turned and looked at us curiously."
"In mir regte sich plötzlich ein Widerstand. Mich ärgerte dieses Mich-einbeziehen. Ich war doch gekommen, um mich freizumachen. So unterbrach ich entschieden:",I suddenly felt resistance. This involving me annoyed me. I had come to set myself free. So I decided to interrupt:,"I felt sudden resistance. I didn’t like the way he was dragging me into it. After all, I had come here to shake off the whole entanglement. So I interrupted him firmly.","A feeling of rebellion suddenly assailed me. I was furious at being dragged into the affair. After all, I’d come here to free myself. ‘I’m entirely of your opinion,’ I broke in resolutely."
"Sie hatte die großen nassen Flecken auf meinem Rock bemerkt; schuldbewußt mußte sie sich erinnert haben, daß nur die in ihrem Sturz mitgerissenen Tassen dies kleine Malheur verursacht haben konnten. Sofort flüchteten ihre Augen unter die Lider, die schon ausgestreckte Hand zog sich verängstigt zurück. Aber gerade daß sie diese läppische Kleinigkeit so ernst nahm, wirkte auf mich ergreifend; um sie zu beruhigen, nahm ich zu einem lockeren Ton Zuflucht.","She had noticed the large wet stains on my skirt; She must have remembered guiltily that only the cups that had been swept away in her fall could have caused this little mishap. Immediately her eyes fled under the lids, the hand that was already outstretched drew back in fear. But the very fact that she took this silly little thing so seriously affected me; to reassure her, I resorted to a casual tone.","She had noticed the large damp patch on my tunic. Guiltily, she must have remembered that only the cups swept off the table as she fell could have caused that little accident. Her eyes immediately disappeared under hooded lids; her hand, already stretched out, shrank back in alarm. Because she took the silly little incident so seriously, I felt impelled to soothe her, and took refuge in a jocular tone of voice.","She had noticed the great damp patch on my tunic, and must have realized with a pang of guilt that she alone could have been responsible for the mishap, which had occurred when she had brought the cups crashing down with her in her fall. Her eyes withdrew beneath their lids, and the outstretched hand was timidly withdrawn. But the very fact that she took such a foolish trifle so seriously moved me, and, in order to calm her, I took refuge in a playful tone."
"Nicht daran denken, – man will es doch selbst und löscht das Licht, weil Licht alle Gedanken zu wach, zu wirklich macht. Man sucht unterzukriechen, sich zu verstecken im Dunkel, man reißt die Kleider vom Leibe, um freier zu atmen, man wirft sich hin auf das Bett, um sich fühlloser zu machen. Aber die Gedanken, sie ruhen nicht mit, wie Fledermäuse wirr und gespenstisch umflattern sie die ermatteten Sinne, gierig wie Ratten knabbern und wühlen sie sich durch die bleierne Müdigkeit. Je ruhiger man liegt, um so unruhiger wird das Erinnern, um so erregender die flackernden Bilder im Dunkeln; so steht man wieder auf und macht neuerdings Licht, um die Gespenster zu scheuchen. Aber das erste Ding, das die Lampe feindselig faßt, ist das helle Viereck des Briefs, und um den Stuhl hängt die Bluse, die befleckte, alles erinnert und mahnt. Nicht daran denken – man will es doch selbst und kein Wille vermag’s. So irrt man im Zimmer hin und her und her und hin, reißt den Kasten auf und im Kasten die Laden, eine nach der andern, bis man die kleine Glashülse findet mit einem Schlafmittel und hinwankt zu dem Bett. Aber es gibt keine Flucht. Selbst in den Traum wühlen sich, die schwarze Schale des Schlafs durchnagend, die rastlosen Ratten der schwarzen Gedanken, immer dieselben, immer dieselben, und da man morgens erwacht, fühlt man sich wie ausgehöhlt und ausgeblutet von Vampiren.","Don't think about it - one wants to do it oneself and turns off the light, because light makes all thoughts too awake, too real. One tries to crawl under, to hide oneself in the dark, one rips one's clothes from one's body to breathe more freely, one throws oneself on the bed to make oneself less sensitive. But the thoughts don't rest, they flutter confusedly and ghostly around the exhausted senses like bats, greedily like rats they nibble and root through the leaden weariness. The quieter one lies, the more restless the memory becomes, the more exciting the flickering images in the dark; so you get up again and turn on the light again to scare away the ghosts. But the first thing that the lamp grabs hostilely is the bright square of the letter, and the blouse hangs around the chair, the stained one reminding and admonishing everything. Don't think about it - you want it yourself and no will can do it. So you stray back and forth in the room, tearing open the box and the drawers in the box, one after the other, until you find the little glass case with a sleeping pill and stagger to the bed. But there is no escape. Even in the dream, gnawing through the black shell of sleep, the restless rats of black thoughts burrow, always the same, always the same, and waking up in the morning feeling hollowed out and bled dry by vampires.","Think no more of it—exactly what I want myself, and I put out the light, because light keeps all ideas too vivid and wakeful. I want to crawl away and hide in the dark. I tear off all my clothes to breathe more easily, I throw myself on the bed hoping to feel less. But my thoughts will not let me rest. They flutter around my tired mind in confusion, like bats in their ghostly flight, greedy as rats nibbling and making their way through my leaden weariness. The more quietly I lie, the more restless are my memories, conjuring up flickering images in the darkness. So I get up again and put the light on once more to banish the ghosts. But the first thing that the lamplight, maliciously, falls on is the pale blue rectangle of the letter, and over the chair hangs my tea-stained tunic, a reminder and a warning. Think no more of it—exactly what I want myself, but it can’t be done by willpower. So I wander up and down the room, back and forth, flinging open cupboards and the drawers in the cupboards one by one until I find the little glass container with my sleeping pills in it, and I stagger back to bed. But there is no escape. Even in dreams the scrabbling rats of my dark thoughts are on the move, gnawing at the black dish of sleep, always the same thoughts, always the same, and when I wake up in the morning I feel as if vampires had gutted me and sucked my blood dry.","Think no more about it — that is just what you yourself would like to be able to do, and you put out the light, because light makes all your thoughts too vivid, too real. You try to creep away, to hide yourself in the dark, you tear the clothes from your body so as to breathe more freely, you throw yourself on your bed to try and deaden all feeling. But your thoughts, they will not rest; they flutter like bats in ghostly confusion round and round the exhausted brain, they gnaw and nibble their way like rats through your leaden weariness. The more quietly you lie there, the more restless is your memory, the more agitating the flickering pictures in the dark; and so you get up and light the lamp again to scare away the ghosts. But the first thing that the lamp cruelly seizes upon is the bright square envelope of the letter, and there on the back of the chair hangs your tunic, the one stained by the tea; everything reminds and admonishes you. Think no more about it — you yourself don’t want to think about it, but it’s beyond your will to do otherwise. And so you pace up and down the room, to and fro, fling open the cupboard and the drawers in the cupboard, one after another, until you find the little glass ampoule containing a sleeping-draught and then stagger back to bed. But there is no escape. The dark thoughts, those restless rats, gnawing their way through the black shell of sleep, burrow even into your dreams, the same thoughts over and over again, and when you awake in the morning you feel as though you have been drained and sucked dry by vampires."
"»Ach so – richtig! Verzeihen Sie … dann konnten Sie’s natürlich nicht konstatieren … Aber ich, der ich ihn seit Jahren kenne, war für mein Teil heute ehrlich erschrocken, als ich zufällig auf seine Hände sah; ist Ihnen nicht aufgefallen, wie durchsichtig und knöchrig die sind – wissen Sie, wenn man viele Hände von Toten gesehen hat, dann bestürzt einen immer diese gewisse Art bläulicher Farbe an einer lebendigen Hand. Und dann … seine rasche Rührseligkeit gefällt mir nicht: bei dem geringsten Gefühl werden ihm die Augen feucht, bei dem kleinsten Sich-Ängstigen lischt ihm die Farbe aus. Gerade bei Männern, die früher so griffig und energisch waren wie Kekesfalva, wirkt ein solches Sich-Nachgeben bedenklich. Leider, es bedeutet nichts Gutes, wenn harte Menschen mit einmal weich werden – ja sogar, daß sie plötzlich gütig werden, seh ich nicht gern. Etwas klappt, etwas hält dann innen nicht mehr zusammen. Natürlich – ich nehm’s mir schon lang vor, ihn einmal gründlich zu untersuchen – ich trau mich nur nicht recht an ihn heran. Denn, mein Gott, wenn man ihn jetzt noch auf den Gedanken brächte, daß er selber krank ist, und gar auf den Gedanken, er könnte sterben und sein Kind lahm zurücklassen, das wär überhaupt nicht auszudenken! Er unterminiert sich ohnehin schon mit diesem ewigen Drandenken, mit dieser rasenden Ungeduld … Nein, nein, Herr Leutnant, Sie haben mich mißverstanden – nicht Edith, sondern er bereitet mir die Hauptsorge … ich fürchte, der alte Mann macht es nicht mehr lang.«","“Oh, right! Forgive me... then of course you couldn't confirm it... But I, who have known him for years, was honestly shocked for my part today when I happened to look at his hands; Didn't you notice how transparent and bony they are -- you know, when you've seen a lot of dead hands, that certain kind of bluish color on a living hand always strikes you. And then... I don't like his quick sentimentality: the slightest feeling makes his eyes water, the slightest fright turns his color out. Especially with men who used to be as energetic and energetic as Kekesfalva, such a yielding seems questionable. Unfortunately, it's not a good thing when hard people suddenly become soft - I don't even like to see them suddenly become kind. Something works, something then no longer holds together inside. Of course - I've made up my mind for a long time to examine him thoroughly - I just don't quite dare to approach him. Because, my God, if you could get him to think that he himself is ill, and even to the thought that he could die and leave his child lame behind, that would be inconceivable! He’s already undermining himself with this constant reminder, with this raging impatience… No, no, Herr Lieutenant, you misunderstood me – not Edith, he’s my main concern… I’m afraid the old man won’t last much longer.”","“Oh, I see. Forgive me … then of course you couldn’t have seen the change … But I’ve known him for years, and speaking for myself I was genuinely horrified when I happened to look at his hands today. Have you noticed how translucent and bony they are? You know, when a doctor has seen the hands of many dead people, it’s always distressing to see that particular bluish colour on a living hand. And then—I don’t like to see him so quickly moved to emotion. His eyes fill with tears at the least little thing, the slightest new fear drains the colour from his face. It’s particularly alarming to see a man who used to be as thrusting and energetic as Kekesfalva giving up like that. I’m afraid it doesn’t bode well when hard men suddenly turn soft—I don’t even like to see them become kindly. It shows that something’s wrong, something inside them has given way. Of course, for some time I’ve intended to give him a thorough examination—only I just don’t trust myself to broach the subject to him. Because my God, suppose I start him thinking of himself as ill now, let alone thinking that he might die and leave his crippled child behind … well, I don’t like to imagine it! He’s undermining his own health anyway by all that brooding of his, his headlong impatience … no, no. Lieutenant Hofmiller, you misunderstood me. I’m far more worried about him than Edith … I’m afraid the old man won’t last much longer.”","‘Ah — quite so. Forgive me ... in that case you can’t have noticed ... But I, who’ve known him for years, was really alarmed today when I happened to glance at his hands. Hasn’t it struck you how transparent and bony they are? When one has frequently seen the hands of dead people, you know, that sort of bluish colour on a living hand always dismays one. And then too — I don’t much like those bursts of sentimentality; the slightest emotion brings the tears to his eyes, the colour leaves his cheeks the moment he begins to worry. It is precisely on men like Kekesfalva, who have in the past been so energetic and ruthless, that giving way to their feelings has such a grave effect. Unfortunately it’s not a good sign when hard men suddenly go soft — yes, I don’t even like to see them grow kind-hearted all of a sudden. Of course, I’ve been meaning for a long time to give him a thorough examination, only I can’t really trust myself to get down to it. For, good God, if one were ever to put the idea into his head that he himself were ill, and the idea, into the bargain, that he might die and leave his child behind a cripple — why, it simply won’t bear thinking of! He’s undermining his own health in any case with this eternal brooding, this frantic impatience ... Really, Herr Leutnant, you misunderstood me — it’s not Edith, but he who is my chief concern ... I’m afraid the old man’s not long for this world.’"
"»Natürlich, wie sollen Sie ihn kennen, Sie sind ja ein gesunder Mensch, und er gehört nicht zu denen, die von sich viel Wesens machen … er ist auch gar nicht Professor, nicht einmal Dozent … ich glaub auch nicht, daß er eine gute Praxis hat … das heißt, er sucht keine große Praxis. Er ist eben ein merkwürdiger, ein ganz besonderer Mensch … ich weiß nicht, ob ich’s Ihnen recht erklären kann. Ihn interessieren nicht die gewöhnlichen Fälle, nicht, was jeder Bader behandeln kann … ihn interessieren nur die schweren Fälle, nur die, an denen die andern Ärzte mit Achselzucken vorübergehen. Ich kann natürlich nicht, ich ungebildeter Mensch, behaupten, daß Doktor Condor ein besserer Arzt ist als die andern … nur das weiß ich, daß er ein besserer Mensch ist als die andern. Ich hab ihn zum erstenmal kennengelernt, damals, bei meiner Frau, und gesehen, wie er gekämpft hat um sie … Er war der einzige, der bis zum letzten Augenblick nicht nachgeben wollte, und damals hab ich’s gespürt – dieser Mensch lebt und stirbt mit jedem Kranken mit. Er hat, ich weiß nicht, ob ich mich richtig ausdrücke … er hat eben irgendeine Passion, stärker zu sein als die Krankheit … nicht wie die andern bloß den Ehrgeiz, sein Geld zu kriegen und Professor und Hofrat zu werden … er denkt eben nicht von sich aus, sondern von dem andern her, von dem Leidenden … oh, er ist ein wunderbarer Mensch!«","""Of course, how are you supposed to know him, you're a healthy person and he's not one of those people who make a fuss about himself ... he's not even a professor, not even a lecturer ...

Of course, I, an uneducated person, cannot claim that Doctor Condor is a better doctor than the others ... I only know that he is a better person than the others. I met him for the first time back then, with my wife, and saw how he fought for her...

You’re a healthy man, and he’s not one to go around all puffed up. He’s not a university professor, not even a lecturer.

I first met him when … when my wife … and I saw how he fought for her life.

He has … I don’t know if I’m expressing it well … he has a kind of passion to be stronger than the illness. He’s not like the others, the doctors whose only ambition is to get their fees and be professors and get awarded distinctions.

You’re in perfect health, and he’s not one of those who throws his weight about. He doesn’t hold a university post. I don’t believe he has a big practice, either ... that is, he isn’t out for a big practice. He is really a remarkable, a most uncommon man. I don’t know exactly how to explain it to you. He’s not interested in ordinary cases, the kind that can be treated by any sawbones ... he’s only interested in severe cases that other doctors give up with a shrug of the shoulders. I can’t, of course, uneducated as I am, affirm that Dr Condor is a better doctor than other doctors. I only know that he is a better man. I got to know him first when my wife was ill, and I saw how he fought for her life. He was the only one who refused to give up hope until the very last, and I realized then that here was a man who lived and died with every one of his patients.

"›Das hat doch keinen Sinn‹, sagte er beinahe heftig. ›Man soll nicht bei Verwandten wohnen, das tut nie gut. Und dann, Sie haben’s doch nicht mehr nötig, sich in einem solchen kleinen Nest zu vergraben.‹","'There's no point in that,' he said almost vehemently. 'You shouldn't live with relatives, that's never good. And then, you don't have to bury yourself in such a little nest anymore.'","“‘But there’s no sense in that,’ he said almost with vehemence. ‘Living with distant relations is never a good idea.

"Ich trat durch die lautlos nachgebende Tür. Auf den ersten Blick gewahrte ich im weiträumigen Zimmer, das die orangefarbenen Vorhänge vollkommen gegen die Gartenseite abdunkelten, nichts als rötliche Dämmerung; dann erst unterschied ich im Hintergrund das hellere Rechteck eines Betts. Schüchtern kam von dort die wohlbekannte Stimme:","I stepped through the silently yielding door. At first glance I saw nothing but reddish twilight in the spacious room, which the orange curtains completely darkened from the garden side; Only then did I distinguish the lighter rectangle of a bed in the background. The well-known voice came shyly from there:","The door opened without a sound, and I went in. At first glance all I could see in the large room, its windows darkened on the garden side by orange curtains drawn over them, was a reddish twilight. Only then could I make out the rectangular shape of a bed in the background. Diffidently, Edith’s familiar voice spoke.","I pushed open the door, which yielded noiselessly to my touch. At first I could see nothing in the vast room but reddish twilight, for the orange curtains were drawn to shut out the light on the garden side; and only after a moment was I able to make out in the background the lighter rectangle of a bed, from which a familiar voice issued shyly."
"Ein Anfall, ist mein erster Gedanke. Ein Schlaganfall, er ist ja herzkrank, Condor hat es mir gesagt. Entsetzt springe ich hin, um ihm aufzuhelfen und ihn auf das Sofa zu betten. Aber in diesem Moment gewahre ich – der alte Mann ist gar nicht gestürzt, gar nicht herabgefallen vom Sessel. Er hat sich selber herabgestoßen. Er ist – im ersten erregten Zuspringen war dies mir völlig entgangen – absichtlich in die Knie gesunken und jetzt, da ich ihn aufheben will, rutscht er näher heran, packt meine Hände und bettelt:","A seizure is my first thought. A stroke, he has a heart condition, Condor told me. Horrified, I jump to help him up and put him on the sofa. But at this moment I realize - the old man didn't fall at all, didn't fall off the chair at all. He pushed himself down. He has deliberately dropped to his knees - I had completely missed this in the first excited leaping - and now that I want to pick him up, he scoots closer, grabs my hands and begs:","My first reaction is—it’s a heart attack. A stroke or a heart attack; after all, Condor told me he has a weak heart. Horrified, I make haste to help him up. But next moment I realise that the old man didn’t fall off the chair, he pushed himself off it. As I moved quickly to help him, I failed to notice it at first, but he sank from the chair to his knees on purpose and now, as I try to raise him, he moves closer to me, takes my hands and begs me, “You must help her … you are the only one who can help her … Condor says so too, only you, no one else!","A fit, was my first thought, a stroke. Condor had told me he had a weak heart. Horror-struck, I rushed to lift him up and lay him on the sofa. But as I did so I realized that the old man had not really fallen from his chair, he had thrown himself down. He had deliberately sunk to his knees — in my first start of dismay I had failed to notice this. As I now went to raise him up, he shuffled nearer to me, and seized my hands."
"»Und nun hören Sie, Herr Leutnant. Ich wollte Sie doch um etwas bitten. Ich sagte Ihnen schon, was für ein anteilnehmender Mensch dieser Doktor Condor ist … Aber sehen Sie, verstehen Sie … gerade, daß er so ein guter Mensch ist, das beunruhigt mich auch … Ich fürchte immer, verstehen Sie … ich fürchte, daß er aus Rücksicht auf mich mir nicht die Wahrheit sagt, nicht die ganze Wahrheit … Immer verspricht und vertröstet er, es würde bestimmt besser, ganz gesund würde das Kind werden … aber immer, wenn ich ihn genau frage, wann denn, und wie lange wird es noch dauern, dann weicht er aus und sagt bloß: Geduld, Geduld! Aber man muß doch eine Gewißheit haben … ich bin ein alter, ein kranker Mann, ich muß doch wissen, ob ich’s noch erlebe und ob sie überhaupt gesund wird, ganz gesund … nein, glauben Sie mir, Herr Leutnant, ich kann nicht mehr so leben … ich muß wissen, ob es sicher ist, daß sie geheilt wird und wann … ich muß es wissen, ich ertrag diese Unsicherheit nicht länger.«","“And now listen, Herr Leutnant.

But one has to be certain... I'm an old, sick man, I have to know whether I'll still live to see it and whether she'll get well at all, quite well... no, believe me, Herr Lieutenant, I can't do that anymore live...I need to know if it's safe for her to be cured and when...I need to know, I can't take this uncertainty any longer.""","“So now please listen, Lieutenant Hofmiller. You remember I wanted to ask you something.

He’s always consoling me, promising me that my child is sure to get better, she’ll be cured some day, but whenever I ask him more closely when, how much longer it will be, he avoids answering and just says: ‘Patience, patience!’ But I need to be certain … I’m an old man, a sick man, I have to know whether I shall live to see it and whether she will get well at all, really well. Believe me, Lieutenant Hofmiller, I can’t live like this any longer … I have to know if she is certain to get better, and when it will be … I have to know , I can’t bear this uncertainty any more.”","‘And now listen, Herr Leutnant.

I’m always afraid that out of consideration for my feelings he won’t tell me the truth, the whole truth. He’s always promising me and assuring me that there’s definite improvement, constant improvement, and that the child will eventually get quite well. But whenever I ask him point blank how long it will take, he is evasive and merely says, “Patience, patience”. But I must have certainty. I am an old, a sick man, and I must know if I shall live to see her recover, and if she is ever going to get well, quite well ... No, believe me, Herr Leutnant, I can’t go on like this.

"»Selbstverständlich«, sagte ich mechanisch; es war das erste Wort, das ich während seines ganzen Berichts über die Lippen brachte. Ich war wie betäubt – nicht allein von den überraschenden Enthüllungen, die meine ganzen Vorstellungen von Kekesfalva von außen nach innen umwendeten wie einen Handschuh; ich war gleichzeitig auch betroffen über meine eigene Dumpfheit und Torheit. Mit so seichten Augen war ich also in meinem fünfundzwanzigsten Jahr noch durch die Welt gegangen! Wochenlang täglicher Gast in diesem Hause, hatte ich, ganz eingenebelt in mein Mitleid, aus dummer Diskretion niemals gewagt, mich zu erkundigen, weder nach der Krankheit selbst, noch nach der Mutter, die doch sichtlich in diesem Hause fehlte, nicht gefragt, woher der Reichtum dieses sonderbaren Menschen stammte. Wie hatte ich übersehen können, daß diese verhangenen, mandelförmigen, melancholischen Augen nicht die eines ungarischen Aristokraten waren, sondern der von tausend Jahren tragischen Kampfes geschärfte und zugleich ermüdete Blick der jüdischen Rasse? Wie nicht wahrnehmen, daß in Edith wiederum andere Elemente gemischt waren, wie nicht erkennen, daß etwas in diesem Hause gespenstisch von sonderbaren Vergangenheiten belastet sein mußte? Blitzschnell fielen eine Reihe Einzelheiten mir nun verspätet ein: mit welchem kalten Blick unser Oberst einmal bei einer Begegnung Kekesfalvas Gruß von sich weggeschoben hatte, gerade zwei Finger halb an die Kappe hebend, oder wie die Kameraden an Kaffeehaustisch ihn einen »alten Manichäer« genannt. Mir war zumute, wie wenn plötzlich in einem dunklen Zimmer ein Vorhang aufgerissen wird und die Sonne dringt einem so jäh in die Augen, daß sie purpurn schwirren, und man taumelt unter dem grellen Prall dieses durch sein Übermaß unerträglichen Lichts.","""Of course,"" I said mechanically; it was the first word I uttered throughout his report. I was stunned - not just by the startling revelations, which turned my whole idea of Kekesfalva inside out like a glove; I was struck at the same time by my own dullness and folly. In my twenty-fifth year I went through the world with such shallow eyes! For weeks a daily guest in this house, I, completely fogged in my pity, out of stupid discretion, never dared to inquire, neither about the illness itself nor about the mother, who was obviously missing in this house, did not ask where it came from wealth of this strange man came. How could I have overlooked the fact that those overcast, almond-shaped, melancholy eyes were not those of a Hungarian aristocrat, but the gaze of the Jewish race, sharpened and at the same time weary by a thousand years of tragic struggle? How not to perceive that other elements were mixed in Edith, how not to recognize that something in this house must be haunted by strange pasts? A number of details came to me belatedly in a flash: the cold look with which our colonel had once brushed Kekesfalva’s greeting away from him during an encounter, just lifting two fingers halfway to his cap, or how the comrades at the coffee-house table called him an “old Manichaean”. I felt as if a curtain were suddenly thrown open in a dark room and the sun bursts into your eyes so suddenly that they tingle purple, and you stagger under the glaring impact of this unbearable light.","“Of course,” I said automatically. Those were the first words to pass my lips during his entire account. I was feeling numbed—not just by the surprising revelations that turned my ideas of Kekesfalva inside out like a glove; at the same time I was also dismayed by my own short-sighted folly. Had I still been going through the world with such a superficial view of it in my twenty-fifth year? As a daily guest in that house for weeks, and bemused by my own sense of sympathy, had I never ventured, out of some stupid notion of discretion, to ask either about Edith’s disorder itself or about her mother, who was obviously sorely missed in that household? Had I never asked where that strange man Kekesfalva’s wealth came from? How could I have missed seeing that those hooded, almond-shaped, melancholy eyes were not the eyes of a Hungarian aristocrat, but of a member of the Jewish race, made keener and at the same time weary by a thousand years of tragic struggle? How had I failed to see that very different elements mingled in Edith , how had I not recognised that something in that house must be under the spell of past events? Like lightning, a whole series of details now belatedly occurred to me—the coldness with which our colonel had once responded to Kekesfalva’s greeting when they met, a mere two fingers half lifted to his cap? Or how my comrades at the table in the café had spoken of him as “that old Manichaean”? It was like having a curtain suddenly drawn back in a dark room, when the sun shines in your eyes so suddenly that they see a crimson blur, and your senses reel in that excess of unbearable radiance.","‘Of course,’ I said mechanically, and those were the first words that passed my lips during the whole of this story. Not only did I feel stunned by his astounding revelations, which had turned my whole idea of Kekesfalva inside out like a glove; but I was also appalled at my own obtuseness and stupidity. To think that I had been going about the world at the age of twenty-five with such unseeing eyes! During all these weeks I had been a daily visitor to the house, and, befogged by my own pity, I had refrained, out of a stupid feeling of delicacy, from ever asking either about Edith’s illness or about the mother who was so obviously missed in the house, had never asked how this curious old man had come by his wealth. How could I have failed to see that those veiled, almond-shaped, melancholy eyes were not those of a Hungarian aristocrat, but that their keen yet weary gaze reflected the age-long tragic struggle of the Jewish race? How had I failed to perceive that in Edith yet other elements were mingled, how failed to realize that over this house hung the spectral shadow of a strange past? In a flash I now called to mind a whole series of minor incidents, remembered with what a frosty stare our Colonel had on one occasion dismissed Herr Kekesfalva’s greeting, merely raising two fingers half-way to his cap, and how my friends had talked of the ‘old Manichaean’. I felt as one does when the curtains in a dark room are suddenly drawn aside, and the sunlight is so blinding that everything swims purple before one’s eyes and one reels in the dazzling glare of the almost inconceivable flood of light."
"»Ach ja, natürlich«, sagte ich scheinbar lässig. »Das hätte ich beinahe vergessen.«","""Oh yes, of course,"" I said, seemingly nonchalantly. ""I almost forgot.""","“Yes, of course,” I said, apparently casually. “I almost forgot.”","‘Ah yes, of course!’ I said with apparent nonchalance. ‘I had nearly forgotten that.’"
"»Ganz zu deiner Verfügung. Wäre noch schöner, wenn man keine Zeit hätt für einen Kameraden. Willst herunten im Restaurant, oder gehen wir hinauf auf mein Zimmer?«","“Your disposal. Would be even nicer if you didn't have time for a comrade. Do you want to go down to the restaurant, or shall we go up to my room?'","“Entirely at your disposal.

"Und schon reißen die Ordonnanzen die Tür auf, schon treten sporenklirrend die Stabsoffiziere ein. Wir krachen alle von unseren Sitzen auf und stehen einen Augenblick »Habtacht«. Der Oberst setzt sich zur Rechten, der rangälteste Major zur Linken Balinkays, und sofort wird die Tafel animiert, Teller klirren, Löffel klappern, alles schwätzt und schlürft lebhaft durcheinander. Nur ich sitze in einer Art Abwesenheit inmitten der aufgelockerten Kameraden und taste immer wieder an den Rock über der Stelle, wo etwas hämmert und pocht wie ein zweites Herz. Durch das weiche, nachgiebige Tuch spüre ich jedesmal beim Hingreifen den Brief knistern wie ein angefachtes Feuer; ja, er ist da, er rührt, er regt sich ganz nah an meiner Brust wie etwas Lebendiges, und während die andern gemächlich schwatzen und schmatzen, kann ich an nichts als an diesen Brief denken und die verzweifelte Not des Menschen, der ihn geschrieben.","And the orderlies rip open the door and the staff officers enter, spurs jingling. We all slump out of our seats and stand at attention for a moment. The colonel sits on Balinkay's right, the most senior major on Balinkay's left, and immediately the table is animated, plates clinking, spoons clattering, everyone is chattering and slurping animatedly. Only I sit in a kind of absence amidst the relaxed comrades and keep touching my skirt over the spot where something is pounding and pounding like a second heart. Through the soft, yielding cloth I feel the letter crackle like a fanned fire every time I reach for it; yes, it is there, it moves, it stirs very close to my breast like something alive, and while the others chatter leisurely and smack their lips, I can think of nothing but this letter and the desperate need of the person who wrote it.","And the orderlies are already opening the door for the staff officers, who come in with spurs clinking. We all rise from our chairs and stand briefly to attention. The Colonel sits down to Balinkay’s right, the highest-ranking major to his left, and at once the table becomes animated, plates clink, spoons clatter, everyone is eating and drinking, they’re all talking at once, deep in lively conversation. Only I sit among my cheerful comrades almost as if I weren’t there at all, putting my hand to my tunic over the place where something thuds and hammers like a second heart. Whenever I do so I feel the letter rustling through the soft, yielding fabric as if a fire were being fanned; yes, there it is, moving close to my breast like something alive, and while the others talk and feast at their leisure, all I can do is think of that letter, and the desperate distress of the girl who wrote it.","And now the orderlies flung open the doors; the Colonel and his staff entered, their spurs jingling. We all rose and stood for a moment at attention. The Colonel sat down on Balinkay’s right, the senior Major on his left, and the whole table instantly became animated; plates clattered, spoons rattled, everyone chattered away and fell to with a will. I alone sat in a kind of trance amidst my jovial companions and kept feeling for the place where, beneath my tunic, something was hammering and thumping away like a second heart. Every time I touched it I could feel the letter crackling through the soft, yielding cloth like the flames of a newly kindled fire; yes, it was there, it moved and stirred close to my breast like a living thing, and while the others babbled away happily over their food I could think of nothing but the letter and the desperate plight of the girl who had written it."
"»Ja«, antwortete ich unbedenklich, und erschrak schon im selben Augenblick über das rasche Wort. »Das heißt …«, fügte ich vorsichtig bei, »ich würde ihr den ganzen Sachverhalt erst eingestehen, sobald sie wenigstens etwas vorwärtsgekommen ist … Verzeihen Sie, Herr Doktor … es klingt ziemlich unbescheiden … aber Sie haben nicht so wie ich in der letzten Zeit beobachten können, wie notwendig diese Menschen etwas brauchen, um sich weiterzuhelfen und … gewiß, man muß ihr die Wahrheit sagen … aber doch erst, wenn sie sie ertragen kann … nicht jetzt, Herr Doktor, ich beschwöre Sie … nur nicht jetzt … nur nicht sofort.«","""Yes,"" I answered without hesitation, and at the same moment I was startled by the hasty word. 'That means,' I added cautiously, 'I wouldn't tell her the whole thing until she's made at least a little progress... Forgive me, Doctor... it sounds rather immodest... but you haven't been like me lately to be able to observe how urgently these people need something to help themselves and... of course, you have to tell them the truth... but only when they can bear it... not now, Doctor, I beg you... just not now... just not right away.""","“Yes,” I replied without thinking, and instantly took fright at my quick reply. “I mean …” I added cautiously, “I wouldn’t confess the whole thing to her until she has at least made some progress … forgive me, doctor, it sounds rather presumptuous of me, but you haven’t had a chance of seeing how much she needs something to help her, as I have recently … and yes, she must be told the truth … but only when she can bear it, not now, doctor, I beg you … not now, not at once.”","‘Yes,’ I answered without hesitation, and the very next moment was startled at my own precipitancy. ‘That is to say ...’ I added cautiously, ‘I should admit the true state of affairs when she had at least made some progress ... Forgive me, Herr Doktor ... it sounds somewhat presumptuous ... but you have not had the opportunity I have had of observing during the last few weeks how essential it is for these invalids to have something to help them on, and ... Yes, she must be told the truth ... but only when she is able to bear it ... not now, Herr Doktor. I beseech you ... not now ... not immediately.’"
»Genug! Geben Sie mir eine Zigarette!«,"""Enough! Give me a cigarette!'","“Oh, that’s enough! Give me a cigarette!”",‘That’s enough! Give me a cigarette.’
"»Ja«, antwortete ich, »ich bitte Sie darum.«","""Yes,"" I replied, ""I beg you.""","“Yes,” I said. “Please do that.”","‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘please do.’"
"Und jetzt zu Ihnen! Am bequemsten für mich wäre natürlich, die ganze Schuld auf Sie abzuschieben. Zu sagen, Sie hätten mich mißverstanden, Sie hätten übertrieben oder phantasiert. Nun, das werde ich nicht tun, sondern lieber alles auf meine Kappe nehmen. Nur – das sage ich Ihnen gleich – ganz kann ich Sie nicht aus dem Spiel lassen. Sie kennen den alten Mann und seine schreckliche Zähigkeit. Wenn ich ihm auch hundertmal die Sache erklärte und den Brief zeigte, würde er immer von neuem jammern: ›Aber Sie haben doch dem Herrn Leutnant versprochen …‹ und ›Herr Leutnant hat doch gesagt …‹ – Ununterbrochen würde er sich auf Sie berufen, um sich und mir vorzutäuschen, es bestehe trotz alledem noch irgendwelche Hoffnung. Ohne Sie als Zeugen werde ich mit ihm nicht fertig. Illusionen kann man nicht so leicht herunterschütteln wie das Quecksilber im Thermometer. Hat man einmal einem jener Kranken, die man so grausamerweise unheilbar nennt, einen Strohhalm Hoffnung gezeigt, so zimmert er sich sofort daraus einen Balken und aus dem Balken ein ganzes Haus. Aber derlei Luftschlösser sind höchst ungesund für Kranke, und es ist meine Pflicht als Arzt, dieses Luftschloß schleunigst umzulegen, ehe sich exaltierte Hoffnungen drin heimisch machen. Wir müssen unbedingt die Sache scharf angehen und ohne Zeit zu verlieren.«","And now to you! Of course, the most convenient thing would be for me to shift all the blame onto you. To say you misunderstood me, you exaggerated or fantasized. Well, I won't do that, I'd rather take it all on my own. But - I'll tell you right away - I can't completely leave you out of the game. You know the old man and his terrible toughness. Even if I explained the matter to him a hundred times and showed him the letter, he would wail again and again: 'But you promised the lieutenant ...' and 'But the lieutenant said ...' - he would constantly refer to you, to to pretend to himself and to me that in spite of everything there is still some hope. I can't deal with him without you as a witness. Illusions are not as easy to shake off as the mercury in the thermometer. Once you have shown a straw of hope to one of those sick people who are so cruelly called incurable, he immediately builds a beam out of it, and from the beam a whole house. But such castles in the air are extremely unhealthy for the sick, and it is my duty as a doctor to throw down this castle in the air as quickly as possible before exalted hopes take root in it. It is imperative that we approach this matter sharply and without wasting any time.”","“And now to you. Of course the most comfortable thing for me would be to lay all the blame on you, to say you misunderstood me, you were exaggerating, or imagining things.

If I were to explain to him a hundred times, and show him Professor Viennot’s letter, he would still be protesting, ‘But you promised Lieutenant Hofmiller … and Lieutenant Hofmiller said … ’ He would be citing you the whole time to pretend to himself, and me, that in spite of everything there was still some kind of hope. Without you to back me up I’ll never convince him. Illusions can’t be shaken off as easily as you shake the quicksilver down in a thermometer. Once you have one of those disorders so cruelly called incurable, you clutch at any straw for hope , see it as a solid plank and then make it a whole house. But such castles in the air are very bad for the sick, and it is my duty as a doctor to demolish them as quickly as I can before high hopes take up residence there. We must strike hard, without losing any time.”","‘And now as to you.

If I were to explain the whole thing to him a hundred times over and to show him the letter, he’d still keep on whining, “But you promised the Herr Leutnant”, and “But the Herr Leutnant said ...” He’d go on quoting you ad infinitum in order to delude himself and me into thinking that despite everything there was still some hope. Without using you as a witness I’ll never convince him. You can’t dispel illusions as easily as you shake down the quicksilver in a thermometer.

Vor zweiundzwanzig Jahren war ich ein junger Student der Medizin, etwa so alt wie Sie heute, gerade im vierten Semester. Da erkrankte mein Vater, bis dahin ein starker, vollkommen gesunder, unermüdlich tätiger Mann, den ich leidenschaftlich liebte und verehrte. Die Ärzte diagnostizierten eine Diabetes, Sie kennen sie wahrscheinlich unter dem Namen Zuckerkrankheit, eine der grausamsten, der heimtückischesten Krankheiten, die einen Menschen überfallen kann. Ohne jeden Anlaß hört der Organismus auf, die Nährstoffe weiter zu verarbeiten, er führt Fett und Zucker nicht mehr dem Körper zu, und dadurch verfällt und verhungert der Kranke eigentlich bei lebendigem Leibe – ich will Sie nicht mit den Einzelheiten quälen, sie haben mir selbst drei Jahre meiner Jugend zerstört.","“Perhaps I am making myself too complicated, too abstract.

Then my father fell ill, until then a strong, perfectly healthy, tirelessly active man, whom I passionately loved and adored. The doctors diagnosed diabetes, you probably know it by the name of diabetes, one of the cruelest, most insidious diseases that can attack a human being.

Vergebens hat er Dich gesucht, in meinem Zimmer und überall, und so weiß ich’s, daß Du geflohen bist vor mir wie vor einem Aussatz, wie vor einer Pest. – Aber nein, Geliebter, nein, keinen Vorwurf, ich verstehe Dich doch! Gerade ich, die ich vor mir selber erschrecke, wenn ich die Klötze sehe an meinen Füßen, nur ich, die ich weiß, wie böse, wie launisch, wie quälerisch, wie schwer erträglich ich geworden bin in meiner Ungeduld, gerade ich kann doch am besten begreifen, daß man vor mir erschrickt – oh, schrecklich gut kann ich’s verstehen, daß man vor mir flüchtet, daß man zurückschauert, wenn solch ein Unwesen einen anfällt. Und doch flehe ich Dich an, daß Du mir verzeihst, denn es ist nicht Tag und nicht Nacht ohne Dich, nur Verzweiflung. Nur einen Zettel, einen kleinen raschen Zettel schick mir oder ein leeres Blatt, eine Blume, aber nur irgendein Zeichen! Nur etwas, woran ich erkenne, daß Du mich nicht wegstößt, daß ich Dir nicht widerlich geworden bin. Bedenk doch, in ein paar Tagen bin ich fort, für Monate fort, in acht, in zehn Tagen ist Deine Qual zu Ende. Und wenn die meine dann auch tausendfach beginnt, die Qual, Dich wochen-, Dich monatelang entbehren zu müssen, so denk nicht dran, denk nur an Dich, wie ich immer an Dich denke, nur an Dich! – In acht Tagen bist Du erlöst – so komm noch einmal und schick mir inzwischen ein Wort, gib mir ein Zeichen! Ich kann nicht denken, nicht atmen, nicht fühlen, solange ich nicht weiß, daß Du mir verziehen hast; ich will, ich kann nicht länger leben, verweigerst Du mir das Recht, Dich zu lieben.«","But no, don't be alarmed, I don't want to threaten you! I don't want to frighten you, I don't want to extort pity instead of your love, the only thing your heart has given me so far. You should feel completely free and carefree - for God's sake I don't want to burden you with my burden, I don't want to weigh you down with a debt of which you are not to blame - I only want one thing: that you forgive and completely forget what happened, forget what I said, what I betrayed. Just give me this reassurance, just this poor little certainty! Tell me right away, a single word is enough for me, that I haven't become disgusting to you, that you'll come back to us as if nothing had happened: you don't suspect my anxiety about losing you. Ever since the door closed behind you, I've been tormented, I don't know why, by a deadly fear that it was the last time. You were so pale that minute, you had such a look of terror in your eyes when I left you that I suddenly felt ice cold in the midst of my glow. And I know - the servant told me - that you immediately fled out of the house; suddenly you were gone and your saber, your cap. He looked for you in vain, in my room and everywhere, and so I know that you fled from me like a leprosy, like a plague. - But no, my love, no, don't blame me, I understand you! Just me, who frightens myself when I see the blocks on my feet, only I, who know how bad, how moody, how tormented, how hard I've become to bear in my impatience, just I can I can best understand that one is frightened by me - oh, I can understand terribly well that one flees from me, that one shudders when such a nuisance attacks one. And yet I beg you to forgive me, for it is neither day nor night without you, only despair. Just a piece of paper, send me a quick little piece of paper, or a blank sheet of paper, a flower, but just any sign! Just something to tell me that you're not pushing me away, that I haven't become disgusting to you. Just think, I'll be gone in a few days, gone for months, in eight or ten days your torment will be over. And when mine then begins a thousand times over, the torment of having to do without you for weeks or months, don't think about it, just think of you, as I always think of you, only of you! – In eight days you will be redeemed – so come again and meanwhile send me a word, give me a sign! I can't think, breathe, feel unless I know you've forgiven me; I want, I can live no longer if you deny me the right to love you.«","Don’t be afraid—that isn’t a threat! I don’t want to alarm you, extort pity from you instead of your love—pity, the one thing your heart has yet given me. I want you to feel entirely carefree— I do not, for God’s sake, want to unload my own burden on you , weigh you down with guilt when you are guilty of nothing—I only want this one thing, for you to forgive what happened and forget it entirely, forget what I said, forget what I let slip. Please just give me that reassurance, that one poor little certainty! Tell me at once—a single word will do—that I am not repellent to you, that you will come and see us again as if nothing had happened. You cannot guess how dreadful I feel at the thought of losing you. Since the door closed behind you I have been tormented by the fear , I don’t know why but it is a mortal fear, that it was closing for the last time. You looked so pale at that moment, there was such fear in your eyes when I let go of you that I suddenly felt icy cold in the midst of my burning heat. And I know—Josef has told me—that you went straight out of the house. All of a sudden you were gone, with your sword and your cap. He looked for you in vain, in my boudoir and everywhere, so I know that you fled from me as if I were the plague or some other dreadful infection. But no, my dearest, I am not blaming you, I understand you entirely! I of all people, afraid of myself when I see those heavy things on my feet , I know how horrible, moody, tormenting, impossible I have become in my impatience. I of all people can understand why you would be afraid of me— oh, I can understand it only too well if people run from me, shudder to think of such a monster near them. And yet I beg you to forgive me, because there is no day or night without you, only despair. Just a note—send me a quick note, or a blank sheet of paper, a flower, any kind of sign! Just something to show me that you are not rejecting me entirely, I have not become a horror to you. Remember that I shall be gone in a few days’ time, gone for months—so in ten days’ time your troubles are over. And if mine then begin again a thousand times over, don’t think of that, think of yourself, just as I am always thinking of you. Another week and you are released—so come to see us just once more, and first send me a word, give me a sign! I can’t think, can’t breathe, can’t feel until I know that you have forgiven me. I will not, cannot go on living if you refuse me the right to love you.","‘But no, don’t be alarmed, I don’t want to threaten you! I don’t want to frighten you, to extort from you, instead of love, pity — the only thing that you have hitherto given me of your own free will.

Give me just this reassurance, just this pitiful little certainty! Tell me now — a word will suffice — that I have not become repugnant to you, that you will come to see us again as though nothing had happened. You can have no idea of how I dread losing you.

And I know — for Josef told me — that you rushed straight out of the house, seized your cap and sword and were off in a moment. He searched for you in vain, in my room and all over the house, and so I know that you fled from me as from the plague, the pest. But no, beloved, I am not reproaching you—I understand. I of all people, who recoil in horror from myself when I see the great weights on my feet, I alone, who know how beastly, how petulant, how impossible, how intolerable I have become in my impatience, I of all people should be able to understand why others should recoil in horror from me. Oh, I can understand only too well why they flee from me, shrink back when they come upon such a monstrosity! And yet I implore you to forgive me, for there is no night and no day without you, but only despair. Send me just a note, a little hurried note, or a blank sheet of paper, a flower — but something, some sign or other. Just something by which I shall know that you are not spurning me, that I have not become repellent to you. Remember that in a few days I shall be going away for months, that in a week or ten days your torture will be at an end. And if mine is increased a thousandfold, the torture of having to do without you for weeks, for months on end, don’t think of that, think only of yourself, as I think always of you, only of you. In a week’s time you will be released — so come again, and in the meantime send me a word, give me a sign. I cannot think, cannot breathe, cannot feel until I know that you have forgiven me.

"Hinschmeißen! Alles hinschmeißen! denke ich mir, während wir wieder in die Stadt zurückreiten. Fort, nur fort, irgendwohin fort, wo niemand einen kennt, wo man frei ist von allem und allem! Weg, nur weg, entkommen, entrinnen! Keinen mehr sehen, sich nicht mehr vergöttern, nicht mehr erniedrigen lassen! Fort, nur fort – unbewußt geht das Wort in den Rhythmus des Trabs über. In der Kaserne werfe ich die Zügel rasch einem Ulanen zu und verlasse sofort den Hof. Ich will nicht bei der Offiziersmesse heute sitzen, will mich weder bespotten und noch weniger mich bemitleiden lassen.","throw away! Drop everything! I think to myself as we ride back into town. Gone, just gone, gone somewhere where no one knows you, where you're free from anything and everything! Away, just away, escape, escape! See no more, no longer idolize, no longer allow yourself to be humiliated! Off, only on - unconsciously the word merges into the rhythm of the trot. In the barracks I quickly throw the reins to a Uhlan and immediately leave the yard. I don't want to sit at the officers' mess today, neither do I want to be ridiculed, still less to be pitied.","Chuck it in! I’ll chuck it all in , I think as we ride back to the town. I’ll get away from here, away, I’ll go somewhere else, I’ll find some place where no one knows me, where I’ll be free of everyone and everything! I just want to get away, away— subconsciously that word becomes part of the rhythm of my trot. Back at the barracks I throw the reins to one of the lancers and leave the yard. I’m not going to eat in the officers’ mess today, I don’t want to be the butt of mockery, still less an object of pity.","To hell with it! To hell with it all! I thought to myself as we rode back to the town. Oh to get away, away, to some place where no one knew me, to be rid of everyone and everything! Oh to get away, to escape, to flee! To see no one any more, never to let oneself be idolized, be humiliated again! Away, away! — the word became part of the rhythm of my horse’s trot. Arrived at the barracks, I hastily threw the reins to an Uhlan and left the courtyard. I was determined not to go into mess today, I was determined not to let myself be jeered at, much less pitied."
"Aber da knisterte schon ein Schritt leichtfüßig die Treppe empor. Ilona war es. Auch sie hielt, ganz wie vordem der Diener, die Augen gesenkt, während sie an mich herantrat.","But then a light-footed step crackled up the stairs. It was Ilona. She, too, kept her eyes lowered, just like the servant before her, as she approached me.","But here I heard light footsteps coming up the stairs. It was Ilona. She too, like Josef a moment ago, kept her eyes cast down as she came towards me.","But at that moment the faint creak of footsteps could be heard on the stairs. It was Ilona. She too kept her eyes lowered, just as Josef had done, as she came up to me."
"»Nein, vergeben und vergessen. Nur weiter brav bleiben muß es natürlich und alles tun, was man von ihm verlangt.«","“No, forgive and forget.

"Das blieb mein Fehler in diesen Tagen, mein irreparabler, mein unverzeihlicher Fehler, daß ich trotz allem leidenschaftlichen Bemühen nicht die äußerste Geduld aufbrachte, nicht die letzte Kraft, mich zu verstellen. Vergebens hatte ich mir vorgenommen, mit keinem Wort, keinem Blick, keiner Geste ahnen zu lassen, daß ihre Zärtlichkeit mich bedrückte. Immer und immer wieder brachte ich mir Condors Warnung zum Bewußtsein, welche Gefährdung, welche Verantwortung ich verschuldete, wenn ich diese Verletzliche verletzte. Laß dich lieben von ihr, sagte ich mir immer wieder, verbirg dich, verstell dich diese acht Tage lang, um ihren Stolz zu schonen. Laß sie nicht ahnen, daß du sie betrügst, doppelt betrügst, indem du mit heiterer Sicherheit von ihrer baldigen Genesung sprichst und gleichzeitig innerlich zitterst vor Scheu und Scham. Tu unbefangen, ganz unbefangen, mahnte ich mich immer wieder, versuch’s deiner Stimme Herzlichkeit, deinen Händen Zärtlichkeit und Zartheit zu geben.","That remained my mistake in those days, my irreparable, my unforgivable mistake, that despite all my passionate efforts I didn't have the utmost patience, didn't have the ultimate strength to pretend. In vain I had resolved not to give a hint, with not a word, not a look, not a gesture, that her tenderness oppressed me. Again and again I brought to mind Condor's warning of the danger and responsibility I would incur if I hurt this vulnerable person. Let her love you, I kept telling myself, hide yourself, disguise yourself for these eight days to spare her pride. Don't let her suspect that you are cheating on her, double cheating, speaking with serene certainty of her speedy recovery while at the same time trembling inside with awe and shame. Be uninhibited, completely uninhibited, I kept reminding myself, try to give your voice warmth and your hands tenderness and delicacy.","That was my mistake during these days, my unforgivable, irreparable mistake—hard as I tried I could not summon up all the patience I needed, the ultimate ability to dissemble. My resolve not to let her guess, from any word or gesture of mine, that her love was unwelcome to me was useless. Again and again I recalled Condor’s warning of the danger and the responsibility I would bear if I injured someone so vulnerable. Let her love you, he had said repeatedly, conceal your feelings, keep up the pretence just for that one week to spare her pride. Don’t let her guess that you are deceiving her—deceiving her twice over by assuring her cheerfully that she will soon be well again, while at the same time you are trembling with fear and shame. Pretend to be unselfconscious, entirely at your ease, I kept reminding myself, try to put warmth into your voice, tenderness and affection into your hands.","That was the fateful mistake I made and continued to make during the next few days — an irreparable, unforgivable mistake: despite all my desperate efforts I did not muster the very last reserves of my patience, the very last ounce of my strength, in an effort to hide my feelings. It was in vain that I resolved not to betray by a single word, glance or gesture that her love was irksome to me. Again and again I called to mind Condor ’s warning as to what a dangerous situation I might precipitate, what a responsibility I should be incurring, were I to wound this vulnerable creature. Let her love you, I said to myself, conceal your feelings, dissimulate for this one week, to spare her pride. Don’t let her suspect that you are betraying her, doubly betraying her, by talking so blandly of an early prospect of a cure, while you are inwardly trembling with embarrassment and shame. Behave easily, naturally, I kept admonishing myself; try to put warmth into your voice, affection and tenderness into your touch."
"»Also knapp und klar – ich muß mich eilen, sonst wittern die draußen Lunte und reden sich ein, daß wir hier allerhand konspirieren. Schon das war eine Viechsarbeit, den Chauffeur abzukappen, der mich coûte que coûte sofort hinausspedieren wollte. Aber gleich in medias res, damit Sie wissen, was gespielt wird!","“Succinctly and clearly – I have to hurry, otherwise those outside will smell a fuse and convince themselves that we are conspiring all sorts of things here. Even that was a beast's work, beating off the chauffeur, who wanted to haul me out immediately, coûte que coûte. But right in medias res so you know what's playing!","“Well, let’s keep this short. I have to hurry, or out at Kekesfalva they’ll suspect us of hatching Heaven knows what conspiracies. I had a hard job preventing the chauffeur from coming to town to drive me straight out there—he was intent on spiriting me away at any price. But now let’s plunge in medias res, so that I can put you in the picture.","‘I’ll have to hurry, or those people up at Kekesfalva will smell a rat and get it into their heads we’re hatching all sorts of plots.

But let me plunge in medias res, so that you may know what’s at stake."
Kapitel 27,Chapter 27,I was God that evening.,I did not look at the ring; I merely took her hand and kissed it.
"Aber nun geschah etwas Unerwartetes. Die grauen Augen wurden starr, es war, als ob etwas in meinen Worten ihre Pupillen versteinert hätte. Dagegen wurden allmählich die Finger unruhig, sie tasteten die Lehne auf und nieder, begannen zuerst leise und dann immer heftiger auf dem blanken Holz zu trommeln. Der Mund verzerrte sich leicht, und mit einem Mal sagte sie abrupt:","But now something unexpected happened. The gray eyes stared, it was as if something in my words had frozen their pupils. On the other hand, the fingers gradually became restless, they felt the armrest up and down, began to drum at first softly and then more and more violently on the bare wood. Her mouth twisted slightly and suddenly she said abruptly:","Here something that I hadn’t expected happened. Her grey eyes glazed over. It was as if something in what I said had turned them to stone. Meanwhile, her fingers began to fidget restlessly, rising and falling on the arms of her chair, drumming first faintly and then harder on the wood. There was a slight, wry twist to her mouth.","Her reaction was most unexpected. The grey eyes grew glassy; it was as though something in my words had turned her pupils to stone. Her fingers, on the other hand, grew more and more restless; they roamed up and down the arms of the chair, and began, at first softly, then more and more vigorously, to drum on the polished wood. Her mouth was slightly contorted."
"Immerhin – dieses eine Wort von der neuen Kur zündete mir ein Licht auf. Ich begriff sofort, jemand mußte von jener Kur Professor Viennots entweder zum Alten oder zu seiner Tochter geschwätzt haben; so was kommt doch nicht aus der Luft und dieser jemand kann selbstverständlich kein anderer gewesen sein als Sie, Herr Leutnant.«","Still - this one word about the new cure ignited a light for me. I understood at once that someone must have talked about Professor Viennot's cure either to the old man or to his daughter; something like that doesn't come out of thin air, and of course this someone can't have been anyone other than you, Herr Leutnant.""","“However, with that remark about new treatment light dawned on me. I realised at once that someone must have been talking either to the old man or his daughter about the method tried by Professor Viennot. Such stories don’t come out of thin air. And that someone, of course, had to be you, Lieutenant Hofmiller.”","‘Well, this mention of a new treatment threw a great light on the whole matter. I realized at once that someone must have been chattering either to the old boy or his daughter about Professor Viennot’s cure; there must be something behind it all.

Glücklicherweise wirft Ilona rasch eine Frage in das stickige Schweigen:,"Luckily, Ilona quickly throws a question into the stuffy silence:",Fortunately Ilona casts another question into the difficult silence.,Fortunately Ilona hurriedly interjected a question into the suffocating silence.
"Ich gebe das Telegramm auf. Wie langsam die Beamtin ist, wie viel sie herumfragt: Absender, Adresse, eine Formalität nach der andern. Und der Zug geht doch schon in zwei Minuten ab. Abermals muß ich ziemlich Gewalt anwenden, um mich durch den neugierigen Haufen vor dem Anschlag durchzudrücken, der sich inzwischen noch vergrößert hat. Was ist denn eigentlich los? will ich eben noch fragen. Aber da gellt bereits das Abfahrtssignal. Mir bleibt gerade noch Zeit, in den Waggon zu springen. Gott sei Dank, jetzt ist alles getan, jetzt kann sie nicht mißtrauisch, nicht unruhig werden. Nun erst spüre ich, wie abgemüdet ich bin von diesen zwei angespannten Tagen, diesen zwei schlaflosen Nächten. Und abends in Czaslau anlangend, muß ich alle Kraft zusammenraffen, um das eine Stockwerk zu meinem Hotelzimmer hinaufzutaumeln. Dann stürzte ich in den Schlaf wie in einen Abgrund hinein.","I post the telegram. How slow the officer is, how many questions she asks: sender, address, one formality after the other. And the train leaves in two minutes. Again I have to use quite some force to push my way through the crowd of curious people in front of the attack, which in the meantime has grown even larger. What's actually going on? I just want to ask. But the departure signal is already ringing. I just have time to jump in the wagon. Thank God, everything is done now, now she can't get suspicious, can't get restless. Only now do I realize how tired I am from these two tense days, these two sleepless nights. And when I arrive in Czaslau in the evening, I have to gather all my strength to stagger up one floor to my hotel room. Then I fell asleep as if into an abyss.","I hand in the telegram. How slow the woman behind the counter is! Sender’s name and address, formality after formality. And my train leaves again in two minutes’ time. Once again I have to push my way through the crowd clustering around the notice. It is even larger now. I want to ask what’s going on, but the whistle tells me my train is about to leave. I just have time to jump into the carriage. Thank God, that’s all dealt with. Only now do I realise how tired I am after these two strenuous days and two sleepless nights. On arriving in Czaslau in the evening, I need all my strength to stagger one floor up to my hotel room. Then I fall into sleep as if I were falling into a chasm.","I handed in the telegram. How slow the postmistress was, what a lot of questions she asked: name and address of sender, one formality after another! And my train was leaving in two minutes. Again I had to employ a good deal of force in order to push my way through the curious mob which was standing round the notice and had in the meantime swelled considerably. Whatever was the matter? I was just about to ask, when the whistle blew shrilly, and I just had time to leap into the carriage. Thank God, I had settled that, she could not be suspicious now, could not be uneasy! I was just beginning to realize how exhausted I was after those two nerve-wracking days, those two sleepless nights. And when, that evening, I arrived in Czaslau, I had to rally all my strength in order to stagger up to my hotel bedroom on the first floor, where I plunged into sleep as into an abyss."
"›Ach, dann könnte ich am Ende schon morgen früh abreisen?‹ Die beiden Kornblumen ihrer Augen strahlten ihn an.","'Oh, then I could leave early in the morning after all?'

"›Du kannst dir denken‹, erzählte inzwischen der kleine Schreiber weiter, ›daß mein Chef in Saft kam, als er bei seiner Rückehr sah, wie man die dumme Person übertölpelt hatte. Sie hatte bereits schriftlich auf Orosvár verzichtet, auf das Palais in der Ofnerstraße und sich mit dem Gut Kekesfalva und dem Gestüt abspeisen lassen, Besonderen Eindruck hatte ihr offenbar das Versprechen des gerissenen Hundes gemacht, sie würde weiterhin nichts mehr mit Gerichten zu tun haben, ja, die Erben würden sogar großmütig die Kosten ihres Anwalts auf sich nehmen. Nun wäre de jure dieser Ausgleich noch anzufechten gewesen, er war schließlich nicht vor dem Notar abgeschlossen, sondern nur vor Zeugen, und man hätte spottleicht die gierige Bande aushungern können, die keinen Heller mehr besaß, um eine Verschleppung durch neue Instanzen durchzustehen. Natürlich war es die verdammte Pflicht meines Chefs, denen heimzuleuchten und den Vergleich im Interesse der Erbin anzufechten. Aber die Bande wußte ihn richtig beim Schlafittchen zu packen – sie boten ihm hinterrücks sechzigtausend Kronen Anwaltshonorar, wenn er weiter nicht muh mache. Und da er ohnehin einen Zorn auf die dumme Person hatte, die sich eine schöne runde Million in einer halben Stunde abschwatzen ließ, erklärte er den Vergleich für gültig und scheffelte sein Geld ein – sechzigtausend Kronen, was sagst du, dafür, daß er durch sein blödes Nach-Wien-Fahren seiner Klientin die ganze Sache versaut hat! Ja, Glück muß man haben, den größten Lumpen schenkt’s der Herr im Schlaf! Jetzt hat sie von dem ganzen Millionenerbe nichts als Kekesfalva, und das wird sie auch bald verwursteln, wie ich sie kenne: so ein saudummes Kalb!‹","'You can imagine,' the little clerk went on in the meantime, 'that my boss got into trouble when he came back and saw how the stupid person had been duped. She had already given up Orosvár in writing, the palace on Ofnerstrasse and had been fobbed off with the Kekesfalva estate and the stud farm. The promise of the cunning dog had apparently made a special impression on her that she would no longer have anything to do with the courts, yes , the heirs would even generously bear the costs of their lawyer. Now, de jure, this settlement would still have had to be disputed, after all it was not concluded before the notary but only before witnesses, and it would have been foolishly easy to starve the greedy gang, which didn't have a penny left, in order to survive being dragged through by new authorities. Of course, it was my boss's damned duty to sneak up on them and challenge the settlement on behalf of the heiress. But the gang knew how to get him by the nitpick—they secretly offered him sixty thousand kronor in legal fees if he didn't moo any further. And since he was already angry with the stupid person who let himself be talked into a nice round million in half an hour, he declared the settlement valid and pocketed his money - sixty thousand kroner, what do you say, for it being through his client's stupid trip to Vienna ruined the whole thing! Yes, you have to be lucky, the Lord gives it to the biggest rags in their sleep! Now she has nothing but Kekesfalva from the whole million-dollar inheritance, and she will soon mess that up too, as I know her: such a bloody stupid calf!'","“‘As you can imagine,’ the clerk was telling his friends, ‘my boss was left stewing in his own juice, furious with the stupid woman for being fooled like that. She’d already put it in writing that she gave up all claim to Orosvár and the town house in Ofnerstrasse, and was happy to be fobbed off with the Kekesfalva estate and the stud farm. That cunning fellow Wiezner had obviously impressed her mightily by promising that she’d have no more trouble with the courts now, and the old lady’s natural heirs would even be generous enough to pay her own lawyer’s costs. Well, in law it would still have been possible to contest this settlement. After all, it had not been signed before a notary, only in front of witnesses, and that greedy gang the old woman’s family could easily have been starved out. They didn’t have a penny to their names to enable them to drag the whole thing out by more and more appeals to new authorities. Of course it was my boss’s duty to tell them so and contest the agreement in the interests of the heiress. But the gang knew how to get around him—they offered him a fee of sixty thousand crowns, no questions asked, not to make any more trouble. And since he was so angry anyway with his stupid client, who had let herself be wheedled out of a fortune of a good round million in half-an-hour’s talk, he declared the settlement valid and pocketed his cash—sixty thousand crowns, what do you say to that, for letting his client ruin her whole case by his own stupid decision to go to Vienna? Well, we all need luck, and it looks as if the good Lord sends even the greatest fool luck in his sleep! So now she has nothing left of that legacy of a million but Kekesfalva, and if I know her sort she’ll soon make such a mess of things that she’ll throw that away too!’","‘You can just imagine’, the clerk went on, ‘how livid my chief was to find on his return that the silly creature had let herself be led up the garden. She had already signed away all her claims to the Orosvár estate, the palais in the Ofnerstrasse, and had let herself be fobbed off with the Kekesfalva estate and the stud-farm. She had obviously been particularly impressed by the sly dog’s promise that she would be burdened with no further litigation, and that the relatives would even be magnanimous enough to pay her lawyer’s fees. Now this settlement might still have been disputed in law, for it had not been signed in the presence of a notary public but only before witnesses, and it would have been as easy as winking to starve out the greedy gang, for they hadn’t another cent, and couldn’t possibly have stood the delay of taking the case to a higher court. Of course my chief, damn his eyes, should have given them a piece of his mind and contested the agreement in the courts in the interests of the beneficiary. But the gang knew the best way of getting round him — on the quiet they offered him a fee of sixty thousand crowns to keep his mouth shut. And since in any case he was furious with the silly creature for letting herself be done out of half a million in half an hour, he declared the settlement valid and raked in the money — sixty thousand crowns, what d’you make of that, for messing up the whole business for his client by going off to Vienna like that! Yes, you’ve got to be born under a lucky star; the Lord bestows His gifts on the biggest scoundrels in their sleep! And now all she’s got out of the millions left to her is Kekesfalva, and she’ll go and chuck that away jolly soon, if I know anything about her, the silly fool.’"
"»Verzeih mir«, begann sie sich zu entschuldigen, »aber ich hab dem Herrn doch erklären müssen, daß du erst dein Essen haben sollst, du mußt schrecklich hungrig sein. Den ganzen Tag unterwegs, und zwölfmal, fünfzehnmal hat’s inzwischen um dich telephoniert … Verzeih, daß ich dem Herrn sagte, er solle lieber morgen kommen, aber …«","'Forgive me,' she began to apologize, 'but I had to explain to the gentleman that you should have your food first, you must be terribly hungry. Been on the road all day, and you've been on the phone twelve, fifteen times in the meantime... Forgive me for telling the gentleman to come tomorrow, but...""","“I’m sorry,” she began apologetically, “but I had to explain to this gentleman that you ought to have your supper first, you must be terribly hungry. Out and about all day, and people telephoning you a dozen or fifteen times in between whiles … I’m sorry , I did tell this gentleman he had better come back in the morning, but …”","‘Forgive me,’ she said, obviously anxious to excuse herself, ‘but I had to explain to the gentleman that you must have a meal first; you must be dreadfully hungry. Rushing about the whole day long, and while you were away there’ve been at least a dozen telephone calls for you ... Forgive me for telling the gentleman he’d much better come tomorrow, but ...’"
"Ich ärgerte mich und schämte mich. Mich verdroß die lockere, vielleicht beabsichtigt legere Art, mit der er alles mißverstand. So schlug ich die Hacken zusammen:","I was angry and ashamed. I was annoyed by the easy, perhaps intentionally casual, way in which he misunderstood everything. Here's how I clicked my heels:","I was ashamed of myself, and getting annoyed as well. The casual, almost deliberately frivolous way in which he misunderstood it all was getting me down. I clicked my heels.","I was annoyed and ashamed. The airy, almost deliberately casual, way in which he misunderstood everything exasperated me. ‘Permit me most respectfully to remark, Herr Oberst,’ I said, clicking my heels, ‘that I uttered this crude untruth about not being engaged in the presence of seven officers of the regiment at our table in the café."
"Ich mußte das sehr heftig gesagt haben, denn Balinkay blickte mich erst neugierig und dann mit einem merkwürdig starren Blick an, der wie aus einer weiten Ferne kam. Schließlich rückte er den Sessel näher und legte seine Hand auf meinen Arm.","I must have said it very vehemently, because Balinkay first looked at me curiously and then with a strange stare that seemed to come from afar. Finally he moved the chair closer and put his hand on my arm.","I must have said those words with great vigour, because Balinkay looks at me first with curiosity, then with a strangely fixed glance that seems to come from far away. Finally he moves his chair closer to me and places his hand on my arm.","I must have spoken with extreme vehemence, for Balinkay regarded me first with a curious and then with a fixed look, as though from a great distance. Finally he drew his chair up closer and laid his hand on my arm."
"»Nein, bleiben Sie! Es hat gar nichts zu sagen.«","""No, stay! It doesn't mean anything.""","“No, don’t go away! This really doesn’t matter.”","‘No, stay. It’s nothing, nothing at all!’"
"Dann sprachen wir ganz unbefangen von der Reise und kleinen alltäglichen Dingen, wir plauderten über das, was in der Stadt, was in der Kaserne geschehen. Ich begriff nicht mehr, daß ich mich hatte quälen können, wo doch alles so einfach war: man saß bei einem Menschen und hielt seine Hand. Man verkrampfte sich nicht und versteckte sich nicht, man zeigte, daß man es herzlich miteinander meinte, man wehrte sich nicht gegen die zärtliche Empfindung, man nahm das Gefühl einer Neigung ohne Scham und mit reinem Dank.","Then we talked quite freely about the trip and small everyday things, we chatted about what was happening in the city, what was happening in the barracks. I no longer understood that I could have tortured myself when everything was so simple: you sat with someone and held their hand. They didn't tense up or hide, they showed that they really meant each other, they didn't resist the tender feeling, they accepted the feeling of affection without shame and with pure gratitude.","Then we talked at our leisure about her forthcoming journey and little everyday things, we discussed what had happened in the town and in the barracks. I no longer understood why I had been tormenting myself, when it was all so easy—you sat beside a girl and held her hand. I was not making a painful effort any more, I was not hiding my feelings, we were showing each other warmth. I did not resist these tender emotions any more, I accepted the knowledge of her feelings for me without shame, indeed with pure gratitude.","We talked without constraint of the journey and of little everyday things; we chatted about what had been going on in the town, in the barracks. I could no longer understand how it was that I had tortured myself when everything, after all, was so simple. You just sat together and held hands, there was no need for you to force yourselves or to hide your real feelings , you showed that you were fond of one another, you did not struggle against your tender feelings, you accepted the other’s love for you without shame and with sheer gratitude."
"Sie haben es wahrhaftig nicht bös gemeint, die braven Jungen – aber doch, mit ihrem tölpischen Staunen und Raunen haben sie etwas unwiederbringlich in mir zerstört: meine Sicherheit. Denn bisher hatte jene sonderbare Beziehung zu den Kekesfalvas mein Selbstgefühl in einer wunderbaren Weise gesteigert. Ich hatte zum ersten Male in meinem Leben mich als der Gebende, als der Helfende gefühlt; nun wurde ich gewahr, wie die andern diese Beziehung sahen, oder vielmehr, wie man sie von außen, in Unkenntnis all der geheimen Zusammenhänge, unvermeidlich sehen mußte. Was konnten Fremde denn verstehen von dieser subtilen Lust des Mitleidens, der ich – ich kann es nicht anders sagen – wie einer dunklen Leidenschaft verfallen war. Für sie blieb es ausgemacht, daß ich mich einzig deshalb einnistete in dieses üppige, gastliche Haus, um mich reichen Leuten anzubiedern, ein Nachtmahl zu sparen und mir Geschenke zu holen. Dabei meinen sie’s innerlich nicht böse, sie gönnen mir, die guten Jungen, die warme Ecke, die schönen Zigarren; sie sehen zweifellos – und gerade das ärgert mich – nicht das geringste Unehrenhafte oder Unsaubere darin, daß ich mich von diesen »Wurzen« fêtieren und hofieren lasse, weil unsereiner, nach ihrer Auffassung, so einem Pfeffersack doch nur eine Ehre antut, wenn man als Kavallerieoffizier sich an seinen Tisch setzt; nicht die geringste Mißbilligung hatte dabei mitgespielt, wenn der Ferencz und der Jozsi jene goldene Zigarettendose bewunderten – im Gegenteil, es hatte ihnen sogar einen gewissen Respekt eingeflößt, daß ich es verstand, meine Mäzene derart hochzunehmen. Aber was mich jetzt so sehr verdrießt, ist, daß ich selber an mir irre zu werden beginne. Führe ich mich denn nicht wirklich wie ein Schmarotzer auf? Darf ich als Offizier, als erwachsener Mensch mich Abend für Abend freihalten und hofieren lassen? Die goldene Tabatière zum Beispiel, die hätte ich keinesfalls annehmen dürfen und ebensowenig den seidenen Schal, den sie mir jüngst umhängten, als es draußen so stürmte. Man läßt sich als Kavallerieoffizier keine Zigarren für den Nachhauseweg in die Tasche schieben, und – um Gottes willen, das muß ich morgen gleich Kekesfalva ausreden, – das mit dem Reitpferd! Jetzt fällt’s mir erst auf, daß er vorgestern etwas gemurmelt hat, mein brauner Wallach (den ich natürlich auf Raten abzahle) halte nicht gut Form, und damit hat er schließlich recht. Aber daß er mir aus seinem Gestüt einen Dreijährigen leihen will, einen famosen Renner, mit dem ich Ehre einlegen könne, das paßt mir nicht. Ja, »leihen« – ich verstehe schon, was das bei ihm heißt! So wie er Ilona eine Mitgift versprochen hat, nur damit sie bei dem armen Kind als Pflegerin durchhält, will er mich kaufen, mich bar bezahlen für mein Mitleid, für meine Späße, meine Gesellschafterei! Und ich einfältiger Mensch wäre beinahe darauf hereingefallen, ohne zu merken, daß ich mich damit zum Schmarotzer herabwürdige!","They really didn't mean it badly, the good boys - but still, with their clumsy amazement and murmuring they irretrievably destroyed something in me: my security. For hitherto that strange relationship with the Kekesfalvas had increased my self-esteem in a wonderful way. For the first time in my life I had felt like giving, helping; now I became aware of how the others saw this relationship, or rather how one inevitably saw it from the outside, ignorant of all the secret connections. What could strangers understand of this subtle joy of compassion, to which I - I cannot put it any other way - had fallen like a dark passion. It was clear to them that the only reason I settled into this lavish, hospitable house was to curry favor with rich people, to save on supper, and to fetch presents for myself. Inwardly they don't mean it badly, they don't begrudge me, the good boys, the warm corner, the nice cigars; They undoubtedly see - and this is precisely what annoys me - not the slightest dishonorable or unclean thing in the fact that I let myself be feted and courted by these ""Wurzen"" because, in their opinion, we only do such a peppersack an honor if one as cavalry officer sits down at his table; There hadn't been the slightest disapproval when Ferencz and Jozsi admired that golden cigarette box - on the contrary, it had even inspired them with a certain respect that I knew how to mock my patrons like that. But what annoys me so much now is that I'm beginning to make mistakes about myself. Am I not really acting like a parasite? As an officer, as an adult, am I allowed to keep myself free and court every evening? The golden snuffbox, for example, I shouldn't have accepted, nor the silk scarf that they wrapped around me recently when it was storming outside. As a cavalry officer you don't have cigars in your pocket for the way home, and - for God's sake, I'll have to talk Kekesfalva out of that tomorrow - about the riding horse! It's only now that I notice that the day before yesterday he muttered something about my bay gelding (which I'm paying off in installments, of course) not keeping up very well, and he's right about that in the end. But I don't like the fact that he wants to lend me a three-year-old from his stud farm, a famous racer with whom I can do some honors. Yes, ""borrow"" - I can understand what that means for him! Just as he promised Ilona a dowry just so that she could keep caring for the poor child, he wants to buy me, pay me in cash for my pity, for my jokes, for my companionship! And I, a simpleton, almost fell for it without realizing that I was degrading myself to a parasite!","They certainly didn’t bear me any ill will, good fellows that they were—but with their silly marvelling and whispering they irretrievably destroyed my sense of security. For before this happened my curious relationship with the Kekesfalvas had increased my self-confidence wonderfully. I had felt, for the first time in my life, that I was the one with something to give, the one offering help. Now I realised how others saw this relationship, or rather how any outsider, unaware of all the hidden convolutions, would inevitably see it. What could strangers know about the subtle desire to show pity to which I had fallen prey—I can’t think how else to put it—as if it were some dark passion? They were bound to suppose that I had made myself at home in that generously hospitable house only to curry favour with the rich, save the price of an evening meal, and get presents. And they really don’t mean ill , I think; they’re my friends , they don’t grudge me a warm place to sit, fine cigars to smoke. Undoubtedly—and this is just what irks me—they see nothing in the least wrong or dishonourable in my allowing such people to make much of me, because cavalry officers like us, as they see it, do a moneybags like Kekesfalva honour by sitting at his table. There was not the slightest disapproval in the way Ferencz and Jozsi admired the gold cigarette case—on the contrary, it even made them feel a certain respect for my ability to get such things out of my patrons. But what annoys me so much now is that I am beginning to feel uncertain about myself. Am I really just sponging on the Kekesfalvas? As an officer, a grown man, can I allow myself to be courted like this and keep every evening free? The gold cigarette case, for instance—I ought never to have accepted it, any more than I should have accepted the silk scarf they gave me recently when it was stormy weather outside. A cavalry officer doesn’t let people put cigars in his pocket to take home, and what’s more—for God’s sake, I must talk Kekesfalva out of this tomorrow—there’s the business of the horse! Only now do I remember that the day before yesterday he was murmuring something to the effect that my bay gelding (for which of course I was paying by instalments) was not in very good shape, and he was right there. But his idea of lending me a three-year-old from his own stud farm, a famous former racehorse that would do me credit, really won’t do. Yes, “lend”, I understand what he means by that! Just as he has promised Ilona a dowry, only to keep her as companion to poor Edith, he wants to buy me too, pay me cash down for my sympathy, for my jokes, my social skills! And idiot that I am, I nearly fell for it, without noticing that I was degrading myself to the status of a sponger!","They really hadn’t meant it unkindly, the good chaps; all the same, their idiotic gaping and whispering had destroyed something in me that could never be restored: my confidence. For until now my strange relationship with the Kekesfalvas had in some wonderful way increased my self-esteem. For the first time in my life I had felt myself to be someone who gave, who helped; and now I had been made to realize how others regarded this relationship, or rather, how it was bound to be regarded from outside by those ignorant of the underlying circumstances. For what could they know of this subtle craving to be stirred by pity to which I had fallen a prey as though — I cannot express it otherwise — to some dark passion? To them it seemed beyond question that I had gained an entrée to this luxurious, hospitable household solely in order to insinuate myself into the good graces of the rich, to save myself the expense of evening meals and to cadge presents. They did not in their hearts hold this against me, they did not grudge me, good fellows that they were, the warm corner, the choice cigars; they obviously did not think — and it was precisely this that riled me — that there was anything in the least dishonourable or shabby in letting oneself be fêted and pampered by these ‘suckers’, for in their view we cavalry officers were merely conferring an honour on an old moneybags by sitting down at his table. There had been not the faintest element of disapproval, therefore, in Ferencz’s and Jozsi’s admiration of my gold cigarette-case; on the contrary, they had even felt a certain respect for me for knowing how to make my Maecenas shell out. What really vexed me was that I began to doubt my own motives. Wasn’t I, after all, really behaving like a sponger? Ought I, as an officer, as an adult person, to let myself be dined and wined evening after evening? That gold cigarette-case, for example — I ought never to have accepted it, nor the silk scarf that had recently been pressed on me when there had been a storm raging out of doors. A young man of my age should not allow people to slip cigars in his pocket to smoke on the way home, and tomorrow, by God, I must talk Kekesfalva out of that idea of his of getting me a new mount! Only now did it occur to me that the day before yesterday he had murmured something about my brown gelding (which, of course, I was paying for by instalments) not being up to scratch, and there he was right. But to let him lend me a three-year-old from his stables, a famous racehorse, which would do me credit — that wouldn’t do at all. Lend — yes, I knew what he meant by that! He was trying to buy me, to pay cash down for my sympathy, for my entertaining company, just as he had promised Ilona a dowry simply to get her to stay and nurse his poor child. And I, simpleton that I was, had almost fallen into his trap without realizing that I was becoming a downright sponger."
"Daß auf ihrem bescheidenen Marktplatz eine so unglaubwürdige Karosse anhielt, und der Gutsherr, den sie alle vom Hörensagen kannten, mit seiner Familie – denn dazu zählten sie mich anscheinend – gerade in ihrem Kirchlein der Andacht beiwohnen wollte, rief bei den biederen Landleuten mächtige Erregung hervor. Der Mesner kam herausgelaufen, als ob dieser ehemalige Kanitz der leibhaftige Fürst Orosvár wäre, und teilte beflissen mit, daß der Priester mit dem Beginn der Messe warten wolle; ehrfürchtig gesenkten Hauptes bildeten die Leute Spalier, und sichtliche Rührung bemächtigte sich ihrer, sobald sie die Hinfälligkeit Ediths wahrnahmen, die von Josef und Ilona gestützt und geführt werden mußte. Immer erschüttert es gerade die einfachen Leute, wenn sie erkennen, daß Unglück sich nicht scheut, auch die »Reichen« gelegentlich grimmig anzufassen. Ein Rauschen und Raunen entstand, aber dann brachten die Frauen geschäftig Kissen heran, damit die Gebrechliche – selbstverständlich in der ersten Bankreihe, die sich rasch geleert hatte – möglichst bequem sitzen könne; fast hatte es den Anschein, als zelebriere dann der Priester für uns die Messe mit besonderer Feierlichkeit. Ich selbst wurde von der rührenden Einfachheit dieses Kirchleins sehr ergriffen; der helle Gesang der Frauen, der rauhe, etwas ungelenke der Männer, die naiven Stimmen der Kinder schien mir reinere und unmittelbarere Gläubigkeit zu bekennen als die viel kunstvolleren Zelebrierungen, wie ich sie im heimischen Stephansdom oder in der Augustinerkirche sonntäglich gewohnt war. Aber von eigener Andacht wurde ich wider meinen Willen abgelenkt, als ich zufällig auf Edith, meine Nachbarin, blickte und geradezu erschrocken bemerkte, mit welcher brennenden Inbrunst sie betete. Nie hatte ich bisher an irgendeinem Anzeichen vermuten können, daß sie fromm erzogen oder gesinnt sei; nun gewahrte ich eine Art des Gebets, das nicht wie jenes der meisten eine eingelernte Gewohnheit war; das blasse Gesicht gesenkt wie jemand, der gegen großen Sturm geht, die Hände angeklammert an das Pult, die äußeren Sinne gleichsam nach innen gezogen, und nur unbewußt die Worte mitmurmelnd, verriet sie in ihrer ganzen Haltung die Gespanntheit eines Menschen, der ein Äußerstes mit aufgebäumter und gesammelter Kraft erzwingen will. Manchmal zitterte die dunkle hölzerne Kirchenbank bis zu mir herüber, so inbrünstig ging das Erschüttertsein und Beben dieses ekstatischen Betens in das starre Holz. Ich begriff sofort, daß sie sich an Gott um ein Bestimmtes wandte, daß sie von ihm etwas wollte. Und was diese Kranke, diese Gelähmte begehrte, dies mitzufühlen war nicht schwer.","The fact that such an unbelievable carriage stopped in their modest market place, and that the squire, whom they all knew from hearsay, and his family - because they apparently counted me among them - wanted to attend the devotions in their little church, aroused great excitement among the staid country people . The sacristan came running out, as if this former Kanitz were the real Prince Orosvár, and diligently announced that the priest wanted to wait before mass began; The people formed a trellis, heads bowed in reverence, and visibly moved as soon as they noticed Edith's frailty, who had to be supported and guided by Josef and Ilona. It's always the ordinary people who are shaken when they realize that misfortune doesn't shy away from occasionally touching the 'rich' with a grim expression. There was a rustling and murmuring, but then the women busily brought cushions over so that the frail woman could sit as comfortably as possible—of course in the first row of pews, which had quickly emptied; it almost seemed as if the priest would then celebrate Mass for us with particular solemnity. I myself was very moved by the touching simplicity of this little church; the bright singing of the women, the rough, somewhat awkward voices of the men, the naive voices of the children seemed to me to profess a purer and more immediate faith than the much more elaborate celebrations I was used to on Sundays in St. Stephen's Cathedral at home or in the Augustinian Church. But I was distracted from my own devotion against my will when I happened to glance at Edith, my neighbor, and was downright shocked to see the burning fervor with which she was praying. I had never been able to guess from any sign that she had been brought up or thought piously; now I perceived a kind of prayer which was not, like that of most, a learned habit; her pale face lowered like someone who is going to face a great storm, her hands clinging to the desk, her outer senses drawn inward, as it were, and only unconsciously murmuring the words, she betrayed in her entire bearing the tension of a person who was extremely concerned reared up and collected strength wants to force. Sometimes the dark wooden pew trembled all the way to me, so fervently did the shaking and trembling of this ecstatic praying go into the rigid wood. I understood at once that she was turning to God for something specific, that she wanted something from him. And what this sick, this paralyzed woman desired, it was not difficult to sympathize with.","The simple country folk were greatly surprised to see such an extraordinary carriage stop in their unassuming marketplace, where the owner of the whole estate, known to them all by hearsay, got out and went into their little church to take part in matins with his whole family, which also seemed to include me. The sexton came running up, as if the former Leopold Kanitz were Prince Orosvár in person, and told us earnestly that the priest would delay the beginning of mass for us. Our path was lined by the congregation, their heads respectfully bowed, and a wave of sympathy ran through them when they saw Edith’s infirmity as Josef and Ilona supported her and helped her into the church. Simple people are always moved to see that the rich, too, can suffer misfortune. There was a murmuring and whispering, and then some of the women thoughtfully brought cushions so that the frail girl could sit as comfortably as possible—of course in the front pew, which was quickly cleared for us. It was almost as if the priest were celebrating mass with special solemnity for our benefit. I was greatly touched by the moving simplicity of this little church—the clear singing of the women, the deeper, sometimes rough tones of the men, the children’s naive voices all seemed to bear witness to a purer, more immediate faith than that of many more sophisticated church services, the kind that I knew from Sundays in St Stephen’s cathedral or the Augustinian church at home in Vienna. Against my will, however, I was distracted from my own prayers when I happened to look at Edith, sitting next to me, and was startled to see the ardent fervour with which she was praying. I had never before seen any sign that she had been brought up to be devout, or was naturally pious, but now I saw her deep in prayer that was not, like most people ’s, a matter of habit. Her pale face was lowered as if she were walking into a strong wind, her hands held the front of the pew tightly, it was as if all her outward senses were turned on her inmost being, and as she automatically murmured the words of the service her entire bearing was that of a woman with her nerves strung up to a high point of tension, using her concentrated powers in the attempt to force something into being. Sometimes I felt the pew in front of us trembling, so fervently did the ardour of that ecstatic prayer transfer itself to the dark wood. I knew at once that she was turning to God to ask for some particular answer to her prayers, that there was something the sick, crippled girl wanted the Deity to provide, and it was not difficult to guess what it was.","The fact that so incredible an equipage should pull up in their unassuming market-place, and that the land-owner whom they all knew from hearsay should, accompanied by his family — for they apparently assumed that I was a member of it — wish to attend Mass in their little church, occasioned intense excitement among the honest country-folk. The sacristan came running out just as though the former Kanitz were the late Prince Orosvár himself, and informed us obsequiously that the priest was going to hold up the service for us; their heads bowed reverently, the people made way for us, obviously overcome by emotion when they noticed Edith’s infirmity, for she had to be supported and helped into the church by Josef and Ilona. It is always simple people who are most shocked at the realization that misfortune sometimes does not shrink from laying a grim hand even on the rich. There was a rustling and a whispering, and then some women came bustling up with cushions so that the crippled girl — who was, of course, put in the front pew, which had been hurriedly vacated — should have as comfortable a seat as possible. And then, when the service began, it almost seemed as though the priest were celebrating Mass with ritual solemnity for our especial benefit. I myself was deeply moved by the touching simplicity of this little church; the clear singing of the women, the rugged, somewhat self-conscious voices of the men, the naïve piping of the children, seemed to me to betoken a purer and more direct faith than the far more sophisticated services I was used to in the Stefanskirche or the Augustinerkirche in Vienna. But I was distracted from my own devotions when I chanced to glance at Edith, who was sitting next to me, and noticed with positive alarm with what burning fervour she was praying. Never yet had I come across anything at all to indicate that she had had a religious upbringing or was religiously inclined; now I perceived that her praying was quite different from that of most people, to whom praying becomes in time a mere matter of habit; her head bowed as though she were walking in the teeth of a storm, her hands tightly clutching the front of the pew, her whole being withdrawn, as it were, into itself, so that she murmured the responses mechanically, her whole attitude betrayed the tense excitement of one who is concentrating and rallying all his forces in a supreme effort to obtain his heart’s desire. From time to time as I knelt beside her I could feel the dark wooden pew vibrating, as though something of the trembling fervour and quivering ecstasy of her praying were being communicated to the rigid wood. I realized that she was asking God for some definite thing, that she wanted something of Him, and what this crippled, sick girl wanted was not difficult for me to divine."
"Kekesfalva antwortet nicht. Er hat wohl nicht deutlich gehört. Aber er hat wenigstens die Geste meiner Hand verstanden. Zaghaft schiebt er sich an den äußersten Rand des angebotenen Stuhls. So verschüchtert muß er, erinnere ich mich blitzartig, in seiner Jugend als Kostgänger am Freitisch fremder Menschen gesessen haben. Und so sitzt er jetzt, der Millionär, bei mir auf dem armseligen abgebrauchten Rohrsessel. Umständlich nimmt er die Brille ab, kramt das Tuch aus der Tasche und beginnt die beiden Gläser zu putzen. Aber mein Lieber, ich bin schon gewitzigt, ich kenne dieses Putzen schon, ich kenne deine Tricks! Ich weiß, du putzt an den Gläsern, um Zeit zu gewinnen. Du möchtest, daß ich das Gespräch beginne, daß ich frage, und ich weiß sogar, was du gefragt werden möchtest – ob Edith wirklich krank ist und warum die Abreise verschoben werden soll. Aber ich bleibe auf meiner Hut. Fang du an, wenn du mir was zu sagen hast! Keinen Schritt geh ich dir entgegen! Nein – ich laß mich nicht neuerdings hineinlocken, – genug mit dem verdammten Mitleid, genug auch mit diesem ewigen Mehr und Mehr! Schluß mit diesen Hinterhältigkeiten und Undurchsichtigkeiten! Wenn du was von mir willst, dann mach’s rasch und ehrlich, aber versteck dich nicht hinter dieser einfältigen Brillenputzerei! Ich geh dir nicht mehr auf den Leim, ich hab mein Mitleid satt!","Kekesfalva does not answer. He must not have heard clearly. But at least he understood the gesture of my hand. Timidly he pushes himself to the edge of the offered chair. That's how timid he must have been, I remember in a flash, when he was a boarder when he was young, sitting at the free table of strangers. And so he is now sitting with me, the millionaire, on the miserable, worn-out cane chair. He awkwardly takes off his glasses, digs the cloth out of his pocket and begins to clean both glasses. But my dear, I'm already witty, I already know this cleaning, I know your tricks! I know you're cleaning the glasses to buy time. You want me to start the conversation, to ask, and I even know what you want to be asked - is Edith really ill and why the departure should be postponed. But I remain on my guard. Begin if you have something to say to me! I don't take a single step towards you! No - I won't let myself be lured into it again - enough with the damned pity, enough with this eternal more and more! Enough of these underhandedness and opacity! If you want something from me, then do it quickly and honestly, but don't hide behind this simple-minded cleaning of glasses! I won't fool you anymore, I'm fed up with my pity!","Kekesfalva doesn’t answer. He probably didn’t hear me clearly. But at least he understood my gesture. Hesitantly, he sits down on the very edge of the chair I offered him. It suddenly occurs to me that he must have accepted the charity of strangers in just this intimidated way in his youth. And there he sits now, a millionaire, on the poor, shabby cane-seated chair in my room. He ceremoniously takes off his glasses, gets a handkerchief out of his pocket and begins cleaning both lenses to gain time. You’d like me to speak first, I think, you want me to ask questions, I even know what you want to be asked—is Edith really ill, and why is the trip to Switzerland being put off? But I am on my guard. If you have something to say to me, I think, you can start the ball rolling! I’m not going a step to meet you! No—I’m not to be lured into another trap , I’ve had enough of this damned pity, enough of people wanting more and more from me all the time! Let’s have an end to all this sly obfuscation. If you want me to do something then tell me straight out, but don’t hide behind this silly pretence of polishing your glasses! I’m not taking your bait any more, I’ve had enough of my pity!","Kekesfalva made no reply. Probably he did not hear me distinctly, but at least he had understood my gesture. Timorously he perched himself on the extreme edge of the chair I had offered him. He must have sat down just so timidly in his youth, I thought in a flash, when eating the bread of charity in the homes of strangers. And there he sat now, the millionaire, in my shabby, worn-out cane-bottomed armchair. Deliberately he removed his spectacles and, foraging in his pocket for his handkerchief, began to polish the lenses. Aha, my friend! I thought, I’ve learned a thing or two , I know what that polishing means, I know your tricks! I know you’re only polishing your spectacles to gain time. You want me to begin the conversation, want me to ask all the questions, and I know, moreover, what you want to be asked — whether Edith is really ill and why your trip is being postponed. But I’m going to be on my guard. If you have anything to say to me, you can begin. I won’t go a step to meet you. No, I refuse to be dragged into the whole thing again — there must be an end of this accursed pity, an end of this eternal cry for more and yet more! An end of all this secretiveness and disingenuousness! If you want anything of me, then ask me straight out, but don’t sit there meekly polishing your glasses. I’m not going to walk into your trap again , I’m fed up to the teeth with all this pity."
"Im allgemeinen war ich nur ein mittelguter Reiter und einem passionierten Kavalleristen wie etwa Steinhübel nicht im entferntesten gewachsen. Heute jedoch hätte er niemand besseren finden können als mich und der unbändige Cäsar keinen gefährlicheren Gegner. Denn diesmal straffte der Zorn mir die Muskeln; die böse Lust, mit etwas fertigzuwerden, etwas unterzukriegen, machte es mir zu einem fast sadistischen Vergnügen, wenigstens diesem stützigen Tier (gegen das Unerreichbare kann man ja nicht losschlagen!) zu zeigen, daß meine Geduld Grenzen hat. Es half dem wackeren Cäsar wenig, daß er wie eine Rakete herumstob, mit den Hufen an die Wände polterte, sich bäumte und mit jähen Quersprüngen versuchte, mich herunterzukriegen. Ich war nun einmal in Saft und riß unbarmherzig die Trense an, als wollte ich ihm alle Zähne ausbrechen, ich krachte ihm die Absätze in die Rippen, und bei dieser Behandlung vergingen ihm bald die Mucken. Mich reizte, mich lockte, mich begeisterte sein harter Widerstand, und gleichzeitig feuerten mich die zustimmenden Bemerkungen der Offiziere »Donnerwetter, der gibt’s ihm!« oder »Da schaut’s den Hofmiller an« zu immer couragierterer Sicherheit an. Immer geht ja von körperlicher Leistung das Selbstgefühl ins Seelische über; nach einer halben Stunde rücksichtslosen Raufens saß ich schon siegreich im Sattel, und unter mir knirscht und dampft und trieft das gedemütigte Tier, als käme es aus einer heißen Dusche. Der Hals und das Lederzeug flocken weiß von Schaumspritzern, fügsam ducken sich die Ohren, und nach abermals einer halben Stunde geht der Unbesiegbare schon weich und gehorsam, wie ich will; ich brauche die Schenkel gar nicht mehr anzupressen und könnte jetzt ruhig absitzen, um mir von den Kameraden gratulieren zu lassen. Aber noch immer steckt zu viel Rauflust in mir, und ich fühle mich so wohl in dem gesteigerten Zustand der Anstrengung, daß ich Steinhübel bitte, jetzt noch auf eine Stunde oder zwei hinausreiten zu dürfen zum Exerzierplatz, im Trab natürlich, damit sich das abgeschwitzte Tier ein bißchen auskühlen könne.","In general, I was only a moderately good horseman and not in the remotest place a match for a passionate cavalryman like Steinhübel. Today, however, he could not have found anyone better than me and the irrepressible Caesar a more dangerous opponent. For this time anger tightened my muscles; my wicked desire to get on with something, to defeat something, made it an almost sadistic pleasure for me to show at least this supportive animal (you can't fight the unattainable!) that my patience has limits. It didn't help the valiant Caesar much that he darted around like a rocket, banged his hooves on the walls, reared up and tried to get me down with sudden leaps across the floor. I was in a good mood and mercilessly pulled on the bridle as if I wanted to break all his teeth, I smashed my heels into his ribs, and this treatment soon put an end to his sniffles. I was tempted, enticed, and enthusiastic about his tough resistance, and at the same time the approving remarks of the officers, ""Gosh, he's got it!"" or ""Look at Hofmiller,"" fired me to ever more courageous confidence. Self-confidence always passes from physical achievement to the mental; after half an hour of ruthless fighting I sat victorious in the saddle, and beneath me the humiliated animal crunches and steams and drips as if it were coming out of a hot shower. The neck and the leather are white with flakes of foam, the ears bend docilely, and after another half hour the invincible one is already walking softly and obediently as I want; I no longer need to press my thighs and could now sit down in peace to be congratulated by my comrades. But there is still too much fighting spirit in me, and I feel so good in the increased state of exertion that I ask Steinhübel if I can ride out to the parade ground for an hour or two, at a trot, of course, so that the sweaty animal can relax can cool down a bit.","In general I was only an average horseman, unable to come anywhere near matching that impassioned cavalry officer Steinhübel. Today, however, he could have found no one better than me to finish breaking in his horse, and the unruly Caesar could have had no more dangerous opponent. For this time anger steels my muscles; my savage desire to get the better of something, force the horse to submit to me, make it an almost sadistic pleasure to show this recalcitrant animal at least (for you can’t strike at those who are out of reach!) that there were limits to my patience. It does the bold horse no good to race around like a rocket, kick out at the walls of the riding school, rear and buck in his attempts to throw me. I am putting my heart into the struggle, and I pull mercilessly at the snaffle as if to break all Caesar’s teeth. I dig my heels into his ribs, and this rough treatment soon begins to calm him. His tough resistance provokes, entices and inspires me, and at the same time remarks of approval from the officers who were my audience—“Good God, he’s showing him a thing or two!” and “Who’d have thought it of Hofmiller?”—spur me on to greater and greater self-confidence, while as always with physical achievement, that confidence affects my temper as well. After half-an-hour of struggle, showing the horse no mercy, I sit triumphant in the saddle, while the humiliated animal is grinding his teeth and steaming and dripping as if he has come out of a hot shower. His throat and bridle are flecked with white as he foams at the mouth, his ears droop obediently, and after another half-an-hour the refractory horse is as gentle and docile as you could wish. I don’t have to exert the pressure of my thighs now, and could easily dismount to accept the congratulations of my comrades. But there is still too much pugnacity in me for that, and I am enjoying my heightened state of physical exertion so much that I ask Steinhübel’s permission to take the horse over to the parade ground for an hour or so—at a trot, of course—so that the sweating animal can cool off.","In general I was only an average rider, and far from being the equal in prowess of so redoubtable a rider as Steinhübel. Today, nevertheless, he could not have found anyone better than myself, and the unmanageable Caesar could not have met a more dangerous antagonist. For my muscles were tensed with fury, and in my perverse craving to get the better of, to master, someone or something, I took an almost sadistic pleasure in showing at least this stubborn animal (for one cannot let fly at what is out of one ’s reach) that there were limits to my patience. It little availed the doughty Caesar to zoom about like a rocket, to pound the walls with his hoofs, to rear and do his best, by suddenly leaping sideways, to throw me. My blood was up; I tugged mercilessly at the curb-rein as though trying to break all his teeth, I dug my heels into his ribs. And at this treatment he soon began to stop his antics. I was excited, elated by his stubborn resistance, and the approving remarks of my fellow-officers, ‘My stars, he’s giving him what for!’ or ‘Just look at old Hofmiller!’ inspired me with more and more daring and confidence. The feeling of self-assurance derived from physical achievement always transfers itself to the mental sphere. After half an hour of ruthless wrestling with the animal I still sat victorious in the saddle, and the exhausted brute beneath me was gnashing his teeth and steaming and sweating as though he had come out of a hot shower. His neck and bridle were flecked with foam, and his ears drooped submissively. After another half-hour the invincible Caesar was pacing up and down mildly and obediently at my will; I no longer needed to squeeze him firmly with my legs and was now able to dismount at my leisure and receive the congratulations of my fellow-officers. But there was still so much fight in me, and I had felt so fine during this trial of strength, that I asked Steinhübel to allow me to ride out to the parade-ground for an hour or two, at the trot of course, to allow the sweating beast to cool off a little."
"»Ich nehme an, Sie sind nach dem, was ich Ihnen vorhin darlegte, sich vollkommen der Konsequenzen bewußt – wir haben eben festgestellt, daß Ihr Echappieren auf das Kind mörderisch wirken muß … mörderisch oder selbstmörderisch … Sie sind sich daher, vermute ich, eindeutig über die Tatsache im klaren, daß dieses Blatt Papier nicht nur ein Abschiedsgesuch für Sie darstellt, sondern ein … ein Todesurteil für das arme Kind.«","'I assume you are perfectly aware of the consequences from what I have just explained to you - we have just established that your escape must have a murderous effect on the child ... murderous or suicidal ... you are therefore, I suppose, quite clear aware of the fact that this piece of paper is not only a farewell letter to you, but a ... a death sentence for the poor child.""","We have established the fact that if you run away the effect on the child will be tantamount to murder.

"»Überlassen Sie das mir, lieber Freund, was ich versuche und wann ich’s versuche – nur nicht drängen, nicht immer erzwingen wollen, was sich eben nicht zaubern läßt!

"Ist es wirklich so heiß in dieser Telephonzelle? Wie ein Erstickender reiße ich die Polstertür auf und tappe zurück an meinen Platz. Man hat mein Aufstehen und Weggehen anscheinend nicht bemerkt. Noch immer streiten und spotten die andern heftig mit Steinhübel herum, und neben meinem leeren Stuhl steht, beharrlich wartend, die Ordonnanz mit der Bratenschüssel. Mechanisch, um den Burschen rasch fortzuhaben, lege ich mir zwei, drei Schnitten auf den Teller, aber ich fasse weder Gabel noch Messer, denn zwischen den Schläfen hat ein so heftiges Ticken begonnen, als meißelte ein kleiner Hammer die Worte unbarmherzig in die innere Knochenwand: »Verschieben! Die Abreise verschieben!« Das muß doch einen Grund haben. Gewiß ist etwas geschehen. Ist sie ernstlich erkrankt? Habe ich sie beleidigt? Warum will sie auf einmal nicht weg? Condor hat mir doch versprochen, nur acht Tage müsse ich standhalten, und fünf habe ich schon durchgekämpft … Aber länger kann ich nicht mehr … ich kann einfach nicht!","Is it really that hot in that phone booth? Like a suffocating man, I rip open the padded door and grope back to my seat. Apparently no one noticed my getting up and walking away. The others are still arguing and joking around with Steinhübel, and the orderly with the roasting bowl is standing next to my empty chair, patiently waiting. Mechanically, to get the boy away quickly, I put two or three slices on my plate, but I don't hold my fork or knife, because a ticking has started between my temples, as if a small hammer were mercilessly chiseling the words into the inner bone wall : ""Move! Postpone your departure!' There must be a reason for that. Certainly something has happened. Is she seriously ill? did i insult her Why doesn't she want to leave all of a sudden? Condor promised me I only had to hold out for eight days, and I've already fought through five... But I can't do any longer... I just can't!","Is it really so hot in this telephone kiosk? I fling the soundproofed door open as if I were stifling, and make my way back to my place. Apparently no one has thought anything of my absence. The others are still enjoying their needling of Steinhübel, and beside my empty chair, waiting patiently for me, is the orderly with the platter of meat. I automatically help myself to two or three slices, just to get rid of the orderly, but I do not pick up my knife and fork. There is a pounding in my temples as if a little hammer were busy chiselling the words “Put off” mercilessly into the bone of my skull. “Put off! The trip has been put off!” There must be some reason. Something must certainly have happened. Has she been taken seriously ill? Did I offend her? Why does she suddenly prefer not to go away? Condor promised me I wouldn’t have to hold out for more than a week, and I’ve already struggled through five days of it … but I can’t go on any longer … I just can’t!","Was it really so hot in this telephone booth? I pushed open the padded door as if I were suffocating, and staggered back to my seat. Apparently my absence had not been remarked. They were still arguing away and ragging the wretched Steinhübel, and the orderly was hovering patiently behind my vacant chair with the meat course. Mechanically, to get rid of the fellow, I helped myself to two or three slices, but I made no move to take up knife or fork, for there was a violent pounding at my temples, as though a little hammer were pitilessly knocking out the words on my skull: ‘Postpone! Postpone our departure.’ There must be some reason for it. Something must have happened. Had she really been taken ill? Had I offended her? Why had she decided all of a sudden not to go?

"»Aber Toni, das ist doch ein Skandal, was du heut zusamm’patzt. Paß doch anständig auf«, ärgerte sich der Jozsi und sieht mich ganz fuchtig an. Meine Zerstreutheit hat ihn ein Rekontra gekostet. Ich raffe mich zusammen.","»But Toni, what you messed up today is a scandal. Be careful,"" Jozsi said angrily and looked at me furiously. My absent-mindedness cost him a recontra. I pull myself together.","“Come on, Toni, your play is a disgrace today. Watch what you’re doing, can’t you?” says Jozsi in annoyance, looking at me quite angrily. My absence of mind has cost him, as my partner, a game. I pull myself together.","‘I say, Toni, your playing’s a scandal; do pay attention!’ fumed Jozsi, giving me a furious look. My absent-mindedness had cost him the game. I pulled myself together."
"Ich fühlte meine Finger starr werden. Alles das hatte ich im Unterbewußtsein seit dem Augenblick vorausgeahnt, da ich jenes Telegramm auf dem Tisch liegen gesehen; dennoch war mir, da Condor mit unerbittlicher Sachlichkeit die Situation klarstellte, als hätte man mit einem stumpfen Beil mir gegen die Stirn geschlagen.

"»Bravo! Famos! Dann wär’s doch am g’scheitsten, du fährst einfach mit in der Kraxen! Vorn beim Chauffeur ist noch Platz.

"Ihr Blick, grau, streng und scharf, weicht nicht von mir. Je umständlicher ich schwätze, um so argwöhnischer spitzt er sich zu.

"»Heute nachmittag?« frage ich mit Absicht langsam, als ob ich mich erinnern müsse. »Heute nachmittag? Ach ja, das war eine dumme Geschichte heute nachmittag.

Ich lüge wirklich schlecht.)","""This afternoon?"" I ask slowly on purpose, as if trying to remember. ""This afternoon? Oh yes, that was a silly story this afternoon. The colonel wanted to buy a new horse and we all had to come along and look at it and break it in.' (Actually this had happened a month ago. I'm a really bad lie.)","“This afternoon?” I ask, deliberately slowly, as if I have to search my memory. “ This afternoon? Oh yes, such a silly thing happened this afternoon.

I’m a very bad liar.)","‘This afternoon?’ I asked, deliberately dragging out my words as though to jog my memory. ‘ This afternoon? Oh yes — it was a silly business, this afternoon.

I’m really an appallingly poor liar.)"
"Aber vielleicht – besinne ich mich rasch – ist er noch gar nicht abgereist. Nein, keinesfalls wird er zurückfahren, wenn wirklich etwas Schlimmes geschehen ist, ohne mir eine Botschaft zu hinterlassen. Vielleicht liegt eine Zeile von ihm in der Kaserne. Dieser Mensch, das weiß ich, tut nichts Heimliches ohne mich, gegen mich. Dieser Mensch läßt mich nicht im Stich. Nur jetzt rasch hinein! Zuverlässig wird das Wort, ein Brief, ein Zettel von ihm bei mir zu Hause sein oder er selbst. Nur rasch zurück!","But maybe - I think to myself quickly - he hasn't even left yet. No, under no circumstances will he drive back if something really bad has happened without leaving me a message. Maybe there's a line from him in the barracks.

Get back quickly!","But perhaps, I remind myself, he isn’t leaving yet. No, he won’t go back to Vienna if something really terrible has happened, not without leaving a message for me.

I am sure I shall find a word, a letter, a note for him in my room. I must hurry!","But perhaps, I quickly bethought myself, he’s not going away at all. No; if something dreadful has happened, he will on no account go back to Vienna without leaving a message for me. I expect he’s left a note at the barracks. He would, I knew, do nothing without my knowledge, nothing against my interests. He would not leave me in the lurch. The main thing was to get back quickly. I was certain to find a message, a letter, a note from him, or the man himself. I must hurry."
"Nun, umkehren kann ich nicht mehr, da sie mich schon gesehen haben. So schlendre ich möglichst unbefangen heran. Wohl ist mir nicht dabei, ich habe nicht die mindeste Lust auf Lustigkeit oder Schwätzerei. Und dann – ich spür irgendeine Spannung in der Luft. Sonst winkt doch einer mit der Hand oder schmeißt einem sein »Servus« wie einen blechernen Ball durch das halbe Lokal entgegen; heut sitzen sie alle stur wie ertappte Schuljungen. In meiner blödsinnigen Befangenheit sage ich, während ich einen Sessel heranrücke:","Well, I can't turn back now that they've already seen me. So I stroll up as uninhibitedly as possible. Well, I don't feel like it, I don't have the slightest desire for merriment or gossip. And then – I feel some tension in the air. Otherwise someone will wave their hand or throw their ""Servus"" at you like a tin ball through half the bar; today they all sit stubbornly like caught schoolboys. In my stupid embarrassment, I say while pulling up a chair:","Well, I can’t turn back now that they have seen me. So I stroll over as casually as possible. I don’t feel happy about this, I don’t feel in the least like merriment or cheerful talk. And also, I sense some kind of tension in the air. Usually one of them will wave to me, or send a cheery, “Evening!” flying halfway across the room like a cannonball, but today they sit there like schoolboys caught in mischief of some kind. Feeling stupidly self-conscious I pull up a chair, saying, “May I join you?”","Well, I couldn’t turn back now that they had seen me. So I sauntered up to them as nonchalantly as possible. I didn’t feel at all comfortable, and I hadn’t the slightest desire for a lot of ragging and chatter. And, moreover, I felt a certain tension in the atmosphere. Usually they waved to a fellow or hurled a ‘Servus’ like a cannon-ball across the room, but today they all sat there stiffly like schoolboys caught out in a prank."
"Durchhalten, sage ich mir innerlich rasch. Nicht nachgeben! Wenigstens einmal einen einzigen Tag! So seufze ich bedauernd. »Wie schade, ich käme ja furchtbar gerne. Aber der heutige Tag ist schon ganz verknackst, wir haben abends eine gesellige Veranstaltung, und da darf ich nicht fehlen.«","Hold on, I tell myself quickly inside. Do not give in! At least once a single day! So I sigh regretfully. 'What a pity, I'd love to come. But today is already a mess, we have a social event in the evening and I can't miss it.«","Stick to your decision, I quickly tell myself, don’t give way. Hold out at least for a single day! So I sigh regretfully. “What a pity, I’d be delighted to come. But today’s no good, the regiment has a social gathering this evening and I must be there.”","Be firm, I said quickly to myself. Don’t give in. Hold out for one day at least. ‘ What a pity!’ I said with a regretful sigh. ‘I should have loved to come. But today’s all booked up, we’ve got a reunion this evening, and I can’t cut it.’"
"»Noch eines«, fügte er leise bei. »Wir Ärzte sind genötigt, immer auch an Unvorhergesehenes zu denken, wir müssen auf jede Möglichkeit vorbereitet sein. Sollte etwa – ich setze hier einen irrealen Fall – ein Zwischenfall sich ereignen … ich meine, sollte Ihnen die Kraft versagen oder das Mißtrauen Ediths zu irgendeiner Krise führen – dann verständigen Sie mich sofort. Um keinen Preis darf während dieser kurzen, aber gefährlichen Phase etwas Unwiderrufliches geschehen. Wenn Sie sich Ihrer Aufgabe nicht gewachsen fühlen sollten, oder innerhalb dieser acht Tage unbewußt verraten, dann schämen Sie sich nicht – um Gottes willen, schämen Sie sich nicht vor mir, ich habe genug nackte Menschen und brüchige Seelen gesehen! Sie können zu jeder Stunde bei Tag oder Nacht kommen oder mich anrufen; ich bin immer bereit, beizuspringen, denn ich weiß, um was es geht. Und jetzt« – der Sessel neben mir rückte, ich merkte, daß Condor aufstand – »übersiedeln wir besser hinüber. Wir haben etwas lang gesprochen, und meine Frau wird leicht unruhig. Auch ich muß nach Jahren noch immer auf der Hut sein, sie nicht zu irritieren. Wen einmal das Schicksal hart verletzt hat, der bleibt für immer verletzbar.«","""One more thing,"" he added quietly. »We doctors are forced to always think of the unforeseen, we have to be prepared for every possibility. If an incident should happen - I'm using an unreal case here - I mean, if you fail to find the strength or if Edith's mistrust leads to some kind of crisis - then let me know immediately. Under no circumstances must anything irreversible happen during this short but dangerous phase. If you don't feel up to your task, or if you unconsciously betray yourself within these eight days, then don't be ashamed - for God's sake don't be ashamed of me, I've seen enough naked people and fragile souls! You can come or call me any hour of the day or night; I'm always willing to lend a helping hand because I know what's at stake. And now"" - the chair moved next to me, I noticed that Condor got up - ""we'd better move over there. We've been talking for a while and my wife is getting a little restless. Even after years I still have to be careful not to irritate her. Anyone who has been badly injured by fate remains vulnerable forever.«","“Just one more thing,” he added quietly. “We doctors always have to think of the unforeseen; we must be prepared for anything to happen. Should there be some kind of development —I don’t have anything definite in mind, but should your resolve fail you, and should distrust of you then plunge Edith into a crisis, you must let me know at once. On no account must anything irrevocable be done during this short but dangerous phase. If you don’t feel up to your task, or you inadvertently give yourself away within that one week, then don’t be ashamed—for God’s sake don’t be ashamed to tell me so! I’ve seen enough naked bodies and damaged souls in my time. You can visit me or telephone me at any time of day or night, and I shall be ready to come to your aid, because I know what’s at stake. And now,” he said, and I heard the chair beside mine creak, which told me that Condor was rising to his feet, “now we had better go over to the living room. We’ve talked for quite a long time, and my wife easily gets anxious. Even after years I have to be on my guard against putting a strain on her nerves. Someone once wounded by Fate remains vulnerable for ever.”","‘One more thing,’ he added in a low voice. ‘We doctors are compelled to bear in mind even the unforeseen, we must be prepared for all eventualities. If by any chance — I am stating a hypothetical case — something should occur in the meantime — I mean, should your strength give out or Edith ’s suspicions lead to some crisis, you must let me know at once. Not at any price must anything irrevocable happen during this short but critical period; on no account must she have a sudden shock. The slightest thing might be fatal. If you should not feel equal to your task, or if during this week you unwittingly give yourself away, don’t be ashamed — for heaven ’s sake don’t be ashamed to tell me! I’ve seen enough naked bodies and broken spirits. You can call on me or ring me up at any time of the day or night; I shall always be ready to come to your aid, for I know what’s at stake. And now’ — the chair beside me creaked and I realized that Condor was getting up — ‘we’d better go across to the other room. We have been talking for rather a long time, and my wife easily gets disquieted. Even I, after all these years, have still to be on my guard against upsetting her. Those whom Fate has dealt hard knocks remain vulnerable for ever afterwards.’"
"Er begann wieder auf und ab zu schreiten, heftiger noch als vorhin. Das Denken schien ihn anzustrengen. Jedesmal, wenn er in seinem Auf und Ab wiederkehrte, war sein Gesicht um einen Ton röter geschattet, wie dicke schwarze Wurzeln wuchsen die Adern aus den Schläfen. Endlich blieb er entschlossen stehen.","He began pacing again, more violently than before. Thinking seemed to strain him. Every time he returned to his ups and downs, his face was shaded a tone redder, the veins grew out of his temples like thick black roots. Finally he stopped resolutely.","He began pacing up and down again, even more vigorously than before. Thinking seemed to put a considerable strain on him. Every time he turned and came back towards me his face was a shade darker, and the veins at his temples stood out like fat black roots. At last he stopped pacing, with a determined expression on his face.","He began to pace up and down again, more violently than before. Thinking seemed to be a tremendous effort to him, for every time he turned my way in the midst of his pacing his face flushed a shade deeper and the veins now stood out on his temples like thick black roots. At last he came to a resolute halt."
"Im Seelischen wie im Körperlichen hat Geschwindigkeit gleichzeitig etwas Berauschendes und Betäubendes. Kaum daß der Wagen aus den Straßen hinaus ins freie Feld puffte, kam eine merkwürdige Entspannung über mich. Der Chauffeur fuhr scharf; wie schief weggehauen stürzten die Bäume, die Telegraphenstangen zurück, in den Dörfern taumelten Haus und Haus ineinander wie in einem verwackelten Bild, Meilensteine sprangen weiß auf und duckten sich schon wieder, noch ehe man ihre Ziffer ablesen konnte, und an der stürmischen Art, wie der Wind mir ins Gesicht schlug, spürte ich, in welchem verwegenen Tempo wir dahinbrausten. Aber noch stärker vielleicht war das Staunen über die Geschwindigkeit, mit der mein eigenes Leben gleichzeitig fortjagte: was alles an Entscheidungen hatte sich in diesen wenigen Stunden vollzogen! Sonst schwingen und schweben doch immer zwischen vagem Wunsch, dämmernder Absicht und endgültiger Vollführung in unzähligen Nuancen schattende Zwischengefühle, und es gehört zur geheimsten Lust des Herzens, mit Entschlüssen erst unsicher zu spielen, ehe man sie tatbewußt verwirklicht. Diesmal jedoch war alles mit traumhafter Geschwindigkeit auf mich niedergefahren, und wie hinter dem hämmernden Wagen Dörfer und Straßen und Bäume und Wiesen ins Nichts wegtaumelten, endgültig und ohne Wiederkehr, so sauste jetzt mit einem Ruck alles fort, was bisher mein tägliches Leben gewesen, die Kaserne, die Karriere, die Kameraden, die Kekesfalvas, das Schloß, mein Zimmer, die Reitschule, meine ganze, scheinbar so gesicherte und geregelte Existenz. Eine einzige Stunde hatte meine innere Welt verändert.","Both mentally and physically, speed is intoxicating and numbing at the same time. Hardly had the car puffed out of the streets into the open country than a strange relaxation came over me. The chauffeur drove sharply; the trees fell as if cut crookedly, the telegraph poles fell back, in the villages house and house tumbled into one another as in a blurred picture, milestones jumped up white and ducked down again before one could read their numbers, and the stormy way how with the wind hitting my face, I could feel the daring speed we were rushing along. But perhaps even stronger was the amazement at the speed with which my own life was rushing away at the same time: all the decisions that had taken place in those few hours! Elsewhere between vague desires, dim intentions and final realization, innumerable nuances of shadowy in-between feelings oscillate and hover, and it is part of the heart's most secret joy to play uncertainly with decisions before one consciously realizes them. This time, however, everything had come down on me with dreamlike speed, and just as behind the pounding car villages and roads and trees and meadows tumbled away into nothingness, finally and without return, so now everything that had been my daily life rushed away with a jerk, the Barracks, my career, my comrades, the Kekesfalvas, the castle, my room, the riding school, my whole existence, apparently so secure and regulated. A single hour had changed my inner world.","There is something heady and intoxicating about physical and mental speed alike. As soon as the car was out of the town streets and in open country I felt curiously relaxed. The chauffeur drove fast, trees and telegraph poles flew away behind us as if chopped down at an angle, as we passed through the villages house tottered against house, an unsteady picture, while white milestones loomed ahead and then retreated before you had time to read what they said. The strong wind blowing in our faces gave me some idea of the daring pace at which we were bowling along. But my astonishment at the speed with which my own life was racing on at the same time was even greater. I had taken so many decisions in these few hours! In the usual way, hazy ideas tinged with many shades of feeling hover between vague wishfulness, dawning intention and final performance, and it is even secretly pleasurable to begin by toying uncertainly with decisions before making up your mind to carry them through. This time, however, everything had happened at dreamlike speed, and as the villages and roads and trees and meadows retreated into the background, finally and never to return, as the car engine hammered away, everything that had made up my life until now was speeding into the distance: the barracks, my military career, my comrades, the Kekesfalvas, their castle, my room, the riding school, my entire apparently secure and well-regulated life. A single hour had changed my ideas of the world.","Speed has at once a stimulating and a numbing effect on both the mind and the body. No sooner had the car left the streets of the town and reached the open country than a remarkable feeling of relief and release came over me. The chauffeur drove at a furious pace; the trees and telegraph poles receded as though lopped off obliquely, houses staggered into each other as in a distorting mirror , milestones sprang up white and dived out of sight before one could read the figures on them, and from the violence of the wind on my face I could tell at what a terrific pace we were going. But even greater, perhaps, was my amazement at the speed at which my own life was rushing along: what decisions had been taken in these last few hours! As a rule, until dawning purpose and final action follow on vague desire, the mind hovers, vacillates, swings back and forth between countless shades of emotion, and it is one of the most secret pleasures of the heart to try to dally with resolves before putting them into effect. Now, however, everything has descended upon me with dream-like rapidity, and just as villages and streets, trees and meadows, fell away in the wake of the throbbing car into nothingness, finally and beyond recall, so now was all that had hitherto been my daily life, the barracks, my career, my comrades, the Kekesfalvas, the Schloss, my rooms, the riding-school, the whole of my apparently secure and well-regulated existence, rushing away at full speed. One single hour had changed the whole of my world."
"»Ich komme in zwanzig Minuten. Wir sprechen dann alles rasch durch. Am besten, Sie legen sich inzwischen auf das Sofa oder strecken sich hier in den Fauteuil. Sie gefallen mir nicht, mein Lieber, Sie sehen schrecklich übermüdet aus. Und wir müssen doch beide frisch und konzentriert sein.«","'I'll be there in twenty minutes. We'll talk everything through quickly. It's best if you lie down on the sofa in the meantime or stretch out here in the armchair. I don't like you, my dear, you look terribly tired. And we both need to be fresh and focused.«","“I’ll be back with you in twenty minutes, and then we can discuss it quickly. I think you ought to lie down on the sofa meanwhile, or stretch out in this easy chair. I don’t like the look of you, my dear fellow, you appear to be exhausted. And we must both be fresh and able to concentrate.”","‘I’ll be back in twenty minutes. Then we can talk the whole thing over quickly. I suggest that in the meanwhile you lie down on the sofa or make yourself comfortable in this armchair. I don’t like the look of you, my boy. You look frightfully fagged out. And we must both be fresh and clear-headed.’"
"»Sie beabsichtigen also, das … das Todesurteil nicht weiterzugeben?«","""So you intend not to pass on the . . . the death sentence?""",“Then you do not … do not intend to proceed with this death sentence?”,‘Then you do not propose ... to proceed with this death-sentence?’
"»Aber wieso denn? … Ich hab doch nur das Beste gewollt … Wenn ich Kekesfalva etwas erzählte, so war es doch nur aus … aus …«","""But why? ... I only wanted the best ... If I told Kekesfalva something, it was only for ... for ...""","“But how did I … I mean, I only acted for the best. If I told Kekesfalva anything it was only out of … out of …”",‘But why? I only meant to act for the best ... If I said something to Kekesfalva it was only out of ... out of ...’
"Aber Kreuzteufel, fahre ich mich selber an, ich bin doch nicht verpflichtet, täglich die halbe Stunde weit hinauszustiefeln. Und gemäß dem geheimen Gesetz der Gefühlsverschränkung, demzufolge ein Geärgerter seinen Ärger unbewußt gegen ganz Unbeteiligte weitergibt wie eine Billardkugel den empfangenen Stoß, wendet sich meine Verstimmung statt gegen Jozsi und Ferencz gegen die Kekesfalvas. Sie sollen nur einmal auf mich warten! Sollen sehen, daß ich mit Geschenken und Liebenswürdigkeiten nicht zu kaufen bin, daß ich nicht auf die Stunde antrete wie der Masseur oder Turnlehrer. Nur kein Präjudiz schaffen, Gewohnheit verpflichtet, und ich will mich nicht festlegen. So versitze ich in meinem dummen Trotz dreieinhalb Stunden bis halb acht im Kaffeehaus, einzig um mir einzureden und zu beweisen, daß ich vollkommen frei bin, zu kommen und zu gehen, wann ich will, und daß mir das gute Essen und die noblen Zigarren der Kekesfalvas total gleichgültig sind.","But devil of a cross, I snap at myself, I'm not obliged to trudge out for half an hour every day. And in accordance with the secret law of emotional entanglement, according to which an angry person unconsciously passes his anger on to those who are completely uninvolved like a billiard ball passing a shot on it, my annoyance turns towards the Kekesfalvas instead of towards Jozsi and Ferencz. You should only wait for me once! They should see that I can't be bought with presents and kindness, that I don't show up for class like the masseur or gym teacher. Just don't create prejudice, habit obliges, and I don't want to commit myself. So, in my stupid defiance, I sit in the coffee house for three and a half hours until half past seven, just to persuade myself and prove that I'm completely free to come and go as I please and that I can enjoy the good food and fine cigars of the Kekesfalvas are totally indifferent.","But damn it all, I snap at myself, I’m not in duty bound to spend half-an-hour trudging out there every day. And in line with the secret law of transference, whereby a man who feels annoyed unconsciously takes his annoyance out on perfectly innocent parties, like a billiard ball speeding this way and that, I turn my irritation not on Jozsi and Ferencz but on the Kekesfalvas. Let them wait for me in vain for once! Let them see that I’m not to be bought with presents and kind attentions, that I don’t turn up on the dot like the masseur or the gymnastics instructor. I’m not going to set a precedent, I won’t be bound to a habit, or tied down in any way. So in my stupidly defiant mood I sit in the café for three and a half hours, until seven-thirty, solely to prove to myself that I am entirely free, I can come and go as I please, and the Kekesfalvas’ good food and fine cigars are a matter of indifference to me.","But devil take it, I scolded myself, I am under no obligation to do the half-hour’s trudge out there every day! And in response to the secret law of mental association which makes a man in a temper unconsciously vent his spleen on some completely innocent person, just as a billiard ball transmits the impact of the cue to another ball , my displeasure was now directed, not against Jozsi and Ferencz, but against the Kekesfalvas. Let them wait for me for once. I’d show them that I was not to be bought with presents and attentions, that I was not going to turn up to the minute like a masseur or a gym instructor. One should never create precedents; a habit was liable to become a duty, and I was not going to tie myself down. And so in my pig-headedness I sat on and on in the café for three and a half hours, until half-past seven, merely in order to prove conclusively to myself that I was entirely at liberty to come and go as I pleased, and that good food and choice cigars were a matter of complete indifference to me."
"Nun bekam in ihrem achtundsiebzigsten Jahr, in eben demselben Hotel in Territtet, wo die Kaiserin Elisabeth immer wohnte, die Fürstin Orosvár eine ausgiebige Lungenentzündung. Auf welche Weise diese Nachricht bis nach Ungarn gedrungen war, bleibt schleierhaft. Aber ohne jede Verabredung untereinander sausten die Verwandten herbei, besetzten das Hotel, bestürmten den Arzt um Nachrichten und warteten; warteten auf ihren Tod.","Now, in her seventy-eighth year, in the very same hotel in Territtet where Empress Elisabeth always stayed, Princess Orosvár contracted severe pneumonia. How this news reached Hungary remains a mystery. But without any agreement among themselves, the relatives rushed over, occupied the hotel, besieged the doctor for news, and waited; were waiting for their death.","“At the age of seventy-eight, staying at the hotel in Territet that also enjoyed the custom of Empress Elisabeth, Princess Orosvár suffered a bad attack of pneumonia. How the news travelled from Switzerland back to Hungary remains a mystery. But without any mutual consultation the old lady’s relations came swarming in, booked out the hotel, pestered the Princess’s doctor for news, and waited and waited for her to die.","In her seventy-eighth year the Princess Orosvár had a very severe attack of pneumonia in the hotel in Territet which the Empress Elizabeth so frequently visited. How the news found its way to Hungary is a mystery. But without any prearranged plan the relatives came rushing along, packed out the hotel, pestered the doctor for news, and waited, waited, for the old lady’s death."
"Jener angekündigte Ausflug setzte bereits in aller Frühe mit einer kleinen Fanfare der Fröhlichkeit ein. Das erste, was ich beim Erwachen in meinem sauberen, von der hereinstrahlenden Sonne blank erhellten Gastzimmer vernahm, waren lachende Stimmen. Ich trat ans Fenster und erblickte, angestaunt vom ganzen Gesinde, den aus der Remise wohl noch zur Nachtzeit herangeholten mächtigen Reisewagen der alten Fürstin, ein herrlich antiquarisches Museumsstück, vor hundert, vielleicht schon vor hundertfünfzig Jahren vom Wiener Hofkarossier in der Seilerstätte für einen Urahnen gebaut. Das eigentliche Gehäuse der Karosse, gegen den Stoß der massigen Räder durch kunstvolle Federung geschützt, war in der Art der alten Tapeten mit Schäferszenen und antiken Allegorien ein wenig einfältig bemalt, vielleicht waren die einstmals lebhafteren Farben auch schon verblaßt. Innen verbarg die seidengepolsterte Karosse – wir hatten Gelegenheit, dies auf der Fahrt in vielen Einzelheiten auszuprobieren – allerlei raffinierte Bequemlichkeiten, wie aufklappbare Tischchen, Spiegelchen und Parfümflakons. Selbstverständlich mutete dies Riesenspielzeug eines verschollenen Jahrhunderts zunächst etwas unwirklich und maskeradenhaft an, doch gerade dies zeitigte den freundlichen Effekt, daß sich Diener und Gesinde heiter wie in Karnevalslaune bemühten, das schwerfällige Schiff der Landstraße richtig flott zu machen. Mit besonderem Eifer ölte der Maschinist der Zuckerfabrik die Räder und hämmerte prüfend am eisernen Beschlag, während, mit Sträußen wie zu einer Hochzeitsfahrt geschmückt, die vier Pferde angespannt wurden, was Jonak, dem alten Kutscher, Gelegenheit zu stolzen Belehrungen gab. Angetan mit der verblichenen fürstlichen Livree und überraschend beweglich auf seinen gichtigen Beinen, explizierte er dem jungen Gesinde, das zwar Bicycle fahren und allenfalls schon einen Motor handhaben, nicht aber einen Viererzug richtig zügeln konnte, all seine Kunstgriffe und Kenntnisse. Er war es auch, der noch gestern nachts dem Koch erläutert hatte, wie sehr bei Schnitzeljagden und ähnlichen Eskapaden die Ehre des Hauses es unbedingt erfordere, daß auch an den entlegensten Orten, in Wald und Wiese, ein Imbiß ebenso exakt und üppig serviert werde wie im Speisesaal des Schlosses. So räumte unter seiner Aufsicht der Diener damastene Tischtücher, Servietten und Silberzeug zusammen, alles in den wappengeschmückten Etuis der einstmals fürstlichen Silberkammer. Dann erst durfte der Koch, eine weißleinene Tellermütze über dem strahlenden Gesicht, den eigentlichen Proviant heranbringen, gebratene Hühner und Schinken und Pasteten, frisch gebackenes Weißbrot und ganze Batterien von Flaschen, jede einzeln in Stroh gebettet, um die Fährlichkeit holpriger Landstraßen unbeschädigt zu bestehen. Als Vertreter des Kochs wurde ein junger Bursche zum Servieren mitgesandt und ihm jener Platz hinter dem Wagen angewiesen, wo in früheren Zeiten neben dem diensthabenden Lakaien in farbigem Federhut der fürstliche Läufer stand.","That announced trip started early in the morning with a little fanfare of merriment. The first thing I heard when I woke up in my clean guest room, brightly lit by the incoming sun, were laughing voices. I went to the window and saw, amazed by all the servants, the old princess’s mighty traveling carriage, which had probably been fetched from the coach house at night, a wonderful antiquarian museum piece, built a hundred, maybe a hundred and fifty years ago by the Viennese court coachman in the Seilerstätte for an ancestor . The actual body of the carriage, protected against the impact of the massive wheels by an artful suspension, was painted in the manner of the old wallpaper with pastoral scenes and ancient allegories, perhaps the once livelier colors had faded. Inside, the silk-upholstered body concealed - we had the opportunity to try this out in many details on the journey - all sorts of refined conveniences, such as folding tables, little mirrors and perfume bottles. Of course, this gigantic toy of a bygone century seemed a bit unreal and masquerade-like at first, but this had the friendly effect that servants and servants cheerfully tried to get the sluggish ship on the road afloat, as if in a carnival mood. With particular zeal, the machinist of the sugar factory oiled the wheels and hammered the iron fittings, while the four horses, adorned with bouquets as if for a wedding trip, were hitched up, which gave Jonak, the old coachman, an opportunity to proudly lecture. Dressed in the faded princely livery and surprisingly agile on his gouty legs, he explained all his tricks and knowledge to the young servants, who could ride a bicycle and possibly operate an engine, but could not rein in a four-wheeler properly. It was also he who had explained to the chef last night how much the honor of the house requires that even in the most remote places, in the woods and meadows, a snack be served just as precisely and sumptuously as during scavenger hunts and similar escapades in the castle dining room. So under his supervision the servant put together damask tablecloths, serviettes and silverware, all in the coat of arms-decorated cases of the once princely silver collection. Only then was the cook allowed to bring in the actual provisions, a white linen flat cap over his beaming face, roasted chickens and ham and pies, freshly baked white bread and whole rows of bottles, each one bedded in straw so as to withstand the danger of bumpy country roads unscathed. A young boy was sent to serve as the cook's deputy, and he was given the place behind the carriage where, in earlier times, the princely bishop stood next to the footman on duty in a colored plumed hat.","The planned expedition began early in the morning with a little fanfare of merriment. When I woke up in my neat, clean guest room, with bright sunlight streaming in, the first thing I heard was the sound of laughing voices. I went over to the window, and saw all the household servants gathering in amazement around the old Princess’s large travelling carriage, which must have been brought out of the coach house overnight. It was a magnificent antique, a real museum piece, built a hundred or perhaps a hundred and fifty years ago by the Viennese court coach-builder in Seilerstätte for an ancestor of the Orosvár family. The body of the coach, protected from the jolting of the massive wheels by elaborate springing, was painted in a rather naive style emulating old wall hangings, with pastoral scenes and allegories from classical mythology, and perhaps the once bright colours had faded. The interior of the carriage with its silk upholstery—we had a chance to appreciate it in detail during the drive—offered all kinds of ingenious comforts, like folding tables, little mirrors, and flasks of perfume. Not surprisingly, this gigantic toy from a past century had something unreal about it at first, like a fancy-dress party, but the pleasing result was that the household servants and other staff willingly exerted themselves to get the heavy vehicle launched down the country road. The mechanic from the sugar factory busily greased the wheels and tapped the metalwork to test that it was sound, while the four horses, adorned with bunches of flowers as if they were taking the carriage to a wedding, were put between the shafts, giving Jonak the old coachman a chance of proudly telling everyone what to do. Wearing his faded princely livery, and surprisingly spry on his gouty legs, he explained the tricks of his trade to the younger folk, who might be able to ride bicycles and drive a car if necessary, but not a coach and four. It was also Jonak who had told the cook last night how, when there were paper chases or similar amusements in the old days, the honour of the house required a lavish repast to be served in the most remote places, in woods and meadows, as neatly as if it were being eaten in the castle dining room. Under his supervision, the servants packed up damask tablecloths, napkins and cutlery in cases adorned with a crest to show that they contained the princely silverware. Only then did the cook, a white linen chef’s toque above his beaming face, bring out the picnic food itself: roast chickens, ham and pies, freshly baked white bread, and whole batteries of bottles, each resting individually in a bed of straw so as to survive the jolts as the carriage went along the country road. A young fellow representing the cook went along with us to serve the picnic, and was given the place behind the carriage where, in the old days, the princely courier stood beside the footman on duty in his feathered hat.","The great day of our expedition was ushered in at a very early hour with a little fanfare of hilarity. The first thing I heard on awakening in my cosy room, into which the morning sun was pouring its bright rays, was the sound of merry laughter. I went to the window and saw the whole staff standing about in the courtyard, gaping at the old Princess’s vast travelling-coach, which had obviously been taken out of the coach-house during the night. It was a marvellous museum piece, built in Vienna for an ancestor of Prince Orosvár a hundred or perhaps even a hundred and fifty years previously by the coach-maker to the Imperial Court. The actual body of the coach, which was protected by artistically designed springs against the jolting of the mighty wheels, was painted with the Arcadian and classical scenes to be found in old tapestries; no doubt the colours, which were somewhat crude, had originally been more vivid and had now faded. The inside of the silk-upholstered coach — and we had ample opportunity during our drive of exploring it in detail — contained all kinds of cunning contraptions, such as little collapsible tables, mirrors and scent-bottles. At first, of course, this vast plaything of a bygone century struck one as being somewhat unreal, a stage property out of a masquerade, but it was for this very reason that footmen and servants threw themselves so merrily and in such carnival spirit into the task of safely launching the ponderous vessel on wheels. The mechanic from the sugar-factory was oiling the wheels with particular zest and testing the metal frame with his hammer. Meanwhile, the four horses, decked out as though for a wedding with garlands of flowers, were being harnessed — an operation that gave Jonak, the old coachman, ample opportunity for airing his superior knowledge. Dressed in the faded princely livery, and displaying surprising agility despite his gouty legs, he was initiating into the tricks of his trade the younger members of the staff, who, although they might be able to ride bicycles and if need be cope with the mechanism of a motor-car, had not the vaguest idea how to drive a four-in-hand. It was he, too, who the night before had pointed out to the cook that when the princely household indulged in fêtes-champêtres its honour absolutely demanded that even in the most remote corners of the woods and meadows the refreshments should be served as lavishly and punctiliously as in the dining-room of the Schloss. Under his supervision, therefore, the footman was stowing away damask table-cloths, napkins and silver in cases bearing the Orosvár coat of arms. Not until this was done to his satisfaction was the cook, a white linen trencher-cap crowning his beaming features, allowed to bring along the actual provisions: roast chickens and hams and pies, freshly baked bread and whole batteries of bottles, all packed in straw so that they might withstand the perils of the bumpy roads and arrive unbroken. A young lad was sent along as the cook’s representative to serve the viands, and was assigned the place on the box where, in the Princess’s time, a princely lackey had stood side by side with a liveried servant in a hat with a cockade."
"Da klirrt ein Messer energisch ans Glas; als ob der scharfe Stahl den Lärm zerschnitten hätte, wird es plötzlich still. Der Oberst ist aufgestanden und beginnt eine Rede. Er spricht, mit beiden Händen sich angestrengt an dem Tisch festhaltend und den stämmigen Körper vor-und rückwärts schwingend, als säße er zu Pferd. Den Einsatz bildet mit hartem knarrenden Anruf das Wort »Kameraden«; scharf skandierend und die »R« rollend wie eine Sturmtrommel, formuliert er seinen wohlvorbereiteten Speech. Angestrengt höre ich hin, aber der Kopf will nicht mit. Nur einzelne Worte höre ich schnarren und schmettern. »… Ehre der Arrmee … österreichischer Rreitergeist … Treue zum Rrregiment … alter Kamerad …« – aber dazwischen wispern geisterhaft andere Worte, leise, flehende, zärtliche wie aus einer anderen Welt. Von innen spricht der Brief mit. »Unendlich Geliebter … fürchte Dich nicht … ich kann nicht länger leben, nimmst Du mir das Recht, Dich zu lieben …« und dazwischen wieder die kraxenden R. »… er hat seine Kameraden in der Ferne nicht vergessen … nicht das Vaterrland … nicht sein Österreich …« und abermals dazwischen die andere Stimme wie ein Schluchzen, wie ein erstickter Schrei. »Nur erlauben sollst Du mir, daß ich Dich liebe … nur ein Zeichen sollst Du mir geben …«","Then a knife clangs energetically against the glass; as if the sharp steel had cut through the noise, it suddenly falls silent. The Colonel has stood up and begins a speech. He speaks, both hands tightly gripping the table and swinging his stocky body back and forth as if he were on horseback. The entry is the word »comrades« with a hard creaking call; chanting sharply and rolling the ""R"" like a storm drum, he formulates his well-prepared speech. I listen hard, but my head doesn't want to follow. I only hear single words rasping and blaring. ""... Honor of the army... Austrian cavalry spirit... Loyalty to the regiment... old comrade..."" - but in between whisper other words, soft, pleading, tender, as if from another world. The letter speaks from within. ""Infinitely beloved... don't be afraid... I can't live any longer if you take away my right to love you..."" and in between again the clinking Rs. ""... he hasn't forgotten his comrades far away... not his fatherland... not his Austria …” and again the other voice intervened like a sob, like a choked scream. »You should only allow me to love you… you should only give me a sign…«","Then a knife strikes a glass energetically, and there is sudden silence, as if the sharp steel cut through the noise. The Colonel has risen to his feet and is embarking on a speech. He leans both hands on the table to steady himself as he speaks, and his sturdy body moves back and forth rhythmically as if he were on horseback. He opens by barking out the word “Comrades!” with the letter r rolled like a drum beating for the attack, and then launches into his well-prepared address to us. I listen hard, but my mind refuses to take it in. I hear only a few phrases, emphatically spoken and with further rolling of the r-sound: “ … honour of the arrrmy … the spirit of the Austrrrian cavalrrry … loyalty to the rrregiment.” But in between I hear the ghostly whisper of other words, soft, pleading, loving, as if they came from another world. The letter is speaking to me at the same time: “My very dearly beloved … don’t be afraid … I will not, cannot go on living if you refuse me the right to love you …” Then the Colonel’s rolling r intrudes again: “ … he has not forgotten his comrrrades while far away … nor his Austrrrian fatherland …” The other voice comes in again like a sob, a muffled cry: “Tell me at once … a single word will do … that I am not repellent to you …”","Then a knife was rattled vigorously against a glass, and there was a sudden hush, as though the sharp steel had cut right through the din. The Colonel had risen and was about to make a speech. Gripping the table with both hands, he swung his stocky body backwards and forwards as though he were on horseback. Starting off with a harsh, strident ‘Kame-rr-aden,’ he barked out his well-prepared speech, rhythmically accentuating the syllables. I listened attentively, but my brain refused to function. I could hear only isolated phrases vibrating through the room: ‘... hon’r of the army ... spirit of the Austrian cav’lry ... loyalty to the reg’ment... old comr’de .’ But in between these I could catch the ghostly whisper of other words, soft, pleading words, coming as though from another world: ‘ My heart’s beloved ... do not be afraid ... I cannot go on living if you take from me the right to love you ...’ And in between these, again, the Colonel’s crisp syllables: ‘... has not forgotten his comr’des ... so far away ... or the Fatherland ... or his native Austria ...’ And once again the other voice, like a sob, like a stifled scream: ‘All I ask is that you should let me love you ... all I ask is that you should give me a sign ...’"
"Ich drückte ihm die Hand. Wir gingen die Treppe hinab. Die Mechaniker hatten die blauen Kittel bereits ausgezogen, das Automobil stand bereit; zwei Minuten später knatterten wir mit dem Wagen hinaus auf die Chaussee.","I squeezed his hand. We went down the stairs. The mechanics had already taken off their blue overalls, the automobile was ready; two minutes later we rattled out onto the highway in the car.","I shook his hand warmly, and we went downstairs. The mechanics had taken off their blue overalls, the car was ready, and two minutes later it was chugging along the road with us inside.","I gripped his hand. We went downstairs.

"Es war etwas derart grob Zuschlagendes in ihrer Art, daß ich den Stoß bis in mein schlechtes Gewissen hinein spürte. Zweifellos, ich mußte mich verraten haben. Um abzulenken – denn ich kannte schon das Gefährliche ihrer Reizbarkeit in solchen Augenblicken – suchte ich die Auseinandersetzung ins locker Spaßhafte abzuschieben.",There was something so rude in her manner that I felt the shove in my guilty conscience. No doubt I must have given myself away. In order to divert attention - because I already knew how dangerous her irritability was at such moments - I tried to shift the argument into light fun.,"She spoke so forcefully that she hit my guilty conscience hard. I must certainly have given myself away. To distract her mind—for I knew by now how dangerous her petulance at such moments could be—I tried to strike a light, humorous note.",There was something so offensive in her tone that her words got right under my skin. My conscience pricked me. I must have given myself away. In order to divert her anger — for by now I was familiar with the dangerous consequences of her irritability — I tried to introduce a certain spirit of jocularity into the whole discussion.
"Aber was jetzt geschieht, ist furchtbar. Der vorgebeugte Oberkörper fährt mit einem Ruck zurück, als wollte er einem Schlage ausweichen; gleichzeitig stürzt von innen ein Guß von Blut in die bleichen Wangen, die eben noch offenen Lippen pressen sich scharf ineinander, und nur die Augen starren unbeweglich auf mich mit einem solchen Ausdruck von Schrecken, wie er mir noch nie im Leben entgegengefahren ist. Im nächsten Augenblick geht durch den ganzen aufgekrampften Körper ein Ruck. Sie stemmt sich, stützt sich mit beiden Händen am Tisch empor, daß die Schale darauf klappert und klirrt, gleichzeitig fällt etwas hart von ihrem Fauteuil auf den Boden, Holz oder Metall. Noch immer hält sie sich mit beiden Händen an dem wankenden Tisch fest, noch immer schüttert es diesen kindleichten Leib durch und durch; aber trotzdem, sie flüchtet nicht weg, sie klammert sich nur noch verzweifelter an die schwere Tischplatte. Und immer wieder dieses Schüttern, dieses Zittern von den angekrampften Fäusten bis hinauf ins Haar. Und plötzlich bricht es heraus: ein Schluchzen, wild, elementar wie ein erstickter Schrei.","But what is happening now is terrible. The bent upper body jerks back as if trying to avoid a blow; at the same time a gush of blood rushes from within into the pale cheeks, the just open lips are pressed sharply together, and only the eyes stare motionless at me with an expression of terror such as I have never seen in my life. In the next moment a jerk goes through the whole tense body. She braces herself, supports herself with both hands on the table so that the bowl on it rattles and jingles, at the same time something falls hard from her armchair onto the floor, wood or metal. She still holds on to the swaying table with both hands, it still shakes her childish body through and through; but still, she doesn't flee, she just clings more desperately to the heavy tabletop. And again and again this shaking, this trembling from the clenched fists up to the hair. And suddenly it breaks out: a sob, wild, elemental like a choked scream.","Something terrible happens next. She had been leaning slightly forward, but now she flinches abruptly back as if avoiding a blow. At the same time the blood rushes into her pale cheeks, the lips that were half open just now are pressed hard together, and only her eyes keep staring at me with an expression of horror such as I have never seen in my life before. Next moment a paroxysm passes right through her convulsed body. She braces herself on the table with both hands, making the bowl of roses clink and jangle, and at the same time something hard, made of wood or metal, falls from her chair to the ground. Both her hands are still clutching the table, which sways, her childlike body is shaken again and again, but all the same she does not run away, she only clings even more desperately to the heavy tabletop. And again and again that shaking, those tremors run from her cramped fists all the way up to her hairline. Suddenly she bursts into sobs, a wild, elemental sound like a stifled scream.","What now happened was appalling. The bowed head and shoulders jerked backwards, as though to avoid a blow; the blood came rushing to the pale cheeks; the lips, parted the moment before, were pressed sharply together, and only the eyes stared fixedly at me with an expression of horror such as I had never before encountered in my whole life. The next moment a shudder passed through the whole convulsed body. With both hands she levered, heaved herself up by the table so that the bowl on it rocked and rattled; and as she did so some hard object, either of wood or metal, fell clattering to the ground from her chair. She continued to hold on with both hands to the swaying table, her body, light as a child’s, still shaking all over; yet she did not run away, she clung more desperately than ever to the heavy table-top.

And suddenly there burst forth a storm of sobbing, wild, elemental, like a stifled scream."
"Und Kanitz brauchte einige Zeit, um wieder seine Fassung zu finden. Hart mußte er den Atem zügeln, ehe er mit dem Ton biedermännischer Überzeugung erwidern konnte: ›Ja, gnädiges Fräulein, dafür kann ich mich so gut wie verpflichten. Das wird jedenfalls durchzusetzen sein.‹«","And Kanitz needed some time to regain his composure. He had to hold his breath hard before he could reply with a tone of staid conviction: 'Yes, madam, I can as good as oblige myself to that. In any case, that will be enforceable.’”","“It took Kanitz some time to recover his composure. He had to force himself to breathe regularly before he could reply, in a tone of matter-of-fact conviction, ‘Yes, dear lady, I can as good as vouch for it that you would at least get that sum.’”","And it was some time before Kanitz recovered his self-possession. He had to struggle to control his breathing before he could reply in tones of sober conviction: ‘Yes, gnädiges Fräulein, I can almost stake my word on that. You ought at any rate to get as much as that.’"

"Wie lange dies dauerte, weiß ich nicht. Solche Erlebnisse sind jenseits der gewöhnlichen Zeit; es ging etwas Betäubendes, Betörendes, Hypnotisches von diesem scheuen Streifen und Streicheln aus, das mich mehr erregte und erschütterte als damals jener jähe, brennende Kuß. Noch immer fand ich nicht die Kraft, die Hand zurückzuziehen – »nur dulden sollst du meine Liebe«, erinnerte ich mich – ich genoß in einer dumpfen Traumhaftigkeit dies ständige Rieseln über meiner Haut bis in die Nerven und ließ es geschehen, machtlos, wehrlos und doch zugleich im Unterbewußtsein beschämt, so über alles Maß geliebt zu werden und meinerseits nichts zu empfinden als eine wirre Scheu, einen verlegenen Schauer.","I don't know how long this lasted. Such experiences are beyond ordinary time; There was something intoxicating, beguiling, hypnotic about this shy brushing and caressing, which aroused and shook me more than that sudden, burning kiss did. I still couldn't find the strength to pull my hand back - ""You should only put up with it, my love,"" I remembered - in a dull dreamlike quality I enjoyed this constant trickling over my skin down to my nerves and let it happen, powerless, defenseless and but at the same time subconsciously ashamed to be loved beyond all measure and to feel nothing on my part but confused shyness, an embarrassed shiver.","I don’t know how long this went on. Such experiences are outside ordinary time, and that shy stroking and caressing aroused some kind of intoxicating, beguiling and hypnotic feeling that moved and shook me more than her earlier fierce, burning kiss. I still could not find the strength to withdraw my hand—“I cannot go on living if you refuse me the right to love you,” I remembered her saying—and in a hazy, dreamy state of mind I was enjoying that constant caress moving over my skin and into my tingling nerves. I let her go on , I was powerless, defenceless, yet at the same time ashamed to be loved so much when I felt nothing in return but a timid confusion, a frisson of embarrassment.","How long this lasted I do not know. Such experiences cannot be measured in terms of ordinary time. This shy fondling and stroking, which affected and agitated me more profoundly than that first sudden, burning kiss, had a hypnotic, bewitching, narcotic effect on my senses. I was still unable to summon up the strength to withdraw my hand. I remembered those words of hers, ‘I only ask you to bear with my love,’ and in a dim dream, as it were, I enjoyed the rippling of her fingers over my skin, the tingling of my nerves — I let it happen, powerless, defenceless, yet subconsciously ashamed at the thought of being loved so infinitely, while for my part feeling nothing but shy confusion, an embarrassed thrill."

"Nun geschieht mir etwas Sonderbares. Ich bin doch sonst leidlich beherrscht und habe feste, sichere Hände. Aber dieser unvermutete Ausbruch hat mich derart erschüttert, daß ich alle Glieder wie gelähmt fühle; nie hat mich irgend etwas in meinem Leben so bestürzt gemacht. Mühsam hole ich eine Zigarette aus der Dose, reiche sie hinüber und zünde ein Streichholz an. Aber beim Hinüberreichen zittern mir die Finger dermaßen, daß ich das brennende Zündhölzchen nicht gerade zu halten vermag und die Flamme im Leeren zuckt und verlischt. Ich muß ein zweites Streichholz anzünden; auch dieses schwankt unsicher in meiner zitternden Hand, ehe es ihre Zigarette entflammt. Sie aber muß unverkennbar an der augenfälligen Ungeschicklichkeit meine Erschütterung wahrgenommen haben, denn es ist eine ganz andere, eine staunend beunruhigte Stimme, mit der sie mich leise fragt:","Now something strange is happening to me. Otherwise I'm fairly well controlled and have firm, sure hands. But this unexpected outburst has shaken me so much that I feel paralyzed in all my limbs; nothing in my life has ever upset me so much. I laboriously pull a cigarette out of the tin, hand it over and light a match. But when I hand it over, my fingers tremble so much that I can't hold the burning match straight and the flame flickers in the empty space and goes out. I have to light a second match; this also wavers uncertainly in my trembling hand before it ignites her cigarette. But she must have unmistakably perceived my shock from the obvious clumsiness, because it is a completely different, an astonished, worried voice in which she asks me quietly:","And now something strange happens to me. I am usually in reasonably good control of myself, and I have firm, steady hands. But this unexpected outburst has shaken me so much that I feel as if I were the one paralysed; never in my life has anything upset me so badly. With difficulty, I get a cigarette out of my case, hand it to her and strike a match. But as I hold the match to the cigarette my fingers are trembling so badly that I cannot keep it straight, and the little flame flickers and goes out. I have to strike a second match, and this one too wavers in my trembling hand before I light the cigarette with it. However, she must have noticed my obvious clumsiness, shaken as I was, for now she asks me, quietly, in a very different, an amazed and concerned voice, “Oh, what’s the matter?","And now something strange happened to me. I am as a rule tolerably controlled and have firm, steady hands. But this unexpected outburst had so shattered me that I felt as though my limbs were paralysed; I had never felt so stunned in my life. Laboriously taking a cigarette out of my case, I handed it to her and lit a match. But my fingers trembled so violently that I could not hold the match steady, and the flame flickered in the empty air and went out. I had to light a second match, and this too swayed unsteadily in my trembling hand before her cigarette was lit. My obvious clumsiness must have made her realize the state I was in, and it was in quite another, a surprised, disquieted voice that she now asked me gently:"

Kapitel 19,Chapter 19,"My hands were shaking, the thudding in my temples grew louder and louder, so horrified, so shaken was I to find that I was loved with such desperation.",My hands trembled and the hammering at my temples grew more and more insistent; my consternation and dismay at being loved so desperately were boundless.
"Nun konnte ich meinen Unmut nicht länger beherrschen. Denn hier lag mein empfindlichster Punkt. Ich glaube, ich habe schon einmal gesagt, wie sehr mich’s quälte, in unserem Regiment zu den Offizieren zu gehören, die keinen Heller eigenes Vermögen besaßen, und bloß auf die Gage und den recht knappen Zuschuß meiner Tante angewiesen zu sein; schon in unserem eigenen Kreis ging’s mir immer scharf an die Leber, wenn man in meiner Gegenwart verächtlich von Geld sprach, als ob es wie Disteln wüchse. Hier war mein wunder Punkt. Hier war ich lahm, hier trug ich meine Krücken. Einzig deshalb erregte es mich so unverhältnismäßig, daß dieses verwöhnte, verzogene Geschöpf, das doch selber an seiner Zurückgesetztheit höllisch litt, die meine nicht begriff. Gegen meinen Willen wurde ich beinahe grob.","Now I could no longer contain my anger. Because here was my most sensitive point. I think I've said before how much it tormented me to be one of the officers in our regiment who didn't have a penny of their own, and to have to rely solely on my aunt's fee and the rather small allowance; Even in our own circle it always hurt my liver when people spoke contemptuously of money in my presence, as if it were growing like thistles. Here was my sore point. Here I was lame, here I wore my crutches. That's the only reason why it excited me so disproportionately that this spoiled, spoiled creature, who suffered like hell from his backwardness, didn't understand mine. I almost became rude against my will.","But here I couldn’t control my annoyance any longer, for she had hit my most sensitive point. I think I have already said how much I disliked being one of those officers in our regiment who had not a penny of their own, and having to depend on my pay and my aunt’s small allowance went against the grain with me in military circles when other men spoke lightly of money in front of me, as if it grew on trees. This was my sore point, this was where I was lame, and had to rely on crutches of my own. That was the only reason why it annoyed me out of all proportion to hear this spoilt, wilful girl, even though she suffered infernal torments herself because of her disadvantages, unable to understand mine. Against my will, I spoke almost roughly.","And now I could no longer restrain my indignation. For this was a point on which I was highly sensitive. I believe I have already said what a torture it was to me to be one of the officers without private means and to be dependent merely on my pay and the wretched little allowance made me by my aunt. Even in my own circle it always caught me on the raw to hear money spoken of contemptuously in my presence just as if it grew like thistles. This was my sore spot. In this respect I was lame, I walked on crutches. It was solely for this reason that I was so immoderately upset by the fact that this spoiled, pampered creature, who herself suffered all the pangs of hell at being at such a physical disadvantage, should not understand my feelings. In spite of myself I was almost rude."

"»Du Hofmiller, ich bin nicht dein Vormund und hab dir keine Lektionen zu erteilen. Aber glaub’s einem Kameraden, der die Chose durchgemacht hat: das macht sehr viel aus, wenn man mit einem Ruck von oben nach unten rutscht, von seinem Offizierspferd mitten hinein in den Dreck … das sagt dir einer, der hier in diesem schäbigen kleinen Zimmer gesessen ist von zwölf Uhr mittags bis in die Dunkelheit und genau dasselbe sich vorgeredet hat, dieses ›Das macht mir nix aus‹. Knapp vor halb zwölf habe ich mich abgemeldet beim Rapport. In die Offiziersmeß zu die andern wollt ich mich nicht mehr setzen und in Zivil wiederum am hellichten Tag nicht über die Straßen. So habe ich mir das Zimmer da genommen – jetzt verstehst auch, warum ich immer grad dasselbe will – und hier hab ich gewartet, bis es dunkel wird, damit keiner mitleidig hinblinzeln kann, wie der Balinkay abpascht im schäbigen grauen Sakko und mit einem Melonenhut auf dem Schädel. Da, an dem Fenster bin ich gestanden, genau an dem Fenster da, und hab noch einmal hinuntergeschaut auf den Bummel. Dort sind die Kameraden gegangen, jeder in Uniform, aufrecht und grad und frei, jeder ein kleiner Herrgott, und jeder hat gewußt, wer er ist und wohin er g’hört. Da hab ich erst gespürt, daß ich nur mehr ein Dreck bin in dieser Welt; mir war, als hätt ich mir die Haut heruntergerissen mit meiner Uniform. Natürlich denkst jetzt: Unsinn – ein Tuch ist blau und das andere schwarz oder grau, und es bleibt wurscht, ob man einen Säbel spazierenführt oder einen Regenschirm. Aber den Ruck spür ich noch heut in allen Knochen, wie ich dann nachts hinausgeschlichen bin an den Bahnhof, und an der Ecke sind zwei Ulanen an mir vorbeigekommen und keiner hat salutiert. Und wie ich dann meinen Koffer selbst hin’schleppt hab in die dritte Klass’ und zwischen den schwitzigen Bauernweibern gesessen bin und den Arbeitern – ja, ich weiß schon, daß das alles dumm ist und ungerecht und unsere sogenannte Standesehre ein rechter Pflanz – aber man hat’s eben im Blut nach acht Jahren Dienst und vier Jahren Kadettenschul! Wie ein Verstümmelter kommt man sich im Anfang vor oder wie einer, der ein Geschwür hat mitten im G’sicht. Gott schütz dich, daß du’s selber durchmachen mußt! Für kein Geld in der ganzen Welt möcht ich den Abend noch einmal miterleben, wie ich damals hier weggeschlichen und jeder Laterne ausgebogen bin bis zum Bahnhof. Und dabei war das erst der Anfang.«","'You Hofmiller, I'm not your guardian and I have no lessons to teach you. But believe it from a comrade who's been through it: it matters a great deal when you slide from top to bottom in one fell swoop, off your officer's horse right into the dirt... that's what someone who's been sitting here in this shabby little room tells you is from noon until dark and exactly the same thing was said to himself, this 'I don't mind'. Just before half past eleven I checked out at the report. I no longer wanted to sit in the officers' mess with the others, and in civilian clothes I didn't want to walk the streets in broad daylight. So I took that room – now you understand why I always want the same thing – and I waited here until dark so that no one could sympathize with Balinkay in a shabby gray jacket and a bowler hat the skull. There, I stood at the window, right there at the window, and looked down once more at the stroll. There the comrades left, everyone in uniform, upright and upright and free, everyone a little Lord, and everyone knew who he was and where he belonged. It was only then that I felt that I was just dirt in this world; I felt as if I had torn my skin off with my uniform. Of course you're now thinking: nonsense - one cloth is blue and the other black or gray, and it doesn't matter whether you're carrying a saber or an umbrella. But I can still feel the jolt in all my bones today, when I crept out to the station at night and two Uhlans passed me on the corner and nobody saluted. And when I dragged my suitcase myself to the third grade and sat between the sweaty peasant women and the workers - yes, I know that it's all stupid and unfair and our so-called honor of status is a real plant - but man It's in your blood after eight years of service and four years of cadet school! At first you feel like a mutilated person or like someone who has a boil in the middle of his face. God bless you that you have to go through it yourself! For no money in the whole world would I want to relive the evening when I snuck out of here and bent out of every lamppost to the train station. And that was just the beginning.«","“Look, Hofmiller, I’m not responsible for you, and I’m not about to read you a lecture. But I’ve been through this kind of thing myself, and you may believe me when I tell you it does make a difference, a great difference, when you suddenly go from the top to the bottom, off your cavalry officer’s horse and into humdrum everyday life … and I’m saying this to you as a man who once sat in this shabby little room from twelve noon until darkness fell, telling myself just the same as you—it won’t make any difference. I’d resigned my commission around eleven-thirty, and I didn’t want to sit in the officers’ mess with the others or walk down the street in broad daylight in civilian clothes. So I took this room—now you know why I always want it again— and I waited here until it was dark so that no one could give a pitying glance on seeing me slink away in a shabby grey coat with a bowler hat on my head. I stood at that window, that very window, and I looked down once more at the others strolling around. There were my comrades, all in uniform, upright and free, each of them a little god, and each of them knew who he was and where he belonged. And I felt that I was nothing now but a speck of dirt. It was as if I’d stripped off my skin along with my uniform. Of course you’re thinking, nonsense— one coat is blue, another is black or grey, and who cares if you go walking with a sword beside you or an umbrella in your hand instead? But I can still feel the shock, I feel it to the marrow of my bones, of stealing out by night on my way to the station, and how two lancers passed me on the corner and neither of them saluted. And I remember humping my own case into a third-class carriage, where I sat among the sweaty farmers’ wives and labourers—yes, I know all this is stupid, and unjust, and the military man’s idea of his honour is only a delusion—but after eight years of service and four years of military academy it’s in your blood. You feel maimed at first, or like someone with an oozing sore in the middle of his face. God keep you from going through that yourself! I wouldn’t live that evening all over again for any money, the evening when I stole away from here, making a detour around every lamp post until I reached the station. And that was only the beginning.”","‘Look here, Hofmiller, I’m not your guardian, and it’s not for me to give you a lecture. But believe a comrade who’s been through the mill. It does matter, it matters a very great deal when you go slithering in one fell swoop from top to bottom, from your officer’s horse straight into the mire ... and the man who is telling you this once sat here in this dingy little room from noon till dusk, saying exactly the same thing to himself — “it doesn’t matter a damn to me”. Just before half-past eleven I reported to the Colonel for the last time. I didn’t want to sit down with the others in the mess, nor did I want to walk through the streets in mufti in broad daylight, and so I took this little room — now you’ll understand why I always like to have the same one — and waited here until it was dark so that no one should be able to cast an eye of pity on Balinkay as he slunk off in his shabby grey coat and a bowler hat. I stood over there at the window, that very window, and took one last look at the crowd in the street. There they were, my fellow-officers, striding along in uniform, erect and free, every one of them a little tin god, and each of them knew who he was and where he belonged. It was then that I felt for the first time that I was nothing more than a speck of dust on the face of the earth; it was as though in stripping off my uniform I had stripped off my skin. Of course, you’ll be thinking it’s all nonsense, one piece of cloth is blue and another is black and another grey, and it doesn’t matter two hoots whether one carries a sword or an umbrella. But I still shudder when I remember how I crept off to the station, and how two Uhlans passed me at the corner and neither of them saluted. And how I carried my little trunk myself into a third-class carriage and sat among sweating peasant women and workmen. Oh, yes, I know it’s all stupid and all wrong and that our so-called code of honour is all my eye — but it’s in your blood after years of service and four years at the military academy. At first you feel like a man who’s lost an arm or a leg or has a boil bang in the middle of his face. God forbid that you should ever have to go through all that! I wouldn’t go through that evening again for all the money in the world — that evening when I slunk away and avoided every street lamp until I reached the station. And that was only the beginning.’"
"Mit einem Sprung hatte sie meine Sachen geholt. Glücklicherweise war der Diener zum Wagen geeilt; so konnte ich unbemerkt an den Hofgebäuden vorbeikommen, und im Park beschleunigte dann die rasende Angst, ich müßte jemandem Rede stehen, meinen Schritt. Zum zweitenmal flüchtete ich, geduckt und scheu wie ein Dieb, aus dem verhängnisvollen Hause.","With one jump she had fetched my things. Luckily the servant had hastened to the carriage; In this way I could pass the courtyard buildings unnoticed, and in the park the raging fear that I would have to answer someone's word quickened my pace.

Luckily Josef had hurried out to the car, so I was able to get past the outbuildings of the house unnoticed. Once I was in the park, the fear of having to answer questions quickened my pace.

"Es übermannte ihn mitten im Wort. Er schluckte und schluchzte und schämte sich zugleich seiner Rührung, die mich allmählich selber ergriff. Denn wer könnte fühllos solcher Dankbarkeit widerstehen? Ich hoffe, nie ein eitler Mensch gewesen zu sein, nie einer, der sich selbst bewunderte oder überschätzte, und glaube auch heute weder an meine Güte noch an meine Kraft. Aber von dieser wilden und dankbaren Begeisterung der andern strömte eine heiße Welle von Zuversicht unwiderstehlich in mich über. Weggetragen wie von goldenem Wind war mit einmal alle Furcht, alle Feigheit. Warum sollte ich mich nicht sorglos lieben lassen, wenn es die andern so glücklich machte? Geradezu ungeduldig wurde ich schon, hinüberzugehen in den Raum, den ich vorgestern so verzweifelt verlassen.","It overwhelmed him mid-word. He swallowed and sobbed and at the same time was ashamed of his emotion, which was gradually taking hold of me. For who could callously resist such gratitude? I hope I have never been a vain man, never one who admired or overestimated himself, and even today I believe neither in my kindness nor in my strength. But from this wild and grateful enthusiasm of the others, a hot wave of confidence flowed irresistibly into me. Suddenly all fear, all cowardice was swept away as if by a golden wind. Why shouldn't I let myself be loved carefree when it made others so happy? I was getting really impatient to go over to the room I left so desperately the day before yesterday.","He was overcome even as he spoke. He swallowed, and sobbed, and was ashamed of his emotion, which was gradually infecting me. For who could be cold in the face of such gratitude? I hope I have never been a vain man, one of those who admire or overestimate themselves, and to this day I do not consider myself either good or strong. But a warm surge of confidence, created by the wildly enthusiastic gratitude of the others, was irresistibly streaming into me. All my fear was carried away as if on a golden wind. Why shouldn’t I let myself be loved with an easy mind, when it made others so happy? I was positively impatient to go into the room that I had left in such desperation the day before yesterday.","He broke down as he said these words. He swallowed and sobbed, ashamed of his emotion, which gradually began to affect me too. For who could be unmoved by such gratitude? I don’t believe I have ever been a vain man, one who admires or over-estimates himself, and even today I have little faith either in my own goodness or my own strength. But the wild and frenzied gratitude of these two sent out a warm wave of confidence that carried me away irresistibly. Of a sudden all my fear, all my cowardice, was swept away as by a golden summer wind. Why should I not let myself be loved in all heedlessness, if it made others so happy? I grew positively eager to enter the room which the day before yesterday I had left in such despair."
"»Ach, das wird sich schon geben! Sie wissen doch am besten, wie wetterwendisch bei ihr die Launen umspringen.

And Ilona phoned me that it was just a matter of a few days' delay.'","So I intentionally pretend not to understand, and say very casually, “Oh, that will soon pass off!

And Ilona telephoned me to say the trip was only being put off for a few days.”","‘Oh, that’ll soon pass,’ I said with some indifference. ‘You should know by now how capricious she is.

"Aber Sie müssen, lieber Herr Leutnant, diese unerwartete Umschaltung zu begreifen suchen – ich möchte mich nicht pathetisch ausdrücken und sagen, daß in unserem Freunde plötzlich das Gewissen erwacht sei. Jedoch seit jenem einen Federstrich war die äußere Situation zwischen den beiden Partnern entscheidend verändert. Bedenken Sie: während dieser ganzen zwei Tage hatte Kanitz als Käufer gegen dieses arme Mädchen als gegen die Verkäuferin gekämpft. Sie war die Gegnerin gewesen, die er strategisch umfassen, die er einschließen und zur Kapitulation nötigen mußte; aber jetzt war die finanzmilitärische Operation zu Ende. Napoleon Kanitz hatte gesiegt, restlos gesiegt, und damit war dieses arme stille Mädchen, das im einfachen Kleid neben ihm durch die Walfischgasse schattete, nicht mehr sein Gegner, sein Feind. Und – so sonderbar es klingt, nichts bedrückte unseren Freund in diesem Augenblick seines raschen Sieges eigentlich mehr als das Faktum, daß sein Opfer ihm seinen Sieg zu leicht gemacht hatte. Denn wenn man gegen einen Menschen ein Unrecht begeht, tut es dem Täter geheimnisvollerweise wohl, herauszufinden oder sich vorzutäuschen, daß auch der Mißbrauchte in irgendeiner Kleinigkeit schlecht oder unrecht gehandelt habe; immer entlastet sich das Gewissen, wenn man dem Betrogenen wenigstens eine kleine Schuld zuteilen kann. Aber diesem Opfer hatte Kanitz nichts und nicht das Allergeringste vorzuwerfen; es hatte sich ihm mit gebundenen Händen übergeben und ihn dabei noch unablässig mit ahnungslos dankbaren kornblumenblauen Augen angeblickt. Was sollte er ihr jetzt nachträglich sagen? Sie noch beglückwünschen zum Verkauf, das heißt, zum Verlust? Immer unbehaglicher wurde ihm zumute. Zum Hotel begleite ich sie noch, überlegte er rasch; dann ist alles aus und vorbei.","But you must, dear Herr Leutnant, try to understand this unexpected change - I don't want to express myself pathetically and say that our friend's conscience has suddenly awakened. However, since that stroke of the pen, the external situation between the two partners had changed significantly. Think about it: during those two days Kanitz had fought as a buyer against this poor girl as against the seller. She had been the enemy he had to strategically embrace, encircle and compel to surrender; but now the financial-military operation was at an end. Napoleon Kanitz was victorious, completely victorious, and that poor, quiet girl, who in a simple dress was shading the Walfischgasse next to him, was no longer his opponent, his enemy. And, strange as it may sound, nothing depressed our friend more at that moment of his rapid victory than the fact that his sacrifice had made his victory too easy for him. For when one commits an injustice against a person, it mysteriously does the perpetrator good to find out or to pretend that the abused person has also acted badly or wrongly in some trifle; one's conscience is always relieved when one can assign at least a small amount of blame to the deceived. But Kanitz had nothing and not the slightest reproach against this victim; she had thrown herself up at him with her hands tied, still looking at him incessantly with cluelessly grateful cornflower-blue eyes. What should he tell her now afterwards? You still congratulate on the sale, that is, on the loss? He felt more and more uncomfortable. I'll accompany her to the hotel, he thought quickly; then it's all over.","“My dear Lieutenant Hofmiller, you must try to understand this unexpected change of mood. I won’t turn emotional and say that our friend’s conscience had suddenly pricked him. Since the signing of the agreement, however, the material situation of the two parties to it had changed considerably with that one stroke of his pen. You must remember that for the whole of those two days, Kanitz as buyer had been at odds with that poor girl as seller. She had been the enemy whom he must outwit strategically; she must be trapped and forced to capitulate. But now those financial-cum-military manoeuvres were over. Napoleon Kanitz had won hands down, and so the poor, quiet young woman walking with him down Walfischgasse side by side like two shadows, was no longer an opponent. And strange as it sounds, nothing troubled our friend more in that moment of his swift victory than the fact that his victim had made it too easy for him. If you are going to do another human being wrong, for some mysterious reason it does the perpetrator of the injustice good to find out, or to imagine, that his victim has acted badly or unfairly in some detail or other. It salves his conscience to impute at least some small part of the blame to the person who has been deceived. But Kanitz could not accuse his victim of anything, not the least little thing; she had delivered herself up to him with her hands bound, looking at him all the time with unsuspecting gratitude in her cornflower-blue eyes. What could he say to her, now that he had done the deed? Congratulate her on the sale, meaning on her loss? He was feeling more and more uncomfortable. I’ll see her to the hotel, he thought quickly, and that will be an end of it.","You must try, my dear Lieutenant, to understand this unexpected revolution in his feelings. I should not like to express it sentimentally and say that our friend Kanitz’s conscience had suddenly been awakened — but ever since that stroke of the pen the external situation between the two partners to the agreement had utterly changed. Just think: during the whole of these two days Kanitz, in the role of purchaser, had struggled against this poor woman, in the role of vendor. She had been the opponent whom he had had to encircle strategically, whom he had had to close in upon and force into capitulation. But now the financial-military operation had come to an end. Napoleon Kanitz had won a victory, a complete victory, and this poor, quiet, simply dressed woman, who was walking beside him along the Walfischgasse, was no longer his opponent, his enemy. And, strange as it may sound, nothing oppressed our friend more at this moment of speedy victory than the fact that his victim had made his victory too easy for him. For when one does another person an injustice, in some mysterious way it does one good to discover (or to persuade oneself) that the injured party has also behaved badly or unfairly in some little matter or other; it is always a relief to the conscience if one can apportion some measure of guilt to the person one has betrayed. But Kanitz could not accuse this victim of anything, even the slightest thing; she had yielded herself up with bound hands and had never ceased, moreover, to cast unsuspecting, grateful looks at him out of her cornflower-blue eyes. What was he to say to her now? Congratulate her on the sale of the estate, that is, its loss? He felt more and more uncomfortable. I shall see her to the hotel, he thought quickly, and then the whole thing will be over."
"»A la bonheur«, lacht Graf Steinhübel, »wenn’st Courasch hast, tust mir sogar einen G’fallen damit. Ich hab heute geradezu einen Krampf in die Finger gekriegt, so hab ich das Viech herumreißen müssen; wär schon gut, wenn jemand Frischer über den Racker käm.

Come on!”","“Best of luck!” laughs Count Steinhübel. “You’ll be doing me a favour if you feel up to it. I got cramp in my fingers today, I had to pull the brute round so hard.

Come on, quick march!”","‘Good luck to you!’ laughed Count Steinhübel. ‘If you’ve got the nerve, you’ll be doing me a favour. I’ve positively got cramp in my fingers today, I had to pull the beast in so hard. It would be a jolly good thing if someone fresh took a hand with the rogue. If you like, we’ll go along straight away. Come along, quick march!’"
"»Wie gut von Ihnen, Herr Leutnant! Ich kann mir denken, wie ihr das wohltut!« nickte sie mir zu; unwillkürlich rückte ihre Hand auf dem Tisch näher an mich heran.","'How good of you, Herr Leutnant! I can imagine how good that is for her!' she nodded to me; involuntarily her hand on the table moved closer to me.","“How kind of you, Lieutenant! I can imagine how much good that must do her.” And her hand as it lay on the table instinctively moved closer to me.","‘How good of you, Herr Leutnant! I can just imagine what a comfort that must be to her,’ she said, nodding at me, and impulsively reaching out her hand to me across the table."

You could see that something was tormenting her.","“And so am I,” he assured me, with a little smile. We understood one another entirely. But then I saw his wife’s mouth begin to work nervously. You could tell that she had something on her mind.","‘So am I,’ he agreed with a faint smile. We understood each other perfectly. But his wife’s mouth began to work. It was plain that she had something on her mind."
"Ich stehe schleunigst auf, um den Eintretenden zu begrüßen. Er nickt befangen und beugt sich gleich über Edith, um ihr die Stirn zu küssen. Dann entsteht ein merkwürdiges Schweigen. Alle spüren ja alles von allen in diesem Haus; zweifellos muß der alte Mann gefühlt haben, daß eben eine gefährliche Spannung zwischen uns beiden schwingt; so steht er mit gesenkten Augen beunruhigt herum. Am liebsten, ich merke es, flüchtete er gleich wieder zurück. Edith versucht zu helfen.","I get up as quickly as possible to greet the person entering. He nods self-consciously and immediately bends over Edith to kiss her forehead. Then there is a strange silence. Everyone feels everything from everyone in this house; no doubt the old man must have sensed that there was a dangerous tension between us; he stands there, eyes downcast, worried. I can see that he prefers to flee back straight away. Edith tries to help.","I stand up quickly to greet the new arrival. He nods to me self-consciously, and immediately bends down to kiss Edith’s forehead. Then a remarkable silence descends. Everyone in this house seems to know instinctively all there is to know about everyone else; the old man must certainly have felt a dangerous tension between his daughter and me, and now he stands there uneasily, eyes cast down. I can tell that he would like to make his escape again at once. Edith tries to help.","Naturally I got up to greet Kekesfalva. He gave me an embarrassed nod and bent down to kiss Edith on the brow. Then there was a strange silence. Everyone in that house seemed to sense everything about everyone else. The old man must immediately have been aware of the dangerous tension between the two of us, for he hovered about uneasily with downcast eyes. I could see he would have liked to run away. Edith made an effort to break the ice."

"Der kleine feiste Mann war, die Fäuste geballt wie ein Boxer, auf mich eingedrungen. Vielleicht hätte er sonst in seinem flauschigen Hausrock und seinen schlurfenden Pantoffeln lächerlich gewirkt.

Otherwise he might have looked ridiculous in his fluffy housecoat and shuffling slippers. But something overwhelming emanated from his honest anger as he yelled at me recently:","The small, sturdy man had come close to me, fists clenched like a boxer. Perhaps I ought to have thought him ridiculous in his soft dressing gown and down-at-heel slippers, but his honest fury was overpowering as he shouted at me again, “Murder!","Clenching his fists like a boxer, the portly little man advanced upon me.

Right, now off you go.","‘That’s all right then. You know, I was a bit afraid that in the heat of the moment you’d go and do something silly.

"In einer knappen Stunde war dort alles erledigt. In einer knappen Stunde hatte unser Freund der Erbin drei Viertel ihres Vermögens abgeknöpft. Als sein Komplize den Namen des Schlosses Kekesfalva eingesetzt sah und dazu den geringen Kaufpreis, kniff er, ohne daß die Dietzenhof etwas merkte, das eine Auge zu und blinzelte seinen alten Spießgesellen bewundernd an. Diese kollegiale Bewunderung besagte, in Worten ausgedrückt, etwa: ›Großartig, du Lump! Was ist dir da gelungen!‹ Auch der Notar blickte interessiert hinter seiner Brille auf Fräulein Dietzenhof; er hatte wie jeder andere in den Zeitungen vom Kampf um die Erbschaft der Fürstin Orosvár gelesen, und dem Mann des Rechts kam dieser hitzige Weiterverkauf nicht recht geheuer vor. Arme Person, dachte er, du bist da in üble Hände gefallen! Aber es ist nicht Pflicht eines Notars, bei einem Kaufvertrag Verkäufer oder Käufer zu warnen. Er hat die Stempel zu setzen, den Akt einzutragen und die Gebühren erlegen zu lassen. So senkte der brave Mann nur – er hatte mancherlei Dubioses schon mitansehen und mit kaiserlichem Adler besiegeln müssen – den Kopf, faltete den Kaufvertrag sauber auseinander und lud die Dietzenhof höflich als erste zur Unterzeichnung ein.","Everything was done there in less than an hour. In less than an hour, our friend had stolen three quarters of the heiress' fortune. When his accomplice saw the name of the castle Kekesfalva inserted and the low purchase price, he closed one eye without Dietzenhof noticing anything and blinked admiringly at his old accomplice. Expressed in words, this collegial admiration meant something like: 'Great, you rascal! What did you do there!‹ The notary also looked interestedly behind his glasses at Fraulein Dietzenhof; he, like everyone else, had read in the newspapers about the fight for Princess Orosvár's inheritance, and the man of law did not find this heated resale particularly eminent. Poor person, he thought, you've fallen into bad hands! But it is not the duty of a notary to warn the seller or buyer in a sales contract. He has to set the stamp, enter the file and have the fees levied. So the good man just bowed his head – he had already witnessed a number of dubious things and had to seal them with the imperial eagle – neatly unfolded the purchase contract and politely invited Dietzenhof to be the first to sign it.","“In just under an hour it was all over. In just under an hour our friend had cheated the heiress out of three-quarters of her fortune. When his accomplice Gollinger saw the name of Kekesfalva Castle and then the low sale price, he winked, unnoticed by Fräulein Dietzenhof, and gave his old companion in underhand dealings an admiring glance. Put it into words, and this friendly admiration said something like, ‘Good work, old fellow! Quick off the mark, eh?’ The notary too looked through his glasses at Fräulein Dietzenhof with interest; like everyone else, he had read about the Princess’s disputed estate in the papers, and as a lawyer he thought there was something not at all right about the haste with which Kekesfalva was being sold on. Poor woman, he thought, you’ve fallen into the wrong hands. But it is not a notary’s business to warn either buyer or seller about a sale. He has to stamp the deed, get it registered, and see that the fees are paid. So the good man, who had seen many dubious deals done before and sealed them with the imperial eagle of Austria, just bowed his head, folded up the document, and civilly asked Fräulein Dietzenhof to be the first to sign.","Within the space of an hour the whole thing was settled. Within the space of an hour our friend had swindled the heiress out of three-quarters of her fortune. When his accomplice saw the name of Schloss Kekesfalva filled in on the agreement, saw, moreover, what a paltry sum was being paid for it, he screwed up one eye behind Fräulein Dietzenhof’s back and winked admiringly at his old crony, as much as to say, ‘Splendid, you dog! You have pulled off something this time!’ The notary also gazed with interest from behind his glasses at Fräulein Dietzenhof; he had, of course, read in the newspapers of the struggle over Princess Orosvár’s inheritance, and he was somewhat suspicious of this hasty resale of the estate. Poor creature, he thought, you’ve fallen into evil hands! But it is not the duty of a notary to warn either seller or purchaser when witnessing the signatures to a deed of sale. It is his job to stamp the deed, to fill it up, and to see that the fees are duly paid. And so the good man merely bowed his head — he had had to witness many a shady transaction and set the seal of the imperial eagle upon it — neatly unfolded the agreement and politely invited Fräulein Dietzenhof to sign first."
"Der Zwischenfall ist glücklich beigelegt. Aber in mir fiebert der Zorn weiter. Was treiben die da draußen mit mir? Hin und her, herauf und herunter, kalt und warm – nein, ich lasse mich nicht so hetzen! Drei Tage habe ich gesagt, dreieinhalb Tage und keine Stunde mehr! Und ob sie verschieben oder nicht verschieben, ist mir egal! Ich laß mir nicht länger die Nerven zerreißen, mich nicht länger quälen durch das verfluchte Mitleid. Ich werde noch verrückt davon.","The incident is happily settled. But the anger continues to rage inside me. What are they doing with me out there? Back and forth, up and down, cold and warm - no, I won't let myself be rushed! I said three days, three and a half days and not an hour more! And whether they move or not move, I don't care! I will no longer let my nerves tear, I will no longer be tormented by the cursed pity. I'm going crazy from this.","The little incident has been smoothed over. But my anger is still feverishly working away inside me. What are they up to there at the castle? Back and forth, chopping and changing, blowing hot and cold—I’m not going to be plagued like that! I said three days, three and a half days to go and not an hour more! So who cares if they’ve put off the trip to Switzerland or not? I’m not having my nerves torn to shreds any longer , I’m not letting my damned pity torment me. This will drive me out of my mind!","The incident was happily closed. But I continued to fume inwardly. What were the Kekesfalvas up to? This way, that way, hot and cold — no, I wasn’t going to let them play me up like this! Three days, I had said, three and a half days, and not a moment longer. It was all the same to me if they postponed their journey or not. I wasn’t going to let my nerves be torn to pieces any longer. I wasn’t going to be tortured any longer by this cursed pity. It was driving me mad."
"An diesem ersten Empfang erkannte die arme schwachmütige Erbin, nie würde sie in diesem Hause eine ruhige Stunde haben. Nur darum – und das ahnte Kanitz nicht – nahm sie seinen Vorschlag begeistert an, noch am selben Tag nach Wien zu fahren, wo er angeblich einen sicheren Käufer wußte; wie ein Himmelsbote erschien ihr dieser ernste, gefällige, vielwissende Mann mit den melancholischen Augen. So fragte sie nicht weiter. Sie überließ ihm dankbar alle Papiere, mit stillauschenden blauen Blicken hörte sie zu, wie er sie wegen der Anlage der Kaufsumme beriet. Nur etwas Sicheres solle sie nehmen, Staatspapiere, mündelsichere. Keinem Privaten solle sie auch nur eine Krume ihres Vermögens anvertrauen, alles müsse in die Bank, und ein Notar, ein kaiserlich-königlicher Notar, die Verwaltung übernehmen. Auf keinen Fall hätte es Sinn, jetzt noch ihren Anwalt heranzuziehen, was sei denn das Advokatengeschäft anderes, als klare Dinge krumm zu kriegen? Gewiß, gewiß, flocht er immer wieder beflissen ein, es sei ja möglich, daß sie in drei Jahren, in fünf Jahren eine höhere Kaufsumme erzielen könne. Aber welche Kosten inzwischen und welche Scherereien bei Gericht und den Ämtern; und da er an ihren neuerdings aufschreckenden Augen erkannte, welchen Ekel diese friedliche Person vor Gerichten und Geschäften hatte, spielte er die ganze Tonleiter der Argumente immer wieder bis zum selben Schlußakkord: rasch! rasch! Um vier Uhr nachmittags, ehe Petrovic zurückkam, fuhren sie bereits einverständlich mit dem Schnellzug nach Wien. So orkanhaft geschwind war alles gekommen, daß Fräulein Dietzenhof gar nicht Gelegenheit hatte, den fremden Herrn, dem sie ihr ganzes Erbe zum Verkauf übertrug, nach seinem Namen zu fragen.","From this first reception the poor weak-hearted heiress realized that she would never have a quiet hour in this house. That was the only reason why – and Kanitz had no idea – she enthusiastically accepted his suggestion to go to Vienna that same day, where he allegedly knew a sure buyer; this serious, agreeable, knowledgeable man with the melancholic eyes appeared to her like a messenger from heaven. So she didn't ask any more. She gratefully let him have all the papers, and with silent blue eyes she listened as he advised her on the investment of the purchase price. She should only take something safe, government paper, trustworthy. She should not entrust even a crumb of her wealth to anyone private, everything must go to the bank and a notary, an imperial-royal notary, take over the administration. In no case would it make sense to call in her lawyer now, what else would the legal business do than get things crooked? Of course, of course, he kept insisting, it was possible that in three or five years she could achieve a higher purchase price. But what costs in the meantime and what troubles in court and the authorities; and seeing from her newly startled eyes what disgust this peaceful person felt at courts and business, he played the whole scale of arguments over and over to the same final chord: quick! quick! At four o'clock in the afternoon, before Petrovic returned, they had already agreed to take the express train to Vienna. Everything happened so quickly that Fraulein Dietzenhof didn't even have the opportunity to ask the name of the strange gentleman to whom she was selling her entire inheritance.","“The unfortunate weak-willed heiress could tell from this reception that she would never have a moment’s peace here. That was her sole reason, although Kanitz did not know it, for agreeing with alacrity when he suggested setting out that very day for Vienna, where he said he knew someone who was sure to buy the property. This grave, helpful and knowledgeable man with his melancholy eyes seemed to her like a messenger sent from heaven, and she asked no more questions. She gratefully gave him all the documents, listening with her calm blue gaze as he advised her on the investment of the proceeds of the sale. She must put it only into something absolutely safe, he said, such as gilt-edged bonds, government securities. And she must not entrust the slightest part of her fortune to any private person, it must all go into the bank, and a qualified notary should be appointed to manage it. There was no point whatsoever in dragging her lawyer into it now— what was legal business all about, if not making something straightforward look complicated? Of course, he kept earnestly interjecting, of course it was possible that she might get a higher price in three years’ time, or five years’ time. But think of all the expense incurred in the interim, and the law courts and the civil servants! And seeing once again, from the fear that came back into her eyes, how terrified this peace-loving woman was of courts of law and official business, he repeated the burden of his song over and over again, always winding it up with the final chord that said—quickly, get it done quickly! At four in the afternoon, when Petrovic came back, they were already in perfect agreement and on the express train to Vienna. All this had happened at such lightning speed that Fräulein Dietzenhof hadn’t even had an opportunity to ask the name of the strange gentleman to whom she was entrusting the sale of her entire inheritance.","The poor, weak-spirited woman realized from this reception that she would never have a moment’s peace in this house. It was for that reason alone — and of this Kanitz was quite unaware — that she readily agreed to his proposal that she should accompany him that very day to Vienna, where, he said, he knew a man who would be sure to buy the estate. He seemed to her to be a messenger from heaven, this grave, courteous, well-informed man with the melancholy eyes. And so she asked no further questions, but gratefully handed over to him all the documents in the case, and listened with quietly intent blue eyes as he advised her with regard to the investment of the money she would get from the sale. She must only invest in something absolutely safe, in Government bonds. She must not entrust even a crumb of her fortune to a private individual; she must put everything in the bank, and a notary public must take over the administration of it. There was no point whatever in calling in her lawyer at this stage, for what was the business of a lawyer but to make simple things complicated? Yes, yes, he kept on interposing indefatigably, it was possible that she might obtain a higher price in three or four years’ time. But think what expenses there would be in the meantime and what a lot of bother with the court and officials! And realizing from the look of alarm that once more came into her eyes what a horror this pacific creature had of courts and business matters , he went through the whole gamut of his arguments again and again, always ending on the same note: quickly, quickly! At four o’clock that afternoon, complete agreement established, they caught the Vienna express before Petrovic returned. The whole thing had been so tempestuous that Fräulein Dietzenhof had not even had an opportunity of asking this strange gentleman, whom she was entrusting with the sale of her entire inheritance, his name."
"Der Oberst zwirbelte und zerrte so heftig an seinem dicken Schnurrbart, als wollte er ihn ausreißen. Man sah, daß hinter seiner niederen Stirn etwas arbeitete.

Finally he stopped in front of me again.","The Colonel tugged at his heavy moustache and twisted its ends as hard as if he were trying to tear it out.

Finally he stopped again in front of me.","The Colonel twirled and tugged violently at his moustache, as though trying to tear it out by the roots.

The floor shook slightly beneath his heavy tread, and his spurs jingled faintly. At length he came to a halt in front of me."
"Ich begriff die Frage nicht ganz. Ich hatte nur das Gefühl, etwas Törichtes gesagt zu haben. So äußerte ich verlegen:",I didn't quite understand the question. I just felt like I said something foolish. So I said embarrassed:,"I didn’t entirely understand the question.

"Und nun hören Sie: damals kannte die sogenannte Wissenschaft nicht die geringste Kur gegen Diabetes. Man quälte die Kranken mit einer besonderen Diät, jedes Gramm wurde gewogen, jeder Schluck gemessen, aber die Ärzte wußten – und ich als Mediziner wußte es natürlich auch –, daß man damit das Ende nur hinausschob, daß diese zwei, drei Jahre ein entsetzliches Zugrundegehen, ein elendes Verhungern inmitten einer Welt bedeuteten, die von Speisen und Getränken strotzt. Sie können sich denken, wie ich als Student, als zukünftiger Arzt, damals von einer Autorität zur andern lief, wie ich alle Bücher und Spezialwerke studierte. Aber überall antwortete mir mündlich und schriftlich das mir seitdem unerträgliche Wort ›unheilbar, unheilbar‹. Seit jenem Tage hasse ich dieses Wort, denn ich habe wach und untätig mitansehen müssen, wie der Mensch, den ich auf Erden am meisten liebte, elender zugrunde ging als irgend ein dumpfes Tier; er starb drei Monate vor meiner Promotion.","And now listen: at that time the so-called science did not know the slightest cure for diabetes. The sick were tortured with a special diet, every gram was weighed, every sip measured, but the doctors knew - and as a doctor I knew it too, of course - that this was only delaying the end, that these two or three years would be a horrible end , a miserable starvation in the midst of a world teeming with food and drink. You can imagine how, as a student, as a future doctor, I ran from one authority to another, studying all the books and special works. But everywhere I was answered, verbally and in writing, with the word 'incurable, incurable', which has since become intolerable to me. Ever since that day I have hated that word, for awake and idly I have seen the man I loved most on earth perish more miserably than any dull beast; he died three months before my PhD.","“Now, listen—at the time medical science had no cure at all for diabetes. Patients were put on a strict diet, every gram was weighed, every sip of liquid measured, but the doctors knew—and of course as a medical student I knew too—that they were only postponing the inevitable end, that those two or three years meant terrible decline, starvation in the middle of a world full of food and drink. You can imagine how I, as a student and a future doctor, went from one authority to another at the time, how I studied the textbooks and specialist works. But wherever I went the reply, spoken or written, was that the disease was incurable—a word that I will not tolerate today. And I have hated that word ever since, because I had to stand by and watch the man I loved more than any other on earth die miserably, like a dumb animal, and there was nothing I could do about it. He died, in fact, three months before I qualified.","And now listen to this. In those days no cure whatever for diabetes was known to so-called medical science. The patient was subjected to all the tortures of a strict diet, every ounce of food was weighed, every mouthful measured, but the doctors knew — and I, as a medical student, of course also knew — that it was merely a matter of postponing the inevitable end, that for two, possibly three, years my father would starve slowly and miserably to death in a world teeming with food and drink. You can imagine how I, as a medical student, rushed from specialist to specialist, pored over all the books and monographs on the subject. But the only answer I could extract from either books or people was the one word that has ever since been unendurable to me: “incurable”, “incurable”. Ever since that time I have loathed the word, for I had to stand by, in full realization of my utter powerlessness to help, and watch the person I loved best on earth meet a more pitiable end than an insentient beast. He died three months before I qualified."
"»Nein, schämen Sie sich nicht! Wenn einer, so versteh ich, daß man Furcht haben kann vor den Menschen, sobald etwas ihren reglementierten Vorstellungen widerspricht. Sie haben doch meine Frau gesehen. Niemand verstand, warum ich sie heiratete, und alles, was nicht auf ihrer engen und sozusagen normalen Linie liegt, macht die Menschen erst neugierig und dann böswillig. Gleich flüsterten meine Herren Kollegen herum, ich hätte sie in meiner Behandlung verpatzt und nur aus Furcht geheiratet – meine Freunde wieder, die sogenannten, verbreiteten, sie habe viel Geld oder erwarte eine Erbschaft. Meine Mutter, meine eigene Mutter, weigerte sich zwei Jahre lang, sie zu empfangen, denn sie hatte schon eine andere Partie für mich im Hinterhalt, die Tochter eines Professors – damals der berühmteste Internist der Universität – und wenn ich sie geheiratet hätte, wäre ich drei Wochen später Dozent gewesen, Professor geworden und mein Leben lang warm in der Wolle gesessen. Aber ich wußte, daß diese Frau zugrunde gehen würde, wenn ich sie im Stiche ließe. Sie glaubte nur an mich, und hätte ich ihr diesen Glauben genommen, so wäre sie unfähig gewesen, weiterzuleben. Nun, ich gestehe Ihnen offen, ich habe meine Wahl nicht bereut. Denn glauben Sie mir, als Arzt und gerade als Arzt hat man selten ein ganz reines Gewissen. Man weiß, wie wenig man wirklich helfen kann, man kommt als einzelner nicht auf gegen die Unermeßlichkeit des täglichen Jammers. Man schöpft nur mit einem Fingerhut ein paar Tropfen weg aus diesem unergründlichen Meer, und die man heute geheilt glaubt, haben morgen schon wieder ein neues Gebrest. Immer hat man das Gefühl, zu lässig, zu nachlässig gewesen zu sein, dazu kommen die Irrtümer, die Kunstfehler, die man unvermeidlich begeht – da bleibt es immerhin ein gutes Bewußtsein, wenigstens einen Menschen gerettet zu haben, ein Vertrauen nicht enttäuscht, eine Sache richtig getan zu haben. Schließlich muß man wissen, ob man nur dumpf und dumm hingelebt hat oder für etwas gelebt. Glauben Sie mir« – und ich spürte mit einmal seine Nähe ganz warm und beinahe zärtlich – »es lohnt sich schon, etwas Schweres auf sich zu nehmen, wenn man es einem anderen Menschen damit leichter macht.«","""No, don't be ashamed! If anyone, then I understand that one can be afraid of people as soon as something contradicts their regimented ideas. You've seen my wife. No one understood why I married her, and anything that doesn't fall within her narrow and, so to speak, normal line makes people first curious and then malicious. Immediately my gentlemen colleagues whispered around that I had messed up my treatment and only married out of fear - my friends again, the so-called, spread the word that she had a lot of money or was expecting an inheritance. My mother, my own mother, refused to conceive her for two years because she already had another match in ambush for me, the daughter of a professor - at the time the most famous internist in the university - and if I had married her, I would be three weeks later I was a lecturer, became a professor and sat warm in my wool my whole life. But I knew that this woman would perish if I failed her. She only believed in me, and if I had taken away that belief from her, she would have been unable to go on living. Well, I'll tell you frankly, I have no regrets about my choice. Because believe me, as a doctor, and especially as a doctor, you rarely have a completely clear conscience. One knows how little one can really help, one cannot stand alone against the immensity of the daily misery. You just scoop a few drops out of this unfathomable sea with a thimble, and those who you think healed today will have a new ailment tomorrow. One always has the feeling of having been too careless, too negligent, and then there are the mistakes, the malpractice that one inevitably makes - there is still a good consciousness of having saved at least one person, a trust that has not been disappointed, one thing to have done right. After all, you have to know whether you just lived dumbly and stupidly or whether you lived for something. Believe me"" - and I suddenly felt his closeness very warm and almost tender - ""it is worth taking on something difficult if it makes it easier for someone else.""","“You mustn’t feel ashamed. If anyone understands how you can be afraid of people as soon as something is out of tune with their well-regulated ideas, then I do. You have seen my wife. No one could understand why I married her, and everything that is not on the straight and narrow line of what we call normality makes them first curious, then malicious. My medical colleagues whispered that I had botched her treatment, and married her only out of fear of the consequences—my friends, or so-called friends, spread the rumour that she was rich, or was expecting a large legacy. My mother, my own mother refused to meet her for two years. She had had another match in mind for me, the daughter of a professor—he was the most famous specialist in internal medicine at the university—and if I had married the girl I would have been a lecturer three weeks later, then a professor myself, and I’d have lived in clover all my life. But I knew that it would destroy the woman I did marry if I let her down. All she believed in was me, and if I had taken that belief from her she would have been unable to go on living. And I will tell you frankly, I have never regretted my choice. For believe me, doctors of all people seldom have a perfectly clear conscience. We know how little we can really do to help, we know that as individuals we can do nothing to mitigate the immeasurable extent of daily suffering. We scoop out only a thimbleful, a few drops from that unfathomable ocean, and those we think cured one day show the symptoms of another malady the next. We always have a sense of having been too remiss, too negligent, and then there are the real mistakes we make, the wrong conclusions we inevitably reach—and it is always good to know that you have helped at least one human being , there is one person whose trust you have not disappointed, you have done one thing well. After all, we need to know whether we have just made our way through life in dull stupidity or whether we have lived for some purpose.

It immediately got about among my colleagues that I had bungled my treatment of her and had only married her out of panic.

But I knew that my wife would go under completely if I left her in the lurch. She believed in me, me alone, and had I taken her faith from her , she would have been incapable of going on living. I may as well confess to you that I have never regretted my choice, for , believe me, a doctor, of all people, seldom has a clear conscience. One knows how little one can really do to help; as an individual one can’t cope with the infinite wretchedness that exists all around us in the world.

"Zunächst verschließt allerdings eine cremefarbene, mit goldenen Ornamenten zierlich geschmückte Schiebetür den Ausblick auf den mir deutlich gegenwärtigen Schauplatz meiner Tölpelei, aber bereits nach wenigen Minuten vernehme ich hinter dieser Tür schon Rücken von Sesseln, tuschelndes Sprechen, irgend ein verhaltenes Kommen und Gehen, das mir die Gegenwart mehrerer Personen verrät. Ich versuche die Wartezeit zu nützen, um den Salon zu betrachten: üppige Möbel Louis seize, rechts und links alte Gobelins und zwischen den Glastüren, die unmittelbar in den Garten führen, alte Bilder vom Canale Grande und der Piazza San Marco, die mir, so unbelehrt ich auch in diesen Dingen bin, kostbar zu sein scheinen. Zwar, sehr deutlich unterscheide ich nichts von diesen Kunstschätzen, denn ich horche mit gespannter Aufmerksamkeit zugleich auf die Geräusche von nebenan. Es klirrt dort leise von Tellern, es knarrt eine Tür, jetzt meine ich auch – das unregelmäßige trockene Tappen und Tocken von Krücken zu hören.","At first, however, a cream-colored sliding door, delicately decorated with golden ornaments, blocks the view of the scene of my clumsiness, which I can clearly see, but after a few minutes I already hear the backs of armchairs behind this door, whispering conversations, some cautious coming and going that I reveals the presence of several people. I try to use the waiting time to look at the salon: opulent Louis XVI furniture, old tapestries to the left and right, and between the glass doors that lead directly into the garden, old pictures of the Grand Canal and the Piazza San Marco that, like that I am ignorant also in these things that seem precious. Admittedly, I don't distinguish anything very clearly from these art treasures, because at the same time I listen with rapt attention to the noises from next door. There's a soft clinking of plates, a door creaking, now I think I can hear the erratic, dry tapping and thumping of crutches.","At first, however, cream-coloured double doors delicately adorned with gilt decoration hide the view of the scene of my folly, which is still clearly present to me, but after a few minutes I hear chairs being moved behind that door, whispering voices, some kind of restrained coming and going that indicates the presence of several people. I try to employ the wait in studying the salon: opulent Louis XVI furniture, old tapestries to right and left, and between the glass doors leading straight out into the garden old pictures of the Canal Grande and the Piazza San Marco.

To be sure, I can distinguish nothing of these artistic treasures very clearly, for I am listening intently at the same time to the noises in the room next door. There is a quiet clink of plates in there, a door creaks, now I also think I hear the irregular, dry tapping of crutches on the floor.","At first, it is true, cream-coloured folding-doors, with delicate gold ornamentation, hid from sight the scene, so vivid in my memory, of my gaffe, but after a few moments I could hear, on the other side of the door, chairs being drawn up, hushed whispers, and a discreet coming and going which betrayed the presence of several people. I tried to employ the time of waiting in surveying the salon: rich furniture, Louis Seize, to the right and left old Gobelin tapestries and, between the French windows that gave directly on to the garden, old pictures of the Grand Canal and the Piazza San Marco, which seemed to me, novice though I was in these matters, to be extremely valuable. It is true that I did not form a very clear picture of any single one of these art treasures, for I was listening with eager attentiveness to the noises in the next room.

"Also – vorgestern früh erhalte ich ein Telegramm. ›Bitte Sie, verehrter Freund, baldigst zu kommen. Erwarten Sie alle ungeduldigst. Vertrauensvoll dankbar Ihr Kekesfalva.‹ Schon diese gehäuften Superlative ›baldigst‹ und ›ungeduldigst‹ entzückten mich nicht. Warum plötzlich so ungeduldig? Ich habe Edith doch erst vor ein paar Tagen untersucht. Und dann: wozu telegraphische Versicherung seines Vertrauens, wofür die besondere Dankbarkeit? Nun, ich nahm die Sache keineswegs hitzig und legte das Telegramm ad acta; schließlich leistet der Alte sich öfters solche Raptusse. Aber das gestern früh gab mir doch einen Ruck. Da kommt ein endlos langer Brief von Edith, ein total verrückter und ekstatischer Expreßbrief, sie hätte von Anfang an gewußt, ich sei der einzige Mensch auf Erden, der sie retten werde, und sie vermöge mir gar nicht zu sagen, wie glücklich sie sich fühle, daß wir endlich so weit seien. Sie schreibe nur, um mir zu versichern, ich könne mich unbedingt auf sie verlassen. Alles, was ich anordnen würde, auch das Allerschwerste, werde sie zuversichtlich auf sich nehmen.

Even these superlatives 'soonest' and 'most impatient' didn't delight me. Why suddenly so impatient? I just examined Edith a few days ago. And then: why telegraphic assurances of his trust, why the special gratitude? Well, I didn't take the matter too hotly and put the telegram aside; after all, the old man often affords such raptusse. But yesterday morning gave me a jolt. There's an endless letter from Edith, a totally crazy and ecstatic express letter, saying she knew from the start that I was the only person on earth who would save her and she can't even tell me how happy she feels that we are finally ready. She is only writing to assure me that I can absolutely rely on her. Anything I would order, even the most difficult, she would confidently take upon herself. But only soon, only immediately should I start the new cure, she's just burning with impatience. And again: I could expect her to do anything, but I should start quickly. And so on and so on.","“Very well—first thing the day before yesterday I received a telegram. ‘Please, dear friend, come as quickly as possible. Expecting you with all imaginable impatience. Most grateful, have every confidence in you. Yours, Kekesfalva.’ I didn’t like the sound of those superlatives. Why so impatient all of a sudden? I examined Edith only a couple of days ago. And why that telegraphic assurance of his confidence and his special gratitude? Well, I assumed there wasn’t really any great urgency, I put the telegram with other correspondence. After all, the old man indulges in such exaggerations quite often. But what came yesterday morning put a different complexion on it—I had an endlessly long letter from Edith, a crazy, ecstatic letter, sent express, saying she had always known that I was the only person on earth who could save her , she couldn’t tell me how happy she was to think we had reached this stage at last. She was writing, she said, only to assure me that I could rely absolutely on her, she would certainly undertake to do everything I told her, however hard it was. But she wanted to begin the new course of treatment soon, at once, she was burning with impatience. And she repeated that I could expect anything of her, just so long as I began soon. And so on and so forth.","‘Well then — yesterday morning I received a telegram. “Please dear friend come earliest opportunity stop all await you with greatest impatience stop fullest confidence and deepest gratitude Kekesfalva.” Those piled-up superlatives, “earliest opportunity” and “greatest impatience”, were in themselves not to my liking. Why suddenly so impatient? I had examined Edith only a few days before. And then, why assure me of his confidence by telegram, why the special gratitude? All the same, I didn’t take the matter in the least seriously, and filed the telegram away. After all, I thought, the old fellow often indulges in such whims. But it was what happened this morning that gave me a shock. I received an interminably long express letter from Edith, an utterly mad and ecstatic letter, saying that she had known from the start that I was the only person on earth who could save her and she just couldn’t tell me how happy it made her to know that we had at last reached the present stage. She was only writing to assure me I could count absolutely upon her. She would without fail carry out any treatment I prescribed, however difficult. But I must start her on the new treatment soon, at once, she was burning with impatience. And once again, I could expect anything of her, only I must get started quickly. And so on and so on."

Die ganze Zeit wünschte ich mir innerlich, es möchte doch jemand aufwachen und kommen und das Fenster schließen, und plötzlich hör ich einen Schritt näher und näher. Ich bin zuerst erschrocken, es war doch zwei Uhr oder drei Uhr nachts, und hab Papa im ersten Staunen gar nicht erkannt, so anders hat er ausgesehen. Und gleich ist er zu mir her und war nicht zu halten … Sie hätten ihn sehen sollen, gelacht hat er und geschluchzt … ja, denken Sie sich doch, Papa einmal lachen, laut und übermütig lachen zu hören, und von einem Fuß auf den andern tanzen wie einen großen Buben!

The whole time I was wishing inside that someone would wake up and come and close the window, and suddenly I hear a step coming closer and closer.

I was so cold, there was a draught from the window, and I didn’t have the strength to get over there and close it. I kept wishing someone would wake up and think of closing my window, and suddenly I heard footsteps coming closer and closer.

Of course, when he began talking, I was so amazed , I just couldn’t believe it … I thought—either Papa has been dreaming, or I’m dreaming myself.

What is it you find so horrifying about the fact that this poor child has fallen head over heels in love with you?’"
"Unwillkürlich bleibe ich stehen und nutze dies zögernde Warten, um die Schlafende wie ein Bild zu betrachten. Denn eigentlich habe ich bei unserem oftmaligen Beisammensein noch nie wirklich Gelegenheit gehabt, sie geradewegs anzuschauen, denn wie alle Empfindlichen und Überempfindlichen leistet sie einen unbewußten Widerstand, sich betrachten zu lassen. Auch wenn man sie nur zufällig im Gespräch anblickt, spannt sich sofort die kleine ärgerliche Falte zwischen den Brauen, die Augen werden fahrig, die Lippen nervös, nicht einen Augenblick gibt sich unbewegt ihr Profil. Nun erst, da sie mit geschlossenen Augen liegt, widerstandlos und reglos, kann ich (und ich habe das Gefühl eines Ungehörigen, eines Diebstahls dabei) das ein wenig eckige und gleichsam noch unfertige Antlitz betrachten, in dem sich Kindliches mit Fraulichem und Kränklichem auf die anziehendste Weise mischt. Die Lippen, leicht wie die eines Dürstenden aufgetan, atmen sacht, aber schon diese winzige Anstrengung hügelt und hebt ihre kindlich karge Brust, und wie erschöpft davon, wie ausgeblutet lehnt das blasse Gesicht, eingebettet in das rötliche Haar, in den Kissen. Ich trete vorsichtig näher. Die Schatten unter den Augen, die blauen Adern an den Schläfen, der rosige Durchschein der Nasenflügel verraten, mit wie dünner und farbloser Hülle die alabasterblasse Haut dem äußeren Andrang wehrt. Wie empfindlich muß man sein, denke ich mir, wenn so nah, so unbeschirmt die Nerven unter der Oberfläche pochen, wie unermeßlich leiden mit solch einem flaumleichten elfischen Leibe, der wie zum leichten Lauf geschaffen scheint, zu Tanz und Schweben, und dabei grausam der harten schweren Erde verkettet bleibt! Armes gefesseltes Geschöpf – abermals fühle ich das heiße Quellen von innen, jenen schmerzhaft erschöpfenden und gleichzeitig wild erregenden Aufschwall des Mitleids, der mich jedesmal übermannt, wenn ich an ihr Unglück denke; mir zittert die Hand vor Verlangen, ihr zart über den Arm zu streichen, mich hinzubeugen über sie und das Lächeln gleichsam wegzupflücken von ihren Lippen, falls sie aufwacht und mich erkennt. Ein Bedürfnis nach Zärtlichkeit, das sich bei mir dem Mitleid jedesmal beimengt, wenn ich an sie denke oder sie betrachte, drängt mich näher heran. Aber nicht diesen Schlaf stören, der sie weghält von sich selbst, von ihrer körperlichen Wirklichkeit! Gerade dies ist ja so wunderbar, Kranken während ihres Schlafes innig nahe zu sein, wenn alle Angstgedanken in ihnen gefangen sind, wenn sie so restlos ihr Gebrest vergessen, daß sich manchmal auf ihre halboffenen Lippen ein Lächeln niederläßt wie ein Schmetterling auf ein schwankes Blatt, ein fremdes, gar nicht ihnen selbst gehöriges Lächeln, das auch sofort wegschrickt beim ersten Erwachen. Welches Glück von Gott, denke ich mir, daß die Verkrüppelten, die Verstümmelten, die vom Schicksal Beraubten wenigstens im Schlaf nicht um Form oder Unform ihres Leibes wissen, daß der milde Betrüger Traum wenigstens dort ihnen ihre Gestalt in Schönheit und Ebenmaß vortäuscht, daß der Leidende zumindest in dieser einen, dunkel umrandeten Welt des Schlummers dem Fluch zu entfliehen vermag, in den er leiblich verkettet ist. Das Ergreifendste aber für mich sind die Hände, die über der Decke verkreuzt liegen, matt durchäderte, langgestreckte Hände mit zerbrechlich schmalen Gelenken und spitz zugeformten, etwas bläulichen Nägeln – zarte, ausgeblutete, machtlose Hände, gerade vielleicht noch stark genug, kleine Tiere zu streicheln, Tauben und Kaninchen, aber zu schwach, etwas festzuhalten, etwas zu fassen. Wie kann man, denke ich mir erschüttert, mit solch ohnmächtigen Händen sich gegen wirkliches Leiden wehren? Wie irgend etwas erkämpfen und fassen und halten? Und es widert mich fast, wenn ich an meine eigenen Hände denke, diese festen, schweren, muskulösen, starken Hände, die mit einem Zügelriß das unbotmäßigste Pferd bändigen können. Gegen meinen Willen muß mein Blick nun auch auf die Decke hinabstarren, die zottig und schwer, viel zu schwer für dies vogelleichte Wesen, auf ihren spitzen Knien lastet. Unter dieser undurchsichtigen Hülle liegen tot – ich weiß nicht, ob zerschmettert, gelähmt oder bloß geschwächt, ich habe nie den Mut gehabt, zu fragen – die ohnmächtigen Beine in jene stählerne oder lederne Maschinerie gespannt. Bei jeder Bewegung, erinnere ich mich, hängt sich schwer wie Kettenkugeln diese grausame Apparatur an die versagenden Gelenke, unablässig hat sie dies Widrige klirrend und knirschend mit sich zu schleppen, sie, die Zarte, die Schwächliche, gerade sie, von der man fühlt, daß ihr Schweben und Laufen und Sichaufschwingen natürlicher wäre als Gehen!","Involuntarily I stop and use this hesitant waiting to look at the sleeping woman like a picture. Actually, in our frequent get-togethers, I've never really had the opportunity to look at her directly, because, like all sensitive and over-sensitive people, she puts up an unconscious resistance to being looked at. Even if you just casually glance at her in conversation, the annoying little crease between her brows immediately tightens, her eyes become restless, her lips nervous, her profile is not motionless for a moment. Only now that she is lying with her eyes closed, unresisting and motionless, can I (and I have the feeling of something improper, of theft) look at the somewhat angular and as it were still unfinished face, in which the childlike meets the womanly and the sickly on the most attractive way mixes. Her lips, slightly parted like those of a thirsty man, breathe gently, but even this tiny exertion heaves and lifts her childishly barren breast, and as if exhausted from it, as if bled dry, her pale face, embedded in the reddish hair, leans on the pillow. I approach carefully. The shadows under the eyes, the blue veins on the temples, the rosy shine through the nostrils betray the thin and colorless covering of the alabaster-pale skin with which it resists the onslaught from outside. How sensitive one must be, I think to myself, when the nerves are beating so close, so unprotected, beneath the surface, how immeasurably suffering with such a fluffy elven body, which seems to have been made to run easily, to dance and float, and at the same time cruelly hard heavy earth remains chained! Poor bound creature—again I feel the hot welling from within, that painfully exhausting and at the same time wildly arousing surge of pity that overwhelms me every time I think of her misfortune; my hand trembles with the desire to stroke her arm tenderly, to bend over her and pluck the smile from her lips, as it were, in case she wakes up and recognizes me. A need for tenderness, which for me mixes with pity every time I think of her or look at her, draws me closer. But don't disturb this sleep that keeps you away from yourself, from your physical reality! It is just so wonderful to be close to the sick during their sleep, when all the thoughts of fear are trapped in them, when they forget their illness so completely that sometimes a smile settles on their half-open lips like a butterfly on a swaying leaf, a strange smile that doesn't belong to them at all, which also scares you away the first time you wake up. What luck from God, I think to myself, that the crippled, the mutilated, those bereft of fate, at least in their sleep, do not know the shape or form of their bodies, that the mild deceiver Dream, at least there, simulates their form in beauty and proportion, that the At least in this one, dark-rimmed world of slumber, the sufferer is able to escape the curse in which he is bodily chained. But the most touching thing for me are the hands that lie crossed over the blanket, long, faintly veined hands with fragile, narrow joints and pointed, slightly bluish nails – delicate, drained, powerless hands, perhaps just strong enough to stroke small animals , pigeons and rabbits, but too weak to hold on to anything, to grasp anything. How, I think to myself, can one defend oneself against real suffering with such helpless hands? How to fight and grasp and hold anything? And it almost disgusts me to think of my own hands, those firm, heavy, muscular, strong hands that can tame the most unruly horse with a tug of the reins. Against my will, my eyes now have to stare down at the blanket, too heavy and shaggy, far too heavy for this light-as-a-bird creature, to weigh on her pointed knees. Beneath that opaque shell lie dead--I don't know if shattered, paralyzed, or merely weakened, I've never had the courage to ask-- their impotent legs strung in that steel or leather machinery. With every movement, I remember, this cruel apparatus hangs as heavy as chain balls on the failing joints, it has to drag this repulsive thing with it constantly, clinking and creaking, it, the delicate, the weak one, precisely it, about whom one feels, that their hovering and running and soaring up were more natural than walking!","Instinctively I stop and make use of this hesitant, waiting moment to examine the sleeping girl as if she were a picture. At our frequent meetings I have never really had a chance to look at her properly, because like all who are sensitive, or indeed over-sensitive, she unconsciously resists such a gaze. Even if you happen to look her in the face during a conversation, that little line of annoyance instantly appears between her brows, her eyes dart quickly back and forth, her lips twitch nervously; she never for a moment shows you her profile at rest. Only now that she lies there with her eyes closed, motionless and unresisting, can I really contemplate that face (and doing so feels improper, like theft). Her features are rather angular, as if still unfinished; it is a face where child, woman and invalid mingle in a very attractive way. She is breathing gently through her lips, which are slightly open as if she were thirsty, but even this tiny effort makes her childishly small breasts rise and fall, and it has exhausted her, her pale face in its frame of red hair is laid back on her pillows. I move cautiously closer. The shadows under her eyes, the blue veins at her temples, the rosy translucence of her nostrils show what a thin, colourless protection her alabaster skin offers from the outside world. How sensitive she must be, I think, when the nerves throb so close to the surface, unprotected, how infinitely she must suffer with such an elfin body, light as thistledown, a body that seems made for swift running, for dancing, hovering in the air, and yet is cruelly chained to the hard, heavy earth! Poor, captive creature—once again I feel the hot springs of pity welling up from inside me. It is a painfully tiring and at the same time wildly exciting sensation that overcomes me every time I think of her unhappiness; my hand trembles with longing to caress her arm gently, bend over her and, as it were, pluck the smile from her lips if she wakes up and recognises me. A need for tenderness, mingling with my pity whenever I think of her or look at her, makes me go closer. But I do not want to disturb the sleep in which she escapes from herself and her physical reality. It is wonderful to be close to the sick when they are asleep, when all anxieties lie at rest inside them, when they have forgotten their frailty so entirely that a smile sometimes settles on their half-open lips like a butterfly settling on a leaf—a strange smile that does not really seem to be their own, and will be banished as soon as they wake up. What divine mercy, I think, that at least in sleep the crippled and mutilated know nothing about the form or perhaps the formlessness of their bodies, that in a gently deceptive dream at least their bodies appear to them beautiful and regular, that at least in the world of sleep, surrounded by the dark, suffering invalids can elude the curse to which they are physically chained. What strikes me most are her hands, lying crossed on the rug, long hands with shadowy veins, fragile joints and pointed, bluish nails—delicate, bloodless, helpless hands, perhaps strong enough to stroke small animals, pigeons and rabbits, but too weak to hold and grasp anything firmly. Much moved, I wonder how she can defend herself against real suffering with such helpless hands. How can she fight for anything, hold and keep it? And I am almost repelled by the thought of my own hands, firm, heavy, strong and muscular hands that can control the most intractable horse with a pull on the reins. Against my will, my eyes are now drawn to the rug, a shaggy, heavy rug, much too heavy for this bird-like creature, weighing down on her bony knees. Under that impervious covering lie her helpless legs —I don’t know whether they are crushed, crippled or simply deprived of strength, I have never had the courage to ask—but they are strapped into those steel and leather devices. At every movement, I remember, those cruel contraptions hang heavy as a ball and chain round her feeble joints; delicate and weak as she is, she always has to carry their horrible clinking and grinding about with her. You feel that to her, of all people, running, hovering, swinging through the air would be more natural than walking!","Involuntarily I paused and utilized this moment of hesitancy to survey the sleeping girl as though she were a picture. During all the time we had spent together I had never actually had an opportunity of looking straight at her, for, like all sensitive and hyper-sensitive people, she put up an unconscious resistance to letting herself be observed. Even if, when one was talking to her, one’s gaze rested on her merely by accident, the little angry furrow would appear between her brows, her eyelids would flutter, her lips twitch; not for an instant was it possible to catch a glimpse of her profile in repose. But now, as she lay there with closed eyes, I could scrutinize at my leisure (and I felt as though I were committing an impropriety, a rape almost) the somewhat angular and, so to speak, as yet unfinished features, in which the childish was mingled in the most fascinating way with the womanly and the frail. The lips, slightly parted as though she were thirsty, breathed gently, but even this tiny effort caused her thin, childish breast to rise and fall, and, as though exhausted, drained of blood, the pale face, nestling in the auburn hair, sank back on the pillow. I stole cautiously nearer. The shadows under the eyes, the blue veins on the temples, the reddish transparency of the nostrils , revealed what a thin and colourless outer shell it was that protected the alabaster-pale flesh from the outside world. How sensitive must one be, I thought to myself, for one’s nerves to throb so close beneath the surface, to be so exposed; how immeasurably must one suffer if one had such an airily light, elfin body, which seemed made to soar, to dance, to float, and were yet cruelly chained to the heavy, solid earth! Poor, fettered creature! Once again I felt that hot welling up of emotion within me, that painful, exhausting and yet wildly exciting gush of pity which overwhelmed me whenever I thought of the unfortunate creature. My hand trembled and I yearned to stroke her arm tenderly, to bend over her and to pluck a smile, so to speak, from her lips the moment she awoke and recognized me. A craving to display tenderness, an emotion that was inevitably mingled with my pity whenever I thought of her or looked at her, urged me to draw nearer to her. But I must not disturb this sleep, which kept her from herself, from the dread reality of her existence! It is a most wonderful thing to be close, to be near to the sick during their sleep, when all their feverish thoughts are held captive, when they are so completely oblivious of their infirmity that sometimes a smile lights upon their parted lips as a butterfly upon a delicate leaf, a smile foreign to them, a smile which does not belong to them, and which, moreover, is scared away on the very moment of awaking. What a mercy, I thought, that the crippled, the maimed, those whom Fate has cheated, at least in sleep have no knowledge of the shapeliness or unshapeliness of their bodies, that there at least that kindly deceiver, the dream, reveals their form to them as a thing of beauty and symmetry, that at least in the nebulous world of slumber the sufferer can escape the curse to which he is physically chained! What moved me most at this moment, however, were the hands which lay crossed on the coverlet, the dimly-veined, outstretched hands with their fragile, slender knuckles and tapering bluish nails — tender, bloodless, powerless hands, just strong enough, perhaps, to stroke little creatures, such as doves and rabbits, but too weak to clutch, to grasp anything. How is it possible, I thought with dismay, to beat off suffering with such feeble hands? How struggle against, seize, hold anything? And it almost repelled me to think of my own hands, those firm, heavy, muscular, strong hands which could control the most refractory horse with a tug at the reins. Involuntarily I found my gaze now resting on the rug, which lay, shaggy and heavy, far too heavy for this airy, insubstantial creature, across the thin knees. Beneath this opaque covering the impotent legs — I did not know whether they were smashed, crippled or merely atrophied, and I had never had the courage to ask — lay lifeless, stretched taut in that steel or leather contraption. I remembered how at each step the cruel apparatus hung like a dead weight on the crippled limbs, how she was condemned to drag the repulsive, clattering, grinding things for ever along with her — she so tender, so delicate, she of all people, she to whom one felt that floating and leaping and soaring aloft would come more naturally even than walking."

"Die Menschen? Was gehen Kanitz die Menschen an? Was kümmert’s ihn, ob sie gut sind oder schlecht? Abpachten den Gutshof und möglichst rasch und möglichst vorteilhaft! Er hört zu und nickt höflich, und während er zuhört und antwortet, rechnet er zugleich in einer anderen Ecke seines Gehirns: wie kann man die Sache am geschwindesten deichseln? Ein Konsortium gründen, das ganz Kekesfalva zur Pachtung übernimmt, die Landwirtschaft, die Zuckerfabrik, das Gestüt. Meinetwegen dann das Ganze dem Petrovic in Unterpacht geben und nur sich die Einrichtung sichern. Hauptsache bleibt: das Pachtgebot sofort machen und ihr tüchtig zusetzen mit der Angst; die nimmt alles, was man ihr bietet.

Then give the whole thing under lease to Petrovic and just secure the facility for himself.

"Ich hielt inne. Das Herz schlug mir, als wollte es aus der Brust springen. Denn noch während ich las, hatte ich plötzlich in einer unerträglichen Vision diesen listenreichen fremden Greis gesehen, wie er erst auf der Erde lag und tränend die Augen aufschlug, um von dem Mitleidigen Hilfe zu erflehen, ihn gesehen, wie er dann huckepack dem andern auf dem Rücken saß. Er hatte weißes gescheiteltes Haar, jener Djinn, und trug eine goldene Brille. Mit der ganzen Blitzhaftigkeit, mit der sonst nur Träume Bilder und Gesichter heranzureißen und zu vermengen verstehen, hatte ich dem Greise des Märchens instinktiv Kekesfalvas Gesicht geliehen, und ich war mit einmal selbst das unselige Reittier geworden, das er peitschte und vorwärtspeitschte, ja, ich fühlte um die Kehle den Druck so körperlich, daß mir der Atem stockte. Das Buch fiel mir aus den Händen, ich blieb liegen, eiskalt, und hörte mein Herz an die Rippen pochen wie an hartes Holz; noch durch den Schlaf jagte dieser grimmige Jäger weiter und weiter, ich wußte nicht wohin. Als ich morgens mit nassem Haar erwachte, war ich erschöpft und ausgemüdet wie nach unermeßlichem Weg.","I stopped. My heart was pounding as if it would jump out of my chest. For while I was still reading, I suddenly saw, in an unbearable vision, this cunning, strange old man, as he first lay on the ground and opened his eyes tearfully to beg the compassionate one for help, saw him then piggyback on the other sat on his back. He had white parted hair, that Djinn, and wore gold glasses. With all the flashiness with which otherwise only dreams can pull up and mix up images and faces, I instinctively lent Kekesfalva's face to the old man of the fairy tale, and I suddenly became the unfortunate mount myself, which he whipped and whipped forward, yes, I felt the pressure around my throat so physical it took my breath away. The book fell out of my hands, I lay there, freezing cold, and heard my heart pounding against my ribs like hard wood; Even when I was asleep, this fierce hunter hunted on and on, I didn't know where to go. When I woke up in the morning with wet hair, I was exhausted and exhausted as if after an immeasurable journey.","I stopped reading. My heart was thudding as if it would burst.

The djinn had sparse white hair and wore gold-rimmed glasses. With the sudden lightning intuition that, in the normal way, can mingle and associate images and faces only in dreams, I had instinctively given the old man in the story Kekesfalva’s features, and suddenly I myself had become the djinn’s unhappy victim, whipped on and on. I even felt such physical pressure around my throat that my breath faltered. The book fell from my hands, I lay where I was, cold as ice, hearing my heart thud against my ribs as if they were made of hard wood.

When I woke in the morning with my hair damp, I was as exhausted as if I had just been on a long journey.","I stopped reading. My heart was pounding as though about to burst out of my breast. For even as I had been reading, I had had an unbearable vision of the crafty old man first of all lying on the ground and turning up his tearful eyes imploringly for help, then riding pick-a-back on the young man’s shoulders. He had white hair with a parting, the djinn of my vision, and wore a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles. With the lightning rapidity with which only in dreams as a rule are scenes and faces conjured up and imposed one upon another, I had instinctively lent the old man of the fairy-story Kekesfalva’s features, and had myself all of a sudden become the luckless beast of burden which he spurred on and on — yes, the sensation of those legs twined about my throat was so physically vivid that I could scarcely breathe. The book fell from my hands, and I lay there in my bed, icy-cold; I could hear my heart beating against my ribs as though against hard wood. Even in my sleep this grim hunter urged me on and on, I knew not whither. When in the morning I awoke, my hair damp with sweat , I was as weary and exhausted as though I had travelled along an unending road."
"Ich mußte sehr entschieden gesprochen haben, denn Condor blickte mich etwas verdutzt an.","I must have spoken very decisively, because Condor looked at me in amazement.","I must have spoken very firmly, because Condor looked at me, rather taken aback.","I must have expressed myself very firmly, for Condor gave me a somewhat baffled look."

Your daughter had unconditional trust in Doctor Condor, and if he recommended this treatment to her so urgently...

"Ich stand zugleich mit ihm auf, obwohl ich mich noch einigermaßen taumlig fühlte. Denn etwas Sonderbares ging in mir vor. Ich war äußerst erregt, sogar von einer gesteigerten, überreizten Wachheit durch all dies überraschend Erfahrene; aber gleichzeitig spürte ich einen dumpfen Druck an einer ganz bestimmten Stelle. Ich erinnerte mich deutlich: mitten während seines Erzählens hatte ich Condor etwas fragen wollen und nur nicht die Geistesgegenwart gehabt, ihn zu unterbrechen: irgend ein Detail wollte ich fragen an einer bestimmten Stelle! Und jetzt, da jene Frage erlaubt war, erinnerte ich mich nicht mehr; sie mußte weggeschwemmt worden sein von der Erregung des Zuhörens. Vergebens tastete ich die ganzen Windungen des Gesprächs zurück – es war, wie wenn man in seinem Leib einen ganz präzisen Schmerz fühlt und ihn doch nicht zu lokalisieren vermag. Während der Minute, da wir durch die schon halbverlassene Weinstube hinausschritten, blieb ich einzig mit der inneren Bemühung beschäftigt, mich zu erinnern.","I got up at the same time as him, although I still felt somewhat dizzy. Because something strange happened to me. I was extremely aroused, even from a heightened, overexcited alertness, by all this surprising experience; but at the same time I felt a dull pressure in a very specific place. I remembered clearly: in the middle of his story I wanted to ask Condor something and just didn't have the presence of mind to interrupt him: I wanted to ask some detail at a certain point! And now that that question was allowed, I no longer remembered; she must have been swept away by the excitement of listening. In vain I groped back the whole thread of the conversation - it was like feeling a very precise pain in your body and yet not being able to localize it. The minute we walked out through the half-deserted wine bar, I was occupied solely with the inner effort to remember.","I stood up too when he did, although I still felt rather unsteady on my legs. For something strange was happening to me. I was extremely agitated, and indeed my perception was more alert than usual after hearing so much that was surprising, but at the same time I had a dull, sinking feeling in some part of myself. I clearly remembered that in the middle of his story I had wanted to ask Condor something, but I had not had the presence of mind to interrupt him. Yes, there was some detail that I wanted to ask at a particular point, and now that I had the opportunity to put questions I couldn’t remember what it was. It must have been swept away by my emotions as I listened. In vain I groped my way back through the intricate course of Condor’s narrative—it was like feeling a very distinct pain in some part of the body without being able to pinpoint its exact location. As we walked out of the now half-empty wine bar, I was concentrating entirely on my efforts to remember.","I also rose, although I still felt somewhat dizzy. For something strange was taking place within me. I was agitated in the extreme, was even plunged into a state of heightened awareness by all the astonishing things I had heard; at the same time I was conscious of a dull pressure on my brain, a pressure on a quite definite spot. I remembered clearly that while Condor had been talking I had wanted to ask him something, but had not had the presence of mind to interrupt him; there had been some question I had wanted to put at a particular point in his narrative. And now that I was free to ask any question I pleased, I could no longer remember what it was; it must have been swept away in the excitement of listening. In vain I tried to trace back the thread of the whole conversation — it was just as when you feel a quite specific pain in some part of the body and are yet unable to locate it. As we crossed the now half-deserted public bar I was entirely taken up with the mental effort of trying to remember."
"»Nun gut, ich geh schon, obwohl’s gar keinen Sinn hat, gar keinen Sinn. Verzeihen Sie, Herr Leutnant, ich hoffe, Sie kommen bald wieder.«","""Well, I'll go, although there's no point, no point. Forgive me, Lieutenant, I hope you'll be back soon.""","However, she suddenly blushes and murmurs with more docility, “It’s all right, there’s no point in it, but I’ll go. Forgive me, Lieutenant Hofmiller. I hope you will come to see us again soon.”","‘All right then, I’ll go, although there’s no point in it, absolutely no point.

"Sie lief zum Schrank, füllte ein Glas, und ich kippte es rasch hinab. Beunruhigt blickte Ilona mir zu, wie ich mit zitternder Hand das Glas abstellte (nie in meinem Leben hatte ich mich so schwach, so ausgeschöpft gefühlt). Dann setzte sie sich still zu mir und wartete, ohne zu sprechen, manchmal nur von der Seite vorsichtig den beunruhigten Blick zu mir aufhebend, wie man einen Kranken beobachtet. Endlich fragte sie:","She ran to the cupboard, filled a glass, and I downed it quickly. Ilona watched me uneasily as I put the glass down with a trembling hand (never in my life had I felt so weak, so exhausted). Then she sat down quietly beside me and waited without speaking, sometimes only carefully lifting her worried look at me from the side, as one watches a sick person. Finally she asked:","She went over to the sideboard and filled a glass. I knocked it straight back. Ilona was looking at me in concern as I put the glass down with a shaking hand (never in my life had I felt so weak, so exhausted), and she sat down with me and waited in silence, sometimes cautiously casting me an anxious sidelong glance, as if she were watching an invalid. At last she asked, “Did Edith … say anything?","She ran to the cupboard and poured out a glass; I gulped it down. She gazed at me uneasily as I put down the glass with shaking hand (never in my life had I felt so weak, so utterly shattered). Then she quietly sat down beside me and waited in silence, occasionally stealing a sidelong, cautious, uneasy glance at my face, as though I were ill. ‘Did Edith ... say anything?’ she asked at length."
"Kanitz wurde blaß. Genau so hoch hatte er seinerseits kalkuliert, genau das Dreifache dieser künstlich herabgedrückten Schätzung, also sechshunderttausend bis siebenhunderttausend Kronen, und dabei hatte der Anwalt doch gar keine Ahnung von den chinesischen Vasen. Wieviel ihr jetzt bieten? Die Ziffern zuckten und schwirrten ihm vor den Augen.","Kanitz turned pale. That's exactly what he had calculated, exactly three times the artificially reduced estimate, that is six hundred thousand to seven hundred thousand crowns, and the lawyer had absolutely no idea about the Chinese vases. How much are you bidding now? The digits twitched and whirred before his eyes.","“Kanitz turned pale. The sum, he worked out, tallied with his own calculations—Kekesfalva would be worth exactly three times this artificially low estimate. The real value, then, would be six hundred thousand to seven hundred thousand crowns—and the lawyer didn’t even know about the Chinese porcelain. How much was he going to offer her now? The figures danced and blurred before his eyes.","Kanitz turned pale.

"Abermals tischten die beiden Diener Dinge auf, die ich bisher nur vom Hörensagen und vom Prahlen begüterter Kameraden kannte; Kaviar, köstlichen, eisgekühlten, ich schmeckte ihn zum erstenmal, Rehpastete und Fasanen, und dazu immer wieder diese Weine, die wohlig die Sinne beschwingten. Ich weiß, daß es dumm ist, von solchen Dingen sich imponieren zu lassen. Aber warum es leugnen? Ich kleiner, junger, unverwöhnter Leutnant genoß es mit geradezu kindischer Eitelkeit, mit so angesehenen älteren Herren derart schlaraffisch zu tafeln. Donnerwetter, dachte ich immer wieder, Donnerwetter, das sollte der Wawruschka sehen und der käsige Freiwillige, der uns immer anprotzt, wie üppig sie in Wien beim Sacher diniert haben! In ein solches Haus sollten sie einmal kommen, da würden sie Mund und Augen aufreißen! Ja, wenn sie zuschauen dürften, diese Neidhammel, wie ich da munter sitze und der Oberstleutnant aus dem Kriegsministerium mir zutrinkt, wie ich mit dem Direktor der Zuckerfabrik freundschaftlich diskutiere und er dann ganz ernsthaft äußert: »Ich bin überrascht, wie Sie mit all dem vertraut sind.«","Again the two servants served things that I had only heard about and boasted about from wealthy comrades; Caviar, delicious, ice-cold, I tasted it for the first time, venison pie and pheasants, and again and again these wines, which pleasantly exhilarated the senses. I know it's foolish to be impressed by such things. But why deny it? I, a small, young, unspoiled lieutenant, enjoyed with almost childish vanity the slouchy banquet with such distinguished elderly gentlemen. Oh my gosh, I kept thinking, gosh, the Wavrushka and the cheesy volunteer who always brags to us about how sumptuously they dined at the Sacher in Vienna should see that! If they ever came into such a house, they would open their mouths and eyes wide open! Yes, if you could watch, these envious bastards, as I sit there cheerfully and the lieutenant colonel from the War Department drinks to me, how I have a friendly discussion with the director of the sugar factory and he then says quite seriously: ""I'm surprised how you are with all this are familiar.""","Once again the two servants waiting at table handed round wonderful dishes previously known to me only by hearsay and from the boasting of more prosperous comrades: chilled caviar—delicious; it was the first time I had tasted it—venison pie, pheasants, and all accompanied by those wines that so pleasingly delighted the senses. I know it’s stupid to be impressed by such things. But why deny it? As an insignificant young lieutenant, unused to indulgence, I felt a positively childish vanity to be eating at so lavish a table with such distinguished older men. Good heavens, I kept thinking, good heavens, I wish Vavreschka could see this, and that pasty-faced volunteer who’s always showing off about the magnificent dinners he’s had at the Hotel Sacher in Vienna! They ought to be in a house like this some day, then their eyes would widen and their jaws would drop. Ah yes, if those envious fellows could see me sitting here at my ease, with the Lieutenant Colonel from the War Ministry raising his glass to me, if only they could see me in friendly discussion with the director of the sugar factory, and hear him say, meaning it, “I’m surprised to find you know so much about all this.”","Once again dishes were served that I had known hitherto only from hearsay or the boasting of well-to-do fellow-officers: caviare, icy-cold and delicious, which I tasted for the first time, venison pasty and pheasant, and, one after another, those wines that so pleasantly titillated the senses. I know it is stupid to let oneself be impressed by such things. But — why deny it? — it was with positively childish vanity that I, an insignificant young greenhorn, enjoyed dining in such Lucullan fashion with these eminent elderly gentlemen. Good lord, I kept thinking, good lord, Vavrushka should be here to see all this, and that lousy fellow who’s always been bragging to us about the princely meals he and his friends have had at Sacher’s in Vienna! They should jolly well come to a house like this for once, and then they’d open their eyes and mouths wide! Yes, if only they could see me sitting here so cheerily, the beastly dogs in the manger, could see the Lieutenant-Colonel from the War Ministry drinking my health, could see me deep in a friendly discussion with the director of the sugar-factory, and could hear him remark quite seriously, ‘I say, how well-informed you are!’"

"Condor hielt inne. Er wartete offenbar auf meine Zustimmung. Aber ich wagte nicht, seinem Blick zu begegnen; innen jagten jetzt, vom pochenden Herzschlag aufgetrieben, die Bilder des gestrigen Tages vorüber. Wie wir heiter über das sommerliche Land gefahren waren und das Gesicht der Kranken hatte von Sonne und Glück gestrahlt. Wie sie die kleinen Fohlen streichelte, wie sie als Königin bei dem Feste saß, wie immer und immer wieder dem Alten die Tränen niederliefen in den lachenden und zuckenden Mund. Das alles mit einem einzigen Hieb zerstören! Die Verwandelte wieder rückverwandeln, die so herrlich ihrer Verzweiflung Entrissene mit einem Wort in alle Höllen der Ungeduld wieder zurückstoßen!

But I dared not meet his eyes; inside, the images of the previous day, roused by the pounding heartbeat, raced past. How cheerfully we drove across the summer country and the patient's face shone with sun and happiness. How she stroked the little foals, how she sat as queen at the party, how time and again the tears ran down the laughing and twitching mouth of the old man. Destroy it all with a single blow! To transform back those who have been transformed, those who have been so wonderfully snatched from their despair and pushed back with a word into all the hells of impatience! No, I knew I would never be able to offer a hand. So I timidly said:","Condor stopped. He was obviously waiting for me to agree.

The way she petted the little foals and sat enthroned like a queen at the wedding party, the way the old man’s tears kept running down into his laughing, trembling mouth. To think of destroying all that with a single blow! To turn a girl so wonderfully transformed, plucked out of her despair, back into what she had been before, to thrust her away into all the hells of impatience with a word! No, I knew I could never put my hand to that task. So I said, hesitantly, “But wouldn’t it be better to … ” and then my voice faltered again before his searching gaze.","Condor paused. He was obviously waiting for my assent. But I did not dare to meet his gaze.

Was I to shatter all that at one blow? To change back into her suffering self an Edith who had been so transformed, with one word to drive back into the purgatory of impatience the girl who had been so gloriously snatched from despair! No, I knew that I should never lift a finger to do such a thing. ‘But couldn’t we ...?’"

"»Schon gut … schon gut … nur keine Geschwüre!« unterbrach ihn Condor schnell. »Ich glaube Ihnen auch so. Erledigt, meine Frage! Peccavi! Ich habe halt danebengepatzt – eine falsche Diagnose, das kommt schließlich auch bei Hofräten und Professoren vor.

So that was my question—peccavi! I was wide of the mark—a wrong diagnosis, anyone can make one, however academically distinguished. Stupid of me … and yet I could have sworn that … Well, then it must be something else. Strange, though, very strange. May I? … ” He poured himself a third cup of black coffee.","‘All right ... all right ... spare me your oaths!’ Condor quickly interrupted him. ‘ I believe you without all that. That’s settled.

I repeated to buy time. ""Well... you know... you know, quite favourable... Doctor Condor hopes for the best results in time...

"»Lieber Balinkay«, sage ich auf jene knappe Art, die jede Diskussion abwehrt, »sei so freundlich und erlaß mir jede Explikation. Jeder weiß, was er will und was er muß.

"Aber neues Pech: gerade heute steht am Rathausplatz kein Fiaker, ich muß warten, bis man ein achthufiges Gefährt herantelephoniert. So wird’s unvermeidlich, daß, wie ich schließlich bei Kekesfalvas in der großen Hall lande, der lange Zeiger an der Wanduhr schon vertikal herunterhängt, genau halb neun statt acht Uhr, und ich sehe, die Mäntel in der Garderobe bauschen sich bereits dick übereinander. Auch an dem etwas befangenen Gesicht des Dieners merke ich, daß ich reichlich verspätet anrücke – unangenehm, unangenehm, so etwas gerade bei einem ersten Besuch!","But new bad luck: just today there is no carriage on the town hall square, I have to wait until an eight-horse carriage is called over by telephone. So it becomes inevitable that by the time I finally land at Kekesfalvas in the great hall, the long hand on the wall clock is already hanging down vertically, exactly eight-thirty instead of eight, and I see the coats in the cloakroom are already piled high. I can also tell from the servant's somewhat self-conscious face that I'm arriving quite late - unpleasant, unpleasant, something like that especially on a first visit!","Bad luck again, however—there’s no cab in the square outside the town hall, I have to wait while someone telephones for a two-horse carriage. So it’s inevitable, when I finally arrive in the hall of Herr von Kekesfalva’s house, that the big hand of the clock on the wall is pointing vertically down; it is eight-thirty instead of eight, and the coats in the cloakroom are piled on top of each other. The rather anxious look on the servant’s face also shows me that I am decidedly late—how unlucky, how really unlucky for such a thing to happen on a first visit.","But now came a further bit of bad luck. Today of all days there was no cab in the Rathausplatz, and I had to wait until they had telephoned for a carriage. And so when at long last I landed up in the great entrance hall of the Kekesfalva house, the minute hand of the clock on the wall was already hanging down vertically; it was exactly half-past eight instead of eight, and I could see that the cloakroom was bulging with overcoats. I could tell, too, by the man-servant’s somewhat embarrassed expression that I had arrived too late — disagreeable, very disagreeable, for such a thing to happen on one’s first visit!"
"Condor hob jetzt zum erstenmal die Stirne und sah mich geradeaus an. Aber es lag keineswegs Strenge in seinem Blick. Im Gegenteil, mir war, als hätte er Mitleid mit mir.

"Ich blieb ein wenig beunruhigt wegen Edith, der ich im Wagen gegenübersaß. Sie zitterte noch immer am ganzen Leibe; etwas Heftiges schien sie zu bedrängen. Und auf einmal brach ein jähes Schluchzen aus ihr hervor. Aber es war ein Schluchzen des Glücks. Sie weinte, während sie lachte, und lachte, während sie weinte. Zweifellos hatte die listige Zigeunerin ihr baldige Genesung prophezeit, vielleicht sogar noch anderes dazu.","I remained a little concerned about Edith, who I was sitting across from in the car. Her whole body was still trembling; something violent seemed to oppress her. And suddenly a sudden sob broke out of her. But it was a sob of happiness.

No doubt the cunning gypsy had prophesied her speedy recovery, perhaps something else as well.","I was a little uneasy about Edith as I sat opposite her in the carriage. She was still trembling all over, and some violent emotion seemed to be preying on her mind. All at once a sudden sob burst from her throat— but it was a sob of joy.

"»Gut.« Condor schob das Glas mit einem Ruck von sich. Wir hatten keiner einen Tropfen getrunken. »Oder vielmehr: hoffen wir, daß es gut ausgeht, denn ganz behaglich fühl ich mich bei diesem Hinausschieben nicht. Ich werde Ihnen jetzt genau sagen, wie weit ich gehe – keinen Schritt über die Wahrheit hinaus.

After all, we both mean equally well by this poor sick girl.’"

"»Gewiß – im ersten Anlauf würden wir ein gutes Stück vorwärtskommen, Frauen reagieren doch immer in erstaunlicher Weise auf Gefühle, auf Illusionen. Aber denken Sie sich selber die Situation in ein paar Monaten aus, wenn die sogenannten psychischen Kräfte, von denen wir sprachen, erschöpft sind, der aufgepeitschte Wille verbraucht, die Leidenschaft vertan, und noch immer, nach Wochen und Wochen aufzehrendster Anspannung, stellt sich die Genesung nicht ein, jene totale Genesung, mit der sie doch jetzt rechnet wie mit einer Gewißheit. – Bitte, denken Sie sich das aus in seiner katastrophalen Wirkung auf ein sensibles, ohnehin von Ungeduld schon ganz aufgezehrtes Geschöpf! Es handelt sich bei unserer Sache doch nicht um eine kleine Besserung, sondern um etwas Fundamentales, um die Umstellung von der langsamen und sicheren Methode der Geduld auf die verwegene und gefährliche der Ungeduld! Wie sollte sie je noch Vertrauen haben zu mir, zu einem anderen Arzt, zu irgend einem Menschen, wenn sie sich vorsätzlich getäuscht sieht? Lieber also die Wahrheit, so grausam sie scheint: in der Medizin ist das Messer oft die mildere Methode. Nur nichts hinausschieben! Mit gutem Gewissen könnte ich eine solche Hinterhältigkeit nicht verantworten. Überlegen Sie selbst! Hätten Sie an meiner Stelle den Mut?«","'Certainly - on the first attempt we would make good progress, women always react in an amazing way to feelings, to illusions. But imagine for yourself the situation in a few months, when the so-called psychic powers of which we spoke are exhausted, the whipped-up will is exhausted, the passion wasted, and still, after weeks and weeks of the most exhausting tension, the Not a recovery, that total recovery that she now counts on as if she were certain. – Please think about the catastrophic effect it would have on a sensitive creature already consumed by impatience! Our cause is not about a small improvement, but about something fundamental, about changing from the slow and sure method of patience to the bold and dangerous one of impatience! How could she ever have any more trust in me, in another doctor, in anyone, when she sees herself deliberately deceived? Better the truth, no matter how cruel it may seem: in medicine, the knife is often the milder method. Don't put off anything! I couldn't in good conscience take responsibility for such underhandedness. Think for yourself! If you were me, would you have the courage?”","“Certainly—at first we would get a good way forward. Women always react astonishingly well to feelings and illusions. All the same, think of the situation in a few months’ time when what we call her psychological forces are exhausted, the will she has wound up to such a high pitch is used up, her passion spent, and still after weeks and weeks of tiring effort there is no cure, not the complete cure on which she now counts as a certainty. Please think of the catastrophic effect of that on a sensitive creature already consumed with impatience! We are not talking about a small improvement in this case, we are talking about something fundamental, of changing from the slow but sure method of patience to the bold and dangerous course of impatience! How is she ever to trust me again, or any other doctor or any other human being, if she sees that she has been deliberately deceived? Better the truth, then, cruel as it may seem; in medicine the knife is always the more merciful approach. We must not put this off! I could not be responsible, with a clear conscience, for such an underhand act. Think about it yourself! Would you have the courage to do that, in my place?”","At the start we should see considerable progress — after all, women react amazingly to emotions, to illusions. But just think what the situation will be in a few months when the so-called psychical forces of which we spoke are exhausted, the will which has been whipped up played out, the fervour used up, and when, after weeks and weeks of wearing emotional tension, there is still no sign of recovery, the complete recovery upon which she now counts as upon a certainty! Just consider what a catastrophic effect that would have on a sensitive person, who is in any case devoured by impatience! In Edith’s case it is not a question of a slight improvement, but of something fundamental, of a changeover from slow and sure methods, methods relying on patience, to risky and dangerous ones, based on impatience. How can we expect her ever again to have confidence in me, in any other doctor, or in any human being, when she realizes that she has been so deliberately deceived? Rather, then, the truth, however cruel it may seem. In medicine the use of the knife is often the kinder course. Never procrastinate. I could never take the responsibility for such dissimulation with a clear conscience. Think it out for yourself. Would you have the courage in my place?’"
"Rasch, rasch, dachte ich mit wachsendem Unbehagen: so beugte ich mich eiligst nieder und streifte leicht und flüchtig mit den Lippen ihre Stirn. Mit Absicht rührte ich kaum an ihre Haut und spürte nur von nahe den verworrenen Duft ihres Haares.","Quickly, quickly, I thought with growing uneasiness: so I bent down hastily and brushed my lips lightly and fleetingly on her forehead. On purpose I barely touched her skin and only felt the tangled scent of her hair from close up.","Quick, I thought with increasing discomfort, quick, and I bent down swiftly and brushed her forehead with my lips, lightly, fleetingly. I deliberately hardly touched her hair, and felt only, at close quarters, the confusing scent of her skin.","Quickly, quickly! I thought, in growing discomfort. And I bent over her as hurriedly as possible, my lips rested lightly and fleetingly on her forehead. Quite deliberately, I scarcely touched her skin, and only from near-by inhaled the faint fragrance of her hair."
"Dummkopf! – auch das verstand ich jetzt, warum just dieses Wort ihr inmitten der Panik des Gefühls von der Lippe gefahren, während sie die halbgeformte Brust der meinen entgegenpreßte. Dummkopf! – ja, sie hatte recht, mich so zu nennen! Alle mußten längst alles durchschaut haben vom ersten Augenblick, der Vater und Ilona und der Diener und das übrige Gesinde. Alle mußten ihre Liebe, ihre Leidenschaft längst geargwöhnt haben, mit Erschrecken vielleicht und wahrscheinlich mit schlimmem Vorgefühl – nur ich ahnte nichts, der Narr meines Mitleids, der den guten, den braven, den tölpischen Kameraden spielte, der breitmäulig spaßte und nicht merkte, daß sie sich an meinem unverständigen, unverständlichen Nichtverstehen die brennende Seele zerquälte. Wie in einer schlechten Komödie der triste Held inmitten einer Intrige steht, jeder einzelne im Zuschauerraum weiß schon längst, daß er umstrickt ist, und nur er, der Tölpel allein, spielt todernst weiter, unbekümmert weiter und weiter und begreift noch immer nicht, in welches Netz er geriet (und die andern kennen schon jeden Faden und jede Masche von Anfang an) – so mußten alle im Haus zugesehen haben, wie ich herumtappte bei diesem albernen Blindekuhspiel des Gefühls, bis sie mir endlich gewaltsam die Binde von den Augen riß. Aber wie ein einziges aufflammendes Licht genügt, um in einem Zimmer gleichzeitig ein Dutzend Gegenstände zu erhellen, so wurde mir jetzt im nachhinein – zu spät, zu spät! – eine Unzahl Einzelheiten all dieser Wochen beschämend verständlich. Jetzt erst blitzte in mir auf, warum ich sie jedesmal erbitterte, wenn ich sie übermütig »Kind« nannte, sie, die doch gerade vor mir nicht als Kind gelten, sondern als Frau, als Geliebte ersehnt werden wollte. Jetzt erst begriff ich, warum ihr manchmal die Lippen unruhig bebten, wenn ihre Lahmheit mich sichtlich erschütterte, warum sie ingrimmig mein Mitleid haßte – offenbar erkannte hellseherisch der weibliche Instinkt in ihr, daß Mitleid ein viel zu laues Schwestergefühl und nur trister Ersatz wirklicher Liebe sei. Wie mußte die Arme gewartet haben auf ein Wort, auf ein Zeichen des Begreifens, das noch immer und immer nicht kam, wie mußte sie gelitten haben unter meiner plaudernden Unbefangenheit, indes sie auf dem glühenden Rost der Ungeduld lag und mit zuckender Seele wartete, wartete auf die erste zärtliche Geste, oder zumindest wartete, daß ich ihrer Leidenschaft endlich gewahr würde. Und ich, ich hatte nichts gesagt, nichts getan und war doch nicht fortgeblieben, sie unablässig bestärkend durch mein tägliches Kommen und gleichzeitig verstörend durch meine seelische Schwerhörigkeit – wie verständlich darum, daß ihr schließlich die Nerven rissen und sie mich nahm als ihre Beute!","Fool! – I understood that too now, why exactly this word escaped her lips in the midst of the panic of feeling while she pressed her half-formed breast against mine. Fool! – yes, she was right to call me that! Everyone must have figured it all out from the first moment, father and Ilona and the servant and the rest of the servants. Everyone must have long suspected their love, their passion, perhaps with horror and probably with bad anticipation - only I suspected nothing, the fool of my pity, who played the good, the good, the clumsy comrade, who joked broadly and didn't notice that she tormented her burning soul at my incomprehensible, incomprehensible lack of understanding. As in a bad comedy, the sad hero stands in the middle of an intrigue, everyone in the auditorium has known for a long time that he has been entangled, and only he, the dolt alone, goes on deadly serious, unconcernedly on and on and still does not understand into which one Net he got (and the others already know every thread and stitch from the beginning) - so everyone in the house must have watched me groping around in this silly blind man's bluff game of feeling, until at last she violently tore the blindfold from my eyes. But just as a single flash of light is enough to illuminate a dozen objects in a room at the same time, in retrospect I felt - too late, too late! – a myriad of details from all these weeks shamefully understandable. Only now did it dawn on me why I embittered her every time I called her ""child"" arrogantly, she who I didn't want to count as a child, but wanted to be longed for as a woman, as a lover. Only now did I understand why her lips sometimes quivered restlessly when her lameness visibly shook me, why she hated my pity so furiously—apparently her clairvoyant feminine instinct recognized that pity was far too tepid a sisterly feeling and only a sad substitute for real love . How the poor must have waited for a word, for a sign of understanding that still and still didn't come, how she must have suffered under my chattering impartiality, while she lay on the red-hot grid of impatience and waited, waiting with a trembling soul for the first tender gesture, or at least waited for me to finally become aware of her passion. And I, I had said nothing, done nothing and yet not stayed away, constantly encouraging her through my daily coming and at the same time disturbing her through my mental hearing loss - how understandable that her nerves finally tore and she took me as her prey!","Idiot! Now I understood why she came out with that particular word in the midst of her turbulent emotions, while she clung to me pressing her half-developed breasts close to my chest. Idiot—yes, she was right to call me an idiot! It must have been obvious to everyone else from the first—her father and Ilona, Josef and the rest of the domestic staff. They must all of them have suspected that she nurtured loving, indeed passionate feelings—perhaps they suspected it with horror, probably with dark foreboding. Everyone but me, fooled as I was by my own pity, playing the part of good, kind, sometimes clumsy friend, joking all the time, never noticing how my incomprehensible failure to understand was tormenting her ardent feelings. Just as in a bad farce the unfortunate hero is at the centre of an intrigue, every member of the audience has known for ages what a fix he is in, and only he, the idiot, goes on acting in deadly earnest, never understanding what a tangled web he is caught up in (while everyone else has seen every twist and turn in the web from the first)—so all of them in the house must have seen me groping around in a silly game of emotional blind man’s buff, until the blindfold was suddenly snatched awry from my eyes. But in the same way as a single light flaring up is enough to illuminate a dozen objects in a room at the same time, I now, in retrospect—too late, too late!—recognised, to my shame, the meaning of many little incidents over all these weeks. Only now did I see why she was so angry whenever I cheerfully called her “child”—she didn’t want to appear a child to me, but a woman, to be desired as a lover. Only now did I see why her lips often quivered restlessly when her lameness obviously distressed me, why she hated my pity so bitterly—obviously her feminine instinct recognised that pity is far too lukewarm a feeling, an emotion to be felt between brother and sister, a poor imitation of real love. How the unhappy girl must have waited for some word, some sign that I understood—and it never, never came! How she must have suffered, listening to me chattering on inconsequentially, while she was racked by impatience, waiting with a trembling heart, waiting for the first tender gesture, or at least waiting for me to understand, at long last, how passionate her feelings were. I had not said anything, I had not done anything, and yet I hadn’t stayed away, thus both strengthening her feelings by my daily attendance and distressing her by my lack of perception —how understandable it was, then, that her nerves finally failed her and she fixed on me as her prey!","‘Silly!’ — now too I understood why this particular word had risen to her lips in the midst of her emotion, as she had pressed her immature breast to mine. ‘Silly!’ — she had been right to call me that. They must all have seen through the whole thing from the very start — the old man and Ilona and Josef and the other servants. They must all long since have suspected her love, her passion, viewed it with alarm, no doubt with foreboding. I alone had had no inkling of it, I, the foolish slave of my pity, who had played the role of the good, kind, blundering comrade, who had joked like a clown and never noticed that my blindness, my incomprehensible lack of perception, had been excruciating torture to her ardent soul. Just as in a cheap farce the sorry hero is the centre of an intrigue, the ramifications of which everyone in the audience has long since realized, and only he, poor innocent, goes on playing in deadly earnest, blissfully unaware of the net in which he is entangled (although the others have known its every thread and every mesh from the outset) — so everyone at Kekesfalva must have seen me blundering about in this foolish blind-man’s-bluff of the emotions until at last she had torn the bandage violently from my eyes. But just as a single flash of light suffices to illuminate a dozen objects in a room simultaneously, so now in retrospect — too late, alas, too late! — did innumerable details of the past few weeks become embarrassingly plain to me. Only now did it occur to me why it was she had been so infuriated whenever I had blithely called her ‘my dear child’ — she, who wished to be regarded by me of all people not as a child but as a woman, to be yearned for as a lover. Only now did I realize why her lips sometimes quivered so ominously when she saw that her lameness so visibly affected me, why my pity so enraged her. Obviously she had realized with a woman’s clairvoyant instinct that pity is far too lukewarm and fraternal a feeling, and but a sorry substitute for real love. How the poor creature must have waited for a word, a sign of understanding that never came, how she must have suffered from my easy garrulity while she lay on the burning spit of impatience, and with trembling soul waited, waited, for the first tender gesture, or at least for me to become aware of her passion! And I, I had said nothing and yet had not stayed away, ever giving her fresh strength by my daily visits and at the same time driving her to distraction by my spiritual deafness. How easy it was to understand, then, that her nerves should at last have got the better of her and that she should have pounced upon me as her prey!"

I need something to drink now, something to drink!","Anywhere but home. Anywhere but up to my empty room, where I should be alone with these horrible thoughts.

"»Ja, Kanitz, Leopold Kanitz, ich kann’s nicht ändern; erst viel später hat man auf Antrag eines Ministers den Namen so klangvoll magyarisiert und mit einem Adelsprädikat geschmückt. Sie haben sich wahrscheinlich nicht daran erinnert, daß ein Mann mit Einfluß und guten Verbindungen, der lange hier wohnt, peau neuve machen, sich den Namen magyarisieren und manchmal sogar sich adeln lassen kann. Schließlich – wie sollten Sie junger Mensch das wissen, es ist über dies schrecklich viel Wasser die Leitha hinabgelaufen, seit dieser Dreikäsehoch, dieser scharfäugige, verschmitzte Judenbub dort den Bauern auf Pferde oder Wagen achtgab, indes sie im Wirtshaus soffen, oder für eine Handvoll Kartoffeln den Marktweibern ihre Körbe nach Hause schleppte.","»Yes, Kanitz, Leopold Kanitz, I can't help it; Only much later, at the request of a minister, was the name so sonorous Magyarized and adorned with a title of nobility. You probably haven't remembered that a man of influence and connections who has lived here for a long time can make himself peau neuve, magyarize his name, and sometimes even get himself knighted. After all – how should you young people know that, an awful lot of water has flowed down the Leitha since that Dreikäsehoch, this sharp-eyed, mischievous Jew boy was watching over the farmers there on horses or wagons while they drank in the inn, or for a handful of potatoes dragged their baskets home to the market women.","“Yes, Kanitz, Leopold Kanitz, I can’t help that. It was only much later that, at the request of a government minister, the name was so sonorously made to sound Magyar and provided with the noble particle von. You may not have remembered that after living here for a long time, a man with influence and good connections can get himself a new identity, have his name Magyarised, and sometimes even have the noble von added into the bargain. After all, you’re a young man, there’s no reason why you should know what a great deal of water has flowed along the River Lajtha since the time when that sharp-eyed, clever little Jewish lad was holding horses for the local farmers, or guarding their carts while they drank in the tavern, or carrying baskets home for market women in return for a handful of potatoes.","‘Yes, Kanitz — Leopold Kanitz, I can’t change that. It was only much later that on the recommendation of a Minister the name was so sonorously Magyarized and decked out with a prefix of nobility.

A young fellow like you can’t be expected to know that; and besides, a great deal of water has flowed under the bridge since that puny creature, that keen-eyed, wily young Jewish lad minded the peasants’ horses or carriages whilst they were drinking in the inn, or carried the market-women’s baskets for them in return for a handful of potatoes."

"Und sofort, mit einem einzigen Schlag, wurde es still, auch die Duseligsten blinzelten auf und waren wach. Der Oberst kündigte kurz an, daß vormittags eine überraschend angesetzte Inspektion des Divisionärs zu erwarten sei. Er zähle darauf, daß alles tadellos klappen und keiner dem Regiment Schande machen werde. Nun aber geschah das Sonderbare: mit einem Riß und Ruck hatten wir alle unsere Sinne beisammen. Als hätte man ein inneres Fenster aufgerissen, war der ganze Dunst von Alkohol verflogen, die verschwommenen Gesichter veränderten, spannten sich unter dem Anruf der Pflicht, im Nu strammte sich jeder zusammen, und zwei Minuten später war die verwüstete Tafel verlassen, jeder wußte wach und klar, was ihm zu tun oblag. Die Mannschaft wurde geweckt, die Ordonnanzen sausten, bis zum letzten Sattelknopf wurde noch alles rasch geputzt und gestriegelt; tadellos lief dann ein paar Stunden später die gefürchtete Inspektion ab.","And immediately, with a single smack, there was silence, even the dumbest blinked and were awake.

But now the strange thing happened: with a tear and a jolt we had all our senses together. As if an inner window had been flung open, all the haze of alcohol had evaporated, the blurred faces changed, tensed under the call of duty, in an instant everyone braced themselves, and two minutes later the devastated table was deserted, everyone knew awake and clear what he had to do.

And now a strange thing happened—all at once every one of us was in full possession of his wits. As if someone had flung open a window, the fumes of alcohol dispersed, our blurred faces changed, responding to the call of duty, everyone pulled himself together, and two minutes later the table, that scene of wild indulgence, was abandoned. We were all wide awake, our minds clear, and we all knew what we had to do. The men were roused, the orderlies got busy, everything was swiftly groomed and polished down to the last pommel on the last saddle, and a few hours later the much-feared inspection took place and went without a hitch.","And instantly, before you could say Jack Robinson, there was complete silence; even the most befuddled of us blinked and came to life.

Just as though some inner window had been thrown open, all the fumes of alcohol were dissipated, the bleary faces changed, tensed, at the call of duty; in a trice every man pulled himself together. Two minutes later the table with all its wreckage was deserted, and every one of us knew exactly what was expected of him.

"Ich fühlte mich ertappt. Jetzt oder nie galt es, den herzlichen, den richtig begeisterten Ton zu finden.

»So? … einfach? Gut! Um so besser! Also los?«,"""So? … easy? Fine! All the better! Let's go?""","“Oh … simple, is it? Good. All the better. Go on, then.”","‘Oh, I see ... simple, is it? Good! So much the better! Get on with it then.’"
"»Ja, aber …«, stammle ich in den Apparat hinein. Doch es kommt keine Antwort mehr. Ich horche noch ein paar Sekunden. Nein, keine Antwort. Sie hat abgehängt. Merkwürdig – warum hat sie so eilig das Gespräch abgebrochen? So rasch, als fürchte sie, weiter gefragt zu werden. Das muß etwas zu bedeuten haben … Und warum überhaupt verschieben? Warum die Abreise verschieben, es war doch alles genau auf den Tag bestimmt? Acht Tage, hat Condor gesagt. Acht Tage, ich habe mich innerlich schon völlig darauf eingestellt und soll jetzt wieder … unmöglich … das ist doch unmöglich … das halt ich nicht aus, dieses ewige Auf und Ab … man hat doch auch seine Nerven … Ich muß schließlich einmal zu meiner Ruhe kommen …","""Yes, but..."" I stammer into the machine. But there is no more answer. I listen for a few more seconds. No, no answer. She hung up. Strange - why did she break off the conversation in such a hurry? So quickly, as if she were afraid of being questioned again. That must mean something... And why postpone it at all? Why postpone your departure, everything was scheduled exactly for that day? Eight days, Condor said. Eight days, I've completely adjusted to it internally and now I'm supposed to... impossible... that's impossible... I can't stand it, this constant ups and downs... one has his nerves... I finally have to find some peace and quiet ...","“Yes, but … ” I stammer into the receiver. However, there is no answer. I listen for a few more seconds, still no answer. She has hung up. Odd —why was she in such a hurry to end the call? It was as if she were afraid of being asked more questions. That must mean something … and why put off the trip? It was all arranged down to the very day. A week hence, Condor said. A week, I have prepared my mind well for that, and now am I to … no, impossible , this is impossible. I can’t stand this constant chopping and changing … I have my own nerves to think of. I must get some rest sometime, after all.","‘Yes, but ...’ I stammered into the receiver. But there was no further answer. I went on listening for a moment or two. No, there was no answer. She had rung off. Odd — why had she broken off the conversation in such a hurry — as though she were afraid of being questioned any further? There must be something behind it all. And why put off the journey? The date had been settled. A week, Condor had said. A week — I’d completely adapted myself to the idea, and now I should have to ... Impossible ... it was impossible! I couldn’t stand this eternal shilly-shallying ... After all, I had nerves too ... I must be left in peace some time ..."
"Und da ich nicht gehorchte, da ich versuchte, sie gewaltsam vom Geländer abzudrängen, warf sie plötzlich den Oberkörper herum und gab mir mitten in die Brust einen Stoß. Und nun geschah das Entsetzliche. Mit diesem Stoß verlor sie den Stützpunkt und damit das Gleichgewicht. Wie von einer Sense durchschnitten, gaben die lockeren Knie völlig nach. Mit einem Ruck sackte sie in sich zusammen, und dadurch, daß sie sich im Hinstürzen an dem Tisch festhalten wollte, riß ihr Fall die ganze Platte mit. Über sie und mich, der ich im letzten Augenblick die ungelenk Hintaumelnde noch aufzufangen suchte, klirrte jetzt zerbrechend die Vase, schmetterten die Teller und Tassen, rasselten die Löffel; laut schlug die große bronzene Glocke zu Boden und rollte mit lärmendem Klöppel die ganze Terrasse entlang.","And when I didn't obey, when I tried to force her off the railing, she suddenly threw her upper body around and punched me in the middle of the chest. And now the terrible thing happened. With this push, she lost her footing and thus her balance. As if severed by a scythe, the loose knees buckled completely. She collapsed with a jerk, and because she wanted to hold on to the table as she fell, her fall swept the whole slab with her. Above her and me, who at the last moment tried to catch the awkwardly staggering woman, the vase rattled, breaking, the plates and cups smashed, the spoons rattled; the great bronze bell banged loudly to the ground and rolled along the whole terrace with a noisy clapper.","And when I did not obey, but tried to force her away from the balustrade, she suddenly swung her upper body round and hit me hard in the chest. As she struck me, she lost her hold and with it her balance. Her knees gave way entirely, as if a scythe had cut through them, and she collapsed. She instinctively tried to grab hold of the table as she fell, and brought the whole thing down. As I tried to catch her at the last minute in her ungainly fall, I heard the vase clinking as it broke, cups and plates smashed, spoons rattled to the ground and so, with a clang, the big bronze bell. It rolled along the terrace with its clapper still striking.","And since I refused to obey her, but tried to drag her away from the balustrade by force, she swung round with the upper part of her body and struck me a blow in the chest. And then a really ghastly thing happened. In striking out she lost her hold on the balustrade and with it her balance. Her knees gave completely, as though mown through by a scythe, and although I put my arms out to save her, I was too late. With a convulsive jerk she collapsed, bringing down with her the table that she had vainly endeavoured to clutch. Vase, plates and cups, spoons, all came smashing, clattering, rattling down upon us; the great bronze bell fell with a loud crash to the ground and, its clapper jangling, rolled the whole length of the terrace."
"»Lieber Freund, Sie machen’s einem wirklich schwer. Jede Sorge ist überflüssig, nochmals mein Wort, mein Ehrenwort. Wenn etwas Ernstliches vorläge, würde ich doch nicht vor einem Fremden … pardon, Herr Leutnant, ich meine es nicht unfreundlich, ich meine nur … dann würde ich doch nicht so vom Fauteuil aus sprechen und dabei so behaglich von Ihrem guten Kognak – es ist wirklich ein ausgezeichneter Kognak – trinken.«","""Dear friend, you make it really difficult. Every concern is superfluous, again my word, my word of honour. If there was something serious I wouldn't do in front of a stranger... excuse me, Herr Lieutenant, I don't mean it unkindly, I just mean... then I wouldn't speak so comfortably from the armchair and at the same time of your good cognac - it's real an excellent cognac - drink it.""","“My dear friend, you really do make it hard for me. There’s nothing for you to worry about, I give you my word on that again, my word of honour. If there were the prospect of anything serious, you surely don’t think I’d say so in front of a stranger … forgive me, Lieutenant Hofmiller, I don’t mean to be unfriendly, it’s just that … well, I wouldn’t talk about it from this chair while drinking your good cognac, my friend, and it really is excellent.”","‘My dear friend, you really make things very difficult for me. There’s absolutely no need to worry, you have my word again for it, my word of honour. If it were anything serious I wouldn’t, you may be sure ... in front of a stranger ... I beg your pardon, Herr Leutnant , I don’t mean it unkindly, I only mean ... I wouldn’t discuss it from an arm-chair, so to speak, while comfortably sipping your good brandy — by the way, it really is excellent brandy.’"
"Wieder krx … krx … Es schaltet im Apparat, es knarrt, es knackst, es gluckst, es gurgelt. Es saust und schwingt und dann, in allmählicher Abschwächung, wieder nur das feine Surren und Summen der Drähte. Plötzlich eine Stimme, harter barscher Baß:","Again krx ... krx ... The apparatus switches, it creaks, it crackles, it gurgles, it gurgles. It whizzes and vibrates and then, gradually fading away, just the subtle whirring and humming of the wires. Suddenly a voice, hard harsh bass:","More sounds on the line. A switching sound on the phone, a growling, crackling and gurgling. Then rushing, roaring noises, and as they gradually die away only the faint humming and surging on the wires again. Suddenly there’s a voice, a harsh, growling bass.","Again that krrx, krrx. Then the line was changed again, and there was a squeaking, a clicking, a clucking, a gurgling, followed by a roaring and a whistling, which gradually died away into the faint humming and singing of the wires. Suddenly a voice, a harsh raucous bass:"
Jetzt ertrage ich es nicht mehr. Ich drehe die Kurbel und frage die Telephonistin:,Now I can't take it anymore. I turn the crank and ask the operator:,Now I can’t stand it any more. I turn the handle of the telephone and get the operator on the line.,"And now I could bear it no longer. I turned the handle and asked the operator, ‘Hasn’t my call come through yet?’"
"»Das ist famos, Ilona, daß ich Sie einmal in der Stadt erwische. Das hab ich mir schon lang gewünscht, einmal mit Ihnen spazierenzugehen in unserer Residenz. Oder wollen wir lieber noch auf einen Sprung hinein in die wohlbekannte Konditorei?«","'It's great, Ilona, that I've caught you in town for once. I've wanted that for a long time, to take a walk with you in our residence. Or would we rather just pop into the well-known pastry shop?”","“How splendid to meet you here for once, Ilona. I’ve been wishing for some time that I could walk around this town where we’re stationed with you. Or would you rather go into the cake shop we both know so well?”","‘This is capital, Ilona, meeting you in the town like this. I’ve so often wanted to take you for a walk round our august city. Or shall we go to the old pâtisserie, and sit there for a while?’"
"Es ist Ferencz, der in mein Zimmer hereingestürmt ist. Ich habe ihn gar nicht bemerkt, ehe er mir mit seiner schweren Pratze brüderlich auf die Schulter haut. Im ersten Augenblick verstehe ich nichts. Der Oberst? Herübergeschickt? Balinkay? Ach so, ach so, erinnere ich mich: der Empfangsabend für Balinkay! Hastig greife ich nach Hose und Rock, und mit der in der Kadettenschule eingelernten Geschwindigkeit reiße ich alles mechanisch an mich, ohne recht zu wissen, wie ich’s mache. Ferencz schaut mir merkwürdig zu:","It's Ferencz who burst into my room. I didn't even notice him until he smacked my shoulder brotherly with his heavy claw. At first I don't understand anything. The colonel? Sent over? Balinkay? Oh, oh, I remember: the reception evening for Balinkay! I grab my trousers and skirt hastily, and mechanically grab everything with the speed learned in cadet school, without quite knowing how I'm doing it. Ferencz looks at me strangely:","This is Ferencz, bursting into my room. I don’t even notice him until he brings his heavy paw down on my shoulder in fraternal fashion. At first I can’t take in any of what he’s saying. The Colonel? Ferdl sent Ferencz over? Balinkay? Oh yes, now I remember, Balinkay’s convivial evening! I swiftly snatch up my trousers and coat, and with the speed I learnt at military academy fling them on automatically, without really being aware what I’m doing. Ferencz gives me an odd look.","It was Ferencz who had burst into my room. I had not noticed his presence until he gave me a hearty slap on the back with his heavy paw. At first I couldn’t take in what he was saying. The Colonel? Ferdl had sent him over? Balinkay? Ah yes, ah yes, I remembered now: the dinner in honour of Balinkay! Hastily I reached for my trousers and tunic, and with a speed acquired after years at the cadet school, I mechanically threw on my clothes, without really knowing what I was doing. ‘What’s up with you?’ asked Ferencz, looking at me oddly."
"Ich überlegte. »Am besten die ›Tiroler Weinstube‹ in der Erzherzog Friedrich-Straße. Die hat kleine Logen, in denen man ganz ungestört bleibt.«",I considered. »The best is the ›Tiroler Weinstube‹ on Erzherzog Friedrich-Strasse. They have small boxes where you can remain completely undisturbed.«,"I thought about it. “I’d suggest the Tyrolean Wine Bar in Erzherzog Friedrichstrasse. It has little private boxes, like the boxes in a theatre, where we wouldn’t be disturbed.” “Excellent!",I reflected. ‘The best place of all would be the Tiroler Weinstube in the Erzherzog Friedrichstrasse. It has little alcoves where one is left undisturbed.’ ‘Splendid!
"Aber nichts … nichts. Nur ein fernes Singen und Surren … sfff … sff …srrr, wie metallene Moskitoflügel. »Hallo, hallo«, schreie ich und warte, warte. Keine Antwort. Nur das höhnische sinnlose Summen. Fröstelt mich so, weil ich nichts anhabe außer dem übergeschlagenen Mantel, oder macht das die jähe Angst? Vielleicht ist die Sache doch aufgeflogen. Oder vielleicht … ich warte, ich horche, den heißen Kautschukring eng ans Ohr gepreßt. Endlich krx … krx … eine Umschaltung und die Stimme des Telephonfräuleins:","But nothing... nothing. Just a distant singing and whirring...sfff...sff...srrr, like metal mosquito wings. ""Hello, hello,"" I shout and wait, wait. No Answer. Just the taunting senseless buzzing. Does it chill me because I'm not wearing anything but the coat I've thrown over my head, or does that suddenly scare me? Perhaps the matter has blown up after all. Or maybe . . . I wait, I listen, the hot rubber ring pressed tight to my ear. Finally krx... krx... a switch and the voice of the operator:","Nothing. Nothing but a distant surging, humming sound … sssf, sssf, sssf, like metallic mosquito wings far away. “Hello, hello,” I shout, and I wait and wait. No answer. Only that mocking, pointless humming.

Or perhaps … I wait, I listen with the hot rubber ring of the receiver held tight to my ear. At last there is a clicking. I am on another line. I hear the voice of the switchboard operator.","But I could hear nothing ... nothing. Nothing but a distant buzzing and humming ... bzz ... bzz ... brrr, a metallic droning as of mosquitoes’ wings. ‘ Hallo, hallo!’ I shouted, and waited, waited. No reply. Nothing but that contemptuous, meaningless buzz. Was I shivering because I had nothing on over my shirt but my great-coat, or was it sudden fear that was making my teeth chatter? Perhaps there had been a crisis. Or perhaps ... I waited, I listened, the hot rubber ring pressed close up against my ear. At last — krrx, krrx — the line was changed, and I could hear the voice of the operator:"
"Das war die unselige Tölpelei, mit der die ganze Sache begann. Jetzt, da ich mir beschwichtigten Bluts und aus der Distanz vieler Jahre jene einfältige Episode neuerdings vergegenwärtige, mit der alles Verhängnis seinen Anfang nahm, muß ich mir zuerkennen, eigentlich ganz unschuldig in dieses Mißverständnis hineingestolpert zu sein; auch dem Klügsten, dem Erfahrensten hätte diese »gaffe« passieren können, ein lahmes Mädchen zum Tanz aufzufordern. Aber in der Unmittelbarkeit des ersten Entsetzens empfand ich mich damals nicht nur als heillosen Tölpel, sondern als Rohling, als Verbrecher. Mir war, als hätte ich ein unschuldiges Kind mit der Peitsche geschlagen. All dies hätte schließlich mit Geistesgegenwart noch gutgemacht werden können; unwiderruflich hatte ich erst damit die Situation verdorben – dies wurde mir sofort bewußt, kaum daß der erste Stoß kalter Luft mir vor dem Hause an die Stirne sprang –, daß ich eben wie ein Verbrecher, ohne den Versuch, mich zu entschuldigen, einfach weggelaufen war.","That was the unfortunate blundering that started it all. Now that, calmed down and from the distance of many years, I am recalling that silly episode with which all fate began, I have to admit that I actually quite innocently stumbled into this misunderstanding; Even the cleverest, the most experienced could have had this ""gaffe"" of asking a lame girl to dance. But in the immediacy of the first horror I felt at the time not only as a hopeless oaf, but also as a brute, a criminal. I felt as if I had whipped an innocent child. All of this could eventually have been made good with presence of mind; I had irrevocably spoiled the situation - I realized this as soon as the first gust of cold air hit my forehead in front of the house - by just running away like a criminal, without trying to apologize .","That was the unfortunate act of folly with which the whole story began. Today, with my blood less agitated and after an interval of many years, when I conjure up the memory of the stupid incident that set everything else in motion I cannot help seeing that I stumbled into this misunderstanding entirely innocently. Even the cleverest and most experienced of men could have committed the faux pas of asking a lame girl to dance. But at the time, under the immediate impression of those first horrified reactions, I seemed to myself not just a hopeless fool but a villain, a criminal. I felt as if I had whipped an innocent child. With a little presence of mind, after all, the entire misunderstanding could have been cleared up. But I realised, as soon as the first gust of cold air blew in my face outside the house, that by simply running away like a thief in the night, without even trying to apologise, I had made it impossible to retrieve the situation.","This was the ill-fated blunder which started the whole thing. Now, when in cold blood and at a distance of many years I look back on the simple incident which gave rise to the whole catastrophic chain of events, I must, in justice to myself, affirm that I blundered entirely innocently into the unfortunate error; even the cleverest and most sophisticated of mortals might have committed the gaffe of asking a crippled girl to dance with him. But in the first rush of horror I thought of myself not merely as an arrant bungler, but as a cad, a criminal. I felt as though I had struck an innocent child with a whip. The whole thing could, after all, have been put right with a little presence of mind; it was only by rushing away then and there like a criminal, without making any attempt to apologize — no sooner had I felt the first breath of cold air on my face outside the front door than this was immediately obvious to me — that I had irrevocably made a mess of the whole thing."
"Zu jeder anderen Zeit hätte mich die Gelegenheit, diesem viel Gerühmten zu begegnen, ehrlich gefreut. Aber der Gedanke an Lustigkeit, lautes Hallo, Toaste und Tafelreden schien meiner Verstörtheit so ziemlich das Unerträglichste auf Erden. So versuchte ich, schleunigst abzurücken: ich fühlte mich nicht recht auf dem Damm. Jedoch mit einem drastischen »Ausgeschlossen! Heut gibt’s kein Abpaschen«, hatte mich Ferencz schon unter den Arm gefaßt, und ich mußte widerwillig nachgeben. Verworren hörte ich ihn, während sie mich weiterzogen, erzählen, wie und wem Balinkay schon aus der Schlamastik geholfen, daß er sofort seinem Schwager eine Stellung verschafft habe und ob unsereins nicht geschwinder Karriere machen könnte, ginge man auf ein Schiff zu ihm oder nach Indien hinüber. Joszi, dieser hagere, verbissene Bursche, tropfte ab und zu Essig in des braven Ferencz dankbare Begeisterung. Ob der Oberst sein »Herzpinkerl« derart liebevoll empfangen würde, spottete er, wenn Balinkay nicht diesen dicken holländischen Schellfisch eingefangen hätte; zwölf Jahre soll sie übrigens älter sein als er, und: »Wenn man sich schon verkauft, soll man sich wenigstens teuer verkaufen«, lachte Graf Steinhübel.","At any other time I would have genuinely enjoyed the opportunity to meet this much-vaunted man. But the thought of merriment, loud hellos, toasts and table talks seemed to my confusion about the most unbearable thing on earth. So I tried to move away as quickly as possible: I didn't feel right on the dam. But with a drastic »Out of the question! There's no scrapping today,' Ferencz had already grabbed my arm, and I had to give in reluctantly. While they were pulling me on, I heard him confusedly explain how and who Balinkay had already helped out of the sloppy state, that he immediately got his brother-in-law a job and whether we couldn't have a faster career if we went on a ship to his place or to India over. Joszi, this gaunt, dogged fellow, now and then dripped vinegar in the good Ferencz's grateful enthusiasm. He scoffed at whether the Colonel would have received his ""heart pee"" so lovingly if Balinkay hadn't caught that fat Dutch haddock; Incidentally, she is said to be twelve years older than him, and: ""If you sell yourself, you should at least sell yourself dearly,"" laughed Count Steinhübel.","At any other time I would have been genuinely pleased to have the chance of meeting this legendary figure. But just now, in my present dismay, the thought of amusement, loud noise, toasts and speeches seemed to me the most unbearable thing on earth. So I tried to get out of it as quickly as possible, saying that I didn’t feel too well. But with a hearty “Nonsense! No excuses today!” Ferencz had taken my arm, and against my will I had to give way. I listened to him, my mind still elsewhere, as he led me on, telling me about the people Balinkay had already helped out of trouble, saying that he had found his, Ferencz’s, brother-in-law a job at once, and wondering aloud whether we might not make our fortunes faster by boarding a ship and going off to his properties in the East Indies. From time to time our lanky, grizzled friend Jozsi added a sharper note to tone down Ferencz’s enthusiasm. Would the Colonel so happily welcome his blue-eyed boy back, he mocked, if Balinkay hadn’t hooked his nice fat Dutch trout? She was said to be twelve years his senior, and: “If you’re going to sell yourself,” laughed Count Steinhübel, “you should at least make sure the price is right.”","At any other time I should have been genuinely overjoyed at the opportunity of meeting this celebrity. But the thought of a binge with all the attendant rowdiness and toasts and after-dinner speeches seemed to me, in my overwrought state, about the most intolerable thing on earth. I tried, therefore, to get out of it, saying that I did not feel quite up to the mark. Ferencz, however, promptly seized me by the arm with a flat ‘Nonsense! No slinking off for you today, my lad!’ and I had no option but to yield. They dragged me along and I listened in a daze as he told stories of people whom Balinkay had got out of a hole, and how he had found a job for his brother-in-law; and if any member of the regiment, he said, was unable to get promotion quickly enough, he simply took the next boat to Alexandria or to the Dutch Indies, where Balinkay was entirely at his service. That lean, morose fellow Jozsi punctuated good old Ferencz’s hymn of grateful praise with an occasional acid comment. Would the Colonel receive his ‘blue-eyed boy’ so cordially, he jeered, if Balinkay had not hooked that fat Dutch shell-fish? Incidentally, she was said to be twelve years older than he. ‘If you’re going to sell yourself, you should at least get a good price!’ laughed Count Steinhübel."
"›Ja, sehr schön‹, bestätigt sie gehorsam, aber die Zustimmung klingt nicht ganz echt. Kanitz spürt sofort, die Verschüchterte hat es verlernt, offen zu widersprechen, und erst nach einer Weile fügt sie berichtigend bei:","'Yes, very nice,' she confirms obediently, but the agreement doesn't sound quite genuine. Kanitz senses immediately that the intimidated woman has forgotten how to openly contradict, and only after a while does she add:","“‘Yes, lovely,’ she obediently agrees, but something about the way she echoes him doesn’t sound whole-hearted. Kanitz senses at once that, intimidated as she has been, she has forgotten how to disagree with anyone frankly, and only after a while does she add, by way of explanation, ‘Of course the Princess never felt quite at her ease here.","‘Yes, very nice,’ she agreed submissively, but there was no real conviction in her tone. Kanitz realized at once that this scared creature had forgotten, if she ever knew, how to contradict flatly and only now did she add by way of amendment:"

What else could I do but hang those great weights on the child, as one puts shackles on the feet of a refractory prisoner?

"Ich hatte angespannt zugehört; mir war alles klar, was er meinte. Aber unbewußt war die Insistenz, die Angst des alten Mannes in mich übergegangen. Ich wollte noch mehr hören, Bestimmteres, Präziseres. So fragte ich weiter:","I had been listening intently; I knew everything he meant. But unconsciously the old man's insistence, his fear, had passed over me. I wanted to hear more, more definite, more precise. So I asked further:","I had been listening intently.

"Selbstverständlich mußten sofort einige der minder noblen Verwandten von der Ehrenestrade abrücken, um uns Platz zu machen, und ein sichtliches Staunen über die Leutseligkeit der hohen Herrschaften hob an, als wir uns ohne jede Befangenheit unter die biederen Leutchen mischten. Vor Aufregung schwankend, holte der Brautvater eigenhändig einen mächtigen Krug Wein, füllte die Gläser und erhob die Stimme laut zu dem Ruf: »Auf das Wohl des gnädigen Herrn«, der sofort in begeistertem Echo bis weit hinaus auf die Gasse dröhnte. Dann schleppte er seinen Sohn und dessen neue Ehehälfte heran, ein scheues, etwas breithüftiges Mädchen, dem die festlich bunte Tracht und der weiße Myrtenkranz ein rührendes Aussehen verliehen; feuerrot vor Aufregung und ungeschickt knickste sie vor Kekesfalva, respektvoll küßte sie Edith die Hand, die mit einmal sichtlich erregt wurde. Jedesmal wirkt ja auf junge Mädchen der Anblick einer Hochzeitszeremonie verwirrend, weil in diesem Augenblick eine geheimnisvolle Solidarität des Geschlechts sich der Seele bemächtigt. Errötend zog Edith das demütige Mädchen an sich, umarmte sie und nahm dann, sich plötzlich besinnend, einen Ring – es war ein schmaler altväterlicher, nicht sehr kostbarer Ring – vom Finger und steckte ihn der Braut an, die ihrerseits durch diese unvermutete Gabe völlig entgeistert war. Verängstigt blickte sie auf den Schwiegervater, ob sie ein derart großes Geschenk auch wirklich annehmen dürfe. Kaum daß dieser stolz zustimmend nickte, brach sie vor lauter Beglückung in Tränen aus. Neuerdings flutete eine begeisterte Welle von Dankbarkeit uns entgegen; von allen Seiten drängten die schlichten und gar nicht verwöhnten Leute herzu; man merkte ihren Blicken deutlich an, daß sie gern etwas Besonderes getan hätten, um uns ihre Erkenntlichkeit zu zeigen, aber keiner wagte es, an so hohe »Herrschaften« auch nur ein Wort zu richten. Zwischen ihnen stolperte die alte Bäuerin mit Tränen in den Augen wie eine Trunkene von einem zum andern, ganz geblendet von der Ehre, die der Hochzeit des Sohnes widerfahren war, indes der Bräutigam in seiner Befangenheit abwechselnd auf seine Braut, auf uns und auf seine schweren blitzenden Röhrenstiefel glotzte.","Of course, some of the less noble relatives had to move away from the honorary dais to make room for us, and there was obvious astonishment at the affability of the high gentlemen when we mingled with the staid people without any embarrassment. Swaying with excitement, the bride's father fetched a large jug of wine with his own hands, filled the glasses and raised his voice loudly to the call: ""To the good of the gracious gentleman,"" which immediately rang out in enthusiastic echo far out into the street. Then he dragged his son and his new wife over, a shy, somewhat broad-hipped girl who looked touching in her colorful festive costume and white myrtle wreath; fiery red with excitement and awkwardly, she curtsied to Kekesfalva, respectfully kissing Edith's hand, which suddenly became visibly agitated. The sight of a wedding ceremony always has a confusing effect on young girls, because at this moment a mysterious solidarity of the sexes takes possession of the soul. Blushing, Edith pulled the humble girl to her side, hugged her and then, suddenly thinking, took a ring from her finger - it was a narrow, old-fashioned, not very valuable ring - and put it on the bride, who was completely taken aback by this unexpected gift was. Frightened, she looked at her father-in-law to see if she was really allowed to accept such a large gift. No sooner had he proudly nodded in agreement than she burst into tears from sheer happiness. Lately an enthusiastic wave of gratitude has swept over us; the simple and not at all spoiled people crowded in from all sides; You could clearly tell from their looks that they would have liked to do something special to show us their gratitude, but no one dared to address even a word to such high ""lords"". Between them the old peasant woman, with tears in her eyes, stumbled from one to the other like a drunk, completely dazzled by the honor of the son's wedding, while the bridegroom, in his embarrassment, alternately fell on his bride, on us and on his heavy gleaming tube boots.","Some of the less important family members were asked to move from the table of honour to make room for us, and amazement at the friendliness of their fine visitors was plain to see on the guests’ faces as we mingled easily with the ordinary country folk. The bridegroom’s father, swaying with his excitement, fetched a large jug of wine with his own hands, filled glasses, and raised his voice: “Herr von Kekesfalva’s very good health!” The enthusiastic echo of this cry rang out into the village street. Then he brought along his son and the son’s new wife, a shy girl with rather broad hips who made a touching picture in her colourful wedding dress, crowned with a wreath of white myrtle. Flushed with excitement, she curtseyed clumsily to Kekesfalva and respectfully kissed Edith’s hand. Edith looked very much moved. The sight of a wedding usually affects young girls deeply because it makes them feel a mysterious solidarity with their own sex. Blushing, Edith drew the girl to her, embraced her, and as a sudden thought occurred to her she took a ring from her finger—a narrow, old-fashioned ring of no great value—and gave it to the bride, who was overwhelmed by this unexpected present. She glanced anxiously at her father-in-law, wondering if she ought to accept such a splendid gift, and as soon as he nodded proudly to her she burst into tears of happiness. A great wave of gratitude surged towards us as the simple folk, unused to any luxury, crowded up from all sides; it was clear from their glances that they would have liked to show us some special attention, but no one dared say a word to such distinguished gentlefolk. The old farmer’s wife, tears in her eyes, was stumbling as if tipsy from one guest to another, dazed by the honour shown to her son at his wedding, while the bridegroom, quite bewildered, looked in turn from his wife to us and down at his heavy, well-polished boots.","Some of the less exalted relatives were obliged to move from the table of honour to make room for us, and they were all visibly astonished at the condescension of the grand ladies and gentlemen who mingled without a trace of embarrassment with the worthy villagers. Reeling with excitement, the bridegroom’s father himself fetched an enormous pitcher of wine, filled up the glasses and raised his voice in a toast ‘To the health of the noble gentleman!’ which was echoed enthusiastically in a shout that could be heard in the street. Then he dragged forward his son and the bride, a shy, somewhat broad-hipped young woman, who looked very touching in her gay, festive costume and white myrtle wreath. Crimson with confusion, she curtsied awkwardly to Kekesfalva, and respectfully kissed Edith’s hand. Edith was visibly agitated, for the sight of a wedding always has a disturbing effect on young girls; at such moments a mysterious sense of solidarity with their own sex takes possession of them. Blushing, Edith pulled the bashful young bride to her and embraced her; then, struck by a sudden thought, she took a ring from her finger — a slender, old-fashioned, not very costly ring — and gave it to the bride, who was utterly taken aback by this unlooked-for gift. She looked up anxiously at her father-in-law, as though to ask if she should really accept such a grand present, and no sooner had he proudly nodded his consent than she burst into tears of sheer joy. Once more we were engulfed in a wave of enthusiastic gratitude. From all sides the simple, unsophisticated folk thronged around us; we could tell from their expressions that they longed to show us some special mark of recognition but that no one dared even to address a word to the ‘grand gentry’. The old peasant-woman, the bridegroom’s mother, staggered like a drunkard from one to another with tears in her eyes, utterly dazed by the honour that had been accorded her son’s wedding, while the bridegroom in his embarrassment kept goggling first at his bride, then at us, and then at his heavy, polished top-boots."
»Verändert … wie meinen Sie … wieso verändert?«,"""Changed... what do you mean... changed why?""",“Different? What do you mean? Different in what way?”,‘A change ... what do you mean ... what kind of a change?’
"Condor hatte richtig gesehen. Das lang schon den Nerven fühlbare Gewitter war unverkennbar im Anrücken. Polternd wie schwere, schwarze Kisten schoben sich dicke Wolken über den unruhig zitternden Baumkronen zusammen, manchmal vom Funkenstrich eines Wetterleuchtens bleich überhellt. Brandig schmeckte die feuchte und hin und wieder ruckhaft von böigen Windstößen aufgerüttelte Luft. Anders erschien die Stadt, anders wirkten die Straßen bei meinem raschen Rücklauf als vor wenigen Minuten, da sie noch angehaltenen Atems im bleichen Mondlicht gelegen. Nun klirrten und klapperten die Schilder wie geängstigt von einem drückenden Traum, unruhig polterten die Türen, stöhnten die Rauchfänge, in manchen Häusern erwachte neugieriges Licht, und dann sah man hier und dort einen Weißbehemdeten vorsorglich die Fenster vor dem kommenden Unwetter schließen. Die wenigen verspäteten Passanten jagten hastig, wie von einem Angstwind getrieben, an den Ecken vorbei, selbst der weiträumige Hauptplatz, sonst auch zur Nachtzeit einigermaßen belebt, lag völlig verlassen; mit dummem, weißem Blick glotzte die beleuchtete Rathausuhr in die ungewohnte Leere. Hauptsache aber: ich vermochte dank Condors Warnung rechtzeitig heimzukommen, ehe das Gewitter anhub. Nur zwei Straßenecken noch und quer durch den städtischen Vorgarten zur Kaserne; dann konnte ich in meinem Zimmer all das Überraschende zu Ende denken, das ich in den letzten paar Stunden erfahren und erlebt.","Condor had seen correctly. The thunderstorm, which had been felt for a long time, was unmistakably approaching. Thick clouds rumbled like heavy, black boxes over the restlessly trembling treetops, sometimes palely illuminated by the sparks of sheet lightning. The damp air, now and then jerkily agitated by gusty gusts of wind, tasted burnt. The city appeared different, the streets looked different as I walked back quickly from a few minutes ago, when they were still holding their breath in the pale moonlight. Now the signs rattled and rattled as if frightened by an oppressive dream, the doors rattled restlessly, the chimneys groaned, in some houses curious lights awoke, and then here and there one saw a white-shirted man closing the windows as a precaution against the coming storm. The few late passers-by hurried past the corners, as if driven by a fearful wind. Even the spacious main square, which was otherwise fairly busy even at night, was completely deserted; the illuminated town hall clock stared blankly into the unfamiliar emptiness. But the main thing was that, thanks to Condor's warning, I was able to get home in time before the storm started. Only two more street corners and straight through the city's front garden to the barracks; then, in my room, I could think through all the surprising things I had experienced and witnessed over the past few hours.","Condor had been right. The thunderstorm that we had felt coming for some time was unmistakably close now. Thick clouds crowded the sky almost audibly; they looked like heavy black crates crashing together above the restlessly tossing crowns of the trees, and the scene was sometimes brightly lit up by a zigzag streak of lightning. The moist air, violently shaken from time to time by gusts of wind, carried the smell of burning on it. The town itself looked different, and as I quickly walked back even the streets did not seem the same as they had been a few minutes earlier, when they still lay with bated breath in the pale moonlight. Now shop signs were rattling and banging, as if woken in alarm by a bad dream, doors slammed, the cowls of chimney pots creaked, lights came on in many houses as figures in white nightshirts got up to see what was going on, and carefully closed their windows against the coming storm. The few late passers by hurried from one street corner to the next as if blown on a wind of fear, the large main square, where there were usually a few people out and about even at night, was entirely deserted, and the illuminated town-hall clock gaped at the unaccustomed void with a foolish, white gaze. But thanks to Condor’s advice, I would be home before the storm really broke. Only two more streets, then through the garden in front of the barracks, and I would be in my own room, where I could think over all the surprising information that I had learnt in the last few hours.","Condor had been right in his prediction. The storm which had long been perceptible to our senses was unmistakably approaching. Great clouds seemed to clatter against one another like heavy black chests above the tremulous, quivering tree-tops, which were lit every now and then by pale darting tongues of lightning. There was an acrid smell in the damp air, which was tossed hither and thither by squally gusts. The town seemed quite changed, the streets were quite different, as I now hurried home. A few minutes before they had lain with bated breath in the pale moonlight; now the street signs clanked and clattered as though startled out of an oppressive dream, doors rattled uneasily, chimney-pots groaned, in some of the houses inquisitive lights were turned on, and here and there white-clad figures could be seen cautiously shutting the windows against the approaching storm. The few belated passers-by scurried from street-corner to street-corner as though driven along by the very breath of fear. Even the big main square, where at night a fair number of people were usually to be seen, lay completely deserted; the illuminated town-hall clock goggled stupidly and blankly down upon the unwonted emptiness. The main thing was that, thanks to Condor’s warning, I should get home before the storm broke. Only two more streets, and then across the municipal park to the barracks. Once in my room, I could ponder over all the astonishing things that I had heard and experienced in the last few hours."
"Was noch? Richtig: die beiden Briefe von Edith verbrennen, überhaupt alle Briefe und Photographien! Nichts von sich zurücklassen, keine Erinnerung, keine Spur. Möglichst unauffällig verschwinden, wie man unauffällig gelebt hat. Immerhin, das gibt reichlich Arbeit für zwei, drei Stunden, denn jeder Brief soll sauber geschrieben sein, damit mir niemand Angst oder Verwirrtheit nachsagen kann. Dann das Letzte, das Leichteste: sich ins Bett legen, zwei, drei Decken dicht über den Kopf ziehen und darüber noch das schwere Federbett, damit man nebenan oder auf der Straße nichts von der Detonation des Schusses vernimmt – so hat’s seinerzeit der Rittmeister Felber gemacht. Um Mitternacht hat er sich erschossen, niemand hat auch nur einen Ton gehört; erst morgens haben sie ihn gefunden mit zerschmettertem Schädel. Unter den Decken dann den Lauf ganz nah an die Schläfe pressen, mein Revolver ist verläßlich, vorgestern habe ich zufällig den Verschluß noch frisch geölt. Und ich weiß, ich habe eine sichere Hand.","What else? That's right: burn Edith's two letters, and all the letters and photographs! Leave nothing behind, no memory, no trace. Disappear as inconspicuously as one lived inconspicuously. Anyway, that's plenty of work for two or three hours, because every letter should be neatly written so that nobody can accuse me of being scared or confused. Then the last thing, the easiest thing: lie down in bed, pull two or three blankets tightly over your head and put the heavy feather bed over it so that you don’t hear anything about the detonation of the shot next door or on the street – that’s how Rittmeister Felber did it at the time . At midnight he shot himself, no one heard a sound; They didn't find him until morning with his skull smashed. Under the blankets then press the barrel very close to my temple, my revolver is reliable, the day before yesterday I happened to freshly oil the slide. And I know I've got a sure hand.","What else? Oh yes, I remind myself I must burn Edith ’s two letters, and indeed all the letters and photographs in my possession. I want to leave nothing of myself behind, no memory, no trace. I hope to attract as little attention as possible in my death, just as I have lived without ever causing much of a stir. All the same, it adds up to a good deal of work for two or three hours, because every letter must be neatly written, so that no one can think afterwards that I had acted in fear or confusion. Then would come the last and easiest part—to lie down in bed, cover my head well with two or three blankets and the heavy quilt on top of them, so that no one in the next room or the street outside hears the detonation when I fire the shot —that was what Captain Felber had done once. He shot himself at midnight, and no one heard a sound. They didn’t find him with his skull shattered until morning. And then I must put the barrel of the gun against my temples under the bedclothes. My revolver is reliable; it so happens that I oiled the breechblock only yesterday. And I know I have a steady hand.","What else? Ah, of course, burn Edith ’s two letters , in fact all letters and photographs. Leave behind nothing of myself, no memory, no trace. Disappear, as I had lived, as inconspicuously as possible. All the same, there would be more than enough to do in the two or three hours left to me, for each letter must be carefully written so that no one should be able to attribute my action either to fear or an unbalanced mind. Then the last, the easiest, thing of all: lie down in bed, pull two or three blankets closely over my head and pile the heavy eiderdown on top of them so that the detonation should not be heard in the next room or in the street — that’s how Captain Felber had done it. He had shot himself at midnight, and no one had heard a sound; it was not until next morning that they had found him with his brains blown out. Then press the barrel right up against my temple underneath the blankets. I knew I could rely on my revolver, for I happened to have oiled the bolt quite recently, and I knew I had a steady hand."
"»Ja«, lachte Ilona, »keine Geheimnisse mehr!«","""Yes,"" laughed Ilona, ""no more secrets!""","“Yes, go along,” laughed Ilona. “No more secrets!”","‘Yes,’ laughed Ilona, ‘let’s have no more secrets.’"
"Ich mußte ganz laut geschrien haben, denn eisern fühlte ich Condors Finger um meinen Arm.","I must have screamed very loudly, because I felt Condor's fingers on my arm.","I must have been shouting, because I felt the iron grip of Condor’s fingers on my arm.","I must have shouted at the top of my voice, for I felt Condor seize my arm in an iron grip."
"Aber etwas Getanes hat immer Kraft. Nun, da das Abschiedsgesuch schon geschrieben war, wollte ich mich nicht mehr dementieren. Zum Teufel, sagte ich mir zornig, was geht’s mich an, ob die da draußen wartet und flennt! Sie haben mich genug geärgert, mich genug verwirrt. Was geht’s mich an, daß der eine fremde Mensch mich liebt? Sie wird mit ihren Millionen schon einen andern finden, und wenn nicht, es ist nicht meine Sache. Genug, daß ich alles hinhaue, daß ich mir die Uniform abreiße! Was geht mich diese ganze hysterische Angelegenheit an, ob sie gesund wird oder nicht? Ich bin doch kein Arzt …","But something done always has power. Now that the farewell letter had already been written, I didn't want to deny myself anymore. Hell, I said to myself angrily, what's it to me if she's waiting outside and crying! You've annoyed me enough, confused me enough. What is it to me that a stranger loves me? She'll find someone else with her millions, and if not, it's none of my business. Enough that I'll do everything, that I'll tear my uniform off! What do I have to do with this whole hysterical business, whether she gets well or not? I'm not a doctor...","However, something once done weighs heavily, and now that I had written my formal resignation I didn’t want to change my mind. Damn it all, I said angrily to myself, what’s it to me if she is waiting and weeping out there? They’ve given me enough trouble and caused me enough confusion. What’s it to me if a stranger loves me? With her millions, she’ll find someone else, and if she doesn’t it’s not my fault. Isn’t it enough for me to be throwing up my career and leaving the army? What business of mine are her hysterics and whether she gets better or not? I’m not a doctor …","But there is a certain finality about any act once it is carried out, and now that I had written my letter of resignation I did not want to go back on it. What the devil does it matter to me, I said angrily to myself, if she’s waiting and whining? They’ve worried me quite enough, upset me quite enough. What does it matter to me if some strange woman is in love with me? With all her millions she’ll soon find someone else, and if she doesn’t it’s not my business. It’s quite bad enough that I should have to chuck up everything, throw up my commission! What concern of mine is all this hysterical speculation as to whether she’s going to get well or not? Damn it, I’m not a doctor!"
"Am nächsten Morgen – ein blasser Nebel hängt noch über den Häusern, und die Fensterläden sind alle geschlossen, um den braven Schlaf der Bürger zu hüten, – reitet, wie jeden Morgen, unsere Eskadron auf das Exerzierfeld. In hottelndem Schritt geht es zuerst quer über das unbequeme Pflaster; noch ziemlich schlaftrunken, steif und verdrossen, schwanken meine Ulanen in ihren Sätteln. Bald haben wir die vier, fünf Gassen durchgetrottet, bereits auf der breiten Chaussee gehen wir über in einen leichten Trab und schwenken dann rechts ab gegen die offenen Wiesen. Ich kommandiere meinem Zug »Galopp«, und mit einem einzigen atmenden Stoß schnauben die anstürmenden Pferde los. Sie kennen schon das weiche, gute, weite Feld, die klugen Tiere; man muß sie weiter nicht antreiben, locker kann man die Zügel lassen, denn kaum daß sie den Schenkeldruck gespürt haben, legen die Gäule mit aller Kraft los. Auch sie fühlen die Lust der Erregung und der Entspannung.","The next morning - a pale fog still hangs over the houses and the shutters are all closed to protect the good sleep of the citizens - our squadron rides out onto the parade ground, as it does every morning. At first we walk across the uncomfortable pavement; still rather drowsy, stiff and sullen, my Uhlans sway in their saddles. Soon we have trotted through the four or five alleys, already on the wide chaussee we change to a light trot and then turn right towards the open meadows. I command my platoon to gallop, and with a single, breathing thud, the charging horses snort. You already know the soft, good, wide field, the clever animals; you don't have to push them further, you can let go of the reins, because no sooner have you felt the pressure on your thighs than the horses set off with all their might. They, too, feel the pleasure of excitement and relaxation.","Next morning—with a pale mist still hanging over the houses, and the shutters over the windows all closed so that good citizens can sleep soundly—our squadron rides out to the parade ground as it does every day. First we cross the cobblestones, uncomfortable going for the horses; at a brisk walking pace, my lancers, still drowsy from sleep, stiff and morose, sway in their saddles. Soon we have gone down the four or five streets to the broad main road, where we change pace to a light trot, and then we turn off right to the open meadows. I give my squadron the command “Gallop!” and away go the horses, snorting in unison. They know the soft, green, broad fields, clever animals; there is no need for us to urge them on now , we can hold the reins loosely, because as soon as they feel the pressure of their riders’ thighs the horses will be off as fast as they can go. They too feel the pleasure of excitement and physical relaxation.","The next morning — a pale mist still hung above the houses, and the windows were all shuttered to guard the good sleep of the townsfolk — our troop rode out, as on every morning, to the parade-ground. At first we ambled at a jog-trot over the uncomfortable cobble-stones; still somewhat drunk with sleep, stiff and sullen, my Uhlans swayed in their saddles. Soon we had ridden along the four or five streets of the little town; on reaching the broad high-road we broke into a gentle trot and turned off to the right across the open fields. ‘Gallop!’ I ordered my squadron, and at one breathless bound the snorting horses were off. They recognized at once the soft, springy turf, the clever beasts; there was no further need to urge them on, we could let the reins hang slackly, for scarcely had they felt the pressure of our legs than they were off like the wind. They too craved excitement and distraction."
"Unbekannte und zartere Zonen des Gefühls – aber freilich gefährlichere auch! Denn vergeblich die schonendste Bemühung: nie vermag die Beziehung zwischen einem Gesunden und einer Kranken, einem Freien und einer Gefangenen auf die Dauer völlig in reiner Schwebe zu bleiben. Unglück macht verletzbar und unablässiges Leiden ungerecht. Genau wie zwischen Gläubiger und Schuldner unausrottbar ein Peinliches beharrt, weil eben dem einen unabänderlich die Rolle des Gebenden und dem andern die des Empfangenden zugeteilt ist, so bleibt in dem Kranken eine heimliche Gereiztheit gegen jede sichtbare Besorgtheit ständig im Ansprung. Unablässig mußte man auf der Hut sein, nicht die kaum merkliche Grenze zu überschreiten, wo Anteilnahme, statt zu beschwichtigen, die leicht Verwundbare noch mehr verletzte; einerseits verlangte sie, verwöhnt wie sie war, daß alles sie bediente wie eine Prinzessin und verhätschelte wie ein Kind, aber schon im nächsten Augenblick konnte diese Rücksicht sie erbittern, weil sie ihr die eigene Hilflosigkeit deutlicher zum Bewußtsein brachte. Rückte man etwa das Taburett gefällig heran, um ihr den anstrengenden Handgriff nach Buch und Tasse möglichst zu ersparen, so herrschte sie einen blitzenden Auges an: »Glauben Sie, daß ich mir nicht selbst nehmen kann, was ich will?« Und wie ein eingegittertes Tier sich manchmal ohne jeden Anlaß gegen den sonst so umschmeichelten Wärter wirft, kam ab und zu eine boshafte Lust über die Gelähmte, unsere unbefangene Stimmung mit einem plötzlichen Prankenschlag zu zerfleischen, indem sie ganz unvermittelt von sich selbst als »einem elenden Krüppel« sprach. In solchen gespannten Augenblicken mußte man wirklich alle Kraft in sich zusammennehmen, um nicht ungerecht gegen ihren aggressiven Unmut zu werden.","Unknown and more delicate zones of feeling - but of course more dangerous ones too! For the gentlest effort is in vain: the relationship between a healthy person and a sick person, a free person and a prisoner can never remain completely in suspense in the long run. Unhappiness makes vulnerable and unremitting suffering unjust. Just as there is an ineradicable embarrassment between the creditor and the debtor, because one is invariably assigned the role of giver and the other that of receiver, so a secret irritability remains in the sick person against any visible anxiety. One had to be constantly on guard not to cross the imperceptible line where sympathy, instead of placating, wounded the vulnerable even more; on the one hand she demanded, spoiled as she was, that everyone wait on her like a princess and pamper her like a child, but the next moment this consideration could anger her because it made her more aware of her own helplessness. If you pulled the tabouret up to save her the strenuous grab for a book and a cup, she would snap at her with a sparkling eye: ""Do you think I can't take what I want for myself?"" And like a barred one animal sometimes throws itself at the otherwise flattered attendant for no reason at all, the paralyzed woman now and then had a malicious desire to lacerate our easygoing mood with a sudden swipe of her paw by speaking quite abruptly of herself as ""a miserable cripple."" In such tense moments one really had to gather all one's strength in order not to be unjust to her aggressive displeasure.","Unknown, tender areas of emotion—but dangerous all the same! For despite every effort, a relationship between a healthy man and a sick woman, the former free, the latter a prisoner, cannot stay in perfect equilibrium for ever. Unhappiness makes people vulnerable and constant suffering makes them unjust. In the same way as there is an ineradicable awkwardness between a creditor and a debtor, because one inevitably gives and the other takes, a sick person always nurtures a secret irritability and is ready to flare up at any visible sign of concern. I had to be always on my guard against crossing the barely perceptible line beyond which sympathy, instead of being soothing, injured the easily wounded girl even more. Spoilt as she was, she demanded on the one hand to be served like a princess and pampered like a child, but next moment such thought for her feelings could turn her bitter, because it made her even more clearly aware of her own helplessness. If you moved the stool closer to her, for instance, to spare her as far as possible the effort of reaching for her book or her cup, she might snap, with flashing eyes, “Do you think I can’t pick something up for myself if I want to?” And just as a caged animal will sometimes pounce on its usually kindly keeper for no apparent reason, now and then the lame girl was overcome by a malicious desire to wreck our carefree mood by showing her claws, suddenly calling herself a “poor wretched cripple”. At such tense moments I really had to summon up all my strength to avoid being unjust to her and her aggressive reaction.","Unknown and unsuspected tender zones of feeling — but also, it must be admitted, very dangerous ones! For, despite the most resolute efforts, it is never possible for a relationship between a healthy person and an invalid, a free person and a prisoner, to hang fire for ever. Unhappiness makes people vulnerable, incessant suffering unjust. Just as in the relations between creditor and debtor there is always an element of the disagreeable that can never be overcome, for the very reason that the one is irrevocably committed to the role of giver and the other to that of receiver, so in a sick person a latent feeling of resentment at every obvious sign of consideration is always ready to burst forth. One had constantly to be on one’s guard against overstepping the scarcely perceptible boundary beyond which sympathy, instead of soothing, only hurt her the more. On the one hand, pampered as she was, she demanded to be waited on by everyone like a princess and cosseted like a child; on the other hand this very consideration for her was likely to embitter her, since it made her more acutely aware of her own helplessness. If, for instance, one obligingly pushed the little stool nearer to her to spare her the effort of having to reach out for book or cup, she would flare up, her eyes flashing: ‘Do you imagine I can’t look after myself?’ Just as a caged animal sometimes, for no apparent reason, will attack the keeper whom it usually fawns upon, so from time to time she was seized with a malicious desire to shatter at one blow the serenity of the atmosphere by suddenly referring to herself as ‘a wretched cripple’. At such moments of tension one had to keep a tight hold on oneself in order not to upbraid her unfairly for her cantankerousness."
"»Unsinn«, knurre ich, um mir herauszuhelfen. Aber diese ausweichende Abwehr ist ihnen nicht genug; der gute Ferencz, ehrlich neugierig, schlägt mir auf die Schulter.","""Nonsense,"" I growl to help myself out. But this evasive defense is not enough for them; good Ferencz, honestly curious, slaps me on the shoulder.","“Nonsense,” I snap, trying to get myself out of it. But that evasive denial isn’t enough for them. My friend Ferencz, genuinely curious, slaps me on the back.","‘Nonsense!’ I growled, trying to get out of it. But this attempt to extricate myself was not enough for them. Ferencz, genuinely curious, patted me on the back."
"»Ich weiß«, sagte ich, »und ich dank dir schön.«","""I know,"" I said, ""and thank you.""","“I know,” I said, “and I really am most grateful.”","‘I know that,’ I said. ‘It’s damned good of you.’"
"Im ersten Aufstaunen glaubte ich mir selber nicht. Kekesfalva in unserem Kasernenpark – das war doch unmöglich, ich hatte ihn erst vor drei Stunden, gemeinsam mit Condor, in seinem Hause schwermüde verlassen. Halluzinierte ich oder war der alte Mann wahnsinnig geworden? War er im Fieber aufgestanden und irrte nun im dünnen Rock ohne Mantel und Hut nachtwandlerisch herum? Aber unverkennbar, er war es. Unter Hunderttausenden hätte ich die gedrückte, gebückte, verängstigte Art seines Heranschleichens erkannt.","In my first astonishment I didn't believe myself. Kekesfalva in our barracks park - that was impossible, I had left him at his house only three hours ago, together with Condor, very tired. Was I hallucinating or had the old man gone insane? Had he got up in a fever and was now wandering around like a sleepwalker in a thin coat, without a coat or hat? But unmistakably, it was him. Among hundreds of thousands I would have recognized the depressed, stooped, frightened way of his creeping approach.","In my first astonishment I couldn’t believe my eyes. Kekesfalva in the little park outside our barracks—it was impossible. Only three hours earlier, when Condor and I took our leave, I’d left him in his house looking tired to death. Was I hallucinating, or had the old man lost his wits? Had he got up in the middle of a feverish fit, and was he now wandering around like a sleepwalker in his thin coat, without even an overcoat and hat? But there was no mistaking it, here he was. I’d have known the depressed, bowed, anxious way he walked among thousands.","In the first shock of astonishment I could not believe my eyes. Kekesfalva in our barrack-grounds? Impossible, for had not Condor and I left him, dead-tired, three hours ago at his house? Was I the victim of an hallucination, or had the old man taken leave of his senses? Had he got out of bed in a fever and was he now wandering about like a sleep-walker in that thin jacket, without overcoat or hat? But it was undoubtedly he. I should have recognized that dejected, bowed, timid, slinking figure among thousands."
"Das muß irgendein Witz gewesen sein von dem boshaften Kerl, denn die andern schmunzeln oder verstecken ein dreckiges Lachen. Ja, irgend etwas ist los. Sonst, wenn einer von uns nach Mitternacht anrückt, fragen sie umständlich nach dem Woher und Warum und spicken ihren Spaß mit kräftigen Vermutungen. Heut wendet sich keiner mir zu, alle tun sie irgendwie geniert. Ich muß in ihre behäbige Sumpferei hereingeschlagen haben wie ein Stein ins Wasser. Endlich lehnt sich der Jozsi zurück, kneift das linke Lid halb zu wie bei einem Scharfschuß, dann fragt er:","That must have been some kind of joke from the malicious fellow, because the others smile or hide a dirty laugh. Yes, something is up. Otherwise, when one of us shows up after midnight, they'll ask awkwardly where and why, and pepper their fun with bold guesses. Nobody turns to me today, everyone does it somehow embarrassed. I must have smashed into their sedentary swamp like a stone into water. Jozsi finally leans back, half closes his left eyelid as if he were being shot, then he asks:","This sally must have been meant as some kind of joke on Jozsi’s part, for the others grin or stifle suggestive laughter. Yes, there’s something going on. Usually, when one of us turns up after midnight, they ask where he’s been and why and lard their joking with heavy insinuations. Today no one turns to me, they all seem embarrassed. I must have intruded on their comfortable, lazy evening like a stone dropped into water. At last Jozsi leans back, half-closes his left eye like a marksman taking aim, and asks, “Well, are congratulations in order?”","This must have been a gibe on the wretched fellow’s part, for the others either smirked or smothered a malicious laugh. Yes, something was definitely the matter. Usually when one of us turned up after midnight he was questioned in detail as to where he had been and why, and the shafts were barbed with pointed innuendoes. Today not one of them said a word to me; they all seemed confoundedly ill-at-ease. I must have broken in upon their comfortable lethargy like a stone hurled into a stagnant pool. At length Jozsi leaned back and half-closed his left eye as though about to take aim."
"Ich spüre bereits, daß ich mich gefährlich verrannt habe. Ein-, zwei-, dreimal schlägt sie mit ihrem losen Handschuh auf den Tisch, als wollte sie eine Unruhe in den Gelenken loswerden. Dann blickt sie drohend auf.","I can already feel that I've made a dangerous mistake. Once, twice, three times she hits the table with her loose glove, as if trying to get rid of a restlessness in her joints. Then she looks up menacingly.","I realise that I have veered dangerously off course. She slaps the table with the glove she has removed from her hand once, twice, three times, as if to work off the restlessness of her joints. Then she gives me a dark look.","I realized that I had got myself into a deuce of a hole. She hit the table once, twice, thrice with her glove as though to work off the nervous tension in her fingers. Then she looked up menacingly."
"»Vernichten Sie sofort meinen früheren Brief! Ich war verrückt, völlig verrückt. Alles, was ich schrieb, ist nicht wahr. Und kommen Sie morgen nicht zu uns! Bitte bestimmt nicht kommen!

»Ja.«,"""Yes.""","“Yes, sir.”",‘Yes.’
"Mir war sonderbar zumute. Was ist das mit mir, staunte ich innerlich, daß alle zu mir Vertrauen haben, daß diese Blinde ihre leeren Augen strahlend gegen mich hebt, daß dieser Mann, ein beinahe Fremder, mir jetzt freundschaftlich den Arm um die Schulter legt? Schon als ich die Treppe hinunterging, verstand ich nicht mehr, was vor einer Stunde mich hierhergetrieben. Warum hatte ich denn eigentlich fliehen wollen? Weil irgendein bärbeißiger Vorgesetzter mich beschimpft hatte? Weil ein Wesen, ein armer verstümmelter Mensch in Liebe zu mir verging? Weil jemand an mir sich festhalten, sich aufrichten wollte? Es war doch wunderbar, zu helfen, das einzige, was sich wahrhaft verlohnte und belohnte. Und diese Erkenntnis drängte mich, nun aus freiem Willen zu leisten, was ich gestern noch als unerträgliches Opfer empfunden: für die große, für die glühende Liebe eines Menschen diesem Menschen dankbar zu sein.","I felt strange. What's the matter with me, I wondered inwardly, that everyone trusts me, that this blind woman raises her beaming empty eyes at me, that this man, almost a stranger, now puts his arm around my shoulder in a friendly manner? As soon as I went down the stairs, I couldn't understand what drove me here an hour ago. Why did I actually want to flee? Because some surly superior had insulted me? Because a being, a poor mutilated person, died in love with me? Because someone wanted to hold on to me, to sit up? It was wonderful to help, the only thing that was truly worthwhile and rewarding. And this realization urged me now to make of my own free will what yesterday I felt to be an unbearable sacrifice: to be thankful for the great, glowing love of a human being.","I was feeling very odd. What is it about me, I asked myself, that makes everyone trust me, makes this blind woman seem to look up at me with a radiant expression, makes this man, not much more than a stranger to me, put his arm around my shoulders in such a friendly fashion? As I went down the stairs I could no longer understand what had driven me here an hour ago. Why had I really wanted to run away? Because a poor, disabled girl was in love with me? Because someone wanted to help herself by clinging to me? Helping someone else was wonderful, the only thing truly worthwhile. And that realisation now made me do something of my own free will that only yesterday had seemed to me an intolerable sacrifice—I felt grateful for the overwhelming, burning love of another human being.","I felt very strange. What is there about me, I wondered to myself, that everyone should have confidence in me, that this blind woman should raise her sightless eyes so joyfully to me, that this man, who is practically a stranger to me, should put a friendly arm round my shoulder? And as I went down the stairs I could no longer understand what it was that had brought me here an hour before. Why had I wanted to run away? Because a cross-grained old colonel had given me a dressing-down? Because a poor crippled creature had fallen in love with me? Because a human being wanted to cling to me, to get consolation from me? Was it not the most wonderful thing on earth to be able to help one’s fellow-creatures? I now knew that it was the only thing that was really worth while. And this realization was driving me to do of my own free will what I had yesterday regarded as an intolerable sacrifice: to show my gratitude to a sick girl for her great, her burning love for me."
"Aber es ist der Sinn der Jugend, daß jede neue Erkenntnis ihr zu Exaltation wird und sie, einmal angeschwungen von einem Gefühl, davon nicht genug zu bekommen vermag. Eine sonderbare Verwandlung begann in mir, sobald ich entdeckte, daß dies mein Mitfühlen eine Kraft war, die nicht nur mich selbst geradezu lustvoll erregte, sondern auch über mich hinaus wohltätig wirkte: seit ich zum erstenmal dieser neuen Fähigkeit des Mitleidens Einlaß in mich gegeben, schien es mir, als sei ein Toxin in mein Blut eingedrungen und hätte es wärmer, röter, geschwinder, pulsender, vehementer gemacht. Mit einem Schlage verstand ich die Stumpfheit nicht mehr, in der ich bislang so schlendrig dahingelebt wie in einer grauen gleichgültigen Dämmerung. Hundert Dinge beginnen mich zu erregen, zu beschäftigen, an denen ich früher achtlos vorübergegangen. Überall gewahre ich, als wäre mit jenem ersten Blick in ein fremdes Leiden ein schärferes, wissenderes Auge in mir erwacht, Einzelheiten, die mich beschäftigen, begeistern, erschüttern. Und da doch unsere ganze Welt voll ist, Straße um Straße und Zimmer um Zimmer, mit fühlbarem Schicksal und durchflutet von brennender Not bis zum untersten Grund, so ist mein Tag jetzt ununterbrochen von Aufmerksamkeit und Spannung erfüllt. Ich ertappe mich zum Beispiel beim Remontenreiten, daß ich auf einmal nicht mehr wie früher einem stützigen Pferd mit voller Wucht einen Hieb über die Kruppe schlagen kann, denn ich spüre schuldbewußt den von mir verursachten Schmerz, und die Strieme brennt mir auf der eigenen Haut. Oder unwillkürlich krampfen sich mir die Finger zusammen, wenn unser cholerischer Rittmeister einem armen ruthenischen Ulanen, der den Sattel schlecht aufgezäumt hat, die geballte Faust ins Gesicht knallt, und der Bursche steht stramm, die Hand an der Hosennaht. Ringsum starren oder lachen blöd die andern Soldaten, ich aber, ich allein sehe, wie unter den beschämt gesenkten Augenlidern des dumpfen Burschen die Wimpern sich feuchten. Mit einmal kann ich in unserer Offiziersmesse die Witze über ungeschickte oder unbeholfene Kameraden nicht mehr ertragen; seit ich an diesem wehrlosen, machtlosen Mädchen die Qual der Unkraft begriffen habe, erregt mich haßvoll jede Brutalität und anteilfordernd jede Wehrlosigkeit. Unzählige Kleinigkeiten, die mir bisher entgangen sind, bemerke ich, seit mir der Zufall diesen einen heißen Tropfen Mitleid ins Auge geträufelt, einfältige, simple Dinge, aber von jedem einzelnen geht für mich Spannung und Erschütterung aus. Es fällt mir zum Beispiel auf, daß die Tabaktrafikantin, bei der ich immer meine Zigaretten kaufe, die hingereichten Geldstücke auffällig nah an die rundgeschliffene Brille hält, und sofort beunruhigt mich der Verdacht, daß sie den Star bekommen könne. Morgen will ich sie vorsichtig ausfragen und vielleicht auch den Regimentsarzt Goldbaum bitten, daß er sie einmal untersucht. Oder es fällt mir auf, daß die Freiwilligen den kleinen rothaarigen K. in der letzten Zeit so sichtlich schneiden, und ich erinnere mich, daß in der Zeitung gestanden hat (was kann er dafür, der arme Junge?), sein Onkel sei wegen betrügerischer Malversationen eingesperrt worden; mit Absicht setze ich mich bei der Menage zu ihm hin und fange ein langes Gespräch an, an seinem dankbaren Blick sofort spürend, daß er versteht, ich tu’s nur, um den andern zu zeigen, wie ungerecht und ordinär sie ihn behandeln. Oder ich bettle einen von meinem Zug heraus, dem der Oberst sonst unbarmherzig vier Stunden Spangen aufgebrummt hätte; immer neu und an täglich anderen Proben genieße ich diese plötzlich in mich gefahrene Lust. Und ich sage mir: von jetzt ab helfen, soviel du kannst, jedem und jedem! Nie mehr träge, nie mehr gleichgültig sein! Sich steigern, indem man sich hingibt, sich bereichern, indem man jedem Schicksal sich verbrüdert, jedes Leiden durch Mitleiden versteht und besteht. Und mein über sich selbst erstauntes Herz zittert vor Dankbarkeit für die Kranke, die ich unwissend gekränkt, und die durch ihr Leiden mich diese schöpferische Magie des Mitleids gelehrt.","But it is the meaning of youth that every new knowledge becomes an exaltation for it and, once excited by a feeling, it cannot get enough of it. A strange transformation began in me as soon as I discovered that my compassion was a force which not only thrilled me positively but also worked beneficently beyond me: since I first admitted this new capacity for compassion into myself, it seemed to me that a toxin had entered my blood and made it warmer, redder, quicker, throbbing, more vehement. All of a sudden I no longer understood the dullness in which I had hitherto lived as sluggishly as in a gray, indifferent twilight. Hundreds of things are beginning to excite and occupy me that I used to ignore. Everywhere I perceive, as if a sharper, more knowing eye had awakened in me with that first glimpse into someone else's suffering, details that occupy, excite, shock me. And yet since our whole world is full, street after street and room after room, with destiny felt and awash with burning need to the very bottom, my day is now filled with uninterrupted attention and excitement. For example, when I'm riding replacement horses, I find myself suddenly unable to hit a leaning horse with full force on the croup as I used to, because I guiltily feel the pain I've caused and the welts are burning on my own skin. Or my fingers clench involuntarily when our choleric Rittmeister bangs his clenched fist in the face of a poor Ruthenian Uhlan who hasn't bridled the saddle badly, and the lad stands to attention, his hand on his trouser seam. All around me the other soldiers stare or laugh stupidly, but I, I alone, see how the eyelashes are moistening under the embarrassed lowered eyelids of the dull fellow. All of a sudden I can't stand the jokes in our officers' mess about clumsy or clumsy comrades; Ever since I understood the torment of impotence in this defenseless, powerless girl, every brutality hatefully arouses me and every defenselessness demands my share. Ever since chance dropped that hot drop of pity in my eye, I've noticed countless little things that I've missed up to now, simple-minded, simple things, but every single one exudes tension and shock for me. It strikes me, for example, that the tobacconist, from whom I always buy my cigarettes, holds the coins conspicuously close to the round-cut glasses, and the suspicion that she could get the Star immediately troubles me. Tomorrow I want to question her carefully and maybe ask Goldbaum, the regimental doctor, to examine her sometime. Or it strikes me that the volunteers are visibly cutting little red-haired K. lately, and I remember that the newspaper said (what's his fault, poor boy?) that his uncle was being fraudulent malversations been imprisoned; I deliberately sit down next to him by the menage and start a long conversation, immediately feeling from his grateful look that he understands that I'm only doing it to show the others how unfairly and vulgarly they treat him. Or I beg someone out of my platoon whom the colonel would otherwise have mercilessly given braces for four hours; always new and at different rehearsals every day I enjoy this sudden lust. And I say to myself: from now on, help everyone as much as you can! No more sluggish, no more indifferent! Improve yourself by giving yourself, enrich yourself by fraternizing with every destiny, understanding and enduring every suffering through compassion. And my heart, astonished at itself, trembles with gratitude for the patient whom I unknowingly offended, and who through her suffering taught me this creative magic of compassion.","But it is in the nature of youth to be over-excited by every new discovery, and once a feeling carries you away you can’t get enough of it. A strange transformation began to take place in me as soon as I discovered that my empathy for others was a force that did not just arouse my own pleasurable sensations, it had a beneficial effect on others as well. Since I had first allowed this new ability to feel for other people into my mind, it seemed as if a toxin had entered my blood stream and made it warmer, redder, swifter, pulsating more strongly. All at once I could no longer understand the dull state in which I had lived to no purpose until now, as if in indifferent grey twilight. A thousand things that I had previously passed by unheedingly now aroused me and occupied my mind. As if that first insight into someone else’s suffering has opened a sharper, more knowledgeable eye in me, I am now aware of details everywhere that interest me, inspire enthusiasm in me or move me. And as our whole world, street by street and room by room, is full of sad stories, is always flooded with terrible misery, my days are filled with expectant interest. For instance, when trying out new horses I catch myself unable to strike a refractory mount a heavy blow on the crupper without guiltily feeling the pain that I have inflicted, and the welt left on the horse burns on my own skin. Or my fingers curl instinctively when our choleric riding master punches a poor Ruthenian lancer in the face for saddling his mount in a slipshod way, and the fellow stands to attention, hands in line with his trouser seams. The other men standing around are all staring or laughing foolishly, but I, and only I, see how the dull-witted fellow’s lashes grow damp over his eyes, which are downcast in shame. In the officers’ mess I suddenly can’t stand the jokes about clumsy or unskilful comrades; since beginning to understand the pain of that defenceless, powerless girl I feel angry with any brutality and ready to spring to the defence of those who cannot defend themselves. For example, I notice that the woman in the tobacconist’s where I always buy my cigarettes holds the coins she is given strikingly close to the round lenses of her glasses, and I immediately wonder in concern if she is developing a cataract. Tomorrow, I think, I will ask her a few cautious questions, and perhaps ask Goldbaum, our regimental doctor, if he would examine her. And it occurs to me that the volunteers have made a point recently of cutting little red-headed K dead, and I recollect a piece in the newspaper about his uncle, imprisoned for fraud (how can he help what his uncle is like, poor lad?). I deliberately sit down with him at table in the mess and strike up a long conversation, sensing at once, from his grateful expression, that he understands I am doing it only to show the others how unjust and loutish their treatment of him is. Or I intervene on behalf of one of my men whom the Colonel would otherwise have told off for four hours’ fatigues. I enjoy this new pleasure of mine daily, trying it out more and more often. And I tell myself that from now on I will help everyone and anyone as much as I can. I will not lapse into lethargy and indifference again! I will heighten my faculties by giving myself, I will enrich myself by becoming a brother to everyone else, I will feel sympathy for everyone and understand the suffering of others. And my heart, surprised by itself, trembles with gratitude to the sick girl whose feelings I unwittingly hurt, and whose suffering has taught me this creative magic of pity.","But it is the way of young people that each fresh piece of knowledge of life should go to their heads, and that once uplifted by an emotion they can never have enough of it. As soon as I discovered that my ability to feel pity was a force that not only stirred me myself positively pleasurably, but extended its beneficent influence beyond my own personality, a strange metamorphosis began to take place within me. Ever since I had first allowed this capacity for sympathy to enter into my being, it seemed to me as though a toxin had found its way into my blood and had made it run warmer, redder, faster, pulsate and throb more vigorously. All of a sudden I could no longer understand the slothful torpor in which I had hitherto lived as though in a grey, insipid twilight. A hundred and one things to which I had never even given a passing thought began to excite me and to occupy my thoughts. All around me I perceived, as though that first glimpse into the sufferings of another had given me a fresh, a keener, a more understanding eye, things that engaged my attention, thrilled me, shook me. And since this whole world of ours is crammed, street upon street, room upon room, with poignant tragedies, drenched through and through with burning misery and distress, my days were passed from morn till night in a state of heightened attentiveness and expectation. Strange — I found, when trying new mounts for the regiment, that all of a sudden I could no longer, as formerly, give a stubborn horse a savage blow over the crupper without a pang, for I was guiltily aware of the pain I was causing and the weals seared my own skin. Or, again, I would find myself digging my nails into the palms of my hands when our testy Captain struck a poor Ruthenian Uhlan a resounding blow in the face with his clenched fist for saddling a horse badly, and the lad stood there rigidly at attention, his hands pressed to his sides. The soldiers standing about would either stare or laugh vacuously, but I, I alone, would see the hot tears of shame spring to the lashes of the dull-witted lad beneath his lowered lids. All of a sudden, too, I found I could no longer stand the ribald jokes in the officers’ mess at the expense of clumsy or awkward comrades; ever since I had realized in the person of the weak, defenceless Edith the torture of helplessness, I was revolted by any act of brutality and moved to pity by any form of helplessness. Countless trifling things that had hitherto escaped my attention I now noticed, ever since chance had squeezed into my eyes those first hot drops of sympathy; little, simple things, but each of them with the power to move and stir me deeply. It struck me, for instance, that the woman at the tobacconist’s shop where I always bought my cigarettes held the coins that I handed to her remarkably close to the thick lenses of her spectacles, and I was immediately troubled by a suspicion that she might be suffering from cataract. The next day, I thought, I would ask her about it very tactfully and perhaps ask Goldbaum, our regimental doctor, to be so kind as to examine her. Or it occurred to me that the volunteers had of late been pointedly cutting that little red-haired chap K., and I remembered having seen in the newspaper (how could he help it, the poor lad?) that his uncle had been sent to prison for embezzlement; I made a point of sitting by him in the mess and entered into a lengthy conversation, immediately perceiving from his look of gratitude that he knew I was doing it simply to show the others how unsporting and caddish their behaviour was. Or I would put in a word for one of my troop whom the Colonel had ordered four hours’ fatigue duty. Again and again, day after day, I found fresh opportunities for indulging, trying out, this passion that had suddenly possessed me. And I said to myself: from now on, help anyone and everyone so far as in you lies. Cease to be apathetic, indifferent! Exalt yourself by devoting yourself to others, enrich yourself by making everyone’s destiny your own, by enduring and understanding every facet of human suffering through your pity. And my heart, astonished at its own workings, quivered with gratitude towards the sick girl whom I had unwittingly hurt and who, through her suffering, had taught me the creative magic of pity."
"»Ja … aber wir hoffen, bloß um ein paar Tage … übrigens, das besprechen wir morgen oder übermorgen … vielleicht telephoniere ich Ihnen noch inzwischen … ich wollte Ihnen jedenfalls das nur rasch ausrichten … also heute lieber nicht und … und … alles Gute und auf Wiedersehen!«","""Yes ... but we hope for just a few days ... by the way, we'll discuss that tomorrow or the day after ... maybe I'll call you in the meantime ... I just wanted to tell you that quickly ... so better not today and ... and ... all the best and up Goodbye!«","There must have been horror in my voice, because she quickly adds, “Yes … but we hope only for a few days. And anyway we can talk this over tomorrow, or the next day … perhaps I’ll telephone you meantime. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know … better not tomorrow and … and warm regards, and we’ll see you soon!”","‘Yes ... but only for a few days, we hope ... Anyhow, we can discuss that tomorrow or the day after ... Perhaps I’ll give you another ring ... I only wanted to let you know ... So don’t come today, if you don’t mind, and ... and ... good-bye and best wishes.’"
"Ich ging die paar Schritte zurück bis zu ihrem Bett und spürte an einer plötzlichen Stille, daß ihr Atem aussetzte. Unablässig blieben ihre mitwandernden Augen auf mich gerichtet, indes der Kopf reglos in den Kissen verharrte. Keine Hand, kein Finger rührte sich, einzig die beobachtenden Augen wanderten mit mir und ließen mich nicht los.","I walked back the few steps to her bed and felt a sudden silence that her breathing stopped. Her wandering eyes remained fixed on me, while her head remained motionless on the pillow. Not a hand, not a finger moved, only the observing eyes wandered with me and did not let me go.","I took the few steps back to her bed, and sensed, from the sudden silence, that she was holding her breath. Her eyes were fixed on me now, moving when I did, while her head lay motionless on the pillows. Her hands and finger were still; only those eyes followed my every movement and never left me.","As I walked the few paces back to her bedside I could tell from the sudden silence that she was holding her breath. Her eyes were fixed steadily on me as I moved towards her, her head was motionless on the pillows. She did not move a hand, a finger, but her eyes followed me and would not leave me."
"»Vor den Kameraden, sagst? Alle ham’s g’hört?«","""In front of the comrades, you say? Everyone heard it?”","“In front of your comrades, right? They all heard you?”","‘In the presence of your fellow-officers, you say? They all heard it?’"
"»Ein Edelmann? … Ein echter noch dazu? … Kekesfalva? Verzeihen Sie, lieber Herr Leutnant … aber meinen Sie das … wirklich im Ernst … das mit dem echten ungarischen Edelmann?«","'A nobleman? … A real one at that? … Kekesfalva? Forgive me, dear lieutenant... but do you mean that... seriously... about the real Hungarian nobleman?”","A genuine nobleman at that? Kekesfalva? Forgive me, my dear sir … but do you mean that seriously? I mean about his being a genuine Hungarian nobleman?”","‘A nobleman? ... An aristocrat? ... Kekesfalva? Forgive me, Herr Leutnant ... but do you really mean that seriously ... what you said about his being a real Hungarian nobleman?’"
"Aber kaum daß ich am nächsten Tage das Haus betrat, merkte ich schon, daß, hellsichtig durch die gleiche Besorgnis, Edith bereits Vorkehrungen getroffen hatte, um mir nicht allein zu begegnen. Bereits im Vorraum vernahm ich hell plaudernde Frauenstimmen; sie hatte also zu dieser ungewohnten Zeit, wo sonst niemals Gäste unser Beisammensein störten, sich Bekannte zum Schutz eingeladen, um den ersten kritischen Augenblick zu überbrücken.","But as soon as I entered the house the next day, I noticed that Edith, clairvoyant because of the same concern, had already taken precautions not to meet me alone. Already in the anteroom I could hear women's voices chatting brightly; So at this unusual time, when guests usually never disturbed our get-together, she had invited acquaintances to protect her, in order to bridge the first critical moment.","However, as soon as I entered the Kekesfalva house next day I realised that the same fears had made Edith perceptive, and she had made sure that we did not meet on our own. Even from the front hall I heard the chatter of female voices. At a time when guests never usually disturbed our meeting she had invited acquaintances to visit her, protection to help her through the first difficult moment.","But no sooner had I set foot next day in the Kekesfalva house than I realized that Edith, prompted, no doubt, by the same anxiety as myself, had wisely taken the precaution to see that our first meeting should take place in company. While still in the hall, I heard the sound of animated female voices; it seemed that in order to bridge the awkwardness of the first critical moments of meeting she had invited friends to the house — at an hour of the day when as a rule we were left undisturbed together."
"Und schon steht er in Positur, den Zwicker über die etwas weitsichtigen Augen geschoben, und entfaltet umständlich sein Folioblatt. Es ist das obligate Gelegenheitsgedicht, mit dem er jedes Fest zu verschönen glaubt und das diesmal die Lebensgeschichte Balinkays mit »zündenden« Scherzen zu verbrämen sucht. Aus subalterner Höflichkeit oder vielleicht, weil sie selbst schon ein bißchen angetrunken sind, lachen bei jeder Anspielung einige Nachbarn gefällig mit. Endlich schlägt eine Pointe wirklich ein, und von knatterdem »bravo, bravo« dröhnt die ganze Runde.","And already he is in position, pince-nez pushed over his somewhat far-sighted eyes, and laboriously unfolds his folio sheet. It is the obligatory occasional poem with which he believes he can embellish every celebration and which this time attempts to embellish Balinkay's life story with ""igniting"" jokes. Out of subaltern politeness or perhaps because they are a bit drunk themselves, a few neighbors laugh willingly at every allusion. Finally, a punchline really hits home, and the whole round roars with a rattling »bravo, bravo«.","And there he is in position, his pince-nez over his rather long-sighted eyes, and he unfolds a sheet of foolscap with much ceremony. It is the obligatory piece that he feels it his duty to deliver to enliven any party, and this time it sets out to embellish Balinkay’s life story with a series of double entendres. Several of my neighbours dutifully laugh along with him at every allusion, whether out of politeness to a superior officer or because they are slightly tipsy themselves. Finally he concludes the whole performance, and shouts of “Bravo!” ring out from the assembled company.","And now, pushing his spectacles up above his somewhat longsighted eyes, he struck an attitude and ostentatiously unrolled a sheet of foolscap on which was written the inevitable poem with which, as he fondly thought, he graced every festive occasion. This time it was an effort to embroider Balinkay’s life-story with all kinds of ‘telling’ witticisms. Several of my neighbours, either out of courtesy to a senior officer or because they themselves were already a little tipsy, tittered obligingly at every allusion. At last a point really did get home, and a volley of bravos thundered out from the whole company."
"Sie gingen hinüber ins Verwalterhaus. Tatsächlich, alle Papiere des Prozesses lagen noch wirr zusammengestopft in der Aktentasche, die ganzen Korrespondenzen mit ihrem Advokaten, die Gebührenvorschreibungen, die Kopie des Vergleiches. Nervös blätterte sie die Dokumente durch, und Kanitz, der ihr schweratmend zusah, zitterten dabei die Hände. Endlich faltete sie ein Blatt auf. ›Ich glaube, das wird wohl jener Brief sein.‹","They went over to the steward's house. In fact, all the papers from the trial were still tangled up in the briefcase, all the correspondence with her lawyer, the fee schedule, the copy of the settlement. She leafed through the documents nervously, and Kanitz, who watched her panting, his hands trembling. Finally she unfolded a sheet of paper. ""I think that must be that letter.""","“They went over to the administration buildings. Sure enough, all the papers to do with the inheritance had been stuffed into a briefcase, all the correspondence with her lawyer, the documents about inheritance tax, a copy of the agreement she had signed with the other heirs. She nervously leafed through these documents, and Kanitz, breathing heavily as he watched, found his own hands trembling. At last she unfolded a sheet of paper. “‘I think this must be the letter.’","They went across to the estate building. Yes, indeed, all the documents concerned with the lawsuit were there, stuffed anyhow into a briefcase; the whole of the correspondence with her lawyers, the tax forms, the copy of the final settlement. She nervously ran through the documents, and Kanitz, breathing heavily as he watched her, could feel his hands trembling. At last she unfolded a paper. ‘I think this must be the letter.’"
"Ferencz schiebt sein breites Gesicht noch mehr in die Breite, die blinzelnden Augen verschwinden beinahe in den rötlichen Apfelbacken; langsam, teigig geht ihm der Mund auf.","Ferencz pushes his broad face even wider, his blinking eyes almost disappear into his ruddy apple cheeks; slowly, doughy, his mouth opens.","Ferencz’s smile stretches his broad face, making it even broader, his twinkling eyes almost disappear into his rosy apple cheeks, his doughy mouth opens.","Ferencz puffed out his cheeks until his round face seemed more moon-like than ever, his twinkling eyes almost disappearing in his rosy apple cheeks; slowly, doughily, his mouth opened."
"Nun begreife ich erst, wieso das alles passiert ist. Zweifellos habe ich selbst das falsche Kommando gegeben. Ich muß meine Gedanken nicht beisammen gehabt haben. Ich habe wieder an diese schreckliche Sache gedacht, die mich völlig verstört. Ich allein bin schuld. Mir allein fällt alle Verantwortung zu. Ein leichter Schenkeldruck, und mein Wallach trabt an den Kameraden vorbei, die peinlich berührt wegschauen, auf den Oberst zu, der etwa dreißig Schritt vor der Front unbeweglich wartet. In vorschriftsmäßiger Distanz halte ich vor ihm; inzwischen ist auch das leiseste Klappern und Klinkern abgestorben. Jene letzte, lautloseste, jene wahrhaft tödliche Stille setzt ein wie bei einer Hinrichtung knapp vor dem Kommando »Feuer«. Jeder, selbst der letzte ruthenische Bauernbursche dort rückwärts, weiß, was mir bevorsteht.","Only now do I understand why all this happened. No doubt I gave the wrong command myself. I must not have had my thoughts together. I've been thinking about that awful thing again, which is terribly disturbing to me. It's my fault. All responsibility falls to me alone. A slight pressure on my thighs and my gelding trotts past my comrades, who look away in embarrassment, towards the colonel, who is waiting motionless about thirty paces in front of the front. I stop in front of him at the prescribed distance; meanwhile even the slightest rattling and clinking has died away. That last, most silent, that truly deadly silence sets in, as in an execution, just before the command ""fire."" Everyone, even the last Ruthenian peasant boy back there, knows what's in store for me.","Only now do I realise how this happened. I was the man who gave the wrong command. My thoughts must have been straying. I was thinking once again of the terrible business that had upset me so much. I alone am to blame. The responsibility is all mine. A slight pressure of the thighs, and my gelding trots past my comrades, who look away in embarrassment as I approach the Colonel. He is waiting motionless some thirty feet in front of the line of men. I stop at the prescribed distance from him. By now even the faintest clinking and chinking of the men’s equipment has died away. A final, soundless, truly deadly silence sets in, like the silence at an execution before the firing squad is given the command. Everyone, even the least of the Ruthenian farmers’ boys back there, knows what lies ahead for me.","It was not until now that I realized what had happened. Indubitably it was I who had given the wrong word of command. My thoughts must have been wandering. I had been thinking of that terrible thing that so completely distracted me. I alone was to blame. Mine was the sole responsibility. A slight pressure of my knees, and my gelding trotted past my comrades, who looked away in acute embarrassment, towards the Colonel; he was waiting motionless some thirty paces from the regiment, and I reined in my horse at the regulation distance away from him. The rattle and clatter had now completely died down, and that final, soundless, yet deathly stillness had set in which precedes the order to fire at an execution. Everyone, even the peasant lads at the very back, knew what was in store for me."
"Dort freilich erwartete uns besonderer Empfang. Die Burschen der nächsten Umgebung hatten – offenbar von unserem Besuch verständigt – sich just die ungebändigten Pferde des Gestüts herangeholt und jagten uns in einer Art arabischer Fantasia in schärfstem Galopp entgegen. Prächtig waren sie anzusehen, diese sonnverbrannten jauchzenden Jungen, offen das Hemd, bunte, lange Bänder wegschwingend von den niederen Hüten, weiß und breit die Pampashosen; wie eine Beduinenhorde stoben sie auf den ungesattelten Pferden stürmisch heran, als wollten sie uns in einem Ruck überrennen. Schon spitzten unsere Gäule unruhig die Ohren, schon mußte mit angestemmten Beinen der alte Jonak die Zügel scharf halten, als sich die wilde Bande auf einen plötzlichen Pfiff hin kunstvoll zum geschlossenen Zuge formte, der uns dann als übermütiges Cortège bis zum Hause des Gestütsverwalters begleitete.","There, of course, a special reception awaited us. The lads in the immediate vicinity had - evidently informed by our visit - just fetched the untamed horses of the stud farm and galloped towards us in a kind of Arabian fantasy at the sharpest gallop. They were magnificent to look at, these sunburnt, jubilant boys, their shirts open, colorful, long ribbons swinging away from their low hats, white and wide pampas trousers; like a horde of Bedouins, they rushed up on their unsaddled horses, as if they wanted to overrun us in one go. Already our horses pricked up their ears restless, already old Jonak had to hold the reins tight with his legs braced, when the wild gang, at a sudden whistle, artfully formed a closed procession, which then accompanied us as a high-spirited cortège to the house of the stud manager.","Here, however, a special reception was waiting for us. The local young men, obviously told in advance about our visit, had chosen to ride the most high-spirited horses in the stud, and now came to meet us at a smart gallop in a kind of Arabian fantasia. It was a fine sight to see these young fellows whooping with delight, sunburnt in their open-necked shirts, and with long coloured ribbons dangling from their low-crowned hats. In white trousers of the kind worn by Argentinian cowboys, they raced up riding bareback, like a Bedouin horde intent on running us down. Our four coach horses were already pricking up their ears uneasily, and old Jonak had to rein them in sharply, bracing his legs on the coachman’s box, as at a sudden whistle the wild band formed skilfully into a line and then escorted us to the stud manager’s house like a cheerful cortège.","There, to be sure, a special welcome awaited us. The lads of the vicinity — obviously apprised of our visit — had just rounded up the wildest horses on the farm and came riding bareback towards us at a furious gallop, in a kind of Arabian fantasia. They were a joy to watch, these sun-burned, exultant young fellows with their open shirts, wide white cowboy trousers, and low-crowned hats from which streamed long coloured ribbons. They charged down upon us like a horde of Bedouins as though to run us down. Our own horses were by now pricking up their ears uneasily, and old Jonak, tautening his legs, was about to pull sharply at the reins, when suddenly, at the sound of a shrill whistle, the wild band dexterously formed into a closed column and proceeded to escort us in triumph to the bailiff’s house."
"»Dann … na, Sie werden’s vielleicht ein bissel unverschämt finden, daß ich’s so ehrlich heraussag … dann red ich mir ein, Ihr seht’s mich gern bei Euch, hier gehör ich dazu, hier bin ich hundertmal mehr zu Hause als irgendwo. Immer, wenn ich Sie so anschau, hab ich das Gefühl …«","""Then ... well, you might find it a bit impudent that I'm saying it so honestly ... then I'll tell myself you like it with you, I belong here, I'm a hundred times more at home here than anywhere else. Every time I look at you like that, I get the feeling...""","“Then … well, perhaps you’ll feel I’m being impertinent for saying this so honestly … then I persuade myself that you like to see me, I belong in your company, I feel a hundred times more at home here than anywhere else. Whenever I look at you like this, I have the feeling that …”","‘Then ... well, you’ll probably think it cheeky of me to speak so frankly ... I tell myself you like to have me here, that I belong here, that I am a hundred times more at home here than anywhere else. Whenever I look at you, I have a feeling that ...’"
"Tatsächlich, der alte Mann schwankte hin und her wie ein Trunkener. Ich mußte alle Kraft aufbieten, um ihn mitten im Dunkel, während der Donner schon ganz nah und näher grollte, bis zur Bank hinzuschleppen. Dort fiel er schweratmend hin. Unverkennbar, das Warten hatte ihn erledigt, und kein Wunder: drei Stunden hatte er spähend und unruhig auf seinen müden Beinen Posten gestanden, und jetzt erst, da er mich glücklich gefaßt, war die Anstrengung ihm bewußt geworden. Erschöpft und wie hingeschlagen lehnte er auf der Armeleutebank, wo mittags die Arbeiter ihren kleinen Imbiß verzehrten, wo nachmittags die Pfründner und die schwangeren Frauen saßen, wo nachts die Dirnen sich Soldaten heranholten, er, der alte Mann, der reichste der Stadt, und wartete, wartete, wartete. Und ich wußte, auf was er wartete, ich ahnte sofort, daß ich den Hartnäckigen nicht anders fortbringen könnte von dieser Bank (welch ärgerliche Situation, wenn einer der Kameraden mich in dieser sonderbaren Vertraulichkeit ertappte!), als indem ich ihn gleichsam von innen aufrichtete. Ich mußte ihn zuerst beruhigen. Und wieder kam das Mitleid über mich, abermals brach die verfluchte heiße Welle innen auf, die mich jedesmal so kraftlos und willenlos machte; ich beugte mich näher und begann auf ihn einzusprechen.","Indeed, the old man was swaying like a drunk. It took all my strength to drag him to the bank in the middle of the dark, with the thunder rumbling nearer and nearer. There he fell down, panting. Unmistakably, the waiting had exhausted him, and no wonder: for three hours he had stood restlessly on his weary legs, peering, and only now that he had happily caught me did he become aware of the exertion. Exhausted and as if knocked out, he leaned on the pauper's bench, where the workers ate their little snacks at noon, where the beneficiaries and pregnant women sat in the afternoons, where the whores brought the soldiers over at night, he, the old man, the richest in town, waited , waited, waited. And I knew what he was waiting for, I had a hunch at once that there was no other way I could get the stubborn man away from this bench (what a dreadful situation when one of my comrades caught me in this strange intimacy!) than by lifting him up from the inside, so to speak . I had to calm him down first. And again pity came over me, again the cursed hot wave broke up inside, which always made me so powerless and weak of will; I leaned closer and started talking to him.","And indeed the old man was swaying back and forth as if drunk. It took me all my strength to drag him over to the bench through the dark, while the thunder rumbled as it came closer and closer. The waiting had undoubtedly exhausted him, and no wonder. He must have stood on weary legs at his post for three hours, impatiently on watch for me, and only now that he had succeeded in getting hold of me did the strain show. Exhausted, as if felled by a heavy blow, he leant on the bench put there as a place where the poor could sit. Workmen also ate their midday snack on this bench, pensioners and pregnant women sat on it in the afternoons, and the whores used it at night when they were looking out for soldiers. Now old Kekesfalva, a man who was richer than anyone else in this town, sat there still waiting, waiting, waiting. And I knew what he was waiting for. I guessed at once that I would never induce the obstinate old man to move from this bench (and how awkward if one of my comrades happened to see me in this strange intimacy!) unless I could raise his spirits first. I had to reassure him before he would move. Once again I was overcome by pity, once again I felt that hot surge of emotion. It always made me powerless, sapping my own will. I leant closer to him and began talking.","And, indeed, the old man was swaying back and forth like a drunken man. The growling of the thunder drew nearer and nearer, and it took all my strength to drag him over to the bench, where he sank down, breathing heavily. It was plain that all this waiting had been too much for him, and no wonder! For three hours the old man with his weak heart had paced up and down, for three hours he had stood there on his weary old legs, keeping an uneasy look-out for me, and only now, when he had succeeded in catching me, had he realized the effort it had cost him. Exhausted, and almost in a state of collapse, he leaned back on the paupers’ bench, that bench where at midday workmen munched their snacks, where in the afternoons old pensioners and pregnant women rested, and where at night harlots accosted soldiers — this old man, the richest man in the town, leaned back and waited, waited, waited. And I knew what it was he was waiting for, I realized at once that I should never be able to get the stubborn old man to budge from this bench (how annoying if one of my fellow-officers were to catch me in this strange company!) unless I were to raise him up spiritually, as it were, unless I reassured him. And once more I was assailed by a feeling of pity, once more that confounded hot wave of emotion surged up within me, sapping my strength and will. I bent over him and began to talk to him."
Wir befanden uns in diesem Augenblick schon ganz nahe dem Bahnhofsgebäude. Unser Gespräch mußte bald enden; so drängte ich:,At that moment we were very close to the station building. Our conversation must end soon; so I urged:,"At this moment we were approaching the station building, and our conversation must soon come to an end, so I pressed him once more.","We were now nearing the station. Our conversation would have to end soon; and so I said insistently: ‘You think then, that ...’"
"Und weiter und weiter lief das wie eine angeschnurrte Feder. Ich hörte betäubt zu, noch immer ganz benommen von der unfaßbaren Verwandlung. Völlig anders war ihre Stimme, leicht und fließend der sonst nervöse Tonfall ihres Redens, gleichsam ausgetauscht das vertraute Gesicht, überhellt das kränkliche gelbliche Inkarnat durch frische, gesündere Farbe, verschwunden das Fahrige in ihren Gesten. Eine leicht Trunkene saß da vor mir mit funkelnden Pupillen und lachend lebendigem Mund. Unwillkürlich ging dieser schwülige Rausch in mich über und lockerte wie jede Trunkenheit den inneren Widerstand. Vielleicht, täuschte ich mir vor, ist es doch wahr oder wird es doch wahr. Vielleicht habe ich sie gar nicht getäuscht, vielleicht wird sie faktisch so rasch geheilt. Glatt gelogen habe ich ja schließlich nicht oder nicht allzusehr – Condor hat doch wirklich von einer stupenden Heilung was gelesen, warum soll sie gerade bei diesem glühenden und rührend gläubigen Kinde nicht möglich werden, bei diesem sensitiven Wesen, das schon der bloße Hauch des Gesundens dermaßen beglückt und beflügelt? Warum also einen Überschwang hemmen, der sie aufhellt, warum sie mit Kleinmut quälen, sie hat sich, die Arme, doch lang genug gepeinigt. Und wie es einem Redner geschieht, daß die Begeisterung, die er mit seinem leeren Wort geschaffen, ihn im Rückschlag als wirkliche Gewalt ergreift, so drang die Zuversicht, die doch einzig durch mein mitleidiges Übertreiben entstanden, immer sieghafter in mich selber ein. Und als schließlich der Vater erschien, fand er uns insgesamt in sorglosester Laune; wir plauderten und planten, als ob Edith bereits genesen und gesundet wäre. Wo sie wieder reiten lernen könnte, fragte sie, und ob wir vom Regiment die Lektionen beaufsichtigen und ihr helfen wollten? Ja, und ob nicht jetzt schon der Vater dem Pfarrer das Geld geben solle für das neue Kirchendach, das er ihm versprochen hätte? All diese Verwegenheiten, die eine Gesundung schon als selbstverständlich antizipierten, lachte und spaßte sie mit solcher Unbekümmertheit des Herzens, daß der letzte Widerstand in mir verstummte. Und erst, als ich abends mich allein in meinem Zimmer fand, begann ein leises Erinnern von innen an die Herzwand zu pochen: ist es nicht zu überschwenglich, was sie sich verspricht? Solltest du nicht doch diese gefährliche Zuversicht lieber ernüchtern? Aber ich ließ den Gedanken an mich nicht heran. Warum mich sorgen, ob ich zuviel oder zu wenig gesagt? Selbst wenn ich viel mehr verheißen, als ich redlicherweise hätte tun dürfen – schon diese Mitleidlüge hat sie glücklich gemacht; und einen Menschen glücklich zu machen, kann nie eine Schuld oder ein Unrecht sein.","And on and on it went like a purred feather. I listened in a daze, still dazed by the incomprehensible transformation. Her voice was completely different, the otherwise nervous tone of her speech was light and flowing, her familiar face was exchanged, as it were, her sickly yellowish flesh was brightened with fresh, healthier colour, the restlessness in her gestures had disappeared. A slightly drunk sat in front of me, her pupils sparkling and her mouth alive with laughter. This sultry intoxication swept over me involuntarily and, like all drunkenness, loosened my inner resistance. Perhaps, I deluded myself, it is true after all, or will it be true after all. Maybe I didn't deceive her, maybe she will actually be healed that quickly. After all, I didn't lie outright, or not too much - Condor really read something about a stupendous healing, why shouldn't it be possible with this glowing and touchingly believing child, with this sensitive being that the mere touch of recovery so much happy and inspired? So why restrain an exuberance that brightens her, why torment her with faintheartedness, poor thing, she has tormented herself long enough. And just as it happens to a speaker that the enthusiasm he created with his empty word seizes him as real violence when he recoils, so the confidence that only arose through my pitying exaggeration penetrated more and more victoriously into me. And when the father finally appeared, he found us altogether in the most carefree mood; we chatted and planned as if Edith had already recovered and recovered. Where could she learn to ride again, she asked, and would we in the regiment want to supervise the lessons and help her? Yes, and shouldn't the father now give the pastor the money he had promised him for the new church roof? All these daring things, which already anticipated a recovery as a matter of course, she laughed and joked with such a carefree heart that the last resistance in me fell silent. And only when I found myself alone in my room in the evening did a faint recollection begin to beat against the wall of my heart: isn't what she promises herself too exuberant? Wouldn't you rather sober up this dangerous confidence? But I didn't let the thought get to me. Why worry if I said too much or too little? Even if I promised a lot more than I could honestly have done - even this pity lie has made her happy; and making a man happy can never be a fault or a wrong.","And on and on she went, like a whirring, tightly wound spring. I listened, numb and still bemused by this extraordinary transformation. Her voice was entirely different, the usually nervous inflection of her speech was light and fluent, and her familiar face might have been exchanged for another. Her sickly, sallow complexion had a fresher, healthier glow, and all her fidgety, staccato gestures were gone. I was facing a girl whose sparkling eyes and laughing, mobile mouth made her look slightly intoxicated. The warmth of her elation transferred itself to me, relaxing me, as any state of intoxication does. Perhaps it’s true after all, I tried to persuade myself, or perhaps it will be true. Perhaps I haven’t misled her, perhaps she will really get better quickly. After all, I told myself, I haven’t told outright lies, or not too many of them— Condor really did read something about an amazing new treatment, why shouldn’t it work for this glowing, touchingly confident child, this sensitive creature who is so delighted and inspired by the mere breath of health? Why cast doubt on her high spirits when they light her up like this, why torment her with timid fears? Poor girl, she’s tormented herself long enough. And as the enthusiasm aroused by an orator merely by his words also affects himself, giving him real power, so the confidence that my sympathetic exaggeration had brought into being in the first place increasingly took hold of me. When her father finally appeared he found us all in the most carefree mood; we were talking and making plans as if Edith were already better and perfectly healthy. When would she be able to learn to ride again, she asked, and would some of us in the regiment supervise her lessons and help her? And wasn’t it time for her father to give the priest the money for the new church roof that he had promised? She laughed and amused herself with all these bold new projects, as if a certain cure was only to be expected, laughing and joking in such a carefree way that the last of my reservations were silenced. Only that evening, when I was alone in my room again, did a suppressed memory begin nagging at my mind— wasn’t she going too far, promising herself all this? Oughtn’t I to be sobering her dangerous confidence down? But I wouldn’t let such thoughts trouble me. Why worry whether I had said too much or too little? Even if I had promised far more than in all honesty I should have done—well , that compassionate lie had made her happy, and to make someone happy can never be wrong or a crime.","And so on and on it went like a spring that has been released. I listened in a daze, still utterly bewildered by this incomprehensible transformation in Edith. Her voice was changed, her speech, usually so jerky, was fluent and easy, the face I knew so well seemed to be transfigured, the sickly, pallid flush had given place to a fresh, a more healthy glow, and there was now no trace of angularity in her gestures. It was a slightly intoxicated young girl who was sitting before me, with sparkling eyes and smiling, vivacious mouth. Willy-nilly, I too was infected by this feverish ecstasy, which, like any other form of intoxication, sapped my inner resistance. Perhaps, I deluded myself, it is true, or will be true. Perhaps I haven’t deceived her at all, perhaps she really will be cured as quickly as all that. After all, I have not lied outright, or at least not very much. Condor really has read something about an amazing cure, so why should it not be effective in the case of this radiant and pathetically credulous child, this sensitive being who is made so happy, so rapturous, by the mere mention of recovery? Why seek to dispel this exuberance which so lights up her whole being, why torture her with one’s doubts? After all, the poor child has tormented herself long enough. And just as a speaker finds himself genuinely carried away by the enthusiasm aroused by his own hollow phrases, so now did the confidence which was born solely of my own exaggeration take firmer and firmer root in my own mind. And when at length Kekesfalva appeared, he found us all in the most light-hearted of moods, chattering away and making plans just as though Edith were already restored to health. Where could she learn to ride again? she asked; and would we officers of the regiment supervise her lessons and help her? Yes, and would not her father now give the priest the money which he had promised him for the new church roof? And as she made all these reckless proposals, which took for granted her ultimate restoration to normal health, she laughed and joked away so gaily and irresponsibly that my opposition was completely silenced. And it was only when I found myself alone in my room that night that I heard a faint warning knock on the wall of my heart : were not her hopes a trifle exaggerated? Ought I not to prick the bubble of this dangerous optimism? But I refused to admit the thought to my consciousness. Why worry as to whether I had said too much or too little? Even if I had gone further than in all honesty I should have done, my lies, those lies born of pity, had made her happy; and to make a person happy could never be a crime."
"»Nein, ich riskiere es schon«, antwortete ich.","""No, I'll risk it,"" I replied.","“No, I’ll risk it,” I replied.","‘No, I’ll risk it,’ I replied."

"Der Stoß ist zu unerwartet losgefahren, als daß ich gleich antworten könnte. Aber schon wiederholt sie inquisitorisch:",The shock started too unexpectedly for me to answer right away. But already she repeats inquisitorially:,"This attack comes out of the blue so unexpectedly that I can’t answer at once. But she is already going on, like an inquisitor, “You must have had some special reason just to leave us waiting.","This attack was too sudden for me to be ready with an answer, and before I had time to reply she went on inquisitorially:"
"»Aber gern«, nickt Steinhübel mir lachend zu. »Das seh ich schon, du bringst ihn mir tadellos zurück. Der wird jetzt keine solche Stückeln mehr aufspielen. Bravo, Toni, meinen Respekt!«","""I'd love to,"" Steinhübel nods to me, laughing. “I can see that, you bring it back to me spotless. He won't play any more pieces like that now. Bravo, Toni, my respect!«","“By all means,” says Steinhübel, smiling at me. “I can see you’ll bring him back to me safe and sound, and there’ll be no more playing up from Caesar. Well done, Toni, my compliments!”","‘Why, with pleasure,’ Steinhübel laughed his consent. ‘I can see you’ll bring him back as meek as a lamb. He won’t try any of his tricks again. Bravo, Toni, my congratulations!’"
"Sie behielt den Blick im Schoß, während ich das Brett hinstellte und umständlich, um Zeit zu gewinnen, die Figuren ordnete. Sonst pflegten wir, nach alter Schachregel, um über Angriff oder Verteidigung zu entscheiden, je eine weiße und eine schwarze Figur in der geschlossenen Faust hinter dem Rücken zu verbergen. Aber die Wahl hätte immerhin schon ein Sichansprechen, das eine Wort »rechts« oder »links« gefordert; selbst ihm wichen wir beide einverständlich aus, und ich stellte ohne weiteres die Figuren auf. Nur nicht sprechen! Nur alle Gedanken in das Karree der vierundsechzig Felder einsperren!","She kept her eyes on her lap while I set down the board and, to gain time, rearranged the pieces. Otherwise, according to the old rules of chess, we used to hide a white and a black piece in a closed fist behind the back in order to decide whether to attack or defend. But the election would have required addressing oneself, one word ""right"" or ""left""; we both avoided even him, and I set up the pieces without further ado. Just don't speak! Only imprison all thoughts in the square of sixty-four squares!","She kept her gaze on her lap as I set up the board and, with much ceremony to gain time, put the chessmen in place. To decide who would make the first attacking and the first defensive moves, we generally followed the usual chess custom whereby you hold one white and one black piece behind your back, hidden in your closed fists. But the choice, demanding a spoken “Right” or “Left”, would still mean that we must speak to each other directly, and by common consent we both avoided even that. I just set up the pieces without further comment. We didn’t want to talk, we wanted to confine our thoughts to that board of sixty-four squares, look only at the chessmen, not even at the other player’s fingers moving.","She kept her gaze fixed on her lap as I got out the chessboard and set out the pieces, methodically, so as to gain time. As a rule, in order to decide who should start I held a white and a black chess-man behind my back, one in each fist, according to the rules of the game. But this method of deciding would have necessitated the uttering of the word ‘Right’ or ‘Left’, and even this one word we avoided by tacit agreement. We must avoid speaking at all costs! All our thoughts must be imprisoned within this chequer-board with its four-and-sixty squares."
"»Ja«, wiederholte er ekstatisch, »gesund, bald gesund. Sofort wird sie jetzt reisen, oh, ich bin ganz sicher. Sofort wird sie abreisen und gesund werden, durch Sie gesund, für Sie gesund … von der ersten Stunde an habe ich gewußt, Gott hat Sie mir geschickt … nein, nein, ich kann Ihnen nicht danken … Gott soll es Ihnen lohnen … Ich geh schon … nein, bleiben Sie, bemühen Sie sich nicht, ich geh schon.«","'Yes,' he repeated ecstatically, 'well, soon well. Immediately she will travel now, oh I'm sure. She will leave immediately and be well, healed by you, healed for you...I knew from the first hour that God sent you to me...no, no, I can't thank you...God reward you...I'll go ... no, stay, don't bother, I'll be fine.""","“Oh yes,” he ecstatically repeated, “she must get better, get better soon. She’ll be happy to go away now, oh, I’m sure of that. She’ll be happy to go away at once and get better, because of you, for you … from the first I knew God had sent you to me … no, no, I can’t thank you enough, may God reward you! I’ll go now … no, stay where you are, don’t go to any trouble, I’m leaving.”","‘Yes,’ he echoed ecstatically, ‘she must get well, get well soon. She’ll go away at once now, oh, I’m sure of that! She’ll go away at once and get well, well because of you, for you ... From the very first moment I knew that God had sent you to me ... No, no, I can’t thank you. May God reward you! I’m going now ... No, stay where you are, please don’t trouble. I’m going.’"
"Daß wir viel Aufsehen, aber auch erstaunlichen Respekt auf unserem ganzen Wege erregten, war eigentlich kaum verwunderlich. Seit Jahrzehnten hatte man im ganzen Umkreis nicht mehr die fürstliche Karosse und den Viererzug gesehen, und den Bauern schien ihr unvermutetes Neuauftauchen Vorankündigung eines fast übernatürlichen Ereignisses. Vielleicht dachten sie, wir führen zu Hofe oder der Kaiser sei gekommen oder sonst etwas Unvorstellbares passiert, denn wie weggemäht flogen überall die Hüte herab, begeistert liefen die barfüßigen Kinder uns endlos nach; begegnete uns auf dem Wege ein anderer Wagen, mit Heu beladen, oder eine leichte Landkalesche, so sprang der fremde Kutscher hurtig vom Bock und hielt mit abgerissenem Hut seine Pferde an, um uns vorbeizulassen. Uns gehörte selbstherrlich die Straße, uns wie in feudalen Zeiten das ganze schöne üppige Land mit seinen wogenden Feldern, uns die Menschen und die Tiere. Schnell freilich ging die Fahrt in diesem massigen Vehikel nicht vor sich, aber dafür bot sie doppelte Gelegenheit, viel zu beobachten und zu belachen, und davon machten vor allem die beiden Mädchen ausgiebigen Gebrauch. Immer bezaubert ja das Neue die Jugend, und all diese Ungewöhnlichkeiten, unser sonderbares Gefährt, die devote Ehrfurcht der Leute bei unserem unzeitgemäßen Anblick und hundert andere kleine Zwischenfälle steigerten die Stimmung der beiden zu einer Art Luft-und Sonnenrausch. Insbesondere Edith, die seit Monaten nicht richtig aus dem Hause gekommen war, funkelte ihren unbändigen Übermut hemmungslos in den herrlichen Sommertag hinein.","It was hardly surprising that we attracted a great deal of attention, but also astonishing respect along the way. The princely carriage and the four-in-hand hadn't been seen anywhere in the area for decades, and their unexpected reappearance seemed to the peasants to herald an almost supernatural event. Perhaps they thought we were leading the court, or that the Emperor had come, or that something else unimaginable had happened, because hats were falling everywhere as if they had been mowed, and the barefoot children endlessly ran after us; if we met another wagon laden with hay or a light cart, the unknown coachman jumped down quickly from the box and, with his hat torn off, stopped his horses to let us pass. The road belonged to us, as in feudal times, to us the whole beautiful, lush country with its undulating fields, to us the people and the animals. Of course, the ride in this massive vehicle wasn't quick, but it offered double the opportunity to observe and laugh a lot, and the two girls in particular made extensive use of it. The new always enchants the young, and all these unusual things, our strange vehicle, the submissive respect of the people at our untimely sight and a hundred other little incidents increased the mood of the two to a kind of air and sun intoxication. Edith in particular, who hadn't really left the house for months, sparkled unrestrainedly in her irrepressible high spirits on the beautiful summer day.","It was hardly surprising that we attracted a great deal of attention as we bowled along, but the attention was remarkably respectful. No one in the locality had seen the princely coach and four for decades, and its unexpected reappearance seemed to the farming families to portend some almost supernatural event. Perhaps they thought we were going to court, or the Emperor had come to visit these parts, or something else unimaginable had happened, for hats were swept off everywhere we went as if mown from their wearers’ heads, and the barefoot children ran along after us and wouldn’t stop. If a vehicle coming the other way met us, a heavily laden hay wain or a country horse and trap, the driver would jump quickly down, take off his hat and hold his horses to let us by. We were the autocrats, the road was ours, the whole beautiful, luxuriant countryside with its fields of crops rippling in the wind was ours, the people and the animals were ours. It was like the old feudal times. Admittedly we didn’t make fast progress in that massive vehicle, but that gave us plenty of opportunity to see and laugh at everything, and the two girls seized that opportunity. Novelty always enchants the young, and all these unusual features of the outing, our strange vehicle, the respect shown by the people at the unexpected sight we presented, and a hundred other little things heightened the girls’ good humour until they were almost intoxicated by the fresh air and sunlight. Edith in particular, who hadn’t really been out of the house for months, looked at the wonderful summer day with sparkling eyes, and seemed to be in a mood of boundless high spirits.","It was not to be wondered at that we should have caused a considerable sensation and also have aroused prodigious respect all along our route. The princely four-in-hand had not been seen in the district for decades, and to the peasants its unexpected reappearance seemed to herald some almost supernatural event. They probably thought we were driving to Court, that the Emperor had come, or that some other quite incredible event had occurred, for wherever we appeared hats flew off as though mown down with a scythe, and bare-footed children followed us all the way with shrieks of delight. Whenever we met another vehicle, a cart laden with hay or a ponytrap, its driver would jump nimbly from the box and, doffing his hat, pull in his horses to let us pass. We were the undisputed masters of the road; to us belonged, as in feudal times, the whole lovely, luxuriant countryside with its waving cornfields, its men and beasts. Our rate of progress in the ponderous vehicle, it is true, was far from rapid, but on the other hand, it afforded us all the more opportunity of looking round us and making merry, an opportunity of which the two girls in particular availed themselves to the full. Novelty always delights the young, and all these unaccustomed excitements—our strange carriage, the obsequious awe displayed by the people as they beheld us driving along in our anachronistic equipage, and a hundred-and-one other little incidents — raised the spirits of the two girls to such a pitch that they seemed almost as though drunk — drunk on sun and fresh air. Edith in particular, who had scarcely been out of the house for months, lent a brightness to this marvellous summer’s day with her unrestrained gaiety and high spirits."

"Der alte Mann ist vor dem verlassenen Teetisch stehengeblieben, er blickt mich nicht an, während er spricht. Starr hält er die von den grauen Lidern fast verdeckten Augen auf den Tisch gerichtet. Wie ein Träumender greift er in die offene Zuckerdose, faßt ein viereckiges Stück, dreht es zwischen den Fingern hin und her, starrt es sinnlos an und legt es wieder weg; etwas von einem Trunkenen ist in seinem Gehaben. Noch immer kann er den Blick von dem Teetisch nicht abziehen, als hielte ihn dort etwas Besonderes im Bann. Unbewußt nimmt er einen Löffel, hebt ihn auf, legt ihn wieder hin und spricht dann gleichsam auf den Löffel zu:","The old man has stopped in front of the deserted tea table, he doesn't look at me while he speaks. He keeps his eyes, almost covered by the gray lids, fixed on the table. Like a dreamer he reaches into the open sugar bowl, grasps a square piece, turns it back and forth between his fingers, stares at it senselessly and puts it down again; there is something drunken about him. He still can't take his eyes off the tea table, as if something special is holding him there. Unconsciously he takes a spoon, picks it up, puts it down again and then speaks, as it were, towards the spoon:","The old man is standing beside the abandoned tea trolley. He does not look at me as he speaks. Standing very still, he keeps his eyes, almost hidden by their grey lids, bent on the trolley. As if in a dream he puts his fingers into the sugar bowl and takes out a cube, which he turns this way and that, staring at it pointlessly and then putting it down again, with something of the demeanour of a drunk. He still cannot look up from the tea trolley, as if something on it held him spellbound. Abstractedly, he touches a spoon, picks it up, and then speaks again, apparently to the spoon.","The old man had come to a halt before the deserted tea-table. He did not look at me as he spoke, but kept his eyes, which were almost concealed by the greyish lids, trained rigidly on the table. As though in a dream he dipped into the open sugar-bowl, seized a lump, twirled it between his fingers, stared at it blankly and put it down again; one might almost have thought he had been drinking. He was still unable to withdraw his gaze from the tea-table; some particular object seemed to rivet his attention. Absently he picked up a spoon, put it down again and then said, as though to the spoon:"
"»Nun, dann werde ich mir erlauben, Ihnen meine persönliche Qualifikation einer solchen Handlungsweise mitzuteilen – eine jämmerliche Feigheit wäre ein solches Auskneifen … ach was, zucken Sie nicht gleich militärisch auf! Lassen wir den Herrn Offizier und den Ehrenkodex aus dem Spiel! Hier geht’s schließlich um mehr als um solche Faxereien. Hier geht’s um einen lebendigen, einen jungen, einen wertvollen Menschen, und noch dazu um einen, für den ich verantwortlich bin – unter solchen Umständen habe ich keine Lust und Laune, höflich zu sein. Jedenfalls, damit Sie sich keiner Täuschung hingeben, was Sie mit Ihrem Davonlaufen auf Ihr Gewissen nehmen, sage ich Ihnen nun mit voller Deutlichkeit: Ihr Echappieren in einem so kritischen Augenblick wäre – bitte jetzt nicht weghören! – ein niederträchtiges Verbrechen an einem unschuldigen Wesen, und ich fürchte, sogar mehr noch – es wäre ein Mord!«","'Well, then I'll take the liberty of telling you my personal qualifications for such a course of action - such pitiful cowardice would be such a pinch ... oh, don't flinch militarily! Let's leave the officer and the code of honor out of the game! After all, this is about more than just such faxing. This is a living person, a young person, a person of value, and one for whom I am responsible - under such circumstances I am not in the mood to be polite. In any case, so that you don't let yourself be deceived as to what you're taking on your conscience by running away, I'll tell you with the utmost clarity: Your escape at such a critical moment would be - please don't ignore it now! - a base crime against an innocent creature, and I fear even more - it would be murder!'","“Well, then I’ll allow myself to tell you how I’d describe such a course of action myself—wriggling out of it like that would be pitiful cowardice … Oh, come on, don’t draw yourself up with that military hauteur! We can leave the officer and his code of honour out of this! There’s more at issue here than such nonsense. This is about a living, feeling human being, a young and valuable one at that, and one for whose well-being I am responsible. In such circumstances I feel no inclination at all to keep a civil tongue in my head. At least let me free you of any illusions. With that end in view, I will tell you clearly what you’d be taking on your conscience. Running away at such a critical moment—please don’t close your ears to this!—would be a crime against an innocent being, and I am afraid it would be more—it would be murder!”","‘Well, in that case I will venture to give my personal opinion of such behaviour. Running away like that would be a pitiable act of cowardice ... Oh come on, let’s cut out all that military stuff! Let’s leave an officer ’s code of honour out of it! There’s more at stake here than all that mumbo-jumbo. The happiness of a young, living, valuable human being is at stake, of someone, what is more, for whom I am responsible. In such circumstances I am in no mind to be polite. In any case, so that you may be under no misapprehension as to what you will be taking on your conscience if you make off now, let me tell you quite bluntly: for you to decamp now at this critical moment — please don’t turn away — would be a dastardly crime against an innocent creature, and I fear even more than that — it would be murder!’"
"Sie fuhr jäh empor. Der Mund zuckte, er wußte nicht, ob zu einem Schluchzen oder zu einem bösen Wort. Dann sprang sie plötzlich auf und lief aus dem Zimmer.","She started up suddenly. The mouth twitched, he didn't know whether it was a sob or an angry word. Then she suddenly jumped up and ran out of the room.","“She abruptly sat bolt upright. Her mouth was working, whether in a sob or to say something angry he didn’t know. Then she suddenly jumped up and ran out of the room.","She started abruptly. Her lips twitched, and he could not tell whether she was on the verge of sobbing or flying into a rage. Then she jumped up suddenly and ran out of the room."
"Ich warte. Dasselbe Zimmer, dasselbe Warten wie damals und – gottlob – jetzt von nebenan derselbe leise schleifende Schritt.","I'm waiting. The same room, the same waiting as then and – thank God – now from next door the same soft, dragging footsteps.","I wait. The same room, the same waiting as before, and—thank God—the same quietly dragging footsteps now in the next room.","I waited. The same room, the same long wait as before, and then, thank God, the same soft shuffling step in the next room!"
"»Sechsmal«, begann er, »hatte ich schon an Dich geschrieben und jedesmal jedes Blatt zerrissen. Denn ich wollte mich nicht verraten, ich wollte nicht. Ich hab mich zurückgehalten, solange noch Widerstand in mir war. Wochen und Wochen habe ich mit mir gerungen, mich vor Dir zu verstellen. Jedesmal, wenn Du zu uns kamst, freundlich und ahnungslos, habe ich meinen Händen befohlen, stillzuhalten, meinen Blicken, gleichgültig zu tun, um Dich nicht zu verstören; oft bin ich sogar mit Absicht hart und höhnisch gegen Dich gewesen, nur um Dich nicht ahnen zu lassen, wie sehr mein Herz nach Dir brannte – alles habe ich versucht, was in der Kraft eines Menschen war und über seine Kraft. Aber heute ist es geschehen und ich schwör Dir, wider meinen Willen ist es über mich gekommen, hinterrücks hat es mich überfallen. Ich verstehe selber nicht mehr, wie mir das geschehen konnte; am liebsten hätte ich mich nachher geschlagen und gezüchtigt, so hündisch schämte ich mich. Denn ich weiß ja, ich weiß, welcher Irrwitz, welcher Wahnsinn das wäre, mich Dir aufzudrängen. Eine lahme Kreatur, ein Krüppel hat kein Recht, zu lieben – wie sollte ich zerschlagenes, geschlagenes Wesen Dir nicht zur Last sein, da ich mir selbst doch ein Ekel, ein Abscheu bin? Ein Wesen wie ich, ich weiß, hat kein Recht, zu lieben, und schon gar keines, geliebt zu werden. Im Winkel hat sich’s zu verkriechen und zu krepieren und nicht noch andern mit seiner Gegenwart das Leben zu verstören – ja, alles das weiß ich, ich weiß es und gehe daran zugrunde, daß ich es weiß. Niemals hätte ich darum gewagt, Dich anzufallen, aber wer als Du hat mir die Zuversicht gegeben, ich würde nicht mehr lange dies klägliche Mißgebilde bleiben, das ich bin? Ich würde mich rühren, mich bewegen können wie die andern Menschen, wie alle die Millionen überflüssiger Menschen, die gar nicht wissen, daß jeder freie Schritt eine Gnade ist und eine Herrlichkeit. Eisern hatte ich mir vorgenommen, mich zu verschweigen, bis ich wirklich so weit wäre, ein Mensch, eine Frau wie die andern und vielleicht – vielleicht!!! – Deiner würdig, Du Geliebter. Aber meine Ungeduld, meine Gier, zu genesen, war so toll, daß ich in dieser Sekunde, da Du Dich über mich neigtest, schon glaubte, ehrlich glaubte, ehrlich und närrisch glaubte, jene Andere, jene Neue, jene Genesene zu sein! Ich hatte es eben zu lange gewollt und geträumt und jetzt warst Du mir nah – da vergaß ich für einen Augenblick meine schuftigen Beine, ich sah nur Dich, und fühlte als die, die ich für Dich sein wollte. Kannst Du das nicht verstehen, daß man auch mitten im Tag einen Augenblick lang träumen kann, wenn man Jahr um Jahr immer diesen einzigen Traum träumt, Tag und Nacht? Glaub mir, Geliebter – nur dieser unsinnige Wahn, ich sei schon von meiner Humpelei erlöst, hat mich so wirr gemacht; nur diese Ungeduld, nicht mehr die Ausgestoßene, nicht mehr der Krüppel zu sein, ließ mein Herz derart toll herausfahren aus mir. Begreif’s doch: ich hatte doch schon so lange und so unendliche Sehnsucht nach Dir.","'I've already written to you six times,' he began, 'and torn up every page each time. Because I didn't want to give myself away, I didn't want to. I held back while I still resisted. For weeks and weeks I struggled with myself to pretend to you. Every time you came to us, friendly and unsuspecting, I ordered my hands to hold still, my eyes to look indifferent so as not to upset you; I have often been harsh and scornful to you on purpose, just so you wouldn't suspect how much my heart burned for you - I've tried everything that was in a man's power and beyond his power. But today it happened and I swear to you, it came over me against my will, it attacked me from behind. I myself no longer understand how this could have happened to me; I would have liked to hit and chastise myself afterwards, I was so ashamed of a dog. Because I know, I know what madness, what madness it would be to force myself on you. A lame creature, a cripple has no right to love - how should I not be a burden to you, a bruised, beaten creature, when I am disgusted and disgusted with myself? A being like me, I know, has no right to love, much less to be loved. In the corner it has to crawl and perish and not disturb the life of others with its presence - yes, I know all that, I know it and I perish because I know it. I would never have dared to attack you, but who but you gave me the confidence that I would not remain the miserable monstrosity that I am much longer? I would be able to move like other people, like all the millions of superfluous people who don't even know that every free step is a blessing and a glory. I had firmly resolved to remain silent until I was really ready, a human being, a woman like the others and maybe - maybe!!! - Worthy of you, beloved. But my impatience, my greed, to recover was so mad that in that second, when you bent over me, I already believed, honestly believed, honestly and foolishly believed that I was that other, that new one, that recovered one! I had just wanted and dreamed it for too long and now you were close to me - I forgot my shabby legs for a moment, I only saw you and felt as the one I wanted to be for you. Can't you understand that you can dream for a moment even in the middle of the day when you dream this one dream year after year, day and night? Believe me, my love - it's only this senseless delusion that I've already been redeemed from my hobbling that has made me so confused; only this impatience to no longer be the outcast, no longer the cripple made my heart leap out of me so madly. Understand it: I had been longing for you for so long and so endlessly.","I have written to you six times already, it began and then I always tore the letter up, because I didn’t want to give myself away, not that. I held out as long as I could. I have struggled with myself for weeks and weeks, hiding my feelings from you. Every time you came to see us, so friendly, guessing nothing, I ordered my hands to keep still, my eyes to seem indifferent, so as not to trouble you, and I’ve often been harsh and haughty on purpose, however much my heart was yearning for you —I tried everything in a human being’s power, and even more. But then that happened today, and I swear it came over me against my will. It attacked behind my back. I can’t understand now how it could have happened—afterwards I would have liked to hit myself, chastise myself, I was so dreadfully ashamed. Because I know, I do know what a mad delusion it would be to force myself on you. A lame creature, a cripple has no right to love—how could I, crushed and afflicted as I am, be anything but a burden to you, when I even disgust myself, I hate myself? I know that someone like me has no right to love anyone, and certainly none at all to be loved. She ought to crawl away into a corner and die, not upset other people’s lives with her presence— yes, I do know that, I know it, and it is killing me to know it. I should never have dared to make advances to you, but who but you made me feel sure that I wouldn’t be the pitiful freak I am now for much longer? That I would be able to move and walk about like other people, like all the millions of people who don’t even know what a blessing every step they take by themselves is, what a wonderful thing. I firmly made up my mind to say nothing until it was all real, until I was a woman like any other and perhaps—perhaps!!!!—worthy of you, beloved. But my impatience, my longing to be well again was so mad that in that second when you bent over me I actually believed, I honestly believed, I truly but foolishly believed I was that other girl, the new, healthy girl! I’d wanted it and dreamt of it for so long, and now you were close to me—and for a moment I forgot my horrible legs , I saw only you, I felt like the girl I would want to be for you. Can you understand that even in the middle of the day you can dream for a moment, if you always dream the same dream, day and night, year after year? Believe me, my dear one, only the nonsensical delusion that I was already free of my disability confused me, only that impatience not to be an outcast and a cripple any more let my heart carry me away so crazily. Please understand—I had been longing for you so very much and for such a long time.","‘I have already written you six letters,’ the letter began, ‘and torn them all up. For I did not want to give myself away , I did not want to. I held myself in as long as I had any powers of resistance. For weeks and weeks I struggled to hide my feelings from you. Every time you came to see us, in all friendliness and innocence, I commanded my hands to keep still, my gaze to feign indifference, so as not to upset you; often, even, I deliberately treated you harshly and contemptuously, so that you should have no inkling of how my heart burned for you — I tried everything that lies in the power, and beyond the power, of a human being. But today it happened, and I swear to you that it came over me against my will, it took me by surprise. I myself no longer know how I could let such a thing happen; afterwards I felt like beating and punishing myself, I felt so desperately ashamed. For I know, oh, I know, how mad, how crazy it would be to force myself upon you. A lame creature, a cripple like myself, has no right to love. How should I, broken, shattered being that I am, be anything but a burden to you, when to myself I am an object of disgust, of loathing. A creature such as I, I know, has no right to love, and certainly no right to be loved. It is for such a creature to creep away into a corner and die and cease to make other people’s lives a burden with her presence. Oh yes, I know all that — I know it, and it is because I know it that I am a lost soul. I should never have dared to throw myself at you, but who except you has ever given me any assurance that I should not continue for ever to be the wretched monstrosity that I am? That I should be able to move, to walk about, like other people, like all the millions of superfluous people who simply don’t know that every unimpeded step they take is a blessing and a glory? I had made an iron resolve to preserve silence until I had really reached the point when I was a human being, a woman like other women, and perhaps — perhaps — worthy of you, beloved. But my impatience, my hunger, to get well, was so frantic that at the moment when you bent over me I believed, genuinely believed, honestly and foolishly believed, myself to be that other, that new, that well person! You see, I had wanted and dreamed of being so too long, and then you were near me — and for a moment I forgot my wretched legs , I saw only you, felt myself to be what I wanted to be for your sake. Can’t you understand one’s losing oneself in a day-dream for a moment, when one has dreamed only one dream day and night, year in year out? Believe me, beloved — it was only the crazy illusion that I had cast off my deformity that so went to my head; it was only my impatient yearning not to be an outcast, a cripple, any longer that caused my heart to run away with me so madly. Do understand — I had wanted you so long and so interminably."
"»Und dabei, wie leicht ist es noch heute, sie froh zu machen. An der kleinsten Kleinigkeit kann sie sich freuen wie ein Kind.

Ich weiß genau, niemand ist jetzt mehr verzweifelt als sie selbst, daß sie so unbeherrscht gewesen … Aber wie soll man … wie soll man sich denn beherrschen können … wie soll ein Kind immer wieder Geduld aufbringen, wenn es so langsam vorwärts geht, wie stillhalten, wenn man so geschlagen wird von Gott und hat doch nichts getan … niemandem etwas getan!«","'And how easy it is to make her happy even now.

"Er ließ plötzlich meinen Arm los und starrte mich an. »Was Sie tun sollen? … Verstehen Sie denn wirklich nicht oder wollen Sie nicht verstehen?

"»Nein, nein«, schreie ich verzweifelt hinein. Die Stimme poltert undeutlich noch etwas und verlischt, verliert sich im Leeren. Wieder nur das stupide Surren und Schwingen und dann neuerdings ein wirrer Sprechschatten von fernen, unverständlichen Stimmen: Endlich das Telephonfräulein:","""No, no,"" I yell desperately. The voice rumbles a bit more indistinctly and then fades away, lost in emptiness. Again only the stupid humming and swinging and then recently a confused speech shadow of distant, incomprehensible voices: Finally the telephone lady:","“No, no!” I shout desperately down the telephone. The voice mutters something else indistinct and goes away, is lost in the void. Only that stupid humming and surging again, and then a babble of distant, incomprehensible voices. At last the switchboard operator is back.","‘No,’ I shouted in desperation. The voice rumbled on somewhat indistinctly and then faded out, was lost in the void. Once more that stupid singing and murmuring, and then once again a confused buzz of distant voices. Then I could hear the operator."

Einzig das Essen schien ihn zu beschäftigen, und sein kurzsichtiger Blick visierte gleichzeitig die Weinflaschen.","At the same time he trudged over, sat down without waiting for us, and began to slurp the soup in a hurry – a bit too loud for me – with a serviette that had been stuffed in front of him.

The only thing that seemed to concern him was the food, and his short-sighted gaze simultaneously focused on the wine bottles.","As he spoke he went over to the table, sat down without waiting for the rest of us, tucked his napkin into his neck and began drinking soup—rather too noisily for my liking.

Not a word did he address either to Kekesfalva or to me while thus energetically engaged. His whole attention seemed to be taken up by his food, although his short-sighted gaze rested simultaneously on the bottles of wine."

"»Sonderbar«, murmelte Condor. »Sonderbar. Ich glaubte immer, er habe in seiner Beschreibung Ihrer Person übertrieben. Und daß ich’s Ihnen offen sage – es ist ja anscheinend heut mein Tag der falschen Diagnosen – ich war ein bißchen mißtrauisch gegen seinen Enthusiasmus … Ich konnte es nicht recht glauben, daß Sie nur hingegangen wären wegen des Mißgeschicks bei der Tanzerei und dann immer wieder gekommen … einfach aus Sympathie, aus Anteilnahme. Sie wissen ja nicht, wie der alte Mann ausgebeutet wird – und ich hatte mir vorgenommen (warum soll ich’s Ihnen nicht sagen), herauszukriegen, was Sie eigentlich in dieses Haus zieht. Ich dachte mir, entweder ist das ein sehr – wie soll ich’s höflich ausdrücken – ein sehr absichtsvoller Bursche, der sich seine Wolle scheren will, oder wenn er’s ehrlich meint, dann muß es ein innerlich sehr junger Mensch sein, denn nur auf junge Menschen übt das Tragische und Gefährliche eine so merkwürdige Anziehung aus. Dieser Instinkt ganz junger Menschen behält übrigens fast immer recht, und Sie haben schon ganz richtig gespürt … dieser Kekesfalva ist wirklich ein eigenartiger Mensch. Ich weiß ganz genau, was man gegen ihn vorbringen kann, und nur das kam mir, verzeihen Sie, etwas komisch vor, daß Sie ihn als Edelmann bezeichneten. Aber glauben Sie einem, der ihn besser kennt als alle andern hier – Sie brauchen sich nicht zu schämen, daß Sie ihm und diesem armen Kind so viel Freundschaft bezeugt haben. Was immer man Ihnen auch zutragen sollte, darf Sie nicht irremachen; es hat wirklich keinen Bezug zu dem rührenden, dem erschütternden Menschen, der Kekesfalva heute ist.«","""Strange,"" Condor murmured. ""Strange. I always thought he exaggerated in his description of you. And to be frank with you - it seems today is my misdiagnosis day - I was a little suspicious of his enthusiasm... I couldn't quite believe you'd only gone there because of the mishap at the dancing and then kept coming back ... simply out of sympathy, out of sympathy. You don't know how the old man is exploited - and I had made it my mission (why not tell you) to find out what actually draws you to this house. I thought to myself, either this is a very - how shall I put it politely - a very purposeful fellow who wants to shave his wool, or if he means it honestly, then it must be a very young man at heart, because only practices on young men the tragic and dangerous has such a strange attraction. Incidentally, this instinct of very young people is almost always right, and you have already sensed quite correctly … this Kekesfalva is really a strange person. I know exactly what can be said against him, and the only thing that struck me, pardon me, as odd was that you called him a nobleman. But believe one who knows him better than anyone here - you need not be ashamed of your showing of so much friendship to him and to this poor child. Whatever is brought to you must not mislead you; it really bears no relation to the touching, the harrowing person that Kekesfalva is today.«","“How curious,” murmured Condor. “How very curious. I always thought he was exaggerating in what he said about you. And since this seems to be my day for making the wrong diagnosis, I’ll admit frankly that his enthusiasm made me slightly suspicious. I couldn’t really believe that you were such a regular visitor because of your faux pas in asking Edith to dance, and then you kept going back purely out of pity for her, out of sympathy. You’ve no idea how the old man has sometimes been exploited, and I had made up my mind (why shouldn’t I tell you?) to find out what really draws you to that house. I was thinking— either this is a fellow —how can I put it politely?—a fellow with ulterior motives for trying to fleece the old man, or else he must have the feelings of a very young man, because only the very young are so strangely attracted to tragedy and danger. That instinct of theirs, by the way, nearly always does them credit, and your feelings didn’t deceive you— Kekesfalva really is an unusual man. I know exactly what can be said against him, and all that struck me as rather funny—do please forgive me— was to hear you describe him as a nobleman. But you may believe me—I know him better than anyone else around here—there is nothing for you to be ashamed of in showing such friendship to him and his poor child. Whatever you may yet hear, don’t let it mislead you; it bears no relation to the touching and remarkable character that Kekesfalva is today.”","‘Odd!’ murmured Condor. ‘Odd! I always thought he was exaggerating when describing you. And I may as well tell you frankly — it’s obviously my day for making false diagnoses — I was a little suspicious of his enthusiasm ... I couldn’t really believe that you only went to the house because of that first little mishap, and then went again and again simply out of sympathy, out of friendliness. You’ve no idea how the old man is exploited, and I had made up my mind (why shouldn’t I tell you?) to find out what it actually is that takes you to the house. I thought to myself, either he’s a — how shall I put it politely? — a designing young fellow, who is trying to feather his nest, or, if he does go there in good faith, he must be very young emotionally, for it is only on the young that the tragic and dangerous exerts so curious an attraction. Incidentally, the instinct of really young people in that respect is nearly always right, and you were absolutely on the right track ... Kekesfalva is really quite an exceptional person. I know perfectly well all the things that can be said against him, and it seemed to me, if you’ll forgive my saying so, somewhat funny your referring to him as a nobleman. But, if you will believe someone who knows him better than anyone else here, there’s no need for you to feel ashamed of having shown him and that poor child so much friendliness. You needn’t let whatever anyone says bother you; it really doesn’t apply to the touching, pathetic, moving person that Kekesfalva is today.’"
"Und mit einmal hörte das Zucken auf, alles wurde wieder starr, sie rührte sich nicht mehr. Es war, als ob der ganze Körper wartete, als ob er lauschte, um zu verstehen, was diese fremde Berührung meinte. Ob sie Zärtlichkeit bedeutete oder Liebe oder nur Mitleid. Furchtbar war dieses Warten mit aussetzendem Atem, dieses Warten eines ganzen reglos lauschenden Körpers. Ich fand nicht den Mut, meine Hand zu entfernen, die so wunderbar jäh das aufschwellende Weinen beschwichtigt hatte, und hatte andererseits wieder nicht die Kraft, meine Finger zu einer Zärtlichkeit zu zwingen, die Ediths Körper, ihre brennende Haut – ich fühlte es – so dringlich erwartete. Wie etwas Fremdes ließ ich meine Hand liegen, und mir war, als käme an dieser einen Stelle ihr ganzes Blut mir warm und pulsend entgegen.","And suddenly the twitching stopped, everything went rigid again, she didn't move anymore. It was as if the whole body was waiting, as if listening to understand what that alien touch meant. Whether it meant tenderness, or love, or just pity. This waiting with ragged breathing was terrible, this waiting of a whole, motionless, listening body. I didn't have the courage to remove my hand, which had so wonderfully abruptly calmed the rising weeping, and on the other hand I didn't have the strength to force my fingers into a caress that touched Edith's body, her burning skin - I felt it - that way urgently awaited. I let my hand lie there like something alien, and I felt as if all her blood came to meet me in this one place, warm and throbbing.","Suddenly the trembling stopped. She was still again, unmoving. It was as if her whole body were waiting, were listening, trying to work out what that touch of mine meant. Was it affection, or love, or just sympathy? The way she waited with bated breath was terrifying; as she sat there, her entire motionless body was straining to understand. I could not pluck up the courage to remove my hand now that it had so abruptly calmed her rising storm of tears. But nor could I find the strength to force my fingers to make the tender gesture that Edith’s body, her burning skin—I could feel it—yearned for so much. I left my hand where it was, as if it were not a part of me, and I felt as if all her blood, warm and pulsating, were running towards that one place on her arm.","And suddenly the spasm ceased; she grew rigid again and did not stir. It was as though her whole body were straining to understand what this touch indicated, to know whether it was a gesture of tenderness or of love or merely of pity. It was terrible, this waiting with bated breath, this waiting of a tense, motionless body. I had not the courage to withdraw the hand which had with such marvellous suddenness stilled the paroxysm of sobs, and on the other hand I had not the strength to force from my fingers the caress that Edith’s body, her burning flesh — I could tell — so urgently awaited. I let my hand lie there, as though it were not a part of me, and I felt as though all the blood in her body came surging in a warm pulsating stream to this one spot."
"Nun, aus derart romantischen Gefühlen wurde ich bald erweckt, und zwar auf die allergründlichste Art. Das kam so: Wir hatten an jenem Nachmittag Domino gespielt, dann lange geplaudert und so angeregt die Zeit verbracht, daß wir alle nicht bemerkten, wie spät es geworden war. Endlich, um halb zwölf, blicke ich erschrocken auf die Uhr und empfehle mich hastig. Aber schon während mich der Vater hinaus in die Halle begleitet, hören wir von draußen ein Summen und Brummen wie von hunderttausend Hummeln. Ein veritabler Wolkenbruch trommelt auf das Vordach. »Das Auto bringt Sie hinein«, beruhigt mich Kekesfalva. Ich protestiere, das sei keineswegs nötig; der Gedanke ist mir wirklich peinlich, der Chauffeur solle einzig um meinetwillen jetzt um halb zwölf sich noch einmal anziehen und den schon abgestellten Wagen aus der Garage herausholen (alles dies Nachfühlen und Rücksichtnehmen auf fremde Existenzen ist völlig neu bei mir, ich habe es erst in diesen Wochen gelernt). Aber schließlich liegt doch gute Verlockung darin, in einem weichen, gut gefederten Coupé bei solchem Hundewetter bequem heimzusausen, statt eine halbe Stunde lang triefnaß mit dünnen Lackstiefeletten durch die aufgeschlammte Chaussee zu stapfen: so gebe ich nach. Der alte Mann läßt sich’s nicht nehmen, trotz des Regens mich selbst ans Auto zu begleiten und mir die Decke umzuschlagen. Der Chauffeur kurbelt an; in einem Schwung sause ich durch das trommelnde Unwetter nach Hause.","Well, I was soon awakened from such romantic feelings, and in the most profound way possible. It happened like this: We had played dominoes that afternoon, then chatted for a long time and spent the time so excited that none of us noticed how late it was getting was. Finally, at eleven-thirty, I look at the clock in alarm and hastily make my way. But even as my father accompanies me out into the hall, we hear a buzzing and humming from outside, like a hundred thousand bumblebees. A veritable downpour drums on the canopy. ""The car will take you inside,"" Kekesfalva reassures me. I protest that this is by no means necessary; I'm really embarrassed by the thought that the chauffeur should get dressed again at half past eleven just for my sake and take the already parked car out of the garage (all this empathy and consideration for the existence of others is completely new to me, I only learned it in learned this week). But after all there is good temptation in rushing home comfortably in a soft, well-sprung coupe in such bad weather, instead of trudging through the muddy road for half an hour soaking wet in thin patent-leather ankle boots: so I give in. Despite the rain, the old man insists on accompanying me to the car himself and turning the blanket over me. The chauffeur cranks; in one swoop I rush home through the drumming storm.","Well, I was soon roused from these romantic feelings, and a rude awakening it was. It happened like this. We had been playing dominoes at the Villa Kekesfalva one afternoon, and then fell into cheerful conversation and passed the time in such a lively mood that none of us noticed how late it was. At last, at eleven-thirty in the evening, I looked at the time and hastily took my leave. But as Edith’s father accompanies me out into the hall, we hear a buzzing and humming outside like a hundred thousand bumblebees. A positive cloudburst is drumming down on the porch roof. “The car will take you home,” Kekesfalva assures me. I protest that there’s no need; I really dislike the idea of the chauffeur being roused now, at eleven-thirty, to get dressed again and take out the car he has already put in the garage, just for me. (All this empathising and thinking of other people is entirely new to me, and I have learnt to do it only in the last few weeks.) But after all, it is tempting to think of being whisked home in an upholstered, well-sprung car in such filthy weather, instead of trudging along the muddy road for half-an-hour in my thin patent-leather shoes, dripping wet, so I give in. The old man insists on going to the car with me himself and putting a rug over me. The chauffeur turns the starting handle, and soon I am on my way home at a fast pace through the drumming of the rain.","Well, I was soon to be awakened from romantic emotions of this kind, and pretty thoroughly too. We had been playing dominoes one afternoon, and then had talked and whiled away the time so agreeably that we none of us noticed how late it was. At length, at half-past eleven, I looked up in dismay at the clock and hurriedly took my leave. But as Herr von Kekesfalva accompanied me out into the hall, we heard from outside a humming and droning as of thousands and thousands of bumble-bees. The rain was drumming on the eaves in a regular downpour. ‘The car will take you home,’ Kekesfalva reassured me. That was quite unnecessary, I protested; the thought that the chauffeur should, solely on my account, have to dress again at half-past eleven and get out the car, which had already been put away in the garage, was really distressing to me. (All this consideration for, entering into the feelings of, others was entirely novel to me; I had only acquired the habit during these last few weeks.) But, after all, there was considerable temptation in the thought of whizzing home comfortably in a soft, well-sprung coupé in foul weather like this instead of trudging for half an hour, dripping wet, along the muddy high-road in thin shoes; and so I gave in. Despite the rain, the old man refused to be deterred from seeing me to the car and putting the rug over my knees. The chauffeur started up, and we raced off homewards through the pelting rain."
"Ohne ein weiteres Wort gingen wir die Landstraße zu Ende. Bald machten die ersten Häuser der Stadt im blanken Mondlicht Spalier, und ein freundlicher Zufall wollte, daß wir in den schon ganz verlassenen Gassen keinem einzigen meiner Kameraden begegneten. Ich weiß nicht warum, aber es wäre mir unangenehm gewesen, hätten sie mich am nächsten Tage nach meinem Begleiter gefragt. Seit ich in jene sonderbare Verstrickung geraten, verbarg ich ängstlich jeden Faden, der einen Zugang weisen konnte in das Labyrinth, von dem ich fühlte, daß es mich in immer neue und geheimnisvollere Tiefen verlockte.","Without another word we walked down the country road. Soon the first houses in the town lined up in the bright moonlight, and by a friendly coincidence we didn't meet a single one of my comrades in the already deserted streets. I don't know why, but I would have felt uncomfortable if they had asked me about my companion the next day. Ever since I fell into that strange entanglement, I anxiously hid any thread that might point the way into the labyrinth, which I felt lured me into ever newer and more mysterious depths.","Without another word, we walked all the way down the road into town. Soon the first houses were lining our route in the bright moonlight, and fortunately we met none of my comrades in the already deserted streets. I don’t know why, but I would have felt awkward to be asked next day who my companion had been. Ever since becoming so strangely entangled with the Kekesfalva family, I had been anxiously hiding any thread in the tangle that might lead others to the labyrinth which, I felt, was enticing me into new and ever more mysterious depths.","Without another word we continued on our way down the high-road. Soon the first houses of the town could be seen lined up on each side of us in the bright moonlight, and, as luck would have it, we did not meet any of my friends in the now deserted streets. I do not know why, but I should have found it disagreeable to be cross-questioned the next day about my companion. Ever since I had been caught up in this strange entanglement I had anxiously concealed every thread that might indicate the way into the labyrinth which, I felt, was drawing me down into ever fresh and more mysterious depths."
Kapitel 17,Chapter 17,"I was left alone with the toppled table, the smashed teacups, everything scattered in confusion as if a bolt of lightning had struck out of a clear blue sky, wrecking everything around with its force.","In another minute it was gently whirring its way down again, and I was left alone with the overturned table, the broken cups, the objects that lay scattered about in such confusion that one might have thought a thunderbolt had suddenly fallen out of a perfectly clear sky and sent them flying in all directions."
"Und nun hatte sich plötzlich dies uneingestandene knabenhafte Verlangen, eine Freundschaft statt mit bärtigen, männischen, ungehobelten Kameraden einmal mit jungen Frauen zu erleben, auf die vollkommenste Weise erfüllt. Jeden Nachmittag saß ich, Hahn im Korbe, zwischen den beiden Mädchen; das Helle, das Weibliche ihrer Stimmen tat mir (ich kann es nicht anders ausdrücken) geradezu körperlich wohl, und mit einem kaum zu beschreibenden Glücksgefühl genoß ich zum erstenmal mein eigenes Nichtscheusein mit jungen Mädchen. Denn es steigerte nur das besonders Glückhafte in unserer Beziehung, daß durch eigenartige Umstände jener elektrisch knisternde Kontakt abgeschaltet war, der sich sonst unaufhaltsam bei jedem längeren Zuzweitsein von jungen Leuten verschiedenen Geschlechts ergibt. Völlig fehlte unseren ausdauernden Plauderstunden alles Schwülende, das sonst ein tête-à-tête im Halbdunkel so gefährlich macht. Zuerst freilich – ich gestehe es willig ein – hatten die küßlich vollen Lippen, die fülligen Arme Ilonas, die magyarische Sinnlichkeit, die sich in ihren weichen, schwingenden Bewegungen verriet, mich jungen Menschen auf die angenehmste Art irritiert. Ich mußte einigemal meine Hände in straffer Dressur halten gegen das Verlangen, einmal dies warme, weiche Ding mit den schwarzen, lachenden Augen an mich heranzureißen und ausgiebigst abzuküssen. Aber erstlich vertraute mir Ilona gleich in den Anfangstagen unserer Bekanntschaft an, daß sie seit zwei Jahren einem Notariatskandidaten in Becskeret verlobt sei und nur die Wiederherstellung oder Besserung im Befinden Ediths abwarte, um ihn zu heiraten – ich erriet, daß Kekesfalva der armen Verwandten eine Mitgift zugesagt hatte, falls sie bishin ausharre. Und überdies, welcher Roheit, welcher Perfidie hätten wir uns schuldig gemacht, im Rücken dieser rührenden, ohnmächtig an den Rollstuhl gefesselten Gefährtin kleine Küßlichkeiten oder Handgreiflichkeiten ohne rechte Verliebtheit zu versuchen. Sehr rasch also versickerte der anfängliche sinnlich flirrende Reiz, und was ich an Zuneigung zu empfinden imstande war, wandte sich auf immer innigere Weise der Hilflosen, der Zurückgesetzten zu, denn zwanghaft bindet sich in der geheimnisvollen Chemie der Gefühle Mitleid für einen Kranken unmerklich mit Zärtlichkeit. Neben der Gelähmten zu sitzen, sie im Gespräch zu erheitern, ihren schmalen unruhigen Mund durch ein Lächeln beschwichtigt zu sehen oder manchmal, wenn sie, einer heftigen Laune nachgebend, ungeduldig aufzuckte, schon durch das bloße Auflegen der Hand beschämte Nachgiebigkeit zu erzielen und dafür noch einen dankbaren grauen Blick zu empfangen – solche kleinen Vertraulichkeiten einer seelischen Freundschaft beglückten mich bei dieser Wehrlosen, dieser Kraftlosen mehr, als es die leidenschaftlichsten Abenteuer mit ihrer Freundin vermocht hätten. Und dank dieser leisen Erschütterungen entdeckte ich – wie viele Erkenntnisse verdankte ich schon diesen wenigen Tagen! – mir völlig unbekannte und ungeahnt zartere Zonen des Gefühls.","And now suddenly this unacknowledged boyish desire to experience a friendship with young women instead of with bearded, manly, uncouth comrades had been fulfilled in the most perfect way. Every afternoon I sat between the two girls, rooster in the coop; the light, feminine voices did me (I can't put it any other way) almost physically well, and with a feeling of happiness that could hardly be described I enjoyed for the first time my own not being shy with young girls. For it only increased what was particularly happy in our relationship that, through strange circumstances, that electrically crackling contact that otherwise inevitably arises when young people of different sexes are together for any length of time was cut off. Our long hours of chatting lacked anything sultry that otherwise makes a tête-à-tête in the semi-dark so dangerous. At first, of course - I willingly admit it - the kissably full lips, Ilona's plump arms, the Magyar sensuality that betrayed itself in her soft, swinging movements, had irritated me young people in the most pleasant way. A few times I had to hold my hands tight against the desire to pull this warm, soft thing with the black, smiling eyes towards me and kiss it profusely. But first of all Ilona confided to me in the early days of our acquaintance that she had been engaged to a candidate notary in Becskeret for two years and was only waiting for Edith's health to recover or improve before she could marry him - I guessed that Kekesfalva had given the poor relatives a dowry promised if she held out until then. And besides, what rudeness, what perfidy would we have been guilty of attempting little kisses or fisticuffs without real infatuation behind this touching companion who is bound to a wheelchair in a faint. So the initial sensual shimmering stimulus trickled away very quickly, and whatever affection I was able to feel turned more and more intimately towards the helpless, the neglected, because in the mysterious chemistry of feelings, pity for a sick person is bound imperceptibly to tenderness . To sit next to the paralytic, to amuse her in conversation, to see her thin, restless mouth soothed by a smile, or sometimes, when she gave in to a violent mood and twitched impatiently, to achieve embarrassed compliance by the mere laying on of a hand and that too to receive a grateful gray look - such small intimacy of a spiritual friendship made me more happy with this defenseless, this powerless one than the most passionate adventures with her friend could have done. And thanks to these quiet shocks I discovered - how many insights I owe to these few days! – Zones of feeling that are completely unknown to me and unexpectedly more delicate.","And now, suddenly, the boyish wish, to which I had never admitted, for friendship with young women instead of only with my bearded, uncouth, masculine comrades was granted in full. Every afternoon I sat, cock of the walk, between the two girls. The clear femininity of their voices did me good physically—I don’t know how else to put it—and for the first time, with almost indescribable happiness, I enjoyed losing my timidity with young girls. It only heightened the particular pleasure of our relationship that Edith’s special circumstances ruled out the crackling electrical contact that is usually inevitable when young people of different sexes are together alone for any length of time. Any of the sultry possibilities that otherwise make a tête-à-tête at dusk so dangerous were wholly absent from our long hours of conversation. At first, to be sure, and I readily admit to this, Ilona’s full lips, ripe for kissing, and plump arms, the Magyar sensuousness evident in her graceful movements had intrigued me in very pleasantly. Several times I had to keep my hands firmly under control to resist the desire to draw this soft, warm girl with her laughing black eyes to me and kiss her at length. But for one thing Ilona had told me in the early days of our acquaintance that she had been engaged for two years to a young man training to be a notary in Becskeret, and now was only waiting for Edith to be restored to health or at least improving before she married him. I guessed that Kekesfalva had promised Ilona, the poor relation, a dowry if she would stay until then. Moreover, we would have been guilty of brutality and perfidy to indulge in little kisses or hand-holding without being really in love, behind the back of Ilona’s companion whose plight was so touching, and who was fettered to her wheelchair. So that original hint of intriguing sensuality quickly died down, and what affection I was able to feel was turned more and more on the helpless Edith, for in the mysterious chemistry of emotions pity for an invalid imperceptibly begins to go hand in hand with affection. Sitting beside the lame girl, cheering her up with conversation, seeing her thin, mobile mouth calmed by a smile—if she gave way to a violent impulse and made an impatient gesture, I could shame and mollify her with a touch of my hand and received a look of gratitude from her grey eyes—such little familiarities in a friendship of the mind with this defenceless, helpless girl made me happier than passionate adventures with her friend Ilona would have done. And thanks to these quiet revelations I discovered—how much better I had come to know myself in these few days!—tender areas of emotion wholly unknown to me before, emotions at which I had never guessed. Unknown, tender areas of emotion—but dangerous all the same!","And now all of a sudden that unavowed yearning to form for once a friendship with young women, instead of with moustachioed, male, uncouth fellow-officers, was being fulfilled in the most perfect way. Every afternoon I sat, completely at home, with the two girls; the limpidity, the femininity of their voices, gave me a sense (I cannot express it otherwise) of positively physical wellbeing, and it was with a feeling of almost indescribable happiness that for the first time in my life I enjoyed complete freedom from shyness in the presence of young girls. For the specially happy thing about our relationship was the fact that, because of the unique circumstances, there was none of the galvanic tension which is as a rule inevitably present when two young people of opposite sexes spend a long time in each other’s company. During the long hours when we sat chatting together there was a complete absence of that hot-house atmosphere that usually makes a tête-à-tête in the half-darkness so dangerous. At first, I am bound to admit, the full voluptuous lips, the plump comely arms of Ilona, the Magyar sensuousness revealed in all her soft, lithe movements, had excited me, young fellow that I was, in the most agreeable fashion. More than once I had had to steel my hands against the desire to crush the warm, soft creature with the laughing black eyes just once in my arms and cover her with kisses. But Ilona had confided to me right at the very beginning of our acquaintance that she had been engaged for two years to a law student in Beskeret and was only waiting for some improvement in Edith’s condition, or her complete recovery, to marry him — I gathered that Kekesfalva had promised his poor relation a dowry should she wait until then. And besides, of what crudeness, what perfidy would we not have been guilty if, without being really in love, we had indulged in furtive kissing and hand-holding behind the back of the pathetic creature who was fettered so helplessly to her invalid chair! Ilona’s initial sensuous, tantalizing attraction very soon ceased to trouble me, and whatever I was able to feel in the way of affection was concentrated more and more fervently on the hapless creature with whom life had dealt so harshly, for, inevitably, in the secret chemistry of the emotions the feeling of pity for a sick person is imperceptibly bound up with tenderness. To sit by the lame girl, to cheer her with my conversation, to see her wan, restless mouth soothed by a smile, or at those moments when, yielding to a fit of temper, she would start up impatiently, to reduce her to shamefaced submission by a mere touch of the hand and to receive in return a grateful look from her grey eyes — such little intimacies incidental to my platonic friendship with this helpless invalid made me happier than the most passionate love-affair with another woman could have done. Thanks to these mild spiritual upheavals, I discovered — for how much fresh knowledge had I already to thank these last few days! — tender zones of feeling hitherto completely unknown and unsuspected."
"In seiner Verlegenheit und aus dem Wunsch heraus, ihr dienlich zu sein, erkundigte sich Kanitz, ob sie ihre Ankunft schon telegraphisch vorausgemeldet habe. Nein, oh nein, das würde ihre Leute doch nur erschrecken, die bekämen in Jahren kein Telegramm ins Haus. Aber es seien doch nahe Verwandte, fragte Kanitz weiter. Nahe Verwandte – nein, durchaus nicht. Eine Art Nichte, die Tochter ihrer verstorbenen Stiefschwester; den Mann kenne sie überhaupt nicht. Sie bestellten ein kleines Landgut mit einer Imkerei, und beide hätten sehr freundlich geschrieben, sie könne ein Zimmer dort haben und bleiben, solange es ihr gefiele.","In his embarrassment and wanting to be of service to her, Kanitz inquired whether she had telegraphed her arrival in advance. No, oh no, that would only frighten your people, they wouldn't be getting a telegram in their house for years. But they were close relatives, Kanitz continued. Close relatives - no, not at all. Kind of a niece, the daughter of her late stepsister; she doesn't know the man at all. They hired a small estate with an apiary, and both wrote very kindly that she could have a room there and stay as long as she liked.","“In his embarrassment, and out of a wish to be useful to her in some way, Kanitz asked whether she had telegraphed ahead to announce her arrival. No, oh no, her family would only take fright—they hadn’t received a telegram for years. But he presumed they were close relations, Kanitz enquired further. Close relations? … No, not at all close. A kind of niece, her late stepsister’s daughter. She didn’t know the niece’s husband at all. They had a little place in the country where they kept bees, and they had both written in a very friendly way, she said, telling her she could have a room there and stay as long as she liked.","In his embarrassment, and out of a desire to be of service to her, Kanitz inquired whether she had sent a telegram to announce her arrival. No, oh no, that would only frighten her people, they never got a telegram from one year’s end to another. But surely they were near relatives? asked Kanitz. Near relatives — no, by no means. A kind of niece, the daughter of her late step-sister; the husband she did not know at all. They had a small farm, with an apiary, and they had written very kindly to say she could have a room there and stay as long as it suited her."
"»Gefällt Ihnen nicht sonderlich, fürchte ich! Desillusioniert Ihre Vorstellung vom Arzt als Helfer und Wahrheitsmann! Haben sich in jugendlicher Begeisterung die medizinische Moral anders vorgestellt und sind jetzt etwas, ich merke es ja … ernüchtert oder sogar degoutiert von derlei Praktiken! Aber bedaure – Medizin hat mit Moral nichts zu tun: jede Krankheit ist an sich ein anarchischer Akt, eine Revolte gegen die Natur, deshalb darf man gegen sie alle Mittel einsetzen, alle. Nein, kein Mitleid mit Kranken – der Kranke stellt sich selbst hors de la loi, er verletzt die Ordnung, und um die Ordnung, um ihn selber wiederherzustellen, muß man, wie bei jeder Revolte, rücksichtslos zugreifen – was einem gerade in die Hand kommt, muß man nützen, denn mit der Güte und der Wahrheit ist noch nie die Menschheit und nie ein einzelner Mensch geheilt worden. Wenn ein Schwindel kuriert, so ist er eben kein erbärmlicher Schwindel mehr, sondern ein erstklassiges Medikament, und so lange ich in einem Fall nicht faktisch helfen kann, muß ich eben trachten, bloß hinüberzuhelfen. Auch das ist schon keine leichte Sache, Herr Leutnant, immer eine neue Walze zu drehen, fünf Jahre lang, besonders wenn man von seiner eigenen Kunst nicht sehr erbaut ist! Jedenfalls wird für Komplimente ergebenst gedankt!«","'You don't like it very much, I'm afraid! Disillusioned with your idea of the doctor as a helper and a man of truth! With youthful enthusiasm, they imagined medical ethics differently and are now, I can tell, a little disillusioned or even disapproved of such practices! But I'm sorry - medicine has nothing to do with morality: every illness is in itself an anarchic act, a revolt against nature, so you can use all means against it, all of them. No, no sympathy for the sick - the sick turn themselves into hors de la loi, they violate order, and to restore order, to restore order themselves, one must, as in every revolt, ruthlessly seize - whatever comes to one's hand , one must use, because mankind and never an individual person has never been healed with kindness and truth. When a dizziness is cured, it's no longer a pitiful dizziness, but a first-class drug, and as long as I can't actually help in a case, I just have to try to help. That's not an easy thing either, Herr Leutnant, always turning a new reel for five years, especially if you're not very impressed by your own art! In any case, compliments are gratefully acknowledged!«","“I’m afraid you don’t like that very much. It doesn’t fit your idea of the doctor as a healer who always tells the truth. In your youthful idealism you didn’t see medical morality as quite like this, and now I can tell that you are … brought down to earth, or even repelled by such practices! I’m sorry, but medicine has nothing to do with morality. In itself every disease is an act of anarchy, a rebellion against nature, and that’s why we may legitimately use any means of combating it, any means. No, don’t bother with feeling sorry for the sick—the invalid regards himself as outside the law, he upsets the natural order of things, and as with any rebellion we must act ruthlessly to restore order—we must use any weapon that comes to hand, because mankind as a whole and human beings as individuals will never be cured by kindness and the truth alone. If a deception will help the sick then it’s not a pitiful pretence any more, but the best of medicine, and as long as I can’t cure a case in fact, I must see how I can help the patient to endure it. And that’s no easy matter, Lieutenant, thinking up new ideas for five years, particularly when you’re not especially enthusiastic about your own skills. So never mind the compliments!”","‘I fear you’re not altogether pleased, eh? I’ve destroyed your conception of a doctor as a helper of mankind and fount of truth? You in your youthful enthusiasm had had a very different notion of medical morality, and are now — oh, I can tell! — disillusioned and even revolted at the thought of such practices. I am sorry, but medicine has nothing to do with morals; every illness is in itself an anarchistic phenomenon, a revolt against Nature, and one must therefore employ every means to fight it, every means. No, no pity for the sick — the sick person places himself outside the law, he offends against law and order, and in order to restore law and order, to restore the sick person himself, one must, as in the case of every revolt, attack ruthlessly, employ every weapon at one’s command, for goodness and truth have never yet succeeded in curing humanity or even a single human being. If a deception helps, then it is no longer a shabby deception but a first-class remedy, and so long as I am unable to do any actual good in a particular case, I must try at least to help the patient to carry on. It’s no easy task, either, Herr Leutnant, to keep on breaking fresh ground for five whole years, particularly when you’re not too pleased with your own skill. In any case, I beg you to spare me your compliments!’"
»Sie glauben also doch an eine Besserung – das heißt … eine gewisse Besserung haben Sie ja schon erzielt?«,“So you do believe in an improvement – that is… you have already achieved a certain improvement?”,"So I asked, “Then you think that you have already made progress—I mean some progress in her improvement?”","‘You think there is a possibility of an improvement, then — that is to say ... you have already achieved a certain degree of improvement, haven’t you?’"
Sofort spannten sich wieder die Brauen. »Fragen Sie nicht immer so tolpatschig! Uns besuchen! Mich besuchen!«,"Immediately the brows tightened again. ""Don't always ask such clumsy questions!

"Ungeduldig streicht Kanitz von einer Tür zur andern herum, ruft, klatscht in die Hände – niemand, niemand! Endlich, durch die kleine Seitentür sich anpirschend, erblickt er im Glashaus eine Weibsperson. Durch die Scheiben sieht er nur, daß sie Blumen begießt – endlich irgend jemand also, der Auskunft geben kann. Kanitz klopft grob an die Scheibe. ›Hallo‹, ruft er hinein und patscht in die Hände, um sich bemerkbar zu machen. Das weibliche Wesen, das sich drinnen mit den Blumen beschäftigt, schrickt auf, und es dauert eine Weile, ehe sie schüchtern, als hätte sie etwas angestellt, sich bis an die Tür wagt; eine blonde, unjunge, schmale Frauensperson in einer einfachen dunklen Bluse mit vorgebundener Kattunschürze, steht sie jetzt zwischen den Pfosten, die Gartenschere noch halb offen in der Hand.","Impatiently, Kanitz moves from one door to the other, shouts, claps his hands - nobody, nobody! Finally, stalking through the small side door, he sees a woman in the glass house. Through the panes he only sees her watering flowers - finally someone who can provide information. Kanitz knocks roughly on the pane. 'Hello,' he calls in, clapping his hands to draw attention to himself. The female who is busy with the flowers inside is startled and it takes a while before she dares to go to the door shyly, as if she has done something wrong; a blond, unyoung, slender woman in a simple dark blouse with a calico apron tied to the front, she is now standing between the posts, the pruning shears still half open in her hand.","“Kanitz goes impatiently from door to door, calling out, clapping his hands—no one, not a soul. At last, cautiously looking in through the side door, he sets eyes on a woman in the conservatory. He can see her through the panes, watering flowers—at last, someone who can give him information. Kanitz taps sharply on the glass. “Hello,” he calls, clapping his hands to attract attention. The female busy with the flowers starts in alarm, and it is some time before, as timidly as if she has done something wrong, she approaches the door. Blonde, slender, no longer young, wearing a plain dark blouse and a cotton apron, she is now framed in the doorway, still holding the half-open garden scissors.","Kanitz wandered impatiently from one door to another, shouted, clapped his hands — not a sign of anyone. At last, stealing in through the little side-door, he caught sight of a female in the conservatory. All he could see through the glass was that she was watering plants. Here was someone at last who could give him some information! Kanitz knocked sharply on the glass. ‘Hallo!’ he shouted, and clapped his hands to attract her attention. The female who was busied with the plants gave a start, as though caught out in doing something wrong, and it was some time before she ventured timidly to the door. A fair-haired, slender female, no longer in her first youth, dressed in a simple dark blouse and cotton apron , she stood there framed in the doorway, the garden-shears still held half-open in her hand."
"»Natürlich – eine Upman! Billiger gibst du’s nicht! Ich glaub’, eine Zigarette dritter Sorte wird’s dir auch tun«, und halte ihm offen die Tabatière hin. Doch im selben Augenblick zuckt mir schon die Hand. Denn vorgestern war mein fünfundzwanzigster Geburtstag gewesen, irgendwie hatten die beiden Mädel das herausspekuliert, und bei dem Abendessen, als ich von meinem Teller die Serviette aufhob, spürte ich etwas Schweres darin eingefaltet: eine Zigarettendose als Geburtstagsgeschenk. Aber schon hatte der Ferencz das neue Etui bemerkt – in unserem engen Klüngel wird ja auch die kleinste Kleinigkeit zum Ereignis.","'Of course - an Upman! You won't give it any cheaper! I think a third kind of cigarette will do the trick for you, too«, and openly hold out the snuff box to him. But at the same moment my hand twitches. Because the day before yesterday was my twenty-fifth birthday, the two girls had somehow figured that out, and at dinner, when I picked up the napkin from my plate, I felt something heavy folded into it: a cigarette case as a birthday present. But Ferencz had already noticed the new case - in our close-knit clique, even the smallest little thing becomes an event.","“Oh, of course, an Upmann! Won’t you be happy with anything less? I can offer you one of our ordinary cigarettes.” And I open my cigarette case and hold it out to him. At the same moment my hand suddenly jerks back—the day before yesterday happened to be my twenty-fifth birthday, and somehow or other the two girls had worked that out. When I took the napkin off my plate at dinner, I felt something heavy folded into it—a birthday present of a cigarette case. But Ferencz has already noticed my new acquisition—the least little thing is a great event in our closed circle.","‘Why, of course — an Upmann! The best is good enough for you, my boy! ’ Fraid you’ll have to make shift with one of our so-called Egyptians.’ And I offered him my cigarette-case. But even as I did so my hand drew back with a jerk. The day before yesterday had been my twenty-fifth birthday; the girls had somehow managed to find it out, and at dinner, as I had lifted my table-napkin from my plate, I had felt something heavy wrapped up in it: a birthday present of a cigarette-case. But Ferencz had already spotted the new acquisition — in our little set the most trifling incident was magnified into an event."
"Einen Augenblick herrscht Schweigen. Sie blicken einander überrascht und, ich glaube, ein bißchen enttäuscht an. Offenbar habe ich ihnen einen Spaß verdorben. Aber ganz stolz stemmt Ferencz die Ellbogen auf den Tisch und brüllt triumphierend:","There is silence for a moment. They look at each other in surprise and, I think, a little disappointed. Apparently I spoiled their fun. But Ferencz proudly puts his elbows on the table and roars triumphantly:","Silence reigns for a moment. They look at one another, surprised and, I think, slightly disappointed. Obviously I’ve spoilt their fun. However, Ferencz props his elbows on the table and bellows proudly, triumphantly,","For a moment there was silence. They all gazed at one another in surprise and, I imagine, in some disappointment. I had obviously spoilt their fun for them. But Ferencz proudly propped his elbows on the table and roared triumphantly:"
"Der junge Mensch, der so heftig erzählte und jenen Trompetenstoß der Entrüstung ausgestoßen, dank dessen Kanitz munter geworden war, stellte sich als der Schreiber eines Wiener Anwalts heraus, und sein Ärger über den riesigen Schnapp seines Chefs ließ ihn ganz aufgeregt perorieren:","The young man who talked so vehemently and threw out that trumpet blast of indignation that made Kanitz perk up turned out to be the clerk of a Viennese lawyer, and his anger at his boss's huge snap made him perorate excitedly:","“The young man speaking with such animation, the man whose indignant trumpet call had alerted Kanitz, turned out to be a clerk in a Viennese lawyer’s chambers, and his amazement at his employer’s huge stroke of luck lent him eloquence.","The young man who had been talking away with such vehemence and had let out the trumpet blast of indignation which had caused Kanitz to prick up his ears was, it transpired, a clerk in the office of a Viennese lawyer, and in his anger at his employer’s amazing luck he continued to hold forth in excited tones:"
"Nicht im flüchtigsten Tagtraum war mir je denkbar erschienen, auch mich könnte eine Frau so maßlos lieben. Zwar war ich oft dabeigesessen, wenn Kameraden protzig erzählten, wie diese oder jene ihnen »nachlief«; ich hatte vielleicht bei der indiskreten Wiedergabe solcher Zudringlichkeit im erheiterten Chore sogar mitgelacht, denn damals ahnte ich noch nicht, daß jede Form der Liebe, auch die lächerlichste und absurdeste, Schicksal eines Menschen ist und man auch durch Gleichgültigkeit in Schuld gerät gegen Liebe. Aber alles Erlauschte und Angelesene streift doch nur kraftlos an einem vorbei; nur aus eigenem Erleben vermag das Herz das Wesentliche des Gefühls zu erlernen. Erst mußte ich selbst die Not erfahren, die eine fremde, unsinnige Liebe dem Gewissen auflastet, um Mitleid zu fühlen mit dem einen und dem andern, mit jenem, der gewaltsam sich andrängt, und jenem, der gewaltsam sich dieses Überschwangs erwehrt. Aber in welch unausdenkbarer Steigerung war hier gerade mir diese Verantwortung zugeteilt! Denn wenn es an sich schon Grausamkeit bedeutet und beinahe Roheit des Herzens, eine Frau in ihrer Neigung zu enttäuschen, um wieviel furchtbarer dann das »Nein«, das »Ich will nicht«, das ich diesem hitzigen Kinde sagen sollte! Eine Kranke mußte ich kränken, eine vom Leben ohnehin schon schmerzhaft Verletzte noch tiefer verwunden, einer innerlich Unsicheren noch die letzte Krücke Hoffnung, mit der sie sich aufrechterhielt, wegreißen. Ich wüßte, wie ich dieses Mädchen, das allein mein Mitleid erschüttert hatte, gefährdete und vielleicht zerstörte, wenn ich mich flüchtend ihrer Liebe entzog; grauenhaft klar war ich von vorneweg der ungeheuren Schuld bewußt, die ich wider meinen Willen beging, wenn ich, unfähig, ihre Liebe hinzunehmen, nicht wenigstens vortäuschte, sie zu erwidern.","Not in the most fleeting daydream had it ever appeared to me that a woman could love me so immeasurably. It is true that I often sat there when my comrades ostentatiously told how this or that ""chased after"" them; I might even have laughed at the indiscreet rendition of such importunity in the amused chorus, because at that time I had no idea that every form of love, even the most ridiculous and absurd, is a person's destiny and that one also becomes guilty of indifference towards love. But everything that has been heard and seen just brushes past you powerlessly; The heart can only learn the essentials of feeling from its own experience. First I had to experience myself the need that a strange, senseless love weighs on my conscience, in order to feel pity for one and the other, for those who forcefully push themselves forward and those who forcefully resist this exuberance. But to what an unthinkable degree this responsibility was assigned to me! For if it is in itself cruelty and almost rudeness of heart to disappoint a woman in her inclination, how much more dreadful the 'No', the 'I don't want' I should say to this hot-tempered child! I had to hurt a sick woman, wound someone who was already painfully injured by life even more deeply, tear away the last crutch of hope she was using to keep herself alive from someone who was insecure inside. I knew how I would endanger and perhaps destroy this girl, who alone had shaken my pity, if I fled from her love; I was horrifically aware in advance of the immense guilt I committed against my will if, unable to accept her love, I did not at least pretend to return it.","Not in my most fleeting daydreams had I ever imagined that a woman might love me so fiercely. Of course I had often heard comrades boasting of how this or that girl was “running after them”, perhaps I had even laughed cheerfully with the others at the indiscreet tales told of such immodest advances, because at the time I didn’t yet know that every form love takes, even the most ridiculous and absurd, involves the life of another human being, and even indifference leaves you running up a debt to love. But what you have only heard and read easily passes you by, and the heart can learn the essential reality of feeling only from personal experience. I had to discover for myself the painful dilemma of having someone else’s passionate love on my conscience before I could feel sympathy for both parties—one forcing itself on the other’s notice, the second forcefully defending itself against the overwhelming emotion of the first. But what an unimaginable excess of responsibility I bore in this case! For if it takes a cruel and almost brutal heart to disappoint a woman’s affections, how much more terrible was the “No”, the “I don’t want to”, that I must say to that impetuous child! I had to injure someone already injured, inflict an even deeper wound on someone already painfully wounded, snatch away the last crutch of hope from a girl whose inner resources were not strong. I knew that if I fled from the love of this child who had inspired only pity in me, I would be endangering and perhaps destroying her. I was aware at once, with cruel clarity, how monstrously guilty I would be if, although I could not accept her love, I did not at least make some pretence of responding to it.","Not in the most fleeting day-dream had it ever seemed conceivable to me that I too could be so boundlessly loved by a woman. I had , it is true, heard my friends brag how this woman or that ‘ran after’ them; I may even have joined in the general amusement aroused by such indiscreet revelations of female importunacy, for at that time I had had no idea that every form of love, even the most ridiculous and absurd, is the destiny of someone, and that even by one’s indifference one can incur a debt to love. But all that one has heard and read passes one by; it is only from personal experience that the heart can learn the true nature of its emotions. I had to experience for myself the burden of misery that the hopeless love of another imposes on one’s conscience in order to feel pity with either the woman who forces her love upon a man, or the man who vigorously defends himself against her unwelcome passion. But how inconceivably greater was the responsibility that had fallen to my lot! For if in itself it is cruelty, brutality almost, to disappoint a woman where her emotions are concerned, how much more horrible, then, was the ‘No’ that I should have to utter to this passionate child. I should have to hurt a cripple, to wound more deeply than ever one who had already been grievously wounded by Life, to snatch from one who was inwardly unsure of herself the last crutch of hope with which she kept herself erect. I knew that by fleeing from her love I should perhaps imperil the life and the reason of this girl who had aroused in me so pure an emotion of pity. I was gruesomely aware of the monstrous crime that I should, against my will , be committing if, incapable though I was of returning her love, I did not at least make some show of responding to it."

"Dieser Oberst Svetozar Bubencic, hinter dem ich jetzt wie ein hingeschlagener Schatten durch die matt von Petroleumlampen erhellten, dumpf leeren und doch vom Dunst vieler Menschen gesättigten Gänge und Treppen schritt, war ein hundertgrädiger Troupier und der gefürchtetste unter unseren Vorgesetzten. Kurzbeinig, kurzhalsig, kurzstirnig, verbarg er unter den struppigen Brauen ein Paar tiefsitzende glimmrige Augen, die selten jemand heiter gesehen. Der stämmige Leib, der schwere, massive Gang verrieten unverkennbar seine bäuerliche Abstammung (er kam aus dem Banat). Aber mit dieser niederen Büffelstirn und seinem eisenharten Schädel hatte er sich langsam und beharrlich bis zum Oberst vorgestoßen. Seiner krassen Unbildung, seiner rüden Sprech-und Schimpfweise und seiner wenig repräsentablen Art wegen schob ihn freilich seit Jahren das Ministerium von einer Provinzgarnison in die andere, und daß er vor den roten Generallampassen noch den blauen Bogen kriegen würde, galt in diesen oberen Regionen soviel wie ausgemacht. Doch unansehnlich und ordinär, wie er war, in der Kaserne und auf dem Exerzierplatz kam ihm keiner gleich. Er kannte den kleinsten Paragraphen des Reglements wie ein schottischer Puritaner die Bibel, und sie bedeuteten für ihn keineswegs elastische Gesetze, die eine feinere Hand zu harmonischem Gefüge verknüpft, sondern fast religiöse Gebote, deren Sinn oder Widersinn ein Soldat nicht zu erörtern hatte. Er lebte im allerhöchsten Dienst wie Gläubige in Gott, er gab sich nicht mit Frauen ab, er rauchte nicht, er spielte nicht, hatte zeitlebens kaum ein Theater oder Konzert besucht und gleich seinem allerhöchsten Kriegsherrn Franz Joseph niemals etwas anderes gelesen als das Dienstreglement und Danzers Armeezeitung; für ihn existierte nichts auf Erden als die kaiserlich und königliche Armee, innerhalb der Armee nur die Kavallerie, innerhalb der Kavallerie nur die Ulanen und unter den Ulanen nur eines, nur sein Regiment. Daß alles bei diesem seinem Regiment besser als bei jedem andern klappen sollte, war in nuce der Sinn seines Lebens.","This Colonel Svetozar Bubencic, behind whom I now walked like a fallen shadow through the dull, empty corridors and stairs dimly lit by kerosene lamps and yet saturated with the haze of many people, was a hundred-degree troupier and the most feared of our superiors. Short-legged, short-necked, short-foreheaded, he hid a pair of deep-set glowing eyes under his shaggy brows, which seldom anyone saw cheerfully. The stocky body and the heavy, massive gait unmistakably betrayed his peasant origins (he came from the Banat). But with that low buffalo forehead and iron skull, he had slowly and persistently worked his way up to colonel. Because of his blatant lack of education, his rude way of speaking and scolding, and his unremarkable manner, the ministry had been pushing him from one provincial garrison to another for years, and that he would still get the blue bow before the red general lampassen was so much valid in these upper regions as agreed. But unsightly and vulgar as he was, in the barracks and on the parade ground no one equaled him. He knew the smallest paragraph of the regulations like a Scottish Puritan the Bible, and for him they by no means meant elastic laws that a finer hand linked to form a harmonious structure, but almost religious commandments, the sense or nonsense of which a soldier did not have to discuss. He lived in the highest service like believers in God, he did not associate with women, he did not smoke, he did not play, had hardly ever attended a theater or concert in his life and, like his highest warlord Franz Joseph, never read anything but the service regulations and Danzers army newspaper; for him nothing existed on earth but the imperial and royal army, within the army only the cavalry, within the cavalry only the Uhlans and among the Uhlans only one, only his regiment. That everything should work out better with his regiment than with any other was, in nuce, the meaning of his life.","Colonel Svetozar Bubencic was one hundred per cent a soldier of the old school, and the most feared among all our superior officers. Short-legged and bull-necked, he had a low forehead, and under those bushy brows a pair of sharp, deep-set eyes that had seldom been known to look at anyone with favour. His sturdy body and heavy, massive stature unmistakably betrayed his rustic origins (he came from the Banat area of the Balkans), but with that low, bovine forehead and iron skull he had slowly and doggedly made his way up through the army to reach the rank of colonel. It was true that his lack of any cultural education, his rough tongue, his profanity and his unpolished manners had kept the Ministry posting him to a series of provincial garrisons for years, and it was tacitly agreed in high places that he would never rise to become a general. Unpolished and plain-spoken as he was, however, there was no one to match him in the barracks or on the parade ground. He knew every last paragraph of the army rules as well as any puritan Scot knows his Bible, and never regarded them as elastic precepts that could be adjusted for the sake of harmony; he saw them almost as religious commandments to be accepted without question by every soldier. He devoted himself to his military service as the faithful devote themselves to God, he did not indulge in amorous adventures, he neither smoked nor gambled, he had hardly ever been inside a theatre or a concert hall in his life, and like his supreme commander Emperor Franz Joseph he had never read anything but the army rules and Danzer’s Army Gazette. Nothing on earth mattered to him outside the Imperial and Royal Austrian Army, and within the army the cavalry, within the cavalry only the lancers, and among the lancers only one regiment, his own. The whole point of his life was to ensure that everything in this regiment of his functioned more smoothly than in any other.","Colonel Svetozar Bubencic, whom I followed like a shadow up the dimly-lit corridors and barrack stairs which, although they now rang hollow and empty, still reeked of masculinity, was a thorough-going martinet and the most feared of all the senior officers. Short-legged, bull-necked, low-browed, he concealed beneath bristling eyebrows a pair of deep-set, smouldering eyes which had seldom been known to twinkle. The stocky body and heavy, ponderous gait unmistakably betrayed his peasant origin (he came from the Banat). But with his low, ox-like forehead and iron skull he had slowly and perseveringly worked his way up to the rank of Colonel. Because of his utter lack of culture, his rude speech, his crude abusiveness and rough-and-ready manners, the War Ministry, it is true, had for years transferred him from one provincial garrison to another, and it was taken for granted in higher quarters that he would be retired before reaching the rank of General. But unattractive and plebeian as he was, he had not his equal in the barracks or on the parade-ground. He knew every line of the service regulations as a Scottish Presbyterian knows his Bible; to him, far from being elastic laws to be adapted at discretion, they were almost religious commandments, the meaning or lack of meaning of which it was not a soldier’s place to question. His life was dedicated to the service as is that of a believer’s to God. He had no truck with women, he neither smoked nor played cards, he had scarcely ever in his life been to a theatre or concert, and, like his Imperial Commander-in-Chief, Francis Joseph, he never read anything but the army regulations and the military gazette. Nothing existed for him on earth but the Imperial Army, in that army nothing but the cavalry, in the cavalry nothing but the Uhlans, and among the Uhlans only his own regiment. That everything in his own regiment should be better than in any other was, in a nutshell, the whole aim and object of his existence."
"Dann wandert Balinkay rings um den Tisch, das Glas in der Hand, um mit jedem einzeln anzustoßen. Mit einmal spüre ich mich, von meinem Nachbarn energisch aufgestupft, einem Paar hellgrüßender Augen entgegen: »Servus, Kamerad.« Ich nicke benommen zurück; erst als Balinkay schon beim Nächsten hält, merke ich, daß ich vergessen habe, mit ihm anzustoßen. Doch schon ist alles wieder im bunten Nebel verschwunden, der mir Gesichter und Uniformen so sonderbar verschwommen durcheinandermengt. Donnerwetter – was ist denn das mit einem Mal für ein blauer Rauch vor meinen Augen? Haben die andern schon angefangen zu qualmen, daß mir’s plötzlich so stickig heiß wird? Etwas trinken, rasch trinken! Ein, zwei, drei Gläser stürze ich hinab, ohne zu wissen, was ich trinke. Nur das Bittere, das Üblige erst einmal weg aus der Kehle! Und selber rasch was rauchen! Aber da ich in die Tasche fahre nach der Zigarettendose, spüre ich wieder das Knistern unter dem Rock: der Brief! Meine Hand zuckt zurück. Abermals höre ich durch das wüste Getümmel nur die schluchzenden, die flehenden Worte: »Nur erlauben sollst Du mir, Dich zu lieben … ich weiß ja, es ist Wahnsinn, mich Dir anzudrängen …«","Balinkay then wanders around the table, glass in hand, toasting each one individually. Suddenly I feel myself, energetically patted down by my neighbor, facing a pair of brightly greeting eyes: ""Servus, comrade."" I nod back in a daze; only when Balinkay stops at the next one do I realize that I forgot to clink glasses with him. But everything has already disappeared again in the colorful fog that mixes up faces and uniforms in such a strangely blurred way for me. Gosh - what's that blue smoke in front of my eyes all of a sudden? Have the others already started to smoke that I suddenly feel so hot and stuffy? Drink something, drink quickly! I down one, two, three glasses without knowing what I'm drinking. Only the bitter, the usual away from the throat! And quickly smoke something yourself! But as I reach into my pocket for the cigarette case, I feel the crackling under my skirt again: the letter! My hand jerks back. Again, through the tumult, all I hear are the sobbing, pleading words: ""You should only allow me to love you... I know it's madness to press on you...""","Then Balinkay walks up and down the table, glass in hand, drinking a separate toast with every one of us. Suddenly, feeling my neighbour nudge me hard, I meet a pair of bright grey eyes. “Hello there, friend!” Bemused, I return his nod, and only when Balinkay stops at the next man along do I realise that I forgot to clink glasses with him. But it has all disappeared again into a multicoloured fog, through which I see faces and uniforms merging in a curious blur. Good heavens— what’s that blue mist in front of my eyes all of a sudden? Have the others already begun smoking, is that why I feel it’s so hot and stuffy in here? Quick, I must drink something. I gulp down the contents of one, two, three glasses without even knowing what is in them. I just have to rid my throat of that foul, bitter taste. And I must smoke a cigarette quickly myself. But when my hand goes to my pocket for my cigarette case, I feel the faint rustle of the letter again, and I snatch my hand back. Once again, through the cheerful noise, I hear only the sobbing, pleading words: “I do know, what a mad delusion it would be to force myself on you …”","Glass in hand, Balinkay strolled round the table to clink glasses with each of us. All of a sudden, pushed forward energetically by my neighbour , I found myself gazing into a pair of bright friendly eyes: ‘Servus, Comrade!’ I nodded back in a stupor; and only when Balinkay had passed on to the next man did I realize that I had omitted to clink glasses with him. But everything had already vanished in the rainbow mist in which faces and uniforms were so strangely blurred and jumbled together. Good heavens! — whatever was that blue smoke before my eyes? Had the others already begun to puff away at their cigars? I suddenly felt suffocatingly hot. I must drink something, drink quickly! I gulped down one, two, three glasses, without knowing what I was drinking. At all costs I must get this bitter, nasty taste out of my mouth! And I must smoke too. But as I felt in my pocket for my cigarette-case I was once more conscious of that crackling under my tunic: the letter! My hand drew back. Once again I could hear nothing amid the confusion of voices but those sobbing, pleading words: ‘All I ask is that you should let me love you ... I know that it is madness to force myself upon you ...’ Of His Royal and Imperial Majesty’s Uhlans ..."
"Da plötzlich geschieht etwas: ich merke zuerst nur, daß er eine Bewegung macht, eine merkwürdig plumpe und ungeschickte Bewegung.

Hinter ihm poltert und stürzt krachend der Stuhl.","Then suddenly something happens: at first I only notice that he is making a movement, a strangely clumsy and awkward movement. And then that the old man suddenly fell down from his chair like a soft mass. Behind him the chair rumbles and falls with a crash.","Suddenly, something happens.

"»Nein, mißverstehen Sie mich nicht … ich meine doch … ich meine nichts Materielles … ich meine nur … ich meine … ich habe gute Verbindungen … ich kenne eine Menge Leute in den Ministerien, auch im Kriegsministerium … und es ist doch immer gut, wenn man heutzutage jemanden hat, auf den man zählen kann … nur so mein ich’s natürlich … Es kann für jeden ein Augenblick kommen … nur das … nur das wollte ich sagen.«","'No, don't misunderstand me...I mean...I don't mean anything material...I just mean...I mean...I'm well connected...I know a lot of people in the departments, including the War Department...and it's always good if you have someone to count on these days... just that, of course, I mean it...

"Doktor Condor kraulte sich den Kopf. »Tja, wenn ich das wüßte! Jedenfalls beunruhigen Sie sich nicht! Wir sprechen doch ganz akademisch und ohne Faxereien, und ich sag’s lieber noch einmal ganz deutlich: nicht das Krankheitsbild kam mir verändert vor, sondern in ihr selbst hat sich etwas verändert. Irgend etwas, ich weiß nicht was, war mit ihr heut los. Zum ersten Mal hab ich das Gefühl gehabt, sie sei mir irgendwie aus der Hand gekommen« – er sog wieder an seiner Zigarre, dann wechselte er scharf mit seinen kleinen raschen Augen zu Kekesfalva hinüber. »Wissen Sie, das beste ist, wir gehen die Sache gleich ehrlich an. Wir brauchen uns doch voreinander nicht zu genieren und können mit offenen Karten spielen. Also … lieber Freund, sagen Sie mir, bitte, jetzt aufrichtig und klar: habt ihr inzwischen in eurer ewigen Ungeduld einen andern Arzt herangezogen? Hat jemand anderer Edith während meiner Abwesenheit untersucht oder behandelt?«","Doctor Condor scratched his head. 'Well, if only I knew! In any case, don't worry! We're speaking quite academically and without faxing, and I'd rather say it again very clearly: it wasn't the clinical picture that seemed different to me, but something in her herself that had changed. Something, I don't know what, happened to her today. For the first time I felt like I had somehow let go of her' - he drew on his cigar again, then switched his small quick eyes sharply to Kekesfalva. 'You know, the best thing is that we get straight to the point. We don't need to be ashamed of each other and can play with open cards. So … dear friend, tell me, please, now honestly and clearly: in your eternal impatience, have you consulted another doctor in the meantime? Has anyone else examined or treated Edith while I was gone?'","Dr Condor scratched his head. “I wish I knew! Anyway, don’t worry. We are speaking in purely academic terms, with no beating about the bush, so let me say again, straight out—it’s nothing in her illness that has changed, it’s something in herself. Something was the matter with her today, and I don’t know what. For the first time I had a feeling that she was somehow evading me.” He drew on the cigar again, and then glanced once more at Kekesfalva with his quick-moving little eyes. “You know it’s best for us to go about this perfectly honestly. We have no need to pretend to each other, we can show our cards. Well … my dear friend, please tell me clearly and honestly, have you, in your eternal impatience, consulted another doctor? Has someone else been examining or treating Edith since I last saw her?”","Dr Condor scratched his head. ‘Ah, there you have me! If only I knew! But in any case, don’t get upset. We’re speaking quite academically and with no nonsense, and I should like to state once again, quite categorically: the change in her did not seem to me to be connected with her illness, but with herself. Something, I don’t know what, was not quite right today. I had a feeling for the first time that in some way or other she had slipped from my grasp.’ He took another pull at his cigar, then switched the gaze of his alert little eyes over to Kekesfalva. ‘It’s best, you know, for us to approach the matter quite frankly. We have no need to beat about the bush with each other and can lay all our cards on the table. Well then, my dear friend, tell me quite frankly and honestly, I beg you: have you in your eternal impatience called in another doctor? Has Edith been examined or treated by anyone else in my absence?’"
"Ich aber muß gehorsam mit der Hand an den Helm fahren, ehe ich kehrtmachen und zurück zur Front reiten darf; kein Blick eines Kameraden kommt mir offen entgegen, alle ducken sie aus Verlegenheit die Augen tief unter den Helmschatten. Alle schämen sich für mich, oder ich empfinde es zumindest so. Glücklicherweise kürzt ein Kommando meinen Spießrutengang. Auf ein Trompetensignal beginnt die Übung von neuem; die Front zerbricht und löst sich in einzelne Züge. Und diesen Augenblick benützt Ferencz – warum sind die Dümmsten immer die Gutmütigsten zugleich? – um wie zufällig sein Pferd heranzudrängen und mir zuzuflüstern: »Mach dir nix draus! So was kann jedem passieren.«","But I must obediently put my hand to my helmet before I can turn and ride back to the front; not a comrade looks at me openly, they all duck their eyes deep under the shadow of their helmets out of embarrassment. Everyone is ashamed of me, or at least that's how I feel. Luckily, a commando shortens my gauntlet. At the sound of a trumpet, the exercise begins again; the front breaks up and separates into individual trains. And Ferencz seizes this moment – why are the dumbest ones always the good-natured ones at the same time? – to accidentally push his horse up and whisper to me: “Don’t worry! It can happen to anyone.«","However, I have to put my hand obediently to my helmet before I can turn and ride back to the front line. None of my comrades will look me in the face, they all cast their eyes down under the shadow of their helmets in embarrassment. They are all ashamed for me, or at least that is how I feel. Luckily I don’t have to ride the gauntlet between them all the way; a word of command cuts it short. Another bugle call, and the exercise begins again, the front breaks up and resolves into separate lines. Ferencz takes advantage of this moment—why are the least intelligent also the kindest?—to bring his horse up to mine as if by chance and whisper, “Don’t take it to heart! Could happen to anyone.”","And I had to raise my hand respectfully to my czapka before I could turn round and ride back to the ranks. Not one of my comrades ventured an overt glance in my direction; they all kept their eyes lowered in embarrassment, so ashamed were they all on my account, or at least so it seemed to me. Fortunately a word of command cut short the agony for me. At a bugle-call the drill began anew, each squadron wheeling off in turn. And Ferencz seized the opportunity — why is it that the stupidest people are always the most good-natured? — to urge his horse forward as if by chance and to whisper to me: ‘Don’t let it get you down. A thing like that might happen to anyone.’"

"In diesem Augenblick tritt der Oberstleutnant auf uns zu. »Na, gehn wir?« lächelt er mich freundlich an. Selbstverständlich wagt Kekesfalva nicht, vor ihm weiterzusprechen, aber ich spüre, wie plötzlich die Hand des alten Mannes mir über den Ärmel streift, ganz, ganz leise und schüchtern über den Ärmel streift, so wie man ein Kind liebkost oder eine Frau. Eine unermeßliche Zärtlichkeit, unermeßliche Dankbarkeit liegt gerade im Versteckten und Verdeckten dieser scheuen Berührung; so viel Glück und so viel Verzweiflung fühle ich darin, daß ich abermals ganz erschüttert bin, und während ich militärisch respektvoll neben dem Herrn Oberstleutnant zum Auto die drei Stufen hinabschreite, muß ich mich gut zusammenhalten, damit niemand meine Benommenheit bemerkt.","At this moment the lieutenant colonel approaches us. ""Well, shall we go?"" he gives me a friendly smile. Of course, Kekesfalva doesn't dare speak any further in front of him, but I feel how suddenly the old man's hand brushes my sleeve, very, very softly and shyly, like one caresses a child or a woman. An immeasurable tenderness, immeasurable gratitude lies precisely in what is hidden and concealed in this shy touch; I feel so much happiness and desperation in it that I'm completely shaken again, and while I walk down the three steps next to the lieutenant colonel to the car with military respect, I have to hold myself tightly together so that no one notices my daze.","At this moment the Lieutenant Colonel approaches us. “Well, shall we be off?” he says, addressing me with a friendly smile. Of course Kekesfalva does not venture to contradict him, but I feel the old man’s hand stroking my sleeve, stroking it very, very lightly and timidly, as you might caress a child or a woman. There is infinite liking and gratitude in the hidden, surreptitious nature of this shy touch; I sense such mingled happiness and despair in it that I am deeply moved once again, and as I go down the three steps to the car with the Lieutenant Colonel, bearing myself with proper military deference, I have to take care that no one notices my bemused state of mind.","At this moment the Lieutenant-Colonel joined us. ‘ Well, are we going?’ he smiled at me kindly. Of course Kekesfalva did not venture to go on talking in front of him, but suddenly I could feel the old man stroking my sleeve, very, very gently and shyly, as one might caress a child or a woman. There was infinite tenderness, infinite gratitude in the very reserve and reticence of his shy gesture. I felt that it conveyed so much happiness and so much despair that once again I was quite overcome, and as, with respectful bearing befitting a subaltern, I walked down the three steps to the car with the Lieutenant-Colonel, I had to pull myself together so that no one should remark my emotion."
"»Aber, liebes Fräulein Edith – suchen Sie doch keine geheimnisvollen Beweggründe bei mir. Sie kennen mich schließlich genug, um zu wissen, daß ich jemand bin, der nicht viel über sich nachdenkt. Ich bin, ich schwör’s Ihnen, noch nie auf die Idee gekommen, mich zu examinieren, warum ich zu dem geh und zu jenem, warum ich die einen Leut gern hab und die andern nicht. Mein Wort – ich kann Ihnen wirklich nichts Gescheiteres und nichts Dümmeres sagen, als daß ich immer wieder zu Euch komm – eben weil ich gern zu Euch komm und weil ich mich hier eben hundertmal wohler fühl als anderswo. Ihr stellt’s Euch, glaub ich, unsere Kavalleristik doch ein bissel zu sehr nach der Operette vor, immer fesch, immer lustig, eine Art ewiger Kirchweih. Nun, von innen sehen die Dinge nicht so üppig aus, und auch mit der vielgerühmten Kameradschaft steht’s manchmal reichlich windig. Wo ein paar Dutzend vor die gleiche Karre gespannt sind, zieht immer einer schärfer an als der andere, und wo’s Avancement und Ranglisten gibt, tritt man dem Vordermann leicht auf die Zehen. Bei jedem Wort, das man sagt, muß man auf der Hut sein, nie ist man ganz sicher, ob man nicht das Mißbehagen der Großkopfeten erregt; immer hängt wo ein Donnerwetter in der Luft. Dienst kommt von Dienen, und Dienen heißt abhängig sein. Und dann, eine Kaserne und ein Wirtshaustisch sind doch nie ein rechtes Zuhause; keiner braucht einen dort und keinem liegt was an einem. Ja, ja, es geht schon manchmal ganz fidel zu mit den Kameraden, aber irgendein Letztes an Sicherheit kriegt man nie richtig heraus. Wenn ich dagegen zu Euch komm, da leg ich mit dem Säbel zugleich alle Bedenklichkeiten weg, und wenn ich dann mit Euch so gemütlich plausche, dann …«","'But, dear Fraulein Edith, don't look to me for mysterious motives.

My word - I really can't tell you anything smarter or stupider than that I keep coming to you - precisely because I like coming to you and because I feel a hundred times better here than anywhere else. I think you imagine our cavalry a bit too much like the operetta, always smart, always funny, a kind of eternal church festival. Well, things don't look so lavish from the inside, and even with the much-vaunted camaraderie, things get a little windy at times. Where a few dozen are harnessed to the same cart, one always pulls harder than the other, and where there are advancements and rankings, it's easy to step on the toes of the man in front. You have to be careful with every word you say, you're never quite sure if you're not going to arouse the displeasure of the bigheads; there is always thunderstorm hanging in the air. Service comes from serving, and serving is dependent. And then, a barracks and an inn table are never really a home; no one needs one there and no one cares about one. Yes, yes, it's sometimes quite jolly with the comrades, but you never really get any ultimate sense of security.

Upon my word—all I can say, and whether it’s clever or stupid I don’t know, is that I keep coming to see you because I like it here , I feel a hundred times better here than anywhere else. I think you imagine the life of a cavalry officer like something out of an operetta, always bright and merry, a kind of permanent carnival. Well, from the inside it’s not all fun, and even our much-vaunted comradely spirit is sometimes not so straightforward. Where you get a few dozen harnessed to the same carriage, there’s always one who’s pulling harder than his neighbour, and when it comes to promotion and lists of ranking you can easily tread on someone else’s toes. You have to watch every word you say, you’re never quite sure of not arousing the ire of your superiors, in fact there’s always the chance of a storm brewing. We’re on military service—which means serving, and servants are dependent. Then again, a barracks and a table at the inn are not like a proper home, no one needs you there, no one really minds about you. Yes, I know we sometimes strike up good, faithful friendships among comrades, but ultimately that never provides a real sense of security.

I really can’t give you any more coherent reason than that I come here again and again ... simply because I like coming here and because I feel a hundred times happier here than anywhere else. I think you civilians are rather too apt to picture the life of a cavalryman as something out of light opera, an everlastingly riotous, gay existence, a sort of perpetual feast. Well, from within things don’t look nearly so splendid, and as for all the vaunted camaraderie, it sometimes lets you down with a bump.

At every word one utters one has to be on one’s guard; one’s never quite sure whether it isn’t going to arouse the disapproval of the bigwigs; there’s always a storm in the offing.

"Unsere Entschlüsse sind in viel höherem Maß von der Anpassung an Stand und Umgebung abhängig, als wir geneigt sind, uns einzugestehen. Ein beträchtlicher Teil unseres Denkens schaltet bloß längst übernommene Eindrücke und Einflüsse automatisch weiter, und besonders, wer im Drill soldatischer Disziplin von Kindheit an erzogen wurde, unterliegt der Psychose eines Befehls wie einem unwiderstehlichen Zwang. Jedes militärische Kommando hat über ihn eine logisch völlig unbegreifliche, willensauflösende Macht. In der Zwangsjacke der Uniform erfüllt er, selbst wenn er der Sinnlosigkeit eines Auftrags völlig gewahr ist, die Vorschrift wie ein Schlafwandler, widerstandslos und fast unbewußt.","Our decisions depend on adjustment to status and environment to a far greater degree than we are inclined to admit. A considerable part of our thinking simply automatically switches on long-accepted impressions and influences, and especially those who have been brought up in the drill of military discipline from childhood are subject to the psychosis of an order like an irresistible compulsion. Every military command has a logically completely incomprehensible, will-dissolving power over him. In the straitjacket of his uniform, even when he is fully aware of the futility of an assignment, he fulfills the order like a sleepwalker, unresistingly and almost unconsciously.","Our decisions depend far more than we like to admit on the familiar criteria of our rank in life and our environment. A large part of the mind automatically accepts impressions and influences made on us long before, and if a man has been brought up from childhood in the drill of military discipline, the psychological effect of an order from a superior officer is compelling and cannot be ignored. Every military command has a power over him that is logically inexplicable, but cancels out his own will. Even if he is well aware of the pointlessness of what he is told to do, in the straitjacket of his uniform he does what he is told to do like a sleepwalker, without resisting and almost unconsciously.","Our decisions are to a much greater extent dependent on our desire to conform to the standards of our class and environment than we are inclined to admit. A considerable proportion of our reasoning is merely an automatic function, so to speak, of influences and impressions which have become part of us, and anyone who has been brought up from childhood in the stern school of military discipline is particularly apt to succumb to the hypnotic and compulsive force exercised by an order or word of command; a force which is logically entirely incomprehensible and which irresistibly undermines his will. In the strait-jacket of a uniform, an officer will carry out his instructions, even though fully aware of their absurdity, like a sleep-walker, unresistingly and almost unconsciously."

About halfway along this road, where you come to a little chapel on a bridge, a narrow avenue shaded by old chestnut trees branches off to the left. This avenue is more or less private, with few people going along it either on foot or in a carriage, and a small stream winding its way at a comfortable pace runs beside it.","It was not a particularly long walk to the Kekesfalvas’, half an hour at the most if one stepped out briskly.

"Ich holte aus, um zu antworten, aber schon setzte Condor hastig ein:","I drew back to answer, but Condor hastily began:","I took a deep breath, preparing to answer, but Condor quickly intervened.","I drew a deep breath and made ready to answer, but Condor quickly went on:"
"»So – das wär einmal erledigt. Morgen b’stell ich sie mir her, alle sieben, einen nach dem andern, eh sie einen Fuß auf den Exerzierplatz setzen, und Gott gnad dem Kerl, der sich nachher noch zu erinnern getraut, was du g’sagt hast. Den Apotheker nehm ich mir dann separat vor. Ich wer’ ihm schon was aufbinden, verlaß dich drauf, ich wer’ schon was finden. Vielleicht, daß du mich erst hast um Erlaubnis bitten wollen, eh du’s offiziell machst oder … oder, wart einmal« – er trat ruckhaft so nah an mich heran, daß ich seinen Atem spürte, und sah mir mit seinem stechenden Blick in die Augen – »sag aufrichtig, aber wirklich aufrichtig jetzt: hast vorher was ’trunken g’habt – ich mein, vorher, eh du den Blödsinn ang’stellt hast?«","'So - that's settled. Tomorrow I'll make them, all seven, one after the other, before they set foot on the parade ground, and God help the fellow who dared to remember what you said afterwards. I'll take care of the pharmacist separately. I'll tell him something, trust me, I'll find something. Maybe that you wanted to ask my permission first before you made it official or... or, wait a minute"" - he jerked his way up so close I could feel his breath and met my eyes with those piercing eyes - ""Say honestly, but really honestly now: did you have anything 'drunk before - I mean, before, before you did that nonsense?""","“Right—that’s that, then. I’ll send for them tomorrow one by one, before any of them sets foot on the parade ground, and God have mercy on any man who dares to remember what you said once I’m through with him. I’ll see about the pharmacist separately. I’ll spin him some kind of yarn, depend upon it, I’ll think something up. Maybe that you wanted to ask my permission before saying anything officially, or … or wait!” He suddenly came so close to me that I could smell his breath, and looked me in the eye with that probing gaze. “Tell me honestly, and I mean really honestly, had you been drinking beforehand … I mean before you committed this act of folly?”","Well, we can put that right. Tomorrow I’ll order them to report to me, all seven of them, one after another, before they set foot on the parade-ground, and God help the fellow who dare remember, after I’ve done with him, a word of what you said! I’ll deal with the apothecary myself. I’ll bamboozle him all right. I’ll find a way of squaring him, you leave that to me. What about saying that you wished to ask permission before making the engagement public ... or, wait a minute’— he came so close up to me that I could feel his breath on my face, and his piercing eyes looked straight into mine — ‘tell me honestly, I mean really honestly : had you been drinking — I mean before you made a fool of yourself like that?’"
"»Aber wie … wie äußert sich das?« keuchte Kekesfalva. Ich sah, alle Beschwörungen Condors vermochten ihn nicht zu beruhigen, und seine Stirn glänzte feucht.","""But how . . . how is that expressed?"" Kekesfalva gasped. I saw that none of Condor's incantations could soothe him, and his forehead glistened with moisture.","“But how … how does this change show in her?” gasped Kekesfalva. I saw that none of what Condor said could reassure him, and there was a damp gleam on his forehead.","‘But how ... how does it show itself?’ gasped Kekesfalva. I saw that all Condor’s adjurations had failed to reassure him, and his brow was beaded with sweat."
"»Vielleicht wär’s besser«, murmelte er dann, »wir gehen jetzt hinüber, sonst … sonst fällt es Edith auf, daß wir so lange fortbleiben. Man muß leider furchtbar behutsam mit ihr sein; seit sie krank ist, hat sie … hat sie irgendwie schärfere Sinne bekommen, die andere nicht haben; von ihrem Zimmer her weiß sie alles, was im Haus vorgeht … alles errät sie, eh man’s recht ausgesprochen hat … Da könnte sie am Ende … darum möchte ich vorschlagen, wir gehen hinüber, ehe sie Verdacht schöpft.«","""Perhaps it would be better,"" he then murmured, ""we go over there now, otherwise . . . otherwise Edith will notice that we're staying away so long. Unfortunately one has to be terribly careful with her; since she's been ill, she's... she's somehow gotten sharper senses that other people don't have; from her room she knows everything that goes on in the house... she guesses everything before it's rightly said... She could end up there... so I'd like to suggest we go over there before she gets suspicious.""","“Perhaps it would be better,” he murmured, “if we went over to the house now, or … or Edith will notice what a long time we’ve been away. I’m afraid we’ve had to be terribly careful with her since she’s been ill. She seems to have … to have sharper senses than other people, somehow. Even in her room she knows about everything going on in the house … she guesses everything almost before you ’ve finished putting it into words, so she could end up … well, that’s why I suggest we go over before she suspects anything.”","‘It might be better,’ he murmured, ‘if we were to go across to the house now, or ... or Edith will be wondering why we’ve been away so long. One has, unfortunately, to be terribly on one’s guard with her; since she has been ill, her senses seem to have become more acute than other people’s; as she lies there in her room she knows everything that goes on in the house. She knows what one is going to say almost before one has opened one’s mouth. So, you see, she might ... that is why I suggest we had better go across to the house before her suspicions are aroused.’"
Ich halte dem Blick nicht stand.,I can't stand the gaze.,I can’t hold his gaze.,Your word of honour that you’ll report here at half-past five and leave for Czaslau.’
"»Und dann, an manchen Tagen ertrag ich seine Insistenz einfach nicht mehr. Wissen Sie, das Schwere bei unserem Beruf sind gar nicht die Kranken; mit denen lernt man schließlich richtig umgehen, man kriegt eine Technik heraus. Und schließlich – wenn Patienten klagen und fragen und drängen, so gehört das einfach zu ihrem Zustand wie Fieber oder Kopfschmerz. Wir rechnen von vornherein mit ihrer Ungeduld, wir sind darauf eingestellt und gerüstet, und jeder hat dafür gewisse beruhigende Phrasen und Unwahrheiten genau so bereit wie seine Schlafmittel und schmerzstillenden Tropfen. Aber niemand macht unsereinem das Leben so sauer wie die Anverwandten, die Zugehörigen, die sich unberufenerweise zwischen den Arzt und den Patienten schieben und immer die ›Wahrheit‹ wissen wollen. Alle tun sie, als ob momentan nur dieser eine Mensch krank wäre auf Erden und man einzig für ihn sich sorgen müßte, für ihn allein. Ich nehme Kekesfalva sein Gefrage wirklich nicht übel, aber wissen Sie, wenn Ungeduld chronisch wird, läßt einen manchmal die Geduld im Stich. Zehnmal habe ich ihm erklärt, ich hätte jetzt einen schweren Fall in der Stadt, wo es auf Tod und Leben geht. Und obwohl er’s weiß, telephoniert er doch Tag für Tag und drängt und drängt und will mit Gewalt sich eine Hoffnung erzwingen. Und gleichzeitig weiß ich als sein Arzt, wie verhängnisvoll diese Aufregung auf ihn wirkt, ich bin ja viel mehr beunruhigt als er ahnt, viel, viel mehr. Ein Glück, daß er nicht weiß, wie schlimm es steht.«","“And then, some days, I just can't take his insistence anymore. You know, the difficult part of our job isn't the sick ones; you finally learn how to deal with them properly, you figure out a technique. And finally - when patients complain and ask and urge, it is simply a part of their condition like fever or headache. We anticipate their impatience from the outset, we are prepared and prepared for it, and everyone has certain soothing phrases and untruths just as ready as their sleeping pills and painkillers. But no one makes life so miserable for us as relatives, relatives who unfairly put themselves between the doctor and the patient and always want to know the 'truth'. They all act as if at the moment only this one person were sick on earth and one only had to care for him, for him alone. I really don't blame Kekesfalva for asking, but you know, when impatience becomes chronic, patience sometimes fails you. I've explained to him ten times that I've got a serious case in the city where it's a matter of life and death. And although he knows it, he telephones day after day and pushes and pushes and tries to force hope on himself. And at the same time, as his doctor, I know how disastrous this excitement is for him, I'm much more worried than he realizes, much, much more. It's lucky he doesn't know how bad things are.""","“There are days when I just can’t take any more of his persistence. You know, the patients aren’t the hardest part of a doctor’s life; we learn to get along with them, we work out a technique. And after all, if patients complain and ask questions and press you for answers, it’s part of their condition, like a high temperature or a headache. We expect them to be impatient from the start, we’re prepared for that and armed against it, and every one of us has soothing phrases and white lies on the tip of his tongue, just as he can prescribe sleeping pills and painkillers. But no one makes our lives more difficult than the relations who intervene, unasked, between doctor and patient, and always want to know ‘the truth’. They act as if no one else in the world were ill at the moment but this one invalid, and there’s no one else to be treated anywhere. I really don’t mind Kekesfalva ’s constant questions, but you know, if impatience becomes a chronic condition sometimes the doctor’s own patience lets him down. I’ve told him ten times over that I have a severe case in Vienna , it’s a matter of life or death. And although he knows that, he keeps telephoning day after day, urging and urging me, trying to force some words of hope out of me. At the same time, as his doctor, I can see how bad all this stress is for him. In fact I’m far more concerned about him than he knows, far, far more. It’s as well that he doesn’t know how poor the prospects are.”","‘And then there are days, you know, on which I just can’t stand his insistence. The difficult thing, you know, in our profession, is not the patients; in the end one learns how to manage them, one develops a certain technique. And after all, if patients grumble and plague us with their questions, that’s simply a part of their condition, just as much as a temperature or a headache. We count in advance on their being impatient, we take it as a matter of course, we’re prepared for it, and we have certain soothing phrases and white lies ready to hand, just as we have sleeping draughts and analgesics. But the people who make life so unendurable for us are the relatives, the friends who, so to speak, interpose themselves between doctor and patient and are always clamouring to know the “truth”. They all behave as though their patient were the only person on earth who was ill and as though one ought to give all one’s attention to him, to him alone. I don’t really take Kekesfalva’s questioning amiss, but, you know, when that sort of thing becomes chronic, one’s patience sometimes gives out. Ten times over I’ve told him I have a serious case just now in town, and that it is a matter of life and death. And although he knows that, he telephones day after day and pesters and pesters me, and tries to wring some hope from me at all costs. And all the time I know as his doctor how bad it is for him to get worked up like this. I’m far more worried than he suspects, far more. A good thing he doesn’t know how bad matters are!’"
"Es schwang ein bitterer Ton in seiner Stimme mit. Unwillkürlich fiel mir ein, was Kekesfalva erzählt hatte – Condor habe eine blinde Frau, die er nicht zu kurieren vermochte, gleichsam als Buße geheiratet, und diese Blinde, statt ihm dankbar zu sein, quäle ihn noch. Aber schon legte er warm und fast zärtlich seine Hand auf meinen Arm.","There was a bitter tone in his voice. I couldn't help remembering what Kekesfalva had said: Condor had married a blind woman whom he could not cure, as a penance, and this blind woman, instead of being grateful to him, was still tormenting him. But he already laid his hand warmly and almost tenderly on my arm.","There was a note of bitterness in his voice. Involuntarily, I remembered what Kekesfalva had told me—that Condor had married a blind woman whom he couldn’t cure more or less as a penance, and instead of being grateful she nagged him. But now he was placing his hand warmly, almost affectionately, on my arm.","A bitter note crept into his voice. I could not help remembering what Kekesfalva had told me: that Condor had a blind wife whom he had been unable to cure, and had married by way of penance, and that this blind woman, instead of being grateful to him, was a continual plague to him. But he put his hand on my arm with a warm, almost affectionate gesture."
"Aus Höflichkeit erkundigte er sich, wohin sie zu fahren gedenke; ihr eben aufgehelltes Gesicht verschattete sich.",Out of politeness he asked where she was going; her newly brightened face grew shadowed.,"“And out of civility, he asked where she was thinking of going. Her face, so bright a moment ago, clouded over again.","Out of politeness he inquired where she meant to go, and her face, which the moment before had brightened, clouded over."
"»Verzeihen Sie. Josef hätte wirklich warten können, statt da hereinzupoltern. Es ist ja nichts als die tägliche Quälerei, der Masseur, der mit mir Streckübungen macht. Der reinste Unsinn, eins, zwei, eins, zwei, auf, ab, ab, auf; davon soll alles auf einmal gut werden. Die neueste Erfindung unseres Herrn Doktors und eine völlig überflüssige Sekkatur. Sinnlos wie alle andern.«","""Forgive me. Josef really could have waited instead of crashing in there. It's nothing but the daily torment, the masseur doing stretching exercises with me. Sheer nonsense, one, two, one, two, up, down, down, up; all of this should be good at once. Our doctor's latest invention and a completely unnecessary seccture. Pointless like everyone else.«","“Forgive me. Josef really could have waited instead of bursting in like that.

Pointless, like everything else.”","‘Do forgive me, but Josef could perfectly well have waited, instead of bursting in like that. It’s only the usual daily torture — the masseur who gives me remedial exercises. The most utter nonsense — one, two, one, two, up, down, down, up; and that, if you please, is going to put me right! The latest discovery of our dear doctor, and a quite superfluous form of torment. Useless, like everything else!’"
"Kanitz schielt sie vorsichtig von der Seite an. Wie schmal sie in dem großen Raum steht, die arme Besitzerin! Etwas zu blaß ist sie und zu verschüchtert, sonst könnte man sie beinahe noch hübsch nennen; wie eine verregnete Landschaft wirkt dies länglich-schmale Gesicht mit den verhängten Lidern. Die Augen scheinen von einem zarten Kornblumenblau, weiche und warme Augen, aber sie wagen nicht, herzhaft zu strahlen, scheu ducken sie sich immer wieder hinter die Lider zurück. Und Kanitz als geübter Beobachter erkennt sofort: ein Wesen, dem man das Rückgrat gebrochen hat. Ein Mensch ohne Willen, den man um den Finger wickeln kann. Also Konversation machen, Konversation machen!","Kanitz cautiously peered at her from the side. How narrow she stands in the big room, the poor owner! She is a bit too pale and too shy, otherwise one could almost call her pretty; this long, narrow face with the draped eyelids looks like a rainy landscape. The eyes shine a delicate cornflower blue, soft and warm eyes, but they don't dare to radiate heartily, they shyly duck back again and again behind the lids. And Kanitz, as a practiced observer, immediately recognizes: a creature whose back has been broken. A man with no will to wrap around your finger. So make conversation, make conversation!","“Kanitz gives her a cautious sidelong glance. How small and thin she looks standing in this large room, the unhappy owner of the whole place! She is rather too pale and too unsure of herself, or she could almost be described as pretty. That long, delicate face with its downcast eyelids is like a landscape seen in rain. Her eyes themselves are a soft cornflower blue, warm and gentle, but she dares not turn their radiance on anyone—instead they keep retreating behind their lids again. Kanitz, a good observer, immediately sees that here is someone whose will has been broken. She has no backbone any more, he can twist her around his little finger. So he must make conversation, talk to her!","Kanitz stole a furtive glance at her from the side. What a wisp of a thing she looked in this big room, the poor owner of Kekesfalva! Except that she was rather too pale and frightened, one might almost have called her pretty; the long slender face with the veiled lids made one think of a rain-drenched landscape, the eyes seemed to be of a delicate cornflower-blue — soft, warm eyes, which did not dare to beam too brightly, but again and again shyly took refuge behind the lids. And as an experienced observer of human nature Kanitz realized at once that here was a being whose backbone had been broken: a creature without a will of her own, whom one could twist round one’s little finger. Well then, make conversation, make conversation!"
"»Ja, ich komme schon.« Widerstrebend ließ er sich führen; ich drängte ihn glücklich zehn, zwanzig Schritte weiter. Dann spürte ich an meinem Arm die Last schwerer werden.","""Yes, I'll come."" Reluctantly, he allowed himself to be led; I happily pushed him ten or twenty steps further. Then I felt the weight on my arm getting heavier.","“Yes, yes, I’m coming.” Reluctantly, he let me lead him away. I managed to get him to go ten or twenty paces, and then I felt his limp weight hanging more heavily on my arm.","‘Yes, I’m coming.’ Reluctantly he allowed himself to be led along. I managed to urge him ten, twenty paces farther. Then I felt him dragging at my arm."
"Aber der da vor mir steht, ist ein alter Mann, und sein Kopf ist demütig gebeugt. Ich sehe seinen dünnen weißen Scheitel; wie aus einem Traum erinnere ich mich an jenen meiner Großmutter, wenn sie über dem Strickzeug uns kleinen Geschwistern Märchen erzählte. Einen alten, kranken Mann kann man doch nicht unhöflich wegweisen. So deute ich, unbelehrbar durch alle Erfahrung, auf den Stuhl hin:","But the one standing before me is an old man and his head is bowed in humility. I see his thin white crown; I remember my grandmother as if from a dream when she told us little siblings fairy tales over the knitting. You can't turn an old, sick man away impolitely. So, unteachable by all experience, I point to the chair:","But the man facing me is old, and his head is humbly bowed. I see his thin, white hair, and as if in a dream I remember my grandmother’s white head as she sat knitting, telling me and my siblings fairy tales. One can’t be uncivil enough to send a sick old man away. So I indicate—has experience taught me nothing?—the chair where he can sit.","But the man who stood before me was an old man, and his head was meekly bowed. I could see the parting in the thin white hair, and it conjured up a vision of my grandmother bending over her knitting and telling us youngsters fairy-stories. One could not turn away an old, sick man without a kindly word. And so, as though all my experience had taught me nothing, I motioned him to a chair."
"Zehn Minuten noch, denke ich mir, dann kann ich mich unauffällig empfehlen; da klopft es abermals leise an der Tür, der Diener tritt ein, unhörbar, als ob er bloßfuß ginge, und flüstert Edith etwas ins Ohr. Unbeherrscht fährt sie auf.","Ten more minutes, I think to myself, and then I can discreetly recommend myself; then there is another soft knock at the door, the servant enters, inaudible, as if he were walking barefoot, and whispers something in Edith's ear. She starts up uncontrollably.","Ten more minutes, I am thinking, then I can unobtrusively take my leave, when there is another quiet knock at the door. The manservant comes in, as quietly as if he were barefoot, and whispers something in Edith’s ear. She flares up angrily.","Another ten minutes, I thought to myself, and I can take my leave unobtrusively. But at this moment there was another gentle tap on the door, and the butler entered noiselessly, as though he were bare-footed, and whispered something in Edith’s ear. She immediately flew into a temper."
"»So, da können’s Ihna setzen«, deutet sie mit einer gewissen Herablassung auf einen der Stühle. Und sofort verstehe ich: Condor muß eine Armeleutepraxis haben. Reiche Patienten werden anders empfangen. Sonderbarer Mensch, sonderbarer Mensch, denke ich abermals. Er könnte doch an Kekesfalva allein reich werden, wenn er nur wollte.","""So, there you can put it,"" she points to one of the chairs with a certain condescension. And I understand immediately: Condor must have a poor man's practice. Rich patients are received differently. Strange man, strange man, I think again. He could get rich on Kekesfalva alone if he wanted to.","“Can sit there,” she said, pointing with some condescension to one of the chairs. I understand her meaning. Condor’s practice must be for the poor; rich patients are not received like this. What a strange man, I think again, what a very strange man. He could make a fortune out of Kekesfalva alone if he wanted.","‘You sit there,’ she said, pointing with a certain condescension to one of the chairs. And I now realized that Condor must have a working-class practice; rich patients were received very differently from this. A rum fellow, I thought, a very rum fellow. He could make pots of money, if he wanted to, out of the Kekesfalvas alone."
"Aber jetzt war es ausgesprochen und derselbe Schlag uns beiden aufs Herz gefallen. Beide sitzen wir nach diesem einen verräterischen Wort stumm und vermeiden, einer den andern anzublicken. In dem schmalen Raum über dem Tisch zwischen uns steht ein Schweigen in der starren Luft. Aber allmählich dehnt sich dieses Schweigen; wie ein schwarzes Gas schwillt es auf bis zur Decke und füllt das ganze Zimmer; von oben, von unten, von allen Seiten drückt und drängt diese Leere auf uns ein, und ich höre an den gepreßten Stößen seines Atems, wie sehr das Schweigen ihm die Kehle würgt. Ein Augenblick noch, und dieser Druck muß uns beide ersticken oder einer von uns muß auffahren und sie mit einem Wort zerschlagen, diese drückende, diese mörderische Leere.","But now it was said, and the same blow fell on both of our hearts. After that one telltale word we both sit in silence and avoid looking at one another. In the narrow space above the table between us, there is silence in the still air. But gradually this silence stretches; like a black gas it swells to the ceiling and fills the whole room; From above, from below, from all sides, this emptiness presses and presses on us, and I can hear from the stifled gasps of his breathing how much the silence is choking his throat. A moment more and this pressure must suffocate us both, or one of us must jump up and shatter this oppressive, this murderous emptiness with a word.","But now he has put it into words, and we are both stricken to the heart. After those revealing remarks we sit there, mute, avoiding each other’s eyes. There is silence in the air above the table between us in the small room. Gradually that silence spreads, rising to the ceiling like a black gas, filling the whole room from above, from below, a void pressing in on us from all sides, and the old man’s difficult breathing tells me how the silence is choking him. Another moment and the pressure will stifle us both—unless one of us breaks it, destroys that oppressive, murderous void with a word.","But now it had all come out, and the blow had struck with equal force at both our hearts. After this revelation we both sat there mute, avoiding each other’s gaze. Silence hovered in the motionless air, in the narrow space above the table that divided us. But gradually this silence expanded, surged like black vapour up to the ceiling and filled the whole room; from above, from below, from all sides this emptiness pressed down and thrust itself upon us, and I could tell from Kekesfalva’s laboured, convulsive breathing that the silence was almost suffocating him. Another moment and this pressure would choke us both unless one of us started up and shattered it with a word — this oppressive, murderous emptiness."
Die buschigen Brauen spannen sich zum erstaunten Bogen. »Was? Jetzt? Um halber zwei in der Nacht?«,"The bushy brows arch in astonishment. ""What? Now? At half past two in the night?”","Those bushy brows shot up in surprise. “What, now? At one-thirty in the morning?”",The bushy brows expanded into an astonished arch. ‘ Wha-at? Now? At half-past one in the morning?’
"»Brauchst vielleicht noch was? Wenn ich dir beispringen kann, genier dich nicht, ich tu’s gern. Ich möcht nicht, daß die Leut glauben, du bist in Verschiß, oder so was. Brauchst nix?«","""Do you need anything else? If I can help you, don't be embarrassed, I'll be happy to do it. I don't want people to think you're screwed or anything. Don't need anything?""","“Anything else you need? If I can help at all, don’t hesitate to ask, I’ll be happy to do it. I wouldn’t want anyone to think you were ostracised, nothing like that. Anything I can do, then?”","‘Anything else you want? If I can be of any help to you, don’t fail to come to me, I’ll be glad to do what I can. I shouldn’t like people to think you’re in disgrace or anything like that. Is there anything you want?’"
"Gleichzeitig ging er auf die Blinde zu und strich ihr zart über das graue und verwirrte Haar. Sofort veränderte sich bei dieser Berührung ihr ganzer Ausdruck. Die Angst, die eben noch ihren großen, schweren Mund verzerrt hatte, glättete sich unter diesem einen zärtlichen Strich, und mit einem hilflos verschämten, einen geradezu bräutlichen Lächeln wandte sie sich, kaum daß sie seine Nähe spürte, ihm zu; rein und hell glänzte die etwas eckige Stirn im Reflex des Lichts. Unbeschreiblich war dieser Ausdruck persönlicher Beruhigung und Gesichertheit nach jenem Ausbruch der Heftigkeit. Anscheinend vergaß sie meine Gegenwart vollkommen über dem Glück, die seine zu fühlen. Ihre Hand tastete, magnetisch angezogen, ihm durch die leere Luft entgegen, und sofort, da die weich suchenden Finger seinen Rock erreichten, strichen sie schon rieselnd aber-und abermals den Arm entlang. Verstehend, daß ihr ganzer Körper seine Nähe suchte, trat er heran, und nun lehnte sie an ihm, wie ein völlig Erschöpfter hinsinkt zur Rast. Lächelnd legte er den Arm um ihre Schultern und wiederholte, ohne mich anzusehen:","At the same time he walked up to the blind woman and gently stroked her gray and tangled hair. Her whole expression changed immediately when she was touched. The fear that had just distorted her large, heavy mouth smoothed itself under this one tender stroke, and with a helplessly bashful, almost bridal smile she turned to him as soon as she felt his nearness; the somewhat angular forehead shone pure and bright in the reflection of the light. This expression of personal reassurance and security after that outburst of violence was indescribable. Apparently she completely forgot my presence over the happiness of feeling his. Her hand, magnetically attracted, reached out to meet him through the empty air, and as soon as the softly searching fingers reached his skirt, they ran trickling again and again along his arm. Realizing that her whole body was seeking his nearness, he approached, and now she leaned against him like a completely exhausted person sinking down to rest. Smiling, he put his arm around her shoulders and repeated without looking at me:","As he spoke, he went over to the blind woman and affectionately stroked her untidy grey hair. At his touch her entire expression changed. The anxiety that had just been distorting her large, heavy-lipped mouth disappeared at that one loving caress, and with a helplessly diffident, almost girlish smile she turned to him as soon as she sensed that he was close. Her rather angular brow looked pure and bright in the reflected light. After such a violent outburst of feeling, there was something indescribable about this expression of personal reassurance and security. She seemed to have forgotten my presence entirely in the happiness of knowing that he was so close. Her hand, as if magnetically attracted, went out to him through the empty air, and as soon as her tentatively searching fingers touched his coat she began stroking his arm again and again. Understanding that she wanted to be as close to him as possible, he went to her, and she leant against him like a woman entirely exhausted sinking into rest. Smiling, he put his arm around her shoulders and repeated, without looking at me, “How kind of you, Klara.”","He went up to the blind woman and tenderly stroked her grey, rumpled hair. At his touch her whole expression changed. The anxiety that had distorted her large, heavy mouth was conjured away at this tender caress, and with a helpless, shamefaced, positively coy smile she turned to him; her somewhat protuberant forehead gleamed clear and bright in the electric light. It was breath-taking, this expression of sudden calm and assurance after the outburst of violence. Apparently she had completely forgotten my presence in the joy of feeling him near her. Her hand, attracted as though by a magnet, groped towards him through empty space, and when her gently exploring fingers found his coat, they kept stroking his arm, up and down, up and down. Realizing that her whole body was yearning for him, he went nearer, and now she leaned against him, relaxing her limbs as though utterly exhausted. Smilingly he put his arm round her shoulders and repeated, without looking at me:"
"Er steht vor mir, den Kopf gesenkt wie unter einem unsichtbaren Joch. Im Dunkeln schimmert der knochige Schädel mit dem dünnen gescheitelten Haar. Die völlig unnötige Servilität seiner Haltung beginnt mich zu erbittern. Untrüglich sagt mir ein Unbehagen: hinter diesem verlegenen Herumgerede steckt eine bestimmte Absicht. Bloß um gleichgültige Grüße zu bestellen, klettert ein alter, herzkranker Mann nicht drei Stockwerke hinauf. Diese Grüße hätten sich ebensogut telephonisch übermitteln oder bis morgen aufsparen lassen. Achtung! sage ich mir, dieser Kekesfalva will etwas von dir. Schon einmal ist er so aus dem Dunkel vorgebrochen; demütig wie ein Bettler beginnt er und preßt dir schließlich seinen Willen auf wie der Djinn deines Traumes dem Mitleidigen. Nicht ihm nachgeben! Nicht dich einfangen lassen! Nichts fragen, nach nichts dich erkundigen, möglichst bald ihn verabschieden und hinabbegleiten!","He stands before me, his head bowed as if under an invisible yoke. The bony skull with the thin parted hair shimmers in the dark. The completely unnecessary servility of his attitude is beginning to anger me. A feeling of uneasiness tells me unmistakably: behind this embarrassed gossip there is a specific intention. An old man with a heart condition doesn't climb three floors just to send indifferent greetings. These greetings could just as easily have been sent by telephone or saved until tomorrow. Danger! I say to myself, this Kekesfalva wants something from you. Once before he broke out of the darkness like this; humble as a beggar he begins and finally imposes his will on you like the djinn of your dream on the compassionate. Don't give in to him! Don't get caught! Ask nothing, inquire about nothing, say goodbye to him as soon as possible and accompany him downstairs!","He stands before me, head bent as if an invisible yoke were weighing his shoulders down. In the darkness his bony skull gleams through the sparse hair neatly parted over it. The entirely unnecessary servility of his bearing is beginning to incense me. A sense of discomfort tells me plainly—there’s some definite purpose behind all this awkward beating about the bush. An old man with a weak heart doesn’t climb three floors up just to deliver a civil message. And he could have done that equally well over the telephone, or it could have waited until tomorrow. Careful, I tell myself, Kekesfalva wants you to do something for him. He’s already emerged from the darkness once before, he starts by seeming as humble as a beggar, and finally he forces his will on you like the djinn in your dream, half-strangling the man who takes pity on him. Don’t let yourself in for it! Don’t ask him any questions, don’t try to find out what’s going on, say goodbye and escort him downstairs as soon as you can!","He stood there before me, his head bowed as though beneath an invisible yoke. His bony egg-shaped skull with its scanty hair gleamed in the darkness. The completely uncalled-for servility of his bearing began to exasperate me. I had an uneasy feeling — and I knew I was not mistaken — that behind all this hum-ing and ha-ing there was some quite definite purpose. An old man with a weak heart did not climb three storeys merely in order to convey someone else’s compliments. He could just as easily have rung up or saved his breath until tomorrow. Be careful, I told myself. This old man wants something of you. Once before he appeared like this out of the darkness; he starts off humbly like a beggar and ends by forcing his will upon you like the djinn, the Old Man of the Sea in your dream. Don’t yield! Don’t let yourself be trapped! Don’t ask, don’t inquire about anything, but get rid of him, get out of his clutches, as quickly as possible."

"»Genau so, Hofmiller, hab ich geredt, genau so gedacht! Nur weit weg, damit ist alles ausgewischt, tabula rasa! Lieber Schuhputzer drüben in Amerika oder G’schirrwäscher, wie’s ja immer in den Zeitungsgeschichten von den großen Millionären steht! Aber, Hofmiller, auch bis hinüber braucht’s ein gutes Stück Geld, und das weißt eben noch nicht, was das für unsereins heißt, Buckerln machen! Sobald ein alter Ulan nicht mehr den Kragen mit den Sternen am Hals spürt, kann er nicht einmal mehr anständig in seinen Stiefeln stehn und noch weniger so reden, wie er’s früher gewohnt war. Blöd und verlegen sitzt man bei seinen besten Freunden herum, und grad wenn man um was bitten soll, schlägt einem der Stolz auf’s Maul. Ja, mein Lieber, ich hab damals allerhand erlebt, an das ich lieber nicht denken will – Blamagen und Erniedrigungen, von denen ich noch zu niemandem g’sprochen hab.«","""That's exactly what I said, Hofmiller, that's exactly what I thought! Only far away, that wipes everything out, tabula rasa! Dear shoeshine boy over there in America or dishwasher, as it always says in the newspaper stories about the big millionaires! But, Hofmiller, you also need a good bit of money to get there, and you don't yet know what that means for us, to do bucking! As soon as an old Ulan no longer feels the collar with the stars on his neck, he can no longer even stand decently in his boots and even less talk as he used to. You sit around stupid and embarrassed with your best friends, and just when you have to ask for something, your pride hits you in the face. Yes, my dear, I went through all sorts of things back then that I'd rather not think about - disgrace and humiliation that I haven't spoken to anyone about.""","“That’s exactly the way I talked, Hofmiller, exactly the way I thought! Get far away and the slate will be wiped clean, a tabula rasa! I’d sooner be blacking boots or washing dishes in America, I told myself, like the tales you read in the newspapers about self-made millionaires! But it takes a fair amount of money even to get to America, Hofmiller, and you don’t yet know what it means for the likes of us to have to bow and scrape. As soon as a former officer of the lancers doesn’t feel those stars on his collar any more, he can’t even stand on his own two feet with any dignity, let alone talk the way he used to. You feel stupid and embarrassed even with your best friends, and when you have to ask for something your own pride keeps you quiet. Yes, my dear boy, I went through a lot I’d rather not remember back then—humiliations, a sense of disgrace. I’ve never told anyone that before.”","‘Exactly what I told myself, Hofmiller, exactly what I thought! I just wanted to get away, and then I thought everything would be wiped out — tabula rasa! Better, I thought, be a boot-black or a dish-washer in America, like the big millionaires whose life-stories you read of in the newspapers. But, my dear Hofmiller, even to get to America you need a hell of a lot of money, and you’ve no idea what it means for the likes of us to have to kow-tow. The moment an old Uhlan no longer feels the collar with its stars round his neck, he can no longer stand squarely on his feet, still less talk as he has been used to. He sits there, tongue-tied and embarrassed even in the presence of his best friends, and when the moment comes to ask a favour, his pride chokes him. Yes, old man, I went through a good deal that I’d rather not think about — disgrace and humiliations I’ve never mentioned to anyone.’"
"Das gab nun einen vollsaftigen Skandal. Die Verwandtschaft schrie Zeter und Mordio, stürzte zu den Advokaten, und die machten die üblichen Einwendungen. Die Erblasserin sei nicht klaren Geistes gewesen, denn sie habe das Testament während einer schweren Krankheit verfaßt, sie sei überdies in einem pathologischen Hörigkeitsverhältnis zu ihrer Gesellschafterin gestanden; es bestehe kein Zweifel, daß diese listigerweise durch Suggestion den wahren Willen der Kranken vergewaltigt habe. Gleichzeitig versuchten sie die Geschichte zu einer nationalen Angelegenheit aufzubauschen; ungarische Güter, seit den Zeiten Arpads im Besitz der Orosvár, sollten nun an Ausländer, an eine Preußin, und die andere Vermögenshälfte gar an die zyrillische Kirche fallen; ganz Budapest sprach von nichts anderem, die Zeitungen füllten damit ganze Spalten. Aber trotz all dem Getöse und Geschrei der Benachteiligten stand die Sache faul. In zwei Instanzen hatten die Erben bereits den Prozeß verloren; zu ihrem Pech lebten beide Ärzte in Territtet noch und bestätigten neuerdings die seinerzeitige Vollsinnigkeit der Fürstin. Auch die andern Zeugen mußten im Kreuzverhör zugeben, die alte Fürstin sei in den letzten Jahren zwar schrullig, aber doch vollkommen klaren Sinnes gewesen. Alle Advokatentricks, alle Einschüchterungen hatten versagt, hundert zu eins war zu erwarten, daß die königliche Kurie die bisherigen Entscheidungen zugunsten der Dietzenhof nicht umstoßen werde.","That was now a full-bodied scandal. The relatives cried out loud and murder, rushed to the lawyers, and they made the usual objections. The deceased was not clear-headed, because she had written the will during a serious illness, and she was also in a pathological relationship of bondage to her companion; there is no doubt that she cunningly violated the true will of the patient by suggestion. At the same time, they tried to make history a national issue; Hungarian goods, owned by the Orosvár family since the days of Arpad, were now to go to foreigners, to a Prussian woman, and the other half of the property to the Cyrillic Church; the whole of Budapest spoke of nothing else, the newspapers filled whole columns with it. But despite all the clamor and shouting of the disadvantaged, things were stagnant. In two instances the heirs had already lost the lawsuit; to their misfortune, both doctors were still alive in Territtet and recently confirmed that the princess was sane at the time. The other witnesses, too, had to admit under cross-examination that the old princess had been whimsical in recent years, but that she had had a perfectly clear mind. All legal tricks, all intimidation had failed, it was to be expected one hundred to one that the royal curia would not overturn the previous decisions in favor of Dietzenhof.","“So now there was a full-blown scandal. The family raised hell, flocked to their lawyers, and the lawyers made the usual appeals against the will. The Princess had not been in her right mind, they said, because she had made it while she was suffering from a severe illness, and as in addition she had been pathologically dependent on her companion there could be no doubt, said the lawyers, but that the latter, through cunning suggestion, had distorted the sick woman’s true wishes. At the same time they tried to inflate the story into an affair of national importance. Were Hungarian estates that had been owned by the Orosvár family since the time of Árpád to fall into the hands of a foreigner, a Prussian woman, while what remained of the old lady’s fortune went to the Orthodox Church? Column upon column of the newspapers was devoted to the subject. But in spite of all the fuss kicked up by those involved, the family had a weak case. They had already lost it on two points—first, it was their bad luck that both doctors were still living in Territet, and confirmed once again that the Princess had been fully responsible for her actions when she made her will. And second, other witnesses had to admit under cross-questioning that while the old Princess had been cranky in her last years, her mind had been as sharp and clear as ever. All legal tricks and attempts at intimidation failed; the chances were a hundred to one that the royal court of appeal would not overturn earlier decisions in favour of Fräulein Dietzenhof.","And now there was a really first-class hullabaloo. The relatives yelled blue murder, rushed off to lawyers, and raised the usual objections to the will. The testatrix, they alleged, had been of unsound mind, for she had drawn up her will during a severe illness, and had been unduly influenced by her companion; there was no doubt that the latter had cunningly gained a hold over the Princess by the power of suggestion. At the same time they attempted to raise the whole thing to the plane of a patriotic question. Were Hungarian estates, they asked, which had been in the possession of the Orosvárs since the time of Arpad, now to pass into the hands of a foreigner, a Prussian, and the rest, if you please, to go to the Orthodox Church? Budapest could talk of nothing else, and whole columns of the newspapers were taken up with the affair. But despite the outcry raised by the injured relatives, their case was pretty hopeless. In two lower courts judgment was given against them; unfortunately for them, both the doctors in the case were still living in Territet and they reaffirmed the fact that the Princess had been in her right mind at the time of making the will. The other witnesses were also obliged to admit in cross-examination that, although the Princess had been eccentric during the last few years of her life, she had nevertheless been perfectly sane. All the usual lawyers’ tricks, all the customary methods of intimidation, proved in vain; there was a hundred to one certainty that the higher court would not reverse the judgments given in Fräulein Dietzenhof’s favour."
"Sie hat sich bis an den Tisch getastet. Mittels irgend eines Instinkts muß sie herausgefunden haben, wo ich ungefähr stehe, denn die Augen starren geradeaus auf mich, als könnten sie mich erblicken. Es ist so viel ehrliche und zugleich so viel kranke Verzweiflung in ihrem Zorn, daß ich mich unwillkürlich schäme.","She groped her way to the table. By some instinct she must have figured out roughly where I stand, because the eyes are staring straight ahead as if they might see me. There is so much honest and at the same time so much sick despair in her anger that I feel involuntarily ashamed.","She has made her way to the table. Some kind of instinct must have told her roughly where I am standing, for her eyes are staring straight at me as if they could see me. There is so much genuine and yet sick desperation in her anger that I instinctively feel ashamed of myself.","She had groped her way to the table. By some instinct she must have found out more or less where I was standing, for her eyes stared straight at me as though they could see me.

"Und wirklich, ich hatte es nicht zu bereuen, daß ich sofort zusagte. Es wurde ein richtiger gemütlicher Abend, und ich subalterner Offizier, um den sich beim Regiment niemand recht kümmerte, hatte das Gefühl, einer besonderen, völlig ungewohnten Herzlichkeit bei diesen älteren und soignierten Herren zu begegnen – offenbar hatte Kekesfalva sie auf eine besondere Weise auf mich aufmerksam gemacht. Zum erstenmal in meinem Leben behandelte mich ein höherer Vorgesetzter ohne jede rangliche Überlegenheit. Er erkundigte sich, ob ich zufrieden wäre bei meinem Regiment und wie es mit meinem Avancement stünde. Er ermutigte mich, wenn ich nach Wien käme oder sonst einmal etwas benötigte, bei ihm vorzusprechen. Der Notar wiederum, ein glatzköpfiger, munterer Mann mit einem gutmütig glänzenden Mondgesicht, lud mich in sein Haus, der Direktor der Zuckerfabrik richtete immer wieder das Wort an mich – welch eine andere Art Konversation als in unserer Offiziersmesse, wo ich jeder Meinung eines Vorgesetzten mit einem »gehorsamst« beipflichten mußte! Rascher als ich dachte, kam eine gute Sicherheit über mich, und schon nach einer halben Stunde sprach ich vollkommen ungehemmt mit.","And really, I didn't regret that I accepted immediately. It turned out to be a really cozy evening, and I, a subaltern officer whom no one really cared about in the regiment, had the feeling I encountered a special, completely unfamiliar cordiality in these older and sosigned gentlemen - apparently Kekesfalva had it on me in a special way made aware. For the first time in my life, a superior treated me without any superiority of rank. He inquired whether I was satisfied with my regiment and how things stood with my advancement. He encouraged me when I came to Vienna or needed anything else to speak to him. The notary, on the other hand, a bald, lively man with a good-naturedly shining moon face, invited me to his house, the manager of the sugar factory addressed me again and again - what a different kind of conversation than in our officers' mess, where I shared every opinion of a superior had to agree with a »most obedient«! A good self-confidence came over me sooner than I thought, and after half an hour I was speaking along completely uninhibitedly.","And sure enough, I had no reason to regret my instant acceptance of the invitation. It was a very pleasant evening, and as a junior officer of whom no one in the regiment took much notice, I felt that I met with special and unusually warm treatment from these older, more sophisticated gentlemen. Obviously Kekesfalva had made a point of drawing me to their attention. For the first time in my life, a superior officer was treating me without any of the condescension of his higher rank. Was I happy with my regiment, he asked, what were my prospects of promotion? He encouraged me to get in touch with him if I came to Vienna, or let him know if there was anything else I needed. Another of the guests, a cheerful, bald-headed notary with a kindly, shining moon face, invited me to his house, the director of the local sugar factory kept turning to ask my opinion—this was a very different kind of conversation from our talk in the officers’ mess, where I had to respond with great deference to any remark by a superior officer! I felt a pleasant sense of confidence sooner than might have been expected, and after half-an-hour I was already talking entirely at my ease.","And indeed I had no need to repent of having instantly accepted the invitation. The evening turned out to be a really pleasant one, and I, a mere subaltern, about whom nobody in the regiment bothered very much, was conscious of encountering quite unusual cordiality on the part of these elderly and distinguished gentlemen; evidently Kekesfalva had gone out of his way to draw their attention to me. For the first time in my life I was treated by a superior officer of high rank without any trace of condescension. Lieutenant-Colonel von F. inquired whether I was happy in my regiment and what were my prospects of promotion. He told me not to hesitate to call on him if I went to Vienna or needed his help at any time. The notary, a bald-headed, cheerful man with a good-natured, beaming moon of a face, invited me to his house; the director of the sugar-factory repeatedly addressed his conversation to me — and what different conversation it was from that in our mess, where I was obliged to endorse every opinion expressed by a superior officer with a ‘Just so, sir!’ Far sooner than I had expected an agreeable feeling of self-assurance stole over me, and in half an hour’s time I was joining without constraint in the conversation."
In diesem Augenblick öffnete sich die Tür und Condor trat ins Zimmer.,At that moment the door opened and Condor entered the room.,"But at that moment the door opens, and Condor comes into the room.","The door opened, and Condor entered the room."
"»Ja, liebe Klara, da bin ich schon wieder. Ich hab nur dem Herrn Leutnant rasch ein Buch hingelegt, damit er sich inzwischen nicht langweilt.«","»Yes, dear Klara, here I am again. I just gave the lieutenant a quick book so he wouldn't get bored.""","Then, quickly changing his tone of voice, he called so that he could be heard a couple of rooms away, “Back directly, dear Klara, I was just giving the Lieutenant a book to keep him occupied while he waits.”","‘Yes, my dear Klara, I’m just coming. I was just giving the Herr Leutnant a book to read, so that he shouldn’t be bored.’"
"»Wissen Sie denn überhaupt, was ein Leutnant Gage kriegt?« fuhr ich sie an. »Haben Sie schon einmal darüber nachgedacht? Also, damit Sie’s wissen: zweihundert Kronen am Ersten des Monats für die dreißig oder einunddreißig Tage und dazu die Verpflichtung, ›standesgemäß‹ zu leben. Von diesem Bettel hat er die Menage, die Wohnung, den Schneider, den Schuster und seinen ›standesgemäßen‹ Luxus zu bestreiten. Gar nicht zu reden davon, wenn, Gott behüte, einmal was mit dem Roß passiert. Und wenn er glorreich gewirtschaftet hat, dann bleiben ihm grad noch die paar Heller übrig, um in jenem Kaffeehausparadies zu schlemmen, mit dem Sie mich immer aufziehen; dort kann er, wenn er wirklich gespart hat wie ein Tagelöhner, sich alle Herrlichkeiten der Erde bei einer Schale Melange erkaufen.«","""Do you even know what a lieutenant gets paid?"" I snapped. 'Have you ever thought about it? Well, just so you know: two hundred crowns on the first of the month for the thirty or thirty-one days and the obligation to live 'befittingly'. From this beggar he has to pay for the menage, the apartment, the tailor, the shoemaker and his “befitting” luxury. Not to mention if, God forbid, something happens to the horse. And when he's done a glorious job, he'll only have a few pennies left to feast in that coffee house paradise you always tease me about; there he can, if he has really saved like a day laborer, buy all the delights of the earth with a bowl of melange.”","“Do you have any idea of a lieutenant’s pay?” I fired at her. “Have you ever stopped to think of that? Well, just for your information, two hundred crowns on the first of the month to last the full thirty or thirty-one days, and we’re expected to live on that and keep up standards in line with our station in life. On that miserly sum a lieutenant has to pay his housekeeping expenses, bed and board, the tailor, the cobbler, and those little luxuries appropriate to his rank. Not to mention his plight if (God forbid) something happens to his horse. And if he manages his budget well enough to have a few coins left over, then he can splash out in that paradise the café, the place you’re always teasing me about—ah, yes, if he’s really saved hard he can buy himself all the delicacies this world has to offer in the shape of a cup of coffee frothed with milk.”","‘Have you the remotest idea what the pay of a lieutenant is?’ I snapped. ‘Have you ever given a thought to it? Well, I may as well tell you; two hundred crowns on the first of the month, which has to last the whole thirty or thirty-one days as the case may be, and what’s more he is expected to live up to his station in life. Out of this pittance he has to pay his mess bills, his rent, his tailor’s bill, his shoemaker’s bill, and buy all the little luxuries incidental to his rank. Not to mention anything that may happen, God help him, to his horse! And if he’s managed jolly well, he’ll just have a few coppers left for carousing in that paradise of a café which you’re always throwing up at me; if he has really pinched and scraped like a labourer, he can purchase all the delights of this world in a cup of coffee.’"
"Endlich schiebt von innen eine noch unsichtbare Hand die Flügel der Tür auseinander. Es ist Ilona, die mir entgegentritt. »Wie lieb, Herr Leutnant, daß Sie gekommen sind.« Und schon führt sie mich in den mir allzu wohlbekannten Raum. In derselben Boudoirecke, auf derselben Chaiselongue hinter demselben malachitfarbenen Tisch (warum wiederholen sie die für mich so peinliche Situation?) sitzt die Gelähmte, eine weiße Pelzdecke voll und schwer über den Schoß gebreitet, so daß ihre Beine unsichtbar bleiben – offenbar soll ich »daran« nicht erinnert werden. Mit zweifellos vorbereiteter Freundlichkeit lächelt mir von ihrer Krankenecke Edith grüßend entgegen. Aber diese erste Begegnung bleibt doch ein fatales Wiedersehen, und an der genierten Art, wie sie, ein wenig angestrengt, mir die Hand über den Tisch entgegenstreckt, merke ich sofort, auch sie denkt »daran«. Keinem von uns glückt das erste verbindende Wort.","Finally, from the inside, a still invisible hand pushes the leaves of the door apart. It's Ilona who comes up to me. ""How kind of you to come, Herr Leutnant."" And then she leads me into the room I'm all too familiar with. In the same boudoir corner, on the same chaise longue, behind the same malachite-colored table (why are you repeating the situation, which is so embarrassing to me?), sits the paralytic, a white fur blanket spread full and heavy across her lap so that her legs remain invisible - apparently I'm supposed to « not to be reminded. With no doubt prepared friendliness, Edith smiles at me from her sick corner. But this first meeting remains a fatal reunion, and from the embarrassed way in which she stretches out her hand across the table, a little strained, I can tell immediately that she too is thinking ""about it."" None of us succeeds in the first connecting word.","At last a still-invisible hand pushes the two halves of the double door apart from the inside. Ilona comes towards me. “How nice of you to come, Lieutenant Hofmiller.” And she is already leading me into the room I know only too well. The lame girl is sitting in the same corner of the boudoir, on the same chaise longue behind the same malachite-green table (why are they staging a scene that was so painfully embarrassing for me again?), with a full, heavy white fur rug draped over her lap—obviously I am not to be reminded of “that occasion”. With a friendly manner no doubt rehearsed in advance, Edith greets me with a smile from her invalid’s position in the corner. But this first meeting is still an alarming encounter, and from her self-conscious way of offering me her hand across the table, clearly with a little effort, I realise at once that she thinks so too. Neither of us succeeds in bringing out the first words to draw us together.","At last an as-yet invisible hand pushed open the folding-doors from inside. It was Ilona, who now came towards me. ‘How nice of you to come, Herr Leutnant!’ she said, and conducted me straight into the only-too-familiar room. In the same corner, on the same chaise-longue, behind the same malachite-green table (why repeat a situation so painful to me?), sat the crippled girl, a voluminous white fur rug spread over her lap so that her legs were invisible — evidently I was not to be reminded of ‘it’. With obviously studied friendliness Edith smiled me a greeting from her invalid’s corner. Nevertheless it was a painful moment for both of us, this renewal of our acquaintance, and I could tell at once, from the constrained manner in which, with some effort, she held out her hand to me across the table, that she too was thinking of ‘it’. Neither of us succeeded in finding the first word to break the ice."
"In der Kaserne stelle ich eiligst das Pferd ein und laufe, um allem Geschwätz und Gratulieren auszuweichen, die Nebentreppe hinauf. Tatsächlich – vor meiner Zimmertür wartet schon Kusma; an seinem ängstlichen Gesicht, seinen gedrückten Schultern merke ich: etwas ist los. Ein Herr in Zivil warte in meinem Zimmer, meldet er mit einer gewissen Bestürzung, er habe sich nicht getraut, den Herrn abzuweisen, weil es ihm gar so dringlich gewesen. Nun hat Kusma eigentlich strengen Auftrag, niemanden in mein Zimmer zu lassen. Aber wahrscheinlich hat ihm Condor ein Trinkgeld gegeben – darum Kusmas Angst und Unsicherheit, die jedoch rasch in Verwunderung umschlägt, als ich, statt ihn auszuschelten, nur ein joviales »Schon recht«, murmle und auf die Tür losfahre. Gott sei Dank, Condor ist gekommen! Er wird mir alles erzählen.","In the barracks I hurriedly park the horse and, in order to avoid all the chatter and congratulations, I ran up the side stairs. In fact – Kusma is already waiting in front of my room door; I can tell from his anxious face and his hunched shoulders: something is going on. A gentleman in civilian clothes is waiting in my room, he reports with a certain dismay, he didn't dare to turn the gentleman away because it was so urgent for him. Now Kusma actually has a strict order not to let anyone into my room. But Condor probably gave him a tip - hence Kusma's fear and insecurity, which quickly turns to astonishment when, instead of scolding him, I just mumble a jovial ""That's right,"" and drive towards the door. Thank God, Condor has come! He will tell me everything.","On reaching the barracks I stable the horse hastily and run up the side staircase, avoiding all idle chatter and congratulations. Sure enough, Kusma is waiting outside the door of my room, and I see from his anxious face and hunched shoulders that something is up. There is a gentleman in civilian clothes waiting in my room, he announces with some dismay, and he didn’t like to turn the gentleman away because he was so very pressing. Kusma really has strict orders not to let anyone into my room, but Condor probably gave him a tip—hence Kusma’s anxiety and uncertainty. That turns to surprise when, instead of bawling him out, I just murmur amiably, “That’s all right,” and make for the door. Thank God, Condor has come! He’ll tell me everything.","Arrived at the barracks, I stabled the horse as quickly as possible and rushed up the stairs so as to avoid the chatter and congratulations of my friends. And there, to be sure, I found Kusma — waiting outside my door. From his anxious expression, his drooping shoulders, I realized something was wrong. A gentleman in mufti was waiting in my room, he told me in some consternation; he had not liked to turn the gentleman away, because his business had seemed to be so urgent. As a matter of fact, Kusma had strict instructions to let no one into my room, but probably Condor had given him a tip — hence his fear and uneasiness, which, however, quickly changed to astonishment when, instead of cursing him, I merely murmured a jovial ‘That’s all right’ and made for the door. Thank God Condor had come! He would tell me everything."

"»Bravo, bravissimo!« Alle applaudieren, Stühle krachen, der Boden dröhnt und staubt vom plötzlichen Aufspringen von vierzig oder fünfzig heiteren und ein wenig beduselten Männern. Stolz steht der Major, nimmt den Zwicker ab und faltet das Blatt zusammen, gutmütig und ein bißchen eitel den Offizieren zunickend, die ihn glückwünschend umdrängen. Ich aber nutze den Augenblick des Tumults und laufe ohne Abschied hinaus. Vielleicht merken sie’s nicht.

But I take advantage of the moment of tumult and run out without saying goodbye. Maybe they don't notice.

As for me, I seize my chance to leave the room at this moment of uproar without a word to anyone. Perhaps they won’t notice. And if they do, I don’t care, I can’t bear that laughter any more, that self-satisfied merriment, as if they were all slapping themselves on their well-filled stomachs. I can’t , I cannot stand it any more!","‘Bravo, bravissimo!’ Everyone applauded, chairs were pushed back noisily, the floor groaned, and a cloud of dust flew up as forty or fifty rowdy and slightly tipsy men suddenly shuffled to their feet. Proudly the Major stood there, removed his spectacles and rolled up his manuscript, nodding good-humouredly and a little vainly at the officers who had crowded round to congratulate him. I, however, seized the opportunity of this hullabaloo to rush off without saying any farewells. Perhaps they wouldn’t notice my absence. And even if they did, it was all the same; I simply could not stand it any longer — could not stand this laughter, this smug merriment, which seemed, as it were, to be patting itself on its full belly.

His lips, salivating slightly in his agitation, worked frantically, but I did not give him time to say anything.","He shuddered faintly like a mortally wounded animal at the final death-blow. Slobbering slightly in his agitation, his lips began to move, but I gave him no time to speak."
›Was machen S’ denn eigentlich sonst hier im Haus?‹,›What else are you doing here in the house?‹,"As she takes the keys out of the thin, shabby leather bag she is carrying, he asks, to be on the safe side, ‘What’s your position in this house, eh?’",‘What d’you actually do here?’
"»Auf morgen, auf morgen«, stammelte er dann, und fort stob der Wagen wie fortgetragen von dem nun eiskalt heranrasenden Wind. Ich stand erstarrt. Aber da schlugen bereits klatschend die ersten Tropfen los, es trommelte, prasselte, dröhnte hagelhart mir auf die Kappe, und die letzten vier, fünf Dutzend Schritte bis hinüber lief ich bereits im prasselnden Guß. Gerade als ich triefend am Tor der Kaserne anlangte, schmetterte ein Blitz nieder, straßenweit die stürmische Nacht erhellend, hinter ihm krachte der Donner, als risse er den ganzen Himmel mit sich herab. Ganz nahe mußte es eingeschlagen haben, denn die Erde wankte, und die Scheiben klirrten wie zertrümmert. Aber obwohl meine Augen von der jähen Blendung erstarrten, war ich doch nicht dermaßen erschrocken wie die eine Minute vorher, da der alte Mann in seiner rasenden Dankbarkeit meine Hand an sich gerissen und geküßt.","""Tomorrow, to tomorrow,"" he then stammered, and the car sped off as if carried away by the ice-cold wind that was now rushing towards us. I stood frozen. But then the first drops were already falling, it was drumming, pattering, hail-hard roaring on my head, and the last four, five dozen steps to get there I was already running in a pattering downpour. Just as I was dripping at the gate of the barracks, a bolt of lightning struck, illuminating the stormy night street wide, with thunder cracking behind it as if it were tearing down the whole sky with it. It must have hit very close, for the ground shook and the windows rattled as if smashed. But though my eyes froze from the sudden glare, I wasn't as startled as I had been a minute before, when the old man, in his mad gratitude, grabbed my hand and kissed it.","“I’ll see you tomorrow … tomorrow,” he stammered, and the car drove off as if blown away by the now icy wind. I stood there rooted to the spot. But the first heavy drops were falling, drumming, pelting down, echoing like hailstones on my cap, and I ran the last four or five dozen steps to the barracks through the torrent. Just as I reached the gate, dripping wet, a lightning bolt illuminated the stormy night, and after it a crash of thunder as if it were tearing the whole sky down. The lightning must have struck quite close, because the earth shook and windowpanes clinked. But although my eyes were dazzled by the garish light, I was not as shocked as I had been a moment before, when the old man had snatched up and kissed my hands in his passionate gratitude.","‘Till tomorrow, till tomorrow,’ he stammered, and the car shot off as though borne away by the raging, icy wind. I stood rooted to the spot. But at that moment the first drops came splashing down, the rain drummed, pelted, beat like hailstones on my cap, and I ran the last four or five dozen steps over to the barracks in a downpour. Just as, dripping wet, I reached the entrance, there came a blinding flash, lighting up the stormy night far and wide, and in its wake crashed the thunder, as though bringing the whole heavens down with it. It must have been quite near, for the earth trembled, and there was a clatter as though all the window-panes had been splintered to atoms. But although I winced at the sudden blinding flash, I was not half so startled as I had been a few minutes previously, when the old man in his frenzy of gratitude had seized my hand and kissed it."
"Verflucht geschickt war das von dem braunen Mädel, mit einer derart sachlichen Anfrage die erste Spannung überbrückt zu haben. Aber wie rücksichtslos wiederum, daß sie gleich darauf das Zimmer verläßt, um dem Diener Auftrag zu erteilen, denn so bleibe ich ungemütlicherweise mit meinem Opfer allein. Es wäre jetzt an der Zeit, etwas zu sagen, Konversation à tout prix zu machen. Doch mir steckt ein Pfropf in der Kehle, und auch mein Blick muß etwas Verlegenes haben, denn ich wage nicht in die Richtung des Sofas zu schauen, weil sie sonst glauben könnte, ich starre auf den Pelz, der ihre lahmen Beine verdeckt. Glücklicherweise zeigt sie sich gefaßter als ich und beginnt mit einer gewissen nervös-heftigen Art, die ich jetzt zum erstenmal an ihr kennenlerne:","It was damn clever of the brown girl to have bridged the initial tension with such a matter-of-fact inquiry. But how ruthless that she leaves the room immediately afterwards to give the servant an order, because that way I'm left uncomfortably alone with my victim. Now would be the time to say something, to make conversation à tout prix. But I've got a clog in my throat, and there must be something embarrassed about my eyes too, because I dare not look in the direction of the sofa, lest she think I'm staring at the fur covering her lame legs. Luckily she appears more composed than I do and begins with a certain nervous, violent manner that I am now getting to know in her for the first time:","Clever work on the part of the dark-haired girl to bridge the first tense moments with such a down-to-earth question. But how inconsiderate of her to leave the room next moment to go and give the servant her orders! It means that I am left alone with my victim, which is awkward. Now would be the time to say a few words, to make some kind of conversation, any kind. But I feel as if I have something stuck in my throat, and my eyes must betray my embarrassment, because I dare not look towards the sofa in case she thinks I am staring at the fur covering her paralysed legs. Luckily she proves calmer and more composed than I am, and begins talking with a certain nervous vivacity that I now notice in her for the first time.","Damned clever, that, of Ilona to have bridged the first moment of tension with such a practical question! But it was ruthless of her to leave the room now to order tea, for I, to my discomfiture, was left alone with my victim. It was high time now to say something, to make conversation at all costs. But there was a lump in my throat and there must have been a trace of embarrassment in my gaze; I did not venture to look in the direction of the sofa, for fear she might think I was staring at the rug which concealed her crippled legs. Fortunately she showed herself to be more composed than I, and she opened the conversation with a certain excitable vehemence of manner which I remarked in her for the first time."
"»Du Toni«, sagt er drohend, »diesen Ton verbitt ich mir. Man wird bei der Menasch vielleicht noch seine Spassetteln machen dürfen. Ob’s dir woanders besser schmeckt, da hast recht, das ist deine Sach, das geht mich nix an. Aber an unserm Tisch werd ich mir noch erlauben dürfen, zu bemerken, daß d’ unser Mittagessen stehnläßt.«","""You Toni,"" he says menacingly, ""I don't want that tone. One will perhaps still be allowed to make jokes at the Menasch. Whether you like it better somewhere else, you're right, that's your business, that's none of my business. But at our table I shall still be allowed to remark that our lunch is left unturned.”","“Don’t you take that tone with me,” he says menacingly. “I suppose a man may be allowed his little witticisms! If you can eat better elsewhere, fair enough, that’s your business. But at our table here in this mess I’ll allow myself to point out that you’re turning up your nose at our midday meal.”","‘Now look here, Toni,’ he said threateningly, ‘I don’t like your tone. Surely we can go on cracking our little jokes in the mess! If you like it better elsewhere, all right, that’s your affair, not mine. But I still have a right to remark at our table that you’re not touching your lunch!’"
"»Aber wieso denn, Herr von Kekesfalva … das ist doch wirklich nur eine Kleinigkeit.«","""But why, Herr von Kekesfalva ... that's really just a small thing.""","“But Herr von Kekesfalva, it’s nothing … it’s only a small thing for me to do.” “No, it’s not a small thing … it will be a great, a very great service that you do me.",‘But it’s no trouble at all ... it’s a mere trifle.’
"Doch da klirrt abermals eine Gabel stillegebietend an ein Glas. Es ist der Major Wondraczek, der jeden Anlaß benützt, um seinen poetischen Fimmel in humoristischen Versen und Schnadahüpfeln zu entladen. Wir wissen alle: sobald Wondraczek aufsteht, sein respektables Bäuchlein an den Tisch lehnt und ein pfiffiges und zwinkerndes Gesicht zu machen versucht, beginnt unaufhaltsam der »lustige Teil« des Kameradschaftsabends.","But then again a fork clinked against a glass, commanding silence. It's Major Wondraczek, who uses every opportunity to unload his poetic craze in humorous verses and pranks. We all know that as soon as Wondraczek gets up, leans his respectable tummy against the table and tries to make a smart and winking face, the ""fun part"" of the camaraderie evening begins inexorably.","But then a fork is tapped on a glass once more, requesting silence. This time it is Major Wondraczek, who never misses a chance to air his poetic talents in humorous verse and comic song. We all know when Wondraczek gets to his feet, propping his imposing paunch against the table with a roguish, meaning leer on his face, that the risqué part of the evening’s festivities is inevitably about to begin.","But at this moment a fork was tinkled against a glass to call for silence. Major Wondraczek, who seized every opportunity of displaying his poetic talents by declaiming humorous verses and extempore doggerel, had got to his feet. The moment he rose, rested his comfortable little paunch on the table and tried to assume a sly, knowing expression, we all knew that the ‘matey’ part of the evening had begun, and that nothing could stop it."
"Kekesfalva, erklärt er mir, sei der reichste Mann im ganzen Umkreis. Einfach alles gehöre ihm, nicht nur das Schloß Kekesfalva – »Sie müssen’s doch kennen, man sieht’s vom Exerzierplatz aus, links von der Chaussee das gelbe Schloß mit dem flachen Turm und dem großen, alten Park« – sondern auch die große Zuckerfabrik an der Straße nach R. und das Sägewerk in Bruck und dann in M. das Gestüt; all das gehöre ihm und dazu sechs oder sieben Häuser in Budapest und Wien. »Ja, das möchte man nicht glauben, daß es bei uns solche steinreiche Leute gibt, und zu leben weiß der wie ein richtiger Magnat. Im Winter im kleinen Wiener Palais in der Jacquingasse, den Sommer in Kurorten; hier führt er grade nur im Frühjahr ein paar Monate Haus, aber, Herrgott noch einmal, was für ein Haus! Quartette aus Wien, Champagner und französische Weine, das Erste vom Ersten, das Beste vom Besten!« Nun, wenn er mir damit gefällig sein könne, werde er mich gerne dort einführen, denn – große Geste der Genugtuung – er sei mit Herrn von Kekesfalva befreundet, habe in früheren Jahren oft geschäftlich mit ihm zu tun gehabt und wisse, daß er Offiziere immer gern bei sich sehe; nur ein Wort koste es ihn, und ich sei eingeladen.","Kekesfalva, he tells me, is the richest man around. Everything belongs to him, not only Kekesfalva Castle - ""You must know it, you can see it from the parade ground, to the left of the road is the yellow castle with the flat tower and the big, old park"" - but also the big sugar factory on the street after R. and the sawmill in Bruck and then in M. the stud farm; all of that belongs to him, along with six or seven houses in Budapest and Vienna. 'Yes, you wouldn't want to believe that we have such filthy rich people, and they know how to live like a real magnate. In winter in the small Viennese palace on Jacquingasse, in summer in health resorts; he only has a house here for a few months in the spring, but, goodness gracious, what a house! Quartets from Vienna, champagne and French wines, the first of the first, the best of the best!' Well, if he could please me with that, he would be happy to introduce me there, because - a big gesture of satisfaction - he was with Herr von Kekesfalva friends, had often had business dealings with him in earlier years and know that he always likes to see officers; it only costs him a word, and I'm invited.","Kekesfalva, he explains to me, is the richest man in the whole district. Absolutely everything belongs to him, not just Kekesfalva Castle—“You must know the castle, it can be seen from the parade ground, it’s over to the left of the road, the yellow castle with the low tower and the large old park.” Kekesfalva also owns the big sugar factory on the road to R, the sawmill in Bruck and the stud farm in M. They are all his property, as well as six or seven apartment blocks in Vienna and Budapest. “You might not think that we had such wealthy folk here, but he lives the life of a real magnate. In winter, he goes to his little Viennese palace in Jacquingasse, in summer he visits spa resorts, he stays at home here only for a few months in spring, but heavens above, what a household he keeps! Visiting quartets from Vienna, champagne and French wines, the best of everything!” And if it would interest me, says the pharmacist, he will be happy to take me to the castle, for —here he makes a grand gesture of self-satisfaction—he is on friendly terms with Herr von Kekesfalva, has often done business with him in the past, and knows that he is always glad to welcome army officers to his house. My chess partner has only to say the word, and I’ll be invited.","Kekesfalva, he explained, was the richest man in the whole neighbourhood. Practically everything belonged to him, not only the Kekesfalva estate — ‘you must know the house, you can see it from the parade-ground, the yellow house to the left of the high-road with the flat tower and the huge park’ — but also the big sugar-factory on the road to R., the saw-mill in Brück and the stud-farm in M.; they all belonged to him, and six or seven blocks of houses in Budapest and Vienna as well. ‘Yes, you’d scarcely believe that we can count such colossally rich people among our neighbours. Why, he lives like a grandee! In winter in the little palace in the Jacquingasse in Vienna, and in the summer in various watering-places; he only keeps his house here open for a few months in the spring, but lord, what style he lives in! Quartets from Vienna, champagne and French wines, everything tip-top, the best of everything.’ And incidentally, if I cared, he’d be only too glad to give me an introduction, for — with an expansive and complacent gesture — he was on the best of terms with Herr von Kekesfalva, had had frequent business dealings with him in the past and knew that he was always glad to welcome officers to his house. A word from him and I should receive an invitation."
"Doch Condor drängte immer noch nach. »Nun? Leugnen Sie’s doch ab! Zeigen Sie endlich etwas von dem Mut, zu dem Sie professionell verpflichtet sind!«","But Condor was still pushing. ""So? Deny it! Finally show some of the courage that you are professionally obligated to have!«","But Condor still persisted. “Well, don’t deny it! Show some courage for once. It’s your professional duty.”","I could see the paving-stones far below, could see everything at that moment as though it were really happening, as though it had already happened, and there was a roaring in my ears as though I myself were plunging down those five storeys into the depths below. ‘Well? Can you deny it?’ Condor went on persistently. ‘ Let us see something of that courage which you profess as a soldier!’"
Kapitel 8,Chapter 8,"I had told Kekesfalva that it was “only a small thing” to do as he wished and ask the doctor, whom I did not yet know at all, as unselfconsciously as possible about the lame girl’s prospects of a cure, and if you looked at it from the outside","A ‘trifle’, I had called Kekesfalva’s request that I should inquire as casually as possible of a doctor whom I had not yet met what were the prospects of the crippled girl’s recovery; and, looked at dispassionately"

Wie damals ist es, als ob ein Lufthauch sie aufgeweht hätte, nur kommt diesmal die Stimme gütig und herzlich mir entgegen.","The door opens, timidly, uncertainly.

"Kanitz war zu bestürzt, um ein Wort zu finden. Er sah nur, erschütterten Gefühls, daß kein Zorn in ihr war, sondern bloß Angst. Daß sie über die Unsinnigkeit seines plötzlichen Antrags genau so erschrocken war wie er selbst. Keiner hatte den Mut, zum andern zu sprechen, keiner den Mut, den andern anzuschauen. Aber sie reiste an diesem Vormittag nicht ab. Sie blieben von früh bis abends beisammen. Nach drei Tagen wiederholte er seinen Antrag, und nach zwei Monaten heirateten sie.«","Kanitz was too taken aback to find a word. He only saw, with shaken feelings, that there was no anger in her, only fear. That she was just as shocked as he was by the absurdity of his sudden proposal. No one had the courage to speak to the other, no one had the courage to look at the other. But she did not leave that morning. They stayed together from morning to night. After three days he repeated his proposal, and after two months they were married.”","“Kanitz was in too much consternation to find a word. He just saw, to his astonishment, that she was not angry but simply afraid. She was as alarmed by his sudden, senseless proposal as he was himself. Neither had the courage to speak to the other, neither had the courage even to look at the other. But she did not leave Vienna that morning. They spent all day together, from morning to evening. Three days later he proposed again, and two months after that they were married.”","Kanitz was too upset to find words. He only realized, in his shattered state, that she felt no vestige of anger, but only fear. That she was as taken aback by the absurdity of his sudden proposal as he himself.

"»So kannst nicht hinaufkommen zu meiner Frau«, lachte mich Balinkay an. »Du schaust ja aus, als hätt man einen Mehlsack über dich ausgeschüttet. Und vielleicht macht sich’s überhaupt besser, ich red mit ihr allein, da sprech ich mich viel freier aus und du brauchst dich nicht zu genieren. Am gescheitsten, du gehst in die Garderob’, waschst dich gründlich ab und setzt dich hinein in die Bar. Ich komm in paar Minuten und geb dir Bescheid. Und sorg dich nicht. Ich dreh’s schon so, wie du’s willst.«","""You can't come up to my wife like that,"" Balinkay laughed at me. 'You look like you've had a sack of flour poured over you. And maybe it'll be better, I'll talk to her alone, I'll express myself much more freely and you don't have to be embarrassed. The smart thing to do is go to the cloakroom, wash yourself off thoroughly and sit down in the bar. I'll be there in a few minutes and let you know. And don't worry. I'll do it the way you want it.""","“Hey, you can’t come up and meet my wife like that!” laughed Balinkay, looking at me. “Anyone would think someone had tipped a sack of flour all over you. And maybe it would be better for me to have a word with her alone first —I can speak more freely then, and there’ll be nothing for you to feel awkward about. I think you’d better go to the cloakroom, have a good wash, and then sit in the bar. I’ll come back in a few minutes’ time and tell you what she says. And don’t worry, I’ll make sure it goes the way you want.”","‘You can’t come up and meet my wife in your present condition,’ laughed Balinkay. ‘You look as though someone has emptied a sack of flour over you.

"In äußerster Besorgnis war ich aufgesprungen, als sie sich, mit blitzenden Augen, gefährlich tief über die Balustrade beugte, und ich packte rasch ihren Arm. Aber, als hätte ihr Feuer die Haut angesprüht, zuckte sie auf und schrie mich an:","I had jumped to my feet in utter concern as she bent dangerously low over the balustrade, eyes blazing, and I quickly grabbed her arm. But, as if her fire had sprayed the skin, she jumped and yelled at me:","I had jumped up in great alarm when she leant dangerously far over the balustrade, her eyes flashing, and I quickly took her arm. But as if fire had touched her skin, she flinched, screaming at me.","As, her eyes flashing, she leaned dangerously far over the balustrade, I jumped up in an agony of anxiety and seized her quickly by the arm. But she shrank away as though fire had seared her skin."
"»Das also war’s«, knurrte er unwillig. »Und ich Dummkopf konnte so was übersehen! Immer wieder dasselbe, daß man hinter der Krankheit den Kranken nicht mehr spürt. Mit diesem akkuraten Untersuchen und Herumtasten nach allen Symptomen greift man gerade am Wesentlichen vorbei, an dem, was in dem Menschen selber vorgeht. Das heißt – etwas habe ich gleich bei dem Mädel gespürt; Sie erinnern sich, wie ich nach der Untersuchung den Alten fragte, ob nicht jemand anderer in die Behandlung eingegriffen hätte – dieser plötzliche und hitzige Wille, rasch-rasch gesund zu werden, hatte mich sofort stutzig gemacht. Ich hatte schon ganz richtig getippt, daß da jemand Fremder im Spiel war. Aber ich Schwachkopf dachte nur an einen Barbier oder Magnetiseur; ich glaubte, irgendein Hokuspokus hätt ihr den Kopf verdreht. Einzig an das Einfachste, das Logische habe ich nicht gedacht, nur an das nicht, was klar auf der Hand lag. Verliebtheit gehört im Übergangsalter doch geradezu organisch zu einem Mädchen. Nur vertrackt, daß das gerade jetzt passieren muß und derart vehement – o Gott, das arme, das arme Kind!«","""So that's it,"" he growled indignantly. 'And I, a fool, could overlook something like that! The same thing over and over again, that behind the illness one no longer senses the sick person. With this accurate examination and groping around for all symptoms, you just miss the essential thing, what is going on in the person himself. That means – I felt something about the girl right away; You remember how, after the examination, I asked the old man if someone else had intervened in the treatment - this sudden and heated will to get well quickly made me suspicious. I had guessed correctly that there was someone else involved. But I moron only thought of a barber or magnetizer; I thought some mumbo-jumbo had turned her head. The only thing I didn't think about was the simplest, the most logical thing, just not what was obvious. Falling in love is an almost organic part of a girl in the transitional age. It's just dodgy that this has to happen right now and so vehemently - oh God, the poor, poor child!'","“So that was it,” he said quietly, sadly. “And fool that I was, I overlooked a thing like that. It’s always the same —you don’t see the invalid behind the malady. For all our accuracy in examination and diagnosis of symptoms, we can miss the essence of what is going on in a human being. That’s to say, I did feel something different about the girl; you’ll remember that I asked the old man, directly after examining her, whether anyone else had been treating her—and that sudden, heated desire to get better quickly, quickly, did make me wonder. Yes, I wondered whether someone else was involved, and I was right. But idiot that I was, I thought only of some quack or hypnotist. I suspected that some kind of mumbo-jumbo might have turned her head. The one thing that didn’t occur to me was the simplest, most logical of explanations. Falling in love is practically an organic phenomenon in girls of that age. How infuriating that it had to happen just now, and so forcefully—oh God, that poor, poor child!”","‘So that was it!’ he growled in a tone of self-dissatisfaction. ‘ And to think I was fool enough not to see it all! It’s always the same — you cease to see the patient for the illness. What with all this careful examining and exploring of the symptoms, the essential feature of the situation, what’s going on inside the patient, eludes you. That is to say — I felt at once that something was the matter with the girl. You remember how after my examination of her the other day I asked the old man whether another doctor had not been called in — I was quite nonplussed by that sudden, feverish desire to be well all in a moment. I had guessed quite rightly that some stranger had been meddling in the case. But, dunderhead that I am, I thought only of a quack or a hypnotist; I imagined that her head had been turned by some sort of hocus-pocus. But I never thought of the most simple, the logical, explanation, the one that was staring me in the face. The girl’s at the very age for falling in love. The pity of it is that it should have to happen just at this moment, and with such violence. Oh God, the poor, poor child!’"
"Aber ich hatte keine Wahl. Noch ehe die Seele bewußt die Gefahr begriff, hatte der Körper in mir die jähe Umarmung schon abgewehrt. Immer sind die Instinkte wissender als unsere wachen Gedanken; bereits in dieser ersten Sekunde des Erschreckens, da ich mich wegriß von ihrer gewalttätigen Zärtlichkeit, hatte ich dumpf alles vorausgewußt. Gewußt, daß ich nie die Heilandskraft haben würde, die Verstümmelte so zu lieben, wie sie mich liebte, und wahrscheinlich nicht einmal genug Mitleid, um diese mich entnervende Leidenschaft nur zu ertragen. In diesem ersten Augenblick des Zurückflüchtens hatte ich schon geahnt: hier gab es keinen Ausweg, keinen Mittelweg. Einer mußte unglücklich werden durch diese unsinnige Liebe oder der andere, und vielleicht alle beide.","But I had no choice. Even before my soul consciously understood the danger, my body had already warded off the sudden embrace. The instincts are always more knowing than our waking thoughts; Even in that first second of terror, when I tore myself away from her violent tenderness, I had dimly known everything in advance. Knowing that I would never have the Saviour's power to love the mutilated woman as she loved me, and probably not even enough compassion to endure this unnerving passion. In that first moment of fleeing back I had already suspected: there was no way out here, no middle way. One had to be unhappy with this senseless love or the other, and maybe both of them.","But I had no choice. Even before I consciously understood the danger, my body had put up its own defences to her abrupt embrace. Our instincts are always wiser than our waking thoughts, and in that first second of horror when I tore myself away from the love she was forcing on me, I already felt a dark premonition of what was to come. I knew I would never have the saintly strength to love the crippled girl as she loved me, probably not even enough pity simply to bear her passion. It racked my nerves. I already guessed, in that first reaction of flight, that there was no way out for me, no middle course that I could take. One or other of us must be made unhappy by this ridiculous love of hers, and perhaps it would be both.","But I had no choice. Even before my mind had consciously realized the danger, my body had revolted against that sudden embrace. Our instincts are always more prescient than our waking thoughts; in that very first moment of horror, when I had torn myself away from her violent caresses, I had dimly foreseen this, known that I should never have the selfless strength to love the crippled girl as she loved me, and, probably, not even enough pity simply to bear with this unnerving passion. At the first recoil I had divined that there was no way out, no middle course. Either the one or the other of us, perhaps both, was bound to be made unhappy by this futile love."
"Unwillkürlich spüre ich eine starke Sympathie für diesen fremden Menschen. Er hat eine so sichere Art in jeder Bewegung und dazu den hellen warmen Blick der Leichtsinnigen und Leichtlebigen. Und kaum daß dieser unvermutete Gruß mich anruft, blitzt plötzlich in mir der Gedanke auf: dem könntest du dich anvertrauen. Und im winzigen Raum einer Sekunde schließt sich mit jener rapiden Geschwindigkeit, mit der unser Gehirn in angespannten Momenten funktioniert, an jenen ersten Gedanken schon eine ganze Kette. Er ist in Zivil, er ist sein eigener Herr. Er hat selber Ähnliches durchgemacht. Er hat dem Schwager des Ferencz geholfen, er hilft jedem gern, warum sollte er nicht auch mir behilflich sein?

He has such a sure manner in every movement and in addition the bright, warm look of the frivolous and light-hearted. And as soon as this unexpected greeting calls me, the thought suddenly flashes in me: you could confide in him. And in the tiny space of a second, with the rapid speed with which our brain works in tense moments, a whole chain already closes on those first thoughts. He's in civilian clothes, he's his own boss. He's been through something similar himself. He helped Ferencz's brother-in-law, he likes to help everyone, why shouldn't he help me too? Before I've even caught my breath, this whole flying, shimmering chain of lightning-fast thoughts has already welded together into a sudden decision. I gather courage and approach Balinkay.","I feel a strong, instinctive liking for this stranger. His movements are so free and easy, and he has the warm, bright eyes of a man who takes life as it comes. And as soon as I hear his unexpected greeting, an idea flashes into my mind—you could confide in him, I tell myself. Within a fraction of a second, at the speed with which the brain works at moments of great tension, I have associated a whole chain of other ideas with this first one. He is in civilian clothes, he’s his own master. He’s been through something similar to my plight himself. He helped Ferencz’s brother-in-law, they say he helps anyone who asks him, why wouldn’t he help me? Before I’ve even taken a deep breath, this whole swiftly forming chain of thought has coalesced into an abrupt decision. I pluck up my courage and go closer to Balinkay.","I could not help being conscious of a strong bond of sympathy with this stranger.

And no sooner had his unexpected greeting fallen on my ears than the thought suddenly flashed across my mind: here’s a man you can confide in. And within the space of a second a whole chain of thoughts joined themselves on to the first with that rapidity with which the brain functions at moments of extreme tension: He’s in mufti, he’s his own master! He’s been through the same sort of thing. He helped Ferencz’s brother-in-law, he’s only too pleased to help anyone, so why shouldn’t he lend me a helping hand too? Before I had time to get my breath this fleeting, flickering chain of lightning reflections was welded into a sudden resolve. I plucked up courage and went up to Balinkay."
Ich stand stramm. Er kam auf mich zu.,I stood to attention. He approached me.,I stood to attention. The Colonel came over to me.,I stood to attention. He came up to me.

"Kanitz überlegte einen Augenblick. Der Abschied war gestern so aufwühlend für ihn gewesen, daß er Angst hatte, eine neue Begegnung könnte diese gute Erinnerung zerstören. Aber dann entschloß er sich doch und betrat, die Bonbonnière und die Blumen in je einer Hand, das Frühstückszimmer.","Kanitz thought for a moment. Saying goodbye yesterday had been so upsetting for him that he was afraid a new encounter might destroy this good memory. But then he made up his mind and entered the breakfast room, holding the bonbonnière and the flowers in each hand.","“Kanitz thought about it for a moment. Yesterday’s parting had moved him so much that he was afraid another meeting might spoil that beautiful memory.

"Die rückwärtige Tür, durch die Ilona sich entfernt hatte, beginnt sich leise in den Scharnieren zu bewegen. Hastig, wie ertappt, mit einem trockenen, knallenden Wurf klappt Edith die Schatulle zu. Es klingt wie ein Befehl, den sie mir jetzt zuwirft:","The back door, through which Ilona had gone, begins to move quietly on the hinges. Hastily, as if caught, Edith closes the box with a dry, cracking throw. It sounds like an order that she is now throwing at me:","The door behind us through which Ilona disappeared begins to move slightly on its hinges.

Hastily, as though caught out in some piece of mischief, Edith closed the box with a sharp, resounding snap."
"Condor zog die Uhr. »Dreiviertel elf. Da bleiben uns noch zwei geschlagene Stunden. Mein Zug geht erst um ein Uhr zwanzig.

""Quarter to eleven. We still have two full hours. My train doesn't leave until one twenty. But I don't think such things can be told well on the highway.

Dann kommt Kusma wieder zurück, einen Brief in der Hand.","""Not to speak for anyone,"" I order the boy. He jumps away obediently, for a moment there is a whisper outside in the hall. Then Kusma comes back with a letter in his hand.","“Tell them I’m not available,” I order my batman. He scuttles obediently off, and there is a moment’s whispering outside my room.

"»Nicht! Ich bitte Sie, nicht!« sagte ich und legte, mich nahe heranbeugend, um sie zu beruhigen, die Hand auf ihren Arm. Sofort lief es wie ein elektrischer Schlag über die Schultern hin und dann wie ein Riß quer durch den ganzen in sich gekrümmten Leib.","""Not! Please don't!' I said, leaning close to calm her and putting my hand on her arm. Immediately it ran like an electric shock across the shoulders and then like a tear right through the whole hunched body.","“Oh, don’t—I do beg you, don’t!” I said, and leaning closer I placed my hand on her arm to soothe her. At once a tremor like an electric shock ran through her shoulders and then right through her convulsed body.","‘Don’t, don’t, I implore you!’ I said, and, bending over her, laid my hand on her arm to calm her. It was as though an electric current had run up her arm to the shoulder and then right through her whole contorted body."
"Ich zünde die Zigarette an. Bloß einen Augenblick sitzenbleiben, den dösigen Kopf in beide Hände gestützt, und denken, nachdenken, durchdenken, eins nach dem andern. Also – ich habe mich verlobt … man hat mich verlobt … aber das gilt doch nur … nein, kein Ausweichen, das gilt, das gilt … ich habe sie auf den Mund geküßt, freiwillig habe ich’s getan. Aber doch nur, um sie zu beruhigen, und weil ich wußte, daß sie nie geheilt wird … sie ist doch eben wieder hingefallen wie ein Stock … so jemanden kann man doch gar nicht heiraten, das ist doch keine wirkliche Frau, das ist doch … aber sie werden mich nicht lassen, nein, die geben mich nicht mehr frei … der Alte, der Djinn, der Djinn, der Djinn mit dem melancholischen Biedermanngesicht und der goldenen Brille, der krampft sich an mich an, der läßt sich nicht abschütteln … immer hält er mich am Arm, immer wird er mich zurückzerren an meinem Mitleid, meinem verfluchten Mitleid. Morgen erzählen sie’s schon herum in der ganzen Stadt, in die Zeitung werden sie’s setzen, und dann gibt’s kein Zurück … Ob’s nicht besser wäre, vielleicht schon jetzt die zu Haus vorzubereiten, damit’s die Mutter, der Vater nicht von andern oder gar aus der Zeitung erfahren? Ihnen erklären, warum und wieso ich mich verlobt habe, und daß es nicht so eilig ist und nicht so gemeint war, daß ich mich nur aus Mitleid in die ganze Sache eingelassen habe … Ah, dieses verfluchte Mitleid, dieses verfluchte Mitleid! Und schon gar im Regiment werden sie’s nicht verstehen, kein einziger von den Kameraden. Was hat der Steinhübel nur gesagt vom Balinkay?","I light the cigarette. Just sit there for a moment with your drowsy head in your hands and think, think, think, one thing at a time. So - I got engaged ... I was engaged ... but that's only valid ... no, don't dodge it, that's valid, that's valid ... I kissed her on the mouth, I did it voluntarily.

Tomorrow they'll be telling the whole town about it, they'll put it in the newspaper, and then there'll be no turning back...

Explain to them how and why I got engaged and that there is no hurry and that it was not meant that I got involved in the whole thing out of pity... Ah, the damn pity, the damn pity! And especially in the regiment they won't understand it, not a single one of their comrades. What did Steinhübel say about Balinkay?","I light my cigarette. I’ll just stay sitting for a moment, my dazed head propped on both hands, and think, think, think it all out point by point. Right— so I got engaged … I was obliged to get engaged … but that doesn’t count because … no, no wriggling out of it, it does count, it does. I kissed her on the mouth, I did it of my own accord. But only to set her mind at rest, and because I knew she will never get better … she fell full length like a block of wood , how can I marry someone like that , she’s not a real woman , she’s … but they won’t let me go, they’ll never set me free … the old man, the djinn, the djinn with the face of an honest citizen and the gold-rimmed glasses, the djinn clinging to me, holding my arm, he’ll always drag me back to my pity, my damn sense of pity. Tomorrow the news will be all round the town, they’ll put a notice in the paper, and then there’s no going back … Might it be better to prepare my mother and father at home for the news so that they don’t hear it from someone else, even maybe from the newspaper? Should I explain why and how I got engaged, and say there’s no hurry about it , I didn’t really intend to do it, it was only out of pity I got embroiled in the whole thing? My pity, my damn pity! They certainly won’t understand it in the regiment, not one of my comrades will understand. What was it Steinhübel said about Balinkay?","I lit the cigarette. I’ll just sit here for a moment or two, I said to myself, resting my dazed head in my hands, and think, reflect, turn over things in my mind, one after another. Well there it is!

"Wie den leibhaftigen Satan fürchtete ihn die Mannschaft, der er für jede Nichtigkeit Spangen und Arrest aufrasselte und manchmal im Zorn sogar seine derbe Faust ins Gesicht drosch. Selbst habe ich’s erlebt, wie ein ruthenischer Ulan einmal im Stall, als der »blade Frosch« – so nannten wir ihn, weil sein feister Hals sich im Zorn bis zum Platzen blähte – schon in der Nachbarbox tobte, auf russische Weise das Kreuz schlug und mit bebenden Lippen ein Stoßgebet herzusagen begann. Bis zur Erschöpfung hußte Bubencic die armen Burschen herum, er karniffelte sie, ließ sie Karabinerübungen wiederholen, daß ihnen die Arme krachten, und auf den stützigsten Pferden solange reiten, bis ihnen das Blut aus den Hosen lief. Erstaunlicherweise aber liebten die biedern bäuerlichen Opfer ihren Tyrannen auf ihre dumpfe und ängstliche Weise mehr als all die milderen und dafür auch distanzierteren Offiziere. Es war, als ob irgendein Instinkt ihnen sagte, daß diese Härte aus einem eigensinnig bornierten Willen nach gottgewollter Ordnung stammte; überdies tröstete es die armen Teufel, daß wir Offiziere nicht viel besser wegkamen, denn selbst die schlimmste Fuchtel nimmt der Mensch sofort leichter hin, sobald er weiß, daß sie gleich hart auf des Nachbars Rücken fällt. Gerechtigkeit gleicht Gewalt geheimnisvoll aus: immer wieder wärmten die Soldaten mit gutem Behagen die Geschichte vom jungen Prinzen W. auf, der mit dem allerhöchsten Kaiserhaus verwandt war und darum glaubte, sich allerhand besondere Schnacken erlauben zu dürfen. Aber Bubencic verknallte ihn ebenso unbarmherzig auf vierzehn Tage wie irgend einen Häuslerssohn; vergebens, daß aus Wien Exzellenzen anriefen. Bubencic schenkte dem hohen Delinquenten nicht einen einzigen Tag seiner Strafe – ein Trotz übrigens, der ihn damals sein Avancement kostete.","The crew feared him like Satan incarnate, and for every triviality he threw out braces and arrests, and sometimes in anger even threw his fist in the face. I've experienced it myself, like a Ruthenian Ulan once in the stable when the ""blade frog"" - that's what we called him because his fat neck was bloated in anger until it burst - was already raging in the neighboring box, crossed in the Russian way and began to recite a prayer with trembling lips. Bubencic pushed the poor fellows around until they were exhausted, he carnivored them, made them repeat carbine drills until their arms cracked, and made them ride the most supportive horses until the blood ran out of their trousers. Surprisingly, however, the staid peasant victims loved their tyrant in their dull and timid way more than all the milder and therefore more distant officers. It was as if some instinct told them that this harshness came from a stubbornly narrow-minded will to God's order; Moreover, it was a comfort to the poor devils that we officers didn't fare much better, because people take even the worst fist more easily as soon as they know that it will soon fall hard on their neighbor's back. Justice balances violence mysteriously: again and again the soldiers warmed up the story of the young Prince W., who was related to the highest imperial family and therefore believed that he could allow himself all sorts of special jokes. But Bubencic had a crush on him for a fortnight just as ruthlessly as any cottager's son; in vain that Excellencies called from Vienna. Bubencic did not give the high delinquent a single day of his sentence - a defiance, by the way, that cost him his advancement at the time.","The men themselves feared him like the Devil incarnate. He would have them on fatigues or in the cells for the least little thing, and sometimes he even drove his heavy fist into a man’s face in his fury. We called the Colonel the Bullfrog because of the way his fat neck swelled almost to bursting point in anger. Once, when he was letting fly in a box in the stables, I myself saw a Ruthenian in the neighbouring box make the sign of the cross in the Russian way and utter a fervent prayer. Bubencic drove the poor fellows to the point of exhaustion, hitting out at them, making them repeat their rifle drill until their arms were nearly breaking, and forcing them to ride the most recalcitrant horses until the blood ran down their thighs. Oddly enough, however, his honest rustic victims preferred this tyrant, in their dull and intimidated way, to all the officers who took a less harsh line with the men, but preserved their personal distance. It was as if some kind of instinct in them said that this severity from a stubborn and bigoted man was decreed by divine providence, and it cheered the poor devils that we officers were no more immune than they were to his outbursts, for you immediately find it easier to take the worst punishment if you know that it may hit your neighbour just as hard. In some mysterious way, equal treatment compensates for violence. The men always liked telling the story of young Prince W, who was related to the imperial family, no less, and therefore thought that he could do as he liked. But Bubencic had him in the cells for two weeks like any huckster’s son, and wouldn’t relent, however many dignitaries phoned from Vienna to plead for leniency for Prince W. The noble delinquent was not spared a day of his detention—an act of defiance, incidentally, that cost Bubencic any further promotion.","The men feared him as though he were the Devil incarnate, for he would shower fatigues and punishments on them, and sometimes, in his fury, would even punch a man full in the face with his great fist. I myself had on one occasion in the stables seen a Ruthenian Uhlan make the sign of the Cross and tremblingly mutter a short prayer when the ‘old bull-frog’ — we called him that because his fat throat swelled to bursting-point in his fury — was rampaging away in an adjoining box. Bubencic chivvied the wretched lads to the point of exhaustion, cuffed them, made them do rifle drill until their arms almost broke, and compelled them to ride the most restive horses until their legs were chafed and bleeding. Surprisingly enough, however, in their obtuse and frightened way these good peasant lads were fonder of their tyrant than of more lenient and yet more aloof officers. It was as though some instinct told them that this severity of the Colonel’s had its origin in an obstinate and narrow desire for a divinely ordained state of order. The poor devils, moreover, were consoled by the knowledge that we officers did not come off very much more lightly, for a human being will accept the strictest disciplinary measures with a better grace if he knows that they will fall with equal severity on his neighbour. Justice in some mysterious way makes up for violence. Again and again the soldiers were cheered by the story of young Prince W.; related to the Imperial family, he had imagined that he could claim all sorts of special privileges, but Bubencic had sentenced him to fourteen days’ detention just as ruthlessly as though he had been a peasant’s son; in vain distinguished personages had rung up from Vienna to intervene; Bubencic had refused to remit a single day of the young aristocrat’s sentence — a piece of defiance, incidentally, that cost him his promotion."

Oh no! What am I supposed to do here alone in the big house? ... No, no, I'll leave as soon as everything's settled.'","“‘I—stay here?’ She instinctively raises her hands as if to fend off something undesirable. ‘ Here? Oh no, no! What would I do in this big house all by myself? No, I’ll be leaving just as soon as everything’s been settled.’","‘I?’ Involuntarily she threw up her hands, as though to ward off something disagreeable. ‘ I? No, oh no!

"Also nicht wahr, alles in Ordnung? Die schönsten Rosen, gut arrangiert in einem Korb, und zuverlässig gleich abgeschickt! Aber da läuft mir die Frau Gurtner verzweifelt auf die Straße nach.

The most beautiful roses, well arranged in a basket, and reliably sent straight away! But then Frau Gurtner desperately follows me down the street.

To the Villa Kekesfalva, I order, and thanks to Ilona's startled exclamation I remember my poor victim's first name in good time: for Miss Edith von Kekesfalva.","But now surely all would be well again? The finest of roses, well arranged in a basket, sure to be sent off at once! However, Frau Gurtner runs down the street after me in desperate pursuit. Where are they to go, then?

To the Villa Kekesfalva, I say, and just in time, thanks to Ilona’s dreadful outburst, I remember my poor victim’s first name; they are for Fräulein Edith von Kekesfalva.","So now all was well, wasn’t it? The most lovely roses, beautifully arranged in a basket, to be delivered without fail. But at this point Frau Gurtner came running excitedly after me down the street.

To the Villa Kekesfalva, I instructed her, remembering, fortunately, thanks to that horrified exclamation of Ilona’s, the Christian name of my wretched victim: Fräulein Edith von Kekesfalva."
Tatsächlich: er ließ mich nicht lange warten. Nach fünf Minuten trat er bereits lachend herein.,"In fact, he didn't keep me waiting long.

"Unterdessen rührte sich leise die andere Tür. Ich hatte das Gefühl, jemand habe lauschend hinter ihr gestanden. Der alte Mann kam herein, und nicht wie gestern war mehr der Tod und das Grauen in seinen Augen, sondern ein zärtliches Strahlen. »Wie gut, daß Sie da sind. Sie werden staunen, wie sie verwandelt ist. Nie habe ich sie in all den Jahren seit dem Unglück so heiter, so glücklich gesehen. Es ist ein Wunder, ein wirkliches Wunder! O Gott, was haben Sie für sie, was haben Sie für uns getan!«","Meanwhile, the other door stirred softly. I had the feeling that someone had stood behind her, listening.

"Und plötzlich blieb er stehen. »Damit Sie es wissen, ein für allemal – gar nichts Wesentliches habe ich erzielt, nichts Definitives, und darauf kommt es doch an!

"Kanitz nahm das Blatt, dem eine ungarische Beilage angeheftet war.

"Es geschah folgendes: In jener halben Sekunde, da ich sicher, selbstbewußt, ja sogar freudig (jede Erledigung macht einen froh) das ziemlich umfängliche Kuvert in die Brusttasche schob, spürte ich dort von innen einen knisternden Widerstand.

What's in there, I thought involuntarily and reached into it. But my fingers were already twitching back, as if before I could even remember, they had understood what this forgotten thing was. It was Edith's letter, her two letters from yesterday, the first and the second.","This was the unexpected thing—in the split second as I put away the rather large envelope in my breast pocket with a sense of certainty, self-confidence, even happiness—you always feel glad when a task is completed—I felt something rustling in there already, leaving no room for my envelope. What’s in there? I wondered, instinctively feeling for it. But my fingers were already shrinking away, as if even before I myself remembered they knew what I had forgotten, what was already in my breast pocket. It was Edith’s letter, both her letters sent to me yesterday, the first and the second.","It was like this: during that half-second when, assured, self-confident, even happy (for every task accomplished makes one happy), I pushed the somewhat bulky envelope into my breastpocket, I became aware of a crackling resistance within. Whatever is this? I thought, feeling inside the pocket. But even as I did so my fingers shrank back as though they had realized before my brain what this forgotten packet was. It was Edith’s letter, her two letters, of yesterday."
"Ich erschrak. Ich spürte instinktiv die Gefahr. Wenn ich jetzt etwas versprach, war ich verpflichtet. Aber in diesem Augenblick fiel mir ein: es ist doch alles Täuschung, was sie erhofft. Sie wird doch auf keinen Fall sofort geheilt. Es kann noch Jahre dauern und Jahre; nicht zu weit denken, hat Condor gesagt, nur sie jetzt beruhigen, sie trösten! Warum ihr nicht etwas Hoffnung lassen, warum sie nicht glücklich machen, wenigstens für eine kurze Frist? Und so sagte ich:","I was startled. I instinctively sensed the danger. If I promised something now, I was obliged. But at that moment it occurred to me: it's all an illusion what she's hoping for. There's no way she'll be healed right away. It may go on for years and years; Don't think too far, Condor said, just calm her down now, comfort her! Why not give her some hope, why not make her happy, at least for a short while? And so I said:","I took fright. I instinctively sensed the danger. If I promised anything now, then I was pledged to keep my promise. But at that moment it struck me that everything she hoped for was a delusion. She was not going to get better, or not at once, in any case. It could take years and years. We mustn’t think too far ahead, Condor had said, as I reminded myself, we must comfort her and keep her calm now! So why not leave her a little hope , why not make her happy, at least for a short time? And so I said, “Well, yes, when she is cured, then of course … then I would … then I would come to see you of my own accord.”","I was horrified. Instinctively I was aware of the danger that threatened me. Were I to promise anything now, I should have committed myself. But at that moment I remembered that all her hopes were illusory. She would not be cured as quickly as all that. It might take years and years. Don’t think too far ahead, Condor had said; the thing to do is to pacify her, console her, for the moment. Why not leave her a shred of hope , why not make her happy, if only for a brief spell? ‘Why, when she is cured,’ I said, ‘then I shall of course ... come and ask you ...’"
"»Verzeihung, Herr Doktor … alles, was Sie mir erzählten, war natürlich furchtbar interessant für mich …, ich meine furchtbar wichtig … Aber Sie werden verstehen, daß ich Sie gerade darum noch etwas fragen möchte … etwas, das mich schon lange bedrückt und … Sie sind doch ihr Arzt, Sie kennen wie kein anderer den Fall … ich bin ein Laie, mir fehlt jede richtige Vorstellung … und da wüßte ich gerne, was Sie eigentlich davon denken.

I’m a layman, and can’t have any real idea ... and I should very much like to know what you really think about it. I mean, is this paralysis of Edith’s a passing illness, or is she incurable?’"
"»Nein«, erwiderte ich energisch und spürte, daß ich begann, zornig zu werden (es ist kein angenehmes Gefühl, sich als »merkwürdig« und »sonderbar« bewerten zu lassen). »Bedaure – ich habe mir von niemandem etwas zutragen lassen. Ich habe mit keinem einzigen meiner Kameraden je über Herrn von Kekesfalva gesprochen.«","""No,"" I said firmly, feeling myself beginning to get angry (it's not a pleasant feeling to be judged as ""strange"" and ""strange""). 'Sorry - I didn't let anyone tell me anything. I have never spoken to any of my comrades about Lord von Kekesfalva.'","“No,” I said firmly, feeling anger rise in me (it is not pleasant to be described as an oddity and very strange). “I’m sorry, but I have heard no such imputation. I have never discussed Herr von Kekesfalva with any of my comrades.”","‘No,’ I said vehemently, realizing that I was beginning to get angry ( it’s not pleasant to be labelled as ‘curious’ and ‘odd’). ‘I’m sorry — nothing has ever been passed on to me. I have never discussed Herr von Kekesfalva with any of my friends.’"
"»Nicht ihn jetzt aufhalten«, flüstert sie. »Nicht ihm was sagen! Er ist gewiß müde, den ganzen Tag war er unterwegs … Bitte haben Sie Rücksicht! Haben Sie doch Mitl …«","""Don't stop him now,"" she whispers. 'Don't tell him anything! He must be tired, he's been out all day... Please be careful!

"Wir verließen das Lokal. Der Wagen stand vor dem Hause für ihn bereit. Im letzten Augenblick, da Condor schon eingestiegen war, zuckte mir noch die Lippe, als wollte sie ihn zurückrufen. Aber schon zogen die Pferde an. Der Wagen und damit das Unabänderliche waren in vollem Gang.","We left the restaurant. The car was waiting for him in front of the house. At the last moment, when Condor had already boarded, my lip twitched as if to call him back. But the horses were already moving. The car and with it the unchangeable were in full swing.","We left the inn. His carriage was standing ready for him outside. When he had climbed up, my lip trembled for a moment as if to call him back. But the horses were already setting off. The carriage, and with it something that could not be changed now, was set in motion.","We left the wine-bar. The carriage was waiting for Condor at the door. At the last moment, when he had taken his seat, my lips moved involuntarily as though to call him back. But the horses had already moved off. And with the departure of the carriage the die was cast."
"Diese böse Bemerkung wurmte den Rittmeister über alle Maßen. Noch während des Heimritts und dann bei Tisch explizierte er immer von neuem, welches Unrecht man ihm angetan. Das Roß habe eben zu viel Saft in sich; man werde erst sehen, was der Fuchs für famose Figur machen würde, wenn man ihm einmal die Mucken gründlich ausgetrieben hätte. Aber je mehr der Enragierte sich erregte, um so mehr stichelten ihn die Kameraden. Er habe sich anschmieren lassen, frozzelten sie ihn und machten ihn redlich fuchtig. Immer heftiger wurde die Debatte. Während dieser stürmischen Diskussion nähert sich mir von rückwärts eine Ordonnanz: »Zum Telephon bitte, Herr Leutnant.«","This nasty remark rankled the Rittmeister beyond measure. While we were still riding home, and then at the table, he kept explaining the injustice done to him. The horse just has too much juice in it; one would only see what a splendid figure the fox would cut once one had thoroughly exorcised his mosquitoes. But the more the enraged man got excited, the more his comrades teased him. He let himself be smeared, they teased him and really pissed him off. The debate became increasingly fierce. During this stormy discussion, an orderly approaches me from behind: ""On the phone, please, lieutenant.""","Steinhübel greatly resented these slurs on his horsemanship. Even riding back to barracks, and then as we ate lunch, he kept explaining again and again how unjust the Colonel had been. His new mount was too high-spirited, that was all; we’d see what a fine horse the chestnut was once he, Steinhübel, had finished breaking him in. But the more the irate Steinhübel worked himself into a fury, the more our comrades teased him. He’d let himself be conned into buying that horse, they joked, which infuriated him more than ever. The debate waxed ever more vehement. During this stormy discussion, one of the orderlies comes up behind me. “Someone on the telephone for you, Lieutenant Hofmiller, sir.”","This caustic remark infuriated the Captain beyond measure. All the way home and later at mess he kept on complaining of how unjustly he had been treated. It was merely that the beast was mettlesome; we should see what a fine figure the chestnut would cut once he’d been thoroughly broken in. But the more he got worked up, the more his friends chaffed him. He’d been sold a pup, they jeered, and this made him absolutely wild. The argument became more and more heated. During this stormy scene an orderly spoke to me over my shoulder. ‘You’re wanted on the telephone, Herr Leutnant.’"
"»Ja … aber man kann … man kann doch nicht einen Menschen in seiner Verzweiflung einfach stehenlassen … schließlich war nichts dabei, wenn ich versuchte …«","""Yes ... but you can ... you can't just leave a person in his desperation ... after all, there was nothing wrong with trying ...""","“Yes … but one can’t … one can’t simply leave another human being in despair … after all, there was nothing wrong with my trying to—”","‘Yes ... but one can’t ... one just can’t abandon a person to despair ... after all, there was no harm in my trying ...’"
"»Natürlich«, murmelte sie merkwürdig fahrig. »Natürlich … übrigens … warum sind Sie denn heute nachmittag nicht gekommen?«","""Of course,"" she murmured, oddly nervous. ""Of course... by the way... why didn't you come this afternoon?""","“Of course,” she murmurs in curious agitation. “Of course … and by the way … why didn’t you come to see us this afternoon?”","‘Well, of course,’ she murmured with remarkable testiness. ‘Of course ... and by the way ... why didn’t you come this afternoon?’"
"Aber ich hielt mir nicht Wort. Ich war zu ungeduldig. Mich bedrängte die Unruhe, meine Schuld endgültig beglichen zu wissen, möglichst bald fertig zu werden mit dem Unbehagen einer unsicheren Situation. Denn immer kribbelte mir noch die Angst in den Nerven, bei der Offiziersmesse, im Café oder sonstwo würde jemand von meinem Mißgeschick zu sprechen anfangen: »Na, wie war denn das da draußen bei den Kekesfalvas?« Dann wollte ich schon kühl und überlegen erwidern können: »Reizende Leute! Ich war gestern nachmittags wieder bei ihnen zum Tee«, damit jeder gleich sehen könne, daß ich dort nicht etwa mit Stunk abgeglitten war. Nur einmal Strich und Punkt unter die leidige Affäre gesetzt haben! Nur einmal damit fertig sein! Und diese innere Nervosität bewirkt auch schließlich, daß schon am nächsten Tag, am Freitag also, während ich gerade mit Ferencz und Jozsi, meinen besten Kameraden, über den Korso schlendere, mich der Entschluß plötzlich überfällt: noch heute machst du den Besuch! Und ganz unvermittelt verabschiede ich mich von meinen etwas verwunderten Freunden.","But I didn't keep my word. I was too impatient. I was troubled by the uneasiness of knowing that my debt was finally settled, of being able to deal with the uneasiness of an uncertain situation as soon as possible. My nerves were always tingling with fear that at the officers' mess, in the café or somewhere else someone would start talking about my misfortune: ""Well, how was it out there at the Kekesfalvas?"" Then I was about to reply coolly and deliberately can: ""Lovely people! I went to their place for tea yesterday afternoon,' so that everyone could see right away that I hadn't slipped there with a stink. Only put a line and a dot under the tiresome affair! Only be done with it once! And this inner nervousness finally has the effect that the very next day, on Friday, while I am strolling down the parade with Ferencz and Jozsi, my best comrades, I suddenly make the decision: you're going to pay us a visit today! And quite suddenly I say goodbye to my somewhat surprised friends.","But I do not stick to my decision. I am too impatient. Under pressure from my own uneasiness, I want to know that I have atoned for my offence, I want to be rid of the discomfort of uncertainty as soon as possible. I am still under the nervous strain of fearing that someone in the officers’ mess, the café or some other place will start talking about my faux pas. “Now, do tell us about that evening in the Kekesfalvas’ house!” To which I can then reply coolly and with supercilious ease, “Delightful people! I was there again yesterday, taking tea.” Then, I think, everyone will see that I’ve had no trouble in making amends. Oh, to draw a line under the whole wretched affair, to get it over and done with! And in my nervous state I suddenly decide the very next day, Friday, while I am strolling on the promenade with my best friends Ferencz and Joszi, to pay my call at once. I abruptly take my leave of my slightly startled comrades.","But I did not keep my word. I was too impatient. I was haunted by the desire to know that my guilt was once and for all wiped out, to put as speedy an end as possible to the disquietude aroused in me by the uncertainty of the situation. I was still racked by the fear lest in the officers’ mess, at the café, or elsewhere, someone would broach the subject of my mishap, ‘Well, and how did things go off at the Kekesfalvas’?’ I wanted to be able to retort in calm superior tones, ‘Charming people! I had tea with them again yesterday,’ so that everyone might see at once that I wasn’t in bad odour. Oh, to be able to write off the whole wretched affair! Oh, to be done with it! And the result of this state of mental agitation, moreover, was that on the very next day, that is, the Friday, while I was strolling along the promenade with Ferencz and Jozsi, my best friends, I suddenly found myself resolving that I would pay my visit that very day. I curtly took leave of my somewhat astonished friends."
"Die Gelähmte war unterdes elend in sich zusammengestürzt, wehrlos lag sie am Boden, ein zuckendes Bündel Zorn, aufschluchzend vor Erbitterung und Scham. Ich versuchte den leichten Körper aufzuheben, aber sie wehrte sich und heulte mir entgegen:","Meanwhile, the paralytic had collapsed miserably, lying helpless on the ground, a twitching bundle of anger, sobbing with exasperation and shame. I tried to pick up the light body, but she fought back and howled at me:","Meanwhile the crippled girl lay where she had fallen in a miserable little heap on the ground, helpless, shaking convulsively in her anger and sobbing with bitterness and shame. I tried to raise her light body, but she resisted, and shouted at me, “Go away … away … away, you horrible, beastly man!”","Meanwhile, Edith lay huddled in a pitiful, defenceless heap on the ground, a quivering bundle of fury, sobbing for very anger and shame. I tried to lift the frail body, but she beat me off."
"Ich überlege rasch. Um Gottes willen, hat sie etwas bemerkt? Habe ich mich verraten? Hat Condor eine Unvorsichtigkeit begangen? Konnte sie aus einer achtlosen Bemerkung Verdacht schöpfen, daß mit dieser Schweizer Kur nicht alles stimmt? Hat ihre Hellsichtigkeit, ihre furchtbar mißtrauische Hellsichtigkeit am Ende durchschaut, daß wir sie eigentlich zwecklos wegschicken? Vorsichtig taste ich mich heran.","I think quickly. For God's sake, did she notice anything? Have I betrayed myself? Has Condor committed a carelessness? Could she have suspected from a careless remark that everything is not right with this Swiss cure? Did her clairvoyance, her terribly mistrustful clairvoyance, finally see through that we are actually sending her away for no purpose? I approach carefully.","I think quickly. For God’s sake, did she notice something? Have I given myself away? Has Condor done something incautious? Can she have deduced, from some careless remark, that this new Swiss course of treatment is not all she expects? Has her quick perception, her terribly distrustful perception, shown her that we are really sending her away to no good purpose? I approach the subject cautiously.","I quickly reflected. Good heavens, had she noticed anything? Had I given myself away? Had Condor been imprudent? Could some heedless remark have made her suspect that there was something fishy about this new treatment in Switzerland? Had she with her intuition, her terribly acute intuition, realized that we were sending her away to no purpose? ‘I can’t understand that,’ I said guardedly. ‘Your daughter until now has had such absolute confidence in Dr Condor, and if he has recommended this new treatment so emphatically ..."
"All das jagte jetzt mit hundert Bildern in mich hinein, während ich, wie von einer Explosion hingeschlagen, in dem dunklen Gang an der Wand lehnte, den Atem ausgeschöpft und die Beine fast genau so lahm wie die ihren. Zweimal versuchte ich, mich weiterzutasten, erst das dritte Mal tappte ich hin bis an die Klinke. Hier geht es in den Salon, überlegte ich rasch, gleich links führt die Ausgangstür zur Halle, dort liegt mein Säbel und meine Kappe. Rasch also das Zimmer durch und fort, nur fort, ehe der Diener kommt. Gleich die Treppe hinab und fort, fort, fort! Sich retten aus dem Haus, bevor man jemandem begegnet, dem man Rede und Antwort stehen muß. Nur fort jetzt, nicht dem Vater in den Weg kommen, nicht Ilona, nicht Josef, keinem von allen, die mich narrenhaft weiterrennen ließen in diese Verstrickung! Fort, nur rasch fort!","All of this rushed through my mind with a hundred images as I leaned against the wall in the dark corridor, as if struck by an explosion, my breath caught and my legs almost as lame as hers. Twice I tried to grope my way, only the third time did I grope my way to the handle. This is the way to the salon, I thought quickly, to the left the exit door leads to the hall, there are my saber and my cap. So quickly through the room and away, only away before the servant comes. Immediately down the stairs and away, away, away! Get out of the house before you meet someone you have to answer for. Get away now, don't get in my father's way, not Ilona, not Josef, none of the others who let me keep running foolishly into this entanglement! Away, quickly away!","The realisation of all this now flooded into me, illustrated by a hundred images, while I leant against the wall in the dark corridor, breathless and with my legs feeling almost as weak as hers. I twice tried to stagger further, and only at the third attempt did I get as far as the door leading out of the corridor. From here, I thought quickly, I can get into the salon, and then through the door on the left of it into the hall, where I could pick up my sword and cap. So I must get across the salon and then leave, get away from here before the manservant appears. Down the steps and away, well away! Escape from this house before anyone sees me, I thought, and subjects me to an interrogation. I must get out of here without seeing her father, or Ilona, or Josef—they all of them left me, like a fool, to entangle myself further and further in this web! I must get away!","A hundred and one scenes and pictures chased through my mind whilst, as though struck down by an explosion, I leaned against the wall, the breath knocked out of me and my legs almost as impotent as hers. Twice I tried to grope my way onwards, but only at the third attempt did I succeed in grasping the door-handle. This leads to the salon, I thought to myself quickly; to the left is the door into the hall, where I left my sword and cap. Quickly then, across the room and away, away before Josef comes! Straight down the stairs and away, away! Get out of the house before meeting anyone to whom you will have to give an account of yourself. You must get away, avoid running into the old man, or Ilona, or Josef, or any of those who have let you foolishly run your head into this noose. Away, you must get away!"

"In diesem Moment bemerkte ich auch, daß die Blinde völlig reglos neben mir gestanden hatte. Wieder kam über mich das Gefühl, das unsinnige, sie hätte jedes Wort des Briefes gelesen und sie wisse alles von mir.","At that moment I also noticed that the blind woman had been standing completely motionless next to me. Again I got the feeling, the nonsensical one, that she had read every word of the letter and that she knew everything about me.","At that moment I also noticed that the blind woman was still standing beside me, never moving. Once again I was overcome by the ridiculous notion that she had read every word of the letter and knew all about.","Not until this moment did I realize that the blind woman had been standing motionless at my side. A feeling, an absurd feeling, came over me that she had read every word of my letter and knew everything about me."
"Das dauert beinahe bis Mitternacht; nicht ein einzigesmal kommt unser Plaudern ins Stocken. Noch einmal wird etwas Gutes serviert, wunderbare Sandwiches, und merkwürdigerweise bin ich es nicht allein, der fest zugreift. Auch die beiden Mädchen packen kräftig ein, auch sie trinken ausgiebigst von dem schönen, schweren, schwarzen, alten englischen Port. Aber schließlich muß doch Abschied genommen werden. Wie einem alten Freunde, einem lieben, verläßlichen Kameraden, schütteln Edith und Ilona mir die Hand. Selbstverständlich muß ich ihnen versprechen, bald zu kommen, morgen schon oder übermorgen. Und dann gehe ich mit den drei andern Herren hinaus in die Halle. Das Auto soll uns nach Hause bringen. Ich hole mir selbst meinen Rock, indes der Diener beschäftigt ist, dem Oberstleutnant behilflich zu sein. Plötzlich spüre ich, wie mir jemand beim Umschwingen des Rocks helfen will: es ist Herr von Kekesfalva, und während ich ganz erschrocken abwehre (wie kann ich mich von ihm bedienen lassen, ich grüner Junge von dem alten Herrn?), drängt er flüsternd heran.","This lasts almost until midnight; not once does our chatting come to a halt. Once again something good is being served, wonderful sandwiches, and oddly enough I'm not the only one grabbing it. The two girls pack their bags, too, and they too drink copiously from the beautiful, heavy, black, old English port. But in the end you have to say goodbye. Like an old friend, a dear, reliable comrade, Edith and Ilona shake my hand. Of course I have to promise them that I'll come soon, tomorrow or the day after. And then I go out into the hall with the three other gentlemen. The car is supposed to take us home. I fetch my coat myself while the servant is busy helping the lieutenant colonel. Suddenly I feel someone wanting to help me swing my coat: it is Herr von Kekesfalva, and while I shrug it off in shock (how can I let him serve me, I green boy from the old gentleman?), he whispers to me .","This goes on almost until midnight, and not once does our cheerful conversation flag. Once again we are served something delicious to eat—excellent sandwiches—and surprisingly, I am not the only one to fall upon them. The two girls help themselves as well, and they too are drinking a good deal of the fine, heavy, dark old English port. But finally we have to wish one another goodnight. Edith and Ilona shake hands with me as they would with an old friend, a dear, reliable comrade. Of course I have to promise them to come again soon, perhaps tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Then I go out into the hall with the three other gentlemen. The car is to take us home. I fetch my own coat while the manservant is busy helping the Lieutenant Colonel into his. Then, as I fling the coat on, I suddenly feel someone trying to help me; it is Herr von Kekesfalva, and while I resist, horrified —how can I let him play the part of a servant, an old gentleman helping a callow lad like me?—he comes close to me, speaking in a whisper.","And so it went on, with never a pause in our chatter, until nearly midnight, when further delectable refreshments were served, drinks and heavenly sandwiches. And, strange to say, I was not the only one who fell to with a will. The two girls also helped themselves liberally, they too drank freely of the lovely, heavy, dark, old English port. But at last the time came to say farewell. Edith and Ilona shook me by the hand as though I were an old friend, a dear, trusted comrade. Of course I had to promise them to come again soon, the next day or the day after. We were all to be taken home in the car, and I went out into the hall with the three men. The butler was helping the Lieutenant-Colonel on with his things, and I was getting my own coat, when suddenly I felt someone trying to assist me into it. It was Herr von Kekesfalva, and in my bewilderment (for how could I, a mere youngster, let myself be waited on by the old gentleman!), I mutely protested. ‘"
"Ilona seufzte. »O Gott – und sie meinte immer, Sie kämen nur ihretwegen … Sie kämen deshalb zu uns. Ich … ich habe es ja nie geglaubt, weil Sie so … so unbefangen waren und so … so herzlich auf eine andere Art. Ich habe vom ersten Moment an gefürchtet, daß es bei Ihnen nur Mitleid ist. Aber wie konnte ich das arme Kind warnen, wie so grausam sein, ihr einen Wahn auszureden, der sie glücklich machte … Seit Wochen lebt sie einzig in dem Gedanken, daß Sie … Und wenn sie mich dann immer fragte und fragte, ob ich glaubte, daß Sie sie wirklich gerne hätten, da konnte ich doch nicht roh sein … Ich mußte sie doch beruhigen und bestärken.«","Ilona sighed. 'Oh God - and she always thought you came for her... That's why you came to us. I ... I never believed it, because you were so ... so uninhibited and so ... so warm in a different way.

For weeks she has been living with the only thought that you ... And when she kept asking me and asking if I believed I couldn't be rude about you really wanting her... I had to calm her down and encourage her.""","Ilona sighed. “Oh God—and she always thought you kept coming here for her sake … she thought that was why you visited us. I … I never believed that, because you were so … so unselfconscious, and so full of a different kind of warm feeling. I was afraid from the first that you were only sorry for her. But how could I warn the poor child, how could I be cruel enough to talk her out of a delusion that made her happy? For weeks she’s been living only for the idea that you … And then, when she kept asking me and asking me whether I thought that you really liked her, I couldn’t be unkind … I had to soothe her and make her feel better.”","Ilona sighed. ‘ Oh my God!

I never believed it, because you ... you were so much at your ease ... and so friendly in quite a different way. From the very first I was afraid that you felt no more than pity.

"Balinkay? Balinkay? In meinem Kopf torkelte alles noch wirr durcheinander, wie aus verstaubtem Gerümpel mußte ich diesen Namen mir mühsam herausholen. Ach ja, der Balinkay – der war doch einmal das mauvais sujet des Regiments gewesen. Noch lang vor meiner Garnisonszeit hatte er hier als Leutnant und dann als Oberleutnant gedient, der beste Reiter, der tollste Bursche des Regiments, ein wilder Spieler und Ladykiller. Aber irgend etwas Peinliches war dann passiert, ich hatte mich nie danach erkundigt; jedenfalls, in vierundzwanzig Stunden hatte er die Uniform an den Nagel gehängt und war dann kreuz und quer in der Welt herumgeschwommen, man munkelte davon allerhand sonderbare Geschichten. Schließlich hatte er sich wieder zusammengerissen dadurch, daß er sich im Shepherds Hotel in Kairo eine reiche Holländerin angelte, eine Witwe mit schweren Millionen, Besitzerin irgendeiner Maatschappij mit siebzehn Schiffen und ausgiebigen Plantagen in Java und Borneo drüben: seitdem war er unser unsichtbarer Schutzpatron.","Balinkay? Balinkay? Everything was still reeling in my head, I had to struggle to get this name out of dusty junk. Ah yes, the Balinkay - that had once been the mauvais sujet of the regiment. Long before my garrison days he had served here as a lieutenant and then a first lieutenant, the best horseman, the wildest lad in the regiment, a wild gambler and lady-killer. But then something embarrassing happened, I never asked about it; anyway, in twenty-four hours he hung up his uniform and then swam all over the world, all sorts of strange stories being rumored about it. Eventually he pulled himself together by hooking up a rich Dutchwoman at Shepherd's Hotel in Cairo, a widow with heavy millions, owner of some seventeen-ship Maatschappij with extensive plantations over in Java and Borneo: he's been our invisible patron saint ever since.","Balinkay? Balinkay? All my thoughts were still in wild confusion, and I had to search my mind like a lumber room for some recollection of the name. Ah yes, it was that Balinkay—the man who’d once been the black sheep of the regiment. Long before I was posted to this garrison he had served here as second lieutenant and then first lieutenant. He had the reputation of being the best horseman and the most congenial companion in the regiment, and also a confirmed gambler and ladykiller. But something embarrassing had happened, I’d never asked exactly what. Anyway, within twenty-four hours he’d resigned his commission and gone off to travel the world. All kinds of strange stories went around about him. In the end he’d retrieved his fortunes by marrying a rich Dutchwoman he’d met at Shepheard’s Hotel in Cairo, a widow worth millions, owner of a shipping line with a fleet of seventeen vessels, as well as large plantations in Java and Borneo. Since then, though he was seldom seen, he’d been regarded as our regiment’s patron saint.","Balinkay? Balinkay? My head was still in a whirl and I had to drag the name out laboriously as though from a pile of dusty lumber. Oh yes, of course, Balinkay — at one time he had been the black sheep of the regiment. Long before my transfer to this garrison he had served here as second and then first lieutenant. He had been the best rider, the maddest fellow in the regiment, an incorrigible gambler and Don Juan. But then there had been some unpleasant incident , I had never inquired what it was. At any rate, within twenty-four hours he had taken off his uniform, and had gone wandering about all over the world. All sorts of strange rumours of his doings had reached the regiment. At length he had got on his feet again by hooking a rich Dutch woman at the Excelsior Hotel in Cairo, a widow with pots of money, the owner of a shipping line with seventeen ships and vast plantations in Java and Borneo. Ever since then he had been our invisible benefactor and patron."
"»Verschieben?« Ich muß es ganz ängstlich gefragt haben, denn sie setzt hastig hinzu:","""Move it?"" I must have asked it, quite anxious, because she hastily adds:","“Put it off?” There must have been horror in my voice, because she quickly adds, “Yes … but we hope only for a few days.","‘Postpone it?’ I must have sounded very alarmed, for she added hastily:"
"In diesem Augenblick surrte leise etwas hinter uns. Es war der Lift, der herauffuhr; anscheinend hatte die Glocke im Niederkollern Lärm genug gemacht, um den immer bereiten Diener zu rufen. Eilends trat er, die erschrockenen Augen sofort diskret niederschlagend, heran, hob, ohne mich anzusehen, den zuckenden Körper – er mußte den Griff gewohnt sein – leicht auf und trug die Schluchzende hin zum Fahrstuhl. Eine Minute, und schon surrte der Lift leise wieder hinab; ich blieb allein zwischen dem umgestürzten Tisch, den zerschlagenen Tassen, den verstreuten Dingen, die so wirr durcheinanderlagen, als wäre ein Blitz mitten aus heiterm Himmel niedergefahren und hätte sie mit explosivem Einschlag nach allen Seiten versprengt.","At that moment something quietly whirred behind us. It was the elevator going up; apparently the bell had made enough noise in the rumblings to summon the ever-ready servant. He hurriedly approached, immediately and discreetly lowering his frightened eyes, lifted the twitching body - he must be used to the grip - without looking at me, and carried the sobbing woman to the elevator. A minute and the lift was whirring softly down again; I was left alone among the overturned table, the smashed cups, the scattered things that lay in such a jumble as if a bolt of lightning had fallen out of nowhere and blown them up in all directions with an explosive impact.","At that moment there was a faint humming sound behind us. It was the lift coming up. Evidently the clang of the falling bell had alerted the manservant who always waited ready down below. He hurried up in alarm, discreetly casting his eyes down at once, easily raised her twitching body without looking at me—he must be used to helping her up—and carried the sobbing girl over to the lift shaft. Next moment the lift was on its quiet way down again.","At that moment there was a faint whirring noise behind us; the lift was coming up. Probably the bell had made enough noise in falling to rouse Josef, who was always on the qui vive. Discreetly lowering his startled gaze he hurried up, and, without looking at me, gently lifted up the trembling, sobbing girl — he must have acquired the knack from long practice — and carried her to the lift. In another minute it was gently whirring its way down again, and I was left alone with the overturned table, the broken cups, the objects that lay scattered about in such confusion that one might have thought a thunderbolt had suddenly fallen out of a perfectly clear sky and sent them flying in all directions."

"Auf Stilreinheit war freilich der etwas eilige Architekt weniger bedacht gewesen als auf technische Bequemlichkeit; der nackte Kubus, welchen er dem schroffen, vierkantigen Turm aufgestülpt hatte, hätte mit seinen geometrisch geraden Formen viel eher in ein Hafendock oder zu einem Elektrizitätswerk als zu den behaglichen schnörkeligen Barockformen des wohl auf die Maria-Theresianische Zeit zurückreichenden Schlößchens gepaßt. Aber der wesentliche Wunsch des Vaters erwies sich als geglückt; Edith zeigte sich völlig begeistert von dieser Terrasse, die sie in unverhoffter Weise von der Enge und Einförmigkeit ihrer Krankenstube erlöste. Von diesem ihrem eigensten Aussichtsturm aus konnte sie mit Ferngläsern die weite tellerflache Landschaft überschauen, alles was im Umkreis geschah, Saat und Mahd, Geschäft und Geselligkeit. Nach endloser Abgeschiedenheit wieder mit der Welt verbunden, blickte sie stundenlang von dieser Warte auf das muntere Spielzeug der Eisenbahn, die mit ihrem kleinen Rauchkringel die Landschaft durchquerte, kein Wagen auf der Chaussee entging ihrer müßigen Neugier, und wie ich später erfuhr, hatte sie auch viele unserer Ausritte, Übungen und Paraden mit ihrem Teleskop begleitet. Aus einer merkwürdigen Eifersucht heraus hielt sie aber diesen ihren abseitigen Ausflugsplatz vor allen Hausgästen als ihre Privatwelt verborgen; erst an der impulsiven Begeisterung des treuen Josef merkte ich, daß die Einladung, diese sonst unzugängliche Warte zu betreten, als eine besondere Auszeichnung gewertet werden sollte.","The architect, who was in a hurry, was less concerned with purity of style than with technical convenience; the bare cube that he had placed on top of the rugged, four-edged tower would, with its geometrically straight forms, have fitted much better into a harbor dock or an electric power station than into the cozy ornate baroque forms of the little castle, which probably dates back to the Maria Theresa period. But the father's main wish turned out to be successful; Edith was completely enthusiastic about this terrace, which unexpectedly relieved her of the narrowness and monotony of her sickroom. From this observation tower, her own, she could use binoculars to survey the wide, flat landscape, everything that was happening in the area, sowing and mowing, business and socializing. Reconnected with the world after endless seclusion, she gazed for hours from this vantage point at the lively toy train that crossed the landscape with its little ring of smoke, no car on the highway escaped her idle curiosity, and as I found out later, she had too accompanied many of our rides, exercises and parades with her telescope. Out of a strange jealousy, however, she kept this her secluded place of excursions hidden from all house guests as her private world; It was only from the impulsive enthusiasm of faithful Josef that I realized that the invitation to enter this otherwise inaccessible lookout point should be considered a special distinction.","It is true that the architect, working in some haste, had thought less of observing consistency of style than of technical convenience. With its geometrically straight lines, the uncompromising form that he had imposed on the precipitous old four-square tower was better suited to a dockyard or a power station than the pleasingly elaborate baroque structure of the rest of the little castle, which probably dated from the reign of Maria Theresia. However, it turned out to fulfil Herr von Kekesfalva ’s expectations; Edith was delighted by the terrace, which so unexpectedly freed her from the narrow, monotonous confinement of her sickroom. It was her own lookout post, and up there she could see, through a pair of binoculars, the wide, flat landscape and everything that went on around the house: seed time and hay-making, business and social occasions. Back in the world again after being shut away from it so long, she could spend hours on this vantage point, looking at the railway down below where trains merrily chugged across the landscape like toys, puffing out little curls of smoke. No vehicle coming up the avenue escaped her notice, and I learnt later that she had watched many of our regimental exercises on horseback and parades through a telescope. But out of a strange kind of jealousy she kept this remote terrace to herself, a private world where guests in the house were not allowed, and only the faithful Josef ’s spontaneous enthusiasm told me what a special distinction it was to be invited to this usually inaccessible stronghold.","The architect, it is true, who had had to carry out the work in a hurry, had paid less attention to purity of style than to technical convenience; the bare cubic structure which he had clapped on to the rugged square tower, would, with its straight, geometrical lines, have been more in keeping with a harbour or a power-station than with the comfortable florid Baroque curves of the little Schloss, which must surely have dated back to the time of Maria Theresa. But in essence it fulfilled Kekesfalva’s hopes. Edith, it transpired, was completely entranced by the terrace, which in such unhoped-for fashion delivered her from the confinement and monotony of her sick-room. From this, her very own, tower she could survey through her binoculars the vast expanse of flat countryside, watch all that went on in the neighbourhood, sowing and reaping, work and play. After her long period of seclusion she was once more linked with the world; she would gaze out hour after hour from her tower at the toy of a railway which, with its little wisps of smoke, wound its way through the countryside; no vehicle on the high-road escaped her idle curiosity, and, as I learned later on, she had followed many of our rides, manœuvres and parades with her telescope. Out of a curious feeling of jealousy, however, she kept this remote belvedere of hers, her private world, hidden from the eyes of all visitors to the house, and I realized from the impulsive enthusiasm of the faithful Josef that he considered the invitation to visit this usually inaccessible retreat a mark of special favour."
"Nun haben starke Glückszustände wie alles Rauschhafte zugleich etwas Betäubendes; immer läßt intensives Genießen des Augenblicks das Vergangene vergessen. So dachte ich, als ich nach den erfrischenden Stunden im Sattel nachmittags wieder den gewohnten Weg hinaus zum Schloß marschierte, nur mehr in verhangener Weise an jene nächtliche Begegnung; ich freute mich lediglich an meiner leidenschaftlichen Leichtigkeit des Herzens und auf die Freude der andern; wenn man glücklich ist, vermag man sich auch alle übrigen Menschen nur glücklich zu erdenken.","Strong states of happiness, like everything intoxicated, also have something numbing about them; intensive enjoyment of the moment always makes one forget the past. So, as I walked the usual way out to the castle in the afternoon after the refreshing hours in the saddle, I thought only dimly of that nocturnal encounter; I simply rejoiced in my passionate lightness of heart and in the joy of others; when one is happy, one can only imagine all other people to be happy.","A strong sense of physical wellbeing, like every intoxicant, has something about it that inhibits thought; intense enjoyment of the present moment makes you forget the past. So as I went my usual way to the castle after those refreshing hours in the saddle, I was thinking only vaguely of my nocturnal encounter with Kekesfalva; I was merely happy in my own lightness of heart and the joy of other people, because when you are happy you think of everyone else as happy too.","Now states of profound happiness, like all other forms of intoxication, are apt to befuddle the wits; intensive enjoyment of the present always makes one forget the past. And so when, after those refreshing hours spent in the saddle, I once more took the familiar road to Kekesfalva, it was only dimly that I remembered my nocturnal encounter. I revelled in my own blissful lightness of heart and the happiness of others, for when one is happy oneself, one can only picture the rest of the world as happy."
"Aber da fuhren ihre beiden Hände, die offenbar wartend auf der Decke gelegen, plötzlich empor. Wie Klammern umpreßten sie von beiden Seiten, ehe ich den Kopf wegwenden konnte, meine Schläfen und rissen mir den Mund von der Stirne nieder an ihre Lippen. So heiß, so saugend und gierig preßten sie sich an, daß die Zähne die Zähne berührten, und gleichzeitig wölbte und spannte sich drängend ihre Brust empor, um meinen herabgebeugten Körper zu berühren, zu spüren. Nie in meinem Leben hab ich mehr einen derart wilden, einen so verzweifelten, einen so durstigen Kuß empfangen wie von diesem verkrüppelten Kind.","But then her two hands, which were evidently lying waiting on the blanket, suddenly went up. They gripped my temples like clamps from both sides before I could turn my head away and tore my mouth down from my forehead to their lips. They pressed themselves so hot, so sucking and greedy that their teeth touched their teeth, and at the same time their chests arched and expanded urgently to touch, to feel, my bent body. Never in my life have I received such a wild, such a desperate, such a thirsty kiss as from this crippled child.","But then both her hands, lying obviously in readiness on the bedspread, suddenly came up. Before I could turn my head away they clasped my temples firmly, and carried my mouth down from her forehead to her lips. She pressed her own mouth to it, sucking at my lips with such greedy heat that our teeth touched, and her breasts rose and fell rapidly, urgently reaching up to my body as it bent over her. Never in my life had I received such a wild, fierce, desperately thirsty kiss as that crippled child gave me.","But her hands, which had evidently been lying in wait on the pillow, shot up, and before I could turn my head away, seized me by the temples in a vice-like grip, tore my mouth from her forehead and pulled it down to her lips, which she pressed so hotly and greedily to mine that teeth touched teeth, while her breast strained and arched and thrust upwards to touch, to feel my body as I leaned over her. Never in my life had I received such a wild, despairing, thirsty kiss as the one given me by this crippled girl."
"Innerhalb einer reitenden Kolonne existiert man nicht als eigene Person: im klappernden Schlag von hundert Hufen kann man weder klar denken noch träumen; eigentlich spürte ich in dem scharfen Traben nichts anderes, als daß unsere lockere Gruppe in den vollkommensten Sommertag hinaushottelte, den man sich erdenken konnte, der Himmel vom Regen bis auf das letzte Schleierchen und Wölkchen ausgewaschen, die Sonne stark und doch ohne Schwüle, jede Kontur der Landschaft scharf silhouettiert. Weit in die Ferne hinaus empfand man jedes Haus, jeden Baum, jedes Feld so wirklich und klar, als hielte man sie in der Hand; jeder Blumenstrauß an einem Fenster, jeder Rauchring am Dach schien in seinem Dasein durch die vehementen und glasklaren Farben bestärkt; kaum erkannte ich unsere langweilige Chaussee wieder, die wir doch Woche um Woche im gleichen Tempo zu gleichem Ziele durchtrabten, so viel grüner und reichlicher wölbte sie über unseren Häuptern ihr gleichsam frischgestrichenes laubiges Dach. Herrlich leicht und entschwert saß ich im Sattel, weg war alles Unruhige und Dumpfe und Problematische, das in den letzten Tagen und Wochen mir die Nerven bedrückt hatte; selten glaube ich besser meinen Dienst getan zu haben als an jenem strahlenden sommerlichen Vormittag. Alles ging leicht und selbstverständlich, alles glückte und beglückte mich, der Himmel und die Wiesen, die guten heißen Pferde, die gehorsam jedem Schenkeldruck und Zügeldruck folgten, und die eigene Stimme sogar, wenn ich Befehle erteilte.","Within a column of horses one does not exist as one's own person: in the clopping beat of a hundred hooves one can neither think clearly nor dream; actually I felt nothing in the sharp trotting but that our relaxed group was jogging out into the most perfect summer day imaginable, the sky washed out by the rain down to the last veil and little cloud, the sun strong and yet without sultriness, every contour sharply silhouetted in the landscape. Far away one felt every house, every tree, every field as real and clear as if you were holding them in your hand; every bouquet of flowers at a window, every smoke ring on the roof seemed to be confirmed in its existence by the vehement and crystal-clear colors; I scarcely recognized our boring road, which we trotted through week after week at the same pace to the same destination, when its leafy roof, as it were freshly painted, arched so much greener and richer over our heads. I sat wonderfully light and relieved in the saddle, everything restless, dull and problematic that had weighed on my nerves in the last few days and weeks was gone; I seldom believe I have done my duty better than on that radiant summer morning. Everything went easily and naturally, everything was successful and made me happy, the sky and the meadows, the good, hot horses that obediently followed every pressure on the thighs and reins, and even my own voice when I gave orders.","As part of a column of mounted men you don’t function like your normal self; you can neither think clearly nor daydream through the sound of a hundred hoof beats. We were riding at a brisk trot, and I felt nothing except that our group was on its way in loose formation out into the finest summer day you can imagine. The sky was washed clean of rain to the last little cloud and wisp of mist, the sun was strong, yet without any sultry heat, and all the contours of the landscape stood out clearly. Looking far into the distance, you saw every house, every tree, every field as real and clear as if you held it in your hand. The very existence of every bunch of flowers standing in a window, every curl of smoke rising from a roof, seemed to be heightened by the strong, clear, glassy colours; I hardly recognised the uninteresting road along which we trotted week after week at the same tempo to the same destination—its leafy canopy rising above our heads was so much richer and greener than usual. I felt wonderfully light and easy as I sat in the saddle, all the uncomfortable, dark, problematic notions that had been oppressing my nervous system for the last few days and weeks were gone. I seldom performed my military duties better than on that radiant summer morning. Everything went well and naturally, everything was as it should be and rejoiced my heart: the sky and the meadows, the pleasant warmth of the horses as they reacted obediently to every pressure of the rider’s thighs and every pull on the reins, even to my voice when I gave orders.","When riding along as part of a column of cavalry one does not exist as a separate entity; the clatter of hundreds of hoofs prevents one from either thinking clearly or day-dreaming, and as we trotted along briskly I was oblivious of all else but the fact that we were jogging along into the most perfect summer’s day imaginable. The rain had washed every trace of mist and cloud from the sky, the sun shone warm, and yet there was no sultriness in the air, every contour of the landscape stood out in sharp silhouette. In the far distance every house, every tree, every field was as real and palpable as if one held it in one’s hand; every bunch of flowers in a cottage window, every ring of smoke above a roof-top, seemed to be confirmed in its existence by the vivid and yet pure colours. I could scarcely recognize this tedious high-road along which we trotted week after week at the same pace towards the same objective, so much greener and more exuberant was the freshly painted leafy roof that arched above our heads. I felt marvellously buoyant and care-free as I rode along; gone was all the uneasiness, the despondency, the uncertainty that had so frayed my nerves in the last few days and weeks, and seldom do I remember having carried out my duties more efficiently than on that radiant summer morning. Everything went off like clockwork, everything smiled on me: the sky and the meadows, the steaming horses, which obediently responded to every pressure of the thigh and every tug of the reins, and even my own voice when I shouted words of command."

"»Übrigens, ich möchte nicht, daß Sie meinen, ich hätte innerlich den Fall ›aufgegeben‹, wie man bei uns so lieblich sagt. Im Gegenteil, gerade hier laß ich nicht von der Stange, und wenn’s noch ein Jahr dauern sollte oder fünf Jahre. Es trifft sich übrigens sonderbar – just an demselben Abend nach jenem Vortrag, von dem ich Ihnen sprach, fand ich in der Pariser medizinischen Zeitschrift die Therapie einer Lähmung beschrieben, einen ganz kuriosen Fall eines Vierzigjährigen, der zwei volle Jahre gelähmt zu Bett lag, kein Glied rühren konnte, und den Professor Viennot in vier Monaten so weit gebracht hat, daß er munter wieder fünf Stockwerke steigt. Denken Sie: in vier Monaten eine solche Heilung, in einem ganz ähnlichen Fall, wo ich hier fünf Jahre herummurkse – mich hat’s geradezu umgeschmissen, als ich das las! Natürlich war mir die Ätiologie des Falls und auch die Methode nicht ganz klar, Professor Viennot scheint da eine Reihe von Behandlungsarten merkwürdig gekoppelt zu haben, eine Sonnenbestrahlung in Cannes, eine Apparatur und eine gewisse Gymnastik; bei der knappen Krankengeschichte hab ich natürlich keine Vorstellung, ob und inwieweit etwas von seiner neuen Methode in unserem Fall praktikabel sein kann. Aber ich habe sofort an Professor Viennot persönlich geschrieben, um genauere Daten zu erbitten, und nur im Hinblick darauf Edith heute so umständlich mit einer neuerlichen Untersuchung gequält – man braucht doch Vergleichsmöglichkeiten. Sie sehen also, daß ich keineswegs die Flagge streiche und im Gegenteil nach jedem Strohhalm fasse. Vielleicht steckt wirklich eine Möglichkeit in dieser neuen Methode – ich sage vielleicht, ich sage nicht mehr, und habe überhaupt schon zuviel geschwätzt. Schluß jetzt mit meinem vermaledeiten Metier!«","'By the way, I don't want you to think I've 'given up' the case, as we love to say. On the contrary, this is where I won't let anything off the shelf, even if it takes another year or five. Incidentally, it is strange that on the same evening after the lecture I spoke to you about, I found a description in the Paris medical journal of the treatment of a paralysis, a very curious case of a forty-year-old who had been in bed paralyzed for two full years, no could move a limb, and in four months Professor Viennot has brought him so far that he cheerfully climbs five floors again. Just think: such a healing in four months, in a very similar case, where I've been messing around here for five years - I was literally knocked over when I read that! Of course, the etiology of the case and the method were not entirely clear to me. Professor Viennot seems to have combined a series of treatments in a strange way, sun exposure in Cannes, an apparatus and a certain gymnastics; Given the brief case history, I naturally have no idea whether and to what extent some of his new method can be practicable in our case. But I immediately wrote to Professor Viennot personally to ask for more precise data, and it was only with this in mind that I tormented Edith so laboriously with a new investigation today – after all, one needs opportunities for comparison. So you see that I am by no means crossing the flag and, on the contrary, grasping at straws. Perhaps there really is a possibility in this new method—I may say I'll say no more, and I've already babbled too much. Enough now with my damned profession!«","“I wouldn’t like you to think I’ve given her up, as we so delicately put it. Far from it, I am particularly determined to do all I can for her, even if takes another year, another five years. And odd coincidences do happen—on the very evening after the lecture I mentioned to you, I was reading a Parisian medical journal and found the account of a case of paralysis, a very curious case. A man of forty who had been bedridden for two whole years, unable to move any of his limbs, and in four months Professor Viennot’s therapy has got him to the point where he can happily climb five flights of stairs again. Think of it—a cure like that in four months, in a very similar case, whereas I’ve spent five years here getting nowhere. I was bowled over when I read that. Of course the aetiology of the case and the method of treatment weren’t quite clear to me. Professor Viennot seems to have combined a whole series of treatments in a curious way: irradiation with sunlight in Cannes, some kind of mechanical device and a certain set of gymnastic exercises. The brevity of the case history as reported gives me no idea, of course, of whether and how far any part of his method might be practicable in our case. But I wrote straight to Professor Viennot to find out more, and it was purely for that reason that I subjected Edith to such a thorough examination again today —you need the opportunity to draw comparisons. So you see that I’m not lowering the flag, not by any means. On the contrary, I’m grasping at any straw. Perhaps there may really be a chance in this new treatment —I say perhaps, I say no more, and anyway I’ve talked far too much already. So that’s enough of talking shop for me today!”","‘By the way — I don’t want you to think that in my own mind I have “given up the case”, as we doctors so charmingly put it. On the contrary, it’s just at this point that I refuse to give in, even if things continue as they are for another year, another five years. Curiously enough, moreover, it so happens that only yesterday, the day after that lecture I spoke of, I read in a Parisian medical review a description of the treatment of a case of paralysis, a very curious case of a fourteen-year-old boy who had been bedridden for two whole years, unable to move a limb; and Professor Viennot managed to effect such an improvement in his condition that in four months’ time he could climb five flights of stairs again with ease. Just imagine, he was able to effect a cure like that in four months in a case exactly similar to Edith’s, a case with which I have been fiddling about for five whole years! It positively knocked me flat to read about it. Of course the aetiology of the case and the methods employed are not quite clear to me; Professor Viennot seems in some strange way to have combined a number of methods — sun treatment at Cannes, some kind of apparatus, and a certain course of remedial exercises; from the brief case-history I can, of course, form no idea as to whether and how far any of his new methods would be practicable in our case. But I have written straight off to him to ask for more precise data, and it was with this in mind that I plagued poor Edith today with another thorough examination — one must, after all, have data in order to make comparisons. You see, therefore, that I am by no means lowering my flag, but, on the contrary, clutching at every straw. There may perhaps be some hope for us in this new treatment — I say perhaps, no more than that, and in any case I’ve been chattering far too much. That’s enough of my confounded “shop”!’"
"Ein Mann bornierten Blickfelds ist an und für sich schon überall schwer erträglich, wo ihm Macht gegeben ist, am fürchterlichsten aber beim Militär. Da Dienst bei der Truppe sich aus tausend überakkuraten, meist schon überalterten und petrifizierten Vorschriften zusammensetzt, die einzig ein enragierter Troupier auswendig kennt und nur ein Narr buchstabengetreu fordert, fühlte keiner in der Kaserne sich je vor diesem Fanatiker des heiligen Reglements sicher. Der Terror der Exaktheit saß in seiner feisten Gestalt zu Pferd, er thronte mit stecknadelscharfen Augen bei Tisch, er war der Schrecken der Kantinen und Kanzleien; ein kalter Wind von Angst stob überall seinem Kommen voraus, und wenn das Regiment ausgerückt stand zur Inspizierung und Bubencic auf seinem rostbraunen niedern Wallachen langsam heranritt, den Kopf ein wenig gesenkt wie ein Stier vor dem Stoß, erstarrte jede Bewegung in den Reihen, als ob gegenüber feindliche Artillerie aufgefahren wäre und schon abprotzte und zielte. Jeden Augenblick, wußte man, mußte der erste Einschlag kommen, unabwendbar, unaufhaltsam, und niemand konnte voraussagen, ob dieser erste Volltreffer nicht ihm galt. Eisstarr standen sogar die Pferde und zuckten mit keinem Ohr, keine Sporen klirrten, kein Atem ging. Und gemächlich, den Schrecken, der von ihm ausging, sichtlich genießend, ritt der Tyrann dann heran, einen nach dem andern aufspießend mit seinem akkuraten Blick, dem nichts entging. Er sah alles, dieser metallene Dienstblick, er ertappte die Kappe, die einen Fingerbreit zu nieder war, jeden schlecht geputzten Knopf; jeden Rostfleck am Säbel, jede Schlackspur am Pferd; und kaum daß er die kleinste Unvorschriftsmäßigkeit erspäht hatte, brach ein Gewitter oder vielmehr eine wahre Schlammflut von Flüchen nieder. Unter dem engen Uniformkragen schwoll der Adamsapfel apoplektisch wie eine plötzliche Geschwulst, die Stirn unter dem kurzgeschorenen Haar wurde blutrot, dicke Adern kletterten blau die Schläfen hinauf. Und dann fetzte er los mit seiner knorrig heiseren Stimme; ganze Dreckkübel goß er über das schuldig-unschuldige Opfer aus, und manchmal wurde die Ordinärheit seiner Ausdrücke derart peinlich, daß die Offiziere verärgert zu Boden blickten, weil sie sich für ihn vor der Mannschaft schämten.","A narrow-minded man is in and of itself difficult to bear anywhere where he is given power, but it is most dreadful in the military. Since service in the troops consists of a thousand overly accurate, mostly outdated and petrified regulations, which only an enraged troupier knows by heart and only a fool demands to the letter, no one in the barracks ever felt safe from this fanatic of the sacred regulations. The terror of precision sat in its stout form on horseback, it sat enthroned at the table with pin-sharp eyes, it was the terror of canteens and offices; A cold wind of fear blew everywhere ahead of his coming, and when the regiment stood out to inspect and Bubencic rode up slowly on his low, russet gelding, his head bowed a little like a bull before the thrust, every movement in the ranks froze as if enemy artillery would have risen up opposite and already disarmed and took aim. At any moment, one knew, the first impact would come, inevitable, unstoppable, and no one could predict whether this first direct hit would not be aimed at him. Even the horses stood frozen and didn't twitch an ear, no spurs jingled, not a breath. And leisurely, visibly enjoying the terror that emanated from him, the tyrant then rode up, impaling one after the other with his accurate gaze, which missed nothing. He saw everything, that metallic service look, he caught the cap that was a finger's breadth too low, every badly polished button; every spot of rust on the sabre, every trace of dross on the horse; and no sooner had he spotted the slightest irregularity than a thunderstorm, or rather a veritable mud-tide of curses, broke out. Under the tight uniform collar, the Adam's apple swelled apoplectically like a sudden swelling, the forehead under the close-cropped hair turned blood red, thick blue veins climbed up the temples. And then he burst out in his gnarly, hoarse voice; He threw buckets of dirt over the guilty-innocent victim, and sometimes the vulgarity of his expressions became so embarrassing that the officers looked down angrily because they were ashamed of him in front of the crew.","A man of limited vision is hard to tolerate when he has power at his disposal, and hardest of all to tolerate in the army. Since military service consists of a thousand meticulous precepts, most of them out of date and fossilised, rules that only a committed old soldier knows by heart and only a fool expects to be taken literally, no one in the barracks ever felt safe from an officer so fanatical in observing those sacred regulations. This stickler for exactitude was a sturdy figure on horseback, sat enthroned at table looking around with eyes sharp as needles, and terrorised the staff of the army canteens and offices. A cold wind of anxiety always preceded his advent, and when the regiment was drawn up for inspection and Bubencic slowly rode past on his thick-set chestnut gelding, his head slightly lowered like a bull about to charge, all movement in the ranks stopped dead, as if enemy artillery had come up and the guns were already unlimbering and taking aim. We all knew that the first inevitable salvo might be fired at any moment and could not be diverted, and no one could tell in advance if he might not be its target. Even the horses stood rooted to the spot and never twitched an ear, no one’s spurs clinked, we hardly dared to breathe. Then the tyrant, visibly relishing the terror that he spread among us, rode along the line at his leisure, subjecting man after man to close inspection. Nothing escaped his accurate and beady eye. His iron gaze saw everything, a cap worn very slightly too low, a poorly polished button, every speck of rust on a sword, any negligence in grooming a horse, and as soon as he spotted the slightest contravention of the rules a storm of abuse broke. His Adam’s apple bulged apoplectically like a tumour suddenly appearing beneath his tight uniform collar, his forehead beneath his cropped hair turned red, thick veins stood out on his temples. And then he let rip in his harsh voice, pouring buckets of filthy profanity down on the unwitting offender’s head. Sometimes the vulgarity of his language was so embarrassing that we officers looked at the ground, feeling ashamed of him in front of the men.","A man of limited vision is hard to bear with in any sphere in which he is invested with power, but in the army is intolerable. Since service in the army consists of the carrying out of a conglomeration of a thousand-and-one over-meticulous, for the most part outmoded and fossilized regulations, which only an out-and-out martinet knows by heart, and the literal carrying out of which only a fanatic demands, none of us ever felt safe from this worshipper of the sacrosanct army code. As he sat in the saddle his corpulent figure was the very embodiment of military precision, he presided at mess with eyes as sharp as needles, he was the terror of the canteens and the regimental offices. A cold wind of fear invariably heralded his coming, and when the regiment was drawn up for inspection and Bubencic came riding slowly along on his stocky chestnut gelding, his head lowered slightly like that of a charging bull, every movement was stilled in the ranks as though enemy artillery had been brought into action and were already unlimbering and taking aim. At any moment, we knew, the first shot would be fired, and no one could be sure that he himself would not be the target. Even the horses stood as though frozen to the spot; not an ear twitched, not a spur jingled, not a breath stirred. Obviously enjoying the terror that he struck into everyone’s heart, the tyrant would ride forward at a leisurely pace, spearing one after another of us, as it were, with his accurate eye, which let nothing escape it. It took in everything, that steely military eye, it spotted the cap that was pulled down a finger’s-breadth too low, detected the button that was badly polished, spied out the slightest speck of rust on a sword, or a badly groomed horse; and no sooner had the most trifling irregularity come to light than the culprit was for it. Beneath his close-fitting uniform the Colonel’s Adam’s-apple would swell up apoplectically like a tumour, the forehead under the closely cropped hair would turn the colour of beetroot, thick blue veins would stand out on his temples. And then, in his raucous, hoarse voice, he would burst out into a storm, or rather a muddy torrent, of abuse; floods of foul invective would be poured upon the head of the guiltily innocent victim, and sometimes the coarseness of the Colonel’s epithets was so embarrassing that we officers would gaze in discomfiture at the ground for very shame in the presence of the men."

"Aber streng, grau und abwehrend starrten ihre Pupillen mich an und gleichsam durch mich hindurch, als könnten sie die Gedanken hinter meiner Stirne erraten. Ich hatte ihr hellsichtiges Gefühl nicht zu täuschen vermocht.

"Aber – nicht wahr, ich erzähle Ihnen derlei das Lächerliche schon streifende Details keineswegs aus Klatschsucht.

Ich weiß, er macht es einem schwer mit seiner obstinaten Art, mit seiner egozentrischen Besessenheit, die so tut, als ob es in unserer Welt, die doch mit Unglück bis an den Rand beladen ist, nur sein, nur seines Kindes Unglück gäbe. Aber doch, gerade jetzt darf man ihn nicht im Stich lassen, da die rasende Hilflosigkeit ihn selber krank zu machen beginnt, und Sie tun wirklich – wirklich, lieber Herr Leutnant – ein gutes Werk, wenn Sie ein bißchen von Ihrer Jugend, Ihrer Vitalität, Ihrer Unbefangenheit in dies tragische Haus bringen.

"In Wirklichkeit ist es die Uhr, die ich nicht ansehen will, und ihr unerbittliches Vorrücken Minute um Minute. Ein kribbeliges Gefühl sitzt mir in den Nerven, immer wieder flattern mir die Gedanken weg, immer wieder bedrückt’s mich, ob ich nicht doch ans Telephon gehen und mich entschuldigen sollte. Zum erstenmal beginne ich zu ahnen, daß wirkliche Teilnahme sich nicht einschalten und abschalten läßt wie ein elektrischer Kontakt, und jedwedem, der teilnimmt an fremdem Schicksal, etwas genommen wird an Freiheit des eigenen.","In fact, it's the clock I don't want to look at, and its relentless advance minute by minute.

My nerves were on edge, my thoughts were straying, and I kept on worrying as to whether I ought not to go to the telephone and make my excuses.

"Aus dieser Bemerkung ersah ich zu meiner Freude (es macht immer eitel, ein Geheimnis nur zu zweit zu wissen), daß Kekesfalva sie nicht in unsere Vereinbarung eingeweiht hatte. Aber ich ließ mir nichts anmerken. Wir spielten Schach, um die Zeit zu vertreiben, und es dauerte noch eine gute Weile, ehe die ungeduldig erwarteten Schritte sich im Nebenzimmer hören ließen. Endlich traten Kekesfalva und Doktor Condor in lebhaftem Gespräch herein, und ich mußte hart an mich halten, eine gewisse Betroffenheit zu unterdrücken, denn mein erster Eindruck, als ich diesem Doktor Condor gegenüberstand, war der einer großen Enttäuschung. Immer arbeitet ja, wenn uns von einem Menschen, den wir noch nicht kennen, viel und Interessantes berichtet wird, unsere visuelle Phantasie sich im voraus ein Bild aus und verwendet dazu verschwenderisch ihr kostbarstes, ihr romantischestes Erinnerungsmaterial. Um mir einen genialen Arzt, als den Kekesfalva mir Condor doch geschildert hatte, vorzustellen, hatte ich mich an jene schematischen Merkmale gehalten, mit Hilfe derer der Durchschnittsregisseur und Theaterfriseur den Typus »Arzt« auf die Szene stellt: durchgeistigtes Antlitz, scharf und durchdringend das Auge, überlegen die Haltung, blitzend und geistreich das Wort – rettungslos fallen wir ja immer wieder dem Wahn anheim, die Natur zeichne besondere Menschen durch eine besondere Prägung schon für den ersten Blick aus. Einen peinlichen Magenstoß empfand ich darum, als ich mich unversehens vor einem untersetzten, dicklichen Herrn, kurzsichtig und glatzköpfig, den zerdrückten grauen Anzug mit Asche bestäubt, die Krawatte schlecht gebunden, zu verbeugen hatte; statt des vorgeträumten, scharf diagnostizierenden Blicks kam mir hinter einem billigen Stahlkneifer ein ganz lässiger und eher schläfriger entgegen. Noch ehe Kekesfalva mich vorgestellt hatte, reichte Condor mir eine kleine, feuchte Hand und wandte sich bereits wieder weg, um beim Rauchtisch eine Zigarette anzuzünden. Faul reckte er die Glieder.","From that remark I saw, to my delight (it's always vain to know a secret with just the two of you) that Kekesfalva hadn't let her in on our agreement. But I gave no sign. We played chess to pass the time, and it was a good while before the impatiently awaited footsteps could be heard in the next room. At last Kekesfalva and Doctor Condor entered, engaged in lively conversation, and I had to suppress a certain dismay, for my first impression, when I faced this Doctor Condor, was one of great disappointment. Whenever we are told a lot of interesting things about a person whom we do not yet know, our visual imagination works out a picture in advance and lavishly uses its most precious, its most romantic memory material. In order to imagine a doctor of genius, like the one Kekesfalva had described to me as Condor, I had stuck to those schematic characteristics with the help of which the average director and theater hairdresser puts the type of “doctor” on the scene: intellectual face, sharp and penetrating that Eyes, pondering the attitude, flashing and witty the word - we always fall hopelessly to the delusion that nature distinguishes special people with a special character even at first glance. I felt an embarrassing stomach ache when I unexpectedly had to bow to a squat, plump gentleman, short-sighted and bald, his crumpled gray suit dusted with ash, his tie badly tied; instead of the pre-dreamed, sharp diagnostic look, a very casual and rather sleepy one came towards me from behind a cheap pair of steel pince-nez. Even before Kekesfalva had introduced me, Condor held out a small, damp hand and was already turning away to light a cigarette at the smoking table. He lazily stretched his limbs.","This remark told me, to my delight (for sharing a secret with only one other person always flatters one’s vanity) that Kekesfalva had not said anything about our agreement to Ilona. However, I did not let my gratification show. We passed the time playing chess until, after quite a long time, I heard the footsteps I had been impatiently awaiting in the next room. At last Kekesfalva and Dr Condor came in. They were in the middle of animated conversation, and I had to exert great self-control not to show a certain consternation, for my first impression of this Dr Condor was a great disappointment. Whenever we meet someone after hearing many interesting things about him, the imagination goes to work conjuring up a visual image in advance, recklessly lavishing romantic notions culled from memory on the stranger. In imagining a brilliant doctor such as Kekesfalva had described, I had resorted to the usual physical features that an average theatrical director and make-up artiste would use to present such a physician on stage: an intellectual face, a sharp and penetrating eye, elegant bearing, sparkling and witty conversation—we always fall hopelessly prey to the delusion that nature endows the particularly gifted with a particularly striking appearance. I felt a painful jolt of surprise, then, when I found myself unexpectedly bowing to a stocky, rather stout gentleman, short-sighted and with a bald patch, wearing a crumpled grey suit dusted with cigarette ash and with his tie carelessly arranged. Instead of the keen diagnostic gaze I had expected, a casual and rather sleepy glance was turned on me from behind cheap, steel-rimmed pince-nez. Even before Kekesfalva had introduced me, Condor was offering me a small, moist hand, and then he turned straight to the table where all the equipment for smoking stood to light a cigarette. He stretched, almost lazily.","From this remark I realized to my delight (it always bolsters up one’s vanity to know oneself to be the only one to share a secret) that Kekesfalva had kept his word and not told her of our plan. I stayed, of course. We played chess to amuse ourselves, and it was some considerable time before the sound of the footsteps that I was so impatiently awaiting was audible in the adjoining room. At last Kekesfalva and Dr Condor entered, deep in conversation, and I had some difficulty in suppressing a certain dismay, for my first impression of Dr Condor, as I stood facing him, was profoundly disappointing. It is true that whenever we have been told a great many interesting things about a person whom we have not yet met, our visual fantasy conjures up a picture of him beforehand, dipping liberally into the storehouse of our most precious and most romantic memories. In order to picture to myself a talented doctor such as Kekesfalva had described to me, I had confined my imagination to those characteristics which the average producer and theatrical wig-maker exploit to present the typical stage doctor: a spiritualized countenance, a keen and penetrating eye, an impressive bearing, a scintillating wit — again and again we fall hopelessly into the foolish error of thinking that Nature sets a special stamp on outstanding individuals so that they may be recognized at a glance. My heart sank, therefore, when, to my surprise, I found myself bowing to a stocky, plump little man, short-sighted and bald, his crumpled grey suit smothered in cigarette-ash, his tie askew; when, instead of the keen glance of the diagnostician, I encountered a listless and almost sleepy gaze behind a pair of cheap steel pince-nez. Before Kekesfalva had time to introduce us, Condor offered me a small clammy hand and promptly turned away to help himself to a cigarette. He stretched lazily."

But then I get angry that the last word I heard in life should have been an insult; To my own surprise, something happens, completely unconsciously, just out of my body, so to speak - I take a few hasty steps and hurry after it. I know that what I did was actually completely absurd; why explain or correct something to some hardheaded person an hour before the very last one? But this absurd inconsistency is inherent in all suicides, that ten minutes before they become disfigured corpses, they give in to the vanity of absolutely leaving life clean (from the life that they alone will no longer live with), that they shave (for whom?) and put on clean linen (for whom?) before they put a bullet through their heads, yes, I even remember hearing about a woman who did her makeup and had her hair done by the hairdresser curled and perfumed with the dearest Coty before throwing herself down from the fourth floor. Only this logically completely inexplicable feeling tore my muscles, and if I now hurried after the colonel, it was by no means - I must emphasize it - out of fear of death or sudden cowardice, but solely out of the absurd instinct of cleanliness, not untidy, not soiled nothing to disappear","He turns away with a contemptuous expression on his face, and without another word he marches over to the stairs. His broad back is a heavy outline seen against the moonlight. Suddenly I am infuriated to think that the last words I hear in my life are to be his reproof. To my own surprise, I do something entirely instinctive, as if my body were acting of its own accord—with a few quick steps I hurry after him. I know that what I am doing is pointless—why spend my last hour on earth trying to explain or justify myself to a bone-headed old boy like the Colonel? But I suppose all would-be suicides are illogical enough to succumb to vanity only ten minutes before they plan to lie with their faces distorted in death. What they want is to set the record straight before they leave this life, although they will never know any more about it. A suicide will shave himself (for whose benefit?) and put on clean underclothes (again, for whose benefit?) before firing a bullet into his brain. I remember once hearing of a woman who made up her face, went to the hairdresser to have her hair waved, and applied the most expensive Coty perfume before throwing herself off the top of a four-storey building. Only this vanity, for which there is no logical explanation, got my muscles moving, and now, as I hastily followed the Colonel, I did so , I must emphasise, not in the fear of death or out of sudden cowardice, but because of an absurd instinct to wipe the slate clean rather than disappear into the void with my reputation smirched, leaving confusion behind.","He wheeled round with a look of contempt and stamped off towards the staircase without saying goodnight, his broad back massive in the moonlight. But I was seized with fury to think that the last word I was to hear in my life should be a reprimand, and to my own surprise, acting involuntarily, as though merely obeying the dictates of my own body , I took a few hasty steps and hurried after him. I knew that what I was doing was completely absurd. Why try, an hour before my last hour on earth, to explain things to this obstinate old buffer, to set things right? But it is an absurdly inconsequential characteristic of suicides that, ten minutes before they are to become mangled corpses, they yield to the vanity of trying to make as tidy an exit from life as possible (from that life of which they will no longer know anything); that they shave themselves and put on clean underlinen (for whom?) before putting a bullet through their heads: indeed, I even remember hearing of a woman who made up her face and had her hair waved and scented with the most expensive perfume before throwing herself from the fourth floor of a building. It was only this logically inexplicable impulse that urged my legs forward, and if I now ran after the Colonel, it was — I must emphasize — in no sense from fear of death or from sudden cowardice, but simply from an absurd instinct for tidiness, a desire not to vanish into nothingness leaving behind a lot of loose ends."
"Nun war sie es wiederum, die aufstutzte. Sie spürte in meinen Worten etwas Hintergründiges, das sie nicht begriff. Schärfer spannten sich die Brauen über den ungeduldigen Augen. Ich sah, ich mußte deutlicher werden.",Now it was she again who braced herself. She sensed something in the background in my words that she didn't understand. The brows tightened more sharply over the impatient eyes. I saw I had to be clearer.,"Now she was the one to be taken aback. She sensed some cryptic reference that she didn’t understand in my words. Her brows came down over her impatient eyes, her frown was deeper than ever. “So do see reason, my dear child … sorry, I mean let’s talk reasonably, Fräulein Edith.",And now it was her turn to look up in surprise. She sensed something behind my words which she did not understand. The brows above the impatient eyes were arched more tautly. I saw that I should have to speak even more plainly.
"Wunderbar bequem und behaglich fährt sich’s in dem lautlos gleitenden Wagen. Aber doch, wie wir jetzt – zauberhaft schnell ist das gegangen – auf die Kaserne zusteuern, klopfe ich gegen die Scheibe und ersuche den Chauffeur, er möge schon auf dem Rathausplatz anhalten. Denn lieber nicht in Kekesfalvas elegantem Coupé bei der Kaserne vorfahren! Ich weiß, es macht sich nicht gut, wenn ein kleiner Leutnant wie ein Erzherzog im fabelhaften Auto vorknattert und sich von einem livrierten Chauffeur heraushelfen läßt. Derlei Protzereien sehen bei uns die goldenen Krägen nicht gern, außerdem rät mir längst ein Instinkt, meine beiden Welten möglichst wenig zu vermengen, den Luxus des Draußen, wo ich ein freier Mann bin, unabhängig, verwöhnt, und die andere, die Dienstwelt, in der ich mich ducken muß, ein armer Schlucker, den es mächtig entlastet, wenn der Monat nur dreißig Tage hat statt einunddreißig. Unbewußt will mein eines Ich nicht gerne von dem anderen wissen; manchmal vermag ich schon nicht mehr zu unterscheiden, wer eigentlich der wirkliche Toni Hofmiller ist, der im Dienst oder der bei Kekesfalvas, der draußen oder der drinnen.","It's wonderfully comfortable and comfortable to drive in the silently gliding carriage. But still, as we head towards the barracks – it went magically quickly – I knock on the window and ask the driver to stop on the town hall square. Better not drive up to the barracks in Kekesfalva's elegant coupé! I know it doesn't do well when a little lieutenant rattles along like an archduke in a fabulous car and has a liveried chauffeur help him out. We don't like to see such ostentation on our golden collars, moreover, an instinct has long advised me to mix my two worlds as little as possible, the luxury of the outside, where I'm a free man, independent, spoiled, and the other, the world of service, in I have to hunker down, a poor fellow, who is greatly relieved when the month only has thirty days instead of thirty-one. Unconsciously, one of my egos does not want to know about the other; sometimes I can no longer distinguish who the real Toni Hofmiller is, the one on duty or the one with Kekesfalvas, the one outside or inside.","It is wonderfully comfortable and pleasant to be driven along in this car as it glides silently along the road. But now—the journey has been magically fast—as we are making for the barracks I tap on the pane between me and the chauffeur and ask him to stop in the square outside the town hall. I would rather not drive up to the barracks in Kekesfalva’s elegant vehicle! I know it doesn’t look good for an insignificant lieutenant to drive up in state like an archduke in a fabulous car, helped out by a liveried chauffeur. The top brass don’t like such ostentation, and in addition instinct has been advising me for some time to keep my two worlds as far apart as possible—the luxury of the Villa Kekesfalva, where I am a free man, independent and indulged, and my other world of military service, where I have to keep my head down, where I’m a poor devil who is greatly relieved when there are only thirty days in the month before my money runs out, not thirty-one. Unconsciously, I don’t want the others to know about my real life, and indeed I sometimes don’t know myself which is the real Toni Hofmiller, the one in barracks or the one at the Kekesfalvas’ castle, the Hofmiller out there or the Hofmiller stationed here.","It was wonderfully comfortable and luxurious, speeding along so noiselessly and smoothly in the car. Nevertheless, as we now turned off towards the barracks — we had reached the town in an incredibly short time — I knocked on the glass partition and begged the chauffeur to stop when he reached the Rathausplatz. Better not drive past the barracks in Kekesfalva’s elegant coupé , I thought. I knew it didn’t look well for a subaltern to come rolling up like a Grand Duke in a posh car and be assisted out of it by a chauffeur in livery. That kind of showing off was not regarded with favour by the bigwigs, and my own instinct, besides, had long told me to mix my two worlds as little as possible — the luxurious world of the Kekesfalvas where I was a free man, independent, pampered, and the other world, the world of duty, in which I had to keep my place, in which I was a poor devil who felt himself lucky if the month had thirty instead of thirty-one days. Without my knowing it, one side of me was reluctant to have anything to do with the other; sometimes I was no longer able to decide who was the real Toni Hofmiller, the one who was a mere subaltern or the one who spent his time at the Kekesfalvas’."
"»Ist draußen alles in Ordnung?« fragte Condor, mir scharf in die Augen blickend. Und irgendwie mußte er bemerkt haben, daß etwas nicht in Ordnung war, denn er fügte rasch hinzu: »Also hören Sie, lieber Freund, meine Frau weiß immer, wie’s mit mir steht, sie weiß es meist besser als ich selbst. Ich habe tatsächlich einen furchtbaren Hunger, und ehe ich nicht was gegessen und mir meine Zigarre verdient habe, bin ich zu nichts zu gebrauchen. Wenn’s dir recht ist, Klara, gehn wir zwei jetzt ruhig hinüber zum Essen und lassen den Herrn Leutnant ein bissel warten. Ich gebe ihm unterdessen ein Buch oder er ruht sich aus – Sie haben wohl auch einen ausgiebigen Tag hinter sich«, wandte er sich mir zu. »Wenn ich bei der Zigarre bin, komm ich zu Ihnen herüber, allerdings in Pantoffeln und Hausrock – nicht wahr, Herr Leutnant, Sie verlangen ja von mir keine große Toilette …«","""Is everything okay outside?"" asked Condor, looking me sharply in the eyes. And somehow he must have sensed something was wrong, for he quickly added, 'Now listen, dear friend, my wife always knows how things are with me, she usually knows better than I do. I do indeed I'm terribly hungry, and until I've eaten something and earned my cigar, I'm useless. If that's okay with you, Klara, the two of us can go over to dinner and let the lieutenant wait a bit. In the meantime, I'll give him a book or he'll rest - you must have had a long day, too,' he turned to me. ""When I'm at the cigar, I'll come over to you, albeit in slippers and a house coat - aren't you, lieutenant, you're not asking me to dress in a big dress...""","“Is everything all right there?” Condor asked, looking me keenly in the eye. Somehow or other he must have guessed that something was not all right, because he added quickly, “Listen, my dear friend, my wife always knows how I’m feeling better than I do myself, and it’s a fact that I’m very hungry. I doubt if I’ll be much use to anyone until I’ve had something to eat and smoked a cigar. So if it’s all right, Klara, you and I will go and have our supper quietly now, and ask the Lieutenant to wait just a little while. I’ll find him a book to pass the time, or he could rest— I think you must have had a very strenuous day,” he said, turning to me. “When I get to my cigar I’ll come back and join you, in my slippers and dressing gown if you have no objection.”","‘Is everything all right out there?’ asked Condor, gazing searchingly into my eyes. And he must somehow have realized that something was not quite right, for he quickly added: ‘Now listen, my friend, my wife always knows how things are with me, usually better than I do myself.

If you don’t mind, Klara, we two will go and have some supper and let the Herr Leutnant wait a little. I’ll give him a book to read or he can have a rest — you’ve probably had a heavy day,’ he said, turning to me. ‘When I’ve got to the cigar stage I’ll come back to you, in dressing-gown and slippers if you’ve no objection — you won’t expect me to dress formally, will you, Herr Leutnant?’"
"Unwillkürlich wich ich noch weiter zurück. In der einen Sekunde, da er das Wort »Mord« ausgesprochen, hatte ich alles in blitzhafter Vision gesehen: das Geländer der Turmterrasse und wie sie sich ankrampfte daran mit beiden Händen! Wie ich sie packen mußte und mit Gewalt zurückreißen im letzten Augenblick! Ich wußte, Condor übertrieb nicht; genau so würde sie es tun, dort hinunter sich werfen – ich sah die gequaderten Steine der Tiefe vor mir, alles sah ich in dieser Sekunde, als ob es eben geschähe, als ob es schon geschehen wäre, und ein Brausen dröhnte in meinen Ohren, als sauste ich selbst diese vier, diese fünf Stockwerke hinab.","Involuntarily, I backed away even further. The one second he uttered the word ""murder,"" I had seen everything in a flash of vision: the railing of the tower terrace and how she was clenching it with both hands!

The moment he spoke the word “murder”, I had seen it all in a flash, as if in a vision—the balustrade of the terrace on top of the tower, and how she had clutched it with both hands!

She would do exactly that, throw herself over—in my mind ’s I saw the paving stones far below, I saw everything at that moment as if it were just happening, as if it had already happened, and there was a roaring in my ears as if I myself were plunging down those four or five storeys to the bottom of the tower.","Involuntarily I retreated still further.

"Der Oberst mußte meine Schritte gehört haben. Denn brüsk wandte er sich um, verdutzt starrten die kleinen stechenden Augen unter den buschigen Brauen mich an. Offenbar konnte er die ungeheuerliche Ungehörigkeit gar nicht fassen, daß ein Subalternoffizier ihm ohne Erlaubnis nachzugehen wagte. Ich blieb zwei Schritte vor ihm stehen, fuhr mit der Hand an die Kappe und sagte, dem gefährlichen Blick ruhig standhaltend – meine Stimme muß bleich gewesen sein wie das Mondlicht:","The colonel must have heard my footsteps.

Fünf Minuten, dann tappen und tasten höhnische, mißbilligende, ironische Blicke von allen Seiten mich an, und morgen läuft, von hundert Lippen zerschmatzt, der Schwatz über meine rohe Ungeschicklichkeit durch die ganze Stadt, frühmorgens schon mit der Milch abgelagert an den Haustüren, dann breitgeschwenkt in den Gesindestuben und weitergetragen in die Kaffeehäuser, die Ämter. Morgen weiß man’s in meinem Regiment.","But already Ilona, with anger in her eyes, had freed her arm and was already running over.

Another five minutes, I think, and everyone will know about my folly. Five more minutes, and then scornful, disapproving, ironic glances will be cast at me from all sides, and tomorrow the story of my rough, clumsy behaviour, passed on by a hundred mouths, will be the talk of the whole town, delivered at back doors with the milk, retold in the servants’ quarters, reaching the cafés and offices.

"Aber noch ein anderes, viel Geheimnisvolleres hatte unbewußt Anteil daran, daß mich das tägliche Beisammensein mit den beiden Mädchen so sehr beschwingte. Seit meiner frühzeitigen Auslieferung an die Militäranstalt, seit zehn, seit fünfzehn Jahren also, lebte ich unausgesetzt in männlicher, in männischer Umgebung. Von morgens bis nachts, von nachts bis früh, im Schlafraum der Militärakademie, in den Zelten der Manöver, in den Stuben, bei Tisch und unterwegs, in der Reitschule und im Lehrzimmer, immer und immer atmete ich im Luftraum nur Dunst des Männlichen um mich, erst Knaben, dann erwachsene Burschen, aber immer Männer, Männer, schon gewöhnt an ihre energischen Gebärden, ihren festen, lauten Gang, ihre gutturalen Stimmen, ihren knastrigen Geruch, ihre Ungeniertheit und manchmal sogar Ordinärheit. Gewiß, ich hatte die meisten meiner Kameraden herzlich gern und durfte wahrhaftig nicht klagen, daß sie es nicht ebenso herzlich meinten. Aber eine letzte Beschwingtheit fehlte dieser Atmosphäre, sie enthielt gleichsam nicht genug Ozon, nicht genug spannende, prickelnde, elektrisierende Kräfte. Und wie unsere prächtige Militärkapelle trotz ihres vorbildlich rhythmischen Schwungs doch immer nur kalte Blechmusik blieb, also hart, körnig und einzig auf Takt eingestellt, weil ihr der zärtlich-sinnliche Streicherton der Violinen fehlte, so entbehrten sogar die famosesten Stunden unserer Kameraderie jenes sordinierenden Fluidums, das immer die Gegenwart oder auch nur Atemnähe von Frauen jeder Geselligkeit beimischt. Schon damals, als wir Vierzehnjährigen je zwei und zwei in unseren verschnürten kleidsamen Kadettenmonturen durch die Stadt promenierten, hatten wir, wenn wir andern jungen Burschen mit Mädchen flirtend oder nachlässig plaudernd begegneten, wirr sehnsüchtig empfunden, daß durch die seminaristische Einkasernierung etwas unserer Jugend gewalttätig entzogen wurde, was unseren Altersgenossen tagtäglich auf Straße, Korso, Eisbahn und im Tanzsaal ganz selbstverständlich zugeteilt war: der unbefangene Umgang mit jungen Mädchen, indessen wir, die Abgesonderten, die Eingegitterten, diesen kurzröckigen Elfen wie zauberischen Wesen nachstarrten, von einem einmaligen Gespräch mit einem Mädchen schon wie von einer Unerreichbarkeit träumend. Solche Entbehrung vergißt sich nicht. Daß späterhin rasche und meist billige Abenteuer mit allerhand gefälligen Weibspersonen sich einstellten, bot keinerlei Ersatz für diese sentimentalen Knabenträume, und ich spürte an der Ungelenkigkeit und Blödigkeit, mit der ich jedesmal (obwohl ich schon mit einem Dutzend Frauen geschlafen) in der Gesellschaft herumstotterte, sobald ich zufällig an ein junges Mädchen geriet, daß mir jene naive und natürliche Unbefangenheit durch allzulange Entbehrungen für allezeit versagt und verdorben war.","But something else, much more mysterious, also played an unconscious part in the fact that my daily get-together with the two girls exhilarated me so much. Ever since my early extradition to the military establishment, for ten, fifteen years, I have lived uninterruptedly in male surroundings. From morning to night, from night to morning, in the dormitories of the military academy, in the maneuvering tents, in the living rooms, at table and on the go, in the riding school and in the classroom, always and always I breathed only the haze of manhood around me in the airspace , first boys, then grown lads, but always men, men already used to their energetic gestures, their firm, loud gait, their guttural voices, their grating smell, their unabashedness and sometimes even vulgarity. Of course, I was very fond of most of my comrades and I really couldn't complain that they didn't mean it as much. But this atmosphere lacked a final exhilaration, it didn't contain enough ozone, so to speak, not enough exciting, tingling, electrifying forces. And just as our magnificent military band, despite its exemplary rhythmic verve, always remained just cold brass music, i.e. hard, grainy and only set to the beat because it lacked the tender, sensual string tone of the violins, so even the most splendid hours of our comradeship lacked that controlling fluidum, that always mixes the presence or even the closeness of women with every conviviality. Even back then, when we fourteen-year-olds strolled through the city two by two in our tied, attractive cadet uniforms, when we met other young boys flirting with girls or casually chatting, we had felt confusedly longing that something had been violently withdrawn from our youth by the seminary barracks what our contemporaries were allotted every day on the street, parade, ice rink and in the dance hall as a matter of course: the uninhibited dealings with young girls, while we, the segregated, the caged, stared at these short-skirted elves like magical beings, from a unique conversation with one Girls already dreaming of an unavailability. Such deprivation is not forgotten. The fact that later quick and mostly cheap adventures with all sorts of agreeable women set in offered no substitute for these sentimental boyish dreams, and I felt from the clumsiness and stupidity with which I always stuttered around in society (although I had already slept with a dozen women) as soon as I happened to meet a young girl, that naïve and natural impartiality was forever denied and spoiled by all too long privations.","But something else, something much more mysterious also contributed, unconsciously, to the fact that the time I spent daily with the two girls made me feel so elated. Ever since I had been sent off, a mere boy, to the military academy, and thus for the last ten or fifteen years, I had been living in an exclusively masculine environment. From morning to night, from night to first thing in the morning, in the dormitory at the military academy, in tents when we were on manoeuvres, in the officers’ mess, at table and on the road, in the riding school and the lecture hall, I had never breathed the odour of any but male companions, first boys, then adolescent lads, but always men—men accustomed to energetic gestures, their firm, loud footsteps, their deep voices, the aura of tobacco about them, their free and easy ways, sometimes verging on vulgarity. To be sure, I liked most of my comrades very much, and could hardly complain if they did not feel quite so warmly about me. But that atmosphere lacked something to lighten it, it did not contain enough ozone, enough exciting, intriguing, electrifying force. And just as our excellent military band, in spite of its rhythmical verve, played nothing but music for brass—hard, cold, down to earth, intent on nothing but keeping time, lacking the tender and sensuous tone of stringed instruments—so even our most cordial regimental occasions had none of that muted fluidity that the presence or even the mere proximity of women adds to any social gathering. Even at the time when we fourteen-year-olds paraded through the town two by two in our smart cadet uniforms, when we met other young lads flirting with girls, or talking to them easily, we had felt, with vague longing, that we were being forcibly deprived of something by spending our youth in barracks while we did our training, something that our contemporaries took for granted daily in the street, on the promenade or the skating rink, in the dance hall—they were entirely at their ease in the company of girls. Shut away behind bars as we were, we used to stare at those girls in their short skirts as if they were magical beings, and dreamt of a single conversation with a girl as something unattainable. One doesn’t forget such deprivation. Later adventures, fleeting and usually cheap, with all kinds of obliging females, were no substitute for these boyish dreams, and although I had now slept with a dozen women, the awkwardness and stupidity that afflicted me in company when I happened to meet a young girl made me feel that long deprivation had ruined me for natural, straightforward social intercourse, and it would be denied to me for ever.","But yet another, far more mysterious, factor was responsible for the fact that I found the daily company of the two girls so exhilarating. Ever since I had been sent, at an early age, to the military academy, that is to say, for the last ten or fifteen years, I had lived continuously in a masculine, a male environment. From morning till night, from night till morning, in the dormitory at the military academy, in camp, in barracks, in the mess and on the march, in the riding-school and in the class-room, always and always I had breathed an air that reeked of the male, first of boys, then of grown lads, but always of men, men; I had grown used to their virile gestures, their firm, noisy tread, their guttural voices, their tobacco-y smell, their free and easy ways and sometimes coarseness. To be sure, I was extremely fond of most of my fellow-officers, and could not really complain that my feelings were not reciprocated. But there was one exhilarating element that this male atmosphere lacked; it contained, as it were, insufficient ozone, insufficient power to rouse, invigorate, stimulate, quicken, electrify; and just as our excellent military band despite its exemplary rhythm and swing, nevertheless remained a brass band, its music therefore harsh, blaring, depending solely for its effect on rhythm, because it lacked the delicately sensuous tones of stringed instruments, so did even our jolliest times in barracks lack that element of subtlety which the presence or even the mere proximity of women invisibly adds to all social intercourse. Even when, as fourteen-year-old cadets, we had promenaded two by two through the town in our smart gold-laced uniforms and had come across other lads flirting or chatting idly with girls, we had felt regretfully that because of our monastic incarceration our young lives had been violently robbed of something that was every day permitted to our contemporaries as a matter of course, in the streets, in the parks, in railway trains and in dance-halls: the untrammelled enjoyment of the society of young girls. We, segregated, imprisoned behind iron bars, stared at these short-skirted imps as though at enchanted beings, dreaming of even a single conversation with a girl as of something unattainable. Deprivation of that kind is not easily forgotten. The fact that, later on, swift and, for the most part, cheap adventures with all kinds of accommodating wenches came our way, by no means compensated for those sentimental boyish dreams, and I could tell by the gauche and clumsy way in which I stammered and stuttered whenever I happened to be introduced to a young girl in society (although I had by this time slept with a dozen women) that long years of deprivation had impaired, robbed me of, my naïve and natural ease of manner."

Haben sie was bemerkt? Die Wirtin putzt gleichmütig an den Gläsern, der Ulan zeigt mir beharrlich den breiten stämmigen Rücken. Vielleicht haben sie’s gar nicht beachtet. Ich kann ja nur eine Minute, höchstens zwei Minuten lang eingenickt sein, der abgedrehte Zigarettenstummel glimmt noch in der Aschenschale. Eine Minute, zwei Minuten höchstens kann die wüste Träumerei gedauert haben. Aber dieser Traum hat mir alles Warme und Dumpfe aus dem Leibe gelaugt; plötzlich weiß ich eisig klar, was geschehen ist. Weg, nur weg jetzt vor allem aus dieser Spelunke! Ich klirre das Geld auf den Tisch, gehe zur Tür, und sofort steht der Ulan Habtacht. Ich spüre gerade noch, mit welchem merkwürdigen Blick die Arbeiter von ihren Karten aufschauen, und weiß: sofort, wenn ich die Tür zuziehe, werden sie zu schwatzen anfangen über den Sonderling im Offiziersrock; alle Menschen werden von heut an so hinter meinem Rücken lachen. Alle, alle, alle, und keiner wird Mitleid haben mit dem Narren seines Mitleids.","Ah! - I startle. Where am I? I stare wildly around me. My God, I must have been sleeping, I must have fallen asleep in that wretched sloop. I look around shyly. Did you notice anything? The landlady indifferently cleans the glasses, the Ulan persistently shows me his broad, stocky back. Maybe they didn't even notice. I can only have dozed off for a minute, two minutes at the most, the twisted cigarette butt is still smoldering in the ash tray. The wild reverie may have lasted a minute, two minutes at most. But this dream drained everything warm and dull from my body; suddenly I know with icy clarity what has happened. Get away, just get away now, especially from this dive bar! I bang the money on the table, go to the door, and immediately the Ulan stands guard. I can just about feel the odd expression in which the workers look up from their cards and I know: as soon as I close the door they will start chattering about the oddball in the officer's coat; from now on everyone will laugh like that behind my back. All, all, all, and no one will pity the fool of his pity.","I wake with a start. Where am I? I stare frantically around me. My God, I must have dropped off to sleep, I went to sleep in this wretched hovel. I look round in some alarm. Did anyone notice? The landlady is calmly polishing glasses, the lancer is still there but showing me only his broad, sturdy back. Perhaps no one saw me go to sleep. I can’t have nodded off for more than a minute, two minutes at the most, because my cigarette end is still glowing in the ashtray. But that dream has drained all the warmth from my dazed mind; all at once I know, with icy clarity, what has happened. I must get out of this inn! I throw down some money on the table, go to the door, and at once the lancer stands to attention. I can still feel the strange looks the workmen give me as they look up from their cards, and I know that as soon as I close the door they will start gossiping about the eccentric officer who came in here wearing his uniform , I know that from this day on everyone will be laughing at me behind my back. Everyone, everyone, no one will show any pity to a man fooled by his own pity.","Aah! I started up in a panic. Where was I? I stared around me wildly. My God! I must have fallen asleep, fallen asleep in this wretched little tavern. I gazed timidly around me. Had they noticed anything? The landlady was nonchalantly polishing the glasses, the Uhlan had his broad, sturdy back turned pointedly towards me. Perhaps they hadn’t noticed anything. I could have dozed off for only a minute or two at the most, for the stub of my cigarette was still glowing in the ashtray. My confused dream could only have lasted a minute or two at the most. But it had washed away all the warm drowsiness from my body, and suddenly I knew with icy-cold clarity what had happened. Away, I must get away from this grog-shop! Throwing the money down on the table, I made for the door, and the Uhlan immediately stood to attention. I could feel the workmen eyeing me curiously as they glanced up from their game, and I knew that when I closed the door behind me they would begin to chatter about the queer fish in officer’s uniform, that from now on everyone would laugh at me behind my back. All, all, all of them, and no one would have pity on the foolish slave of his own pity."

"Ich klinke auf. In der vorderen Hälfte des Lokals sind die Lampen aus Sparsamkeitsgründen bereits abgelöscht, ausgespannt liegen die Zeitungen herum und der Markeur Eugen zählt die Losung zusammen. Jedoch im Spielzimmer rückwärts sehe ich noch Licht und einen Schimmer von blanken Uniformknöpfen; wahrhaftig, da sitzen sie noch, die ewigen Tarockkumpane, Jozsi, der Oberleutnant, Ferencz, der Leutnant, und der Regimentsarzt Goldbaum. Anscheinend haben sie ihre Partie längst ausgespielt und lehnen nur noch duslig herum in jener mir wohlbekannten Kaffeehausfaulheit, die sich vor dem Aufstehen fürchtet; so wird’s ein rechtes Gottesgeschenk für sie, daß mein Erscheinen ihr langweiliges Dösen unterbricht.","I open the doorbell. In the front half of the bar, the lamps have already been switched off to save money, the newspapers are spread out and the markeur Eugen is adding up the passwords. However, back in the playroom I can still see light and a gleam of shiny uniform buttons; really, there they are, the eternal tarot buddies, Jozsi, the first lieutenant, Ferencz, the lieutenant, and Goldbaum, the regimental doctor. Apparently they've played their part long ago and just lean around dozily in that coffee-house laziness I know so well, which is afraid to get up; so it will be a godsend for them that my appearance interrupts their boring doze.","I lift the latch. At the front of the café the lights are already extinguished to save on expense, the newspapers lie around open, and Eugen the waiter is cashing up for the night. However, I can still see light and a glint of shiny uniform buttons in the card room at the back. Sure enough, there they are, the usual card-players, Jozsi the first lieutenant, Ferencz the second lieutenant, and the regimental doctor Goldbaum. It looks as if their game finished long ago, and now they are just lounging around in the torpor typical of the café. I’m familiar with it, it sets in when no one wants to go to the trouble of standing up. It’s a real stroke of good luck for them when my appearance rouses them from apathy.","I opened the door. In the front half of the café the lights were already extinguished for reasons of economy, newspapers were lying about all over the place, and Eugen, the head waiter, was counting the takings. Only in the billiard-room at the back could I still see a light and the glimmer of polished uniform buttons. Yes, by Jove, there they still were, those everlasting tarock players, Jozsi, Ferencz, and Goldbaum, the regimental doctor. Evidently they had long since finished their game, and were merely lolling about in that familiar state of café inertia in which one is afraid to make a move; and so it was a regular godsend for them that my arrival should break in upon their boredom and lethargy."
"Alles geht zuerst gut. Wir haben – gesegneterweise – einen scharfen Tag, Übung für das Manöver, die große Schlußdefilierung, wo jede Eskadron in entwickelter Linie am Kommandierenden vorüberreitet, jeder Pferdekopf, jede Säbelspitze haarscharf ausgerichtet. Bei solchen Paradestücken gibt es verdammt viel zu tun, zehnmal, zwanzigmal heißt es von neuem beginnen, jeden einzelnen Ulanen im Auge behalten, und so sehr fordert die Übung von jedem unter uns Offizieren angespannteste Aufmerksamkeit, daß ich unentrinnbar ganz bei der Sache bin und alles andere vergesse. Gottlob!","Everything goes well at first. We have - blessedly - a sharp day, practice for the manoeuvre, the great final parade, where every squadron rides past the commander in a developed line, every horse's head, every saber point lined up by a hair's breadth. There's a hell of a lot to do with such parades, starting all over again ten, twenty times, keeping an eye on every single Uhlan, and the drill demands so much tense attention from every one of us officers that I can't help but get caught up in it and all forget others. Thank God!","At first all goes well. Luckily there is a great deal to do today: preparation for the large-scale manoeuvres, a closing parade with every squadron drawn up in line to ride past the commanding officer, every horse’s head and every sword point perfectly aligned. Such spectacular parades call for hard work, you have to begin all over again ten or twenty times, keep your eye on every single lancer, and the whole exercise demands such close attention from every one of us officers that I have no choice but to keep my mind entirely on what I am doing and forget everything else—thank God!","At first all went well. We had — thank God! — a very full day, carrying out various movements in preparation for the manœuvres and ending up with the ‘march past’, in which the regiment rides past the commanding officer in line of squadron column, every horse’s head, every sword-point ‘dressed’ dead straight. At such parades there is always a confounded lot to do — ten, twenty times, you have to start all over again from the beginning, to keep your eye on every single Uhlan, and such an extreme effort of attention was demanded on the part of every one of us officers that my mind was entirely concentrated on my duties, and I forgot everything else. But when we broke off for ten minutes to let the horses have a breather, my gaze happened to wander over the horizon."

"Der Notar trocknete sorglich die feuchten Unterschriften, dann schüttelten alle drei ihm die Hand und gingen die Treppe hinab, zuerst die Dietzenhof, hinter ihr verhaltenen Atems Kanitz und nach ihm Doktor Gollinger, wobei es Kanitz höchlichst erbitterte, daß ihm sein Komplize von rückwärts her andauernd mit dem Stock in die Rippen tippte und mit seiner Bierstimme pathetisch murmelte (nur ihm verständlich): ›Lumpus maximus, lumpus maximus!‹ Dennoch war es Kanitz unangenehm, als Doktor Gollinger sich bereits beim Haustor mit einer ironisch tiefen Verbeugung empfahl. Denn dadurch blieb er mit seinem Opfer allein, und das erschreckte ihn.","The notary carefully dried the damp signatures, then all three shook his hand and went down the stairs, first Dietzenhof, followed by Kanitz, holding her breath, and then Doctor Gollinger, whereby Kanitz was extremely galled that his accomplice was following him from behind tapped his ribs with his stick and murmured pathetically in his beer voice (he could only be understood by him): 'Lumpus maximus, lumpus maximus!'

"»Hallo, was ist das?« brummt er. »Ein neues Ausrüstungsstück!« Er nimmt mir die Zigarettendose einfach aus der Hand (was kann ich dagegen tun?), betastet, beschaut und wiegt sie schließlich auf der Handfläche. »Du, mir scheint«, wendet er sich hinüber zum Regimentsarzt, »die ist sogar echt. Geh, schau dir die einmal gut an – dein würdiger Erzeuger soll ja mit derlei handeln, da wirst dich doch auch einigermaßen auskennen.«","""Hello, what's that?"" he growls.

Come along, have a good look at it — your governor deals in this kind of thing, I’m told, and you ought to know something about it.’"
"Damit begann das Gespräch ins Allgemeine abzuschwenken. Aber unser Kanitz hatte genug gehört, daß ihm die Ohren brannten. Wenige kannten Kekesfalva so gründlich wie er; schon vor zwanzig Jahren war er dort gewesen, um das Mobiliar zu versichern. Er kannte auch Petrovic, kannte ihn sogar sehr genau aus der Zeit seiner allerersten Geschäfte; jener bieder tuende Bursche hatte das dicke Geld, das er alljährlich bei der Gutsverwaltung in seine eigene Tasche steckte, durch seine Vermittlung immer bei Doktor Gollinger auf Hypotheken hinterlegt. Aber das wichtigste für Kanitz war: er erinnerte sich ganz genau an den Schrank mit dem chinesischen Porzellan und an gewisse glasierte Plastiken und seidene Stickereien, die vom Großvater der Orosvár stammten, der russischer Gesandter in Peking gewesen war; schon zu Lebzeiten der Fürstin hatte er, der allein ihren immensen Wert kannte, sie für Rosenfeld in Chikago zu kaufen gesucht. Es waren Stücke seltenster Art, vielleicht zwei-bis dreitausend Pfund wert; die alte Orosvár hatte natürlich keine Ahnung, was für Preise man seit ein paar Jahrzehnten drüben in Amerika für Ostasiatica zahlte, aber sie hatte Kanitz grob abfahren lassen, sie gebe überhaupt nichts her, er solle sich zum Teufel scheren. Wenn diese Stücke noch vorhanden waren – Kanitz zitterte bei dem Gedanken –, konnte man sie bei einer Besitzveränderung spottbillig herausholen. Am besten natürlich wäre, sich das Vorkaufsrecht für das ganze Inventar zu sichern.","With that, the conversation began to veer off into the general. But our Kanitz had heard enough that his ears were burning. Few knew Kekesfalva as thoroughly as he; he had been there twenty years ago to insure the furniture. He also knew Petrovic, knew him very well even from the time of his very first dealings; through his intermediary, that staid fellow had always put the big money that he put into his own pocket every year in the management of the estate on mortgages with Doctor Gollinger. But the most important thing for Kanitz was: he remembered very well the cabinet with the Chinese porcelain and certain glazed sculptures and silk embroideries that came from Orosvár's grandfather, who had been the Russian ambassador in Peking; already during the Princess's lifetime he, who alone knew her immense value, had sought to buy her for Rosenfeld in Chicago. They were pieces of the rarest kind, worth maybe two or three thousand pounds; Of course, old Orosvár had no idea what prices people had been paying for East Asian art over there in America for a few decades, but she had rudely dismissed Kanitz, saying she wouldn't give anything away, he should go to hell. If these pieces were still there - Kanitz trembled at the thought - they could be taken out dirt cheap in a change of ownership. Of course, it would be best to secure the right of first refusal for the entire inventory.","“Here their conversation turned to general subjects. But our friend Kanitz had heard enough to set his ears burning. Few people knew Kekesfalva as well as he did; he had been there twenty years earlier to give an estimate of the house contents for insurance purposes. He also knew Petrovic, in fact he knew him very well from his early days doing business deals. Through his, Kanitz’s, agency that apparently upright character had invested considerable sums of money—acquired by annually lining his own pockets from the management of the estate—in securities offered by one Dr Gollinger. Most important of all to Kanitz, however, was this—he remembered the cupboard of Chinese porcelain very clearly, along with a number of jade figurines and silk embroideries acquired by Princess Orosvár’s grandfather, who had been Russian ambassador to Peking. As the only person aware of their immense value, Kanitz had tried, on behalf of Rosenfeld in Chicago, to buy them from the Princess in her lifetime. They were very rare objects, worth perhaps two or three thousand pounds each. Of course the old lady had no idea of the high prices that had been paid in America for East Asian art during the last few decades, and had sent Kanitz off with a flea in his ear, saying she wasn’t letting anything out of her hands, and he could go to the devil. If those pieces were still in the house—Kanitz trembled at the mere thought—he might be able to get them really cheap if the place was changing hands. It would be best, of course, to make sure he had the right of first refusal for the entire inventory of the house contents.","At this point the conversation turned to general topics. But our friend Kanitz had heard quite enough to make his ears burn. Few people knew Kekesfalva so well as he; he had been there twenty years before to insure the furniture. He knew Petrovic too, knew him very well from when he had first started in business. It was through his good offices that the scoundrel had always invested with a certain Dr Gollinger the fat sums he screwed out of the estate every year and put in his own pocket. But the most important thing of all was that Kanitz could still vividly recall the cabinet containing the Chinese porcelain, the sculptured glass and the silk embroideries which had been left by Prince Orosvár’s grandfather, who had been Russian ambassador in Pekin. During the lifetime of the Princess he, Kanitz, who alone was aware of their immense value, had tried to buy them for Rosenfeld in Chicago. They were objets d’art of the rarest kind, worth some two to three thousand pounds. The old lady, of course, had had no idea of the fabulous prices that were being paid in America for oriental objets d’art, and she had sent Kanitz about his business. She wasn’t going to let anything go, she had said, he could go to the devil! If those articles were still there — Kanitz trembled at the thought — one could get them dirt cheap when the property changed hands. The best thing would be to secure an option on the whole of the furniture and effects."

Aber nötig wär außerdem, daß Ihr Herr Papa im Kriegsministerium zu dem Urlaub noch ein besonderes Reisestipendium für den Herrn Leutnant Hofmiller herauskitzelt.«","»Well then: Switzerland, vacation, Engadin – not bad at all! It's excellent if it's actually passed to me on the serving board, as you imagine, without me having to obediently say ""please, please"". But it would also be necessary for your papa at the War Ministry to tease out a special travel grant for Lieutenant Hofmiller for the leave.”","“Yes, that’s all very well—Switzerland , leave, the Engadine valley—oh, not bad at all. Excellent if it drops into my lap just as you imagine, with no need for me to bow and scrape and ask permission. But your father would also have to ask the top brass in the War Ministry to come up with a special stipend allowing Lieutenant Hofmiller to travel!”","‘Very good — Switzerland, leave, the Engadine — not half bad! Excellent, if it’s all actually going to be served up to me on a silver tray, as you seem to imagine, without my having to beg for it “gehorsamst”. But your father would have to wheedle a special travelling scholarship for Herr Leutnant Hofmiller out of the War Office, in addition to leave.’"
"»Gar nichts meine ich«, fauchte er mich an. »Und gar kein ›also‹! Was wollt ihr denn alle von mir? Ich habe keine Telephonleitung zum lieben Gott. Gar nichts habe ich gesagt. Gar nichts Bestimmtes. Gar nichts meine ich und glaube ich und denke ich und verspreche ich. Ich habe ohnehin schon viel zuviel geschwätzt. Und überhaupt jetzt Schluß! Schönen Dank für Ihre Begleitung. Sie tun besser, eiligst umzukehren, sonst bleibt an Ihrem Rock kein Faden trocken.«","""I don't mean anything,"" he hissed at me. “And no 'so' at all! What do you all want from me? I don't have a phone line to the good Lord. I didn't say anything. Nothing specific. I don't mean anything and I believe and I think and I promise. I've already talked way too much. And now it's over! Many thanks for your company. You'd better turn back in haste, or there won't be a dry thread on your coat.""","“I don’t have any opinion,” he snapped at me. “And there’s no in that case about it! What do you all want me to do? I don’t have a phone line to Almighty God. I haven’t said anything. Absolutely nothing definite. I have no opinion, I don’t believe or think or promise anything at all. And anyway I’ve talked far too much, so that’s an end to it! Thank you for your company. You’d better turn back at once, or your coat will be drenched!”","‘I think nothing!’ he hissed at me. ‘ And there’s no “then” about it. What is it you all want of me? I’m not in telephonic communication with Almighty God. I’ve said absolutely nothing. Nothing definite whatever. I have pronounced no opinion whatever, and I believe and think and promise you nothing. I’ve been chattering far too much in any case. And now no more of it! Many thanks for your company. You’d be well advised to hurry back, or you’ll get a thorough drenching.’"
Jetzt leuchtete zum erstenmal ein Funke in Kekesfalvas aschfarbenem Blick auf: Der Auftrag! Die Frage! Die Erkundigung! Auch er hatte sich erinnert.,"Now, for the first time, a spark lit up in Kekesfalva's ashen eyes: The assignment! The question! The Inquiry! He too had remembered.","And now, for the first time, I saw Kekesfalva’s ashen glance light up. My task! The question! The answer I was to find out! He too had remembered.",And now Kekesfalva’s ashen-grey eyes lit up for the first time. He too had remembered.
Kapitel 2,Chapter 2,That was the unfortunate act of folly with which the whole story began.,"And so I suddenly found myself standing outside the strange, accursed house, the wind blowing cold in my face, my heart hot with shame, my breath coming in gasps as though I were suffocating."
"Aber ich weiß nicht recht, wohin. Ich habe keinen Vorsatz, kein Ziel: in meinen beiden Welten bin ich unmöglich geworden, draußen und drinnen. Nur fort, nur fort, hämmert’s in den Pulsen, nur fort, nur fort, dröhnt’s in den Schläfen. Nur hinaus, irgendwohin, weg jetzt von dem verfluchten Kasernenhaus, weg von der Stadt! Noch die widerliche Hauptstraße entlang und weiter, nur weiter! Aber plötzlich ruft mir jemand von ganz nah ein herzliches »Servus« herüber. Unwillkürlich starre ich hin. Wer grüßt mich da so intim – ein hochgewachsener Herr in Zivil, Breeches, grauer Dreß und schottische Mütze? Nie gesehen, ich erinnere mich nicht. Er steht der fremde Herr, neben einem Automobil, um das zwei Mechaniker in blauen Kitteln hämmernd beschäftigt sind. Aber jetzt tritt er, offenbar meine Verwirrung gar nicht bemerkend, auf mich zu. Es ist Balinkay, den ich immer nur in Uniform gesehen.","But I'm not quite sure where. I have no purpose, no goal: I have become impossible in my two worlds, outside and inside. Just go, just go, it's pounding in your pulses, just go, just go, it's pounding in your temples. Get out, somewhere, away from the cursed barracks now, away from the city! Still along the disgusting main street and further, only further! But suddenly someone calls me a hearty ""Servus"" from very close by. I stare involuntarily. Who greets me so intimately - a tall gentleman in civilian clothes, breeches, gray dress and Scottish cap? Never seen, I don't remember. The strange gentleman is standing next to an automobile that two mechanics in blue overalls are busy hammering away at. But now, apparently not even noticing my confusion, he steps towards me. It's Balinkay, whom I've only ever seen in uniform.","But I don’t really know where to go. I have no plan and no destination in mind —I feel I can’t live in either of my two worlds, the Kekesfalva estate outside town and the barracks here. But I must get away, get away, my hammering pulse tells me, away, away. I feel the word thudding in my temples. I have to get out of here, go somewhere, anywhere away from this damn barracks, away from the town! Down the unattractive main street once more and then just go on and on. But suddenly someone calls a cheerful “Afternoon!” behind me. Instinctively I stare at the speaker. Who’s greeting me as if he knew me—this tall man in civilian clothes, breeches, grey coat, plaid cap? Never seen him before—at least, I don’t remember him. This stranger is standing beside a motor car, and two mechanics in blue overalls are busy hammering away at it. And now, obviously not noticing my confusion, he is coming towards me. It’s Balinkay, whom I have seen before only in his uniform.","But I had no idea where to go. I had no plan, no objective. My position had become impossible in both my worlds, the world of my regiment and the world of Kekesfalva. Oh to get away! my pulses hammered. Away, away! they thundered at my temples. Right away, anywhere, away from these confounded barracks, away from the town! Down the dingy main street and then on and on! But suddenly, from quite near by, a friendly voice called out, ‘Servus!’ Involuntarily I looked across the road. Who was that hailing me so familiarly? A tall man in mufti: breeches, grey coat and Glengarry bonnet. Never seen him before, can’t remember him. He was standing, this stranger, beside a car, at which two mechanics in blue overalls were busily tinkering away. Evidently quite oblivious of my confusion, he came up to me. It was Balinkay, whom I had never before seen out of uniform."
"Ich sause die Kasernentreppe hinunter und flitze so rasch an den Ulanen, die halb angezogen im Hof herumstehen, vorbei, daß sie gar nicht recht Zeit haben, stramm zu machen. In einem Saus bin ich an ihnen vorüber und beim Kasernentor draußen; geradewegs hin zum Blumengeschäft auf dem Rathausplatz laufe ich, soweit Laufen für einen Leutnant statthaft ist. In meiner Ungeduld habe ich natürlich völlig vergessen, daß um halb sechs Uhr morgens Geschäfte noch nicht offen sind, aber glücklicherweise handelt die Frau Gurtner außer mit Kunstblumen auch mit Gemüsen. Ein Karren mit Kartoffeln steht halb abgeladen vor der Tür, und wie ich heftig an das Fenster klopfe, höre ich sie schon die Treppe heruntertrappen. In der Hast erfinde ich eine Geschichte: ich hätte gestern total vergessen, daß heute der Namenstag von lieben Freunden sei. In einer halben Stunde rückten wir aus, darum möchte ich gern, daß die Blumen gleich abgeschickt würden. Also Blumen her, rasch, die schönsten, die sie hätte! Sofort schlurft die dicke Händlerin, noch in der Nachtjacke, auf ihren löchrigen Pantoffeln weiter, schließt den Laden auf und zeigt mir ihren Kronschatz, ein dickes Büschel langstieliger Rosen: wie viele ich davon haben wollte? Alle, sage ich, alle! Nur so einfach zusammenbinden, ober ob es mir lieber wäre in einem schönen Korb? Ja, ja, einen Korb. Der Rest meiner Monatsgage geht auf die splendide Bestellung, in den letzten Tagen des Monats werde ich dafür das Abendessen und das Kaffeehaus mir abknausern müssen oder Geld ausleihen. Aber das ist mir im Augenblick gleichgültig oder vielmehr, es freut mich sogar, daß mich meine Narrheit teuer zu stehen kommt, denn die ganze Zeit schon fühle ich eine böse Lust, mich Tölpel gründlich zu bestrafen, mich bitter zahlen zu lassen für meine zwiefache Eselei.","I rush down the barracks steps and dash past the uhlans, who are standing around in the yard half dressed, so quickly that they don't really have time to get ready. I passed them in a rush and outside the barracks gate; I run straight to the flower shop on the town hall square, as far as a lieutenant is allowed to walk. In my impatience I have of course completely forgotten that shops are not open at half past five in the morning, but luckily Frau Gurtner sells vegetables as well as artificial flowers. A cart with potatoes is half-loaded in front of the door, and as I knock violently on the window, I already hear them tramping down the stairs. In haste I invent a story: Yesterday I totally forgot that today was the name day of dear friends. We're going out in half an hour, so I'd like the flowers to be sent right away. So flowers, quickly, the prettiest ones she could have! Immediately the fat shopkeeper, still in her nightgown, shuffles on in her slippers with holes, unlocks the shop and shows me her crown treasure, a thick bunch of long-stemmed roses: how many of them did I want? Everyone, I say, everyone! Just tie it together, or would I prefer it in a nice basket? Yes, yes, a basket. The rest of my monthly fee goes to the splendid order, in the last days of the month I will have to skimp on dinner and the coffee house or borrow money. But that doesn't matter to me at the moment, or rather, I'm even glad that my foolishness is costing me dearly, for all the time I feel a bad desire to punish myself, a fool, to be paid bitterly for my twofold asshole .","I run down the barracks stairs and race past the lancers lounging half-dressed around the yard. I’ve gone by them so fast that they don’t even have time to stand to attention. Next moment I’m out of the barracks gate, running (in so far as it is proper for a lieutenant to run) straight to the florists’ shop on the town-hall square. In my haste I had entirely forgotten that the shops aren’t open at five-thirty in the morning, but fortunately Frau Gurtner sells not just flowers, real and artificial, but also vegetables. A cart delivering carrots is standing half-unloaded at the shop door, and as I knock vigorously on the window I can already hear her making her way downstairs. Once in the house, I make up a story—yesterday, I say, I entirely forgot that today some dear friends are celebrating an anniversary. We leave barracks in half-an-hour’s time, and I would like to have flowers sent at once. So flowers, please, the finest that she has! At once the stout florist, still in her bed jacket and slippers with holes in them, shuffles along to open her shop and show me her crown jewels, a large bunch of long-stemmed roses. How many would I like? All of them, I say, all of them! Just as they are, simply tied together, or would I rather have them in a pretty basket? Yes, yes, a basket. All that’s left of my month’s pay will go on this lavish order, and at the end of the month I shall have to deny myself supper and the café for a few days, or else borrow some money, but at the moment I don’t mind that, I am even glad that I shall have to pay a high price for my folly. All this time I still feel a perverse desire to punish myself severely for being a fool twice over, I want to pay dearly for my own double blunders.","I tore down the steps of the barracks, and shot so quickly past some Uhlans who were standing about half-dressed in the courtyard that they had no time to spring to attention. At one bound I had left them behind and was outside the gate; from there I ran straight to the flower-shop in the Rathausplatz. In my impetuosity I had, of course, entirely forgotten that shops did not open at half-past five in the morning, but fortunately Frau Gurtner dealt in vegetables as well as flowers. A cart of potatoes stood half-unloaded before her door, and no sooner had I rapped briskly on the window than I could hear her pattering down the stairs. I invented a hasty excuse. Yesterday, I said, I had completely forgotten that today was the birthday of a very dear friend of mine. In half an hour’s time the regiment would be riding out, and so I should like some flowers to be sent at once. Flowers, quickly, then, the finest that she had! Whereupon the plump shop-woman, still in her night-jacket, shuffled off in her worn-out bedroom slippers, opened the shop, and displayed her crown jewel, an enormous cluster of long-stemmed roses. How many did I want? All, all of them, I said. Should she just tie them up as they were, or would I prefer her to put them in a nice basket? Yes, yes, a basket. All that was left of my month’s pay went on this magnificent purchase; at the end of the month I should have either to go without my evening meal and my visits to the café or else to borrow money. But at this moment that was a matter of indifference to me; if anything, I was actually glad that my foolishness was going to cost me dear, for all the time I felt a kind of malicious desire to punish myself thoroughly, blunderer that I was, to make myself pay through the nose for my twofold doltishness."
"»Aber danke schön! Ich pfeife auf diese Art Freundschaft, die nur meiner Krüppelei gilt … Ja, machen Sie nicht so zerknirschte Augen! Natürlich tut’s Ihnen leid, daß Ihnen die Wahrheit herausgerutscht ist, daß Sie eingestanden haben, Sie kommen nur, weil ich Sie ›derbarmen tu‹, wie jenes Dienstmädchen sagte – nur die hat’s ehrlich gesagt und grad heraus. Sie aber drücken sich als ›guter Mensch‹ viel schonender, viel ›zartfühlender‹ aus, Sie sagen um die Ecke herum: weil ich so allein hier hocke den ganzen Tag. Nur aus Mitleid, das spür ich doch längst in allen Gliedern, nur aus Mitleid kommen Sie und möchten noch gern bewundert sein für Dero gnädige Aufopferung – aber bedaure, ich will nicht, daß jemand mir Opfer bringt! Von niemandem dulde ich’s und am wenigsten von Ihnen … ich verbiete es Ihnen, hören Sie, ich verbiet es Ihnen … Glauben Sie, daß ich wirklich angewiesen bin auf Euer Herumsitzen mit Euren ›teilnehmenden‹, Euren feuchten, schwammigen Blicken oder auf Euer ›schonendes‹ Geschwätz … Nein, Gott sei Dank, ich brauch Euch alle nicht … Ich werde schon selber fertig mit mir, ich steh’s schon allein durch. Und wenn’s nicht weiter geht, dann weiß ich schon, wie ich loskomme von Euch … Da!« – sie stieß mir plötzlich die umgewendete Hand entgegen – »Hier, sehen Sie die Narbe! Einmal hab ich’s schon probiert, ich war nur ungeschickt und hab mit der stumpfen Schere den Puls nicht erwischt; dummerweise kamen sie noch zurecht und konnten mich verbinden, sonst wär ich Euch alle schon los und Euer schuftiges Mitleid! Aber nächstes Mal mach ich’s besser, verlassen Sie sich darauf! Glaubt nur ja nicht, daß ich schon ganz wehrlos Euch ausgeliefert bin! Lieber krepieren, als mich bemitleiden lassen! Da!« – sie lachte plötzlich auf, das Lachen riß scharf und zerfranst wie eine Säge – »Da sehen Sie her, das hat mein besorgter Herr Vater vergessen, als er den Turm für mich herrichten ließ … Nur daran, daß ich eine schöne Aussicht haben soll, hat er gedacht … Viel Sonne, viel Sonne und gute Luft, hat ja der Arzt gesagt. Aber wie gut sie mir einmal dienen kann, die Terrasse, das ist ihnen allen nicht eingefallen, nicht dem Vater, nicht dem Arzt, nicht dem Architekten … Schauen Sie einmal da herunter …« – sie hatte sich plötzlich aufgestemmt und mit einem jähen Ruck ihren schwankenden Körper hingeworfen bis an das Geländer, das sie jetzt grimmig mit beiden Händen umklammerte – »vier, fünf Stockwerke geht’s hier hinab und unten ist harter Stein … das reicht aus … und soviel Kraft habe ich gottlob in den Muskeln, um über’s Geländer zu kommen – ja, vom Krückengehen kriegt man stramme Muskeln. Nur einen Ruck braucht’s und ich bin Eure verfluchte Bemitleiderei ein für allemal los, und Euch allen wäre dann wohl, dem Vater und Ilona und Ihnen – Euch allen, auf denen ich Unwesen laste wie ein Alp … Sehen Sie, ganz leicht geht’s, nur so ein bißchen sich herunterbeugen und dann …«","'But thank you!

Of course you're sorry that the truth slipped out, that you admitted you only came because, as that maid said, I'm 'having mercy on you' - only she was honest and forthright. But as a 'good person' you express yourself much more gently, much more 'delicately', you say around the corner: because I sit here alone all day. Only out of pity, I've felt that in all my limbs for a long time, only out of pity you come and would like to be admired for Dero's gracious sacrifice - but I'm sorry, I don't want anyone to make sacrifices for me!

I've tried it once, I was just clumsy and didn't catch my pulse with the blunt scissors; unfortunately they still managed and were able to connect me, otherwise I would be rid of you all and your mean pity! But next time I'll do better, count on it! Just don't think that I'm completely defenseless at your mercy! Better die than let me feel sorry for you! There!' - she suddenly laughed, her laughter tore sharp and frayed like a saw - 'There you are, my anxious father forgot that when he had the tower prepared for me ... Only because I had a beautiful view should have, he thought... Lots of sun, lots of sun and good air, that's what the doctor said. But how well it can serve me one day, the terrace, it never occurred to any of them, not to the father, not to the doctor, not to the architect... Look down there..."" - she had suddenly pushed herself up and with a sudden jerk her own She threw her swaying body up against the railing, which she was now gripping grimly in both hands - ""It's four or five floors down here and there's hard stone at the bottom ... that's enough ... and thank God I have enough muscle strength to get over the railing – yes, walking on crutches gives you tight muscles. It only takes one jerk and I'll be rid of your cursed pity once and for all, and then all of you would be fine, father and Ilona and you - all of you on whom I weigh mischief like a nightmare ...

Of course you’re sorry the truth slipped out , you wish you hadn’t admitted that you come only because you’re so sorry for me, like that new maid the other day, only she meant it and said so straight out. But as a good person you put it much more tactfully, with more delicate feeling. You beat about the bush because I’m so lonely here all day long. It’s only out of pity, I’ve felt that for a long time, you only come here out of pity, and you’d like to be admired for your kind self-sacrifice— but I’m sorry , I don’t want anyone sacrificing himself for me!

And if one day I can’t, then I know how to be rid of you all … here!” She suddenly flung her hand out to me, palm upwards. “Do you see that scar? I’ve tried it once already, but I was clumsy, the scissors were blunt and didn’t cut the vein. So stupid—they came in time to bandage me up, or I’d be rid of you all and your despicable pity. I’ll do it properly next time, you can be sure of that. Don’t think I’m handed over to you defenceless, because I’m not! I’d sooner die than have people pitying me. There!” And she suddenly laughed out loud, a sharp, edgy laugh, rough as a saw. “There, you see that’s something my dear father forgot when he had this tower converted for me … just so that I could have a nice view, he thought. Sunlight, plenty of sunlight and fresh air, that’s what the doctor ordered. But this terrace will come in very useful some day, that didn’t occur to any of them, not my father, not the doctor or the architect … look down there!” She had suddenly braced herself and, with an abrupt jerk, forced her swaying body towards the balustrade, clutching it grimly with both hands. “It’s four or five storeys down from up here, and hard stone when you reach the bottom … that will do. And thank God I have enough strength in my muscles to haul myself over this balustrade. Walking with crutches develops your arm muscles. One good effort and I’ll be rid of your wretched pity once and for all, and you’ll all be glad, my father and Ilona and you, because I’m a nightmare weighing you all down. It’s quite easy , you see … I just have to lean over a little way and then …”","‘Thank you for nothing! I can do without the kind of friendship that is only shown me because I’m a cripple ... Yes, you needn’t screw your eyes up like that! Naturally, you’re upset at having let the cat out of the bag, at having admitted that you come to see me only because I “make your heart bleed”, as that charwoman said — except that she said it frankly and straight out. You however, as a “good person” express yourself far more tactfully, far more “delicately”; you beat about the bush, and say you come just because I have to sit about here alone all day long.

"Aber zu meinem eigenen Erstaunen fand ich immer wieder diese Kraft. Immer wachsen einer ersten Erkenntnis im Menschlichen andere geheimnisvoll zu, und wem nur einmal die Fähigkeit zuteil ward, eine einzige Form irdischen Leidens wahrhaft mitzufühlen, der versteht durch diese magische Belehrung alle Formen, auch die fremdartigsten und scheinbar widersinnigen. So ließ ich mich nicht beirren durch Ediths gelegentliche Revolten; im Gegenteil, je ungerechter und schmerzlicher ihre Ausbrüche waren, umsomehr erschütterten sie mich; allmählich verstand ich auch, warum mein Kommen dem Vater und Ilona, warum mein Mitdabeisein dem ganzen Hause so willkommen war. Ein lang dauerndes Leiden ermüdet im allgemeinen nicht nur den Kranken, sondern auch das Mitleid der andern; starke Gefühle lassen sich nicht ins Ungemessene verlängern. Nun litten sicherlich der Vater und die Freundin bis in den Grund ihrer Seele mit dieser armen Ungeduldigen, aber sie litten schon in einer erschöpften und resignierten Art. Sie nahmen die Kranke als Kranke, die Tatsache der Lähmung als Tatsache, sie warteten jedesmal gesenkten Blicks, bis diese kurzen Nervengewitter sich ausgetobt. Aber sie erschraken nicht mehr so, wie ich jedesmal von neuem erschrak. Ich dagegen, der einzige, dem ihr Leiden eine immer erneute Erschütterung bedeutete, wurde bald der einzige, vor dem sie sich ihrer Maßlosigkeit schämte. Ich brauchte nur, wenn sie unbeherrscht auffuhr, ein kleines mahnendes Wort wie »Aber liebes Fräulein Edith« zu sagen, und schon duckte sich gehorsam der ganze Blick. Sie errötete, und man sah, am liebsten wäre sie, wenn ihre Füße sie nicht gefesselt hätten, vor sich selber geflüchtet. Und nie konnte ich von ihr Abschied nehmen, ohne daß sie mit einer gewissen flehenden Art, die mir durch und durch ging, gesagt hätte: »Aber Sie kommen doch morgen wieder? Nicht wahr, Sie sind mir nicht böse wegen all der Dummheiten, die ich heute gesagt habe?« In solchen Minuten fühlte ich eine Art rätselhaften Staunens, daß ich, der ich doch nichts zu geben hatte als mein ehrliches Mitleid, soviel Macht besaß über andere Menschen.","But to my own amazement, I kept finding that power. My first human knowledge is always followed by others, and anyone who has ever been able to truly empathize with a single form of earthly suffering will, through this magical instruction, understand all forms, even the most strange and apparently absurd ones. So I didn't let myself be swayed by Edith's occasional revolts; on the contrary, the more unjust and painful their outbursts, the more they shook me; Gradually I also understood why my coming was so welcome to Father and Ilona, why my presence was so welcome to the whole house. Prolonged suffering generally tires not only the patient but also the pity of others; strong feelings cannot be extended indefinitely. Now the father and the girlfriend must have suffered to the bottom of their souls with this poor impatient girl, but they were already suffering in an exhausted and resigned way. until this brief storm of nerves has let off steam. But they were no longer as frightened as I was frightened each time. I, on the other hand, the only one to whom her suffering meant repeated shock, soon became the only one in front of whom she was ashamed of her excessiveness. I only had to say a little admonishing word like ""But dear Miss Edith"" when she started up uncontrollably, and then the whole look obediently ducked. She blushed, and one could see that if her feet had not been bound, she would have preferred to flee from herself. And I was never able to say goodbye to her without her saying in a certain pleading manner that went through and through me: ""But you'll be back tomorrow, won't you? Aren't you angry with me for all the stupid things I've said today?' At such moments I felt a kind of enigmatic amazement that I, who had nothing to give but my sincere pity, had so much power over others People.","But to my own astonishment, I kept finding that I had that strength. Once you have gained some understanding of human nature, further understanding of it seems to grow mysteriously, and when you are able to feel genuine sympathy for a single form of earthly suffering, the magic of that lesson enables you to understand all others, however strange and apparently absurd they may be. So I did not let Edith’s occasional irritable moments of rebellion lead me astray, on the contrary. The more unjust and painful her outbursts were the more they shook me, but I also gradually came to understand why my arrival was so welcome to her father and Ilona, and my presence to the whole household. In general a long illness wears out not just the invalid but the sympathy of others—strong feelings cannot be prolonged indefinitely. Edith’s father and friend certainly sympathised deeply with the poor impatient girl, but by now they were suffering from exhaustion and resignation. They saw the sick girl as a sick girl, her lame legs as a fact, they always waited with eyes lowered until her brief nervous outbursts had died down. But they were no longer as startled by them as I always was. I, on the other hand, the only one to whom her suffering always meant a new moment of deep emotion, was soon the only one before whom she felt ashamed of her loss of control. When she flared up angrily, I had only to say a word of gentle reproof—“Oh, my dear Fräulein Edith!”—and she would cast her eyes down obediently. She blushed, and you could see that she would have liked to run away from herself if only her feet did not root her to the spot. And I could never say goodbye without hearing her say, in a certain pleading tone that went straight to my heart, “But you’ll come again tomorrow, won’t you? You’re not cross because of all the silly things I said today, are you?” At such moments I felt a kind of strange astonishment that I, who had nothing at all to offer but my genuine pity, had so much power over other people.","But to my own astonishment I found the requisite strength again and again. In some mysterious way, once one has gained an insight into human nature, that insight grows from day to day, and he to whom it has been given to experience vicariously even one single form of earthly suffering, acquires, by reason of this tragic lesson, an understanding of all its forms, even those most foreign to him, and apparently abnormal. I refused, therefore, to be put off by her occasional fits of rebellion; on the contrary, the more unfair and unwarranted were her outbursts, the more did they move me; gradually, too, I realized why my visits, my presence, were so welcome to Edith’s father and Ilona, to the whole household. Long protracted suffering is apt to exhaust not only the invalid, but the compassion of others; violent emotions cannot be prolonged endlessly. Edith’s father and Ilona certainly shared to the full the sufferings of the poor impatient invalid, but by now their capacity for suffering was to some extent spent, they had become resigned to it. They regarded the invalid as an invalid, her lameness as a fact; they now waited with downcast eyes until the brief nerve-storms had played themselves out. But they were no longer appalled as I was appalled each time afresh, and because I was the only one to whom her suffering was a continually fresh source of consternation, I came to be the only one in whose presence she was ashamed of her lack of control. I had only to say, when she lost her self-control, ‘My dear Fräulein Edith!’ and the grey eyes would be lowered obediently. She would blush, and one could tell that she would have liked to run away from herself; but her crippled legs fettered her to her chair. And I could never take leave of her without her saying in a certain pleading way that shook me to the core, ‘You will come tomorrow, won’t you? You’re not angry with me because of all the stupid things I said today?’ At such moments I felt a kind of obscure amazement at the thought that I, who had, after all, given her nothing except my sincere sympathy, should possess so much power over another person."
"»Sie müssen es verstehen«, flüsterte Ilona mir hastig zu, »sie schläft jetzt keine Nacht mehr. Der Gedanke an die Reise regt sie furchtbar auf und … Sie wissen ja nicht …«","""You must understand,"" Ilona whispered hastily to me, ""she doesn't sleep any more nights now. The thought of the trip upsets her terribly and... You don't know...""","“You must try to understand,” Ilona whispered to me hastily. “She can’t sleep at night just now. The idea of the trip to Switzerland gets her so worked up, and … oh, you don’t know …”","‘You must try and understand,’ Ilona whispered to me hurriedly. ‘ She never gets a night’s sleep now. The thought of going away upsets her terribly and ... you don’t know ...’"
"Abgemeldet? Was heißt das? Abgemeldet? »Einen Augenblick, Fräulein.« Aber sie hat schon abgehängt.","Signed out? What does that mean? Signed out? ""One moment, Miss."" But she's already hung up.","Cancelled? What does that mean? Cancelled? “Just a moment,” I ask the operator, but she has already hung up.","Cancelled? What did that mean? Cancelled? ‘ One moment, Fräulein.’ But she had already rung off."
"Was sechzigtausend? Wer sechzigtausend? – Sofort war Kanitz ganz wach, als hätte ihm ein eiskalter Guß den Schlaf von den Augen geschreckt. Wer hat sechzigtausend verdient und wie – das mußte er doch herausbekommen. Selbstverständlich hütete er sich wohl, den drei Mitreisenden sein Zulauschen zu verraten. Im Gegenteil: er zog die Kappe noch etwas tiefer in die Stirn, damit der Schatten seine Augen gänzlich verdeckte und die andern glauben sollten, er schliefe; zugleich rückte er, behutsam jeden Stoß des Wagens listig nutzend, näher heran, um trotz des Räderratterns kein Wort zu verlieren.","What sixty thousand? Who sixty thousand? - Immediately Kanitz was wide awake, as if an ice-cold downpour had startled sleep from his eyes. Who made sixty thousand and how – he had to find out. Of course he was careful not to tell the three fellow passengers that he was listening. On the contrary: he pulled his cap a little lower over his forehead so that the shadow completely covered his eyes and the others should think he was asleep; at the same time he moved closer, cautiously using every push of the carriage, so as not to lose a word despite the rattling of the wheels.","“What sixty thousand crowns? Whose sixty thousand crowns? Kanitz was wide awake at once, as if icy water had been dashed in his face to rouse him from sleep. Who had made sixty thousand crowns, and how did he do it? Kanitz had to find out. Of course he took care not to let his three fellow travellers notice that he was listening. In fact he pulled his cap a little further down on his face, so that his eyes were entirely hidden in its shadow, and the others would think him asleep. At the same time he cunningly used every jolt of the railway carriage to move slightly closer to them, so as not to miss hearing a single word in the noisy rattle of the wheels.","Sixty thousand? Who? What? How? In a flash Kanitz was wide awake; it was as though an icy-cold shower had driven the sleep from his eyes. Who had earned sixty thousand, and how? He must find out at all costs. Of course he took good care not to let his three fellow-travellers know that he was eavesdropping. He pulled his cap even lower over his forehead, so that its shadow should completely cover his eyes and the others should think he was asleep; then, cunningly and cautiously making use of each jolt of the carriage, he edged nearer to them, so as not to lose a word, despite the rattling of the wheels."
"Und der Regimentsarzt lehnt sich zurück und beginnt mit Kainzens Tonfall: »Mahadöh, der Gott der Erde – stieg herab zum letztenmal – daß er ihresgleichen werde – mitzufühlen Lust und Qual.«","And the regimental doctor leans back and begins with Kainzen's intonation: ""Mahadöh, the god of the earth - descended for the last time - that he may become their equal - to sympathize with pleasure and torment.""","And the regimental doctor leans back in his chair and begins reciting, this time turning to Goethe’s ballad ‘The God and the Dancing Girl’, “Mahadöh, lord of the earth—when he came down here below—assumed a form of human birth—here to share our joys and woe.”","And the regimental doctor leaned back and began to declaim from Goethe: ‘Mahadöh, the god of earth, for one last time came down below, to take upon himself thy form, and feel with thee both joy and pain.’"
»Aber nicht wahr … zum Schlechteren hat sich nichts verändert?«,“But hasn’t it… nothing has changed for the worse?”,“But you didn’t find any change in her for the worse … did you?”,"‘But ... there’s really no change for the worse, is there?’"
"»Ich will mich ja net einmengen, aber glaub mir, Hofmiller, du machst einen Unsinn. Du weißt nicht, was du tust. Du bist heut, schätz ich, so um die fünfundzwanzig oder sechsundzwanzig und nicht weit vom Oberleutnant. Und das ist immerhin schon allerhand. Hier hast deinen Rang, hier stellst was vor. Aber im Augenblick, wo du was andres neu anfangen willst, ist der letzte Schubiak und der dreckigste Ladenschwengel dir über, schon weil er nicht alle unsere dummen Vorurteile wie einen Tornister auf dem Buckel schleppt. Glaub mir, wenn unsereins die Uniform auszieht, dann bleibt nicht mehr viel von dem, der man früher war, und ich bitt dich nur eins: täusch dich nicht, weil’s gerade mir gelungen ist, aus dem Dreck wieder herauszukommen. Das war ein purer Zufall, wie er in tausend Fällen einmal passiert, und ich möcht lieber nicht wissen, was mit den andern heut los ist, denen der Herrgott nicht so freundlich wie mir den Steigbügel hingehalten hat.«","“I don't want to interfere, but believe me, Hofmiller, you're making nonsense. You don't know what you're doing I reckon you're about twenty-five or twenty-six today and not far from first lieutenant. And that's all sorts of things. Here you have your rank, here you present something. But the moment you want to start something else, the last slob and the dirtiest clerk is all over you, if only because he doesn't carry all our stupid prejudices like a knapsack on his back. Believe me, when the likes of us take off our uniforms, there isn't much left of who we used to be, and I only ask you one thing: don't be fooled, because it was me who managed to get out of the dirt again. That was pure coincidence, as it happens once in a thousand cases, and I'd rather not know what's going on with the others today, to whom the Lord God wasn't as kind as I was with the stirrup.""","“Look, I don’t want to meddle with your affairs, but I assure you, Hofmiller, this isn’t a good idea. You don’t know what you’re doing. I’d guess you’re around twenty-five, twenty-six, you’ll soon make the grade to first lieutenant. And that’s quite an achievement. Here you have your military rank, you’re someone. But the moment you branch out on your own, you’re lower in the social scale than any ruffian, any grubby errand boy, because that sort don’t go around weighed down with our prejudices. Believe you me, when one of us takes off his uniform there’s not much of his old self left, and I do beg you, don’t deceive yourself just because I happen to have hauled myself out of the mire again. That was pure chance, a one-in-a-thousand chance, and I hate to think what’s become of others who didn’t have the luck to get a helping hand from the good Lord.”","‘Well, I don’t want to interfere, but believe me, Hofmiller, you’re making a mistake. You don’t know what you’re doing. You are, I fancy, somewhere about twenty-five or twenty-six, and not so far off promotion to first lieutenant. And that’s something not to be sneezed at. Here in the army you’ve got your rank, you’re somebody. But the moment you try to launch out into a new career, the dirtiest ragamuffin and lousiest counter-jumper will rate more than you, for the very reason that he hasn’t got to trail around our fool prejudices like a knapsack. Believe me, when we military chaps take off our uniform there’s not much left of what we once were, and I only beg one thing of you: don’t be deceived merely because I’ve succeeded in getting out of the mire. That was a pure chance, one in a thousand, and I wouldn’t like to think of what’s happened to all the others to whom the Lord hasn’t been so kind as He has to me.’"
"Aber Ilona schüttelte traurig den Kopf. »Nein, lieber Freund, täuschen Sie sich nichts vor. Bei Edith ist das ernst, fürchterlich ernst und wird sogar von Tag zu Tag gefährlicher … Nein, lieber Freund, ich kann etwas derart Schweres nicht plötzlich für Sie leicht machen. Ach, wenn Sie ahnten, was hier im Haus vorgeht … Dreimal, viermal schrillt mitten in der Nacht die Glocke, rücksichtslos weckt sie uns alle auf, und wenn wir an ihr Bett laufen voll Angst, es sei etwas passiert, sitzt sie da, aufrecht, verstört, starrt vor sich hin und fragt uns immer dasselbe, dasselbe: ›Glaubst du nicht, daß er mich wenigstens ein bißchen, nur ganz, ganz wenig gernhaben kann? Ich bin doch nicht so häßlich.‹ Und dann verlangt sie einen Spiegel, doch sofort wirft sie ihn wieder weg, und im nächsten Augenblick erkennt sie selbst schon, daß es Wahnsinn ist, was sie tut, und zwei Stunden später beginnt es wieder von neuem. Den Vater fragt sie in ihrer Verzweiflung und Josef und die Dienstmädchen; sogar jene Zigeunerin von vorgestern – Sie erinnern sich – hat sie gestern noch einmal heimlich kommen und sich dasselbe von ihr wahrsagen lassen, noch einmal … Fünfmal hat sie Ihnen schon Briefe geschrieben, lange Briefe, und dann wieder zerrissen. Von morgens bis abends, von früh bis nachts denkt und spricht sie nichts anderes. Einmal verlangt sie, daß ich zu Ihnen gehen und auskundschaften soll, ob Sie sie gernhaben, nur ein bißchen gernhaben, oder ob … ob sie Ihnen lästig ist, weil Sie so schweigen und ausweichen. Sofort, sofort soll ich zu Ihnen, Sie abfangen auf dem Weg, und schon muß der Chauffeur springen und der Wagen wird geholt. Dreimal, viermal, fünfmal lernt sie mir jedes Wort ein, das ich Ihnen sagen, das ich Sie fragen soll. Und im letzten Moment, wenn ich schon draußen im Hausflur stehe, schrillt wieder die Glocke, ich muß in Hut und Mantel zurück und ihr schwören bei dem Leben meiner Mutter, nicht die geringste Anspielung zu machen. Ach, was wissen Sie! Für Sie endet’s ja, wenn Sie die Tür hinter sich schließen. Aber kaum sind Sie fort, so berichtet sie mir jedes Wort, das Sie ihr gesagt haben, sie fragt, ob ich glaube und ob ich meine – Sage ich ihr dann: ›Du siehst doch, wie gern er dich hat‹, so schreit sie mich an: ›Du lügst! Es ist nicht wahr! Kein gutes Wort hat er mir heute gesagt‹, aber gleichzeitig will sie alles nochmals hören, dreimal muß ich es wiederholen und beschwören … Und dazu noch der alte Mann! Er ist ja seither vollkommen verstört, und dabei liebt und vergöttert er Sie genau wie sein Kind. Sie müßten ihn sehen, wie er mit seinen müden Augen stundenlang an ihrem Bett sitzt und sie streichelt und beruhigt, bis sie endlich einschläft. Und dann geht er selber ruhelos die ganze Nacht auf und ab, auf und ab in seinem Zimmer … Und Sie – Sie haben wirklich von all dem nichts bemerkt?«","But Ilona sadly shook her head. 'No, dear friend, don't pretend. With Edith it's serious, terribly serious and even becoming more dangerous by the day... No, dear friend, I can't suddenly make something so difficult easy for you. Ah, if you had any idea what's going on in this house... The bell rings three or four times in the middle of the night, ruthlessly waking us all up, and when we run to her bed, afraid something has happened, she sits there, upright , confused, staring straight ahead and always asking us the same, the same thing: 'Don't you think he can like me at least a little, just a little bit? I'm not that ugly.' And then she asks for a mirror, but immediately she throws it away again and the next moment she realizes for herself that what she's doing is madness, and two hours later it starts all over again . In desperation she asks her father and Josef and the maids; Even that gypsy woman from the day before yesterday - you remember - she came secretly yesterday and had her tell her the same fortune, again... She has already written you letters five times, long letters, and then torn them up again. From morning to evening, from morning to night, she thinks and speaks nothing else. Once she asks me to go over to you and find out whether you like her, only a little like her, or whether . I'm supposed to go to you right away, catch you on the way, and the chauffeur has to jump in and the car will be fetched. Three times, four times, five times she teaches me every word that I should say to you, that I should ask you. And at the last moment, when I'm already standing outside in the hallway, the bell rings again, I have to go back in my hat and coat and swear to her on my mother's life not to make the slightest allusion. Ah, what do you know! It ends for you when you close the door behind you. But as soon as you're gone, she tells me every word you've said to her, she asks if I believe and if I think - If I tell her, 'You can see how much he likes you,' she screams me: 'You lie! It is not true! He didn't say a good word to me today', but at the same time she wants to hear everything again, I have to repeat and swear it three times ... And the old man on top of that! He's been completely deranged ever since, and yet he loves and adores you as much as he does his child. You should see him with his tired eyes sitting by her bed for hours, caressing and soothing her until she finally falls asleep. And then he himself paces up and down, up and down his room all night, restless... And you - you really didn't notice any of this?""","But Ilona shook her head. “No, my dear friend, don’t deceive yourself. It’s serious with Edith, deadly serious, and getting more dangerous every day … no, dear friend, I can’t suddenly make something so difficult easy for you. Oh, if you only knew what it’s like in this house! She rings her bell three or four times in the night, wakes up the rest of us without a thought, and when we hurry to her bedside terrified that something has happened to her there she is, sitting up in bed distraught, staring into space and always asking us the same question. ‘Don’t you think he really may like me a little, just a very little? I mean, I’m not so ugly.’ And then she demands a mirror, but she tosses it away again at once, and next moment she realises that she’s deluding herself—only for it all to begin again a couple of hours later. In her desperation she asks her father, and Josef, and the maidservants. Yesterday she even summoned that Gypsy woman from the outing the day before—you’ll remember her—asked her to come and see her again in secret, and got her to predict the same future for her as before. She’s written letters to you five times, long letters, and then torn them up again. She thinks and talks of nothing else from morning to evening, from early to late. Sometimes she wants me to go to see you and find out if you like her just a little or whether … whether she’s a nuisance to you, because you never say anything, you avoid speaking out. She wants me to go and see you at once, to catch up with you on your way home, and the chauffeur has to get ready and fetch the car. Three times, four, five times she’ll tell me exactly what I must say to you, how to put my question. And at the last moment, when I’m standing ready in the front hall, her bell rings again, I have to go back to her in my hat and coat and swear to her on my mother’s life never to make the slightest allusion to what she said. Oh, how would you know what goes on? It’s all over for you once you close the front door behind you. But the moment you’ve gone she’s repeating every word you said to her, asking what I think, and whether I believe that … And if I tell her, ‘Well, you can see how much he likes you,’ she screams at me, ‘You’re lying! That’s not true! He didn’t say a kind word to me today.’ But at the same time she wants to hear what I think all over again , I have to repeat it three times over and assure her that … And then there’s her old father. He’s been very upset since all this began, yet he loves and idolises you like his own child. You should see him when he’s been sitting beside her bed, tired out, for hours on end, petting and soothing her until she finally falls asleep. And then he himself paces restlessly up and down all night, up and down in his room … And you—you really didn’t notice anything at all?” “No!”","But Ilona sadly shook her head. ‘ No, my dear friend, don’t deceive yourself. In Edith’s case it’s serious, dreadfully serious, and it gets more dangerous every day. No, my dear friend, I can’t smooth out a difficult situation like this for you all in a moment. Oh, if you only knew what goes on in this house! Three times, four times a night her bell rings, ruthlessly waking us all up, and when we rush to her bedside in a panic lest something should have happened, we find her sitting there, bolt upright, distraught, staring into space. “Do you think he’s just a little bit fond of me, just a very little?” she asks over and over again. And then she asks for a mirror, but throws it aside again, and then she herself realizes that she’s behaving crazily. And then two hours later, the whole thing begins all over again. In her despair she cross-questions her father and Josef and the maids, and yesterday she got that gypsy — you remember the one we met the other day? — to come secretly and tell her the same things all over again. Five times she’s written letters to you and torn them up again. From morning to night, from dawn to dusk, she thinks and speaks of nothing else but you. Sometimes she asks me to go to see you and find out if you’re fond of her, just a little bit fond, or if ... if she’s a nuisance to you, since you’re always so silent and evasive. I have to go off to find you that very minute, stop you on your way home, and the chauffeur has to go rushing off to fetch the car. Three, four, five times she makes me repeat by heart what I am to say to you, to ask you. Then, at the last moment, when I’m in the hall, her bell shrills out again, and I have to go back in my hat and coat and swear to her by all that I hold dear never to make the slightest allusion to the matter. Oh, how should you know all this! For you the whole thing’s over when you shut the door behind you, but no sooner have you left than she repeats to me every word that you have said to her, and asks me if I believe this and think that. And if I say to her, “Surely you can see how fond he is of you?” she shrieks at me, “You’re lying! It’s not true. He didn’t say a single kind word to me today,” but all the same she wants to hear it all over again, and I have to repeat it three times over and swear it’s true. And then there’s my uncle into the bargain. Ever since she’s been in this state he’s been at his wits’ end; he loves and worships you, by the way, as though you were his own son. You ought to see him sitting hour after hour by her bedside, his eyes utterly weary, stroking and soothing her until at last she falls asleep. And then he himself paces up and down his room all night long. And you — do you mean to say you’ve noticed nothing of all this?’"
"»Bitte über diesen Punkt keine Diskussionen! Ich habe zu niemand anderem jener Methode des Professor Viennot auch nur die leiseste Erwähnung getan. Nur Sie haben es auf dem Gewissen, wenn die da draußen glauben, in ein paar Monaten wird jetzt alles wie mit dem Staubtuch weggewischt. Aber wie gesagt, ersparen wir uns alle Rekriminationen – geschwätzt haben wir beide, ich zu Ihnen und Sie wieder ausgiebigst zu den andern. Es wäre meine Pflicht gewesen, vorsichtiger mit Ihnen zu sein – schließlich ist Krankenbehandlung nicht Ihr Metier –, woher sollten Sie wissen, daß Kranke und ihre Anverwandten ein anderes Vokabular haben als normale Menschen, daß jedes ›vielleicht‹ sich bei ihnen sofort in ein ›gewiß‹ verwandelt und man ihnen Hoffnung deshalb nur in vorsichtig destillierten Tropfen eingeben darf, sonst steigt ihnen der Optimismus zu Kopf und macht sie rabiat.","»Please no discussions on this point! I have made not the slightest mention of Professor Viennot's method to anyone else. You'll have it on your conscience if those out there think that in a few months everything will be wiped away like a dust cloth. But as I said, we'll spare ourselves all recriminations - we both chatted, I to you and you again extensively to the others. It was my duty to be more careful with you - after all, treating the sick is not your profession - how should you know that sick people and their relatives have a different vocabulary than normal people, that every 'maybe' with them immediately turns into a ' certainly‹ transformed and you can therefore only give them hope in carefully distilled drops, otherwise the optimism will go to their heads and make them rabid.","“No, no discussion of that point, please! I have not made the slightest reference to Professor Viennot’s method in talking to anyone else. It’s your doing alone if they believe at Kekesfalva that everything can now be put right within a few months, as easily as wiping dust away with a cloth. So as I said, let’s spare ourselves any recriminations; we both talked indiscreetly, I to you, and then you at great length to the others. I should have spoken more cautiously to you—after all, the treatment of the sick is not your profession, so how would you know that invalids and their families do not use the same vocabulary as normal folk , that to their ears every ‘perhaps’ instantly becomes a ‘certainly’? Hope has to be administered to them only in carefully measured droplets, or optimism will go to their heads and run away with them.","‘Now please don’t let us have any argument on this point. I haven’t breathed a word to anyone except you about Professor Viennot’s method. If the Kekesfalvas think that Edith’s illness is going to be swept away in a few months as though with a broom, you alone are responsible. But, as I have said, let us dispense with all recriminations — we have both of us gossiped, I to you, and you in your turn pretty freely to the others. It was my duty to be more cautious with you. After all, it’s not your job to treat the sick. How should you know that invalids and their relatives have a quite different vocabulary from normal people, that they immediately translate every “perhaps” into a “certainly” and that one can only measure out hope to them in carefully distilled drops, or their optimism goes to their heads and makes them quite mad?"
"Ich erwartete einen zornigen Anpfiff. Statt dessen ging sein Gesicht plötzlich aufleuchtend ins Breite. Er patschte in die Hände und lachte laut, dröhnend, selbstzufrieden.","I expected an angry kick-off. Instead, his face suddenly brightened. He clapped his hands and laughed loudly, boomingly, smugly.","I was expecting a furious outburst. Instead, he suddenly beamed broadly at me. Rubbing his hands together, he roared with laughter. He looked very pleased with himself.","I expected an angry explosion. Instead, his face suddenly beamed all over. He rubbed his hands together and burst into a hearty, complacent laugh."
"Mit solcher Unermüdlichkeit und Zähigkeit verdient man allerhand. Doch richtige Vermögen entstehen immer nur durch eine besondere Relation zwischen Einnahmen und Ausgaben, zwischen Verdienst und Verbrauch. Dies nun bildete das andere Geheimnis im Aufstieg unseres Freundes Kanitz, daß er in all den Jahren soviel wie gar nichts verbrauchte, außer daß er eine ganze Reihe Verwandte unterstützte und den Bruder studieren ließ. Die einzige wesentliche Anschaffung, die er sich überhaupt für seine Person geleistet hatte, war ein schwarzer Rock und jene Ihnen wohlbekannte vergoldete Doublébrille, mittels welcher er sich bei den Bauern das Ansehen eines ›Studierten‹ erwarb. Aber als er schon längst wohlhabend war, gab er sich vorsichtigerweise noch immer als der kleine Agent aus. Denn ›Agent‹ ist ein wunderbares Wort, ein weiter Mantel, hinter dem man alles mögliche verstecken kann, und Kekesfalva versteckte dahinter vor allem die Tatsache, daß er längst nicht mehr der Vermittler, sondern längst schon Geldgeber und Unternehmer war. Ihm schien es viel wichtiger und richtiger, reich zu werden, als für reich zu gelten (als hätte er Schopenhauers weise Paralipomena gelesen über das, was einer ist oder bloß vorstellt).","With such tirelessness and tenacity one earns a great deal. But real wealth only ever arises through a special relationship between income and expenditure, between earnings and consumption. This was the other secret of our friend Kanitz's rise, that he spent almost nothing in all those years, apart from supporting a whole series of relatives and letting his brother study. The only essential acquisition that he ever made for himself was a black coat and those gold-plated double glasses you know well, with which he acquired the reputation of a “student” among the peasants. But long after he was wealthy, he was still cautiously posing as the little agent. Because 'agent' is a wonderful word, a broad cloak behind which you can hide anything, and Kekesfalva was hiding behind it above all the fact that he was no longer an intermediary but had long been a financier and entrepreneur. To him it seemed far more important and correct to get rich than to be considered rich (as if he had read Schopenhauer's wise Paralipomena about what one is or merely imagines).","“With such tireless and persistent energy you can earn good money, but real fortunes are made only when there is a particular connection between income and expenditure, takings and outgoings. This was the other secret in the rise of our friend Kanitz—in all those years he spent almost nothing, apart from supporting a whole series of relations and helping his brother to study. The sole major purchase he had made for himself was a black coat and that pair of gold-rimmed glasses you know, which won him a reputation as a scholar among the local rustics. But long after he had become prosperous, he was still modestly describing himself as just an agent, to be on the safe side. Agent is a wonderful word, and can cover any number of contingencies. What Kekesfalva hid behind it was the fact that he had long ago ceased to be a mere go-between; he had now become a financier and entrepreneur. It seemed to him far more fitting and important to be rich than to be considered rich (as if he had read Schopenhauer’s Parerga and Paralipomena, with its wise remarks on what we are and what we make ourselves out to be).","With that sort of energy and tenacity a man can make money in all sorts of ways. But real fortunes are only made as the result of a special relation between receipts and expenditure, between earnings and out-goings. This, then, was the other secret in the rise of our friend Kanitz: in all those years he spent as good as nothing, apart from the fact that he supported a whole string of relations and paid for his brother’s studies. The only money he really spent on himself went in the purchase of a black coat and those gold-rimmed spectacles which you know so well and by means of which he won for himself amongst the peasants the reputation of being a “scholar”. But long after he had become affluent he continued to pose in the district as a little agent. For “agent” is a wonderful word, an all-embracing cloak, which covers a multitude of sins, all sorts of things, and Kanitz concealed behind it, above all, the fact that he had long since ceased to be a middle-man, and was now an entrepreneur and capitalist. It seemed to him to be more important and more sensible to become rich than to be regarded as rich (one might have thought he had read Schopenhauer’s wise paralipomena with regard to what one is or merely represents oneself to be)."
"In jenem November 1913 muß irgend ein Erlaß aus einer Kanzlei in die andere hinübergerutscht sein, denn surr – auf einmal war unsere Eskadron aus Jaroslau in eine andere kleine Garnison an der ungarischen Grenze versetzt worden. Es ist gleichgültig, ob ich das Städtchen beim richtigen Namen nenne oder nicht, denn zwei Uniformknöpfe am selben Rock können einander nicht ähnlicher sein als eine österreichische Provinzgarnison der andern. Da und dort dieselben ärarischen Ubikationen: eine Kaserne, ein Reitplatz, ein Exerzierplatz, ein Offizierskasino, dazu drei Hotels, zwei Kaffeehäuser, eine Konditorei, eine Weinstube, ein schäbiges Variété mit abgetakelten Soubretten, die sich im Nebenamt liebevollst zwischen Offizieren und Einjährigen aufteilen. Überall bedeutet Kommißdienst dieselbe geschäftig leere Monotonie, Stunde für Stunde eingeteilt nach dem stahlstarren, jahrhundertealten Reglement, und auch die Freizeit sieht nicht viel abwechslungsreicher aus. In der Offiziersmesse dieselben Gesichter, dieselben Gespräche, im Kaffeehaus dieselben Kartenpartien und das gleiche Billard. Manchmal wundert man sich, daß es dem lieben Gott beliebt, wenigstens einen anderen Himmel und eine andere Landschaft um die sechs-oder achthundert Dächer eines solchen Städtchens zu stellen.","In that November, 1913, some decree must have slipped from one chancellery to the other, because whir – suddenly our squadron from Jaroslau had been transferred to another small garrison on the Hungarian border. It doesn't matter whether I call the town by its real name or not, because two uniform buttons on the same coat can't be more alike than one Austrian provincial garrison is another. Here and there the same era facilities: a barracks, a riding arena, a parade ground, an officers' mess, plus three hotels, two coffee houses, a pastry shop, a wine tavern, a shabby vaudeville with shabby soubrette, which are lovingly divided between officers and one-year-olds in part-time jobs. Everywhere police duty means the same busy, empty monotony, divided hour after hour according to the rigid, centuries-old regulations, and leisure time doesn't look much more varied either. In the officers' mess the same faces, the same conversations, in the coffee house the same decks of cards and the same billiard table. Sometimes one wonders why it pleases God to place at least a different sky and a different landscape around the six or eight hundred roofs of such a small town.","In that November of 1913, some kind of decree must have passed from office to office, because all of a sudden my squadron had been transferred from Jaroslav to another small garrison on the Hungarian border. It makes no difference whether I give the little town its real name or not, for two uniform buttons on the same coat can’t be more like each other than one provincial Austrian garrison town is to another. You find the same ubiquitous features in both: a barracks, a riding school, a parade ground, an officers’ mess, and the town will have three hotels, two cafés, a cake shop, a bar, a run-down music hall with faded soubrettes whose professional sideline consists of dividing their affections between the regular officers and volunteers who have joined up for a year. Army service means the same sleepy, empty monotony everywhere, divided up hour by hour according to the old iron rules, and even an officer’s leisure time offers little more variety. You see the same faces and conduct the same conversations in the officers’ mess, you play the same card games and the same games of billiards in the café. Sometimes you are quite surprised that it has at least pleased the Almighty to set the six to eight hundred rooftops of these small towns under different skies and in different landscapes.","In November, 1913, the year when my story opens, some order or other must have passed from one department to another, for before you could say Jack Robinson our squadron was transferred from Jaroslau to another small garrison town on the Hungarian frontier. It is of no importance whether I call the little town by its right name or not, for two buttons on a uniform could not more closely resemble each other than does one Austrian provincial garrison town another. In one as in the other the same military establishments: barracks, a riding-school, a parade-ground, an officers’ mess, and in addition three hotels, two cafés, a pâtisserie, a wine-bar, a dingy music-hall with faded soubrettes who, as a side-line, most obligingly divide their attentions between the regular officers and the volunteers. Everywhere soldiering entails the same busily empty monotony; hour after hour is mapped out in accordance with inflexible, antediluvian regulations, and even one’s leisure does not seem to offer much in the way of variety. In the officers’ mess the same faces, the same conversation; at the café the same games of cards and billiards. Sometimes one is amazed that the good God should trouble to give the six or seven hundred roofs of a little town of this sort the background of a different sky and a different countryside."
"»Entschuldigen Sie, Herr Leutnant«, verbeugt er sich, »daß ich unangemeldet bei Ihnen eingedrungen bin. Aber Doktor Condor hat mir aufgetragen, Ihnen seine speziellen Grüße zu überbringen, und Sie sollen verzeihen, daß er das Auto nicht anhalten ließ … es war schon höchste Zeit, er mußte unbedingt den Wiener Schnellzug erreichen, weil er dort abends … und … und … darum bat er mich, Ihnen gleich auszurichten, wie leid es ihm tat … Nur darum … ich meine, nur darum habe ich mir erlaubt, selbst zu Ihnen heraufzukommen …«","'Excuse me, Herr Leutnant,' he bows, 'that I broke into your office unannounced. But Doctor Condor asked me to bring you his special greetings, and you should forgive him for not stopping the car... it was high time, he had to catch the Vienna express train because he was there that evening... and... and... so he asked me to tell you straight away how sorry he was... That's the only reason... I mean, that's the only reason I allowed myself to come up to you...""","“Forgive me, Lieutenant Hofmiller,” he says, bowing, “for arriving unannounced. But Dr Condor has asked me to give you his warm regards and apologise for not asking the car to stop … it was high time to get to the station, he had to catch the Vienna express, because this evening … and … and so he asked me to tell you immediately how sorry he was … that’s the only reason why I … I mean, why I ventured to come up to see you myself …”","‘Forgive me, Herr Leutnant,’ he said with a bow, ‘for bursting in upon you like this, but Dr Condor asked me to present his compliments and to apologize for our not stopping the car ... we hadn’t a moment to lose, he simply had to catch the Vienna express because this evening he has to ... and ... and ... so he asked me to let you know at once how sorry he was ... That’s the only reason ... I mean that’s why I have taken the liberty of coming up to your room.’"
"Kekesfalva schiebt mir den breiten, schwarzledernen Bocksessel des Kontors hin, den einzig bequemen. »Setzen Sie sich, Herr Leutnant, bitte setzen Sie sich«, sagt er mit einem gewissen zärtlich eindringlichen Ton, während er sich selbst, ehe ich zugreifen kann, bloß einen der fragwürdigen Strohsessel heranholt. Nun sitzen wir hart aneinander, er könnte, er sollte jetzt beginnen, und ich warte darauf mit einer begreiflichen Ungeduld, denn was kann er, der reiche Mann, der Millionär, mich armseligen Leutnant zu bitten haben. Aber hartnäckig hält er den Kopf gesenkt, als betrachtete er angelegentlich seine Schuhe. Nur den Atem höre ich aus der vorgeneigten Brust. Er geht gepreßt und schwer.","Kekesfalva pushes the office's wide, black leather buck chair towards me, the only one that's comfortable. ""Sit down, Herr Leutnant, please sit down,"" he says in a certain tender, urgent tone, while he just fetches one of the questionable straw chairs for himself before I can grab it. Now we're sitting tight together, he could, he should, start now, and I'm waiting for it with understandable impatience, because what can he, the rich man, the millionaire, ask me, a poor lieutenant. But he stubbornly keeps his head down, as if intently examining his shoes. I only hear the breath coming from the bowed chest. He walks pressed and heavy.","Kekesfalva pushes a big chair upholstered in black leather over to me—it is the only comfortable chair in the office. “Sit down, Lieutenant Hofmiller, do please sit down,” he says, with a certain affectionately pressing note in his voice, and before I can prevent it he takes one of the rickety wicker chairs for himself. Now we are sitting close together and he could, should begin on what he wants to say. I am waiting impatiently, as I’m sure anyone can understand, because what can this rich man, this millionaire, have to ask of me, an indigent army lieutenant? However, he keeps his head bowed as if intent on examining his shoes. I hear only the heavy, difficult breathing from his narrow chest.","Kekesfalva pushed forward the capacious arm-chair upholstered in black leather, the only comfortable chair in the room. ‘ Sit down, Herr Leutnant, do sit down,’ he said with a certain tender insistence in his tone, bringing up one of the doubtful-looking wicker chairs for himself before I could forestall him. Now we sat close to one another; he could, he must begin, and I waited in an odd state of agitation to hear what favour this rich man, this millionaire, could have to ask of me, a poor subaltern. But he kept his head obstinately lowered, as though he were casually examining his shoes. I could hear the breath coming heavily and painfully from the bowed chest."
"Mit einem Kognak hinter der Kehle, der einen wunderbar durchwärmt, mit einer schönen, schweren Zigarre, deren Rauch einem köstlich die Nase kitzelt, mit zwei hübschen, angeregten Mädchen neben sich und nach einem derart sukkulenten Diner fällt es auch dem Dümmsten nicht schwer, aufgeräumt zu plaudern. Ich weiß, ich kann im allgemeinen ganz gut erzählen, außer wenn mich meine verfluchte Schüchternheit hemmt. Aber diesmal bin ich ganz besonders in Form und konversiere mit wirklichem Animo. Natürlich sind es nur dumme kleine Geschichten, die ich auftische, gerade das Letzte, das sich bei uns ereignet hat, etwa wie der Oberst vorige Woche einen Eilbrief noch vor Postschluß zum Wiener Schnellzug schicken wollte und einen Ulanen rief, einen rechten ruthenischen Bauernjungen, und ihm einschärfte, der Brief müsse sofort nach Wien, worauf der dumme Kerl spornstreichs in den Stall rennt, sein Pferd sattelt und geradeaus auf der Landstraße nach Wien losgaloppiert; hätte man nicht noch telephonisch das nächste Kommando verständigt, so wäre der Esel wirklich die achtzehn Stunden geritten. Es sind also, bei Gott, keine tiefsinnigen Gescheitheiten, mit denen ich mich und die andern strapaziere, wirklich nur Allerweltsgeschichten, Kasernenhofblüten ältester und neuester Fechsung, aber – ich bin selbst darüber erstaunt – sie amüsieren die beiden Mädels unbändig, beide lachen ununterbrochen. Ediths Lachen klingt besonders übermütig mit seinem hohen silbrigen Ton, der im scharfen Diskant manchmal leicht überschlägt, aber die Lustigkeit muß bei ihr wirklich und ehrlich von innen kommen, denn die porzellanen dünne und durchsichtige Haut ihrer Wangen zeigt immer lebhaftere Tönung, ein Hauch von Gesundheit und sogar Hübschheit erhellt ihr Gesicht, und ihre grauen Augen, sonst etwas stählern und scharf, funkeln von einer kindlichen Freude. Gut ist es, sie anzusehen, solange sie ihren gefesselten Körper vergißt, denn freier und immer freier werden dadurch ihre Bewegungen, lockerer ihre Gesten; völlig unbefangen lehnt sie sich zurück, sie lacht, sie trinkt, sie zieht Ilona an sich heran und legt ihr den Arm um die Schulter; wirklich, die beiden amüsieren sich mit meinen Kinkerlitzchen ganz famos. Erfolg im Erzählen hat nun immer etwas Anfeuerndes für den Erzähler; eine Menge Geschichten fallen mir ein, die ich längst vergessen hatte. Sonst eher ängstlich und verlegen, finde ich einen mir ganz neuen Mut: ich lache mit und mache sie lachen. Wie übermütige Kinder kuscheln wir drei uns in der Ecke zusammen.","With a cognac behind your throat that warms you up wonderfully, with a nice, heavy cigar whose smoke tickles your nose deliciously, with two pretty, excited girls next to you and after such a succulent dinner it is not difficult for even the dumbest to be tidy to chat. I know I'm generally pretty good at storytelling, except when my damn shyness gets in the way. But this time I'm in particularly good shape and I'm conversing with real animation. Of course it's just silly little stories that I tell, just the last thing that happened here, like how the colonel wanted to send an express letter to the Viennese express train before the post office closed last week and called a Uhlan, a right-wing Ruthenian farm boy, and impressed on him that the letter had to go to Vienna immediately, whereupon the stupid fellow ran straight into the stable, saddled his horse and galloped straight ahead on the country road to Vienna; if the next order had not been given by telephone, the donkey would really have ridden the eighteen hours. So, by God, there are no profound clevernesses with which I strain myself and the others, really just everyday stories, barracks yard blossoms of the oldest and newest fencing, but - I'm amazed myself - they amuse the two girls immensely, both laugh non-stop. Edith's laughter sounds particularly high-spirited with its high silvery tone, which sometimes cracks slightly in the sharp treble, but the merriment must really and honestly come from within her, for the porcelain-thin and transparent skin of her cheeks shows an increasingly lively tone, a touch of health and even prettiness brightens her face, and her gray eyes, otherwise a little steely and keen, sparkle with a childish delight. It is good to look at her as long as she forgets her bound body, because her movements become freer and freer, her gestures looser; completely at ease, she leans back, she laughs, she drinks, she pulls Ilona close and puts her arm around her shoulders; really, the two of them are having a great time with my knick-knacks. Success in storytelling now always has something energizing for the narrator; a lot of stories come to mind that I had long forgotten. Otherwise rather anxious and embarrassed, I find courage that is completely new to me: I laugh with them and make them laugh. The three of us huddle together in the corner like high-spirited children.","Even the dullest of men would not find it hard to talk agreeably with a cognac inside him, warming him very pleasantly, with the smoke of a fine fat cigar delicately tickling his nostrils, with two pretty, lively girls beside him, and after such a succulent dinner. I know that I can generally tell a story well unless my wretched tendency to shyness overcomes me. But this time I am on particularly good form, and I talk with genuine vivacity. Of course I tell only silly little stories, the latest incident to have happened at the barracks, for instance how our colonel wanted to send an express letter off by the fast train to Vienna last week before the post office closed, summoned one of our lancers, a typical rustic Ruthenian lad, and impressed it upon him that the letter must go off to Vienna at once, whereupon the silly fellow runs straight off to the stables, saddles his horse, and gallops down the road to Vienna. If we hadn’t been able to get in touch by telephone with the garrison nearest to ours, that idiot really would have spent eighteen hours riding the whole way. I am not, Heaven knows, taxing myself and my companions with words of great wisdom, just telling everyday anecdotes, tales of the barracks square both old and new, but to my own amazement they amuse the two girls enormously, and both are kept in fits of mirth. Edith’s laughter is particularly high-spirited, with a pretty silvery note that sometimes breaks into a descant, and her amusement must be genuine and spontaneous, for the thin, translucent porcelain skin of her cheeks shows more and more colour, a touch of good health and even beauty lights up her face, and her grey eyes, usually rather sharp and steely, sparkle with childlike delight. It is pleasant to look at her when she forgets her crippled body and her movements are easier, freer, her gestures less constrained, she leans back in a perfectly natural way , she laughs, she drinks, she draws Ilona to her and puts an arm around her shoulders. In fact, the two girls are really enjoying my trifling anecdotes. Success in storytelling always gratifies the storyteller. I recollect a great many stories that I had forgotten long ago. Although I am usually rather timid and awkward, I find new courage in myself. I laugh with the girls, and make them laugh. The three of us sit comfortably together there in the corner like high-spirited children.","After so excellent a dinner, with a brandy at the back of my throat sending glorious warmth throughout my body, a fat cigar in my mouth, its smoke tickling my nose deliciously, and two pretty, vivacious girls beside me, I should have been the dullest of clods had I found any difficulty in chatting away gaily. I know that I am usually a good conversationalist, except when inhibited by my confounded shyness. But this time I was somehow or other in tip-top form, and I chattered away with real animation. Of course, they were only silly little stories that I regaled them with: the latest happenings in barracks, the story, for instance, of how, the week before, the Colonel, wishing to send off an express letter in time to catch the mail to Vienna, had sent for an Uhlan, a regular Ruthenian peasant lad, and impressed on him that the letter must go off to Vienna at once, whereupon the dolt had dashed off post-haste to the stables, saddled his horse and galloped off along the high-road to Vienna! If we hadn’t rung up the next garrison and let them know, the silly ass would actually have done the whole eighteen hours’ ride to Vienna. Lord knows I didn’t bore them and myself with a lot of profound and clever stuff, I really only retailed the most humdrum stories, barrack-room yarns and so forth, but to my infinite astonishment, I amused the two girls no end, and they never stopped laughing for a moment. Edith’s laugh sounded particularly exuberant with its high, silvery note and occasional shrill treble, but her gaiety must quite genuinely have come from within, for the skin of her thin cheeks, transparent and delicate as porcelain, took on a warmer and warmer hue; a flush of health, of positive prettiness, lit up her face, and her grey eyes, as a rule somewhat steely and hard, sparkled with childish delight. It was good to look at her when she forgot her fettered body, for at such moments her movements became more and more relaxed, her gestures more natural; she leaned back at her ease, she laughed, drank, drew Ilona down to her and put her arm round her shoulders. There was no denying that they both enjoyed my sallies famously. It is always encouraging for a talker to find that he is being a success, and a whole string of stories that I had long since forgotten came back to me. Usually shy and embarrassed, I now discovered in myself a boldness quite new to me; I made them laugh and laughed with them. The three of us giggled together in the corner like school-children."
"Ich antwortete nicht. Es war auch unnötig. Ilona mußte ohnehin bemerkt haben, wie erschüttert ich war. Nun klopfte sie vorsichtig an die Tür, und kaum daß von innen Antwort kam, ein leises schüchternes »Herein«, mahnte sie noch rasch:","I didn't answer. It was also unnecessary. Ilona must have noticed how shaken I was anyway. Now she knocked cautiously on the door, and as soon as there was an answer from inside, a soft, shy ""Come in,"" she quickly warned:","I didn’t reply, and there was no need. Ilona must have noticed how shaken I was anyway. Now she knocked cautiously at the door, and as soon as an answer came from the other side of it, a shy, soft “Come in”, she warned me quickly, “Don’t stay too long.","I made no reply. Nor was it necessary. Ilona must have noticed how shaken and distressed I was. She now knocked cautiously on the door, and from inside came a faint, timorous ‘Come in.’"
"»Verzeihen Sie … ich wollte nicht davon sprechen … was wollte ich? Ja … morgen kommt Doktor Condor wieder aus Wien, er hat sich telephonisch angesagt … er kommt immer regelmäßig jede zwei oder drei Wochen, um nachzuschauen … Wenn’s nach mir ginge, ließe ich ihn überhaupt nicht weg … er könnte doch hier wohnen im Haus, jeden Preis würde ich ihm zahlen. Aber er sagt, er braucht eine gewisse Distanz in der Beobachtung, um … eine gewisse Distanz, um … ja … was wollte ich sagen? … Ich weiß schon … also morgen kommt er und wird nachmittags Edith untersuchen; er bleibt dann jedesmal zum Abendessen und fährt nachts mit dem Schnellzug zurück. Und nun hab ich mir gedacht, wenn jemand ihn so ganz zufällig fragte, jemand ganz Fremder, ein Unbeteiligter, jemand, den er gar nicht kennt … ihn fragte so … so ganz zufällig, wie man sich eben nach einem Bekannten erkundigt … ihn fragte, was das eigentlich auf sich hat mit der Lähmung und ob er meint, daß das Kind überhaupt noch je gesund wird, ganz gesund … hören Sie: ganz gesund, und wie lang er glaubt, daß es dauert … ich habe das Gefühl, Sie wird er nicht anlügen … Sie braucht er doch nicht zu schonen. Ihnen kann er doch ruhig die Wahrheit sagen … bei mir hält ihn vielleicht was zurück, ich bin der Vater, bin ein alter, kranker Mann, und er weiß, wie es mir das Herz zerreißt … Aber natürlich dürfen Sie ihn nicht merken lassen, daß Sie mit mir gesprochen haben … ganz zufällig müssen Sie darauf zu sprechen kommen, so wie man eben bei einem Arzt sich erkundigt … Wollen Sie … würden Sie das für mich tun?«","'Excuse me... I didn't mean to talk about it... what did I want? Yes... Tomorrow Doctor Condor will be back from Vienna, he announced himself by telephone... He always comes regularly every two or three weeks to check... If it were up to me, I wouldn't let him go at all... He could live here in the house, everyone I would pay him the price. But he says he needs a certain distance in the observation in order to... a certain distance in order to... yes... what was I trying to say? ... I know ... well, he's coming tomorrow and will examine Edith in the afternoon; he then always stays for dinner and takes the express train back at night. And now I thought to myself, if someone asked him so completely by accident, someone completely stranger, an uninvolved person, someone he doesn't know at all ... asked him so ... so completely randomly, like one asks about an acquaintance ... asked him, what the paralysis is all about and whether he thinks that the child will ever get well again, completely healthy ... listen: completely healthy, and how long he thinks it will take ... I have the feeling he will don't lie to her... he doesn't have to go easy on her. He can tell you the truth... maybe something is holding him back with me, I'm the father, I'm an old, sick man, and he knows how my heart is breaking... But of course you mustn't let him see that You've spoken to me… quite by accident you must bring it up, the way one would ask a doctor… Do you… would you do that for me?”","“Forgive me, I didn’t mean to speak about it … where was I? Oh yes … Dr Condor will be coming from Vienna again tomorrow, he telephoned to say so … he regularly comes to visit us every two or three weeks to examine her … if I had my way I wouldn’t let him leave us again at all … he could live in this house , I’d pay him anything he wanted. But he says he needs a certain distance to … now what was I going to say? I know … so anyway, he’s coming tomorrow, and he will examine Edith in the afternoon. He always stays for dinner in the evening, and goes back to Vienna on the night express. And so I was thinking, suppose someone happened to ask him entirely by chance, someone who’s a total stranger and has no personal interest in it, someone he doesn’t know at all, suppose that person were to ask him quite … quite by chance, as you might ask about a mere acquaintance … were to ask how bad her paralysis really is, does he think the child will ever be entirely cured … entirely cured, do you hear? And how long does he think it will take … I have a feeling he won’t lie to you; he doesn’t have to spare you. He can tell you the truth with an easy mind … with me, perhaps something keeps him from it. I’m her father , I’m a sick old man, and he knows it would break my heart … But of course you mustn’t let him guess that you have been talking to me about it … you must mention it entirely by chance, as you might ask any doctor … will you … would you do that for me?”","‘Forgive me. I didn’t mean to talk about it all. What was I going to say? Oh yes, tomorrow Dr Condor is coming again from Vienna — he made an appointment over the telephone. He comes every two or three weeks to see how things are going. If it rested with me I wouldn’t let him go away at all; he could stay here in the house and I would pay him whatever he wished. But he says he needs a certain perspective so as to judge the progress of his patient, so as to ... a certain perspective, so as to ... yes, what was I saying? ... I know. He is coming tomorrow, and he’ll examine Edith in the afternoon; he always stays to dinner afterwards and goes back by the night express. And it occurred to me that if someone were to ask him casually ... a complete stranger, who had nothing to do with the whole thing, whom he doesn’t even know ... were to ask him ... quite casually, as it were ... just as one asks after an acquaintance ... ask him how things were going with regard to Edith’s illness, and whether he thought the child would ever really be cured at all — quite cured, I mean — completely cured, and how long he thought it would take ... I have a feeling that he wouldn’t lie to you. He has no need to spare your feelings, he need not scruple to tell you the truth. When he talks to me he may be keeping something back; after all, I am the child’s father, I am an old, sick man, and he knows how it tears at my heart. But you must not, of course, let him suspect that you have talked to me about it. You must touch upon the subject quite casually, just as a stranger might make inquiries of a doctor. Will you ... will you do this for me?’"
"Unwillkürlich stieß es in mich hinein. Wie, wenn Condor am Ende mittags nicht nach Hause gekommen wäre? Oder zu spät gekommen, um noch den Nachmittagszug zu erreichen? Dann war ja alles vergeblich! Dann wartet und wartet sie. Sofort blitzt das Schreckbild der Terrasse wieder auf: wie sie die Hände anklammert an das Geländer und hinunterstarrt und sich schon neigt über die Tiefe! Um Gottes willen, sie muß doch rechtzeitig erfahren, wie sehr ich meinen Verrat bereue! Rechtzeitig, ehe sie verzweifelt, ehe vielleicht das Entsetzliche geschieht! Am besten, ich telegraphiere von der ersten Station noch ein paar Worte, die sie zuversichtlich machen, für den Fall, daß Condor sie nicht benachrichtigt haben soll.","Involuntarily it thrust into me. What if Condor hadn't come home at midday? Or arrived too late to catch the afternoon train? Then it was all in vain! Then she waits and waits. Immediately the horror of the terrace flashes again: how she clutches her hands on the railing and stares down and is already leaning over the depths! For God's sake, she must know in time how much I regret my betrayal! In time, before she despairs, before the dreadful thing might happen! It would be best if I telegraphed a few more words from the first station, which would make them optimistic, in case Condor shouldn't have informed them.","I instinctively feel a pang of anxiety. Suppose Condor hadn’t come home at midday? Or suppose he had arrived too late to catch the afternoon train? Then it would all have been in vain. Then she will wait and wait. At once the terrible image of the terrace flashes into my mind again—I see her hands clutching the balustrade as she stares down, already teetering on the brink of the abyss. For God’s sake, she must hear how sorry I am for my betrayal in time, before she falls into despair, before, perhaps, the worst happens! I’d better send her a few words by telegraph at the next station we come to. Something to give her confidence, just in case Condor hasn’t told her in time.","Anxiety surged up within me for a moment. What if Condor had not returned home at midday after all? Or if he had come too late to catch the midday train? In that case, all would have been in vain! She would wait and wait. Once more there flashed through my mind that horrible scene on the terrace when she had clung to the balustrade and stared down into the depths below. Oh God, she must be told in time how much I rued my treachery! In good time, before she was plunged into despair, before the worst happened! Perhaps it would be best if I sent her a telegram at the next stop, just a few words to set her mind at rest in case Condor should not have given her my message."
"Edith blickte mit blitzenden Augen in das Getümmel. Plötzlich fühlte ich ihre Hand auf meinem Arm. »Sie müssen auch tanzen«, befahl sie. Glücklicherweise war die Braut noch nicht in den Wirbel gezogen, ganz taumlig starrte sie auf den Ring an ihrem Finger. Als ich mich vor ihr verbeugte, errötete sie zuerst über die ungeziemende Ehre, ließ sich aber willig führen. Unser Beispiel machte wiederum dem Bräutigam Mut. Er forderte, von seinem Vater heftig angestupft, Ilona auf, und nun hämmerte der Zimbalspieler noch besessener auf sein Instrument los, wie ein schwarzer schnurrbärtiger Teufel strich der Primas seine Geige; ich glaube, niemals vordem und nachdem ist in diesem Dorfe so bacchantisch getanzt worden wie an jenem Hochzeitstag.","Edith looked into the tumult with sparkling eyes. Suddenly I felt her hand on my arm. ""You must dance too,"" she commanded. Luckily the bride wasn't drawn into the whirl yet, she stared dizzily at the ring on her finger. When I bowed to her, she blushed at first at the unseemly honor, but she willingly allowed herself to be led. Our example in turn encouraged the Bridegroom. He called on Ilona, nudged violently by his father, and now the cymbalist banged his instrument even more obsessively, like a black, mustachioed devil the primate stroked his violin; I believe that never before or since has there been such bacchanalian dancing in this village as on that wedding day.","Edith looked at the dancing, her eyes very bright. Suddenly I felt her hand on my arm. “You must dance too,” she told me. Fortunately the bride hadn’t yet been drawn back into the swirling crowd, but was still staring, dazed, at the ring on her finger. When I bowed to her she blushed at first at this great, almost excessive honour, but was willing to let me lead her into the dance. Our example encouraged the bridegroom. Prompted by a nudge from his father, he asked Ilona to dance, and now the player of the cimbalom was hammering away on his instrument like a man possessed, while the leader of the ensemble, daemonic with his black moustache, played his fiddle with brio. I doubt whether such bacchanalian dancing was ever seen in the hamlet, before or since, as on that wedding day.","Edith gazed with flashing eyes at the happy, noisy crowd. Suddenly I felt her hand on my arm. ‘You must dance too,’ she commanded. Fortunately the bride had not yet been drawn into the whirling throng; she was staring as though in a trance at the ring on her finger. When I bowed her an invitation to dance, she blushed at the undue honour that was being paid her, but willingly allowed herself to be led off. Our example inspired the bridegroom, too, with courage. At an urgent sign from his father he requested Ilona to dance with him, and now the zither-player hammered away at his instrument more frantically than ever, and the leader of the orchestra fiddled away like a black-moustachioed Mephisto. Never before or after, I fancy, was there such bacchanalian dancing in the village as on that wedding-day."
"Noch ein Brief! Noch ein zweiter, innerhalb von zwei Stunden! Sofort pappt sich mir die Kehle zu mit Ärger und Zorn.

Sie wird mir Boten schicken und mich antelephonieren, sie wird mich umlauern und umlauern lassen bei jedem Schritt, wird wissen wollen, wann ich ausgehe und zurückkomme, mit wem ich bin und was ich sage und tue und treibe. Ich sehe schon, ich bin verloren – sie lassen mich nicht mehr los – oh, der Djinn, der Djinn, der Alte und der Krüppel!

She will send messengers and telephone me, she will lurk and have me lurking at every step, will want to know when I go out and come back, who I am with and what I say and do and do. I see I'm lost - they won't let me go - oh, the djinn, the djinn, the old man and the cripple! I will never be free again, these greedy, these desperate ones will never set me free again, until one of us is destroyed, they or I, through this senseless, unhappy passion.","Another letter!

A second letter within two hours? My throat immediately went dry with vexation and anger. So this was to go on every day, every day, every night, letter after letter, one upon another.

She would send me messages, she would telephone me, she would watch out for me and have me spied upon at every turn; she would want to know when I went out and when I returned, whom I was with and what I said and did. I could see that I was lost — she would never let me go again. Oh, the djinn, the Old Man of the Sea, old Kekesfalva and the cripple — I should never be free again, those greedy, desperate creatures would never let me go until one of us was destroyed, she or I, by this futile, fatal passion."

Ja, so dumm es klingt, ich tanze im Traum, und vielleicht ist es gut für Papa, daß mir das mit … daß mir das passiert ist, sonst wäre ich von zu Hause weggelaufen und Tänzerin geworden … Nichts passioniert mich so, und ich denk mir, es muß herrlich sein, mit seinem Körper, mit seiner Bewegung, mit seinem ganzen Sein jeden Abend hunderte und hunderte Menschen zu packen, zu fassen, aufzuheben … herrlich muß das sein … übrigens, damit Sie sehen, wie närrisch ich bin … ich sammle alle Bilder von großen Tänzerinnen. Alle habe ich, die Saharet, die Pawlowa, die Karsawina. Von allen habe ich die Photographien und in allen ihren Rollen und Posen.

"Ich kann nicht genau das Gefühl beschreiben, das mich bei diesem jähen Erinnern überkam. Ich glaube, es war nicht so sehr Erschrecken als namenlose Beschämung. Denn in diesem Augenblick riß ein Nebel oder vielmehr eine Selbstbenebelung durch. Blitzhaft erkannte ich, daß alles, was ich in den letzten Stunden getan und gedacht, völlig unwahr gewesen war: der Ärger über meine Blamage und ebenso der Stolz auf mein heroisches Quittieren. Wenn ich plötzlich auspaschte, war es doch nicht, weil der Oberst mich abgekanzelt hatte (das passierte schließlich jede Woche); in Wirklichkeit flüchtete ich vor den Kekesfalvas, vor meinem Betrug, vor meiner Verantwortung, ich lief davon, weil ich es nicht ertragen konnte, geliebt zu werden wider meinen Willen. Genau wie ein Todkranker über einem zufälligen Zahnschmerz sein eigentlich marterndes, sein tödliches Leiden vergißt, so hatte ich, was mich in Wahrheit peinigte, was mich feig, was mich flüchtig machte, vergessen (oder vergessen wollen) und statt dessen jenes kleine und im Grunde belanglose Mißgeschick am Exerzierplatz als Motiv meines Fortwollens vorgeschoben. Aber nun sah ich: es war kein heroischer Abschied aus gekränkter Ehre, den ich nahm. Es war eine feige, eine klägliche Flucht.","I can't exactly describe the feeling that came over me at that sudden memory. I think it wasn't so much shock as nameless embarrassment. For at that moment a fog, or rather a self-fog, tore through. I realized in a flash that everything I had done and thought in the last few hours had been completely untrue: the anger at my embarrassment and the pride at my heroic acknowledgment. If I suddenly blurted out, it wasn't because the Colonel had reprimanded me (that happened every week, after all); in reality I was running from the Kekesfalvas, from my deceit, from my responsibility, I ran because I couldn't bear to be loved against my will. Just as a terminally ill person forgets his actually torturous, deadly suffering because of an accidental toothache, so I had forgotten (or wanted to forget) what really tormented me, what made me cowardly, what made me run away, and instead I had forgotten that little and basically inconsequential mishaps at the parade ground as a motive for my wanting to leave. But now I saw: it was not a heroic farewell from offended honor that I took. It was a cowardly, pitiful escape.","I can’t precisely describe the emotion that overcame me at this abrupt reminder. I think it was not so much alarm as a kind of shame. For at that moment a mist of self-delusion cleared from my eyes. In a flash I saw that all I had done and thought in the last few hours had been entirely unreal—my resentment of my disgrace during exercises, the pride I felt in heroically resigning my commission. But I was not resigning because the Colonel had torn me off a strip (after all, he did that to someone every week). In reality I was running away from the Kekesfalvas, from my fraudulent practices, my responsibility. I was running away because I couldn’t bear to be loved against my will. Like someone severely ill who forgets his real, mortal suffering when he has an ordinary toothache, I had forgotten what really drove me mad, made me a coward and sent me running away, or at least I was trying to forget it. I had transferred my reason for wanting to get away, instead, to my minor and ultimately unimportant mishap. But now I saw that I was not making a heroic farewell gesture because my honour was wounded. I was taking to cowardly, pitiful flight.","I cannot accurately describe the emotion that overwhelmed me at this sudden recollection. I believe it was not so much a feeling of horror as of boundless shame; for at this moment a fog seemed to lift within me. In a flash I realized that all I had done, thought, and felt in the last few hours had been completely unreal: my rancour at having been reprimanded no less than my pride in my heroic manner of leaving the army. If I were clearing out, it was not because the Colonel had cursed me (after all, that happened to someone every week). In reality I was running away from the Kekesfalvas, from my own dishonesty, my responsibilities. I was running away because I could not bear to be loved against my will. Just as a man in the throes of a mortal illness forgets his torturing, agonizing pangs because of a chance toothache , so had I forgotten (or tried to forget) what was really tormenting me, what was turning me into a cowardly runaway, and had advanced as the motive for my resignation that trivial mishap on the parade-ground. But now I realized that this was no heroic farewell I was taking out of a sense of wounded honour. This was cowardly, contemptible flight."
"Jedoch auch das Opfer an seiner Seite war sichtlich unruhig geworden. Auch sie bekam einen anderen, einen nachdenklich zögernden Gang. Kanitz, obwohl er den Kopf gesenkt hatte, entging diese Veränderung nicht, er spürte an der Art, wie sie zögernd die Schritte setzte (in das Gesicht wagte er ihr nicht zu blicken), daß sie angestrengt etwas überlegte. Angst überfiel ihn. Jetzt endlich hat sie begriffen, sagte er sich, daß ich der Käufer bin. Wahrscheinlich wird sie mir jetzt Vorwürfe machen, wahrscheinlich bereut sie schon ihre dumme Hast und rennt vielleicht morgen doch noch zu ihrem Anwalt.","However, the victim at his side had also become visibly restless. She, too, took on a different, thoughtful, hesitant gait. Kanitz, although he had lowered his head, did not miss this change; he sensed from the way she hesitantly took her steps (he didn't dare look at her face) that she was thinking hard about something. Fear overcame him. Now she finally understands, he told himself, that I'm the buyer. She'll probably reproach me now, she's probably already regretting her stupid haste and maybe she'll run to her lawyer tomorrow after all.","However, the victim beside him was also visibly uneasy. Her own demeanour was different, was thoughtfully hesitant. Although Kanitz had bowed his head, this change did not escape him. He sensed, from her faltering footsteps (he dared not look at her face), that she was busily thinking something over. Anxiety overcame him. At last, he said to himself, she’s realised that I am the buyer myself. Now she’ll probably fling accusations at me, she’s probably already regretting her stupid haste, and maybe she’ll run straight off to her lawyer tomorrow after all.","But his victim had for her part also become visibly uneasy. Her gait too had changed; she was walking along thoughtfully, hesitantly. This change did not escape Kanitz’s notice, although his head was lowered; he felt from the way in which she falteringly put one foot down after another (he did not dare to look her in the face) that her mind was preoccupied with something. He was seized with panic. Now at last she has tumbled to it that I am the purchaser, he thought. She’ll probably start upbraiding me now; she’s probably already repenting her stupid haste and will go running off to her lawyer tomorrow."
»Bleiben Sie nicht zu lang. Nur einen Augenblick!«,"'Don't stay too long.

He speaks to the tabletop as if hoping for more pity from the hard, cracked wood than I shall give.","At length, as though he had heard the unuttered words behind my closed lips, the old man put down the now shining spectacles on the table in front of him. He evidently realized that I was not going to help him and that he would have to open the conversation himself.

"Obwohl ich Ilona zugesagt hatte, am nächsten Nachmittag zur gewohnten Stunde zu kommen, melde ich vorsichtigerweise meinen Besuch noch vorher telephonisch an. Besser strenge Formen einhalten, Formen sind Sicherungen. Ich will damit klarmachen, daß ich niemandem unerwünscht ins Haus falle, ich will von nun ab jedesmal anfragen, ob mein Besuch erwartet und gern erwartet ist. Das allerdings brauche ich diesmal nicht zu bezweifeln, denn der Diener wartet bereits vor der geöffneten Tür, und gleich beim Eintreten vertraut er mir mit dringlicher Beflissenheit an: »Das gnädige Fräulein sind auf der Turmterrasse und lassen Herrn Leutnant bitten, gleich hinaufzukommen.« Und er fügt hinzu: »Ich glaube, Herr Leutnant sind noch niemals oben gewesen. Herr Leutnant werden staunen, wie schön es dort ist.«","Although I had promised Ilona that I would come at the usual time the following afternoon, I cautiously announced my visit by telephone beforehand. Better to stick to strict forms, forms are safeguards. I want to make it clear that I don't fall into anyone's house unwelcome, from now on I want to ask each time whether my visit is expected and welcome. However, this time I don't need to doubt that, because the servant is already waiting in front of the open door, and as soon as he enters he confides in me with urgent assiduity: ""The gracious lady is on the tower terrace and has asked the lieutenant to come up immediately."" And he adds: 'I don't think Herr Leutnant have ever been up there. Herr Leutnant will be amazed at how beautiful it is there.«","Although I have told Ilona that I will visit at the usual time next afternoon, to be on the safe side I telephone beforehand to say I’m coming. Better to observe the forms of etiquette—you’re safe with them. I want to make it clear that I am not descending on anyone as an unwanted guest, from now on I will always ask whether my visit is expected, and whether I will be welcome. Not that I really need to doubt it this time, because the front door is already open, the manservant is waiting there, and as soon as I am inside the house he eagerly lets me know that “The young lady has gone up to the roof terrace on top of the tower and would like you to join her there, sir.” And he adds, “I don’t think you have ever been up to the terrace, sir. The beautiful view will amaze you.”","Although I had promised Ilona to turn up the following afternoon at the usual time, I thought it advisable to ring up beforehand.

This time there was certainly no need for me to have any lingering doubts on that score, for Josef awaited me at the door. ‘The gnädiges Fräulein is out on the tower and has left word that the Herr Leutnant should go straight up,’ he informed me in urgent, officious tones. ‘I don’t believe the Herr Leutnant has been up there yet,’ he added. ‘He will be astonished to find how lovely it is.’"

Ich aber stehe gleich ratlos da, Eis in den Gelenken, gewürgt von meinem Kragen wie von einem heißen Strick.","I stand there duped, terrified. What - what happened? I stare helplessly as the two old ladies try to calm the sobbing woman, who has now thrown her head on the table in arousing shame.

As for me, I stand there at a loss, my thoughts frozen like ice, with my collar constricting my throat like a burning cord.","I stood there aghast, looking an utter fool. What — what on earth had happened? Helplessly I looked on as the two old ladies endeavoured to calm the sobbing girl, who now, in an access of shame, had buried her head on the table.

"Aber merkwürdig – je mehr ich mich dem kleinen Schlößchen nähere, von dem nun schon die weiße Rundmauer und das durchbrochene Gittertor sichtbar werden, um so rascher sackt mir der Mut zusammen.

Soll ich nicht überhaupt durch jenen Brief die peinliche Affäre als endgültig beigelegt betrachten? Unwillkürlich verlangsame ich den Schritt; zum Umkehren bleibt schließlich immer noch Zeit, und ein Umweg weist sich allemal willkommen, wenn man nicht den graden Weg gehen will; so biege ich, den kleinen Bach auf einem wackligen Holzbrett überquerend, von der Allee zu den Wiesen ab, um zunächst einmal von außen das Schloß zu umkreisen.","But strange - the closer I get to the small castle, from which the white circular wall and the open gate can already be seen, the more quickly I lose courage. Just as one looks for an excuse just before the dentist's door to turn around before ringing the bell, I would like to escape quickly. Does it really have to be today? Am I not supposed to regard the embarrassing affair as finally settled by that letter? Involuntarily I slow down my step; there is still time to turn around, and a detour is always welcome if you don't want to go the straight way; so, crossing the little brook on a wobbly wooden board, I turn off the avenue to the meadows, first of all circling the castle from the outside.","But strange to say, the closer I come to the little castle, when the white wall around it with the ornamental iron gate are in sight, the more my courage fails me. Just as when you are approaching the dentist’s door you look for an excuse to turn back before ringing the bell, I now want to make my escape quickly. Did it really have to be today? Shouldn’t I consider that Fräulein von Kekesfalva’s letter had settled the whole embarrassing business for good? I instinctively slow down; there is still time for me to turn back. Making a detour is always a welcome notion when you shrink from arriving at your destination, so I leave the avenue and turn off into meadows, crossing the little stream on a rickety plank bridge. First I will make a circuit of the villa outside its wall.","But, oddly enough, the nearer I approached the little Schloss, the white walls and the wrought-iron gate of which were by now visible, the more quickly did my courage evaporate. Just as, on arriving at the very door of the dentist’s, one seeks for some excuse to retreat before ringing the bell, so now did I long to make a hurried escape while there was yet time. Must it really be today? Should I not regard the whole disagreeable affair as finally settled by the young girl ’s letter? Involuntarily I slowed down my pace; there was, after all, still time to turn back. One is always glad to make a detour when one shrinks from going straight to one’s objective, and so, crossing the little stream by a rickety plank, I turned off from the avenue into the fields, with the idea of first walking round the house from the outside."

"Mit unheimlicher Deutlichkeit – es galt doch die wichtigste Entscheidung meines bisherigen Lebens – erinnere ich mich an jede Einzelheit dieser aufregenden Verrichtung, an den kleinen runden Marmortisch in der Fensterecke des Ringstraßencafés, an die Mappe, auf der ich das Blatt auseinanderfaltete, und wie ich es dann mit einem Messer, nur damit die Bruchlinie recht tadellos ausfalle, in der Mitte behutsam falzte. Die blauschwarze, etwas wäßrige Farbe der Tinte sehe ich noch photographiescharf vor mir und spüre den kleinen Ruck, mit dem ich ansetzte, um dem ersten Buschstaben den richtigen runden und pathetischen Schwung zu verleihen. Denn es reizte mich, gerade meine letzte militärische Handlung besonders korrekt zu vollziehen; da der Inhalt doch formelhaft feststand, konnte ich die Feierlichkeit des Akts nur durch besondere Sauberkeit und Schönheit der Handschrift bekunden.","With uncanny clarity - after all, it was the most important decision of my life so far - I remember every detail of this exciting task, the small round marble table in the window corner of the Ringstrasse café, the folder on which I unfolded the sheet of paper and how I did it then, with a knife, just so that the score line would be fairly flawless, carefully scored it in half. I can still see the blue-black, somewhat watery color of the ink in front of me, photographed, and feel the slight jerk I applied to give the first letter the right round and pathetic swing. Because I was tempted to carry out my last military action particularly correctly; since the content was formulaic, I could only express the solemnity of the act through the particularly clean and beautiful handwriting.","I remember every detail of the way in which I filled out that form with uncanny clarity—after all, this was the most important decision of my life so far. I remember the small, round marbletopped table in a window corner of the on the Ringstrasse, I remember the briefcase on which I placed the sheet of paper, then using a knife to help me fold it exactly down the middle so that the line of the fold would be faultless. I can still see the rather watery blue-black ink before me in photographic detail, and I remember the little shake I gave myself as I set to work to give the first character I wrote the right rounded, attractive curve. For I wanted to carry out this, my last military duty, particularly correctly. As the wording of the form was predetermined, I could emphasise the solemnity of my resignation only by taking special care to write well and neatly.","I can remember with uncanny clarity, for, after all, the most important decision of my life was being taken, every detail of this upsetting procedure; the little round marble table by the window in the café in the Ringstrasse; I can remember carefully spreading out the form on my briefcase, and folding the paper over carefully with the help of a knife, so that the fold should be dead in the middle. I can still see before me, with all the definition of a photograph, the blue-black, somewhat watery ink, can feel the slight squaring of the shoulders with which I prepared to lend the first letter the correct fullness and melodramatic flourish. For I got a certain kick out of performing my last act as a soldier with ultra-correctitude; and since the contents were prescribed by formula, the only way in which I could mark the solemnity of the occasion was by writing in a particularly neat and artistic hand."

"An jenem Abend war ich Gott. Ich hatte die Welt erschaffen, und siehe, sie war voll Güte und Gerechtigkeit. Ich hatte einen Menschen erschaffen, seine Stirn glänzte rein wie der Morgen und in seinen Augen spiegelte sich der Regenbogen des Glücks. Ich hatte die Tafel gedeckt mit Reichtum und Fülle, ich hatte die Früchte gezeitigt, den Wein und die Speisen. Herrlich gehäuft boten diese Zeugen meines Überflusses sich mir wie Opfergaben dar, sie kamen in blinkenden Schüsseln und in fülligen Körben, und es blitzte der Wein, es blinkten die Früchte, süß und köstlich boten sie sich meinem Mund. Ich hatte Licht getan in die Stube und Licht in das Herz der Menschen. In den Gläsern funkelte die Sonne des Lüsters, wie Schnee glänzte der weiße Damast, und ich fühlte mit Stolz, die Menschen liebten dies Licht, das von mir ausging, und ich nahm ihre Liebe und berauschte mich an ihr. Sie boten mir Wein, und ich trank ihn bis zur Neige. Sie boten mir Früchte und Speisen, und ich erfreute mich ihrer Gaben. Sie boten mir Ehrfurcht und Dankbarkeit, und wie Speiseopfer und Trankopfer nahm ich ihre Huldigung hin.","That night I was God.

"Aber nun ist es geschehen. Und jetzt, Geliebter, da ich nicht mehr leugnen und wegleugnen kann, was ich für Dich fühle, jetzt flehe ich Dich an, sei nicht grausam zu mir; auch das ärmste, das kläglichste Wesen hat noch seinen Stolz, und ich könnte es nicht ertragen, daß Du mich verachtest, weil ich mein Herz nicht verhalten konnte! Nicht erwidern sollst Du meine Liebe – nein, bei Gott, der mich heilen und retten soll, solche Verwegenheit wage ich nicht. Nicht einmal im Traum wage ich zu hoffen, daß Du mich, so wie ich heute bin, schon lieben könntest – ich will, Du weißt es, kein Opfer, kein Mitleid von Dir! Ich will nichts, als daß Du duldest, daß ich warte, stumm warte, bis die Zeit endlich gekommen ist! Ich weiß, schon dies ist viel, was ich von Dir erbitte. Aber ist es wirklich zu viel, einem Menschen dies kläglichste, dies kleinste Glück zu gönnen, das man doch jedem Hunde willig verstattet, das Glück, mit stummem Blick manchmal zu seinem Herrn aufzusehen? Muß man ihn gleich gewaltsam zurückstoßen, muß man ihn peitschen mit Verachtung? Denn nur dies eine, das sag ich Dir, nur dies könnte ich nicht ertragen, wenn ich, erbärmlich wie ich bin, Dir widrig geworden wäre dadurch, daß ich mich verraten habe. Wenn Du mich noch strafen würdest über meine eigene Scham und Verzweiflung hinaus. Dann hätte ich nur einen Weg und Du kennst ihn. Ich habe ihn Dir gezeigt.","But now it has happened.

You shall not return my love - no, by God, who is to heal and save me, I do not dare such boldness. I don't even dare to dream that you could already love me the way I am today - I want, you know, no sacrifice, no pity from you! All I want is for you to let me wait, wait silently, until the time has finally come! I know that this is already a lot that I ask of you. But is it really too much to grant a human being the most pathetic, the tiniest piece of happiness that one allows every dog willingly, the happiness of sometimes looking up at its master with a silent gaze? Must one push him back by force, must one whip him with contempt? For there is only one thing, I tell you, only this I could not endure if, pathetic as I am, I had become offensive to you by having betrayed myself. If you would punish me beyond my own shame and despair. Then I would only have one way and you know it. I showed him to you.","But now it has happened.

Not even in dreams do I dare to hope that you could love me as I am today— you know I don’t want any sacrifice or any pity from you. I want nothing except for you to tolerate my waiting in silence until at last the time has come! I know that even that is a great deal to ask of you.

"Schon will ich hinaus und das Mädchen an mich erinnern. Aber mit einem Mal stocke ich. Denn der da nebenan geht, kann nicht Condor sein. Ich kenne seinen Schritt. Ich weiß genau – von jener Nacht, da ich ihn begleitete – wie kurzbeinig, kurzatmig, schwer und tapsig er mit seinen knarrenden Schuhen geht; dieser Schritt nebenan aber, der immer wieder kommt und sich immer wieder entfernt, ist ein ganz anderer, ein zaghafter, ein unsicherer, ein schlurfender Schritt. Ich weiß nicht, warum ich auf diesen fremden Schritt eigentlich so aufgeregt, so ganz von innen heraus hinhorche. Aber mir ist, als lauschte und spürte nebenan jener andere Mensch genau so unsicher und unruhig herüber. Auf einmal vernehme ich ein ganz dünnes Geräusch an der Tür, als drückte oder spielte jemand dort an der Klinke; und wirklich, sie bewegt sich schon. Der dünne Streif Messing rührt sich sichtlich im Dämmern, und die Tür tut sich auf zu einem schmalen schwarzen Spalt. Vielleicht ist es nur Zugluft, vielleicht nur der Wind, sage ich mir, denn so schleicherisch klinkt kein normaler Mensch die Tür auf, höchstens ein Einbrecher in der Nacht. Aber nein, der Spalt wird breiter. Es muß von innen eine Hand den Türflügel ganz vorsichtig vorschieben, und jetzt merke ich auch im Dunkel einen menschlichen Schatten. Festgebannt starre ich hin. Da fragt hinter dem Spalt eine Frauenstimme ganz zaghaft:","I want to go out and remind the girl of me. But all of a sudden I falter. Because the one walking next door can't be Condor. I know his stride. I know exactly - from that night when I accompanied him - how short-legged, short of breath, heavy and clumsy he walks with his creaking shoes; But this step next door, which keeps coming and going away, is a completely different step, a hesitant, uncertain, shuffling step. I don't know why I'm listening so excitedly, so completely from within, to this strange step. But it seems to me that the other person next door is listening and sensing just as uncertainly and restlessly. Suddenly I hear a very faint noise at the door, as if someone was pressing or playing on the handle; and really, she's already moving. The thin strip of brass visibly stirs in the twilight, and the door opens into a narrow black gap. Maybe it's just a draft, maybe just the wind, I tell myself, because no normal person unlocks the door so sneakily, at most a burglar in the night. But no, the gap is widening. A hand has to push the door leaf out very carefully from the inside, and now I notice a human shadow even in the dark. I stare spellbound. Then behind the gap a woman's voice asks very hesitantly:","I am about to go out and remind the servant of my presence. But all at once I stop. For whoever is moving about in the next room, it can’t be Condor. I know his footsteps very well. I know exactly—from the night when I accompanied him back into town—how he walks in his squeaking shoes, heavily, awkwardly, short of leg and short of breath. Whoever is next door, however, pacing up and down the whole time, has a very different step, more hesitant, more uncertain, a shuffling tread. I don’t know why those unfamiliar footsteps upset me so much, why I listen to them so intently. But it is as if someone next door is listening with my own uneasiness and uncertainty. Suddenly I hear a very faint sound at the waiting-room door, as if someone were pressing down the handle, or just fiddling with it in, and sure enough it moves. The thin strip of brass moves visibly in the dim light, and the door opens just a crack, a narrow, dark crack. Perhaps it is only a draught of air, only the wind, I tell myself, because no one normally opens doors so surreptitiously, no one but a thief breaking in by night. But no, the crack is growing wider. The person on the other side of the door must be pushing it very cautiously, and now I see a human shape in the dark. Fixed to the spot, I stare. Then a woman’s voice just beyond the opening door asks tentatively, “Is … is there anyone in here?”","I was just about to go out and remind her of my presence when I suddenly faltered, for the person who was walking about next door could not be Condor. I knew his step. I knew exactly — from that night when I had walked to the station with him — how he stumped along, short of leg and short of breath, in his squeaking shoes, whereas those footsteps in the next room, that kept approaching and receding, were quite different, more hesitating, more uncertain, more dragging steps. I don’t know why I listened in such agitation, with such inner intentness, to those strange footsteps. But it seemed to me as though the person in the next room were listening just as uneasily and anxiously as I was. Suddenly I heard a faint rustling at the door, as though someone were turning, or toying with, the handle; and lo! it moved. The thin brass bar moved visibly in the twilight, and the door opened just perceptibly. Perhaps it’s only the draught, the wind, I told myself, for no normal person, unless it be a burglar in the night, opens a door so stealthily. But no, the crack widened. A hand must have been pushing the door very cautiously, and now, even in the darkness, I could make out a human shadow. Spellbound, I stared at it. Then through the crack a woman’s voice asked timidly:"

"Die tiefe Schwingung in seiner Stimme berührte mich. Mit einmal fühlte ich ein leises Brennen in der Brust, jenen wohlbekannten Druck, als ob das Herz sich erweiterte oder spannte; ich spürte, wie die Erinnerung an die verzweifelte Verlassenheit jenes unglücklichen Kindes das Mitleid in mir neuerdings erweckte. Gleich, wußte ich, würde dieses Quellen und Strömen beginnen, dem ich nicht zu wehren vermochte. Aber – nicht nachgeben! sagte ich mir. Nicht dich wieder hineinziehen, nicht dich zurückziehen lassen! So blickte ich entschlossen auf.","The deep vibration in his voice touched me. Suddenly I felt a faint burning in my chest, that well-known pressure as if the heart were expanding or tensing; I felt the memory of that unfortunate child's despairing abandonment awaken my pity anew. Soon, I knew, this welling and streaming would begin, which I couldn't resist. But - don't give in! I said to myself. Don't pull you back in, don't let you pull back! So I looked up determinedly.","The deeply felt emotion in his voice touched me. All of a sudden I felt a slight burning sensation inside me, that familiar pressure as if my heart were expanding. I felt the memory of that unhappy child’s desperate loneliness awakening my pity again. And now, I knew, that torrent of feeling would well up in me again, and there was nothing I could do about it. But no, I told myself, don’t give way! Don’t let yourself be dragged into all that again! I looked up with determination.","The deep, vibrant tone in his voice moved me. I felt a faint burning in my breast, that familiar pressure, as though the heart were expanding or being distended; I could feel the pity welling up within me once more at the thought of the desperate plight of the unfortunate child. In a moment, I knew, that turbulent emotion against which I was powerless would surge up within me. But — don’t give in, I said to myself. Don’t let yourself be caught up in it, be dragged back into it again. And so I looked up resolutely."
"Doch sofort erinnerte ich mich meiner Mission. Nein, erklärte ich eifrig, ich müsse morgen besonders früh meinen Dienst antreten, ich hätte mich ohnehin schon längst empfehlen wollen.","But immediately I remembered my mission. No, I explained eagerly, I had to start work very early tomorrow, I would have wanted to recommend myself long ago anyway.","But at once I remembered my mission. No, I said firmly, I had to be on duty early next morning, and had been thinking of leaving for some time.","Immediately, however, I remembered my mission. No, I declared eagerly, I had to be on duty particularly early next morning, and I ought in any case to have left long since."
"Ich vermochte nicht länger, an mich zu halten. »Nein, im Gegenteil, Sie müssen es ihr ausreden, unbedingt ausreden.

Sie müssen ihr das erklären … Sie müssen ihr das rechtzeitig ausreden. Es ist doch nur ein Zufall, daß ich es bin, daß ich es war, der da kam, und nicht ein anderer, ein besserer von meinen Kameraden.

It's madness on her part, a fever, a childish quirk... nothing but the usual fledgling enthusiasm for the uniform, and if someone else comes tomorrow, it'll be the other one. You have to explain that to her... You have to talk her out of it in time. It's just a coincidence that it's me, that it was me who came, and not another, a better one of my comrades. That sort of thing goes by very quickly at her age…”","I couldn’t restrain myself any longer. “Well, now it’s quite the opposite. You must talk her out of it, you really must talk her out of it. It’s nothing but delusion on her part, a fever, a childish fancy … the usual crush adolescent girls get on a uniform, and if another military man turns up tomorrow she’ll transfer her crush to him. You must explain that to her … you must set the record straight at once.

Such things wear off quickly at her age …”","I was unable to contain myself any longer. ‘Well, you must disillusion her, without fail. It’s madness on her part, a fever, a childish whim ... nothing but the usual teenage infatuation for a uniform, and if another officer were to turn up tomorrow, it would be transferred to him. You must explain that to her ... you must disillusion her while there’s still time. It’s only by chance that I came along, and not another of my fellow-officers, a better man.

"»Ja, gut auch für mich«, fuhr Condor fort, »sonst müßte ich viel öfter hinaus, um sie in ihrem nervösen Zustand aufzurichten. Da bedeutet’s mir eine große Entlastung, daß gerade in dieser letzten Woche, ehe sie zur Erholung in die Schweiz fährt, Leutnant Hofmiller bei ihr ein bißchen aufpaßt. Man hat’s mit ihr nicht immer leicht, aber er nimmt sich der Armen wirklich wunderbar an, ich weiß, er läßt mich nicht im Stich.

It's not always easy with her, but he takes care of the poor really wonderfully, I know he won't let me down. I can rely on him better than on my assistants and colleagues.«","“Yes, and he’s kind to me as well,” Condor went on. “Otherwise, considering the state of her nerves, I’d have to go out there much more often to cheer her up. It takes a weight off my mind to know that in this last week before she goes to convalesce in Switzerland, Lieutenant Hofmiller will keep an eye on her. She doesn’t always give other people an easy time, but he’s really wonderful with the poor girl, and I know he won’t let me down. I can rely on him more than I do on any medical assistant or colleague.”","‘Yes, and good for me too,’ Condor went on. ‘Otherwise I should have to go there far more often myself, to keep up her spirits. It’s a great relief to me to know that Lieutenant Hofmiller is going to keep an eye on her during this last week before she goes off to Switzerland. She’s not always easy to deal with, but he’s amazingly clever with her, and I know he won’t let me down. I can rely on him more than on all my assistants and colleagues.’"
"Allerdings, dieser Beglückung war auch eine gewisse Bestürzung verschwistert, denn sie offenbarte mir neuerdings, wie stumpf und lässig bisher meine Anteilnahme gewesen. Wie hatte ich Wochen und Wochen in diesem Haus verkehren können, ohne die natürlichste, die selbstverständlichste Frage zu fragen: wird diese Arme dauernd gelähmt bleiben? Kann die ärztliche Kunst nicht eine Heilung finden für diese Schwächung der Glieder? Unerträgliche Schande: nicht ein einziges Mal hatte ich mich bei Ilona, bei ihrem Vater, bei unserem Regimentsarzt erkundigt; fatalistisch hatte ich die Tatsache des Lahmseins als Faktum hingenommen; wie ein Schuß fuhr darum die Unruhe, die den Vater seit Jahren quälte, in mich hinein. Wie, wenn jener Arzt dieses Kind wirklich von seinen Leiden erlösen könnte! Wenn diese armen gefesselten Beine wieder frei ausschreiten könnten, wenn dies von Gott betrogene Geschöpf einmal wieder hinwehen könnte im Lauf, treppauf, treppab, dem eigenen Lachen nachschwingend, beglückt und beseligt! Wie ein Rausch überfiel mich diese Möglichkeit; lustvoll war es, auszudenken, wie wir dann zu zweit, zu dritt zu Pferd über die Felder sprengen würden, wie sie, statt mich in ihrem Gefängnisraum zu erwarten, schon am Tor mich begrüßen und auf Spaziergängen begleiten könnte. Ungeduldig zählte ich jetzt die Stunden, um jenen fremden Arzt möglichst bald auszukundschaften, ungeduldiger vielleicht als Kekesfalva selbst; keine Aufgabe innerhalb meines eigenen Lebens war mir je so wichtig gewesen.","Admittedly, this happiness was accompanied by a certain dismay, for it had recently revealed to me how dull and casual my sympathy had been. How could I have spent weeks and weeks in this house without asking the most natural, the most obvious question: will this poor person remain permanently paralyzed? Can not medical art find a cure for this weakening of the limbs? Unbearable shame: not once had I asked Ilona, her father, our regimental doctor; I had fatalistically accepted the fact of being lame as a fact; The restlessness that had been tormenting my father for years shot into me like a shot. What if that doctor could really put this child out of his suffering! If these poor, bound legs could stride freely again, if this creature deceived by God could run again, upstairs, downstairs, swinging after its own laughter, happy and blissful! This possibility overcame me like an intoxication; It was fun to think about how two or three of us would then gallop across the fields on horseback, how she could greet me at the gate and accompany me on walks instead of waiting for me in her prison room. I counted the hours impatiently, so as to find out that strange doctor as soon as possible, perhaps more impatiently than Kekesfalva himself; no task in my own life had ever been so important to me.","But this sense of gratification went hand in hand with a certain dismay, for it showed me once again how shallow and casual my sympathy had been so far. How could I have visited this house for weeks on end without asking the most natural and obvious question of all—will that poor girl be crippled for life? Could the art of medicine not find a way to cure her disabled limbs? I felt dreadfully ashamed of myself; not once had I asked Ilona, Edith’s father, or our regimental doctor that question. I had fatalistically accepted her paralysis as a fact, and the anxiety that had haunted her father for years now struck me with the force of a bullet. Suppose this doctor of his could really cure the child of her malady? Suppose those pathetic, helpless legs could stride out freely again, suppose that poor creature, abandoned by God, could run about easily once more, upstairs, downstairs, to the sound of her own happy laughter! The idea was intoxicating; it was delightful to imagine the two of us, or three of us, riding out together over the fields, to see her welcoming me at the door of the house instead of waiting for me in the room where she was a prisoner, to think of her going for walks with me. I was impatiently counting the hours until I could find out her chances from the doctor I had never met, counting them even more impatiently, perhaps, than Kekesfalva himself. Nothing in my own life had ever been so important to me.","A certain consternation, it was true, was mingled with my gratification, for I once more realized how unimaginative and passive my sympathy had been until now. How could I have been a constant visitor to this house, week in, week out, without ever having asked the most natural of all questions : is this poor girl always going to be a cripple? Cannot medical science find some cure for this condition of the limbs? It was quite disgraceful of me — not once had I inquired of Ilona, of Edith’s father, of our regimental doctor; I had accepted her infirmity quite fatalistically as a fact. Now, therefore, the anxiety that had tormented her father for years was like a knife at my heart. What if the doctor really could release this child from her sufferings? What if those poor fettered limbs should be able to stride out freely once more, if this creature whom God had forsaken should once more be able to dance, to leap, to soar, blissfully and joyfully, in the wake of her own laughter? The very thought intoxicated me; it was delightful to imagine how the two of us, the three of us, would gallop across the fields on horseback; how instead of waiting, a prisoner in her room, for my arrival, she would be at the door to greet me, and be for ever happy and carefree. Impatiently I counted the hours, more impatiently perhaps than Kekesfalva himself, until I could ply the strange doctor with questions; no decisive moment in my own life had ever been of such importance to me."
"Ich begann zu zittern und schob hastig die Hand vor mein Gesicht, um wenigstens im Dunkel geschützt zu sein. Nicht eine Schwingung hörte ich mehr von der geliebten Musik, mein Herz hämmerte zu heftig. Die Nähe dieses Menschen, des einzigen auf Erden, der wahrhaft um mich wußte, erdrückte mich. Als säße ich splitternackt im Dunkel unter all den wohlgekleideten und wohlanständigen Menschen, schauerte ich jetzt schon vor dem Augenblick, da die aufflammende Beleuchtung mich offenbaren mußte. Und so drückte ich in dem kurzen Intervall zwischen dunkel und hell, während über den ersten Akt der Vorhang zu sinken begann, rasch den Kopf nieder und flüchtete durch den Mittelgang – ich glaube, rasch genug, daß er mich nicht sehen, nicht erkennen konnte. Aber seit jener Stunde weiß ich neuerdings: keine Schuld ist vergessen, solange noch das Gewissen um sie weiß.","I began to tremble and hastily put my hand in front of my face to at least be protected in the dark. I didn't hear a single vibration from the music I loved, my heart was pounding too hard. The closeness of this person, the only one on earth who really knew about me, crushed me. As if I were sitting stark naked in the dark among all the well-dressed and respectable people, I dreaded the moment when the blazing light would reveal me. And so, in the short interval between dark and light, while the curtain began to fall over the first act, I quickly ducked my head and fled down the aisle -- quickly enough, I think, that he couldn't see me, couldn't recognize me. But since that hour I have known again: no guilt is forgotten as long as the conscience knows about it.","I began trembling, and quickly put my hand up to shelter my face, so that I would be safe at least in the dark. My heart was hammering so hard that I did not hear another bar of the music I loved so much. The proximity of this man, the only person on earth who really knew me for what I was, troubled me deeply. As if I were sitting stark naked in the middle of all these prosperous, well-dressed people, I was already shuddering at the thought of the moment when the lights would go up and reveal me. And so in the brief moment between darkness and light in the auditorium, while the curtain began to fall on the first act, I quickly ducked my head and made my escape up the central gangway —I think quickly enough for him not to see or recognise me. But since that hour I have known that no guilt is forgotten while the conscience still remembers it.","I began to tremble, and hurriedly put my hand up to my face to be at least safe from discovery in the darkness. Not a bar more did I hear of the beloved music, so violently was my heart pounding. The proximity of this individual, the only man who really knew me, appalled me. As though I were sitting stark naked in the dark among all those well-dressed, respectable people, I shuddered at the thought of the moment when the blaze of light would reveal me. And so in the short space of time before the lights came on, and while the curtain was just falling on the first act, I hurriedly ducked my head and fled up the gangway — quickly enough, I think, for him not to see or recognize me. But ever since that moment I have realized afresh that no guilt is forgotten so long as the conscience still knows of it."
"Offenbar um jedes weitere Kommen der Kellnerin auszuschalten, bestellte Condor unverzüglich einen Doppelliter hellen Weins, bezahlte ihn sofort und warf dem Mädchen ein so kräftiges Trinkgeld hin, daß es mit einem dankbaren »Wohl bekomm’s« für immer verschwand. Die Portiere sank nieder, und nur ganz undeutlich klatschten ab und zu von den Mitteltischen ein paar laute Worte oder ein Lachen herüber. Wir waren in unserer Zelle völlig abgedichtet und gesichert.","Apparently to avoid any further coming from the waitress, Condor immediately ordered a double liter of light wine, paid for it immediately and threw the girl such a large tip that she disappeared forever with a grateful ""Get well.""

We were completely sealed and secured in our cell.","Obviously to avoid any further intrusion by the waitress, Condor immediately ordered two litres of white wine, paid for them at once, and gave the girl such a generous tip that she disappeared with a grateful, “Your good health, sir!” The curtain was drawn down, and after that all we could hear, and then only very indistinctly, was a few loud words or a laugh from the tables in the middle of the room. We were secure in our cell, and could not be overheard.","Evidently in order to prevent the waitress from bothering us again, Condor immediately ordered two litres of white wine, paid for it on the spot and tossed the girl such an enormous tip that she disappeared for good with a grateful ‘Your very good health, sir!’ The curtain fell, and it was only indistinctly that from time to time we caught the sound of a laugh or a few words from the tables in the middle of the room. We were completely sealed up and secure in our little cell."
"Mit schlimmer Vorahnung springe ich auf. Immer kam ja in den letzten Wochen von Telephon, Telegrammen und Briefen nur Nervenriß und Verstörung. Was will sie schon wieder? Wahrscheinlich tut’s ihr leid, mich für heute nachmittag freigegeben zu haben. Nun, wenn sie’s reut, dann geht alles glatt. Jedenfalls ziehe ich die gepolsterte Tür der Telephonkabine luftdicht hinter mir zu, als kappte ich damit jeden Kontakt zwischen meiner dienstlichen Sphäre und jener andern vollkommen ab. Es ist Ilona.","I jump up with bad foreboding. In the past few weeks, the only thing that has come from telephones, telegrams, and letters has always been irritation and confusion. What does she want again? She's probably sorry for letting me off for this afternoon. Well, if she regrets it, then everything will be fine. In any case, I pull the padded telephone booth door shut behind me so that it is airtight, as if thereby completely cutting off all contact between my official sphere and the rest of the world. It's Ilona.","I jump up with dark forebodings. Over these last few weeks telephone calls, telegrams and letters have brought me nothing but bad news and ensuing distress. What does she want now? I wonder. I expect she’s sorry she gave me this afternoon off. Well, if she’s regretting it, then everything is going smoothly. But anyway, I close the soundproofed door of the telephone kiosk behind me, as if that would cut off any contact between my military and private worlds. It’s Ilona’s voice that I hear.","I jumped up with an uneasy presentiment. During the last few weeks telephone calls, telegrams and letters had meant nothing but endless trouble and nervous worry. What did she want this time? Probably she was regretting that she had given me an afternoon of freedom. Well, if that was so, all the better; it meant everything was smoothed over. At any rate I slammed the padded door of the telephone booth as firmly behind me as though I were completely cutting off all contact between my two worlds. Ilona was at the other end."
"»Einen bestimmten Termin … natürlich, den kann kein Arzt von vornherein festlegen, ich glaube nicht, daß man den schon bestimmen kann … übrigens … Herr Doktor Condor hat nur so im allgemeinen über die Methode gesprochen … Sie soll angeblich ganz ausgezeichnete Resultate erzielen, hat er gesagt, aber ob sie völlig verläßlich ist … ich meine, das kann man doch nur von Fall zu Fall ausproben … man muß jedenfalls abwarten, bis er …«","""A specific date... of course, no doctor can fix that in advance, I don't think it can be fixed... by the way...

Can you understand?'","“But the voice beside him asked, very anxiously, ‘Is this the right paper? Can you understand what it says?’",But the voice at his side was asking in anxious tones: ‘Is it the right document? Can you understand it?’
"Aber nun weißt Du, was Du nie hättest wissen sollen, ehe ich nicht wirklich auferstanden war, und weißt auch, für wen ich geheilt sein will, für wen allein auf Erden – nur für Dich! Nur für Dich! Verzeih mir, unendlich Geliebter, diese Liebe, und um dies eine vor allem flehe ich Dich an – fürchte Dich nicht und entsetze Dich nicht vor mir! Glaub nicht, daß weil ich einmal zudringlich gewesen, ich Dich weiter verstören werde, daß ich, hinfällig und mir selbst widrig, wie ich bin, Dich schon halten will. Nein, ich schwör es Dir – kein Drängen sollst Du jemals von mir spüren, ganz unfühlbar will ich bleiben für Dich. Nur warten will ich, geduldig warten, bis Gott sich meiner erbarmt und mich gesund macht. So bitte, so flehe ich Dich an – fürchte Dich nicht, Liebster, vor meiner Liebe, bedenk doch, Du, der Du Mitleid hattest wie kein anderer mit mir, bedenk, wie gräßlich hilflos ich bin, angenagelt an meinen Sessel, unfähig, einen eigenen Schritt zu tun, unmächtig, Dir nachzugehen, Dir entgegenzueilen. Bedenk doch, bedenk, daß ich eine Gefangene bin, die in ihrem Kerker warten muß, immer geduldig-ungeduldig warten, bis Du kommst und mir eine Stunde schenkst, bis Du mir erlaubst, Dich anzublicken, Deine Stimme zu hören, im selben Raum Deinen Atem zu spüren, Deine Gegenwart zu fühlen, dies einzige, dies erste Glück, das mir seit Jahren gegönnt war. Bedenk’s doch, denk Dir’s aus: da liegt man und liegt und wartet Tag und Nacht, und jede Stunde dehnt sich, man kann die Spannung kaum ertragen. Und dann kommst Du, und ich vermag nicht wie eine andere aufzuspringen, ich kann Dir nicht entgegenlaufen, nicht Dich umfassen, nicht Dich halten. Man muß sitzen und sich bezähmen, sich dämmen und sich verschweigen, muß auf jedes Wort, auf jeden Blick, auf jede Schwingung der Stimme achten, nur daß Du nicht meinen könntest, ich maße mir an, Dich zu lieben. Aber doch, glaub mir, Geliebter, auch dies martervolle Glück war für mich immer noch Glück, und ich lobte, ich liebte mich jedesmal, wenn es mir noch einmal gelungen war, mich zu verhalten, und Du gingst weg, ahnungslos, frei und unbeschwert, unwissend um meine Liebe; einzig mir blieb dann die Qual, zu wissen, wie rettungslos ich Dir verfallen bin.","But now you know what you should never have known before I was actually risen, and you also know for whom I want to be healed, for whom alone on earth - only for you! Only for you! Forgive me, infinitely beloved, this love, and I beg you for this one thing above all – do not be afraid and do not be terrified of me! Don't think that because I've been importunate once, I'll continue to disturb you, that, frail and self-defeating as I am, I want to keep you. No, I swear to you - you should never feel any pressure from me, I want to remain completely impalpable for you. I just want to wait, wait patiently, until God takes pity on me and makes me whole. So beg, so I beg you - do not fear, dearest, of my love, consider, you who had pity on me like no other, consider how horribly helpless I am, nailed to my chair, unable to to take your own step, powerless to follow you, to hasten towards you. Just consider, consider that I am a prisoner who has to wait in my dungeon, always waiting impatiently, until you come and give me an hour, until you allow me to look at you, to hear your voice, yours in the same room To feel your breath, to feel your presence, this only, this first happiness that I have been granted for years. Just think about it, think it up: there you lie and lie and wait day and night, and every hour stretches, you can hardly bear the tension. And then you come and I can't jump up like someone else, I can't run towards you, I can't embrace you, I can't hold you. One has to sit and control oneself, contain oneself and keep silent, one has to pay attention to every word, to every look, to every vibration of the voice, just so you can't think I'm presuming to love you. But believe me, my love, even this torturous happiness was still happiness for me, and I praised, I loved myself every time I managed to behave myself, and you went away, unsuspecting, free and carefree ignorant of my love; I was the only one left with the torment of knowing how helplessly I've fallen for you.","But now you know what you ought never to have known until I was really better again, and you also know for whose sake I want to be cured, for just one person on earth—for you, only for you! Forgive me, my very dearly beloved, for this love, and I will ask you just one thing—don’t be afraid, do not feel horror of me! Don’t think that because I once made advances I will ever trouble you again, or that frail and repellent to myself as I am, I will try to cling to you. No, I swear it— you will never hear anything like that from me again, I won’t show you my feelings. I will just wait, wait patiently for God to take pity on me and make me better.

I have to sit and tame my feelings, dam it all up and keep quiet, I have to guard every word I say, every glance, every note in my voice just so that you couldn’t think I am being bold enough to love you. But believe me, beloved, even that happy torture has always meant happiness to me, and I praised myself and liked myself better every time I managed to control myself and you went away, guessing nothing, free and easy in your mind, knowing nothing about my love. The pain was all mine—the pain of knowing how hopelessly in love with you I was.","‘But now you know what you ought never to have known until I was literally on my feet, and know too for whom it is I want to be cured, for whom alone on this earth — for you alone!

Do not think that because I have once been importunate I shall trouble you again, that I, infirm and abhorrent to myself as I am, will try to hold you. No, I swear to you — you shall never find me forcing myself upon you, I shall try to hide my feelings from you. I only want to wait, wait patiently, until God takes pity on me and makes me well.

Remember that I am a prisoner who has to wait in my prison, to wait always in impatient patience, until you come and bestow an hour of your time upon me, until you permit me to look at you, to hear your voice, to know we are breathing the same air, to feel your presence, the first and only happiness that has been granted to me for years. Remember it, picture it to yourself: there I lie and go on lying, waiting, waiting, day and night; and every hour stretches out endlessly until the tension is unbearable. And then you come, and I cannot jump up like another woman, cannot go to meet you, cannot seize you, cannot hold you. I have to sit and control myself, master my feelings and keep silent, have to keep a watch upon my every word, my every look, every tone of my voice, so that you shall not think that I presume to love you. And yet believe me, beloved, even this agonizing happiness has nevertheless been happiness, and I have praised myself, loved myself every time I have succeeded in restraining myself, and you have gone away, unsuspecting, free and untrammelled, knowing nothing of my love. My only torture then has been the realization of how hopelessly I have fallen under your spell."
"»Um so besser. Das beruhigt mich einigermaßen. Nun, als Arzt hat man oft Gelegenheit, derartige psychische Hemmungen bei den scheinbar Normalsten zu beobachten. Freilich – verstanden habe ich die Männer nie, bei denen die kleinste Unregelmäßigkeit bei einer Frau eine Art Idiosynkrasie erzeugt, aber es gibt eben unzählige Männer, bei denen sich, sobald von den Millionen und Milliarden Zellen, die einen Körper, einen Menschen formen, nur ein Fingerbreit Pigment entstellt ist, sofort jede Möglichkeit einer erotischen Bindung ausschaltet. Solche Repulsionen sind wie alle Instinkte leider immer unüberwindlich – darum bin ich doppelt froh, daß dies bei Ihnen nicht zutrifft, daß es also keinesfalls das Faktum ihrer Lahmheit ist, das Sie derart zurückschrecken läßt. Dann allerdings kann ich nur annehmen, daß … darf ich aufrichtig reden?«","""All the better. That calms me down a bit. Well, as a doctor, one often has the opportunity to observe such psychological inhibitions in the apparently most normal. Of course – I have never understood the men in whom the slightest irregularity in a woman creates a kind of idiosyncrasy, but there are countless men in whom, as soon as one of the millions and billions of cells that form a body, a human being, only a finger's breadth of pigment is disfigured immediately eliminates any possibility of erotic bonding. Such repulsions, like all instincts, are unfortunately always insurmountable - so I am doubly glad that this is not the case with you, that it is by no means the fact of your lameness that makes you recoil in such a way. In that case, however, I can only assume that … may I speak sincerely?”","“Good. That does to some extent reassure me. A doctor often has opportunities to observe that kind of psychological inhibition in those who appear the most normal of human beings. To be sure, I’ve never been able to understand men in whom the smallest flaw in a woman’s appearance engenders that idiosyncratic state of mind, but there are countless men who do feel that when, out of all the millions upon millions of cells that make up a human body, the smallest detail, say of pigmentation, is not quite right, it immediately rules out any possibility of an erotic relationship. And unfortunately it is always impossible to overcome such revulsion; that’s the case with all instincts. So I am doubly glad that you are not one of those men, and it is not because she is lame that you shrink from her. However, then I can only assume that … may I speak plainly?”","‘So much the better. That reassures me to some extent. As a doctor, you see, one has plenty of opportunity of observing such psychological inhibitions in the case of apparently completely normal people. I must admit I have never been able to understand those men in whom the slightest physical abnormality in a woman produces a kind of pathological aversion, but there are a great many men for whom the slightest aberration in a single one of the millions and millions of cells that go to make up a body, a human being, immediately excludes all possibility of a sexual relationship. Unfortunately such aversions, like all the instincts, can never be got over — and that is why I am doubly glad to hear that in your case it is not the fact of her lameness in itself that repels you. In that case, to be sure, I can only assume that ... may I speak frankly?’"

"Er machte wieder die zwei Schritte zum Lichtschalter, die Glühbirnen flammten auf. Da er sich jetzt mir zuwandte, schien mir sein Gesicht anders; vielleicht modellierte nur der grelle Schein so scharf die Konturen heraus, denn zum erstenmal bemerkte ich die tiefen Falten auf seiner Stirn, und an seiner ganzen Haltung, wie müde, wie erschöpft dieser Mann war. Er hat sich immer an andere weggegeben, dachte ich. Erbärmlich schien mir mit einmal mein Flüchtenwollen vor der ersten Unannehmlichkeit, und ich blickte ihn mit dankbarer Erregung an.","He took the two steps to the light switch again, the bulbs came on.

That's not a promenade step, but rather a rush - at least according to the pretty bird, no matter how fast it may flutter!","Of course—even if I hadn’t admired her dark red dress and broad-brimmed panama hat with the ribbon around it only the day before yesterday, I’d have recognised her from behind by the graceful way she sways from the waist as she walks. But where is she going in such haste? She’s not strolling along like a girl out to join the others on the promenade, she is in a hurry—I must go after the pretty bird, however fast she flutters!","Even had I not, only the day before yesterday, admired the wine-red dress and the panama trimmed with the broad ribbon, I should have recognized her from behind by the supple swaying of her hips as she walked. But where was she off to in such a hurry? This was not walking, it was racing. In any case, I must follow the pretty bird, however swiftly it might wing its way."
"Jozsi sekundiert sofort. »Nur mit der Kameradschaft, da steht’s halt schwach bei ihm. Ja, mein lieber Toni, statt daß du draußen deinem Alten einmal sagen tätst: ›Du, Alter, ich hab’ da ein paar fesche Kameraden, bildsaubere, brave Kerle, die auch nicht mit dem Messer fressen, die luchs ich euch einmal her’ – statt dem denkt er sich: sollen nur ihr saures Pilsner saufen und sich die Gurgel mit ihrem öden Rindsgulasch auspaprizieren! Ja, piekfeine Kameradschaft, das muß ich schon sagen! Alles für sich und nix für die andern! Na – hast mir wenigstens eine dicke Upman mitgebracht? Dann bist du für heut noch pardoniert.«","Jozsi seconded immediately. ""Only the camaraderie, that's where it's weak for him. Yes, my dear Toni, instead of saying to your old man outside: 'You, old man, I've got a couple of handsome comrades here, clean, good fellows who don't eat with knives either, I'll get them for you' – instead he thinks to himself: just drink your sour Pilsner and dry your throat with your boring beef goulash! Yes, posh camaraderie, I must say! Everything for yourself and nothing for the others! Well - at least you brought me a big Upman? Then you're pardoned for today.""","Joszi joins in at once. “A little short on good comradeship, though, our Toni. Yes, Toni, I suppose you don’t think of telling the old boy up there, ‘Hey, old fellow, I have a couple of good friends, smartly turned out, splendid chaps, they don’t eat with their knives, why don’t I bring them along?’ No, not he, let the rest of ’em drink sour Pilsner and eat the same old beef goulash! A fine sort of friend he is, I must say! All for him, nothing for the rest of us! Did you at least bring back a nice fat Upmann cigar? If so you’re forgiven, for now.”","Jozsi at once backed him up. ‘The only thing is, he’s a poor sort of pal! Yes, my dear Toni, instead of saying to your old buffer out there, “See here, old boy, I have a couple of smart friends, frightfully decent, jolly fine fellows, don’t eat with their knives either , I’ll bring ’em along some time” — instead of that, he thinks to himself, Let ’em go on swilling their filthy Pilsner and peppering their throats to a frazzle with their wretched goulasch! Jolly way of behaving, I must say! Everything for himself and damn-all for the others! Oh well, I suppose you’ve at least brought me a nice fat Upmann. In that case, you’re let off for today.’"
"Kanitz entwickelte sofort wilden Eifer. Er bestellte beim Oberkellner das Kursbuch, durchsuchte das Register, stellte alle Verbindungen zusammen. Schnellzug Wien–Frankfurt–Köln, dann umsteigen in Osnabrück. Am bequemsten der Morgenzug neun Uhr zwanzig, der sei abends in Frankfurt, dort rate er ihr, zu übernachten, um sich nicht zu übermüden. In seinem nervösen Eifer blätterte er gleich weiter und fand im Inseratenverzeichnis ein protestantisches Hospiz. Wegen der Fahrkarte brauche sie sich keine Sorgen zu machen, die besorge er, und zuverlässig werde er sie auch morgen an die Bahn begleiten. Mit derlei Erörterungen verging die Zeit schneller, als er gehofft hatte; endlich konnte er auf die Uhr sehen und drängen: ›Nun müssen wir aber zum Notar.‹","Kanitz immediately developed wild enthusiasm. He ordered the course book from the head waiter, looked through the register, put together all the connections. Express train Vienna-Frankfurt-Cologne, then change in Osnabrück. The most convenient is the nine-twenty morning train, which is in Frankfurt in the evening, and he advises her to spend the night there so as not to overtire herself. In his nervous zeal he flipped through the pages and found a Protestant hospice in the advertisements. She needn't worry about the ticket, he'll take care of it, and he'll be sure to accompany her to the train station tomorrow as well. With such discussions, time passed more quickly than he had hoped; Finally he was able to look at his watch and urge: 'Now we have to go to the notary.'","“Kanitz immediately showed great enthusiasm. He told the head waiter to bring the railway timetable, looked through it and worked out all the connections. The express from Vienna through Frankfurt to Cologne, then change trains in Osnabrück. The most convenient train, he said, would be the nine-twenty express in the morning. By evening, that would get her to Frankfurt, where he advised her to spend the night so as not to tire herself too much. In his nervous enthusiasm he leafed on, and found an advertisement for a Protestant hostel where she could stay. She needn’t worry about buying her ticket, he said, he would do that, and he would be there without fail in the morning to take her to the station. Such discussion passed the time more quickly than he had expected, and at last he could look at his watch and say, ‘But now we must be off to the notary’s office.’","Kanitz immediately displayed tremendous zeal. He asked the waiter for the time-table, looked through the index, worked out all the connections. Express Vienna-Frankfurt-Cologne, change at Osnabrück. It would be best to take the nine-twenty, which arrived in Frankfurt in the evening, he said; he would advise her to spend the night there, so as not to get too tired. In his restless eagerness he went on turning over the pages and found an advertisement of a Protestant hostel. She need not bother about the ticket, he would see to that, and would also be sure to see her off in the morning. In the discussion of such little matters the time passed more quickly than he had hoped; and now at last he could look at the clock and remark: ‘ I say, we must be off to the notary’s now!’"
"Dieses Wort »Freund«, das mir dieser Mann in dieser Stunde gab, bewegte mich. Er wußte, wie schwach, wie feig ich gewesen, und doch, er verachtete mich nicht. Mit diesem einen Wort schenkte er mir, der Ältere dem Jüngeren, der Erfahrene dem unsicher Beginnenden, wieder Zuversicht. Entlastet und leicht folgte ich ihm.","This word ""friend"" that this man gave me in this hour moved me. He knew how weak, how cowardly I had been, and yet he did not despise me.

I followed him, feeling light at heart and with my mind at rest.","The warmth in his voice as he called me ‘my dear friend’ moved me profoundly. He knew how weak, how cowardly I had been, and yet he did not despise me. He was an older man, a man of experience, I a mere youngster, a blundering beginner, and with those words he gave me back my confidence. A load fell from my mind, and I followed him with a light heart."

Der alte Mann schöpft Atem wie vor einer großen Anstrengung. Dann stößt er endlich heraus »›Er … er hat ja doch nichts als Mitleid für mich.‹«,"The old man catches his breath as if before a great effort. Then he finally blurts out, ""'He... he has nothing but pity for me.'""","The old man takes a deep breath as you might before making an enormous effort. Then finally he comes out with it. “‘Because he … he feels nothing but pity for me,’ that’s what she said.”",The old man drew a deep breath as though preparing for some great effort.
