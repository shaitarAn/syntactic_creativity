"»Herr Samsa!« rief der mittlere Herr dem Vater zu und zeigte, ohne ein weiteres Wort zu verlieren, mit dem Zeigefinger auf den langsam sich vorwärtsbewegenden Gregor. Die Violine verstummte, der mittlere Zimmerherr lächelte erst einmal kopfschüttelnd seinen Freunden zu und sah dann wieder auf Gregor hin. Der Vater schien es für nötiger zu halten, statt Gregor zu vertreiben, vorerst die Zimmerherren zu beruhigen, trotzdem diese gar nicht aufgeregt waren und Gregor sie mehr als das Violinspiel zu unterhalten schien. Er eilte zu ihnen und suchte sie mit ausgebreiteten Armen in ihr Zimmer zu drängen und gleichzeitig mit seinem Körper ihnen den Ausblick auf Gregor zu nehmen. Sie wurden nun tatsächlich ein wenig böse, man wußte nicht mehr, ob über das Benehmen des Vaters oder über die ihnen jetzt aufgehende Erkenntnis, ohne es zu wissen, einen solchen Zimmernachbar wie Gregor besessen zu haben. Sie verlangten vom Vater Erklärungen, hoben ihrerseits die Arme, zupften unruhig an ihren Bärten und wichen nur langsam gegen ihr Zimmer zurück. Inzwischen hatte die Schwester die Verlorenheit, in die sie nach dem plötzlich abgebrochenen Spiel verfallen war, überwunden, hatte sich, nachdem sie eine Zeitlang in den lässig hängenden Händen Violine und Bogen gehalten und weiter, als spiele sie noch, in die Noten gesehen hatte, mit einem Male aufgerafft, hatte das Instrument auf den Schoß der Mutter gelegt, die in Atembeschwerden mit heftig arbeitenden Lungen noch auf ihrem Sessel saß, und war in das Nebenzimmer gelaufen, dem sich die Zimmerherren unter dem Drängen des Vaters schon schneller näherten. Man sah, wie unter den geübten Händen der Schwester die Decken und Polster in den Betten in die Höhe flogen und sich ordneten. Noch ehe die Herren das Zimmer erreicht hatten, war sie mit dem Aufbetten fertig und schlüpfte heraus. Der Vater schien wieder von seinem Eigensinn derartig ergriffen, daß er jeden Respekt vergaß, den er seinen Mietern immerhin schuldete. Er drängte nur und drängte, bis schon in der Tür des Zimmers der mittlere der Herren donnernd mit dem Fuß aufstampfte und dadurch den Vater zum Stehen brachte. »Ich erkläre hiermit,« sagte er, hob die Hand und suchte mit den Blicken auch die Mutter und die Schwester, »daß ich mit Rücksicht auf die in dieser Wohnung und Familie herrschenden widerlichen Verhältnisse« – hierbei spie er kurz entschlossen auf den Boden – »mein Zimmer augenblicklich kündige. Ich werde natürlich auch für die Tage, die ich hier gewohnt habe, nicht das Geringste bezahlen, dagegen werde ich es mir noch überlegen, ob ich nicht mit irgendwelchen – glauben Sie mir – sehr leicht zu begründenden Forderungen gegen Sie auftreten werde.« Er schwieg und sah gerade vor sich hin, als erwarte er etwas. Tatsächlich fielen sofort seine zwei Freunde mit den Worten ein: »Auch wir kündigen augenblicklich.« Darauf faßte er die Türklinke und schloß mit einem Krach die Tür.","""Herr Samsa!"" called the man in the middle to his father and, without wasting another word, pointed with his index finger at Gregor, who was slowly moving forward. The violin fell silent, the roomer in the middle first smiled at his friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor. Father seemed to think it more necessary, instead of driving Gregor away, to calm the landlords first, although they weren't at all upset and Gregor seemed to entertain them more than playing the violin. He rushed to them and tried to push them into their room with outstretched arms and at the same time to block their view of Gregor with his body. They actually got a little angry now, one no longer knew whether it was because of their father's behavior or because they now realized, without knowing it, that they had had such a roommate as Gregor. They demanded explanations from their father, raised their arms themselves, tugged uneasily at their beards and only slowly retreated towards their room. In the meantime, the sister had overcome the forlornness into which she had fallen after the game had suddenly stopped. After she had held the violin and bow in her casually hanging hands for a while and continued to look at the notes as if she were still playing, suddenly snatched up, put the instrument on the mother's lap, who was still sitting in her chair with breathing difficulties and her lungs working violently, and ran into the next room, which the landlords were approaching more quickly under the father's urging. You could see how, under the nurse's practiced hands, the blankets and pillows in the beds flew up and tidied themselves up. Before the gentlemen had even reached the room, she had finished making the bed and slipped out. The father seemed so taken by his stubbornness again that he forgot any respect he owed his tenants. He just pushed and pushed, until the man in the middle stomped his foot in the door of the room, bringing his father to a standstill. ""I hereby declare,"" he said, raising his hand and also looking at his mother and sister, ""that out of consideration for the disgusting conditions prevailing in this apartment and family"" - at which point he spat on the floor - 'I am giving notice of my room immediately. Of course, I won't pay anything for the days I've lived here, but I'll still think about making some - believe me - very easily substantiated claims against you.' He said nothing and looked straight ahead as if expecting something. In fact, his two friends immediately jumped in with the words: ""We're also giving notice immediately."" He then grabbed the door handle and closed the door with a bang.","“Herr Samsa!” yelled the middle man to the father, and without wasting another word pointed his index finger at Gregor, who was slowly crawling forward. The violin stopped abruptly, and the middle boarder first smiled at his friends, shaking his head, and then looked at Gregor again. Rather than drive Gregor out, the father seemed to consider it more urgent to pacify the boarders, although they were not upset in the least and appeared to be more entertained by Gregor than the violin playing. The father rushed to them and tried to herd them back to their room with his outstretched arms while at the same time blocking their view of Gregor with his body. They now became a bit annoyed, but it was not clear whether the father’s behavior was to blame or whether the realization was dawning on them that they had unwittingly had a neighbor like Gregor. They demanded explanations from the father, they raised their arms at him and nervously yanked their beards, then they very reluctantly backed away toward their room. In the meantime the sister woke up from the bewildered state she had fallen into after the sudden interruption of her music; after she listlessly dangled the violin and bow awhile in her slack hands and gazed at the music as though she were still playing, she pulled herself together, put the instrument in the mother’s lap (the mother was still seated, gasping asthmatically for breath), and ran into the next room, which the boarders were rapidly nearing under the father’s pressure. One could see blankets and pillows fly in the air around the bed and arrange themselves under the sister’s practiced hands. Before the men even reached the room she had finished making the beds and skipped out. Once again the father seemed so overpowered by his own obstinacy that he had forgotten the very least courtesy due his tenants. He just kept pushing and pushing them up to the very door of the room, where the middle boarder brought him to a halt by thunderously stamping down his foot. “I hereby declare,” he said, raising his hand and looking around for the mother and sister, “that in view of the revolting conditions prevailing in this household and family”—here he promptly spat on the floor—“I give immediate notice. Naturally I will not pay a cent for the days I have already spent here; on the contrary I shall seriously consider pursuing some legal claim against you that—believe me—will be quite easy to substantiate.” He stopped and stared directly before him as though awaiting something. Sure enough, his two friends jumped in with the words: “We too give our notice.” Thereupon he grabbed the door handle and banged shut the door.","‘Mr. Samsa,’ called out the middle lodger to the father, and pointed his index finger, without uttering a further word, at Gregor as he was moving slowly forward. The violin fell silent. The middle lodger smiled, first shaking his head once at his friends, and then looked down at Gregor once more. Rather than driving Gregor back again, the father seemed to consider it of prime importance to calm down the lodgers, although they were not at all upset and Gregor seemed to entertain them more than the violin recital. The father hurried over to them and with outstretched arms tried to push them into their own room and simultaneously to block their view of Gregor with his own body. At this point they became really somewhat irritated, although one no longer knew whether that was because of the father’s behaviour or because of knowledge they had just acquired that they had had, without knowing it, a neighbour like Gregor. They demanded explanations from his father, raised their arms to make their points, tugged agitatedly at their beards, and moved back towards their room quite slowly. In the meantime, the isolation which had suddenly fallen upon his sister after the sudden breaking off of the recital had overwhelmed her. She had held onto the violin and bow in her limp hands for a little while and had continued to look at the sheet music as if she was still playing. All at once she pulled herself together, placed the instrument in her mother’s lap (the mother was still sitting in her chair having trouble breathing and with her lungs labouring) and had run into the next room, which the lodgers, pressured by the father, were already approaching more rapidly. One could observe how under the sister’s practiced hands the sheets and pillows on the beds were thrown on high and arranged. Even before the lodgers had reached the room, she was finished fixing the beds and was slipping out. The father seemed so gripped once again with his stubbornness that he forgot about the respect which he always owed to his renters. He pressed on and on, until at the door of the room the middle gentleman stamped loudly with his foot and thus brought the father to a standstill. ‘I hereby declare,’ the middle lodger said, raising his hand and casting his glance both on the mother and the sister, ‘that consider-ing the disgraceful conditions prevailing in this apartment and family,’ with this he spat decisively on the floor, ‘I immediately cancel my room. I will, of course, pay nothing at all for the days which I have lived here; on the contrary I shall think about whether or not I will initiate some sort of action against you, something which—believe me— will be very easy to establish.’ He fell silent and looked directly in front of him, as if he was waiting for something. In fact, his two friends immediately joined in with their opinions, ‘We also give immediate notice.’ At that he seized the door handle, banged the door shut, and locked it.","“Herr Samsa!” the gentleman in the middle shouted at Gregor’s father, and without wasting a single word, pointed his finger at Gregor, who was slowly advancing. The violin fell silent, the middle lodger at first just smiled and shook his head, turning toward his friends, then looked again at Gregor. Gregor’s father apparently found the task of driving Gregor back into his room less urgent than that of calming the lodgers, despite the fact that they did not appear particularly worked up and seemed to be finding Gregor more entertaining than the music. He hurried over to them and tried with outspread arms to herd them back into their room, at the same time using his body to shield Gregor from their view. And now they did in fact become a little angry, though it was no longer clear whether this was on account of Gregor’s father’s behavior or the realization dawning on them that without their knowledge they had been sharing their home with a roommate of this sort. They demanded explanations of Gregor’s father; now it was their turn to throw their arms into the air; they plucked uneasily at their beards and only slowly withdrew in the direction of their room. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister, who had been standing there at a loss since her playing had been so unexpectedly interrupted—she still held violin and bow in her carelessly dangling hands, looking over at the notes as though she were continuing to play—all at once pulled herself together, laid her instrument in the lap of her mother, who still sat there in her armchair, her lungs heaving as she fought for breath, and ran into the next room, toward which the lodgers were now moving somewhat more quickly as Gregor’s father urged them on. One saw how, beneath his sister’s practiced hands, the beds’ blankets and pillows flew into the air and into orderliness. Even before the lodgers reached the room, she had finished making up the beds and slipped out. Gregor’s father appeared to be once more so firmly in the grip of his own stubbornness that he forgot the basic respect that, after all, he owed his tenants. He kept up his pressing and urging until, already standing in the doorway, the middle lodger thunderously stamped his foot, causing Gregor’s father to stop short. “I hereby declare,” he said, raising his hand and seeking out Gregor’s mother and sister too as he glanced about, “that in consideration of the reprehensible circumstances prevailing in this apartment and family”—and here he spat on the floor without forethought—“I give notice on my room effective immediately. It goes without saying that I will not pay a penny for the days I have spent here; on the contrary, I shall consider whether or not to pursue you with—please believe me—easily justifiable claims.” He fell silent and went on looking straight before him expectantly. And indeed his two friends at once chimed in with the words, “We too give notice effective immediately.” Hereupon he seized the door handle and with a great crash slammed the door."
"Dann verließen alle drei gemeinschaftlich die Wohnung, was sie schon seit Monaten nicht getan hatten, und fuhren mit der Elektrischen ins Freie vor die Stadt. Der Wagen, in dem sie allein saßen, war ganz von warmer Sonne durchschienen. Sie besprachen, bequem auf ihren Sitzen zurückgelehnt, die Aussichten für die Zukunft, und es fand sich, daß diese bei näherer Betrachtung durchaus nicht schlecht waren, denn aller drei Anstellungen waren, worüber sie einander eigentlich noch gar nicht ausgefragt hatten, überaus günstig und besonders für später vielversprechend. Die größte augenblickliche Besserung der Lage mußte sich natürlich leicht durch einen Wohnungswechsel ergeben; sie wollten nun eine kleinere und billigere, aber besser gelegene und überhaupt praktischere Wohnung nehmen, als es die jetzige, noch von Gregor ausgesuchte war. Während sie sich so unterhielten, fiel es Herrn und Frau Samsa im Anblick ihrer immer lebhafter werdenden Tochter fast gleichzeitig ein, wie sie in der letzten Zeit trotz aller Pflege, die ihre Wangen bleich gemacht hatte, zu einem schönen und üppigen Mädchen aufgeblüht war. Stiller werdend und fast unbewußt durch Blicke sich verständigend, dachten sie daran, daß es nun Zeit sein werde, auch einen braven Mann für sie zu suchen. Und es war ihnen wie eine Bestätigung ihrer neuen Träume und guten Absichten, als am Ziele ihrer Fahrt die Tochter als erste sich erhob und ihren jungen Körper dehnte.","Then all three of them left the apartment together, which they hadn't done for months, and took the streetcar outside of town. The carriage in which they were sitting alone was completely lit by the warm sun. Leaning back comfortably in their seats, they discussed the prospects for the future, and on closer inspection it turned out that they were not bad at all, for all three jobs, which they had not actually asked each other about, were extremely favorable and special promising for later. The greatest momentary improvement in the situation would of course easily result from a change of residence; They now wanted to take a smaller and cheaper apartment, but one that was better located and generally more practical than the one Gregor had chosen at the moment. As they talked, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa, looking at their daughter, who was becoming more and more lively, almost simultaneously remembered how lately, despite all the care that had made her cheeks pale, she had blossomed into a beautiful and voluptuous girl. Becoming quieter and almost unconsciously communicating by looks, they thought that now it would be time to look for a good husband for them too. And it was like a confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions when, at the end of their journey, their daughter was the first to get up and stretch her young body.","Then all three left the apartment together, which they had not done in months, and took a trolley to the countryside on the outskirts of town. Their trolley car had no other passengers and was flooded with warm sunshine. Leaning back comfortably in their seats, they discussed their prospects for the future and concluded, on closer inspection, that these were not at all bad; for all three had jobs which, although they had never really questioned each other about this, were entirely satisfactory and seemed to be particularly promising. The greatest immediate amelioration of their circumstances would easily come to fruition with a change of residence: They wanted to take some place smaller and less expensive but better situated and more efficiently designed than the apartment they had, which had been Gregor’s choice. It occurred almost simultaneously to both Herr and Frau Samsa, while they were conversing and looking at their increasingly vivacious daughter, that despite the recent sorrows that had paled her cheeks, she had blossomed into a pretty and voluptuous young woman. Growing quieter and almost unconsciously communicating through exchanged glances, they thought it was time to find her a good husband. And it was like a confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions that at their journey’s end their daughter jumped to her feet and stretched her young body.","Then all three left the apartment together, something they had not done for months now, and took the electric tram into the open air outside the city. The car in which they were sitting by themselves was totally engulfed by the warm sun. They talked to each other, leaning back comfortably in their seats, about future prospects, and they discovered that on closer observation these were not at all bad, for all three had employment, about which they had not really questioned each other at all, which was extremely favorable and with especially promising prospects. The greatest improvement in their situation at this moment, of course, had to come from a change of dwelling. Now they wanted to rent an apartment smaller and cheaper but better situated and generally more practical than the present one, which Gregor had found. While they amused themselves in this way, it struck Mr. and Mrs. Samsa almost at the same moment how their daughter, who was getting more animated all the time, had blossomed recently, in spite of all the troubles which had made her cheeks pale, into a beautiful and voluptuous young woman. Growing more silent and almost unconsciously understanding each other in their glances, they thought that the time was now at hand to seek out a good honest man for her. And it was something of a con-firmation of their new dreams and good intentions when at the end of their journey the daughter first lifted herself up and stretched her young body.","Then all three of them left the apartment together, something they had not done for months, and took the electric tram all the way to the open countryside at the edge of town. The car in which they sat all alone was entirely suffused with warm sunlight. Cozily leaning back in their seats, they discussed their future prospects, and on closer investigation it appeared that these prospects were not bad at all, for all three of their positions—something they had never before properly discussed—were in fact quite advantageous and above all offered promising opportunities for advancement. The greatest immediate improvement in their situation, of course, would be easily achieved by moving to a new apartment; they now wished to take a smaller and cheaper but more convenient and above all more practical flat than their current one, which had been picked out for them by Gregor. As they were conversing in this way, Herr and Frau Samsa were struck almost as one while observing their daughter, who was growing ever more vivacious, by the thought that despite all the torments that had made her cheeks grow pale, she had recently blossomed into a beautiful, voluptuous girl. Growing quieter now and communicating with one another almost unconsciously by an exchange of glances, they thought about how it would soon be time to find her a good husband. And when they arrived at their destination, it seemed to them almost a confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions when their daughter swiftly sprang to her feet and stretched her young body."
"Da öffnete sich die Tür des Schlafzimmers, und Herr Samsa erschien in seiner Livree, an einem Arm seine Frau, am anderen seine Tochter. Alle waren ein wenig verweint; Grete drückte bisweilen ihr Gesicht an den Arm des Vaters.","Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his livery, his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. Everyone was a little crying; From time to time Grete pressed her face against her father's arm.","Just then the bedroom door opened and Herr Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. They were all a little teary-eyed, and from time to time Grete pressed her face against her father’s sleeve.","Then the door of the bed room opened, and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform, with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All were a little tear stained. Now and then Grete pressed her face onto her father’s arm.","Then the bedroom door opened, and Herr Samsa appeared wearing his livery, with his wife on one arm, his daughter on the other. All three looked as if they’d been weeping; Grete kept pressing her face against her father’s arm."

"Sobald die Uhr zehn schlug, suchte die Mutter durch leise Zusprache den Vater zu wecken und dann zu überreden, ins Bett zu gehen, denn hier war es doch kein richtiger Schlaf und diesen hatte der Vater, der um sechs Uhr seinen Dienst antreten mußte, äußerst nötig. Aber in dem Eigensinn, der ihn, seitdem er Diener war, ergriffen hatte, bestand er immer darauf, noch länger bei Tisch zu bleiben, trotzdem er regelmäßig einschlief, und war dann überdies nur mit der größten Mühe zu bewegen, den Sessel mit dem Bett zu vertauschen. Da mochten Mutter und Schwester mit kleinen Ermahnungen noch so sehr auf ihn eindringen, viertelstundenlang schüttelte er langsam den Kopf, hielt die Augen geschlossen und stand nicht auf. Die Mutter zupfte ihn am Ärmel, sagte ihm Schmeichelworte ins Ohr, die Schwester verließ ihre Aufgabe, um der Mutter zu helfen, aber beim Vater verfing das nicht. Er versank nur noch tiefer in seinen Sessel. Erst bis ihn die Frauen unter den Achseln faßten, schlug er die Augen auf, sah abwechselnd die Mutter und die Schwester an und pflegte zu sagen: »Das ist ein Leben. Das ist die Ruhe meiner alten Tage.« Und auf die beiden Frauen gestützt, erhob er sich, umständlich, als sei er für sich selbst die größte Last, ließ sich von den Frauen bis zur Türe führen, winkte ihnen dort ab und ging nun selbständig weiter, während die Mutter ihr Nähzeug, die Schwester ihre Feder eiligst hinwarfen, um hinter dem Vater zu laufen und ihm weiter behilflich zu sein.","As soon as the clock struck ten, the mother tried to wake up the father with a gentle voice and then persuaded him to go to bed, because here it was not really sleep and the father, who had to go to work at six o'clock, had expressed it necessary. But in the stubbornness that had seized him since he was a servant, he always insisted on staying longer at table, although he regularly fell asleep, and then, moreover, it was only with great difficulty that he could move the chair with the bed to swap. No matter how much his mother and sister pressed on him with little admonitions, he slowly shook his head for a quarter of an hour, kept his eyes closed and didn't get up. His mother tugged at his sleeve, said flattery in his ear, his sister left her job to help his mother, but his father didn't care. He just sank deeper into his chair. Only until the women took him under the armpits did he open his eyes, look alternately at his mother and sister, and used to say: ""It's a life. That's the calm of my old age.” And leaning on the two women, he got up awkwardly, as if he were the greatest burden for himself, let the women lead him to the door, waved them off there, and then went on his own on, while the mother hurriedly threw down her sewing kit and the sister her pen to run behind the father and continue to help him.","As soon as the clock struck ten, the mother tried to rouse the father with gentle words and then persuade him to go to bed, for he simply was not getting any proper rest where he was, something he sorely needed since he had to go on duty at six. But, with this stubbornness that he had acquired since becoming a bank messenger, he always insisted on staying longer at the table even though he nodded off regularly, and it was then a monumental task to coax him into exchanging the chair for the bed. However much the mother and sister prodded him with admonishments, he would go on shaking his head slowly with his eyes closed for another quarter of an hour and refuse to get up. The mother plucked at his sleeve, cajoling softly in his ear, and the sister left her lessons to help the mother, all to no avail. The father only ensconced himself farther in the chair. Not until the two women pulled him up under the arms would he open his eyes and look back and forth from the mother to the sister, with the customary remark: “What a life. This is the rest of my old age.” And supported by the two women, he rose haltingly to his feet as if he himself were his greatest burden and allowed the women to steer him to the door, where he shrugged them off and labored on alone, while the mother dropped her sewing and the sister her pen to run after him and aid him further.","As soon as the clock struck ten, the mother tried encouraging the father gently to wake up and then persuading him to go to bed, on the ground that he couldn’t get a proper sleep here and the father, who had to report for service at six The Metamorphosis o’clock, really needed a good sleep. But in his stubbornness, which had gripped him since he had become a servant, he insisted always on staying even longer by the table, although he regularly fell asleep and then could only be prevailed upon with the greatest difficulty to trade his chair for the bed. No matter how much the mother and sister might at that point work on him with small admonitions, for a quarter of an hour he would remain shaking his head slowly, his eyes closed, without standing up. The mother would pull him by the sleeve and speak flattering words into his ear; the sister would leave her work to help her mother, but that would not have the desired effect on the father. He would settle himself even more deeply in his arm chair. Only when the two women grabbed him under the armpits would he throw his eyes open, look back and forth at the mother and sister, and habitually say ‘This is a life. This is the peace and quiet of my old age.’ And propped up by both women, he would heave himself up, elaborately, as if for him it was the greatest travail, allow himself to be led to the door by the women, wave them away there, and proceed on his own from there, while the mother quickly threw down her sewing implements and the sister her pen in order to run after the father and help him some more.","The moment the clock struck ten, Gregor’s mother would attempt to rouse his father with a few hushed words and then persuade him to go to bed, for he would get no proper sleep sitting here, and sleep was something Gregor’s father—who had to report for duty at six in the morning—desperately needed. But in keeping with the stubbornness that had taken hold of him when he started working as a porter, he always insisted on continuing to sit there at the table, even though he kept falling asleep, and then it was only with the greatest effort that he could be persuaded to exchange armchair for bed. Gregor’s mother and sister could persist in their little admonishments as doggedly as they liked; for a quarter of an hour, he would just shake his head slowly, his eyes closed, without getting up. Gregor’s mother would pluck at his sleeve, whispering cajoling words in his ear, and his sister would set aside her studies to come to her mother’s aid, but to no avail. Gregor’s father only settled deeper into his armchair. Only when the women gripped him beneath the arms would he open his eyes, looking by turns at mother and sister and saying: “What sort of life is this? Is this the peace and quiet of my old age?” Then, supported by the two women, he would rise, laboriously, as though he himself were receiving the brunt of this burden, and allow the women to escort him to the doorway, where he would shoo them away and continue on his own, while Gregor’s mother hastily threw down her sewing and his sister her pen"
"Aber Gretes Worte hatten die Mutter erst recht beunruhigt, sie trat zur Seite, erblickte den riesigen braunen Fleck auf der geblümten Tapete, rief, ehe ihr eigentlich zum Bewußtsein kam, daß das Gregor war, was sie sah, mit schreiender, rauher Stimme: »Ach Gott, ach Gott!« und fiel mit ausgebreiteten Armen, als gebe sie alles auf, über das Kanapee hin und rührte sich nicht. »Du, Gregor!« rief die Schwester mit erhobener Faust und eindringlichen Blicken. Es waren seit der Verwandlung die ersten Worte, die sie unmittelbar an ihn gerichtet hatte. Sie lief ins Nebenzimmer, um irgendeine Essenz zu holen, mit der sie die Mutter aus ihrer Ohnmacht wecken könnte; Gregor wollte auch helfen – zur Rettung des Bildes war noch Zeit –; er klebte aber fest an dem Glas und mußte sich mit Gewalt losreißen; er lief dann auch ins Nebenzimmer, als könne er der Schwester irgendeinen Rat geben, wie in früherer Zeit; mußte aber dann untätig hinter ihr stehen; während sie in verschiedenen Fläschchen kramte, erschreckte sie noch, als sie sich umdrehte; eine Flasche fiel auf den Boden und zerbrach; ein Splitter verletzte Gregor im Gesicht, irgendeine ätzende Medizin umfloß ihn; Grete nahm nun, ohne sich länger aufzuhalten, so viele Fläschchen, als sie nur halten konnte, und rannte mit ihnen zur Mutter hinein; die Tür schlug sie mit dem Fuße zu. Gregor war nun von der Mutter abgeschlossen, die durch seine Schuld vielleicht dem Tode nahe war; die Tür durfte er nicht öffnen, wollte er die Schwester, die bei der Mutter bleiben mußte, nicht verjagen; er hatte jetzt nichts zu tun, als zu warten; und von Selbstvorwürfen und Besorgnis bedrängt, begann er zu kriechen, überkroch alles, Wände, Möbel und Zimmerdecke und fiel endlich in seiner Verzweiflung, als sich das ganze Zimmer schon um ihn zu drehen anfing, mitten auf den großen Tisch.","But Grete's words had really worried the mother, she stepped aside, saw the huge brown stain on the flowered wallpaper, before she actually realized that what she was seeing was Gregor, she called out in a screaming, hoarse voice: "" Oh God, oh God!' and fell over the sofa with outstretched arms, as if giving up everything, and didn't move. ""You, Gregor!"" called the nurse with a raised fist and an intense look. They were the first words she had addressed directly to him since the transformation. She ran into the next room to get some essence with which to wake her mother from her faint; Gregor also wanted to help - there was still time to save the picture -; but he was stuck firmly to the glass and had to tear himself free by force; he then ran into the next room as if he could give his sister some advice, like in the old days; but then had to stand idly behind her; while she was rummaging through various bottles, she was startled when she turned around; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut Gregor in the face, some caustic medicine flowed around him; Grete now, without stopping any longer, took as many bottles as she could hold and ran inside with them to her mother; she slammed the door with her foot. Gregor was now cut off from his mother, who might have been close to death through his fault; he wasn't allowed to open the door if he didn't want to chase away his sister, who had to stay with her mother; he had nothing to do now but wait; and afflicted by self-reproach and anxiety, he began to crawl, crawled over everything, walls, furniture and ceiling, and finally, in his desperation, when the whole room was already beginning to turn around him, he fell in the middle of the big table.","But Grete’s words had quite unnerved the mother; she took a step to the side, took in the huge brown splotch on the flowered wallpaper, and, before realizing what she saw was actually Gregor, screamed in a loud, harsh voice: “Oh God! Oh God!” and collapsed, arms, outflung in total abandon, onto the sofa and did not move. “Gregor, you!” yelled the sister, glaring fiercely and raising her fist. These were her first direct words to him since the metamorphosis. She ran to the next room for some kind of aromatic spirits to revive the mother from her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—there was time enough to save the picture—but he was stuck fast to the glass and had to wrench himself free, then he also ran into the next room, as if to offer advice as he used to, but had to stand idly behind her once there while she was rummaging among the various bottles; she was freshly shocked when she turned around, one of the vials fell to the floor and shattered, a splinter of glass sliced Gregor’s face and a corrosive medicine splashed around him; Grete, without further delay, grabbed as many vials as she could hold, ran with them to her mother, and kicked shut the door. Gregor was now cut off from the mother, who might be near death because of him; he could not open the door for fear of frightening away the sister, who had to stay with the mother; there was nothing to do but wait, and plagued with worry and self-reproach he began to crawl, to crawl all over, over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally fell in despair, when the whole room was spinning, onto the middle of the large table.","But Grete’s words had immediately made the mother very uneasy. She walked to the side, caught sight of the enormous brown splotch on the flowered wallpaper, and, before she became truly aware that what she was looking at was Gregor, screamed out in a high pitched raw voice ‘Oh God, oh God’ and fell with outstretched arms, as if she was surrendering everything, down onto the couch and lay there motionless. ‘ Gregor, you …,’ cried out his sister with a raised fist and an urgent glare. Since his transformation those were the first words which she had directed right at him. She ran into the room next door to bring some spir-its or other with which she could revive her mother from her fainting spell. Gregor wanted to help as well (there was time enough to save the picture), but he was stuck fast on the glass and had to tear himself loose forcefully. Then he also scurried into the next room, as if he could give his sister some advice, as in earlier times, but then he had to stand there idly behind her, while she rummaged about among various small bottles. Still, she was frightened when she turned around. A bottle fell onto the floor and shattered. A splinter of glass wounded Gregor in the face, some cor-rosive medicine or other dripped over him. Now, without lingering any longer, Grete took as many small bottles as she could hold and ran with them into her mother. She slammed the door shut with her foot. Gregor was now shut off from his mother, who was perhaps near death, thanks to him. He could not open the door, and he did not want to chase away his sister who had to remain with her mother. At this point he had nothing to do but wait, and overwhelmed with self-reproach and worry, he began to creep and crawl over everything: walls, furniture, and ceiling,. Finally, in his despair, as the entire room started to spin around him, he fell onto the middle of the large table.","But Grete’s words succeeded in unsettling her mother even more: taking one step to the side, she saw the huge brown blotch on the flowered wallpaper, and before she was even able to realize that what she saw there was Gregor, she cried out in a hoarse, shrieking voice, “Oh God, oh God!” and fell back upon the settee, her arms spread wide as though she were giving up everything, and lay there without moving. “Gregor!” his sister shouted, raising her fist with a threatening glower. It was the first time she had addressed him directly since his metamorphosis. She ran into the next room to fetch some sort of essence that could be used to awaken her mother from her faint; Gregor wanted to help as well—there would be time enough to save the picture later—but he stuck fast to the glass and had to tear himself away by force; he too then ran into the next room as if he might offer his sister advice of some sort, like in the old days; but then could only stand idly behind her as she rummaged among various little bottles, and scared her out of her wits when she turned around; one bottle flew to the floor and shattered; a shard of glass scratched Gregor’s face, and some sort of corrosive medicine engulfed him; without further delay, Grete took up as many bottles as she could hold and ran with them to her mother, slamming the door behind her with her foot. Gregor was now cut off from his mother, who was possibly on the brink of death, for which he himself was to blame; he could not open the door if he didn’t want to drive away his sister, who had to stay there with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and tormented by his worries and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, crawling over everything, walls, furniture, the ceiling, and finally in his despair, as the entire room began to spin around him, he fell smack in the middle of the big table."
"Die Familie selbst aß in der Küche. Trotzdem kam der Vater, ehe er in die Küche ging, in dieses Zimmer herein und machte mit einer einzigen Verbeugung, die Kappe in der Hand, einen Rundgang um den Tisch. Die Zimmerherren erhoben sich sämtlich und murmelten etwas in ihre Bärte. Als sie dann allein waren, aßen sie fast unter vollkommenem Stillschweigen. Sonderbar schien es Gregor, daß man aus allen mannigfachen Geräuschen des Essens immer wieder ihre kauenden Zähne heraushörte, als ob damit Gregor gezeigt werden sollte, daß man Zähne brauche, um zu essen, und daß man auch mit den schönsten zahnlosen Kiefern nichts ausrichten könne. »Ich habe ja Appetit,« sagte sich Gregor sorgenvoll, »aber nicht auf diese Dinge. Wie sich diese Zimmerherren nähren, und ich komme um!«","The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nevertheless, before he went into the kitchen, Father came into this room and, with a single bow, cap in hand, made a tour of the table. The lodgers all rose and murmured something under their beards. Then, when they were alone, they ate in almost complete silence. It seemed strange to Gregor that you could hear her chewing teeth over and over again in all the various noises of eating, as if that were to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and that even with the most beautiful toothless jaws you can't do anything. 'I do have an appetite,' Gregor said to himself worriedly, 'but not for these things. How these lodgers feed, and I perish!”","The family itself ate in the kitchen. Nevertheless the father came into the living room before retiring to the kitchen, bowed deeply, hat in hand, and made the rounds of the table. The boarders stood up as one and mumbled something into their beards. When they were alone again they ate in virtual silence. It seemed odd to Gregor that out of the myriad noises from the meal, he could always distinguish the mashing teeth, as if to indicate to Gregor that teeth were needed in order to eat and even the best of toothless jaws could do nothing. “I’m hungry enough,” said Gregor to himself mournfully, “but not for these things. How these boarders stuff themselves and here I am starving to death!”","The family itself ate in the kitchen. In spite of that, before the father went into the kitchen, he came into the room and with a single bow, cap in hand, made a tour of the table. The lodgers rose up collectively and murmured something in their beards. Then, when they were alone, they ate almost in complete silence. It seemed odd to Gregor that out of all the many different sorts of sounds of eating, what was always audible was their chewing teeth, as if by that Gregor should be shown that people needed their teeth to eat and that nothing could be done even with the most handsome toothless jawbone. ‘I really do have an appetite,’ Gregor said to himself sorrowfully, ‘but not for these things. How these lodgers stuff themselves, and I am dying.’","The family members themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless Gregor’s father visited the living room on his way to the kitchen and with a single bow, cap in hand, took a tour around the table. The lodgers all rose from their seats and mumbled into their beards. Left alone again, they ate in almost perfect silence. It struck Gregor as peculiar that amid all the various sounds of this meal, one could also make out their champing teeth, as if to demonstrate to Gregor that a person needs teeth to eat and that even the most splendid jaws, if toothless, can accomplish nothing at all. “I’m hungry,” Gregor said sorrowfully to himself, “but not for these things. Just look how these lodgers take their nourishment while I am wasting away!”"
"Sie beschlossen, den heutigen Tag zum Ausruhen und Spazierengehen zu verwenden; sie hatten diese Arbeitsunterbrechung nicht nur verdient, sie brauchten sie sogar unbedingt. Und so setzten sie sich zum Tisch und schrieben drei Entschuldigungsbriefe, Herr Samsa an seine Direktion, Frau Samsa an ihren Auftraggeber, und Grete an ihren Prinzipal. Während des Schreibens kam die Bedienerin herein, um zu sagen, daß sie fortgehe, denn ihre Morgenarbeit war beendet. Die drei Schreibenden nickten zuerst bloß, ohne aufzuschauen, erst als die Bedienerin sich immer noch nicht entfernen wollte, sah man ärgerlich auf. »Nun?« fragte Herr Samsa. Die Bedienerin stand lächelnd in der Tür, als habe sie der Familie ein großes Glück zu melden, werde es aber nur dann tun, wenn sie gründlich ausgefragt werde. Die fast aufrechte kleine Straußfeder auf ihrem Hut, über die sich Herr Samsa schon während ihrer ganzen Dienstzeit ärgerte, schwankte leicht nach allen Richtungen. »Also was wollen Sie eigentlich?« fragte Frau Samsa, vor welcher die Bedienerin noch am meisten Respekt hatte. »Ja,« antwortete die Bedienerin und konnte vor freundlichem Lachen nicht gleich weiter reden, »also darüber, wie das Zeug von nebenan weggeschafft werden soll, müssen Sie sich keine Sorge machen. Es ist schon in Ordnung.« Frau Samsa und Grete beugten sich zu ihren Briefen nieder, als wollten sie weiterschreiben; Herr Samsa, welcher merkte, daß die Bedienerin nun alles ausführlich zu beschreiben anfangen wollte, wehrte dies mit ausgestreckter Hand entschieden ab. Da sie aber nicht erzählen durfte, erinnerte sie sich an die große Eile, die sie hatte, rief offenbar beleidigt: »Adjes allseits,« drehte sich wild um und verließ unter fürchterlichem Türezuschlagen die Wohnung.","They decided to use today to rest and walk; not only did they deserve this break, they badly needed it. And so they sat down at the table and wrote three letters of apology, Mr. Samsa to his management, Mrs. Samsa to her client, and Grete to her principal. As she was writing, the clerk came in to say she was leaving because her morning work was over. The three writers only nodded at first without looking up, only when the operator still wouldn't move away did they look up angrily. ""Well?"" asked Mr. Samsa. The waitress stood in the doorway smiling, as if she was very fortunate to report to the family, but would only do so if she was questioned thoroughly. The almost upright little ostrich feather on her hat, which had annoyed Herr Samsa throughout her entire service life, swayed slightly in all directions. ""So what do you actually want?"" asked Mrs. Samsa, for whom the waitress had the most respect. 'Yes,' answered the waitress, laughing too hard to continue, 'so you don't have to worry about how the stuff next door is going to be taken away. It's all right.” Frau Samsa and Grete bent down to their letters as if they wanted to continue writing; Mr. Samsa, who noticed that the operator now wanted to begin to describe everything in detail, resolutely rejected this with an outstretched hand. But since she wasn't allowed to talk, she remembered the great hurry she was in, and obviously offended she cried out: ""Adjes everyone!"" turned wildly and left the apartment with a terrible slamming of the door.","They decided to spend the day resting and going for a walk; they not only deserved this respite from work, they desperately needed it. So they sat down at the table to write three letters of excuse,11 Herr Samsa to the bank director, Frau Samsa to her client, and Grete to the shopkeeper. While they were writing, the charwoman came in to announce that she was off, as her morning chores were done. The three scribes merely nodded at first without looking up, but when the charwoman kept hovering they eyed her irritably. “Well?” asked Herr Samsa. The charwoman stood grinning in the doorway as if about to report some great news for the family but would only do so after being properly questioned. The little ostrich feather sitting almost erect on top of her hat, which had annoyed Herr Samsa throughout the whole of her employ, fluttered about in all directions. “Well, what is it then?” queried Frau Samsa, for whom the charwoman had the most respect. “Well,” answered the charwoman, interrupting herself with good-natured chuckling, “well, you don’t have to worry about getting rid of the thing next door. It’s already been taken care of.” Frau Samsa and Grete bowed their heads to the letters as if to resume writing; Herr Samsa, who realized that she was eager to begin describing the details, cut her short with a definitive gesture of his hand. But since she could not tell her story, she remembered that she was in a great hurry, and, obviously insulted, she called out: “So long, everyone,” then furiously whirled around and slammed out of the apartment with a terrific bang of the door.","They decided to pass that day resting and going for a stroll. Not only had they earned this break from work, but there was no question that they really needed it. And so they sat down at the table and wrote three letters of apology: Mr. Samsa to his supervisor, Mrs. Samsa to her client, and Grete to her proprietor. During the writing the cleaning woman came in to say that she was going off, for her morning work was finished. The three people writing at first merely nodded, without glancing up. Only when the cleaning woman was still unwilling to depart, did they look up angrily. ‘ Well?’ asked Mr. Samsa. The cleaning woman stood smiling in the doorway, as if she had a great stroke of luck to report to the family but would only do it if she was asked directly. The almost upright small ostrich feather in her hat, which had irritated Mr. Samsa during her entire service, swayed lightly in all directions. ‘ All right then, what do you really want?’ asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaning lady still usually respected. ‘ Well,’ answered the cleaning woman (smiling so happily she couldn’t go on speaking right away), ‘about how that rubbish from the next room should be thrown out, you mustn’t worry about it. It’s all taken care of.’ Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down to their letters, as though they wanted to go on writing; Mr. Samsa, who noticed that the cleaning woman wanted to start describing everything in detail, decisively prevented her with an outstretched hand. But since she was not allowed to explain, she remembered the great hurry she was in, and called out, clearly insulted, ‘ Ta ta, everyone,’ turned around furiously and left the apartment with a fearful slamming of the door.","They decided to spend the day resting and to go out for a stroll; they had not only earned this respite from their work, but were desperately in need of it. And so they all sat down at the table and wrote three letters of excuse: Herr Samsa to his supervisor, Frau Samsa to her employer, and Grete to her superior. While they were writing, the charwoman came in to say she was leaving, as her morning’s work was completed. The three scribes at first merely nodded without looking up, and only when the charwoman failed to go on her way did they glance up in annoyance. “Well?” Herr Samsa asked. The charwoman stood smiling in the doorway as if she had some splendid good fortune to announce to the family but would not do so until she was properly questioned. The nearly vertical little ostrich feathers on her hat, which had annoyed Herr Samsa for as long as she had been in the family’s service, bobbed gently in all directions. “So what is it you want?” she was asked now by Frau Samsa, the member of the family for whom the charwoman still had the most respect. “Well,” the charwoman replied, her own good-natured laughter making it impossible at first for her to go on speaking, “there’s no need for you to go worrying about how to get rid of that mess in there. It’s already taken care of.” Frau Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if they meant to go on writing; Herr Samsa, who saw that the charwoman was about to start describing everything in detail, summarily silenced her with an outstretched hand. And since she was not permitted to say what she wished, she suddenly remembered the great hurry she was in, and so with an insulted air she cried, “So long, everyone,” turned wildly on her heel, and with the most excruciating slamming of doors left the apartment."
"Die schwere Verwundung Gregors, an der er über einen Monat litt – der Apfel blieb, da ihn niemand zu entfernen wagte, als sichtbares Andenken im Fleische sitzen –, schien selbst den Vater daran erinnert zu haben, daß Gregor trotz seiner gegenwärtigen traurigen und ekelhaften Gestalt ein Familienglied war, das man nicht wie einen Feind behandeln durfte, sondern dem gegenüber es das Gebot der Familienpflicht war, den Widerwillen hinunterzuschlucken und zu dulden, nichts als dulden.","Gregor's serious wound, from which he suffered for more than a month - the apple remained in his flesh as a visible souvenir because no one dared to remove it - seemed to have reminded even his father that Gregor, despite his present sad and disgusting appearance was a member of the family who was not to be treated as an enemy, but towards whom it was a family duty to swallow resentment and tolerate, nothing but tolerate.","GREGOR’S SERIOUS INJURY, FROM which he suffered for almost a month—the apple remained embedded in his flesh as a visible souvenir because no one had the courage to remove it—served to remind even the father that Gregor, despite his now pathetic and repulsive shape, was a member of the family who could not be treated as an enemy; on the contrary, in accordance with family duty they were required to quell their aversion and tolerate him, but only tolerate.","Gregor’s serious wound, from which he suffered for over a month (since no one ventured to remove the apple, it remained in his flesh as a visible reminder), seemed by itself to have reminded the father that, in spite of his present unhappy and hateful appearance, Gregor was a member of the family, something one should not treat as an enemy, and that it was, on the contrary, a requirement of family duty to suppress one’s aversion and to endure—nothing else, just endure.","THE GRIEVOUS WOUND GREGOR HAD RECEIVED, which plagued him for over a month—the apple remained lodged there in his flesh, a visible memento, since no one dared to remove it—seemed to have reminded even his father that Gregor, despite his current lamentable, repulsive form, was a member of the family who should not be treated like an enemy, for family duty dictated that the others swallow down the disgust he aroused in them and show him tolerance, only tolerance."
"Mit einer Art Eigensinn weigerte sich der Vater, auch zu Hause seine Dieneruniform abzulegen; und während der Schlafrock nutzlos am Kleiderhaken hing, schlummerte der Vater vollständig angezogen auf seinem Platz, als sei er immer zu seinem Dienste bereit und warte auch hier auf die Stimme des Vorgesetzten. Infolgedessen verlor die gleich anfangs nicht neue Uniform trotz aller Sorgfalt von Mutter und Schwester an Reinlichkeit, und Gregor sah oft ganze Abende lang auf dieses über und über fleckige, mit seinen stets geputzten Goldknöpfen leuchtende Kleid, in dem der alte Mann höchst unbequem und doch ruhig schlief.","With a kind of stubbornness, the father refused to take off his servant's uniform at home; and while the dressing gown hung uselessly on the coat hook, the father slumbered in his place, fully dressed, as if he were always ready for his service and was waiting for the superior's voice. As a result, the uniform, which was not new at first, lost its cleanliness, despite all the care taken by his mother and sister, and Gregor often spent whole evenings staring at this dress, which was stained all over and shone with its gold buttons, which was always polished, in which the old man felt extremely uncomfortable and yet calm slept.","Out of some absurd obstinacy, the father refused to take off his messenger’s uniform even in the house, and while the dressing gown hung uselessly on the clothes hook, the father sat fully dressed in his chair, as if he were ever ready for duty and awaited, even here, his superior’s call. As a result the uniform, which was not new to begin with, became more and more seedy despite all the efforts of the mother and sister, and Gregor often spent whole evenings staring at this garment, covered with greasy stains and gleaming, constantly polished gold buttons, in which the father slept awkwardly but very peacefully.","With a sort of stubbornness the father refused to take off his servant’s uniform even at home, and while his sleeping gown hung unused on the coat hook, the father dozed completely dressed in his place, as if he was always ready for his responsibility and even here was waiting for the voice of his superior. As result, in spite of all the care of the mother and sister, his uniform, which even at the start was not new, grew dirty, and Gregor looked, often for the entire evening, at this clothing, with stains all over it and with its gold buttons always polished, in which the old man, although very uncomfortable, slept peacefully nonetheless.","In a peculiar form of stubbornness, Gregor’s father refused to take off his porter’s uniform even at home; and while his nightshirt hung uselessly on its hook, he would slumber where he sat, fully clothed, as though he remained ready for service at all times and even here was awaiting his supervisor’s call. As a result, his uniform, which had not been new to start with, soon forfeited much of its cleanliness, despite the care lavished on it by mother and sister, and Gregor would sometimes gaze for an entire evening at this stain-covered jacket resplendent with gold buttons, always highly polished, in which the old man slept in considerable discomfort but nonetheless soundly."
"Solche in seinem gegenwärtigen Zustand ganz nutzlose Gedanken gingen ihm durch den Kopf, während er dort aufrecht an der Türe klebte und horchte. Manchmal konnte er vor allgemeiner Müdigkeit gar nicht mehr zuhören und ließ den Kopf nachlässig gegen die Tür schlagen, hielt ihn aber sofort wieder fest, denn selbst das kleine Geräusch, das er damit verursacht hatte, war nebenan gehört worden und hatte alle verstummen lassen. »Was er nur wieder treibt,« sagte der Vater nach einer Weile, offenbar zur Türe hingewendet, und dann erst wurde das unterbrochene Gespräch allmählich wieder aufgenommen.","Thoughts like this, useless in his present condition, went through his head as he stuck there upright at the door and listened. Sometimes he couldn't listen anymore because of general tiredness and let his head bang against the door carelessly, but he immediately held it tight again, because even the small noise he had made with it had been heard next door and had silenced everyone. ""What he's up to again,"" said the father after a while, evidently turning towards the door, and only then was the interrupted conversation gradually resumed.","Such were the thoughts, utterly useless in his present condition, that went through his head as he stood listening, glued to the door. Sometimes, from general weariness he could listen no longer and carelessly let his head slump against the door, but he promptly recovered because even the small noise he had made had been heard in the next room and had silenced them all. “ What’s he up to now?” the father said after a while, obviously turning toward the door, and only then did the interrupted conversation resume.","In his present situation, such futile ideas went through his head, while he pushed himself right up against the door and listened. Sometimes in his general exhaustion he couldn’t listen any more and let his head bang listlessly against the door, but he immediately pulled himself together, for even the small sound which he made by this motion was heard near by and silenced everyone. ‘ There he goes on again,’ said his father after a while, clearly turning towards the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation gradually be resumed again.","Thoughts like these, utterly futile in his current state, passed through his head as he stood pressed against the door, eavesdropping. Sometimes general exhaustion made it impossible for him to go on listening, and he would carelessly let his head bump against the door, but then he would immediately hold his head still again, for even the faint sound this produced had been heard in the next room, causing everyone to fall silent. “I wonder what he’s getting up to now,” his father would say after a while, apparently facing the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation resume."
"Schon war er so weit, daß er bei stärkerem Schaukeln kaum das Gleichgewicht noch erhielt, und sehr bald mußte er sich nun endgültig entscheiden, denn es war in fünf Minuten einviertel acht, – als es an der Wohnungstür läutete. »Das ist jemand aus dem Geschäft,« sagte er sich und erstarrte fast, während seine Beinchen nur desto eiliger tanzten. Einen Augenblick blieb alles still. »Sie öffnen nicht,« sagte sich Gregor, befangen in irgendeiner unsinnigen Hoffnung. Aber dann ging natürlich wie immer das Dienstmädchen festen Schrittes zur Tür und öffnete. Gregor brauchte nur das erste Grußwort des Besuchers zu hören und wußte schon, wer es war – der Prokurist selbst. Warum war nur Gregor dazu verurteilt, bei einer Firma zu dienen, wo man bei der kleinsten Versäumnis gleich den größten Verdacht faßte? Waren denn alle Angestellten samt und sonders Lumpen, gab es denn unter ihnen keinen treuen ergebenen Menschen, den, wenn er auch nur ein paar Morgenstunden für das Geschäft nicht ausgenützt hatte, vor Gewissensbissen närrisch wurde und geradezu nicht imstande war, das Bett zu verlassen? Genügte es wirklich nicht, einen Lehrjungen nachfragen zu lassen – wenn überhaupt diese Fragerei nötig war –, mußte da der Prokurist selbst kommen, und mußte dadurch der ganzen unschuldigen Familie gezeigt werden, daß die Untersuchung dieser verdächtigen Angelegenheit nur dem Verstand des Prokuristen anvertraut werden konnte? Und mehr infolge der Erregung, in welche Gregor durch diese Überlegungen versetzt wurde, als infolge eines richtigen Entschlusses, schwang er sich mit aller Macht aus dem Bett. Es gab einen lauten Schlag, aber ein eigentlicher Krach war es nicht. Ein wenig wurde der Fall durch den Teppich abgeschwächt, auch war der Rücken elastischer, als Gregor gedacht hatte, daher kam der nicht gar so auffallende dumpfe Klang. Nur den Kopf hatte er nicht vorsichtig genug gehalten und ihn angeschlagen; er drehte ihn und rieb ihn an dem Teppich vor Ärger und Schmerz.","He was already so far that he could hardly keep his balance even if he swayed harder, and very soon he had to make a final decision, because in five minutes it would be a quarter past seven when the doorbell rang. ""That's someone from the shop,"" he said to himself, and almost froze, while his little legs danced all the more hastily. For a moment everything was quiet. ""They won't open,"" said Gregor to himself, in some senseless hope. But then, of course, as always, the maid went to the door with firm steps and opened it. Gregor only had to hear the visitor's first word of greeting and he already knew who it was - the general manager himself. Why was only Gregor sentenced to serve at a company where the slightest omission immediately raised the greatest suspicion? Were all the clerks all rags, wasn't there a loyal, devoted man among them who, if he hadn't used even a few morning hours for business, would go mad with remorse and be almost unable to get out of bed? If it really wasn't enough to have an apprentice inquire - if such questioning was necessary at all - then the chief clerk had to come himself, and thereby show the whole innocent family that the investigation of this suspicious matter could only be entrusted to the clerk's mind ? And more as a result of the excitement in which Gregor was caused by these considerations than as a result of any correct decision, he swung himself out of bed with all his might. There was a loud bang, but it wasn't an actual crash. The fall was softened a little by the carpet, and the back was more elastic than Gregor had thought, hence the dull sound, which wasn't all that noticeable. Only he hadn't held his head carefully enough and hit it; he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet in anger and pain.","He was already out so far that he could barely keep his balance while vigorously rocking, and very soon he would have to decide one way or the other, because in five minutes it would be a quarter past seven—then the doorbell rang. “That’s someone from the office,” he said to himself, and slightly stiffened although his legs only danced more wildly. Everything was still for a moment. “They’re not going to answer,” Gregor said to himself, clinging to some absurd hope. But then of course the maid marched sharply to the door as usual and opened it. Gregor needed only to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting to know who it was—the head clerk himself. Why was Gregor condemned to serve at a firm where the smallest infraction was seized upon with the gravest suspicion; was each and every employee a scoundrel; was there no loyal and dedicated man serving them who, having spent several hours of the morning not devoted to the firm, might become so overcome by pangs of remorse as to be actually unable to get out of bed? Would it not have been enough to send an apprentice to inquire— if any inquiry were actually necessary; did the head clerk himself have to come, and did the whole innocent family have to be shown that only the head clerk could be entrusted to investigate this suspicious matter? And owing more to the anxiety these thoughts caused Gregor than to any real decision, he swung himself with all his might out of the bed. There was a loud thud but not really a crash. The fall was broken somewhat by the carpet, and his back was more flexible than Gregor had thought, so there resulted only a relatively unobtrusive thump. However, he had not been careful enough about raising his head and had banged it; he twisted it and rubbed it against the carpet in pain and aggravation.","He had already got to the point where, with a stronger rocking, he maintained his equilibrium with difficulty, and very soon he would finally have to decide, for in five minutes it would be a quarter past seven. Then there was a ring at the door of the apartment. ‘That’s someone from the office’ he told himself, and he almost froze while his small limbs only danced around all the faster. For one moment everything remained still. ‘They aren’t opening,’ Gregor said to himself, caught up in some absurd hope. But of course then, as usual, the servant girl with her firm tread went to the door and opened it. Gregor needed to hear only the visitor’s first word of greeting to recognize immediately who it was, the manager himself. Why was Gregor the only one condemned to work in a firm where at the slightest lapse someone immediately attracted the greatest suspicion? Were all the employees then collectively, one and all, scoundrels? Was there then among them no truly devoted person who, if he failed to use just a couple of hours in the morning for office work, would become abnormal from pangs of conscience and really be in no state to get out of bed? Was it really not enough to let an apprentice make inquiries, if such questioning was even necessary? Must the manager himself come, and in the process must it be demonstrated to the entire innocent family that the investigation of this suspicious circumstance could only be entrusted to the intelligence of the manager? And more as a consequence of the excited state in which this idea put Gregor than as a result of an actual decision, he swung himself with all his might out of the bed. There was a loud thud, but not a real crash. The fall was absorbed somewhat by the carpet and, in addition, his back was more elastic than Gregor had thought. For that reason the dull noise was not quite so conspicuous. But he had not held his head up with sufficient care and had hit it. He turned his head, irritated and in pain, and rubbed it on the carpet.","Already he’d reached the point where the vigorous rocking motion was making it almost impossible for him to keep his balance, and soon he would have to make up his mind and take the plunge, for a quarter after seven was only five minutes away—when the front doorbell rang. “It’s someone from the office,” he said to himself and nearly froze while his little legs went on scrabbling all the more frenetically. For a moment all was still. “They won’t answer,” Gregor said to himself, caught up in some deluded hope. But then of course, as always, the maid strode resolutely to the door and opened it. Gregor needed only hear the visitor’s first words of greeting to know who it was: the general manager himself. Why oh why was Gregor condemned to serve in a firm where even the most negligible falling short was enough to arouse the greatest possible suspicion? Was every last one of the firm’s employees a scoundrel, was there not a single loyal, devoted soul among them who would be driven mad by pangs of conscience should he fail to make the best possible use of even just a few morning hours for his employer’s benefit, such that his guilt would render him virtually incapable of rising from his bed? Would it really not have sufficed to send an apprentice to inquire—if indeed such inquiries were necessary at all —did the general manager have to come in person, and was it necessary to demonstrate to the entire innocent family that the investigation of this suspicious matter could be entrusted only to the general manager’s sharp intellect? And more because of the agitation aroused in Gregor by this train of thought than because of some proper resolution on his part, he swung himself out of bed with all his might. There was a loud thud, you couldn’t really call it a crash. The rug cushioned the impact a little, and since his back was more elastic than he’d thought, the resulting sound was muffled and not so obvious. But he hadn’t managed to hold his head up carefully enough and had bumped it; he turned it this way and that, pressing it against the rug in his vexation and pain."
"Oft lag er dort die ganzen langen Nächte über, schlief keinen Augenblick und scharrte nur stundenlang auf dem Leder. Oder er scheute nicht die große Mühe, einen Sessel zum Fenster zu schieben, dann die Fensterbrüstung hinaufzukriechen und, in den Sessel gestemmt, sich ans Fenster zu lehnen, offenbar nur in irgendeiner Erinnerung an das Befreiende, das früher für ihn darin gelegen war, aus dem Fenster zu schauen. Denn tatsächlich sah er von Tag zu Tag die auch nur ein wenig entfernten Dinge immer undeutlicher; das gegenüberliegende Krankenhaus, dessen nur allzu häufigen Anblick er früher verflucht hatte, bekam er überhaupt nicht mehr zu Gesicht, und wenn er nicht genau gewußt hätte, daß er in der stillen, aber völlig städtischen Charlottenstraße wohnte, hätte er glauben können, von seinem Fenster aus in eine Einöde zu schauen in welcher der graue Himmel und die graue Erde ununterscheidbar sich vereinigten. Nur zweimal hatte die aufmerksame Schwester sehen müssen, daß der Sessel beim Fenster stand, als sie schon jedesmal, nachdem sie das Zimmer aufgeräumt hatte, den Sessel wieder genau zum Fenster hinschob, ja sogar von nun ab den inneren Fensterflügel offen ließ.","He often lay there the whole long night, didn't sleep a moment and just scratched at the leather for hours. Or he didn't shy away from the great effort of pushing a chair to the window, then crawling up the window sill and, leaning on the chair, leaning against the window, evidently only in some memory of the liberating thing that used to lie in it for him to look at the window. For, in fact, he saw things that were only a little distant day by day more and more indistinctly; he never got to see the hospital opposite, which he had cursed all too often to see, and if he hadn't known for certain that he lived on the quiet but thoroughly urban Charlottenstrasse he might have thought it was from his window looking out into a wasteland where gray sky and gray earth indistinguishably merged. Only twice did the attentive nurse have to see that the chair was by the window, when each time after she had tidied up the room she pushed the chair right back to the window, even leaving the inner window casement open from then on.","He often lay there through the whole night, not sleeping a wink, just scrabbling on the leather for hours. Or, not shying from the great effort, he would push a chair over to the window, climb up to the sill, and lean, propped up on the chair, against the windowpanes, evidently in some vague remembrance of the freedom he had once found in gazing out. For actually he now saw things just a short distance away becoming dimmer each day; he could no longer make out the hospital opposite, whose sight he used to curse for having seen it all too often, and if he were not so certain that he lived on the quiet but decidedly urban Charlotte Street, he could have believed that he was gazing out the window at a barren wasteland where the ashen sky merged indistinguishably with the gray earth. The observant sister had needed to notice the chair standing by the window only twice; whenever she straightened the room after that, she carefully replaced the chair at the window and now even left the inner casements open.","Often he lay there all night long. He didn’t sleep a moment and just scratched on the leather for hours at a time. He undertook the very difficult task of shoving a chair over to the window. Then he crept up on the window sill and, braced in the chair, leaned against the window to look out, obviously with some memory or other of the satisfaction which that used to bring him in earlier times. Actually from day to day he perceived things with less and less clarity, even those a short distance away: the hospital across the street, the all too frequent sight of which he had previously cursed, was not visible at all any more, and if he had not been precisely aware that he lived in the quiet but completely urban Charlotte Street, he could have believed that from his window he was peering out at a featureless wasteland, in which the gray heaven and the gray earth had merged and were indistinguishable. His attentive sister must have observed a couple of times that the chair stood by the window; then, after cleaning up the room, each time she pushed the chair back right against the window and from now on she even left the inner casement open.","Often he would lie there the entire long night, not sleeping for a moment, just scrabbling for hours against the leather. Or, not shunning the great effort it cost him to push an armchair over to the window, he would climb up the sill and, propped in the armchair, lean against the window, apparently lost in some sort of reverie of how liberating he’d always found it to gaze outside. For in truth he saw even the objects that were quite near at hand less and less clearly as the days progressed; the hospital across the way whose all too constant sight he had earlier reviled was now no longer even visible to him, and if he had not known perfectly well that he was a resident of Charlottenstrasse, a quiet but perfectly urban street, he might have imagined he was gazing out his window onto a desert in which the gray sky and the gray earth were indistinguishably conjoined. His attentive sister only had to see the armchair standing beside the window twice before she started pushing it back to its place there each time she tidied his room; indeed she even began leaving the window’s inner sash open."
"Und so ließ sie sich von ihrem Entschlusse durch die Mutter nicht abbringen, die auch in diesem Zimmer vor lauter Unruhe unsicher schien, bald verstummte und der Schwester nach Kräften beim Hinausschaffen des Kastens half. Nun, den Kasten konnte Gregor im Notfall noch entbehren, aber schon der Schreibtisch mußte bleiben. Und kaum hatten die Frauen mit dem Kasten, an dem sie sich ächzend drückten, das Zimmer verlassen, als Gregor den Kopf unter dem Kanapee hervorstieß, um zu sehen, wie er vorsichtig und möglichst rücksichtsvoll eingreifen könnte. Aber zum Unglück war es gerade die Mutter, welche zuerst zurückkehrte, während Grete im Nebenzimmer den Kasten umfangen hielt und ihn allein hin und her schwang, ohne ihn natürlich von der Stelle zu bringen. Die Mutter aber war Gregors Anblick nicht gewöhnt, er hätte sie krank machen können, und so eilte Gregor erschrocken im Rückwärtslauf bis an das andere Ende des Kanapees, konnte es aber nicht mehr verhindern, daß das Leintuch vorne ein wenig sich bewegte. Das genügte, um die Mutter aufmerksam zu machen. Sie stockte, stand einen Augenblick still und ging dann zu Grete zurück.","And so she didn't let her mother dissuade her from her decision, who seemed unsure of herself in this room because of all the restlessness, soon fell silent and helped her sister to get the box out as best she could. Well, Gregor could still do without the box in an emergency, but the desk had to remain. And no sooner had the women left the room with the box, against which they were groaning, than Gregor poked his head out from under the sofa to see how he could intervene carefully and as considerately as possible. But unfortunately it was the mother who came back first, while Grete in the next room held the box and swung it back and forth on her own, without of course moving it from the spot. But the mother wasn't used to the sight of Gregor, he could have made her ill, and so Gregor, frightened, rushed backwards to the other end of the sofa, but could no longer prevent the sheet from moving a little in front. That was enough to draw the mother's attention. She stopped, stood still for a moment and then went back to Grete.","And so she refused to be shaken from her resolve by the mother, who seemed extremely anxious and unsure of herself in this room and soon quieted and helped the sister, to the best of her abilities, to push the bureau outside. Now, in a pinch Gregor could do without the bureau but the desk must absolutely stay. And no sooner had the women left the room, grunting and heaving with the bureau, than Gregor poked his head out from under the sofa to ascertain how he could cautiously and tactfully intervene. But as luck would have it, it was the mother who returned first while Grete was still in the next room with her arms around the bureau, rocking it and trying to shift it on her own but naturally not budging it an inch. The mother, however, was unaccustomed to Gregor’s appearance and it might have sickened her; so Gregor panicked and scuttled back to the other end of the sofa, but he could not prevent the sheet from stirring a little in front. This was enough to catch the mother’s eye. She froze, stood still for a beat, then retreated to Grete.","And so she did not let herself be dis-suaded from her decision by her mother, who in this room seemed uncertain of herself in her sheer agitation and soon kept quiet, helping his sister with all her energy to get the chest of drawers out of the room. Now, Gregor could still do without the chest of drawers if need be, but the writing desk really had to stay. And scarcely had the women left the room with the chest of drawers, groaning as they pushed it, when Gregor stuck his head out from under the sofa to take a look how he could intervene cautiously and with as much consideration as possible. But unfortunately it was his mother who came back into the room first, while Grete had her arms wrapped around the chest of drawers in the next room and was rocking it back and forth by herself, without moving it from its position. His mother was not used to the sight of Gregor; he could have made her ill, and so, frightened, Gregor scurried backwards right to the other end of the sofa, but he could no longer prevent the sheet from moving forward a little. That was enough to catch his mother’s attention. She came to a halt, stood still for a moment, and then went back to Grete.","And so she held fast to her resolve despite the protests of her mother, who appeared troubled to the point of indecision even by the room in its present state; she soon fell silent and helped Gregor’s sister remove the wardrobe as best she could. Well, the wardrobe was something Gregor could do without if need be, but the desk would certainly have to stay. And no sooner had the women left the room with the cabinet, groaning as they pressed against its weight, than Gregor poked out his head from beneath the settee to see how he might, cautiously and as considerately as possible, intervene. But unfortunately his mother was the first to return while Grete was still in the next room, clasping the wardrobe in her arms and tipping it back and forth on her own—without, of course, moving it from the spot. But Gregor’s mother was unaccustomed to his appearance, it might have made her ill to catch a glimpse of him, and so Gregor in alarm withdrew as fast as he could to the far end of the settee, but it was too late to prevent the front edge of the bedsheet from stirring a little. This was enough to attract his mother’s notice. Startled, she froze for a moment, then went back to where Grete was."
"»Aber Herr Prokurist,« rief Gregor außer sich und vergaß in der Aufregung alles andere, »ich mache ja sofort, augenblicklich auf. Ein leichtes Unwohlsein, ein Schwindelanfall, haben mich verhindert aufzustehen. Ich liege noch jetzt im Bett. Jetzt bin ich aber schon wieder ganz frisch. Eben steige ich aus dem Bett. Nur einen kleinen Augenblick Geduld! Es geht noch nicht so gut, wie ich dachte. Es ist mir aber schon wohl. Wie das nur einen Menschen so überfallen kann! Noch gestern abend war mir ganz gut, meine Eltern wissen es ja, oder besser, schon gestern abend hatte ich eine kleine Vorahnung. Man hätte es mir ansehen müssen. Warum habe ich es nur im Geschäfte nicht gemeldet! Aber man denkt eben immer, daß man die Krankheit ohne Zuhausebleiben überstehen wird. Herr Prokurist! Schonen Sie meine Eltern! Für alle die Vorwürfe, die Sie mir jetzt machen, ist ja kein Grund; man hat mir ja davon auch kein Wort gesagt. Sie haben vielleicht die letzten Aufträge, die ich geschickt habe, nicht gelesen. Übrigens, noch mit dem Achtuhrzug fahre ich auf die Reise, die paar Stunden Ruhe haben mich gekräftigt. Halten Sie sich nur nicht auf, Herr Prokurist; ich bin gleich selbst im Geschäft, und haben Sie die Güte, das zu sagen und mich dem Herrn Chef zu empfehlen!«","""But Mr. General Manager,"" exclaimed Gregor, forgetting everything else in his excitement, ""I'll open right away, right now. A slight feeling of discomfort, an attack of dizziness prevented me from getting up. I'm still in bed now. But now I'm fresh again. I'm just getting out of bed. Just a little patience! It's not going as well as I thought it would. But I'm fine. How that can overwhelm a person like that! Yesterday evening I felt quite well, my parents know it, or rather, last night I had a little premonition. You should have looked at me. Why didn't I report it to the shops! But you always think that you will survive the illness without staying at home. Mr. General Manager! Spare my parents! There's no reason for all the reproaches you're leveling at me now; no one said a word to me about it. You may not have read the last orders I sent. By the way, I'm going on the journey with the eight o'clock train, the few hours of rest have strengthened me. Just don't linger, Herr General Manager; I'll be in business soon myself, and have the goodness to say so and recommend me to the boss!""","“But, sir,” cried Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in his agitation, “I’ll open the door immediately, this instant. A slight indisposition, a spell of dizziness prevented me from getting up. I’m still lying in bed. But now I am feeling completely refreshed. I’m just getting out of bed. Please be patient a moment! I’m not as well as I thought. But really I’m all right. These things can just wipe you out so suddenly. Only last night I felt fine, my parents can tell you, or actually last night I already had some sign of it. They must have noticed it. Oh, why did I not report it at the office! But one always thinks that one will overcome an illness without staying home. Sir, please spare my parents! There are no grounds to the accusations you’ve just made against me, no one has said so much as a word about them to me. Perhaps you haven’t seen the latest orders I sent in. In any event, I will be on the eight o’clock train. I’ve been invigorated by these few hours of rest. Don’t let me keep you further, sir, I’ll be in the office myself immediately. Please be good enough to tell them and convey my respects to the Chief!”","‘But Mr. Manager,’ called Gregor, beside himself and in his agitation forgetting everything else, ‘I’m opening the door immediately, this very moment. A slight indisposition, a dizzy spell, has prevented me from getting up. I’m still lying in bed right now. But now I’m quite refreshed once again. I’m in the midst of getting out of bed. Just have patience for a short moment! Things are not going so well as I thought. But things are all right. How suddenly this can overcome someone! Just yesterday evening everything was fine with me. My parents certainly know that. Actually just yesterday evening I had a small premonition. People must have seen that in me. Why have I not reported that to the office! But people always think that they’ll get over sickness without having to stay at home. Mr. Manager! Take it easy on my parents! There is really no basis for the criticisms which you are now making against me, and really nobody has said a word to me about that. Perhaps you have not read the latest orders which I shipped. Besides, now I’m setting out on my trip on the eight o’clock train; the few hours’ rest have made me stronger. Mr. Manager, do not stay. I will be at the office in person right away. Please have the goodness to say that and to convey my respects to the Chief.’","“But sir,” Gregor cried out, beside himself and forgetting all else in his agitation, “I shall open the door at once, this very instant. A slight indisposition, a fit of dizziness kept me from getting up. Even now I’m still in bed. But already I am feeling very much refreshed. Here, I’m getting up. Just a moment’s patience! It’s a bit more difficult than I thought. But already I’m feeling quite fine. How odd, the way such a thing can suddenly come over one. Yesterday evening I felt perfectly all right, my parents can attest to this, or rather: I did in fact feel a mild foreboding yesterday evening already. Surely it was noticeable to anyone looking at me. Why didn’t I send word to the office? But we always just assume we’ll be able to overcome these illnesses without staying home. Sir! Do be gentle with my parents. The allegations you make are unfounded, and no one has ever mentioned anything of the sort to me. Perhaps you haven’t yet looked over the most recent commissions I sent in. In any case, I’ll be back on the road in time for the eight o’clock train; these additional hours of rest have fortified me. Please do not allow me to detain you any longer, sir; I shall be at the office myself in no time; do be so good as to say I’m on my way and give my regards to the boss.”"
"»Nun,« sagte Gregor und war sich dessen wohl bewußt, daß er der einzige war, der die Ruhe bewahrt hatte, »ich werde mich gleich anziehen, die Kollektion zusammenpacken und wegfahren. Wollt ihr, wollt ihr mich wegfahren lassen? Nun, Herr Prokurist, Sie sehen, ich bin nicht starrköpfig und ich arbeite gern; das Reisen ist beschwerlich, aber ich könnte ohne das Reisen nicht leben. Wohin gehen Sie denn, Herr Prokurist? Ins Geschäft? Ja? Werden Sie alles wahrheitsgetreu berichten? Man kann im Augenblick unfähig sein zu arbeiten, aber dann ist gerade der richtige Zeitpunkt, sich an die früheren Leistungen zu erinnern und zu bedenken, daß man später, nach Beseitigung des Hindernisses, gewiß desto fleißiger und gesammelter arbeiten wird. Ich bin ja dem Herrn Chef so sehr verpflichtet, das wissen Sie doch recht gut. Andererseits habe ich die Sorge um meine Eltern und die Schwester. Ich bin in der Klemme, ich werde mich aber auch wieder herausarbeiten. Machen Sie es mir aber nicht schwieriger, als es schon ist. Halten Sie im Geschäft meine Partei! Man liebt den Reisenden nicht, ich weiß. Man denkt, er verdient ein Heidengeld und führt dabei ein schönes Leben. Man hat eben keine besondere Veranlassung, dieses Vorurteil besser zu durchdenken. Sie aber, Herr Prokurist, Sie haben einen besseren Überblick über die Verhältnisse, als das sonstige Personal, ja sogar, ganz im Vertrauen gesagt, einen besseren Überblick, als der Herr Chef selbst, der in seiner Eigenschaft als Unternehmer sich in seinem Urteil leicht zuungunsten eines Angestellten beirren läßt. Sie wissen auch sehr wohl, daß der Reisende, der fast das ganze Jahr außerhalb des Geschäftes ist, so leicht ein Opfer von Klatschereien, Zufälligkeiten und grundlosen Beschwerden werden kann, gegen die sich zu wehren ihm ganz unmöglich ist, da er von ihnen meistens gar nichts erfährt und nur dann, wenn er erschöpft eine Reise beendet hat, zu Hause die schlimmen, auf ihre Ursachen hin nicht mehr zu durchschauenden Folgen am eigenen Leibe zu spüren bekommt. Herr Prokurist, gehen Sie nicht weg, ohne mir ein Wort gesagt zu haben, das mir zeigt, daß Sie mir wenigstens zu einem kleinen Teil recht geben!«","'Well,' said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one who had kept calm, 'I'll get dressed right away, pack up the collection and drive away. Do you, do you want to let me drive away? Well, Mr. General Manager, you see I'm not stubborn and I like to work; traveling is hard, but I couldn't live without traveling. Where are you going, sir? To business? Yes? Will you report everything truthfully? One may be unable to work at the moment, but then is just the right time to look back on past accomplishments and to consider that later, when the obstacle is removed, one will surely work all the more diligently and collectedly. I owe so much to the boss, you know that very well. On the other hand, I worry about my parents and sister. I'm in a bind, but I'll work my way out. But don't make it harder for me than it already is. In business hold my party! One does not love the traveller, I know. One thinks he earns a lot of money and leads a nice life. There is no particular reason to think this prejudice through better. But you, Mr. General Manager, have a better overview of the situation than the rest of the staff, yes, even, to tell the truth, a better overview than the boss himself, who, in his capacity as an entrepreneur, was slightly unfavorable in his judgment of an employee. You also know very well that the traveler, who is out of business for most of the year, can so easily become the victim of gossip, accidents and groundless complaints, against which it is quite impossible for him to defend himself, since he is usually not at all aware of them learns nothing and only then, when he has finished a journey exhausted, gets to feel the bad consequences on his own body at home, the causes of which can no longer be understood. Herr General Manager, don't go away without saying a word to me that shows that you agree with me, at least in a small part!'","“Well now,” said Gregor, well aware that he alone had remained calm, “I will get dressed immediately, pack my samples, and be on my way. Will you all, will you let me go catch my train? Now you see, sir, I’m not stubborn and I’m happy to work; traveling is difficult but I couldn’t live without it. Where are you going, sir? To the office? Yes? Will you report on everything truthfully? A man can suddenly be incapable of working, but this is the precise moment to remember his past performance and to consider that later, after resolving his difficulties, he would work all the harder and more diligently. I am so deeply obligated to the Chief, as you well know. And besides, I am responsible for my parents and sister. I am in a tough bind but I’ll work myself back out of it. Please do not make it more difficult than it already is. I beg you to speak up for me in the office! No one likes traveling salesmen, I know. They think we make a slew of money and lead charmed lives. There’s no particular reason for them to further examine this prejudice. But you, sir, you have a better perspective than the rest of the office, an even better perspective, in all confidence, than the Chief himself, who, in his capacity as employer, allows his opinion to be easily swayed against an employee. You know very well that a traveling salesman, out of the office for almost the entire year, can easily fall prey to gossip, coincidences, and unfounded grievances against which he cannot possibly defend himself because he almost never hears about them except when returning home from an exhausting trip; he personally suffers the grim consequences, the causes of which he can no longer determine. Sir, do not leave without giving me a word to show that you think me at least partially right!”","‘Now,’ said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one who had kept his composure. ‘I’ll get dressed right away, pack up the collection of samples, and set off. You’ll allow me to set out on my way, will you not? You see, Mr. Manager, I am not pig-headed, and I am happy to work. Traveling is exhausting, but I couldn’t live without it. Where are you going, Mr. Manager? To the office? Really? Will you report everything truthfully? A person can be incapable of work momentarily, but that is precisely the best time to remember the earlier achievements and to consider that later, after the obstacles have been shoved aside, the person will work all the more keenly and intensely. I am really so indebted to Mr. Chief—you know that perfectly well. On the other hand, I am concerned about my parents and my sister. I’m in a fix, but I’ll work myself out of it again. Don’t make things more difficult for me than they already are. Speak up on my behalf in the office! People don’t like traveling salesmen. I know that. People think they earn pots of money and thus lead a fine life. People don’t even have any special reason to think through this judgment more clearly. But you, Mr. Manager, you have a better perspective on the interconnections than the other people, even, I tell you in total confidence, a better perspective than Mr. Chairman himself, who in his capacity as the employer may let his judgment make casual mistakes at the expense of an employee. You also know well enough that the traveling salesman who is outside the office almost the entire year can become so easily a victim of gossip, coincidences, and groundless complaints, against which it’s impossible for him to defend himself, since for the most part he doesn’t hear about them at all and only then when he’s exhausted after finishing a trip, and gets to feel in his own body at home the nasty consequences, which can’t be thoroughly explored back to their origins. Mr. Manager, don’t leave without speaking a word telling me that you’ll at least concede that I’m a little in the right!’","“Well,” Gregor said, quite conscious of the fact that he was the only one who had retained his composure, “I shall get dressed at once, pack up my samples and be on my way. As for the rest of you, are you prepared to let me do so? You can see, sir”—he said, addressing the general manager—“I am not obstinate, nor a shirker; traveling is burdensome, but without it I could not live. Where are you going now, sir? To the office? Yes? Will you report all these things truthfully? A person can be incapable of working at the moment, but this is precisely the right time to recall his earlier accomplishments and consider that he will later, once the hindrance has been overcome, work all the more industriously and with greater focus. I am so dreadfully indebted to the boss, surely you’re aware of this. On the other hand, I have my parents and sister to think of. Truly I’m in a bind, but I shall work my way out of it. Don’t make things more difficult for me than they already are. Take my side at the office! No one loves us drummers, I know. Everyone thinks the salesmen rake in a king’s ransom while enjoying life’s pleasures. And there’s never any particular cause to reconsider this prejudice. But you, sir, have a far better grasp of the general circumstances than the rest of the staff, better even—if I may speak confidentially—than the boss himself, who in his role as businessman can easily err in his opinion to an employee’s disadvantage. And you no doubt know quite well that a drummer, who spends almost the entire year away from the office, can easily become the victim of gossip, happenstance and groundless complaints against which he cannot possibly defend himself, as he usually never even learns of them, or only when he has completed one of his journeys, exhausted, and then back at home is forced to observe the dire physical effects of causes that can no longer be identified. Please, sir, do not leave without saying something to show you agree with me at least to some small extent!”"
"Da die Zimmerherren manchmal auch ihr Abendessen zu Hause im gemeinsamen Wohnzimmer einnahmen, blieb die Wohnzimmertür an manchen Abenden geschlossen, aber Gregor verzichtete ganz leicht auf das Öffnen der Tür, hatte er doch schon manche Abende, an denen sie geöffnet war, nicht ausgenützt, sondern war, ohne daß es die Familie merkte, im dunkelsten Winkel seines Zimmers gelegen. Einmal aber hatte die Bedienerin die Tür zum Wohnzimmer ein wenig offen gelassen, und sie blieb so offen, auch als die Zimmerherren am Abend eintraten und Licht gemacht wurde. Sie setzten sich oben an den Tisch, wo in früheren Zeiten der Vater, die Mutter und Gregor gesessen hatten, entfalteten die Servietten und nahmen Messer und Gabel in die Hand. Sofort erschien in der Tür die Mutter mit einer Schüssel Fleisch und knapp hinter ihr die Schwester mit einer Schüssel hochgeschichteter Kartoffeln. Das Essen dampfte mit starkem Rauch. Die Zimmerherren beugten sich über die vor sie hingestellten Schüsseln, als wollten sie sie vor dem Essen prüfen, und tatsächlich zerschnitt der, welcher in der Mitte saß und den anderen zwei als Autorität zu gelten schien, ein Stück Fleisch noch auf der Schüssel, offenbar um festzustellen, ob es mürbe genug sei und ob es nicht etwa in die Küche zurückgeschickt werden solle. Er war befriedigt, und Mutter und Schwester, die gespannt zugesehen hatten, begannen aufatmend zu lächeln.","Since the landlords sometimes had their evening meal at home in the common living room, the living room door remained closed on some evenings, but Gregor quite easily refrained from opening the door, as he had not used the evenings when it was open, but rather was lying in the darkest corner of his room without the family noticing. But once the maid left the door to the living room a little open, and it stayed open even when the lodgers came in in the evening and the light was turned on. They sat down at the table where father, mother and Gregor used to sit, unfolded the serviettes and took knife and fork in their hands. Immediately her mother appeared in the doorway with a bowl of meat, and just behind her her sister with a bowl of piled potatoes. The food was steaming with heavy smoke. The landlords bent over the bowls placed in front of them as if they wanted to examine them before eating, and in fact the one who was sitting in the middle and who seemed to be the authority of the other two cut up a piece of meat that was still on the bowl, apparently over determine whether it was tender enough and whether it shouldn't be sent back to the kitchen. He was satisfied, and mother and sister, who had been watching intently, began to smile with relief.","Since the boarders sometimes took their evening meal in the common living room as well, the living room door stayed shut certain evenings, yet Gregor was easily reconciled to the door’s closing: On many evenings it was opened he had not taken advantage of it but, without the family noticing it, had lain in the darkest corner of his room. One time, however, the charwoman had left the living room door slightly ajar and it stayed open, even when the boarders entered in the evening and the lamp was lit. They sat at the head of the table where the father, mother, and Gregor had sat in the old days; they unfolded their napkins and took knife and fork in hand. The mother at once appeared in the doorway with a platter of meat and directly behind her was the sister with a heaping dish of potatoes. Thick plumes of steam rose from the food. The boarders bent over the dishes as if to examine them before eating; in fact the one in the middle, seemingly regarded as an authority by the other two, cut into a piece of meat still on the platter, evidently to determine whether it was tender enough or needed to be sent back to the kitchen. He was satisfied and mother and sister, who were anxiously watching, released their breath and began to smile.","Because the lodgers sometimes also took their evening meal at home in the common living room, the door to the living room stayed shut on many evenings. But Gregor had no trouble at all going without the open door. Already on many evenings when it was open he had not availed himself of it, but, without the family noticing, was stretched out in the darkest corner of his room. However, once the cleaning woman had left the door to the living room slightly ajar, and it remained open even when the lodgers came in in the evening and the lights were put on. They sat down at the head of the table, where in earlier days the mother, the father, and Gregor had eaten, unfolded their serviettes, and picked up their knives and forks. The mother immediately appeared in the door with a dish of meat and right behind her the sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The food gave off a lot of steam. The gentlemen lodgers bent over the plate set before them, as if they wanted to check it before eating, and in fact the one who sat in the middle (for the other two he seemed to serve as the authority) cut off a piece of meat still on the plate obviously to establish whether it was sufficiently tender and whether or not something should be shipped back to the kitchen. He was satisfied, and mother and sister, who had looked on in suspense, began to breathe easily and to smile.","Since the lodgers sometimes also took their supper at home in the shared living room, the living room door remained shut on some evenings, but Gregor was happy to forgo having the door open; in fact, even when it was open, he sometimes failed to take advantage of it and instead, unbeknownst to his family, would remain lying in the darkest corner of his room. Once, however, the charwoman had left the door to the living room slightly ajar, and ajar it remained even when the lodgers came in that evening and struck a light. They sat down at the head of the table where in earlier times Gregor had sat with his father and mother, unfolded the napkins and took up their knives and forks. At once Gregor’s mother appeared in the doorway with a serving dish filled with meat, and right behind her came his sister bearing a plate piled high with potatoes. A heavy vapor rose from the steaming food. The lodgers bent over the dishes that had been placed before them, as though wishing to inspect them before beginning their meal, and in fact the one who sat in the middle and appeared to be an authority figure to the other two cut off a piece of meat right there on the platter to check whether it was tender enough and didn’t have to be sent back to the kitchen. He was satisfied, and Gregor’s mother and sister, who had been watching nervously, now smiled with relief."
"»Wenn er uns verstünde,« sagte der Vater halb fragend; die Schwester schüttelte aus dem Weinen heraus heftig die Hand zum Zeichen, daß daran nicht zu denken sei.","""If he could understand us,"" said the father, half inquiringly; while she was crying, the sister shook her hand violently as a sign that that was out of the question.","“If only he could understand us,” the father said, almost as a question; the sister, still sobbing, vehemently waved her hand to show how unthinkable it was.","‘If only he understood us,’ said the father in a semi-questioning tone. The sister, in the midst of her sobbing, shook her hand energetically as a sign that there was no point thinking of that.","“If he understood us,” Gregor’s father said, half-questioning; his sister, still caught up in her weeping, shook one hand vehemently as a sign of how unthinkable she found this."
"»Liebe Eltern,« sagte die Schwester und schlug zur Einleitung mit der Hand auf den Tisch, »so geht es nicht weiter. Wenn ihr das vielleicht nicht einsehet, ich sehe es ein. Ich will vor diesem Untier nicht den Namen meines Bruders aussprechen und sage daher bloß: wir müssen versuchen es loszuwerden. Wir haben das Menschenmögliche versucht, es zu pflegen und zu dulden, ich glaube, es kann uns niemand den geringsten Vorwurf machen.«","""Dear parents,"" said the sister, slapping her hand on the table to introduce it, ""we can't go on like this. If you don't see that, I see it. I don't want to say my brother's name in front of this monster, so I'll just say: we have to try to get rid of him. We have tried everything humanly possible to cultivate and tolerate it, I don't think anyone can blame us in the slightest.""","“My dear parents,” said the sister, pounding the table with her hand by way of introduction, “things can’t go on like this. Maybe you don’t realize it, but I do. I refuse to pronounce my brother’s name in front of this monstrosity, and so I say: We have to try to get rid of it. We’ve done everything humanly possible to care for it and tolerate it; I don’t believe anyone could reproach us.”","‘My dear parents,’ said the sister banging her hand on the table by way of an introduction, ‘things cannot go on any longer in this way. Maybe if you don’t understand that, well, I do. I will not utter my brother’s name in front of this monster, and thus I say only that we must try to get rid of it. We have tried what is humanly possible to take care of it and to be patient. I believe that no one can criticize us in the slightest.’","“Dear parents,” his sister said, striking the table by way of preamble, “things cannot go on like this. Even if you two perhaps do not realize it, I most certainly do. I am unwilling to utter my brother’s name before this creature, and therefore will say only: we have to try to get rid of it. We have done everything humanly possible to care for it and show it tolerance, I don’t think anyone would reproach us on this account.”"
"»Haben Sie auch nur ein Wort verstanden?« fragte der Prokurist die Eltern, »er macht sich doch wohl nicht einen Narren aus uns?« »Um Gottes willen,« rief die Mutter schon unter Weinen, »er ist vielleicht schwer krank, und wir quälen ihn. Grete! Grete!« schrie sie dann. »Mutter?« rief die Schwester von der anderen Seite. Sie verständigten sich durch Gregors Zimmer. »Du mußt augenblicklich zum Arzt. Gregor ist krank. Rasch um den Arzt. Hast du Gregor jetzt reden hören?« »Das war eine Tierstimme,« sagte der Prokurist, auffallend leise gegenüber dem Schreien der Mutter. »Anna! Anna!« rief der Vater durch das Vorzimmer in die Küche und klatschte in die Hände, »sofort einen Schlosser holen!« Und schon liefen die zwei Mädchen mit rauschenden Röcken durch das Vorzimmer – wie hatte sich die Schwester denn so schnell angezogen? – und rissen die Wohnungstüre auf. Man hörte gar nicht die Türe zuschlagen; sie hatten sie wohl offen gelassen, wie es in Wohnungen zu sein pflegt, in denen ein großes Unglück geschehen ist.","""Did you understand a single word?"" the manager asked his parents, ""he doesn't make a fool of us, does he?"" we torment him. Grete! Grete!' she then screamed. ""Mother?"" called the nurse from the other side. They communicated through Gregor's room. “You must go to the doctor immediately. Gregory is ill. Hurry to the doctor. Did you hear Gregor talking now?' 'It was an animal voice,' said the chief clerk, remarkably quiet compared to his mother's screams. ""Anna! Anna!” called the father through the hall into the kitchen and clapped his hands, “get a locksmith right away!” And then the two girls ran through the hall in rustling skirts – how did the sister get dressed so quickly? – and threw open the apartment door. You didn't even hear the door slam; they had probably left them open, as is usual in homes where a great misfortune has happened.","“Did you understand even a word?” the head clerk asked the parents. “He isn’t making fools of us?” “For God’s sake,” cried the mother, already weeping, “maybe he is seriously ill and we’re tormenting him. Grete! Grete!” she then screamed. “Mother?” called the sister from the other side. They were communicating across Gregor’s room. “You must go for the doctor immediately. Gregor is sick. Run for the doctor. Did you just hear Gregor speak?” “That was the voice of an animal,” said the head clerk, in a noticeably low tone compared to the mother’s shrieking. “Anna! Anna!” yelled the father through the foyer to the kitchen, clapping his hands, “go get a locksmith at once!” And already the two girls were running through the foyer with a rustling of skirts—how had the sister dressed so quickly?—and throwing open the house door. The door could not be heard closing; they must have left it open as is usual in houses visited by great misfortune.3","‘Did you understood a single word?’ the manager asked the parents, ‘Is he playing the fool with us?’ ‘For God’s sake,’ cried the mother already in tears, ‘perhaps he’s very ill and we’re upsetting him. Grete! Grete!’ she yelled at that point. ‘Mother?’ called the sister from the other side. They were making themselves understood through Gregor’s room. ‘You must go to the doctor right away. Gregor is sick. Hurry to the doctor. Have you heard Gregor speak yet?’ ‘That was an animal’s voice,’ said the manager, remarkably quietly in comparison to the mother’s cries. ‘Anna! Anna!’ yelled the father through the hall into the kitchen, clapping his hands, ‘fetch a locksmith right away!’ The two young women were already running through the hall with swishing skirts (how had his sister dressed herself so quickly?) and yanked open the doors of the apartment. One couldn’t hear the doors closing at all. They probably had left them open, as is customary in an apartment in which a huge misfortune has taken place.","“Did you understand a single word?” the manager was asking Gregor’s parents. “Surely he isn’t trying to make fools of us?” “For heaven’s sake,” Gregor’s mother cried, already weeping, “he might be gravely ill, and here we are tormenting him. Grete! Grete!” she cried out. “Mother?” Gregor’s sister called from the other side. They were communicating through Gregor’s room. “You must go for the doctor at once. Gregor is ill. Quick, fetch the doctor. Did you hear him speaking just now?” “That was an animal’s voice,” the general manager said, speaking in noticeably subdued tones compared to the cries of Gregor’s mother. “Anna! Anna!” the father shouted into the kitchen through the vestibule, clapping his hands. “Run and fetch a locksmith, hurry!” And already the two girls were racing through the vestibule, their skirts rustling (how had Gregor’s sister possibly gotten dressed so quickly?), and flung open the front door. There was no sound of the door closing again; no doubt they had left it standing open, as one sees with apartments in which a great calamity has occurred."
"Hätte Gregor nur mit der Schwester sprechen und ihr für alles danken können, was sie für ihn machen mußte, er hätte ihre Dienste leichter ertragen; so aber litt er darunter. Die Schwester suchte freilich die Peinlichkeit des Ganzen möglichst zu verwischen, und je längere Zeit verging, desto besser gelang es ihr natürlich auch, aber auch Gregor durchschaute mit der Zeit alles viel genauer. Schon ihr Eintritt war für ihn schrecklich. Kaum war sie eingetreten, lief sie, ohne sich Zeit zu nehmen, die Türe zu schließen, so sehr sie sonst darauf achtete, jedem den Anblick von Gregors Zimmer zu ersparen, geradewegs zum Fenster und riß es, als ersticke sie fast, mit hastigen Händen auf, blieb auch, selbst wenn es noch so kalt war, ein Weilchen beim Fenster und atmete tief. Mit diesem Laufen und Lärmen erschreckte sie Gregor täglich zweimal; die ganze Zeit über zitterte er unter dem Kanapee und wußte doch sehr gut, daß sie ihn gewiß gerne damit verschont hätte, wenn es ihr nur möglich gewesen wäre, sich in einem Zimmer, in dem sich Gregor befand, bei geschlossenem Fenster aufzuhalten.","If only Gregor could have spoken to his sister and thanked her for everything she had to do for him, he would have endured her services more easily; but he suffered as it was. Of course, the sister tried to cover up the embarrassment of the whole thing as much as possible, and the longer the time passed, the better she succeeded, of course, but over time Gregor saw through everything much more clearly. Even her entrance was terrible for him. As soon as she entered, she ran straight to the window, without taking the time to close the door, no matter how careful she usually was to prevent everyone from looking at Gregor's room, and jerked it open with hasty hands, as if she were about to suffocate up, stayed by the window for a while, no matter how cold it was, and breathed deeply. Twice a day she frightened Gregor with this running and making noise; the whole time he was trembling under the sofa and yet he knew very well that she would have gladly spared him if she had only been able to be in a room where Gregor was with the window closed.","If only Gregor had been able to speak with the sister and thank her for everything she was obliged to do for him, he could have borne her ministrations more easily; as it was they oppressed him. The sister certainly tried to lessen the general awkwardness of the situation as much as possible, and as time went by she naturally succeeded more and more, however with the passing time Gregor too saw everything more clearly. Her very entrance was terrible for him. Hardly had she entered when she rushed directly to the window without taking the time to close the door—although she was usually so careful to shield everyone from the sight of Gregor’s room—tore the window open with hasty hands as if almost suffocating, and stayed there awhile, even when it was bitterly cold, breathing deeply. This bustle and racket of hers tortured Gregor twice a day, and he lay the entire time quaking under the sofa, knowing very well that she would have spared him this if it were at all possible to remain in a room with Gregor with the window shut.","If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for everything that she had to do for him, he would have tolerated her service more easily. As it was he suffered under it. The sister admittedly sought to cover up the awkwardness of everything as much as possible, and, as time went by, she naturally got more successful at it. But with the passing of time Gregor also came to understand everything more precisely. Even her entrance was terrible for him. As soon as she entered, she ran straight to the window, without taking the time to shut the door (in spite of the fact that she was otherwise very considerate in sparing anyone the sight of Gregor’s room), and yanked the window open with eager hands, as if she was almost suffocating, and remained for a while by the window breathing deeply, even when it was still so cold. With this running and noise she frightened Gregor twice every day. The entire time he trembled under the couch, and yet he knew very well that she would certainly have spared him gladly if it had only been possible to remain with the window closed in a room where Gregor lived.","If only Gregor had been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all she was compelled to do for him, he would have found her ministrations easier to bear; as it was, he suffered beneath them. His sister, to be sure, did all she could to obscure the awkwardness of the situation, and the more time passed, the better she succeeded, of course, but Gregor came to see it all more and more clearly. Even the way she made her entrance jangled his nerves. The moment she came in, without even pausing to shut the door—although she always took such pains to shield the others from the sight of Gregor’s room—she would race straightaway to the window and fling it open with hasty hands as though she were on the point of suffocating, then remain standing there, however cold it might be, gulping in the air. All this racing and racket was inflicted on Gregor twice a day; he would be trembling beneath the settee, painfully aware that she would no doubt have willingly spared him this disruption if it were possible for her to endure being in the same room as Gregor with the window closed."
"Und wenn nun auch Gregor durch seine Wunde an Beweglichkeit wahrscheinlich für immer verloren hatte und vorläufig zur Durchquerung seines Zimmers wie ein alter Invalide lange, lange Minuten brauchte – an das Kriechen in der Höhe war nicht zu denken –, so bekam er für diese Verschlimmerung seines Zustandes einen seiner Meinung nach vollständig genügenden Ersatz dadurch, daß immer gegen Abend die Wohnzimmertür, die er schon ein bis zwei Stunden vorher scharf zu beobachten pflegte, geöffnet wurde, so daß er, im Dunkel seines Zimmers liegend, vom Wohnzimmer aus unsichtbar, die ganze Familie beim beleuchteten Tische sehen und ihre Reden, gewissermaßen mit allgemeiner Erlaubnis, also ganz anders als früher, anhören durfte.","And even though Gregor had probably lost his mobility forever through his wound and temporarily needed long, long minutes to cross his room like an old invalid - crawling up high was out of the question - he got his for this aggravation In his opinion, a completely sufficient substitute for his condition was that in the evening the living room door, which he used to keep a close eye on for an hour or two beforehand, was opened so that, lying in the dark of his room, invisible from the living room, he could see the whole See the family at the lighted table and listen to their speeches, with general permission, so to speak, in a completely different way than before.","And now, although Gregor had lost some mobility, most likely permanently due to his injury, and traversing his room now took many long minutes like an old invalid—crawling above floor level was out of the question—he was granted, in his mind, entirely satisfactory compensation for this deterioration of his condition: toward evening every day the living room door, which he got used to watching intently for an hour or two beforehand, was opened, so that lying in the darkness of his room and unseen from the living room, he could view the whole family at the brightly lit table and could listen to their conversation more or less with their consent, completely unlike his prior eavesdropping.","And if through his wound Gregor had now apparently lost for good his ability to move and for the time being needed many many minutes to crawl across this room, like an aged invalid (so far as creeping up high was concerned, that was unimaginable), nevertheless for this worsening of his condition, in his opinion, he did get completely satisfactory compensation, because every day towards evening the door to the living room, which he was in the habit of keeping a sharp eye on even one or two hours beforehand, was opened, so that he, lying down in the darkness of his room, invisible from the living room, could see the entire family at the illuminated table and listen to their conversation, to a certain extent with their common permission, a situation quite different from what happened before.","And even though this wound cost Gregor some of his mobility, probably for good, and for the time being he required many, many minutes to hobble across his room like an old invalid—crawling up the walls was out of the question now—he was compensated for this worsening of his condition by what seemed to him a perfectly adequate substitute: as evening approached, the door to the living room, on which he would start keeping a sharp eye an hour or two beforehand, would always be opened so as to permit him, lying in his own dark room and invisible from the living room, to watch the entire family sitting at the brightly lit table and listen to their conversations now, as it were, in an officially sanctioned capacity and thus quite differently than before."
"Und so brach er denn hervor – die Frauen stützten sich gerade im Nebenzimmer an den Schreibtisch, um ein wenig zu verschnaufen –, wechselte viermal die Richtung des Laufes, er wußte wirklich nicht, was er zuerst retten sollte, da sah er an der im übrigen schon leeren Wand auffallend das Bild der in lauter Pelzwerk gekleideten Dame hängen, kroch eilends hinauf und preßte sich an das Glas, das ihn festhielt und seinem heißen Bauch wohltat. Dieses Bild wenigstens, das Gregor jetzt ganz verdeckte, würde nun gewiß niemand wegnehmen. Er verdrehte den Kopf nach der Tür des Wohnzimmers, um die Frauen bei ihrer Rückkehr zu beobachten.","And so he burst out - the women were leaning against the desk in the next room to catch their breath - changed the direction of the run four times, he really didn't know what to save first, then he looked at the other one hanging the picture of the lady dressed in furs on the empty wall, crept upstairs in haste and pressed himself against the glass, which held him tight and felt good on his hot stomach. At least this picture, which Gregor now completely covered up, would certainly not be taken away by anyone. He cocked his head toward the living room door to watch the women return.","And so he broke out—the women were in the next room, leaning on the desk to catch their breath—and ran in four different directions, not knowing what to save first; then he saw on the otherwise barren wall opposite him the picture of the lady swathed in furs and quickly scrambled up and pressed himself against the glass, a surface he could stick to and that soothed his heated belly. At the very least this picture, which Gregor now completely concealed, would be removed by no one. He twisted his head around to the living room door to observe the women’s return.","And so he scuttled out (the women were just propping themselves up on the writing desk in the next room in order to take a breather) changing the direction of his path four times. He really didn’t know what he should rescue first. Then he saw hanging conspicuously on the wall, which was otherwise already empty, the picture of the woman dressed in nothing but fur. He quickly scurried up over it and pressed himself against the glass that held it in place and which made his hot abdomen feel good. At least this picture, which Gregor at the moment completely concealed, surely no one would now take away. He twisted his head towards the door of the living room to observe the women as they came back in.","And so he burst out of hiding—the women in the next room were just leaning on the desk to catch their breath—changing direction four times as he raced about, for he really didn’t know what to save first, but then his eyes lit on the picture of the lady clad all in furs, conspicuous now on the otherwise empty wall, and quickly he made his way up to it and pressed himself against the glass, which adhered to him, pleasantly cool against his hot belly. At least this picture, which Gregor’s body now covered up completely, was absolutely certain not to be taken away from him. He swiveled his head toward the living room door to observe the women as they returned."
"Gregor sah ein, daß er den Prokuristen in dieser Stimmung auf keinen Fall weggehen lassen dürfe, wenn dadurch seine Stellung im Geschäft nicht aufs äußerste gefährdet werden sollte. Die Eltern verstanden das alles nicht so gut; sie hatten sich in den langen Jahren die Überzeugung gebildet, daß Gregor in diesem Geschäft für sein Leben versorgt war, und hatten außerdem jetzt mit den augenblicklichen Sorgen so viel zu tun, daß ihnen jede Voraussicht abhanden gekommen war. Aber Gregor hatte diese Voraussicht. Der Prokurist mußte gehalten, beruhigt, überzeugt und schließlich gewonnen werden; die Zukunft Gregors und seiner Familie hing doch davon ab! Wäre doch die Schwester hier gewesen! Sie war klug; sie hatte schon geweint, als Gregor noch ruhig auf dem Rücken lag. Und gewiß hätte der Prokurist, dieser Damenfreund, sich von ihr lenken lassen; sie hätte die Wohnungstür zugemacht und ihm im Vorzimmer den Schrecken ausgeredet. Aber die Schwester war eben nicht da, Gregor selbst mußte handeln. Und ohne daran zu denken, daß er seine gegenwärtigen Fähigkeiten, sich zu bewegen, noch gar nicht kannte, ohne auch daran zu denken, daß seine Rede möglicher- ja wahrscheinlicherweise wieder nicht verstanden worden war, verließ er den Türflügel; schob sich durch die Öffnung; wollte zum Prokuristen hingehen, der sich schon am Geländer des Vorplatzes lächerlicherweise mit beiden Händen festhielt; fiel aber sofort, nach einem Halt suchend, mit einem kleinen Schrei auf seine vielen Beinchen nieder. Kaum war das geschehen, fühlte er zum erstenmal an diesem Morgen ein körperliches Wohlbehagen; die Beinchen hatten festen Boden unter sich; sie gehorchten vollkommen, wie er zu seiner Freude merkte; strebten sogar darnach, ihn fortzutragen, wohin er wollte; und schon glaubte er, die endgültige Besserung alles Leidens stehe unmittelbar bevor. Aber im gleichen Augenblick, als er da schaukelnd vor verhaltener Bewegung, gar nicht weit von seiner Mutter entfernt, ihr gerade gegenüber auf dem Boden lag, sprang diese, die doch so ganz in sich versunken schien, mit einemmale in die Höhe, die Arme weit ausgestreckt, die Finger gespreizt, rief: »Hilfe, um Gottes willen Hilfe!«, hielt den Kopf geneigt, als wolle sie Gregor besser sehen, lief aber, im Widerspruch dazu, sinnlos zurück; hatte vergessen, daß hinter ihr der gedeckte Tisch stand; setzte sich, als sie bei ihm angekommen war, wie in Zerstreutheit, eilig auf ihn, und schien gar nicht zu merken, daß neben ihr aus der umgeworfenen großen Kanne der Kaffee in vollem Strome auf den Teppich sich ergoß.","Gregor saw that he shouldn't let the chief clerk go away in this mood if this didn't endanger his position in the business to the extreme. The parents didn't understand all that very well; over the years they had become convinced that Gregor was provided for life in this business, and besides they were so busy with the worries of the moment that they had lost all foresight. But Gregor had this foresight. The manager had to be kept, calmed down, persuaded and finally won over; the future of Gregory and his family depended on it! If only my sister had been here! She was smart; she had already been crying while Gregor was still lying quietly on his back. And the general manager, that lady friend, would certainly have let her guide him; she would have closed the apartment door and talked him out of the shock in the anteroom. But his sister wasn't there, Gregor had to act himself. And without thinking that he didn't yet know his present ability to move, without also thinking that his speech might, yes probably, again, had not been understood, he left the door; slipped through the opening; wanted to go to the general manager who, ridiculously, was already holding on to the railing of the forecourt with both hands; but immediately fell down on its many little legs with a little cry, looking for something to hold on to. No sooner had that happened than he felt physical well-being for the first time that morning; the little legs had solid ground under them; they obeyed perfectly, he found to his delight; even strove to carry him wherever he wished; and already he believed that the final improvement of all suffering was imminent. But at the same moment as he was lying on the ground, not far from his mother, rocking from restrained movement, directly opposite her, she, who seemed so completely absorbed in herself, suddenly jumped up, arms wide stretched out, fingers spread, cried: ""Help, for God's sake help!"", tilted her head as if to get a better look at Gregor, but, contrary to this, ran back senselessly; had forgotten that the laid table was behind her; When she reached him she hurriedly sat down on him, as if absent-minded, and didn't seem to notice that next to her the coffee from the overturned large pot was pouring in a full stream onto the carpet.","Gregor realized that he must on no account let the head clerk leave in this frame of mind or his position in the firm would be seriously jeopardized. The parents did not understand this so well; they had convinced themselves over the years that Gregor was set for life at this firm, and besides, they were so preoccupied with the current problem that they had lost all sense of the future. But Gregor did have this foresight. The head clerk had to be detained, calmed, persuaded, and ultimately won over; the very future of Gregor and his family depended on it. If only the sister had been there! She was perceptive; she had already begun to cry when Gregor was still lying quietly on his back. And the head clerk, that ladies’ man, would certainly have let her guide him; she would have closed the apartment door and assuaged his fears in the foyer. But the sister was not there and Gregor would have to handle the situation himself. And without stopping to think that he still had no idea what powers of movement he had or even to think that very possibly—indeed probably—his words would once again be unintelligible, he let go of the wing of the door and flung himself through the opening; desiring to go toward the head clerk, who was already on the landing and ludicrously clutching the banister with both hands, Gregor instead, while groping for support, fell with a little cry onto his numerous little legs. This had barely happened when, for the first time that morning, he felt a sense of physical well-being: The little legs had firm ground beneath them, he was delighted to note that they were completely under his command, they even strained to carry him off wherever he might desire, and he already believed that the final alleviation of all his grief was imminent. But at that same moment, as he lay there rocking from his restrained movement not far from his mother—in fact just in front of her—she, who had seemed so self-absorbed, suddenly sprang up with arms wide and fingers outstretched, shouting: “Help, for God’s sake, help!” She bent her head down as if to see Gregor better but instead ran contradictorily and madly backward and, having forgotten that the laden table stood behind her, sat down on it thoughtlessly and hastily, seemingly oblivious to the large overturned coffee pot next to her from which coffee was pouring in a steady stream onto the carpet.","Gregor realized that he must not under any circumstances allow the manager to go away in this frame of mind, especially if his position in the firm was not to be placed in the greatest danger. His parents did not understand all this very well. Over the long years, they had developed the conviction that Gregor was set up for life in his firm and, in addition, they had so much to do nowadays with their present troubles that all foresight was foreign to them. But Gregor had this foresight. The manager must be held back, calmed down, convinced, and finally won over. The future of Gregor and his family really depended on it! If only the sister had been there! She was clever. She had already cried while Gregor was still lying quietly on his back. And the manager, this friend of the ladies, would certainly let himself be guided by her. She would have closed the door to the apartment and talked him out of his fright in the hall. But the sister was not even there. Gregor must deal with it himself. Without thinking that as yet he didn’t know anything about his present ability to move and without thinking that his speech possibly (indeed probably) had once again not been understood, he left the wing of the door, pushed himself through the opening, and wanted to go over to the manager, who was already holding tight onto the handrail with both hands on the landing in a ridiculous way. But as he looked for something to hold onto, with a small scream Gregor immediately fell down onto his numerous little legs. Scarcely had this happened, when he felt for the first time that morning a general physical well being. The small limbs had firm floor under them; they obeyed perfectly, as he noticed to his joy, and strove to carry him forward in the direction he wanted. Right away he believed that the final amelioration of all his suffering was immediately at hand. But at the very moment when he lay on the floor rocking in a restrained manner quite close and directly across from his mother (apparently totally sunk into herself) she suddenly sprang right up with her arms spread far apart and her fingers extended and cried out, ‘Help, for God’s sake, help!’ She held her head bowed down, as if she wanted to view Gregor better, but ran senselessly back, contradicting that gesture, forgetting that behind her stood the table with all the dishes on it. When she reached the table, she sat down heavily on it, as if absent-mindedly, and did not appear to notice at all that next to her coffee was pouring out onto the carpet in a full stream from the large overturned container.","Gregor realized he could not possibly allow the general manager to depart in his present frame of mind if his own position at the firm was not to be put in the gravest jeopardy. His parents didn’t fully comprehend his situation: over these long years they had formed the conviction that Gregor was provided for in this office for life, and besides they were so preoccupied with their present worries that they were bereft of all foresight. But Gregor had this foresight. The general manager would have to be detained, reasoned with, convinced and finally won over; after all, Gregor’s future and that of his family depended on it. If only his sister were here! She was clever; she had already begun to weep while Gregor was still lying quietly on his back. And surely the general manager, ever the ladies’ man, would have let himself be assuaged by her; she would have closed the front door of the apartment and talked him out of his fear in the vestibule. But his sister was not there, so Gregor himself would have to act. And without stopping to consider that he was not yet familiar with his current abilities with respect to locomotion, nor even taking into account the fact that this last speech of his had quite possibly—indeed probably—eluded comprehension, he let go of the door; forced his way through the opening; meant to walk over to where the general manager, already out on the landing, was foolishly clutching at the banister with both hands; but right away, groping in vain for something to catch hold of, he fell with a faint shriek upon his many little legs. No sooner had this occurred than he felt —for the first time all morning—a sense of physical well-being; his legs had solid ground beneath them; they obeyed his will perfectly, as he noted to his delight; they even strove to bear him wherever he wished; and already it seemed to him he would soon be delivered from all his sufferings. But as he lay there on the floor directly in front of his mother and not far from her, swaying with mobility held in check, she suddenly leapt up—rapt as she had appeared within her own contemplations—leapt high up into the air, her arms thrust wide, fingers spread, crying out: “Help me, for God’s sake, help!” her head cocked at an angle, as if to see Gregor better, but then, contradicting this, she senselessly retreated; but she had forgotten the table set for breakfast just behind her; sat down hurriedly upon it as soon as she reached it, as if absentmindedly; and didn’t seem to notice that the big overturned coffeepot beside her was pouring a thick stream of coffee on the rug."
"Dort blieb er die ganze Nacht, die er zum Teil im Halbschlaf, aus dem ihn der Hunger immer wieder aufschreckte, verbrachte, zum Teil aber in Sorgen und undeutlichen Hoffnungen, die aber alle zu dem Schlusse führten, daß er sich vorläufig ruhig verhalten und durch Geduld und größte Rücksichtnahme der Familie die Unannehmlichkeiten erträglich machen müsse, die er ihr in seinem gegenwärtigen Zustand nun einmal zu verursachen gezwungen war.","There he stayed the whole night, which he spent partly half asleep, from which hunger kept waking him up, but partly in worries and vague hopes, all of which led to the conclusion that he should keep quiet for the time being and carry on Patience and the utmost consideration of the family must make bearable the inconveniences that he was forced to cause them in his present condition.","There he stayed the whole night, sometimes dozing but then waking up with a start from hunger pains; sometimes he worried and entertained vague hopes, but it all led him to the same conclusion: For now he must lie low and try, through patience and the greatest consideration, to help his family bear the inconvenience he was bound to cause them in his present condition.","There he remained the entire night, which he spent partly in a state of semi-sleep, out of which his hunger constantly woke him with a start, but partly in a state of worry and murky hopes, which all led to the conclusion that for the time being he would have to keep calm and with patience and the greatest consideration for his family tolerate the troubles which in his present condition he was now forced to cause them.","Here he remained the entire night, which he spent by turns dozing—though he was woken again and again by his hunger—and mulling over his worries and indistinct hopes, which however all led to the conclusion that, for the time being, he should behave calmly and, by employing patience and the utmost consideration, assist his family in enduring the inconveniences his current state inevitably forced him to impose on them."
"Da er die Türe auf diese Weise öffnen mußte, war sie eigentlich schon recht weit geöffnet, und er selbst noch nicht zu sehen. Er mußte sich erst langsam um den einen Türflügel herumdrehen, und zwar sehr vorsichtig, wenn er nicht gerade vor dem Eintritt ins Zimmer plump auf den Rücken fallen wollte. Er war noch mit jener schwierigen Bewegung beschäftigt und hatte nicht Zeit, auf anderes zu achten, da hörte er schon den Prokuristen ein lautes »Oh!« ausstoßen – es klang, wie wenn der Wind saust – und nun sah er ihn auch, wie er, der der Nächste an der Türe war, die Hand gegen den offenen Mund drückte und langsam zurückwich, als vertreibe ihn eine unsichtbare, gleichmäßig fortwirkende Kraft. Die Mutter – sie stand hier trotz der Anwesenheit des Prokuristen mit von der Nacht her noch aufgelösten, hoch sich sträubenden Haaren – sah zuerst mit gefalteten Händen den Vater an, ging dann zwei Schritte zu Gregor hin und fiel inmitten ihrer rings um sie herum sich ausbreitenden Röcke nieder, das Gesicht ganz unauffindbar zu ihrer Brust gesenkt. Der Vater ballte mit feindseligem Ausdruck die Faust, als wolle er Gregor in sein Zimmer zurückstoßen, sah sich dann unsicher im Wohnzimmer um, beschattete dann mit den Händen die Augen und weinte, daß sich seine mächtige Brust schüttelte.","Since he had to open the door in this way, it was actually quite wide open and he himself could not yet be seen. First he had to turn slowly around one of the doors, and very carefully, lest he fall clumsily on his back just before entering the room. He was still busy with that difficult movement and didn't have time to pay attention to anything else when he heard the chief clerk utter a loud ""Oh!"" - it sounded like the wind was blowing - and now he saw him, too , who was next to the door, pressed his hand to his open mouth and backed away slowly, as if driven away by some invisible, steady force. The mother - despite the presence of the general manager she was standing here with her hair still loose and standing on end - first looked at the father with folded hands, then took two steps towards Gregor and fell in the midst of her spreading out around her Skirts down, face all untraceable lowered to her chest. The father clenched his fist with a hostile expression, as if he wanted to push Gregor back into his room, then looked around uncertainly in the living room, then shaded his eyes with his hands and wept so that his mighty chest shook.","Since he had to pull the door open in this way, it was opened quite wide while he himself still could not be seen. He first had to slowly circumnavigate one of the double doors and do it very carefully so as not to flop onto his back before entering the room. He was still busy with this involved maneuver and had no time to be distracted by anything else when he heard the head clerk burst out with a loud “Oh!”—it sounded like a gust of wind—and now he also saw the head clerk, standing closest to the door, pressing his hand against his open mouth and backing away slowly as if repelled by an invisible and relentless force.4 The mother—standing there, despite the presence of the head clerk, with her hair still undone and bristling all over—first looked at the father with clasped hands, then took two steps toward Gregor and fell down amid her billowing skirts, her face sinking out of sight onto her breast. The father, furiously shaking his fists as if willing Gregor to go back in his room, looked uncertainly around the living room, covered his eyes in his hands, and sobbed with great heaves of his powerful chest.","Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already open very wide without him yet being really visible. He first had to turn himself slowly around the edge of the door, very carefully, of course, if he did not want to fall awkwardly on his back right at the entrance into the room. He was still preoccupied with this difficult movement and had no time to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the manager exclaim a loud ‘Oh!’ (it sounded like the wind whistling), and now he saw him, nearest to the door, pressing his hand against his open mouth and moving slowly back, as if an invisible constant force was pushing him away. His mother (in spite of the presence of the manager she was standing here with her hair sticking up on end, still a mess from the night) with her hands clasped was looking at his father; she then went two steps towards Gregor and collapsed right in the middle of her skirts spreading out all around her, her face sunk on her breast, completely concealed. His father clenched his fist with a hostile expression, as if he wished to push Gregor back into his room, then looked uncertainly around the living room, covered his eyes with his hands, and cried so that his mighty breast shook.","But he remained hidden from view as the door swung toward him, even after it was wide open. To be seen, he had to work his way slowly around one of the wings of the double door, a delicate operation if he wanted to avoid plopping down awkwardly on his back before he’d even entered the room. He was still occupied with this difficult maneuver and had no leisure to attend to anything else when he heard the general manager utter a loud “Oh!”—it sounded like wind howling—and now he saw him too, saw how the general manager, who was standing closest to the door, pressed his hand to his open mouth, slowly retreating, as though being driven back by an invisible, steady force. Gregor’s mother—who despite the general manager’s presence stood with her hair still undone from the night, wildly bristling—first looked over at his father, her hands clasped, then took two steps in Gregor’s direction before falling down in the midst of all her billowing skirts, her face vanishing completely where it sank to her bosom. Gregor’s father clenched his fist with a hostile grimace, as if he intended to thrust Gregor back into his room, then glanced uncertainly about the living room, shaded his eyes with his hands, and wept until his mighty chest shook."
"»Ach Gott,« dachte er, »was für einen anstrengenden Beruf habe ich gewählt! Tag aus, Tag ein auf der Reise. Die geschäftlichen Aufregungen sind viel größer, als im eigentlichen Geschäft zu Hause, und außerdem ist mir noch diese Plage des Reisens auferlegt, die Sorgen um die Zuganschlüsse, das unregelmäßige, schlechte Essen, ein immer wechselnder, nie andauernder, nie herzlich werdender menschlicher Verkehr. Der Teufel soll das alles holen!« Er fühlte ein leichtes Jucken oben auf dem Bauch; schob sich auf dem Rücken langsam näher zum Bettpfosten, um den Kopf besser heben zu können; fand die juckende Stelle, die mit lauter kleinen weißen Pünktchen besetzt war, die er nicht zu beurteilen verstand; und wollte mit einem Bein die Stelle betasten, zog es aber gleich zurück, denn bei der Berührung umwehten ihn Kälteschauer.","'Oh God,' he thought, 'what a tiring job I've chosen! Day out, day in on the journey. The business excitement is much greater than in the actual business at home, and in addition I have this nuisance of travel imposed on me, the worries about the train connections, the irregular, bad food, an ever-changing, never-lasting, never-hearted human intercourse. The devil take it all!' He felt a slight itching on the top of his stomach; slowly slid closer to the bedpost on her back to get her head up better; found the itchy spot covered in little white dots he didn't know how to judge; and wanted to feel the spot with one leg, but pulled it back immediately, because the touch sent chills around him.","“Oh God,” he thought, “what a grueling profession I picked! Traveling day in, day out. It is much more aggravating work than the actual business done at the home office, and then with the strain of constant travel as well: the worry over train connections, the bad and irregular meals, the steady stream of faces who never become anything closer than acquaintances. The Devil take it all!” He felt a slight itching up on his belly and inched on his back closer to the bedpost to better lift his head. He located the itching spot, which was surrounded by many tiny white dots that were incomprehensible to him, and tried to probe the area with one of his legs but immediately drew it back, for the touch sent an icy shiver through him.","‘O God,’ he thought, ‘what a demanding job I’ve chosen! Day in, day out on the road. The stresses of trade are much greater than the work going on at head office, and, in addition to that, I have to deal with the problems of traveling, the worries about train connections, irregular bad food, temporary and constantly changing human relationships which never come from the heart. To hell with it all!’ He felt a slight itching on the top of his abdomen. He slowly pushed himself on his back closer to the bed post so that he could lift his head more easily, found the itchy part, which was entirely covered with small white spots (he did not know what to make of them), and wanted to feel the place with a leg. But he retracted it immediately, for the contact felt like a cold shower all over him.","“Good Lord,” he thought, “what an exhausting profession I’ve chosen. Day in and day out on the road. Work like this is far more unsettling than business conducted at home, and then I have the agony of traveling itself to contend with: worrying about train connections, the irregular, unpalatable meals, and human intercourse that is constantly changing, never developing the least constancy or warmth. Devil take it all!” He felt a faint itch high up on his belly; still on his back, he laboriously edged himself over to the bedpost so he could raise his head more easily; identified the site of the itch: a cluster of tiny white dots he was unable to judge; and wanted to probe the spot with a leg, but drew it back again at once, for the touch sent cold shivers rippling through him."
"Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Träumen erwachte, fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt. Er lag auf seinem panzerartig harten Rücken und sah, wenn er den Kopf ein wenig hob, seinen gewölbten, braunen, von bogenförmigen Versteifungen geteilten Bauch, auf dessen Höhe sich die Bettdecke, zum gänzlichen Niedergleiten bereit, kaum noch erhalten konnte. Seine vielen, im Vergleich zu seinem sonstigen Umfang kläglich dünnen Beine flimmerten ihm hilflos vor den Augen.","When Gregor Samsa awoke from restless dreams one morning, he found himself transformed into a monstrous vermin in his bed. He lay on his armour-hard back and, when he lifted his head a little, saw his bulging, brown belly, divided by arched reinforcements, at the height of which the bedclothes, ready to slide off completely, could hardly be maintained. His many legs, miserably thin compared to his usual size, flickered helplessly before his eyes.","AS GREGOR SAMSA AWOKE from unsettling dreams one morning, he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous vermin. 1 He lay on his hard armorlike back and when he raised his head a little he saw his vaulted brown belly divided into sections by stiff arches from whose height the coverlet had already slipped and was about to slide off completely. His many legs, which were pathetically thin compared to the rest of his bulk, flickered helplessly before his eyes.","One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug. He lay on his ar-mour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like sec-tions. From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place. His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circum-ference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.","WHEN GREGOR SAMSA WOKE ONE MORNING from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed right there in his bed into some sort of monstrous insect. He was lying on his back—which was hard, like a carapace—and when he raised his head a little he saw his curved brown belly segmented by rigid arches atop which the blanket, already slipping, was just barely managing to cling. His many legs, pitifully thin compared to the rest of him, waved helplessly before his eyes."
"Als Gregor schon zur Hälfte aus dem Bette ragte – die neue Methode war mehr ein Spiel als eine Anstrengung, er brauchte immer nur ruckweise zu schaukeln –, fiel ihm ein, wie einfach alles wäre, wenn man ihm zu Hilfe käme. Zwei starke Leute – er dachte an seinen Vater und das Dienstmädchen – hätten vollständig genügt; sie hätten ihre Arme nur unter seinen gewölbten Rücken schieben, ihn so aus dem Bett schälen, sich mit der Last niederbeugen und dann bloß vorsichtig dulden müssen, daß er den Überschwung auf dem Fußboden vollzog, wo dann die Beinchen hoffentlich einen Sinn bekommen würden. Nun, ganz abgesehen davon, daß die Türen versperrt waren, hätte er wirklich um Hilfe rufen sollen? Trotz aller Not konnte er bei diesem Gedanken ein Lächeln nicht unterdrücken.","When Gregor was halfway out of bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort, he only had to rock in jerks - it occurred to him how easy everything would be if someone helped him. Two strong men—he thought of his father and the maid—would have been quite enough; all they had to do was slip their arms under his arched back, pull him out of bed like that, bend down with the burden, and then just carefully let him do the overswing on the floor, where hopefully the little legs would then make sense. Well, apart from the fact that the doors were locked, should he really have called for help? Despite all his hardship, he couldn't suppress a smile at this thought.","When Gregor was sticking halfway out of the bed—the new method was less a struggle than a game, he had only to inch along by rocking back and forth—it struck him how much easier it would be if someone came to help. Two strong people—he thought of his father and the maid—would surely suffice: They would only have to slip their arms under his curved back to lift him from the bed, bend down with their burden, and be patient and watchful while he engineered his swing over to the floor, where he hoped his tiny legs would find some purpose. Now, putting aside the fact that all the doors were locked, should he really call for help? Despite his predicament, he could not suppress a smile at these thoughts.","As Gregor was in the process of lifting himself half out of bed (the new method was more of a game than an effort; he needed only to rock with a constant rhythm) it struck him how easy all this would be if someone were to come to his aid. Two strong people (he thought of his father and the servant girl) would have been quite sufficient. They would have only had to push their arms under his arched back to get him out of the bed, to bend down with their load, and then merely to exercise patience and care that he completed the flip onto the floor, where his diminutive legs would then, he hoped, acquire a purpose. Now, quite apart from the fact that the doors were locked, should he really call out for help? In spite of all his distress, he was unable to suppress a smile at this idea.","By the time Gregor was already protruding halfway out of bed—this new method was more a game than a struggle, all he had to do was keep rocking sideways a little at a time—it occurred to him how simple things would be if only someone came to his aid.

But even aside from the fact that the doors were locked, should he really call for help? Despite his distress, he couldn’t help smiling at the thought."
"Allerdings achtete auch niemand auf ihn. Die Familie war gänzlich vom Violinspiel in Anspruch genommen; die Zimmerherren dagegen, die zunächst, die Hände in den Hosentaschen, viel zu nahe hinter dem Notenpult der Schwester sich aufgestellt hatten, so daß sie alle in die Noten hätte sehen können, was sicher die Schwester stören mußte, zogen sich bald unter halblauten Gesprächen mit gesenkten Köpfen zum Fenster zurück, wo sie, vom Vater besorgt beobachtet, auch blieben. Es hatte nun wirklich den überdeutlichen Anschein, als wären sie in ihrer Annahme, ein schönes oder unterhaltendes Violinspiel zu hören, enttäuscht, hätten die ganze Vorführung satt und ließen sich nur aus Höflichkeit noch in ihrer Ruhe stören. Besonders die Art, wie sie alle aus Nase und Mund den Rauch ihrer Zigarren in die Höhe bliesen, ließ auf große Nervosität schließen. Und doch spielte die Schwester so schön. Ihr Gesicht war zur Seite geneigt, prüfend und traurig folgten ihre Blicke den Notenzeilen. Gregor kroch noch ein Stück vorwärts und hielt den Kopf eng an den Boden, um möglicherweise ihren Blicken begegnen zu können. War er ein Tier, da ihn Musik so ergriff? Ihm war, als zeige sich ihm der Weg zu der ersehnten unbekannten Nahrung. Er war entschlossen, bis zur Schwester vorzudringen, sie am Rock zu zupfen und ihr dadurch anzudeuten, sie möge doch mit ihrer Violine in sein Zimmer kommen, denn niemand lohnte hier das Spiel so, wie er es lohnen wollte. Er wollte sie nicht mehr aus seinem Zimmer lassen, wenigstens nicht, solange er lebte; seine Schreckgestalt sollte ihm zum erstenmal nützlich werden; an allen Türen seines Zimmers wollte er gleichzeitig sein und den Angreifern entgegenfauchen; die Schwester aber sollte nicht gezwungen, sondern freiwillig bei ihm bleiben; sie sollte neben ihm auf dem Kanapee sitzen, das Ohr zu ihm herunterneigen, und er wollte ihr dann anvertrauen, daß er die feste Absicht gehabt habe, sie auf das Konservatorium zu schicken, und daß er dies, wenn nicht das Unglück dazwischen gekommen wäre, vergangene Weihnachten – Weihnachten war doch wohl schon vorüber? – allen gesagt hätte, ohne sich um irgendwelche Widerreden zu kümmern. Nach dieser Erklärung würde die Schwester in Tränen der Rührung ausbrechen, und Gregor würde sich bis zu ihrer Achsel erheben und ihren Hals küssen, den sie, seitdem sie ins Geschäft ging, frei ohne Band oder Kragen trug.","However, no one paid any attention to him. The family was completely occupied with playing the violin; the landlords, on the other hand, who had initially stood with their hands in their pockets, much too close behind the sister's music stand so that they could all see the music, which must have disturbed the sister, soon moved along, murmuring conversations back to the window with their heads bowed, where they stayed, watched by their father with concern. It really seemed that they were disappointed in their expectation that they were hearing a beautiful or entertaining violin performance, that they were fed up with the whole performance and only allowed themselves to be disturbed out of politeness. Especially the way they all blew the smoke from their cigars out of their noses and mouths suggested that they were very nervous. And yet the sister played so beautifully. Her face was tilted to the side, examining and sadly her eyes followed the staves. Gregor crawled a little further and kept his head close to the ground in order to be able to possibly meet their eyes. Was he an animal when music affected him so? He felt as if the way to the longed-for unknown food was showing him. He was determined to get as far as his sister, to tug at her skirt and thus to indicate to her that she should come into his room with her violin, for nobody here rewarded the game as much as he wanted it to be rewarded. He didn't want to let her out of his room, at least not while he was alive; his terrible form was to be of use to him for the first time; he wanted to be on all the doors of his room at the same time and snarl at the attackers; but the sister should not be forced to stay with him, but voluntarily; She was supposed to sit next to him on the couch, with her ear bent to him, and he would then confide in her that he had had the firm intention of sending her to the conservatory and that he would have done so if misfortune had not intervened. past Christmas – surely Christmas was already over? – would have said to everyone without caring about any arguments. After this explanation, the sister would burst into tears of emotion, and Gregor would rise to her armpit and kiss her neck, which since she went to the shop she had worn free without a ribbon or collar.","No one, to be sure, paid him any mind. The family was completely absorbed by the violin playing; the boarders on the other hand had at first stood with their hands in their pockets so close behind the sister that they could all have read the music, which must have irritated her, but they soon withdrew to the window and stayed there with lowered heads and half-heard grumblings while the father eyed them nervously. Indeed it was more than obvious that their hopes of hearing the violin played well or entertainingly were disappointed, that they had had enough of the recital and were only suffering through this disturbance of their peace out of politeness. In particular, the manner in which they blew their clouds of cigar smoke to the ceiling through their mouths and noses displayed severe aggravation. And yet the sister played so beautifully. Her face was tilted to one side and she followed the notes with soulful and probing eyes. Gregor advanced a little, keeping his eyes low so that they might possibly meet hers. Was he a beast if music could move him so? He felt as though the path to his unknown hungers was being cleared. He was grimly determined to reach the sister and tug on her skirt to suggest that she take her violin and come into his room, for no one here was as worthy of her playing as he would be. He would never let her leave his room, at least as long as he lived; for the first time, his horrifying appearance would work to his advantage: He would stand guard at all the doors simultaneously, hissing at the attackers; the sister, however, would not be forcibly detained but would stay with him of her own free will. She would sit beside him on the sofa, she would lean down and listen as he confided how he had intended to send her to the Conservatory and how, if misfortune had not interfered, he would have announced this plan to everyone last Christmas—had Christmas really passed already?—and brooked no argument. After this declaration the sister would burst into emotional tears and Gregor would raise himself to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which she kept bare since she started working, wearing no ribbon or collar.","In any case, no one paid him any attention. The family was all caught up in the violin playing. The lodgers, by contrast, who for the moment had placed themselves, their hands in their trouser pockets, behind the music stand much too close to the sister, so that they could all see the sheet music, something that must certainly bother the sister, soon drew back to the window conversing in low voices with bowed heads, where they then remained, worriedly observed by the father. It now seemed really clear that, having assumed they were to hear a beautiful or entertaining violin recital, they were disappointed, and were allowing their peace and quiet to be disturbed only out of politeness. The way in which they all blew the smoke from their cigars out of their noses and mouths in particular led one to conclude that they were very irritated. And yet his sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was turned to the side, her gaze followed the score intently and sadly. Gregor crept forward still a little further and kept his head close against the floor in order to be able to catch her gaze if possible. Was he an animal that music so seized him? For him it was as if the way to the unknown nourishment he craved was revealing itself to him. He was determined to press forward right to his sister, to tug at her dress and to indicate to her in this way that she might still come with her violin into his room, because here no one valued the recital as he wanted to value it. He did not wish to let her go from his room any more, at least not as long as he lived. His frightening appearance would for the first time become useful for him. He wanted to be at all the doors of his room simultaneously and snarl back at the attackers. However, his sister should not be compelled but would remain with him voluntarily; she would sit next to him on the sofa, bend down her ear to him, and he would then confide in her that he firmly intended to send her to the conservatory and that, if his misfortune had not arrived in the interim, he would have declared all this last Christmas (had Christmas really already come and gone?), and would have brooked no argument. After this explanation his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would lift himself up to her armpit and kiss her throat, which she, from the time she started going to work, had left exposed without a band or a collar.","To be sure, no one paid him the slightest heed. The family was completely absorbed in the violin playing; the lodgers, on the other hand, having at first positioned themselves, hands in their trouser pockets, much too close behind his sister’s music stand, so that they could all look at the sheet music, which surely must have distracted her, soon withdrew to the window, conversing in an undertone, and remained there, anxiously observed by Gregor’s father. It appeared more than clear they had been disappointed in their expectation of hearing beautiful or entertaining violin music and now, tired of the whole performance, were continuing to tolerate this disturbance of their peace only out of politeness. Particularly the way in which all of them were blowing the smoke of their cigars high into the air from their noses and mouths suggested extreme agitation. And yet his sister’s playing was so lovely. Her face was tilted to one side; searchingly, sadly, her eyes followed the lines of notes. Gregor crept a bit farther forward and ducked his head down close to the floor so as perhaps to catch her eye. Was he a beast, that music so moved him? He felt as if he were being shown the way to that unknown nourishment he craved. He was determined to creep all the way up to his sister, to pluck at her skirt and in this way indicate to her that she should come to his room with her violin, for no one here was rewarding her playing as he meant to reward her. He would not allow her to leave his room ever again, at least as long as he was alive; his horrific figure would, for the first time ever, be useful to him; he would be at all the doors of his room at once, growling at his attackers; but his sister should remain with him not by force but of her own free will; she should sit beside him on the settee, bend down, the better to hear, and he would confess to her that he’d had the firm intention of sending her to the Conservatory and that if the disaster had not disrupted his plans, he would have made a general announcement last Christmas— Christmas had passed now, hadn’t it?—without letting himself be swayed by objections of any sort. After this declaration, his sister would be moved to the point of tears, and Gregor would raise himself to the height of her armpit and kiss her throat, which, now that she went to the office every day, she wore free of ribbon or collar."
"Mit welchen Ausreden man an jenem ersten Vormittag den Arzt und den Schlosser wieder aus der Wohnung geschafft hatte, konnte Gregor gar nicht erfahren, denn da er nicht verstanden wurde, dachte niemand daran, auch die Schwester nicht, daß er die anderen verstehen könne, und so mußte er sich, wenn die Schwester in seinem Zimmer war, damit begnügen, nur hier und da ihre Seufzer und Anrufe der Heiligen zu hören. Erst später, als sie sich ein wenig an alles gewöhnt hatte – von vollständiger Gewöhnung konnte natürlich niemals die Rede sein –, erhaschte Gregor manchmal eine Bemerkung, die freundlich gemeint war oder so gedeutet werden konnte. »Heute hat es ihm aber geschmeckt,« sagte sie, wenn Gregor unter dem Essen tüchtig aufgeräumt hatte, während sie im gegenteiligen Fall, der sich allmählich immer häufiger wiederholte, fast traurig zu sagen pflegte: »Nun ist wieder alles stehengeblieben.«","Gregor could not find out what excuses were used to get the doctor and the locksmith out of the apartment that first morning, because since he was not understood, nobody, not even the nurse, thought that he could understand the others and so, when the sister was in his room, he had to be content with hearing her sighs and invocations of the saints only here and there. Only later, when she had gotten used to everything a little - of course one could never speak of complete habituation - did Gregor sometimes catch a remark that was meant in a friendly way or could be interpreted as such. ""But today he liked it,"" she said when Gregor had cleaned up a good deal under the food, while in the opposite case, which was gradually being repeated more and more often, she used to say almost sadly: ""Now everything has stopped again.""","Gregor had no idea what excuse was used that first morning to put off the doctor and locksmith, because as no one could understand him, no one thought, including the sister, that he could understand them, and so he had to content himself, whenever his sister was in the room, with hearing a sigh now and then or an appeal to the saints. A little time later, when she was a bit more at ease—of course it was never a question of being completely at ease—Gregor sometimes caught a remark that was meant kindly or at least could be so considered. “Oh, he enjoyed it today,” she said when Gregor had eaten well, or when he had not, which was more frequently the case, she would say almost sadly, “It’s all been left again.”","What sorts of excuses people had used on that first morning to get the doctor and the locksmith out of the house Gregor was completely unable to ascertain. Since he was not comprehensible, no one, not even his sister, thought that he might be able to understand others, and thus, when his sister was in her room, he had to be content with listening now and then to her sighs and invocations to the saints. Only later, when she had grown somewhat accustomed to everything (naturally there could never be any talk of her growing completely accustomed to it) Gregor sometimes caught a comment which was intended to be friendly or could be interpreted as such. ‘ Well, today it tasted good to him,’ she said, if Gregor had really cleaned up what he had to eat; whereas, in the reverse situation, which gradually repeated itself more and more frequently, she used to say sadly, ‘Now everything has stopped again.’","Gregor never learned on what pretext the doctor and locksmith had been sent away that first morning, for since he himself could not be understood, it occurred to no one, not even his sister, that he could understand the others, so when his sister came to his room, he had to be content merely with hearing the sighs she heaved now and then and her words of supplication addressed to the saints. Only later, when she had started to grow accustomed to all of this—though of course it was impossible to become fully accustomed to circumstances like these—would Gregor sometimes catch a remark that was meant in a friendly way or could be interpreted as such. “He tucked right in today,” she would say when Gregor had found the food she left him particularly tasty, while in the opposite case, which gradually began to occur more and more often, she was in the habit of saying almost mournfully: “This time he didn’t touch a thing.”"
"Nun genügte dieses Geld aber ganz und gar nicht, um die Familie etwa von den Zinsen leben zu lassen; es genügte vielleicht, um die Familie ein, höchstens zwei Jahre zu erhalten, mehr war es nicht. Es war also bloß eine Summe, die man eigentlich nicht angreifen durfte, und die für den Notfall zurückgelegt werden mußte; das Geld zum Leben aber mußte man verdienen. Nun war aber der Vater ein zwar gesunder, aber alter Mann, der schon fünf Jahre nichts gearbeitet hatte und sich jedenfalls nicht viel zutrauen durfte; er hatte in diesen fünf Jahren, welche die ersten Ferien seines mühevollen und doch erfolglosen Lebens waren, viel Fett angesetzt und war dadurch recht schwerfällig geworden. Und die alte Mutter sollte nun vielleicht Geld verdienen, die an Asthma litt, der eine Wanderung durch die Wohnung schon Anstrengung verursachte, und die jeden zweiten Tag in Atembeschwerden auf dem Sofa beim offenen Fenster verbrachte? Und die Schwester sollte Geld verdienen, die noch ein Kind war mit ihren siebzehn Jahren, und der ihre bisherige Lebensweise so sehr zu gönnen war, die daraus bestanden hatte, sich nett zu kleiden, lange zu schlafen, in der Wirtschaft mitzuhelfen, an ein paar bescheidenen Vergnügungen sich zu beteiligen und vor allem Violine zu spielen? Wenn die Rede auf diese Notwendigkeit des Geldverdienens kam, ließ zuerst immer Gregor die Türe los und warf sich auf das neben der Tür befindliche kühle Ledersofa, denn ihm war ganz heiß vor Beschämung und Trauer.","However, this money was not at all enough to allow the family to live on the interest; it might have been enough to keep the family going for a year or two at the most, it wasn't much more. So it was just a sum that you really shouldn't touch and that had to be put aside for emergencies; but one had to earn the money to live on. But now the father was a healthy but old man who hadn't worked for five years and in any case didn't dare to do much; he had put on a great deal of fat and become rather sluggish in these five years, which were the first vacations of his toilsome and yet unsuccessful life. And the old mother, who suffered from asthma, which was already exhausting to walk around the apartment, and who spent every other day with breathing difficulties on the sofa by the open window, should now perhaps earn money? And the sister was supposed to earn money, who was still a child at seventeen and who was so happy with her previous way of life, which consisted of dressing nicely, sleeping late, helping out in the house, at a few to participate in humble amusements and above all to play the violin? When the need to earn money was talked about, Gregor always let go of the door first and threw himself on the cool leather sofa next to the door, for he was hot with shame and grief.","However, this money was by no means sufficient to support the family on the interest; the principal might support the family for a year, or two at the most. So it was just a sum that should not be touched, put aside for emergencies, and the money to live on would still need to be earned. Now the father was certainly healthy but an old man who had not worked in five years and could not be expected to do much; during these years, the first leisure time in his laborious albeit unsuccessful life, he had gained a lot of weight and become quite sluggish as a result. And how should the elderly mother earn a living, when she suffered from asthma and even a walk through the apartment was trying, leaving her gasping for breath every other day on the sofa by an open window? And should the sister work, still a child of seventeen whose life had been so pleasant until now—dressing nicely, sleeping late, helping with the housework, enjoying a few modest amusements, and above all playing the violin? At first, whenever the conversation turned to the need to earn money, Gregor let go of the door and threw himself onto the cool leather sofa nearby, he felt so flushed with shame and grief.","At the moment, however, this money was nowhere near sufficient to permit the family to live on the interest pay-ments. Perhaps it would be enough to maintain the family for one or at most two years, that’s all. Thus it came only to an amount which one should not really take out and which must be set aside for an emergency. But the money to live on must be earned. Now, his father was a healthy man, although he was old, who had not worked at all for five years now and thus could not be counted on for very much. He had in these five years, the first holidays of his trouble-filled but unsuccessful life, put on a good deal of fat and thus had become really heavy. And should his old mother now maybe work for money, a woman who suffered from asthma, for whom wandering through the apartment even now was a great strain and who spent every second day on the sofa by the open window labouring for breath? Should his sister earn money, a girl who was still a seventeen-year-old child, whose earlier life style had been so very delightful that it had consisted of dressing herself nicely, sleeping in late, helping around the house, taking part in a few mod-est enjoyments and, above all, playing the violin? When it came to talking about this need to earn money, at first Gregor went away from the door and threw himself on the cool leather sofa beside the door, for he was quite hot from shame and sorrow.","Now this money was by no means sufficient to allow the family to live off the interest or anything of that sort; it might possibly have been enough to sustain the family for a year, two at most, but that’s all there was. So in fact it was the kind of sum one really shouldn’t touch, one to be set aside in case of emergency; the money to live on would have to be earned. Gregor’s father was admittedly in good health, but he was old and hadn’t worked in a full five years, and in any case he was supposed to avoid overtaxing himself; in those five years—the first holiday in his strenuous and yet unsuccessful life—he had put on a lot of weight and now lumbered as he walked. And was Gregor’s old mother now supposed to hold down a job, despite her asthma and the fact that it was already an exertion for her to cross from one end of the apartment to the other, for which reason she spent every second day gasping for breath on the sofa beside the open window? And was his sister to go out working, this child of seventeen whose lifestyle no one would begrudge her: dressing nicely, sleeping late, helping out around the house, taking part in a few modest entertainments, and above all, playing the violin? Whenever the family came to speak of the necessity of someone earning money, Gregor would let go of the door and throw himself down upon the cool leather sofa beside it, burning with shame and sorrow."
"»Herr Samsa,« rief nun der Prokurist mit erhobener Stimme, »was ist denn los? Sie verbarrikadieren sich da in Ihrem Zimmer, antworten bloß mit ja und nein, machen Ihren Eltern schwere, unnötige Sorgen und versäumen – dies nur nebenbei erwähnt – Ihre geschäftlichen Pflichten in einer eigentlich unerhörten Weise. Ich spreche hier im Namen Ihrer Eltern und Ihres Chefs und bitte Sie ganz ernsthaft um eine augenblickliche, deutliche Erklärung. Ich staune, ich staune. Ich glaubte Sie als einen ruhigen, vernünftigen Menschen zu kennen, und nun scheinen Sie plötzlich anfangen zu wollen, mit sonderbaren Launen zu paradieren. Der Chef deutete mir zwar heute früh eine mögliche Erklärung für Ihre Versäumnis an – sie betraf das Ihnen seit kurzem anvertraute Inkasso –, aber ich legte wahrhaftig fast mein Ehrenwort dafür ein, daß diese Erklärung nicht zutreffen könne. Nun aber sehe ich hier Ihren unbegreiflichen Starrsinn und verliere ganz und gar jede Lust, mich auch nur im geringsten für Sie einzusetzen. Und Ihre Stellung ist durchaus nicht die festeste. Ich hatte ursprünglich die Absicht, Ihnen das alles unter vier Augen zu sagen, aber da Sie mich hier nutzlos meine Zeit versäumen lassen, weiß ich nicht, warum es nicht auch Ihre Herren Eltern erfahren sollen. Ihre Leistungen in der letzten Zeit waren also sehr unbefriedigend; es ist zwar nicht die Jahreszeit, um besondere Geschäfte zu machen, das erkennen wir an; aber eine Jahreszeit, um keine Geschäfte zu machen, gibt es überhaupt nicht, Herr Samsa, darf es nicht geben.«","""Mr. Samsa,"" called the manager with a raised voice, ""what's the matter? You're barricading yourself in your room, answering only yes and no, giving your parents serious, needless worries, and, incidentally, neglecting your business responsibilities in an outrageous way. Speaking on behalf of your parents and your boss, I sincerely request an immediate, clear explanation. I'm amazed, I'm amazed. I thought I knew you to be a calm, reasonable person, and now you suddenly seem about to begin parading with strange moods. Although the boss hinted at a possible explanation for your omission this morning - it concerned the debt collection you had recently been entrusted with - I actually gave almost my word of honor that this explanation could not be correct. Now, however, I see your incomprehensible stubbornness and lose all desire to do anything for you. And your position is by no means the strongest. I originally intended to tell you all this in private, but since you're wasting my time here I don't see why your parents shouldn't know it too. So your recent performance has been very unsatisfactory; it is not the season for special business, we recognize that; but there is no such thing as a season when there is no business, Mr. Samsa, there must not be.”","“Mr. Samsa,” the head clerk now called, raising his voice, “what is the matter? You are barricading yourself in your room, giving only yes and no answers, causing your parents serious and unnecessary concern, and neglecting—I just mention this in passing—your professional responsibilities in an outrageous manner. I am speaking here in the name of your parents and your boss, and I seriously beg you to give a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, just astonished. I have always known you to be a quiet, reasonable man and now you suddenly seem to be indulging in rash eccentricities. The Chief did point out a possible explanation for your absence early today—concerning the cash payments that were recently entrusted to you—but in fact I practically gave him my word of honor that this could not be the true explanation. Now, however, I see your incredible obstinacy and have completely lost any desire to intercede on your behalf. And your position is by no means unassailable. I originally intended to speak with you privately, but since you are pointlessly wasting my time, I see no reason why your good parents shouldn’t also hear. Your recent performance has been highly unsatisfactory; it is admittedly not a heavy business season, but a season of no business at all, I assure you, Mr. Samsa, does not exist, cannot exist.”","‘Mr. Samsa,’ the manager was now shouting, his voice raised, ‘what’s the matter? You are barricading yourself in your room, answer with only a yes and a no, are making serious and unnecessary troubles for your parents, and neglecting (I mention this only incidentally) your commercial duties in a truly unheard of manner. I am speaking here in the name of your parents and your employer, and I am requesting you in all seriousness for an immediate and clear explanation. I am amazed. I am amazed. I thought I knew you as a calm, reasonable person, and now you appear suddenly to want to start parading around in weird moods. The Chief indicated to me earlier this very day a possible explanation for your neglect—it concerned the collection of cash entrusted to you a short while ago—but in truth I almost gave him my word of honour that this explanation could not be correct. However, now I see here your unimaginable pig headedness, and I am totally losing any desire to speak up for you in the slightest. And your position is not at all the most secure. Originally I intended to mention all this to you privately, but since you are letting me waste my time here uselessly, I don’t know why the matter shouldn’t come to the attention of your parents. Your productivity has also been very unsatisfactory recently. Of course, it’s not the time of year to conduct exceptional business, we recognize that, but a time of year for conducting no business, there is no such thing at all, Mr. Samsa, and such a thing must never be.’","“Herr Samsa,” the general manager now called out, raising his voice. “What has come over you? You barricade yourself in your room, you reply to queries only with yes and no, you cause your parents onerous, unnecessary worries, and you are neglecting— let me permit myself to note—your professional responsibilities in a truly unprecedented manner. I speak here in the name of your parents as well as your employer and in all seriousness must ask you for a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, utterly astonished. I have always known you as a calm, sensible person, and now it seems you’ve begun to permit yourself the most whimsical extravagances. To be sure, the boss did suggest one possible explanation for your absence this morning—it concerns the cash payments recently entrusted to your care—and truthfully, I all but gave him my word of honor that this explanation could not be correct. But confronted here with your incomprehensible obstinacy, I find myself losing any desire I might have had to come to your defense. And your position is anything but secure. It was originally my intention to discuss all this with you in a private conversation, but since you compel me to waste my time here, I do not know why your esteemed parents should not hear of it as well. In short: your productivity of late has been highly unsatisfactory; admittedly this is not the best season for drumming up business, we do acknowledge this; but a season in which no business at all is drummed up is something that does not, and indeed may not exist, Herr Samsa.”"
"»Mutter, Mutter,« sagte Gregor leise und sah zu ihr hinauf. Der Prokurist war ihm für einen Augenblick ganz aus dem Sinn gekommen; dagegen konnte er sich nicht versagen, im Anblick des fließenden Kaffees mehrmals mit den Kiefern ins Leere zu schnappen. Darüber schrie die Mutter neuerdings auf, flüchtete vom Tisch und fiel dem ihr entgegeneilenden Vater in die Arme. Aber Gregor hatte jetzt keine Zeit für seine Eltern; der Prokurist war schon auf der Treppe; das Kinn auf dem Geländer, sah er noch zum letzten Male zurück. Gregor nahm einen Anlauf, um ihn möglichst sicher einzuholen; der Prokurist mußte etwas ahnen, denn er machte einen Sprung über mehrere Stufen und verschwand; »Huh!« aber schrie er noch, es klang durchs ganze Treppenhaus. Leider schien nun auch diese Flucht des Prokuristen den Vater, der bisher verhältnismäßig gefaßt gewesen war, völlig zu verwirren, denn statt selbst dem Prokuristen nachzulaufen oder wenigstens Gregor in der Verfolgung nicht zu hindern, packte er mit der Rechten den Stock des Prokuristen, den dieser mit Hut und Überzieher auf einem Sessel zurückgelassen hatte, holte mit der Linken eine große Zeitung vom Tisch und machte sich unter Füßestampfen daran, Gregor durch Schwenken des Stockes und der Zeitung in sein Zimmer zurückzutreiben. Kein Bitten Gregors half, kein Bitten wurde auch verstanden, er mochte den Kopf noch so demütig drehen, der Vater stampfte nur stärker mit den Füßen. Drüben hatte die Mutter trotz des kühlen Wetters ein Fenster aufgerissen, und hinausgelehnt drückte sie ihr Gesicht weit außerhalb des Fensters in ihre Hände. Zwischen Gasse und Treppenhaus entstand eine starke Zugluft, die Fenstervorhänge flogen auf, die Zeitungen auf dem Tische rauschten, einzelne Blätter wehten über den Boden hin. Unerbittlich drängte der Vater und stieß Zischlaute aus, wie ein Wilder. Nun hatte aber Gregor noch gar keine Übung im Rückwärtsgehen, es ging wirklich sehr langsam. Wenn sich Gregor nur hätte umdrehen dürfen, er wäre gleich in seinem Zimmer gewesen, aber er fürchtete sich, den Vater durch die zeitraubende Umdrehung ungeduldig zu machen, und jeden Augenblick drohte ihm doch von dem Stock in des Vaters Hand der tödliche Schlag auf den Rücken oder auf den Kopf. Endlich aber blieb Gregor doch nichts anderes übrig, denn er merkte mit Entsetzen, daß er im Rückwärtsgehen nicht einmal die Richtung einzuhalten verstand; und so begann er, unter unaufhörlichen ängstlichen Seitenblicken nach dem Vater, sich nach Möglichkeit rasch, in Wirklichkeit aber doch nur sehr langsam umzudrehen. Vielleicht merkte der Vater seinen guten Willen, denn er störte ihn hierbei nicht, sondern dirigierte sogar hie und da die Drehbewegung von der Ferne mit der Spitze seines Stockes. Wenn nur nicht dieses unerträgliche Zischen des Vaters gewesen wäre! Gregor verlor darüber ganz den Kopf. Er war schon fast ganz umgedreht, als er sich, immer auf dieses Zischen horchend, sogar irrte und sich wieder ein Stück zurückdrehte. Als er aber endlich glücklich mit dem Kopf vor der Türöffnung war, zeigte es sich, daß sein Körper zu breit war, um ohne weiteres durchzukommen. Dem Vater fiel es natürlich in seiner gegenwärtigen Verfassung auch nicht entfernt ein, etwa den anderen Türflügel zu öffnen, um für Gregor einen genügenden Durchgang zu schaffen. Seine fixe Idee war bloß, daß Gregor so rasch als möglich in sein Zimmer müsse. Niemals hätte er auch die umständlichen Vorbereitungen gestattet, die Gregor brauchte, um sich aufzurichten und vielleicht auf diese Weise durch die Tür zu kommen. Vielleicht trieb er, als gäbe es kein Hindernis, Gregor jetzt unter besonderem Lärm vorwärts; es klang schon hinter Gregor gar nicht mehr wie die Stimme bloß eines einzigen Vaters; nun gab es wirklich keinen Spaß mehr, und Gregor drängte sich – geschehe was wolle – in die Tür. Die eine Seite seines Körpers hob sich, er lag schief in der Türöffnung, seine eine Flanke war ganz wundgerieben, an der weißen Tür blieben häßliche Flecke, bald steckte er fest und hätte sich allein nicht mehr rühren können, die Beinchen auf der einen Seite hingen zitternd oben in der Luft, die auf der anderen waren schmerzhaft zu Boden gedrückt – da gab ihm der Vater von hinten einen jetzt wahrhaftig erlösenden starken Stoß, und er flog, heftig blutend, weit in sein Zimmer hinein. Die Tür wurde noch mit dem Stock zugeschlagen, dann war es endlich still.","""Mother, mother,"" said Gregor softly and looked up at her. For a moment he had completely forgotten about the general manager; on the other hand, he couldn't help but snap his jaws several times at the sight of the flowing coffee. The mother cried out again at this, fled from the table and fell into the arms of her father, who was hurrying towards her. But Gregor had no time for his parents now; the manager was already on the stairs; his chin on the railing, he looked back for the last time. Gregor took a running start to catch up with him as safely as possible; the manager must have suspected something, because he jumped over several steps and disappeared; ""Huh!"" but he still shouted, it echoed through the whole stairwell. Unfortunately, this flight of the general manager seemed to completely confuse the father, who had been relatively composed up to now, because instead of running after the general manager himself or at least not preventing Gregor from pursuing him, he grabbed the general manager's cane with his right hand, which the latter in a chair with hat and overcoat, took a large newspaper from the table with his left hand and stamped his feet and set about driving Gregor back to his room by waving the stick and the newspaper. No plea from Gregory helped, no plea was understood, no matter how humbly he turned his head, Father just stamped his feet harder. On the other side, despite the cool weather, the mother had thrown open a window and was leaning out, cradling her face in her hands far outside the window. There was a strong draft between the alley and the stairwell, the window curtains flew open, the newspapers rustled on the table, single sheets blew across the floor. The father pushed relentlessly and made hissing noises like a savage. But Gregor hadn't had any practice walking backwards, it was really very slow. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn around, he would have been in his room right away, but he was afraid of making his father impatient with the time-consuming turn, and at any moment he was threatened with a fatal blow on the back from the stick in his father's hand or upside down. In the end, however, Gregor had no other choice, for he realized with horror that he couldn't even keep his direction while walking backwards; and so he began, with incessant anxious glances at his father, to turn around as quickly as possible, but in reality only very slowly. Perhaps the father noticed his good intentions, because he didn't bother him, but even directed the turning movement from afar here and there with the tip of his stick. If only it hadn't been for his father's unbearable hissing! Gregor completely lost his head over this. He was almost completely turned around when, always listening to this hissing, he even made a mistake and turned back a bit. But when at last he was happy with his head in front of the doorway, it turned out that his body was too broad to easily get through. Of course, in his current state, Father didn't remotely think of opening the other door leaf to create a sufficient passage for Gregor. The only thing he was obsessed with was that Gregor had to go to his room as quickly as possible. He would never have permitted the cumbersome preparations that Gregor needed to get up and perhaps get through the door like this. Perhaps now, as if there were no obstacle, he was driving Gregor forward with particular noise; Behind Gregor it no longer sounded like the voice of just one father; now there was really no more fun, and Gregor – come what may – pushed his way through the door. One side of his body rose, he lay crooked in the doorway, one side was rubbed sore, ugly stains remained on the white door, soon he got stuck and couldn't have moved on his own, his little legs were hanging on one side trembling in the air above, those on the other side were painfully pressed to the ground - then his father gave him a strong push from behind, which was now truly redeeming, and he flew away, bleeding profusely, far into his room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then it was finally quiet.","“Mother, Mother,” Gregor said softly, and looked up at her. The head clerk had momentarily slipped his mind and he could not help snapping his jaws in the air at the sight of the flowing coffee. This caused the mother to scream again; she fled from the table and fell into the father’s arms as he rushed to her. But Gregor now had no time to waste on his parents; the head clerk was already on the stairs, with his chin on the banister he was looking back one last time. Gregor broke into a run to be sure to catch him; the head clerk must have suspected this because he leaped down several steps and disappeared; he was still yelling, “Aaahh!” which rang throughout the whole staircase. Unfortunately the head clerk’s flight seemed to totally confuse the father, who until now had remained relatively calm, for instead of going after the head clerk or at least not hindering Gregor’s pursuit, he seized in his right hand the head clerk’s walking stick (which along with his hat and overcoat had been left behind on a chair) and with his left hand grabbed a large newspaper from the table and, stamping his feet, proceeded to brandish the walking stick and newspaper in order to drive Gregor back into his room. No plea of Gregor’s helped, nor indeed was any plea understood; however humbly he turned his head, the father merely stamped his feet all the more forcefully. Across the room the mother, despite the cool weather, had thrown open a window and was leaning far out of it with her face buried in her hands. A strong draft swept in from the street to the staircase, the window curtains swelled, the newspapers on the table rustled, stray pages fluttered over the floor. The father drove Gregor back relentlessly, hissing like a savage.5 As Gregor was as yet unpracticed in moving backward, it was very slow going. If only Gregor had been permitted to turn around, he would have been in his room at once, but he was afraid to make the father impatient by this time-consuming rotation, and at any moment the stick in the father’s hand threatened to deal a fatal blow to the back or the head. In the end, however, there remained no other choice, for Gregor observed to his horror that he could not control his direction when moving backward, and so he began as quickly as possible, which was actually very slowly, to turn himself around. Perhaps the father recognized his good intentions because he did not interfere; instead he occasionally even directed the movement from a distance with the tip of his stick. If only the father would quit that infernal hissing! It made Gregor completely lose his head. He was almost turned all the way around when, distracted by the hissing, he made a mistake and turned back the other way for a stretch. When he successfully ended up headfirst in front of the doorway, it was obvious that his body was too wide to get through as it was. Naturally it did not occur to the father in his present mood to open the other wing of the door to give Gregor a wide enough passage. He was fixed on the idea of getting Gregor back in his room as quickly as possible. And he would never have allowed the elaborate preparations that Gregor needed to pull himself upright and perhaps attempt to go through the door that way. Rather, he drove Gregor forward, as if there were no obstacle, with a considerable amount of noise; it no longer sounded like just one father behind him and now it was really no longer a joke, and Gregor—come what may—thrust himself into the doorway. One side of his body rose up and he lay at an angle in the doorway, one of his flanks was scraped raw and the white door was stained with ugly blotches, he was soon stuck fast and could not move on his own, the little legs on one side hung trembling in midair and on the other side they were pinned painfully to the floor—when his father gave him a terrific shove from behind and he flew, bleeding profusely, far into the room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then all was still.","‘Mother, mother,’ said Gregor quietly, and looked over towards her. The manager momentarily had disappeared completely from his mind; by contrast, at the sight of the flowing coffee he couldn’t stop himself snapping his jaws in the air a few times . At that his mother screamed all over again, hurried from the table, and collapsed into the arms of his father, who was rushing towards her. But Gregor had no time right now for his parents: the manager was already on the staircase. His chin level with the banister, the manager looked back for the last time. Gregor took an initial movement to catch up to him if possible. But the manager must have suspected something, because he made a leap down over a few stairs and disappeared, still shouting ‘Huh!’ The sound echoed throughout the entire stairwell. Now, unfortunately this flight of the manager also seemed completely to bewilder his father, who earlier had been relatively calm, for instead of running after the manager himself or at least not hindering Gregor from his pursuit, with his right hand he grabbed hold of the manager’s cane, which he had left behind with his hat and overcoat on a chair. With his left hand, his father picked up a large newspaper from the table and, stamping his feet on the floor, he set out to drive Gregor back into his room by waving the cane and the newspaper. No request of Gregor’s was of any use; no request would even be understood. No matter how willing he was to turn his head respectfully, his father just stomped all the harder with his feet. Across the room from him his mother had pulled open a window, in spite of the cool weather, and leaning out with her hands on her cheeks, she pushed her face far outside the window. Between the alley and the stair well a strong draught came up, the curtains on the window flew around, the newspapers on the table swished, and individual sheets fluttered down over the floor. The father relentlessly pressed forward pushing out sibilants, like a wild man. Now, Gregor had no practice at all in going backwards; it was really going very slowly. If Gregor only had been allowed to turn himself around, he would have been in his room right away, but he was afraid to make his father impatient by the time-consum-ing process of turning around, and each moment he faced the threat of a mortal blow on his back or his head from the cane in his father’s hand. Finally Gregor had no other op-tion, for he noticed with horror that he did not understand yet how to maintain his direction going backwards. And so he began, amid constantly anxious sideways glances in his father’s direction, to turn himself around as quickly as possible (although in truth this was only very slowly). Perhaps his father noticed his good intentions, for he did not disrupt Gregor in this motion, but with the tip of the cane from a distance he even directed here and there Gregor’s rotating movement. If only there hadn’t been his father’s unbearable hissing! Because of that Gregor totally lost his head. He was already almost totally turned around, when, always with this hissing in his ear, he just made a mistake and turned himself back a little. But when he finally was successful in getting his head in front of the door opening, it became clear that his body was too wide to go through any further. Naturally his father, in his present mental state, had no idea of opening the other wing of the door a bit to create a suitable passage for Gregor to get through. His single fixed thought was that Gregor must get into his room as quickly as possible. He would never have allowed the elaborate preparations that Gregor required to orient himself and thus perhaps get through the door. On the contrary, as if there were no obstacle and with a peculiar noise, he now drove Gregor forwards. Behind Gregor the sound was at this point no longer like the voice of only a single father. Now it was really no longer a joke, and Gregor forced himself, come what might, into the door. One side of his body was lifted up. He lay at an angle in the door opening. His one flank was sore with the scraping. On the white door ugly blotches were left. Soon he was stuck fast and would have not been able to move any more on his own. The tiny legs on one side hung twitching in the air above, the ones on the other side were pushed painfully into the floor. Then his father gave him one really strong liberating push from behind, and he scurried, bleed-ing severely, far into the interior of his room. The door was slammed shut with the cane, and finally it was quiet.","“Mother, Mother,” Gregor said softly, gazing up at her. For a moment he had forgotten all about the general manager; on the other hand, he could not restrain himself, when he beheld this flowing coffee, from snapping his jaws several times. At this, the mother gave another shriek and fled from the table into the arms of Gregor’s father as he rushed to her aid. But Gregor had no time for his parents now; the general manager was already on the stairs; his chin propped on the banister, he looked back on the scene one last time. Gregor was just preparing to dash after him to be sure of catching up with him; but the manager must have sensed something, for he leapt down several steps at once and vanished; and the cry of horror he gave as he fled resounded through the stairwell. Unfortunately the manager’s flight now appeared to utterly discombobulate Gregor’s father, who up till then had been relatively composed, for instead of running after the manager himself or at least not hindering Gregor in his own pursuit, he seized the manager’s walking stick in one hand—it had been left lying on an armchair along with his overcoat and hat—with the other took up a large newspaper from the table, and set about driving Gregor back into his room with a great stamping of feet, brandishing both newspaper and stick. All Gregor’s entreaties were in vain, nor were they even understood, for as submissively as he might swivel his head, his father only stamped his feet all the more ferociously. Across the room, his mother had flung open a window despite the chilly weather, and, leaning out, she pressed her face into her hands far outside the window frame. Between street and stairwell, a powerful draft arose, the window curtains flew into the air, the newspapers on the table rustled, and a few pages scudded across the floor. Inexorably Gregor’s father drove him backward, uttering hissing sounds like a wild man. But Gregor had no practice at all in reverse locomotion, and his progress was very slow. If only he’d been permitted to turn around, he’d have been back in his room at once, but he was afraid of provoking his father’s fury with this time-consuming maneuver, and at any moment a fatal blow from the stick in his father’s hand might come crashing down on his back or head. In the end, though, he had no alternative: horrified, he realized he was incapable of controlling his direction; and so he began, with constant anxious glances back at his father, to turn around as quickly as he could, which in fact was rather slowly. Perhaps his father discerned his good intentions, for he did not hinder him in this operation but instead even guided his rotation here and there from a distance, using the tip of his stick. If only his father were not making that unbearable hissing noise! It made Gregor lose his head completely. He had already turned almost all the way around when—still with this hissing in his ear—he became confused and started turning back in the wrong direction. But when finally he succeeded in positioning his head in front of the doorway, it turned out that his body was too wide to fit through the opening. And of course in his father’s current state it could not possibly have occurred to him to open the door’s other wing to create an adequate passage. He was fixated on the notion that Gregor must disappear into his room as quickly as possible. Never would he have tolerated the complicated preparations necessary for Gregor to prop himself up so as possibly to pass through the door in an upright position. Instead, as though there were no obstacle at all, he now drove Gregor before him, raising a great din: what Gregor heard at his back no longer resembled the voice of merely a single father; it was do or die, and Gregor thrust himself—come what would—into the doorway. One side of his body tilted up, rising at an angle as he pressed forward, scraping his one flank raw and leaving ugly stains behind on the white door, and soon he was wedged tight, unable to move on his own; on one side, his little legs dangled trembling in midair, while on the other they were crushed painfully beneath him—then his father administered a powerful shove from behind, a genuinely liberating thrust that sent him flying, bleeding profusely, into the far reaches of his room. The door was banged shut with the stick, and then at last all was still."
"»Was ist mit mir geschehen?« dachte er. Es war kein Traum. Sein Zimmer, ein richtiges, nur etwas zu kleines Menschenzimmer, lag ruhig zwischen den vier wohlbekannten Wänden. Über dem Tisch, auf dem eine auseinandergepackte Musterkollektion von Tuchwaren ausgebreitet war – Samsa war Reisender –, hing das Bild, das er vor kurzem aus einer illustrierten Zeitschrift ausgeschnitten und in einem hübschen, vergoldeten Rahmen untergebracht hatte. Es stellte eine Dame dar, die, mit einem Pelzhut und einer Pelzboa versehen, aufrecht dasaß und einen schweren Pelzmuff, in dem ihr ganzer Unterarm verschwunden war, dem Beschauer entgegenhob.","""What happened to me?"" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a real human room, just a little too small, lay quietly between the four well-known walls.

It represented a lady wearing a fur hat and boa, sitting erect, raising to the viewer a heavy fur muff in which her entire forearm had disappeared.","“What has happened to me?” he thought.

"Einmal, es war wohl schon ein Monat seit Gregors Verwandlung vergangen, und es war doch schon für die Schwester kein besonderer Grund mehr, über Gregors Aussehen in Erstaunen zu geraten, kam sie ein wenig früher als sonst und traf Gregor noch an, wie er, unbeweglich und so recht zum Erschrecken aufgestellt, aus dem Fenster schaute. Es wäre für Gregor nicht unerwartet gewesen, wenn sie nicht eingetreten wäre, da er sie durch seine Stellung verhinderte, sofort das Fenster zu öffnen, aber sie trat nicht nur nicht ein, sie fuhr sogar zurück und schloß die Tür; ein Fremder hätte geradezu denken können, Gregor habe ihr aufgelauert und habe sie beißen wollen. Gregor versteckte sich natürlich sofort unter dem Kanapee, aber er mußte bis zum Mittag warten, ehe die Schwester wiederkam, und sie schien viel unruhiger als sonst. Er erkannte daraus, daß ihr sein Anblick noch immer unerträglich war und ihr auch weiterhin unerträglich bleiben müsse, und daß sie sich wohl sehr überwinden mußte, vor dem Anblick auch nur der kleinen Partie seines Körpers nicht davonzulaufen, mit der er unter dem Kanapee hervorragte. Um ihr auch diesen Anblick zu ersparen, trug er eines Tages auf seinem Rücken – er brauchte zu dieser Arbeit vier Stunden – das Leintuch auf das Kanapee und ordnete es in einer solchen Weise an, daß er nun gänzlich verdeckt war, und daß die Schwester, selbst wenn sie sich bückte, ihn nicht sehen konnte. Wäre dieses Leintuch ihrer Meinung nach nicht nötig gewesen, dann hätte sie es ja entfernen können, denn daß es nicht zum Vergnügen Gregors gehören konnte, sich so ganz und gar abzusperren, war doch klar genug, aber sie ließ das Leintuch, so wie es war, und Gregor glaubte sogar einen dankbaren Blick erhascht zu haben, als er einmal mit dem Kopf vorsichtig das Leintuch ein wenig lüftete, um nachzusehen, wie die Schwester die neue Einrichtung aufnahm.","Once, it had probably been a month since Gregor's transformation, and there was no longer any particular reason for my sister to be astonished at Gregor's appearance, she came a little earlier than usual and found Gregor, like him, immobile and set up so frighteningly, looking out of the window. It would not have been unexpected for Gregor if she had not come in, since his position prevented her from opening the window immediately, but not only did she not go in, she even drew back and closed the door; a stranger might have thought that Gregor had ambushed her and wanted to bite her. Of course Gregor immediately hid under the sofa, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back, and she seemed much more restless than usual. and that she had to force herself not to run away from the sight of even that small part of his body that was sticking out from under the sofa. In order to spare her this sight too, one day he carried the sheet on his back - it took him four hours for this work - and arranged it in such a way that it was now completely hidden, and that the sister, even if she bent down, couldn't see him. If the sheet hadn't been necessary in her opinion, then she could have removed it, for it was clear enough that it couldn't be Gregor's pleasure to shut himself off so completely, but she left the sheet as it was , and Gregor even thought he had caught a grateful look when he carefully lifted the sheet a little with his head to see how the sister was taking in the new arrangement.","Once, approximately a month after Gregor’s transformation, when there was no reason for the sister to be especially alarmed at his appearance, she came a little earlier than usual and caught Gregor perfectly still, gazing out the window, thus giving him a particularly frightful aspect. It would not have surprised Gregor if she had not come in, as his position prevented her from immediately opening the window, but not only did she not enter, she actually jumped back and shut the door; a stranger could easily have thought Gregor had been lying in wait for her and meant to bite her. Gregor naturally hid himself at once under the sofa but had to wait until noon for the sister’s return, and then she seemed much more uneasy than usual. He concluded that the sight of him was still repulsive to her and was bound to remain repulsive, and that she must have exercised great self-control not to take flight at the sight of even the smallest portion of his body protruding from under the couch. To spare her from even these glimpses, he dragged the sheet to the sofa on his back one day—this required four hours’ work—and laid it in such a way as to conceal himself entirely, so the sister could not see him even if she stooped down. If she did not find the sheet necessary, she certainly could have removed it, because it was clear enough that Gregor could not possibly be pleased by his total confinement, but she left the sheet as it was, and Gregor imagined he caught a grateful look once when he cautiously raised the sheet a little with his head to see how the sister was taking the new arrangement.","On one occasion (about one month had already gone by since Gregor’s transformation, and there was now no particular reason any more for his sister to be startled at Gregor’s appearance) she came a little earlier than usual and came upon Gregor as he was still looking out the window, immobile and well positioned to frighten someone. It would not have come as a surprise to Gregor if she had not come in, since his position was preventing her from opening the window immediately. But she not only did not step inside; she even retreated and shut the door. A stranger really could have concluded from this that Gregor had been lying in wait for her and wanted to bite her. Of course, Gregor immediately concealed himself under the couch, but he had to wait until the noon meal before his sister returned, and she seemed much less calm than usual. From this he realized that his appearance was still constantly intolerable to her and must remain intolerable in future, and that she really had to exert a lot of self-control not to run away from a glimpse of only the small part of his body which stuck out from under the couch. In order to spare her even this sight, one day he dragged the sheet on his back onto the couch (this task took him four hours) and arranged it in such a way that he was now completely concealed and his sister, even if she bent down, could not see him. If this sheet was not necessary as far as she was concerned, then she could remove it, for it was clear enough that Gregor could not derive any pleasure from isolating himself away so completely. But she left the sheet just as it was, and Gregor believed he even caught a look of gratitude when on one occasion he carefully lifted up the sheet a little with his head to check as his sister took stock of the new arrangement.","Once—it must have been a month since Gregor’s metamorphosis, so there was no particular call for his sister to be startled by his appearance—she came into his room a little earlier than usual and discovered him, motionless and propped upright as if for horrific effect, gazing out the window. Gregor would not have found it surprising if she had chosen not to enter, since his position prevented her from opening the window right away, but she didn’t just not enter: she started in alarm and shut the door; a stranger might have thought Gregor had been lying in wait, meaning to bite her. Gregor naturally went and hid himself away beneath the settee, but he had to wait there until noon before his sister returned, and she seemed far more agitated than usual. From this he understood that his appearance was still unbearable to her and would remain so, and that she no doubt had to struggle to force herself not to run away at the sight of even the small part of his body that protruded from beneath the settee. In order to spare her even this sight, one day he carried the bedsheet over to the settee on his back—this labor cost him four hours—and arranged it in such a way that he was now completely covered, so that his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down. If she considered the sheet unnecessary, she could have removed it, since it was clear enough that it could not possibly be considered a pleasure for Gregor to shut himself off so completely, but she left the sheet where it was, and Gregor even thought he glimpsed a grateful look when at one point he carefully lifted the sheet just a little with his head to see how his sister liked the new arrangement."
"Im Wohnzimmer war, wie Gregor durch die Türspalte sah, das Gas angezündet, aber während sonst zu dieser Tageszeit der Vater seine nachmittags erscheinende Zeitung der Mutter und manchmal auch der Schwester mit erhobener Stimme vorzulesen pflegte, hörte man jetzt keinen Laut. Nun vielleicht war dieses Vorlesen, von dem ihm die Schwester immer erzählte und schrieb, in der letzten Zeit überhaupt aus der Übung gekommen. Aber auch ringsherum war es so still, trotzdem doch gewiß die Wohnung nicht leer war. »Was für ein stilles Leben die Familie doch führte,« sagte sich Gregor und fühlte, während er starr vor sich ins Dunkle sah, einen großen Stolz darüber, daß er seinen Eltern und seiner Schwester ein solches Leben in einer so schönen Wohnung hatte verschaffen können. Wie aber, wenn jetzt alle Ruhe, aller Wohlstand, alle Zufriedenheit ein Ende mit Schrecken nehmen sollte? Um sich nicht in solche Gedanken zu verlieren, setzte sich Gregor lieber in Bewegung und kroch im Zimmer auf und ab.","In the living room, as Gregor saw through the crack in the door, the gas was on, but while at other times of the day my father used to read his afternoon newspaper to his mother and sometimes his sister with a raised voice, no sound was heard now. Well, perhaps this reading aloud, which his sister was always telling and writing to him about, had just gotten out of practice lately. But it was also so quiet all around, although the apartment was certainly not empty. ""What a quiet life the family led,"" Gregor said to himself and, staring straight ahead into the darkness, felt great pride that he had been able to give his parents and sister such a life in such a beautiful apartment . But what if now all peace, all prosperity, all contentment should come to an end with terror? In order not to lose himself in such thoughts, Gregor preferred to move and crawl up and down the room.","In the living room, as Gregor could see through the crack in the door, the gas was lit; although the father usually liked to read the afternoon paper at this hour in a loud voice to the mother and sometimes to the sister as well, not a sound was heard. Well, perhaps this custom of reading that the sister had told him about and wrote of in her letters had been recently discontinued. But it was so silent everywhere, even though the apartment was certainly not empty. “What a quiet life the family has led,” Gregor said to himself, and felt, as he stared pointedly into the darkness, a great surge of pride that he had been able to provide his parents and his sister such a life and in such a beautiful apartment. But what if all the tranquillity, all the comfort, all the contentment were now to come to a horrifying end? So as not to dwell on such thoughts, Gregor started to move and began crawling up and down the room.","In the living room, as Gregor saw through the crack in the door, the gas was lit, but where on other occasions at this time of day the father was accustomed to read the afternoon newspaper in a loud voice to his mother and sometimes also to his sister, at the moment not a sound was audible. Now, perhaps this reading aloud, about which his sister always spoken and written to him, had recently fallen out of their general routine. But it was so still all around, in spite of the fact that the apartment was certainly not empty. ‘What a quiet life the family leads’, said Gregor to himself and, as he stared fixedly out in front of him into the darkness, he felt a great pride that he had been able to provide such a life in a beautiful apartment like this for his parents and his sister. But how would things go if now all tranquillity, all prosper-ity, all contentment should come to a horrible end? In order not to lose himself in such thoughts, Gregor preferred to set himself moving and crawled up and down in his room.","In the living room, as Gregor saw through the crack, the gas had been lit, but while usually at this hour his father liked to read aloud from the afternoon paper to Gregor’s mother and sometimes his sister as well in a dramatic voice, now there was not a sound to be heard. Well, perhaps this customary reading aloud that his sister had often told and written him about had recently fallen out of practice. But even in the other rooms everything was so still, even though the apartment was surely not empty. “What a quiet life my family has been leading,” Gregor said to himself, and as he gazed fixedly into the darkness before him, he felt great pride at having been able to give his parents and sister a life like this in such a beautiful apartment. But what if all this tranquility, all this prosperity and contentment were now coming to a horrific end? So as not to get lost in such contemplations, Gregor set himself in motion, crawling back and forth across the room."
"Gerade an diesem Abend – Gregor erinnerte sich nicht, während der ganzen Zeit die Violine gehört zu haben – ertönte sie von der Küche her. Die Zimmerherren hatten schon ihr Nachtmahl beendet, der mittlere hatte eine Zeitung hervorgezogen, den zwei anderen je ein Blatt gegeben, und nun lasen sie zurückgelehnt und rauchten. Als die Violine zu spielen begann, wurden sie aufmerksam, erhoben sich und gingen auf den Fußspitzen zur Vorzimmertür, in der sie aneinandergedrängt stehen blieben. Man mußte sie von der Küche aus gehört haben, denn der Vater rief: »Ist den Herren das Spiel vielleicht unangenehm? Es kann sofort eingestellt werden.« »Im Gegenteil,« sagte der mittlere der Herren, »möchte das Fräulein nicht zu uns hereinkommen und hier im Zimmer spielen, wo es doch viel bequemer und gemütlicher ist?« »O bitte,« rief der Vater, als sei er der Violinspieler. Die Herren traten ins Zimmer zurück und warteten. Bald kam der Vater mit dem Notenpult, die Mutter mit den Noten und die Schwester mit der Violine. Die Schwester bereitete alles ruhig zum Spiele vor; die Eltern, die niemals früher Zimmer vermietet hatten und deshalb die Höflichkeit gegen die Zimmerherren übertrieben, wagten gar nicht, sich auf ihre eigenen Sessel zu setzen; der Vater lehnte an der Tür, die rechte Hand zwischen zwei Knöpfe des geschlossenen Livreerockes gesteckt; die Mutter aber erhielt von einem Herrn einen Sessel angeboten und saß, da sie den Sessel dort ließ, wohin ihn der Herr zufällig gestellt hatte, abseits in einem Winkel.","That very evening - Gregor didn't remember hearing the violin the whole time - it came from the kitchen. The lodgers had already finished their supper, the man in the middle had pulled out a newspaper and given the other two a sheet each, and now they leaned back and read and smoked. When the violin began to play, they became attentive, got up and tiptoed to the hall door, where they stood huddled together. You must have heard her from the kitchen, because her father called out: ""Are the gentlemen perhaps uncomfortable with the game? ""On the contrary,"" said the man in the middle, ""wouldn't the young lady like to come in and play here in the room, where it's much more comfortable and cosy?"" ""Oh, please,"" cried the father , as if he were the violin player. The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Soon the father came with the music stand, the mother with the music and the sister with the violin. The sister quietly prepared everything for the game; the parents, who had never rented rooms before and therefore exaggerated their courtesy to the landlords, did not dare sit down in their own armchairs; the father was leaning against the door, his right hand stuck between two buttons of his closed livery coat; but the mother was offered a chair by a gentleman and, since she left the chair where the gentleman had accidentally put it, sat away in a corner.","On this very evening—Gregor could not remember having heard the violin all this time—the sound of the violin came from the kitchen. The boarders had already finished their supper, the middle one had taken out a newspaper and distributed a sheet each to the two others, and they were now leaning back, reading and smoking. When the violin began playing they all looked up, got to their feet, and tiptoed to the foyer door, where they huddled together. They must have been heard from the kitchen because the father called out: “Are the gentlemen disturbed by the violin playing? It can be stopped at once.” “On the contrary,” said the middle gentleman, “wouldn’t the young lady care to come in here with us and play where it is more spacious and comfortable?” “Oh, certainly,” cried the father, as though he were the violinist. The boarders retreated to the room and waited. Soon the father entered with the music stand, the mother with the music, and the sister with the violin. The sister calmly prepared everything to start playing; the parents, who had never before let a room and were consequently excessively polite to the boarders, did not dare to sit in their own chairs; the father leaned against the door with his right hand tucked between two buttons of his fastened uniform jacket; the mother, however, was offered a chair by one of the gentlemen and sat down where he had chanced to put it, off in a corner.","On this very evening (Gregor didn’t remember hearing the violin all through this period) it sounded from the kitchen. The lodgers had already ended their night meal, the middle one had pulled out a newspaper and had given each of the other two a page, and they were now leaning back, reading and smoking. When the violin started playing, they became attentive, got up, and went on tiptoe to the hall door, at which they remained standing pressed up against one another. They must have been audible from the kitchen, because the father called out ‘Perhaps the gentlemen don’t like the playing? It can be stopped at once.’ ‘On the contrary,’ stated the lodger in the middle, ‘might the young woman not come into us and play in the room here where it is really much more comfortable and cheerful?’ ‘Oh, thank you,’ cried out the father, as if he were the one playing the violin. The men stepped back into the room and waited. Soon the father came with the music stand, the mother with the sheet music, and the sister with the violin. The sister calmly prepared everything for the recital. The parents, who had never previously rented a room and therefore exaggerated their politeness to the lodgers, dared not sit on their own chairs. The father leaned against the door, his right hand stuck between two buttons of his buttoned up uniform. The mother, however, accepted a chair offered by one lodger. Since she left the chair sit where the gentleman had chanced to put it, she sat to one side in a corner.","On this very evening—Gregor couldn’t remember having heard the violin once in all this time—the sound of it was heard coming from the kitchen. The lodgers had already finished their evening meal, the one in the middle had pulled out a newspaper, giving each of the others a page, and now the three of them were reading, leaning back in their chairs and smoking. When the violin began to play, their interest was piqued, they got up from their chairs and tiptoed over to the doorway leading to the vestibule, where they stood in a tight cluster. The sounds of this activity must have traveled to the kitchen, for Gregor’s father now called out: “Are the gentlemen disturbed by this playing? It can be silenced at once.” “On the contrary,” said the one in the middle, “would the young lady care to join us and play here in the living room, where it is much more comfortable and pleasant?” “Why, of course,” Gregor’s father exclaimed, as though he were the violinist. The gentlemen went back into the room and waited. Soon Gregor’s father arrived with the music stand, his mother with the sheet music and his sister with the violin. His sister calmly prepared to play; his parents, who never rented out rooms in earlier days and therefore were treating these lodgers with exaggerated deference, did not even dare to sit in their own armchairs; his father leaned against the door, his right hand tucked between two buttons of his closed livery jacket; his mother, meanwhile, was offered an armchair by one of the lodgers, and since she left the chair where he had happened to place it, she sat off to one side in a corner."
"Einmal während des langen Abends wurde die eine Seitentüre und einmal die andere bis zu einer kleinen Spalte geöffnet und rasch wieder geschlossen; jemand hatte wohl das Bedürfnis hereinzukommen, aber auch wieder zu viele Bedenken. Gregor machte nun unmittelbar bei der Wohnzimmertür Halt, entschlossen, den zögernden Besucher doch irgendwie hereinzubringen oder doch wenigstens zu erfahren, wer es sei; aber nun wurde die Tür nicht mehr geöffnet und Gregor wartete vergebens. Früh, als die Türen versperrt waren, hatten alle zu ihm hereinkommen wollen, jetzt, da er die eine Tür geöffnet hatte und die anderen offenbar während des Tages geöffnet worden waren, kam keiner mehr, und die Schlüssel steckten nun auch von außen.","Once during the long evening one side door, and once the other, was opened up to a small crack and quickly closed again; someone felt the need to come in, but again had too many concerns. Gregor now stopped directly at the living-room door, determined somehow to bring the hesitant visitor in, or at least to find out who it was; but now the door was no longer opened and Gregor waited in vain. In the morning, when the doors were locked, everyone had wanted to come in to him, now that he had opened one door and the others had obviously been opened during the day, no one came any more, and the keys were now also in the outside.","Once during the long evening, one of the side doors and then the other was opened a small crack and quickly shut again; someone had apparently had the urge to come in but had then thought better of it. Gregor now stationed himself directly before the living room door, determined to persuade the hesitant visitor to come in or at least discover who it might be, but the door was not opened again and Gregor waited in vain. That morning, when the doors had been locked, they all wanted to come in; now after he had opened the one door and the others had been opened during the day, no one came and the keys were now on the other side.","Once during the long evening one side door and then the other door was opened just a tiny crack and quickly closed again. Someone presumably needed to come in but had then thought better of it. Gregor immediately took up a position by the living room door, determined to bring in the hesitant visitor somehow or other or at least to find out who it might be. But now the door was not opened any more, and Gregor waited in vain. Earlier, when the door had been barred, they had all wanted to come in to him; now, when he had opened one door and when the others had obviously been opened during the day, no one came any more, and the keys were stuck in the locks on the outside.","Once in the course of this long evening one of the side doors was opened a tiny crack and then quickly shut again, and once the other one; someone must have felt an urge to enter and then been overcome by misgivings. Gregor now stationed himself just in front of the living room door, determined to somehow coax the hesitant visitor inside or at least find out who it was; but the door did not open again, and Gregor waited in vain. Before, when all the doors were locked, everyone kept trying to come in, and now that he had opened the one door and the others had apparently been opened during the day, no one came, and the keys were sticking in their locks from the outside."
"Als er dies alles in größter Eile überlegte, ohne sich entschließen zu können, das Bett zu verlassen – gerade schlug der Wecker dreiviertel sieben – klopfte es vorsichtig an die Tür am Kopfende seines Bettes. »Gregor,« rief es – es war die Mutter –, »es ist dreiviertel sieben. Wolltest du nicht wegfahren?« Die sanfte Stimme! Gregor erschrak, als er seine antwortende Stimme hörte, die wohl unverkennbar seine frühere war, in die sich aber, wie von unten her, ein nicht zu unterdrückendes, schmerzliches Piepsen mischte, das die Worte förmlich nur im ersten Augenblick in ihrer Deutlichkeit beließ, um sie im Nachklang derart zu zerstören, daß man nicht wußte, ob man recht gehört hatte. Gregor hatte ausführlich antworten und alles erklären wollen, beschränkte sich aber bei diesen Umständen darauf, zu sagen: »Ja, ja, danke, Mutter, ich stehe schon auf.« Infolge der Holztür war die Veränderung in Gregors Stimme draußen wohl nicht zu merken, denn die Mutter beruhigte sich mit dieser Erklärung und schlürfte davon. Aber durch das kleine Gespräch waren die anderen Familienmitglieder darauf aufmerksam geworden, daß Gregor wider Erwarten noch zu Hause war, und schon klopfte an der einen Seitentür der Vater, schwach, aber mit der Faust. »Gregor, Gregor,« rief er, »was ist denn?« Und nach einer kleinen Weile mahnte er nochmals mit tieferer Stimme: »Gregor! Gregor!« An der anderen Seitentür aber klagte leise die Schwester: »Gregor? Ist dir nicht wohl? Brauchst du etwas?« Nach beiden Seiten hin antwortete Gregor: »Bin schon fertig,« und bemühte sich, durch die sorgfältigste Aussprache und durch Einschaltung von langen Pausen zwischen den einzelnen Worten seiner Stimme alles Auffallende zu nehmen. Der Vater kehrte auch zu seinem Frühstück zurück, die Schwester aber flüsterte: »Gregor, mach auf, ich beschwöre dich.« Gregor aber dachte gar nicht daran aufzumachen, sondern lobte die vom Reisen her übernommene Vorsicht, auch zu Hause alle Türen während der Nacht zu versperren.","As he thought about all this in a hurry, without being able to make up his mind to get out of bed – the alarm clock just struck a quarter to seven – there was a cautious knock on the door at the head of his bed. ""Gregor,"" she called - it was her mother - ""it's a quarter past six. Didn't you want to go away?' The soft voice! Gregor was startled when he heard his answering voice, which was unmistakably his earlier one, but which, as if from below, was mixed with a painful squeak that couldn't be suppressed, which literally only left the words in their clarity for the first moment to destroy them in the aftermath in such a way that one did not know whether one had heard correctly. Gregor wanted to answer in detail and explain everything, but under the circumstances limited himself to saying: ""Yes, yes, thank you, mother, I'll get up."" Because of the wooden door, the change in Gregor's voice was probably not noticeable outside, for the mother calmed down with this explanation and sipped away. But the little conversation had made the other family members aware that, contrary to expectations, Gregor was still at home, and Father was already knocking on the side door, weakly but with his fist. ""Gregor, Gregor,"" he cried, ""what's the matter?"" And after a little while he warned again in a deeper voice: ""Gregor! Gregor!"" At the other side door, however, the nurse moaned softly: ""Gregor? Are you not well? Do you need something?' Gregor answered to both sides: 'I'm already finished,' and tried to take away from his voice everything that stood out by the most careful pronunciation and by inserting long pauses between the individual words. The father also returned to his breakfast, but the sister whispered: ""Gregor, open the door, I beg you."" Gregor, however, did not even think of opening the door, instead he praised the precautions he had taken from travelling, even at home all the doors during the night to block.","As he urgently considered all this, without being able to decide to get out of bed—the alarm clock struck a quarter to seven—there was a timid knock at the door by his head. “Gregor,” a voice called—it was the mother—“it’s a quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to get going?” That sweet voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his voice answering, unmistakably his own, true, but a voice in which, as if from below, a persistent chirping intruded, so that the words remained clearly shaped only for a moment and then were destroyed to such an extent that one could not be sure one had heard them right. Gregor wanted to answer thoroughly and explain everything, but restricted himself, given the circumstances, to saying: “Yes, yes, thank you, Mother, I’m just getting up.” Due to the wooden door, the change in Gregor’s voice was probably not apparent on the other side, for the mother contented herself with this explanation and shuffled away. However, this short conversation brought to the attention of the other family members that Gregor, quite unexpectedly, was still at home, and the father was already knocking, gently, but with his fist, on one of the side doors. “Gregor, Gregor,” he called, “what is the matter?” And after a little while he called again, in a louder, warning voice: “Gregor, Gregor!” At the other side door the sister softly pleaded: “Gregor? Aren’t you feeling well? Do you need anything?” To both doors Gregor answered: “I’m all ready,” and strove, through enunciating most carefully and inserting long pauses between each word, to keep anything conspicuous out of his voice. The father went back to his breakfast, but the sister whispered: “Gregor, open up, I beg you.” Gregor, however, had no intention whatsoever of opening the door and instead congratulated himself on the precaution he picked up while traveling of locking the doors at night, even at home.","As he was thinking all this over in the greatest haste, without being able to make the decision to get out of bed (the alarm clock was indicating exactly quarter to seven) there was a cautious knock on the door by the head of the bed. ‘Gregor,’ a voice called (it was his mother!) ‘it’s quarter to seven. Don’t you want to be on your way?’ The soft voice! Gregor was startled when he heard his voice answer-ing. It was clearly and unmistakably his earlier voice, but in it was intermingled, as if from below, an irrepressibly painful squeaking which left the words positively distinct only in the first moment and distorted them in the reverberation, so that one didn’t know if one had heard correctly. Gregor wanted to answer in detail and explain everything, but in these circumstances he confined himself to saying, ‘Yes, yes, thank you mother. I’m getting up right away.’ Because of the wooden door the change in Gregor ’s voice was not really noticeable outside, so his mother calmed down with this explanation and shuffled off. However, as a result of the short conversation the other family members became aware of the fact that Gregor was unexpectedly still at home, and already his father was knocking on one side door, weakly but with his fist. ‘Gregor, Gregor,’ he called out, ‘what’s going on?’ And after a short while he urged him on again in a deeper voice. ‘Gregor!’ Gregor!’ At the other side door, however, his sister knocked lightly. ‘ Gregor? Are you all right? Do you need anything?’ Gregor directed answers in both directions, ‘I’ll be ready right away.’ He made an effort with the most careful articulation and by inserting long pauses between the individual words to remove everything remarkable from his voice. His father turned back to his breakfast. However, the sister whispered, ‘Gregor, open the door, I beg you.’ Gregor had no intention of opening the door, but congratulated himself on his precaution, acquired from traveling, of locking all doors during the night, even at home.","While he was considering these matters with the greatest possible speed, yet still without managing to make up his mind to leave the bed (the clock was just striking a quarter to seven), a timid knock came at the door at the head of his bed. “Gregor,” the voice called—it was his mother—“it’s a quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to catch your train?” That gentle voice! Gregor flinched when he heard his own in response: it was unmistakably his old voice, but now it had been infiltrated as if from below by a tortured peeping sound that was impossible to suppress—leaving each word intact, comprehensible, but only for an instant before so completely annihilating it as it continued to reverberate that a person could not tell for sure whether his ears were deceiving him. Gregor had meant to give a proper response explaining everything, but under the circumstances he limited himself to saying, “Yes, thank you, Mother, I’m just getting up.” Because of the wooden door, the change in Gregor’s voice appeared not to be noticeable from the other side, for his mother was reassured by his response and shuffled off. But their brief conversation had alerted the other family members that Gregor was unexpectedly still at home, and already his father was knocking at one of the room’s side doors, softly, but with his fist: “Gregor, Gregor,” he called. “What’s the problem?” And after a short while he repeated his question in a deeper register: “Gregor! Gregor!” Meanwhile, at the other side door came his sister’s faint lament: “Gregor? Are you unwell? Do you need anything?” “Just a second,” Gregor answered in both directions at once, making an effort, by enunciating as clearly as possible and inserting long pauses between the individual words, to remove anything conspicuous from his voice. And in fact his father returned to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open the door, I implore you.” But Gregor had no intention of opening the door; he praised the cautious habit he had acquired while traveling of locking all his doors at night, even at home."
"Als am frühen Morgen die Bedienerin kam – vor lauter Kraft und Eile schlug sie, wie oft man sie auch schon gebeten hatte, das zu vermeiden, alle Türen derartig zu, daß in der ganzen Wohnung von ihrem Kommen an kein ruhiger Schlaf mehr möglich war –, fand sie bei ihrem gewöhnlichen kurzen Besuch bei Gregor zuerst nichts Besonderes. Sie dachte, er liege absichtlich so unbeweglich da und spiele den Beleidigten; sie traute ihm allen möglichen Verstand zu. Weil sie zufällig den langen Besen in der Hand hielt, suchte sie mit ihm Gregor von der Tür aus zu kitzeln. Als sich auch da kein Erfolg zeigte, wurde sie ärgerlich und stieß ein wenig in Gregor hinein, und erst als sie ihn ohne jeden Widerstand von seinem Platze geschoben hatte, wurde sie aufmerksam. Als sie bald den wahren Sachverhalt erkannte, machte sie große Augen, pfiff vor sich hin, hielt sich aber nicht lange auf, sondern riß die Tür des Schlafzimmers auf und rief mit lauter Stimme in das Dunkel hinein: »Sehen Sie nur mal an, es ist krepiert; da liegt es, ganz und gar krepiert!«","When the waitress came early in the morning - out of sheer energy and haste, she slammed all the doors so shut, as often as she had been asked not to do this, that from the moment she arrived it was no longer possible to sleep peacefully in the whole apartment - , she didn't find anything out of the ordinary at first during her usual short visit to Gregor. She thought he was lying there motionless on purpose, pretending to be offended; she credited him with all sorts of sense. Because she happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the door. When there was no success there either, she got angry and pushed into Gregor a little, and only noticed when she had pushed him from his place without any resistance. When she soon realized the true state of affairs, she widened her eyes, whistled to herself, but didn't linger long, instead jerking open the door of the bedroom and calling out into the darkness in a loud voice: ""Just look at it is dead there it lies, utterly dead!”","When the charwoman came early in the morning—from sheer energy and impatience she always slammed all the doors, no matter how many times she had been asked not to, so it was impossible for anyone to sleep peacefully after her arrival—she found nothing unusual during her brief customary visit to Gregor’s room. She thought he was lying motionless on purpose, pretending to sulk; she imbued him with all manner of intelligence. Since she happened to be holding the long broom, she tried to tickle him from the doorway. When this produced no response she became annoyed and began to jab at Gregor; it was only when her shoves were met with no resistance and moved him from his place that she became alerted. She soon grasped the truth of the matter; her eyes went wide and she gave a low whistle but did not hesitate to tear open the Samsas’ bedroom door and yell into the dark: “Come and look at this , it’s croaked; it’s lying there, dead as a doornail!”","Early in the morning the cleaning woman came. In her sheer energy and haste she banged all the doors (in precisely the way people had already asked her to avoid), so much so that once she arrived a quiet sleep was no longer possible anywhere in the entire apartment. In her custom-arily brief visit to Gregor she at first found nothing special. She thought he lay so immobile there intending to play the offended party. She gave him credit for as complete an understanding as possible. Because she happened to hold the long broom in her hand, she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the door. When that was quite unsuccessful, she became irritated and poked Gregor a little, and only when she had shoved him from his place without any resistance did she become attentive. When she quickly realized the true state of affairs, her eyes grew large, she whistled to herself, but didn’t restrain herself for long. She pulled open the door of the bedroom and yelled in a loud voice into the darkness,‘Come and look. It’s kicked the bucket. It’s lying there, totally snuffed!’","When the charwoman arrived early the next morning, slamming the doors so loudly in her strength and haste—often as she’d been asked to avoid this—that sleep was out of the question anywhere in the apartment after her arrival, her usual cursory visit to Gregor’s room revealed at first nothing out of the ordinary. She thought he was lying there so motionless on purpose, feigning indignation; she considered him perfectly capable of rational thought. Since she happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, she tried tickling Gregor with it from the doorway. When even this had no effect, she grew vexed and began to poke Gregor a little, and only when she had actually shifted him from the spot where he lay with no resistance at all were her suspicions roused. When soon thereafter the facts of the matter became clear to her, she gawked in surprise, gave a low whistle, then without further delay flung open the door of the bedroom and in a loud voice shouted into the darkness: “Come have a look, it’s gone and croaked—just lying there, dead as a doornail!”"
"Schon im Laufe des ersten Tages legte der Vater die ganzen Vermögensverhältnisse und Aussichten sowohl der Mutter als auch der Schwester dar. Hie und da stand er vom Tische auf und holte aus seiner kleinen Wertheimkassa, die er aus dem vor fünf Jahren erfolgten Zusammenbruch seines Geschäftes gerettet hatte, irgendeinen Beleg oder irgendein Vormerkbuch. Man hörte, wie er das komplizierte Schloß aufsperrte und nach Entnahme des Gesuchten wieder verschloß. Diese Erklärungen des Vaters waren zum Teil das erste Erfreuliche, was Gregor seit seiner Gefangenschaft zu hören bekam. Er war der Meinung gewesen, daß dem Vater von jenem Geschäft her nicht das Geringste übriggeblieben war, zumindest hatte ihm der Vater nichts Gegenteiliges gesagt, und Gregor allerdings hatte ihn auch nicht darum gefragt. Gregors Sorge war damals nur gewesen, alles daranzusetzen, um die Familie das geschäftliche Unglück, das alle in eine vollständige Hoffnungslosigkeit gebracht hatte, möglichst rasch vergessen zu lassen. Und so hatte er damals mit ganz besonderem Feuer zu arbeiten angefangen und war fast über Nacht aus einem kleinen Kommis ein Reisender geworden, der natürlich ganz andere Möglichkeiten des Geldverdienens hatte, und dessen Arbeitserfolge sich sofort in Form der Provision zu Bargeld verwandelten, das der erstaunten und beglückten Familie zu Hause auf den Tisch gelegt werden konnte. Es waren schöne Zeiten gewesen, und niemals nachher hatten sie sich, wenigstens in diesem Glanze, wiederholt, trotzdem Gregor später so viel Geld verdiente, daß er den Aufwand der ganzen Familie zu tragen imstande war und auch trug. Man hatte sich eben daran gewöhnt, sowohl die Familie, als auch Gregor, man nahm das Geld dankbar an, er lieferte es gern ab, aber eine besondere Wärme wollte sich nicht mehr ergeben. Nur die Schwester war Gregor doch noch nahe geblieben, und es war sein geheimer Plan, sie, die zum Unterschied von Gregor Musik sehr liebte und rührend Violine zu spielen verstand, nächstes Jahr, ohne Rücksicht auf die großen Kosten, die das verursachen mußte, und die man schon auf andere Weise hereinbringen würde, auf das Konservatorium zu schicken. Öfters während der kurzen Aufenthalte Gregors in der Stadt wurde in den Gesprächen mit der Schwester das Konservatorium erwähnt, aber immer nur als schöner Traum, an dessen Verwirklichung nicht zu denken war, und die Eltern hörten nicht einmal diese unschuldigen Erwähnungen gern; aber Gregor dachte sehr bestimmt daran und beabsichtigte, es am Weihnachtsabend feierlich zu erklären.","Already in the course of the first day the father presented all the financial circumstances and prospects of both the mother and the sister. Now and then he got up from the table and took from his small safe deposit box, which he had saved from the collapse of his business five years ago had any receipt or any ledger. You could hear him unlocking the complicated lock and locking it again after taking what he was looking for. These statements by the father were in part the first good news Gregor had heard since his imprisonment. He had been of the opinion that his father hadn't got the slightest thing left from that business, at least his father hadn't told him anything to the contrary, and Gregor certainly hadn't asked him about it either. Gregor's only concern at the time was to do everything in his power to make the family forget as quickly as possible the business misfortune that had left everyone in complete despair. And so he started to work with a very special passion and almost overnight the small clerk became a traveler who of course had completely different ways of earning money, and whose work successes immediately turned into cash in the form of commissions, which amazed him and happy family could be put on the table at home. There had been good times, and they had never been repeated, at least in this splendor, although Gregor later earned so much money that he was able and still was able to bear the expenses of the whole family. One had just gotten used to it, both the family and Gregor, they gratefully accepted the money, he was happy to hand it over, but there was no longer any particular warmth. Only his sister remained close to Gregor, and it was his secret plan to have her, who, unlike Gregor, loved music very much and knew how to play the violin touchingly, next year, regardless of the great expense that would have to cause, and which one would bring in in any other way, to send to the conservatory. During Gregor's short stays in the city, the conservatory was often mentioned in conversations with his sister, but always only as a nice dream that was out of the question of realizing, and the parents didn't even like to hear these innocent mentions; but Gregory was very definitely thinking of it, and intended to solemnly declare it on Christmas Eve.","In the course of the very first day, the father explained the family’s financial position and prospects to both the mother and the sister. Now and then he rose from the table to get some receipt or notebook from the small safe he had managed to rescue from the collapse of his business five years earlier. He could be heard opening the complicated lock, removing the desired document, and closing it again. The father’s explanations were the first encouraging news Gregor had heard since his captivity. He had been of the opinion that nothing had been salvaged from the father’s business; at least the father had said nothing to the contrary, although Gregor had also never asked him. Gregor’s only concern at that time had been to do whatever he could to have the family forget as quickly as possible the financial misfortune that had plunged them into total despair. And so he began to work with consuming energy and was promoted, almost overnight, from a minor clerk to a traveling salesman with much greater potential to earn money, and his success was soon transformed, by way of commission, into cash that he could then lay on the table before the astonished and delighted family. Those had been happy times and they had never returned, at least not with the same brilliance, even though Gregor later earned enough to meet the expenses of the entire family and did so. They had simply grown used to it, both the family and Gregor; the money was gratefully accepted and gladly given but it no longer brought any particular warmth. Only the sister remained close to Gregor, and it was his secret plan that she, who unlike Gregor greatly loved music and played the violin movingly, should be sent to the Conservatory next year despite the considerable expense it was sure to incur, which would just have to be met in some other way. During Gregor’s short stays in the city, the Conservatory would often come up in conversation with the sister but always as a beautiful dream that could never be realized. The parents were displeased to hear even these innocent allusions, but Gregor had very definite ideas about it and intended to announce his plan on Christmas Eve.","Already during the first day his father laid out all the financial circumstances and prospects to his mother and to his sister as well. From time to time he stood up from the table and pulled out of the small lockbox salvaged from his business, which had collapsed five years previously, some document or other or some notebook. The sound was audible as he opened up the complicated lock and, after removing what he was looking for, locked it up again. These explanations by his father were, in part, the first enjoyable thing that Gregor had the chance to listen to since his imprisonment. He had thought that nothing at all was left over for his father from that business; at least his father had told him nothing to the contradict that view, and Gregor in any case hadn’t asked him about it. At the time Gregor’s only concern had been to devote everything he had in order to allow his family to forget as quickly as possible the business misfortune which had brought them all into a state of complete hopelessness. And so at that point he’d started to work with a special intensity and from an assistant had become, almost overnight, a traveling salesman, who naturally had entirely different possibilities for earning money and whose successes at work at once were converted into the form of cash commissions, which could be set out on the table at home in front of his astonished and delighted family. Those had been beautiful days, and they had never come back afterwards, at least not with the same splendour, in spite of the fact that Gregor later earned so much money that he was in a position to bear the expenses of the entire family, expenses which he, in fact, did bear. They had become quite accustomed to it, both the family and Gregor as well. They took the money with thanks, and he happily surrendered it, but the special warmth was no longer present. Only the sister had remained still close to Gregor, and it was his secret plan to send her ( in contrast to Gregor she loved music very much and knew how to play the violin charmingly) next year to the conservatory, regardless of the great expense which that must necessitate and which would be made up in other ways. Now and then during Gregor’s short stays in the city the conservatory was mentioned in conversations with his sister, but always only as a beautiful dream, whose realization was unimaginable, and their parents never listened to these innocent expectations with pleasure. But Gregor thought about them with scrupulous consideration and intended to explain the matter ceremoni-ously on Christmas Eve.","Already in the course of the first day, Gregor’s father explained the family’s finances and prospects not only to Gregor’s mother but to his sister as well. Now and then he would get up from the table and, from his small Wertheim safe, which he had salvaged when his business collapsed five years before, extract some receipt or memorandum book. One could hear him opening the complicated lock and then bolting it shut again after removing the desired item. These explanations on his father’s part included the first bits of heartening news Gregor had heard since his captivity began. He had been under the impression that his father had retained nothing at all of his former firm’s holdings, or at least his father had never said anything to the contrary, and admittedly Gregor himself had never asked him about this. At the time, his only concern had been to do everything in his power to let the family forget, as quickly as possible, the mercantile catastrophe that had plunged all of them into a state of utter hopelessness. And so he had set to work with particular zeal and risen almost overnight from petty clerk to salesman, in which capacity of course he had a quite different earning potential, and his professional accomplishments, in the form of commissions, were immediately transformed into cash that could be plunked down on the table at home, before the eyes of his astonished, delighted family. Those had been lovely times, and never since had they been repeated, at least not with such glory, although Gregor later earned so much money that he was in a position to cover the expenses for the entire family, which he then did. All had grown accustomed to this arrangement, not just the family but Gregor as well: they gratefully accepted the money, and he was happy to provide it, but the exchange no longer felt particularly warm. Only Gregor’s sister had remained close to him all this time, and it was his secret plan to send her off to study at the Conservatory next year (unlike Gregor, she dearly loved music and could play the violin quite movingly), despite the considerable costs this would no doubt entail, money that could surely be brought in by other means. Often during the brief periods of time Gregor spent in town, the Conservatory would come up in his conversations with his sister, but only ever as a lovely dream whose realization was unthinkable, and their parents did not like to hear it mentioned even in this innocuous way; but Gregor was thinking the matter over with great determination and intended to make a formal announcement on Christmas Eve."
"»Weg muß es,« rief die Schwester, »das ist das einzige Mittel, Vater. Du mußt bloß den Gedanken loszuwerden suchen, daß es Gregor ist. Daß wir es so lange geglaubt haben, das ist ja unser eigentliches Unglück. Aber wie kann es denn Gregor sein? Wenn es Gregor wäre, er hätte längst eingesehen, daß ein Zusammenleben von Menschen mit einem solchen Tier nicht möglich ist, und wäre freiwillig fortgegangen. Wir hätten dann keinen Bruder, aber könnten weiter leben und sein Andenken in Ehren halten. So aber verfolgt uns dieses Tier, vertreibt die Zimmerherren, will offenbar die ganze Wohnung einnehmen und uns auf der Gasse übernachten lassen. Sieh nur, Vater,« schrie sie plötzlich auf, »er fängt schon wieder an!« Und in einem für Gregor gänzlich unverständlichen Schrecken verließ die Schwester sogar die Mutter, stieß sich förmlich von ihrem Sessel ab, als wollte sie lieber die Mutter opfern, als in Gregors Nähe bleiben, und eilte hinter den Vater, der, lediglich durch ihr Benehmen erregt, auch aufstand und die Arme wie zum Schutze der Schwester vor ihr halb erhob.","""It has to go,"" cried my sister, ""that's the only way, father. You just have to try to get rid of the thought that it's Gregor. That we believed it for so long is our real misfortune. But how can it be Gregor? If it were Gregor, he would have realized long ago that it was not possible for people to live with such an animal and would have left voluntarily. We wouldn't have a brother then, but we could live on and cherish his memory. As it is, this animal is chasing us, driving out the landlords, apparently wanting to take over the whole apartment and let us spend the night in the street. Look, father,' she suddenly cried out, 'he's starting again!' And with a shock that Gregor found completely incomprehensible, the sister even left his mother, literally pushing herself off her chair, as if she'd rather sacrifice her mother. than stay close to Gregor, and hurried behind the father, who, excited only by her behavior, got up and half raised his arms as if to protect his sister in front of her.","“It has to go,” the sister cried, “that’s the only way, Father. You have to try to stop thinking that this is Gregor. Our true misfortune is that we’ve believed it so long. But how can it be Gregor? Because Gregor would have understood long ago that people can’t possibly live with such a creature, and he would have gone away of his own accord. Then we would have no brother, but we could go on living and honor his memory. But instead this creature persecutes us and drives out the boarders; it obviously wants to take over the whole apartment and throw us out into the gutter. Just look, Father,” she suddenly screamed, “he’s at it again!” And in a state of panic that was totally incomprehensible to Gregor —she even abandoned the mother, she literally bolted from the chair as if she would rather sacrifice the mother than stay in the vicinity of Gregor—she rushed behind the father, who got to his feet only out of agitation from her behavior and half-raised his arms as if to protect her.","‘It must be gotten rid of,’ cried the sister; ‘That is the only way, father. You must try to get rid of the idea that this is Gregor. The fact that we have believed for so long, that is truly our real misfortune. But how can it be Gregor? If it were Gregor, he would have long ago realized that a com-munal life among human beings is not possible with such an animal and would have gone away voluntarily. Then we would not have a brother, but we could go on living and honour his memory. But this animal plagues us. It drives away the lodgers, will obviously take over the entire apartment, and leave us to spend the night in the alley. Just look, father,’ she suddenly cried out, ‘he’s already starting up again.’ With a fright which was totally incomprehensible to Gregor, the sister even left the mother, pushed herself away from her chair, as if she would sooner sacrifice her mother than remain in Gregor’s vicinity, and rushed behind her father who, excited merely by her behaviour, also stood up and half raised his arms in front of the sister as though to protect her.","“It has to go,” Gregor’s sister cried out, “that’s the only way, Father. You just have to try to let go of the notion that this thing is Gregor. The real disaster is that we believed this for so long. But how could it be Gregor? If it were Gregor, it would have realized a long time ago that it just isn’t possible for human beings to live beside such a creature, and it would have gone away on its own. We still would have been lacking a brother but we would have been able to go on living and honoring his memory. But now we have this beast tormenting us; it drives away our lodgers and apparently intends to take over the entire apartment and have us sleep in the gutter. Just look, Father,” she suddenly shrieked, “he’s starting again!” And in a fright that Gregor found bewildering, she now went so far as to leave her mother behind, launching herself from her chair as if she would rather sacrifice her mother than remain in Gregor’s proximity, and ran to take cover behind her father who, agitated by the way she was carrying on, rose from his own chair and half-raised his arms as if to shield her."
"Die Schwester eilte zur Mutter und hielt ihr die Stirn. Der Vater schien durch die Worte der Schwester auf bestimmtere Gedanken gebracht zu sein, hatte sich aufrecht gesetzt, spielte mit seiner Dienermütze zwischen den Tellern, die noch vom Nachtmahl der Zimmerherren her auf dem Tische standen, und sah bisweilen auf den stillen Gregor hin.","The sister rushed to her mother and held her forehead. The father seemed to have been given more definite thoughts by his sister's words, sat up straight, played with his servant's cap between the plates that were still on the table from the landlords' supper, and occasionally looked at the quiet Gregor.","The sister rushed to the mother and cradled her forehead. The father’s thoughts seemed to have cleared in the aftermath of the sister’s words; he sat up straight, played with the cap of his uniform among the dishes that still lay on the table from the boarders’ supper, and from time to time glanced over at Gregor’s inert form.","The sister hurried over to her mother and held her fore-head. The sister’s words seemed to have led the father to certain reflections. He sat upright, played with his uniform hat among the plates, which still lay on the table from the lodgers’ evening meal, and looked now and then at the motionless Gregor.","Gregor’s sister hurried over to her mother and held her forehead. Her words seemed to have given her father an idea, for he now sat up straight, playing with his uniform cap between the plates left behind on the table from the lodgers’ supper and glancing over from time to time at a quiet Gregor."
"Und er sah zur Weckuhr hinüber, die auf dem Kasten tickte. »Himmlischer Vater!« dachte er, Es war halb sieben Uhr, und die Zeiger gingen ruhig vorwärts, es war sogar halb vorüber, es näherte sich schon dreiviertel. Sollte der Wecker nicht geläutet haben? Man sah vom Bett aus, daß er auf vier Uhr richtig eingestellt war; gewiß hatte er auch geläutet. Ja, aber war es möglich, dieses möbelerschütternde Läuten ruhig zu verschlafen? Nun, ruhig hatte er ja nicht geschlafen, aber wahrscheinlich desto fester. Was aber sollte er jetzt tun? Der nächste Zug ging um sieben Uhr; um den einzuholen, hätte er sich unsinnig beeilen müssen, und die Kollektion war noch nicht eingepackt, und er selbst fühlte sich durchaus nicht besonders frisch und beweglich. Und selbst wenn er den Zug einholte, ein Donnerwetter des Chefs war nicht zu vermeiden, denn der Geschäftsdiener hatte beim Fünfuhrzug gewartet und die Meldung von seiner Versäumnis längst erstattet. Es war eine Kreatur des Chefs, ohne Rückgrat und Verstand. Wie nun, wenn er sich krank meldete? Das wäre aber äußerst peinlich und verdächtig, denn Gregor war während seines fünfjährigen Dienstes noch nicht einmal krank gewesen. Gewiß würde der Chef mit dem Krankenkassenarzt kommen, würde den Eltern wegen des faulen Sohnes Vorwürfe machen und alle Einwände durch den Hinweis auf den Krankenkassenarzt abschneiden, für den es ja überhaupt nur ganz gesunde, aber arbeitsscheue Menschen gibt. Und hätte er übrigens in diesem Falle so ganz unrecht? Gregor fühlte sich tatsächlich, abgesehen von einer nach dem langen Schlaf wirklich überflüssigen Schläfrigkeit, ganz wohl und hatte sogar einen besonders kräftigen Hunger.","And he looked over at the alarm clock ticking on the box. ""Heavenly Father!"" he thought. It was six-thirty and the hands were calmly advancing, it was actually half over, it was already a quarter past. Shouldn't the alarm have rung? You could see from the bed that it was set correctly for four o'clock; he must have rung the bell too. Yes, but was it possible to sleep through this furniture-shattering ringing? Well, he hadn't slept peacefully, but probably all the more soundly. But what should he do now? The next train left at seven o'clock; he would have had to hurry insanely to catch up with him, and the collection wasn't packed yet, and he didn't feel particularly fresh and agile himself. And even if he caught up with the train, the boss couldn't avoid a thunderclap, because the clerk had been waiting for the five o'clock train and had reported his absence long ago. It was a creature of the boss, with no spine or mind. What if he called in sick? But that would be extremely embarrassing and suspicious, since Gregor had not once been ill during his five years of service. Surely the boss would come with the health insurance doctor, would reproach the parents for their lazy son and cut off all objections by pointing to the health insurance doctor, for whom there are only completely healthy but work-shy people. And, by the way, would he be so wrong in this case? Apart from a really superfluous drowsiness after a long sleep, Gregor actually felt quite well and was even particularly hungry.","And he looked at the alarm clock ticking on the bureau. “God Almighty!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were steadily advancing, actually past the half hour and already closer to three quarters past. Did the alarm not ring? One could see from the bed that it was correctly set for four o’clock and so it must have gone off. Yes, but was it possible to sleep through that furniture-rattling ringing? Well, he hadn’t slept peacefully but probably all the sounder for it. But what should he do now? The next train left at seven o’clock, and in order to catch it he would have to rush around like mad, and the sample collection was still unpacked and he was not feeling particularly fresh and energetic. And even if he caught the train, a bawling out from the boss was inescapable, because the office messenger had arrived by the five o’clock train and reported his absence long ago; he was the boss’s creature, mindless and spineless. What if Gregor reported in sick? This would be extremely painful and suspicious, as he had not once been ill during his five-year employment. The boss would certainly come over with the health insurance doctor, reproach the parents for their lazy son, and cut off all excuses by referring to the health insurance doctor, for whom there were only healthy but work-shy people. And would he be so wrong in this case? Actually Gregor felt perfectly well, apart from a drowsiness that was superfluous after so long a sleep; in fact he even had a great appetite.","And he looked over at the alarm clock ticking away by the chest of drawers. ‘Good God,’ he thought. It was half past six, and the hands were going quietly on. It was past the half hour, already nearly quarter to. Could the alarm have failed to ring? One saw from the bed that it was properly set for four o’clock. Certainly it had rung. Yes, but was it possible to sleep through this noise that made the furniture shake? Now, it’s true he’d not slept quietly, but evidently he’d slept all the more deeply. Still, what should he do now? The next train left at seven o’clock. To catch that one, he would have to go in a mad rush. The sample collection wasn’t packed up yet, and he really didn’t feel particularly fresh and active. And even if he caught the train, there was no avoiding a blow up with the boss, because the firm’s errand boy would’ve waited for the five o’clock train and reported the news of his absence long ago. He was the boss’s minion, without backbone or intelligence. Well then, what if he reported in sick? But that would be extremely em-barrassing and suspicious, because during his five years’ service Gregor hadn’t been sick even once. The boss would certainly come with the doctor from the health insurance company and would reproach his parents for their lazy son and cut short all objections with the insurance doctor’s comments; for him everyone was completely healthy but really lazy about work. And besides, would the doctor in this case be totally wrong? Apart from a really excessive drowsi-ness after the long sleep, Gregor in fact felt quite well and even had a really strong appetite.","And he glanced over at the alarm clock ticking away atop the wardrobe. “Heavenly Father!” he thought. It was half past six, and the clock’s hands kept shifting calmly forward, in fact the half-hour had already passed, it was getting on toward six forty-five. Could the alarm have failed to ring? Even from the bed one could see it was properly set for four o’clock; it must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to sleep tranquilly through this furniture-shaking racket? Well, his sleep hadn’t been exactly tranquil, but no doubt that’s why it had been so sound. But what should he do now? The next train was at seven o’clock; to catch it, he would have to rush like a madman, and his sample case wasn’t even packed yet, and he himself felt far from agile or alert. And even if he managed to catch this train, his boss was certain to unleash a thunderstorm of invective upon his head, for the clerk who met the five o’clock train had no doubt long since reported Gregor’s absence. This clerk was the boss’s underling, a creature devoid of backbone and wit. What if he called in sick? But that would be mortifying and also suspicious, since Gregor had never once been ill in all his five years of service. No doubt his boss would come calling with the company doctor, would reproach Gregor’s parents for their son’s laziness, silencing all objections by referring them to this doctor, in whose opinion there existed only healthy individuals unwilling to work. And would the doctor be so terribly wrong in this instance? Aside from a mild drowsiness that was certainly superfluous after so many hours of sleep, Gregor felt perfectly fine; in fact, he was ravenous."
"Die Decke abzuwerfen war ganz einfach; er brauchte sich nur ein wenig aufzublasen und sie fiel von selbst. Aber weiterhin wurde es schwierig, besonders weil er so ungemein breit war. Er hätte Arme und Hände gebraucht, um sich aufzurichten; statt dessen aber hatte er nur die vielen Beinchen, die ununterbrochen in der verschiedensten Bewegung waren und die er überdies nicht beherrschen konnte. Wollte er eines einmal einknicken, so war es das erste, daß er sich streckte; und gelang es ihm endlich, mit diesem Bein das auszuführen, was er wollte, so arbeiteten inzwischen alle anderen, wie freigelassen, in höchster, schmerzlicher Aufregung. »Nur sich nicht im Bett unnütz aufhalten,« sagte sich Gregor.","Throwing off the blanket was easy; he only needed to inflate a little and she fell of her own accord. But it continued to be difficult, especially because he was so immensely wide. He would have needed arms and hands to get up; instead, he only had the many little legs, which were constantly in the most varied of movements and which, moreover, he could not control. If he ever wanted to buckle one, the first thing he did was stretch; and when he finally succeeded in doing what he wanted with this leg, all the others worked meanwhile, as if released, in the greatest, painful excitement. ""Just don't stay in bed uselessly,"" said Gregor to himself.","The coverlet was easy to throw off; he needed only to puff himself up and it fell off by itself. But then things became much more difficult, especially since he was excessively wide. He would have needed arms and hands to prop himself up, instead of which he had only the many little legs that continually waved every which way and which he could not control at all. If he wanted to bend one, it was the first to stretch itself out, and if he finally succeeded in getting this leg to do what he wanted, the others in the meantime, as if set free, waved all the more wildly in painful and frenzied agitation. “There’s no use staying in bed,” Gregor said to himself.","It was very easy to throw aside the blanket. He needed only to push himself up a little, and it fell by itself. But to continue was difficult, particularly because he was so unusually wide. He needed arms and hands to push himself upright. Instead of these, however, he had only many small limbs which were incessantly moving with very different motions and which, in addition, he was unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then it was the first to extend itself, and if he finally succeeded doing with this limb what he wanted, in the meantime all the others, as if left free, moved around in an excessively painful agitation. ‘But I must not stay in bed uselessly,’ said Gregor to himself.","It was simple enough to rid himself of the blanket; he needed only puff himself up a bit, and it fell right off. But the rest proved difficult, not least because he was so exceedingly wide. He would have needed arms and hands to prop himself up; but instead all he had were these many little legs, variously in motion, that he was unable to control. If he tried to bend one leg, it would be the first to straighten; and when he finally succeeded in getting one leg to do his bidding, all the others went flailing about in an unnerving frenzy. “Enough of this lying about uselessly in bed,” Gregor said to himself."
"»Und jetzt?« fragte sich Gregor und sah sich im Dunkeln um. Er machte bald die Entdeckung, daß er sich nun überhaupt nicht mehr rühren konnte. Er wunderte sich darüber nicht, eher kam es ihm unnatürlich vor, daß er sich bis jetzt tatsächlich mit diesen dünnen Beinchen hatte fortbewegen können. Im übrigen fühlte er sich verhältnismäßig behaglich. Er hatte zwar Schmerzen im ganzen Leib, aber ihm war, als würden sie allmählich schwächer und schwächer und würden schließlich ganz vergehen. Den verfaulten Apfel in seinem Rücken und die entzündete Umgebung, die ganz von weichem Staub bedeckt war, spürte er schon kaum. An seine Familie dachte er mit Rührung und Liebe zurück. Seine Meinung darüber, daß er verschwinden müsse, war womöglich noch entschiedener, als die seiner Schwester. In diesem Zustand leeren und friedlichen Nachdenkens blieb er, bis die Turmuhr die dritte Morgenstunde schlug. Den Anfang des allgemeinen Hellerwerdens draußen vor dem Fenster erlebte er noch. Dann sank sein Kopf ohne seinen Willen gänzlich nieder, und aus seinen Nüstern strömte sein letzter Atem schwach hervor.","""And now?"" Gregor asked himself, looking around in the dark. He soon discovered that he could no longer move at all. He wasn't surprised about that, rather it seemed unnatural to him that until now he had actually been able to move around with those thin little legs. Otherwise he felt relatively comfortable. He had pains all over his body, but it seemed to him that they were gradually getting weaker and weaker and would eventually go away completely. He hardly felt the rotten apple on his back and the inflamed area all covered with soft dust. He thought back to his family with emotion and love. His opinion that he had to go was perhaps even more decisive than that of his sister. In this state of vacant and peaceful reflection he remained until the clock in the tower struck three in the morning. He still experienced the beginning of the general lightening outside the window. Then, without his will, his head sank completely, and his last breath flowed feebly from his nostrils.","“What now?” Gregor wondered, peering around in the darkness. He soon discovered that he could no longer move at all. This did not particularly puzzle him, rather it seemed unnatural to him that he had actually been able to walk on these skinny little legs. Otherwise he felt relatively comfortable. Of course his whole body ached, but it seemed to him that the pain was gradually fading and would eventually disappear altogether. He could hardly feel the rotten apple in his back and the enflamed area around it, which were covered over by soft dust. His thoughts, full of tenderness and love, went back to his family. He was even more firmly convinced than his sister, if possible, that he should disappear. He remained in this state of empty and peaceful reflection until the tower clock struck three in the morning. He hung on to see the growing light outside the window. Then his head sank involuntarily to the floor and his last feeble breath streamed from his nostrils.","‘What now?’ Gregor asked himself and looked around him in the darkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all. He was not surprised at that. On the contrary, it struck him as unnatural that he had really been able up to this point to move around with these thin little legs. Besides he felt relatively content. True, he had pains throughout his entire body, but it seemed to him that they were gradually becoming weaker and weaker and would finally go away completely. The rotten apple in his back and the inflamed surrounding area, entirely covered with white dust, he hardly noticed. He remembered his family with deep feeling and love. In this business, his own thought that he had to disappear was, if possible, even more decisive than his sister’s. He remained in this state of empty and peaceful reflection until the tower clock struck three o’clock in the morning. From the window he witnessed the beginning of the general dawning outside. Then without willing it, his head sank all the way down, and from his nos-trils flowed out weakly out his last breath.","“And now?” Gregor wondered, looking around in the dark. He soon made the discovery that he was no longer capable of moving at all. He wasn’t surprised at this; on the contrary, it struck him as unnatural that he had actually until now been able to support himself on those thin little legs. As for the rest, he felt relatively at ease. Admittedly his entire body was racked with pain, but it seemed to him as if it was gradually becoming weaker and weaker and in the end would fade away altogether. Already he could scarcely feel the rotting apple in his back, nor the inflamed area surrounding it, both now enveloped in soft dust. He thought back on his family with tenderness and love. His opinion that he must by all means disappear was possibly even more emphatic than that of his sister. He remained in this state of empty, peaceful reflection until the clocktower struck the third hour of morning. He watched as everything began to lighten outside his window. Then his head sank all the way to the floor without volition and from his nostrils his last breath faintly streamed."
"Erst in der Abenddämmerung erwachte Gregor aus seinem schweren ohnmachtähnlichen Schlaf. Er wäre gewiß nicht viel später auch ohne Störung erwacht, denn er fühlte sich genügend ausgeruht und ausgeschlafen, doch schien es ihm, als hätte ihn ein flüchtiger Schritt und ein vorsichtiges Schließen der zum Vorzimmer führenden Tür geweckt. Der Schein der elektrischen Straßenbahn lag bleich hier und da auf der Zimmerdecke und auf den höheren Teilen der Möbel, aber unten bei Gregor war es finster. Langsam schob er sich, noch ungeschickt mit seinen Fühlern tastend, die er jetzt erst schätzen lernte, zur Türe hin, um nachzusehen, was dort geschehen war. Seine linke Seite schien eine einzige lange, unangenehm spannende Narbe, und er mußte auf seinen zwei Beinreihen regelrecht hinken. Ein Beinchen war übrigens im Laufe der vormittägigen Vorfälle schwer verletzt worden – es war fast ein Wunder, daß nur eines verletzt worden war – und schleppte leblos nach.","It was only at dusk that Gregor woke up from his heavy, fainting sleep. He would certainly not have woken up much later without being disturbed, for he felt sufficiently rested and rested, but it seemed to him as if a fleeting step and a careful closing of the door leading to the hall had awakened him. The glow of the electric tram lay pale here and there on the ceiling and on the higher parts of the furniture, but downstairs at Gregor's it was dark. Slowly, still awkwardly groping with his feelers, which he was only now learning to appreciate, he pushed his way to the door to see what had happened there. His left side appeared to be one long, uncomfortably stretching scar, and he was practically limping on his two rows of legs. Incidentally, a little leg had been badly injured in the course of the morning's incidents - it was almost a miracle that only one had been injured - and was dragging lifeless.","IT WAS TWILIGHT WHEN Gregor awoke from his deep slumber. Even without being disturbed he doubted he would have slept much later, as he felt so well rested, but it seemed to him that a furtive step and a cautious shutting of the foyer door had roused him. The glow of the electric street lamps shone in pale patches on the ceiling and upper parts of the furniture, but where Gregor slept it was dark. Slowly, still groping awkwardly with his antennas, which he was only now learning to appreciate, he pushed himself over to the door to see what had been happening. His left side felt like a single long unpleasantly taut scar and he actually had to limp on his two rows of legs. One little leg, moreover, had been seriously injured during the course of the morning’s events—it was nearly a miracle that only one had been hurt—and dragged behind him lifelessly.","Gregor first woke up from his heavy swoon-like sleep in the evening twilight. He would certainly have woken up soon afterwards without any disturbance, for he felt himself sufficiently rested and wide awake, although it appeared to him as if a hurried step and a cautious closing of the door to the hall had aroused him. The shine of the electric streetlights lay pale here and there on the ceiling and on the higher parts of the furniture, but underneath around Gregor it was dark. He pushed himself slowly toward the door, still groping awkwardly with his feelers, which he now learned to value for the first time, to check what was happening there. His left side seemed one single long un-pleasantly stretched scar, and he really had to hobble on his two rows of legs. In addition, one small leg had been seriously wounded in the course of the morning incident (it was almost a miracle that only one had been hurt) and dragged lifelessly behind.","ONLY AS DUSK WAS FALLING DID GREGOR WAKE from his heavy, faintlike sleep. He probably wouldn’t have slept much longer even without a disturbance, for he felt sufficiently rested and restored, but it seemed to him he had been woken by a fleeting step and the careful shutting of the door to the vestibule. The pallid gleam of the electric streetlamps touched the ceiling here and there and the upper edges of the furniture, but down where Gregor lay, all was dark. Slowly, groping awkwardly with his feelers, which he was only now learning to appreciate, he dragged himself toward the door, wanting to see what had happened. His left side felt like one long unpleasantly contracting scar, and he was forced to limp outright on his two rows of legs. One of these diminutive legs, incidentally, had suffered grievous injuries in the course of the morning’s events —it was almost miraculous only one had been injured—and now trailed lifelessly behind him."
"Kaum war er innerhalb seines Zimmers, wurde die Tür eiligst zugedrückt, festgeriegelt und versperrt. Über den plötzlichen Lärm hinter sich erschrak Gregor so, daß ihm die Beinchen einknickten. Es war die Schwester, die sich so beeilt hatte. Aufrecht war sie schon da gestanden und hatte gewartet, leichtfüßig war sie dann vorwärtsgesprungen, Gregor hatte sie gar nicht kommen hören, und ein »Endlich!« rief sie den Eltern zu, während sie den Schlüssel im Schloß umdrehte.","As soon as he was inside his room, the door was hastily pushed shut, bolted and locked. Gregor was so startled by the sudden noise behind him that his little legs buckled. It was the sister who was in such a hurry. She was already standing there and waiting, then she sprang forward lightly, Gregor hadn't heard her coming at all, and ""Finally!"" she called to her parents as she turned the key in the lock.","He was hardly in his room when the door was shut hastily, then bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind him rattled Gregor so much that the little legs gave way beneath him. It was the sister who had been in such a rush. She had been standing by ready and waiting and had lightly leapt forward before Gregor even heard her coming; “Finally!” she cried to the parents as she turned the key in the lock.","Hardly was he inside his room when the door was pushed shut very quickly, bolted fast, and barred. Gregor was startled by the sudden commotion behind him, so much so that his little limbs bent double under him. It was his sister who had been in such a hurry. She had stood up right away, had waited, and had then sprung forward nimbly. Gregor had not heard anything of her approach.

The sudden commotion at his back gave him such a frightful start that his little legs gave way beneath him. It was his sister who had hurried thus. She had already been standing there upright and waiting, then pounced so lightfootedly Gregor didn’t hear her approach, and she cried out, “Finally!” to her parents as she turned the key in the lock."
