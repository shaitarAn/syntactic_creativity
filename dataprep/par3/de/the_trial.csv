"»Wie ihr hier beieinander sitzt!« rief Leni, die mit der Tasse zurückgekommen war und in der Tür stehenblieb. Sie saßen wirklich eng beisammen, bei der kleinsten Wendung mußten sie mit den Köpfen aneinanderstoßen, der Kaufmann, der, abgesehen von seiner Kleinheit, auch noch den Rücken gekrümmt hielt, hatte K. gezwungen, sich auch tief zu bücken, wenn er alles hören wollte. »Noch ein Weilchen!« rief K. Leni abwehrend zu und zuckte ungeduldig mit der Hand, die er noch immer auf des Kaufmanns Hand liegen hatte. »Er wollte, daß ich ihm von meinem Prozeß erzähle«, sagte der Kaufmann zu Leni. »Erzähle nur, erzähle«, sagte diese. Sie sprach mit dem Kaufmann liebevoll, aber doch auch herablassend, K. gefiel das nicht; wie er jetzt erkannt hatte, hatte der Mann doch einen gewissen Wert, zumindest hatte er Erfahrungen, die er gut mitzuteilen verstand. Leni beurteilte ihn wahrscheinlich unrichtig. Er sah ärgerlich zu, als Leni jetzt dem Kaufmann die Kerze, die er die ganze Zeit über festgehalten hatte, abnahm, ihm die Hand mit ihrer Schürze abwischte und dann neben ihm niederkniete, um etwas Wachs wegzukratzen, das von der Kerze auf seine Hose getropft war. »Sie wollten mir von den Winkeladvokaten erzählen«, sagte K. und schob, ohne eine weitere Bemerkung, Lenis Hand weg. »Was willst du denn?« fragte Leni, schlug leicht nach K. und setzte ihre Arbeit fort. »Ja, von den Winkeladvokaten«, sagte der Kaufmann und fuhr sich über die Stirn, als denke er nach. K. wollte ihm nachhelfen und sagte: »Sie wollten sofortige Erfolge haben und gingen deshalb zu den Winkeladvokaten.« »Ganz richtig«, sagte der Kaufmann, setzte aber nicht fort. »Er will vielleicht vor Leni nicht davon sprechen«, dachte K., bezwang seine Ungeduld, das Weitere gleich jetzt zu hören, und drang nun nicht mehr weiter in ihn.","""How you're sitting here together!"" exclaimed Leni, who had returned with the cup and remained standing in the doorway. They sat really close together, they had to bump their heads at the slightest turn, the merchant, who, despite his small size, also had his back arched, had forced K. to bend down too low if he wanted to hear everything . ""Just a little longer!"" called K. Leni defensively and impatiently twitched his hand, which he still had on the merchant's hand. ""He wanted me to tell him about my trial,"" the businessman said to Leni. ""Just tell, tell,"" she said. She spoke affectionately to the merchant, but also condescendingly, K. didn't like it; as he had now realized, the man had a certain value after all, at least he had experiences that he was good at communicating. Leni probably judged him incorrectly. He watched angrily as Leni took the candle he had been holding the merchant from, wiped his hand with her apron, and then knelt down beside him to scrape away some of the wax that had dripped from the candle onto his trousers was. ""You wanted to tell me about the crooked lawyers,"" said K. and, without further comment, pushed Leni's hand away. ""What do you want?"" Leni asked, slapped K. lightly and went on with her work. ""Yes, from the petty lawyers,"" said the merchant, wiping his forehead as if thinking. K. wanted to give him a hand and said: ""You wanted immediate success and that's why you went to the crooked lawyers."" ""Quite right,"" said the businessman, but didn't continue. ""Maybe he doesn't want to talk about it in front of Leni,"" thought K., suppressing his impatience to hear more right now and pressing him no further.","“Look at the two of you sitting together,” cried Leni, who had returned with the bowl and paused at the door. In fact they were sitting quite close to one another; the slightest turn and they would bump their heads; the merchant, who apart from his short stature also stooped, had forced K. to bend low if he wanted to hear everything. “Just give us another minute,” K. said, putting Leni off, and the hand he still left placed on the merchant’s twitched impatiently. “He wanted me to tell him about my trial,” the merchant said to Leni. “Go ahead and tell him,” she said. She spoke tenderly to the merchant, but condescendingly as well, which didn’t please K; after all, as he now realized, the man had some merit, at least he had experience in these matters and could communicate it. Leni probably judged him unfairly. He watched with annoyance as Leni took the candle from the merchant, who had been gripping it firmly the whole time, wiped his hand with her apron, and then knelt down beside him to scratch away some wax that had dripped onto his trousers. “You were going to tell me about the shysters,” K. said, pushing Leni’s hand away without comment. “What do you think you’re doing?” asked Leni, giving K. a small tap and resuming her task. “Yes, the shysters,” said the merchant, and passed his hand across his brow, as if he were thinking. K. tried to prompt him by saying: “You wanted immediate results and so you went to the shysters.” “That’s right,” said the merchant, but didn’t continue. “Perhaps he doesn’t want to talk about it in front of Leni,” thought K., suppressing his impatience to hear the rest at once and pressing him no further.","""How close you've got!"" cried Leni, who had come back with the soup bowl and was standing in the door- way. They were indeed sitting so close to each other that they must have bumped their heads together at the slightest movement; Block, who was not only a small man but stooped forward as he sat, spoke so low that K. was forced to bend down to hear every word he said. ""Give us a moment or two,"" cried K., warning Leni off; the hand which he still kept on the tradesman's hand twitched with irritation. "" He wanted me to tell him about my case,"" the tradesman said to Leni. "" Well, go on telling him,"" said she. Her tone in speaking to Block was kindly but a little condescending. That annoyed K. ; the man, after all, as he had discovered, possessed a certain value, he had experiences and knew how to communicate them. Leni at least probably misjudged him. To K.'s further annoyance Leni removed the candle, which he had been grasping all this time, wiped his hand with her apron, and knelt down to scratch off some tallow which had dripped on his trousers. ""You were going to tell me about pettifogging lawyers,"" said K., pushing Leni's hand away without comment. ""What do you think you're doing?"" she asked, giving K. a small slap and resuming her task. "" Yes, the pettifogging lawyers,"" said Block, passing his hand over his brow as if in reflection. K. wanted to help him out and added: ""You were looking for immediate results and so you went to the pettifogging lawyers."" ""That's right,"" said Block, but he did not continue. "" Perhaps he doesn't want to talk of it before Leni,"" thought K., suppressing his impatience to hear the rest of the story at once and not urging the man any more.","called Leni as she came back with the dish and stood in the doorway. They were indeed sat close together, if either of them turned his head even slightly it would have knocked against the other's, the businessman was not only very small but also sat hunched down, so that K. was also forced to bend down low if he wanted to hear everything. “Not quite yet!” called out K., to turn Leni away, his hand, still resting on the businessman's hand, twitching with impatience. “He wanted me to tell him about my trial,” said the businessman to Leni. “Carry on, then, carry on,” she said. She spoke to the businessman with affection but, at the same time, with condescension. K. did not like that, he had begun to learn that the man was of some value after all, he had experience at least, and he was willing to share it. Leni was probably wrong about him. He watched her in irritation as Leni now took the candle from the businessman's hand—which he had been holding on to all this time—wiped his hand with her apron and then knelt beside him to scratch off some wax that had dripped from the candle onto his trousers. “You were about to tell me about the petty lawyers,” said K., shoving Leni's hand away with no further comment. “What's wrong with you today?” asked Leni, tapped him gently and carried on with what she had been doing. “Yes, the petty lawyers,” said the businessman, putting his hand to his brow as if thinking hard. K. wanted to help him and said, “You wanted immediate results and so went to the petty lawyers.” “Yes, that's right,” said the businessman, but did not continue with what he'd been saying. “Maybe he doesn't want to speak about it in front of Leni,” thought K., suppressing his impatience to hear the rest straight away, and stopped trying to press him.","called Leni as she came back with the dish and stood in the doorway.

"Das erste Läuten an der Tür des Advokaten war, wie gewöhnlich, zwecklos. »Leni könnte flinker sein«, dachte K. Aber es war schon ein Vorteil, wenn sich nicht die andere Partei einmischte, wie sie es gewöhnlich tat, sei es, daß der Mann im Schlafrock oder sonst jemand zu belästigen anfing. Während K. zum zweitenmal den Knopf drückte, sah er nach der anderen Tür zurück, diesmal aber blieb auch sie geschlossen. Endlich erschienen an dem Guckfenster der Tür des Advokaten zwei Augen, es waren aber nicht Lenis Augen. Jemand schloß die Tür auf, stemmte sich aber vorläufig noch gegen sie, rief in die Wohnung zurück: »Er ist es!« und öffnete erst dann vollständig. K. hatte gegen die Tür gedrängt, denn schon hörte er, wie hinter ihm in der Tür der anderen Wohnung der Schlüssel hastig im Schloß gedreht wurde. Als sich daher die Tür vor ihm endlich öffnete, stürmte er geradezu ins Vorzimmer und sah noch, wie durch den Gang, der zwischen den Zimmern hindurchführte, Leni, welcher der Warnungsruf des Türöffners gegolten hatte, im Hemd davonlief. Er blickte ihr ein Weilchen nach und sah sich dann nach dem Türöffner um. Es war ein kleiner, dürrer Mann mit Vollbart, er hielt eine Kerze in der Hand. »Sie sind hier angestellt?« fragte K. »Nein«, antwortete der Mann, »ich bin hier fremd, der Advokat ist nur mein Vertreter, ich bin hier wegen einer Rechtsangelegenheit.« »Ohne Rock?« fragte K. und zeigte mit einer Handbewegung auf die mangelhafte Bekleidung des Mannes. »Ach, verzeihen Sie!« sagte der Mann und beleuchtete sich selbst mit der Kerze, als sähe er selbst zum erstenmal seinen Zustand. »Leni ist Ihre Geliebte?« fragte K. kurz. Er hatte die Beine ein wenig gespreizt, die Hände, in denen er den Hut hielt, hinten verschlungen. Schon durch den Besitz eines starken Überrocks fühlte er sich dem mageren Kleinen sehr überlegen. »O Gott«, sagte der und hob die eine Hand in erschrockener Abwehr vor das Gesicht, »nein, nein, was denken Sie denn?« »Sie sehen glaubwürdig aus«, sagte K. lächelnd, »trotzdem – kommen Sie.« Er winkte ihm mit dem Hut und ließ ihn vor sich gehen. »Wie heißen Sie denn?« fragte K. auf dem Weg. »Block, Kaufmann Block«, sagte der Kleine und drehte sich bei dieser Vorstellung nach K. um, stehenbleiben ließ ihn aber K. nicht. »Ist das Ihr wirklicher Name?« fragte K. »Gewiß«, war die Antwort, »warum haben Sie denn Zweifel?« »Ich dachte, Sie könnten Grund haben, Ihren Namen zu verschweigen«, sagte K. Er fühlte sich so frei, wie man es sonst nur ist, wenn man in der Fremde mit niedrigen Leuten spricht, alles, was einen selbst betrifft, bei sich behält, nur gleichmütig von den Interessen der anderen redet, sie dadurch vor sich selbst erhöht, aber auch nach Belieben fallen lassen kann. Bei der Tür des Arbeitszimmers des Advokaten blieb K. stehen, öffnete sie und rief dem Kaufmann, der folgsam weitergegangen war, zu: »Nicht so eilig! Leuchten Sie hier!« K. dachte, Leni könnte sich hier versteckt haben, er ließ den Kaufmann alle Winkel absuchen, aber das Zimmer war leer. Vor dem Bild des Richters hielt K. den Kaufmann hinten an den Hosenträgern zurück. »Kennen Sie den?« fragte er und zeigte mit dem Zeigefinger in die Höhe. Der Kaufmann hob die Kerze, sah blinzelnd hinauf und sagte: »Es ist ein Richter.« »Ein hoher Richter?« fragte K. und stellte sich seitlich vor den Kaufmann, um den Eindruck, den das Bild auf ihn machte, zu beobachten. Der Kaufmann sah bewundernd aufwärts. »Es ist ein hoher Richter«, sagte er. »Sie haben keinen großen Einblick«, sagte K. »Unter den niedrigen Untersuchungsrichtern ist er der niedrigste.« »Nun erinnere ich mich«, sagte der Kaufmann und senkte die Kerze, »ich habe es auch schon gehört.« »Aber natürlich«, rief K., »ich vergaß ja, natürlich müssen Sie es schon gehört haben.« »Aber warum denn, warum denn«? fragte der Kaufmann, während er sich, von K. mit den Händen angetrieben, zur Tür fortbewegte. Draußen auf dem Gang sagte K.: »Sie wissen doch, wo sich Leni versteckt hat?« »Versteckt?« sagte der Kaufmann, »nein, sie dürfte aber in der Küche sein und dem Advokaten eine Suppe kochen.« »Warum haben Sie das nicht gleich gesagt?« fragte K. »Ich wollte Sie ja hinführen, Sie haben mich aber wieder zurückgerufen«, antwortete der Kaufmann, wie verwirrt durch die widersprechenden Befehle. »Sie glauben wohl sehr schlau zu sein«, sagte K., »führen Sie mich also!« In der Küche war K. noch nie gewesen, sie war überraschend groß und reich ausgestattet. Allein der Herd war dreimal so groß wie gewöhnliche Herde, von dem übrigen sah man keine Einzelheiten, denn die Küche wurde jetzt nur von einer kleinen Lampe beleuchtet, die beim Eingang hing. Am Herd stand Leni in weißer Schürze, wie immer, und leerte Eier in einen Topf aus, der auf einem Spiritusfeuer stand. »Guten Abend, Josef«, sagte sie mit einem Seitenblick. »Guten Abend«, sagte K. und zeigte mit einer Hand auf einen abseits stehenden Sessel, auf den sich der Kaufmann setzen sollte, was dieser auch tat. K. aber ging ganz nahe hinter Leni, beugte sich über ihre Schulter und fragte: »Wer ist der Mann?« Leni umfaßte K. mit einer Hand, die andere quirlte die Suppe, zog ihn nach vorn zu sich und sagte: »Es ist ein bedauernswerter Mensch, ein armer Kaufmann, ein gewisser Block. Sieh ihn nur an.« Sie blickten beide zurück. Der Kaufmann saß auf dem Sessel, auf den ihn K. gewiesen hatte, er hatte die Kerze, deren Licht jetzt unnötig war, ausgepustet und drückte mit den Fingern den Docht, um den Rauch zu verhindern. »Du warst im Hemd«, sagte K. und wendete ihren Kopf mit der Hand wieder dem Herd zu. Sie schwieg. »Er ist dein Geliebter?« fragte K. Sie wollte nach dem Suppentopf greifen, aber K. nahm ihre beiden Hände und sagte: »Nun antworte!« Sie sagte: »Komm ins Arbeitszimmer, ich werde dir alles erklären.« »Nein«, sagte K., »ich will, daß du es hier erklärst.« Sie hing sich an ihn und wollte ihn küssen. K. wehrte sie aber ab und sagte: »Ich will nicht, daß du mich jetzt küßt.« »Josef«, sagte Leni und sah K. bittend und doch offen in die Augen, »du wirst doch nicht auf Herrn Block eifersüchtig sein. – Rudi«, sagte sie dann, sich an den Kaufmann wendend, »so hilf mir doch, du siehst, ich werde verdächtigt, laß die Kerze.« Man hätte denken können, er hätte nicht achtgegeben, aber er war vollständig eingeweiht. »Ich wüßte auch nicht, warum Sie eifersüchtig sein sollten«, sagte er wenig schlagfertig. »Ich weiß es eigentlich auch nicht«, sagte K. und sah den Kaufmann lächelnd an. Leni lachte laut, benützte die Unaufmerksamkeit K.s, um sich in seinen Arm einzuhängen, und flüsterte: »Laß ihn jetzt, du siehst ja, was für ein Mensch er ist. Ich habe mich seiner ein wenig angenommen, weil er eine große Kundschaft des Advokaten ist, aus keinem andern Grund. Und du? Willst du noch heute mit dem Advokaten sprechen? Er ist heute sehr krank, aber wenn du willst, melde ich dich doch an. Über Nacht bleibst du aber bei mir, ganz gewiß. Du warst auch schon so lange nicht bei uns, selbst der Advokat hat nach dir gefragt. Vernachlässige den Prozeß nicht! Auch ich habe dir Verschiedenes mitzuteilen, was ich erfahren habe. Nun aber zieh fürs erste deinen Mantel aus!« Sie half ihm, sich ausziehen, nahm ihm den Hut ab, lief mit den Sachen ins Vorzimmer, sie anzuhängen, lief dann wieder zurück und sah nach der Suppe. »Soll ich zuerst dich anmelden oder ihm zuerst die Suppe bringen?« »Melde mich zuerst an«, sagte K. Er war ärgerlich, er hatte ursprünglich beabsichtigt, mit Leni seine Angelegenheit, insbesondere die fragliche Kündigung genau zu besprechen, die Anwesenheit des Kaufmanns hatte ihm aber die Lust dazu genommen. Jetzt aber hielt er seine Sache doch für zu wichtig, als daß dieser kleine Kaufmann vielleicht entscheidend eingreifen sollte, und so rief er Leni, die schon auf dem Gang war, wieder zurück. »Bring ihm doch zuerst die Suppe«, sagte er, »er soll sich für die Unterredung mit mir stärken, er wird es nötig haben.« »Sie sind auch ein Klient des Advokaten«, sagte, wie zur Feststellung, der Kaufmann leise aus seiner Ecke. Es wurde aber nicht gut aufgenommen. »Was kümmert Sie denn das?« sagte K., und Leni sagte: »Wirst du still sein. – Dann bringe ich ihm also zuerst die Suppe«, sagte Leni zu K. und goß die Suppe auf einen Teller. »Es ist dann nur zu befürchten, daß er bald einschläft, nach dem Essen schläft er bald ein.« »Das, was ich ihm sagen werde, wird ihn wacherhalten«, sagte K., er wollte immerfort durchblicken lassen, daß er etwas Wichtiges mit dem Advokaten zu verhandeln beabsichtige, er wollte von Leni gefragt werden, was es sei, und dann erst sie um Rat fragen. Aber sie erfüllte pünktlich bloß die ausgesprochenen Befehle. Als sie mit der Tasse an ihm vorüberging, stieß sie absichtlich sanft an ihn und flüsterte: »Wenn er die Suppe gegessen hat, melde ich dich gleich an, damit ich dich möglichst bald wiederbekomme.« »Geh nur«, sagte K., »geh nur.« »Sei doch freundlicher«, sagte sie und drehte sich in der Tür mit der Tasse nochmals ganz um.","The first ring at the lawyer's door was useless, as usual. ""Leni could be quicker,"" thought K. But it was an advantage if the other party didn't get involved, as they usually did, whether it was the man in the dressing gown or someone else starting to bother you. While K. pressed the button for the second time, he looked back at the other door, but this time it stayed closed too. Finally two eyes appeared in the window of the lawyer's door, but they weren't Leni's eyes. Someone unlocked the door, but braced himself against it for the time being, called back into the apartment: ""It's him!"" and only then opened it fully. K. had pushed against the door because he already heard the key being hastily turned in the lock behind him in the door of the other apartment. So when the door in front of him finally opened, he stormed straight into the antechamber and watched Leni running away in her shirt down the corridor that led between the rooms. He watched her go for a while and then looked around for the door opener. It was a small, thin man with a full beard, holding a candle in his hand. ""You're employed here?"" asked K. ""No,"" answered the man, ""I'm a stranger here, the lawyer is just my representative, I'm here on a legal matter."" ""Without a coat?"" asked K., pointing a wave of the hand to the man's inadequate clothing. ""Oh, pardon me,"" said the man, lighting himself with the candle, as if seeing his condition for the first time. ""Leni is your mistress?"" asked K. briefly. He had spread his legs a little, his hands, holding his hat, clasped behind him. Just by owning a thick overcoat, he felt very superior to the skinny little one. ""Oh God,"" he said, raising one hand in front of his face in shocked defence, ""no, no, what do you think?"" ""You look credible,"" said K. with a smile, ""nevertheless - come along."" He waved his hat at him and let him go ahead. ""What's your name?"" asked K. on the way. ""Block, Kaufmann Block,"" said the little boy and turned to K. at the thought, but K. didn't let him stop. ""Is that your real name?"" asked K. ""Certainly,"" was the answer, ""why do you have doubts?"" ""I thought you might have reason to withhold your name,"" said K. He felt so free , as one is otherwise only when one talks to lowly people in a foreign country, keeps everything that concerns oneself to oneself, only talks indifferently about the interests of others, thereby elevating them in front of oneself, but also falling at will can let. K. stopped at the door of the lawyer's study, opened it and called to the businessman, who had obediently walked on: ""Don't rush! Light up here!' K. thought Leni might have been hiding here, he had the businessman search every corner, but the room was empty. In front of the judge's picture, K. held the businessman back by his suspenders. ""Do you know him?"" he asked, pointing up with his index finger. The merchant lifted the candle, blinked, and said: ""It's a judge."" ""A high judge?"" asked K., standing sideways in front of the merchant to observe the impression the picture made on him. The merchant looked up in admiration. ""It's a high judge,"" he said. ""You don't have much insight,"" said K. ""Of the lowly examining magistrates, he's the lowest."" ""Now I remember,"" said the merchant, lowering the candle, ""I've heard it before."" ""Of course."" cried K., ""I forgot, of course you must have heard it by now."" ""But why, why?""? asked the merchant as he made his way towards the door, urged on by K. with his hands. Outside in the corridor, K. said, ""You know where Leni is hiding?"" ""Hidden?"" said the merchant, ""No, but she should be in the kitchen making soup for the lawyer."" Didn't you say that right away?' asked K. 'I wanted to take you there, but you called me back,' replied the businessman, confused by the contradictory orders. ""You think you're very clever,"" said K., ""so lead me!"" K. had never been in the kitchen, it was surprisingly large and richly equipped. The hearth alone was three times the size of ordinary hearths, and no details could be seen of the rest, for the kitchen was now lit only by a small lamp that hung by the entrance. Leni stood at the stove in a white apron, as always, and emptied eggs into a pot that was on an alcohol fire. ""Good evening, Josef,"" she said with a sideways glance. ""Good evening,"" said K., pointing to a chair standing to the side for the businessman to sit down on, which he did. But K. walked very close behind Leni, leaned over her shoulder and asked: ""Who is the man?"" Leni put one hand around K., the other whisked the soup, pulled him forward and said: ""It is a pitiable man, a poor merchant, a certain block. Just look at him.” They both looked back. The merchant was sitting on the chair that K. had pointed out to him, he had blown out the candle, which no longer needed any light, and was squeezing the wick with his fingers to stop the smoke. ""You were in your shirt,"" said K. and turned her head back to the stove with her hand. She said nothing. ""He's your lover?"" asked K. She wanted to reach for the soup pot, but K. took both her hands and said: ""Now answer me!"" She said: ""Come into the study, I'll explain everything to you."" ""No."" , said K., ""I want you to explain it here."" She clung to him and wanted to kiss him. But K. fought her off and said, ""I don't want you to kiss me now."" ""Josef,"" said Leni, looking pleadingly but openly into K.'s eyes, ""you won't be jealous of Mr. Block. - Rudi,"" she then said, turning to the merchant, ""help me, you see, I'm suspected, leave the candle alone."" One might have thought he hadn't been paying attention, but he was fully in the know. ""I don't see why you should be jealous either,"" he said with little wit. ""I don't really know either,"" said K. and smiled at the businessman. Leni laughed out loud, used K.'s inattentiveness to put her arm around him and whispered: 'Leave him alone, you can see what kind of person he is. I took a little care of him because he is a big client of the lawyer, for no other reason. And you? Do you want to speak to the attorney today? He's very ill today, but if you want I'll put you on the phone. But you will stay with me overnight, of course. You haven't been with us for so long, even the lawyer asked for you. Don't neglect the process! I also have various things to tell you that I have experienced. Now, for now, take off your coat.” She helped him undress, took off his hat, ran into the hall with the things to hang them up, then ran back and looked at the soup. ""Should I announce you first or bring him his soup first?"" ""Announce me first,"" said K. He was angry, he had originally intended to discuss his affair with Leni in detail, especially the termination in question, the presence of the businessman but he didn't want to do it. Now, however, he considered his cause too important for this small businessman to intervene decisively, and so he called Leni back, who was already in the corridor. ""Bring him the soup first,"" he said, ""he'll have to fortify himself for the interview with me, he'll need it."" ""You're also a client of the lawyer,"" said the merchant softly, as if to state his point his corner. However, it was not well received. “What do you care about that?” said K., and Leni said: “Will you be quiet. ""So I'll bring him the soup first,"" Leni said to K. and poured the soup onto a plate. ""The only fear is that he'll soon fall asleep, after eating he'll soon fall asleep."" ""What I'm going to say to him will keep him awake,"" said K., he always wanted to let it be known that he was doing something important to negotiate with the lawyer, he wanted Leni to ask what it was and only then ask her for advice. But she just carried out punctually the orders that were given. As she passed him with the cup, she deliberately nudged him gently and whispered: ""Once he's eaten the soup, I'll let you know right away, so I can get you back as soon as possible."" ""Just go,"" said K., "" Just go.' 'Be nicer,' she said, turning round again in the doorway with the cup.","The first ring at the lawyer’s door was, as usual, in vain. “Leni could be a little quicker,” thought K. But it would be good fortune enough just not to have a third party mix in, as they often did, whether it was the man in the dressing gown or someone else who started interfering. As K. pressed the button a second time, he looked back at the other door, but this time it too remained closed. Finally two eyes appeared at the peephole in the lawyer’s door, but they weren’t Leni’s. Someone unlocked the door, braced himself against it for the moment, however, called back into the apartment “It’s him,” and only then opened the door wide. K. had pressed up against the door, for behind him he could hear the key being turned hastily in the lock of the door to the other apartment. Thus, when the door suddenly gave way before him, he practically stormed into the entranceway and caught sight of Leni, to whom the cry of warning from the man at the door had been directed, running off down the hall between the rooms in her slip. He stared after her for a moment and then turned to look at the man who had opened the door. He was a scrawny little man with a full beard, holding a candle in his hand. “Do you work here?” K. asked. “No,” the man replied, “I’m not part of the household, the lawyer just represents me; I’m here on a legal matter.” “Without a jacket?” K. asked, and indicated with a wave of his hand the man’s inappropriate state of dress. “Oh, do forgive me,” said the man, and cast the light of the candle upon himself, as if he were seeing his own state for the first time. “Is Leni your mistress?” K. asked curtly. His legs were slightly spread, his hands, in which he held his hat, were clasped behind him. The mere possession of a heavy overcoat made him feel quite superior to the short skinny man. “Oh goodness,” said the other, and raised one hand before his face in shocked repudiation, “no, no, what are you thinking of?” “You look trustworthy,” said K. with a smile, “but yet—let’s go.” He gestured with his hat for him to lead the way. “What’s your name?” asked K. as they went along. “Block, Block the merchant,” the little man said, turning around to K. as he introduced himself, but K. didn’t allow him to stop. “Is that your real name?” asked K. “Of course,” was the answer, “why would you doubt it?” “I thought you might have some reason to conceal it,” said K. He felt totally at ease, the way one normally feels speaking with inferiors in a foreign country, avoiding everything personal, just talking indifferently about their interests, thereby elevating them in importance, but also in a position to drop them at will. K. stopped before the door of the lawyer’s study, opened it, and called out to the merchant, who had continued docilely onward: “Not so fast! Bring the light here.” K. thought Leni might have hidden herself there; he had the merchant check all the corners, but the room was empty. Before the painting of the judge, K. held the merchant back by his suspenders. “Do you know him?” he asked, and pointed upward. The merchant lifted the candle, squinted up, and said: “It’s a judge.” “A high judge?” asked K. and stepped to the side of the merchant to observe the impression the picture made on him. The merchant gazed up in admiration. “It’s a high judge,” he said. “You don’t know much,” said K. “He’s the lowest of the lower examining magistrates.” “Now I remember,” said the merchant and lowered the candle, “I’ve already heard that.” “But of course,” cried K., “yes I forgot, of course you would have already heard that.” “But why, why?” asked the merchant as he moved toward the door, impelled by K.’s hands. In the hall outside K. said: “You know where Leni’s hidden herself, don’t you?” “Hidden herself?” said the merchant, “no, but she may be in the kitchen cooking soup for the lawyer.” “Why didn’t you say so in the first place?” asked K. “I was taking you there, but you called me back,” replied the merchant, as if confused by the contradictory orders. “You probably think you’re pretty clever,” said K., “lead on then!” K. had never been in the kitchen; it was surprisingly spacious and well equipped. The stove alone was three times the size of a normal stove, but no other details were visible, for the kitchen was illuminated at the moment only by a small lamp hanging by the door. Leni was standing at the stove in her usual white apron, breaking eggs into a saucepan over an alcohol flame. “Good evening, Josef,” she said with a sidelong glance. “Good evening,” said K. and pointed to a chair off to the side that the merchant was to sit on, which he did. K., however, went up close behind Leni, bent over her shoulder and asked: “Who is this man?” Leni grasped K. with one hand while the other stirred the soup, pulled him forward, and said: “He’s a pitiful fellow, a poor merchant named Block. Just look at him.” They both looked back. The merchant was sitting in the chair K. had indicated; he had blown out the candle, its light now unnecessary, and was pinching the wick to stop the smoke. “You were in your slip,” said K., turning her head back to the stove with his hand. She was silent. “Is he your lover?” asked K. She started to lift the soup pan, but K. seized both her hands and said: “Answer me!” She said: “Come into the study, I’ll explain everything.” “No,” said K. “I want you to explain here.” She clung to him, wanting to give him a kiss, but K. fended her off and said: “I don’t want you kissing me now.” “Josef,” said Leni, staring at K. imploringly yet frankly, “you’re surely not jealous of Herr Block.” “Rudi,” she said then, turning to the merchant, “help me out, you can see I’m under suspicion, put that candle down.” One might have thought he hadn’t been paying attention, but he knew just what she meant. “I really don’t know what you have to be jealous about,” he said, not very quick-wittedly. “I really don’t know either,” said K., and regarded the merchant with a smile. Leni laughed aloud, took advantage of K.’s distraction to slip her arm in his, and whispered: “Let him alone now, you see what sort of a man he is. I took a little interest in him because he’s a major client of the lawyer, for no other reason. And you? Do you want to speak to the lawyer yet today? He’s very sick today, but if you wish, I’ll let him know you’re here. But you’ll stay overnight with me, that’s definite. You haven’t been here for such a long time that even the lawyer asked about you. Don’t neglect your trial! And I’ve learned a few things I want to tell you about. But first take off your coat!” She helped him off with it, removed his hat, ran into the hall with them to hang them up, then came back and checked on the soup. “Shall I first tell him you’re here, or bring him his soup first?” “First tell him I’m here,” said K. He was annoyed; he’d originally intended to discuss his situation with Leni, particularly the question of dismissal, but given the presence of the merchant he no longer wished to. But now he felt his case was after all too important for this small-time merchant to have any decisive influence on it, so he called Leni, who was already in the hall, back again. “Go ahead and take him his soup first,” he said, “he should gather his strength for our conference; he’s going to need it.” “You’re one of the lawyer’s clients too,” the merchant said softly from his corner, as if to confirm it. But it wasn’t well received. “What difference does it make to you?” said K., and Leni said: “Will you be quiet.” “I’ll take him the soup first then,” said Leni to K. and poured the soup into a bowl. “The only worry is he might fall asleep then; he usually drops off to sleep right after he eats.” “What I have to say will keep him awake,” said K.; he wanted to keep intimating that he had something of major importance to discuss with the lawyer; he wanted Leni to ask what it was and only then seek her advice. But she merely carried out his spoken instructions promptly. As she passed by with the bowl she deliberately nudged him softly and whispered: “As soon as he’s eaten his soup, I’ll tell him you’re here; that way I’ll get you back as quickly as possible.” “Go on,” said K., “just go on.” “Try being a little friendlier,” she said, turning around once again in the doorway, bowl in hand.","The first ring at the lawyer's door produced, as usual, no result. ""Leni could be a little quicker,"" thought K. But it was enough to be thankful for that no third party had come nosing in, as usually happened, the man in the dressing-gown, for instance, or some other interfering creature. K. glanced at the farther door as he pressed the button a second time, but on this occasion both doors remained firmly shut. At last a pair of eyes appeared at the peephole in the lawyer's door, but they were not Leni's eyes. Someone shot back the bolt, but still blocked the way as a preliminary measure, calling back into the house: ""It's him,"" and only then flinging the door open. K. had been pushing against the door, for he could already hear a key being hastily turned in the neighboring lock, and when it suddenly opened he was literally precipitated into the hail and caught a glimpse of Leni, for whom the warning cry must have been intended, rushing down the lobby in her shift. He peered after her for a moment and then turned to see who had opened the door. It was a dried-up little man with a long beard, he was holding a candle in one hand. ""Are you employed here?"" asked K. "" No,"" said the man, ""I don't belong to the house, I'm only the lawyer's client, i've come here on business."" ""In your shirt-sleeves?"" asked K., indicating the man's inadequate attire. "" Oh, excuse me,"" said the man, peering at himself by the light of the candle as if he had been unaware of his condition. ""Is Leni your mistress?"" inquired K. curtly. lie was straddling his legs slightly, his hands, in which he was holding his hat, clasped behind his back. The mere possession of a thick greatcoat gave him a feeling of superiority over the meager little fellow. "" Oh, God,"" said the other, raising one hand before his face in horrified repudiation, ""no, no, what are you thinking of?"" ""You look an honest man,"" said K., smiling, ""but all the same -- come along. "" He waved him on with his hat, urging him to go first. ""What's your name?"" K. asked as they were proceeding. ""Block, a tradesman,"" said the little man, turning round to introduce himself, but K. would not suffer him to remain standing. ""Is that your real name?"" went on K. "" Of course,"" came the answer, ""why should you doubt it?"" ""I thought you might have some reason for concealing your name,"" said K. He was feeling at ease now, at ease as one is when speaking to an inferior in some foreign country, keeping one's own affairs to oneself and discussing with equanimity the other man's interests, which gain consequence for the attention one bestows on them yet can be dismissed at will. As they came to the lawyer's study K. halted, opened the door, and called to the fellow, who was meekly advancing along the lobby: ""Not so fast, show a light here."" K. fancied that Leni might have hidden herself in the study; he made the tradesman shine the candle into all the corners, but the room was empty. In front of the Judge's portrait K. caught the fellow from behind by the braces and pulled him back. ""Do you know who that is?"" he asked, pointing upward at the picture. The man raised the candle, blinked up at the picture, and said : ""It's a Judge."" ""A high Judge? "" asked K., stationing himself beside the other to observe what impression the portrait made on him. The man gazed up with reverence. ""It is a high Judge,"" he said. ""You haven't much insight,"" said K., ""that's the lowest of the low among the examining Judges."" ""Now, I remember,"" said the man, letting the candle sink. ""I've been told that before."" ""But of course,"" cried K., ""how could I forget, of course you must have heard it before."" ""But why, why must I?"" asked the man, moving toward the door, for K. was propelling him from behind. When they were out in the lobby, K. said : ""I suppose you know where Leni's hiding?"" ""Hiding?"" said he. "" No, she should be in the kitchen making soup for the lawyer."" ""Why didn't you tell me that at first?"" asked K. ""I was going to take you there, but you called me back,"" answered the man, as if bewildered by these contradictory demands. ""You fancy you're being very sly,"" said K., ""lead the way then!"" K. bad never yet been in the kitchen, and it was surprisingly large and well furnished. The cooking-stove alone was three times the size of an ordinary stove; the rest of the fittings could not be seen in detail since the sole light came from a small lamp hanging near the door. Leni was standing by the stove in a white apron, as usual, emptying eggs into a pan that stood over an alcohol flame. "" Good evening, Joseph,"" she said, glancing over her shoulder. "" Good evening,"" said K., waving the tradesman to a chair some distance away, on which the man obediently sat down. Then K. went quite close up behind Leni, leaned over her shoulder, and asked: ""Who's this man F"" Leni put her disengaged arm round K., stirring the soup with the other, and pulled him forward. "" He's a miserable creature,"" she said, ""a poor tradesman called Block. Just look at him. "" They both glanced round. The tradesman was sitting in the chair K. had indicated for him; having blown out the candle, which was no longer needed, he was snuffing the wick with his fingers. ""You were in your shift,"" said K., turning Leni's head forcibly to the stove. She made no answer. ""Is he your lover?"" asked K. She reached for the soup pan, but K.. imprisoned both her hands and said: ""Give me an answer! "" She sail: ""Come into the study and I'll explain everything."" ""No,"" said K., ""I want you to tell me here. "" She slipped her arm into his and tried to give him a kiss, but K. fended her off, saying: ""I don't want you to kiss me now."" ""Joseph,"" said Leni, gazing at him imploringly and yet frankly, ""surely you're not jealous of Herr Block? "" Then she turned to the tradesman and said: ""Rudi, come to the rescue, you can see that I'm under suspicion, put that candle down. "" One might have thought that he had been paying no attention, but he knew at once what she meant. ""I can't think what you have to be jealous about either,"" he said, with no great acumen. ""Nor can I, really,"" replied K., regarding him with a smile. Leni laughed outright and profited by K.'s momentary distraction to hook herself on to his arm, whispering: ""Leave him alone now, you can see the kind of creature he is. I've shown him a little kindness because he's one of the lawyer's best clients, but that was the only reason. What about yourself? Do you want to see the lawyer tonight? He's far from well today; all the same, if you like I'll tell him you're here. But you're certainly going to spend the night with me. It's such a long time since you were here last, even the lawyer has been asking after you. It won't do to neglect your case! And I've got some information for you, too, things I've found out. But the first thing is to get your coat off. "" She helped him o4 of his coat, took his hat from him, ran into the hail to hang them up, and then ran back to keep an eye on the soup. "" Shall I announce you first or give him his soup first?"" ""Announce me first,"" said K. He felt irritated, for he had originally intended to discuss the whole case thoroughly with Leni, especially the question of dismissing the lawyer, and the tradesman's being there spoiled the situation. But again it struck him that his affairs were too important to allow of decisive interference by a petty tradesman, and so he called back Leni, who was already out in the lobby. "" No, let him have his soup first,"" he said, ""it'll strengthen him for his interview with me, and he'll need it."" ""So you're one of the lawyer's clients too,"" said the tradesman quietly from his corner, as if confirming a statement. His comment was but ill received. ""What's that got to do with you?"" said K., and Leni put in: ""You be quiet."" To K. Leni said: ""Well, then, I'll take him his soup first,"" and she poured the soup into a bowl. ""Only there's a risk that he might go to sleep immediately, he always falls asleep after food."" ""What I have to say to him will keep him awake all right,"" said K., who wanted to let it be known that his interview with the lawyer promised to be momentous; he wanted Leni to question him about it and only then would he ask her advice. But Leni merely followed out to the letter the orders he gave her. As she passed him with the bowl of soup she deliberately nudged him and whispered: ""I'll announce you the minute he's finished his soup, so that I can have you back as soon as possible."" ""Get along,"" said K., ""get along with you."" ""Don't be so cross,"" she said, turning right round in the doorway, soup bowl and all.","As usual, there was at first no response to K.'s ring at the door. “Leni could be a bit quicker,” thought K. But he could at least be glad there was nobody else interfering as usually happened, be it the man in his nightshirt or anyone else who might bother him. As K. pressed on the button for the second time he looked back at the other door, but this time it, too, remained closed. At last, two eyes appeared at the spy-hatch in the lawyer's door, although they weren't Leni's eyes. Someone unlocked the door, but kept himself pressed against it as he called back inside, “It's him!” , and only then did he open the door properly. K. pushed against the door, as behind him he could already hear the key being hurriedly turned in the lock of the door to the other flat. When the door in front of him finally opened, he stormed straight into the hallway. Through the corridor which led between the rooms he saw Leni, to whom the warning cry of the door opener had been directed, still running away in her nightshirt . He looked at her for a moment and then looked round at the person who had opened the door. It was a small, wizened man with a full beard, he held a candle in his hand. “Do you work here?” asked K. “No,” answered the man, “I don't belong here at all, the lawyer is only representing me, I'm here on legal business.” “Without your coat?” asked K., indicating the man's deficiency of dress with a gesture of his hand. “Oh, do forgive me!” said the man, and he looked at himself in the light of the candle he was holding as if he had not known about his appearance until then. “Is Leni your lover?” asked K. curtly. He had set his legs slightly apart, his hands, in which he held his hat, were behind his back. Merely by being in possession of a thick overcoat he felt his advantage over this thin little man. “Oh God,” he said and, shocked, raised one hand in front of his face as if in defence, “no, no, what can you be thinking?” “You look honest enough,” said K. with a smile, “but come along anyway.” K. indicated with his hat which way the man was to go and let him go ahead of him. “What is you name then?” asked K. on the way. “Block. I'm a businessman,” said the small man, twisting himself round as he thus introduced himself, although K. did not allow him to stop moving. “Is that your real name?” asked K. “Of course it is,” was the man's reply, “why do you doubt it?” “I thought you might have some reason to keep your name secret,” said K. He felt himself as much at liberty as is normally only felt in foreign parts when speaking with people of lower standing, keeping everything about himself to himself, speaking only casually about the interests of the other, able to raise him to a level above one's own, but also able, at will, to let him drop again. K. stopped at the door of the lawyer's office, opened it and, to the businessman who had obediently gone ahead, called, “Not so fast! Bring some light here!” K. thought Leni might have hidden in here, he let the businessman search in every corner, but the room was empty. In front of the picture of the judge K. took hold of the businessman's braces to stop him moving on. “Do you know him?” he asked, pointing upwards with his finger. The businessman lifted the candle, blinked as he looked up and said, “It's a judge.” “An important judge?” asked K., and stood to the side and in front of the businessman so that he could observe what impression the picture had on him. The businessman was looking up in admiration. “He's an important judge.” “You don't have much insight,” said K. “He is the lowest of the lowest examining judges.” “I remember now,” said the businessman as he lowered the candle, “that's what I've already been told.” “Well of course you have,” called out K., “I'd forgotten about it, of course you would already have been told.” “But why, why?” asked the businessman as he moved forwards towards the door, propelled by the hands of K. Outside in the corridor K. said, “You know where Leni's hidden, do you?” “Hidden?” said the businessman, “No, but she might be in the kitchen cooking soup for the lawyer.” “Why didn't you say that immediately?” asked K. “I was going to take you there, but you called me back again,” answered the businessman, as if confused by the contradictory commands. “You think you're very clever, don't you,” said K, “now take me there!” K. had never been in the kitchen, it was surprisingly big and very well equipped. The stove alone was three times bigger than normal stoves, but it was not possible to see any detail beyond this as the kitchen was at the time illuminated by no more than a small lamp hanging by the entrance. At the stove stood Leni, in a white apron as always, breaking eggs into a pot standing on a spirit lamp. “Good evening, Josef,” she said with a glance sideways. “Good evening,” said K., pointing with one hand to a chair in a corner which the businessman was to sit on, and he did indeed sit down on it. K. however went very close behind Leni's back, leant over her shoulder and asked, “Who is this man?” Leni put one hand around K. as she stirred the soup with the other, she drew him forward toward herself and said, “He's a pitiful character, a poor businessman by the name of Block. Just look at him.” The two of them looked back over their shoulders. The businessman was sitting on the chair that K. had directed him to, he had extinguished the candle whose light was no longer needed and pressed on the wick with his fingers to stop the smoke. “You were in your nightshirt,” said K., putting his hand on her head and turning it back towards the stove. She was silent. “Is he your lover?” asked K. She was about to take hold of the pot of soup, but K. took both her hands and said, “Answer me!” She said, “Come into the office, I'll explain everything to you.” “No,” said K., “I want you to explain it here.” She put her arms around him and wanted to kiss him. K., though, pushed her away and said, “I don't want you to kiss me now.” “Josef,” said Leni, looking at K. imploringly but frankly in the eyes, “you're not going to be jealous of Mr. Block now, are you? Rudi,” she then said, turning to the businessman, “help me out will you, I'm being suspected of something, you can see that, leave the candle alone.” It had looked as though Mr. Block had not been paying attention but he had been following closely. “I don't even know why you might be jealous,” he said ingenuously. “Nor do I, actually,” said K., looking at the businessman with a smile. Leni laughed out loud and while K. was not paying attention took the opportunity of embracing him and whispering, “Leave him alone, now, you can see what sort of person he is. I've been helping him a little bit because he's an important client of the lawyer's, and no other reason. And what about you? Do you want to speak to the lawyer at this time of day? He's very unwell today, but if you want I'll tell him you're here. But you can certainly spend the night with me. It's so long since you were last here, even the lawyer has been asking about you. Don't neglect your case! And I've got some things to tell you that I've learned about.

He was in a bad mood, he had originally intended a detailed discussion of his business with Leni, especially the question of his giving the lawyer notice, but now he no longer wanted to because of the presence of the businessman. Now he considered his affair too important to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps change some of his decisions, and so he called Leni back even though she was already on her way to the lawyer. “Bring him his soup first,” he said, “I want him to get his strength up for the discussion with me, he'll need it.” “You're a client of the lawyer's too, aren't you,” said the businessman quietly from his corner as if he were trying to find this out. It was not, however, taken well. “What business is that of yours?” said K., and Leni said, “Will you be quiet.—I'll take him his soup first then, shall I?” And she poured the soup into a dish. “The only worry then is that he might go to sleep soon after he's eaten.” “What I've got to say to him will keep him awake,” said K., who still wanted to intimate that he intended some important negotiations with the lawyer, he wanted Leni to ask him what it was and only then to ask her advice. But instead, she just promptly carried out the order he had given her. When she went over to him with the dish she deliberately brushed against him and whispered, “I'll tell him you're here as soon as he's eaten the soup so that I can get you back as soon as possible.” “Just go,” said K., “just go.” “Be a bit more friendly,” she said and, still holding the dish, turned completely round once more in the doorway.","As usual, there was at first no response to K.'s ring at the door.

"Der Gedanke an den Prozeß verließ ihn nicht mehr. Öfters schon hatte er überlegt, ob es nicht gut wäre, eine Verteidigungsschrift auszuarbeiten und bei Gericht einzureichen. Er wollte darin eine kurze Lebensbeschreibung vorlegen und bei jedem irgendwie wichtigeren Ereignis erklären, aus welchen Gründen er so gehandelt hatte, ob diese Handlungsweise nach seinem gegenwärtigen Urteil zu verwerfen oder zu billigen war und welche Gründe er für dieses oder jenes anführen konnte. Die Vorteile einer solchen Verteidigungsschrift gegenüber der bloßen Verteidigung durch den übrigens auch sonst nicht einwandfreien Advokaten waren zweifellos. K. wußte ja gar nicht, was der Advokat unternahm; viel war es jedenfalls nicht, schon einen Monat lang hatte er ihn nicht mehr zu sich berufen, und auch bei keiner der früheren Besprechungen hatte K. den Eindruck gehabt, daß dieser Mann viel für ihn erreichen könne. Vor allem hatte er ihn fast gar nicht ausgefragt. Und hier war doch so viel zu fragen. Fragen war die Hauptsache. K. hatte das Gefühl, als ob er selbst alle hier nötigen Fragen stellen könnte. Der Advokat dagegen, statt zu fragen, erzählte selbst oder saß ihm stumm gegenüber, beugte sich, wahrscheinlich wegen seines schwachen Gehörs, ein wenig über den Schreibtisch vor, zog an einem Bartstrahn innerhalb seines Bartes und blickte auf den Teppich nieder, vielleicht gerade auf die Stelle, wo K. mit Leni gelegen war. Hier und da gab er K. einige leere Ermahnungen, wie man sie Kindern gibt. Ebenso nutzlose wie langweilige Reden, die K. in der Schlußabrechnung mit keinem Heller zu bezahlen gedachte. Nachdem der Advokat ihn genügend gedemütigt zu haben glaubte, fing er gewöhnlich an, ihn wieder ein wenig aufzumuntern. Er habe schon, erzählte er dann, viele ähnliche Prozesse ganz oder teilweise gewonnen. Prozesse, die, wenn auch in Wirklichkeit vielleicht nicht so schwierig wie dieser, äußerlich noch hoffnungsloser waren. Ein Verzeichnis dieser Prozesse habe er hier in der Schublade – hierbei klopfte er an irgendeine Lade des Tisches –, die Schriften könne er leider nicht zeigen, da es sich um Amtsgeheimnisse handle. Trotzdem komme jetzt natürlich die große Erfahrung, die er durch alle diese Prozesse erworben habe, K. zugute. Er habe natürlich sofort zu arbeiten begonnen, und die erste Eingabe sei schon fast fertiggestellt. Sie sei sehr wichtig, weil der erste Eindruck, den die Verteidigung mache, oft die ganze Richtung des Verfahrens bestimme. Leider, darauf müsse er K. allerdings aufmerksam machen, geschehe es manchmal, daß die ersten Eingaben bei Gericht gar nicht gelesen würden. Man lege sie einfach zu den Akten und weise darauf hin, daß vorläufig die Einvernahme und Beobachtung des Angeklagten wichtiger sei als alles Geschriebene. Man fügt, wenn der Petent dringlich wird, hinzu, daß man vor der Entscheidung, sobald alles Material gesammelt ist, im Zusammenhang natürlich, alle Akten, also auch diese erste Eingabe, überprüfen wird. Leider sei aber auch dies meistens nicht richtig, die erste Eingabe werde gewöhnlich verlegt oder gehe gänzlich verloren, und selbst wenn sie bis zum Ende erhalten bleibt, werde sie, wie der Advokat allerdings nur gerüchtweise erfahren hat, kaum gelesen. Das alles sei bedauerlich, aber nicht ganz ohne Berechtigung. K. möge doch nicht außer acht lassen, daß das Verfahren nicht öffentlich sei, es kann, wenn das Gericht es für nötig hält, öffentlich werden, das Gesetz aber schreibt Öffentlichkeit nicht vor. Infolge dessen sind auch die Schriften des Gerichts, vor allem die Anklageschrift, dem Angeklagten und seiner Verteidigung unzugänglich, man weiß daher im allgemeinen nicht oder wenigstens nicht genau, wogegen sich die erste Eingabe zu richten hat, sie kann daher eigentlich nur zufälligerweise etwas enthalten, was für die Sache von Bedeutung ist. Wirklich zutreffende und beweisführende Eingaben kann man erst später ausarbeiten, wenn im Laufe der Einvernahmen des Angeklagten die einzelnen Anklagepunkte und ihre Begründung deutlicher hervor treten oder erraten werden können. Unter diesen Verhältnissen ist natürlich die Verteidigung in einer sehr ungünstigen und schwierigen Lage. Aber auch das ist beabsichtigt. Die Verteidigung ist nämlich durch das Gesetz nicht eigentlich gestattet, sondern nur geduldet, und selbst darüber, ob aus der betreffenden Gesetzesstelle wenigstens Duldung herausgelesen werden soll, besteht Streit. Es gibt daher strenggenommen gar keine vom Gericht anerkannten Advokaten, alle, die vor diesem Gericht als Advokaten auftreten, sind im Grunde nur Winkeladvokaten. Das wirkt natürlich auf den ganzen Stand sehr entwürdigend ein, und wenn K. nächstens einmal in die Gerichtskanzleien gehen werde, könne er sich ja, um auch das einmal gesehen zu haben, das Advokatenzimmer ansehen. Er werde vor der Gesellschaft, die dort beisammen sei, vermutlich erschrecken. Schon die ihnen zugewiesene enge, niedrige Kammer zeige die Verachtung, die das Gericht für diese Leute hat. Licht bekommt die Kammer nur durch eine kleine Luke, die so hochgelegen ist, daß man, wenn man hinausschauen will, wo einem übrigens der Rauch eines knapp davor gelegenen Kamins in die Nase fährt und das Gesicht schwärzt, erst einen Kollegen suchen muß, der einen auf den Rücken nimmt. Im Fußboden dieser Kammer – um nur noch ein Beispiel für diese Zustände anzuführen – ist nun schon seit mehr als einem Jahr ein Loch, nicht so groß, daß ein Mensch durchfallen könnte, aber groß genug, daß man mit einem Bein ganz einsinkt. Das Advokatenzimmer liegt auf dem zweiten Dachboden; sinkt also einer ein, so hängt das Bein in den ersten Dachboden hinunter, und zwar gerade in den Gang, wo die Parteien warten. Es ist nicht zuviel gesagt, wenn man in Advokatenkreisen solche Verhältnisse schändlich nennt. Beschwerden an die Verwaltung haben nicht den geringsten Erfolg, wohl aber ist es den Advokaten auf das strengste verboten, irgend etwas in dem Zimmer auf eigene Kosten ändern zu lassen. Aber auch diese Behandlung der Advokaten hat ihre Begründung. Man will die Verteidigung möglichst ausschalten, alles soll auf den Angeklagten selbst gestellt sein. Kein schlechter Standpunkt im Grunde, nichts wäre aber verfehlter, als daraus zu folgern, daß bei diesem Gericht die Advokaten für den Angeklagten unnötig sind. Im Gegenteil, bei keinem anderen Gericht sind sie so notwendig wie bei diesem. Das Verfahren ist nämlich im allgemeinen nicht nur vor der Öffentlichkeit geheim, sondern auch vor dem Angeklagten. Natürlich nur soweit dies möglich ist, es ist aber in sehr weitem Ausmaß möglich. Auch der Angeklagte hat nämlich keinen Einblick in die Gerichtsschriften, und aus den Verhören auf die ihnen zugrunde liegenden Schriften zu schließen, ist sehr schwierig, insbesondere aber für den Angeklagten, der doch befangen ist und alle möglichen Sorgen hat, die ihn zerstreuen. Hier greift nun die Verteidigung ein. Bei den Verhören dürfen im allgemeinen Verteidiger nicht anwesend sein, sie müssen daher nach den Verhören, und zwar möglichst noch an der Tür des Untersuchungszimmers, den Angeklagten über das Verhör ausforschen und diesen oft schon sehr verwischten Berichten das für die Verteidigung Taugliche entnehmen. Aber das Wichtigste ist dies nicht, denn viel kann man auf diese Weise nicht erfahren, wenn natürlich auch hier wie überall ein tüchtiger Mann mehr erfährt als andere. Das Wichtigste bleiben trotzdem die persönlichen Beziehungen des Advokaten, in ihnen liegt der Hauptwert der Verteidigung. Nun habe ja wohl K. schon seinen eigenen Erlebnissen entnommen, daß die allerunterste Organisation des Gerichtes nicht ganz vollkommen ist, pflichtvergessene und bestechliche Angestellte aufweist, wodurch gewissermaßen die strenge Abschließung des Gerichtes Lücken bekommt. Hier nun drängt sich die Mehrzahl der Advokaten ein, hier wird bestochen und ausgehorcht, ja es kamen, wenigstens in früherer Zeit, sogar Fälle von Aktendiebstählen vor. Es ist nicht zu leugnen, daß auf diese Weise für den Augenblick einige sogar überraschend günstige Resultate für den Angeklagten sich erzielen lassen, damit stolzieren auch diese kleinen Advokaten herum und locken neue Kundschaft an, aber für den weiteren Fortgang des Prozesses bedeutet es entweder nichts oder nichts Gutes. Wirklichen Wert aber haben nur ehrliche persönliche Beziehungen, und zwar mit höheren Beamten, womit natürlich nur höhere Beamten der unteren Grade gemeint sind. Nur dadurch kann der Fortgang des Prozesses, wenn auch zunächst nur unmerklich, später aber immer deutlicher beeinflußt werden. Das können natürlich nur wenige Advokaten, und hier sei die Wahl K.s sehr günstig gewesen. Nur noch vielleicht ein oder zwei Advokaten könnten sich mit ähnlichen Beziehungen ausweisen wie Dr. Huld. Diese kümmern sich allerdings um die Gesellschaft im Advokatenzimmer nicht und haben auch nichts mit ihr zu tun. Um so enger sei aber die Verbindung mit den Gerichtsbeamten. Es sei nicht einmal immer nötig, daß Dr. Huld zu Gericht gehe, in den Vorzimmern der Untersuchungsrichter auf ihr zufälliges Erscheinen warte und je nach ihrer Laune einen meist nur scheinbaren Erfolg erziele oder auch nicht einmal diesen. Nein, K. habe es ja selbst gesehen, die Beamten, und darunter recht hohe, kommen selbst, geben bereitwillig Auskunft, offene oder wenigstens leicht deutbare, besprechen den nächsten Fortgang der Prozesse, ja sie lassen sich sogar in einzelnen Fällen überzeugen und nehmen die fremde Ansicht gern an. Allerdings dürfe man ihnen gerade in dieser letzteren Hinsicht nicht allzusehr vertrauen, so bestimmt sie ihre neue, für die Verteidigung günstige Absicht auch aussprechen, gehen sie doch vielleicht geradewegs in ihre Kanzlei und geben für den nächsten Tag einen Gerichtsbeschluß, der gerade das Entgegengesetzte enthält und vielleicht für den Angeklagten noch viel strenger ist als ihre erste Absicht, von der sie gänzlich abgekommen zu sein behaupteten. Dagegen könne man sich natürlich nicht wehren, denn das, was sie zwischen vier Augen gesagt haben, ist eben auch nur zwischen vier Augen gesagt und lasse keine öffentliche Folgerung zu, selbst wenn die Verteidigung nicht auch sonst bestrebt sein müßte, sich die Gunst der Herren zu erhalten. Andererseits sei es allerdings auch richtig, daß die Herren nicht etwa nur aus Menschenliebe oder aus freundschaftlichen Gefühlen sich mit der Verteidigung, natürlich nur mit einer sachverständigen Verteidigung, in Verbindung setzen, sie sind vielmehr in gewisser Hinsicht auch auf sie angewiesen. Hier mache sich eben der Nachteil einer Gerichtsorganisation geltend, die selbst in ihren Anfängen das geheime Gericht festsetzt. Den Beamten fehlt der Zusammenhang mit der Bevölkerung, für die gewöhnlichen, mittleren Prozesse sind sie gut ausgerüstet, ein solcher Prozeß rollt fast von selbst auf seiner Bahn ab und braucht nur hier und da einen Anstoß, gegenüber den ganz einfachen Fällen aber, wie auch gegenüber den besonders schwierigen sind sie oft ratlos, sie haben, weil sie fortwährend, Tag und Nacht, in ihr Gesetz eingezwängt sind, nicht den richtigen Sinn für menschliche Beziehungen, und das entbehren sie in solchen Fällen schwer. Dann kommen sie zum Advokaten um Rat, und hinter ihnen trägt ein Diener die Akten, die sonst so geheim sind. An diesem Fenster hätte man manche Herren, von denen man es am wenigsten erwarten würde, antreffen können, wie sie geradezu trostlos auf die Gasse hinaussahen, während der Advokat an seinem Tisch die Akten studierte, um ihnen einen guten Rat geben zu können. Übrigens könne man gerade bei solchen Gelegenheiten sehen, wie ungemein ernst die Herren ihren Beruf nehmen und wie sie über Hindernisse, die sie ihrer Natur nach nicht bewältigen können, in große Verzweiflung geraten. Ihre Stellung sei auch sonst nicht leicht, man dürfe ihnen nicht Unrecht tun und ihre Stellung nicht für leicht ansehen. Die Rangordnung und Steigerung des Gerichtes sei unendlich und selbst für den Eingeweihten nicht absehbar. Das Verfahren vor den Gerichtshöfen sei aber im allgemeinen auch für die unteren Beamten geheim, sie können daher die Angelegenheiten, die sie bearbeiten, in ihrem ferneren Weitergang kaum jemals vollständig verfolgen, die Gerichtssache erscheint also in ihrem Gesichtskreis, ohne daß sie oft wissen, woher sie kommt, und sie geht weiter, ohne daß sie erfahren, wohin. Die Belehrung also, die man aus dem Studium der einzelnen Prozeßstadien, der schließlichen Entscheidung und ihrer Gründe schöpfen kann, entgeht diesen Beamten. Sie dürfen sich nur mit jenem Teil des Prozesses befassen, der vom Gesetz für sie abgegrenzt ist, und wissen von dem Weiteren, also von den Ergebnissen ihrer eigenen Arbeit, meist weniger als die Verteidigung, die doch in der Regel fast bis zum Schluß des Prozesses mit dem Angeklagten in Verbindung bleibt. Auch in diese Richtung also können sie von der Verteidigung manches Wertvolle erfahren. Wundere sich K. noch, wenn er alles dieses im Auge behalte, über die Gereiztheit der Beamten, die sich manchmal den Parteien gegenüber in – jeder mache diese Erfahrung – beleidigender Weise äußert. Alle Beamten seien gereizt, selbst wenn sie ruhig scheinen. Natürlich haben die kleinen Advokaten besonders viel darunter zu leiden. Man erzählt zum Beispiel folgende Geschichte, die sehr den Anschein der Wahrheit hat. Ein alter Beamter, ein guter, stiller Herr, hatte eine schwierige Gerichtssache, welche besonders durch die Eingaben des Advokaten verwickelt worden war, einen Tag und eine Nacht ununterbrochen studiert – diese Beamten sind tatsächlich fleißig, wie niemand sonst. – Gegen Morgen nun, nach vierundzwanzigstündiger, wahrscheinlich nicht sehr ergiebiger Arbeit, ging er zur Eingangstür, stellte sich dort in Hinterhalt und warf jeden Advokaten, der eintreten wollte, die Treppe hinunter. Die Advokaten sammelten sich unten auf dem Treppenansatz und berieten, was sie tun sollten; einerseits haben sie keinen eigentlichen Anspruch darauf, eingelassen zu werden, können daher rechtlich gegen den Beamten kaum etwas unternehmen und müssen sich, wie schon erwähnt, auch hüten, die Beamtenschaft gegen sich aufzubringen. Andererseits aber ist jeder nicht bei Gericht verbrachte Tag für sie verloren, und es lag ihnen also viel daran einzudringen. Schließlich einigten sie sich darauf, daß sie den alten Herrn ermüden wollten. Immer wieder wurde ein Advokat ausgeschickt, der die Treppe hinauflief und sich dann unter möglichstem, allerdings passivem Widerstand hinunterwerfen ließ, wo er dann von den Kollegen aufgefangen wurde. Das dauerte etwa eine Stunde, dann wurde der alte Herr, er war ja auch von der Nachtarbeit schon erschöpft, wirklich müde und ging in seine Kanzlei zurück. Die unten wollten es erst gar nicht glauben und schickten zuerst einen aus, der hinter der Tür nachsehen sollte, ob dort wirklich leer war. Dann erst zogen sie ein und wagten wahrscheinlich nicht einmal zu murren. Denn den Advokaten – und selbst der Kleinste kann doch die Verhältnisse wenigstens zum Teil übersehen – liegt es vollständig ferne, bei Gericht irgendwelche Verbesserungen einführen oder durchsetzen zu wollen, während – und dies ist sehr bezeichnend – fast jeder Angeklagte, selbst ganz einfältige Leute, gleich beim allerersten Eintritt in den Prozeß an Verbesserungsvorschläge zu denken anfangen und damit oft Zeit und Kraft verschwenden, die anders viel besser verwendet werden könnten. Das einzig Richtige sei es, sich mit den vorhandenen Verhältnissen abzufinden. Selbst wenn es möglich wäre, Einzelheiten zu verbessern – es ist aber ein unsinniger Aberglaube –, hätte man bestenfalls für künftige Fälle etwas erreicht, sich selbst aber unermeßlich dadurch geschadet, daß man die besondere Aufmerksamkeit der immer rachsüchtigen Beamtenschaft erregt hat. Nur keine Aufmerksamkeit erregen! Sich ruhig verhalten, selbst wenn es einem noch so sehr gegen den Sinn geht! Einzusehen versuchen, daß dieser große Gerichtsorganismus gewissermaßen ewig in der Schwebe bleibt und daß man zwar, wenn man auf seinem Platz selbständig etwas ändert, den Boden unter den Füßen sich wegnimmt und selbst abstürzen kann, während der große Organismus sich selbst für die kleine Störung leicht an einer anderen Stelle – alles ist doch in Verbindung – Ersatz schafft und unverändert bleibt, wenn er nicht etwa, was sogar wahrscheinlich ist, noch geschlossener, noch aufmerksamer, noch strenger, noch böser wird. Man überlasse doch die Arbeit dem Advokaten, statt sie zu stören. Vorwürfe nützen ja nicht viel, besonders wenn man ihre Ursachen in ihrer ganzen Bedeutung nicht begreiflich machen kann, aber gesagt müsse es doch werden, wieviel K. seiner Sache durch das Verhalten gegenüber dem Kanzleidirektor geschadet habe. Dieser einflußreiche Mann sei aus der Liste jener, bei denen man für K. etwas unternehmen könne, schon fast zu streichen. Selbst flüchtige Erwähnungen des Prozesses überhöre er mit deutlicher Absicht. In manchem seien ja die Beamten wie Kinder. Oft können sie durch Harmlosigkeiten, unter die allerdings K.s Verhalten leider nicht gehörte, derartig verletzt werden, daß sie selbst mit guten Freunden zu reden aufhören, sich von ihnen abwenden, wenn sie ihnen begegnen, und ihnen in allem möglichen entgegenarbeiten. Dann aber einmal, überraschenderweise ohne besonderen Grund, lassen sie sich durch einen kleinen Scherz, den man nur deshalb wagt, weil alles aussichtslos scheint, zum Lachen bringen und sind versöhnt. Es sei eben gleichzeitig schwer und leicht, sich mit ihnen zu verhalten, Grundsätze dafür gibt es kaum. Manchmal sei es zum Verwundern, daß ein einziges Durchschnittsleben dafür hinreiche, um so viel zu erfassen, daß man hier mit einigem Erfolg arbeiten könne. Es kommen allerdings trübe Stunden, wie sie ja jeder hat, wo man glaubt, nicht das geringste erzielt zu haben, wo es einem scheint, als hätten nur die von Anfang an für einen guten Ausgang bestimmten Prozesse ein gutes Ende genommen, wie es auch ohne Mithilfe geschehen wäre, während alle anderen verlorengegangen sind, trotz allem Nebenherlaufen, aller Mühe, allen kleinen, scheinbaren Erfolgen, über die man solche Freude hatte. Dann scheint einem allerdings nichts mehr sicher, und man würde auf bestimmte Fragen hin nicht einmal zu leugnen wagen, daß man ihrem Wesen nach gut verlaufende Prozesse gerade durch die Mithilfe auf Abwege gebracht hat. Auch das ist ja eine Art Selbstvertrauen, aber es ist das einzige, daß dann übrigbleibt. Solchen Anfällen – es sind natürlich nur Anfälle, nichts weiter – sind Advokaten besonders dann ausgesetzt, wenn ihnen ein Prozeß, den sie weit genug und zufriedenstellend geführt haben, plötzlich aus der Hand genommen wird. Das ist wohl das Ärgste, das einem Advokaten geschehen kann. Nicht etwa durch den Angeklagten wird ihnen der Prozeß entzogen, das geschieht wohl niemals, ein Angeklagter, der einmal einen bestimmten Advokaten genommen hat, muß bei ihm bleiben, geschehe was immer. Wie könnte er sich überhaupt, wenn er einmal Hilfe in Anspruch genommen hat, allein noch erhalten? Das geschieht also nicht, wohl aber geschieht es manchmal, daß der Prozeß eine Richtung nimmt, wo der Advokat nicht mehr mitkommen darf. Der Prozeß und der Angeklagte und alles wird dem Advokaten einfach entzogen; dann können auch die besten Beziehungen zu den Beamten nicht mehr helfen, denn sie selbst wissen nichts. Der Prozeß ist eben in ein Stadium getreten, wo keine Hilfe mehr geleistet werden darf, wo ihn unzugängliche Gerichtshöfe bearbeiten, wo auch der Angeklagte für den Advokaten nicht mehr erreichbar ist. Man kommt dann eines Tages nach Hause und findet auf seinem Tisch alle die vielen Eingaben, die man mit allem Fleiß und mit den schönsten Hoffnungen in dieser Sache gemacht hat, sie sind zurückgestellt worden, da sie in das neue Prozeßstadium nicht übertragen werden dürfen, es sind wertlose Fetzen. Dabei muß der Prozeß noch nicht verloren sein, durchaus nicht, wenigstens liegt kein entscheidender Grund für diese Annahme vor, man weiß bloß nichts mehr von dem Prozeß und wird auch nichts mehr von ihm erfahren. Nun sind ja solche Fälle glücklicherweise Ausnahmen, und selbst wenn K.s Prozeß ein solcher Fall sein sollte, sei er doch vorläufig noch weit von solchem Stadium entfernt. Hier sei aber noch reichliche Gelegenheit für Advokatenarbeit gegeben, und daß sie ausgenützt werde, dessen dürfe K. sicher sein. Die Eingabe sei, wie erwähnt, noch nicht überreicht, das eile aber auch nicht, viel wichtiger seien die einleitenden Besprechungen mit maßgebenden Beamten, und die hätten schon stattgefunden. Mit verschiedenem Erfolg, wie offen zugestanden werden soll. Es sei viel besser, vorläufig Einzelheiten nicht zu verraten, durch die K. nur Ungünstig beeinflußt und allzu hoffnungsfreudig oder allzu ängstlich gemacht werden könnte, nur so viel sei gesagt, daß sich einzelne sehr günstig ausgesprochen und sich auch sehr bereitwillig gezeigt haben, während andere sich weniger günstig geäußert, aber doch ihre Mithilfe keineswegs verweigert haben. Das Ergebnis sei also im ganzen sehr erfreulich, nur dürfe man daraus keine besonderen Schlüsse ziehen, da alle Vorverhandlungen ähnlich beginnen und durchaus erst die weitere Entwicklung den Wert dieser Vorverhandlungen zeigt. Jedenfalls sei noch nichts verloren, und wenn es noch gelingen sollte, den Kanzleidirektor trotz allem zu gewinnen – es sei schon verschiedenes zu diesem Zwecke eingeleitet –, dann sei das Ganze – wie die Chirurgen sagen – eine reine Wunde, und man könne getrost das Folgende erwarten.","The thought of the trial never left him. He had often considered whether it would not be a good idea to prepare a written defense and submit it to the court. In it he intended to present a brief biography and, for each event of any more importance, explain why he had acted in this way, whether, in his present judgment, this course of action was to be rejected or approved, and what reasons he could adduce for this or that. The advantages of such a written defense compared to the mere defense by the otherwise impeccable lawyer were undeniable. K. didn't even know what the lawyer was doing; In any case, it wasn't much, he hadn't summoned him for a month, and in none of the earlier meetings had K. had the impression that this man could achieve much for him. Most importantly, he had hardly questioned him at all. And there was so much to ask here. Questions were the main thing. K. had the feeling that he could ask all the necessary questions himself. The lawyer, on the other hand, instead of asking questions, told the story himself or sat silently opposite him, leaned forward a little over the desk, probably because of his poor hearing, pulled at a strand of beard inside his beard and looked down at the carpet, maybe just at her Spot where K. was lying with Leni. Here and there he gave K. a few empty admonitions, the kind one gives to children. Speeches that were just as useless as they were boring, for which K. didn't intend to pay a penny in the final accounts. After the lawyer thought he had humiliated him enough, he usually began to cheer him up a little. He then said that he had already won many similar lawsuits in whole or in part. Processes which, while in reality perhaps not as difficult as this one, were outwardly even more hopeless. He has a list of these trials here in the drawer - he knocked on one of the drawers on the table - but unfortunately he couldn't show the documents because they were official secrets. Nevertheless, the great experience that he has gained through all these lawsuits is of course of benefit to K.. Of course he started to work immediately and the first submission was almost complete. It is very important because the first impression the defense makes often determines the whole course of the proceedings. Unfortunately, though he had to point this out to K., it sometimes happened that the first submissions to the court were not read at all. Just put them in the files and point out that for the time being the questioning and observation of the accused is more important than anything that has been written. If the petitioner becomes urgent, it is added that before the decision is made, as soon as all the material has been collected, all the files, including this first submission, will of course be checked in context. Unfortunately, even this is usually not correct, the first submission is usually mislaid or completely lost, and even if it is preserved to the end, it is hardly read, as the lawyer only learned from rumours. All of this is unfortunate, but not entirely without justification. K. shouldn't forget that the proceedings are not public, they can be made public if the court deems it necessary, but the law doesn't prescribe publicity. As a result, the documents of the court, especially the indictment, are inaccessible to the accused and his defense, so one does not generally know, or at least not exactly, against what the first petition is to be directed, it can therefore actually only coincidentally contain something what is relevant to the matter. Really correct and conclusive submissions can only be worked out later, when in the course of the interrogation of the accused the individual charges and their justification emerge more clearly or can be guessed at. Under these circumstances the defense is of course in a very unfavorable and difficult position. But that is also intentional. The defense is not actually permitted by the law, but only tolerated, and there is even a dispute as to whether the relevant passage of the law should at least be read as toleration. Strictly speaking, therefore, there are no lawyers recognized by the court; everyone who appears as a lawyer before this court is basically just a crook. Of course that has a very degrading effect on the whole class, and when K. goes to the court offices in the near future, he can have a look at the lawyers' room to see that as well. He will probably be frightened by the company that is gathered there. Even the narrow, low chamber assigned to them shows the contempt that the court has for these people. The chamber only gets light through a small hatch, which is so high up that if you want to look out, where the smoke from a chimney just in front of you gets up your nose and blackens your face, you first have to find a colleague who can takes on his back. In the floor of this chamber, to cite just one more example of these conditions, there has been a hole for more than a year now, not big enough for a man to fall through, but big enough for a leg to sink all the way through. The lawyer's room is on the second attic; so if someone sinks in, the leg hangs down into the first attic, right into the passage where the parties are waiting. It is not saying too much to call such circumstances disgraceful in legal circles. Complaints to the administration have not the slightest success, but the lawyers are strictly forbidden to have anything in the room changed at their own expense. But this treatment of lawyers also has its justification. You want to eliminate the defense as much as possible, everything should be based on the accused himself. Basically not a bad point of view, but nothing would be more wrong than to conclude from this that in this court the lawyers are unnecessary for the accused. On the contrary, in no other court are they as necessary as in this one. The process is generally secret not only from the public but also from the accused. Of course only as far as this is possible, but it is possible to a very large extent. The accused also has no insight into the court documents, and it is very difficult to draw conclusions about the documents on which they are based from the interrogations, but especially for the accused, who is biased and has all sorts of worries that distract him. This is where the defense comes in. Defense attorneys are generally not allowed to be present during the interrogations, so after the interrogations, if possible at the door of the examination room, they have to inquire about the accused about the interrogation and gather from these often very blurred reports what is useful for the defense. But that's not the most important thing, because you can't find out much in this way, although here, as everywhere, a competent man learns more than others. Nevertheless, the most important thing remains the lawyer's personal relationships, in which lies the main value of the defense. Well, K. must have learned from his own experiences that the very lowest level of organization in the court is not quite perfect, and has employees who have neglected their duties and who take bribes, which means that the strict isolation of the court has gaps, so to speak. This is where the majority of lawyers intrude, here they are bribed and bugged, yes, at least in the past there were even cases of theft of files. It cannot be denied that in this way some even surprisingly favorable results for the accused can be achieved for the moment, even these little lawyers strut around with it and attract new customers, but for the further progress of the trial it means either nothing or nothing good. But only honest personal relationships have real value, and that with higher officials, which of course only means higher officials of the lower ranks. Only in this way can the progress of the process be influenced, even if only imperceptibly at first, but later more and more clearly. Of course only a few lawyers can do that, and here K.'s choice was very good. Only perhaps one or two more lawyers could identify themselves as having similar connections to Dr. grace. However, these do not care about the company in the lawyer's room and have nothing to do with it. But the connection with the court officials is all the closer. It is not even always necessary that Dr. Huld go to court, wait in the anterooms of the examining magistrates for their chance appearance and, depending on their mood, achieve what is mostly only apparent success or not even this. No, K. saw it himself, the officials, some of whom were quite high-ranking ones, come themselves, are willing to give information that is open or at least easily interpretable, discuss the next steps of the trials, they even allow themselves to be persuaded in individual cases and take them stranger's point of view. It is true that one should not trust them too much in this latter respect, no matter how firmly they express their new intention, favorable to the defense, they may go straight to their chancellery and issue a court order for the next day which contains exactly the opposite and is perhaps even more severe for the accused than their first intention, from which they claim to have abandoned altogether. Of course one could not defend oneself against that, because what they said in private was only said in private and did not permit any public conclusions, even if the defense did not have to try to gain the favor of the gentlemen in other ways to obtain. On the other hand, it is also true that the gentlemen do not only contact the defense out of philanthropy or out of friendly feelings, of course only with an expert defense, they are also dependent on them in a certain respect. This is where the disadvantage of a judicial organization comes into play, which establishes the secret court even in its early stages. The officials have no connection with the population, they are well equipped for the usual, medium-sized trials, such a trial rolls along its course almost by itself and only needs a nudge here and there, but in relation to the very simple cases as well as in relation to it the particularly difficult ones they are often at a loss, because they are constantly constrained by their law, day and night, they do not have the right sense of human relationships, and in such cases they hardly lack that. Then they come to the lawyer for advice, and behind them a servant carries the files, which are otherwise so secret. At that window one might have found some gentlemen, of whom one would least expect it, gazing down the street in a most desolate manner, while the lawyer at his table studied the files in order to be able to give them good advice. Incidentally, it is precisely on such occasions that one can see how extremely seriously the gentlemen take their profession and how they get into great despair over obstacles that they cannot overcome by their nature. Their position was not easy in other respects either, one should not do them an injustice and not regard their position as easy. The hierarchy and progression of the court is infinite and not foreseeable even for the initiated. However, the proceedings before the courts of law are generally also secret for the lower officials, so they can hardly ever fully follow the further progress of the matters they are dealing with, so the court case appears in their field of vision without them often knowing where it came from it comes and it goes on without their knowing where. So the lesson that can be gleaned from studying the stages of the trial, the final decision, and its reasons eludes these officials. They are only allowed to deal with that part of the trial which the law delimits for them and usually know less about what follows, i.e. about the results of their own work, than the defense, which as a rule is almost to the end of the trial keep in touch with the accused. In this direction, too, they can learn a great deal of value from the defence. Keeping all this in mind, K. is still surprised at the irritability of the officials, which sometimes expresses itself to the parties in an insulting way – everyone experiences this. All officials are irritable, even if they seem calm. Of course, the little lawyers have to suffer particularly badly. For example, the following story is told, which has very much the appearance of truth. An old clerk, a good, quiet gentleman, had spent a day and night studying a difficult court matter, which had been particularly complicated by the pleadings of the advocate - these clerks are indeed industrious like no one else. - Toward morning well, after After twenty-four hours of work, which was probably not very fruitful, he went to the front door, stood in ambush there, and threw down the stairs any lawyer who tried to enter. The advocates gathered at the bottom of the stairs and deliberated what to do; on the one hand, they have no real right to be admitted, so they can hardly do anything legally against the civil servants and, as already mentioned, they have to be careful not to alienate the civil servants. On the other hand, every day not spent in court is wasted for them, so they were very anxious to invade. Finally they agreed that they wanted to tire the old gentleman. Again and again a lawyer was sent out to run up the stairs and then allowed himself to be thrown down the stairs with as much resistance as possible, albeit passively, where he was then caught by his colleagues. That lasted about an hour, then the old gentleman, he was already exhausted from the night work, got really tired and went back to his office. Those downstairs didn't want to believe it at first and first sent someone to look behind the door to make sure it was really empty. Only then did they move in and probably didn't even dare to grumble. For the lawyers - and even the smallest can at least partly overlook the circumstances - are completely far removed from wanting to introduce or enforce any improvements in court, while - and this is very significant - almost every accused, even very simple people, is the same begin to think of suggestions for improvement the very first time you enter the process, often wasting time and energy that could be better used elsewhere. The only right thing to do is to come to terms with the existing conditions. Even if it were possible to improve details - but it is a nonsensical superstition - one would at best have gained something for future cases, but harmed oneself immeasurably by attracting the special attention of the always vengeful civil service. Just don't draw attention! Remain calm, no matter how much it goes against your senses! Trying to understand that this great judicial organism remains in limbo forever, and that if you change something independently in your place, you can take the ground from under your feet and fall yourself, while the large organism easily takes care of itself for the small disturbance in another place - after all, everything is connected - creates a substitute and remains unchanged, if it does not become even more closed, even more attentive, even stricter, even more evil, which is even probable. Let the lawyer do the work instead of disturbing her. Reproaches aren't of much use, especially if you can't make their causes understandable in their entirety, but it should be said how much damage K. had done to his cause through his behavior towards the director of the chancellery. This influential man was almost to be deleted from the list of those with whom one could do something for K.. He deliberately ignores even cursory mentions of the process. In some ways the officials are like children. They can often be so hurt by harmlessness, which unfortunately does not include K.'s behavior, that they stop talking even to good friends, turn away from them when they meet them, and do everything possible to counteract them. But then once, surprisingly for no particular reason, they let themselves be made laugh by a little joke, which one only dares because everything seems hopeless, and they are reconciled. It is difficult and easy at the same time to behave with them, there are hardly any principles for this. Sometimes it is surprising that a single average life is enough to grasp so much that one can work here with some success. However, there are gloomy hours, like everyone has, when you think you haven't achieved anything, when it seems as if only the processes that were intended to have a good ending from the beginning have ended well, as it does without Help would have happened while everyone else was lost, despite all the sidetracking, all the effort, all the small, apparent successes that one was so happy about. Then, of course, nothing seems certain anymore, and in response to certain questions one would not even dare to deny that processes which by their very nature are going well have been misguided precisely through the assistance. That too is a kind of self-confidence, but it's the only thing that remains. Attorneys are particularly prone to such seizures - they are, of course, only seizures, nothing more - when a case which they have carried far enough and satisfactorily is suddenly taken out of their hands. That's probably the worst thing that can happen to a lawyer. It's not because of the defendant that the trial is taken away from them, that probably never happens, a defendant who has hired a certain lawyer has to stay with him, whatever happens. How could he even survive on his own once he has asked for help? So that doesn't happen, but it does sometimes happen that the trial takes a direction where the lawyer is no longer allowed to follow. The trial and the accused and everything is simply taken away from the lawyer; then even the best relationships with the officials can no longer help, because they themselves know nothing. The trial has just entered a stage where no more help can be given, where inaccessible courts of justice are dealing with it, where even the accused can no longer be reached by the lawyer. Then one day you come home and you find on your desk all the many submissions that you have made with all diligence and with the best hopes in this matter, they have been shelved because they may not be transferred to the new stage of the trial, it are worthless scraps. The trial does not have to be lost yet, not at all, at least there is no decisive reason for this assumption, one simply knows nothing more about the trial and will also learn nothing more about it. Luckily, such cases are exceptions, and even if K.'s trial were such a case, it was still a long way from that stage. But there was still plenty of opportunity for legal work here, and K. could be sure that it would be used. As mentioned, the petition has not yet been handed in, but there is no hurry, the introductory meetings with the relevant officials are much more important and they have already taken place. With varying success, as is openly to be conceded. It is much better not to reveal details for the time being, which could only influence K. unfavorably and make him overly hopeful or overly anxious, suffice it to say that some spoke very favorably and also showed themselves very willing, while others expressed themselves less favorably, but by no means refused their help. All in all, the result is very pleasing, but one should not draw any particular conclusions from it, since all preliminary negotiations begin in a similar way and it is only the further development that shows the value of these preliminary negotiations. In any case, nothing is lost, and if, despite everything, it should still be possible to win over the director of the chancellery - various things have already been initiated for this purpose - then the whole thing is - as the surgeons say - a clean wound, and one can confidently do what follows expect.","The thought of his trial never left him now. He had often considered whether it might not be advisable to prepare a written defense and submit it to the court. In it he would offer a brief overview of his life, and for each event of any particular importance, explain why he had acted as he did, whether in his present judgment this course of action deserved approval or censure, and what reasons he could advance for the one or the other. The advantages of such a written defense over simply leaving things in the hands of his lawyer, who was far from perfect anyway, were obvious. After all, K. had no idea what action his lawyer was taking; in any case it wasn’t much , it had been over a month now since he’d summoned him, nor had any of these earlier consultations given K. the impression the man would be able to do much for him. In the first place, he scarcely asked any questions. And yet there was so much to ask. Questions were the main thing. K. had the feeling he could ask all the necessary questions on his own. His lawyer on the other hand, instead of asking questions, did all the talking, or sat across from him in silence, leaning slightly forward over the desk, probably because of his poor hearing, tugging at a strand in the middle of his beard and looking down at the carpet, perhaps at the very spot where K. had lain with Leni. Now and then he gave K. a few empty admonitions, as if talking to a child. Speeches as useless as they were boring, for which K. had no intention of paying one red cent in the final billing. When the lawyer seemed to feel he had humbled him adequately, he usually began to cheer him up a little again. He would tell him how he had already won or come close to winning many similar trials, trials which, if not quite so difficult in reality as his, appeared even more hopeless on the surface. He had a list of those trials right there in his drawer—with this he tapped some compartment or other in his desk—unfortunately he couldn’t show him the documents, since they were officially secret. Nevertheless the extensive experience he had gained in all these trials would naturally be used to K.’s benefit. He had of course set to work immediately, and the first petition was already nearly finished. It was very important, for the first impression made by the defense often influenced the whole course of the proceedings. Unfortunately, and he felt he must point this out to K., on some occasions initial petitions were not even read by the court. They were simply put in the file with a note that for the time being the hearings and surveillance of the accused were much more important than anything put in writing. If the petitioner pressed the issue, it was added that once all the evidence had been collected, and prior to the verdict, this first petition would be considered as well, together with all other documents of course. Unfortunately that wasn’t true either in most cases; the first petition was generally misplaced or completely lost, and even if it was retained to the very end, the lawyer had only heard this by way of rumor of course, it was scarcely even glanced at. All that was regrettable, but not entirely without justification; K. must not overlook the fact that the proceedings are not public, they can be made public if the court considers it necessary, but the Law does not insist upon it. As a result, the court records, and above all the writ of indictment, are not available to the accused and his defense lawyers, so that in general it’s not known, or not known precisely, what the first petition should be directed against, and for that reason it can only be by chance that it contains something of importance to the case. Truly pertinent and reasoned petitions can only be devised later, when, in the course of the defendant’s interrogations, the individual points of the indictment and its basis emerge more clearly, or may be surmised. Under these conditions the defense is naturally placed in a very unfavorable and difficult position. But that too is intentional. For the defense is not actually countenanced by the Law, but only tolerated, and there is even some controversy as to whether the relevant passages of the Law can truly be construed to include even such tolerance. In the strict sense, therefore, there are no court-recognized lawyers; all those who appear before the court as lawyers are basically shysters. Of course that has an extremely degrading effect upon the entire profession, and the next time K. went to the law court offices, he should take a look at the Lawyers’ Room , that was quite a sight too. He would probably be shocked by the lot gathered there. The narrow, low room to which they were relegated was in itself an indication of the court’s contempt for these people. Light enters the room only through a small hatch so high up that if someone wants to look out, and incidentally get a nose full of smoke and a sooty face from the chimney just outside, he first has to find a colleague who will hoist him up on his back. For over a year now—to give just one more example of the poor conditions—there’s been a hole in the floor of the room, not large enough for a person to fall through, but big enough that one whole leg can sink in. The Lawyers’ Room is in the upper level of the attic, so if someone slips through, his leg hangs down into the lower level, right into the hall where the parties are waiting. It’s no exaggeration when such conditions are described in lawyers’ circles as scandalous. Complaints to the administration don’t have the slightest effect, yet lawyers are strictly forbidden from changing anything in the room at their own expense. But there’s a reason they treat lawyers this way. They want to eliminate the defense as far as possible; everything is to be laid upon the defendant himself. Basically that’s not a bad position to take, but nothing would be more mistaken than to conclude from it that defendants have no need of lawyers before this court. On the contrary, there is no other court before which there is a greater need. For in general the proceedings are kept secret not only from the public but from the accused as well. Only insofar as possible of course, but to a very large extent it does prove possible. For even the accused has no access to the court records, and it’s very difficult to ascertain during the interrogations which documents are involved, particularly for the defendant, who after all is timid and disconcerted, and distracted by all sorts of cares. This is where the defense enters in. In general defense lawyers are not allowed to be present at the interrogations and so must question the defendant about an interrogation immediately upon its conclusion, if at all possible at the very door of the inquiry room, and deduce from the defendant’s often quite hazy accounts whatever might be of use to the defense. But that’s not what’s most important, since not much can be learned that way, though even here, as elsewhere, a skillful person can learn more than others. Nevertheless, the most important factor is still the lawyer’s personal contacts; they are the most valuable aspect of a defense. Now K. had no doubt already learned from his own experience that the lowest level of the court system is not entirely perfect, that it includes some employees who forget their duty and can be bribed, which in turn produces breaches, so to speak, in the strictly closed system of the court. Now this is where the majority of lawyers push their way in, bribing people and pumping them for information; in fact in earlier days there were even cases of stolen files. There’s no denying a few momentary and even surprisingly positive results can be achieved on the defendant’s behalf by such means, and petty lawyers parade them proudly to lure new customers, but as far as the future progress of the trial is concerned they’re meaningless or worse. Only honest personal contacts are of true value, and with higher officials, by which is meant of course higher officials from the lower ranks. This is the sole means by which the progress of the trial can be influenced, imperceptibly at first, but more and more clearly as it moves along. Only a few lawyers can do that of course, and here K.’s choice had been fortunate indeed. There were only one or two lawyers who might possibly match Dr. Huld’s contacts. Of course these paid no attention to the lot in the Lawyers’ Room and had nothing to do with them. Their ties to the court officials, however, were correspondingly stronger. It wasn’t even always necessary for Dr. Huld to go to court, wait in the outer offices for the chance appearance of examining magistrates, and then, according to their mood, achieve what was generally a merely apparent success, and perhaps not even that. No, as K. had seen himself, officials, and relatively high ones at that, came to him, offered information willingly that was clear or at least easily interpreted, discussed the recent progress of the trial, indeed in some cases even allowed themselves to be convinced, gladly taking on the other’s point of view. Of course one didn’t dare trust them too far with respect to this latter trait; no matter how decisively they state their new intent, which is favorable to the defense, they may well go straight to their office and issue a decision for the next day that conveys the exact opposite, and is perhaps even more severe with respect to the defendant than that which they had at first intended, and which they claimed to have entirely abandoned. Of course there was no way to protect oneself against that, for what was said in private conversation was exactly that, a private conversation with no public consequences, even if the defense had not been otherwise constrained to retain the favor of those gentlemen. On the other hand, of course, it was also true that these gentlemen were not moved simply by humanitarianism, or feelings of personal friendship, to establish contact with the defense, only a competent one naturally, but did so because they were in a certain sense dependent upon them. Here the disadvantage of a court system that was grounded from its very beginnings in secrecy came to the fore. The officials lack contact with the common people; they’re well prepared for the normal, average trial, which rolls along its course almost on its own and needs only a push now and then, but faced with very simple cases or with particularly complex ones, they’re often at a loss; because they’re constantly constricted by the Law both night and day, they have no proper understanding of human relationships, and in such cases they feel that lack keenly. Then they come to the lawyer for advice, and behind them comes an assistant carrying the files, which are otherwise so secret. Many a gentleman one would least expect to find in such a situation might be discovered at this very window, gazing almost hopelessly out into the street, while at his desk the lawyer studies the files to offer his advice. Moreover one could see at such times how uncommonly seriously these gentlemen took their profession, and into what great despair they were thrown when, due to the very nature of the obstacles, they could not overcome them. In other ways too their position is no easy one, nor should one do them the injustice of regarding it as such. The gradations and ranks of the court are infinite, extending beyond the ken even of initiates. The proceedings in the courts of law are generally a mystery to the lower officials as well; therefore they can almost never follow the progress of the cases they are working on throughout their course; the case enters their field of vision, often they know not whence, and continues on, they know not where. The lessons to be learned from the study of the individual stages of a trial, the final verdict and its basis, are lost to these officials. Their involvement is limited to that part of the trial circumscribed for them by the Law, and they generally know less about what follows, and thus about the results of their own efforts, than the defense, which as a rule remains in contact with the accused almost to the very end of the trial. So in this respect too, they can occasionally learn something of value from the defense. Was K. still surprised then, bearing all this in mind, at the irritability of the officials, which sometimes expressed itself—as everyone soon learned—in an insulting manner toward the parties involved? All officials are irritable, even when they appear calm. Of course the petty lawyers suffer in particular from this. For instance the following story is told, and has every appearance of truth. An elderly official, a decent, quiet gentleman, had studied a difficult case, rendered particularly complex due to the lawyer’s petitions, for one entire day and night without a break—these officials are truly the most industrious of people. Now as morning approached, after twenty-four hours of probably not very productive work, he went to the outer door, waited in ambush, and threw every lawyer who tried to enter down the steps. The lawyers gathered on the landing below and discussed what they should do; on the one hand they have no real right to be admitted, so they can hardly start legal proceedings against the official, and as already mentioned, they have to be careful not to arouse the ire of the bureaucracy. On the other hand each day missed at court is a day lost, so it was important to them to get in. Finally they decided to try to wear the old gentleman down. One lawyer at a time would rush up the stairs and, offering the greatest possible passive resistance, allow himself to be thrown back down, where he would then be caught by his colleagues. That lasted for about an hour; then the old gentleman, who was already tired from working all night, grew truly exhausted and went back into his office. At first those below could hardly believe it, so they sent someone up to check behind the door to make sure there was really no one there. Only then did they enter, probably not even daring to grumble. For the lawyers—and even the least important of them has at least a partial overview of the circumstances—are far from wishing to introduce or carry out any sort of improvement in the court system, while—and this is quite characteristic— almost every defendant, even the most simple-minded among them, starts thinking up suggestions for improvement from the moment the trial starts, and in doing so often wastes time and energy that would be better spent in other ways. The only proper approach is to learn to accept existing conditions. Even if it were possible to improve specific details—which, however, is merely an absurd superstition—one would have at best achieved something for future cases, while in the process damaging oneself immeasurably by having attracted the attention of an always vengeful bureaucracy. Just don’t attract attention! Keep calm, no matter how much it seems counter to good sense. Try to realize that this vast judicial organism remains, so to speak, in a state of eternal equilibrium, and that if you change something on your own where you are, you can cut the ground out from under your own feet and fall, while the vast organism easily compensates for the minor disturbance at some other spot—after all, everything is interconnected—and remains unchanged, if not, which is likely, even more resolute, more vigilant, more severe, more malicious. One should leave the task to the lawyers, instead of interfering with them. Reproaches are of little value, particularly when it seems the full import of what has caused them cannot be conveyed, but he must say how much K. had hurt his own affair by his behavior toward the chief clerk of the court. This influential man must almost certainly be crossed off the list of those to whom one might turn on K.’s behalf. He pointedly refused to acknowledge even passing references to K.’s trial. In many ways the officials were like children. They were often so hurt by seemingly minor matters, though K’s behavior, unfortunately, did not fall into that category, that they stopped speaking even with close friends, turning aside when they met them, and opposing them in every possible way. But then, surprisingly and for no apparent reason, they would allow themselves a laugh at some small joke attempted only because the situation seemed so hopeless, and were reconciled once more. It was both difficult and easy to relate to them; there were hardly any guidelines to go by. Sometimes it seemed amazing that an average lifetime sufficed to learn enough to work here with a modicum of success. Of course there are always dark hours, everyone has them, when it seems that one has accomplished nothing, when it seems as if the only trials that turned out well were those that were destined to do so from the very beginning, without any help at all, while all the others were lost in spite of following them so closely, in spite of all the effort, all the small apparent victories that gave such pleasure. Then of course nothing seems certain any longer, and if pressed specifically one does not even dare deny that trials that by nature should have turned out well were thrown off course precisely by the assistance offered. That too is a type of belief in oneself after all, but it is the only sort that remains. Lawyers are particularly susceptible to such attacks—they are of course mere attacks and nothing more—when a trial they have conducted satisfactorily up to a certain point is suddenly taken out of their hands. That’s probably the worst thing that can happen to a lawyer. It’s not the defendant who takes the trial from them, indeed that probably never happens; once a defendant has engaged a particular lawyer, he has to stick with him no matter what. How could he possibly sustain himself alone, once he has enlisted aid? So that doesn’t happen, but it does indeed sometimes happen that the trial takes a direction the lawyer is not permitted to follow. The trial, the defendant, everything is simply withdrawn from the lawyer; in that case the best of connections with the officials are of no use, for they themselves know nothing. The trial has entered a stage where no further assistance can be given, where it is being handled by inaccessible courts of law, where even the defendant is no longer within reach of the lawyer. Then you come home one day to find on your desk all the many petitions you submitted so diligently and with such great hopes in the case; they’ve been returned; since they can’t be transferred to the new stage of the trial, they’re worthless scraps of paper. But that doesn’t mean the trial has been lost, not by any means, or at any rate there is no definitive reason to assume so, one simply knows nothing more about the trial, and won’t learn anything more either. But fortunately such cases are exceptions, and even should K.’s trial turn out to be one of them , it was still far removed from such a stage at the moment. So there was still ample opportunity for the lawyer to take action, and K. could rest assured that those opportunities would be seized. As he had mentioned, the petition had not yet been submitted, but there was no hurry about that, the preliminary discussions with the officials in charge were of much greater importance, and those had already taken place. With varying degrees of success, it must be frankly admitted. It was far better for the time being not to reveal details which might only affect K. unfavorably and make him overly hopeful or all too anxious; suffice it to say that some of them had responded quite favorably and proved quite cooperative, while others had responded less favorably, while by no means refusing their assistance. The results were thus on the whole quite gratifying, although one mustn’t draw too many conclusions from them, since preliminary proceedings always started out that way and only further developments would reveal their true value. At any rate nothing was lost as yet, and if it still proved possible to win over the chief clerk of the court in spite of everything—various steps had already been taken toward that end—then the whole matter, as the surgeons say, was a clean wound and one could await what was to follow with confidence.","The thought of his case never left him now. He had often considered whether it would not be better to draw up a written defense and hand it in to the Court. In this defense he would give a short account of his life, and when he came to an event of any importance explain for what reasons he had acted as he did, intimate whether he approved or condemned his way of action in retrospect, and adduce grounds for the condemnation or approval. The advantages of such a written defense, as compared with the mere advocacy of a lawyer who himself was not impeccable, were undoubted. K. had no idea what the lawyer was doing about the case; at any rate it did not amount to much, it was more than a month since Huld had sent for him, and at none of the previous consultations had K. formed the impression that the man could do much for him. To begin with, he had hardly cross-questioned him at all. And there were so many questions to put. To ask questions was surely the main thing. K. felt that he could draw up all the necessary questions himself. But the lawyer, instead of asking questions, either did all the talking or sat quite dumb opposite him, bent slightly forward over his writing-table, probably because of his hardness of hearing, stroking a strand of hair in the middle of his beard and gazing at the carpet, perhaps at the very spot where K. had lain with Leni. Now and then he would give K. some empty admonitions such as people hand out to children. Admonitions as useless as they were wearisome, for which K. did not intend to pay a penny at the final reckoning. After the lawyer thought he had humbled him sufficiently, he usually set himself to encourage him slightly again. He had already, so he would relate, won many similar cases either outright or partially. Cases which, though in reality not quite so difficult, perhaps, as this one, had been outwardly still more hopeless. He had a list of these cases in a drawer of his desk -- at this he tapped one of them -- but he regretted he couldn't show it, as it was a matter of official secrecy. Nevertheless the vast experience he had gained through all these cases would now redound to K.'s benefit. He had started on K.'s case at once, of course, and the first plea was almost ready for presentation. That was very important, for the first impression made by the Defense often determined the whole course of subsequent proceedings. Though, unfortunately, it was his duty to warn K., it sometimes happened that the first pleas were not read by the Court at all. They simply filed them among the other papers and pointed out that for the time being the observation and interrogation of the accused were more important than any formal petition. If the petitioner pressed them, they generally added that before the verdict was pronounced all the material accumulated, including, of course, every document relating to the case, the first plea as well, would be carefully examined. But unluckily even that was not quite true in most cases, the first plea was often mislaid or lost altogether and, even if it were kept intact till the end, was hardly ever read; that was of course, the lawyer admitted, merely a rumor. It was all very regrettable, but not wholly without justification. K. must remember that the proceedings were not public; they could certainly, if the Court considered it necessary, become public, but the Law did not prescribe that they must be made public. Naturally, therefore, the legal records of the case, and above all the actual charge-sheets, were inaccessible to the accused and his counsel, consequently one did not know in general, or at least did not know with any precision, what charges to meet in the first plea; accordingly it could be only by pure chance that it contained really relevant matter. One could draw up genuinely effective and convincing pleas only later on, when the separate charges and the evidence on which they were based emerged more definitely or could be guessed at from the interrogations. In such circumstances the Defense was naturally in a very ticklish and difficult position. Yet that, too, was intentional. For the Defense was not actually countenanced by the Law, but only tolerated, and there were differences of opinion even on that point, whether the Law could be interpreted to admit such tolerance at all. Strictly speaking, therefore, none of the counsels for the Defense was recognized by the Court, all who appeared before the Court as councils being in reality merely in the position of pettifogging lawyers. That naturally had a very humiliating effect on the whole profession, and the next time K. visited the Law Court offices he should take a look at the lawyers' room, just for the sake of having seen it once in his life. He would probably be horrified by the kind of people he found assembled there. The very room, itself small and cramped, showed the contempt in which the Court held them. It was lit only by a small skylight, which was so high up that if you wanted to look out, you had to get some colleague to hoist you on his back, and even then the smoke from the chimney close by choked you and blackened your face. To give only one more example of the state the place was in -- there had been for more than a year now a hole in the floor, not so big that you could fall through the floor, but big enough to let a man's leg slip through. The lawyers' room was in the very top attic, so that if you stumbled through the hole your leg hung down into the lower attic, into the very corridor where the clients had to wait. It wasn't saying too much if the lawyers called these conditions scandalous. Complaints to the authorities had not the slightest effect, and it was strictly forbidden for the lawyers to make any structural repairs or alterations at their own expense. Still, there was some justification for this attitude on the part of the authorities. They wanted to eliminate defending counsel as much as possible; the whole onus of the Defense must be laid on the accused himself. A reasonable enough point of view, yet nothing could be more erroneous than to deduce from this that accused persons had no need of defending counsel when appearing before this Court. On the contrary, in no other Court was legal assistance so necessary. For the proceedings were not only kept secret from the general public, but from the accused as well. Of course only so far as this was possible, but it had proved possible to a very great extent. For even the accused had no access to the Court records, and to guess from the course of an interrogation what documents the Court had up its sleeve was very difficult, particularly for an accused person, who was himself implicated and had all sorts of worries to distract him. Now here was where defending counsel stepped in. Generally speaking, he was not allowed to be present during the examination, consequently he had to cross-question the accused immediately after an interrogation, if possible at the very door of the Court of Inquiry, and piece together from the usually confused reports he got anything that might be of use for the Defense. But even that was not the most important thing, for one could not elicit very much in that way, though of course here as elsewhere a capable man could elicit more than others. The most important thing was counsel's personal connection with officials of the Court; in that lay the chief value of the Defense. Now K. must have discovered from experience that the very lowest grade of the Court organization was by no means perfect and contained venal and corrupt elements, whereby to some extent a breach was made in the water-tight system of justice. This was where most of the petty lawyers tried to push their way in, by bribing and listening to gossip, in fact there had actually been cases of purloining documents, at least in former times. It was not to be gainsaid that these methods could achieve for the moment surprisingly favorable results for the accused, on which the petty lawyers prided themselves, spreading them out as a lure for new clients, but they had no effect on the further progress of the case, or only a bad effect. Nothing was of any real value but respectable personal connections with the higher officials, that was to say higher officials of subordinate rank, naturally. Only through these could the course of the proceedings be influenced, imperceptibly at first, perhaps, but more and more strongly as the case went on. Of course very few lawyers had such connections, and here K.'s choice had been a very fortunate one. Perhaps only one or two other lawyers could boast of the same connections as Dr. Huld. These did not worry their heads about the mob in the lawyers' room and had nothing whatever to do with them. But their relations with the Court officials were all the more intimate. It was not even necessary that Dr. Huld should always attend the Court, wait in the Ante-room of the Examining Magistrates till they chose to appear, and be dependent on their moods for earning perhaps a delusive success or not even that. No, as K. had himself seen, the officials, and very high ones among them, visited Dr. Huld of their own accord, voluntarily providing information with great frankness or at least in broad enough hints, discussing the next turn of the various cases; more, even sometimes letting themselves be persuaded to a new point of view. Certainly one should not rely too much on their readiness to be persuaded, for definitely as they might declare themselves for a new standpoint favorable to the Defense, they might well go straight to their offices and issue a statement in the directly contrary sense, a verdict far more severe on the accused than the original intention which they claimed to have renounced completely. Against that, of course, there was no remedy, for what they said to you in private was simply said to you in private and could not be followed up in public, even if the Defense were not obliged for other reasons to do its utmost to retain the favor of these gentlemen. On the other hand it had also to be considered that these gentlemen were not moved by mere human benevolence or friendly feeling in paying visits to defending counsel -- only to experienced counsel, of course; they were in a certain sense actually dependent on the Defense. They could not help feeling the disadvantages of a judiciary system which insisted on secrecy from the start. Their remoteness kept the officials from being in touch with the populace; for the average case they were excellently equipped, such a case proceeded almost mechanically and only needed a push now and then; yet confronted with quite simple cases, or particularly difficult cases, they were often utterly at a loss, they did not have any right understanding of human relations, since they were confined day and night to the workings of their judicial system, whereas in such cases a knowledge of human nature itself was indispensable. Then it was that they came to the lawyers for advice, with a servant behind them carrying the papers that were usually kept so secret. In that window over there many a gentleman one would never have expected to encounter had sat gazing out hopelessly into the street, while the lawyer at his desk examined his papers in order to give him good advice. And it was on such occasions as these that one could perceive how seriously these gentlemen took their vocation and how deeply they were plunged into despair when they came upon obstacles which the nature of things kept them from overcoming. In other ways, too, their position was not easy, and one must not do them an injustice by regarding it as easy. The ranks of officials in this judiciary system mounted endlessly, so that not even the initiated could survey the hierarchy as a whole. And the proceedings of the Courts were generally kept secret from subordinate officials, consequently they could hardly ever quite follow in their further progress the cases on which they had worked; any particular case thus appeared in their circle of jurisdiction often without their knowing whence it came, and passed from it they knew not whither. Thus the knowledge derived from a study of the various single stages of the case, the final verdict and the reasons for that verdict lay beyond the reach of these officials. They were forced to restrict themselves to that stage of the case which was prescribed for them by the Law, and as for what followed, in other words the results of their own work, they generally knew less about it than the Defense, which as a rule remained in touch with the accused almost to the end of the case. So in that respect, too, they could learn much that was worth knowing from the Defense. Should it surprise K., then, keeping all this in mind, to find that the officials lived in a state of irritability which sometimes expressed itself in offensive ways when they dealt with their clients? That was the universal experience. All the officials were in a constant state of irritation, even when they appeared calm. Naturally the petty lawyers were most liable to suffer from it. The following story, for example, was current, and it had all the appearance of truth. An old official, a well-meaning, quiet man, had a difficult case in hand which had been greatly complicated by the lawyer's petitions, and he had studied it continuously for a whole day and night -- the officials were really more conscientious than anyone else. Well, toward morning, after twenty-four hours of work with probably very little result, he went to the entrance door, hid himself behind it, and flung down the stairs every lawyer who tried to enter. The lawyers gathered down below on the landing and took counsel what they should do; on the one hand they had no real claim to be admitted and consequently could hardly take any legal action against the official, and also, as already mentioned, they had to guard against antagonizing the body of officials. But on the other hand every day they spent away from the Court was a day lost to them, and so a great deal depended on their getting in. At last they all agreed that the best thing to do was to tire out the 01(1 gentleman. one lawyer after another was sent rushing upstairs to offer the greatest possible show of passive resistance and let himself be thrown down again into the arms of ins colleagues. That lasted for about an hour, then the old gentleman -- who was exhausted in any case by his work overnight -- really grew tired and went back to his office. The lawyers down below would not believe it at first and sent one of their number up to peep behind the door and assure himself that the place was actually vacant. Only Then were they able to enter, and probably they did not dare even to grumble. For although the pettiest lawyer might be to some extent capable of analyzing the state of things in the Court, it never occurred to the lawyers that they should suggest or insist on any improvements in the system, while -- and this was very characteristic -- almost every accused man, even quite simple people among them, discovered from the earliest stages a passion for suggesting reforms which often wasted time and energy that could have been better employed in other directions. The only sensible thing was to adapt oneself to existing conditions. Even if it were possible to alter a detail for the better here or there -- but it was simple madness to think of it -- any benefit arising from that would profit clients in the future only, while one's own interests would be immeasurably injured by attracting the attention of the ever-vengeful officials. Anything rather than that! One must lie low, no matter how much it went against the grain, and try to understand that this great organization remained, so to speak, in a state of delicate balance, and that if someone took it upon himself to alter the disposition of things around him, he ran the risk of losing his footing and falling to destruction, while the organization would simply right itself by some compensating reaction in another part of its machinery -- since everything interlocked -- and remain unchanged, unless, indeed, which was very probable, it became still more rigid, more vigilant, severer, and more ruthless. One must really leave the lawyers to do their work, instead of interfering with them. Reproaches were not of much use, particularly when the offender was unable to perceive the full scope of the grounds for them; all the same, he must say that K. had very greatly damaged his case by his discourtesy to the Chief Clerk of the Court. That influential man could already almost be eliminated from the list of those who might be got to do something for K. He now ignored clearly on purpose even the slightest reference to the case. In many ways the functionaries were like children. Often they could be so deeply offended by the merest trifle -- unfortunately, K.'s behavior could not be classed as a trifle -- that they would stop speaking even to old friends, give them the cold shoulder, and work against them in all imaginable ways. But then, suddenly, in the most surprising fashion and without any particular reason, they would be moved to laughter by some small jest which you only dared to make because you felt you had nothing to lose, and then they were your friends again. In fact it was both easy and difficult to handle them, you could hardly lay down any fixed principles for dealing with them. Sometimes you felt astonished to think that one single ordinary lifetime sufficed to gather all the knowledge needed for a fair degree of success in such a profession. There were dark hours, of course, such as came to everybody, in which you thought you had achieved nothing at all, in which it seemed to you that only the cases predestined from the start to succeed came to a good end, which they would have reached in any event without your help, while every one of the others was doomed to fail in spite of all your maneuvers, all your exertions, all the illusory little victories on which you plumed yourself. That was a frame of mind, of course, in which nothing at all seemed certain, and so you could not positively deny when questioned that your intervention might have sidetracked some cases which would have run quite well on the right lines had they been left alone. A desperate kind of self-assurance, to be sure, yet it was the only kind available at such times. These moods -- for of course they were only moods, nothing more -- afflicted lawyers more especially when a case which they had conducted satisfactorily to the desired point was suddenly taken out of their hands. That was beyond all doubt the worst thing that could happen to a lawyer. Not that a client ever dismissed his lawyer from a case, such a thing was not done, an accused man, once having briefed a lawyer, must stick to him whatever happened. For how could he keep going by himself, once he had called in someone to help him? So that never happened, but it did sometimes happen that the case took a turn where the lawyer could no longer follow it. The case and the accused and everything were simply withdrawn from the lawyer; then even the best connections with officials could no longer achieve any result, for even they knew nothing. The case had simply reached the stage where further assistance was ruled out, it was being conducted in remote, inaccessible Courts, where even the accused was beyond the reach of a lawyer. Then you might come home some day and find on your table all the countless pleas relating to the case, which you had drawn up with such pains and such flattering hopes; they had been returned to you because in the new stage of the trial they were not admitted as relevant; they were mere waste paper. It did not follow that the case was lost, by no means, at least there was no decisive evidence for such an assumption; you simply knew nothing more about the case and would never know anything more about it. Now, very luckily, such occurrences were exceptional, and even if K.'s case were a case of that nature, it still had a long way to go before reaching that stage. For the time being, there were abundant opportunities for legal labor, and K. might rest assured that they would be exploited to the uttermost. The first plea, as before mentioned, was not yet handed in, but there was no hurry; far more important were the preliminary consultations with the relevant officials, and they had already taken place. With varying success, as must be frankly admitted. It would be better for the time being not to divulge details which might have a bad influence on K. by elating or depressing him unduly, yet this much could be asserted, that certain officials had expressed themselves very graciously and had also shown great readiness to help, while others had expressed themselves less favorably, but in spite of that had by no means refused their collaboration. The result on the whole was therefore very gratifying, though one must not seek to draw any definite conclusion from that, since all preliminary negotiations began in the same way and only in the course of further developments did it appear whether they had real value or not. At any rate nothing was yet lost, and if they could manage to win over the Chief Clerk of the Court in spite of all that had happened -- various moves had already been initiated toward that end -- then, to use a surgeon's expression, this could be regarded as a clean wound and one could await further developments with an easy mind.","He was no longer able to get the thought of the trial out of his head. He had often wondered whether it might not be a good idea to work out a written defence and hand it in to the court. It would contain a short description of his life and explain why he had acted the way he had at each event that was in any way important, whether he now considered he had acted well or ill, and his reasons for each. There was no doubt of the advantages a written defence of this sort would have over relying on the lawyer, who was anyway not without his shortcomings. K. had no idea what actions the lawyer was taking; it was certainly not a lot, it was more than a month since the lawyer had summoned him, and none of the previous discussions had given K. the impression that this man would be able to do much for him. Most importantly, he had asked him hardly any questions. And there were so many questions here to be asked. Asking questions were the most important thing. K. had the feeling that he would be able to ask all the questions needed here himself. The lawyer, in contrast, did not ask questions but did all the talking himself or sat silently facing him, leant forward slightly over the desk, probably because he was hard of hearing, pulled on a strand of hair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet, perhaps at the very spot where K. had lain with Leni. Now and then he would give K. some vague warning of the sort you give to children. His speeches were as pointless as they were boring, and K. decided that when the final bill came he would pay not a penny for them. Once the lawyer thought he had humiliated K. sufficiently, he usually started something that would raise his spirits again. He had already, he would then say, won many such cases, partly or in whole, cases which may not really have been as difficult as this one but which, on the face of it, had even less hope of success. He had a list of these cases here in the drawer—here he would tap on one or other of the drawers in his desk—but could, unfortunately, not show them to K. as they dealt with official secrets. Nonetheless, the great experience he had acquired through all these cases would, of course, be of benefit to K. He had, of course, begun work straight away and was nearly ready to submit the first documents. They would be very important because the first impression made by the defence will often determine the whole course of the proceedings. Unfortunately, though, he would still have to make it clear to K. that the first documents submitted are sometimes not even read by the court. They simply put them with the other documents and point out that, for the time being, questioning and observing the accused are much more important than anything written. If the applicant becomes insistent, then they add that before they come to any decision, as soon as all the material has been brought together, with due regard, of course, to all the documents, then these first documents to have been submitted will also be checked over. But unfortunately, even this is not usually true, the first documents submitted are usually mislaid or lost completely, and even if they do keep them right to the end they are hardly read, although the lawyer only knew about this from rumour. This is all very regrettable, but not entirely without its justifications. But K. should not forget that the trial would not be public, if the court deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that says it has to be. As a result, the accused and his defence don't have access even to the court records, and especially not to the indictment, and that means we generally don't know—or at least not precisely—what the first documents need to be about, which means that if they do contain anything of relevance to the case it's only by a lucky coincidence. If anything about the individual charges and the reasons for them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused is being questioned, then it's possible to work out and submit documents that really direct the issue and present proof, but not before. Conditions like this, of course, place the defence in a very unfavourable and difficult position. But that is what they intend. In fact, defence is not really allowed under the law, it's only tolerated, and there is even some dispute about whether the relevant parts of the law imply even that. So strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a counsel acknowledged by the court, and anyone who comes before this court as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer. The effect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the whole procedure, the next time K. is in the court offices he might like to have a look in at the lawyers' room, just so that he's seen it. He might well be quite shocked by the people he sees assembled there. The room they've been allocated, with its narrow space and low ceiling, will be enough to show what contempt the court has for these people. The only light in the room comes through a little window that is so high up that, if you want to look out of it, you first have to get one of your colleagues to support you on his back, and even then the smoke from the chimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face black. In the floor of this room—to give yet another example of the conditions there —there is a hole that's been there for more than a year , it's not so big that a man could fall through, but it is big enough for your foot to disappear through it. The lawyers' room is on the second floor of the attic; if your foot does go through it will hang down into the first floor of the attic underneath it, and right in the corridor where the litigants are waiting. It's no exaggeration when lawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace. Complaints to the management don't have the slightest effect, but the lawyers are strictly forbidden to alter anything in the room at their own expense. But even treating the lawyers in this way has its reasons. They want, as far as possible, to prevent any kind of defence, everything should be made the responsibility of the accused. No a bad point of view, basically, but nothing could be more mistaken than to think from that that lawyers are not necessary for the accused in this court. On the contrary, there is no court where they are less needed than here. This is because proceedings are generally kept secret not only from the public but also from the accused. Only as far as that is possible, of course, but it is possible to a very large extent. And the accused doesn't get to see the court records either, and it's very difficult to infer what's in the court records from what's been said during questioning based on them, especially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is faced with every possible worry to distract him. This is when the defence begins. Counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be present while the accused is being questioned, so afterwards, and if possible still at the door of the interview room, he has to learn what he can about it from him and extract whatever he can that might be of use, even though what the accused has to report is often very confused. But that is not the most important thing, as there's really not a lot that can be learned in this way, although in this, as with anything else, a competent man will learn more than another. Nonetheless, the most important thing is the lawyer's personal connections, that's where the real value of taking counsel lies. Now K. will most likely have already learned from his own experience that, among its very lowest orders, the court organisation does have its imperfections, the court is strictly closed to the public, but staff who forget their duty or who take bribes do, to some extent, show where the gaps are. This is where most lawyers will push their way in, this is where bribes are paid and information extracted, there have even, in earlier times at least, been incidents where documents have been stolen. There's no denying that some surprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused in this way, for a limited time, and these petty advocates then strut to and fro on the basis of them and attract new clients, but for the further course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing good. The only things of real value are honest personal contacts, contacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower grades, you understand. That is the only way the progress of the trial can be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it's true, but from then on it becomes more and more visible. There are, of course, not many lawyers who can do this, and K. has made a very good choice in this matter. There were probably no more than one or two who had as many contacts as Dr. Huld, but they don't bother with the company of the lawyers' room and have nothing to do with it. This means they have all the less contact with the court officials. It is not at all necessary for Dr. Huld to go to the court, wait in the ante-rooms for the examining judges to turn up, if they turn up, and try to achieve something which, according to the judges' mood is usually more apparent than real and most often not even that. No, K. has seen for himself that the court officials, including some who are quite high up, come forward without being asked, are glad to give information which is fully open or at least easy to understand, they discuss the next stages in the proceedings, in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quite willing to adopt the other person's point of view. However, when this happens, you should never trust them too far, as however firmly they may have declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant they might well go straight back to their offices and write a report for the court that says just the opposite, and might well be even harder on the defendant than the original view, the one they insist they've been fully dissuaded from. And, of course, there's no way of defending yourself from this, something said in private is indeed in private and cannot then be used in public , it's not something that makes it easy for the defence to keep those gentlemen's favour. On the other hand, it's also true that the gentlemen don't become involved with the defence—which will of course be done with great expertise—just for philanthropic reasons or in order to be friendly, in some respects it would be truer to say that they, too, have it allocated to them. This is where the disadvantages of a court structure that, right from the start, stipulates that all proceedings take place in private, come into force. In normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public, and they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normal trials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudge here and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especially difficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are very simple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, with their laws, and so they don't have the right feel for human relationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this. That's when they come for advice to the lawyer, with a servant behind them carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret. You could have seen many gentlemen at this window, gentlemen of whom you would least expect it, staring out this window in despair on the street below while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he can give them good advice. And at times like that it's also possible to see how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions and how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it's just not in their natures to overcome. But they're not in an easy position, to regard their positions as easy would be to do them an injustice. The different ranks and hierarchies of the court are endless, and even someone who knows his way around them cannot always tell what's going to happen. But even for the junior officials, the proceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret, so they are hardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed, court affairs appear in their range of vision often without their knowing where they come from and they move on further without their learning where they go. So civil servants like this are not able to learn the things you can learn from studying the successive stages that individual trials go through, the final verdict or the reasons for it. They're only allowed to deal with that part of the trial which the law allocates them, and they usually know less about the results of their work after it's left them than the defence does, even though the defence will usually stay in contact with the accused until the trial is nearly at its end, so that the court officials can learn many useful things from the defence. Bearing all this in mind, does it still surprise K. that the officials are irritated and often express themselves about the litigants in unflattering ways—which is an experience shared by everyone. All the officials are irritated, even when they appear calm. This causes many difficulties for the junior advocates, of course. There is a story, for instance, that has very much the ring of truth about it. It goes like this: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers. He had been studying it for a day and a night without a break—as these officials are indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do. When it was nearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps. The lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; on the one hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building so that there was hardly anything that they could legally do to the official and, as I've already mentioned, they would have to be careful not to set all the officials against them. On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way inside. In the end, they agreed that they would try to tire the old man out. One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps. That went on for about an hour until the old gentleman, who was already exhausted from working all night, was very tired and went back to his office. Those who were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first, so they sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if there really was no-one there, and only then did they all gather together and probably didn't even dare to complain, as it's far from being the lawyers' job to introduce any improvements in the court system, or even to want to. Even the most junior lawyer can understand the relationship there to some extent, but one significant point is that almost every defendant, even very simple people, begins to think of suggestions for improving the court as soon as his proceedings have begun, many of them often even spend time and energy on the matter that could be spent far better elsewhere. The only right thing to do is to learn how to deal with the situation as it is. Even if it were possible to improve any detail of it—which is anyway no more than superstitious nonsense—the best that they could achieve, although doing themselves incalculable harm in the process, is that they will have attracted the special attention of the officials for any case that comes up in the future, and the officials are always ready to seek revenge. Never attract attention to yourself! Stay calm, however much it goes against your character! Try to gain some insight into the size of the court organism and how, to some extent, it remains in a state of suspension, and that even if you alter something in one place you'll draw the ground out from under your feet and might fall, whereas if an enormous organism like the court is disrupted in any one place it finds it easy to provide a substitute for itself somewhere else. Everything is connected with everything else and will continue without any change or else, which is quite probable, even more closed, more attentive, more strict, more malevolent. So it's best to leave the work to the lawyers and not to keep disturbing them. It doesn't do much good to make accusations, especially if you can't make it clear what they're based on and their full significance, but it must be said that K. caused a great deal of harm to his own case by his behaviour towards the office director, he was a very influential man but now he might as well be struck off the list of those who might do anything for K. If the trial is mentioned, even just in passing, it's quite obvious that he's ignoring it. These officials are in many ways just like children. Often, something quite harmless—although K.'s behaviour could unfortunately not be called harmless—will leave them feeling so offended that they will even stop talking with good friends of theirs, they turn away when they see them and do everything they can to oppose them. But then, with no particular reason, surprisingly enough, some little joke that was only ever attempted because everything seemed so hopeless will make them laugh and they'll be reconciled. It's both difficult and hard at the same time to deal with them, and there's hardly any reason for it. It's sometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it's at all possible ever to have any success in one's work here. On the other hand, there are also dark moments, such as everyone has, when you think you've achieved nothing at all, when it seems that the only trials to come to a good end are those that were determined to have a good end from the start and would do so without any help, while all the others are lost despite all the running to and fro, all the effort, all the little, apparent successes that gave such joy. Then you no longer feel very sure of anything and, if asked about a trial that was doing well by its own nature but which was turned for the worse because you assisted in it, would not even dare deny that. And even that is a kind of self-confidence, but then it's the only one that's left. Lawyers are especially vulnerable to fits of depression of that sort—and they are no more than fits of depression of course—when a case is suddenly taken out of their hands after they've been conducting it satisfactorily for some time. That's probably the worst that can happen to a lawyer. It's not that the accused takes the case away from him, that hardly ever happens, once a defendant has taken on a certain lawyer he has to stay with him whatever happens. How could he ever carry on by himself after he's taken on help from a lawyer? No, that just doesn't happen, but what does sometimes happen is that the trial takes on a course where the lawyer may not go along with it. Client and trial are both simply taken away from the lawyer; and then even contact with the court officials won't help, however good they are, as they don't know anything themselves. The trial will have entered a stage where no more help can be given, where it's being processed in courts to which no-one has any access, where the defendant cannot even be contacted by his lawyer. You come home one day and find all the documents you've submitted, which you've worked hard to create and which you had the best hopes for, lying on the desk, they've been sent back as they can't be carried through to the next stage in the trial, they're just worthless scraps of paper. It doesn't meant that the case has been lost, not at all, or at least there is no decisive reason for supposing so , it's just that you don't know anything more about the case and won't be told anything of what's happening. Well, cases like that are the exceptions, I'm glad to say, and even if K.'s trial is one of them, it's still, for the time being, a long way off. But there was still plenty of opportunity for lawyers to get to work, and K. could be sure they would be made use of. As he had said, the time for submitting documents was still in the future and there was no rush to prepare them, it was much more important to start the initial discussions with the appropriate officials, and they had already taken place. With varying degrees of success, it must be said. It was much better not to give away any details before their time, as in that way K. could only be influenced unfavourably and his hopes might be raised or he might be made too anxious, better just to say that some individuals have spoken very favourably and shown themselves very willing to help, although others have spoken less favourably, but even they have not in any way refused to help. So all in all, the results are very encouraging, only you should certainly not draw any particular conclusions as all preliminary proceedings begin in the same way and it was only the way they developed further that would show what the value of these preliminary proceedings has been. Anyway, nothing has been lost yet, and if we can succeed in getting the office director, despite everything, on our side—and several actions have been undertaken to this end—then everything is a clean wound, as a surgeon would say, and we can wait for the results with some comfort.","He was no longer able to get the thought of the trial out of his head.

There's no denying that some surprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused in this way, for a limited time, and these petty advocates then strut to and fro on the basis of them and attract new clients, but for the further course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing good. The only things of real value are honest personal contacts, contacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower grades, you understand. That is the only way the progress of the trial can be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it's true, but from then on it becomes more and more visible. There are, of course, not many lawyers who can do this, and K. has made a very good choice in this matter. There were probably no more than one or two who had as many contacts as Dr. Huld, but they don't bother with the company of the lawyers' room and have nothing to do with it. This means they have all the less contact with the court officials. It is not at all necessary for Dr. Huld to go to the court, wait in the ante-rooms for the examining judges to turn up, if they turn up, and try to achieve something which, according to the judges' mood is usually more apparent than real and most often not even that. No, K. has seen for himself that the court officials, including some who are quite high up, come forward without being asked, are glad to give information which is fully open or at least easy to understand, they discuss the next stages in the proceedings, in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quite willing to adopt the other person's point of view. However, when this happens, you should never trust them too far, as however firmly they may have declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant they might well go straight back to their offices and write a report for the court that says just the opposite, and might well be even harder on the defendant than the original view, the one they insist they've been fully dissuaded from. And, of course, there's no way of defending yourself from this, something said in private is indeed in private and cannot then be used in public , it's not something that makes it easy for the defence to keep those gentlemen's favour. On the other hand, it's also true that the gentlemen don't become involved with the defence - which will of course be done with great expertise - just for philanthropic reasons or in order to be friendly, in some respects it would be truer to say that they, too, have it allocated to them. This is where the disadvantages of a court structure that, right from the start, stipulates that all proceedings take place in private, come into force. In normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public, and they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normal trials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudge here and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especially difficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are very simple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, with their laws, and so they don't have the right feel for human relationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this. That's when they come for advice to the lawyer, with a servant behind them carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret. You could have seen many gentlemen at this window, gentlemen of whom you would least expect it, staring out this window in despair on the street below while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he can give them good advice. And at times like that it's also possible to see how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions and how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it's just not in their natures to overcome. But they're not in an easy position, to regard their positions as easy would be to do them an injustice. The different ranks and hierarchies of the court are endless, and even someone who knows his way around them cannot always tell what's going to happen. But even for the junior officials, the proceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret, so they are hardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed, court affairs appear in their range of vision often without their knowing where they come from and they move on further without their learning where they go. So civil servants like this are not able to learn the things you can learn from studying the successive stages that individual trials go through, the final verdict or the reasons for it. They're only allowed to deal with that part of the trial which the law allocates them, and they usually know less about the results of their work after it's left them than the defence does, even though the defence will usually stay in contact with the accused until the trial is nearly at its end, so that the court officials can learn many useful things from the defence. Bearing all this in mind, does it still surprise K. that the officials are irritated and often express themselves about the litigants in unflattering ways - which is an experience shared by everyone. All the officials are irritated, even when they appear calm. This causes many difficulties for the junior advocates, of course. There is a story, for instance, that has very much the ring of truth about it. It goes like this: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers. He had been studying it for a day and a night without a break - as these officials are indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do. When it was nearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps. The lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; on the one hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building so that there was hardly anything that they could legally do to the official and, as I've already mentioned, they would have to be careful not to set all the officials against them. On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way inside. In the end, they agreed that they would try to tire the old man out. One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps. That went on for about an hour until the old gentleman, who was already exhausted from working all night, was very tired and went back to his office. Those who were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first, so they sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if there really was no-one there, and only then did they all gather together and probably didn't even dare to complain, as it's far from being the lawyers' job to introduce any improvements in the court system, or even to want to. Even the most junior lawyer can understand the relationship there to some extent, but one significant point is that almost every defendant, even very simple people, begins to think of suggestions for improving the court as soon as his proceedings have begun, many of them often even spend time and energy on the matter that could be spent far better elsewhere. The only right thing to do is to learn how to deal with the situation as it is. Even if it were possible to improve any detail of it - which is anyway no more than superstitious nonsense - the best that they could achieve, although doing themselves incalculable harm in the process, is that they will have attracted the special attention of the officials for any case that comes up in the future, and the officials are always ready to seek revenge. Never attract attention to yourself! Stay calm, however much it goes against your character! Try to gain some insight into the size of the court organism and how, to some extent, it remains in a state of suspension, and that even if you alter something in one place you'll draw the ground out from under your feet and might fall, whereas if an enormous organism like the court is disrupted in any one place it finds it easy to provide a substitute for itself somewhere else. Everything is connected with everything else and will continue without any change or else, which is quite probable, even more closed, more attentive, more strict, more malevolent. So it's best to leave the work to the lawyers and not to keep disturbing them. It doesn't do much good to make accusations, especially if you can't make it clear what they're based on and their full significance, but it must be said that K. caused a great deal of harm to his own case by his behaviour towards the office director, he was a very influential man but now he might as well be struck off the list of those who might do anything for K. If the trial is mentioned, even just in passing, it's quite obvious that he's ignoring it. These officials are in many ways just like children. Often, something quite harmless - although K.'s behaviour could unfortunately not be called harmless - will leave them feeling so offended that they will even stop talking with good friends of theirs, they turn away when they see them and do everything they can to oppose them. But then, with no particular reason, surprisingly enough, some little joke that was only ever attempted because everything seemed so hopeless will make them laugh and they'll be reconciled. It's both difficult and hard at the same time to deal with them, and there's hardly any reason for it. It's sometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it's at all possible ever to have any success in one's work here. On the other hand, there are also dark moments, such as everyone has, when you think you've achieved nothing at all, when it seems that the only trials to come to a good end are those that were determined to have a good end from the start and would do so without any help, while all the others are lost despite all the running to and fro, all the effort, all the little, apparent successes that gave such joy. Then you no longer feel very sure of anything and, if asked about a trial that was doing well by its own nature but which was turned for the worse because you assisted in it, would not even dare deny that. And even that is a kind of self- confidence, but then it's the only one that's left. Lawyers are especially vulnerable to fits of depression of that sort - and they are no more than fits of depression of course - when a case is suddenly taken out of their hands after they've been conducting it satisfactorily for some time. That's probably the worst that can happen to a lawyer. It's not that the accused takes the case away from him, that hardly ever happens, once a defendant has taken on a certain lawyer he has to stay with him whatever happens. How could he ever carry on by himself after he's taken on help from a lawyer? No, that just doesn't happen, but what does sometimes happen is that the trial takes on a course where the lawyer may not go along with it. Client and trial are both simply taken away from the lawyer; and then even contact with the court officials won't help, however good they are, as they don't know anything themselves. The trial will have entered a stage where no more help can be given, where it's being processed in courts to which no-one has any access, where the defendant cannot even be contacted by his lawyer. You come home one day and find all the documents you've submitted, which you've worked hard to create and which you had the best hopes for, lying on the desk, they've been sent back as they can't be carried through to the next stage in the trial, they're just worthless scraps of paper. It doesn't mean that the case has been lost, not at all, or at least there is no decisive reason for supposing so , it's just that you don't know anything more about the case and won't be told anything of what's happening. Well, cases like that are the exceptions, I'm glad to say, and even if K.'s trial is one of them, it's still, for the time being, a long way off. But there was still plenty of opportunity for lawyers to get to work, and K. could be sure they would be made use of. As he had said, the time for submitting documents was still in the future and there was no rush to prepare them, it was much more important to start the initial discussions with the appropriate officials, and they had already taken place. With varying degrees of success, it must be said. It was much better not to give away any details before their time, as in that way K. could only be influenced unfavourably and his hopes might be raised or he might be made too anxious, better just to say that some individuals have spoken very favourably and shown themselves very willing to help, although others have spoken less favourably, but even they have not in any way refused to help. So all in all, the results are very encouraging, only you should certainly not draw any particular conclusions as all preliminary proceedings begin in the same way and it was only the way they developed further that would show what the value of these preliminary proceedings has been. Anyway, nothing has been lost yet, and if we can succeed in getting the office director, despite everything, on our side - and several actions have been undertaken to this end - then everything is a clean wound, as a surgeon would say, and we can wait for the results with some comfort."
"K. wandte sich um, kaum bemerkte das der Kaufmann, als er sofort aufstehen wollte. »Bleiben Sie sitzen«, sagte K. und zog einen Sessel neben ihn. »Sind Sie schon ein alter Klient des Advokaten?« fragte K. »Ja«, sagte der Kaufmann, »ein sehr alter Klient.« »Wieviel Jahre vertritt er Sie denn schon?« fragte K. »Ich weiß nicht, wie Sie es meinen«, sagte der Kaufmann, »in geschäftlichen Rechtsangelegenheiten – ich habe ein Getreidegeschäft – vertritt mich der Advokat schon, seit ich das Geschäft übernommen habe, also etwa seit zwanzig Jahren, in meinem eigenen Prozeß, auf den Sie wahrscheinlich anspielen, vertritt er mich auch seit Beginn, es ist schon länger als fünf Jahre. Ja, weit über fünf Jahre«, fügte er dann hinzu und zog eine alte Brieftasche hervor, »hier habe ich alles aufgeschrieben; wenn Sie wollen, sage ich Ihnen die genauen Daten. Es ist schwer, alles zu behalten. Mein Prozeß dauert wahrscheinlich schon viel länger, er begann kurz nach dem Tod meiner Frau, und das ist schon länger als fünfeinhalb Jahre.« K. rückte näher zu ihm. »Der Advokat übernimmt also auch gewöhnliche Rechtssachen?« fragte er. Diese Verbindung der Gerichte und Rechtswissenschaften schien K. ungemein beruhigend. »Gewiß«, sagte der Kaufmann und flüsterte dann K. zu: »Man sagt sogar, daß er in diesen Rechtssachen tüchtiger ist als in den anderen.« Aber dann schien er das Gesagte zu bereuen, er legte K. eine Hand auf die Schulter und sagte: »Ich bitte Sie sehr, verraten Sie mich nicht.« K. klopfte ihm zur Beruhigung auf den Schenkel und sagte: »Nein, ich bin kein Verräter.« »Er ist nämlich rachsüchtig«, sagte der Kaufmann. »Gegen einen so treuen Klienten wird er gewiß nichts tun«, sagte K. »O doch«, sagte der Kaufmann, »wenn er aufgeregt ist, kennt er keine Unterschiede, übrigens bin ich ihm nicht eigentlich treu.« »Wieso denn nicht?« fragte K. »Soll ich es Ihnen anvertrauen?« fragte der Kaufmann zweifelnd. »Ich denke, Sie dürfen es«, sagte K. »Nun«, sagte der Kaufmann, »ich werde es Ihnen zum Teil anvertrauen, Sie müssen mir aber auch ein Geheimnis sagen, damit wir uns gegenüber dem Advokaten gegenseitig festhalten.« »Sie sind sehr vorsichtig«, sagte K., »aber ich werde Ihnen ein Geheimnis sagen, das Sie vollständig beruhigen wird. Worin besteht also Ihre Untreue gegenüber dem Advokaten?« »Ich habe«, sagte der Kaufmann zögernd und in einem Ton, als gestehe er etwas Unehrenhaftes ein, »ich habe außer ihm noch andere Advokaten.« »Das ist doch nichts so Schlimmes«, sagte K., ein wenig enttäuscht. »Hier ja«, sagte der Kaufmann, der noch seit seinem Geständnis schwer atmete, infolge K.s Bemerkung aber mehr Vertrauen faßte. »Es ist nicht erlaubt. Und am allerwenigsten ist es erlaubt, neben einem sogenannten Advokaten auch noch Winkeladvokaten zu nehmen. Und gerade das habe ich getan, ich habe außer ihm noch fünf Winkeladvokaten.« »Fünf!« rief K., erst die Zahl setzte ihn in Erstaunen, »fünf Advokaten außer diesem?« Der Kaufmann nickte: »Ich verhandle gerade noch mit einem sechsten.« »Aber wozu brauchen Sie denn soviel Advokaten?« fragte K. »Ich brauche alle«, sagte der Kaufmann. »Wollen Sie mir das nicht erklären?« fragte K. »Gern«, sagte der Kaufmann. »Vor allem will ich doch meinen Prozeß nicht verlieren, das ist doch selbstverständlich. Infolgedessen darf ich nichts, was mir nützen könnte, außer acht lassen; selbst wenn die Hoffnung auf Nutzen in einem bestimmten Falle nur ganz gering ist, darf ich sie auch nicht verwerfen. Ich habe deshalb alles, was ich besitze, auf den Prozeß verwendet. So habe ich zum Beispiel alles Geld meinem Geschäft entzogen, früher füllten die Büroräume meines Geschäfts fast ein Stockwerk, heute genügt eine kleine Kammer im Hinterhaus, wo ich mit einem Lehrjungen arbeite. Diesen Rückgang hat natürlich nicht nur die Entziehung des Geldes verschuldet, sondern mehr noch die Entziehung meiner Arbeitskraft. Wenn man für seinen Prozeß etwas tun will, kann man sich mit anderem nur wenig befassen.« »Sie arbeiten also auch selbst bei Gericht?« fragte K. »Gerade darüber möchte ich gern etwas erfahren.« »Darüber kann ich nur wenig berichten«, sagte der Kaufmann, »anfangs habe ich es wohl auch versucht, aber ich habe bald wieder davon abgelassen. Es ist zu erschöpfend und bringt nicht viel Erfolg. Selbst dort zu arbeiten und zu unterhandeln, hat sich wenigstens für mich als ganz unmöglich erwiesen. Es ist ja dort schon das bloße Sitzen und Warten eine große Anstrengung. Sie kennen ja selbst die schwere Luft in den Kanzleien.« »Wieso wissen Sie denn, daß ich dort war?« fragte K. »Ich war gerade im Wartezimmer, als Sie durchgingen.« »Was für ein Zufall das ist!« rief K., ganz hingenommen und die frühere Lächerlichkeit des Kaufmanns ganz vergessend. »Sie haben mich also gesehen! Sie waren im Wartezimmer, als ich durchging. Ja, ich bin dort einmal durchgegangen.« »Es ist kein so großer Zufall«, sagte der Kaufmann, »ich bin dort fast jeden Tag.« »Ich werde nun wahrscheinlich auch öfters hingehen müssen«, sagte K., »nur werde ich wohl kaum mehr so ehrenvoll aufgenommen werden wie damals. Alle standen auf. Man dachte wohl, ich sei ein Richter.« »Nein«, sagte der Kaufmann, »wir grüßten damals den Gerichtsdiener. Daß Sie ein Angeklagter sind, das wußten wir. Solche Nachrichten verbreiten sich sehr rasch.« »Das wußten Sie also schon«, sagte K., »dann erschien Ihnen aber mein Benehmen vielleicht hochmütig. Sprach man sich nicht darüber aus?« »Nein«, sagte der Kaufmann, »im Gegenteil. Aber das sind Dummheiten.« »Was für Dummheiten denn?« fragte K. »Warum fragen Sie danach?« sagte der Kaufmann ärgerlich. »Sie scheinen die Leute dort noch nicht zu kennen und werden es vielleicht unrichtig auffassen. Sie müssen bedenken, daß in diesem Verfahren immer wieder viele Dinge zur Sprache kommen, für die der Verstand nicht mehr ausreicht, man ist einfach zu müde und abgelenkt für vieles, und zum Ersatz verlegt man sich auf den Aberglauben. Ich rede von den anderen, bin aber selbst gar nicht besser. Ein solcher Aberglaube ist es zum Beispiel, daß viele aus dem Gesicht des Angeklagten, insbesondere aus der Zeichnung der Lippen, den Ausgang des Prozesses erkennen wollen. Diese Leute also haben behauptet, Sie würden, nach Ihren Lippen zu schließen, gewiß und bald verurteilt werden. Ich wiederhole, es ist ein lächerlicher Aberglaube und in den meisten Fällen durch die Tatsachen auch vollständig widerlegt, aber wenn man in jener Gesellschaft lebt, ist es schwer, sich solchen Meinungen zu entziehen. Denken Sie nur, wie stark dieser Aberglaube wirken kann. Sie haben doch einen dort angesprochen, nicht? Er konnte Ihnen aber kaum antworten. Es gibt natürlich viele Gründe, um dort verwirrt zu sein, aber einer davon war auch der Anblick Ihrer Lippen. Er hat später erzählt, er hätte auf Ihren Lippen auch das Zeichen seiner eigenen Verurteilung zu sehen geglaubt.« »Meine Lippen?« fragte K., zog einen Taschenspiegel hervor und sah sich an. »Ich kann an meinen Lippen nichts Besonderes erkennen. Und Sie?« »Ich auch nicht«, sagte der Kaufmann, »ganz und gar nicht.« »Wie abergläubisch diese Leute sind!« rief K. aus. »Sagte ich es nicht?« fragte der Kaufmann. »Verkehren sie denn soviel untereinander und tauschen sie ihre Meinungen aus?« sagte K. »Ich habe mich bisher ganz abseits gehalten.« »Im allgemeinen verkehren sie nicht miteinander«, sagte der Kaufmann, »das wäre nicht möglich, es sind ja so viele. Es gibt auch wenig gemeinsame Interessen. Wenn manchmal in einer Gruppe der Glaube an ein gemeinsames Interesse auftaucht, so erweist er sich bald als ein Irrtum. Gemeinsam läßt sich gegen das Gericht nichts durchsetzen. Jeder Fall wird für sich untersucht, es ist ja das sorgfältigste Gericht. Gemeinsam kann man also nichts durchsetzen, nur ein einzelner erreicht manchmal etwas im geheimen; erst wenn es erreicht ist, erfahren es die anderen; keiner weiß, wie es geschehen ist. Es gibt also keine Gemeinsamkeit, man kommt zwar hie und da in den Wartezimmern zusammen, aber dort wird wenig besprochen. Die abergläubischen Meinungen bestehen schon seit alters her und vermehren sich förmlich von selbst.« »Ich sah die Herren dort im Wartezimmer«, sagte K., »ihr Warten kam mir so nutzlos vor.« »Das Warten ist nicht nutzlos«, sagte der Kaufmann, »nutzlos ist nur das selbständige Eingreifen. Ich sagte schon, daß ich jetzt außer diesem noch fünf Advokaten habe. Man sollte doch glauben – ich selbst glaubte es zuerst –, jetzt könnte ich ihnen die Sache vollständig überlassen. Das wäre aber ganz falsch. Ich kann sie ihnen weniger überlassen, als wenn ich nur einen hätte. Sie verstehen das wohl nicht?« »Nein«, sagte K. und legte, um den Kaufmann an seinem allzu schnellen Reden zu hindern, die Hand beruhigend auf seine Hand, »ich möchte Sie nur bitten, ein wenig langsamer zu reden, es sind doch lauter für mich sehr wichtige Dinge, und ich kann Ihnen nicht recht folgen.« »Gut, daß Sie mich daran erinnern«, sagte der Kaufmann, »Sie sind ja ein Neuer, ein Junger. Ihr Prozeß ist ein halbes Jahr alt, nicht wahr? Ja, ich habe davon gehört. Ein so junger Prozeß! Ich aber habe diese Dinge schon unzähligemal durchgedacht, sie sind mir das Selbstverständlichste auf der Welt.« »Sie sind wohl froh, daß Ihr Prozeß schon so weit fortgeschritten ist?« fragte K., er wollte nicht geradezu fragen, wie die Angelegenheiten des Kaufmanns stünden. Er bekam aber auch keine deutliche Antwort. »Ja, ich habe meinen Prozeß fünf Jahre lang fortgewälzt«, sagte der Kaufmann und senkte den Kopf, »es ist keine kleine Leistung.« Dann schwieg er ein Weilchen. K. horchte, ob Leni nicht schon komme. Einerseits wollte er nicht, daß sie komme, denn er hatte noch vieles zu fragen und wollte auch nicht von Leni in diesem vertraulichen Gespräch mit dem Kaufmann angetroffen werden, andererseits aber ärgerte er sich darüber, daß sie trotz seiner Anwesenheit so lange beim Advokaten blieb, viel länger, als zum Reichen der Suppe nötig war. »Ich erinnere mich noch an die Zeit genau«, begann der Kaufmann wieder, und K. war gleich voll Aufmerksamkeit, »als mein Prozeß etwa so alt war wie jetzt Ihr Prozeß. Ich hatte damals nur diesen Advokaten, war aber nicht sehr mit ihm zufrieden.« Hier erfahre ich ja alles, dachte K. und nickte lebhaft mit dem Kopf, als könne er dadurch den Kaufmann aufmuntern, alles Wissenswerte zu sagen. »Mein Prozeß«, fuhr der Kaufmann fort, »kam nicht vorwärts, es fanden zwar Untersuchungen statt, ich kam auch zu jeder, sammelte Material, erlegte alle meine Geschäftsbücher bei Gericht, was, wie ich später erfuhr, nicht einmal nötig war, ich lief immer wieder zum Advokaten, er brachte auch verschiedene Eingaben ein –.« »Verschiedene Eingaben?« fragte K. »Ja, gewiß«, sagte der Kaufmann. »Das ist mir sehr wichtig«, sagte K., »in meinem Fall arbeitet er noch immer an der ersten Eingabe. Er hat noch nichts getan. Ich sehe jetzt, er vernachlässigt mich schändlich.« »Daß die Eingabe noch nicht fertig ist, kann verschiedene berechtigte Gründe haben«, sagte der Kaufmann. »Übrigens hatte es sich bei meinen Eingaben später gezeigt, daß sie ganz wertlos waren. Ich habe sogar eine durch das Entgegenkommen eines Gerichtsbeamten selbst gelesen. Sie war zwar gelehrt, aber eigentlich inhaltlos. Vor allem sehr viel Latein, das ich nicht verstehe, dann seitenlange allgemeine Anrufungen des Gerichtes, dann Schmeicheleien für einzelne bestimmte Beamte, die zwar nicht genannt waren, die aber ein Eingeweihter jedenfalls erraten mußte, dann Selbstlob des Advokaten, wobei er sich auf geradezu hündische Weise vor dem Gericht demütigte, und endlich Untersuchungen von Rechtsfällen aus alter Zeit, die dem meinigen ähnlich sein sollten. Diese Untersuchungen waren allerdings, soweit ich ihnen folgen konnte, sehr sorgfältig gemacht. Ich will auch mit diesem allen kein Urteil über die Arbeit des Advokaten abgeben, auch war die Eingabe, die ich gelesen habe, nur eine unter mehreren, jedenfalls aber, und davon will ich jetzt sprechen, konnte ich damals in meinem Prozeß keinen Fortschritt sehen.« »Was für einen Fortschritt wollten Sie denn sehen?« fragte K. »Sie fragen ganz vernünftig«, sagte der Kaufmann lächelnd, »man kann in diesem Verfahren nur selten Fortschritte sehen. Aber damals wußte ich das nicht. Ich bin Kaufmann und war es damals noch viel mehr als heute, ich wollte greifbare Fortschritte haben, das Ganze sollte sich zum Ende neigen oder wenigstens den regelrechten Aufstieg nehmen. Statt dessen gab es nur Einvernehmungen, die meist den gleichen Inhalt hatten; die Antworten hatte ich schon bereit wie eine Litanei; mehrmals in der Woche kamen Gerichtsboten in mein Geschäft, in meine Wohnung oder wo sie mich sonst antreffen konnten; das war natürlich störend (heute ist es wenigstens in dieser Hinsicht viel besser, der telephonische Anruf stört viel weniger), auch unter meinen Geschäftsfreunden, insbesondere aber unter meinen Verwandten, fingen Gerüchte von meinem Prozeß sich zu verbreiten an, Schädigungen gab es also von allen Seiten, aber nicht das geringste Anzeichen sprach dafür, daß auch nur die erste Gerichtsverhandlung in der nächsten Zeit stattfinden würde. Ich ging also zum Advokaten und beklagte mich. Er gab mir zwar lange Erklärungen, lehnte es aber entschieden ab, etwas in meinem Sinne zu tun, niemand habe Einfluß auf die Festsetzung der Verhandlung, in einer Eingabe darauf zu dringen – wie ich es verlangte –, sei einfach unerhört und würde mich und ihn verderben. Ich dachte: Was dieser Advokat nicht will oder kann, wird ein anderer wollen und können. Ich sah mich also nach anderen Advokaten um. Ich will es gleich vorwegnehmen: keiner hat die Festsetzung der Hauptverhandlung verlangt oder durchgesetzt, es ist, allerdings mit einem Vorbehalt, von dem ich noch sprechen werde, wirklich unmöglich, hinsichtlich dieses Punktes hat mich also dieser Advokat nicht getäuscht; im übrigen aber hatte ich es nicht zu bedauern, mich noch an andere Advokaten gewendet zu haben. Sie dürften wohl von Dr. Huld auch schon manches über die Winkeladvokaten gehört haben, er hat sie Ihnen wahrscheinlich als sehr verächtlich dargestellt, und das sind sie wirklich. Allerdings unterläuft ihm immer, wenn er von ihnen spricht und sich und seine Kollegen zu ihnen in Vergleich setzt, ein kleiner Fehler, auf den ich Sie ganz nebenbei auch aufmerksam machen will. Er nennt dann immer die Advokaten seines Kreises zur Unterscheidung die ›großen Advokaten‹. Das ist falsch, es kann sich natürlich jeder ›groß‹ nennen, wenn es ihm beliebt, in diesem Fall aber entscheidet doch nur der Gerichtsgebrauch. Nach diesem gibt es nämlich außer den Winkeladvokaten noch kleine und große Advokaten. Dieser Advokat und seine Kollegen sind jedoch nur die kleinen Advokaten, die großen Advokaten aber, von denen ich nur gehört und die ich nie gesehen habe, stehen im Rang unvergleichlich höher über den kleinen Advokaten als diese über den verachteten Winkeladvokaten.« »Die großen Advokaten?« fragte K. »Wer sind denn die? Wie kommt man zu ihnen?« »Sie haben also noch nie von ihnen gehört«, sagte der Kaufmann. »Es gibt kaum einen Angeklagten, der nicht, nachdem er von ihnen erfahren hat, eine Zeitlang von ihnen träumen würde. Lassen Sie sich lieber nicht dazu verführen. Wer die großen Advokaten sind, weiß ich nicht, und zu ihnen kommen kann man wohl gar nicht. Ich kenne keinen Fall, von dem sich mit Bestimmtheit sagen ließe, daß sie eingegriffen hätten. Manchen verteidigen sie, aber durch eigenen Willen kann man das nicht erreichen, sie verteidigen nur den, den sie verteidigen wollen. Die Sache, deren sie sich annehmen, muß aber wohl über das niedrige Gericht schon hinausgekommen sein. Im übrigen ist es besser, nicht an sie zu denken, denn sonst kommen einem die Besprechungen mit den anderen Advokaten, deren Ratschläge und deren Hilfeleistungen so widerlich und nutzlos vor, ich habe es selbst erfahren, daß man am liebsten alles wegwerfen, sich zu Hause ins Bett legen und von nichts mehr hören wollte. Das wäre aber natürlich wieder das Dümmste, auch hätte man im Bett nicht lange Ruhe.« »Sie dachten damals also nicht an die großen Advokaten?« fragte K. »Nicht lange«, sagte der Kaufmann und lächelte wieder, »vollständig vergessen kann man sie leider nicht, besonders die Nacht ist solchen Gedanken günstig. Aber damals wollte ich ja sofortige Erfolge, ich ging daher zu den Winkeladvokaten.«","K. turned around, the businessman hardly noticed it when he wanted to get up immediately. ""Sit down,"" said K. and pulled a chair up next to him. ""Are you an old client of the lawyer?"" asked K. ""Yes,"" said the merchant, ""a very old client."" ""How many years has he been representing you?"" asked K. ""I don't know how you do it I mean,"" said the merchant, ""in legal business matters - I have a grain business - the lawyer has been representing me since I took over the business, about twenty years, in my own case, to which you are probably alluding, he is representing me well since the beginning, it's been longer than five years. Yes, well over five years,' he then added, pulling out an old wallet, 'I've written it all down here; if you want I can tell you the exact dates. It's hard to keep everything. My trial has probably lasted much longer, it began shortly after my wife's death, and that's been more than five and a half years.' K. moved closer to him. ""So the lawyer also takes on ordinary legal matters?"" he asked. This connection between the courts and jurisprudence seemed extremely reassuring to K. ""Certainly,"" said the merchant, and then whispered to K., ""They even say that he's more competent in these legal matters than in the others."" But then he seemed to regret what he had said, he laid a hand on K.'s shoulder and said: ""Please, don't betray me."" K. patted his thigh to calm him down and said: ""No, I'm not a traitor."" ""He's vengeful,"" said the merchant. ""He certainly won't do anything about such a loyal client,"" said K. ""Oh yes,"" said the businessman, ""when he's excited he doesn't know any different, by the way I'm not really loyal to him."" ""Why not? ' asked K. 'Shall I entrust it to you?' asked the businessman doubtfully. ""I think you can,"" said K. ""Well,"" said the businessman, ""I'll confide it to you in part, but you must also tell me a secret so that we can hold each other close to the lawyer."" are very careful,"" said K., ""but I'll tell you a secret that will completely calm you down. So what is your disloyalty to the lawyer?' 'I have,' said the merchant hesitantly, and in a tone as if he were admitting something dishonourable, 'I have other lawyers besides him.' said K., a little disappointed. ""Here, yes,"" said the merchant, who had been breathing heavily since his confession, but gained more confidence as a result of K.'s remark. ""It is not allowed. And least of all is it permissible to take on crooked lawyers in addition to a so-called lawyer. And that's exactly what I did, besides him I have five more crooked lawyers."" ""Five!"" cried K., only the number surprised him, ""five lawyers besides this one?"" The businessman nodded: ""I'm still negotiating with one sixth.' 'But why do you need so many lawyers?' asked K. 'I need them all,' said the merchant. ""Wouldn't you like to explain that to me?"" asked K. ""I'd be happy to,"" said the merchant. ""Above all, I don't want to lose my case, that goes without saying. Consequently, I must not neglect anything that might be of use to me; even if the hope of benefit in a particular case is very small, I must not discard it either. I have therefore used everything I possess on the trial. For example, I withdrew all the money from my business. The offices of my business used to take up almost one floor. Today, a small room in the back building is enough, where I work with an apprentice. Of course, this decline was not only due to the withdrawal of money, but even more so to the withdrawal of my ability to work. If you want to do something for your trial, there’s not much else you can do.” “So you work at the court yourself?” asked K. “That’s exactly what I’d like to know.” “I can only report a little about it.” , said the merchant, ""at first I tried, too, but I soon gave up. It's too exhausting and doesn't bring much success. Even working and negotiating there has proved quite impossible, at least for me. Just sitting there and waiting is a lot of effort. You know the heavy air in the offices yourself."" ""How do you know that I was there?"" asked K. ""I was in the waiting room when you went through."" ""What a coincidence that is!"" exclaimed K ., completely accepted and completely forgetting the former ridiculousness of the merchant. 'So you saw me! They were in the waiting room when I walked through. Yes, I went through there once."" ""It's not such a big coincidence,"" said the merchant, ""I'm there almost every day."" ""I'll probably have to go there more often now,"" said K., ""only I will can hardly be received as honorably as it was then. Everyone got up. They probably thought I was a judge."" ""No,"" said the merchant, ""we greeted the bailiff back then. We knew that you were a defendant. News like that spreads very quickly."" ""So you already knew that,"" said K., ""but then my behavior might have seemed arrogant to you. Didn't they talk about it?"" ""No,"" said the merchant, ""on the contrary. But that's stupidity.' 'What kind of stupidity?' asked K. 'Why are you asking about it?' said the businessman angrily. 'You don't seem to know the people there and you might take it the wrong way. You have to consider that in this process many things come up again and again for which reason is no longer sufficient, one is simply too tired and distracted for many things, and one resorts to superstition as a substitute. I'm talking about the others, but I'm no better myself. It is such a superstition, for example, that many want to see the outcome of the trial from the face of the accused, especially from the markings on his lips. So these people have said that, judging from your lips, you will certainly and soon be convicted. I repeat, it's a ridiculous superstition and in most cases completely disproved by the facts, but living in that society it's hard to resist such opinions. Just think how powerful this superstition can be. You approached one there, didn't you? But he could hardly answer you. There are of course many reasons to be confused there, but one of them was also the sight of your lips. He said later that he thought he saw the sign of his own condemnation on your lips.' 'My lips?' asked K., pulling out a pocket mirror and looking at himself. “I can't see anything special about my lips. And you?' 'Me neither,' said the merchant, 'not at all.' 'How superstitious these people are!' exclaimed K.. ""Didn't I say so?"" asked the merchant. 'Do they talk to each other so much and exchange opinions?' said K. 'I've kept quite aloof up to now.' many. There are also few common interests. When belief in a common interest sometimes arises in a group, it soon proves to be a mistake. Nothing can be enforced jointly against the court. Each case is examined individually, it is the most careful court. So you can't achieve anything together, only an individual sometimes achieves something in secret; only when it has been achieved do the others find out about it; nobody knows how it happened. So there is nothing in common, we meet here and there in the waiting room, but there is little discussion. Superstitious opinions have existed for a long time and literally multiply by themselves.' 'I saw the gentlemen there in the waiting room,' said K., 'their waiting seemed so useless to me.' 'Waiting is not useless,' he said Kaufmann, “Only independent intervention is useless. I already said that besides this one I have five lawyers. One should think—I believed it myself at first—that now I could leave the matter entirely to them. But that would be completely wrong. I can leave them to them less than if I only had one. You don't understand that?"" ""No,"" said K. and put his hand on the businessman's hand to stop him from speaking too quickly, ""I would just like to ask you to speak a little more slowly, it is but nothing but very important things for me, and I can't really follow you."" ""It's good that you remind me,"" said the merchant, ""you're a newcomer, a young man. Your trial is six months old, isn't it? Yes, I've heard of it. Such a young process! But I've thought these things through countless times, they're the most natural thing in the world for me."" ""You're probably glad your case is so far advanced?"" asked K., not wanting to ask the question directly, like the merchant's affairs stand. But he didn't get a clear answer either. ""Yes, I pushed my case forward for five years,"" said the merchant, bowing his head, ""it's no small achievement."" Then he was silent for a while. K. listened to see if Leni wasn't coming. On the one hand he didn't want her to come, because he still had a lot to ask and he didn't want Leni to meet him in this confidential conversation with the merchant, on the other hand he was annoyed that she stayed with the lawyer for so long despite his presence. much longer than it took to serve the soup. 'I remember the time clearly,' the businessman began again, and K. was immediately full of attention, 'when my case was about as old as yours is now. I only had this lawyer at the time, but I wasn't very happy with him.' I can find out everything here, thought K. and nodded his head vigorously, as if by doing so he could encourage the businessman to tell him everything he needed to know. ""My lawsuit,"" the merchant continued, ""didn't go forward, there were investigations, I went to everyone, collected material, filed all my business books in court, which, as I found out later, wasn't even necessary, I kept running to the lawyer, he also brought in various petitions -' 'Different petitions?' asked K. 'Yes, of course,' said the businessman. 'That's very important to me,' said K., 'in my case he's still working on the first entry. He hasn't done anything yet. I see now that he's neglecting me shamefully.' 'There can be various legitimate reasons why the submission isn't ready yet,' said the merchant. 'By the way, my submissions later turned out to be quite worthless. I even read one myself through the courtesy of a court official. Although it was learned, it was actually meaningless. Above all, a great deal of Latin, which I do not understand, then pages and pages of general appeals to the court, then flattery for specific individual officials who were not named, but which an insider had to guess at least, then the lawyer's self-praise, which he referred to as downright canine sages humiliated before the court, and finally investigations of old-time legal cases, which should be like mine. As far as I could follow, however, these investigations were carried out very carefully. I don't want to pass any judgment on the lawyer's work with all of this either, and the petition I read was only one of several, but in any case, and I want to talk about that now, I couldn't see any progress in my trial at the time. ""What kind of progress do you want to see?"" asked K. ""You're asking a very sensible question,"" said the merchant, smiling, ""one can only rarely see progress in this process. But I didn't know that then. I'm a businessman and I was even more so then than I am today. I wanted tangible progress, the whole thing should come to an end or at least take a real ascent. Instead, there were only interrogations, most of which had the same content; I had the answers ready like a litany; several times a week court messengers came to my shop, my home, or wherever else they might find me; That was of course disturbing (today it is much better in this respect at least, the telephone call is much less disturbing), rumors of my trial also began to spread among my business friends, but especially among my relatives, so there was damage from everyone Pages, but not the slightest sign indicated that even the first trial would be held any time soon. So I went to the lawyer and complained. Although he gave me long explanations, he decidedly refused to do anything in my interest, nobody has any influence on the determination of the hearing, to insist on it in a petition - as I demanded - was simply outrageous and would both me and him spoil. I thought: what this lawyer doesn't want or can't do, someone else will want and be able to do. So I looked around for other lawyers. I want to get straight to the point: no one has demanded or enforced the setting of the main hearing, it is really impossible, albeit with a reservation that I will speak about later, so this lawyer did not deceive me on this point; but otherwise I had no regrets about turning to other lawyers. You must have heard from Dr. Huld have also heard a lot about the petty lawyers, he probably portrayed them as very contemptible, and they really are. However, when he talks about them and compares himself and his colleagues to them, he always makes a small mistake, which I would also like to draw your attention to in passing. He then always called the lawyers in his circle the 'great lawyers' to distinguish them. That's wrong, of course everyone can call themselves 'great' if they like, but in this case only court usage decides. According to this, in addition to the petty lawyers, there are small and large lawyers. This lawyer and his colleagues, however, are only the small lawyers, but the great lawyers, of whom I have only heard and never seen, rank incomparably higher than the small lawyers than these are above the despised crooks."" ""The great lawyers ?"" asked K. ""Who are they? How do you get to them?' 'So you've never heard of them,' said the merchant. 'There is hardly a defendant who, after hearing about them, would not dream of them for a while. Don't be tempted to do so. I don't know who the great lawyers are, and I don't think you can get to them. I don't know of any case where it can be said with certainty that they intervened. Some they defend, but you can't do it by your own will, they only defend the one they want to defend. But the matter they take on must have gotten beyond the low court. Besides, it's better not to think about them, because otherwise the discussions with the other lawyers, their advice and help seem so disgusting and useless, I've experienced it myself that one prefers to throw everything away, oneself at home go to bed and didn't want to hear from me anymore. But of course that would be the stupidest thing, and you wouldn’t have a long rest in bed either.” “So you weren’t thinking about the great lawyers then?” asked K. “Not for long,” said the businessman and smiled again, “you can forget completely unfortunately she doesn't, especially the night is favorable to such thoughts. But back then I wanted immediate success, so I went to the shysters.«","K. turned around; the moment the merchant noticed, he began to rise. “Don’t get up,” said K., and drew a chair up beside him. “You’re an old client of the lawyer?” asked K. “Yes,” said the merchant, “a very old client.” “How many years has he been representing you then?” asked K. “I don’t know in what sense you mean that,” said the merchant, “he’s been representing me in my business affairs —I’m a grain dealer—ever since I took over the firm, for about twenty years now, and in my own trial, to which you’re no doubt alluding, he’s represented me right from the start as well, for more than five years now.” “Yes, much longer than five years,” he went on to add, and pulled out an old wallet, “ I’ve written it all down here; if you wish I can give you the exact dates. It’s hard to keep track of it all. No doubt my trial has been going on much longer than that; it began shortly after the death of my wife and that was more than five and a half years ago.” K. drew nearer to him. “So the lawyer handles ordinary legal affairs as well?” he asked. This alliance of the court with jurisprudence seemed to K. unusually comforting. “Of course,” said the merchant, and then whispered to K.: “They say he’s even better in legal affairs than he is in the others.” But then he seemed to regret his words; he placed a hand on K.’s shoulder and said: “Please don’t betray me.” K. patted him comfortingly on the thigh and said: “No, I’m no traitor.” “He’s vindictive, you see,” said the merchant. “Surely he wouldn’t do anything to such a faithful client,” said K. “Oh, yes he would,” said the merchant, “when he’s upset he draws no distinctions, and what’s more I’m not really faithful to him.” “What do you mean?” K. asked. “Should I confide in you?” the merchant asked doubtfully. “I believe you may,” said K. “Well,” said the merchant, “I’ll confide it in part, but you have to tell me a secret too, so that we both have something to hold over the other with regard to the lawyer.” “You’re certainly cautious,” said K., “but I’ll tell you a secret that will put you entirely at ease. So, in what way are you unfaithful to the lawyer?” “Well,” said the merchant hesitantly, in a tone as if he were confessing something dishonorable, “I have other lawyers besides him.” “That’s really nothing very bad,” said K., a little disappointed. “Yes it is, here,” said the merchant, still breathing heavily after his confession, but gaining confidence from K.’s remark. “It’s not allowed. And the last thing you’re allowed to do is take on shysters in addition to one designated as a lawyer. And that’s just what I’ve done; in addition to him I have five shysters.” “Five!” K. exclaimed, astonished above all by the number; “five lawyers besides him?” The merchant nodded: “I’m negotiating with a sixth right now.” “But why do you need so many lawyers,” asked K. “I need them all,” said the merchant. “Won’t you tell me why?” asked K. “Gladly,” said the merchant. “First of all I don’t want to lose my trial, that goes without saying. So I mustn’t overlook anything that might be of use; even if there’s only a slight hope in a given instance that it might be of use, I still don’t dare discard it. So I’ve spent everything I have on my trial. For example, I’ve withdrawn all my capital from the business; my firm’s offices used to almost fill an entire floor; now one small room in the back suffices, where I work with an apprentice. Of course this decline resulted not only from a withdrawal of funds, but even more from the withdrawal of my energy. If you’re trying to work on your trial, you have little time for anything else.” “So you deal directly with the court yourself?” asked K. “I’d like to know more about that.” “There’s not much to tell,” said the merchant, “I tried it at first, but soon gave it up. It’s too exhausting, with too few results. At any rate I found I just couldn’t work there and deal with them myself. Just sitting and waiting is a major strain. You know yourself how stuffy it is in the offices.” “How do you know I was there?” asked K. “I was in the waiting room when you passed through.” “What a coincidence!” cried K., carried away and completely forgetting how ridiculous the merchant had once seemed. “So you saw me! You were in the waiting room when I passed through. Yes, I did pass through there once.” “It’s not that great a coincidence,” said the merchant, “I’m there practically every day.” “I’ll probably have to go there fairly often now,” said K., “ but I doubt I’ll be received as respectfully as I was back then. Everyone stood up. They probably thought I was a judge.” “No,” said the merchant, “we were greeting the court usher. We knew you were a defendant. News like that travels fast.” “So you already knew that,” said K., “then my behavior may have struck you as arrogant. Didn’t anyone mention it?” “No,” said the merchant, “on the contrary. But that’s all nonsense.” “What sort of nonsense?” asked K. “Why do you ask?” the merchant said irritably, “You don’t seem to know the people there and might take it wrong. You have to realize that a great number of things are discussed in these proceedings that the mind just can’t deal with, people are simply too tired and distracted, and by way of compensation they resort to superstition. I’m talking about the others, but I’m no better. One such superstition, for example, is that many people believe they can predict the outcome of the trial from the face of the defendant, and in particular from the lines of his lips. Now these people claimed that according to your lips, you were certain to be convicted soon. I repeat, it’s a ridiculous superstition, and completely disproved in a majority of cases, but when you live in such company, it’s difficult to avoid these beliefs. Just think how strong the effect of such a superstition can be. You spoke to someone there, didn’t you? But he could hardly answer you. Of course there are all sorts of reasons for getting confused there, but one was the sight of your lips. He told us later he thought he’d seen the sign of his own conviction on your lips as well.” “My lips?” asked K., taking out a pocket mirror and regarding his face. “I can’t see anything unusual about my lips. Can you?” “Neither can I,” said the merchant, “absolutely nothing at all.” “These people are so superstitious!” K. exclaimed. “Didn’t I tell you so?” asked the merchant. “Do they spend so much time together then, exchanging opinions?” said K. “I’ve avoided them totally up to now.” “They generally don’t spend much time together,” said the merchant, “they couldn’t, there are too many of them. And they don’t have many interests in common. When a group occasionally begin to believe they share some common interest, it soon proves a delusion. Group action is entirely ineffective against the court. Each case is investigated on its own merits; the court is, after all, extremely meticulous. So group action is entirely ineffective, it’s only individuals who sometimes manage something in secret; only when it’s been achieved do others learn of it; no one knows how it happened. So there’s no sense of community; people meet now and then in the waiting room, but there’s not much conversation there. These superstitions have been around for ages, and multiply totally on their own.” “I saw the gentlemen there in the waiting room,” said K., “their waiting seemed to me so pointless.” “Waiting isn’t pointless,” said the merchant, “the only thing that ’s pointless is independent action. As I mentioned, I have five lawyers besides this one. One would think—and I thought so myself at first—that I could now turn the case over to them completely. But that’s totally mistaken. I’m even less able to turn it over to them than if I had only one. You probably don’t understand why?” “No,” said K., placing his hand soothingly on that of the merchant to slow down his all too rapid speech, “I just wonder if you could speak a little more slowly; all of these things are very important to me, and I can’t really follow you.” “I’m glad you reminded me,” said the merchant, “you’re a newcomer, after all, a mere youth. Your trial is six months old, right? Yes, I’ve heard about it. Such a young trial! I, on the other hand, have thought these things through innumerable times; to me they’re the most self-evident matters in the world.” “You’re no doubt happy your trial’s so far along?” K. inquired; he didn’t want to ask straight out how the merchant’s case was coming. But he didn’t receive a straightforward answer either. “Yes, I’ve been pushing my trial along for five years,” said the merchant, bowing his head, “that’s no small accomplishment.” Then he fell silent for a moment. K. listened to hear if Leni was returning yet. On the one hand he didn’t want her to come, for he still had many questions to ask and didn’t want Leni to discover him in intimate conversation with the merchant; on the other hand, he was annoyed that in spite of his presence, she was remaining so long with the lawyer, much longer than necessary to hand him his soup. “I still remember clearly,” the merchant continued, and K. was immediately all ears, “when my trial was about as old as yours is now. Back then I had only this one lawyer, but I wasn’t particularly satisfied with him.” “I’m finding out everything here,” thought K., and nodded vigorously as if to encourage the merchant to tell him everything worth knowing. “My trial,” the merchant went on, “was getting nowhere; inquiries were taking place all right, and I attended every one of them, gathered material, and turned all my business records over to the court, which I discovered later wasn’t even necessary; I kept running to my lawyer, and he was submitting various petitions as well—” “Various petitions?” asked K. “Yes, of course,” said the merchant. “That’s very important to me,” said K., “in my case he’s still preparing the first petition. He hasn’t done anything yet. I see now that he’s neglecting me shamefully.” “There may be various valid reasons why the petition isn’t finished yet,” said the merchant. “And my petitions, by the way, later proved to be entirely worthless. I even read one of them myself through the good graces of a court clerk. It was scholarly all right, but in fact contained nothing of substance. A lot of Latin for the most part, which I don’t understand, then several pages of general appeals to the court, then flattery of certain individual officials, who weren’t in fact named but could have been deduced by anyone familiar with the court, then self-praise on the lawyer’s part, combined with an almost canine servility before the court, and finally analyses of legal cases from ancient times that were supposedly similar to mine. Of course these analyses, so far as I could tell, were very carefully done. I don’t mean to judge the lawyer’s work in saying all this, and the petition I read was only one of many; nevertheless, and this is what I want to get to, I couldn’t see that my trial was making any progress.” “What sort of progress did you expect to see?” asked K. “That’s a very sensible question,” said the merchant with a smile, “you seldom see any sort of progress at all in such proceedings. But I didn’t know that then. I’m a merchant, and was much more of one then than I am today; I wanted to see tangible results; I expected the whole matter to be moving toward a conclusion, or at least to advance at a steady pace. Instead there were nothing but hearings, most of which went over the same old material; I already had the answers prepared like a litany; several times a week, court messengers would come to my firm or to my lodgings, or wherever they could find me; that was disturbing of course (things are much better these days, at least in that respect; a telephone call causes far less disruption), and rumors about my trial were starting to spread, among my colleagues in particular, but among my relatives as well, so that damage was being done on all sides, without the least indication that even the first session of the trial would take place anytime soon. So I went to my lawyer and complained. He offered long explanations of course, but steadfastly refused to take the action I desired; no one could influence the setting of a firm date for the trial, to make such a demand in a petition—as I was asking—was simply unheard of and would ruin both him and me. I thought to myself: what this lawyer either can’t or won’t do, some other lawyer can and will. So I looked around for other lawyers. Let me say right away: not one of them asked for or succeeded in getting a firm date set for the main hearing; it turns out that, with one reservation, which I’ll come to, it’s truly impossible to do so; on this point the lawyer had not deceived me; for the rest however I had no regrets about having turned to other lawyers. You’ve probably already heard something about shysters from Dr. Huld; no doubt he portrayed them as contemptible, and in fact they are. Of course whenever he talks about them, and compares himself and his colleagues with them, a small error always creeps in, which I wish simply to point out to you in passing. He always refers to his own circle of lawyers, by way of contrast, as the ‘great’ lawyers. That’s inaccurate; anyone can call himself ‘great’ if he wants to, of course, but in this case court usage is decisive. According to that there are, in addition to the shysters, both petty lawyers and great lawyers. This lawyer and his colleagues are only petty lawyers, however; the great lawyers, whom I’ve merely heard of but never seen, stand incomparably higher in rank above the petty lawyers than those do over the despised shysters.” “The great lawyers?” asked K. “Who are they then? How can they be contacted?” “So you’ve never heard of them,” said the merchant. “There’s scarcely a single defendant who doesn’t dream of them for a time after learning about them. Don’t fall prey to that temptation. I don’t know who the great lawyers are, and it’s probably impossible to contact them. I don’t know of a single case in which they can be said with certainty to have intervened. They do defend some people, but it’s not possible to arrange that on one’s own, they only defend those they wish to defend. The cases they take on, however, have no doubt already advanced beyond the lower court. On the whole it’s best not to think about them, otherwise consultations with other lawyers, their advice and assistance, all seem so disgusting and useless that, as I myself know from experience, what you would like most to do would be to pitch the whole affair, go home to bed, and hear nothing more of it. But of course that would be equally stupid; nor would you be left at peace in bed for long.” “So you didn’t think about the great lawyers back then?” asked K. “Not for long,” said the merchant, and smiled again, “you can never quite forget them, unfortunately, nights are particularly conducive to such thoughts. But back then I wanted immediate results, so I went to the shysters.” “Look at the two of you sitting together,” cried Leni, who had returned with the bowl and paused at the door.","K. turned toward the man, who immediately gave a start as if to jump to his feet. ""Keep your seat,"" said K., drawing a chair up beside him. ""You're an old client of the lawyer's, aren't you?"" ""Yes,"" said the tradesman, ""a very old client."" ""How long has he been in charge of your affairs?"" asked K. ""I don't quite know what affairs you mean,"" said the tradesman; ""in my business affairs -- I'm a grain dealer -- the lawyer has been my representative since the very beginning, that must be for the past twenty years, and in my private case, which is probably what you are thinking of, he has been my lawyer also from the beginning, which is more than five years ago. Yes, well over five years now,"" he confirmed, drawing out an old pocketbook. ""I have it all written down here. I can give you the exact dates if you like. It's difficult to keep them in one's head. My case probably goes back further than I said, it began just after my wife's death, certainly more than five and a half years ago."" K. moved his chair closer to the man. "" So the lawyer has an ordinary practice as well ?"" he asked. This alliance between Court and jurisprudence seemed to him uncommonly reassuring. ""Of course,"" said the tradesman, adding in a whisper: ""They even say that he's better at ordinary law than at the other kind. "" Then apparently he regretted having ventured so far, for he laid a hand on K.'s shoulder and said: ""Don't give me away, I implore you."" K. patted him soothingly on the thigh and said: ""No, I'm not an informer."" ""He's vindictive, you see,"" said Block. ""Surely he wouldn't harm a faithful client like you?"" said K. ""Oh, yes,"" said Block, ""once he's roused he draws no distinctions; besides, I'm not really faithful to him."" ""How is that?"" asked K. "" Perhaps I oughtn't to tell you,"" said Block doubtfully. ""I think you can risk it,"" said K. ""Well,"" said Block, ""I'll tell you a certain amount, but in your turn you must tell me one of your secrets, so that we each have a hold over the other."" ""You're very cautious,"" said K., ""but I'll entrust you with a secret that will allay all your suspicions. In what way, then, are you unfaithful to the lawyer?"" ""Well,"" said the tradesman hesitatingly, as if confessing something dishonorable, ""I have other lawyers as well as him."" ""That's nothing very dreadful,"" said K., somewhat disappointed. ""It's supposed to be,"" said the tradesman, who had not breathed freely since making his confession, but now gained a little confidence from K.'s rejoinder. ""It's not allowed. And least of all is it allowed to consult pettifogging lawyers when one is the client of an official lawyer. And that's exactly what I've been doing , I have five pettifogging lawyers besides him."" ""Five !"" cried K., amazed at the mere number, ""five lawyers besides this one?"" Block nodded: ""I'm even negotiating with a sixth one."" ""But what do you need so many for? "" asked K. ""I need every one of them,"" said Block. ""Tell me why, will you?"" asked K. ""With pleasure,"" said the tradesman. ""To begin with, I don't want to lose my case, as you can well understand. And so I daren't ignore anything that might help me; if there's even the faintest hope of an advantage for myself I daren't reject it. That's why I've spent every penny I possess on this case of mine. For instance, I've drawn all the money out of my business; my business offices once filled nearly a whole floor of the building where now I need only a small back room and an apprentice. Of course it's not only the withdrawal of my money that has brought the business down, but the withdrawal of my energies. When you're trying to do anything you can to help your case along you haven't much energy to spare for other things."" ""So you've been working on your own behalf as well,"" interrupted K., "" that's precisely what I wanted to ask you about."" ""There's not much to tell you,"" said the tradesman. ""I did try my hand at it in the beginning, but I soon had to give it up. It's too exhausting, and the results are disappointing. Merely attending the Court to keep an eye on things proved too much, for me, at least. It makes you feel limp even to sit about and wait your turn. But you know yourself what the air's like."" ""How do you know I was ever up there?"" asked K. ""I happened to be in the lobby when you were passing through."" ""What a coincidence 1"" cried K., quite carried away and completely forgetting the ridiculous figure the tradesman had cut in his estimation. ""So you saw me! You were in the lobby when 31 passed through. Yes, I did pass through the lobby once."" ""It's not such a coincidence as all that,"" said the tradesman, ""I'm up there nearly every day."" ""I'm likely to be up there, too, often enough after this,"" said K., ""only I can hardly expect to be received with such honor as on that occasion. Everyone stood up. I suppose they took me for a Judge."" ""No,"" said the tradesman, ""it was the usher we stood up for. We knew you were an accused man. News of that kind spreads rapidly."" ""So you knew that already,"" commented K., ""then perhaps you thought me somewhat high and mighty. Did no one comment on it?"" ""Not unfavorably,"" said the tradesman. ""But it's all nonsense."" ""What's nonsense ?"" asked K. ""Why do you insist on asking?"" said the tradesman, irritably. "" Apparently you don't know the people there yet and you might take it up wrongly. You must remember that in these proceedings things are always coming up for discussion that are simply beyond reason, people are too tired and distracted to think and so they take refuge in superstition. I'm as bad as anyone myself. And one of the superstitions is that you're supposed to tell from a man's face, especially the line of his lips, how his case is going to turn out. Well, people declared that judging from the expression of your lips you would be found guilty, and in the near future too. I tell you, it's a silly superstition and in most cases completely belied by the facts, but if you live among these people it's difficult to escape the prevailing opinion. You can't imagine what a strong effect such superstitions have. You spoke to a man up there, didn't you? And he could hardly utter a word in answer. Of course there's many a reason for being bewildered up there, but one of the reasons why he couldn't bring out an answer was the shock he got from looking at your lips. He said afterwards that he saw on your lips the sign of his own condemnation."" ""On my lips?"" asked K., taking out a pocket mirror and studying them. ""I can't see anything peculiar about my lips. Do you?"" ""I don't either,"" said the tradesman, ""not in the least."" ""How superstitious these people are!"" cried K. "" Didn't I tell you so ?"" asked the other. ""Do they meet each other so frequently, then, and exchange all these ideas?"" queried K., ""I've never had anything to do with them myself."" ""As a rule they don't mix much,"" said the tradesman, ""it would be hardly possible , there are too many of them. Besides, they have few interests in common. Occasionally a group believes it has found a common interest, but it soon finds out its mistake. Combined action against the Court is impossible. Each, case is judged on its own merits, the Court is very conscientious about that, and so common action is out of the question. An individual here and there may score a point in secret, but no one hears it until afterwards, no one knows how it has been done. So there's no real community, people come across each other in the lobbies, but there's not much conversation. The superstitious beliefs are an old tradition and increase automatically."" ""I saw all the people in the lobby,"" remarked K., ""and thought how pointless it was for them to be hanging about."" ""It's not pointless at all,"" said Block, ""the only pointless thing is to try taking independent action. As I told you, I have five lawyers besides this one. You might think -- as I did once -- that I could safely wash my hands of the case. But you would be wrong. I have to watch it more carefully than if I had only one lawyer. I suppose you don't understand that?"" ""No,"" said K., laying his hand appealingly on the other's to keep him from talking so fast, ""I would only like to beg you to apeak more slowly, all these things are extremely important to me and I can't follow so quickly."" ""I'm glad you reminded me,"" said the tradesman; ""of course you're a newcomer, you're young in the matter. Your case is six months old, isn't it? Yes, I've heard about it. An infant of a case! But I've had to think these things out I don't know how many times, they've become a second nature to me."" ""I suppose you're thankful to think that your case is so far advanced,"" asked K., not liking to make a direct inquiry how the tradesman's case stood. But he received no direct answer either. "" Yes, I've carried my burden for five long years,"" said Block, drooping his head, ""it's no small achievement, that. "" Then he sat silent for a little. K. listened to hear if Leni were coming back. On the one band he did not want her to come in just then, for he had many questions still to ask, nor did he want her to find him so deep in intimate conversation with the tradesman, but on the other hand he was annoyed because she was spending so much time with the lawyer while he was in the house, much more time than was needed for handing over a bowl of soup. ""I can still remember exactly,"" the tradesman began again, and K. was at once all attention, ""the days when my case was at much the same stage as yours is now. I had only this lawyer then, and I wasn't particularly satisfied with him."" ""Now I'm going to find out everything,"" thought K., nodding his head eagerly, as if that would encourage the tradesman to bring out all the right information. "" My case,"" Block continued, ""wasn't making any progress; there were of course interrogations, and I attended every one of them, I collected evidence, I even laid all my account books before the Court, which wasn't necessary at all, as I discovered later. I kept running to the lawyer, he presented various petitions --"" ""Various petitions? "" asked K. "" Yes, certainly,"" said Block. ""That's an important point for me,"" said K., ""for in my case he's still working on the first petition. He's done nothing at all yet. Now I see how scandalously he's neglecting me."" ""There might be several excellent reasons why the petition isn't ready yet,"" said Block. ""Let me tell you that my petitions turned out later to be quite worthless. I even had a look at one of them, thanks to the kindness of a Court official. It was very learned but it said nothing of any consequence. Crammed with Latin in the first place, which I don't understand, and then whole pages of general appeals to the Court, then flattering references to particular officials, who weren't actually named but were easy enough for anyone versed in these matters to recognize, then self-praise of the lawyer himself, in the course of which he addressed the Court with a crawling humility, ending up with an analysis of various cases from ancient times that were supposed to resemble mine. I must say that this analysis, in so far as I could follow it, was very careful and thorough. You mustn't think that I'm passing judgment on the lawyer's work; that petition, after all, was only one of many; but at any rate, and this is what I'm coming to, I couldn't see that my case was making any progress."" ""What kind of progress did you expect to see?"" asked K. ""A good question,"" said the tradesman with a smile, ""it's very rarely that progress in these cases is visible at all. But I didn't know that then. I'm a businessman, and I was much more of a businessman then than now, I wanted to see palpable results, the whole negotiation should be coming to a finish, I thought, or taking a regular upward course. Instead of that there were only ceremonial interviews, one after another, mostly of the same tenor, where I could reel off the responses like a litany; several times a week Court messengers came to my place of business or to my house or wherever I was to be found, and that, of course, was a nuisance (today I'm much better off in that respect, for telephone calls bother me less) ; and besides all that, rumors about my case began to spread among my business friends, but especially among my relatives, so that I was being injured on all sides without the slightest sign of any intention on the part of the Court to begin legal proceedings in the near future. So I went to the lawyer and made my complaint. He treated me to a lengthy explanation, but refused utterly to take action in my sense of the word, saying that nobody could influence the Court to appoint a day for hearing a case, and that to urge anything of the kind in a petition -- as I wanted him to do -- was simply unheard of and would only ruin myself and him. I thought: what this lawyer won't or can't do, another will and can. So I looked round for other lawyers. I may as well tell you now that not one of them ever prayed the Court to fix a day for the trial of my case, or managed to obtain such a trial; it is really an impossibility -- with one qualification that I shall explain later -- and the lawyer had not misled me there, although I found no cause for regretting having called in the other lawyers. I suppose Dr. Huld has told you plenty of things about the pettifogging lawyers, he has probably described them as contemptible creatures, and so they are, in a sense. All the same, in speaking of them and contrasting himself and his colleagues with them he always makes a small mistake, which I may as well call your attention to in passing. He always refers to the lawyers of his own circle as the `great lawyers,' by way of contrast. Now that's untrue; any man can call himself `great,' of course, if he pleases, but in this matter the Court tradition must decide. And according to the Court tradition, which recognizes both small and great lawyers outside the hole-and-corner lawyers, our lawyer and his colleagues rank only among the small lawyers, while the really great lawyers, whom I have merely heard of and never seen, stand as high above the small lawyers as these above the despised pettifogging lawyers."" ""The really great lawyers ?"" asked K. ""Who are they, then? How does one get at them?"" ""So you've never heard of them,"" said Block. ""There's hardly an accused man who doesn't spend some time dreaming of them after hearing about them. Don't you give way to that temptation. I have no idea who the great lawyers are and I don't believe they can be got at. I know of no single instance in which it could be definitely asserted that they had intervened. They do defend certain cases, but one cannot achieve that oneself. They only defend those whom they wish to defend, and they never take action, I should think, until the case is already beyond the province of the lower Court. In fact, it's better to put them out of one's mind altogether, or else one finds interviews with ordinary lawyers so stale and stupid, with their niggling counsels and proposals -- I have experienced it myself -- that one feels like throwing the whole thing up and taking to bed with one's face to the wall. And of course that would be stupider still, for even in bed one wouldn't find peace."" ""So you didn't entertain the thought of going to the great lawyers?"" asked K. ""Not for long,"" said Block, smiling again; ""unfortunately one can never quite forget about them, especially during the night. But at that time I was looking for immediate results, and so I went to the pettifogging lawyers."" ""How close you've got!"" cried Leni, who had come back with the soup bowl and was standing in the door- way.","K. turned round, the businessman hardly noticed it as he was about to stand up. “Stay where you are,” said K. and pulled up a chair beside him. “Have you been a client of the lawyer's for a long time?” asked K. “Yes,” said the businessman, “a very long time.” “How many years has he been representing you so far, then?” asked K. “I don't know how you mean,” said the businessman, “he's been my business lawyer— I buy and sell cereals—he's been my business lawyer since I took the business over, and that's about twenty years now, but perhaps you mean my own trial and he's been representing me in that since it started, and that's been more than five years. Yes, well over five years,” he then added, pulling out an old briefcase, “I've got everything written down; I can tell you the exact dates if you like. It's so hard to remember everything. Probably, my trial's been going on much longer than that, it started soon after the death of my wife, and that's been more than five and a half years now.” K. moved in closer to him. “So the lawyer takes on ordinary legal business, does he?” he asked. This combination of criminal and commercial business seemed surprisingly reassuring for K. “Oh yes,” said the businessman, and then he whispered, “They even say he's more efficient in jurisprudence than he is in other matters.” But then he seemed to regret saying this, and he laid a hand on K.'s shoulder and said, “Please don't betray me to him, will you.” K. patted his thigh to reassure him and said, “No, I don't betray people.” “He can be so vindictive, you see,” said the businessman. “I'm sure he won't do anything against such a faithful client as you,” said K. “Oh, he might do,” said the businessman, “when he gets cross it doesn't matter who it is, and anyway, I'm not really faithful to him.” “How's that then?” asked K. “I'm not sure I should tell you about it,” said the businessman hesitantly. “I think it'll be alright,” said K. “Well then,” said the businessman, “I'll tell you about some of it, but you'll have to tell me a secret too, then we can support each other with the lawyer.” “You are very careful,” said K., “but I'll tell you a secret that will set your mind completely at ease. Now tell me, in what way have you been unfaithful to the lawyer?” “I've ...” said the businessman hesitantly, and in a tone as if he were confessing something dishonourable, “I've taken on other lawyers besides him.” “That's not so serious,” said K., a little disappointed. “It is, here,” said the businessman, who had had some difficulty breathing since making his confession but who now, after hearing K.'s comment, began to feel more trust for him. “That's not allowed. And it's allowed least of all to take on petty lawyers when you've already got a proper one. And that's just what I have done, besides him I've got five petty lawyers.” “Five!” exclaimed K., astonished at this number, “Five lawyers besides this one?” The businessman nodded. “I'm even negotiating with a sixth one.” “But why do you need so many lawyers?” asked K. “I need all of them,” said the businessman. “Would you mind explaining that to me?” asked K. “I'd be glad to,” said the businessman. “Most of all, I don't want to lose my case, well that's obvious. So that means I mustn't neglect anything that might be of use to me; even if there's very little hope of a particular thing being of any use I can't just throw it away. So everything I have I've put to use in my case. I've taken all the money out of my business, for example, the offices for my business used to occupy nearly a whole floor, but now all I need is a little room at the back where I work with one apprentice. It wasn't just using up the money that caused the difficulty, of course, it was much more to do with me not working at the business as much as I used to. If you want to do something about your trial you don't have much time for anything else.” “So you're also working at the court yourself?” asked K. “That's just what I want to learn more about.” “I can't tell you very much about that,” said the businessman, “at first I tried to do that too but I soon had to give it up again. It wears you out too much, and it's really not much use. And it turned out to be quite impossible to work there yourself and to negotiate, at least for me it was. It's a heavy strain there just sitting and waiting. You know yourself what the air is like in those offices.” “How do you know I've been there, then?” asked K. “I was in the waiting room myself when you went through.” “What a coincidence that is!” exclaimed K., totally engrossed and forgetting how ridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier. “So you saw me! You were in the waiting room when I went through. Yes, I did go through it one time.” “It isn't such a big coincidence,” said the businessman, “I'm there nearly every day.” “I expect I'll have to go there quite often myself now,” said K., “although I can hardly expect to be shown the same respect as I was then. They all stood up for me. They must have thought I was a judge.” “No,” said the businessman, “we were greeting the servant of the court. We knew you were a defendant. That sort of news spreads very quickly.” “So you already knew about that,” said K., “the way I behaved must have seemed very arrogant to you. Did you criticise me for it afterwards?” “No,” said the businessman, “quite the opposite. That was just stupidity.” “What do you mean, 'stupidity'?” asked K. “Why are you asking about it?” said the businessman in some irritation. “You still don't seem to know the people there and you might take it wrong. Don't forget in proceedings like this there are always lots of different things coming up to talk about, things that you just can't understand with reason alone, you just get too tired and distracted for most things and so, instead, people rely on superstition. I'm talking about the others, but I'm no better myself. One of these superstitions, for example, is that you can learn a lot about the outcome of a defendant's case by looking at his face, especially the shape of his lips. There are lots who believe that, and they said they could see from the shape of your lips that you'd definitely be found guilty very soon. I repeat that all this is just a ridiculous superstition, and in most cases it's completely disproved by the facts, but when you live in that society it's hard to hold yourself back from beliefs like that. Just think how much effect that superstition can have. You spoke to one of them there, didn't you? He was hardly able to give you an answer. There are lots of things there that can make you confused, of course, but one of them, for him, was the appearance of your lips. He told us all later he thought he could see something in your lips that meant he'd be convicted himself.” “On my lips?” asked K., pulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself. “I can see nothing special about my lips. Can you?” “Nor can I,” said the businessman, “nothing at all.” “These people are so superstitious!” exclaimed K. “Isn't that what I just told you?” asked the businessman. “Do you then have that much contact with each other, exchanging each other's opinions?” said K. “I've kept myself completely apart so far.” “They don't normally have much contact with each other,” said the businessman, “that would be impossible, there are so many of them. And they don't have much in common either. If a group of them ever thinks they have found something in common it soon turns out they were mistaken. There's nothing you can do as a group where the court's concerned. Each case is examined separately, the court is very painstaking. So there's nothing to be achieved by forming into a group, only sometimes an individual will achieve something in secret; and it's only when that's been done the others learn about it; nobody knows how it was done. So there's no sense of togetherness , you meet people now and then in the waiting rooms, but we don't talk much there. The superstitious beliefs were established a long time ago and they spread all by themselves.” “I saw those gentlemen in the waiting room,” said K., “it seemed so pointless for them to be waiting in that way.” “Waiting is not pointless,” said the businessman, “it's only pointless if you try and interfere yourself. I told you just now I've got five lawyers besides this one. You might think—I thought it myself at first—you might think I could leave the whole thing entirely up to them now. That would be entirely wrong. I can leave it up to them less than when I had just the one. Maybe you don't understand that, do you?” “No,” said K., and to slow the businessman down, who had been speaking too fast, he laid his hand on the businessman's to reassure him, “but I'd like just to ask you to speak a little more slowly, these are many very important things for me, and I can't follow exactly what you're saying.” “You're quite right to remind me of that,” said the businessman, “you're new to all this, a junior. Your trial is six months old, isn't it? Yes, I've heard about it. Such a new case! But I've already thought all these things through countless times, to me they're the most obvious things in the world.” “You must be glad your trial has already progressed so far, are you?” asked K., he did not wish to ask directly how the businessman's affairs stood, but received no clear answer anyway. “Yes, I've been working at my trial for five years now,” said the businessman as his head sank, “that's no small achievement.” Then he was silent for a while. K. listened to hear whether Leni was on her way back. On the one hand he did not want her to come back too soon as he still had many questions to ask and did not want her to find him in this intimate discussion with the businessman, but on the other hand it irritated him that she stayed so long with the lawyer when K. was there, much longer than she needed to give him his soup. “I still remember it exactly,” the businessman began again, and K. immediately gave him his full attention, “when my case was as old as yours is now. I only had this one lawyer at that time but I wasn't very satisfied with him.” Now I'll find out everything, thought K., nodding vigorously as if he could thereby encourage the businessman to say everything worth knowing. “My case,” the businessman continued, “didn't move on at all, there were some hearings that took place and I went to every one of them, collected materials, handed all my business books to the court —which I later found was entirely unnecessary— I ran back and forth to the lawyer, and he submitted various documents to the court too ...” “Various documents?” asked K. “Yes, that's right,” said the businessman. “That's very important for me,” said K., “in my case he's still working on the first set of documents. He still hasn't done anything. I see now that he's been neglecting me quite disgracefully.” “There can be lots of good reasons why the first documents still aren't ready,” said the businessman, “and anyway, it turned out later on that the ones he submitted for me were entirely worthless. I even read one of them myself, one of the officials at the court was very helpful. It was very learned, but it didn't actually say anything. Most of all, there was lots of Latin, which I can't understand, then pages and pages of general appeals to the court, then lots of flattery for particular officials, they weren't named, these officials, but anyone familiar with the court must have been able to guess who they were, then there was self-praise by the lawyer where he humiliated himself to the court in a way that was downright dog-like, and then endless investigations of cases from the past which were supposed to be similar to mine. Although, as far as I was able to follow them, these investigations had been carried out very carefully. Now, I don't mean to criticise the lawyer's work with all of this, and the document I read was only one of many, but even so, and this is something I will say, at that time I couldn't see any progress in my trial at all.” “And what sort of progress had you been hoping for?” asked K. “That's a very sensible question,” said the businessman with a smile, “it's only very rare that you see any progress in these proceedings at all. But I didn't know that then. I'm a businessman, much more in those days than now, I wanted to see some tangible progress, it should have all been moving to some conclusion or at least should have been moving on in some way according to the rules. Instead of which there were just more hearings, and most of them went through the same things anyway; I had all the answers off pat like in a church service; there were messengers from the court coming to me at work several times a week, or they came to me at home or anywhere else they could find me; and that was very disturbing of course (but at least now things are better in that respect, it's much less disturbing when they contact you by telephone), and rumours about my trial even started to spread among some of the people I do business with, and especially my relations, so I was being made to suffer in many different ways but there was still not the slightest sign that even the first hearing would take place soon. So I went to the lawyer and complained about it. He explained it all to me at length, but refused to do anything I asked for, no-one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds, he said, to try and insist on it in any of the documents submitted—like I was asking—was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me. I thought to myself: What this lawyer can't or won't do another lawyer will. So I looked round for other lawyers. And before you say anything: none of them asked for a definite date for the main trial and none of them got one, and anyway, apart form one exception which I'll talk about in a minute, it really is impossible, that's one thing this lawyer didn't mislead me about; but besides, I had no reason to regret turning to other lawyers. Perhaps you've already heard how Dr. Huld talks about the petty lawyers, he probably made them sound very contemptible to you, and he's right , they are contemptible. But when he talks about them and compares them with himself and his colleagues there's a small error running through what he says, and, just for your interest, I'll tell you about it. When he talks about the lawyers he mixes with he sets them apart by calling them the 'great lawyers'. That's wrong, anyone can call himself 'great' if he wants to, of course, but in this case only the usage of the court can make that distinction. You see, the court says that besides the petty lawyers there are also minor lawyers and great lawyers. This one and his colleagues are only minor lawyers, and the difference in rank between them and the great lawyers, who I've only ever heard about and never seen, is incomparably greater than between the minor lawyers and the despised petty lawyers.” “The great lawyers?” asked K. “Who are they then? How do you contact them?” “You've never heard about them, then?” said the businessman. “There's hardly anyone who's been accused who doesn't spend a lot of time dreaming about the great lawyers once he's heard about them. It's best if you don't let yourself be misled in that way. I don't know who the great lawyers are, and there's probably no way of contacting them. I don't know of any case I can talk about with certainty where they've taken any part. They do defend a lot of people, but you can't get hold of them by your own efforts, they only defend those who they want to defend. And I don't suppose they ever take on cases that haven't already got past the lower courts. Anyway, it's best not to think about them, as if you do it makes the discussions with the other lawyers, all their advice and all that they do manage to achieve, seem so unpleasant and useless , I had that experience myself, just wanted to throw everything away and lay at home in bed and hear nothing more about it. But that, of course, would be the stupidest thing you could do, and you wouldn't be left in peace in bed for very long either.” “So you weren't thinking about the great lawyers at that time?” asked K. “Not for very long,” said the businessman, and smiled again, “you can't forget about them entirely, I'm afraid, especially in the night when these thoughts come so easily. But I wanted immediate results in those days, so I went to the petty lawyers.” “Well look at you two sat huddled together!”","K. turned round, the businessman hardly noticed it as he was about to stand up. "" Stay where you are,"" said K. and pulled up a chair beside him. "" Have you been a client of the lawyer's for a long time? "" asked K. "" Yes,"" said the businessman, ""a very long time.""

I can leave it up to them less than when I had just the one. Maybe you don't understand that, do you?"" ""No,"" said K., and to slow the businessman down, who had been speaking too fast, he laid his hand on the businessman's to reassure him, ""but I'd like just to ask you to speak a little more slowly, these are many very important things for me, and I can't follow exactly what you're saying. "" ""You're quite right to remind me of that,"" said the businessman, ""you're new to all this, a junior. Your trial is six months old, isn't it? Yes, I've heard about it. Such a new case! But I've already thought all these things through countless times, to me they're the most obvious things in the world."" ""You must be glad your trial has already progressed so far, are you?"" asked K., he did not wish to ask directly how the businessman's affairs stood, but received no clear answer anyway. "" Yes, I've been working at my trial for five years now,"" said the businessman as his head sank, ""that's no small achievement. "" Then he was silent for a while. K. listened to hear whether Leni was on her way back. On the one hand he did not want her to come back too soon as he still had many questions to ask and did not want her to find him in this intimate discussion with the businessman, but on the other hand it irritated him that she stayed so long with the lawyer when K. was there, much longer than she needed to give him his soup. ""I still remember it exactly,"" the businessman began again, and K. immediately gave him his full attention, ""when my case was as old as yours is now. I only had this one lawyer at that time but I wasn't very satisfied with him. "" Now I'll find out everything, thought K., nodding vigorously as if he could thereby encourage the businessman to say everything worth knowing. ""My case,"" the businessman continued, ""didn't move on at all, there were some hearings that took place and I went to every one of them, collected materials, handed all my business books to the court - which I later found was entirely unnecessary - I ran back and forth to the lawyer, and he submitted various documents to the court too ..."" ""Various documents?"" asked K. "" Yes, that's right,"" said the businessman. ""That's very important for me,"" said K., ""in my case he's still working on the first set of documents. He still hasn't done anything. I see now that he's been neglecting me quite disgracefully."" ""There can be lots of good reasons why the first documents still aren't ready,"" said the businessman, ""and anyway, it turned out later on that the ones he submitted for me were entirely worthless. I even read one of them myself, one of the officials at the court was very helpful. It was very learned, but it didn't actually say anything. Most of all, there was lots of Latin, which I can't understand, then pages and pages of general appeals to the court, then lots of flattery for particular officials, they weren't named, these officials, but anyone familiar with the court must have been able to guess who they were, then there was self-praise by the lawyer where he humiliated himself to the court in a way that was downright dog-like, and then endless investigations of cases from the past which were supposed to be similar to mine. Although, as far as I was able to follow them, these investigations had been carried out very carefully. Now, I don't mean to criticise the lawyer's work with all of this, and the document I read was only one of many, but even so, and this is something I will say, at that time I couldn't see any progress in my trial at all."" ""And what sort of progress had you been hoping for?"" asked K. ""That's a very sensible question,"" said the businessman with a smile, ""it's only very rare that you see any progress in these proceedings at all. But I didn't know that then. I'm a businessman, much more in those days than now, I wanted to see some tangible progress, it should have all been moving to some conclusion or at least should have been moving on in some way according to the rules. Instead of which there were just more hearings, and most of them went through the same things anyway; I had all the answers off pat like in a church service; there were messengers from the court coming to me at work several times a week, or they came to me at home or anywhere else they could find me; and that was very disturbing of course (but at least now things are better in that respect, it's much less disturbing when they contact you by telephone), and rumours about my trial even started to spread among some of the people I do business with, and especially my relations, so I was being made to suffer in many different ways but there was still not the slightest sign that even the first hearing would take place soon. So I went to the lawyer and complained about it. He explained it all to me at length, but refused to do anything I asked for, no-one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds, he said, to try and insist on it in any of the documents submitted - like I was asking - was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me. I thought to myself: What this lawyer can't or won't do another lawyer will. So I looked round for other lawyers. And before you say anything: none of them asked for a definite date for the main trial and none of them got one, and anyway, apart from one exception which I'll talk about in a minute, it really is impossible, that's one thing this lawyer didn't mislead me about; but besides, I had no reason to regret turning to other lawyers. Perhaps you've already heard how Dr. Huld talks about the petty lawyers, he probably made them sound very contemptible to you, and he's right , they are contemptible. But when he talks about them and compares them with himself and his colleagues there's a small error running through what he says, and, just for your interest, I'll tell you about it. When he talks about the lawyers he mixes with he sets them apart by calling them the 'great lawyers'. That's wrong, anyone can call himself 'great' if he wants to, of course, but in this case only the usage of the court can make that distinction. You see, the court says that besides the petty lawyers there are also minor lawyers and great lawyers. This one and his colleagues are only minor lawyers, and the difference in rank between them and the great lawyers, who I've only ever heard about and never seen, is incomparably greater than between the minor lawyers and the despised petty lawyers."" ""The great lawyers?"" asked K. ""Who are they then? How do you contact them?"" ""You've never heard about them, then?"" said the businessman. ""There's hardly anyone who's been accused who doesn't spend a lot of time dreaming about the great lawyers once he's heard about them. It's best if you don't let yourself be misled in that way. I don't know who the great lawyers are, and there's probably no way of contacting them. I don't know of any case I can talk about with certainty where they've taken any part. They do defend a lot of people, but you can't get hold of them by your own efforts, they only defend those who they want to defend. And I don't suppose they ever take on cases that haven't already got past the lower courts. Anyway, it's best not to think about them, as if you do it makes the discussions with the other lawyers, all their advice and all that they do manage to achieve, seem so unpleasant and useless , I had that experience myself, just wanted to throw everything away and lay at home in bed and hear nothing more about it. But that, of course, would be the stupidest thing you could do, and you wouldn't be left in peace in bed for very long either."" ""So you weren't thinking about the great lawyers at that time? "" asked K. ""Not for very long,"" said the businessman, and smiled again, ""you can't forget about them entirely, I'm afraid, especially in the night when these thoughts come so easily. But I wanted immediate results in those days, so I went to the petty lawyers."" ""Well look at you two sat huddled together!"""
"Fast gleichzeitig mit dem Glockenzeichen erschien Leni, sie suchte durch rasche Blicke zu erfahren, was geschehen war; daß K. ruhig beim Bett des Advokaten saß, schien ihr beruhigend. Sie nickte K., der sie starr ansah, lächelnd zu. »Hole Block«, sagte der Advokat. Statt ihn aber zu holen, trat sie nur vor die Tür, rief: »Block! Zum Advokaten!« und schlüpfte dann, wahrscheinlich weil der Advokat zur Wand abgekehrt blieb und sich um nichts kümmerte, hinter K.s Sessel. Sie störte ihn von nun ab, indem sie sich über die Sessellehne vorbeugte oder mit den Händen, allerdings sehr zart und vorsichtig, durch sein Haar fuhr und über seine Wangen strich. Schließlich suchte K. sie daran zu hindern, indem er sie bei einer Hand erfaßte, die sie ihm nach einigem Widerstreben überließ.","Leni appeared almost at the same time as the bell sounded; she tried to find out what had happened by looking quickly; the fact that K. was sitting quietly by the lawyer's bed seemed reassuring to her. She smiled and nodded to K., who was staring at her. ""Get Block,"" said the lawyer. But instead of fetching him, she just stepped in front of the door and called out: ""Block! Block!"" To the lawyer!' and then slipped behind K.'s chair, probably because the lawyer was facing the wall and paying no attention to anything.

"Diese geordnete Darstellung verblüffte K. anfangs, dann aber sagte er ebenso leise wie der Maler: »Ich glaube, Sie widersprechen sich.« »Wie denn?« fragte der Maler geduldig und lehnte sich lächelnd zurück. Dieses Lächeln erweckte in K. das Gefühl, als ob er jetzt daran gehe, nicht in den Worten des Malers, sondern in dem Gerichtsverfahren selbst Widersprüche zu entdecken. Trotzdem wich er aber nicht zurück und sagte: »Sie haben früher die Bemerkung gemacht, daß das Gericht für Beweisgründe unzugänglich ist, später haben Sie dies auf das öffentliche Gericht eingeschränkt, und jetzt sagen Sie sogar, daß der Unschuldige vor dem Gericht keine Hilfe braucht. Darin liegt schon ein Widerspruch. Außerdem aber haben Sie früher gesagt, daß man die Richter persönlich beeinflussen kann, stellen aber jetzt in Abrede, daß die wirkliche Freisprechung, wie Sie sie nennen, jemals durch persönliche Beeinflussung zu erreichen ist. Darin liegt der zweite Widerspruch.« »Diese Widersprüche sind leicht aufzuklären«, sagte der Maler. »Es ist hier von zwei verschiedenen Dingen die Rede, von dem, was im Gesetz steht, und von dem, was ich persönlich erfahren habe, das dürfen Sie nicht verwechseln. Im Gesetz, ich habe es allerdings nicht gelesen, steht natürlich einerseits, daß der Unschuldige freigesprochen wird, andererseits steht dort aber nicht, daß die Richter beeinflußt werden können. Nun habe aber ich gerade das Gegenteil dessen erfahren. Ich weiß von keiner wirklichen Freisprechung, wohl aber von vielen Beeinflussungen. Es ist natürlich möglich, daß in allen mir bekannten Fällen keine Unschuld vorhanden war. Aber ist das nicht unwahrscheinlich? In so vielen Fällen keine einzige Unschuld? Schon als Kind hörte ich dem Vater genau zu, wenn er zu Hause von Prozessen erzählte, auch die Richter, die in sein Atelier kamen, erzählten vom Gericht, man spricht in unseren Kreisen überhaupt von nichts anderem; kaum bekam ich die Möglichkeit, selbst zu Gericht zu gehen, nützte ich sie immer aus, unzählbare Prozesse habe ich in wichtigen Stadien angehört und, soweit sie sichtbar sind, verfolgt, und – ich muß es zugeben – nicht einen einzigen wirklichen Freispruch erlebt.« »Keinen einzigen Freispruch also«, sagte K., als rede er zu sich selbst und zu seinen Hoffnungen. »Das bestätigt aber die Meinung, die ich von dem Gericht schon habe. Es ist also auch von dieser Seite zwecklos. Ein einziger Henker könnte das ganze Gericht ersetzen.« »Sie dürfen nicht verallgemeinern«, sagte der Maler unzufrieden, »ich habe ja nur von meinen Erfahrungen gesprochen.« »Das genügt doch«, sagte K., »oder haben Sie von Freisprüchen aus früherer Zeit gehört?« »Solche Freisprüche«, antwortete der Maler, »soll es allerdings gegeben haben. Nur ist es sehr schwer, das festzustellen. Die abschließenden Entscheidungen des Gerichts werden nicht veröffentlicht, sie sind nicht einmal den Richtern zugänglich, infolgedessen haben sich über alte Gerichtsfälle nur Legenden erhalten. Diese enthalten allerdings sogar in der Mehrzahl wirkliche Freisprechungen, man kann sie glauben, nachweisbar sind sie aber nicht. Trotzdem muß man sie nicht ganz vernachlässigen, eine gewisse Wahrheit enthalten sie wohl gewiß, auch sind sie sehr schön, ich selbst habe einige Bilder gemalt, die solche Legenden zum Inhalt haben.« »Bloße Legenden ändern meine Meinung nicht«, sagte K., »man kann sich wohl auch vor Gericht auf diese Legenden nicht berufen?« Der Maler lachte. »Nein, das kann man nicht«, sagte er. »Dann ist es nutzlos, darüber zu reden«, sagte K., er wollte vorläufig alle Meinungen des Malers hinnehmen, selbst wenn er sie für unwahrscheinlich hielt und sie anderen Berichten widersprachen. Er hatte jetzt nicht die Zeit, alles was der Maler sagte, auf die Wahrheit hin zu überprüfen oder gar zu widerlegen, es war schon das Äußerste erreicht, wenn er den Maler dazu bewog, ihm in irgendeiner, sei es auch in einer nicht entscheidenden Weise zu helfen. Darum sagte er: »Sehen wir also von der wirklichen Freisprechung ab, Sie erwähnten aber noch zwei andere Möglichkeiten.« »Die scheinbare Freisprechung und die Verschleppung. Um die allein kann es sich handeln«, sagte der Maler. »Wollen Sie aber nicht, ehe wir davon reden, den Rock ausziehen? Es ist Ihnen wohl heiß.« »Ja«, sagte K., der bisher auf nichts als auf die Erklärungen des Malers geachtet hatte, dem aber jetzt, da er an die Hitze erinnert worden war, starker Schweiß auf der Stirn ausbrach. »Es ist fast unerträglich.« Der Maler nickte, als verstehe er K.s Unbehagen sehr gut. »Könnte man nicht das Fenster öffnen?« fragte K. »Nein«, sagte der Maler. »Es ist bloß eine fest eingesetzte Glasscheibe, man kann es nicht öffnen.« Jetzt erkannte K., daß er die ganze Zeit über darauf gehofft hatte, plötzlich werde der Maler oder er zum Fenster gehen und es aufreißen. Er war darauf vorbereitet, selbst den Nebel mit offenem Mund einzuatmen. Das Gefühl, hier von der Luft vollständig abgesperrt zu sein, verursachte ihm Schwindel. Er schlug leicht mit der Hand auf das Federbett neben sich und sagte mit schwacher Stimme: »Das ist ja unbequem und ungesund.« »O nein«, sagte der Maler zur Verteidigung seines Fensters, »dadurch, daß es nicht aufgemacht werden kann, wird, obwohl es nur eine einfache Scheibe ist, die Wärme hier besser festgehalten als durch ein Doppelfenster. Will ich aber lüften, was nicht sehr notwendig ist, da durch die Balkenritzen überall Luft eindringt, kann ich eine meiner Türen oder sogar beide öffnen.« K., durch diese Erklärung ein wenig getröstet, blickte herum, um die zweite Tür zu finden. Der Maler bemerkte das und sagte: »Sie ist hinter Ihnen, ich mußte sie durch das Bett verstellen.« Jetzt erst sah K. die kleine Tür in der Wand. »Es ist eben hier alles viel zu klein für ein Atelier«, sagte der Maler, als wolle er einem Tadel K.s zuvorkommen. »Ich mußte mich einrichten, so gut es ging. Das Bett vor der Tür steht natürlich an einem sehr schlechten Platz. Der Richter zum Beispiel, den ich jetzt male, kommt immer durch die Tür beim Bett, und ich habe ihm auch einen Schlüssel von dieser Tür gegeben, damit er, auch wenn ich nicht zu Hause bin, hier im Atelier auf mich warten kann. Nun kommt er aber gewöhnlich früh am Morgen, während ich noch schlafe. Es reißt mich natürlich immer aus dem tiefsten Schlaf, wenn sich neben dem Bett die Tür öffnet. Sie würden jede Ehrfurcht vor den Richtern verlieren, wenn Sie die Flüche hörten, mit denen ich ihn empfange, wenn er früh über mein Bett steigt. Ich könnte ihm allerdings den Schlüssel wegnehmen, aber es würde dadurch nur ärger werden. Man kann hier alle Türen mit der geringsten Anstrengung aus den Angeln brechen.« Während dieser ganzen Rede überlegte K., ob er den Rock ausziehen sollte, er sah aber schließlich ein, daß er, wenn er es nicht tat, unfähig war, hier noch länger zu bleiben, er zog daher den Rock aus, legte ihn aber über die Knie, um ihn, falls die Besprechung zu Ende wäre, wieder anziehen zu können. Kaum hatte er den Rock ausgezogen, rief eines der Mädchen: »Er hat schon den Rock ausgezogen!« und man hörte, wie sich alle zu den Ritzen drängten, um das Schauspiel selbst zu sehen. »Die Mädchen glauben nämlich«, sagte der Maler, »daß ich Sie malen werde und daß Sie sich deshalb ausziehen.« »So«, sagte K., nur wenig belustigt, denn er fühlte sich nicht viel besser als früher, obwohl er jetzt in Hemdärmeln dasaß. Fast mürrisch fragte er: »Wie nannten Sie die zwei anderen Möglichkeiten?« Er hatte die Ausdrücke schon wieder vergessen. »Die scheinbare Freisprechung und die Verschleppung«, sagte der Maler. »Es liegt an Ihnen, was Sie davon wählen. Beides ist durch meine Hilfe erreichbar, natürlich nicht ohne Mühe, der Unterschied in dieser Hinsicht ist der, daß die scheinbare Freisprechung eine gesammelte zeitweilige, die Verschleppung eine viel geringere, aber dauernde Anstrengung verlangt. Zunächst also die scheinbare Freisprechung. Wenn Sie diese wünschen sollten, schreibe ich auf einem Bogen Papier eine Bestätigung Ihrer Unschuld auf. Der Text für eine solche Bestätigung ist mir von meinem Vater überliefert und ganz unangreifbar. Mit dieser Bestätigung mache ich nun einen Rundgang bei den mir bekannten Richtern. Ich fange also etwa damit an, daß ich dem Richter, den ich jetzt male, heute abend, wenn er zur Sitzung kommt, die Bestätigung vorlege. Ich lege ihm die Bestätigung vor, erkläre ihm, daß Sie unschuldig sind, und verbürge mich für Ihre Unschuld. Das ist aber keine bloß äußerliche, sondern eine wirkliche, bindende Bürgschaft.« In den Blicken des Malers lag es wie ein Vorwurf, daß K. ihm die Last einer solchen Bürgschaft auferlegen wolle. »Das wäre ja sehr freundlich«, sagte K. »Und der Richter würde Ihnen glauben und mich trotzdem nicht wirklich freisprechen?« »Wie ich schon sagte«, antwortete der Maler. »Übrigens ist es durchaus nicht sicher, daß jeder mir glauben würde, mancher Richter wird zum Beispiel verlangen, daß ich Sie selbst zu ihm hinführe. Dann müßten Sie also einmal mitkommen. Allerdings ist in einem solchen Falle die Sache schon halb gewonnen, besonders da ich Sie natürlich vorher genau darüber unterrichten würde, wie Sie sich bei dem betreffenden Richter zu verhalten haben. Schlimmer ist es bei den Richtern, die mich – auch das wird vorkommen – von vornherein abweisen. Auf diese müssen wir, wenn ich es auch an mehrfachen Versuchen gewiß nicht fehlen lassen werde, verzichten, wir dürfen das aber auch, denn einzelne Richter können hier nicht den Ausschlag geben. Wenn ich nun auf dieser Bestätigung eine genügende Anzahl von Unterschriften der Richter habe, gehe ich mit dieser Bestätigung zu dem Richter, der Ihren Prozeß gerade führt. Möglicherweise habe ich auch seine Unterschrift, dann entwickelt sich alles noch ein wenig rascher als sonst. Im allgemeinen gibt es aber dann überhaupt nicht mehr viel Hindernisse, es ist dann für den Angeklagten die Zeit der höchsten Zuversicht. Es ist merkwürdig, aber wahr, die Leute sind in dieser Zeit zuversichtlicher als nach dem Freispruch. Es bedarf jetzt keiner besonderen Mühe mehr. Der Richter besitzt in der Bestätigung die Bürgschaft einer Anzahl von Richtern, kann Sie unbesorgt freisprechen und wird es, allerdings nach Durchführung verschiedener Formalitäten, mir und anderen Bekannten zu Gefallen zweifellos tun. Sie aber treten aus dem Gericht und sind frei.« »Dann bin ich also frei«, sagte K. zögernd. »Ja«, sagte der Maler, »aber nur scheinbar frei oder, besser ausgedrückt, zeitweilig frei. Die untersten Richter nämlich, zu denen meine Bekannten gehören, haben nicht das Recht, endgültig freizusprechen, dieses Recht hat nur das oberste, für Sie, für mich und für uns alle ganz unerreichbare Gericht. Wie es dort aussieht, wissen wir nicht und wollen wir, nebenbei gesagt, auch nicht wissen. Das große Recht, von der Anklage zu befreien, haben also unsere Richter nicht, wohl aber haben sie das Recht, von der Anklage loszulösen. Das heißt, wenn Sie auf diese Weise freigesprochen werden, sind Sie für den Augenblick der Anklage entzogen, aber sie schwebt auch weiterhin über Ihnen und kann, sobald nur der höhere Befehl kommt, sofort in Wirkung treten. Da ich mit dem Gericht in so guter Verbindung stehe, kann ich Ihnen auch sagen, wie sich in den Vorschriften für die Gerichtskanzleien der Unterschied zwischen der wirklichen und der scheinbaren Freisprechung rein äußerlich zeigt. Bei einer wirklichen Freisprechung sollen die Prozeßakten vollständig abgelegt werden, sie verschwinden gänzlich aus dem Verfahren, nicht nur die Anklage, auch der Prozeß und sogar der Freispruch sind vernichtet, alles ist vernichtet. Anders beim scheinbaren Freispruch. Mit dem Akt ist keine weitere Veränderung vor sich gegangen, als daß er um die Bestätigung der Unschuld, um den Freispruch und um die Begründung des Freispruchs bereichert worden ist. Im übrigen aber bleibt er im Verfahren, er wird, wie es der ununterbrochene Verkehr der Gerichtskanzleien erfordert, zu den höheren Gerichten weitergeleitet, kommt zu den niedrigeren zurück und pendelt so mit größeren und kleineren Schwingungen, mit größeren und kleineren Stockungen auf und ab. Diese Wege sind unberechenbar. Von außen gesehen, kann es manchmal den Anschein bekommen, daß alles längst vergessen, der Akt verloren und der Freispruch ein vollkommener ist. Ein Eingeweihter wird das nicht glauben. Es geht kein Akt verloren, es gibt bei Gericht kein Vergessen. Eines Tages – niemand erwartet es – nimmt irgendein Richter den Akt aufmerksamer in die Hand, erkennt, daß in diesem Fall die Anklage noch lebendig ist, und ordnet die sofortige Verhaftung an. Ich habe hier angenommen, daß zwischen dem scheinbaren Freispruch und der neuen Verhaftung eine lange Zeit vergeht, das ist möglich, und ich weiß von solchen Fällen, es ist aber ebensogut möglich, daß der Freigesprochene vom Gericht nach Hause kommt und dort schon Beauftragte warten, um ihn wieder zu verhaften. Dann ist natürlich das freie Leben zu Ende.« »Und der Prozeß beginnt von neuem?« fragte K. fast ungläubig. »Allerdings«, sagte der Maler, »der Prozeß beginnt von neuem, es besteht aber wieder die Möglichkeit, ebenso wie früher, einen scheinbaren Freispruch zu erwirken. Man muß wieder alle Kräfte zusammennehmen und darf sich nicht ergeben.« Das letztere sagte der Maler vielleicht unter dem Eindruck, den K., der ein wenig zusammengesunken war, auf ihn machte. »Ist aber«, fragte K., als wolle er jetzt irgendwelchen Enthüllungen des Malers zuvorkommen, »die Erwirkung eines zweiten Freispruchs nicht schwieriger als die des ersten?« »Man kann«, antwortete der Maler, »in dieser Hinsicht nichts Bestimmtes sagen. Sie meinen wohl, daß die Richter durch die zweite Verhaftung in ihrem Urteil zuungunsten des Angeklagten beeinflußt werden? Das ist nicht der Fall. Die Richter haben ja schon beim Freispruch diese Verhaftung vorgesehen. Dieser Umstand wirkt also kaum ein. Wohl aber kann aus zahllosen sonstigen Gründen die Stimmung der Richter sowie ihre rechtliche Beurteilung des Falles eine andere geworden sein, und die Bemühungen um den zweiten Freispruch müssen daher den veränderten Umständen angepaßt werden und im allgemeinen ebenso kräftig sein wie die vor dem ersten Freispruch.« »Aber dieser zweite Freispruch ist doch wieder nicht endgültig«, sagte K. und drehte abweisend den Kopf. »Natürlich nicht«, sagte der Maler, »dem zweiten Freispruch folgt die dritte Verhaftung, dem dritten Freispruch die vierte Verhaftung, und so fort. Das liegt schon im Begriff des scheinbaren Freispruchs.« K. schwieg. »Der scheinbare Freispruch scheint Ihnen offenbar nicht vorteilhaft zu sein«, sagte der Maler, »vielleicht entspricht Ihnen die Verschleppung besser. Soll ich Ihnen das Wesen der Verschleppung erklären?« K. nickte. Der Maler hatte sich breit in seinen Sessel zurückgelehnt, das Nachthemd war weit offen, er hatte eure Hand daruntergeschoben, mit der er über die Brust und die Seiten strich. »Die Verschleppung«, sagte der Maler und sah einen Augenblick vor sich hin, als suche er eine vollständig zutreffende Erklärung, »die Verschleppung besteht darin, daß der Prozeß dauernd im niedrigsten Prozeßstadium erhalten wird. Um dies zu erreichen, ist es nötig, daß der Angeklagte und der Helfer, insbesondere aber der Helfer in ununterbrochener persönlicher Fühlung mit dem Gericht bleibt. Ich wiederhole, es ist hierfür kein solcher Kraftaufwand nötig wie bei der Erreichung eines scheinbaren Freispruchs, wohl aber ist eine viel größere Aufmerksamkeit nötig. Man darf den Prozeß nicht aus den Augen verlieren, man muß zu dem betreffenden Richter in regelmäßigen Zwischenräumen und außerdem bei besonderen Gelegenheiten gehen und ihn auf jede Weise sich freundlich zu erhalten suchen; ist man mit dem Richter nicht persönlich bekannt, so muß man durch bekannte Richter ihn beeinflussen lassen, ohne daß man etwa deshalb die unmittelbaren Besprechungen aufgeben dürfte. Versäumt man in dieser Hinsicht nichts, so kann man mit genügender Bestimmtheit annehmen, daß der Prozeß über sein erstes Stadium nicht hinauskommt. Der Prozeß hört zwar nicht auf, aber der Angeklagte ist vor einer Verurteilung fast ebenso gesichert, wie wenn er frei wäre. Gegenüber dem scheinbaren Freispruch hat die Verschleppung den Vorteil, daß die Zukunft des Angeklagten weniger unbestimmt ist, er bleibt vor dem Schrecken der plötzlichen Verhaftungen bewahrt und muß nicht fürchten, etwa gerade zu Zeiten, wo seine sonstigen Umstände dafür am wenigsten günstig sind, die Anstrengungen und Aufregungen auf sich nehmen zu müssen, welche mit der Erreichung des scheinbaren Freispruchs verbunden sind. Allerdings hat auch die Verschleppung für den Angeklagten gewisse Nachteile, die man nicht unterschätzen darf. Ich denke hierbei nicht daran, daß hier der Angeklagte niemals frei ist, das ist er ja auch bei der scheinbaren Freisprechung im eigentlichen Sinne nicht. Es ist ein anderer Nachteil. Der Prozeß kann nicht stillstehen, ohne daß wenigstens scheinbare Gründe dafür vorliegen. Es muß deshalb im Prozeß nach außen hin etwas geschehen. Es müssen also von Zeit zu Zeit verschiedene Anordnungen getroffen werden, der Angeklagte muß verhört werden, Untersuchungen müssen stattfinden und so weiter. Der Prozeß muß eben immerfort in dem kleinen Kreis, auf den er künstlich eingeschränkt worden ist, gedreht werden. Das bringt natürlich gewisse Unannehmlichkeiten für den Angeklagten mit sich, die Sie sich aber wiederum nicht zu schlimm vorstellen dürfen. Es ist ja alles nur äußerlich, die Verhöre beispielsweise sind also nur ganz kurz, wenn man einmal keine Zeit oder keine Lust hat, hinzugehen, darf man sich entschuldigen, man kann sogar bei gewissen Richtern die Anordnungen für eine lange Zeit im voraus gemeinsam festsetzen, es handelt sich im Wesen nur darum, daß man, da man Angeklagter ist, von Zeit zu Zeit bei seinem Richter sich meldet.« Schon während der letzten Worte hatte K. den Rock über den Arm gelegt und war aufgestanden. »Er steht schon auf!« rief es sofort draußen vor der Tür. »Sie wollen schon fortgehen?« fragte der Maler, der auch aufgestanden war. »Es ist gewiß die Luft, die Sie von hier vertreibt. Es ist mir sehr peinlich. Ich hätte Ihnen auch noch manches zu sagen. Ich mußte mich ganz kurz fassen. Ich hoffe aber, verständlich gewesen zu sein.« »O ja«, sagte K., dem von der Anstrengung, mit der er sich zum Zuhören gezwungen hatte, der Kopf schmerzte. Trotz dieser Bestätigung sagte der Maler, alles noch einmal zusammenfassend, als wolle er K. auf den Heimweg einen Trost mitgeben: »Beide Methoden haben das Gemeinsame, daß sie eine Verurteilung des Angeklagten verhindern.« »Sie verhindern aber auch die wirkliche Freisprechung«, sagte K. leise, als schäme er sich, das erkannt zu haben. »Sie haben den Kern der Sache erfaßt«, sagte der Maler schnell. K. legte die Hand auf seinen Winterrock, konnte sich aber nicht einmal entschließen, den Rock anzuziehen. Am liebsten hätte er alles zusammengepackt und wäre damit an die frische Luft gelaufen. Auch die Mädchen konnten ihn nicht dazu bewegen, sich anzuziehen, obwohl sie, verfrüht, einander schon zuriefen, daß er sich anziehe. Dem Maler lag daran, K.s Stimmung irgendwie zu deuten, er sagte deshalb: »Sie haben sich wohl hinsichtlich meiner Vorschläge noch nicht entschieden. Ich billige das. Ich hätte Ihnen sogar davon abgeraten, sich sofort zu entscheiden. Die Vorteile und Nachteile sind haarfein. Man muß alles genau abschätzen. Allerdings darf man auch nicht zuviel Zeit verlieren.« »Ich werde bald wiederkommen«, sagte K., der in einem plötzlichen Entschluß den Rock anzog, den Mantel über die Schulter warf und zur Tür eilte, hinter der jetzt die Mädchen zu schreien anfingen. K. glaubte, die schreienden Mädchen durch die Tür zu sehen. »Sie müssen aber Wort halten«, sagte der Maler, der ihm nicht gefolgt war, »sonst komme ich in die Bank, um selbst nachzufragen.« »Sperren Sie doch die Tür auf«, sagte K. und riß an der Klinke, die die Mädchen, wie er an dem Gegendruck merkte, draußen festhielten. »Wollen Sie von den Mädchen belästigt werden?« fragte der Maler. »Benützen Sie doch lieber diesen Ausgang«, und er zeigte auf die Tür hinter dem Bett. K. war damit einverstanden und sprang zum Bett zurück. Aber statt die Tür dort zu öffnen, kroch der Maler unter das Bett und fragte von unten: »Nur noch einen Augenblick; wollen Sie nicht noch ein Bild sehen, das ich Ihnen verkaufen könnte?« K. wollte nicht unhöflich sein, der Maler hatte sich wirklich seiner angenommen und versprochen, ihm weiterhin zu helfen, auch war infolge der Vergeßlichkeit K.s über die Entlohnung für die Hilfe noch gar nicht gesprochen worden, deshalb konnte ihn K. jetzt nicht abweisen und ließ sich das Bild zeigen, wenn er auch vor Ungeduld zitterte, aus dem Atelier wegzukommen. Der Maler zog unter dem Bett einen Haufen ungerahmter Bilder hervor, die so mit Staub bedeckt waren, daß dieser, als ihn der Maler vom obersten Bild wegzublasen suchte, längere Zeit atemraubend K. vor den Augen wirbelte. »Eine Heidelandschaft«, sagte der Maler und reichte K. das Bild. Es stellte zwei schwache Bäume dar, die weit voneinander entfernt im dunklen Gras standen. Im Hintergrund war ein vielfarbiger Sonnenuntergang. »Schön«, sagte K., »ich kaufe es.« K. hatte unbedacht sich so kurz geäußert, er war daher froh, als der Maler, statt dies übelzunehmen, ein zweites Bild vom Boden aufhob. »Hier ist ein Gegenstück zu diesem Bild«, sagte der Maler. Es mochte als Gegenstück beabsichtigt sein, es war aber nicht der geringste Unterschied gegenüber dem ersten Bild zu merken, hier waren die Bäume, hier das Gras und dort der Sonnenuntergang. Aber K. lag wenig daran. »Es sind schöne Landschaften«, sagte er, »ich kaufe beide und werde sie in meinem Büro aufhängen.« »Das Motiv scheint Ihnen zu gefallen«, sagte der Maler und holte ein drittes Bild herauf, »es trifft sich gut, daß ich noch ein ähnliches Bild hier habe.« Es war aber nicht ähnlich, es war vielmehr die völlig gleiche Heidelandschaft. Der Maler nützte diese Gelegenheit, alte Bilder zu verkaufen, gut aus. »Ich nehme auch dieses noch«, sagte K. »Wieviel kosten die drei Bilder?« »Darüber werden wir nächstens sprechen«, sagte der Maler. »Sie haben jetzt Eile, und wir bleiben doch in Verbindung. Im übrigen freut es mich, daß Ihnen die Bilder gefallen, ich werde Ihnen alle Bilder mitgeben, die ich hier unten habe. Es sind lauter Heidelandschaften, ich habe schon viele Heidelandschaften gemalt. Manche Leute weisen solche Bilder ab, weil sie zu düster sind, andere aber, und Sie gehören zu ihnen, lieben gerade das Düstere.« Aber K. hatte jetzt keinen Sinn für die beruflichen Erfahrungen des Bettelmalers. »Packen Sie alle Bilder ein!« rief er, dem Maler in die Rede fallend, »morgen kommt mein Diener und wird sie holen.« »Es ist nicht nötig«, sagte der Maler. »Ich hoffe, ich werde Ihnen einen Träger verschaffen können, der gleich mit Ihnen gehen wird.« Und er beugte sich endlich über das Bett und sperrte die Tür auf. »Steigen Sie ohne Scheu auf das Bett«, sagte der Maler, »das tut jeder, der hier hereinkommt.« K. hätte auch ohne diese Aufforderung keine Rücksicht genommen, er hatte sogar schon einen Fuß mitten auf das Federbett gesetzt, da sah er durch die offene Tür hinaus und zog den Fuß wieder zurück. »Was ist das?« fragte er den Maler. »Worüber staunen Sie?« fragte dieser, seinerseits staunend. »Es sind die Gerichtskanzleien. Wußten Sie nicht, daß hier Gerichtskanzleien sind? Gerichtskanzleien sind doch fast auf jedem Dachboden, warum sollten sie gerade hier fehlen? Auch mein Atelier gehört eigentlich zu den Gerichtskanzleien, das Gericht hat es mir aber zur Verfügung gestellt.« K. erschrak nicht so sehr darüber, daß er auch hier Gerichtskanzleien gefunden hatte, er erschrak hauptsächlich über sich, über seine Unwissenheit in Gerichtssachen. Als eine Grundregel für das Verhalten eines Angeklagten erschien es ihm, immer vorbereitet zu sein, sich niemals überraschen zu lassen, nicht ahnungslos nach rechts zu schauen, wenn links der Richter neben ihm stand – und gerade gegen diese Grundregel verstieß er immer wieder. Vor ihm dehnte sich ein langer Gang, aus dem eine Luft wehte, mit der verglichen die Luft im Atelier erfrischend war. Bänke waren zu beiden Seiten des Ganges aufgestellt, genau so wie im Wartezimmer der Kanzlei, die für K. zuständig war. Es schienen genaue Vorschriften für die Einrichtung von Kanzleien zu bestehen. Augenblicklich war der Parteienverkehr hier nicht sehr groß. Ein Mann saß dort halb liegend, das Gesicht hatte er auf der Bank in seine Arme vergraben und schien zu schlafen; ein anderer stand im Halbdunkel am Ende des Ganges. K. stieg nun über das Bett, der Maler folgte ihm mit den Bildern. Sie trafen bald einen Gerichtsdiener – K. erkannte jetzt schon alle Gerichtsdiener an dem Goldknopf, den diese an ihrem Zivilanzug unter den gewöhnlichen Knöpfen hatten – und der Maler gab ihm den Auftrag, K. mit den Bildern zu begleiten. K. wankte mehr, als er ging, das Taschentuch hielt er an den Mund gedrückt. Sie waren schon nahe dem Ausgang, da stürmten ihnen die Mädchen entgegen, die also K. auch nicht erspart geblieben waren. Sie hatten offenbar gesehen, daß die zweite Tür des Ateliers geöffnet worden war und hatten den Umweg gemacht, um von dieser Seite einzudringen. »Ich kann Sie nicht mehr begleiten!« rief der Maler lachend unter dem Andrang der Mädchen. »Auf Wiedersehen! Und überlegen Sie nicht zu lange!« K. sah sich nicht einmal nach ihm um. Auf der Gasse nahm er den ersten Wagen, der ihm in den Weg kam. Es lag ihm daran, den Diener loszuwerden, dessen Goldknopf ihm unaufhörlich in die Augen stach, wenn er auch sonst wahrscheinlich niemandem auffiel. In seiner Dienstfertigkeit wollte sich der Diener noch auf den Kutschbock setzen. K. jagte ihn aber hinunter. Mittag war schon längst vorüber, als K. vor der Bank ankam. Er hätte gern die Bilder im Wagen gelassen, fürchtete aber, bei irgendeiner Gelegenheit genötigt zu werden, sich dem Maler gegenüber mit ihnen auszuweisen. Er ließ sie daher in sein Büro schaffen und versperrte sie in die unterste Lade seines Tisches, um sie wenigstens für die allernächsten Tage vor den Blicken des Direktor-Stellvertreters in Sicherheit zu bringen.","This orderly depiction amazed K. at first, but then he said just as quietly as the painter: ""I think you're contradicting yourself."" ""How?"" the painter asked patiently, leaning back and smiling. This smile made K. feel as if he were about to discover contradictions not in the painter's words but in the court proceedings themselves. But he did not back down and said: 'You used to say that the court is inaccessible to evidence, later you reduced this to the public court, and now you even say that the innocent man needs no help before the court . Therein lies a contradiction. Furthermore, you have previously said that judges can be personally influenced, but now you deny that actual acquittal, as you call it, can ever be achieved through personal influence. Therein lies the second contradiction.' 'These contradictions are easy to clear up,' said the painter. 'We're talking about two different things here, what's in the law and what I've personally experienced, don't mix that up. The law, of course I haven't read it, says on the one hand that the innocent person will be acquitted, but on the other hand it doesn't say that the judges can be influenced. But now I've experienced just the opposite of that. I don't know of any real acquittal, but of many influences. It is of course possible that in all the cases known to me there was no innocence. But isn't that unlikely? In so many cases not a single innocence? Even as a child I listened closely to my father when he talked about trials at home, the judges who came to his studio also talked about the court, in our circles we talk about nothing else; As soon as I got the opportunity to go to court myself, I always took advantage of it, I have heard innumerable trials at important stages and followed them as far as they are visible, and - I must admit - not experienced a single real acquittal."" ""So not a single acquittal,"" said K., as if he were talking to himself and his hopes. “But that confirms the opinion I already have of the court. So it's useless from this side, too. A single hangman could take the place of the whole court."" ""You mustn't generalize,"" said the dissatisfied painter, ""I was only speaking of my experiences."" ""That's enough,"" said K., ""or are you assuming acquittals heard earlier?"" ""Such acquittals,"" replied the painter, ""are said to have existed. It's just very difficult to determine. The final decisions of the court are not published, they are not even available to the judges, as a result only legends have survived about old court cases. However, the majority of these even contain real acquittals, one can believe them, but they are not verifiable. Nevertheless, you don't have to neglect them entirely, they certainly contain a certain truth, and they're also very beautiful, I've painted a few pictures myself that have such legends as their content."" ""Legends alone don't change my opinion,"" said K., ""I suppose one can't invoke these legends in court either?"" The painter laughed. ""No, you can't,"" he said. ""Then it's useless to talk about it,"" said K., wanting to accept all of the painter's opinions for the time being, even if he considered them improbable and they contradicted other reports. He didn't have the time now to check the truth of everything the painter said, or even to refute it; it would be the utmost if he could persuade the painter to agree with him in any way, even if it wasn't decisive to help. That's why he said: ""Let's disregard the actual acquittal, but you mentioned two other possibilities."" It can be about that alone,” said the painter. 'But don't you want to take off your coat before we talk about it? You must be hot.' 'Yes,' said K., who had previously paid no attention to anything but the painter's explanations, but now that he had been reminded of the heat, profuse perspiration broke out on his forehead. ""It's almost unbearable."" The painter nodded as if he understood K.'s discomfort very well. ""Couldn't you open the window?"" asked K. ""No,"" said the painter. 'It's just a fixed pane of glass, you can't open it.' K. now realized that he had been hoping all along that the painter or he would suddenly go to the window and tear it open. He was prepared to breathe in even the mist with his mouth open. The feeling of being completely cut off from the air here made him dizzy. He slapped his hand lightly on the quilt beside him and said in a weak voice, ""That's uncomfortable and unhealthy."" , even though it's just a single pane, heat is retained here better than through a double pane. But if I want to ventilate, which isn't very necessary because air gets in everywhere through the cracks in the beams, I can open one of my doors or even both.' K., somewhat comforted by this explanation, looked around to find the second door. The painter noticed that and said: ""It's behind you, I had to move it with the bed."" Only then did K. see the small door in the wall. ""Everything here is far too small for a studio,"" said the painter, as if he wanted to forestall a reprimand from K. 'I had to settle in as best I could. The bed in front of the door is of course in a very bad place. For example, the judge I'm painting now always comes through the door by the bed, and I also gave him a key from this door so that even if I'm not at home, he can wait for me here in the studio. Now he usually comes early in the morning while I'm still asleep. Of course, it always wakes me up from the deepest sleep when the door next to the bed opens. You would lose all respect for the judges to hear the curses I greet him with when he climbs over my bed early in the morning. I could take the key away from him, but that would only make things worse. All the doors here can be knocked off their hinges with the slightest effort.' Throughout this speech, K. considered taking off his coat, but finally realized that if he didn't, he wouldn't be able to, even here to stay longer, he therefore took off his coat, but laid it over his knees in order to be able to put it on again when the meeting was over. As soon as he took off his skirt, one of the girls called out, ""He's already taken off his skirt!"" and everyone could be heard crowding to the cracks to see the spectacle for themselves. ""The girls think,"" said the painter, ""that I'm going to paint you and that's why you're undressing."" ""So,"" said K., only slightly amused, because he didn't feel much better than before, although he now sat in shirt sleeves. Almost grumpily he asked, ""What did you call the other two possibilities?"" He had already forgotten the expressions. ""The apparent acquittal and the kidnapping,"" said the painter. “It's up to you what you choose from it. Both can be achieved with my help, of course not without effort, the difference in this respect is that the apparent acquittal requires a concentrated, temporary effort, while the delay requires a much lesser but lasting effort. So first the apparent acquittal. If you wish, I will write down a piece of paper confirming your innocence. The text for such a confirmation has been handed down to me by my father and is quite unassailable. With this confirmation, I now make a tour of the judges I know. So I'll start off by presenting the confirmation to the judge I'm painting now, when he comes to the session tonight. I'll show him the certificate, declare your innocence, and vouch for your innocence. But that's not just an external guarantee, it's a real, binding guarantee.' The painter's eyes looked like a reproach that K. wanted to impose such a guarantee on him. ""That would be very friendly,"" said K. ""And the judge would believe you and still not really acquit me?"" ""As I said,"" replied the painter. 'By the way, it's not at all certain that everyone would believe me, some judges will demand, for example, that I take you to him myself. Then you would have to come along. However, in such a case the matter is already half won, especially since I would of course inform you beforehand exactly how you are to behave before the judge in question. It's worse with the judges, who - that will also happen - reject me from the outset. We must do without this, even if I will certainly not fail to try several times, but we are allowed to do so, because individual judges cannot decide the matter here. If I now have a sufficient number of signatures from the judges on this confirmation, I will take this confirmation to the judge who is currently conducting your trial. I may also have his signature, then everything will develop a little more quickly than usual. In general, however, there are not many obstacles at all, it is then the time of the greatest confidence for the accused. It's strange but true, people are more confident at this time than after the acquittal. It doesn't require any special effort now. In the confirmation, the judge has the guarantee of a number of judges, can acquit you without any worries and will undoubtedly do so, after carrying out various formalities, for the benefit of me and other acquaintances. But you're leaving the court and you're free.' 'Then I'm free,' said K. hesitantly. 'Yes,' said the painter, 'but only apparently free or, to put it better, temporarily free. The lowest judges, to whom my acquaintances belong, do not have the right to finally acquit, only the highest court, which is completely inaccessible for you, for me and for all of us, has this right. We don't know what it looks like there and, by the way, we don't want to know either. So our judges do not have the great right to release from the charge, but they do have the right to release from the charge. That is, if you are acquitted in this way, you are absolved of the charge for the moment, but it still looms over you and can take immediate effect as soon as higher orders come. As I am in such good contact with the court, I can also tell you how in the regulations for the court records the difference between real and apparent acquittal shows itself purely externally. In the event of an actual acquittal, the trial files should be completely filed, they disappear entirely from the trial, not only the indictment, but also the trial and even the acquittal are destroyed, everything is destroyed. Unlike the apparent acquittal. No further change has taken place with the act other than the fact that it has been enriched by the confirmation of innocence, the acquittal and the justification for the acquittal. For the rest, however, he remains in the proceedings; he is passed on to the higher courts, as required by the uninterrupted traffic of the court offices, he returns to the lower courts and thus oscillates up and down with larger and smaller fluctuations, with larger and smaller delays. These paths are unpredictable. Seen from the outside, it can sometimes appear that everything is long forgotten, the act is lost and the acquittal is complete. An initiate will not believe this. No act is lost, there is no forgetting in court. One day - nobody expects it - some judge takes the case more carefully in his hands, realizes that the prosecution is still alive in this case, and orders the immediate arrest. I assumed here that a long time passed between the apparent acquittal and the new arrest, that's possible, and I know of such cases, but it's just as possible that the acquitted person comes home from the court and officers are already waiting there, to arrest him again. Then, of course, free life is over.' 'And the trial begins again?' asked K., almost incredulous. 'Indeed,' said the painter, 'the trial begins again, but there is again the possibility, as before, of obtaining an apparent acquittal. You have to gather all your strength again and not surrender.' The painter said the latter, perhaps under the impression that K., who had slumped a little, was making on him. 'But' asked K., as if he wanted to forestall any revelations by the painter, 'isn't it more difficult to obtain a second acquittal than the first one?' Do you mean that the judges will be influenced by the second arrest in their judgment in favor of the accused? That's not the case. The judges already provided for this arrest when they were acquitted. So this fact has little effect. However, for innumerable other reasons, the mood of the judges and their legal assessment of the case may have changed, and the efforts to obtain the second acquittal must therefore be adapted to the changed circumstances and generally be just as vigorous as those prior to the first acquittal.” ""But this second acquittal isn't final,"" said K., turning his head dismissively. “Of course not,” said the painter, “the second acquittal is followed by the third arrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrest, and so on. That's in the very concept of apparent acquittal.' K. said nothing. 'The apparent acquittal doesn't seem to be to your advantage,' said the painter, 'perhaps deportation would suit you better. Do you want me to explain the essence of kidnapping to you?' K. nodded. The painter had leaned back in his armchair, his nightgown was wide open, he had slipped your hand under it, with which he stroked his chest and sides. 'The procrastination,' said the painter, looking straight ahead for a moment as if he were looking for a completely correct explanation, 'the protraction consists in the fact that the trial is kept at the lowest stage of the trial. In order to achieve this, it is necessary for the accused and the assistant, but especially the assistant, to remain in uninterrupted personal contact with the court. I repeat, this does not require as much effort as obtaining an apparent acquittal, but it does require far greater attention. One must not lose sight of the process, one must go to the judge in question at regular intervals and also on special occasions, and try in every way to keep him friendly; if one does not know the judge personally, one must allow known judges to influence him without giving up direct discussions. If nothing is neglected in this respect, one can assume with sufficient certainty that the trial will not progress beyond its first stage. The trial does not end, but the accused is almost as safe from conviction as if he were free. In contrast to an apparent acquittal, procrastination has the advantage that the future of the accused is less uncertain, he is spared the shock of sudden arrest and need not fear the exertion, perhaps at times when his other circumstances are the least favorable and having to endure the excitement associated with obtaining the apparent acquittal. However, kidnapping has certain disadvantages for the accused that should not be underestimated. I am not thinking here of the fact that the accused is never free here, he is not really that even when he is apparently acquitted. It's another disadvantage. The process cannot stand still without at least apparent reasons for it. Something must therefore happen outwardly in the process. So from time to time different arrangements have to be made, the accused has to be questioned, investigations have to take place and so on. The process must always be turned around in the small circle to which it has been artificially restricted. Of course, this entails certain inconveniences for the accused, but you shouldn't imagine them to be too bad. It's all just superficial, so the interrogations, for example, are very short, if you don't have the time or don't feel like going, you can apologize, you can even give orders to certain judges together for a long time in advance, it's really just a matter of reporting to your judge from time to time since you're a defendant.' Even as he was saying the last few words, K. had slung his coat over his arm and stood up. ""He's getting up!"" someone called immediately outside the door. ""You want to go already?"" asked the painter, who had also gotten up. 'It's certainly the air that drives you from here. It is very embarrassing. I still have a few things to say to you. I had to be very brief. But I hope I made it clear.” “Oh yes,” said K., whose head hurt from the effort he had made to listen. Despite this confirmation, the painter said, summarizing everything again, as if he wanted to give K. some consolation on the way home: ""Both methods have in common that they prevent the accused from being convicted."" ""But they also prevent the actual acquittal,"" said K. quietly, as if he was ashamed to have recognized it. ""You got the gist of it,"" said the painter quickly. K. put his hand on his winter coat, but couldn't even make up his mind to put it on. He would have loved to have packed everything up and gone out into the fresh air with it. The girls couldn't get him to get dressed either, although, prematurely, they called out to each other that he should get dressed. The painter was keen to somehow interpret K.'s mood, so he said: 'You haven't made up your mind about my suggestions. I approve. I would even have advised you not to decide immediately. The advantages and disadvantages are hair-thin. You have to estimate everything carefully. However, one mustn't lose too much time either.' 'I'll be back soon,' said K., who suddenly made up his mind to put on his coat, threw his coat over his shoulder and rushed to the door, behind which the girls were now beginning to scream. K. thought he could see the screaming girls through the door. 'But you have to keep your word,' said the painter, who hadn't followed him, 'or I'll come to the bank to ask myself.' 'Unlock the door,' said K. and pulled on the handle, the the girls, as he noticed from the counter-pressure, were kept outside. ""Do you want to be bothered by the girls?"" asked the painter. ""You'd better use this exit,"" and he pointed to the door behind the bed. K. agreed and jumped back to the bed. But instead of opening the door there, the painter crawled under the bed and asked from below: “Just a moment; Wouldn't you like to see another painting that I could sell you?' K. didn't want to be impolite, the painter had really taken care of him and promised to continue to help him, and as a result of K.'s forgetfulness about the payment for the help, he still hadn't hadn't been spoken to at all, so K. couldn't refuse him now and had the picture shown to him, even though he was trembling with impatience to get out of the studio. The painter pulled out a heap of unframed pictures from under the bed, which were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to blow it away from the top picture, it whirled in front of K.'s eyes for a long time, taking his breath away. ""A heathland,"" said the painter and handed the picture to K.. It represented two feeble trees standing far apart in the dark grass. In the background was a multicolored sunset. ""Nice,"" said K., ""I'll buy it."" K. had thoughtlessly made such a brief comment, so he was glad when the painter, instead of taking offense, picked up a second picture from the floor. ""Here is a counterpart to this picture,"" said the painter. It might have been intended as a counterpart, but there wasn't the slightest difference from the first picture, here were the trees, here the grass, and there the sunset. But K. didn't care. ""They are beautiful landscapes,"" he said, ""I'll buy both of them and will hang them up in my office."" ""You seem to like the motif,"" said the painter and brought up a third picture I have another similar picture here.' But it wasn't similar, it was exactly the same heathland. The painter made good use of this opportunity to sell old paintings. ""I'll take this one too,"" said K. ""How much do the three paintings cost?"" ""We'll talk about that next,"" said the painter. 'You're in a hurry now and we'll keep in touch. Besides, I'm glad you like the pictures, I'll give you all the pictures I have down here. It's all heath landscapes, I've painted a lot of heath landscapes. Some people reject paintings like this because they're too somber, but others, and you're one of them, just love the sombre.' But K. now had no sense of the beggar painter's professional experience. ""Pack up all the paintings!"" he called, interrupting the painter's speech, ""my servant will come and fetch them tomorrow."" ""It's not necessary,"" said the painter. ""I hope I can get you a porter who will go with you in a moment."" And at last he bent over the bed and unlocked the door. ""Don't be afraid to climb onto the bed,"" said the painter, ""everyone who comes in here does the same."" K. wouldn't have paid any heed if he hadn't been asked, he had even put one foot in the middle of the duvet, then he saw out through the open door and withdrew his foot again. ""What's that?"" he asked the painter. ""What are you amazed at?"" he asked, amazed in his own right. 'It's the court offices. Didn't you know there are court offices here? Court offices are in almost every attic, why should they be missing here? My studio is also actually one of the court offices, but the court made it available to me.” K. wasn't so shocked that he had found court offices here, he was mainly shocked at himself, at his ignorance of court matters. It seemed to him that a basic rule for the behavior of a defendant was always to be prepared, never to be taken by surprise, not to look to the right unsuspectingly when the judge was standing on his left - and it was precisely this basic rule that he repeatedly broke. In front of him stretched a long corridor, from which blew air that was refreshing compared to the air in the studio. Benches were set up on both sides of the aisle, just like in the waiting room of the office that was responsible for K.. There seemed to be precise regulations for the establishment of chanceries. At the moment there wasn't much party traffic here. A man sat there half lying down, his face buried in his arms on the bench, and seemed to be asleep; another stood in the semidarkness at the end of the aisle. K. now climbed over the bed, the painter followed him with the pictures. They soon met a bailiff - K. already recognized all the bailiffs by the gold button they had on their civilian suit under the usual buttons - and the painter commissioned him to accompany K. with the pictures. K. staggered more as he walked, holding his handkerchief to his mouth. They were already near the exit when the girls rushed towards them, so K. hadn't been spared either. They had evidently seen that the second door of the studio had been opened and had made a detour to get in from that side. ""I can't go with you anymore!"" the painter called out laughing under the rush of girls. ""Goodbye! And don't think too long!' K. didn't even look around at him. In the alley he took the first car that came his way. He was anxious to get rid of the servant whose gold button kept catching his eye, though probably no one else noticed. In his readiness to serve, the servant wanted to sit down on the coach box. But K. chased him down. It was long past noon when K. got to the bank. He would have liked to have left the paintings in the carriage, but he feared that at some point he would be forced to show them to the painter. He therefore had them taken to his office and locked them in the bottom drawer of his desk, in order to keep them safe from the looks of the deputy director for at least the next few days.","This orderly presentation took K. aback at first, but then he said, as quietly as the painter: “I think you’re contradicting yourself.” “How?” the painter asked patiently and leaned back with a smile. This smile made K. feel as if he were trying to reveal contradictions not so much in the words of the painter as in the legal process itself. Nevertheless he did not retreat, but said: “You remarked earlier that the court is impervious to proof; later you restricted this to the public aspect of the court, and now you even claim that an innocent man needs no help at all before the court. That’s a contradiction in itself. Moreover you also stated earlier that judges can be personally influenced, although you now deny that actual acquittal, as you call it, can ever be achieved through personal influence. That’s a second contradiction.” “These contradictions can be easily explained,” said the painter. “We’re talking about two different things here, what the Law says, and what I’ve experienced personally; you mustn’t confuse the two. In the Law, which I’ve never read, mind you, it says of course on the one hand that an innocent person is to be acquitted; on the other hand it does not say that judges can be influenced. My own experience, however, has been precisely the opposite. I know of no actual acquittals but know many instances of influence. Of course it’s possible that in the cases I’m familiar with no one was ever innocent. But doesn’t that seem unlikely? In all those cases not one single innocent person? Even as a child I listened closely to my father when he talked about trials at home, and the judges who came to his atelier discussed the court as well ; in our circles no one talked of anything else; from the moment I was allowed to go to court I attended constantly, heard the crucial stages of innumerable trials, followed them insofar as they could be followed, and— I must admit—I never saw a single actual acquittal.” “Not a single acquittal then,” said K. as if speaking to himself and to his hopes. “That confirms the opinion I’ve already formed of this court. So it has no real point in that respect either. A single hangman could replace the entire court.” “You mustn’t generalize,” said the painter, displeased, “I’ve spoken only of my own experience.” “That’s quite enough,” said K., “or have you heard of acquittals in earlier times?” “Such acquittals are said to have occurred, of course,” said the painter. “But that’s extremely difficult to determine. The final verdicts of the court are not published, and not even the judges have access to them; thus only legends remain about ancient court cases. These tell of actual acquittals, of course, even in a majority of cases; you can believe them, but they can’t be proved true. Nevertheless they shouldn’t be entirely ignored; they surely contain a certain degree of truth, and they are very beautiful; I myself have painted a few pictures based on such legends.” “Mere legends can’t change my opinion,” said K., “I assume these legends can’t be cited in court?” The painter laughed. “No, they can’t,” he said. “Then it’s useless talking about them,” said K.; he was accepting all the painter’s opinions for the time being, even if he considered them improbable and they contradicted other reports. He didn’t have time right now to examine the truth of everything the painter said, let alone to disprove it; the best he could hope for was to induce the painter to help him somehow, even if it was not in any crucial way. So he said: “Let’s leave actual acquittal aside then; you mentioned two further possibilities.” “Apparent acquittal and protraction. It can only be one of those two,” said the painter. “But don’t you want to take off your jacket before we discuss them? You must be hot.” “Yes,” said K., who up to then had been concentrating solely on the painter’s explanations but whose forehead now broke out in heavy sweat as he was reminded of the heat. “It’s almost unbearable.” The painter nodded, as if he could well understand K.’s discomfort. “Couldn’t we open the window?” K. asked. “No,” said the painter. “It’s just a pane of glass set in the wall; it can’t be opened.” K. now realized that he had been hoping the whole time that either the painter or he would suddenly walk to the window and throw it open. He was prepared to inhale even the fog with an open mouth. The sense of being entirely cut off from outside air made him dizzy. He struck the featherbed beside him softly and said in a weak voice: “That’s uncomfortable and unhealthy.” “Oh, no,” said the painter in defense of his window. “Since it can’t be opened, it holds in the heat better than a double-paned window, even though it’s only a single sheet of glass. If I want to air things out, which is hardly necessary, since air comes in through all the cracks between the boards, I can open one of my doors, or even both of them.” Somewhat comforted by this explanation, K. looked around for the second door. The painter noticed this and said: “It’s behind you; I had to block it with the bed.” Only then did K. see the little door in the wall. “This room is really too small for an atelier,” said the painter, as if wishing to forestall a criticism on K.’s part. “I’ve had to arrange things as best I could. Of course the bed is very poorly situated in front of the door. That’s the door the judge I’m currently painting always uses, for example, and I’ve given him a key to it so he can wait for me here in the atelier, even when I’m not at home. But he generally arrives early in the morning while I’m still asleep. Of course I’m always awakened from a sound sleep when the door by the bed opens. You’d lose any respect you have for judges if you could hear the curses I shower on him as he climbs across my bed in the morning. Of course I could take the key away from him, but that would only make matters worse. All the doors here can be torn off their hinges with a minimum of effort.” Throughout these remarks, K. had been debating whether or not to take off his jacket; he finally realized that he wouldn’t be able to stand it much longer if he didn’t, so he removed his jacket, but laid it over his knee so that he could put it back on immediately in case the conversation came to an end. He had barely removed his jacket when one of the girls cried out: “He’s taken off his jacket now,” and they could all be heard rushing to the cracks to see the show for themselves. “The girls think I’m going to paint you and that’s why you’ve taken off your jacket,” said the painter. “I see,” said K., only slightly amused, for he didn’t feel much better than before, even though he was now sitting in his shirtsleeves. Almost grumpily, he asked: “What were the two other possibilities called?” He had already forgotten the terms. “Apparent acquittal and protraction,” said the painter. “The choice is up to you. Both can be achieved with my help, not without an effort of course, the difference in that respect being that apparent acquittal requires a concentrated but temporary effort, while protraction requires a far more modest but continuous one. First, then, apparent acquittal. If that’s what you want, I’ll write out a certification of your innocence on a sheet of paper. The text of such certification was handed down to me by my father and is totally unchallengeable. Then I’ll make the rounds of the judges I know with the certification. Let’s say I start by submitting the certification to the judge I’m painting now, this evening, when he comes for his sitting. I submit the certification to him, explain to him that you’re innocent, and act as a personal guarantor for your innocence. It’s not a mere formality, it’s a truly binding surety.” In the painter’s eyes lay something akin to reproach that K. would place the burden of such a surety upon him. “That would be very kind of you,” said K. “And the judge would believe you and still not actually acquit me?” “Just as I said,” answered the painter. “Nor is it absolutely certain that every judge would believe me; some judge or other, for example, might demand that I bring you to him personally. Then you would have to come along. In that case the battle is already half won, of course, particularly since I’d instruct you carefully in advance how to conduct yourself before the judge in question. Things are more difficult in the case of those judges who turn me away from the very start—and that will happen too. We’ll just have to give up on those, not without trying several times of course, but we can afford that, since individual judges can’t decide the issue. Now when I’ve gathered enough judges’ signatures on the certification, I take it to the judge who’s currently conducting your trial. Perhaps I have his signature already, then things go a little more quickly than usual. In general there aren’t many more obstacles then, that’s the period of highest confidence for the defendant. It’s remarkable but true that people are more confident at this stage than after the acquittal. No further special effort is required. The judge has on the certification the surety of a number of judges; he can acquit you with no second thoughts, and, after going through various formalities, will no doubt do so, to please me and his other acquaintances. You, however, leave the court a free man.” “So then I’m free,” K. said hesitantly. “Yes,” said the painter, “but only apparently free, or more accurately, temporarily free. Judges on the lowest level, and those are the only ones I know, don’t have the power to grant a final acquittal, that power resides only in the highest court, which is totally inaccessible to you and me and everyone else. We don’t know what things look like up there, and incidentally, we don’t want to know. Our judges, then, lack the higher power to free a person from the charge, but they do have the power to release them from it. When you are acquitted in this sense, it means the charge against you is dropped for the moment but continues to hover over you, and can be reinstated the moment an order comes from above. Because I have such a close relationship with the court, I can also explain how the distinction between actual and apparent acquittal reveals itself in purely formal terms in court regulations. In an actual acquittal, the files relating to the case are completely discarded, they disappear totally from the proceedings, not only the charge, but the trial and even the acquittal are destroyed, everything is destroyed. An apparent acquittal is handled differently. There is no further change in the files except for adding to them the certification of innocence, the acquittal, and the grounds for the acquittal. Otherwise they remain in circulation; following the law court’s normal routine they are passed on to the higher courts, come back to the lower ones, swinging back and forth with larger or smaller oscillations, longer or shorter interruptions. These paths are unpredictable. Externally it may sometimes appear that everything has been long since forgotten, the file has been lost, and the acquittal is absolute. No initiate would ever believe that. No file is ever lost, and the court never forgets. Someday—quite unexpectedly—some judge or other takes a closer look at the file, realizes that the case is still active, and orders an immediate arrest. I’m assuming here that a long time has passed between the apparent acquittal and the new arrest; that’s possible, and I know of such cases; but it’s equally possible that the acquitted individual leaves the court, returns home, and finds agents already there, waiting to arrest him again. Then of course his life as a free man is over.” “And the trial begins all over again?” K. asked, almost incredulously. “Of course,” said the painter, “the trial begins all over again, but it is again possible, just as before, to secure an apparent acquittal. You must gather all your strength again and not give up.” Perhaps the painter added this final remark because he had noticed that K. had slumped slightly. “But isn’t effecting a second acquittal more difficult than the first?” K. said, as if he now wished to anticipate any further revelations from the painter. “That can’t be said for certain,” replied the painter. “You mean, I take it, that the judges’ judgment might be unfavorably influenced with regard to the defendant because of the second arrest. That’s not the case. The judges have foreseen this arrest from the moment of the original acquittal. So in fact it has scarcely any effect. But there are no doubt countless other reasons why the judge’s mood as well as his legal opinion on the case may differ, and the efforts for a second acquittal must therefore be adapted to the changed circumstances and be as strong in general as they were for the first acquittal.” “But this second acquittal isn’t final either,” said K., turning his head away coldly. “Of course not,” said the painter, “the second acquittal is followed by a third arrest, the third acquittal by a fourth arrest, and so on. That’s inherent in the very concept of apparent acquittal.” K. was silent. “Apparent acquittal obviously doesn’t strike you as an advantage,” said the painter, “perhaps protraction would suit you better. Shall I explain to you the nature of protraction?” K. nodded. The painter had leaned back expansively in his chair, his nightshirt gaped open, he had shoved a hand inside it and was scratching his chest and sides. “Protraction,” said the painter, gazing straight ahead for a moment, as if searching for a fully accurate explanation, “protraction is when the trial is constantly kept at the lowest stage. To accomplish this the defendant and his helper, in particular his helper, must remain in constant personal contact with the court. I repeat, this doesn’t require the same effort it takes to secure an apparent acquittal, but it does require a much higher level of vigilance. You can’t let the trial out of your sight; you have to visit the relevant judge at regular intervals, and any extra chance you get as well, and try to keep him as well disposed as possible in all ways; if you don’t know the judge personally, you have to try to influence him through judges you do know, although you still don’t dare dispense with the direct conferences. If nothing is omitted in this respect, you can be sufficiently assured that the trial will never progress beyond its initial stage. The trial doesn’t end of course, but the defendant is almost as safe from a conviction as he would be as a free man. Compared with apparent acquittal, protraction offers the advantage that the defendant’s future is less uncertain; he’s spared the shock of sudden arrests, and he doesn’t have to worry, at what may be precisely the worst time in terms of other circumstances, about taking on the stress and strain connected with securing an apparent acquittal. Of course protraction also has certain disadvantages for the accused that must not be underestimated. I don’t mean the fact that the defendant is never free; he’s not free in a true sense in the case of an apparent acquittal either. It’s a different sort of disadvantage. The trial can’t come to a standstill without some reason that’s at least plausible. So something must happen outwardly in the trial. Therefore various measures must be taken from time to time, the defendant has to be interrogated, inquiries conducted, and so forth. The trial must be kept constantly spinning within the tight circle to which it’s artificially restricted. Of course that involves certain inconveniences for the defendant, which on the other hand you mustn’t imagine as all that bad. After all, it’s a merely formal matter; for example the interrogations are quite brief; if you don’t have the time or inclination to attend you can excuse yourself; with certain judges you can even set up a long-term schedule together in advance; in essence it’s merely a matter of reporting to your judge from time to time, since you’re a defendant.” Even as these last words were being spoken, K. placed his jacket over his arm and rose. “He’s standing up already,” came an immediate cry from beyond the door. “Are you leaving so soon?” asked the painter, who had risen as well. “It must be the air here that’s driving you away. I feel terrible about that. There was more I wanted to tell you. I had to sum things up briefly. But I hope it was all clear.” “Oh, yes,” said K., whose head ached from the effort he had made to force himself to listen. In spite of this assurance, the painter summed things up again, as if offering K. a word of comfort for the journey home: “Both methods have this in common: they prevent the accused from being convicted.” “But they also prevent an actual acquittal,” said K. softly, as if ashamed of the realization. “You’ve grasped the heart of the matter,” the painter said quickly. K. placed his hand on his winter coat, but he couldn’t even make up his mind to put on his jacket. He would have preferred to bundle them both up and rush out into the fresh air with them. The girls couldn’t get him to put them on either, even though they called out to one another prematurely that he was doing so. The painter wished to get some sense of K.’s thoughts, so he said: “You probably still haven’t reached a decision with regard to my suggestions. I approve of that. In fact I would have advised against a quick decision. There’s only a hair’s difference between the advantages and disadvantages. Everything has to be weighed quite carefully. Of course you don’t want to lose too much time either.” “I’ll come again soon,” said K., who, making an abrupt decision, put on his jacket, threw his coat over his shoulders, and hastened to the door, behind which the girls now began to shriek. K. felt as if he could see the shrieking girls through the door. “But you have to keep your word,” said the painter, who hadn’t followed him, “otherwise I’ll come to the bank myself to inquire about it.” “Unlock the door, will you,” said K., pulling at the handle, which the girls, as he could tell from the counterpressure, were holding tight from the outside. “Do you want the girls bothering you?” asked the painter. “Why don’t you use this way out instead?” and he pointed to the door behind the bed. That was fine with K., and he sprang back to the bed. But instead of opening the door, the painter crawled under the bed and asked from below: “Just a minute. Wouldn’t you like to see a painting I could sell you?” K. didn’t wish to be impolite; the painter really had taken his side and promised continued help, and due to K.’s own forgetfulness there had been no discussion of how K. might reimburse him for his help, so K. couldn’t deny him now; he let him show his picture, even though he was trembling with impatience to leave the atelier. From beneath the bed the painter dragged a pile of unframed paintings so deeply covered in dust that when the painter tried to blow it away from the one on top, the dust whirled up before K.’s eyes, and for some time he could scarcely breathe. “A landscape of the heath,” said the painter, and handed K. the painting. It showed two frail trees, standing at a great distance from one another in the dark grass. In the background was a multicolored sunset. “Nice,” said K., “I’ll buy it.” K. had spoken curtly without thinking, so he was glad when, instead of taking it badly, the painter picked up another painting from the floor. “Here’s a companion piece to that picture,” said the painter. It may have been intended as a companion piece, but not the slightest difference could be seen between it and the first one: here were the trees, here was the grass, and there the sunset. But that made little difference to K. “They’re nice landscapes,” he said, “I’ll take both of them and hang them in my office.” “You seem to like the subject,” said the painter, and pulled out a third painting, “luckily enough , I have a similar one right here.” It was not merely similar, however, it was exactly the same landscape. The painter was taking full advantage of the chance to sell his old pictures. “I’ll take that one too,” said K. “What do I owe you for the three of them?” “We’ll talk about that next time,” said the painter, “you’re in a hurry now and we’ll be keeping in touch, after all. By the way, I’m glad you like the paintings; I’ll throw in all the pictures I have under here. They’re all heath landscapes, I’ve painted a lot of heath landscapes. Some people are put off by paintings like these because they’re too somber, but others, and you’re among them, have a particular love for the somber.” But K. was in no mood to discuss the mendicant artist’s professional life just then. “Pack up all the paintings,” he cried, interrupting the painter, “my assistant will come by tomorrow and pick them up.” “That’s not necessary,” said the painter. “I think I can find a porter to go with you now.” And at last he leaned across the bed and opened the door. “Don’t be shy about stepping on the bed,” said the painter, “everyone who comes in this way does.” K. wouldn’t have worried about it even without being told; he’d already put his foot in the middle of the featherbed; then he looked through the open door and drew his foot back again. “What’s that?” he asked the painter. “What do you find so surprising?” he asked, himself surprised. “Those are the law court offices. Didn’t you know there were law court offices here? There are law court offices in practically every attic, why shouldn’t they be here too? In fact my atelier is part of the law court offices too, but the court has placed it at my disposal.” K. wasn’t so shocked at having found law court offices here; he was more shocked at himself, at his ignorance when it came to the court. It seemed to him a basic rule of behavior that the defendant should always be prepared, never be caught by surprise, never be looking blankly to the right when a judge was standing on his left—and it was precisely this basic rule that he was constantly breaking. A long corridor stretched before him, from which air drifted that made the air in the atelier seem refreshing by comparison. Benches stood on both sides of the hall, just as in the waiting room of K.’s court offices. There seemed to be precise guidelines for the furnishings of these offices. There weren’t many parties there at the moment. A man sat there, half reclining; he had buried his face in his arm and seemed to be sleeping; another stood in semidarkness at the end of the hallway. K. now stepped across the bed; the painter followed him with the pictures. They soon met a court usher—K. had already learned to recognize the court ushers by the gold button they wore among the ordinary buttons on their civilian suits—and the painter instructed him to follow K. with the pictures. K. swayed rather than walked, with his handkerchief pressed to his mouth. They had almost reached the exit when the girls, from whom K. was not to be spared after all, stormed toward them. They had evidently seen the other door of the atelier being opened and had made a detour to force their way in from this side. “I can’t accompany you any farther,” said the painter, laughing beneath the press of girls. “Goodbye! And don’t take too long thinking about it!” K. didn’t even look back. On the street he took the first cab that came his way. He was anxious to be rid of the usher, whose gold button kept catching his eye, even though no one else probably noticed it. In his eagerness to serve, the usher even tried to take a seat on the coachbox, but K. chased him down. It was long past noon when K. arrived at the bank. He would have liked to leave the paintings in the cab, but he was afraid he might have to account for them to the painter at some point. So he ordered them taken into his office and locked them in the bottom drawer of his desk, to store them safely away from the vice president’s eyes for at least the next few days.","This lucid explanation took K. aback at first, but he replied in the same subdued voice as the painter: ""It seems to me that you're contradicting yourself."" ""In what way?"" asked the painter patiently, leaning back with a smile. The smile awoke in K. a suspicion that he was now about to expose contradictions not so much in the painter's statements as in the Court procedure itself. However, he did not retreat, but went on: ""You made the assertion earlier that the Court is impervious to proof, later you qualified that assertion by confining it to the public sessions of the Court, and now you actually say that an innocent man requires no help before the Court. That alone implies a contradiction. But, in addition, you said at first that the Judges can be moved by personal intervention, and now you deny that definite acquittal, as you call it, can ever be achieved by personal intervention. In that lies the second contradiction."" ""These contradictions are easy to explain,"" said the painter. ""We must distinguish between two things: what is written in the Law, and what I have discovered through personal experience; you must not confuse the two. In the code of the Law, which admittedly I have not read, it is of course laid down on the one hand that the innocent shall be acquitted, but it is not stated on the other hand that the Judges are open to influence. Now, my experience is diametrically opposed to that. I have not met one case of definite acquittal, and I have met many cases of influential intervention. It is possible, of course, that in all the cases known to me there was none in which the accused was really innocent. But is not that improbable? Among so many cases no single case of innocence? Even as a child I used to listen carefully to my father when he spoke of cases he had heard about; the Judges, too, who came to his studio were always telling stories about the Court, in our circle it is in fact the sole topic of discussion; no sooner did I get the chance to attend the Court myself than I took full advantage of it; I have listened to countless cases in their most crucial stages, and followed them as far as they could be followed, and yet -- I must admit it -- I have never encountered one case of definite acquittal."" ""Not one case of acquittal, then,"" said K. as if he were speaking to himself and his hopes, ""but that merely confirms the opinion that I have already formed of this Court. It is a pointless institution from any point of view. A single executioner could do all that is needed."" ""You mustn't generalize,"" said the painter in displeasure. ""I have only quoted my own experience."" ""That's quite enough,"" said K. ""Or have you ever heard of acquittals in earlier times?"" ""Such acquittals,"" replied the painter, ""are said to have occurred. Only it is very difficult to prove the fact. The final decisions of the Court are never recorded, even the Judges can't get hold of them, consequently we have only legendary accounts of ancient cases. These legends certainly provide instances of acquittal; actually the majority of them are about acquittals, they can be believed, but they cannot be proved. All the same, they shouldn't be entirely left out of account, they must have an element of truth in them, and besides they are very beautiful. I myself have painted several pictures founded on such legends."" ""Mere legends cannot alter my opinion, said K., ""and I fancy that one cannot appeal to such legends before the Court? "" The painter laughed. "" No, one can't do that,"" he said. ""Then there's no use talking about them,"" said K., willing for the time being to accept the painter's opinions, even where they seemed improbable or contradicted other reports he had heard. He had no time now to inquire into the truth of all the painter said, much less contradict it, the utmost he could hope to do was to get the man to help him in some way, even should the help prove inconclusive. Accordingly he said: ""Let us leave definite acquittal out of account, then; you mentioned two other possibilities as well."" ""Ostensible acquittal and postponement. These are the only possibilities,"" said the painter. ""But won't you take off your jacket before we go on to speak of them? You look very hot."" ""Yes,"" said K., who had been paying no attention to anything but the painter's expositions, but now that he was reminded of the heat found his forehead drenched in sweat. ""It's almost unbearable."" The painter nodded as if he comprehended K.'s discomfort quite well. ""Couldn't we open the window? "" asked K. "" No,"" replied the painter. ""It's only a sheet of glass let into the roof, it can't be opened. "" Now K. realized that he had been hoping all the time that either the painter or he himself would suddenly go over to the window and fling it open. He was prepared to gulp down even mouthfuls of fog if be could only get air. The feeling of being completely cut off from the fresh air made his head swim. He brought the flat of his hand down on the feather bed and said in a feeble voice: ""That's both uncomfortable and unhealthy."" ""Oh, no,"" said the painter in defense of his window. ""Because it's hermetically sealed it keeps the warmth in much better than a double window, though it's only a simple pane of glass. And if I want to air the place, which isn't really necessary, for the air comes in everywhere through the chinks, I can always open one of the doors or even both of them."" Somewhat reassured by this explanation, K. glanced round to discover the second door. The painter saw what he was doing and said: ""It's behind you, I had to block it up by putting the bed in front of it."" Only now did K. see the little door in the wall. "" This is really too small for a studio,"" said the painter, as if to forestall K.'s criticisms. ""I had to manage as best I could. Of course it's a bad place for a bed, just in front of that door. The Judge whom I'm painting just now, for instance, always comes in by that door, and I've had to give him a key for it so that he can wait for me in the studio if I happen to be out. Well, he usually arrives early in the morning, while I'm still asleep. And of course however fast asleep I am , it wakes me with a start when the door behind my bed suddenly opens. You would lose any respect you have for the Judges if you could hear the curses that welcome him when he climbs over my bed in the early morning. I could certainly take the key away from him again, but that would only make things worse. It is easy enough to burst open any of the doors here. "" All during these exchanges K. kept considering whether he should take off his jacket, but at last he realized that if he did not he would be incapable of staying any longer in the room, so he took it off, laying it, however, across his knee, to save time in putting it on again whenever the interview was finished. Scarcely had he taken off his jacket when one of the girls cried: ""He's taken off his jacket now,"" and he could hear them all crowding to peer through the cracks and view the spectacle for themselves. "" The girls think,"" said the painter, ""that I'm going to paint your portrait and that's why you are taking off your jacket."" ""I see,"" said K., very little amused, for he did not feel much better than before, although he was now sitting in his shirt-sleeves. Almost morosely he asked: ""What did you say the other two possibilities were?"" He had already forgotten what they were called. "" Ostensible acquittal and indefinite postponement,"" said the painter. ""It lies with you to choose between them. I can help you to either of them, though not without taking some trouble, and, as far as that is concerned, the difference between them is that ostensible acquittal demands temporary concentration, while postponement taxes your strength less but means a steady strain. First, then, let us take ostensible acquittal. If you decide on that, I shall write down on a sheet of paper an affidavit of your innocence. The text for such an affidavit has been handed down to me by my father and is unassailable. Then with this affidavit I shall make a round of the Judges I know, beginning, let us say, with the Judge I am painting now, when he comes for his sitting tonight. I shall lay the affidavit before him, explain to him that you are innocent, and guarantee your innocence myself. And that is not merely a formal guarantee but a real and binding one. "" In the eyes of the painter there was a faint suggestion of reproach that K. should lay upon him the burden of such a responsibility. ""That would be very kind of you,"" said K. ""And the Judge would believe you and yet not give me a definite acquittal?"" ""As I have already explained,"" replied the painter. ""Besides, it is not in the least certain that every Judge will believe me; some Judges, for instance, will ask to see you in person. And then I should have to take you with me to call on them. Though when that happens the battle is already half won, particularly as I should tell you beforehand, of course, exactly what line to take with each Judge. The real difficulty comes with the Judges who turn me away at the start -- and that's sure to happen too. I shall go on petitioning them, of course, but we shall have to do without them, though one can afford to do that, since dissent by individual Judges cannot affect the result. Well then, if I get a sufficient number of Judges to subscribe to the affidavit, I shall then deliver it to the Judge who is actually conducting your trial. Possibly I may have secured his signature too, then everything will be settled fairly soon, a little sooner than usual. Generally speaking, there should be no difficulties worth mentioning after that, the accused at this stage feels supremely confident. Indeed it's remarkable, but true, that people's confidence mounts higher at this stage than after their acquittal. There's no need for them to do much more. The Judge is covered by the guarantees of the other Judges subscribing to the affidavit, and so he can grant an acquittal with an easy mind, and though some formalities will remain to he settled, he will undoubtedly grant the acquittal to please me and his other friends. Then you can walk out of the Court a free man."" ""So then I'm free,"" said K. doubtfully. "" Yes,"" said the painter, ""but only ostensibly free, or more exactly, provisionally free. For the Judges of the lowest grade, to whom my acquaintances belong, haven't the power to grant a final acquittal, that power is reserved for the highest Court of all, which is quite inaccessible to you, to me, and to all of us. What the prospects are up there we do not know and, I may say in passing, do not even want to know. The great privilege, then, of absolving from guilt our Judges do not possess, but they do have the right to take the burden of the charge off your shoulders. That is to say, when you are acquitted in this fashion the charge is lifted from your shoulders for the time being, but it continues to hover above you and can, as soon as an order comes from on high, be laid upon you again. As my connection with the Court is such a close one, I can also tell you how in the regulations of the Law Court offices the distinction between definite and ostensible acquittal is made manifest. In definite acquittal the documents relating to the case are said to be completely annulled, they simply vanish from sight, not only the charge but also the records of the case and even the acquittal are destroyed, everything is destroyed. That's not the case with ostensible acquittal. The documents remain as they were, except that the affidavit is added to them and a record of the acquittal and the grounds for granting it. The whole dossier continues to circulate, as the regular official routine demands, passing on to the higher Courts, being referred to the lower ones again, and thus swinging backwards and forwards with greater or smaller oscillations, longer or shorter delays. These peregrinations are incalculable. A detached observer might sometimes fancy that the whole case had been forgotten, the documents lost, and the acquittal made absolute. No one really acquainted with the Court could think such a thing. No document is ever lost, the Court never forgets anything. One day -- quite unexpectedly -- some Judge will take up the documents and look at them attentively, recognize that in this case the charge is still valid, and order an immediate arrest. I have been speaking on the assumption that a long time elapses between the ostensible acquittal and the new arrest; that is possible and I have known of such cases, but it is just as possible for the acquitted man to go straight home from the Court and find officers already waiting to arrest him again. Then, of course, all his freedom is at an end."" ""And the case begins all over again?"" asked K. almost incredulously. "" Certainly,"" said the painter. ""The case begins all over again, but again it is possible, just as before, to secure an ostensible acquittal. One must again apply all one's energies to the case and never give in. "" These last words were probably uttered because he noticed that K. was looking somewhat collapsed. ""But,"" said K., as if he wanted to forestall any more revelations, ""isn't the engineering of a second acquittal more difficult than the first?"" ""On that point,"" said the painter, ""one can say nothing with certainty. You mean, I take it, that the second arrest might influence the Judges against the accused? That is not so. Even while they are pronouncing the first acquittal the Judges foresee the possibility of the new arrest. Such a consideration, therefore, hardly comes into question. But it may happen, for hundreds of reasons, that the Judges are in a different frame of mind about the case, even from a legal viewpoint, and one's efforts to obtain a second acquittal must consequently be adapted to the changed circumstances, and in general must be every whit as energetic as those that secured tie first one."" ""But this second acquittal isn't final either,"" said K., turning away his head in repudiation. ""Of course not,"" said the painter. ""The second acquittal is followed by the third arrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrest, and so on. That is implied in the very conception of ostensible acquittal."" K. said nothing. "" Ostensible acquittal doesn't seem to appeal to you,"" said the painter. ""Perhaps postponement would suit you better. Shall I explain to you how postponement works?"" K. nodded. The painter was lolling back in his chair, his nightshirt gaped open, he had thrust one hand inside it and was lightly fingering his breast. ""Postponement,"" he said, gazing in front of him for a moment as if seeking a completely accurate explanation, ""postponement consists in preventing the case from ever getting any further than its first stages. To achieve that it is necessary for the accused and his agent, but more particularly his agent, to remain continuously in personal touch with the Court. Let me point out again that this does not demand such intense concentration of one's energies as an ostensible acquittal, yet on the other hand it does require far greater vigilance. You daren't let the case out of your sight, you visit the Judge at regular intervals as well as in emergencies and must do all that is in your power to keep him friendly; if you don't know the Judge personally, then you must try to influence him through other Judges whom you do know, hut without giving up your efforts to secure a personal interview. If you neglect none of these things, then you can assume with fair certainty that the case will never pass beyond its first stages. Not that the proceedings are quashed, but the accused is almost as likely to escape sentence as if he were free. As against ostensible acquittal postponement has this advantage, that the future of the accused is less uncertain, he is secured from the terrors of sudden arrest and doesn't need to fear having to undergo -- perhaps at a most inconvenient moment -- the strain and agitation which are inevitable in the achievement of ostensible acquittal. Though postponement, too, has certain drawbacks for the accused, and these must not be minimized. In saying this I am not thinking of the fact that the accused is never free; he isn't free either, in any real sense, after the ostensible acquittal. There are other drawbacks. The case can't be held up indefinitely without at least some plausible grounds being provided. So as a matter of form a certain activity must be shown from time to time, various measures have to be taken, the accused is questioned, evidence is collected, and so on. For the case must be kept going all the time, although only in the small circle to which it has been artificially restricted. This naturally involves the accused in occasional unpleasantness, but you must not think of it as being too unpleasant. For it's all a formality, the interrogations, for instance, are only short ones; if you have neither the time nor the inclination to go, you can excuse yourself; with some Judges you can even plan your interviews a long time ahead, all that it amounts to is a formal recognition of your status as an accused man by regular appearances before your Judge."" Already while these last words were being spoken K. had taken his jacket across his arm and got up. "" He's getting up now,"" came the cry at once from behind the door. ""Are you going already?"" asked the painter, who had also got up. ""I'm sure it's the air here that is driving you away. I'm sorry about it. I had a great deal more to tell you. I have had to express myself very briefly. But I hope my statements were lucid enough."" ""Oh, yes,"" said K., whose head was aching with the strain of forcing himself to listen. In spite of K.'s confirmation, the painter went on to sum up the matter again, as if to give him a last word of comfort: ""Both methods have this in common, that they prevent the accused from coming up for sentence."" ""But they also prevent an actual acquittal,"" said K. in a low voice, as if embarrassed by his own perspicacity. ""You have grasped the kernel of the matter,"" said the painter quickly. K. laid his hand on his overcoat, but could not even summon the resolution to put on his jacket. He would have liked best of all to bundle them both together and rush out with them into the fresh air. Even the thought of the girls could not move him to put on his garments, although their voices were already piping the premature news that he was doing so. The painter was anxious to guess K.'s intentions, so he said: ""I take it that you haven't come to any decision yet on my suggestions. That's right. In fact, I should have advised you against it had you attempted an immediate decision. It's like splitting hairs to distinguish the advantages and disadvantages. You must weigh everything very carefully. On the other hand you mustn't lose too much time either."" ""I'll come back again soon,"" said K., in a sudden fit of resolution putting on his jacket, flinging his overcoat across his shoulders, and hastening to the door, behind which the girls at once began shrieking. K. felt he could almost see them through the door. ""But you must keep your word,"" said the painter, who had not followed him, ""or else I'll have to come to the Bank myself to make inquiries."" ""Unlock this door, will you?"" said K., tugging at the handle, which the girls, as he could tell from the resistance, were hanging on to from outside. ""You don't want to be bothered by the girls, do you?"" asked the painter. ""You had better take this way out,"" and he indicated the door behind the bed. K. was perfectly willing and rushed back to the bed. But instead of opening the bedside door the painter crawled right under the bed and said from down there: "" Wait just a minute. Wouldn't you like to see a picture or two that you might care to buy?"" K. did not want to be discourteous, the painter had really taken an interest in him and promised to help him further, also it was entirely owing to K.'s distractedness that the matter of a fee for the painter's services had not been mentioned, consequently he could not turn aside his offer now, and so he consented to look at the pictures, though he was trembling with impatience to be out of the place. Titorelli dragged a pile of unframed canvases from under the bed; they were so thickly covered with dust that when he blew some of it from the topmost, K. was almost blinded and choked by the cloud that flew up. "" Wild Nature, a heathscape,"" said the painter, handing K. the picture. It showed two stunted trees standing far apart from each other in darkish grass. In the background was a many-hued sunset. ""Fine,"" said K., ""I'll buy it."" K.'s curtness had been unthinking and so he was glad when the painter, instead of being offended, lifted another canvas from the floor. ""Here's the companion picture,"" he said. It might be intended as a companion picture, but there was not the slightest difference that one could see between it and the other, here were the two trees, here the grass, and there the sunset. But K. did not bother about that. ""They're fine prospects,"" he said. ""I'll buy both of them and hang them up in my office."" ""You seem to like the subject,"" said the painter, fishing out a third canvas. "" By a lucky chance I have another of these studies here. "" But it was not merely a similar study, it was simply the same wild heathscape again. The painter was apparently exploiting to the full this opportunity to sell off his old pictures. ""I'll take that one as well,"" said K. ""How much for the three pictures?"" ""We'll settle that next time,"" said the painter. ""You're in a hurry today and we're going to keep in touch with each other anyhow. I may say I'm very glad you like these pictures and I'll throw in all the others under the bed as well. They're heathscapes every one of them , I've painted dozens of them in my time. Some people won't have anything to do with these subjects because they're too somber, but there are always people like yourself who prefer somber pictures."" But by now K. had no mind to listen to the professional pronouncements of the peddling painter. ""Wrap the pictures up,"" he cried, interrupting Titorelli's garrulity, ""my attendant will call tomorrow and fetch them."" ""That isn't necessary,"" said the painter. ""I think I can manage to get you a porter to take them along with you now."" And at last he reached over the bed and unlocked the door. ""Don't be afraid to step on the bed,"" he said. ""Everybody who comes here does that. "" K. would not have hesitated to do it even without his invitation, he had actually set one foot plump on the middle of the feather bed, but when he looked out through the open door he drew his foot back again. ""What's this?"" he asked the painter. ""What are you surprised at?"" returned the painter, surprised in his turn. ""These are the Law Court offices. Didn't you know that there were Law Court offices here? There are Law Court offices in almost every attic, why should this be an exception? My studio really belongs to the Law Court offices, but the Court has put it at my disposal. "" It was not so much the discovery of the Law Court offices that startled K.; he was much more startled at himself, at his complete ignorance of all things concerning the Court. He accepted it as a fundamental principle for an accused man to be always forearmed, never to let himself be caught napping, never to let his eyes stray unthinkingly to the right when his judge was looming up on the left -- and against that very principle he kept offending again and again. Before him stretched a long passage, from which was wafted an air compared to which the air in the studio was refreshing. Benches stood on either side of the passage, just as in the lobby of the offices that were handling K.'s case. There seemed, then, to be exact regulations for the interior disposition of these offices. At the moment there was no great coming and going of clients. A man was half sitting, half reclining on a bench, his face was buried in his arms and he seemed to be asleep; another man was standing in the dusk at the end of the passage. K. now stepped over the bed, the painter following him with the pictures. They soon found an usher -- by this time K. recognized these men from the gold button added to the buttons on their ordinary civilian clothing-- and the painter gave him instructions to accompany K. with the pictures. K. tottered rather than walked, keeping his handkerchief pressed to his mouth. They had almost reached the exit when the girls came rushing to meet them, so K. had not been spared even that encounter. The girls had obviously seen the second door of the studio opening and had made a detour at full speed, in order to get in. ""I can't escort you any farther,"" cried the painter laughingly, as the girls surrounded him. "" Till our next meeting. And don't take too long to think it over K. did not even look back. When he reached the street he hailed the first cab that came along. He must get rid of the usher, whose gold button offended his eyes, even though, likely enough, they escaped everyone else's attention. The usher, zealously dutiful, got up beside the coachman on the box, but K. made him get down again. Midday was long past when K. reached the Bank. He would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab, but was afraid that some day he might be required to recall himself to the painter by their means. So he had them carried into his office and locked them in the bottom drawer of his desk, to save them for the next few days at least from the eyes of the Assistant Manager.","At first, K. was astonished at this orderly explanation, but then, just as quietly as the painter, he said, “I think you're contradicting yourself.” “How's that?” asked the painter patiently, leaning back with a smile. This smile made K. feel as if he were examining not the words of the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedures of the court itself. Nonetheless, he continued unabashed and said, “You remarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasoned proofs, you later restricted this to the open court, and now you go so far as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court. That entails a contradiction. Moreover, you said earlier that the judges can be influenced personally but now you insist that an absolute acquittal, as you call it, can never be attained through personal influence. That entails a second contradiction.” “It's quite easy to clear up these contradictions,” said the painter. “We're talking about two different things here, there's what it says in the law and there's what I know from my own experience , you shouldn't get the two confused. I've never seen it in writing, but the law does, of course, say on the one hand that the innocent will be set free, but on the other hand it doesn't say that the judges can be influenced. But in my experience it's the other way round. I don't know of any absolute acquittals but I do know of many times when a judge has been influenced. It's possible, of course, that there was no innocence in any of the cases I know about. But is that likely? Not a single innocent defendant in so many cases? When I was a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us about court cases at home, and the judges that came to his studio talked about the court, in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I hardly ever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of it when I could, I've listened to countless trials at important stages in their development, I've followed them closely as far as they could be followed, and I have to say that I've never seen a single acquittal.” “So. Not a single acquittal,” said K., as if talking to himself and his hopes. “That confirms the impression I already have of the court. So there's no point in it from this side either. They could replace the whole court with a single hangman.” “You shouldn't generalise,” said the painter, dissatisfied, “I've only been talking about my own experience.” “Well that's enough,” said K., “or have you heard of any acquittals that happened earlier?” “They say there have been some acquittals earlier,” the painter answered, “but it's very hard to be sure about it. The courts don't make their final conclusions public, not even the judges are allowed to know about them, so that all we know about these earlier cases are just legends. But most of them did involve absolute acquittals, you can believe that, but they can't be proved. On the other hand, you shouldn't forget all about them either, I'm sure there is some truth to them, and they are very beautiful, I've painted a few pictures myself depicting these legends.” “My assessment will not be altered by mere legends,” said K. “I don't suppose it's possible to cite these legends in court, is it?” The painter laughed. “No, you can't cite them in court,” he said. “Then there's no point in talking about them,” said K., he wanted, for the time being, to accept anything the painter told him, even if he thought it unlikely or contradicted what he had been told by others. He did not now have the time to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even to disprove it, he would have achieved as much as he could if the painter would help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive. As a result, he said, “So let's pay no more attention to absolute acquittal, but you mentioned two other possibilities.” “Apparent acquittal and deferment. They're the only possibilities,” said the painter. “But before we talk about them, would you not like to take your coat off? You must be hot.” “Yes,” said K., who until then had paid attention to nothing but the painter's explanations, but now that he had had the heat pointed out to him his brow began to sweat heavily. “It's almost unbearable.” The painter nodded as if he understood K.'s discomfort very well. “Could we not open the window?” asked K. “No,” said the painter. “It's only a fixed pane of glass, it can't be opened.” K. now realised that all this time he had been hoping the painter would suddenly go over to the window and pull it open. He had prepared himself even for the fog that he would breathe in through his open mouth. The thought that here he was entirely cut off from the air made him feel dizzy. He tapped lightly on the bedspread beside him and, with a weak voice, said, “That is very inconvenient and unhealthy.” “Oh no,” said the painter in defence of his window, “as it can't be opened this room retains the heat better than if the window were double glazed, even though it's only a single pane. There's not much need to air the room as there's so much ventilation through the gaps in the wood, but when I do want to I can open one of my doors, or even both of them.” K. was slightly consoled by this explanation and looked around to see where the second door was. The painter saw him do so and said, “It's behind you, I had to hide it behind the bed.” Only then was K. able to see the little door in the wall. “It's really much too small for a studio here,” said the painter, as if he wanted to anticipate an objection K. would make. “I had to arrange things as well as I could. That's obviously a very bad place for the bed, in front of the door. For instance when the judge I'm painting at present comes he always comes through the door by the bed, and I've even given him a key to this door so that he can wait for me here in the studio when I'm not home. Although nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when I'm still asleep. And of course, it always wakes me up when I hear the door opened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am. If you could hear the way I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning you'd lose all respect for judges. I suppose I could take the key away from him but that'd only make things worse. It only takes a tiny effort to break any of the doors here off their hinges.” All the time the painter was speaking, K. was considering whether he should take off his coat, but he finally realised that, if he didn't do so, he would be quite unable to stay here any longer, so he took off his frock coat and lay it on his knee so that he could put it back on again as soon as the conversation was over. He had hardly done this when one of the girls called out, “Now he's taken his coat off!” and they could all be heard pressing around the gaps in the planks to see the spectacle for themselves. “The girls think I'm going to paint your portrait,” said the painter, “and that's why you're taking your coat off.” “I see,” said K., only slightly amused by this, as he felt little better than he had before even though he now sat in his shirtsleeves. With some irritation he asked, “What did you say the two other possibilities were?” He had already forgotten the terms used. “Apparent acquittal and deferment,” said the painter. “It's up to you which one you choose. You can get either of them if I help you, but it'll take some effort of course, the difference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentrated effort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it has to be sustained. Now then, apparent acquittal. If that's what you want I'll write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of paper. The text for an assertion of this sort was passed down to me from my father and it's quite unassailable. I take this assertion round to the judges I know. So I'll start off with the one I'm currently painting, and put the assertion to him when he comes for his sitting this evening. I'll lay the assertion in front of him, explain that you're innocent and give him my personal guarantee of it. And that's not just a superficial guarantee, it's a real one and it's binding.” The painter's eyes seemed to show some reproach of K. for wanting to impose that sort of responsibility on him. “That would be very kind of you"", said K. “And would the judge then believe you and nonetheless not pass an absolute acquittal?” “It's like I just said,” answered the painter. “And anyway, it's not entirely sure that all the judges would believe me, many of them, for instance, might want me to bring you to see them personally. So then you'd have to come along too. But at least then, if that happens, the matter is half way won, especially as I'd teach you in advance exactly how you'd need to act with the judge concerned, of course. What also happens, though, is that there are some judges who'll turn me down in advance, and that's worse. I'll certainly make several attempts, but still, we'll have to forget about them, but at least we can afford to do that as no one judge can pass the decisive verdict. Then when I've got enough judges' signatures on this document I take it to the judge who's concerned with your case. I might even have his signature already, in which case things develop a bit quicker than they would do otherwise. But there aren't usually many hold ups from then on, and that's the time that the defendant can feel most confident. It's odd, but true, that people feel more confidence in this time than they do after they've been acquitted. There's no particular exertion needed now. When he has the document asserting the defendant's innocence, guaranteed by a number of other judges, the judge can acquit you without any worries, and although there are still several formalities to be gone through there's no doubt that that's what he'll do as a favour to me and several other acquaintances. You, however, walk out the court and you're free.” “So, then I'll be free,” said K., hesitantly. “That's right,” said the painter, “but only apparently free or, to put it a better way, temporarily free, as the most junior judges, the ones I know, they don't have the right to give the final acquittal. Only the highest judge can do that, in the court that's quite of reach for you, for me and for all of us. We don't know how things look there and, incidentally, we don't want to know. The right to acquit people is a major privilege and our judges don't have it, but they do have the right to free people from the indictment. That's to say, if they're freed in this way then for the time being the charge is withdrawn but it's still hanging over their heads and it only takes an order from higher up to bring it back into force. And as I'm in such good contact with the court I can also tell you how the difference between absolute and apparent acquittal is described, just in a superficial way, in the directives to the court offices. If there's an absolute acquittal all proceedings should stop, everything disappears from the process, not just the indictment but the trial and even the acquittal disappears, everything just disappears. With an apparent acquittal it's different. When that happens, nothing has changed except that the case for your innocence, for your acquittal and the grounds for the acquittal have been made stronger. Apart from that, proceedings go on as before, the court offices continue their business and the case gets passed to higher courts, gets passed back down to the lower courts and so on, backwards and forwards, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, to and fro. It's impossible to know exactly what's happening while this is going on. Seen from outside it can sometimes seem that everything has been long since forgotten, the documents have been lost and the acquittal is complete. No-one familiar with the court would believe it. No documents ever get lost, the court forgets nothing. One day—no-one expects it—some judge or other picks up the documents and looks more closely at them, he notices that this particular case is still active, and orders the defendant's immediate arrest. I've been talking here as if there's a long delay between apparent acquittal and re-arrest, that is quite possible and I do know of cases like that, but it's just as likely that the defendant goes home after he's been acquitted and finds somebody there waiting to re-arrest him. Then, of course, his life as a free man is at an end.” “And does the trial start over again?” asked K., finding it hard to believe. “The trial will always start over again,” said the painter, “but there is, once again as before, the possibility of getting an apparent acquittal. Once again, the accused has to muster all his strength and mustn't give up.” The painter said that last phrase possibly as a result of the impression that K., whose shoulders had dropped somewhat, gave on him. “But to get a second acquittal,” asked K., as if in anticipation of further revelations by the painter, “is that not harder to get than the first time?” “As far as that's concerned,” answered the painter, “there's nothing you can say for certain. You mean, do you, that the second arrest would have an adverse influence on the judge and the verdict he passes on the defendant? That's not how it happens. When the acquittal is passed the judges are already aware that re-arrest is likely. So when it happens it has hardly any effect. But there are countless other reasons why the judges' mood and their legal acumen in the case can be altered, and efforts to obtain the second acquittal must therefore be suited to the new conditions, and generally just as vigorous as the first.” “But this second acquittal will once again not be final,” said K., shaking his head. “Of course not,” said the painter, “the second acquittal is followed by the third arrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrest and so on. That's what is meant by the term apparent acquittal.” K. was silent. “You clearly don't think an apparent acquittal offers much advantage,” said the painter, “perhaps deferment would suit you better. Would you like me to explain what deferment is about?” K. nodded. The painter had leant back and spread himself out in his chair, his nightshirt was wide open, he had pushed his hand inside and was stroking his breast and his sides. “Deferment,” said the painter, looking vaguely in front of himself for a while as if trying to find a perfectly appropriate explanation, “deferment consists of keeping proceedings permanently in their earliest stages. To do that, the accused and those helping him need to keep in continuous personal contact with the court, especially those helping him. I repeat, this doesn't require so much effort as getting an apparent acquittal, but it probably requires a lot more attention. You must never let the trial out of your sight, you have to go and see the appropriate judge at regular intervals as well as when something in particular comes up and , whatever you do, you have to try and remain friendly with him; if you don't know the judge personally you have to influence him through the judges you do know, and you have to do it without giving up on the direct discussions. As long as you don't fail to do any of these things you can be reasonably sure the trial won't get past its first stages. The trial doesn't stop, but the defendant is almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he'd been acquitted. Compared with an apparent acquittal, deferment has the advantage that the defendant's future is less uncertain, he's safe from the shock of being suddenly re-arrested and doesn't need to fear the exertions and stress involved in getting an apparent acquittal just when everything else in his life would make it most difficult. Deferment does have certain disadvantages of its own though, too, and they shouldn't be under-estimated. I don't mean by this that the defendant is never free, he's never free in the proper sense of the word with an apparent acquittal either. There's another disadvantage. Proceedings can't be prevented from moving forward unless there are some at least ostensible reasons given. So something needs to seem to be happening when looked at from the outside. This means that from time to time various injunctions have to be obeyed, the accused has to be questioned, investigations have to take place and so on. The trial's been artificially constrained inside a tiny circle, and it has to be continuously spun round within it. And that, of course, brings with it certain unpleasantnesses for the accused, although you shouldn't imagine they're all that bad. All of this is just for show, the interrogations, for instance, they're only very short, if you ever don't have the time or don't feel like going to them you can offer an excuse, with some judges you can even arrange the injunctions together a long time in advance, in essence all it means is that, as the accused, you have to report to the judge from time to time.” Even while the painter was speaking those last words K. had laid his coat over his arm and had stood up. Immediately, from outside the door, there was a cry of 'He's standing up now!'. “Are you leaving already?” asked the painter, who had also stood up. “It must be the air that's driving you out. I'm very sorry about that. There's still a lot I need to tell you. I had to put everything very briefly but I hope at least it was all clear.” “Oh yes,” said K., whose head was aching from the effort of listening. Despite this affirmation the painter summed it all up once more, as if he wanted to give K. something to console him on his way home. “Both have in common that they prevent the defendant being convicted,” he said. “But they also prevent his being properly acquitted,” said K. quietly, as if ashamed to acknowledge it. “You've got it, in essence,” said the painter quickly. K. placed his hand on his winter overcoat but could not bring himself to put it on. Most of all he would have liked to pack everything together and run out to the fresh air. Not even the girls could induce him to put his coat on, even though they were already loudly telling each other that he was doing so. The painter still had to interpret K.'s mood in some way, so he said, “I expect you've deliberately avoided deciding between my suggestions yet. That's good. I would even have advised against making a decision straight away. There's no more than a hair's breadth of difference between the advantages and disadvantages. Everything has to be carefully weighed up. But the most important thing is you shouldn't lose too much time.” “I'll come back here again soon,” said K., who had suddenly decided to put his frock coat on, threw his overcoat over his shoulder and hurried over to the door behind which the girls now began to scream. K. thought he could even see the screaming girls through the door. “Well, you'll have to keep your word,” said the painter, who had not followed him, “otherwise I'll to the bank to ask about it myself.” “Will you open this door for me,” said K. pulling at the handle which, as he noticed from the resistance, was being held tightly by the girls on the other side. “Do you want to be bothered by the girls?” asked the painter. “It's better if you use the other way out,” he said, pointing to the door behind the bed. K. agreed to this and jumped back to the bed. But instead of opening that door the painter crawled under the bed and from underneath it asked K., “Just a moment more, would you not like to see a picture I could sell to you?” K. did not want to be impolite, the painter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in the future, and because of K.'s forgetfulness there had been no mention of any payment for the painter's help, so K. could not turn him down now and allowed him to show him the picture, even though he was quivering with impatience to get out of the studio. From under the bed, the painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings. They were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust swirled around in front of K.'s eyes, robbing him of breath for some time. “Moorland landscape,” said the painter passing the picture to K. It showed two sickly trees, well separated from each other in dark grass. In the background there was a multi-coloured sunset. “That's nice,” said K. “I'll buy it.” K. expressed himself in this curt way without any thought, so he was glad when the painter did not take this amiss and picked up a second painting from the floor. “This is a counterpart to the first picture,” said the painter. Perhaps it had been intended as a counterpart, but there was not the slightest difference to be seen between it and the first picture, there were the trees, there the grass and there the sunset. But this was of little importance to K. “They are beautiful landscapes,” he said, “I'll buy them both and hang them in my office.” “You seem to like this subject,” said the painter, picking up a third painting, “good job I've still got another, similar picture here.” The picture though, was not similar, rather it was exactly the same moorland landscape. The painter was fully exploiting this opportunity to sell off his old pictures. “I'll take this one too,” said K. “How much do the three paintings cost?” “We can talk about that next time,” said the painter. “You're in a hurry now, and we'll still be in contact. And besides, I'm glad you like the paintings, I'll give you all the paintings I've got down here. They're all moorland landscapes, I've painted a lot of moorland landscapes. A lot of people don't like that sort of picture because they're too gloomy, but there are others, and you're one of them, who love gloomy themes.” But K. was not in the mood to hear about the professional experiences of this painter cum beggar. “Wrap them all up!” he called out, interrupting the painter as he was speaking, “my servant will come to fetch them in the morning.” “There's no need for that,” said the painter. “I expect I can find a porter for you who can go with you now.” And, at last, he leant over the bed and unlocked the door. “Just step on the bed, don't worry about that,” said the painter, “that's what everyone does who comes in here.” Even without this invitation, K. had shown no compunction in already placing his foot in the middle of the bed covers, then he looked out through the open door and drew his foot back again. “What is that?” he asked the painter. “What are you so surprised at?” he asked, surprised in his turn. “Those are court offices. Didn't you know there are court offices here? There are court offices in almost every attic, why should this building be any different? Even my studio is actually one of the court offices but the court put it at my disposal.” It was not so much finding court offices even here that shocked K., he was mainly shocked at himself, at his own na�vety in court matters. It seemed to him that one of the most basic rules governing how a defendant should behave was always to be prepared, never allow surprises, never to look, unsuspecting, to the right when the judge stood beside him to his left—and this was the very basic rule that he was continually violating. A long corridor extended in from of him, air blew in from it which, compared with the air in the studio, was refreshing. There were benches set along each side of the corridor just as in the waiting area for the office he went to himself. There seemed to be precise rules governing how offices should be equipped. There did not seem to be many people visiting the offices that day. There was a man there, half sitting, half laying, his face was buried in his arm on the bench and he seemed to be sleeping; another man was standing in the half-dark at the end of the corridor. K. now climbed over the bed, the painter followed him with the pictures. They soon came across a servant of the court—K. was now able to recognise all the servants of the court from the gold buttons they wore on their civilian clothes below the normal buttons—and the painter instructed him to go with K. carrying the pictures. K. staggered more than he walked, his handkerchief pressed over his mouth. They had nearly reached the exit when the girls stormed in on them, so K. had not been able to avoid them. They had clearly seen that the second door of the studio had been opened and had gone around to impose themselves on him from this side. “I can't come with you any further!” called out the painter with a laugh as the girls pressed in. “Goodbye, and don't hesitate too long!” K. did not even look round at him. Once on the street he took the first cab he came across. He now had to get rid of the servant, whose gold button continually caught his eye even if it caught no-one else's. As a servant, the servant of the court was going to sit on the coach-box. But K. chased him down from there. It was already well into the afternoon when K. arrived in front of the bank. He would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared there might be some occasion when he would have to let the painter see he still had them. So he had the pictures taken to his office and locked them in the lowest drawer of his desk so that he could at least keep them safe from the deputy director's view for the next few days.","At first, K. was astonished at this orderly explanation, but then, just as quietly as the painter, he said, ""I think you're contradicting yourself."" ""How's that?"" asked the painter patiently, leaning back with a smile. This smile made K. feel as if he were examining not the words of the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedures of the court itself. Nonetheless, he continued unabashed and said, ""You remarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasoned proofs, you later restricted this to the open court, and now you go so far as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court. That entails a contradiction. Moreover, you said earlier that the judges can be influenced personally but now you insist that an absolute acquittal, as you call it, can never be attained through personal influence. That entails a second contradiction."" ""It's quite easy to clear up these contradictions,"" said the painter. ""We're talking about two different things here, there's what it says in the law and there's what I know from my own experience , you shouldn't get the two confused. I've never seen it in writing, but the law does, of course, say on the one hand that the innocent will be set free, but on the other hand it doesn't say that the judges can be influenced. But in my experience it's the other way round. I don't know of any absolute acquittals but I do know of many times when a judge has been influenced. It's possible, of course, that there was no innocence in any of the cases I know about. But is that likely? Not a single innocent defendant in so many cases? When I was a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us about court cases at home, and the judges that came to his studio talked about the court, in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I hardly ever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of it when I could, I've listened to countless trials at important stages in their development, I've followed them closely as far as they could be followed, and I have to say that I've never seen a single acquittal."" "" So. Not a single acquittal,"" said K., as if talking to himself and his hopes. "" That confirms the impression I already have of the court. So there's no point in it from this side either. They could replace the whole court with a single hangman."" ""You shouldn't generalise,"" said the painter, dissatisfied, ""I've only been talking about my own experience."" "" Well that's enough,"" said K., ""or have you heard of any acquittals that happened earlier?"" ""They say there have been some acquittals earlier,"" the painter answered, ""but it's very hard to be sure about it. The courts don't make their final conclusions public, not even the judges are allowed to know about them, so that all we know about these earlier cases are just legends. But most of them did involve absolute acquittals, you can believe that, but they can't be proved. On the other hand, you shouldn't forget all about them either, I'm sure there is some truth to them, and they are very beautiful, I've painted a few pictures myself depicting these legends."" ""My assessment will not be altered by mere legends,"" said K. ""I don't suppose it's possible to cite these legends in court, is it? "" The painter laughed. "" No, you can't cite them in court,"" he said. ""Then there's no point in talking about them,"" said K., he wanted, for the time being, to accept anything the painter told him, even if he thought it unlikely or contradicted what he had been told by others. He did not now have the time to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even to disprove it, he would have achieved as much as he could if the painter would help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive. As a result, he said, ""So let's pay no more attention to absolute acquittal, but you mentioned two other possibilities."" ""Apparent acquittal and deferment. They're the only possibilities,"" said the painter. "" But before we talk about them, would you not like to take your coat off? You must be hot."" ""Yes,"" said K., who until then had paid attention to nothing but the painter's explanations, but now that he had had the heat pointed out to him his brow began to sweat heavily. ""It's almost unbearable."" The painter nodded as if he understood K.'s discomfort very well. ""Could we not open the window?"" asked K. "" No,"" said the painter. ""It's only a fixed pane of glass, it can't be opened."" K. now realised that all this time he had been hoping the painter would suddenly go over to the window and pull it open. He had prepared himself even for the fog that he would breathe in through his open mouth. The thought that here he was entirely cut off from the air made him feel dizzy. He tapped lightly on the bedspread beside him and, with a weak voice, said, ""That is very inconvenient and unhealthy."" ""Oh no,"" said the painter in defence of his window, ""as it can't be opened this room retains the heat better than if the window were double glazed, even though it's only a single pane. There's not much need to air the room as there's so much ventilation through the gaps in the wood, but when I do want to I can open one of my doors, or even both of them."" K. was slightly consoled by this explanation and looked around to see where the second door was. The painter saw him do so and said, ""It's behind you, I had to hide it behind the bed."" Only then was K. able to see the little door in the wall. ""It's really much too small for a studio here,"" said the painter, as if he wanted to anticipate an objection K. would make. ""I had to arrange things as well as I could. That's obviously a very bad place for the bed, in front of the door. For instance when the judge I'm painting at present comes he always comes through the door by the bed, and I've even given him a key to this door so that he can wait for me here in the studio when I'm not home. Although nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when I'm still asleep. And of course, it always wakes me up when I hear the door opened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am. If you could hear the way I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning you'd lose all respect for judges. I suppose I could take the key away from him but that'd only make things worse. It only takes a tiny effort to break any of the doors here off their hinges. "" All the time the painter was speaking, K. was considering whether he should take off his coat, but he finally realised that, if he didn't do so, he would be quite unable to stay here any longer, so he took off his frock coat and lay it on his knee so that he could put it back on again as soon as the conversation was over. He had hardly done this when one of the girls called out, ""Now he's taken his coat off!"" and they could all be heard pressing around the gaps in the planks to see the spectacle for themselves. "" The girls think I'm going to paint your portrait,"" said the painter, ""and that's why you're taking your coat off."" ""I see,"" said K., only slightly amused by this, as he felt little better than he had before even though he now sat in his shirtsleeves. With some irritation he asked, ""What did you say the two other possibilities were?"" He had already forgotten the terms used. "" Apparent acquittal and deferment,"" said the painter. ""It's up to you which one you choose. You can get either of them if I help you, but it'll take some effort of course, the difference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentrated effort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it has to be sustained. Now then, apparent acquittal. If that's what you want I'll write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of paper. The text for an assertion of this sort was passed down to me from my father and it's quite unassailable. I take this assertion round to the judges I know. So I'll start off with the one I'm currently painting, and put the assertion to him when he comes for his sitting this evening. I'll lay the assertion in front of him, explain that you're innocent and give him my personal guarantee of it. And that's not just a superficial guarantee, it's a real one and it's binding. "" The painter's eyes seemed to show some reproach of K. for wanting to impose that sort of responsibility on him. ""That would be very kind of you"", said K. ""And would the judge then believe you and nonetheless not pass an absolute acquittal?"" ""It's like I just said,"" answered the painter. "" And anyway, it's not entirely sure that all the judges would believe me, many of them, for instance, might want me to bring you to see them personally. So then you'd have to come along too. But at least then, if that happens, the matter is half way won, especially as I'd teach you in advance exactly how you'd need to act with the judge concerned, of course. What also happens, though, is that there are some judges who'll turn me down in advance, and that's worse. I'll certainly make several attempts, but still, we'll have to forget about them, but at least we can afford to do that as no one judge can pass the decisive verdict. Then when I've got enough judges' signatures on this document I take it to the judge who's concerned with your case. I might even have his signature already, in which case things develop a bit quicker than they would do otherwise. But there aren't usually many hold ups from then on, and that's the time that the defendant can feel most confident. It's odd, but true, that people feel more confidence in this time than they do after they've been acquitted. There's no particular exertion needed now. When he has the document asserting the defendant's innocence, guaranteed by a number of other judges, the judge can acquit you without any worries, and although there are still several formalities to be gone through there's no doubt that that's what he'll do as a favour to me and several other acquaintances. You, however, walk out the court and you're free."" ""So, then I'll be free,"" said K., hesitantly. ""That's right,"" said the painter, ""but only apparently free or, to put it a better way, temporarily free, as the most junior judges, the ones I know, they don't have the right to give the final acquittal. Only the highest judge can do that, in the court that's quite out of reach for you, for me and for all of us. We don't know how things look there and, incidentally, we don't want to know. The right to acquit people is a major privilege and our judges don't have it, but they do have the right to free people from the indictment. That's to say, if they're freed in this way then for the time being the charge is withdrawn but it's still hanging over their heads and it only takes an order from higher up to bring it back into force. And as I'm in such good contact with the court I can also tell you how the difference between absolute and apparent acquittal is described, just in a superficial way, in the directives to the court offices. If there's an absolute acquittal all proceedings should stop, everything disappears from the process, not just the indictment but the trial and even the acquittal disappears, everything just disappears. With an apparent acquittal it's different. When that happens, nothing has changed except that the case for your innocence, for your acquittal and the grounds for the acquittal have been made stronger. Apart from that, proceedings go on as before, the court offices continue their business and the case gets passed to higher courts, gets passed back down to the lower courts and so on, backwards and forwards, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, to and fro. It's impossible to know exactly what's happening while this is going on. Seen from outside it can sometimes seem that everything has been long since forgotten, the documents have been lost and the acquittal is complete. No-one familiar with the court would believe it. No documents ever get lost, the court forgets nothing. One day - no-one expects it - some judge or other picks up the documents and looks more closely at them, he notices that this particular case is still active, and orders the defendant's immediate arrest. I've been talking here as if there's a long delay between apparent acquittal and re-arrest, that is quite possible and I do know of cases like that, but it's just as likely that the defendant goes home after he's been acquitted and finds somebody there waiting to re-arrest him. Then, of course, his life as a free man is at an end."" ""And does the trial start over again?"" asked K., finding it hard to believe. ""The trial will always start over again,"" said the painter, ""but there is, once again as before, the possibility of getting an apparent acquittal. Once again, the accused has to muster all his strength and mustn't give up. "" The painter said that last phrase possibly as a result of the impression that K., whose shoulders had dropped somewhat, gave on him. "" But to get a second acquittal,"" asked K., as if in anticipation of further revelations by the painter, ""is that not harder to get than the first time?"" ""As far as that's concerned,"" answered the painter, ""there's nothing you can say for certain. You mean, do you, that the second arrest would have an adverse influence on the judge and the verdict he passes on the defendant? That's not how it happens. When the acquittal is passed the judges are already aware that re-arrest is likely. So when it happens it has hardly any effect. But there are countless other reasons why the judges' mood and their legal acumen in the case can be altered, and efforts to obtain the second acquittal must therefore be suited to the new conditions, and generally just as vigorous as the first."" ""But this second acquittal will once again not be final,"" said K., shaking his head. ""Of course not,"" said the painter, ""the second acquittal is followed by the third arrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrest and so on. That's what is meant by the term apparent acquittal."" K. was silent. ""You clearly don't think an apparent acquittal offers much advantage,"" said the painter, ""perhaps deferment would suit you better. Would you like me to explain what deferment is about?"" K. nodded. The painter had leant back and spread himself out in his chair, his nightshirt was wide open, he had pushed his hand inside and was stroking his breast and his sides. "" Deferment,"" said the painter, looking vaguely in front of himself for a while as if trying to find a perfectly appropriate explanation, ""deferment consists of keeping proceedings permanently in their earliest stages. To do that, the accused and those helping him need to keep in continuous personal contact with the court, especially those helping him. I repeat, this doesn't require so much effort as getting an apparent acquittal, but it probably requires a lot more attention. You must never let the trial out of your sight, you have to go and see the appropriate judge at regular intervals as well as when something in particular comes up and , whatever you do, you have to try and remain friendly with him; if you don't know the judge personally you have to influence him through the judges you do know, and you have to do it without giving up on the direct discussions. As long as you don't fail to do any of these things you can be reasonably sure the trial won't get past its first stages. The trial doesn't stop, but the defendant is almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he'd been acquitted. Compared with an apparent acquittal, deferment has the advantage that the defendant's future is less uncertain, he's safe from the shock of being suddenly re-arrested and doesn't need to fear the exertions and stress involved in getting an apparent acquittal just when everything else in his life would make it most difficult. Deferment does have certain disadvantages of its own though, too, and they shouldn't be under-estimated. I don't mean by this that the defendant is never free, he's never free in the proper sense of the word with an apparent acquittal either. There's another disadvantage. Proceedings can't be prevented from moving forward unless there are some at least ostensible reasons given. So something needs to seem to be happening when looked at from the outside. This means that from time to time various injunctions have to be obeyed, the accused has to be questioned, investigations have to take place and so on. The trial's been artificially constrained inside a tiny circle, and it has to be continuously spun round within it. And that, of course, brings with it certain unpleasantnesses for the accused, although you shouldn't imagine they're all that bad. All of this is just for show, the interrogations, for instance, they're only very short, if you ever don't have the time or don't feel like going to them you can offer an excuse, with some judges you can even arrange the injunctions together a long time in advance, in essence all it means is that, as the accused, you have to report to the judge from time to time."" Even while the painter was speaking those last words K. had laid his coat over his arm and had stood up. Immediately, from outside the door, there was a cry of 'He's standing up now!'. ""Are you leaving already?"" asked the painter, who had also stood up. ""It must be the air that's driving you out. I'm very sorry about that. There's still a lot I need to tell you. I had to put everything very briefly but I hope at least it was all clear."" ""Oh yes,"" said K., whose head was aching from the effort of listening. Despite this affirmation the painter summed it all up once more, as if he wanted to give K. something to console him on his way home. ""Both have in common that they prevent the defendant being convicted,"" he said. ""But they also prevent his being properly acquitted,"" said K. quietly, as if ashamed to acknowledge it. ""You've got it, in essence,"" said the painter quickly. K. placed his hand on his winter overcoat but could not bring himself to put it on. Most of all he would have liked to pack everything together and run out to the fresh air. Not even the girls could induce him to put his coat on, even though they were already loudly telling each other that he was doing so. The painter still had to interpret K.'s mood in some way, so he said, ""I expect you've deliberately avoided deciding between my suggestions yet. That's good. I would even have advised against making a decision straight away. There's no more than a hair's breadth of difference between the advantages and disadvantages. Everything has to be carefully weighed up. But the most important thing is you shouldn't lose too much time."" ""I'll come back here again soon,"" said K., who had suddenly decided to put his frock coat on, threw his overcoat over his shoulder and hurried over to the door behind which the girls now began to scream. K. thought he could even see the screaming girls through the door. "" Well, you'll have to keep your word,"" said the painter, who had not followed him, ""otherwise I'll come to the bank to ask about it myself. "" ""Will you open this door for me,"" said K. pulling at the handle which, as he noticed from the resistance, was being held tightly by the girls on the other side. ""Do you want to be bothered by the girls? "" asked the painter. ""It's better if you use the other way out,"" he said, pointing to the door behind the bed. K. agreed to this and jumped back to the bed. But instead of opening that door the painter crawled under the bed and from underneath it asked K., ""Just a moment more, would you not like to see a picture I could sell to you?"" K. did not want to be impolite, the painter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in the future, and because of K.'s forgetfulness there had been no mention of any payment for the painter's help, so K. could not turn him down now and allowed him to show him the picture, even though he was quivering with impatience to get out of the studio. From under the bed, the painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings. They were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust swirled around in front of K.'s eyes, robbing him of breath for some time. "" Moorland landscape,"" said the painter passing the picture to K. It showed two sickly trees, well separated from each other in dark grass. In the background there was a multi-coloured sunset. ""That's nice,"" said K. ""I'll buy it."" K. expressed himself in this curt way without any thought, so he was glad when the painter did not take this amiss and picked up a second painting from the floor. ""This is a counterpart to the first picture,"" said the painter. Perhaps it had been intended as a counterpart, but there was not the slightest difference to be seen between it and the first picture, there were the trees, there the grass and there the sunset. But this was of little importance to K. ""They are beautiful landscapes,"" he said, ""I'll buy them both and hang them in my office."" ""You seem to like this subject,"" said the painter, picking up a third painting, ""good job I've still got another, similar picture here. "" The picture though, was not similar, rather it was exactly the same moorland landscape. The painter was fully exploiting this opportunity to sell off his old pictures. ""I'll take this one too,"" said K. ""How much do the three paintings cost?"" ""We can talk about that next time,"" said the painter. ""You're in a hurry now, and we'll still be in contact. And besides, I'm glad you like the paintings, I'll give you all the paintings I've got down here. They're all moorland landscapes, I've painted a lot of moorland landscapes. A lot of people don't like that sort of picture because they're too gloomy, but there are others, and you're one of them, who love gloomy themes."" But K. was not in the mood to hear about the professional experiences of this painter cum beggar. "" Wrap them all up!"" he called out, interrupting the painter as he was speaking, ""my servant will come to fetch them in the morning."" ""There's no need for that,"" said the painter. ""I expect I can find a porter for you who can go with you now."" And, at last, he leant over the bed and unlocked the door. "" Just step on the bed, don't worry about that,"" said the painter, ""that's what everyone does who comes in here. "" Even without this invitation, K. had shown no compunction in already placing his foot in the middle of the bed covers, then he looked out through the open door and drew his foot back again. "" What is that?"" he asked the painter. ""What are you so surprised at?"" he asked, surprised in his turn. ""Those are court offices. Didn't you know there are court offices here? There are court offices in almost every attic, why should this building be any different? Even my studio is actually one of the court offices but the court put it at my disposal. "" It was not so much finding court offices even here that shocked K., he was mainly shocked at himself, at his own naïvety in court matters. It seemed to him that one of the most basic rules governing how a defendant should behave was always to be prepared, never allow surprises, never to look, unsuspecting, to the right when the judge stood beside him to his left - and this was the very basic rule that he was continually violating. A long corridor extended in from of him, air blew in from it which, compared with the air in the studio, was refreshing. There were benches set along each side of the corridor just as in the waiting area for the office he went to himself. There seemed to be precise rules governing how offices should be equipped. There did not seem to be many people visiting the offices that day. There was a man there, half sitting, half laying, his face was buried in his arm on the bench and he seemed to be sleeping; another man was standing in the half-dark at the end of the corridor. K. now climbed over the bed, the painter followed him with the pictures. They soon came across a servant of the court - K. was now able to recognise all the servants of the court from the gold buttons they wore on their civilian clothes below the normal buttons - and the painter instructed him to go with K. carrying the pictures. K. staggered more than he walked, his handkerchief pressed over his mouth. They had nearly reached the exit when the girls stormed in on them, so K. had not been able to avoid them. They had clearly seen that the second door of the studio had been opened and had gone around to impose themselves on him from this side. ""I can't come with you any further!"" called out the painter with a laugh as the girls pressed in. "" Goodbye, and don't hesitate too long!"" K. did not even look round at him. Once on the street he took the first cab he came across. He now had to get rid of the servant, whose gold button continually caught his eye even if it caught no-one else's. As a servant, the servant of the court was going to sit on the coach-box. But K. chased him down from there. It was already well into the afternoon when K. arrived in front of the bank. He would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared there might be some occasion when he would have to let the painter see he still had them. So he had the pictures taken to his office and locked them in the lowest drawer of his desk so that he could at least keep them safe from the deputy director's view for the next few days."

"Schon auf der Treppe wollten sich die Herren in K. einhängen, aber K. sagte: »Erst auf der Gasse, ich bin nicht krank.« Gleich aber vor dem Tor hängten sie sich in ihn in einer Weise ein, wie K. noch niemals mit einem Menschen gegangen war. Sie hielten die Schultern eng hinter den seinen, knickten die Arme nicht ein, sondern benützten sie, um K.s Arme in ihrer ganzen Länge zu umschlingen, unten erfaßten sie K.s Hände mit einem schulmäßigen, eingeübten, unwiderstehlichen Griff. K. ging straff gestreckt zwischen ihnen, sie bildeten jetzt alle drei eine solche Einheit, daß, wenn man einen von ihnen zerschlagen hätte, alle zerschlagen gewesen wären. Es war eine Einheit, wie sie fast nur Lebloses bilden kann.","On the stairs, the gentlemen wanted to hang on to K., but K. said, ""First on the street, I'm not ill."" But right at the gate, they attached themselves to him in a way that K. had never done before went with a human. They kept their shoulders close behind his, didn't bend their arms, but used them to encircle K.'s arms their entire length, gripping K.'s hands from below with a schoollike, practiced, irresistible grip. K. walked stretched out between them, they all three now formed such a unit that if one of them had been smashed, they would all have been smashed. It was a unit that almost only inanimate things can form.","The men wanted to take hold of K.’s arms on the stairway, but K. said: “Wait till we’re in the street, I’m not ill.” Just beyond the entrance, however, they took his arms in a manner K. had never before experienced in walking with anyone. They held their shoulders right behind his, didn’t crook their arms, but instead wrapped them about the whole length of his, seizing K.’s hands below with a well-trained, practiced, and irresistible grip. K. walked along stiffly between them; now they formed such a close unit that had one of them been struck down they would all have fallen. It was a unit of the sort seldom formed except by lifeless matter.","While still on the stairs the two of them tried to take K. by the arms, and he said: ""Wait till we're in the street, I'm not an invalid."" But just outside the street door they fastened on him in a fashion he had never before experienced. They kept their shoulders close behind his and instead of crooking their elbows, wound their arms round his at full length, holding his hands in a methodical, practiced, irresistible grip. K. walked rigidly between them, the three of them were interlocked in a unity which would have brought all three down together had one of them been knocked over. It was a unity such as can hardly be formed except by lifeless matter.","As soon as they were on the stairs the gentlemen wanted to take K.'s arms, but K. said “Wait till we're in the street, I'm not ill.” But they waited only until the front door before they took his arms in a way that K. had never experienced before. They kept their shoulders close behind his, did not turn their arms in but twisted them around the entire length of K.'s arms and took hold of his hands with a grasp that was formal, experienced and could not be resisted. K. was held stiff and upright between them, they formed now a single unit so that if any one of them had been knocked down all of them must have fallen. They formed a unit of the sort that normally can be formed only by matter that is lifeless.","As soon as they were on the stairs the gentlemen wanted to take K.'s arms, but K. said ""Wait till we're in the street, I'm not ill.""

"Nun schwiegen beide lange. Gewiß konnte der Geistliche in dem Dunkel, das unten herrschte, K. nicht genau erkennen, während K. den Geistlichen im Licht der kleinen Lampe deutlich sah. Warum kam der Geistliche nicht herunter? Eine Predigt hatte er ja nicht gehalten, sondern K. nur einige Mitteilungen gemacht, die ihm, wenn er sie genau beachtete, wahrscheinlich mehr schaden als nützen würden. Wohl aber schien K. die gute Absicht des Geistlichen zweifellos zu sein, es war nicht unmöglich, daß er sich mit ihm, wenn er herunterkäme, einigen würde, es war nicht unmöglich, daß er von ihm einen entscheidenden und annehmbaren Rat bekäme, der ihm zum Beispiel zeigen würde, nicht etwa wie der Prozeß zu beeinflussen war, sondern wie man aus dem Prozeß ausbrechen, wie man ihn umgehen, wie man außerhalb des Prozesses leben könnte. Diese Möglichkeit mußte bestehen, K. hatte in der letzten Zeit öfters an sie gedacht. Wußte aber der Geistliche eine solche Möglichkeit, würde er sie vielleicht, wenn man ihn darum bat, verraten, obwohl er selbst zum Gerichte gehörte und obwohl er, als K. das Gericht angegriffen hatte, sein sanftes Wesen unterdrückt und K. sogar angeschrien hatte.","Now both were silent for a long time. Certainly the priest couldn't see K. clearly in the darkness that prevailed downstairs, while K. saw the priest clearly in the light of the small lamp. Why didn't the minister come down? He hadn't preached a sermon, he had just given K. a few messages which, if he paid close attention to them, would probably do him more harm than good. But K. certainly seemed to have the good intentions of the priest, it wasn't impossible that he would come to an agreement with him when he came downstairs, it wasn't impossible that he would get decisive and acceptable advice from him that would would show, for example, not how to influence the process, but how to break out of the process, how to circumvent it, how to live outside of the process. This possibility had to exist, K. had often thought about it recently. But if the priest knew of such a possibility, he might reveal it if asked, even though he himself belonged to the court and although when K. had attacked the court, he had suppressed his gentle nature and even yelled at K..","Now both were silent for a long time. Of course the priest could barely distinguish K. in the darkness reigning below, while K. could see the priest clearly by the light of the little lamp. Why didn’t the priest come down? He hadn’t delivered a sermon, but instead merely told K. a few things that would probably harm him more than help if he paid any attention to them. Nevertheless, the priest’s good intentions seemed clear to K.; it was not impossible that they might come to terms if he would come down, it was not impossible that he might receive some form of decisive and acceptable advice from him, something that might show him, for example, not how to influence the trial, but how to break out of it, how to get around it, how to live outside the trial. Surely that possibility existed; K. had thought about it often in the recent past. If the priest knew of such a possibility, he might reveal it if asked, even though he himself was part of the court, and even though when K. attacked the court, he had suppressed his gentle nature and actually shouted at K.","Both were now silent for a long time. In the prevailing darkness the priest certainly could not make out K.'s features, while K. saw him distinctly by the light of the small lamp. Why did he not come down from the pulpit? He had not preached a sermon, he had only given K. some information which would be likely to harm him rather than help him when he came to consider it. Yet the priest's good intentions seemed to K. beyond question, it was not impossible that they could come to some agreement if the man would only quit his pulpit, it was not impossible that K. could obtain decisive and acceptable counsel from him which might, for instance, point the way, not toward some influential manipulation of the case, but toward a circumvention of it, a breaking away from it altogether, a mode of living completely outside the jurisdiction of the Court. This possibility must exist, K. had of late given much thought to it. And should the priest know of such a possibility, he might perhaps impart his knowledge if he were appealed to, although he himself belonged to the Court and as soon as he heard the Court impugned had forgotten his own gentle nature so far as to shout K. down.","The two men, then, remained silent for a long time. In the darkness beneath him, the priest could not possibly have seen K. distinctly, although K. was able to see him clearly by the light of the little lamp. Why did the priest not come down? He had not given a sermon, he had only told K. a few things which, if he followed them closely, would probably cause him more harm than good. But the priest certainly seemed to mean well , it might even be possible, if he would come down and cooperate with him, it might even be possible for him to obtain some acceptable piece of advice that could make all the difference, it might, for instance, be able to show him not so much to influence the proceedings but how to break free of them, how to evade them, how to live away from them. K. had to admit that this was something he had had on his mind quite a lot of late. If the priest knew of such a possibility he might, if K. asked him, let him know about it, even though he was part of the court himself and even though, when K. had criticised the court, he had held down his gentle nature and actually shouted at K.","The two men, then, remained silent for a long time.

"Es war ein sehr langes, aber schmales, einfenstriges Zimmer. Es war dort nur so viel Platz vorhanden, daß man in den Ecken an der Türseite zwei Schränke schief hatte aufstellen können, während der übrige Raum vollständig von dem langen Speisetisch eingenommen war, der in der Nähe der Tür begann und bis knapp zum großen Fenster reichte, welches dadurch fast unzugänglich geworden war.

"Aber sein stummes Dastehen mußte auffallend sein, und wirklich sahen ihn das Mädchen und der Gerichtsdiener derartig an, als ob in der nächsten Minute irgendeine große Verwandlung mit ihm geschehen müsse, die sie zu beobachten nicht versäumen wollten. Und in der Türöffnung stand der Mann, den K. früher in der Ferne bemerkt hatte, er hielt sich am Deckbalken der niedrigen Tür fest und schaukelte ein wenig auf den Fußspitzen, wie ein ungeduldiger Zuschauer. Das Mädchen aber erkannte doch zuerst, daß das Benehmen K.s in einem leichten Unwohlsein seinen Grund hatte, sie brachte einen Sessel und fragte: »Wollen Sie sich nicht setzen?« K. setzte sich sofort und stützte, um noch besseren Halt zu bekommen, die Ellbogen auf die Lehnen. »Sie haben ein wenig Schwindel, nicht?« fragte sie ihn. Er hatte nun ihr Gesicht nahe vor sich, es hatte den strengen Ausdruck, wie ihn manche Frauen gerade in ihrer schönsten Jugend haben. »Machen Sie sich darüber keine Gedanken«, sagte sie, »das ist hier nichts Außergewöhnliches, fast jeder bekommt einen solchen Anfall, wenn er zum erstenmal herkommt. Sie sind zum erstenmal hier? Nun ja, das ist also nichts Außergewöhnliches. Die Sonne brennt hier auf das Dachgerüst, und das heiße Holz macht die Luft so dumpf und schwer. Der Ort ist deshalb für Büroräumlichkeiten nicht sehr geeignet, so große Vorteile er allerdings sonst bietet. Aber was die Luft betrifft, so ist sie an Tagen großen Parteienverkehrs, und das ist fast jeder Tag, kaum mehr atembar. Wenn Sie dann noch bedenken, daß hier auch vielfach Wäsche zum Trocknen ausgehängt wird – man kann es den Mietern nicht gänzlich untersagen –, so werden Sie sich nicht mehr wundern, daß Ihnen ein wenig übel wurde. Aber man gewöhnt sich schließlich an die Luft sehr gut. Wenn Sie zum zweiten- oder drittenmal herkommen, werden Sie das Drückende hier kaum mehr spüren. Fühlen Sie sich schon besser?« K. antwortete nicht, es war ihm zu peinlich, durch diese plötzliche Schwäche den Leuten hier ausgeliefert zu sein, überdies war ihm, da er jetzt die Ursachen seiner Übelkeit erfahren hatte, nicht besser, sondern noch ein wenig schlechter.","But his mute standing there must have been conspicuous, and indeed the girl and the bailiff looked at him as if some great transformation must happen to him in the next minute, which they did not want to miss seeing. And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had noticed earlier in the distance, holding on to the mullion of the low door and rocking a little on tiptoe, like an impatient spectator. But the girl was the first to recognize that K.'s behavior was due to a slight feeling unwell. She brought a chair and asked: ""Wouldn't you like to sit down?"" elbows on the rests. ""You're a little dizzy, aren't you?"" she asked him. He now had her face close in front of him, it had the stern expression that some women have in their most beautiful youth. 'Don't worry about it,' she said, 'it's nothing out of the ordinary here, almost everyone gets a fit like that when they first come here. Are you here for the first time? Well, that's nothing out of the ordinary. The sun beats down on the roof frame here, and the hot wood makes the air so stuffy and heavy. The place is therefore not very suitable for office space, despite the great advantages it otherwise offers. But as far as the air is concerned, on busy days, and that's almost every day, it's almost unbreathable. If you then consider that laundry is often hung out to dry here - tenants cannot be completely forbidden to do so - you will no longer be surprised that you felt a little nauseous. But you eventually get used to the air very well. If you come here for the second or third time, you will hardly feel the pressure here anymore. Do you feel better already?” K. didn't answer, he was too embarrassed to be at the mercy of the people here because of his sudden weakness, besides, now that he had found out the causes of his nausea, he didn't feel any better, just a little worse.","But the way he was silently standing there must have been striking, and the young woman and the court usher were actually looking at him as if they thought he was about to undergo some profound metamorphosis at any moment, one they didn’t want to miss. And in the doorway stood the man K. had noticed in the background earlier, holding on tightly to the lintel of the low door and rocking back and forth slightly on the tips of his toes, like an impatient spectator. It was the young woman, however, who first realized that K.’s behavior was the result of a slight indisposition; she brought him a chair and asked: “Wouldn’t you like to sit down?” K. sat down immediately and propped his elbows on the arms of the chair for better support. “You’re a little dizzy, aren’t you?” she asked him. Her face was now quite near; it bore the severe expression some young women have precisely in the bloom of youth. “Don’t worry,” she said, “there’s nothing unusual about that here, almost everyone has an attack like this the first time. You are here for the first time? Well, you see then , it’s nothing at all unusual. The sun beats down on the attic beams and the hot wood makes the air terribly thick and stifling. That’s why this isn’t such a good location for the offices, in spite of the many other advantages it offers. But as far as the air is concerned, on days when the traffic of involved parties is heavy you can hardly breathe, and that’s almost daily. Then if you take into consideration that a great deal of wash is hung out here to dry as well—the tenants can’t be entirely forbidden from doing so—it will come as no surprise that you feel a little sick. But in the end people get quite used to the air. When you come here the second or third time, you’ll hardly notice the stuffiness at all. Do you feel better yet?” K. didn’t reply; he was too embarrassed that this sudden weakness had placed him at these people’s mercy; moreover, now that he knew the cause of his nausea he didn’t feel better, but instead a little worse.","But his dumb immobility must make him conspicuous, and the girl and the usher were actually gazing at him as if they expected some great transformation to happen to him the next moment, a transformation which they did not want to miss. And at the end of the passage now stood the man whom K. had noticed before in the distance; he was holding on to the lintel of the low doorway and rocking lightly on his toes, like an eager spectator. But the girl was the first to see that K.'s behavior was really caused by a slight feeling of faintness; she produced a chair and asked: ""Won't you sit down?"" K. sat down at once and leaned his elbows on the arms of the chair so as to support himself still more securely. ""You feel a little dizzy, don't you?"" she asked. Her face was close to him now, it had that severe look which the faces of many women have in the first flower of their youth. "" Don't worry,"" she said. ""That's nothing out of the common here, almost everybody has an attack of that kind the first time they come here. This is your first visit? Well, then, it's nothing to be surprised at. The sun beats on the roof here and the hot roof-beams make the air stuffy and heavy. That makes this place not particularly suitable for offices, in spite of the other great advantages it has. But the air, well, on days when there's a great number of clients to be attended to, and that's almost every day, it's hardly breathable. When you consider, too, that washing of all sorts is hung up here to dry -- you can't wholly prohibit the tenants from washing their dirty linen -- you won't find it surprising that you should feel a little faint. But in the end one gets quite used to it. By the time you've come back once or twice you'll hardly notice how oppressive it is here. Do you really feel better now?"" K. did not answer, he realized too painfully the shame of being delivered into the hands of these people by his sudden weakness; besides, even now that he knew the cause of the faintness, it did not get any better but grew somewhat worse instead.","But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they didn't want to miss seeing. And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming impatient as he watched. But the young woman was the first to recognise that K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell, she brought a chair and asked, “Would you not like to sit down?” K. sat down immediately and, in order to keep his place better, put his elbows on the armrests. “You're a little bit dizzy, aren't you?” she asked him. Her face was now close in front of him, it bore the severe expression that many young women have just when they're in the bloom of their youth. “It's nothing for you to worry about,” she said, “that's nothing unusual here, almost everyone gets an attack like that the first time they come here. This is your first time is it? Yes, it's nothing unusual then. The sun burns down on the roof and the hot wood makes the air so thick and heavy.

And when you think that there's a lot of washing put out to dry here as well—and we can't stop the tenants doing that —it's not surprising you started to feel unwell. But you get used to the air alright in the end. When you're here for the second or third time you'll hardly notice how oppressive the air is. Are you feeling any better now?” K. made no answer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the mercy of these people by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason for feeling ill made him feel not better but a little worse.","But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they didn't want to miss seeing.

"Wieder begann ein Mädchen hinter der Tür zu fragen: »Titorelli, wird er denn nicht schon bald weggehen?« »Schweigt!« rief der Maler zur Tür hin, »seht ihr denn nicht, daß ich mit dem Herrn eine Besprechung habe?« Aber das Mädchen gab sich damit nicht zufrieden, sondern fragte: »Du wirst ihn malen?« Und als der Maler nicht antwortete, sagte sie noch: »Bitte, mal ihn nicht, einen so häßlichen Menschen.« Ein Durcheinander unverständlicher zustimmender Zurufe folgte. Der Maler machte einen Sprung zur Tür, öffnete sie bis zu einem Spalt – man sah die bittend vorgestreckten, gefalteten Hände der Mädchen – und sagte: »Wenn ihr nicht still seid, werfe ich euch alle die Treppe hinunter. Setzt euch hier auf die Stufen und verhaltet euch ruhig.« Wahrscheinlich folgten sie nicht gleich, so daß er kommandieren mußte: »Nieder auf die Stufen!« Erst dann wurde es still.","Again a girl behind the door began to ask: ""Titorelli, won't he be leaving soon?"" ""Shut up!"" the painter called towards the door, ""can't you see that I have a meeting with the gentleman?"" But the girl wasn't content with that, but asked: ""You're going to paint him?"" And when the painter didn't answer, she said: ""Please don't paint him, such an ugly person."" A jumble of incomprehensible shouts of approval followed. The painter leapt to the door, opened it a crack—you could see the girls' folded hands outstretched in supplication—and said, 'If you don't shut up, I'll throw you all down the stairs. Sit down here on the steps and keep quiet.' They probably didn't follow right away, so he had to command: 'Down on the steps!' Only then did it become quiet.","Behind the door a girl started asking again: “Titorelli, isn’t he going to leave pretty soon?” “Quiet,” the painter yelled at the door, “can’t you see that I’m having a conference with this gentleman?” But that didn’t satisfy the girl, who instead asked: “Are you going to paint him?” And when the painter didn’t reply she added: “Please don’t paint him; he’s so ugly.” A confusion of unintelligible cries of agreement followed. The painter sprang to the door, opened it a crack—the clasped hands of the girls could be seen stretched out imploringly—and said: “If you don’t be quiet, I’m going to throw you all down the stairs. Sit down on the steps and keep still.” Apparently they didn’t obey right away, so that he had to make it a command: “ Down on the steps!” Only then was it quiet.","Again a girl's voice piped from behind the door: ""Titorelli, won't he be going away soon now?"" ""Quiet, there!"" cried the painter over his shoulder. "" Can't you see that I'm engaged with this gentleman? "" But the girl, not to be put off, asked: ""Are you going to paint him?"" And when the painter did not reply she went on: ""Please don't paint him, such an ugly man as that. "" The others yelled agreement in a confused jabbering. The painter made a leap for the door, opened it a little -- K. could see the imploring, outstretched, clasped hands of the girls -- and said: ""If you don't stop that noise I'll fling you all down the stairs. Sit down here on the steps and see that you keep quiet. "" Apparently they did not obey him at once, for he had to shout in an imperious voice: ""Down with you on the steps !"" After that all was still.","One of the girls behind the door started up again, and asked, “Titorelli, is he going to go soon?” “Quiet!” shouted the painter at the door, “ Can't you see I'm talking with the gentleman?” But this was not enough to satisfy the girl and she asked, “You going to paint his picture?” And when the painter didn't answer she added, “Please don't paint him, he's an 'orrible bloke.” There followed an incomprehensible, interwoven babble of shouts and replies and calls of agreement. The painter leapt over to the door, opened it very slightly—the girls' clasped hands could be seen stretching through the crack as if they wanted something—and said, “If you're not quiet I'll throw you all down the stairs. Sit down here on the steps and be quiet.” They probably did not obey him immediately, so that he had to command, “ Down on the steps!” Only then it became quiet.","One of the girls behind the door started up again, and asked, ""Titorelli, is he going to go soon?""

"Sonntag war trübes Wetter. K. war sehr ermüdet, da er wegen einer Stammtischfeierlichkeit bis spät in die Nacht im Gasthaus geblieben war, er hätte fast verschlafen. Eilig, ohne Zeit zu haben, zu überlegen und die verschiedenen Pläne, die er während der Woche ausgedacht hatte, zusammenzustellen, kleidete er sich an und lief, ohne zu frühstücken, in die ihm bezeichnete Vorstadt. Eigentümlicherweise traf er, obwohl er wenig Zeit hatte, umherzublicken, die drei an seiner Angelegenheit beteiligten Beamten, Rabensteiner, Kullich und Kaminer. Die ersten zwei fuhren in einer Elektrischen quer über K.s Weg, Kaminer aber saß auf der Terrasse eines Kaffeehauses und beugte sich gerade, als K. vorüberkam, neugierig über die Brüstung. Alle sahen ihm wohl nach und wunderten sich, wie ihr Vorgesetzter lief; es war irgendein Trotz, der K. davon abgehalten hatte, zu fahren, er hatte Abscheu vor jeder, selbst der geringsten fremden Hilfe in dieser seiner Sache, auch wollte er niemanden in Anspruch nehmen und dadurch selbst nur im allerentferntesten einweihen; schließlich hatte er aber auch nicht die geringste Lust, sich durch allzu große Pünktlichkeit vor der Untersuchungskommission zu erniedrigen. Allerdings lief er jetzt, um nur möglichst um neun Uhr einzutreffen, obwohl er nicht einmal für eine bestimmte Stunde bestellt war.","Sunday was cloudy weather. K. was very tired, because he had stayed late at the inn for a party at the regulars' table, he almost overslept. In a hurry, without having time to think and to put together the various plans he had thought up during the week, he dressed and, without having breakfast, ran to the suburb indicated to him. Curiously, although he had little time to look around, he met the three officials involved in his affair, Rabensteiner, Kullich, and Kaminer. The first two went in a streetcar across K.'s path, but Kaminer was sitting on the terrace of a coffee house and was bending over the parapet just as K. passed, curious. Everyone looked after him and wondered how their superior was doing; it was some kind of defiance that kept K. from driving, he loathed everyone, even the smallest outside help in his matter, he also didn't want to make any claims on anyone and thereby only let him in the remotest sense; finally he had not the slightest desire to humiliate himself by being too punctual in front of the commission of inquiry. However, he now ran to arrive at nine o'clock if possible, although he had not even been booked for a specific hour.","The weather was dull on Sunday, and K. was very tired, having stayed at the tavern celebrating with the regulars late into the night, so that he almost overslept. He dressed hastily, without having time to think things over or review the various plans he’d worked out during the week, and skipping breakfast, hurried to the suburb they had indicated. Strangely enough, although he had little time to look about, he ran across the three clerks who were involved in his affair: Rabensteiner, Kullych, and Kaminer. The first two were riding in a tram that crossed K.’s path, but Kaminer was sitting on the terrace of a coffeehouse and, just as K. was walking by, leaned inquisitively over the railing. They probably all gazed after him, wondering why their supervisor was in such a rush; some sort of stubbornness had prevented K. from taking a cab; he had an aversion to even the slightest outside help in this affair of his; he didn’t want to enlist anyone’s aid and thus initiate them in the matter even distantly; nor, finally, did he have the least desire to humble himself before the commission of inquiry by being overly punctual. Of course he was now running to get there by nine if at all possible, although he had not even been given a specific hour at which to appear.","Sunday was dull. K. was tired, for he had stayed late at his restaurant the night before because of a celebration; he had nearly overslept. In a great hurry, without taking time to think or co-ordinate the plans which he had drawn up during the week, he dressed and rushed off, without his breakfast, to the suburb which had been mentioned to him. Strangely enough, though he had little time to study passers-by, he caught sight of the three clerks already involved in his case: Rabensteiner, Kullich, and Kaminer. The first two were journeying in a streetcar which crossed in front of him, but Kaminer was sitting on the terrace of a café‚ and bent inquisitively over the railing just as K. passed. All three were probably staring after him and wondering where their chief was rushing off to; a sort of defiance had kept K. from taking a vehicle to his destination, he loathed the thought of chartering anyone, even the most casual stranger, to help him along in this case of his, also he did not want to be beholden to anyone or to initiate anyone even remotely in his affairs, and last of all he had no desire to belittle himself before the Court of Inquiry by a too scrupulous punctuality. Nevertheless he was hurrying fast, so as to arrive by nine o'clock if possible, although he had not even been required to appear at any specified time.","The weather was dull on Sunday. K. was very tired, as he had stayed out drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of the regulars, and he had almost overslept.

Oddly enough, although he had little time to look around him, he came across the three bank officials involved in his case, Rabensteiner, Kullich and Kaminer. The first two were travelling in a tram that went across K.'s route, but Kaminer sat on the terrace of a cafe and leant curiously over the wall as K. came over. All of them seemed to be looking at him, surprised at seeing their superior running; it was a kind of pride that made K. want to go on foot, this was his affair and the idea of any help from strangers, however slight, was repulsive to him, he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone's help because that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly. And after all, he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the committee by being too punctual. Anyway, now he was running so that he would get there by nine o'clock if at all possible, even though he had no appointment for this time.","The weather was dull on Sunday.

Oddly enough, although he had little time to look around him, he came across the three bank officials involved in his case, Rabensteiner, Kullich and Kaminer. The first two were travelling in a tram that went across K.'s route, but Kaminer sat on the terrace of a café and leant curiously over the wall as K. came over. All of them seemed to be looking at him, surprised at seeing their superior running; it was a kind of pride that made K. want to go on foot, this was his affair and the idea of any help from strangers, however slight, was repulsive to him, he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone's help because that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly. And after all, he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the committee by being too punctual. Anyway, now he was running so that he would get there by nine o'clock if at all possible, even though he had no appointment for this time."
"Dagegen beschloß er, da er gar keine Lust zum Schlafen hatte, noch wachzubleiben und bei dieser Gelegenheit auch festzustellen, wann Fräulein Bürstner kommen würde. Vielleicht wäre es dann auch möglich, so unpassend es sein mochte, noch ein paar Worte mit ihr zu reden. Als er im Fenster lag und die müden Augen drückte, dachte er einen Augenblick sogar daran, Frau Grubach zu bestrafen und Fräulein Bürstner zu überreden, gemeinsam mit ihm zu kündigen. Sofort aber erschien ihm das entsetzlich übertrieben, und er hatte sogar den Verdacht gegen sich, daß er darauf ausging, die Wohnung wegen der Vorfälle am Morgen zu wechseln. Nichts wäre unsinniger und vor allem zweckloser und verächtlicher gewesen.","On the other hand, since he didn't feel like sleeping at all, he decided to stay awake and use this opportunity to find out when Fraulein Bürstner would come. Perhaps it would then also be possible, as inappropriate as it might be, to have a few more words with her. As he lay in the window and squeezed his tired eyes, he even thought for a moment of punishing Frau Grubach and persuading Fraulein Bürstner to resign with him. But that immediately struck him as horribly exaggerated, and he even suspected that he was about to change apartments because of what had happened that morning. Nothing would have been more nonsensical and above all useless and contemptible.","However, since he didn’t feel like sleeping, he decided to stay up, and use the opportunity to find out when Fräulein Bürstner would arrive. It might even be possible, though hardly proper, to exchange a few words with her. As he lay in the window, rubbing his weary eyes, he even thought for a moment of punishing Frau Grubach by talking Fräulein Bürstner into joining him in giving notice. But he saw at once that this would be a gross overreaction and even suspected himself of wishing to change lodgings because of the morning’s events. Nothing would be more irrational, and above all more pointless and contemptible.","On the other hand, as he felt no desire to sleep, he resolved to stay awake and take the opportunity of noting at what hour Fräulein Bürstner returned. Perhaps when she did so it might still be possible, unsuitable though the hour was, to have a few words with her. As he lounged by the window and shut his tired eyes, he actually considered for a moment paying Frau Grubach out by persuading Fräulein Bürstner to give notice along with him. Yet he saw at once that this was an excessive reaction, and he began to suspect himself of wishing to change his lodgings because of that, morning's events. Nothing could be more senseless, not to say pointless and contemptible.","He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay up, and this would also give him the chance to find out when Miss Borstner would arrive home. Perhaps it would also still be possible, even if a little inappropriate, to have a few words with her. As he lay there by the window, pressing his hands to his tired eyes, he even thought for a moment that he might punish Mrs. Grubach by persuading Miss Borstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would. But he immediately realised that that would be shockingly excessive, and there would even be the suspicion that he was moving house because of the incidents of that morning. Nothing would have been more nonsensical and, above all, more pointless and contemptible.","He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay up, and this would also give him the chance to find out when Miss Bürstner would arrive home.

"Plötzlich unterbrach sie sich, legte ihre Hand auf K.s Hand, als wolle sie ihn beruhigen, und flüsterte: »Still, Berthold sieht uns zu.« K. hob langsam den Blick. In der Tür des Sitzungszimmers stand ein junger Mann, er war klein, hatte nicht ganz gerade Beine und suchte sich durch einen kurzen, schütteren, rötlichen Vollbart, in dem er die Finger fortwährend herumführte, Würde zu geben. K. sah ihn neugierig an, es war ja der erste Student der unbekannten Rechtswissenschaft, dem er gewissermaßen menschlich begegnete, ein Mann, der wahrscheinlich auch einmal zu höheren Beamtenstellen gelangen würde. Der Student dagegen kümmerte sich um K. scheinbar gar nicht, er winkte nur mit einem Finger, den er für einen Augenblick aus seinem Barte zog, der Frau und ging zum Fenster, die Frau beugte sich zu K. und flüsterte: »Seien Sie mir nicht böse, ich bitte Sie vielmals, denken Sie auch nicht schlecht von mir, ich muß jetzt zu ihm gehen, zu diesem scheußlichen Menschen, sehen Sie nur seine krummen Beine an. Aber ich komme gleich zurück, und dann gehe ich mit Ihnen, wenn Sie mich mitnehmen, ich gehe, wohin Sie wollen, Sie können mit mir tun, was sie wollen, ich werde glücklich sein, wenn ich von hier für möglichst lange Zeit fort bin, am liebsten allerdings für immer.« Sie streichelte noch K.s Hand, sprang auf und lief zum Fenster. Unwillkürlich haschte noch K. nach ihrer Hand ins Leere. Die Frau verlockte ihn wirklich, er fand trotz allem Nachdenken keinen haltbaren Grund dafür, warum er der Verlockung nicht nachgeben sollte. Den flüchtigen Einwand, daß ihn die Frau für das Gericht einfange, wehrte er ohne Mühe ab. Auf welche Weise konnte sie ihn einfangen? Blieb er nicht immer so frei, daß er das ganze Gericht, wenigstens soweit es ihn betraf, sofort zerschlagen konnte? Konnte er nicht dieses geringe Vertrauen zu sich haben? Und ihr Anerbieten einer Hilfe klang aufrichtig und war vielleicht nicht wertlos. Und es gab vielleicht keine bessere Rache an dem Untersuchungsrichter und seinem Anhang, als daß er ihnen diese Frau entzog und an sich nahm. Es könnte sich dann einmal der Fall ereignen, daß der Untersuchungsrichter nach mühevoller Arbeit an Lügenberichten über K. in später Nacht das Bett der Frau leer fand. Und leer deshalb, weil sie K. gehörte, weil diese Frau am Fenster, dieser üppige, gelenkige, warme Körper im dunklen Kleid aus grobem, schwerem Stoff, durchaus nur K. gehörte.","Suddenly she stopped herself, put her hand on K.'s hand as if to calm him down and whispered: ""Hush, Berthold is watching us."" K. slowly raised his eyes. In the door of the meeting room stood a young man, he was small, his legs weren't quite straight, and he tried to give himself dignity with a short, sparse, reddish full beard, over which he constantly ran his fingers. K. looked at him curiously, after all it was the first student of the unknown law he met as a human being, a man who would probably one day get to higher official positions. The student, on the other hand, didn't seem to care about K., he just waved a finger, which he pulled out of his beard for a moment, at the woman and went to the window, the woman leaned towards K. and whispered: ""Be me don't get angry, I beg you, don't think badly of me either, I have to go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his crooked legs. But I'll be right back and then I'll go with you if you take me with you, I'll go where you want, you can do what you want with me, I'll be happy if I'm away from here for as long as possible , but preferably forever.' She stroked K.'s hand, jumped up and ran to the window. Involuntarily, K. grabbed her hand into the void. The woman really tempted him, and in spite of all his thinking he couldn't find any valid reason why he shouldn't give in to the temptation. He easily fended off the fleeting objection that the woman was capturing him for the court. How could she catch him? Didn't he always remain so free that he could immediately smash the whole court, at least as far as he was concerned? Couldn't he have that little faith in himself? And her offer of help sounded sincere and maybe not worthless. And perhaps there was no better revenge on the coroner and his followers than to take this woman from them and take it for himself. It could then happen that the examining magistrate, after laborious work on lying reports about K., found the woman's bed empty late at night. And empty because she belonged to K., because this woman at the window, this voluptuous, supple, warm body in a dark dress made of coarse, heavy fabric, belonged only to K..","Suddenly she interrupted herself, placed her hand on K.’s as if to calm him, and whispered: “Hush, Bertold is watching us!” K. slowly lifted his gaze. In the doorway to the courtroom stood a young man; he was short, with slightly crooked legs, and attempted to lend himself an air of dignity by means of a short, scraggly reddish beard he kept fingering. K. looked at him with curiosity; he was the first student of the unknown system of jurisprudence he’d met on more or less human terms, a man who would presumably advance at some stage to higher official positions. The student, on the other hand, seemed to pay no attention at all to K., but simply gestured to the woman with one finger, which he removed for a moment from his beard, and walked over to the window; the woman bent down to K. and whispered: “Don’t be angry with me, please, please don’t, and don’t think badly of me; I have to go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his bandy legs. But I’ll come right back, and then I’ll go with you ; if you’ll take me along, I’ll go anywhere you wish, you can do with me what you like, I’ll be happy to get out of here for as long as I can, the best of course would be forever.” She stroked K.’s hand once more, sprang up, and ran to the window. Instinctively, K. grabbed for her hand in the empty air. The woman did tempt him, and no matter how hard he thought about it, he could see no good reason not to give in to that temptation. The fleeting objection that the woman was ensnaring him on the court’s behalf he easily brushed aside. How could she ensnare him? Wouldn’t he still be free enough to simply smash the entire court, at least insofar as it touched him? Couldn’t he grant himself that small degree of self-confidence? And her offer of help sounded sincere, and was perhaps not without value. And there was perhaps no better way to revenge himself upon the examining magistrate and his retinue than taking this woman away from them for himself. Then the time might come when, late one night, after long hours of exhausting labor on his false reports about K., the examining magistrate would find the bed of the woman empty. And empty because she belonged to K., because this woman at the window, this voluptuous, supple, warm body in a dark dress of heavy, coarse material, belonged to K., and K. alone.","Suddenly she broke off, laid her hand on K.'s hand as if to reassure him, and said: ""Hush, Bertold is watching us."" K. slowly raised his eyes. In the door of the courtroom a young man was standing; he was small, his legs were slightly bowed, and he strove to add dignity to his appearance by wearing a short, straggling reddish beard, which he was always fingering. K. stared at him with interest, this was the first student of the mysterious jurisprudence whom he had encountered, as it were, on human terms, a man, too, who would presumably attain to one of the higher official positions some day. The student, however, seemed to take not the slightest notice of K., he merely made a sign to the woman with one finger, which he withdrew for a moment from his beard, and went over to the window. The woman bent over K. and whispered: ""Don't be angry with me, please don't think badly of me, I must go to him now, and he's a dreadful-looking creature, just see what bandy legs he has. But I'll come back in a minute and then I'll go with you if you'll take me with you, I'll go with you wherever you like, you can do with me what you please, I'll be glad if I can only get out of here for a long time, and I wish it could be forever. "" She gave K.'s hand a last caress, jumped up, and ran to the window. Despite himself K.'s hand reached out after hers in the empty air. The woman really attracted him, and after mature reflection he could find no valid reason why he should not yield to that attraction. He dismissed without difficulty the fleeting suspicion that she might be trying to lay a trap for him on the instructions of the Court. In what way could she entrap him? Wasn't he still free enough to flout the authority of this Court once and for all, at least as far as it concerned him? Could he not trust himself to this trifling extent? And her offer of help had sounded sincere and was probably not worthless. And probably there could be no more fitting revenge on the Examining Magistrate and his henchmen than to wrest this woman from them and take her himself. Then some night the Examining Magistrate, after long and arduous labor on his lying reports about K., might come to the woman's bed and find it empty. Empty because she had gone off with K., because the woman now standing in the window, that supple, voluptuous warm body under the coarse heavy, dark dress, belonged to K. and to K. alone.","She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K.'s as if she wanted to calm him down, and whispered, “Be quiet, Berthold is watching us.” K. slowly looked up. In the doorway to the courtroom stood a young man, he was short, his legs were not quite straight, and he continually moved his finger round in a short, thin, red beard with which he hoped to make himself look dignified. K. looked at him with some curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who would even most likely attain high office one day. The student, in contrast, seemed to take no notice of K. at all, he merely withdrew his finger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went over to the window, the woman leant over to K. and whispered, “Don't be cross with me, please don't, and please don't think ill of me either, I've got to go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his bent legs. But I'll come straight back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me, I'll go wherever you want, you can do whatever you like with me , I'll be happy if I can be away from here for as long as possible, it'd be best if I could get away from here for good.” She stroked K.'s hand once more, jumped up and ran over to the window. Before he realised it, K. grasped for her hand but failed to catch it. He really was attracted to the woman, and even after thinking hard about it could find no good reason why he should not give in to her allure. It briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court, but that was an objection he had no difficulty in fending off. In what way could she entrap him? Was he not still free, so free that he could crush the entire court whenever he wanted, as least where it concerned him? Could he not have that much confidence in himself? And her offer of help sounded sincere, and maybe it wasn't quite worthless. And maybe there was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and have her for himself. Maybe then, after much hard work writing dishonest reports about K., the judge would go to the woman's bed late one night and find it empty. And it would be empty because she belonged to K., because this woman at the window, this lush, supple, warm body in its sombre clothes of rough, heavy material belonged to him, totally to him and to him alone.","She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K.'s as if she wanted to calm him down, and whispered, ""Be quiet, Berthold is watching us.""

"An diesem Abend aber – der Tag war unter angestrengter Arbeit und vielen ehrenden und freundschaftlichen Geburtstagswünschen schnell verlaufen – wollte K. sofort nach Hause gehen. In allen kleinen Pausen der Tagesarbeit hatte er daran gedacht; ohne genau zu wissen, was er meinte, schien es ihm, als ob durch die Vorfälle des Morgens eine große Unordnung in der ganzen Wohnung der Frau Grubach verursacht worden sei und daß gerade er nötig sei, um die Ordnung wiederherzustellen. War aber einmal diese Ordnung hergestellt, dann war jede Spur jener Vorfälle ausgelöscht und alles nahm seinen alten Gang wieder auf. Insbesondere von den drei Beamten war nichts zu befürchten, sie waren wieder in die große Beamtenschaft der Bank versenkt, es war keine Veränderung an ihnen zu bemerken. K. hatte sie öfters einzeln und gemeinsam in sein Büro berufen, zu keinem andern Zweck, als um sie zu beobachten; immer hatte er sie befriedigt entlassen können.","But that evening – the day had passed quickly with hard work and many honorable and friendly birthday wishes – K. wanted to go home immediately. He had thought about it during all the little breaks in the day's work; without knowing exactly what he meant, it seemed to him that the events of the morning had caused a great deal of disorder in Frau Grubach's entire apartment and that he was the one he needed to restore order. But once this order was established, every trace of those incidents was erased and everything resumed its old course. There was nothing to fear from the three officials in particular, they had sunk back into the bank's large body of officials, and there was no noticeable change in them. K. had often summoned them to his office, individually and together, for no other purpose than to observe them; he had always been able to dismiss her satisfied.","But on this particular evening—the day had passed quickly, filled with hard work and a number of friendly and deferential birthday greetings—K. wanted to go straight home. He had thought about it during all the small breaks throughout the workday: without knowing exactly how, it seemed to him as if the morning’s events had thrown the whole of Frau Grubach’s boardinghouse into disarray, and that he was the one needed to restore order. Once that order had been restored, all trace of what had happened would be wiped away, and the old routine would resume. There was nothing in particular to fear from the three clerks; they had faded back into the larger realm of the bank’s bureaucracy without any noticeable change. K. had called them to his office several times, both individually and as a group, for no other purpose than to observe them; he had always been able to dismiss them totally satisfied.","But on this evening -- the day had passed quickly, filled with pressing work and many flattering and friendly birthday wishes -- K. resolved to go straight home. During every brief pause in the day's work he had kept this resolve in mind; without his quite knowing why, it seemed to him that the whole household of Frau Grubach had been thrown into great disorder by the events of the morning and that it was his task alone to put it right again. Once order was restored, every trace of these events would be obliterated and things would resume their old course. From the three clerks themselves nothing was to be feared, they had been absorbed once more in the great hierarchy of the Bank, no change was to be remarked in them. K. had several times called them singly and collectively to his room, with no other purpose than to observe them: each time he had dismissed them again with a quiet mind.","That evening, though,—the day had passed quickly with a lot of hard work and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings—K. wanted to go straight home.

Once order had been restored, every trace of those events would have been erased and everything would take its previous course once more. In particular, there was nothing to fear from the three bank officials, they had immersed themselves back into their paperwork and there was no alteration to be seen in them.

"»Was mir geschehen ist«, fuhr K. fort, etwas leiser als früher, und suchte immer wieder die Gesichter der ersten Reihe ab, was seiner Rede einen etwas fahrigen Ausdruck gab, »was mir geschehen ist, ist ja nur ein einzelner Fall und als solcher nicht sehr wichtig, da ich es nicht sehr schwer nehme, aber es ist das Zeichen eines Verfahrens, wie es gegen viele geübt wird. Für diese stehe ich hier ein, nicht für mich.«","""What happened to me,"" K. continued, a little quieter than before, and kept searching the faces in the front row, which gave his speech a somewhat jittery expression, ""what happened to me is just a one-off case and not very important as such, as I don't take it very seriously, but it is the mark of a procedure practiced against many. I stand up for them here, not for me.«","“What has happened to me,” K. continued, somewhat more quietly than before, and constantly searching the faces of those in the front row, which made his speech seem slightly disjointed, “what has happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I don’t take it very seriously, but it is typical of the proceedings being brought against many people. I speak for them, not for myself.”","""What has happened to me,"" K. went on, rather more quietly than before, trying at the same time to read the faces in the first row, which gave his speech a somewhat disconnected effect, ""what has happened to me is only a single instance and as such of no great importance, especially as I do not take it very seriously, but it is representative of a misguided policy which is being directed against many other people as well. It is for these that I take up my stand here, not for myself.""","“What has happened to me,” continued K., with less of the vigour he had had earlier. He continually scanned the faces in the first row, and this gave his address a somewhat nervous and distracted character, “what has happened to me is not just an isolated case.

"Jemand mußte Josef K. verleumdet haben, denn ohne daß er etwas Böses getan hätte, wurde er eines Morgens verhaftet. Die Köchin der Frau Grubach, seiner Zimmervermieterin, die ihm jeden Tag gegen acht Uhr früh das Frühstück brachte, kam diesmal nicht. Das war noch niemals geschehen. K. wartete noch ein Weilchen, sah von seinem Kopfkissen aus die alte Frau, die ihm gegenüber wohnte und die ihn mit einer an ihr ganz ungewöhnlichen Neugierde beobachtete, dann aber, gleichzeitig befremdet und hungrig, läutete er. Sofort klopfte es und ein Mann, den er in dieser Wohnung noch niemals gesehen hatte, trat ein. Er war schlank und doch fest gebaut, er trug ein anliegendes schwarzes Kleid, das, ähnlich den Reiseanzügen, mit verschiedenen Falten, Taschen, Schnallen, Knöpfen und einem Gürtel versehen war und infolgedessen, ohne daß man sich darüber klar wurde, wozu es dienen sollte, besonders praktisch erschien. »Wer sind Sie?« fragte K. und saß gleich halb aufrecht im Bett. Der Mann aber ging über die Frage hinweg, als müsse man seine Erscheinung hinnehmen, und sagte bloß seinerseits: »Sie haben geläutet?« »Anna soll mir das Frühstück bringen«, sagte K. und versuchte, zunächst stillschweigend, durch Aufmerksamkeit und Überlegung festzustellen, wer der Mann eigentlich war. Aber dieser setzte sich nicht allzulange seinen Blicken aus, sondern wandte sich zur Tür, die er ein wenig öffnete, um jemandem, der offenbar knapp hinter der Tür stand, zu sagen: »Er will, daß Anna ihm das Frühstück bringt.« Ein kleines Gelächter im Nebenzimmer folgte, es war nach dem Klang nicht sicher, ob nicht mehrere Personen daran beteiligt waren. Obwohl der fremde Mann dadurch nichts erfahren haben konnte, was er nicht schon früher gewußt hätte, sagte er nun doch zu K. im Tone einer Meldung: »Es ist unmöglich«. »Das wäre neu«, sagte K., sprang aus dem Bett und zog rasch seine Hosen an. »Ich will doch sehen, was für Leute im Nebenzimmer sind und wie Frau Grubach diese Störung mir gegenüber verantworten wird.« Es fiel ihm zwar gleich ein, daß er das nicht hätte laut sagen müssen und daß er dadurch gewissermaßen ein Beaufsichtigungsrecht des Fremden anerkannte, aber es schien ihm jetzt nicht wichtig. Immerhin faßte es der Fremde so auf, denn er sagte: »Wollen Sie nicht lieber hierbleiben?« »Ich will weder hierbleiben, noch von Ihnen angesprochen werden, solange Sie sich mir nicht vorstellen.« »Es war gut gemeint«, sagte der Fremde und öffnete nun freiwillig die Tür. Im Nebenzimmer, in das K. langsamer eintrat, als er wollte, sah es auf den ersten Blick fast genau so aus wie am Abend vorher. Es war das Wohnzimmer der Frau Grubach, vielleicht war in diesem mit Möbeln, Decken, Porzellan und Photographien überfüllten Zimmer heute ein wenig mehr Raum als sonst, man erkannte das nicht gleich, um so weniger, als die Hauptveränderung in der Anwesenheit eines Mannes bestand, der beim offenen Fenster mit einem Buch saß, von dem er jetzt aufblickte. »Sie hätten in Ihrem Zimmer bleiben sollen! Hat es Ihnen denn Franz nicht gesagt?« »Ja, was wollen Sie denn?« sagte K. und sah von der neuen Bekanntschaft zu dem mit Franz Benannten, der in der Tür stehengeblieben war, und dann wieder zurück. Durch das offene Fenster erblickte man wieder die alte Frau, die mit wahrhaft greisenhafter Neugierde zu dem jetzt gegenüberliegenden Fenster getreten war, um auch weiterhin alles zu sehen. »Ich will doch Frau Grubach –«, sagte K., machte eine Bewegung, als reiße er sich von den zwei Männern los, die aber weit von ihm entfernt standen, und wollte weitergehen. »Nein«, sagte der Mann beim Fenster, warf das Buch auf ein Tischchen und stand auf. »Sie dürfen nicht weggehen, Sie sind ja verhaftet.« »Es sieht so aus«, sagte K. »Und warum denn?« fragte er dann. »Wir sind nicht dazu bestellt, Ihnen das zu sagen. Gehen Sie in Ihr Zimmer und warten Sie. Das Verfahren ist nun einmal eingeleitet, und Sie werden alles zur richtigen Zeit erfahren. Ich gehe über meinen Auftrag hinaus, wenn ich Ihnen so freundschaftlich zurede. Aber ich hoffe, es hört es niemand sonst als Franz, und der ist selbst gegen alle Vorschrift freundlich zu Ihnen. Wenn Sie auch weiterhin so viel Glück haben wie bei der Bestimmung Ihrer Wächter, dann können Sie zuversichtlich sein.« K. wollte sich setzen, aber nun sah er, daß im ganzen Zimmer keine Sitzgelegenheit war, außer dem Sessel beim Fenster. »Sie werden noch einsehen, wie wahr das alles ist«, sagte Franz und ging gleichzeitig mit dem andern Mann auf ihn zu. Besonders der letztere überragte K. bedeutend und klopfte ihm öfters auf die Schulter. Beide prüften K.s Nachthemd und sagten, daß er jetzt ein viel schlechteres Hemd werde anziehen müssen, daß sie aber dieses Hemd wie auch seine übrige Wäsche aufbewahren und, wenn seine Sache günstig ausfallen sollte, ihm wieder zurückgeben würden. »Es ist besser, Sie geben die Sachen uns als ins Depot,« sagten sie, »denn im Depot kommen öfters Unterschleife vor und außerdem verkauft man dort alle Sachen nach einer gewissen Zeit, ohne Rücksicht, ob das betreffende Verfahren zu Ende ist oder nicht. Und wie lange dauern doch derartige Prozesse, besonders in letzter Zeit! Sie bekämen dann schließlich allerdings vom Depot den Erlös, aber dieser Erlös ist erstens an sich schon gering, denn beim Verkauf entscheidet nicht die Höhe des Angebotes, sondern die Höhe der Bestechung, und weiter verringern sich solche Erlöse erfahrungsgemäß, wenn sie von Hand zu Hand und von Jahr zu Jahr weitergegeben werden.« K. achtete auf diese Reden kaum, das Verfügungsrecht über seine Sachen, das er vielleicht noch besaß, schätzte er nicht hoch ein, viel wichtiger war es ihm, Klarheit über seine Lage zu bekommen; in Gegenwart dieser Leute konnte er aber nicht einmal nachdenken, immer wieder stieß der Bauch des zweiten Wächters – es konnten ja nur Wächter sein – förmlich freundschaftlich an ihn, sah er aber auf, dann erblickte er ein zu diesem dicken Körper gar nicht passendes trockenes, knochiges Gesicht mit starker, seitlich gedrehter Nase, das sich über ihn hinweg mit dem anderen Wächter verständigte. Was waren denn das für Menschen? Wovon sprachen sie? Welcher Behörde gehörten sie an? K. lebte doch in einem Rechtsstaat, überall herrschte Friede, alle Gesetze bestanden aufrecht, wer wagte, ihn in seiner Wohnung zu überfallen? Er neigte stets dazu, alles möglichst leicht zu nehmen, das Schlimmste erst beim Eintritt des Schlimmsten zu glauben, keine Vorsorge für die Zukunft zu treffen, selbst wenn alles drohte. Hier schien ihm das aber nicht richtig, man konnte zwar das Ganze als Spaß ansehen, als einen groben Spaß, den ihm aus unbekannten Gründen, vielleicht weil heute sein dreißigster Geburtstag war, die Kollegen in der Bank veranstaltet hatten, es war natürlich möglich, vielleicht brauchte er nur auf irgendeine Weise den Wächtern ins Gesicht zu lachen, und sie würden mitlachen, vielleicht waren es Dienstmänner von der Straßenecke, sie sahen ihnen nicht unähnlich – trotzdem war er diesmal, förmlich schon seit dem ersten Anblick des Wächters Franz, entschlossen, nicht den geringsten Vorteil, den er vielleicht gegenüber diesen Leuten besaß, aus der Hand zu geben. Darin, daß man später sagen würde, er habe keinen Spaß verstanden, sah K. eine ganz geringe Gefahr, wohl aber erinnerte er sich – ohne daß es sonst seine Gewohnheit gewesen wäre, aus Erfahrungen zu lernen – an einige, an sich unbedeutende Fälle, in denen er zum Unterschied von seinen Freunden mit Bewußtsein, ohne das geringste Gefühl für die möglichen Folgen, sich unvorsichtig benommen hatte und dafür durch das Ergebnis gestraft worden war. Es sollte nicht wieder geschehen, zumindest nicht diesmal; war es eine Komödie, so wollte er mitspielen.","Someone must have slandered Josef K., because he was arrested one morning without having done anything wrong. The cook for Frau Grubach, his landlady, who brought him breakfast every day at eight in the morning, didn't come this time. That never happened before. K. waited a little longer, saw from his pillow the old woman who lived across the street from him and who was watching him with a curiosity that was quite unusual for her, but then, at the same time alienated and hungry, he rang the bell. Immediately there was a knock and a man he had never seen in this apartment entered. He was slim and yet solidly built, he wore a close-fitting black dress which, like traveling suits, was furnished with various pleats, pockets, buckles, buttons and a belt, and consequently without realizing what it was intended for , appeared particularly practical. ""Who are you?"" asked K. and immediately sat half upright in bed. But the man ignored the question, as if one had to accept his appearance, and simply said in turn: ""Did you ring the bell?"" ""Anna should bring me breakfast,"" said K. and tried, at first silently, to find out through attentiveness and consideration who the man actually was. But he didn't expose himself to his gaze for too long, instead turning to the door, which he opened a little to say to someone who was evidently standing just behind the door: ""He wants Anna to bring him breakfast."" A little one Laughter followed in the next room, it was not certain from the sound whether several people were involved. Although the stranger couldn't have learned anything from it that he hadn't known before, he said to K. in the tone of a report: ""It's impossible."" ""That would be new,"" said K., jumped out of bed and quickly put on his trousers. ""I want to see what kind of people are in the next room and how Frau Grubach will answer to me for this disturbance."" It occurred to him immediately that he shouldn't have said it out loud and that in doing so he was recognizing the stranger's right to supervise, so to speak, but it didn't seem important to him now. At least that's how the stranger took it, for he said, ""Wouldn't you rather stay here?"" ""I don't want to stay here or be spoken to by you until you introduce yourself."" ""It was well meant,"" said the stranger and voluntarily opened the door. The next room, which K. entered more slowly than he intended, looked almost exactly the same at first glance as it had the night before. It was Frau Grubach's living room, perhaps there was a little more space than usual in this room, which was overflowing with furniture, blankets, china and photographs, one did not recognize this immediately, all the less so since the main change was the presence of a man, who was sitting by the open window with a book from which he now looked up. 'You should have stayed in your room! Didn't Franz tell you?' 'Yes, what do you want?' said K. and looked from the new acquaintance to the person named Franz, who had stayed in the doorway, and then back again. Through the open window one saw the old woman again, who, with genuinely senile curiosity, had gone to the window now opposite so that she could continue to see everything. ""I want Frau Grubach after all,"" said K., made a movement as if he were tearing himself away from the two men who were standing far away from him, and wanted to go on. ""No,"" said the man by the window, tossing the book onto a table and getting up. 'You mustn't go away, you're under arrest.' 'It looks like it,' said K. 'And why is that?' he then asked. “We're not supposed to tell you that. Go to your room and wait. The process is now in place, and you will find out everything at the right time. I'm going beyond my commission if I speak to you in such a friendly way. But I hope no one else hears it but Franz, and he's being friendly to you, even against all regulations. If you continue to be as lucky as you were in choosing your guards, then you can be optimistic.' K. wanted to sit down, but now he saw that there was no seating in the whole room, apart from the armchair by the window. ""You'll see how true all this is,"" said Franz, walking towards him at the same time as the other man. The latter especially towered over K. and often patted him on the back. They both checked K.'s nightgown and said that he would now have to wear a much worse shirt, but that they would keep this shirt and the rest of his underwear and if it turned out well they would give it back to him. ""It's better you give the things to us than to the depot,"" they said, ""because there are often scams in the depot, and besides, all things are sold there after a certain time, regardless of whether the process in question is over or not . And how long such processes take, especially lately! In the end, you would get the proceeds from the depot, but first of all, this proceeds are small in themselves, because it is not the amount of the offer that decides the sale, but the amount of bribery, and experience has shown that such proceeds are further reduced if they are passed from hand to hand and passed on from year to year.” K. hardly paid any attention to these speeches, he did not value the right to dispose of his belongings that he might still have, it was much more important to him to get clarity about his situation; in the presence of these people he couldn't even think, the belly of the second guard - they could only be guards - kept bumping into him in a friendly manner, but when he looked up, he saw a dry, bony face with a strong nose turned sideways, communicating over him to the other guard. What kind of people were they? What were they talking about? Which agency did they belong to? After all, K. lived in a constitutional state, peace reigned everywhere, all laws were in force, who dared attack him in his apartment? He was always inclined to take everything as lightly as possible, to believe the worst only when the worst happened, to make no provision for the future even when all was threatened. But that didn't seem right to him here, you could see the whole thing as a joke, as a gross joke that his colleagues at the bank had thrown at him for unknown reasons, maybe because today was his thirtieth birthday, it was of course possible, maybe he only had to laugh in some way in the guards' faces, and they would laugh along, maybe they were porters from the street corner, they looked not unlike them - nevertheless this time, literally since the first sight of the guard Franz, he was determined not to giving away whatever advantage he might have over these people. K. saw a very slight danger in the fact that people would say later that he didn't know how to joke, but he remembered - without being in the habit of learning from experience - a few cases that were insignificant in themselves. in which, unlike his friends, he had consciously behaved carelessly, without the slightest feeling for the possible consequences, and had been punished for it by the result. It shouldn't happen again, at least not this time; if it was a comedy, he wanted to take part.","Someone must have slandered Josef K., for one morning, without having done anything wrong, he was arrested. His landlady, Frau Grubach, had a cook who brought him breakfast each day around eight, but this time she didn’t appear. That had never happened before. K. waited a while longer, watching from his pillow the old woman who lived across the way, who was peering at him with a curiosity quite unusual for her; then, both put out and hungry, he rang. There was an immediate knock at the door and a man he’d never seen before in these lodgings entered. He was slender yet solidly built, and was wearing a fitted black jacket, which, like a traveler’s outfit, was provided with a variety of pleats, pockets, buckles, buttons and a belt, and thus appeared eminently practical, although its purpose remained obscure. “Who are you?” asked K., and immediately sat halfway up in bed. But the man ignored the question, as if his presence would have to be accepted, and merely said in turn: “You rang?” “Anna’s to bring me breakfast,” K. said, scrutinizing him silently for a moment, trying to figure out who he might be. But the man didn’t submit to his inspection for long, turning instead to the door and opening it a little in order to tell someone who was apparently standing just behind it: “He wants Anna to bring him breakfast.” A short burst of laughter came from the adjoining room; it was hard to tell whether more than one person had joined in. Although the stranger could hardly have learned anything new from this, he nonetheless said to K., as if passing on a message: “It’s impossible.” “That’s news to me,” K. said, jumping out of bed and quickly pulling on his trousers. “I’m going to find out who those people are next door, and how Frau Grubach can justify such a disturbance just opposite me.” Although he realized at once that he shouldn’t have spoken aloud, and that by doing so he had, in a sense, acknowledged the stranger’s right to oversee his actions, that didn’t seem important at the moment. Still, the stranger took it that way, for he said: “Wouldn’t you rather stay here?” “I have no wish to stay here, nor to be addressed by you, until you’ve introduced yourself.” “I meant well,” the stranger said, and now opened the door of his own accord. In the adjoining room, which K. entered more slowly than he had intended, everything looked at first glance almost exactly as it had on the previous evening. It was Frau Grubach’s living room; perhaps there was slightly more space than usual amid the clutter of furniture coverlets china and photographs, but it wasn’t immediately obvious, especially since the major change was the presence of a man sitting by the open window with a book, from which he now looked up. “You should have stayed in your room! Didn’t Franz tell you that?” “What is it you want, then?” K. said, glancing from the new man to the one called Franz, who had stopped in the doorway, and then back again. Through the open window the old woman was visible again, having moved with truly senile curiosity to the window directly opposite, so she could keep an eye on everything. “I’d still like Frau Grubach—” K. said, and started to walk out, making a gesture as if he were tearing himself loose from the two men, who were, however, standing some distance from him. “No,” said the man by the window, tossing his book down on a small table and standing up. “You can’t leave, you’re being held.” “So it appears,” said K. “But why?” “We weren’t sent to tell you that. Go to your room and wait. Proceedings are under way and you’ll learn everything in due course. I’m exceeding my instructions by talking to you in such a friendly way. But I hope no one hears except Franz, and he’s being friendly too, although it’s against all regulations. If you’re as fortunate from now on as you’ve been with the choice of your guards, you can rest easy.” K. wanted to sit down, but he now saw that there was nowhere to sit in the entire room except for the chair by the window. “You’ll come to realize how true that all is,” said Franz, walking toward him with the other man. The latter in particular towered considerably over K. and patted him several times on the shoulder. Both of them examined K.’s nightshirt, saying that he would have to wear a much worse one now, but that they would look after this one, as well as the rest of his undergarments, and if his case turned out well, they’d return them to him. “You’re better off giving the things to us than leaving them in the depository,” they said, “there’s a lot of pilfering there, and besides, they sell everything after a time, whether the proceedings in question have ended or not. And trials like this last so long, particularly these days! Of course you’d get the proceeds from the depository in the end, but first of all they don’t amount to much, since sales aren’t based on the size of the offer but on the size of the bribe, and secondly, experience shows that they dwindle from year to year as they pass from hand to hand.” K. scarcely listened to this speech; he attached little value to whatever right he might still possess over the disposal of his things, it was much more important to him to gain some clarity about his situation; but he couldn’t even think in the presence of these men: the belly of the second guard—they surely must be guards—kept bumping against him in a positively friendly way, but when he looked up he saw a face completely at odds with that fat body: a dry, bony face, with a large nose set askew, consulting above his head with the other guard. What sort of men were they? What were they talking about? What office did they represent? After all, K. lived in a state governed by law, there was universal peace, all statutes were in force; who dared assault him in his own lodgings? He’d always tended to take things lightly, to believe the worst only when it arrived, making no provision for the future, even when things looked bad. But that didn’t seem the right approach here; of course he could treat the whole thing as a joke, a crude joke his colleagues at the bank were playing on him for some unknown reason, perhaps because today was his thirtieth birthday, that was certainly possible, perhaps all he had to do was laugh in the guards’ faces and they would laugh with him, perhaps they were porters off the street-corner, they looked a little like porters—nevertheless, from the moment he’d first seen the guard named Franz, he had decided firmly that this time he wouldn’t let even the slightest advantage he might have over these people slip through his fingers. K. knew there was a slight risk someone might say later that he hadn’t been able to take a joke, but he clearly recalled—although he generally didn’t make it a practice to learn from experience—a few occasions, unimportant in themselves, when, unlike his friends, he had deliberately behaved quite recklessly, without the least regard for his future, and had suffered the consequences. That wasn’t going to happen again, not this time at any rate: if this was a farce, he was going to play along.","SOMEONE must have traduced Joseph K., for without having done anything wrong he was arrested one fine morning. His landlady's cook, who always brought him his breakfast at eight o'clock, failed to appear on this occasion. That had never happened before. K. waited for a little while longer, watching from his pillow the old lady opposite, who seemed to be peering at him with a curiosity unusual even for her, but then, feeling both put out and hungry, he rang the bell. At once there was a knock at the door and a man entered whom he had never seen before in the house. He was slim and yet well knit, he wore a closely fitting black suit, which was furnished with all sorts of pleats, pockets, buckles, and buttons, as well as a belt, like a tourist's outfit, and in consequence looked eminently practical, though one could not quite tell what actual purpose it served. ""Who are you?"" asked K., half raising himself in bed. But the man ignored the question, as though his appearance needed no explanation, and merely said: ""Did you ring?"" ""Anna is to bring me my breakfast,"" said K., and then studied the fellow, Silently and carefully, trying to make out who he could be. The man did not submit to this scrutiny for very long, but turned to the door and opened it slightly so as to report to someone who was evidently standing just behind it: ""He says Anna is to bring him his breakfast. "" A short guffaw from the next room came in answer; and it rather sounded as if several people had joined in. Although the strange man could not have learned anything from it that he did not know already, he now said to K., as if passing on a statement: ""It can't be done."" ""This is news indeed,"" cried K., springing out of bed and quickly pulling on his trousers. ""I must see what people these are next door, and how Frau Grubach can account to me for such behavior. "" Yet it occurred to him at once that he should not have said this aloud and that by doing so he had in a way admitted the stranger's right to superintend his actions; still, that did not seem important to him at the moment. The stranger, however, took his words in some such sense, for he asked: ""Hadn't you better stay here?"" ""I shall neither stay here nor let you address me until you have introduced yourself."" ""I meant well enough,"" said the stranger, and then of his own accord threw the door open. In the next room, which K. entered more slowly than he had intended, everything looked at first glance almost as it had the evening before. It was Frau Grubach's living room; perhaps among all the furniture, rugs, china, and photographs with which it was crammed there was a little more free space than usual, yet one did not perceive that at first, especially as the main change consisted in the presence of a man who was sitting at the open window reading a book, from which he now glanced up. ""You should have stayed in your room! Didn't Franz tell you that?"" ""Yes, but what are you doing here?"" asked K., looking from his new acquaintance to the man called Franz, who was still standing by the door, and then back again. Through the open window he had another glimpse of the old woman, who with truly senile inquisitiveness had moved along to the window exactly opposite, in order to go on seeing all that could be seen. ""I'd better get Frau Grubach--"" said K., as if wrenching himself away from the two men (though they were standing at quite a distance from him) and making as if to go out. "" No,"" said the man at the window, flinging the book down on the table and getting up. ""You can't go out, you are arrested."" ""So it seems,"" said K. ""But what for?"" he added. ""We are not authorized to tell you that. Go to your room and wait there. Proceedings have been instituted against you, and you will be informed of everything in due course. I am exceeding my instructions in speaking freely to you like this. But I hope nobody hears me except Franz, and he himself has been too free with you, against his express instructions. If you continue to have as good luck as you have had in the choice of your warders, then you can be confident of the final result."" K. felt he must sit down, but now he maw that there was no seat in the whole room except the chair beside the window. ""You'll soon discover that we're telling you the truth,"" said Franz, advancing toward him simultaneously with the other man. The latter overtopped K. enormously and kept clapping him on th. shoulder. They both examined his nightshirt and said that he would have to wear a less fancy shirt now, but that they would take charge of this one and the rest of his underwear and, if his case turned out well, restore them to him later. ""Much better give these things to us than hand them over to the depot,"" they said, ""for in the depot there's lots of thieving, and besides they sell everything there after a certain length of time, no matter whether your came is settled or not. And you never know how long these cases will last, especially these days. Of course you would get the money out of the depot in the long run, but in the first place the prices they pay you are always wretched, for they sell your things to the best briber, not the best bidder, and anyhow it's well known that money dwindles a lot if it passes from hand to hand from one year to another."" K. paid hardly any attention to this advice. Any right to dispose of his own things which he might possess he did not prize very highly; far more important to him was the necessity to understand his situation clearly; but with these people beside him he could not even think. The belly of the second warder -- for they could only be warders -- kept butting against him in an almost friendly way, yet if he looked up he caught sight of a face which did not in the least suit that fat body, a dry, bony face with a great nose, twisted to one side, which seemed to be consulting over his head with the other warder. Who could these men be? What were they talking about? What authority could they represent? K. lived in a country with a legal constitution, there was universal peace, all the laws were in force; who dared seize him in his own dwelling? He had always been inclined to take things easily, to believe in the worst only when the worst happened, to take no care for the morrow even when the outlook was threatening. But that struck him as not being the right policy here, one could certainly regard the whole thing as a joke, a rude joke which his colleagues in the Bank had concocted for some unknown reason, perhaps because this was his thirtieth birthday, that was of course possible, perhaps he had only to laugh knowingly in these men's faces and they would laugh with him, perhaps they were merely porters from the street corner -- they looked very like it -- nevertheless his very first glance at the man Franz had decided him for the time being not to give away any advantage that he might possess over these people. There was a slight risk that later on his friends might possibly say he could not take a joke, but he had in mind -- though it was not usual with him to learn from experience -- several occasions, of no importance in themselves, when against all his friends' advice he had behaved with deliberate recklessness and without the slightest regard for possible consequences, and had had in the end to pay dearly for it. That must not happen again, at least not this time; if this was a comedy he would insist on playing it to the end.","Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had done nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested. Every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubach's cook— Mrs. Grubach was his landlady—but today she didn't come. That had never happened before. K. waited a little while, looked from his pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an inquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and disconcerted, rang the bell. There was immediately a knock at the door and a man entered. He had never seen the man in this house before. He was slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and close-fitting, with many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of which gave the impression of being very practical but without making it very clear what they were actually for. “Who are you?” asked K., sitting half upright in his bed. The man, however, ignored the question as if his arrival simply had to be accepted, and merely replied, “You rang?” “Anna should have brought me my breakfast,” said K. He tried to work out who the man actually was, first in silence, just through observation and by thinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to be looked at for very long. Instead he went over to the door, opened it slightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately behind it, “He wants Anna to bring him his breakfast.” There was a little laughter in the neighbouring room, it was not clear from the sound of it whether there were several people laughing. The strange man could not have learned anything from it that he hadn't known already, but now he said to K., as if making his report “It is not possible.” “It would be the first time that's happened,” said K., as he jumped out of bed and quickly pulled on his trousers. “I want to see who that is in the next room, and why it is that Mrs. Grubach has let me be disturbed in this way.” It immediately occurred to him that he needn't have said this out loud, and that he must to some extent have acknowledged their authority by doing so, but that didn't seem important to him at the time. That, at least, is how the stranger took it, as he said, “Don't you think you'd better stay where you are?” “I want neither to stay here nor to be spoken to by you until you've introduced yourself.” “I meant it for your own good,” said the stranger and opened the door, this time without being asked. The next room, which K. entered more slowly than he had intended, looked at first glance exactly the same as it had the previous evening. It was Mrs. Grubach's living room, over-filled with furniture, tablecloths, porcelain and photographs. Perhaps there was a little more space in there than usual today, but if so it was not immediately obvious, especially as the main difference was the presence of a man sitting by the open window with a book from which he now looked up. “You should have stayed in your room! Didn't Franz tell you?” “And what is it you want, then?” said K., looking back and forth between this new acquaintance and the one named 'Franz', who had remained in the doorway. Through the open window he noticed the old woman again, who had come close to the window opposite so that she could continue to see everything. She was showing an inquisitiveness that really made it seem like she was going senile. “I want to see Mrs. Grubach ... ,” said K., making a movement as if tearing himself away from the two men—even though they were standing well away from him— and wanted to go. “No,” said the man at the window, who threw his book down on a coffee table and stood up. “You can't go away when you're under arrest.” “That's how it seems,” said K. “And why am I under arrest?” he then asked. “That's something we're not allowed to tell you. Go into your room and wait there. Proceedings are underway and you'll learn about everything all in good time. It's not really part of my job to be friendly towards you like this, but I hope no-one, apart from Franz, will hear about it, and he's been more friendly towards you than he should have been, under the rules, himself. If you carry on having as much good luck as you have been with your arresting officers then you can reckon on things going well with you.” K. wanted to sit down, but then he saw that, apart from the chair by the window, there was nowhere anywhere in the room where he could sit. “You'll get the chance to see for yourself how true all this is,” said Franz and both men then walked up to K. They were significantly bigger than him, especially the second man, who frequently slapped him on the shoulder. The two of them felt K.'s nightshirt, and said he would now have to wear one that was of much lower quality, but that they would keep the nightshirt along with his other underclothes and return them to him if his case turned out well. “It's better for you if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom,” they said. “Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after a certain amount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved has come to an end or not. And cases like this can last a long time, especially the ones that have been coming up lately. They'd give you the money they got for them, but it wouldn't be very much as it's not what they're offered for them when they sell them that counts , it's how much they get slipped on the side, and things like that lose their value anyway when they get passed on from hand to hand, year after year.” K. paid hardly any attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value on what he may have still possessed or on who decided what happened to them. It was much more important to him to get a clear understanding of his position, but he could not think clearly while these people were here, the second policeman's belly—and they could only be policemen—looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K. looked up and saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body. His strong nose twisted to one side as if ignoring K. and sharing an understanding with the other policeman. What sort of people were these? What were they talking about? What office did they belong to? K. was living in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace, all laws were decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in his own home? He was always inclined to take life as lightly as he could, to cross bridges when he came to them, pay no heed for the future, even when everything seemed under threat. But here that did not seem the right thing to do. He could have taken it all as a joke, a big joke set up by his colleagues at the bank for some unknown reason, or also perhaps because today was his thirtieth birthday, it was all possible of course, maybe all he had to do was laugh in the policemen's face in some way and they would laugh with him, maybe they were tradesmen from the corner of the street, they looked like they might be ... but he was nonetheless determined, ever since he first caught sight of the one called Franz, not to lose any slight advantage he might have had over these people. There was a very slight risk that people would later say he couldn't understand a joke, but—although he wasn't normally in the habit of learning from experience—he might also have had a few unimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious friends, he had acted with no thought at all for what might follow and had been made to suffer for it. He didn't want that to happen again, not this time at least; if they were play-acting he would act along with them.","Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had done nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested.

If you carry on having as much good luck as you have been with your arresting officers then you can reckon on things going well with you."" K. wanted to sit down, but then he saw that, apart from the chair by the window, there was nowhere anywhere in the room where he could sit. ""You'll get the chance to see for yourself how true all this is,"" said Franz and both men then walked up to K. They were significantly bigger than him, especially the second man, who frequently slapped him on the shoulder. The two of them felt K.'s nightshirt, and said he would now have to wear one that was of much lower quality, but that they would keep the nightshirt along with his other underclothes and return them to him if his case turned out well. ""It's better for you if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom,"" they said. ""Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after a certain amount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved has come to an end or not. And cases like this can last a long time, especially the ones that have been coming up lately. They'd give you the money they got for them, but it wouldn't be very much as it's not what they're offered for them when they sell them that counts , it's how much they get slipped on the side, and things like that lose their value anyway when they get passed on from hand to hand, year after year."" K. paid hardly any attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value on what he may have still possessed or on who decided what happened to them. It was much more important to him to get a clear understanding of his position, but he could not think clearly while these people were here, the second policeman's belly - and they could only be policemen - looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K. looked up and saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body. His strong nose twisted to one side as if ignoring K. and sharing an understanding with the other policeman. What sort of people were these? What were they talking about? What office did they belong to? K. was living in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace, all laws were decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in his own home? He was always inclined to take life as lightly as he could, to cross bridges when he came to them, pay no heed for the future, even when everything seemed under threat. But here that did not seem the right thing to do. He could have taken it all as a joke, a big joke set up by his colleagues at the bank for some unknown reason, or also perhaps because today was his thirtieth birthday, it was all possible of course, maybe all he had to do was laugh in the policemen's face in some way and they would laugh with him, maybe they were tradesmen from the corner of the street, they looked like they might be - but he was nonetheless determined, ever since he first caught sight of the one called Franz, not to lose any slight advantage he might have had over these people. There was a very slight risk that people would later say he couldn't understand a joke, but - although he wasn't normally in the habit of learning from experience - he might also have had a few unimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious friends, he had acted with no thought at all for what might follow and had been made to suffer for it. He didn't want that to happen again, not this time at least; if they were play-acting he would act along with them."

Siebentes Kapitel,Seventh Chapter,"And you leave me, your uncle, waiting here in the rain for hours: just feel, I’m soaked clear through.”",Chapter 7,Chapter Seven.,Chapter Seven Lawyer - Manufacturer - Painter
"Eines Nachmittags – K. war gerade vor dem Postabschluß sehr beschäftigt – drängte sich zwischen zwei Dienern, die Schriftstücke hineintrugen, K.s Onkel Karl, ein kleiner Grundbesitzer vom Lande, ins Zimmer. K. erschrak bei dem Anblick weniger, als er schon vor längerer Zeit bei der Vorstellung vom Kommen des Onkels erschrocken war. Der Onkel mußte kommen, das stand bei K. schon etwa einen Monat lang fest. Schon damals hatte er ihn zu sehen geglaubt, wie er, ein wenig gebückt, den eingedrückten Panamahut in der Linken, die Rechte schon von weitem ihm entgegenstreckte und sie mit rücksichtsloser Eile über den Schreibtisch hinreichte, alles umstoßend, was ihm im Wege war. Der Onkel befand sich immer in Eile, denn er war von dem unglücklichen Gedanken verfolgt, bei seinem immer nur eintägigen Aufenthalt in der Hauptstadt müsse er alles erledigen können, was er sich vorgenommen hatte, und dürfe überdies auch kein gelegentlich sich darbietendes Gespräch oder Geschäft oder Vergnügen sich entgehen lassen. Dabei mußte ihm K., der ihm als seinem gewesenen Vormund besonders verpflichtet war, in allem möglichen behilflich sein und ihn außerdem bei sich übernachten lassen. »Das Gespenst vom Lande« pflegte er ihn zu nennen.","One afternoon - K. was very busy just before the post was closed - K.'s uncle Karl, a small landowner from the country, pushed his way into the room between two servants who were carrying documents. K. was less shocked at the sight than he had been a long time ago at the thought of his uncle coming. The uncle had to come, K. had been sure of that for about a month. Even then he thought he saw him stooping a little, his Panama hat pressed in in his left hand, stretching out his right hand to him from afar and handing it across the desk with ruthless haste, knocking over everything that stood in his way. The uncle was always in a hurry, for he was haunted by the unfortunate thought that with his only one-day stay in the capital he must be able to do everything that he had planned to do and, moreover, should not be allowed to have an occasional conversation or business or miss out on pleasure. K., who had a special obligation to him as his former guardian, had to help him in everything possible and also let him spend the night with him. ""The ghost of the country,"" he used to call him.","One afternoon—it was just before the final mail pickup and K. was very busy —K.’s Uncle Karl, a small landowner from the country, shoved his way between two assistants bringing in documents and entered the room. K. felt less alarm at seeing him than he had some time ago imagining his arrival. His uncle was bound to come, K. had been sure of that for over a month. Even back then he could picture him, slightly stooped, his Panama hat crushed in his left hand , his right hand already stretched out toward him from afar, thrusting it across the desk in reckless haste, knocking over everything in his way. His uncle was always in a hurry, for he was constantly driven by the unfortunate notion that he had to accomplish everything he’d set out to do within the single day to which his visits to the capital were always limited, nor did he dare let slip any opportunity for conversation, business, or pleasure that might happen to arise. K., who was particularly indebted to him because he was his former guardian, had to assist him in every way and put him up for the night as well. He called him “the Specter from the Countryside.”","ONE afternoon -- it was just before the day's letters went out and K. was very busy -- two clerks bringing him some papers to sign were thrust aside and his Uncle Karl, a small landowner from the country, came striding into the room. K. was the less alarmed by the arrival of his uncle since for a long time he had been shrinking from it in anticipation. His uncle was bound to turn up, he had been convinced of that for about a month past. He had often pictured him just as he appeared now, his back slightly bent, his panama hat crushed in his left hand, stretching out his right hand from the very doorway, and then thrusting it recklessly across the desk, knocking over everything that came in its way. His uncle was always in a hurry, for he was harassed by the disastrous idea that whenever he came to town for the day he must get through all the program he had drawn up for himself, and must not miss either a single chance of a conversation or a piece of business or an entertainment. In all this K., who as his former ward was peculiarly obliged to him, had to help him as best he could and also sometimes put him up for the night. "" A ghost from the past,"" he was in the habit of calling him.","One afternoon—K. was very busy at the time, getting the post ready —K.'s Uncle Karl, a small country land owner, came into the room, pushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some papers. K. had long expected his uncle to appear, but the sight of him now shocked K. far less than the prospect of it had done a long time before. His uncle was bound to come, K. had been sure of that for about a month. He already thought at the time he could see how his uncle would arrive, slightly bowed, his battered panama hat in his left hand, his right hand already stretched out over the desk long before he was close enough as he rushed carelessly towards K. knocking over everything that was in his way. K.'s uncle was always in a hurry, as he suffered from the unfortunate belief that he had a number things to do while he was in the big city and had to settle all of them in one day —his visits were only ever for one day—and at the same time thought he could not forgo any conversation or piece of business or pleasure that might arise by chance. Uncle Karl was K.'s former guardian, and so K. was duty-bound to help him in all of this as well as to offer him a bed for the night. “I'm haunted by a ghost from the country"", he would say.","One afternoon - K. was very busy at the time, getting the post ready - K.'s Uncle Karl, a small country land owner, came into the room, pushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some papers.

"Er hatte gedacht, das Haus schon von der Ferne an irgendeinem Zeichen, das er sich selbst nicht genau vorgestellt hatte, oder an einer besonderen Bewegung vor dem Eingang schon von weitem zu erkennen. Aber die Juliusstraße, in der es sein sollte und an deren Beginn K. einen Augenblick lang stehenblieb, enthielt auf beiden Seiten fast ganz einförmige Häuser, hohe, graue, von armen Leuten bewohnte Miethäuser. Jetzt, am Sonntagmorgen, waren die meisten Fenster besetzt, Männer in Hemdärmeln lehnten dort und rauchten oder hielten kleine Kinder vorsichtig und zärtlich an den Fensterrand. Andere Fenster waren hoch mit Bettzeug angefüllt, über dem flüchtig der zerraufte Kopf einer Frau erschien. Man rief einander über die Gasse zu, ein solcher Zuruf bewirkte gerade über K. ein großes Gelächter. Regelmäßig verteilt befanden sich in der langen Straße kleine, unter dem Straßenniveau liegende, durch ein paar Treppen erreichbare Läden mit verschiedenen Lebensmitteln. Dort gingen Frauen aus und ein oder standen auf den Stufen und plauderten. Ein Obsthändler, der seine Waren zu den Fenstern hinauf empfahl, hätte, ebenso unaufmerksam wie K., mit seinem Karren diesen fast niedergeworfen. Eben begann ein in besseren Stadtvierteln ausgedientes Grammophon mörderisch zu spielen.","He had thought he could recognize the house from afar by some sign he hadn't exactly imagined himself, or by a special movement in front of the entrance. But the Juliusstrasse, where it was supposed to be and at the beginning of which K. paused for a moment, contained almost completely monotonous houses on both sides, tall, gray apartment buildings inhabited by poor people. Now, on Sunday morning, most of the windows were occupied, men in shirtsleeves leaned there and smoked or held small children carefully and tenderly to the edge of the window. Other windows were piled high with bedding, above which a woman's disheveled head glimpsed. People called out to each other across the street, and such a call made K. laugh a lot. Small shops with various groceries, which were located below street level and could be reached by a few stairs, were regularly distributed along the long street. There women walked in and out or stood on the steps and chatted. A fruit seller who recommended his goods to the windows, just as inattentive as K., almost knocked him down with his cart. A gramophone that had been disused in the better parts of the city had just begun to play murderously.","He had thought he would recognize the building, even at a distance, by some sign he hadn’t visualized precisely, or by some unusual activity at the entrance. But Juliusstrasse, where it was supposedly located and at the top of which K. paused for a moment, was flanked on both sides by almost completely identical buildings, tall gray apartment houses inhabited by the poor. On this Sunday morning most of the windows were occupied; men in shirtsleeves leaned there smoking, or held small children with tender care at the windowsill. Other windows were piled high with bedding, above which the disheveled head of a woman briefly appeared. People called across the street to each other; one such exchange directly over K.’s head aroused loud laughter. At regular intervals along the long street, small shops offering various foodstuffs lay below street level, reached by a few steps. Women went in and out of them, or stood on the steps chatting. A fruit vendor who was offering his wares to the windows above, paying as little attention as K., almost knocked him to the ground with his pushcart. Just then a gramophone that had served its time in better sections of the city began to murder a tune.","He had thought that the house would be recognizable even at a distance by some sign which his imagination left unspecified, or by some unusual commotion before the door. But Juliusstrasse, where the house was said to be and at whose end he stopped for a moment, displayed on both sides houses almost exactly alike , high gray tenements inhabited by poor people. This being Sunday morning, most of the windows were occupied, men in shirt-sleeves were leaning there smoking or holding small children cautiously and tenderly on the window-ledges. Other windows were piled high with bedding, above which the disheveled head of a woman would appear for a moment. People were shouting to one another across the street; one shout just above K.'s head caused great laughter. Down the whole length of the street at regular intervals, below the level of the pavement, there were little general grocery shops, to which short flights of steps led down. Women were thronging into and out of these shops or gossiping on the steps outside. A fruit hawker who was crying his wares to the people in the windows above, progressing almost as inattentively as K. himself, almost knocked K. down with his pushcart. A phonograph which had seen long service in a better quarter of the town began stridently to murder a tune.","He had thought that he would recognise the building from a distance by some kind of sign, without knowing exactly what the sign would look like, or from some particular kind of activity outside the entrance. K. had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse, but when he stood at the street's entrance it consisted on each side of almost nothing but monotonous, grey constructions, tall blocks of flats occupied by poor people. Now, on a Sunday morning, most of the windows were occupied, men in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking, or carefully and gently held small children on the sills. Other windows were piled up with bedding, above which the dishevelled head of a woman would briefly appear. People called out to each other across the street, one of the calls provoked a loud laugh about K. himself. It was a long street, and spaced evenly along it were small shops below street level, selling various kinds of foodstuffs, which you reached by going down a few steps. Women went in and out of them or stood chatting on the steps. A fruitmonger, taking his goods up to the windows, was just as inattentive as K. and nearly knocked him down with his cart. Just then, a gramophone, which in better parts of town would have been seen as worn out, began to play some murderous tune.","He had thought that he would recognise the building from a distance by some kind of sign, without knowing exactly what the sign would look like, or from some particular kind of activity outside the entrance.

"K. starrte den Aufseher an. Schulmäßige Lehren bekam er hier von einem vielleicht jüngeren Menschen? Für seine Offenheit wurde er mit einer Rüge bestraft? Und über den Grund seiner Verhaftung und über deren Auftraggeber erfuhr er nichts? Er geriet in eine gewisse Aufregung, ging auf und ab, woran ihn niemand hinderte, schob seine Manschetten zurück, befühlte die Brust, strich sein Haar zurecht, kam an den drei Herren vorüber, sagte: »Es ist ja sinnlos«, worauf sich diese zu ihm umdrehten und ihn entgegenkommend, aber ernst ansahen und machte endlich wieder vor dem Tisch des Aufsehers halt. »Der Staatsanwalt Hasterer ist mein guter Freund«, sagte er, »kann ich ihm telephonieren?« »Gewiß«, sagte der Aufseher, »aber ich weiß nicht, welchen Sinn das haben sollte, es müßte denn sein, daß Sie irgendeine private Angelegenheit mit ihm zu besprechen haben.« »Welchen Sinn?« rief K., mehr bestürzt als geärgert. »Wer sind Sie denn? Sie wollen einen Sinn und führen das Sinnloseste auf, das es gibt? Ist es nicht zum Steinerweichen? Die Herren haben mich zuerst überfallen, und jetzt sitzen oder stehen sie hier herum und lassen mich vor Ihnen die Hohe Schule reiten. Welchen Sinn es hätte, an einen Staatsanwalt zu telephonieren, wenn ich angeblich verhaftet bin? Gut, ich werde nicht telephonieren.« »Aber doch«, sagte der Aufseher und streckte die Hand zum Vorzimmer aus, wo das Telephon war, »bitte, telephonieren Sie doch.« »Nein, ich will nicht mehr«, sagte K. und ging zum Fenster. Drüben war noch die Gesellschaft beim Fenster und schien nur jetzt dadurch, daß K. ans Fenster herangetreten war, in der Ruhe des Zuschauens ein wenig gestört. Die Alten wollten sich erheben, aber der Mann hinter ihnen beruhigte sie. »Dort sind auch solche Zuschauer«, rief K. ganz laut dem Aufseher zu und zeigte mit dem Zeigefinger hinaus. »Weg von dort«, rief er dann hinüber. Die drei wichen auch sofort ein paar Schritte zurück, die beiden Alten sogar noch hinter den Mann, der sie mit seinem breiten Körper deckte und, nach seinen Mundbewegungen zu schließen, irgend etwas auf die Entfernung hin Unverständliches sagte. Ganz aber verschwanden sie nicht, sondern schienen auf den Augenblick zu warten, in dem sie sich unbemerkt wieder dem Fenster nähern könnten. »Zudringliche, rücksichtslose Leute!« sagte K., als er sich ins Zimmer zurückwendete. Der Aufseher stimmte ihm möglicherweise zu, wie K. mit einem Seitenblick zu erkennen glaubte. Aber es war ebensogut möglich, daß er gar nicht zugehört hatte, denn er hatte eine Hand fest auf den Tisch gedrückt und schien die Finger ihrer Länge nach zu vergleichen. Die zwei Wächter saßen auf einem mit einer Schmuckdecke verhüllten Koffer und rieben ihre Knie. Die drei jungen Leute hatten die Hände in die Hüften gelegt und sahen ziellos herum. Es war still wie in irgendeinem vergessenen Büro. »Nun, meine Herren«, rief K., es schien ihm einen Augenblick lang, als trage er alle auf seinen Schultern, »Ihrem Aussehen nach zu schließen, dürfte meine Angelegenheit beendet sein. Ich bin der Ansicht, daß es am besten ist, über die Berechtigung oder Nichtberechtigung Ihres Vorgehens nicht mehr nachzudenken und der Sache durch einen gegenseitigen Händedruck einen versöhnlichen Abschluß zu geben. Wenn auch Sie meiner Ansicht sind, dann bitte –« und er trat an den Tisch des Aufsehers hin und reichte ihm die Hand. Der Aufseher hob die Augen, nagte an den Lippen und sah auf K.s ausgestreckte Hand; noch immer glaubte K., der Aufseher werde einschlagen. Dieser aber stand auf, nahm einen harten, runden Hut, der auf Fräulein Bürstners Bett lag, und setzte sich ihn vorsichtig mit beiden Händen auf, wie man es bei der Anprobe neuer Hüte tut. »Wie einfach Ihnen alles scheint!« sagte er dabei zu K. »wir sollten der Sache einen versöhnlichen Abschluß geben, meinten Sie? Nein, nein, das geht wirklich nicht. Womit ich andererseits durchaus nicht sagen will, daß Sie verzweifeln sollen. Nein, warum denn? Sie sind nur verhaftet, nichts weiter. Das hatte ich Ihnen mitzuteilen, habe es getan und habe auch gesehen, wie Sie es aufgenommen haben. Damit ist es für heute genug und wir können uns verabschieden, allerdings nur vorläufig. Sie werden wohl jetzt in die Bank gehen wollen?« »In die Bank?« fragte K., »ich dachte, ich wäre verhaftet.« K. fragte mit einem gewissen Trotz, denn obwohl sein Handschlag nicht angenommen worden war, fühlte er sich, insbesondere seitdem der Aufseher aufgestanden war, immer unabhängiger von allen diesen Leuten. Er spielte mit ihnen. Er hatte die Absicht, falls sie weggehen sollten, bis zum Haustor nachzulaufen und ihnen seine Verhaftung anzubieten. Darum wiederholte er auch: »Wie kann ich denn in die Bank gehen, da ich verhaftet bin?« »Ach so«, sagte der Aufseher, der schon bei der Tür war, »Sie haben mich mißverstanden. Sie sind verhaftet, gewiß, aber das soll Sie nicht hindern, Ihren Beruf zu erfüllen. Sie sollen auch Ihrer gewöhnlichen Lebensweise nicht gehindert sein.« »Dann ist das Verhaftetsein nicht sehr schlimm«, sagte K. und ging nahe an den Aufseher heran. »Ich meinte es niemals anders«, sagte dieser. »Es scheint aber dann nicht einmal die Mitteilung der Verhaftung sehr notwendig gewesen zu sein«, sagte K. und ging noch näher. Auch die anderen hatten sich genähert. Alle waren jetzt auf einem engen Raum bei der Tür versammelt. »Es war meine Pflicht«, sagte der Aufseher. »Eine dumme Pflicht«, sagte K. unnachgiebig. »Mag sein«, antwortete der Aufseher, »aber wir wollen mit solchen Reden nicht unsere Zeit verlieren. Ich hatte angenommen, daß Sie in die Bank gehen wollen. Da Sie auf alle Worte aufpassen, füge ich hinzu: ich zwinge Sie nicht, in die Bank zu gehen, ich hatte nur angenommen, daß Sie es wollen. Und um Ihnen das zu erleichtern und Ihre Ankunft in der Bank möglichst unauffällig zu machen, habe ich diese drei Herren, Ihre Kollegen, hier zu Ihrer Verfügung gehalten.« »Wie?« rief K. und staunte die drei an. Diese so uncharakteristischen, blutarmen, jungen Leute, die er immer noch nur als Gruppe bei den Photographien in der Erinnerung hatte, waren tatsächlich Beamte aus seiner Bank, nicht Kollegen, das war zu viel gesagt und bewies eine Lücke in der Allwissenheit des Aufsehers, aber untergeordnete Beamte aus der Bank waren es allerdings. Wie hatte K. das übersehen können? Wie hatte er doch hingenommen sein müssen von dem Aufseher und den Wächtern, um diese drei nicht zu erkennen! Den steifen, die Hände schwingenden Rabensteiner, den blonden Kullich mit den tiefliegenden Augen und Kaminer mit dem unausstehlichen, durch eine chronische Muskelzerrung bewirkten Lächeln. »Guten Morgen!« sagte K. nach einem Weilchen und reichte den sich korrekt verbeugenden Herren die Hand. »Ich habe Sie gar nicht erkannt. Nun werden wir also an die Arbeit gehen, nicht?« Die Herren nickten lachend und eifrig, als hätten sie die ganze Zeit über darauf gewartet, nur als K. seinen Hut vermißte, der in seinem Zimmer liegengeblieben war, liefen sie sämtlich hintereinander, ihn holen, was immerhin auf eine gewisse Verlegenheit schließen ließ. K. stand still und sah ihnen durch die zwei offenen Türen nach, der letzte war natürlich der gleichgültige Rabensteiner, der bloß einen eleganten Trab angeschlagen hatte. Kaminer überreichte den Hut, und K. mußte sich, wie dies übrigens auch öfters in der Bank nötig war, ausdrücklich sagen, daß Kaminers Lächeln nicht Absicht war, ja daß er überhaupt absichtlich nicht lächeln konnte. Im Vorzimmer öffnete dann Frau Grubach, die gar nicht sehr schuldbewußt aussah, der ganzen Gesellschaft die Wohnungstür, und K. sah, wie so oft, auf ihr Schürzenband nieder, das so unnötig tief in ihren mächtigen Leib einschnitt. Unten entschloß sich K., die Uhr in der Hand, ein Automobil zu nehmen, um die schon halbstündige Verspätung nicht unnötig zu vergrößern. Kaminer lief zur Ecke, um den Wagen zu holen, die zwei anderen versuchten offensichtlich, K. zu zerstreuen, als plötzlich Kullich auf das gegenüberliegende Haustor zeigte, in dem eben der große Mann mit dem blonden Spitzbart erschien und, im ersten Augenblick ein wenig verlegen darüber, daß er sich jetzt in seiner ganzen Größe zeigte, zur Wand zurücktrat und sich anlehnte. Die Alten waren wohl noch auf der Treppe. K. ärgerte sich über Kullich, daß dieser auf den Mann aufmerksam machte, den er selbst schon früher gesehen, ja den er sogar erwartet hatte. »Schauen Sie nicht hin!« stieß er hervor, ohne zu bemerken, wie auffallend eine solche Redeweise gegenüber selbständigen Männern war. Es war aber auch keine Erklärung nötig, denn gerade kam das Automobil, man setzte sich und fuhr los. Da erinnerte sich K., daß er das Weggehen des Aufsehers und der Wächter gar nicht bemerkt hatte, der Aufseher hatte ihm die drei Beamten verdeckt und nun wieder die Beamten den Aufseher. Viel Geistesgegenwart bewies das nicht, und K. nahm sich vor, sich in dieser Hinsicht genauer zu beobachten. Doch drehte er sich noch unwillkürlich um und beugte sich über das Hinterdeck des Automobils vor, um möglicherweise den Aufseher und die Wächter noch zu sehen. Aber gleich wendete er sich wieder zurück und lehnte sich bequem in die Wagenecke, ohne auch nur den Versuch gemacht zu haben, jemanden zu suchen. Obwohl es nicht den Anschein hatte, hätte er gerade jetzt Zuspruch nötig gehabt, aber nun schienen die Herren ermüdet, Rabensteiner sah rechts aus dem Wagen, Kullich links, und nur Kaminer stand mit seinem Grinsen zur Verfügung, über das einen Spaß zu machen leider die Menschlichkeit verbot.","K. stared at the supervisor. He received school lessons here from a perhaps younger person? Was he reprimanded for his openness? And he didn't learn anything about the reason for his arrest and who ordered it? He got into a certain excitement, paced up and down, which nobody stopped him, pushed back his cuffs, felt his chest, smoothed his hair, passed the three gentlemen, said: ""It's pointless,"" to which they responded turned to him and looked at him obligingly but seriously and finally stopped again in front of the overseer's table. ""Prosecutor Hasterer is my good friend,"" he said, ""can I phone him?"" ""Certainly,"" said the supervisor, ""but I don't know what the point of that is, unless you have some private matter have to discuss with him.' 'What's the point?' cried K., more dismayed than annoyed. ""Who are you, then? They want meaning and perform the most meaningless thing there is? Isn't it stone-hardening? The gentlemen attacked me first, and now they sit or stand around here and let me ride the High School in front of you. What's the point of phoning a prosecutor if I'm supposedly under arrest? Okay, I won't use the phone.' 'Yes,' said the warden and stretched out his hand to the antechamber where the phone was, 'please make the phone.' 'No, I don't want to anymore,' said K. und went to the window. Over there the company was still at the window and only now that K. had approached the window seemed a little disturbed in the quiet of watching. The old people wanted to get up, but the man behind them calmed them down. ""There are spectators like that there, too,"" K. called out loudly to the guard and pointed with his index finger. ""Get out of there,"" he then called across. The three of them immediately retreated a few steps, the two old men even behind the man who covered them with his broad body and, judging by the movements of his mouth, said something that was incomprehensible from a distance. But they didn't disappear completely, but seemed to be waiting for the moment when they could approach the window again unnoticed. ""Intrusive, inconsiderate people!"" said K. as he turned back into the room. The warden might have agreed with him, as K. thought he could see with a sideways glance. But it was just as possible that he hadn't been listening, for he had one hand pressed firmly to the table and seemed to be comparing the lengths of his fingers. The two guards sat on a suitcase covered with a decorative blanket and rubbed their knees. The three young people had their hands on their hips and were looking around aimlessly. It was quiet like some forgotten office. 'Well, gentlemen,' cried K., for a moment it seemed to him that he was carrying everyone on his shoulders, 'judging from your looks, my business should be over. I think it's best to stop thinking about the right or wrong of what you're doing and to shake hands and settle the matter on an amicable basis. If you agree with me, then please -' and he went to the overseer's table and shook his hand. The supervisor raised his eyes, bit his lips and looked at K.'s outstretched hand; K. still believed that the supervisor would hit it. But he got up, took a hard, round hat that was lying on Fraulein Bürstner's bed, and carefully put it on with both hands, as one does when trying on a new hat. 'How simple everything seems to you!' he said to K. 'we should bring the matter to a conciliatory conclusion, didn't you think? No, no, that's really not possible. Which, on the other hand, is not to say that you should despair. No why? You're just under arrest, nothing more. I had to tell you that, I did it and saw how you took it. That's enough for today and we can say goodbye, but only for the time being. Do you want to go to the bank now?' 'The bank?' asked K., 'I thought I was under arrest.' K. asked with a certain defiance, because although his handshake hadn't been accepted, he felt it , especially since the overseer got up, more and more independent of all these people. He played with them. If they left, he intended to follow them to the front door and offer to arrest them. That's why he repeated: 'How can I go to the bank since I'm under arrest?' 'Oh,' said the supervisor, who was already at the door, 'you misunderstood me. You're under arrest, of course, but that shouldn't prevent you from doing your job. You shouldn't be prevented from your usual way of life either.' 'Then being arrested isn't so bad,' said K. and walked up to the guard. ""I never meant it any other way,"" he said. ""But then it doesn't even seem necessary to have reported the arrest,"" said K. and went even closer. The others had also approached. All were now gathered in a narrow space by the door. ""It was my duty,"" said the overseer. ""A stupid duty,"" said K. unyieldingly. ""Perhaps,"" answered the overseer, ""but we don't want to waste our time with such talk. I assumed you wanted to go to the bank. Since you're watching all the words, I'll add: I'm not forcing you to go to the bank, I just assumed you wanted to. And to make that easier for you and to make your arrival at the bank as inconspicuous as possible, I have kept these three gentlemen, your colleagues, here at your disposal.' 'What?' K. exclaimed, staring at the three of them in amazement. These so uncharacteristic, anemic young people, whom he still only remembered as a group in the photographs, were in fact officials from his bank, not colleagues, that was saying too much and revealed a gap in the overseer's omniscience, but subordinate officials from the bank, however, were. How could K. have overlooked that? How he had to be accepted by the overseer and the guards not to recognize these three! The stiff, hand-waving Rabensteiner, the blond Kullich with the deep-set eyes and Kaminer with the obnoxious smile caused by a chronic muscle strain. ""Good morning!"" said K. after a while and shook hands with the gentlemen, who bowed correctly. 'I didn't even recognize you. So now we're going to get to work, aren't we?' The gentlemen nodded, laughing and eager, as if they had been waiting for this the whole time, only when K. missed his hat, which had been left lying around in his room, they all ran in single file to him fetch, which at least indicated a certain embarrassment. K. stood still and looked after them through the two open doors; the last one, of course, was the indifferent Rabensteiner, who had just set out at an elegant trot. Kaminer handed the hat over, and K. had to tell himself, as was often necessary at the bank, that Kaminer's smile wasn't intentional, that he actually couldn't smile on purpose. In the anteroom, Frau Grubach, who didn't look very guilty at all, opened the apartment door for the whole party, and K., as so often, looked down at her apron string, which cut so unnecessarily deeply into her powerful body. Downstairs, K., watch in hand, decided to take a car so as not to add to the half-hour delay unnecessarily. Kaminer ran to the corner to get the car, the other two were obviously trying to distract K. when suddenly Kullich pointed to the opposite house door, where the tall man with the blond goatee had just appeared and was a little embarrassed at first about the fact that he was now showing his full size, stepping back and leaning against the wall. The old people were probably still on the stairs. K. was annoyed with Kullich for drawing attention to the man he had seen before, even expected. ""Don't look!"" he blurted out, not noticing how conspicuous such a manner of speaking was to independent men. But no explanation was necessary either, because the car just arrived, we sat down and drove off. Then K. remembered that he hadn't even noticed the warden and the guards leaving, the warder had covered the three officers from him and now the officers again the guard. That didn't show much presence of mind, and K. resolved to observe himself more closely in this regard. But he couldn't help but turn around and leaned over the rear deck of the automobile, hoping to catch a glimpse of the overseer and the guards. But immediately he turned back and leaned comfortably in the corner of the car without even trying to look for anyone. Although it didn't seem like he needed encouragement just now, but now the gentlemen seemed tired, Rabensteiner looked out of the car to the right, Kullich to the left, and only Kaminer was available with his grin, unfortunately she was the one to joke about that humanity forbidden.","K. stared at the inspector. Was he to be lectured like a schoolboy by what might well be a younger man? To be reprimanded for his openness? And to learn nothing about why he had been arrested and on whose orders? He grew increasingly agitated, paced up and down, freely and without hindrance, pushed his cuffs back, felt his chest, brushed his hair into place, went past the three men, muttering, “It’s completely senseless,” at which they turned and looked at him in a friendly but serious way, and finally came to a stop before the inspector’s table. “Hasterer, the public prosecutor, is a good friend of mine,” he said, “can I telephone him?” “Certainly,” said the inspector, “but I don’t see what sense it makes, unless you have some private matter to discuss with him.” “What sense?” K. cried out, more startled than annoyed. “Who do you think you are? You ask what sense it makes, while you stage the most senseless performance imaginable? Wouldn’t it break a heart of stone? First these gentlemen assault me, and now they sit around or stand about and put me through my paces before you. What sense is there in telephoning a lawyer when I’ve supposedly been arrested? Fine, I won’t telephone.” “But do,” said the inspector, and waved toward the hall, where the telephone was, “please do telephone.” “No, I no longer wish to,” K. said, and went to the window. Across the way the group was still at the window, their peaceful observation now slightly disturbed as K. stepped to the window. The old couple started to rise, but the man behind them calmed them down. “There’s more of the audience over there,” K. cried out to the inspector and pointed outside. “Get away from there,” he yelled at them. The three immediately retreated a few steps, the old couple even withdrawing behind the man, who shielded them with his broad body and, judging by the movement of his lips, apparently said something that couldn’t be understood at that distance. They didn’t disappear entirely, however, but instead seemed to wait for the moment when they could approach the window again unnoticed. “Obnoxious, thoughtless people!” said K., turning back to the room. The inspector may have agreed with him, as he thought he noticed with a sideways glance. But it was equally possible he hadn’t been listening at all, for he had pressed his hand firmly down on the table and seemed to be comparing the length of his fingers. The two guards were sitting on a chest draped with an embroidered coverlet, rubbing their knees. The three young men had placed their hands on their hips and were gazing around aimlessly. Everything was silent, as in some deserted office. “Now, gentlemen,” K. said firmly, and for a moment it seemed to him as if he bore them all upon his shoulders, “judging by your expressions, this affair of mine must be closed. In my view, it would be best to stop worrying whether or not your actions were justified and end the matter on a note of reconciliation, by shaking hands. If you share my view, then please—” and he stepped up to the inspector’s table and held out his hand. The inspector looked up, chewed his lip, and regarded K.’s outstretched hand; K. still believed that the inspector would grasp it. But instead he rose, lifted a hard bowler from Fräulein Bürstner’s bed, and donned it carefully with both hands, like someone trying on a new hat. “How simple everything seems to you!” he said to K. as he did so. “So you think we should end this matter on a note of reconciliation? No, I’m afraid we really can’t. Although that’s not at all to say you should despair. Why should you? You’re under arrest, that’s all. I was to inform you of that, I’ve done so, and I’ve noted your reaction. That’s enough for today, and we can take our leave, temporarily of course. No doubt you wish to go to the bank now?” “To the bank?” K. asked. “I thought I was under arrest.” K. said this with a certain insistence, for although no one had shaken his hand, he was beginning to feel increasingly independent of these people, particularly once the inspector had stood up. He was toying with them. If they did leave, he intended to follow them to the door of the building and offer to let them arrest him. And so he said again: “How can I go to the bank if I’m under arrest?” “Oh, I see,” said the inspector, who was already at the door, “you’ve misunderstood me; you’re under arrest, certainly, but that’s not meant to keep you from carrying on your profession. Nor are you to be hindered in the course of your ordinary life.” “Then being under arrest isn’t so bad,” said K., approaching the inspector. “I never said it was,” he replied. “But in that case even the notification of arrest scarcely seems necessary,” said K., stepping closer still. The others had approached as well. Everyone was now gathered in a small area by the door. “It was my duty,” said the inspector. “A stupid duty,” said K. relentlessly. “Perhaps so,” replied the inspector, “but let’s not waste our time with such talk. I assumed you wished to go to the bank. Since you weigh every word so carefully, let me add that I’m not forcing you to go to the bank , I simply assumed you would want to. And to facilitate that, and to render your arrival at the bank as inconspicuous as possible, I’ve arranged for three of your colleagues here to be placed at your disposal.” “What?” K. cried out, and stared at the three in amazement. These so uncharacteristically anemic young men, whom he recalled only as a group by the photographs, were indeed clerks from his bank, not colleagues, that would be an overstatement, and indicated a gap in the inspector’s omniscience, but they were certainly lower-level clerks from the bank. How could K. have failed to notice that? How preoccupied he must have been by the inspector and the guards not to recognize these three. Wooden, arm-swinging Rabensteiner, blond Kullich with his deep-set eyes, and Kaminer with his annoying smile, produced by a chronic muscular twitch. “Good morning!” K. said after a moment, and held out his hand to the men, who bowed courteously. “I completely failed to recognize you. So now we can go to work, right?” The men nodded, laughing and eager, as if that was what they’d been waiting for all along, but when K. missed his hat, which he’d left in his room, all three tripped over each other’s heels to get it, which indicated a certain embarrassment on their part after all. K. stood still and watched them pass through the two open doors, the lethargic Rabensteiner bringing up the rear, of course, having broken into no more than an elegant trot. Kaminer handed over the hat and K. had to remind himself, as he often did at the bank, that Kaminer’s smile was not deliberate and that in fact he couldn’t smile deliberately at all. In the hall, Frau Grubach, not looking as if she felt any particular sense of guilt, opened the outer door for the whole company and K. looked down, as so often, at her apron strings, which cut so unnecessarily deeply into her robust body. Downstairs, watch in hand, K. decided to go by car so as not to extend unnecessarily what was already a half-hour delay. Kaminer ran to the corner to get a cab; the other two apparently felt they should entertain K. somehow, since Kullich suddenly pointed to the door of the building across the way, in which the man with the blond goatee had just appeared, and, at first embarrassed by now showing himself full-length, had retreated to the wall and leaned against it. The old couple were probably still on the stairs. K. was annoyed at Kullich for having pointed out the man, since he had already seen him himself, and in fact had been expecting him. “Don’t look over there,” he said quickly, without realizing how strange it must sound to speak that way to grown men. But no explanation was necessary, for at that moment the cab arrived, they got in, and it pulled away. Then K. remembered that he hadn’t seen the inspector and the guards leave: the inspector had diverted his attention from the three clerks, and now the clerks had done the same for the inspector. That didn’t show much presence of mind, and K. resolved to pay greater attention to such things. Even now he turned around involuntarily and leaned across the rear panel of the car to see if the inspector and guards might still be in sight. But he turned around again immediately, without having made the slightest effort to locate anyone, and leaned back comfortably into the corner of the cab. Despite appearances, he could have used some conversation, but now the men seemed tired : Rabensteiner gazed out of the car to the right, and Kullych to the left, leaving only Kaminer and his grin, which common decency unfortunately forbade as a topic of humor.","K. stared at the Inspector. Was he to be taught lessons in manners by a man probably younger than himself? To be punished for his frankness by a rebuke? And about the cause of his arrest and about its instigator was he to learn nothing? He was thrown into a certain agitation, and began to walk up and down -- nobody hindered him -- pushed back his cuffs, fingered his shirt-front, ruffled his hair, and as he passed the three young men said: ""This is sheer nonsense!"" Whereupon they turned toward him and regarded him sympathetically but gravely; at last he came to a stand before the Inspector's table. "" Hasterer, the lawyer, is a personal friend of mine,"" he said. ""May I telephone to him?"" ""Certainly,"" replied the Inspector, ""but I don't see what sense there would be in that, unless you have some private business of your own to consult him about."" ""What sense would there be in that ?"" cried K., more in amazement than exasperation. ""What kind of man are you, then? You ask me to be sensible and you carry on in the most senseless way imaginable yourself! It's enough to sicken the dogs. People first fall upon me in my own house and then lounge about the room and put me through my paces for your benefit. What sense would there be in telephoning to a lawyer when I'm supposed to be under arrest? All right, I won't telephone."" ""But do telephone if you want to,"" replied the Inspector, waving an arm toward the entrance hail, where the telephone was, ""please do telephone."" ""No, I don't want to now,"" said K., going over to the window. Across the street the party of three was still on the watch, and their enjoyment of the spectacle received its first slight check when K. appeared at the window. The two old people moved as if to get up, but the man at the back pacified them. ""Here's a fine crowd of spectators!"" cried K. in a loud voice to the Inspector, pointing at them with his finger. ""Go away,"" he shouted across. The three of them immediately retreated a few steps, the two ancients actually took cover behind the younger man, who shielded them with his massive body and to judge from the movements of his lips was saying something which, owing to the distance, could not be distinguished. Yet they did not remove themselves altogether, but seemed to be waiting for the chance to return to the window again unobserved. ""Officious, inconsiderate wretches !"" said K. as he turned back to the room again. The Inspector was possibly of the same mind, K. fancied, as far as he could tell from a hasty side-glance. But it was equally possible that the Inspector had not even been listening, for he had pressed one hand firmly on the table and seemed to be comparing the length of his fingers. The two warders sat on a chest draped with an embroidered cloth, rubbing their knees. The three young men were looking aimlessly round them with their hands on their hips. It was as quiet as in some deserted office. "" Come, gentlemen,"" cried K. -- it seemed to him for the moment as if he were responsible for all of them -- ""from the look of you this affair of mine seems to be settled. In my opinion the best thing now would be to bother no more about the justice or injustice of your behavior and settle the matter amicably by shaking hands on it. If you are of the same opinion, why, then--"" and he stepped over to the Inspector's table and held out his hand. The Inspector raised his eyes, bit his lips, and looked at K.'s hand stretched out to him; K. still believed he was going to close with the offer. But instead he got up, seized a hard round hat lying on Fräulein Bürstner's bed, and with both hands put it carefully on his head, as if he were trying it on for the first time. ""How simple it all seems to you!"" he said to K. as he did so. ""You think we should settle the matter amicably, do you? No, no, that really can't be done. On the other hand I don't mean to suggest that you should give up hope. Why should you? You are only under arrest, nothing more. I was requested to inform you of this. I have done so, and I have also observed your reactions. That's enough for today, and we can say good-by, though only for the time being, naturally. You'll be going to the Bank now, I suppose?"" ""To the Bank?"" asked K. ""I thought I was under arrest?"" K. asked the question with a certain defiance, for though his offer to shake hands had been ignored, he felt more and more independent of all these people, especially now that the Inspector had risen to his feet. He was playing with them. He considered the idea of running after them to the front door as they left and challenging them to take him prisoner. So he said again: ""How can I go to the Bank, if I am under arrest?"" ""Ah, I see,"" said the Inspector, who had already reached the door. ""You have misunderstood me. You are under arrest, certainly, but that need not hinder you from going about your business. Nor will you be prevented from leading your ordinary life."" ""Then being arrested isn't so very bad,"" said K., going up to the Inspector. ""I never suggested that it was,"" said the Inspector. ""But in that case it would seem there was no particular necessity to tell me about it,"" said K., moving still closer. The others had drawn near too. They were all gathered now in a little space beside the door. ""It was my duty,"" said the Inspector. "" A stupid duty,"" said K. inflexibly. ""That may be,"" replied the Inspector, ""but we needn't waste our time with such arguments. I was assuming that you would want to go to the Bank. As you are such a quibbler over words, let me add that I am not forcing you to go to the Bank, I was merely assuming that you would want to go. And to facilitate that, and render your arrival at the Bank as unobtrusive as possible, I have detained these three gentlemen here, who are colleagues of yours, to be at your disposal."" ""What?"" cried K., gaping at the three of them. These insignificant anemic young men, whom he had observed only as a group standing beside the photographs, were actually clerks in the Bank, not colleagues of his -- that was putting it too strongly and indicated a gap in the omniscience of the Inspector -- but they were subordinate employees of the Bank all the same. How could he have failed to notice that? He must have been very much taken up with the Inspector and the warders not to recognize these three young men. The stiff Rabensteiner swinging his arms, the fair Kullich with the deep-set eyes, and Kaminer with his insupportable smile, caused by a chronic muscular twitch. "" Good morning!"" said K. after a pause, holding out his hand to the three politely bowing figures. ""I didn't recognize you. Well, shall we go to our work now, eh? "" The young men nodded, smilingly and eagerly, as if they had been waiting all the time merely for this, but when K. turned to get his hat, which he had left in his room, they all fled one after the other to fetch it, which seemed to indicate a certain embarrassment. K. stood still and watched them through the two open doors; the languid Rabensteiner, naturally, brought up the rear, for he merely minced along at an elegant trot. Kaminer handed over the hat and K. had to tell himself expressly, as indeed he had often to do in the Bank, that Kaminer's smile was not intentional, that the man could not smile intentionally if he tried. Then Frau Grubach, who did not appear to be particularly conscious of any guilt, opened the front door to let the whole company out, and K. glanced down, as so often before, at her apron-string, which made such an unreasonably deep cut in her massive body. Down below he decided, his watch in his hand, to take a taxi so as to save any further delay in reaching the Bank , for he was already half an hour late. Kaminer ran to the corner to get a taxi, the other two were obviously doing their best to distract K., when suddenly Kullich pointed to the opposite house door, where the tall man with the reddish, pointed beard was emerging into sight, and immediately, a little embarrassed at showing himself in his full height, retreated against the wall and leaned there. The old couple must be still coming down the stairs. K. was annoyed at Kullich for drawing his attention to the man, whom he had already identified, indeed whom he had actually expected to see. ""Don't look across,"" he said hurriedly, without noticing how strange it must seem to speak in that fashion to grown-up men. But no explanation proved necessary, for at that moment the taxi arrived, they took their seats and drove off. Then K. remembered that he had not noticed the Inspector and the warders leaving, the Inspector had usurped his attention so that he did not recognize the three clerks, and the clerks in turn had made him oblivious of the Inspector. That did not show much presence of mind, and K. resolved to be more careful in this respect. Yet in spite of himself he turned round and craned from the back of the car to see if he could perhaps catch sight of the Inspector and the warders. But he immediately turned away again and leaned back comfortably in the corner without even having attempted to distinguish one of them. Unlikely as it might seem, this was lust the moment when he would have welcomed a few words from his companions, but the others seemed to be suddenly tired: Rabensteiner gazed out to the right, Kullich to the left, and only Kaminer faced him with his nervous grin, which, unfortunately, on grounds of humanity could not be made a subject of conversation.","K. stared at the supervisor. Was this man, probably younger than he was, lecturing him like a schoolmaster? Was he being punished for his honesty with a telling off? And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for his arrest or those who were arresting him? He became somewhat cross and began to walk up and down. No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair, went over to the three men, said, “It makes no sense,” at which these three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious expressions. He finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk. “State Attorney Hasterer is a good friend of mine,” he said, “can I telephone him?” “Certainly,” said the supervisor, “but I don't know what the point of that will be , I suppose you must have some private matter you want to discuss with him.” “What the point is?” shouted K., more disconcerted that cross. “Who do you think you are? You want to see some point in it while you're carrying out something as pointless as it could be? It's enough to make you cry! These gentlemen first accost me, and now they sit or stand about in here and let me be hauled up in front of you. What point there would be, in telephoning a state attorney when I'm ostensibly under arrest? Very well, I won't make the telephone call.” “You can call him if you want to,” said the supervisor, stretching his had out towards the outer room where the telephone was, “please, go on, do make your phone call.” “No, I don't want to any more,” said K., and went over to the window. Across the street, the people were still there at the window, and it was only now that K. had gone up to his window that they seemed to become uneasy about quietly watching what was going on. The old couple wanted to get up but the man behind them calmed them down. “We've got some kind of audience over there,” called K. to the supervisor, quite loudly, as he pointed out with his forefinger. “Go away,” he then called across to them. And the three of them did immediately retreat a few steps, the old pair even found themselves behind the man who then concealed them with the breadth of his body and seemed, going by the movements of his mouth, to be saying something incomprehensible into the distance. They did not disappear entirely, though, but seemed to be waiting for the moment when they could come back to the window without being noticed. “Intrusive, thoughtless people!” said K. as he turned back into the room. The supervisor may have agreed with him, at least K. thought that was what he saw from the corner of his eye. But it was just as possible that he had not even been listening as he had his hand pressed firmly down on the table and seemed to be comparing the length of his fingers. The two policemen were sitting on a chest covered with a coloured blanket, rubbing their knees. The three young people had put their hands on their hips and were looking round aimlessly. Everything was still, like in some office that has been forgotten about. “Now, gentlemen,” called out K., and for a moment it seemed as if he was carrying all of them on his shoulders, “it looks like your business with me is over with. In my opinion, it's best now to stop wondering about whether you're proceeding correctly or incorrectly, and to bring the matter to a peaceful close with a mutual handshake. If you are of the same opinion, then please... “ and he walked up to the supervisor's desk and held out his hand to him. The supervisor raised his eyes, bit his lip and looked at K.'s outstretched hand; K still believed the supervisor would do as he suggested. But instead, he stood up, picked up a hard round hat that was laying on Miss Borstner's bed and put it carefully onto his head, using both hands as if trying on a new hat. “Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't it,” he said to K. as he did so, “so you think we should bring the matter to a peaceful close, do you. No, no, that won't do. Mind you, on the other hand I certainly wouldn't want you to think there's no hope for you. No, why should you think that? You're simply under arrest, nothing more than that. That's what I had to tell you , that's what I've done and now I've seen how you've taken it. That's enough for one day and we can take our leave of each other, for the time being at least. I expect you'll want to go in to the bank now, won't you.” “In to the bank?” asked K., “I thought I was under arrest.” K. said this with a certain amount of defiance as, although his handshake had not been accepted, he was feeling more independent of all these people, especially since the supervisor had stood up. He was playing with them. If they left, he had decided he would run after them and offer to let them arrest him. That's why he even repeated, “How can I go in to the bank when I'm under arrest?” “I see you've misunderstood me,” said the supervisor who was already at the door. “It's true that you're under arrest, but that shouldn't stop you from carrying out your job. And there shouldn't be anything to stop you carrying on with your usual life.” “In that case it's not too bad, being under arrest,” said K., and went up close to the supervisor. “I never meant it should be anything else,” he replied. “It hardly seems to have been necessary notify me of the arrest in that case,” said K., and went even closer. The others had also come closer. All of them had gathered together into a narrow space by the door. “That was my duty,” said the supervisor. “A silly duty,” said K., unyielding. “Maybe so,” replied the supervisor, “only don't let's waste our time talking on like this. I had assumed you'd be wanting to go to the bank. As you're paying close attention to every word I'll add this: I'm not forcing you to go to the bank, I'd just assumed you wanted to. And to make things easier for you, and to let you get to the bank with as little fuss as possible I've put these three gentlemen, colleagues of yours, at your disposal.” “What's that?” exclaimed K., and looked at the three in astonishment. He could only remember seeing them in their group by the photographs, but these characterless, anaemic young people were indeed officials from his bank, not colleagues of his, that was putting it too high and it showed a gap in the omniscience of the supervisor, but they were nonetheless junior members of staff at the bank. How could K. have failed to see that? How occupied he must have been with the supervisor and the policemen not to have recognised these three! Rabensteiner, with his stiff demeanour and swinging hands, Kullich, with his blonde hair and deep-set eyes, and Kaminer, with his involuntary grin caused by chronic muscle spasms. “Good morning,” said K. after a while, extending his hand to the gentlemen as they bowed correctly to him. “I didn't recognise you at all. So, we'll go into work now, shall we?” The gentlemen laughed and nodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they had been waiting for all the time, except that K. had left his hat in his room so they all dashed, one after another, into the room to fetch it, which caused a certain amount of embarrassment. K. stood where he was and watched them through the open double doorway, the last to go, of course, was the apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no more than an elegant trot. Kaminer got to the hat and K., as he often had to do at the bank, forcibly reminded himself that the grin was not deliberate, that he in fact wasn't able to grin deliberately. At that moment Mrs. Grubach opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all the people were. She did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all, and K., as often before, looked down at the belt of her apron which, for no reason, cut so deeply into her hefty body. Once downstairs, K., with his watch in his hand, decided to take a taxi—he had already been delayed by half an hour and there was no need to make the delay any longer. Kaminer ran to the corner to summon it, and the two others were making obvious efforts to keep K. diverted when Kullich pointed to the doorway of the house on the other side of the street where the large man with the blonde goatee beard appeared and, a little embarrassed at first at letting himself be seen in his full height, stepped back to the wall and leant against it. The old couple were probably still on the stairs. K. was cross with Kullich for pointing out this man whom he had already seen himself, in fact whom he had been expecting. “Don't look at him!” he snapped, without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in this way. But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi arrived, they sat inside and set off. Inside the taxi, K. remembered that he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving —the supervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the three bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor. This showed that K. was not very attentive, and he resolved to watch himself more carefully in this respect. Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as he twisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to catch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could. But he turned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of the taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone. Although it did not seem like it, now was just the time when he needed some encouragement, but the gentlemen seemed tired just then, Rabensteiner looked out of the car to the right, Kullich to the left and only Kaminer was there with his grin at K.'s service. It would have been inhumane to make fun of that.","K. stared at the supervisor. Was this man, probably younger than he was, lecturing him like a schoolmaster? Was he being punished for his honesty with a telling off? And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for his arrest or those who were arresting him? He became somewhat cross and began to walk up and down. No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair, went over to the three men, said, ""It makes no sense,"" at which these three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious expressions. He finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk. "" State Attorney Hasterer is a good friend of mine,"" he said, ""can I telephone him?"" ""Certainly,"" said the supervisor, ""but I don't know what the point of that will be , I suppose you must have some private matter you want to discuss with him.""

""You can call him if you want to,"" said the supervisor, stretching his hand out towards the outer room where the telephone was, ""please, go on, do make your phone call."" ""No, I don't want to any more,"" said K., and went over to the window. Across the street, the people were still there at the window, and it was only now that K. had gone up to his window that they seemed to become uneasy about quietly watching what was going on.

But it was just as possible that he had not even been listening as he had his hand pressed firmly down on the table and seemed to be comparing the length of his fingers. The two policemen were sitting on a chest covered with a coloured blanket, rubbing their knees. The three young people had put their hands on their hips and were looking round aimlessly. Everything was still, like in some office that has been forgotten about. "" Now, gentlemen,"" called out K., and for a moment it seemed as if he was carrying all of them on his shoulders, ""it looks like your business with me is over with. In my opinion, it's best now to stop wondering about whether you're proceeding correctly or incorrectly, and to bring the matter to a peaceful close with a mutual handshake. If you are of the same opinion, then please... "" and he walked up to the supervisor's desk and held out his hand to him. The supervisor raised his eyes, bit his lip and looked at K.'s outstretched hand; K still believed the supervisor would do as he suggested. But instead, he stood up, picked up a hard round hat that was laying on Miss Bürstner's bed and put it carefully onto his head, using both hands as if trying on a new hat. ""Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't it,"" he said to K. as he did so, ""so you think we should bring the matter to a peaceful close, do you. No, no, that won't do. Mind you, on the other hand I certainly wouldn't want you to think there's no hope for you. No, why should you think that? You're simply under arrest, nothing more than that. That's what I had to tell you , that's what I've done and now I've seen how you've taken it. That's enough for one day and we can take our leave of each other, for the time being at least. I expect you'll want to go in to the bank now, won't you."" ""In to the bank?"" asked K., ""I thought I was under arrest."" K. said this with a certain amount of defiance as, although his handshake had not been accepted, he was feeling more independent of all these people, especially since the supervisor had stood up. He was playing with them. If they left, he had decided he would run after them and offer to let them arrest him. That's why he even repeated, ""How can I go in to the bank when I'm under arrest?"" ""I see you've misunderstood me,"" said the supervisor who was already at the door. ""It's true that you're under arrest, but that shouldn't stop you from carrying out your job. And there shouldn't be anything to stop you carrying on with your usual life."" ""In that case it's not too bad, being under arrest,"" said K., and went up close to the supervisor. ""I never meant it should be anything else,"" he replied. ""It hardly seems to have been necessary to notify me of the arrest in that case,"" said K., and went even closer. The others had also come closer. All of them had gathered together into a narrow space by the door. ""That was my duty,"" said the supervisor. "" A silly duty,"" said K., unyielding. "" Maybe so,"" replied the supervisor, ""only don't let's waste our time talking on like this. I had assumed you'd be wanting to go to the bank. As you're paying close attention to every word I'll add this: I'm not forcing you to go to the bank, I'd just assumed you wanted to. And to make things easier for you, and to let you get to the bank with as little fuss as possible I've put these three gentlemen, colleagues of yours, at your disposal."" ""What's that? "" exclaimed K., and looked at the three in astonishment. He could only remember seeing them in their group by the photographs, but these characterless, anaemic young people were indeed officials from his bank, not colleagues of his, that was putting it too high and it showed a gap in the omniscience of the supervisor, but they were nonetheless junior members of staff at the bank. How could K. have failed to see that? How occupied he must have been with the supervisor and the policemen not to have recognised these three! Rabensteiner, with his stiff demeanour and swinging hands, Kullich, with his blonde hair and deep-set eyes, and Kaminer, with his involuntary grin caused by chronic muscle spasms. "" Good morning,"" said K. after a while, extending his hand to the gentlemen as they bowed correctly to him. ""I didn't recognise you at all. So, we'll go into work now, shall we? "" The gentlemen laughed and nodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they had been waiting for all the time, except that K. had left his hat in his room so they all dashed, one after another, into the room to fetch it, which caused a certain amount of embarrassment. K. stood where he was and watched them through the open double doorway, the last to go, of course, was the apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no more than an elegant trot. Kaminer got to the hat and K., as he often had to do at the bank, forcibly reminded himself that the grin was not deliberate, that he in fact wasn't able to grin deliberately. At that moment Mrs. Grubach opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all the people were. She did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all, and K., as often before, looked down at the belt of her apron which, for no reason, cut so deeply into her hefty body. Once downstairs, K., with his watch in his hand, decided to take a taxi - he had already been delayed by half an hour and there was no need to make the delay any longer. Kaminer ran to the corner to summon it, and the two others were making obvious efforts to keep K. diverted when Kullich pointed to the doorway of the house on the other side of the street where the large man with the blonde goatee beard appeared and, a little embarrassed at first at letting himself be seen in his full height, stepped back to the wall and leant against it. The old couple were probably still on the stairs. K. was cross with Kullich for pointing out this man whom he had already seen himself, in fact whom he had been expecting. "" Don't look at him!"" he snapped, without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in this way. But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi arrived, they sat inside and set off. Inside the taxi, K. remembered that he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving - the supervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the three bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor. This showed that K. was not very attentive, and he resolved to watch himself more carefully in this respect. Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as he twisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to catch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could. But he turned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of the taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone. Although it did not seem like it, now was just the time when he needed some encouragement, but the gentlemen seemed tired just then, Rabensteiner looked out of the car to the right, Kullich to the left and only Kaminer was there with his grin at K.'s service. It would have been inhumane to make fun of that."
"Gerade war K. einmal wieder bis zur Tür gekommen, als es klopfte. Es war das Dienstmädchen, welches meldete, daß Fräulein Montag gern mit Herrn K. ein paar Worte sprechen möchte und daß sie ihn deshalb bitte, ins Eßzimmer zu kommen, wo sie ihn erwarte. K. hörte das Dienstmädchen nachdenklich an, dann wandte er sich mit einem fast höhnischen Blick nach der erschrockenen Frau Grubach um. Dieser Blick schien zu sagen, daß K. diese Einladung des Fräulein Montag schon längst vorausgesehen habe und daß sie auch sehr gut mit der Quälerei zusammenpasse, die er diesen Sonntagvormittag von den Mietern der Frau Grubach erfahren mußte. Er schickte das Dienstmädchen zurück mit der Antwort, daß er sofort komme, ging dann zum Kleiderkasten, um den Rock zu wechseln und hatte als Antwort für Frau Grubach, welche leise über die lästige Person jammerte, nur die Bitte, sie möge das Frühstücksgeschirr schon forttragen. »Sie haben ja fast nichts angerührt«, sagte Frau Grubach. Ach, tragen Sie es doch weg! rief K., es war ihm, als sei irgendwie allem Fräulein Montag beigemischt und mache es widerwärtig.","K. had just got as far as the door when there was a knock. It was the maid who reported that Miss Montag would like to have a few words with Herr K. and that she was therefore asking him to come into the dining room, where she was waiting for him. K. listened to the maid thoughtfully, then turned to the frightened Frau Grubach with an almost mocking look. This look seemed to say that K. had long foreseen Miss Montag's invitation and that it went very well with the torture he had to endure that Sunday morning from Frau Grubach's tenants. He sent the maid back with the answer that he would be right away, then went to the closet to change her coat and in reply to Frau Grubach, who was moaning softly about the annoying person, only asked her to take the breakfast dishes away . ""You hardly touched anything,"" said Frau Grubach. Oh, take it away! cried K., he felt as if Miss Montag had somehow been mixed into everything and was making it disgusting.","K. had just reached the door again when there was a knock. It was the maid, who reported that Fräulein Montag would like a few words with Herr K. and requested that he join her for that purpose in the dining room, where she was awaiting him. K. listened pensively to the maid, then turned with an almost scornful look to a startled Frau Grubach. His look seemed to say he’d long since expected Fräulein Montag’s invitation and that it fit in quite well with the general annoyance he was being forced to suffer at the hands of Frau Grubach’s boarders this Sunday morning. He sent the maid back to say that he would come at once, then went to his wardrobe to change his jacket, responding to Frau Grubach, who was complaining under her breath about the irksome young woman, merely by asking her to please clear away the breakfast dishes. “But you’ve hardly touched anything,” said Frau Grubach. “Oh, just take it away,” cried K; it seemed to him as if Fräulein Montag were somehow mixed up with it all, making it disgusting.","K. had just reached the door again when there was a knock.

His look seemed to say that he had long foreseen this invitation of Fräulein Montag's, and that it accorded very well with all the persecution he had had to endure that Sunday morning from Frau Grubach's boarders. He sent the maid back with the information that he would come at once, then went to his wardrobe to change his coat, and in answer to Frau Grubach, who was softly lamenting over the behavior of the importunate Fräulein Montag, had nothing to say but to request her to remove his breakfast tray. ""Why, you've scarcely touched anything,"" said Frau Grubach. "" Oh, do take it away,"" cried K., it seemed to him as if Fräulein Montag were somehow mixed up with the food and made it nauseating.","Just as K. once more reached the door, someone knocked at it. It was the maid, to say that Miss Montag would like to have a few words with Mr. K., and therefore requested that he come to the dining room where she was waiting for him.

"In Verlegenheit oder Ungeduld rückte der Untersuchungsrichter auf seinem Sessel hin und her.

"Ohne auf dieses Angebot zu antworten, stand K. ein Weilchen lang still. Vielleicht würden ihn die beiden, wenn er die Tür des folgenden Zimmers oder gar die Tür des Vorzimmers öffnete, gar nicht zu hindern wagen, vielleicht wäre es die einfachste Lösung des Ganzen, daß er es auf die Spitze trieb. Aber vielleicht würden sie ihn doch packen und, war er einmal niedergeworfen, so war auch alle Überlegenheit verloren, die er jetzt ihnen gegenüber in gewisser Hinsicht doch wahrte. Deshalb zog er die Sicherheit der Lösung vor, wie sie der natürliche Verlauf bringen mußte, und ging in sein Zimmer zurück, ohne daß von seiner Seite oder von Seite der Wächter ein weiteres Wort gefallen wäre.","Without answering this offer, K. stood still for a while. Perhaps the two of them wouldn't dare to stop him when he opened the door of the next room or even the door of the antechamber, perhaps the simplest solution would be for him to take it to the extreme.

So he preferred security to the solution that the natural course was bound to bring, and went back to his room without another word having been said either by himself or by the guard.","K. stood quietly for a moment without responding to this offer. Perhaps if he were to open the door to the next room, or even the door to the hall, the two would not dare stop him, perhaps the best solution would be to bring the whole matter to a head. But then they might indeed grab him, and once subdued he would lose any degree of superiority he might still hold over them. Therefore he preferred the safety of whatever solution would surely arise in the natural course of things and returned to his room without a further word having passed on either side.","Without replying to this offer K. remained standing where he was for a moment.

But perhaps they might seize him after all, and if he were once down, all the superiority would be lost which in a certain sense he still retained. Accordingly, instead of a quick solution he chose that certainty which the natural course of things would be bound to bring, and went back to his room without another word having been said by him or by the warders.","Without giving any answer to this offer, K. stood still for some time. Perhaps, if he opened the door of the next room or even the front door, the two of them would not dare to stand in his way, perhaps that would be the simplest way to settle the whole thing, by bringing it to a head. But maybe they would grab him, and if he were thrown down on the ground he would lose all the advantage he, in a certain respect, had over them.

"Wie sich doch der Direktor-Stellvertreter alles anzueignen verstand, was K. jetzt notgedrungen aufgeben mußte! Gab aber K. nicht mehr auf, als unbedingt nötig war? Während er mit unbestimmten und, wie er sich eingestehen mußte, sehr geringen Hoffnungen zu einem unbekannten Maler lief, erlitt hier sein Ansehen eine unheilbare Schädigung. Es wäre wahrscheinlich viel besser gewesen, den Winterrock wieder auszuziehen und wenigstens die zwei Herren, die ja nebenan doch noch warten mußten, für sich zurückzugewinnen. K. hätte es vielleicht auch versucht, wenn er nicht jetzt in seinem Zimmer den Direktor-Stellvertreter erblickt hätte, wie er im Bücherständer, als wäre es sein eigener, etwas suchte. Als K. sich erregt der Tür näherte, rief er: »Ach, Sie sind noch nicht weggegangen!« Er wandte ihm sein Gesicht zu, dessen viele straffe Falten nicht Alter, sondern Kraft zu beweisen schienen, und fing sofort wieder zu suchen an. »Ich suche eine Vertragsabschrift«, sagte er, »die sich, wie der Vertreter der Firma behauptet, bei Ihnen befinden soll. Wollen Sie mir nicht suchen helfen?« K. machte einen Schritt, aber der Direktor-Stellvertreter sagte: »Danke, ich habe es schon gefunden«, und kehrte mit einem großen Paket Schriften, das nicht nur die Vertragsabschrift, sondern gewiß noch vieles andere enthielt, wieder in sein Zimmer zurück.","How the deputy director knew how to appropriate everything that K. now had to give up! But didn't K. give up more than was absolutely necessary? While he ran off to an unknown painter with vague and, as he had to admit, very little hope, his reputation suffered irreparable damage.

As K. excitedly approached the door, he called out: ""Oh, you haven't left yet!""

"K. hatte sich inzwischen im Zimmer umgesehen, er wäre niemals selbst auf den Gedanken gekommen, daß man dieses elende kleine Zimmer ein Atelier nennen könnte.

In der Mitte des Zimmers war auf einer Staffelei ein Bild, das mit einem Hemd verhüllt war, dessen Ärmel bis zum Boden baumelten.

"Als K. eintrat, kam Fräulein Montag vom Fenster her an der einen Seite des Tisches entlang K. entgegen. Sie grüßten einander stumm. Dann sagte Fräulein Montag, wie immer den Kopf ungewöhnlich aufgerichtet: »Ich weiß nicht, ob Sie mich kennen. K. sah sie mit zusammengezogenen Augen an.« »Gewiß«, sagte er, »Sie wohnen doch schon längere Zeit bei Frau Grubach.« »Sie kümmern sich aber, wie ich glaube, nicht viel um die Pension,« sagte Fräulein Montag. »Nein«, sagte K. »Wollen Sie sich nicht setzen?« sagte Fräulein Montag. Sie zogen beide schweigend zwei Sessel am äußersten Ende des Tisches hervor und setzten sich einander gegenüber. Aber Fräulein Montag stand gleich wieder auf, denn sie hatte ihr Handtäschchen auf dem Fensterbrett liegengelassen und ging es holen; sie schleifte durch das ganze Zimmer. Als sie, das Handtäschchen leicht schwenkend, wieder zurückkam, sagte sie: »Ich möchte nur im Auftrag meiner Freundin ein paar Worte mit Ihnen sprechen. Sie wollte selbst kommen, aber sie fühlt sich heute ein wenig unwohl. Sie möchten sie entschuldigen und mich statt ihrer anhören. Sie hätte Ihnen auch nichts anderes sagen können, als ich Ihnen sagen werde. Im Gegenteil, ich glaube, ich kann Ihnen sogar mehr sagen, da ich doch verhältnismäßig unbeteiligt bin. Glauben Sie nicht auch?«","When K. entered, Fraulein Montag came towards K. from the window along one side of the table. They greeted each other silently. Then Miss Montag said, her head unusually erect as usual: ""I don't know if you know me. K. looked at her with narrowed eyes."" ""Certainly,"" he said, ""you've been staying with Frau Grubach for a long time."" ""But I don't think you care much about the pension,"" said Fraulein Montag. ""No,"" said K. ""Wouldn't you like to sit down?"" said Fraulein Montag. They both silently pulled out two chairs at the far end of the table and sat down opposite each other. But Miss Montag got up right away, because she had left her handbag on the windowsill and went to fetch it; she dragged across the room. When she came back, waving her handbag slightly, she said, 'I just want to say a few words to you on behalf of my friend. She wanted to come herself, but she's feeling a little uncomfortable today. You want to excuse them and listen to me instead of them. She couldn't have told you anything other than what I'm going to tell you. On the contrary, I think I can tell you even more since I'm relatively uninvolved. Don't you think so?'","As K. entered, Fräulein Montag left the window and approached him along one side of the table. They greeted each other in silence. Then Fräulein Montag, as always holding her head unusually erect, said: “I don’t know if you know me.” K. regarded her with a frown. “Of course,” he said, “you’ve been living at Frau Grubach’s for some time now.” “But I don’t think you pay much attention to the affairs of the boardinghouse,” said Fräulein Montag. “No,” said K. “Won’t you sit down,” said Fräulein Montag. In silence, they both drew out chairs from the very end of the table and sat down across from each other. But Fräulein Montag rose again immediately, for she had left her little handbag on the windowsill and went back to get it; she limped the whole length of the room. When she returned, gently swinging the little handbag, she said: “I just want to have a few words with you on behalf of my friend. She wanted to come herself, but she’s not feeling very well today. She asks you to forgive her and to hear me out instead. She couldn’t have said anything to you but what I’m going to say anyway. On the contrary, I think I can say more, since I’m relatively uninvolved. Don’t you think?”","When K. entered, Fräulein Montag advanced from the window along one side of the table to meet him. They greeted each other in silence. Then Fräulein Montag said, holding her head very erect as usual: ""I don't know if you know who I am."" K. stared at her with contracted brows. ""Of course I do,"" he said, ""you've been staying quite a long time with Frau Grubach, haven't you?"" ""But you don't take much interest in the boarders, I fancy,"" said Fräulein Montag. "" No,"" said K. ""Won't you take a seat?"" asked Fräulein Montag. In silence they pulled out two chairs at the very end of the table and sat down opposite each other. But Fräulein Montag immediately stood up again, for she had left her little handbag lying on the window sill and now went to fetch it; she trailed for it along the whole length of the room. As she came back, swinging the bag lightly in her hand, she said: ""I've been asked by my friend to say something to you, that's all. She wanted to come herself, but she is feeling a little unwell today. She asks you to excuse her and listen to me instead. She would not have said anything more to you, in any case, than I am going to say. On the contrary, I fancy that I can actually tell you more, as I am relatively impartial. Don't you think so too ?"" ""Well, what is there to say ?""","When K. entered, Miss Montag came towards him from the window along one side of the table. They greeted each other in silence. Then Miss Montag, her head unusually erect as always, said, “I'm not sure whether you know me.” K. looked at her with a frown. “Of course I do,” he said, “you've been living here with Mrs. Grubach for quite some time now.” “But I get the impression you don't pay much attention to what's going on in the lodging house,” said Miss Montag. “No,” said K. “Would you not like to sit down?” said Miss Montag. In silence, the two of them drew chairs out from the farthest end of the table and sat down facing each other. But Miss Montag stood straight up again as she had left her handbag on the window sill and went to fetch it; she shuffled down the whole length of the room. When she came back, the handbag lightly swinging, she said, “I'd like just to have a few words with you on behalf of my friend. She would have come herself, but she's feeling a little unwell today. Perhaps you'll be kind enough to forgive her and listen to me instead. There's anyway nothing that she could have said that I won't.

"K. wartete während der nächsten Woche von Tag zu Tag auf eine neuerliche Verständigung, er konnte nicht glauben, daß man seinen Verzicht auf Verhöre wörtlich genommen hatte, und als die erwartete Verständigung bis Samstagabend wirklich nicht kam, nahm er an, er sei stillschweigend in das gleiche Haus für die gleiche Zeit wieder vorgeladen. Er begab sich daher Sonntags wieder hin, ging diesmal geradewegs über Treppen und Gänge; einige Leute, die sich seiner erinnerten, grüßten ihn an ihren Türen, aber er mußte niemanden mehr fragen und kam bald zu der richtigen Tür. Auf sein Klopfen wurde ihm gleich aufgemacht, und ohne sich weiter nach der bekannten Frau umzusehen, die bei der Tür stehenblieb, wollte er gleich ins Nebenzimmer. »Heute ist keine Sitzung«, sagte die Frau. »Warum sollte keine Sitzung sein?« fragte er und wollte es nicht glauben. Aber die Frau überzeugte ihn, indem sie die Tür des Nebenzimmers öffnete. Es war wirklich leer und sah in seiner Leere noch kläglicher aus als am letzten Sonntag. Auf dem Tisch, der unverändert auf dem Podium stand, lagen einige Bücher. »Kann ich mir die Bücher anschauen?« fragte K., nicht aus besonderer Neugierde, sondern nur, um nicht vollständig nutzlos hier gewesen zu sein. »Nein«, sagte die Frau und schloß wieder die Tür, »das ist nicht erlaubt. Die Bücher gehören dem Untersuchungsrichter.«","During the next week K. waited day by day for a new understanding, he could not believe that his waiver of interrogations had been taken literally, and when the expected understanding did not come by Saturday evening, he assumed that he was tacitly in the same house for the same time summoned again. So he went there again on Sundays, this time walking straight down stairs and corridors; some people who remembered him greeted him at their doors, but he didn't have to ask anyone anymore and soon came to the right door. As soon as he knocked, the door was opened, and without looking any further for the familiar woman who stayed by the door, he wanted to go straight into the next room. ""There's no meeting today,"" the woman said. ""Why shouldn't there be a meeting?"" he asked, not wanting to believe it. But the woman convinced him by opening the door of the next room. It really was empty and in its emptiness it looked even more miserable than last Sunday. On the table, which remained unchanged on the dais, lay a few books. ""Can I look at the books?"" asked K., not out of any particular curiosity, just so that he wasn't completely useless here. ""No,"" said the woman and closed the door again, ""that's not allowed. The books belong to the coroner.”","K. waited from day to day throughout the following week for further notification; he couldn’t believe they had taken his waiver of interrogations literally, and when the expected notification had not arrived by Saturday evening, he took it as an implicit summons to appear again in the same building at the same time. So he returned on Sunday, but this time he went straight up the stairs and along the passageways; a few people who remembered him greeted him from their doors, but he no longer needed to ask the way and soon reached the right door. It opened at once at his knock, and without even glancing at the familiar face of the woman, who remained standing by the door, he headed directly for the adjoining room. “There’s no session today,” the woman said. “Why wouldn’t there be a session?” he asked, not really believing it. But the woman convinced him by opening the door to the next room. It was indeed empty and in its emptiness looked even more sordid than it had last Sunday. On the table, which stood unchanged on the platform, lay several books. “Can I look at the books?” K. asked, not out of any particular curiosity, but simply so that his presence was not entirely pointless. “No,” said the woman and shut the door again, “that’s not allowed. Those books belong to the examining magistrate.”","DURING the next week K. waited day after day for a new summons, he would not believe that his refusal to be interrogated had been taken literally, and when no appointment was made by Saturday evening, he assumed that he was tacitly expected to report himself again at the same address and at the same time. So he betook himself there on Sunday morning, and this time went straight up through the passages and stairways; a few people who remembered him greeted him from their doors, but he no longer needed to inquire of anybody and soon came to the right door. It opened at once to his knock, and without even turning his head to look at the woman, who remained standing beside the door, he made straight for the adjoining room. ""There's no sitting today,"" said the woman. ""Why is there no sitting?"" he asked; he could not believe it. But the woman convinced him by herself opening the door of the next room. It was really empty and in its emptiness looked even more sordid than on the previous Sunday. On the table, which still stood on the platform as before, several hooks were lying. "" May I glance at the books?"" asked K., not out of any particular curiosity, but merely that his visit here might not be quite pointless. "" No,"" said the woman, shutting the door again, ""that isn't allowed. The books belong to the Examining Magistrate.""","Every day over the following week, K. expected another summons to arrive, he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings had been taken literally, and when the expected summons really had not come by Saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected, without being told, to appear at the same place at the same time. So on Sunday, he set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation up the steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him and greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to ask anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door. It was opened as soon as he knocked and, paying no attention to the woman he had seen last time who was standing at the doorway, he was about to go straight into the adjoining room when she said to him “There's no session today”. “What do you mean; no session?” he asked, unable to believe it. But the woman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room. It was indeed empty, and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previous Sunday. On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been before with a few books laying on it. “Can I have a look at those books?” asked K., not because he was especially curious but so that he would not have come for nothing. “No,” said the woman as she re-closed the door, “that's not allowed.

"Sie waren aber noch nicht einmal hinaufgekommen, als oben der Maler die Tür gänzlich aufriß und mit einer tiefen Verbeugung K. einlud, einzutreten. Die Mädchen dagegen wehrte er ab, er wollte keine von ihnen einlassen, sosehr sie baten und sosehr sie versuchten, wenn schon nicht mit seiner Erlaubnis, so gegen seinen Willen einzudringen. Nur der Buckligen gelang es, unter seinem ausgestreckten Arm durchzuschlüpfen, aber der Maler jagte hinter ihr her, packte sie bei den Röcken, wirbelte sie einmal um sich herum und setzte sie dann vor die Tür bei den anderen Mädchen ab, die es, während der Maler seinen Posten verlassen hatte, doch nicht gewagt hatten, die Schwelle zu überschreiten. K. wußte nicht, wie er das Ganze beurteilen sollte, es hatte nämlich den Anschein, als ob alles in freundschaftlichem Einvernehmen geschehe. Die Mädchen bei der Tür streckten, eines hinter dem anderen, die Hälse in die Höhe, riefen dem Maler verschiedene scherzhaft gemeinte Worte zu, die K. nicht verstand, und auch der Maler lachte, während die Bucklige in seiner Hand fast flog. Dann schloß er die Tür, verbeugte sich nochmals vor K., reichte ihm die Hand und sagte, sich vorstellend: »Kunstmaler Titorelli.« K. zeigte auf die Tür, hinter der die Mädchen flüsterten, und sagte: »Sie scheinen im Hause sehr beliebt zu sein.« »Ach, die Fratzen!« sagte der Maler und suchte vergebens sein Nachthemd am Halse zuzuknöpfen. Er war im übrigen bloßfüßig und nur noch mit einer breiten, gelblichen Leinenhose bekleidet, die mit einem Riemen festgemacht war, dessen langes Ende frei hin und her schlug. »Diese Fratzen sind mir eine wahre Last«, fuhr er fort, während er vom Nachthemd, dessen letzter Knopf gerade abgerissen war, abließ, einen Sessel holte und K. zum Niedersetzen nötigte. »Ich habe eine von ihnen – sie ist heute nicht einmal dabei – einmal gemalt, und seitdem verfolgen mich alle. Wenn ich selbst hier bin, kommen sie nur herein, wenn ich es erlaube, bin ich aber einmal weg, dann ist immer zumindest eine da. Sie haben sich einen Schlüssel zu meiner Tür machen lassen, den sie untereinander verleihen. Man kann sich kaum vorstellen, wie lästig das ist. Ich komme zum Beispiel mit einer Dame, die ich malen soll, nach Hause, öffne die Tür mit meinem Schlüssel und finde etwa die Bucklige dort beim Tischchen, wie sie sich mit dem Pinsel die Lippen rot färbt, während ihre kleinen Geschwister, die sie zu beaufsichtigen hat, sich herumtreiben und das Zimmer in allen Ecken verunreinigen. Oder ich komme, wie es mir erst gestern geschehen ist, spätabends nach Hause – entschuldigen Sie, bitte, mit Rücksicht darauf meinen Zustand und die Unordnung im Zimmer –, also ich komme spätabends nach Hause und will ins Bett steigen, da zwickt mich etwas ins Bein, ich schaue unter das Bett und ziehe wieder so ein Ding heraus. Warum sie sich so zu mir drängen, weiß ich nicht, daß ich sie nicht zu mir zu locken suche, dürften Sie eben bemerkt haben. Natürlich bin ich dadurch auch in meiner Arbeit gestört. Wäre mir dieses Atelier nicht umsonst zur Verfügung gestellt, ich wäre schon längst ausgezogen.« Gerade rief hinter der Tür ein Stimmchen, zart und ängstlich: »Titorelli, dürfen wir schon kommen?« »Nein«, antwortete der Maler. »Ich allein auch nicht?« fragte es wieder. »Auch nicht«, sagte der Maler, ging zur Tür und sperrte sie ab.","But they hadn't even gotten upstairs when the painter opened the door completely and, with a deep bow, invited K. to come in. The girls, on the other hand, he fended off, not wanting to let any of them in, no matter how hard they begged and tried, if not with his permission, to intrude against his will. Only the hunchback managed to slip under his outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her by the skirts, spun her around once, and then dropped her in front of the door with the other girls, who, while the painter had left his post but had not dared to cross the threshold. K. didn't know how to judge the whole thing, because it seemed as if everything was happening on friendly terms. The girls by the door, one behind the other, stretched their necks in the air, called out various joking words to the painter that K. didn't understand, and the painter laughed too, while the hunchback almost flew in his hand. Then he closed the door, bowed to K. again, gave him his hand and said, introducing himself: ""Artist Titorelli."" K. pointed to the door, behind which the girls were whispering, and said: ""You seem very nice in the house ""Oh, the grimaces!"" said the painter, trying in vain to button his nightgown. He was otherwise barefoot and was wearing only wide, yellowish linen trousers fastened with a strap whose long end swung back and forth freely. ""These grimaces are a real burden to me,"" he continued, taking off his nightgown, the last button of which had just been torn off, fetching a chair and forcing K. to sit down. 'I drew one of them - she's not even here today - once and everyone has been following me ever since. When I'm here myself they only come in if I allow it, but once I'm gone there's always at least one there. They had a key made to my door, which they lend to each other. You can hardly imagine how annoying that is. For example, I come home with a lady I'm supposed to paint, open the door with my key and find the hunchback there at the little table, painting her lips red with a brush, while her little siblings, who she is to supervise, roam about and pollute the room in every corner. Or I come home late in the evening, as happened to me just yesterday – please excuse my condition and the mess in the room, out of consideration for that – well, I come home late in the evening and want to get into bed, something pinches me Leg, I look under the bed and I pull out another thing like that. I don't know why they rush to me like that, you may have noticed just now that I'm not trying to lure them to me. Of course, this also disrupts my work. If this studio hadn't been made available to me for free, I would have moved out long ago.' Just then a little voice called out from behind the door, tender and anxious: 'Titorelli, can we come?' 'No,' answered the painter. ""Not me either?"" she asked again. ""Not either,"" said the painter, going to the door and locking it.","They weren’t even all the way up yet, however, when the painter flung the door open wide and with a deep bow invited K. to enter. The girls, on the other hand, he fended off, he wouldn’t let a single one in, no matter how they begged, no matter how hard they tried to push their way in, if not with his permission, then against his will. Only the hunchback managed to slip under his outstretched arm, but the painter raced after her, seized her by the skirts, whirled her once around him, and then set her back down in front of the door with the other girls, who had not dared cross the threshold when the painter abandoned his post. K. didn’t know how to judge all this; it looked as if the whole thing was happening on friendly terms. The girls by the door craned their necks one after the other, called out various humorously intended remarks to the painter that K. couldn’t catch, and the painter laughed as well while the hunchback almost flew in his hands. Then he shut the door, bowed to K. again, held out his hand, and introduced himself: “I’m Titorelli, the artist.” K. pointed to the door, behind which the girls were whispering, and said: “You seem very popular here in the building.” “Oh those brats!” said the painter, and tried in vain to button his nightshirt around his neck. He was barefoot as well, and otherwise wore nothing but a pair of roomy yellow linen trousers, tied with a belt whose long end dangled loosely. “Those brats are a real burden to me,” he went on, giving up on his nightshirt, the last button of which had now come off, and fetching a chair, on which he made K. sit. “I painted one of them once—she isn’t even here today—and they’ve been pestering me ever since. If I’m here, they only come in when I let them, but if I go away, there’s always at least one of them here. They’ve had a key made to my door and lend it to each other. You can’t imagine how annoying that is. For instance I come home with a lady I’m supposed to paint, open the door with my key, and find let’s say the hunchback sitting at the little table there, painting her lips red with the brush, while her little sisters, the ones she’s supposed to be watching, wander around making a mess in every corner of the room. Or, as happened only yesterday, I come home late at night—in light of which I hope you’ll pardon my state and the disorder of the room —I come home late at night and start to get in bed when something pinches my leg; I look under the bed and pull out another one. Why they push themselves on me so I don’t know; you’ll have noticed yourself that I don’t try to lure them in. Of course they disturb my work too. If this atelier weren’t provided for me free, I would have moved out long ago.” Just then a small voice called from behind the door, softly and timidly: “Titorelli, can we come in yet?” “No,” answered the painter. “Not even just me?” it asked again. “Not even you,” said the painter, walking over to the door and locking it.","Yet they were still mounting toward the top when the painter flung the door wide open and with a deep bow invited K. to enter. As for the girls, he turned them off, he would not admit one of them, eagerly as they implored and hard as they tried to enter by force if not by permission. The hunchback alone managed to slip in under his outstretched arm, but he rushed after her, seized her by the skirts, whirled her once round his head, and then set her down before the door among the other girls, who had not dared meanwhile, although he had quitted his post, to cross the threshold. K. did not know what to make of all this, for they seemed to be on the friendliest terms together. The girls outside the door, craning their necks behind one another, shouted various jocular remarks at the painter which K. did not understand, and the painter was laughing too as he almost hurled the hunchback through the air. Then he shut the door, bowed once more to K., held out his hand, and said in introduction: ""I'm the painter Titorelli."" K. pointed at the door, behind which the girls were whispering, and said: ""You seem to be a great favorite here."" ""Oh, those brats !"" said the painter, trying unsuccessfully to button his nightshirt at the neck. He was barefooted and besides the nightshirt had on only a pair of wide-legged yellow linen trousers girt by a belt with a long end flapping to and fro. ""Those brats are a real nuisance,"" he went on, while he desisted from fiddling with his nightshirt -- since the top button had just come off -- fetched a chair, and urged K. to sit down. "" I painted one of them once -- not any of those you saw -- and since then they've all persecuted me. When I'm here myself they only come in if I let them, but whenever I go away there's always at least one of them here. They've had a key made for my door, and they lend it round. You can hardly imagine what a nuisance that is. For instance, if I bring a lady here whom I want to paint, I unlock the door with my own key and find, say, the hunchback over there at the table, reddening her lips with my paint brushes, while her little sisters, who she's supposed to keep an eye on, are scampering over the whole place and messing up every corner of the room. Or, and this actually happened last night, I come home very late -- by the way, that's why I'm in this state of disrepair, and the room too, please excuse it -- I come home late, then, and start climbing into bed and something catches me by the leg; I look under the bed and haul out another of these pests. Why they should make such a set at me I don't know, you must have noticed yourself that I don't exactly encourage them. And, of course, all this disturbs me in my work. If it hadn't been that I have free quarters in this studio I should have cleared out long ago."" Just then a small voice piped behind the door with anxious cajolery: ""Titorelli, can we come in now?"" ""No,"" replied the painter. ""Not even me? "" the voice asked again. ""Not even you,"" said the painter, and he went to the door and locked it.","They still had not arrived at the top, however, when the painter up above them suddenly pulled the door wide open and, with a deep bow, invited K. to enter. The girls, on the other hand, he tried to keep away, he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged him and however much they tried to get in—if they could not get in with his permission they would try to force their way in against his will. The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under his outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her by the skirt, span her once round and set her down again by the door with the other girls who, unlike the first, had not dared to cross the doorstep while the painter had left his post. K. did not know what he was to make of all this, as they all seemed to be having fun. One behind the other, the girls by the door stretched their necks up high and called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but which K. did not understand, and even the painter laughed as the hunchback whirled round in his hand. Then he shut the door, bowed once more to K., offered him his hand and introduced himself, saying, “Titorelli, painter”. K. pointed to the door, behind which the girls were whispering, and said, “You seem to be very popular in this building.” “Ach, those brats!” said the painter, trying in vain to fasten his nightshirt at the neck. He was also bare-footed and, apart from that, was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of yellowish linen trousers held up with a belt whose free end whipped to and fro. “Those kids are a real burden for me,” he continued. The top button of his nightshirt came off and he gave up trying to fasten it, fetched a chair for K. and made him sit down on it. “I painted one of them once—she's not here today—and ever since then they've been following me about. If I'm here they only come in when I allow it, but as soon as I've gone out there's always at least one of them in here. They had a key made to my door and lend it round to each other. It's hard to imagine what a pain that is. Suppose I come back home with a lady I'm going to paint, I open the door with my own key and find the hunchback there or something, by the table painting her lips red with my paintbrush, and meanwhile her little sisters will be keeping guard for her, moving about and causing chaos in every corner of the room. Or else, like happened yesterday, I might come back home late in the evening—please forgive my appearance and the room being in a mess , it is to do with them— so, I might come home late in the evening and want to go to bed, then I feel something pinching my leg, look under the bed and pull another of them out from under it. I don't know why it is they bother me like this , I expect you've just seen that I do nothing to encourage them to come near me. And they make it hard for me to do my work too, of course. If I didn't get this studio for nothing I'd have moved out a long time ago.” Just then, a little voice, tender and anxious, called out from under the door, “Titorelli, can we come in now?” “No,” answered the painter. “Not even just me, by myself?” the voice asked again. “Not even just you,” said the painter, as he went to the door and locked it.","They still had not arrived at the top, however, when the painter up above them suddenly pulled the door wide open and, with a deep bow, invited K. to enter.

""No,"" answered the painter. ""Not even just me, by myself?"" the voice asked again. ""Not even just you,"" said the painter, as he went to the door and locked it."
"K. stockte und sah vor sich auf den Boden. Vorläufig war er noch frei, er konnte noch weitergehen und durch eine der drei kleinen, dunklen Holztüren, die nicht weit vor ihm waren, sich davonmachen. Es würde eben bedeuten, daß er nicht verstanden hatte, oder daß er zwar verstanden hatte, sich aber darum nicht kümmern wollte. Falls er sich aber umdrehte, war er festgehalten, denn dann hatte er das Geständnis gemacht, daß er gut verstanden hatte, daß er wirklich der Angerufene war und daß er auch folgen wollte. Hätte der Geistliche nochmals gerufen, wäre K. gewiß fortgegangen, aber da alles still blieb, solange K. auch wartete, drehte er doch ein wenig den Kopf, denn er wollte sehen, was der Geistliche jetzt mache. Er stand ruhig auf der Kanzel wie früher, es war aber deutlich zu sehen, daß er K.s Kopfwendung bemerkt hatte. Es wäre ein kindliches Versteckenspiel gewesen, wenn sich jetzt K. nicht vollständig umgedreht hätte. Er tat es und wurde vom Geistlichen durch ein Winken des Fingers näher gerufen. Da jetzt alles offen geschehen konnte, lief er – er tat es auch aus Neugierde und um die Angelegenheit abzukürzen – mit langen, fliegenden Schritten der Kanzel entgegen. Bei den ersten Bänken machte er halt, aber dem Geistlichen schien die Entfernung noch zu groß, er streckte die Hand aus und zeigte mit dem scharf gesenkten Zeigefinger auf eine Stelle knapp vor der Kanzel. K. folgte auch darin, er mußte auf diesem Platz den Kopf schon weit zurückbeugen, um den Geistlichen noch zu sehen. »Du bist Josef K.«, sagte der Geistliche und erhob eine Hand auf der Brüstung in einer unbestimmten Bewegung. »Ja«, sagte K., er dachte daran, wie offen er früher immer seinen Namen genannt hatte, seit einiger Zeit war er ihm eine Last, auch kannten jetzt seinen Namen Leute, mit denen er zum erstenmal zusammenkam, wie schön war es, sich zuerst vorzustellen und dann erst gekannt zu werden. »Du bist angeklagt«, sagte der Geistliche besonders leise. »Ja«, sagte K., »man hat mich davon verständigt.« »Dann bist du der, den ich suche«, sagte der Geistliche. »Ich bin der Gefängniskaplan.« »Ach so«, sagte K. »Ich habe dich hierher rufen lassen«, sagte der Geistliche, »um mit dir zu sprechen.« »Ich wußte es nicht«, sagte K. »Ich bin hierhergekommen, um einem Italiener den Dom zu zeigen.« »Laß das Nebensächliche«, sagte der Geistliche. »Was hältst du in der Hand? Ist es ein Gebetbuch?« »Nein«, antwortete K., »es ist ein Album der städtischen Sehenswürdigkeiten.« »Leg es aus der Hand«, sagte der Geistliche. K. warf es so heftig weg, daß es aufklappte und mit zerdrückten Blättern ein Stück über den Boden schleifte. »Weißt du, daß dein Prozeß schlecht steht?« fragte der Geistliche. »Es scheint mir auch so«, sagte K. »Ich habe mir alle Mühe gegeben, bisher aber ohne Erfolg. Allerdings habe ich die Eingabe noch nicht fertig.« »Wie stellst du dir das Ende vor?« fragte der Geistliche. »Früher dachte ich, es müsse gut enden«, sagte K., »jetzt zweifle ich daran manchmal selbst. Ich weiß nicht, wie es enden wird. Weißt du es?« »Nein«, sagte der Geistliche, »aber ich fürchte, es wird schlecht enden. Man hält dich für schuldig. Dein Prozeß wird vielleicht über ein niedriges Gericht gar nicht hinauskommen. Man hält wenigstens vorläufig deine Schuld für erwiesen.« »Ich bin aber nicht schuldig«, sagte K., »es ist ein Irrtum. Wie kann denn ein Mensch überhaupt schuldig sein. Wir sind hier doch alle Menschen, einer wie der andere.« »Das ist richtig«, sagte der Geistliche, »aber so pflegen die Schuldigen zu reden.« »Hast auch du ein Vorurteil gegen mich?« fragte K. »Ich habe kein Vorurteil gegen dich«, sagte der Geistliche. »Ich danke dir«, sagte K., »alle anderen aber, die an dem Verfahren beteiligt sind, haben ein Vorurteil gegen mich. Sie flößen es auch den Unbeteiligten ein. Meine Stellung wird immer schwieriger.« »Du mißverstehst die Tatsachen«, sagte der Geistliche, »das Urteil kommt nicht mit einemmal, das Verfahren geht allmählich ins Urteil über.« »So ist es also«, sagte K. und senkte den Kopf »Was willst du nächstens in deiner Sache tun?« fragte der Geistliche. »Ich will noch Hilfe suchen«, sagte K. und hob den Kopf, um zu sehen, wie der Geistliche es beurteile. »Es gibt noch gewisse Möglichkeiten, die ich nicht ausgenützt habe.« »Du suchst zuviel fremde Hilfe«, sagte der Geistliche mißbilligend, »und besonders bei Frauen. Merkst du denn nicht, daß es nicht die wahre Hilfe ist?« »Manchmal und sogar oft könnte ich dir recht geben«, sagte K., »aber nicht immer. Die Frauen haben eine große Macht. Wenn ich einige Frauen, die ich kenne, dazu bewegen könnte, gemeinschaftlich für mich zu arbeiten, müßte ich durchdringen. Besonders bei diesem Gericht, das fast nur aus Frauenjägern besteht. Zeig dem Untersuchungsrichter eine Frau aus der Ferne, und er überrennt, um nur rechtzeitig hinzukommen, den Gerichtstisch und den Angeklagten.« Der Geistliche neigte den Kopf zur Brüstung, jetzt erst schien die Überdachung der Kanzel ihn niederzudrücken. Was für ein Unwetter mochte draußen sein? Das war kein trüber Tag mehr, das war schon tiefe Nacht. Keine Glasmalerei der großen Fenster war imstande, die dunkle Wand auch nur mit einem Schimmer zu unterbrechen. Und gerade jetzt begann der Kirchendiener, die Kerzen auf dem Hauptaltar, eine nach der anderen, auszulöschen. »Bist du mir böse?« fragte K. den Geistlichen. »Du weißt vielleicht nicht, was für einem Gericht du dienst.« Er bekam keine Antwort. »Es sind doch nur meine Erfahrungen«, sagte K. Oben blieb es noch immer still. »Ich wollte dich nicht beleidigen«, sagte K. Da schrie der Geistliche zu K. hinunter: »Siehst du denn nicht zwei Schritte weit?« Es war im Zorn geschrien, aber gleichzeitig wie von einem, der jemanden fallen sieht und, weil er selbst erschrocken ist, unvorsichtig, ohne Willen schreit.","K. stopped and looked at the floor in front of him. For the time being he was still free, he could go further and escape through one of the three small, dark wooden doors that were not far in front of him. It would mean that he hadn't understood, or that he had understood but didn't want to bother with it. But if he turned around, he was arrested, because then he had made the admission that he had understood well, that he really was the one being called and that he also wanted to follow. If the priest had called again, K. would certainly have gone away, but since everything remained silent while K. was waiting, he turned his head a little because he wanted to see what the priest was doing now. He stood calmly in the pulpit as before, but it was clear that he had noticed K.'s head turn. It would have been a childish game of hide-and-seek if K. hadn't turned around completely. He did so and was called over by the minister with a wave of his finger. Since everything could now be done openly, he ran - he also did it out of curiosity and to shorten the matter - with long, flying strides towards the pulpit. He stopped at the first pew, but the distance seemed too great to the priest. He stretched out his hand and pointed with a sharply lowered forefinger to a spot just in front of the pulpit. K. followed suit, he had to bend his head far back from this spot to see the priest. ""You're Josef K."" said the priest and raised a hand on the parapet in a vague movement. ""Yes,"" said K., he thought about how openly he used to give his name, it had been a burden to him for some time now, people he was meeting for the first time also knew his name, how nice it was to introduce oneself first and only then to be known. ""You are accused,"" the minister said, particularly quietly. ""Yes,"" said K., ""I was informed."" ""Then you're the one I'm looking for,"" said the priest. 'I'm the prison chaplain.' 'Oh,' said K. 'I had you called here,' said the priest, 'to speak to you.' 'I didn't know,' said K. 'I came here , to show an Italian the cathedral.' 'Leave the triviality behind,' said the priest. ""What are you holding in your hand? Is it a prayer book?' 'No,' answered K., 'it's an album of the city's sights.' 'Put it down,' said the priest. K. threw it away so violently that it flapped open and dragged along the floor with its crushed leaves. ""Do you know that your case is in bad shape?"" asked the priest. 'It seems to me that way too,' said K. 'I've tried my best, but so far without success. However, I haven't finished the input yet.' 'How do you envisage the end?' asked the cleric. 'I used to think it would end well,' said K., 'now I sometimes doubt it myself. I don't know how it will end. Do you know?"" ""No,"" said the priest, ""but I fear it will end badly. You are held guilty. Your trial may not get beyond a low court. At least for the time being they think your guilt has been proven."" ""But I'm not guilty,"" said K., ""it's a mistake. How can a person be guilty at all? We're all human here, one like the other."" ""That's right,"" said the priest, ""but that's how the guilty talk."" ""Do you have a prejudice against me, too?"" asked K. ""I don't have any Prejudice against you,' said the priest. 'Thank you,' said K., 'but everyone else involved in the proceedings has a prejudice against me. They infuse it into the bystanders too. My position is becoming more and more difficult."" ""You misunderstand the facts,"" said the priest, ""the verdict will not come all at once, the trial will gradually lead to the verdict."" ""So that's the way it is,"" said K., bowing his head, "" What do you intend to do next in your case?” asked the priest. ""I still want to seek help,"" said K., raising his head to see the priest's opinion. 'There are still certain avenues I haven't taken advantage of.' 'You seek too much outside help,' said the priest disapprovingly, 'and especially from women. Don't you see that it's not the real help?"" ""Sometimes and even often I could agree with you,"" said K., ""but not always. Women have great power. If I could get some women I know to work for me collectively, I would have to get through. Especially with this court, which consists almost entirely of women hunters. Show the coroner a woman from afar, and he'll run over the court table and the accused just to get there in time.' The minister inclined his head towards the parapet, only now the canopy of the pulpit seemed to weigh him down. What storm might be outside? It was no longer a dull day, it was already deep night. No stained glass in the great windows was able to break the dark wall with a glimmer. And just now the sacristan began to extinguish the candles on the main altar, one by one. ""Are you angry with me?"" K. asked the priest. ""You may not know what court you serve."" There was no answer. ""It's just my experience,"" said K. It was still quiet upstairs. ""I didn't want to offend you,"" said K. Then the priest shouted down at K., ""Can't you see two steps away?"" himself is frightened, careless, screams without will.","K. hesitated and stared at the floor. At the moment he was still free; he could walk on and leave through one of the three small dark wooden doors not far from him. That would mean he hadn’t understood or that he had indeed understood but couldn’t be bothered to respond. But if he turned around he was caught, for then he would have confessed that he understood quite well, that he really was the person named, and that he was prepared to obey. If the priest had called out again, K. would surely have walked out, but since all remained still, however long K. waited, he finally turned his head a bit, for he wanted to see what the priest was doing now. He was standing quietly in the pulpit as before, but he had clearly noticed K.’s head turn. It would have been a childish game of hide-and-seek for K. not to turn around completely now. He did so and the priest beckoned him to approach. Now that everything could be done openly, he walked with long, rapid strides toward the pulpit—out of curiosity as well, and to cut this business short. He paused by the first pews, but that still seemed too great a distance to the priest, who stretched out his hand and pointed sharply downward toward a spot just in front of the pulpit. K. obeyed this gesture as well; from this position he had to lean his head far back in order to see the priest. “You’re Josef K.,” said the priest, and lifted one hand from the balustrade in a vague gesture. “Yes,” said K.; he recalled how openly he had always said his name ; for some time now it had been a burden, and people he met for the first time already knew his name; how good it felt to introduce oneself first and only then be known. “You stand accused,” said the priest in a very low voice. “Yes,” said K. “I’ve been notified about it.” “Then you’re the one I’m seeking,” said the priest. “I’m the prison chaplain.” “I see,” said K. “I had you brought here,” said the priest, “so I could speak with you.” “I didn’t know that,” said K. “I came here to show the cathedral to an Italian.” “Forget such irrelevancies,” said the priest. “ What’s that in your hand? Is it a prayer book?” “No,” replied K., “it’s an album of city sights.” “Put it aside,” said the priest. K. threw it down so violently that it flew open and skidded some distance across the floor, its pages crushed. “Do you realize your trial is going badly?” asked the priest. “It seems that way to me too,” said K. “I’ve tried as hard as I can, but without any success so far. Of course I haven’t completed my petition yet.” “How do you imagine it will end,” asked the priest. “At first I thought it would surely end well,” said K., “now sometimes I even have doubts myself. I don’t know how it will end. Do you?” “No,” said the priest, “but I fear it will end badly. They think you’re guilty. Your trial may never move beyond the lower courts. At least for the moment, your guilt is assumed proved.” “But I’m not guilty,” said K. “It’s a mistake. How can any person in general be guilty? We’re all human after all, each and every one of us.” “That’s right,” said the priest, “but that’s how guilty people always talk.” “Are you prejudiced against me too?” asked K. “I’m not prejudiced against you,” said the priest. “Thank you,” said K. “But everyone else involved with the proceedings is prejudiced against me. And they instill it in those who aren’t involved. My position is becoming increasingly difficult.” “You misunderstand the facts of the matter,” said the priest. “The judgment isn’t simply delivered at some point; the proceedings gradually merge into the judgment.” “ So that’s how it is,” said K. and bowed his head. “What will you do next in your case?” asked the priest. “I intend to seek additional help,” said K., and raised his head to see how the priest judged this. “There are still certain possibilities I haven’t taken advantage of.” “You seek too much outside help,” the priest said disapprovingly, “particularly from women. Haven’t you noticed that it isn’t true help.” “Sometimes, often even, I’d have to say you’re right,” said K., “but not always. Women have great power. If I could get a few of the women I know to join forces and work for me, I could surely make it through. Particularly with this court, which consists almost entirely of skirt chasers. Show the examining magistrate a woman, even at a distance, and he’ll knock over the courtroom table and the defendant to get to her first.” The priest lowered his head to the balustrade; only now did the pulpit’s roof seem to weigh down upon him. What sort of a storm could there be outside? It was no longer a dull day, it was already deep night. No pane of stained glass within the great window emitted even a shimmer of light to interrupt the wall’s darkness. And this was the moment the sexton chose to start extinguishing the candles on the main altar one by one. “Are you angry with me?” K. asked the priest. “Perhaps you don’t know the sort of court you serve.” He received no reply. “ Of course that’s just my own personal experience,” said K. Still only silence from above. “I didn’t mean to insult you,” said K. Then the priest screamed down at K.: “ Can’t you see two steps in front of you?” It was a cry of rage, but at the same time it was the cry of someone who, seeing a man falling, shouts out in shock, involuntarily, without thinking.","K. paused and stared at the ground before him. For the moment he was still free, he could continue on his way and vanish through one of the small, dark, wooden doors that faced him at no great distance. It would simply indicate that he had not understood the call, or that he had understood it and did not care. But if he were to turn round he would be caught, for that would amount to an admission that he had understood it very well, that he was really the person addressed, and that he was ready to obey. Had the priest called his name a second time K. would certainly have gone on, but as everything remained silent, though he stood waiting a long time, he could not help turning his head a little just to see what the priest was doing. The priest was standing calmly in the pulpit as before, yet it was obvious that he had observed K.'s turn of the head. It would have been like a childish game of hide-and-seek if K. had not turned right round to face him. He did so, and the priest beckoned him to come nearer. Since there was now no need for evasion, K. hurried back -- he was both curious and eager to shorten the interview -- with long flying strides toward the pulpit. At the first rows of seats he halted, but the priest seemed to think the distance still too great; he stretched out an arm and pointed with sharply bent fore-finger to a spot immediately before the pulpit. K. followed this direction too; when he stood on the spot indicated he had to bend his head far back to see the priest at all. ""You are Joseph K.,"" said the priest, lifting one hand from the balustrade in a vague gesture. "" Yes,"" said K., thinking how frankly he used to give his name and what a burden it had recently become to him; nowadays people he had never seen before seemed to know his name. How pleasant it was to have to introduce oneself before being recognized! ""You are an accused man,"" said the priest in a very low voice. "" Yes,"" said K., ""so I have been informed."" ""Then you are the man I seek,"" said the priest. ""I am the prison chaplain."" ""Indeed,"" said K. ""I had you summoned here,"" said the priest, ""to have a talk with you."" ""I didn't know that,"" said K. ""I came here to show an Italian round the Cathedral."" ""That is beside the point,"" said the priest. ""What is that in your hand? Is it a prayer book?"" ""No,"" replied K., ""it is an album of sights worth seeing in the town."" ""Lay it down,"" said the priest. K. threw it away so violently that it flew open and slid some way along the floor with disheveled leaves. "" Do you know that your case is going badly?"" asked the priest. ""I have that idea myself,"" said K. ""I've done what I could, but without any success so far. Of course, my petition isn't finished yet. "" ""How do you think it will end?"" asked the priest. "" At first I thought it must turn out well,"" said K., ""but now I frequently have my doubts. I don't know how it will end. Do you?"" ""No,"" said the priest, ""but I fear it will end badly. You are held to be guilty. Your case will perhaps never get beyond a lower Court. Your guilt is supposed, for the present, at least, to have been proved."" ""But I am not guilty,"" said K.; ""it's a mistake. And, if it comes to that, how can any man be called guilty? We are all simply men here, one as much as the other."" ""That is true,"" said the priest, ""but that's how all guilty men talk."" ""Are you prejudiced against me too?"" asked K. ""I have no prejudices against you,"" said the priest. "" Thank you,"" said K.; ""but all the others who are concerned in these proceedings are prejudiced against me. They are influencing outsiders too. My position is becoming more and more difficult."" ""You are misinterpreting the facts of the case,"" said the priest. ""The verdict is not suddenly arrived at, the proceedings only gradually merge into the verdict."" ""So that's how it is,"" said K., letting his head sink. ""What is the next step you propose to take in the matter?"" asked the priest. ""I'm going to get more help,"" said K., looking up again to see how the priest took his statement. ""There are several possibilities I haven't explored yet."" ""You cast about too much for outside help,"" said the priest disapprovingly, ""especially from women. Don't you see that it isn't the right kind of help?"" ""In some cases, even in many I could agree with you,"" said K., ""but not always. Women have great influence. If I could move some women I know to join forces in working for me, I couldn't help winning through. Especially before this Court, which consists almost entirely of petticoat-hunters. Let the Examining Magistrate see a woman in the distance and he knocks down his desk and the defendant in his eagerness to get at her. "" The priest leaned over the balustrade, apparently feeling for the first time the oppressiveness of the canopy above his head. What fearful weather there must be outside! There was no longer even a murky daylight; black night had set in. All the stained glass in the great window could not illumine the darkness of the wall with one solitary glimmer of light. And at this very moment the verger began to put out the candles on the high altar, one after another. ""Are you angry with me?"" asked K. of the priest. ""It may be that you don't know the nature of the Court you are serving."" He got no answer. ""These are only my personal experiences,"" said K. There was still no answer from above. ""I wasn't trying to insult you,"" said K. And at that the priest shrieked from the pulpit: ""Can't you see one pace before you? "" It was an angry cry, bat at the same time sounded like the unwary shriek of one who sees another fall and is startled out of his senses.","K. stood still and looked down at the floor. In theory he was still free, he could have carried on walking, through one of three dark little wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there. It would simply mean he had not understood, or that he had understood but chose not to pay attention to it. But if he once turned round he would be trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understood perfectly well, that he really was the Josef K. the priest had called to and that he was willing to follow. If the priest had called out again K. would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything was silent as K. also waited, he turned his head slightly as he wanted to see what the priest was doing now. He was merely standing in the pulpit as before, but it was obvious that he had seen K. turn his head. If K. did not now turn round completely it would have been like a child playing hide and seek. He did so, and the priest beckoned him with his finger. As everything could now be done openly he ran— because of curiosity and the wish to get it over with—with long flying leaps towards the pulpit. At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest he still seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply down with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit. And K. did as he was told, standing in that place he had to bend his head a long way back just to see the priest. “You are Josef K.,” said the priest, and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whose meaning was unclear. “Yes,” said K., he considered how freely he had always given his name in the past, for some time now it had been a burden to him, now there were people who knew his name whom he had never seen before , it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and only then for people to know who you were. “You have been accused,” said the priest, especially gently. “Yes,” said K., “so I have been informed.” “Then you are the one I am looking for,” said the priest. “I am the prison chaplain.” “I see,” said K. “I had you summoned here,” said the priest, “because I wanted to speak to you.” “I knew nothing of that,” said K. “I came here to show the cathedral to a gentleman from Italy.” “That is beside the point,” said the priest. “What are you holding in your hand? Is it a prayer book?” “No,” answered K., “it's an album of the city's tourist sights.” “Put it down,” said the priest. K. threw it away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across the floor, tearing its pages. “Do you know your case is going badly?” asked the priest. “That's how it seems to me too,” said K. “I've expended a lot of effort on it, but so far with no result. Although I do still have some documents to submit.” “How do you imagine it will end?” asked the priest. “At first I thought it was bound to end well,” said K., “but now I have my doubts about it. I don't know how it will end. Do you know?” “I don't,” said the priest, “but I fear it will end badly. You are considered guilty. Your case will probably not even go beyond a minor court. Provisionally at least, your guilt is seen as proven.” “But I'm not guilty,” said K., “there's been a mistake. How is it even possible for someone to be guilty. We're all human beings here, one like the other. “That is true,” said the priest, “but that is how the guilty speak.” “Do you presume I'm guilty too?” asked K. “I make no presumptions about you,” said the priest. “I thank you for that,” said K. “but everyone else involved in these proceedings has something against me and presumes I'm guilty. They even influence those who aren't involved. My position gets harder all the time.” “You don't understand the facts,” said the priest, “the verdict does not come suddenly, proceedings continue until a verdict is reached gradually.” “I see,” said K., lowering his head. “What do you intend to do about your case next?” asked the priest. “I still need to find help,” said K., raising his head to see what the priest thought of this. “There are still certain possibilities I haven't yet made use of.” “You look for too much help from people you don't know,” said the priest disapprovingly, “and especially from women. Can you really not see that's not the help you need?” “Sometimes, in fact quite often, I could believe you're right,” said K., “but not always. Women have a lot of power. If I could persuade some of the women I know to work together with me then I would be certain to succeed. Especially in a court like this that seems to consist of nothing but woman-chasers. Show the examining judge a woman in the distance and he'll run right over the desk, and the accused, just to get to her as soon as he can.” The priest lowered his head down to the balustrade, only now did the roof over the pulpit seem to press him down. What sort of dreadful weather could it be outside? It was no longer just a dull day, it was deepest night. None of the stained glass in the main window shed even a flicker of light on the darkness of the walls. And this was the moment when the man in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar, one by one. “Are you cross with me?” asked K. “Maybe you don't know what sort of court it is you serve.” He received no answer. “Well, it's just my own experience,” said K. Above him there was still silence. “I didn't mean to insult you,” said K. At that, the priest screamed down at K.: “Can you not see two steps in front of you?” He shouted in anger, but it was also the scream of one who sees another fall and, shocked and without thinking, screams against his own will.","K. stood still and looked down at the floor.

If I could persuade some of the women I know to work together with me then I would be certain to succeed. Especially in a court like this that seems to consist of nothing but woman-chasers. Show the examining judge a woman in the distance and he'll run right over the desk, and the accused, just to get to her as soon as he can. "" The priest lowered his head down to the balustrade, only now did the roof over the pulpit seem to press him down. What sort of dreadful weather could it be outside? It was no longer just a dull day, it was deepest night. None of the stained glass in the main window shed even a flicker of light on the darkness of the walls. And this was the moment when the man in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar, one by one. ""Are you cross with me? "" asked K. "" Maybe you don't know what sort of court it is you serve."" He received no answer. "" Well, it's just my own experience,"" said K. Above him there was still silence. ""I didn't mean to insult you,"" said K. At that, the priest screamed down at K.: ""Can you not see two steps in front of you?"" He shouted in anger, but it was also the scream of one who sees another fall and, shocked and without thinking, screams against his own will."
Fünftes Kapitel,Fifth Chapter,THE FLOGGER,Chapter 5,Chapter Five.,Chapter Five
"»Natürlich«, sagte die Frau, »mein Mann ist ja Gerichtsdiener.« Erst jetzt merkte K., daß das Zimmer, in dem letzthin nur ein Waschbottich gestanden war, jetzt ein völlig eingerichtetes Wohnzimmer bildete. Die Frau bemerkte sein Staunen und sagte: »Ja, wir haben hier freie Wohnung, müssen aber an Sitzungstagen das Zimmer ausräumen. Die Stellung meines Mannes hat manche Nachteile.« »Ich staune nicht so sehr über das Zimmer«, sagte K. und blickte sie böse an, »als vielmehr darüber, daß Sie verheiratet sind.« »Spielen Sie vielleicht auf den Vorfall in der letzten Sitzung an, durch den ich Ihre Rede störte?« fragte die Frau. »Natürlich«, sagte K., »heute ist es ja schon vorüber und fast vergessen, aber damals hat es mich geradezu wütend gemacht. Und nun sagen Sie selbst, daß Sie eine verheiratete Frau sind.« »Es war nicht zu Ihrem Nachteil, daß ihre Rede abgebrochen wurde. Man hat nachher noch sehr ungünstig über sie geurteilt.«","""Of course,"" said the woman, ""my husband is a court clerk."" It was only now that K. noticed that the room that had previously only had a washtub was now a fully furnished living room. The woman noticed his astonishment and said: ""Yes, we have a vacant apartment here, but we have to clear the room on meeting days. My husband's position has a number of disadvantages."" ""I'm not so surprised about the room,"" said K., glaring at her, ""as much as about the fact that you're married."" ""Perhaps you're playing on what happened in the last one meeting during which I interrupted your speech?” asked the woman. 'Of course,' said K., 'it's over now and almost forgotten, but at the time it made me downright angry. And now you say yourself that you are a married woman.' 'It was not to your detriment that her speech was cut short. Afterwards they were judged very unfavorably.”","“Of course,” said the woman, “after all, my husband is a court usher.” Only then did K. see that the room, which had contained only a washtub last time, was now a fully furnished living room. The woman noticed his astonishment and said: “Yes, we live here rent free, but we have to move our furniture out on days when the court is in session. My husband’s job has a few disadvantages.” “It’s not so much the room that astonishes me,” said K., giving her an angry look, “as the fact that you’re married.” “Are you referring perhaps to the incident last session, when I interrupted your speech?” asked the woman. “Of course,” said K., “today that’s all over and practically forgotten, but it really angered me at the time. And now you yourself say you’re a married woman.” “It wasn’t to your disadvantage to have your speech interrupted. You were judged quite unfavorably afterwards.”","Of course,"" replied the woman, ""my husband is an usher, you see. "" Only then did K. notice that the anteroom, which had contained nothing but a washtub last Sunday, now formed a fully furnished living room. The woman remarked his surprise and said: ""Yes, we have free house-room here, but we must clear the room on the days when the Court is sitting. My husband's post has many disadvantages."" ""I'm not so much surprised at the room,"" said K., looking at her severely, ""as at the fact that you're married."" ""Perhaps you're hinting at what happened during the last sitting, when I caused a disturbance while you were speaking,"" said the woman. ""Of course I am,"" said K. ""It's an old story by this time, and almost forgotten, but at the moment it made me quite furious. And now you say yourself that you're a married woman."" ""It didn't do you any harm to have your speech interrupted; what you said made a bad enough impression, to judge from the discussion afterwards.""","“Of course I know him,” said the woman, “my husband is the court usher.” It was only now that K. noticed that the room, which before had held nothing but a wash-tub, had been fitted out as a living room. The woman saw how surprised he was and said, “Yes, we're allowed to live here as we like, only we have to clear the room out when the court's in session. There's lots of disadvantages to my husband's job.” “It's not so much the room that surprises me,” said K., looking at her crossly, “it's your being married that shocks me.” “Are you thinking about what happened last time the court was in session, when I disturbed what you were saying?” asked the woman. “Of course,” said K., “it's in the past now and I've nearly forgotten about it, but at the time it made me furious. And now you tell me yourself that you are a married woman.” “It wasn't any disadvantage for you to have your speech interrupted. The way they talked about you after you'd gone was really bad.”","Of course I know him,"" said the woman, ""my husband is the court usher. "" It was only now that K. noticed that the room, which before had held nothing but a wash-tub, had been fitted out as a living room.

""It wasn't any disadvantage for you to have your speech interrupted. The way they talked about you after you'd gone was really bad."""
"»Ich bin gleich zu Ende«, sagte K. und schlug, da keine Glocke vorhanden war, mit der Faust auf den Tisch; im Schrecken darüber fuhren die Köpfe des Untersuchungsrichters und seines Ratgebers augenblicklich auseinander: »Mir steht die ganze Sache fern, ich beurteile sie daher ruhig, und Sie können, vorausgesetzt, daß Ihnen an diesem angeblichen Gericht etwas gelegen ist, großen Vorteil davon haben, wenn Sie mir zuhören. Ihre gegenseitigen Besprechungen dessen, was ich vorbringe, bitte ich Sie für späterhin zu verschieben, denn ich habe keine Zeit und werde bald weggehen.«","""I'll be finished soon,"" said K. and, since there was no bell, he banged his fist on the table; in horror the heads of the examining magistrate and his adviser parted at once: ""I have no knowledge of the whole matter, so I judge it calmly, and you can, provided that you care about this alleged court, take great advantage if you listen to me I beg you to defer your mutual reviews of what I am proposing until later, for I have no time and shall be leaving soon.”","“I’m almost finished,” said K. striking his fist on the table, since no bell was available, at which the heads of the examining magistrate and his advisor immediately drew apart, startled: “I’m completely detached from this whole affair, so I can judge it calmly, and it will be to your distinct advantage to pay attention, always assuming you care about this so-called court. I suggest that you postpone your mutual discussion of what I’m saying until later, because I don’t have much time, and will be leaving soon.”","""I have nearly finished,"" said K., striking the table with his fist, since there was no bell. At the shock of the impact the beads of the Examining Magistrate and his adviser started away from each other for a moment. ""I am quite detached from this affair, I can therefore judge it calmly, and you, that is to say if you take this alleged court of justice at all seriously, will find it to your great advantage to listen to me. But I beg you to postpone until later any comments you may wish to exchange on what I have to say, for I am pressed for time and must leave very soon.""","“I have nearly finished what I have to say,” said K., and as there was no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each other. “ Non of this concerns me, and I am therefore able to make a calm assessment of it, and, assuming that this so-called court is of any real importance, it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what I have to say. If you want to discuss what I say, please don't bother to write it down until later on, I don't have any time to waste and I'll soon be leaving.”","""I have nearly finished what I have to say,"" said K., and as there was no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each other.

"K. dachte daran, ob er sich jetzt nicht eiligst entfernen sollte, wenn er es jetzt nicht tat, war keine Aussicht, daß er es während der Predigt tun könnte, er mußte dann bleiben, solange sie dauerte, im Büro verlor er soviel Zeit, auf den Italiener zu warten, war er längst nicht mehr verpflichtet, er sah auf seine Uhr, es war elf. Aber konnte denn wirklich gepredigt werden? Konnte K. allein die Gemeinde darstellen? Wie, wenn er ein Fremder gewesen wäre, der nur dir Kirche besichtigen wollte? Im Grunde war er auch nichts anderes. Es war unsinnig daran zu denken, daß gepredigt werden sollte, jetzt um elf Uhr, an einem Werktag, bei gräßlichstem Wetter. Der Geistliche – ein Geistlicher war es zweifellos, ein junger Mann mit glattem, dunklem Gesicht – ging offenbar nur hinauf, um die Lampe zu löschen, die irrtümlich angezündet worden war.","K. thought about whether he shouldn't hurry away now, if he didn't do it now there was no chance that he could do it during the sermon, he would then have to stay while it lasted, he wasted so much time in the office he was no longer obliged to wait for the Italian, he looked at his watch, it was eleven. But could it really be preached? Could K. represent the community alone? What if he was a stranger who just wanted to see the church? Basically he was nothing else. It was nonsensical to think that there should be a sermon now at eleven o'clock, on a weekday, in the most dreadful weather. The cleric - a cleric it was undoubtedly, a young man with a smooth dark face - apparently only went upstairs to extinguish the lamp which had been lit by mistake.","K. considered leaving as quickly as possible; if he didn’t go now there was no chance of doing so during the sermon, he would have to remain for as long as it lasted, losing a great deal of time at the office, and he was certainly no longer obliged to wait for the Italian; he looked at his watch: it was eleven. But could there really be a sermon? Could K. alone represent the congregation? What if he were merely a stranger who wanted to see the church? Basically that’s all he was. It was senseless to believe there was going to be a sermon, now, at eleven o’clock, on a workday, in the dreariest of weather. The priest—he was clearly a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face—was obviously climbing up simply to extinguish the lamp that had been lighted in error.","K. wondered whether this was not the time to remove himself quickly; if he did not go now he would have no chance of doing so during the sermon, he would have to stay as long as it lasted, he was already behindhand in the office and was no longer obliged to wait for the Italian; he looked at his watch, it was eleven o'clock. But was there really going to be a sermon? Could K. represent the congregation all by himself? What if he had been a stranger merely visiting the church? That was more or less his position. It was absurd to think that a sermon was going to be preached at eleven in the morning on a weekday, in such dreadful weather. The priest -- he was beyond doubt a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face -- was obviously mounting the pulpit simply to turn out the lamp, which had been lit by mistake.","K. now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible, if he did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during the sermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted, he had lost so much time when he should have been in his office, there had long been no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer, he looked at his watch, it was eleven. But could there really be a sermon given? Could K. constitute the entire congregation? How could he when he was just a stranger who wanted to look at the church? That, basically, was all he was. The idea of a sermon, now, at eleven o'clock, on a workday, in hideous weather, was nonsense. The priest—there was no doubt that he was a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face—was clearly going up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by mistake.","K. now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible, if he did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during the sermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted, he had lost so much time when he should have been in his office, there had long been no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer, he looked at his watch, it was eleven.

"Aus Neugierde eilte K. noch zur Tür, er wollte sehen, wohin die Frau getragen wurde, der Student würde sie doch nicht etwa über die Straßen auf dem Arm tragen. Es zeigte sich, daß der Weg viel kürzer war. Gleich gegenüber der Wohnung führte eine schmale hölzerne Treppe wahrscheinlich zum Dachboden, sie machte eine Wendung, so daß man ihr Ende nicht sah. Über diese Treppe trug der Student die Frau hinauf, schon sehr langsam und stöhnend, denn er war durch das bisherige Laufen geschwächt. Die Frau grüßte mit der Hand zu K. hinunter und suchte durch Auf- und Abziehen der Schultern zu zeigen, daß sie an der Entführung unschuldig sei, viel Bedauern lag aber in dieser Bewegung nicht. K. sah sie ausdruckslos wie eine Fremde an, er wollte weder verraten, daß er enttäuscht war, noch auch, daß er die Enttäuschung leicht überwinden könne.","Out of curiosity, K. hurried to the door, he wanted to see where the woman was being carried, the student wouldn't be carrying her across the street in his arms. It turned out that the way was much shorter. Directly opposite the apartment, a narrow wooden staircase probably led to the attic, it turned so that you couldn't see the end. The student carried the woman up these stairs, very slowly and groaning, because he was weak from walking. The woman waved her hand down at K. and tried to show by shrugging her shoulders that she was innocent of the kidnapping, but there wasn't much regret in this gesture. K. looked at her blankly, like a stranger, he didn't want to reveal that he was disappointed, nor that he could easily overcome his disappointment.","Out of curiosity, K. hurried to the door, wanting to see where the woman was being taken; the student surely wouldn’t carry her through the streets in his arms. It turned out the path was much shorter. Directly across from the apartment door a narrow flight of wooden stairs led upward, probably to an attic area; they made a turn, so you couldn’t see where they ended. The student was carrying the woman up these stairs, very slowly now, and groaning, for he was weakened by his previous efforts. The woman waved down at K., and tried to show by a shrug of her shoulders that the abduction wasn’t her fault, but there wasn’t a great deal of regret in the gesture. K. looked at her without expression, like a stranger, wishing to show neither his disappointment, nor that he could easily overcome it.","Out of curiosity K. hurried to the door, he wanted to see where the woman was being carried off to, for the student could scarcely bear her in his arms across the street. But the journey was much shorter than that. Immediately opposite the door a flight of narrow wooden stairs led, as it seemed, to a garret, it had a turning so that one could not see the other end. The student was now carrying the woman up this stairway, very slowly, puffing and groaning, for he was beginning to be exhausted. The woman waved her hand to K. as he stood below, and shrugged her shoulders to suggest that she was not to blame for this abduction, but very little regret could be read into that dumb show. K. looked at her expressionlessly, as if she were a stranger, he was resolved not to betray to her either that he was disappointed or even that he could easily get over any disappointment he felt.","K. was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he hurried over to the door, the student was not likely to carry her through the streets on his arm. It turned out that the journey was far shorter. Directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden steps which probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went so that it was not possible to see where they ended. The student carried the woman up these steps, and after the exertions of running with her he was soon groaning and moving very slowly. The woman waved down at K. and by raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was an innocent party in this abduction, although the gesture did not show a lot of regret. K. watched her without expression like a stranger, he wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily get over his disappointment.","K. was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he hurried over to the door, the student was not likely to carry her through the streets on his arm.

"»Es ist gar nichts Dummes, was Sie gesagt haben, Frau Grubach, wenigstens bin auch ich zum Teil Ihrer Meinung, nur urteile ich über das Ganze noch schärfer als Sie und halte es einfach nicht einmal für etwas Gelehrtes, sondern überhaupt für nichts. Ich wurde überrumpelt, das war es. Wäre ich gleich nach dem Erwachen, ohne mich durch das Ausbleiben der Anna beirren zu lassen, aufgestanden und ohne Rücksicht auf irgend jemand, der mir in den Weg getreten wäre, zu Ihnen gegangen, hätte ich diesmal ausnahmsweise etwa in der Küche gefrühstückt, hätte mir von Ihnen die Kleidungsstücke aus meinem Zimmer bringen lassen, kurz, hätte ich vernünftig gehandelt, so wäre nichts weiter geschehen, es wäre alles, was werden wollte, erstickt worden. Man ist aber so wenig vorbereitet. In der Bank zum Beispiel bin ich vorbereitet, dort könnte mir etwas Derartiges unmöglich geschehen, ich habe dort einen eigenen Diener, das allgemeine Telephon und das Bürotelephon stehen vor mir auf dem Tisch, immerfort kommen Leute, Parteien und Beamte, außerdem aber und vor allem bin ich dort immerfort im Zusammenhang der Arbeit, daher geistesgegenwärtig, es würde mir geradezu ein Vergnügen machen, dort einer solchen Sache gegenübergestellt zu werden.

"»Ich glaube«, sagte der Mann, der übrigens elegant gekleidet war und besonders durch eine graue Weste auffiel, die in zwei langen, scharfgeschnittenen Spitzen endigte, »das Unwohlsein des Herrn geht auf die Atmosphäre hier zurück, es wird daher am besten und auch ihm am liebsten sein, wenn wir ihn nicht erst ins Krankenzimmer, sondern überhaupt aus den Kanzleien hinausführen.« »Das ist es«, rief K. und fuhr vor lauter Freude fast noch in die Rede des Mannes hinein, »mir wird gewiß sofort besser werden, ich bin auch gar nicht so schwach, nur ein wenig Unterstützung unter den Achseln brauche ich, ich werde Ihnen nicht viel Mühe machen, es ist ja auch kein langer Weg, führen Sie mich nur zur Tür, ich setze mich dann noch ein wenig auf die Stufen und werde gleich erholt sein, ich leide nämlich gar nicht unter solchen Anfällen, es kommt mir selbst überraschend. Ich bin doch auch Beamter und an Büroluft gewöhnt, aber hier scheint es doch zu arg, Sie sagen es selbst. Wollen Sie also die Freundlichkeit haben, mich ein wenig zu führen, ich habe nämlich Schwindel, und es wird mir schlecht wenn ich allein aufstehe.« Und er hob die Schultern, um es den beiden zu erleichtern, ihm unter die Arme zu greifen.","""I think,"" said the man, who was elegantly dressed, and particularly conspicuous by a gray waistcoat ending in two long, sharp-edged points, ""the gentleman's malaise is due to the atmosphere here, so it's going to be best and too what he likes best if we take him out of the office rather than into the sickroom first."" ""That's it,"" cried K., almost bursting into the man's speech out of sheer joy, ""I'm sure I'll feel better immediately I'm not that weak either, I just need a little support under my armpits, I won't bother you too much, it's not a long way either, just lead me to the door and I'll sit down for a bit up the steps and will be recovered in a moment, because I don't suffer from such attacks at all, it comes as a surprise to me. I'm also a civil servant and used to the office atmosphere, but it seems too bad here, you say so yourself. Would you be so kind as to guide me a little, because I'm dizzy and I get sick when I get up on my own .' And he shrugged his shoulders to make it easier for them both to help him.","“I believe,” said the man, who was elegantly dressed, with a striking gray waistcoat that ended in two sharply tailored points, “the gentleman’s illness can be traced to the air in here, so it would be best, and please him most, if we simply skipped the infirmary and led him out of the law offices.” “That’s it,” K. cried out, so overjoyed he barely let the man finish his sentence, “I’m sure I’ll feel better soon, I’m not that weak , I just need a little support under the arms, I won’t be much trouble, it’s not very far, just take me to the door, I’ll sit on the steps a bit and be fine soon, I never have attacks like this, it surprised me too. After all, I’m an official myself and I’m used to office air, but it does seem really bad here, you say so yourself. Would you be so kind as to help me a little, I’m dizzy, and I feel sick when I stand on my own.” And he lifted his shoulders to make it easier for the others to grab him under the arms.","""I fancy,"" said the man, who was stylishly dressed and was wearing a conspicuously smart gray waistcoat ending in two long sharp points, ""that the gentleman's faintness is due to the atmosphere here, and the best thing to do -- and what he would like best -- is not to take him to the sick-room at all, but out of these offices altogether."" ""That's it!"" cried K., so delighted that he almost broke into the man's words, ""I should feel better at once, I'm sure of it, I'm not so terribly weak either, I only need a little support under my arms, I won't give you much trouble, it isn't very far after all, just take me to the door, then I'll sit for a little on the stairs and recover in no time, for I don't usually suffer from these attacks, I was surprised myself by this one.

And lie lifted his shoulders to make it easier for the two of them to take him under the arms.","“I think,” said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whose appearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had two long, sharply tailored points, “the gentleman is feeling unwell because of the atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he would most prefer, would be not to take him to the sick room but get him out of the offices altogether.” “That's right,” exclaimed K., with such joy that he nearly interrupted what the man was saying, “I'm sure that'll make me feel better straight away, I'm really not that weak , all I need is a little support under my arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it's not such a long way anyway , lead me to the door and then I'll sit on the stairs for a while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks like this at all, I'm surprised at it myself.

"»Lieber Onkel«, sagte K., »die Aufregung ist so unnütz, sie ist es auf deiner Seite und wäre es auch auf meiner. Mit Aufregung gewinnt man die Prozesse nicht, laß auch meine praktischen Erfahrungen ein wenig gelten, so wie ich deine, selbst wenn sie mich überraschen, immer und auch jetzt sehr achte. Da du sagst, daß auch die Familie durch den Prozeß in Mitleidenschaft gezogen würde – was ich für meinen Teil durchaus nicht begreifen kann, das ist aber Nebensache –, so will ich dir gerne in allem folgen. Nur den Landaufenthalt halte ich selbst in deinem Sinn nicht für vorteilhaft, denn das würde Flucht und Schuldbewußtsein bedeuten. Überdies bin ich hier zwar mehr verfolgt, kann aber auch selbst die Sache mehr betreiben.« »Richtig«, sagte der Onkel in einem Ton, als kämen sie jetzt endlich einander näher, »ich machte den Vorschlag nur, weil ich, wenn du hier bliebst, die Sache von deiner Gleichgültigkeit gefährdet sah und es für besser hielt, wenn ich statt deiner für dich arbeitete. Willst du es aber mit aller Kraft selbst betreiben, so ist es natürlich weit besser.« »Darin wären wir also einig«, sagte K. »Und hast du jetzt einen Vorschlag dafür, was ich zunächst machen soll?« »Ich muß mir natürlich die Sache noch überlegen«, sagte der Onkel, »du mußt bedenken, daß ich jetzt schon zwanzig Jahre fast ununterbrochen auf dem Lande bin, dabei läßt der Spürsinn in diesen Richtungen nach. Verschiedene wichtige Verbindungen mit Persönlichkeiten, die sich hier vielleicht besser auskennen, haben sich von selbst gelockert. Ich bin auf dem Land ein wenig verlassen, das weißt du ja. Selbst merkt man es eigentlich erst bei solchen Gelegenheiten. Zum Teil kam mir deine Sache auch unerwartet, wenn ich auch merkwürdigerweise nach Ernas Brief schon etwas Derartiges ahnte und es heute bei deinem Anblick fast mit Bestimmtheit wußte. Aber das ist gleichgültig, das Wichtigste ist jetzt, keine Zeit zu verlieren.« Schon während seiner Rede hatte er, auf den Fußspitzen stehend, einem Automobil gewinkt und zog jetzt, während er gleichzeitig dem Wagenlenker eine Adresse zurief, K. hinter sich in den Wagen. »Wir fahren jetzt zum Advokaten Huld«, sagte er, »er war mein Schulkollege. Du kennst den Namen gewiß auch? Nicht? Das ist aber merkwürdig. Er hat doch als Verteidiger und Armenadvokat einen bedeutenden Ruf. Ich aber habe besonders zu ihm als Menschen großes Vertrauen.« »Mir ist alles recht, was du unternimmst«, sagte K., obwohl ihm die eilige und dringliche Art, mit der der Onkel die Angelegenheit behandelte, Unbehagen verursachte. Es war nicht sehr erfreulich, als Angeklagter zu einem Armenadvokaten zu fahren. »Ich wußte nicht«, sagte er, »daß man in einer solchen Sache auch einen Advokaten zuziehen könne.« »Aber natürlich«, sagte der Onkel, »das ist ja selbstverständlich. Warum denn nicht? Und nun erzähle mir, damit ich über die Sache genau unterrichtet bin, alles, was bisher geschehen ist.« K. begann sofort zu erzählen, ohne irgend etwas zu verschweigen, seine vollständige Offenheit war der einzige Protest, den er sich gegen des Onkels Ansicht, der Prozeß sei eine große Schande, erlauben konnte. Fräulein Bürstners Namen erwähnte er nur einmal und flüchtig, aber das beeinträchtigte nicht die Offenheit, denn Fräulein Bürstner stand mit dem Prozeß in keiner Verbindung. Während er erzählte, sah er aus dem Fenster und beobachtete, wie sie sich gerade jener Vorstadt näherten, in der die Gerichtskanzleien waren, er machte den Onkel darauf aufmerksam, der aber das Zusammentreffen nicht besonders auffallend fand. Der Wagen hielt vor einem dunklen Haus. Der Onkel läutete gleich im Parterre bei der ersten Tür; während sie warteten, fletschte er lächelnd seine großen Zähne und flüsterte: »Acht Uhr, eine ungewöhnliche Zeit für Parteienbesuche. Huld nimmt es mir aber nicht übel.« Im Guckfenster der Tür erschienen zwei große, schwarze Augen, sahen ein Weilchen die zwei Gäste an und verschwanden; die Tür öffnete sich aber nicht. Der Onkel und K. bestätigten einander gegenseitig die Tatsache, die zwei Augen gesehen zu haben. »Ein neues Stubenmädchen, das sich vor Fremden fürchtet«, sagte der Onkel und klopfte nochmals. Wieder erschienen die Augen, man konnte sie jetzt fast für traurig halten, vielleicht war das aber auch nur eine Täuschung, hervorgerufen durch die offene Gasflamme, die nahe über den Köpfen stark zischend brannte, aber wenig Licht gab. »Öffnen Sie«, rief der Onkel und hieb mit der Faust gegen die Tür, »es sind Freunde des Herrn Advokaten!« »Der Herr Advokat ist krank«, flüsterte es hinter ihnen. In einer Tür am andern Ende des kleinen Ganges stand ein Herr im Schlafrock und machte mit äußerst leiser Stimme diese Mitteilung. Der Onkel, der schon wegen des langen Wartens wütend war, wandte sich mit einem Ruck um, rief: »Krank? Sie sagen, er ist krank?« und ging fast drohend, als sei der Herr die Krankheit, auf ihn zu. »Man hat schon geöffnet«, sagte der Herr, zeigte auf die Tür des Advokaten, raffte seinen Schlafrock zusammen und verschwand. Die Tür war wirklich geöffnet worden, ein junges Mädchen – K. erkannte die dunklen, ein wenig hervorgewälzten Augen wieder – stand in langer, weißer Schürze im Vorzimmer und hielt eine Kerze in der Hand. »Nächstens öffnen Sie früher!« sagte der Onkel statt einer Begrüßung, während das Mädchen einen kleinen Knicks machte. »Komm, Josef«, sagte er dann zu K., der sich langsam an dem Mädchen vorüberschob. »Der Herr Advokat ist krank«, sagte das Mädchen, da der Onkel, ohne sich aufzuhalten, auf eine Tür zueilte. K. staunte das Mädchen noch an, während es sich schon umgedreht hatte, um die Wohnungstüre wieder zu versperren, es hatte ein puppenförmig gerundetes Gesicht, nicht nur die bleichen Wangen und das Kinn verliefen rund, auch die Schläfen und die Stirnränder. »Josef!« rief der Onkel wieder, und das Mädchen fragte er: »Es ist das Herzleiden?« »Ich glaube wohl«, sagte das Mädchen, es hatte Zeit gefunden, mit der Kerze voranzugehen und die Zimmertür zu öffnen. In einem Winkel des Zimmers, wohin das Kerzenlicht noch nicht drang, erhob sich im Bett ein Gesicht mit langem Bart. »Leni, wer kommt denn?« fragte der Advokat, der, durch die Kerze geblendet, die Gäste nicht erkannte. »Albert, dein alter Freund ist es«, sagte der Onkel. »Ach, Albert«, sagte der Advokat und ließ sich auf die Kissen zurückfallen, als bedürfe es diesem Besuch gegenüber keiner Verstellung. »Steht es wirklich so schlecht?« fragte der Onkel und setzte sich auf den Bettrand. »Ich glaube es nicht. Es ist ein Anfall deines Herzleidens und wird vorübergehen wie die früheren.« »Möglich«, sagte der Advokat leise, »es ist aber ärger, als es jemals gewesen ist. Ich atme schwer, schlafe gar nicht und verliere täglich an Kraft.« »So«, sagte der Onkel und drückte den Panamahut mit seiner großen Hand fest aufs Knie. »Das sind schlechte Nachrichten. Hast du übrigens die richtige Pflege? Es ist auch so traurig hier, so dunkel. Es ist schon lange her, seit ich zum letztenmal hier war, damals schien es mir freundlicher. Auch dein kleines Fräulein hier scheint nicht sehr lustig, oder sie verstellt sich.« Das Mädchen stand noch immer mit der Kerze nahe bei der Tür; soweit ihr unbestimmter Blick erkennen ließ, sah sie eher K. an als den Onkel, selbst als dieser jetzt von ihr sprach. K. lehnte an einem Sessel, den er in die Nähe des Mädchens geschoben hatte. »Wenn man so krank ist wie ich«, sagte der Advokat, »muß man Ruhe haben. Mir ist es nicht traurig.« Nach einer kleinen Pause fügte er hinzu: »Und Leni pflegt mich gut, sie ist brav.« Den Onkel konnte das aber nicht überzeugen, er war sichtlich gegen die Pflegerin voreingenommen, und wenn er auch dem Kranken nichts entgegnete, so verfolgte er doch die Pflegerin mit strengen Blicken, als sie jetzt zum Bett hinging, die Kerze auf das Nachttischchen stellte, sich über den Kranken hinbeugte und beim Ordnen der Kissen mit ihm flüsterte. Er vergaß fast die Rücksicht auf den Kranken, stand auf, ging hinter der Pflegerin hin und her, und K. hätte es nicht gewundert, wenn er sie hinten an den Röcken erfaßt und vom Bett fortgezogen hätte. K. selbst sah allem ruhig zu, die Krankheit des Advokaten war ihm sogar nicht ganz unwillkommen, dem Eifer, den der Onkel für seine Sache entwickelt hatte, hatte er sich nicht entgegenstellen können, die Ablenkung, die dieser Eifer jetzt ohne sein Zutun erfuhr, nahm er gerne hin. Da sagte der Onkel, vielleicht nur in der Absicht, die Pflegerin zu beleidigen: »Fräulein, bitte, lassen Sie uns ein Weilchen allein, ich habe mit meinem Freund eine persönliche Angelegenheit zu besprechen.« Die Pflegerin, die noch weit über den Kranken hingebeugt war und gerade das Leintuch an der Wand glättete, wendete nur den Kopf und sagte sehr ruhig, was einen auffallenden Unterschied zu den vor Wut stockenden und dann wieder überfließenden Reden des Onkels bildete: »Sie sehen, der Herr ist so krank, er kann keine Angelegenheiten besprechen.« Sie hatte die Worte des Onkels wahrscheinlich nur aus Bequemlichkeit wiederholt, immerhin konnte es selbst von einem Unbeteiligten als spöttisch aufgefaßt werden, der Onkel aber fuhr natürlich wie ein Gestochener auf. »Du Verdammte«, sagte er im ersten Gurgeln der Aufregung noch ziemlich unverständlich, K. erschrak, obwohl er etwas Ähnliches erwartet hatte, und lief auf den Onkel zu, mit der bestimmten Absicht, ihm mit beiden Händen den Mund zu schließen. Glücklicherweise erhob sich aber hinter dem Mädchen der Kranke, der Onkel machte ein finsteres Gesicht, als schlucke er etwas Abscheuliches hinunter, und sagte dann ruhiger: »Wir haben natürlich auch noch den Verstand nicht verloren; wäre das, was ich verlange, nicht möglich, würde ich es nicht verlangen. Bitte, gehen Sie jetzt!« Die Pflegerin stand aufgerichtet am Bett, dem Onkel voll zugewendet, mit der einen Hand streichelte sie, wie K. zu bemerken glaubte, die Hand des Advokaten. »Du kannst vor Leni alles sagen«, sagte der Kranke, zweifellos im Ton einer dringenden Bitte. »Es betrifft mich nicht«, sagte der Onkel, »es ist nicht mein Geheimnis.« Und er drehte sich um, als gedenke er in keine Verhandlungen mehr einzugehen, gebe aber noch eine kleine Bedenkzeit. »Wen betrifft es denn?« fragte der Advokat mit erlöschender Stimme und legte sich wieder zurück. »Meinen Neffen«, sagte der Onkel, »ich habe ihn auch mitgebracht.« Und er stellte vor: »Prokurist Josef K.« »Oh«, sagte der Kranke viel lebhafter und streckte K. die Hand entgegen, »verzeihen Sie, ich habe Sie gar nicht bemerkt. Geh, Leni«, sagte er dann zu der Pflegerin, die sich auch gar nicht mehr wehrte, und reichte ihr die Hand, als gelte es einen Abschied für lange Zeit. »Du bist also«, sagte er endlich zum Onkel, der, auch versöhnt, näher getreten war, »nicht gekommen, mir einen Krankenbesuch zu machen, sondern du kommst in Geschäften.«","'Dear uncle,' said K., 'the excitement is so useless, it's on your side and it would be on mine too. You don't win the lawsuits with excitement, let my practical experiences count a little, just as I always and now very much respect yours, even if they surprise me. Since you say that the family would also be affected by the lawsuit - which for my part I cannot understand at all, but that is a minor matter - I am happy to agree with you in everything. Only I don't think that staying in the country is advantageous, even in your sense, because that would mean fleeing and feeling guilty. Besides, although I'm more persecuted here, I can also do more of the work myself."" ""Right,"" said the uncle in a tone as if they were finally getting closer to each other, ""I only made the suggestion because, when you're here stayed, saw the matter endangered by your indifference and thought it better if I worked for you instead of you. But if you want to do it yourself with all your might, then of course it's far better."" ""So we'd agree on that,"" said K. ""And now do you have a suggestion as to what I should do first?"" ""Of course I have to think it over,"" said the uncle, ""you have to consider that I've been in the country almost continuously for twenty years now, and my instinct for these things is waning. Various important connections with figures who may be more familiar with the area have loosened themselves. I'm a little deserted in the country, you know that. You only really notice it on such occasions. In part, your case came as a surprise to me, even if, strangely enough, I suspected something of the sort after Erna's letter and today, seeing you, almost knew it with certainty. But that doesn’t matter, the most important thing now is not to lose any time.” During his speech he had already waved to an automobile, standing on tiptoe, and now, while calling out an address to the charioteer, pulled K. behind him into the Car. 'We're going to see Mr Huld,' he said, 'he was my classmate. Do you know the name too? Not? But that's strange. After all, he has an important reputation as a defense attorney and advocate for the poor. But I have a great deal of trust in him as a person.' 'Anything you do is fine with me,' said K., although the hasty and urgent way in which his uncle was dealing with the matter made him uncomfortable. It wasn't very pleasant to go to a poor man's advocate as a defendant. 'I didn't know,' he said, 'that you could get a lawyer involved in a matter like this.' 'Of course,' said the uncle, 'that goes without saying. Why not? And now tell me everything that has happened so far, so that I am fully informed about the matter.” K. began to tell the story immediately, without concealing anything, his complete openness was the only protest he made against his uncle's opinion , the trial was a great shame, could allow. He mentioned Fraulein Bürstner's name only once and briefly, but that didn't affect his openness, because Fraulein Bürstner had no connection with the trial. While he was telling the story, he looked out the window and saw them approaching the suburb where the court offices were. He drew his uncle's attention to this, but he did not find the coincidence particularly striking. The car stopped in front of a dark house. The uncle rang the bell at the first door on the ground floor; while they waited he bared his big teeth with a smile and whispered, 'Eight o'clock, an unusual time for party visits. But Huld doesn't take it amiss.' Two large, black eyes appeared in the window of the door, looked at the two guests for a while and then disappeared; but the door did not open. Uncle and K. mutually confirmed the fact that they had seen the two eyes. ""A new chambermaid who's afraid of strangers,"" said the uncle, and knocked again. The eyes appeared again, you could almost take them for sad now, but maybe that was just an illusion, caused by the open gas flame, which burned with a strong hiss near above the heads, but gave little light. ""Open it,"" called the uncle and banged his fist on the door, ""they are friends of the lawyer!"" ""The lawyer is ill,"" someone whispered behind them. In a doorway at the other end of the little passage stood a gentleman in a dressing gown and made this announcement in an extremely low voice. The uncle, who was already furious because of the long wait, turned around abruptly and called out: ""Sick? You say he is sick?' and approached him almost menacingly, as if the Lord were the sickness. ""They're already open,"" said the gentleman, pointing to the lawyer's door, gathering up his dressing gown and disappearing. The door had really been opened, and a young girl—K. recognized her dark, slightly bulging eyes—was standing in the antechamber in a long white apron, holding a candle in her hand. ""Next open earlier!"" said the uncle instead of greeting, while the girl curtsied a little. ""Come on, Josef,"" he then said to K., who slowly pushed past the girl. ""The Herr Advocate is ill,"" said the girl, as her uncle rushed towards a door without stopping. K. was still staring at the girl while she had already turned around to lock the apartment door again, she had a doll-like rounded face, not only her pale cheeks and chin were round, but also her temples and the edges of her forehead. ""Josef!"" called the uncle again, and he asked the girl: ""It's the heart condition?"" ""I think so,"" said the girl, having found time to go ahead with the candle and open the door. In a corner of the room, where the candlelight had not yet penetrated, a face with a long beard rose from the bed. ""Leni, who's coming?"" asked the lawyer, who, blinded by the candle, didn't recognize the guests. ""Albert, it's your old friend,"" said the uncle. ""Oh, Albert,"" said the lawyer and fell back on the cushions as if there was no need to disguise this visit. ""Is it really that bad?"" asked the uncle, sitting down on the edge of the bed. ""I do not believe it. It is an attack of your heart trouble and will pass like the earlier ones."" ""Possibly,"" said the lawyer softly, ""but it is worse than it has ever been. I breathe heavily, I don't sleep at all, and I'm losing strength every day.' 'So,' said the uncle, pressing his panama hat firmly onto his knee with his big hand. 'This is bad news. By the way, do you have the right care? It's so sad here too, so dark. It's been a long time since I was here last, it seemed friendlier to me then. Your little lady here doesn't seem very merry either, or she's pretending.' The girl was still standing near the door with the candle; as far as her vague look indicated, she looked more at K. than at her uncle, even when he was now talking about her. K. was leaning against a chair that he had pushed near the girl. 'When you're as ill as I am,' said the lawyer, 'you have to be in peace. I'm not sad."" After a short pause he added: ""And Leni takes good care of me, she's good."" But that didn't convince the uncle, he was visibly prejudiced against the nurse, even if he didn't care about the patient replied, he followed the nurse with severe eyes as she went to the bed, put the candle on the bedside table, bent over the patient and whispered to him while arranging the pillows. He almost forgot to think of the sick man, got up, walked back and forth behind the nurse, and K. wouldn't have been surprised if he had grabbed her back by the skirts and pulled her off the bed. K. himself watched everything calmly, the lawyer's illness was not entirely unwelcome to him, he had not been able to oppose the zeal that his uncle had developed for his cause, the distraction that this zeal now experienced without his doing he gladly accepted. Then the uncle said, perhaps only with the intention of insulting the nurse: ""Miss, please leave us alone for a while, I have a personal matter to discuss with my friend."" The nurse, who was still bending far over the patient was smoothing the sheet on the wall, just turned his head and said very calmly, which was a striking contrast to the uncle's speeches, which faltered with anger and then overflowed again: ""You see, the gentleman is so ill, he can't Discuss matters.' She had probably only repeated her uncle's words out of convenience, after all it could be taken as mocking even by an uninvolved person, but the uncle naturally started up like a prick. ""Damn you,"" he said, still quite incomprehensibly in the first gurgle of excitement. K. got a fright, although he had expected something similar, and ran towards his uncle with the definite intention of closing his mouth with both hands. Luckily, the patient stood up behind the girl, the uncle scowled, as if he was swallowing something horrible, and then said more calmly: ""Of course we haven't lost our minds either; if what I ask for was not possible, I would not ask for it. Please go now!' The nurse stood up straight by the bed, fully turned towards the uncle, with one hand she was stroking the lawyer's hand, as K. thought he noticed. ""You can say anything in front of Leni,"" said the patient, undoubtedly in the tone of an urgent request. ""It doesn't concern me,"" said the uncle, ""it's not my secret."" And he turned around as if he didn't intend to enter into any more negotiations, but would give him a little time to think it over. ""Who does it concern?"" asked the lawyer in a fading voice and lay back again. ""My nephew,"" said the uncle, ""I brought him with me too."" And he introduced himself: ""Authorized signatory Josef K."" didn't even notice you. Go, Leni,' he then said to the nurse, who no longer resisted at all, and shook her hand as if it meant saying goodbye for a long time. ""So you didn't come,"" he said at last to his uncle, who had come closer, also reconciled, ""you didn't come to visit me, you came on business.""","“Dear Uncle,” said K., “there’s no use getting excited, it won’t help either of us. Trials aren’t won by getting excited, let my practical experience count for something, just as I’ve always valued yours and still do, even when I’m surprised by it. Since you say that the family will suffer too because of the trial—which for my part I really can’t understand, but that’s beside the point—I’ll gladly do as you say in all things. Except that I don’t think a stay in the country would be to my advantage, even in the sense you intend, because it would imply flight and a guilty conscience. And although they certainly follow me more closely here, I can also take a more active role in the case.” “Right,” said his uncle as if they were at last on the same track, “I only made that suggestion because I was afraid if you remained here your case would be damaged by your own indifference, and I thought it better to act in your behalf. But if you intend to pursue it as strongly as possible yourself, that’s obviously far better.” “So we seem to be in agreement on that,” said K. “And now do you have a suggestion as to what I should do next?” “I still have to think the matter over of course,” his uncle said, “you’ve got to remember that I’ve spent the past twenty years almost exclusively in the countryside, where one tends to lose the flair for this sort of thing. Various important connections with well-placed persons who might know more about such matters have weakened over time. I’ve been somewhat isolated in the countryside, as you well know. That’s something you don’t really realize yourself until something like this comes up. And your case has caught me partly by surprise, although in a strange way I suspected something like this after Erna’s letter, and knew almost for certain the moment I saw you today. But that’s beside the point, the important thing now is not to lose any time.” Even as he was speaking he rose up on tiptoe and waved for a cab, and now he pulled K. after him into the car as he called out an address to the driver. “Now we’re going to see Huld, the lawyer,” he said, “he was my classmate in school. You know the name of course? No? That’s odd. He has a considerable reputation as a defense counsel and poor man’s lawyer. But it’s his human qualities I place my trust in.” “Anything you want to do is fine with me,” K. said, in spite of the fact that the hasty and aggressive manner with which his uncle was handling the matter made him uncomfortable. As a defendant, it wasn’t very pleasant to be heading for a poor man’s lawyer. “I didn’t know,” he said, “that a person could engage a lawyer in this sort of case too.” “But of course,” his uncle said, “that goes without saying. Why not? And now tell me everything that’s happened up to now, so I’m fully informed about the matter.” K. began telling him immediately, without concealing anything; his total frankness was the only protest he could allow himself against his uncle’s opinion that the trial was a terrible disgrace. He mentioned Fräulein Bürstner’s name only once in passing, but that didn’t detract from his frankness, since Fräulein Bürstner wasn’t connected with the trial in any way. As he spoke he looked out the window and noticed that they were approaching the very suburb where the law court offices were located; he pointed this out to his uncle, who, however, did not find the coincidence particularly striking. The cab stopped in front of a dark building. His uncle rang the bell at the first door on the ground floor; while they waited he bared his large teeth in a smile and whispered: “Eight o’clock, an unusual hour for a client to visit. But Huld won’t hold it against me.” At a peephole in the door appeared two large dark eyes, stared at the two visitors for a moment, then disappeared; the door, however, did not open. K. and his uncle mutually confirmed the fact that they had seen two eyes. “A new maid who’s afraid of strangers,” his uncle said, and knocked again. Once more the eyes appeared; they could almost be considered sad now, but that might well have been a mere illusion produced by the open gas flame that burned with a hiss directly over their heads but shed little light. “Open up,” his uncle called out, and pounded his fist against the door, “we’re friends of Herr Huld.” “Herr Huld is ill,” came a whisper from behind them. In a doorway at the other end of the narrow hall stood a man in a dressing gown who delivered this message in the softest voice possible. His uncle, who was already furious at the long wait, turned around abruptly and cried out: “Ill? You say he’s ill?” and walked over to him almost menacingly, as if the man were the illness. “The door’s open now,” the man said, pointed to the lawyer’s door, gathered up his dressing gown, and disappeared. The door had indeed opened, and a young girl—K. recognized the dark, slightly protruding eyes—was standing in a long white apron in the entranceway, holding a candle in her hand. “Next time open more quickly,” his uncle said instead of a greeting, while the girl made a small curtsy. “Come on, Josef,” he said to K., who made his way slowly past the girl. “Herr Huld is ill,” said the girl, since K.’s uncle was hurrying toward the door without pausing. K. was still staring at the girl as she turned around to relock the apartment door; she had a round, doll-like face, her pale cheeks and chin forming a circle completed by her temples and forehead. “Josef,” his uncle cried again, and asked the girl: “Is it his heart condition?” “I think so,” said the girl, who had found time to precede them with the candle and open the door. In a corner of the room the candlelight did not yet reach, a face with a long beard rose in the bed. “Leni, who is it?” asked the lawyer, who, blinded by the candle, did not yet recognize the guests. “It’s your old friend Albert,” his uncle said. “Oh, Albert,” said the lawyer and fell back upon the pillows, as if he didn’t have to pretend for this visit. “Are things really so bad?” asked his uncle, and sat down on the edge of the bed. “I don’t believe it. It’s just your heart acting up again; it will pass as it has before.” “Possibly,” the lawyer said softly, “but it’s worse than it’s ever been. I have a hard time breathing, I can’t sleep at all, and I’m getting weaker every day.” “I see,” said K.’s uncle, and pressed his Panama hat firmly down on his knee with his large hand. “That’s bad news. Are you sure you’re receiving proper care? It’s so dark and gloomy here, too. It’s been a long time since I was here, but it seemed more cheerful in the past. And this little maid of yours doesn’t seem very jolly, or else she’s hiding it.” The girl was still standing by the door, holding the candle; as far as one could judge from her vague gaze she was looking at K. rather than his uncle, even now that the latter was talking about her. K. was leaning against a chair he had placed near the girl. “When you’re as sick as I am,” said the lawyer, “you need peace and quiet. I don’t find it gloomy.” After a brief pause he added: “And Leni takes good care of me, she’s a good girl.” But that didn’t convince K.’s uncle; he was obviously prejudiced against the nurse, and although he didn’t contradict the sick man, he eyed her sternly as she now approached the bed, placed the candle on the nightstand, bent over the sick man, and whispered to him as she straightened his pillows. Almost forgetting his consideration for the sick man, he stood up and paced back and forth behind the nurse, and K. would not have been surprised to see him seize her from behind by the skirts and pull her away from the bed. K. himself watched all this calmly; in fact the lawyer’s illness was not wholly unwelcome, for he had not been able to stem his uncle’s zeal with regard to his case, and now he was glad to see that zeal deflected through no fault of his own. Then, perhaps merely intending to wound the nurse, his uncle said: “Young lady, please leave us alone for a while, I have a personal matter I wish to discuss with my friend.” The nurse, who was still leaning across the sick man and was just smoothing the covers next to the wall, merely turned her head and said calmly, in striking contrast to his uncle, who had first choked with rage before bursting out in speech: “You can see he’s too ill to discuss any personal matter.” She’d probably repeated his uncle’s words for simplicity’s sake; nevertheless, even a neutral observer could have taken it for mockery, and his uncle naturally reacted as if he’d been stabbed. “You damned—” he said somewhat indistinctly in his first gurgle of agitation; K. was startled even though he’d expected something of the sort, and ran over to his uncle, firmly intending to cover his mouth with both hands. Fortunately, however, the sick man rose up behind the girl; K.’s uncle made a bitter face, as if he were swallowing something particularly nasty, and then said more calmly: “We haven’t taken leave of our senses of course; if what I’m requesting weren’t reasonable, I wouldn’t request it. Now please leave.” The nurse stood beside the bed, facing K.’s uncle fully, one hand, as K. thought he noticed, stroking the lawyer’s hand. “You can say anything in front of Leni,” the sick man said, in a clearly imploring tone. “But this doesn’t concern me,” said K.’s uncle, “it is not my secret.” And he turned around as if he had no intention of discussing the matter further but would give him a little more time to think it over. “Whom does it concern then?” the lawyer asked, his voice fading, and lay back down. “My nephew,” said the uncle, “and I’ve brought him along.” Then he introduced him: “Chief Financial Officer Josef K.” “Oh,” said the sick man much more energetically, and put out his hand toward K., “please excuse me, I didn’t see you at all.” “Go on, Leni,” he then said to his nurse, who put up no further resistance, and gave her his hand as if they were parting for some time. “So,” he said at last to K.’s uncle, who had also drawn nearer, appeased, “you didn’t come to pay a sick call, you came on business.”","""Dear Uncle,"" said K., ""it's no use getting excited, it's as useless on your part as it would be on mine. No case is won by getting excited, you might let my practical experience count for something, look how I respect yours, as I have always done, even when you astonish me. Since you tell me that the family would be involved in any scandal arising from the case -- I don't see myself how that could be so, but that's beside the point -- I'll submit willingly to your judgment. Only I think going to the country would he inadvisable even from your point of view, for it would look like flight and therefore guilt. Besides, though I'm more hard-pressed here, I can push the case on my own more energetically."" "" Quite right,"" said his uncle in a tone of relief, as if he saw their minds converging at last, ""I only made the suggestion because I thought your indifference would endanger the case while you stayed here, and that it might be better if I took it up for you instead. But if you intend to push it energetically yourself, that of course would be far better."" ""We're agreed on that, then,"" said K. "" And now can you suggest what my first step should be?"" ""I'll have to do a bit of thinking about it, naturally,"" said his uncle, ""you must consider that I have lived in the country for twenty years almost without a break, and my flair for such matters can't be so good as it was. Various connections of mine with influential persons who would probably know better than I how to tackle this affair have slackened in the course of time. I'm a bit isolated in the country, as you know yourself. Actually it's only in emergencies like this that one becomes aware of it. Besides, this affair of yours has come on me more or less unexpectedly, though strangely enough, after Erna's letter, I guessed at something of the kind, and as soon as I saw you today I was almost sure of it. Still that doesn't matter, the important thing now is to lose no time. "" Before he had finished speaking he was already on tiptoe waiting for a taxi, and now, shouting an address to the driver, he dragged K. into the car after him. ""We'll drive straight to Huld, the lawyer,"" he said. ""He was at school with me. You know his name, of course? You don't? That is really extraordinary. He has quite a considerable reputation as a defending counsel and a poor man's lawyer. But it's as a human being that I'm prepared to pin my faith to him."" ""I'm willing to try anything you suggest,"" said K., though the hasty headlong way in which his uncle was dealing with the matter caused him some perturbation. It was not very flattering to be driven to a poor man's lawyer as a petitioner. ""I did not know,"" he said, ""that in a case like this one could employ a lawyer."" ""But of course,"" said his uncle. ""That's obvious. Why not? And now tell me everything that has happened up to now, so that I have some idea where we stand."" K. at once began his story and left out no single detail, for absolute frankness was the only protest he could make against his uncle's assumption that the case was a terrible disgrace. Fräulein Bürstner's name he mentioned only once and in passing, but that did not detract from his frankness, since Fräulein Bürstner had no connection with the case. As he told his story he gazed out through the window and noted that they were approaching the very suburb where the Law Court had its attic offices; he drew his uncle's attention to this fact, but his uncle did not seem to be particularly struck by the coincidence. The taxi stopped before a dark house. His uncle rang the bell of the first door on the ground floor; while they were waiting he bared his great teeth in a smile and whispered: ""Eight o'clock, an unusual time for clients to call. But Huld won't take it amiss from me. "" Behind a grille in the door two great dark eyes appeared, gazed at the two visitors for a moment, and then vanished again; yet the door did not open. K. and his uncle assured each other that they had really seen a pair of eyes. "" A new maid, probably afraid of strangers,"" said K.'s uncle and knocked again. Once more the eyes appeared and now they seemed almost sad, yet that might have been an illusion created by the naked gas-jet which burned just over their heads and kept hissing shrilly but gave little light. "" Open the door !"" shouted K.'s uncle, banging upon it with his fists, ""we're friends of Herr Huld."" ""Herr Huld is ill,"" came a whisper from behind them. A door had opened at the other end of the little passage and a man in a dressing-gown was standing there imparting this information in a hushed voice. K.'s uncle, already furious at having had to wait so long, whirled round shouting: "" Ill? You say he's ill?"" and bore down almost threateningly on the man as if he were the alleged illness in person. ""The door has been opened,"" said the man, indicated the lawyer's door, caught his dressing-gown about him, and disappeared. The door really was open, a young girl -- K. recognized the dark, somewhat protuberant eyes -- was standing in the entrance hail in a long white apron, holding a candle in her hand. "" Next time he a little smarter in opening the door,"" K.'s uncle threw at her instead of a greeting, while she sketched a curtsy. "" Come on, Joseph,"" he cried to K., who was slowly insinuating himself past the girl. "" Herr Huld is ill,"" said the girl, as K.'s uncle, without any hesitation, made toward an inner door. K. was still glaring at the girl, who turned her back on him to bolt the house door; she had a doll-like rounded face; not only were her pale cheeks and her chin quite round in their modeling, but her temples and the line of her forehead as well. ""Joseph!"" K.'s uncle shouted again, and he asked the girl: ""Is it his heart?"" ""I think so,"" said the girl, she had now found time to precede him with the candle and open the door of a room. In one corner, which the candlelight had not yet reached, a face with a long beard was raised from a pillow. "" Leni, who is it?"" asked the lawyer, who, blinded by the candlelight, could not recognize his visitors. ""It's your old friend Albert,"" said K.'s uncle. ""Oh, Albert,"" said the lawyer, sinking back on his pillow again, as if there were no need to keep up appearances before this visitor. ""Are you really in a bad way?"" asked K.'s uncle, sitting down on the edge of the bed. ""I can't believe it. It's one of your heart attacks and it'll pass over like all the others."" ""Maybe,"" said the lawyer in a faint voice, ""but it's worse than it's ever been before. I find it difficult to breathe, can't sleep at all, and am losing strength daily."" ""I see,"" said K.'s uncle, pressing his panama hat firmly against his knee with his huge hand. ""That's bad news. But are you being properly looked after? And it's so gloomy in here, so dark. It's a long time since I was here last, but it looked more cheerful then. And this little maid of yours doesn't seem to be very bright, or else she's concealing the fact."" The girl was still standing near the door with her candle; as far as one could make out from the vague flicker of her eyes, she seemed to be looking at K. rather than at his uncle, even while the latter was speaking about her. K. was leaning against a chair which he had pushed near her. ""When a man is as ill as I am,"" said the lawyer, ""he must have quiet. I don't find it gloomy."" After a slight pause he added: ""And Leni looks after me well, she's a good girl."" * But this could not convince K.'s uncle, who was visibly prejudiced against the nurse, and though he made no reply to the sick man he followed her with a stern eye as she went over to the bed, set down the candle on the bedside table, bent over her patient, and whispered to him while she rearranged the pillows. K.'s uncle, almost forgetting that he was in a sick-room, jumped to his feet and prowled up and down behind the girl; K. would not have been surprised if he had seized her by the skirts and dragged her away from the bed. K. himself looked on with detachment, the illness of the lawyer was not entirely unwelcome to him, he had not been able to oppose his uncle's growing ardor for his cause, and he thankfully accepted the situation, which had deflected that ardor without any connivance from him. Then his uncle, perhaps only with the intention of offending the nurse, cried out: ""Fräulein, please be so good as to leave us alone for a while; I want to consult my friend on some personal business. "" The girl, who was still bending down over the sick man smoothing the sheet beside the wall, merely turned her head and said quite calmly, in striking contrast to the furious stuttering and frothing of K.'s uncle: ""You see that my master is ill; he cannot be consulted about business. "" She had probably reiterated the phrase from sheer indolence; all the same it could have been construed as mockery even by an unprejudiced observer, and K.'s uncle naturally flared up as if he had been stung. ""You damned --"" he spluttered, but he was so furious as to be hardly intelligible. K. started up in alarm, though he had expected some such outburst, and rushed over to his uncle with the firm intention of clapping both hands over his mouth and so silencing him. Fortunately the patient raised himself up in bed behind the girl. K.'s uncle made a wry grimace as if he were swallowing some nauseous draught and he said in a smoother voice: ""I assure you we aren't altogether out of our senses; if what I ask were impossible I should not ask it. Please go away now. "" The girl straightened herself be- side the bed, turning full toward K.'s uncle, but with one hand, at least so K. surmised, she was patting the lawyer's hand. ""You can discuss anything before Leni,"" said the lawyer in a voice of sheer entreaty. ""This does not concern myself,"" said K.'s uncle, ""it is not my secret. "" And he turned away as if washing his hands of the matter, although willing to give the lawyer a moment for reconsideration. "" Then whom does it concern ? "" asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice, lying down again. "" My nephew,"" said K.'s uncle, ""I have brought him here with me. "" And he presented his nephew: Joseph K., Chief Clerk. "" Oh,"" said the sick man with much more animation, stretching out his hand to K., ""forgive me , I didn't notice you. Go now, Leni,"" he said to the nurse, clasping her by the hand as if saying good-by to her for a long time, and she went submissively enough. "" So you haven't come,"" he said at last to K.'s uncle, who was now appeased and had gone up to the bed again, ""to pay me a sick visit; you've come on business.","“My dear Uncle,” said K., “it won't do any good to get excited , it's no good for you to do it and it'd be no good for me to do it. The case won't be won by getting excited, and please admit that my practical experience counts for something, just as I have always and still do respect your experience, even when it surprises me. You say that the family will also be affected by this trial; I really can't see how, but that's beside the point and I'm quite willing to follow your instructions in all of this. Only, I don't see any advantage in staying in the country, not even for you, as that would indicate flight and a sense of guilt. And besides, although I am more subject to persecution if I stay in the city I can also press the matter forward better here.” “You're right,” said his uncle in a tone that seemed to indicate they were finally coming closer to each other, “I just made the suggestion because, as I saw it, if you stay in the city the case will be put in danger by your indifference to it, and I thought it was better if I did the work for you. But will you push things forward yourself with all your strength, if so, that will naturally be far better.” “We're agreed then,” said K. “And do you have any suggestions for what I should do next?” “Well, naturally I'll have to think about it,” said his uncle, “you must bear in mind that I've been living in the country for twenty years now, almost without a break, you lose your ability to deal with matters like this. But I do have some important connections with several people who, I expect, know their way around these things better than I do, and to contact them is a matter of course. Out there in the country I've been getting out of condition, I'm sure you're already aware of that. It's only at times like this that you notice it yourself. And this affair of yours came largely unexpected, although, oddly enough, I had expected something of the sort after I'd read Erna's letter, and today when I saw your face I knew it with almost total certainty. But all that is by the by, the important thing now is, we have no time to lose.” Even while he was still speaking, K.'s uncle had stood on tiptoe to summon a taxi and now he pulled K. into the car behind himself as he called out an address to the driver. “We're going now to see Dr. Huld, the lawyer,” he said, “we were at school together. I'm sure you know the name, don't you? No? Well that is odd. He's got a very good reputation as a defence barrister and for working with the poor. But I esteem him especially as someone you can trust.” “It's alright with me, whatever you do,” said K., although he was made uneasy by the rushed and urgent way his uncle was dealing with the matter. It was not very encouraging, as the accused, be to taken to a lawyer for poor people. “I didn't know,” he said, “that you could take on a lawyer in matters like this.” “Well of course you can,” said his uncle, “that goes without saying. Why wouldn't you take on a lawyer? And now, so that I'm properly instructed in this matter, tell me what's been happening so far.” K. instantly began telling his uncle about what had been happening, holding nothing back—being completely open with him was the only way that K. could protest at his uncle's belief that the trial was a great disgrace. He mentioned Miss Borstner's name just once and in passing, but that did nothing to diminish his openness about the trial as Miss Borstner had no connection with it. As he spoke, he looked out the window and saw how, just then, they were getting closer to the suburb where the court offices were. He drew this to his uncle's attention, but he did not find the coincidence especially remarkable. The taxi stopped in front of a dark building. K.'s uncle knocked at the very first door at ground level; while they waited he smiled, showing his big teeth, and whispered, “Eight o'clock; not the usual sort of time to be visiting a lawyer, but Huld won't mind it from me.” Two large, black eyes appeared in the spy-hatch in the door, they stared at the two visitors for a while and then disappeared; the door, however, did not open. K. and his uncle confirmed to each other the fact that they had seen the two eyes. “A new maid, afraid of strangers,” said K.'s uncle, and knocked again. The eyes appeared once more. This time they seemed almost sad, but the open gas flame that burned with a hiss close above their heads gave off little light and that may have merely created an illusion. “Open the door,” called K.'s uncle, raising his fist against it, “we are friends of Dr. Huld, the lawyer!” “Dr. Huld is ill,” whispered someone behind them. In a doorway at the far end of a narrow passage stood a man in his dressing gown, giving them this information in an extremely quiet voice. K.'s uncle, who had already been made very angry by the long wait, turned abruptly round and retorted, “Ill? You say he's ill?” and strode towards the gentleman in a way that seemed almost threatening, as if he were the illness himself. “They've opened the door for you, now,” said the gentleman, pointing at the door of the lawyer. He pulled his dressing gown together and disappeared. The door had indeed been opened, a young girl—K. recognised the dark, slightly bulging eyes—stood in the hallway in a long white apron, holding a candle in her hand. “Next time, open up sooner!” said K.'s uncle instead of a greeting, while the girl made a slight curtsey. “Come along, Josef,” he then said to K. who was slowly moving over towards the girl. “Mr. Huld is unwell,” said the girl as K.'s uncle, without stopping, rushed towards one of the doors. K. continued to look at the girl in amazement as she turned round to block the way into the living room, she had a round face like a puppy's, not only the pale cheeks and the chin were round but the temples and the hairline were too. “Josef!” called his uncle once more, and he asked the girl, “It's trouble with his heart, is it?” “I think it is, sir,” said the girl, who by now had found time to go ahead with the candle and open the door into the room. In one corner of the room, where the light of the candle did not reach, a face with a long beard looked up from the bed. “Leni, who's this coming in?” asked the lawyer, unable to recognise his guests because he was dazzled by the candle. “It's your old friend, Albert,” said K.'s uncle. “Oh, Albert,” said the lawyer, falling back onto his pillow as if this visit meant he would not need to keep up appearances. “Is it really as bad as that?” asked K.'s uncle, sitting on the edge of the bed. “I don't believe it is. It's a recurrence of your heart trouble and it'll pass over like the other times.” “Maybe,” said the lawyer quietly, “but it's just as much trouble as it's ever been. I can hardly breathe , I can't sleep at all and I'm getting weaker by the day.” “I see,” said K.'s uncle, pressing his panama hat firmly against his knee with his big hand. “That is bad news. But are you getting the right sort of care? And it's so depressing in here , it's so dark. It's a long time since I was last here, but it seemed to me friendlier then. Even your young lady here doesn't seem to have much life in her, unless she's just pretending.” The maid was still standing by the door with the candle; as far as could be made out, she was watching K. more than she was watching his uncle even while the latter was still speaking about her. K. leant against a chair that he had pushed near to the girl. “When you're as ill as I am,” said the lawyer, “you need to have peace. I don't find it depressing.” After a short pause he added, “and Leni looks after me well , she's a good girl.” But that was not enough to persuade K.'s uncle, he had visibly taken against his friend's carer and, even though he did not contradict the invalid, he persecuted her with his scowl as she went over to the bed, put the candle on the bedside table and, leaning over the bed, made a fuss of him by tidying the pillows. K.'s uncle nearly forgot the need to show any consideration for the man who lay ill in bed, he stood up, walked up and down behind the carer, and K. would not have been surprised if he had grabbed hold of her skirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed. K. himself looked on calmly, he was not even disappointed at finding the lawyer unwell, he had been able to do nothing to oppose the enthusiasm his uncle had developed for the matter, he was glad that this enthusiasm had now been distracted without his having to do anything about it. His uncle, probably simply wishing to be offensive to the lawyer's attendant, then said, “Young lady, now please leave us alone for a while, I have some personal matters to discuss with my friend.” Dr. Huld's carer was still leant far over the invalid's bed and smoothing out the cloth covering the wall next to it, she merely turned her head and then, in striking contrast with the anger that first stopped K.'s uncle from speaking and then let the words out in a gush, she said very quietly, “You can see that Dr. Huld is so ill that he can't discuss any matters at all.” It was probably just for the sake of convenience that she had repeated the words spoken by K.'s uncle, but an onlooker might even have perceived it as mocking him and he, of course, jumped up as if he had just been stabbed. “You damned ... ,” in the first gurglings of his excitement his words could hardly be understood, K. was startled even though he had been expecting something of the sort and ran to his uncle with the intention, no doubt, of closing his mouth with both his hands. Fortunately, though, behind the girl, the invalid raised himself up, K.'s uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting and then, somewhat calmer, said, “We have naturally not lost our senses, not yet; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking for it. Now please, go!” The carer stood up straight by the bed directly facing K.'s uncle, K. thought he noticed that with one hand she was stroking the lawyer's hand. “You can say anything in front of Leni,” said the invalid, in a tone that was unmistakably imploring. “It's not my business,” said K.'s uncle, “and it's not my secrets.” And he twisted himself round as if wanting to go into no more negotiations but giving himself a little more time to think. “Whose business is it then?” asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again. “My nephew's,” said K.'s uncle, “and I've brought him along with me.” And he introduced him, “Chief Clerk Josef K.” “Oh!” said the invalid, now with much more life in him, and reached out his hand towards K. “Do forgive me, I didn't notice you there at all.” Then he then said to his carer, “Leni, go,” stretching his hand out to her as if this were a farewell that would have to last for a long time. This time the girl offered no resistance. “So you,” he finally said to K.'s uncle, who had also calmed down and stepped closer, “you haven't come to visit me because I'm ill but you've come on business.”","""My dear Uncle,"" said K., ""it won't do any good to get excited , it's no good for you to do it and it'd be no good for me to do it. The case won't be won by getting excited, and please admit that my practical experience counts for something, just as I have always and still do respect your experience, even when it surprises me.

Dr. Huld's carer was still leant far over the invalid's bed and smoothing out the cloth covering the wall next to it, she merely turned her head and then, in striking contrast with the anger that first stopped K.'s uncle from speaking and then let the words out in a gush, she said very quietly, ""You can see that Dr. Huld is so ill that he can't discuss any matters at all. "" It was probably just for the sake of convenience that she had repeated the words spoken by K.'s uncle, but an onlooker might even have perceived it as mocking him and he, of course, jumped up as if he had just been stabbed. ""You damned ...,"" in the first gurglings of his excitement his words could hardly be understood, K. was startled even though he had been expecting something of the sort and ran to his uncle with the intention, no doubt, of closing his mouth with both his hands. Fortunately, though, behind the girl, the invalid raised himself up, K.'s uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting and then, somewhat calmer, said, ""We have naturally not lost our senses, not yet; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking for it. Now please, go!"" The carer stood up straight by the bed directly facing K.'s uncle, K. thought he noticed that with one hand she was stroking the lawyer's hand. ""You can say anything in front of Leni,"" said the invalid, in a tone that was unmistakably imploring. ""It's not my business,"" said K.'s uncle, ""and it's not my secrets. "" And he twisted himself round as if wanting to go into no more negotiations but giving himself a little more time to think. "" Whose business is it then?"" asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again. ""My nephew's,"" said K.'s uncle, ""and I've brought him along with me. "" And he introduced him, ""Chief Clerk Josef K."" ""Oh!"" said the invalid, now with much more life in him, and reached out his hand towards K. ""Do forgive me, I didn't notice you there at all."" Then he then said to his carer, ""Leni, go,"" stretching his hand out to her as if this were a farewell that would have to last for a long time. This time the girl offered no resistance. "" So you,"" he finally said to K.'s uncle, who had also calmed down and stepped closer, ""you haven't come to visit me because I'm ill but you've come on business. "" The lawyer now looked so much stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was ill had somehow made him weak, he remained supporting himself of one elbow, which must have been rather tiring, and continually pulled at a lock of hair in the middle of his beard."
"Unter den Laternen versuchte K. öfters, so schwer es bei diesem engen Aneinander ausgeführt werden konnte, seine Begleiter deutlicher zu sehen, als es in der Dämmerung seines Zimmers möglich gewesen war. »Vielleicht sind es Tenöre«, dachte er im Anblick ihres schweren Doppelkinns. Er ekelte sich vor der Reinlichkeit ihrer Gesichter. Man sah förmlich noch die säubernde Hand, die in ihre Augenwinkel gefahren, die ihre Oberlippe gerieben, die die Falten am Kinn ausgekratzt hatte.","K. often tried under the lanterns to see his companions more clearly than it had been possible in the twilight of his room, as difficult as it might have been with this close proximity. ""Maybe they're tenors,"" he thought, looking at her heavy double chin. He was disgusted by the cleanliness of their faces. You could literally still see the cleaning hand that went into the corners of her eyes, that rubbed her upper lip, that scratched out the wrinkles on her chin.","Beneath the street lamps K. tried several times, in spite of the difficulty imposed by their tight formation, to see his escorts more clearly than he had in the semidarkness of his room. “Perhaps they’re tenors,” he thought as he regarded their thick double chins.

You could practically still see the cleansing hand that had wiped the corners of their eyes, rubbed their upper lips, scrubbed the folds of their chins.","Under the street lamps K. attempted time and time again, difficult though it was at such very close quarters, to see his companions more clearly than had been possible in the dusk of his room.

One could literally see that the cleansing hand had been at work in the corners of the eyes, rubbing the upper lip, scrubbing out the furrows at the chin. *","Whenever they passed under a lamp K. tried to see his companions more clearly, as far as was possible when they were pressed so close together, as in the dim light of his room this had been hardly possible. “Maybe they're tenors,” he thought as he saw their big double chins.

"Aber der Mann folgte der Aufforderung nicht, sondern hielt die Hände ruhig in den Hosentaschen und lachte laut. »Sehen Sie«, sagte er zu dem Mädchen, »ich habe also doch das Richtige getroffen. Dem Herrn ist nur hier nicht wohl, nicht im allgemeinen.« Das Mädchen lächelte auch, schlug aber dem Mann leicht mit den Fingerspitzen auf den Arm, als hätte er sich mit K. einen zu starken Spaß erlaubt. »Aber was denken Sie denn«, sagte der Mann noch immer lachend, »ich will ja den Herrn wirklich hinausführen.« »Dann ist es gut«, sagte das Mädchen, indem sie ihren zierlichen Kopf für einen Augenblick neigte. »Messen Sie dem Lachen nicht zuviel Bedeutung zu«, sagte das Mädchen zu K., der, wieder traurig geworden, vor sich hinstarrte und keine Erklärung zu brauchen schien, »dieser Herr – ich darf Sie doch vorstellen?« (der Herr gab mit einer Handbewegung die Erlaubnis) »dieser Herr also ist der Auskunftgeber. Er gibt den wartenden Parteien alle Auskunft, die sie brauchen, und da unser Gerichtswesen in der Bevölkerung nicht sehr bekannt ist, werden viele Auskünfte verlangt. Er weiß auf alle Fragen eine Antwort, Sie können ihn, wenn Sie einmal Lust dazu haben, daraufhin erproben. Das ist aber nicht sein einziger Vorzug, sein zweiter Vorzug ist die elegante Kleidung. Wir, das heißt die Beamtenschaft, meinten einmal, man müsse den Auskunftgeber, der immerfort, und zwar als erster, mit Parteien verhandelt, des würdigen ersten Eindrucks halber, auch elegant anziehen. Wir anderen sind, wie Sie gleich an mir sehen können, leider sehr schlecht und altmodisch angezogen; es hat auch nicht viel Sinn, für die Kleidung etwas zu verwenden, da wir fast unaufhörlich in den Kanzleien sind, wir schlafen ja auch hier. Aber, wie gesagt, für den Auskunftgeber hielten wir einmal schöne Kleidung für nötig. Da sie aber von unserer Verwaltung, die in dieser Hinsicht etwas sonderbar ist, nicht erhältlich war, machten wir eine Sammlung – auch Parteien steuerten bei – und wir kauften ihm dieses schöne Kleid und noch andere. Alles wäre jetzt vorbereitet, einen guten Eindruck zu machen, aber durch sein Lachen verdirbt er es wieder und erschreckt die Leute.« »So ist es«, sagte der Herr spöttisch, »aber ich verstehe nicht, Fräulein, warum Sie dem Herrn alle unsere Intimitäten erzählen oder besser, aufdrängen, denn er will sie ja gar nicht erfahren. Sehen Sie nur, wie er, offenbar mit seinen eigenen Angelegenheiten beschäftigt, dasitzt.« K. hatte nicht einmal Lust, zu widersprechen, die Absicht des Mädchens mochte eine gute sein, sie war vielleicht darauf gerichtet, ihn zu zerstreuen oder ihm die Möglichkeit zu geben, sich zu sammeln, aber das Mittel war verfehlt. »Ich mußte ihm Ihr Lachen erklären«, sagte das Mädchen. »Es war ja beleidigend.« »Ich glaube, er würde noch ärgere Beleidigungen verzeihen, wenn ich ihn schließlich hinausführe.« K. sagte nichts, sah nicht einmal auf, er duldete es, daß die zwei über ihn wie über eine Sache verhandelten, es war ihm sogar am liebsten. Aber plötzlich fühlte er die Hand des Auskunftgebers an einem Arm und die Hand des Mädchens am anderen. »Also auf, Sie schwacher Mann«, sagte der Auskunftgeber. »Ich danke Ihnen beiden vielmals«, sagte K., freudig überrascht, erhob sich langsam und führte selbst die fremden Hände an die Stellen, an denen er die Stütze am meisten brauchte. »Es sieht so aus«, sagte das Mädchen leise in K.s Ohr, während sie sich dem Gang näherten, »als ob mir besonders viel daran gelegen wäre, den Auskunftgeber in ein gutes Licht zu stellen, aber man mag es glauben, ich will doch die Wahrheit sagen. Er hat kein hartes Herz. Er ist nicht verpflichtet, kranke Parteien hinauszuführen, und tut es doch, wie Sie sehen. Vielleicht ist niemand von uns hartherzig, wir wollten vielleicht alle gern helfen, aber als Gerichtsbeamte bekommen wir leicht den Anschein, als ob wir hartherzig wären und niemandem helfen wollten. Ich leide geradezu darunter.« »Wollen Sie sich nicht hier ein wenig setzen?« fragte der Auskunftgeber, sie waren schon im Gang und gerade vor dem Angeklagten, den K. früher angesprochen hatte. K. schämte sich fast vor ihm, früher war er so aufrecht vor ihm gestanden, jetzt mußten ihn zwei stützen, seinen Hut balancierte der Auskunftgeber auf den gespreizten Fingern, die Frisur war zerstört, die Haare hingen ihm in die schweißbedeckte Stirn. Aber der Angeklagte schien nichts davon zu bemerken, demütig stand er vor dem Auskunftgeber, der über ihn hinwegsah, und suchte nur seine Anwesenheit zu entschuldigen. »Ich weiß«, sagte er, »daß die Erledigung meiner Anträge heute noch nicht gegeben werden kann. Ich bin aber doch gekommen, ich dachte, ich könnte doch hier warten, es ist Sonntag, ich habe ja Zeit und hier störe ich nicht.« »Sie müssen das nicht so sehr entschuldigen«, sagte der Auskunftgeber, »Ihre Sorgsamkeit ist ja ganz lobenswert, Sie nehmen hier zwar unnötigerweise den Platz weg, aber ich will Sie trotzdem, solange es mir nicht lästig wird, durchaus nicht hindern, den Gang Ihrer Angelegenheit genau zu verfolgen. Wenn man Leute gesehen hat, die ihre Pflicht schändlich vernachlässigten, lernt man es, mit Leuten, wie Sie sind, Geduld zu haben. Setzen Sie sich« »Wie er mit den Parteien zu reden versteht«, flüsterte das Mädchen. K. nickte, fuhr aber gleich auf, als ihn der Auskunftgeber wieder fragte: »Wollen Sie sich nicht hier niedersetzen?« »Nein«, sagte K., ich will mich nicht ausruhen. Er hatte das mit möglichster Bestimmtheit gesagt, in Wirklichkeit hätte es ihm sehr wohlgetan, sich niederzusetzen. Er war wie seekrank. Er glaubte auf einem Schiff zu sein, das sich in schwerem Seegang befand. Es war ihm, als stürze das Wasser gegen die Holzwände, als komme aus der Tiefe des Ganges ein Brausen her, wie von überschlagendem Wasser, als schaukle der Gang in der Quere und als würden die wartenden Parteien zu beiden Seiten gesenkt und gehoben. Desto unbegreiflicher war die Ruhe des Mädchens und des Mannes, die ihn führten. Er war ihnen ausgeliefert, ließen sie ihn los, so mußte er hinfallen wie ein Brett. Aus ihren kleinen Augen gingen scharfe Blicke hin und her, ihre gleichmäßigen Schritte fühlte K., ohne sie mitzumachen, denn er wurde fast von Schritt zu Schritt getragen. Endlich merkte er, daß sie zu ihm sprachen, aber er verstand sie nicht, er hörte nur den Lärm, der alles erfüllte und durch den hindurch ein unveränderlicher hoher Ton, wie von einer Sirene, zu klingen schien. »Lauter«, flüsterte er mit gesenktem Kopf und schämte sich, denn er wußte, daß sie laut genug, wenn auch für ihn unverständlich, gesprochen hatten. Da kam endlich, als wäre die Wand vor ihm durchrissen, ein frischer Luftzug ihm entgegen, und er hörte neben sich sagen: »Zuerst will er weg, dann aber kann man ihm hundertmal sagen, daß hier der Ausgang ist, und er rührt sich nicht.« K. merkte, daß er vor der Ausgangstür stand, die das Mädchen geöffnet hatte. Ihm war, als wären alle seine Kräfte mit einemmal zurückgekehrt, um einen Vorgeschmack der Freiheit zu gewinnen, trat er gleich auf eine Treppenstufe und verabschiedete sich von dort aus von seinen Begleitern, die sich zu ihm hinabbeugten. »Vielen Dank«, wiederholte er, drückte beiden wiederholt die Hände und ließ erst ab, als er zu sehen glaubte, daß sie, an die Kanzleiluft gewöhnt, die verhältnismäßig frische Luft, die von der Treppe kam, schlecht ertrugen. Sie konnten kaum antworten, und das Mädchen wäre vielleicht abgestürzt, wenn nicht K. äußerst schnell die Tür geschlossen hätte. K. stand dann noch einen Augenblick still, strich sich mit Hilfe eines Taschenspiegels das Haar zurecht, hob seinen Hut auf, der auf dem nächsten Treppenabsatz lag – der Auskunftgeber hatte ihn wohl hingeworfen – und lief dann die Treppe hinunter, so frisch und in so langen Sprüngen, daß er vor diesem Umschwung fast Angst bekam. Solche Überraschungen hatte ihm sein sonst ganz gefestigter Gesundheitszustand noch nie bereitet. Wollte etwa sein Körper revolutionieren und ihm einen neuen Prozeß bereiten, da er den alten so mühelos ertrug? Er lehnte den Gedanken nicht ganz ab, bei nächster Gelegenheit zu einem Arzt zu gehen, jedenfalls aber wollte er – darin konnte er sich selbst beraten – alle künftigen Sonntagvormittage besser als diesen verwenden.","But the man didn't follow the request, instead he kept his hands in his pockets and laughed out loud. 'You see,' he said to the girl, 'I hit the spot after all. The gentleman just doesn't feel well here, not in general.' The girl smiled too, but she slapped the man's arm lightly with her fingertips, as if he had played too much fun with K. ""But what do you think,"" said the man, still laughing, ""I really want to take the gentleman out."" ""That's fine then,"" said the girl, bowing her delicate head for a moment. ""Don't attach too much importance to laughing,"" said the girl to K., who, sad again, stared straight ahead and seemed to need no explanation, ""this gentleman - may I introduce you?"" (the gentleman gave permission with a wave of the hand) »So this gentleman is the one who gave the information. He gives the waiting parties all the information they need, and since our judiciary is not very well known among the population, a lot of information is asked for. He knows an answer to all questions, you can try him out if you feel like it. But that is not his only advantage, his second advantage is elegant clothes. We, that is, the civil service, once thought that one should also dress elegantly for the sake of a dignified first impression when providing information, who is always the first to negotiate with parties. Unfortunately, as you can see from me, the rest of us are dressed very poorly and in an old-fashioned way; it doesn't make much sense to use something for clothing either, since we're almost constantly in the offices, we sleep here too. But, as I said, we once thought nice clothes were necessary for the informant. But since it was not available from our administration, which is a bit strange in this respect, we made a collection - parties also contributed - and we bought him this beautiful dress and others. Everything would now be prepared to make a good impression, but he spoils it again with his laughter and frightens people.' Talking about intimacies, or better yet, imposing them, because he doesn't want to experience them at all. Look how he's sitting there, obviously busy with his own business.' K. didn't even feel like arguing, the girl's intention might have been good, it might have been aimed at distracting him or giving him the opportunity give to gather themselves, but the means was in vain. ""I had to explain your laughter to him,"" said the girl. ""It was insulting."" ""I think he would forgive worse insults if I finally took him out."" K. said nothing, didn't even look up, he allowed the two to discuss him as if they were a it was even his favorite. But suddenly he felt the informant's hand on one arm and the girl's hand on the other. ""Come on, you weak man,"" said the informant. ""Thank you both very much,"" said K., happily surprised, slowly getting up and guiding the stranger's hands to the places where he needed support the most. 'It seems,' the girl said softly in K.'s ear as they approached the corridor, 'as if I'd be particularly keen on presenting the information provider in a good light, but believe it or not, I want to tell the truth. He doesn't have a hard heart. He is under no obligation to take sick parties out, and yet, as you see, he does. Perhaps none of us are hard-hearted, we may all want to help, but as court officials, it's easy to appear as if we're hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone. I'm really suffering from it.' 'Wouldn't you like to sit down here for a bit?' asked the informer, they were already in the corridor and right in front of the accused whom K. had spoken to earlier. K. was almost ashamed of him, before he had stood so upright in front of him, now two people had to support him, the informant balanced his hat on his spread fingers, his hairstyle was ruined, his hair hung down on his sweat-covered forehead. But the accused did not seem to notice, he stood humbly in front of the informer, who looked past him, and only tried to excuse his presence. 'I know,' he said, 'that my requests cannot be granted today. But I came anyway, I thought I could wait here, it's Sunday, I've got time and I won't disturb you here."" ""You don't have to excuse that so much,"" said the informant, ""you're very careful commendable, you're taking up space here unnecessarily, but I don't want to prevent you from following the course of your affair closely, as long as it doesn't bother me. When you've seen people shamefully neglecting their duty, you learn to be patient with people like you. Sit down.' 'How he knows how to talk to parties,' whispered the girl. K. nodded, but jumped up when the person providing information asked him again: ""Wouldn't you like to sit down here?"" ""No,"" said K., I don't want to rest. He had said that with as much certainty as possible, actually it would have done him a lot of good to sit down. He was seasick. He thought he was on a ship in rough seas. It seemed to him as if the water were rushing against the wooden walls, as if a roaring came from the depths of the passage, as if from overflowing water, as if the passage were rocking across the street and as if the waiting parties on both sides were being lowered and raised. All the more incomprehensible was the calmness of the girl and the man who were leading him. He was at their mercy, if they let him go he would fall like a plank. Sharp glances darted back and forth from her small eyes, K. felt her steady steps without following them, for he was being carried almost from step to step. At last he became aware that they were speaking to him, but he did not understand them, he only heard the noise that filled everything and through which a constant high-pitched sound, as of a siren, seemed to sound. ""Louder,"" he whispered, head bowed, embarrassed because he knew they had spoken loud enough, if incomprehensible to him. Finally, as if the wall in front of him had been torn through, a fresh draft of air came towards him, and he heard someone say next to him: ""First he wants to leave, but then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the exit, and he doesn't move .' K. noticed that he was standing in front of the exit door which the girl had opened. It was as if all his strength had returned at once, to gain a foretaste of freedom, he immediately stepped onto a step and from there said goodbye to his companions, who bent down to him. ""Thank you very much,"" he repeated, repeatedly shaking hands with both of them and only letting go when he thought he saw that, used to the office air, they couldn't bear the relatively fresh air that came from the stairs. They could hardly answer, and the girl might have fallen if K. hadn't closed the door very quickly. K. then stood still for a moment, straightened his hair with the help of a pocket mirror, picked up his hat that was lying on the next landing – the informant must have thrown it down – and then ran down the stairs, so fresh and in such a good mood long jumps that he was almost afraid of this change. His otherwise very stable state of health had never brought him such surprises. Did his body want to revolutionize and prepare a new process for him, since he endured the old one so effortlessly? He didn't entirely reject the idea of going to a doctor at the earliest opportunity, but in any case – he could advise himself on this – he wanted to make better use of all future Sunday mornings than this.","But the man didn’t follow his suggestion; instead he kept his hands calmly in his pockets and laughed aloud. “You see,” he said to the young woman, “I hit the nail on the head. It’s only here that the gentleman feels unwell, not in general.” The young woman smiled too, but she tapped the man lightly on the arm with her fingertips, as if he’d carried a joke with K. too far. “Oh, don’t worry,” the man said, still laughing, “of course I’ll show the gentleman out.” “All right then,” said the young woman, inclining her charming head for a moment. “Don’t attach too much meaning to his laughter,” the young woman said to K., who had lapsed into dejection again, staring vacantly, and didn’t seem in need of any explanation, “this gentleman—may I introduce you?” (the man gave his permission with a wave of his hand) “—this gentleman is our information officer. He provides waiting parties with any information they may need, and since our judicial system is not very well known among the general population, a great deal of information is requested. He has an answer for every question; you can try him out if you feel like it. But that’s not his only asset, a second is his elegant dress. We—the staff that is—decided that the information officer, who’s always the first person the parties meet and the one they deal with most often, should be dressed elegantly, to create a respectable first impression. The rest of us, sadly enough, are, as you can see in my own case, poorly dressed, in old-fashioned clothes; it doesn’t make much sense to spend anything on clothing, since we’re almost always in the offices, and even sleep here. But as I said, in the information officer’s case we thought fancy clothes were necessary. But since we couldn’t get them from the administration, which is funny about that sort of thing, we took up a collection—the parties pitched in too—and we bought him this handsome suit and a few others as well. So everything was set to make a good impression, but he ruins it by the way he laughs, which startles people.” “So it does,” the man said with an annoyed air, “but I don’t understand, Fräulein, why you’re telling this gentleman all our intimate secrets, or more accurately, forcing them upon him, since he has no interest in knowing them. Just look at him sitting there, obviously immersed in his own affairs.” K. didn’t even feel like objecting; the young woman probably meant well; perhaps she was trying to take his mind off things, or give him a chance to pull himself together, but she’d chosen the wrong method. “I had to explain why you laughed,” the young woman said. “After all, it was insulting.” “I think he’d forgive much worse insults if I would just show him the way out.” K. said nothing, he didn’t even look up; he put up with the fact that the two were discussing him like a case, indeed, he preferred it that way. But suddenly he felt the hand of the information officer on one arm and the hand of the young woman on the other. “Up with you now, you feeble fellow,” said the information officer. “Thank you both very much,” said K. pleasantly surprised, rose slowly, and guided the others’ hands to the places where he most needed their support. “It seems like I’m overly concerned to place the information officer in a good light,” the young woman said softly in K.’s ear, as they approached the hallway, “but believe me, what I say is true. He’s not hard-hearted. It’s not his duty to accompany sick parties out and yet he does, as you can see. Perhaps none of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we’d all like to help, but as court officials it can easily appear that we’re hard-hearted and don’t want to help anyone. That really bothers me.” “Wouldn’t you like to sit here for a bit?” asked the information officer; they were already in the hallway, directly in front of the defendant K. had spoken to earlier. K. was almost ashamed to face him: earlier he had stood so erect before him, while now two people had to hold him up, the information officer balanced his hat on his outspread fingers, and his tousled hair fell across his sweat-covered brow. But the defendant seemed to notice none of this; he stood humbly before the information officer, who stared right past him, and merely attempted to excuse his presence. “I realize there can’t be any response to my petitions today,” he said. “But I came anyway; I thought I could at least wait here, since it’s Sunday, and I have plenty of time and won’t disturb anyone.” “You don’t have to be so apologetic about it,” said the information officer, “your concern is quite praiseworthy; of course you’re taking up space unnecessarily, but as long as it doesn’t begin to annoy me, I certainly won’t hinder you from following the course of your affair in detail. Having seen others who scandalously neglect their duty, one learns to be patient with people like you. You may be seated.” “He really knows how to talk to the parties,” whispered the young woman. K. nodded, but immediately flared up as the information officer asked him again: “Wouldn’t you like to sit down here?” “No,” said K., “I don’t want to rest.” He had said it as firmly as he could, but in reality it would have done him a great deal of good to sit down; he felt seasick. He thought he was on a ship, rolling in heavy seas. It seemed to him that the waters were pounding against the wooden walls, there was a roar from the depths of the hallway like the sound of breaking waves, the hallway seemed to pitch and roll, lifting and lowering the waiting clients on both sides. That made the calm demeanor of the young woman and man who led him even more incomprehensible. He was at their mercy; if they let go of him, he would fall like a plank. Sharp glances shot back and forth from their small eyes; K. felt their steady tread without matching it, for he was practically carried along from step to step. He realized at last that they were speaking to him, but he couldn’t understand them; he heard only the noise that filled everything, through which a steady, high-pitched sound like a siren seemed to emerge. “Louder,” he whispered with bowed head, and was ashamed, for he knew that they had spoken loudly enough, even though he hadn’t understood. Then finally, as if the wall had split open before him, a draft of fresh air reached him, and he heard beside him: “First he wants to leave, then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the exit and he doesn’t move.” K. saw that he was standing at the outer door, which the young woman had opened. Instantly, all his strength seemed to return; to get a foretaste of freedom he stepped down immediately onto the first step and from there took leave of his escorts, who bowed to him. “Thank you very much,” he said again, shaking hands with both of them repeatedly, stopping only when he thought he noticed that they were unable to bear the comparatively fresh air from the stairway, accustomed as they were to the air in the offices of the court. They could hardly reply, and the young woman might have fallen had K. not shut the door as quickly as possible. K. stood quietly for a moment, smoothed his hair into place with the help of a pocket mirror, picked up his hat, which was lying on the landing below—the information officer must have tossed it there—and then raced down the steps with such long, energetic leaps that he was almost frightened by the sudden change. His normally sound constitution had never provided him with such surprises before. Was his body going to rebel and offer him a new trial, since he was handling the old one so easily? He didn’t entirely rule out the thought of consulting a doctor at the first opportunity; in any case—and here he could advise himself—he would spend his Sunday mornings more profitably than this from now on.","Yet the man did not respond to his request but kept his hands quietly in his pockets and laughed. ""You see,"" he said to the girl. ""I hit the nail on the head. It's only here that this gentleman feels upset, not in other places. "" The girl smiled too, but tapped the man lightly on the arm with her finger tips, as if he had gone too far in jesting like that with K. ""But dear me,"" said the man, still laughing, ""I'll show the gentleman to the door, of course I will !"" ""Then that's all right,"" said the girl, inclining her elegant head for a moment. ""Don't take his laughter too much to heart,"" she said to K., who had sunk again into vacant melancholy and apparently expected no explanation. "" This gentleman -- may I introduce you?"" (the gentleman waved his hand to indicate permission) ""this gentleman, then, represents our Information Bureau. He gives clients all the information they need, and as our procedure is not very well known among the populace, a great deal of information is asked for. He has an answer to every question, if you ever feel like it you can try him out. But that isn't his only claim to distinction, he has another, the smartness of his clothes. We -- that's to say the staff -- made up our minds that the Clerk of Inquiries, since he's always dealing with clients and is the first to see them, must be smartly dressed so as to create a good first impression. The rest of us, as you must have noticed at once from myself, are very badly and old-fashionedly dressed, I'm sorry to say; there isn't much sense anyhow in spending money on clothes, for we're hardly ever out of these offices, we even sleep here. But, as I say, we considered that in his case good clothes were needed. And as the management, which in this respect is somewhat peculiar, refused to provide these clothes, we opened a subscription -- some of the clients contributed too -- and we bought him this fine suit and some others as well. Nothing more would be needed now to produce a good impression, but he spoils it all again by his laughter which puts people off."" ""That's how it is,"" said the gentleman ironically, ""yet I don't understand, Fräulein, why you should tell this gentleman all our intimate secrets, or rather thrust them on him, for he doesn't want to hear them at all. Just look at him, he's obviously much too busy with his own thoughts."" K. felt no inclination even to make a retort, the girl's intentions were no doubt good, probably she merely wanted to distract him or give him chance to pull himself together, but she had not gone the right way about it. "" Well, I needed to explain your laughter to him,"" the girl said. ""It sounded insulting."" ""I fancy he would overlook much worse insults if I would on1y take him out of here."" K. said nothing, he did not even look up, he suffered the two of them to discuss him as if he were an inanimate object, indeed he actually preferred that. Then suddenly he felt the man's hand under one arm and the girl's hand under the other. ""Up you get, you feeble fellow,"" said the man. "" Many thanks to both of you,"" said K., joyfully surprised, and he got up slowly and himself moved these strangers' hands to the places where he felt most in need of support. ""It must seem to you,"" said the girl softly in K.'s ear as they neared the passage, ""as if I were greatly concerned to show the Clerk of Inquiries in a good light, but you can believe me, I only wanted to speak the truth about him. He isn't a hard-hearted man. He isn't obliged to help sick people out of here, and yet he does so, as you can see. Perhaps none of us is hardhearted, we should be glad to help everybody, yet as Law Court officials we easily take on the appearance of being hardhearted and of not wishing to help. That really worries me."" ""Wouldn't you like to sit down here for a little? "" asked the Clerk of Inquiries; they were out in the main lobby now and just opposite the client to whom K. had first spoken. K. felt almost ashamed before the man, he had stood so erect before him the first time; now it took a couple of people to hold him up, the Clerk of Inquiries was balancing his hat on the tips of his fingers, his hair was in disorder and hung down over his sweat-drenched forehead. But the client seemed to see nothing of all this, he stood up humbly before the Clerk of Inquiries (who stared through him) and merely sought to excuse his presence. ""I know,"" he said, ""that the decision on my affidavits cannot be expected today. But I came all the same, I thought that I might as well wait here, it is Sunday, I have lots of time and here I disturb nobody."" ""You needn't be so apologetic,"" replied the Clerk of Inquiries. ""Your solicitude is entirely to be commended; you're taking up extra room, here, I admit, but so long as you don't inconvenience me, I shan't hinder you at all from following the progress of your case as closely as you please. When one sees so many people who scandalously neglect their duty, one learns to have patience with men like you. You may sit down."" ""How well he knows how to talk to clients !"" whispered the girl. K. nodded, but immediately gave a violent start when the Clerk of Inquiries asked again: ""Wouldn't you like to sit down here?"" ""No,"" said K. ""I don't want a rest."" He said this with the utmost possible decision, though in reality he would have been very glad to sit down. He felt as if he were seasick. He felt he was on a ship rolling in heavy seas. It was as if the waters were dashing against the wooden walls, as if the roaring of breaking waves came from the end of the passage, as if the passage itself pitched and rolled and the waiting clients on either side rose and fell with it. All the more incomprehensible, therefore, was the composure of the girl and the man who were escorting him. He was delivered into their hands, if they let him go he must fall like a block of wood. They kept glancing around with their sharp little eyes, K. was aware of their regular advance without himself taking part in it, for he was now being almost carried from step to step. At last he noticed that they were talking to him, but he could not make out what they were saying, he heard nothing but the din that filled the whole place, through which a shrill unchanging note like that of a siren seemed to ring. "" Louder,"" he whispered with bowed head, and he was ashamed, for he knew that they were speaking loudly enough, though he could not make out what they said. Then, as if the wall in front of him had been split in two, a current of fresh air was at last wafted toward him, and he heard a voice near him saying: ""First he wants to go , then you tell him a hundred times that the door is in front of him and he makes no move to go."" K. saw that he was standing before the outside door, which the girl had opened. It was as if all his energies returned at one bound, to get a foretaste of freedom he set his feet at once on a step of the staircase and from there said good-by to his conductors, who bent their heads down to hear him. "" Many thanks,"" he said several times, then shook hands with them again and again and only left off when he thought he saw that they, accustomed as they were to the office air, felt ill in the relatively fresh air that came up the stairway. They could scarcely answer him and the girl might have fallen if K. had not shut the door with the utmost haste. K. stood still for a moment, put his hair to rights with the help of his pocket mirror, lifted up his hat, which lay on the step below him -- the Clerk of Inquiries must have thrown it there -- and then leapt down the stairs so buoyantly and with such long strides that he became almost afraid of his own reaction. His usually sound constitution had never provided him with such surprises before. Could his body possibly be meditating a revolution and preparing a new trial for him, since he was withstanding the old one with such ease? He did not entirely reject the idea of going to consult a doctor at the first opportunity, in any case he had made up his mind -- and there he could advise himself -- to spend all his Sunday mornings in future to better purpose.","The man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood there with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud. “There, you see,” he said to the girl, “I was quite right. The gentleman is only unwell here, and not in general.” The young woman smiled too, but lightly tapped the man's arm with the tips of her fingers as if he had allowed himself too much fun with K. “So what do you think, then?” said the man, still laughing, “I really do want to lead the gentleman out of here.” “That's alright, then,” said the girl, briefly inclining her charming head. “Don't worry too much about him laughing,” said the girl to K., who had become unhappy once more and stared quietly in front of himself as if needing no further explanation. “This gentleman—may I introduce you?”—(the man gave his permission with a wave of the hand) —“so, this gentleman's job is to give out information. He gives all the information they need to people who are waiting, as our court and its offices are not very well known among the public he gets asked for quite a lot. He has an answer for every question, you can try him out if you feel like it. But that's not his only distinction, his other distinction is his elegance of dress. We, that's to say all of us who work in the offices here, we decided that the information-giver would have to be elegantly dressed as he continually has to deal with the litigants and he's the first one they meet, so he needs to give a dignified first impression. The rest of us I'm afraid, as you can see just by looking at me, dress very badly and old-fashioned; and there's not much point in spending much on clothes anyway, as we hardly ever leave the offices, we even sleep here. But, as I said, we decided that the information-giver would have to have nice clothes. As the management here is rather peculiar in this respect, and they would get them for us, we had a collection—some of the litigants contributed too —and bought him these lovely clothes and some others besides. So everything would be ready for him to give a good impression, except that he spoils it again by laughing and frightening people.” “That's how it is,” said the man, mocking her, “but I don't understand why it is that you're explaining all our intimate facts to the gentleman, or rather why it is that you're pressing them on him, as I'm sure he's not all interested. Just look at him sitting there, it's clear he's occupied with his own affairs.” K. just did not feel like contradicting him.. The girl's intention may have been good, perhaps she was under instructions to distract him or to give him the chance to collect himself, but the attempt had not worked. “I had to explain to him why you were laughing,” said the girl. “I suppose it was insulting.” “I think he would forgive even worse insults if I finally took him outside.” K. said nothing, did not even look up, he tolerated the two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was even what suited him best. But suddenly he felt the information-giver's hand on one arm and the young woman's hand on the other. “Up you get then, weakling,” said the information-giver. “Thank you both very much,” said K., pleasantly surprised, as he slowly rose and personally guided these unfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support. As they approached the corridor, the girl said quietly into K.'s ear, “I must seem to think it's very important to show the information-giver in a good light, but you shouldn't doubt what I say, I just want to say the truth. He isn't hard-hearted. It's not really his job to help litigants outside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you can see. I don't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all like to be helpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us to give the impression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone. It makes me quite sad.” “Would you not like to sit down here a while?” asked the information-giver, there were already in the corridor and just in front of the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier. K. felt almost ashamed to be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front of him and now he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up by the information-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair was dishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead. But the defendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood there humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver for being there. The information-giver looked past him. “I know,” he said, “that my case can't be settled today, not yet, but I've come in anyway , I thought, I thought I could wait here anyway , it's Sunday today, I've got plenty of time, and I'm not disturbing anyone here.” “There's no need to be so apologetic,” said the information-giver, “it's very commendable for you to be so attentive. You are taking up space here when you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will do nothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as you like. When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their cases one learns to show patience with people like you. Do sit down.” “He's very good with the litigants,” whispered the girl. K. nodded, but started to move off again when the information-giver repeated, “Would you not like to sit down here a while?” “No, “said K., “I don't want to rest.” He had said that with as decisively as he could, but in fact it would have done him a lot of good to sit down. It was as if he were suffering sea-sickness. He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea, as if the water were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering from the depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, as if the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of it rising and sinking. It made the calmness of the girl and the man leading him all the more incomprehensible. He was at their mercy, if they let go of him he would fall like a board. Their little eyes glanced here and there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but could not do the same, as from step to step he was virtually being carried. He finally noticed they were speaking to him but he did not understand them, all he heard was a noise that filled all the space and through which there seemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding, like a siren. “Louder,” he whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed at having to ask them to speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly enough, even if it had been, for him, incomprehensible. At last, a draught of cool air blew in his face as if a gap had been torn out in the wall in front of him, and next to him he heard someone say, “First he says he wants to go, and then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the way out and he doesn't move.” K. became aware that he was standing in front of the way out, and that the young woman had opened the door. It seemed to him that all his strength returned to him at once, and to get a foretaste of freedom he stepped straight on to one of the stairs and took his leave there of his companions, who bowed to him. “Thank you very much,” he repeated, shook their hands once more and did not let go until he thought he saw that they found it hard to bear the comparatively fresh air from the stairway after being so long used to the air in the offices. They were hardly able to reply, and the young woman might even have fallen over if K. had not shut the door extremely fast. K. then stood still for a while, combed his hair with the help of a pocket mirror, picked up his hat from the next stair—the information-giver must have thrown it down there—and then he ran down the steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with his previous state nearly frightened him. His normally sturdy state of health had never prepared him for surprises such as this. Did his body want to revolt and cause him a new trial as he was bearing the old one with such little effort? He did not quite reject the idea that he should see a doctor the next time he had the chance, but whatever he did—and this was something on which he could advise himself —he wanted to spend all Sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one.","The man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood there with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud.

"Nachdem er auf diese Weise die Bedenken gegen die Frau beseitigt hatte, wurde ihm das leise Zwiegespräch am Fenster zu lang, er klopfte mit den Knöcheln auf das Podium und dann auch mit der Faust. Der Student sah kurz über die Schulter der Frau hinweg nach K. hin, ließ sich aber nicht stören, ja drückte sich sogar eng an die Frau und umfaßte sie. Sie senkte tief den Kopf, als höre sie ihm aufmerksam zu, er küßte sie, als sie sich bückte, laut auf den Hals, ohne sich im Reden wesentlich zu unterbrechen. K. sah darin die Tyrannei bestätigt, die der Student nach den klagen der Frau über sie ausübte, stand auf und ging im Zimmer auf und ab. Er überlegte unter Seitenblicken nach dem Studenten, wie er ihn möglichst schnell wegschaffen könnte, und es war ihm daher nicht unwillkommen, als der Student, offenbar gestört durch K.s Herumgehen, das schon zeitweilig zu einem Trampeln ausgeartet war, bemerkte: »Wenn Sie ungeduldig sind, können Sie weggehen. Sie hätten auch schon früher weggehen können, es hätte Sie niemand vermißt. Ja, Sie hätten sogar weggehen sollen, und zwar schon bei meinem Eintritt, und zwar schleunigst.« Es mochte in dieser Bemerkung alle mögliche Wut zum Ausdruck kommen, jedenfalls lag darin aber auch der Hochmut des künftigen Gerichtsbeamten, der zu einem mißliebigen Angeklagten sprach. K. blieb ganz nahe bei ihm stehen und sagte lächelnd: »Ich bin ungeduldig, das ist richtig, aber diese Ungeduld wird am leichtesten dadurch zu beseitigen sein, daß Sie uns verlassen. Wenn Sie aber vielleicht hergekommen sind, um zu studieren – ich hörte, daß Sie Student sind –, so will ich Ihnen gerne Platz machen und mit der Frau weggehen. Sie werden übrigens noch viel studieren müssen, ehe Sie Richter werden. Ich kenne zwar Ihr Gerichtswesen noch nicht sehr genau, nehme aber an, daß es mit groben Reden allein, die Sie allerdings schon unverschämt gut zu führen wissen, noch lange nicht getan ist.« »Man hätte ihn nicht so frei herumlaufen lassen sollen«, sagte der Student, als wolle er der Frau eine Erklärung für K.s beleidigende Rede geben, »es war ein Mißgriff. Ich habe es dem Untersuchungsrichter gesagt. Man hätte ihn zwischen den Verhören zumindest in seinem Zimmer halten sollen. Der Untersuchungsrichter ist manchmal unbegreiflich.« »Unnütze Reden«, sagte K. und streckte die Hand nach der Frau aus, »kommen Sie.« »Ach so«, sagte der Student, »nein, nein, die bekommen Sie nicht«, und mit einer Kraft, die man ihm nicht zugetraut hätte, hob er sie auf einen Arm und lief mit gebeugtem Rücken, zärtlich zu ihr aufsehend, zur Tür. Eine gewisse Angst vor K. war hierbei nicht zu verkennen, trotzdem wagte er es, K. noch zu reizen, indem er mit der freien Hand den Arm der Frau streichelte und drückte. K. lief ein paar Schritte neben ihm her, bereit, ihn zu fassen und, wenn es sein mußte, zu würgen, da sagte die Frau: »Es hilft nichts, der Untersuchungsrichter läßt mich holen, ich darf nicht mit Ihnen gehen, dieses kleine Scheusal«, sie fuhr hierbei dem Studenten mit der Hand übers Gesicht, »dieses kleine Scheusal läßt mich nicht.« »Und Sie wollen nicht befreit werden!« schrie K. und legte die Hand auf die Schulter des Studenten, der mit den Zähnen nach ihr schnappte. »Nein!« rief die Frau und wehrte K. mit beiden Händen ab, »nein, nein, nur das nicht, woran denken Sie denn! Das wäre mein Verderben. Lassen Sie ihn doch, o bitte, lassen Sie ihn doch. Er führt ja nur den Befehl des Untersuchungsrichters aus und trägt mich zu ihm.« »Dann mag er laufen und Sie will ich nie mehr sehen«, sagte K. wütend vor Enttäuschung und gab dem Studenten einen Stoß in den Rücken, daß er kurz stolperte, um gleich darauf, vor Vergnügen darüber, daß er nicht gefallen war, mit seiner Last desto höher zu springen. K. ging ihnen langsam nach, er sah ein, daß das die erste zweifellose Niederlage war, die er von diesen Leuten erfahren hatte. Es war natürlich kein Grund, sich deshalb zu ängstigen, er erhielt die Niederlage nur deshalb, weil er den Kampf aufsuchte. Wenn er zu Hause bliebe und sein gewohntes Leben führte, war er jedem dieser Leute tausendfach überlegen und konnte jeden mit einem Fußtritt von seinem Wege räumen. Und er stellte sich die allerlächerlichste Szene vor, die es zum Beispiel geben würde, wenn dieser klägliche Student, dieses aufgeblasene Kind, dieser krumme Bartträger vor Elsas Bett knien und mit gefalteten Händen um Gnade bitten würde. K. gefiel diese Vorstellung so, daß er beschloß, wenn sich nur irgendeine Gelegenheit dafür ergeben sollte, den Studenten einmal zu Elsa mitzunehmen.","After he had allayed his misgivings about the woman in this way, the quiet conversation at the window became too long for him. He banged his knuckles on the podium and then also his fist. The student glanced at K. over the woman's shoulder, but didn't let himself be disturbed, in fact he pressed himself close to the woman and embraced her. She bowed her head low, as if she were listening to him attentively, he kissed her loudly on the neck when she bent down, without really stopping to speak. K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the student was exercising over her, according to the woman's complaints, and got up and paced up and down the room. Looking sideways at the student, he was thinking about how to get him away as quickly as possible, and he was therefore not unwelcome when the student, obviously disturbed by K.'s walking around, which had at times degenerated into trampling, remarked: ""If you're impatient , you can go away. You could have left earlier, nobody would have missed you. In fact, you should have left as soon as I came in, and hurriedly.” There might be all sorts of anger in that remark, but it was also the arrogance of the future magistrate speaking to an unpopular accused. K. stopped very close to him and said with a smile: 'I'm impatient, that's true, but the easiest way to get rid of this impatience is for you to leave us. But if you've come here to study - I heard you're a student - I'd be happy to make room for you and go away with the wife. Incidentally, you will still have to study a great deal before you become a judge. I don't know your judiciary very well, but I assume that rude speeches alone, which you are indecently good at using, are far from enough."" ""He shouldn't have been allowed to roam around so freely,"" said the student, as if he wanted to give the woman an explanation for K.'s insulting speech, ""It was a mistake. I told the coroner. He should have at least been kept in his room between interrogations. The examining judge is sometimes incomprehensible.' 'Useless talking,' said K. and stretched out his hand to the woman, 'come on.' with a strength that one would not have credited him with, he lifted her up in one arm and, bending his back, ran towards the door, looking up at her tenderly. A certain fear of K. was unmistakable, but he still dared to tease K. by stroking and squeezing the woman's arm with his free hand. K. walked a few steps beside him, ready to grab him and choke him if he had to, when the woman said: ""It doesn't help, the examining magistrate sent for me, I'm not allowed to go with you, little one Beast,' she passed her hand over the student's face, 'this little beast won't let me.' 'And you don't want to be freed!' yelled K. and put his hand on the student's shoulder, the one with his teeth you snapped. “No!” cried the woman and shoved off K. with both hands, “no, no, just not that, what are you thinking about! That would be my undoing. Let him, oh please, let him. He's just carrying out the examining magistrate's orders and carrying me to him.' 'Then he can run and I never want to see you again,' said K. furious with disappointment and gave the student a shove in the back, causing him to stumble briefly , and immediately afterwards, delighted that he had not fallen, jumped the higher with his load. K. slowly followed them, realizing that this was the first undoubted defeat he had experienced from these people. Of course, there was no reason to worry about it, he was defeated only because he went to fight. If he stayed at home and lived his usual life, he was a thousand times superior to any of these people and could kick anyone out of his way. And he imagined the most ridiculous scene that would occur, for example, when this pathetic student, this pompous child, this crooked bearded man kneeled before Elsa's bed and folded his hands begging for mercy. K. liked this idea so much that he decided, if the opportunity arose, to take the student to Elsa's.","Once he had overcome his doubts about the woman in this way, the low conversation at the window grew too long for him, and he rapped on the platform with his knuckle, then with his fist. The student glanced briefly at K. over the woman’s shoulder, but continued undisturbed; in fact he drew even closer to the woman and put his arms around her. She lowered her head as if she were listening closely to him, and he kissed her loudly on the neck as she leaned over, not even really interrupting what he was saying. Seeing in this a confirmation of the tyranny the student exercised over the woman, as she had complained, K. rose and paced up and down the room. Glancing sideways toward the student, he contemplated the quickest way to get rid of him, and so he was happy enough when the student, apparently disturbed by K.’s pacing, which had meanwhile degenerated into full-blown tromping, remarked: “If you’re impatient, why don’t you leave? You could have left even earlier, no one would have missed you. In fact you should have left the moment I arrived, and as quickly as possible.” This remark may have been an outburst of utmost anger, but it contained as well the arrogance of a future court official speaking to an unpopular defendant. K. paused quite close to him and said with a smile: “I’m impatient, that’s true, but the easiest way to alleviate my impatience is for you to leave. But if by chance you came here to study—I hear you’re a student—I’ll gladly leave you to yourself and go off with this woman. By the way, you have a lot more studying to do before you can become a judge. I don’t really know much about your judicial system yet, but I take it that crass language alone, of the sort you’re certainly shamelessly good at already, is hardly sufficient.” “They shouldn’t have allowed him to run around so freely,” said the student, as if offering the woman an explanation for K.’s insulting remarks, “it was a mistake. I told the examining magistrate so. He should at least have been confined to his room between interrogations. Sometimes I just don’t understand the examining magistrate.” “You’re wasting your breath,” said K., stretching out his hand toward the woman. “Come on.” “Aha,” said the student, “no, no, you’re not going to get her,” and with a strength one wouldn’t have expected, he lifted her in one arm and ran to the door, his back bent, gazing up at her tenderly. A certain fear of K. was unmistakable in his action, yet he dared to provoke K. even further by stroking and squeezing the woman’s arm with his free hand. K. ran along beside him a few steps, ready to grab him, and if necessary to throttle him, when the woman said: “It’s no use, the examining magistrate has sent for me, I can’t go with you, this little monster,” she said, stroking the student’s face, “this little monster won’t let me go.” “And you don’t want to be freed,” yelled K., placing his hand on the shoulder of the student, who snapped at it with his teeth. “No,” the woman cried out, and pushed K. away with both hands, “no, no, don’t do that , what do you think you’re doing! I’ll be ruined. Let go of him, oh please, let go of him. He’s just following the examining magistrate’s orders and carrying me to him.” “Then let him go, and I hope I never see you again,” said K. in enraged disappointment, and shoved the student in the back so sharply that he stumbled for a moment, only to leap higher into the air with his burden in joy at not having fallen. K. followed them slowly; he realized that this was the first clear defeat he had suffered at the hands of these people. Of course there was no reason to let that worry him, he had suffered defeat only because he had sought to do battle. If he stayed home and led his normal life he was infinitely superior to any of these people, and could kick any one of them out of his path. And he pictured how funny it would be, for example, to see this miserable student, this puffed-up child, this bandy-legged, bearded fellow, kneeling at Elsa’s bedside, clutching his hands and begging for mercy. This vision pleased K. so greatly that he decided, if the opportunity ever arose, to take the student along to Elsa one day.","After arguing himself in this way out of his suspicions, he began to feel that the whispered conversation in the window was going on too long, and started knocking on the table with his knuckles and then with his fist. The student glanced briefly at K. across the woman's shoulder, but did not let himself be put out, indeed moved closer to her and put his arms around her. She drooped her head as if attentively listening to him, and as she did so he kissed her loudly on the throat without at all interrupting his remarks. In this action K. saw confirmed the tyranny which the student exercised over the woman, as she had complained, and he sprang to his feet and began to pace up and down the room. With occasional side-glances at the student he meditated how to get rid of him as quickly as possible, and so it was not unwelcome to him when the fellow, obviously annoyed by his walking up and down, which had turned by now into an angry trampling, said: ""If you're so impatient, you can go away. There was nothing to hinder your going long ago, nobody would have missed you. In fact, it was your duty to go away, and as soon as I came in too, and as fast as your legs could carry you. "" There was intense rage in these words, but there was also the insolence of a future official of the Court addressing a displeasing prisoner. K. stepped up quite close to the student and said with a smile: ""I am impatient, that is true, but the easiest way to relieve my impatience would be for you to leave us. Yet if by any chance you have come here to study -- I hear that you're a student -- I'll gladly vacate the room and go away with this woman. I fancy you've a long way to go yet in your studies before you can become a Judge. I admit I'm not very well versed in the niceties of your legal training, but I assume that it doesn't consist exclusively in learning to make rude remarks, at which you seem to have attained a shameless proficiency."" ""He shouldn't have been allowed to run around at large,"" said the student, as if seeking to explain K.'s insulting words to the woman. ""It was a mistake, I told the Examining Magistrate that. He should at least have been confined to his room between the interrogations. There are times when I simply don't understand the Examining Magistrate."" * ""What's the use of talking?"" said K., stretching out his hand to the woman. ""Come along."" ""Ah, that's it,"" said the student, ""no, no, you don't get her,"" and with a strength which one would not have believed him capable of he lifted her in one arm and, gazing up at her tenderly, ran, stooping a little beneath his burden, to the door. A certain fear of K. was unmistakable in this action, and yet he risked infuriating K. further by caressing and clasping the woman's arm with his free hand. K. ran a few steps after him, ready to seize and if necessary to throttle him, when the woman said: ""It's no use, the Examining Magistrate has sent for me, I daren't go with you; this little monster,"" she patted the student's face, ""this little monster won't let me go."" ""And you don't want to be set free,"" cried K., laying his hand on the shoulder of the student, who snapped at it with his teeth. "" No,"" cried the woman, pushing K. away with both hands. ""No, no, you mustn't do that, what are you thinking of? It would be the ruin of me. Let him alone, oh, please let him alone! He's only obeying the orders of the Examining Magistrate and carrying me to him."" ""Then let him go, and as for you, I never want to see you again,"" said K., furious with disappointment, and he gave the student a punch in the back that made him stumble for a moment, only to spring off more nimbly than ever out of relief that he had not fallen. K. slowly walked after them, he recognized that this was the first unequivocal defeat that he had received from these people. There was no reason, of course, for him to worry about that, he had received the defeat only because he had insisted on giving battle. While he stayed quietly at home and went about his ordinary vocations he remained superior to all these people and could kick any of them out of his path. And he pictured to himself the highly comic situation which would arise if, for instance, this wretched student, this puffed-up whippersnapper, this bandy-legged beaver, had to kneel by Elsa's bed some day wringing his hands and begging for favors. This picture pleased K. so much that he decided, if ever the opportunity came, to take the student along to visit Elsa.","Once he had settled his thoughts towards the woman in this way, he began to find the quiet conversation at the window was taking too long, he rapped on the podium with his knuckles, and then even with his fist. The student briefly looked away from the woman to glance at K. over his shoulder but did allow himself to be disturbed, in fact he even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around her. She dropped her head down low as if listening to him carefully, as she did so he kissed her right on the neck, hardly even interrupting what he was saying. K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which she had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down the room. Glancing sideways at the student, he wondered what would be the quickest possible way to get rid of him, and so it was not unwelcome to him when the student, clearly disturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing which K. had now developed into a stamping up and down, said to him, “You don't have to stay here, you know, if you're getting impatient. You could have gone earlier, no-one would have missed you. In fact you should have gone, you should have left as quickly as possible as soon as I got here.” This comment could have caused all possible rage to break out between them, but K. also bore in mind that this was a prospective court official speaking to a disfavoured defendant, and he might well have been taking pride in speaking in this way. K. remained standing quite close to him and said with a smile, “You're quite right, I am impatient, but the easiest way to settle this impatience would be if you left us. On the other hand, if you've come here to study—you are a student, I hear —I'll be quite happy to leave the room to you and go away with the woman. I'm sure you'll still have a lot of study to do before you're made into a judge. It's true that I'm still not all that familiar with your branch of jurisprudence but I take it it involves a lot more than speaking roughly— and I see you have no shame in doing that extremely well.” “He shouldn't have been allowed to move about so freely,” said the student, as if he wanted to give the woman an explanation for K.'s insults, “that was a mistake. I've told the examining judge so. He should at least have been detained in his room between hearings. Sometimes it's impossible to understand what the judge thinks he's doing.” “You're wasting your breath,” said K., then he reached his hand out towards the woman and said, “come with me.” “So that's it,” said the student, “oh no, you're not going to get her,” and with a strength you would not have expected from him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her up on one arm and, his back bent under the weight, ran with her to the door. In this way he showed, unmistakeably, that he was to some extent afraid of K., but he nonetheless dared to provoke him still further by stroking and squeezing the woman's arm with his free hand. K. ran the few steps up to him, but when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and, if necessary, throttle him, the woman said, “It's no good, it's the examining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you, this little bastard... “ and here she ran her hand over the student's face, “this little bastard won't let me.” “And you don't want to be set free!” shouted K., laying his hand on the student's shoulder, who then snapped at it with his teeth. “No!” shouted the woman, pushing K. away with both hands, “no, no don't do that , what d'you think you're doing!? That'd be the end of me. Let go of him, please just let go of him. He's only carrying out the judge's orders, he's carrying me to him.” “Let him take you then, and I want to see nothing more of you,” said K., enraged by his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the back so that he briefly stumbled and then, glad that he had not fallen, immediately jumped up all the higher with his burden. K. followed them slowly. He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had suffered from these people. It was of course nothing to worry about, he accepted the setback only because he was looking for a fight. If he stayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be a thousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out of his way just with a kick. And he imagined the most laughable scene possible as an example of this, if this contemptible student, this inflated child, this knock-kneed redbeard, if he were kneeling at Elsa's bed wringing his hands and begging for forgiveness. K. so enjoyed imagining this scene that he decided to take the student along to Elsa with him if ever he should get the opportunity.","Once he had settled his thoughts towards the woman in this way, he began to find the quiet conversation at the window was taking too long, he rapped on the podium with his knuckles, and then even with his fist.

"Die linke Saalhälfte war aber noch immer still, die Leute standen dort in Reihen, hatten ihre Gesichter dem Podium zugewendet und hörten den Worten, die oben gewechselt wurden, ebenso ruhig zu wie dem Lärm der anderen Partei, sie duldeten sogar, daß einzelne aus ihren Reihen mit der anderen Partei hie und da gemeinsam vorgingen. Die Leute der linken Partei, die übrigens weniger zahlreich waren, mochten im Grunde ebenso unbedeutend sein wie die der rechten Partei, aber die Ruhe ihres Verhaltens ließ sie bedeutungsvoller erscheinen. Als K. jetzt zu reden begann, war er überzeugt, in ihrem Sinne zu sprechen.","But the left half of the hall was still quiet, the people were standing there in rows, their faces turned to the podium and listening to the words that were being exchanged above as calmly as they were to the noise of the other party, they even tolerated that individuals from their ranks with the other party here and there in concert. The people of the left party, who were fewer in number, might actually be as insignificant as those of the right party, but the calmness of their demeanor made them seem more significant.

These people of the Left party, who were not so numerous as the others, might in reality be just as unimportant, but the composure of their bearing made them appear of more consequence.

Erstes Kapitel,First chapter,,Chapter 1,Chapter One.,Chapter One Arrest - Conversation with Mrs. Grubach - Then Miss Bürstner
"Gleich nach der Begrüßung – sich in den Fauteuil zu setzen, wozu ihn K. einlud, hatte er keine Zeit – bat er K. um ein kurzes Gespräch unter vier Augen. »Es ist notwendig«, sagte er, mühselig schluckend, »zu meiner Beruhigung ist es notwendig.« K. schickte sofort die Diener aus dem Zimmer, mit der Weisung, niemand einzulassen. »Was habe ich gehört, Josef?« rief der Onkel, als sie allein waren, setzte sich auf den Tisch und stopfte unter sich, ohne hinzusehen, verschiedene Papiere, um besser zu sitzen. K. schwieg, er wußte, was kommen würde, aber, plötzlich von der anstrengenden Arbeit entspannt, wie er war, gab er sich zunächst einer angenehmen Mattigkeit hin und sah durch das Fenster auf die gegenüberliegende Straßenseite, von der von seinem Sitz aus nur ein kleiner, dreieckiger Ausschnitt zu sehen war, ein Stück leerer Häusermauer zwischen zwei Geschäftsauslagen. »Du schaust aus dem Fenster!« rief der Onkel mit erhobenen Armen, »um Himmels willen, Josef, antworte mir doch! Ist es wahr, kann es denn wahr sein?« »Lieber Onkel«, sagte K. und riß sich von seiner Zerstreutheit los, »ich weiß ja gar nicht, was du von mir willst.« »Josef«, sagte der Onkel warnend, »die Wahrheit hast du immer gesagt, soviel ich weiß. Soll ich deine letzten Worte als schlimmes Zeichen auffassen?« »Ich ahne ja, was du willst«, sagte K. folgsam, »du hast wahrscheinlich von meinem Prozeß gehört.« »So ist es«, antwortete der Onkel, langsam nickend, »ich habe von deinem Prozeß gehört.« »Von wem denn?« fragte K. »Erna hat es mir geschrieben«, sagte der Onkel, »sie hat ja keinen Verkehr mit dir, du kümmerst dich leider nicht viel um sie, trotzdem hat sie es erfahren. Heute habe ich den Brief bekommen und bin natürlich sofort hergefahren. Aus keinem anderen Grund, aber es scheint ein genügender Grund zu sein. Ich kann dir die Briefstelle, die dich betrifft, vorlesen.« Er zog den Brief aus der Brieftasche. »Hier ist es.« Sie schreibt: »Josef habe ich schon lange nicht gesehen, vorige Woche war ich einmal in der Bank, aber Josef war so beschäftigt, daß ich nicht vorgelassen wurde; ich habe fast eine Stunde gewartet, mußte dann aber nach Hause, weil ich Klavierstunde hatte. Ich hätte gern mit ihm gesprochen, vielleicht wird sich nächstens eine Gelegenheit finden. Zu meinem Namenstag hat er mir eine große Schachtel Schokolade geschickt, es war sehr lieb und aufmerksam. Ich hatte vergessen, es Euch damals zu schreiben, erst jetzt, da Ihr mich fragt, erinnere ich mich daran. Schokolade, müßt Ihr wissen, verschwindet nämlich in der Pension sofort, kaum ist man zum Bewußtsein dessen gekommen, daß man mit Schokolade beschenkt worden ist, ist sie auch schon weg. Aber was Josef betrifft, wollte ich Euch noch etwas sagen. Wie erwähnt, wurde ich in der Bank nicht zu ihm vorgelassen, weil er gerade mit einem Herrn verhandelte. Nachdem ich eine Zeitlang ruhig gewartet hatte, fragte ich einen Diener, ob die Verhandlung noch lange dauern werde. Er sagte, das dürfte wohl sein, denn es handle sich wahrscheinlich um den Prozeß, der gegen den Herrn Prokuristen geführt werde. Ich fragte, was denn das für ein Prozeß sei, ob er sich nicht irre, er aber sagte, er irre sich nicht, es sei ein Prozeß, und zwar ein schwerer Prozeß, mehr aber wisse er nicht. Er selbst möchte dem Herrn Prokuristen gerne helfen, denn dieser sei ein guter und gerechter Herr, aber er wisse nicht, wie er es anfangen sollte, und er möchte nur wünschen, daß sich einflußreiche Herren seiner annehmen würden. Dies werde auch sicher geschehen, und es werde schließlich ein gutes Ende nehmen, vorläufig aber stehe es, wie er aus der Laune des Herrn Prokuristen entnehmen könne, gar nicht gut. Ich legte diesen Reden natürlich nicht viel Bedeutung bei, suchte auch den einfältigen Diener zu beruhigen, verbot ihm, anderen gegenüber davon zu sprechen, und halte das Ganze für ein Geschwätz. Trotzdem wäre es vielleicht gut, wenn Du, liebster Vater, bei Deinem nächsten Besuch der Sache nachgehen wolltest, es wird Dir leicht sein, Genaueres zu erfahren und, wenn es wirklich nötig sein sollte, durch Deine großen, einflußreichen Bekanntschaften einzugreifen. Sollte es aber nicht nötig sein, was ja das wahrscheinlichste ist, so wird es wenigstens Deiner Tochter bald Gelegenheit geben, Dich zu umarmen, was sie freuen würde.‹ – Ein gutes Kind«, sagte der Onkel, als er die Vorlesung beendet hatte, und wischte einige Tränen aus den Augen fort. K. nickte, er hatte infolge der verschiedenen Störungen der letzten Zeit vollständig Erna vergessen, sogar ihren Geburtstag hatte er vergessen, und die Geschichte von der Schokolade war offenbar nur zu dem Zweck erfunden, um ihn vor Onkel und Tante in Schutz zu nehmen. Es war sehr rührend, und mit den Theaterkarten, die er ihr von jetzt ab regelmäßig schicken wollte, gewiß nicht genügend belohnt, aber zu Besuchen in der Pension und zu Unterhaltungen mit einer kleinen achtzehnjährigen Gymnasiastin fühlte er sich jetzt nicht geeignet. »Und was sagst du jetzt?« fragte der Onkel, der durch den Brief alle Eile und Aufregung vergessen hatte und ihn noch einmal zu lesen schien. »Ja, Onkel«, sagte K., »es ist wahr.« »Wahr?« rief der Onkel.","Immediately after the greeting – he didn't have time to sit down in the armchair, which K. invited him to do – he asked K. for a short private conversation. ""It's necessary,"" he said, swallowing with difficulty, ""it's necessary to calm me down."" K. immediately sent the servants out of the room with instructions not to let anyone in. ""What did I hear, Josef?"" called the uncle when they were alone, sat down on the table and, without looking, stuffed various papers under them to sit better. K. said nothing, he knew what was to come, but suddenly relaxed from his strenuous work as he was, he gave in to a pleasant languor and looked through the window at the opposite side of the street, from which he could only see one from his seat small, triangular section was visible, a piece of empty house wall between two shop windows. ""You're looking out the window!"" cried the uncle, raising his arms, ""for heaven's sake, Josef, answer me! Is it true, can it be true?"" ""Dear uncle,"" said K., tearing himself away from his absent-mindedness, ""I don't know what you want from me."" ""Josef,"" said the uncle warningly. “You always told the truth, as far as I know. Should I take your last words as a bad sign?"" ""I can guess what you want,"" said K. obediently, ""you've probably heard about my trial."" ""That's right,"" answered the uncle, nodding slowly, "" I heard about your trial."" ""From who?"" asked K. ""Erna wrote to me,"" said the uncle, ""she doesn't have any dealings with you, unfortunately you don't bother much about her, but she does experience it. Today I got the letter and of course I drove here straight away. For no other reason, but it seems to be a sufficient reason. I can read you the part of the letter that concerns you.' He pulled the letter out of his wallet. 'Here it is.' She writes: 'I haven't seen Josef for a long time, I was in the bank once last week, but Josef was so busy that I wasn't let in; I waited almost an hour, but then had to go home because I had a piano lesson. I would have liked to speak to him, perhaps there will be an opportunity in the near future. For my name day he sent me a big box of chocolates, it was very kind and thoughtful. I forgot to write it to you then, only now that you ask me do I remember it. Chocolate, you must know, disappears immediately in the boarding house, no sooner do you realize that you've been given chocolate as a gift than it's gone. But as far as Josef is concerned, I wanted to tell you something else. As mentioned, I was not allowed to see him at the bank because he was negotiating with a gentleman. After waiting quietly for a while, I asked a servant if the trial would be long. He said that was probably the case, because it was probably about the lawsuit being brought against the chief clerk. I asked what kind of trial it was, whether he wasn't wrong, but he said he wasn't wrong, it was a trial, and a difficult trial at that, but that was all he knew. He himself would like to help the general manager, because he is a good and just gentleman, but he does not know how to start and he only wishes that influential gentlemen would take care of him. This will certainly happen, and it will ultimately have a happy ending, but for the time being, as he can see from the mood of the general manager, things are not going well. Of course, I did not attach much importance to these speeches, tried to calm the simple servant, forbade him to speak of it to others, and considered the whole thing to be gossip. Nevertheless it might be a good thing if you, dearest father, wanted to investigate the matter the next time you visit, it will be easy for you to find out more details and, if it should really be necessary, to intervene through your large, influential acquaintances. But should it not be necessary, which is most likely, at least your daughter will soon have an opportunity to hug you, which would make her happy.' 'A good child,' said the uncle when he had finished the lecture. and wiped some tears from her eyes. K. nodded, as a result of the various disturbances of the past few years he had completely forgotten Erna, he had even forgotten her birthday, and the story about the chocolate was evidently only made up to protect him from his uncle and aunt. It was very touching, and certainly not rewarded enough with the theater tickets that he intended to send her regularly from now on, but he didn't feel suited to visiting the boarding house or talking to a little eighteen-year-old high school girl. ""And what do you say now?"" asked the uncle, who had forgotten all haste and excitement because of the letter and seemed to be reading it again. ""Yes, uncle,"" said K., ""it's true."" ""It's true?"" exclaimed the uncle.","As soon as he’d said hello—he didn’t have time to sit down in the armchair K. offered him—he asked K. for a brief private conference. “It’s necessary,” he said, swallowing with difficulty, “it’s necessary for my peace of mind.” K. sent the assistants from the room at once, with instructions to admit no one. “ What’s this I hear, Josef?” cried his uncle, once they were alone, seating himself on the desk and stuffing various papers under him without looking at them, to make himself more comfortable. K. said nothing. He knew what was coming, but released suddenly from the strain of work as he was, he gave himself up first to a pleasant languor and gazed out the window toward the opposite side of the street, of which only a small triangular section could be seen from his chair, a stretch of empty wall between two window displays. “Stop staring out the window,” his uncle cried with uplifted arms, “for heaven’s sake, Josef, answer me. Is it true, can it be true then?” “Dear Uncle,” said K., tearing himself out of his reverie, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” “Josef,” said his uncle warningly, “to the best of my knowledge you’ve always told the truth. Should I take your last words as a bad sign.” “I can guess what you want,” said K. submissively, “you’ve probably heard about my trial.” “That’s right,” said his uncle, nodding slowly, “I’ve heard about your trial.” “From whom?” K. asked. “Erna wrote to me about it,” said his uncle, “she doesn’t see anything of you of course, you don’t take any real interest in her, sadly enough, but she found out about it anyway. I received her letter today and of course came here immediately. For no other reason, since this seemed reason enough. I can read you the passage that concerns you.” He pulled the letter from his wallet. “Here it is. She writes: ‘It’s been a long time since I’ve seen Josef, I was in the bank once last week, but Josef was so busy I couldn’t see him ; I waited for over an hour, but then I had to return home for my piano lesson. I would have liked to have talked to him, maybe I’ll get a chance to before long. He sent me a big box of chocolates on my name day, it was very sweet and thoughtful. I forgot to write you about it earlier, and only remembered when you asked me. As I’m sure you know, chocolate disappears instantly at the boardinghouse, you hardly realize you’ve been given chocolates and they’re gone. But regarding Josef, there’s something else I wanted to tell you: As I mentioned, I couldn’t get in to see him because he was busy with a gentleman. After I’d waited patiently for a while, I asked an assistant whether the appointment would last much longer. He said that it might, since it probably had something to do with the trial the chief financial officer was involved in. I asked what sort of a trial it was, whether he might be mistaken, but he said it was no mistake, it was a trial and a serious one at that, but that’s all he knew. He said he’d like to help the chief financial officer himself, because he was a good and honest man, but he didn’t know how to go about it, and he could only hope that influential people would intervene in his behalf. He thought that would surely happen and that things would turn out well, but for the moment, as he gathered from the chief financial officer’s mood, things didn’t look at all good. I didn’t attach much importance to his words of course, and tried to calm the simple-minded fellow, telling him not to mention it to anyone else, and I’m sure the whole thing is just idle talk. Nevertheless, it might be a good idea if you, dear Father, looked into the matter the next time you’re here; you could easily find out more about it and, if truly necessary, intervene through your wide circle of influential friends. If, as is most likely, that doesn’t prove necessary, it will at least give your daughter an opportunity to embrace you soon, which would give her great joy.’ A good child,” his uncle said as he finished reading the letter, wiping a few tears from his eyes. K. nodded; he had completely forgotten Erna due to the various recent disturbances, had even forgotten her birthday, and the story of the chocolates had obviously been invented merely to cover for him with his aunt and uncle. It was very touching, and the theater tickets he now meant to send her on a regular basis would hardly make up for it, but right now he didn’t feel up to visits at her boardinghouse and chats with a seventeen-year-old high school girl. “And now what do you have to say?” asked his uncle, who because of the letter had temporarily forgotten his haste and agitation, and was apparently reading it through once again. “Yes, Uncle,” said K., “it’s true.” “True?” his uncle cried out.","Immediately after his first greetings -- he had no time to sit down in the chair which K. offered him -- he begged K. to have a short talk with him in strict privacy. ""It is necessary,"" he said, painfully gulping, ""it is necessary for my peace of mind."" K. at once sent his clerks out of the room with instructions to admit no one. ""What is this I hear, Joseph?"" cried his uncle when they were alone, sitting down on the desk and making himself comfortable by stuffing several papers under him without looking at them. K. said nothing, he knew what was coming, but being suddenly released from the strain of exacting work, he resigned himself for the moment to a pleasant sense of indolence and gazed out through the window at the opposite side of the street, of which only a small triangular section could be seen from where he was sitting, a slice of empty house-wall between two shop windows. ""You sit there staring out of the window!"" cried his uncle, flinging up his arms. "" For God's sake, Joseph, answer me. Is it true? Can it be true?"" ""Dear Uncle,"" said K., tearing himself out of his reverie. ""I don't know in the least what you mean."" ""Joseph,"" said his uncle warningly, ""you've always told the truth, as far as I know. Am I to take these words of yours as a bad sign?"" ""I can guess, certainly, what you're after,"" said K. accommodatingly. ""You've probably heard something about my trial."" ""That is so,"" replied his uncle, nodding gravely. ""I have heard about your trial."" ""But from whom ?"" asked K. "" Erna wrote to me about it,"" said his uncle. ""She doesn't see much of you, I know, you don't pay much attention to her, I regret to say, and yet she heard about it. I got the letter this morning and of course took the first train here. I had no other reason for coming, but it seems to be a sufficient one. I can read you the bit from her letter that mentions you."" He took the letter from his pocketbook. "" Here it is. She writes: `I haven't seen Joseph for a long time, last week I called at the Bank, but Joseph was so busy that I couldn't see him ; I waited for almost an hour, but I had to leave then, for I had a piano lesson. I should have liked very much to speak to him, perhaps I shall soon have the chance. He sent me a great big box of chocolates for my birthday, it was very sweet and thoughtful of him. I forgot to write and mention it at the time, and it was only your asking that reminded me. For I may tell you that chocolate vanishes on the spot in this boardingschool, hardly do you realize that you've been presented with a box when it's gone. But about Joseph, there is something else that I feel I should tell you. As I said, I was not able to see him at the Bank because he was engaged with a gentleman. After I had waited meekly for a while I asked an attendant if the interview was likely to last much longer. He said that that might very well be, for it had probably something to do with the case which was being brought against the Chief Clerk. I asked what case, and was he not mistaken, but he said he was not mistaken, there was a case and a very serious one too, but more than that he did not know. He himself would like to help Herr K., for he was a good and just man, but he did not know how he was to do it, and he only wished that some influential gentleman would take the Chief Clerk's part. To be sure, that was certain to happen and everything would be all right in the end, but for the time being, as he could see from Herr K.'s state of mind, things looked far from well. Naturally I did not take all this too seriously, I tried to reassure the simple fellow and forbade him to talk about it to anyone else, and I'm sure it's just idle gossip. All the same, it might be as well if you, dearest Father, were to inquire into it on your next visit to town, it will be easy for you to find out the real state of things, and if necessary to get some of your influential friends to intervene. Even if it shouldn't be necessary, and that is most likely, at least it will give your daughter an early chance of welcoming you with a kiss, which would please her.' A good child,"" said K.'s uncle when he had finished reading, wiping a tear from his eye. K. nodded , he had completely forgotten Erna among the various troubles lie had had lately, and the story about the chocolates she had obviously invented simply to save his face before his uncle and aunt. It was really touching, and the theater tickets which he now resolved to send her regularly would be a very inadequate return, but he did not feel equal at present to calling at her boarding-school and chattering to an eighteen-year-old flapper. ""And what have you got to say now?"" asked his uncle, who had temporarily for- gotten all his haste and agitation over the letter, which lie seemed to be rereading. "" Yes, Uncle,"" said K., ""it's quite true."" ""True?"" cried his uncle.","As soon as they had greeted each other—K. had invited him to sit in the armchair but Uncle Karl had no time for that—he said he wanted to speak briefly with K. in private. “It is necessary,” he said with a tired gulp, “it is necessary for my peace of mind.” K. immediately sent the junior staff from the room and told them to let no-one in. “What's this that I've been hearing, Josef?” cried K.'s uncle when they were alone, as he sat on the table shoving various papers under himself without looking at them to make himself more comfortable. K. said nothing, he knew what was coming, but, suddenly relieved from the effort of the work he had been doing, he gave way to a pleasant lassitude and looked out the window at the other side of the street. From where he sat, he could see just a small, triangular section of it, part of the empty walls of houses between two shop windows. “You're staring out the window!” called out his uncle, raising his arms, “For God's sake, Josef, give me an answer! Is it true, can it really be true?” “Uncle Karl,” said K., wrenching himself back from his daydreaming, “I really don't know what it is you want of me.” “Josef,” said his uncle in a warning tone, “as far as I know, you've always told the truth. Am I to take what you've just said as a bad sign?” “I think I know what it is you want,” said K. obediently, “I expect you've heard about my trial.” “That's right,” answered his uncle with a slow nod, “I've heard about your trial.” “Who did you hear it from, then?” asked K. “Erna wrote to me,” said his uncle, “she doesn't have much contact with you, it's true, you don't pay very much attention to her, I'm afraid to say, but she learned about it nonetheless. I got her letter today and, of course, I came straight here. And for no other reason, but it seems to me that this is reason enough. I can read you out the part of the letter that concerns you.” He drew the letter out from his wallet. “Here it is. She writes; 'I have not seen Josef for a long time, I was in the bank last week but Josef was so busy that they would not let me through; I waited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go home as I had my piano lesson. I would have liked to have spoken to him, maybe there will be a chance another time. He sent me a big box of chocolates for my name-day, that was very nice and attentive of him. I forgot to tell you about it when I wrote, and I only remember now that you ask me about it. Chocolate, as I am sure you are aware, disappears straight away in this lodging house, almost as soon as you know somebody has given you chocolate it is gone. But there is something else I wanted to tell you about Josef. Like I said, they would not let me through to see him at the bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just then. After I had been waiting quietly for quite a long time I asked one of the staff whether his meeting would last much longer. He said it might well do, as it was probably about the legal proceedings, he said, that were being conducted against him. I asked what sort of legal proceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk, and whether he was not making some mistake, but he said he was not making any mistake , there were legal proceedings underway and even that they were about something quite serious, but he did not know any more about it. He would have liked to have been of some help to the chief clerk himself, as the chief clerk was a gentleman, good and honest, but he did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be some influential gentlemen who would take his side. I'm sure that is what will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the end, but in the mean time things do not look at all good, and you can see that from the mood of the chief clerk himself. Of course, I did not place too much importance on this conversation, and even did my best to put the bank clerk's mind at rest , he was quite a simple man. I told him he was not to speak to anyone else about this, and I think it is all just a rumour, but I still think it might be good if you, Dear Father, if you looked into the matter the next time you visit. It will be easy for you to find out more detail and, if it is really necessary, to do something about it through the great and influential people you know. But if it is not necessary, and that is what seems most likely, then at least your daughter will soon have the chance to embrace you and I look forward to it. '—She's a good child,” said K.'s uncle when he had finished reading, and wiped a few tears from his eyes. K. nodded.

"K. glaubte in eine Versammlung einzutreten. Ein Gedränge der verschiedensten Leute – niemand kümmerte sich um den Eintretenden – füllte ein mittelgroßes, zweifenstriges Zimmer, das knapp an der Decke von einer Galerie umgeben war, die gleichfalls vollständig besetzt war und wo die Leute nur gebückt stehen konnten und mit Kopf und Rücken an die Decke stießen.

"»Ja«, sagte der Mann, »aber ich bin nicht mehr verpflichtet, Sie jetzt zu verhören« – wieder das Murren, diesmal aber mißverständlich, denn der Mann fuhr, indem er den Leuten mit der Hand abwinkte, fort, – »ich will es jedoch ausnahmsweise heute noch tun. Eine solche Verspätung darf sich aber nicht mehr wiederholen. Und nun treten Sie vor!« Irgend jemand sprang vom Podium hinunter, so daß für K. ein Platz frei wurde, auf den er hinaufstieg. Er stand eng an den Tisch gedrückt, das Gedränge hinter ihm war so groß, daß er ihm Widerstand leisten mußte, wollte er nicht den Tisch des Untersuchungsrichters und vielleicht auch diesen selbst vom Podium hinunterstoßen.","'Yes,' said the man, 'but I'm no longer obliged to question you now' - again the grumbling, but this time misleading, for the man continued, waving his hand at the people - 'I will however, for once, do it today. Such a delay must not be repeated. And now step forward!' Someone jumped down from the podium, leaving a place free for K., which he climbed onto. He stood pressed close to the table, the crowd behind him was so great that he had to resist it if he didn't want to knock the coroner's table, and perhaps the coroner himself, off the podium.","“Yes,” said the man, “but now I’m no longer required to examine you”—again the muttering, but this time mistakenly, for the man waved the people off and continued—“however , I’ll make an exception for today.

"An einem Wintervormittag – draußen fiel Schnee im trüben Licht – saß K., trotz der frühen Stunde schon äußerst müde, in seinem Büro. Um sich wenigstens vor den unteren Beamten zu schützen, hatte er dem Diener den Auftrag gegeben, niemanden von ihnen einzulassen, da er mit einer größeren Arbeit beschäftigt sei. Aber statt zu arbeiten, drehte er sich in seinem Sessel, verschob langsam einige Gegenstände auf dem Tisch, ließ dann aber, ohne es zu wissen, den ganzen Arm ausgestreckt auf der Tischplatte liegen und blieb mit gesenktem Kopf unbeweglich sitzen.","One winter morning – snow was falling outside in the dim light – K. was sitting in his office, already extremely tired despite the early hour. In order to at least protect himself from the lower officials, he had instructed the servant not to let any of them in, as he was busy with a bigger job. But instead of working, he turned in his chair, slowly moved some objects on the table, but then, without knowing it, left his whole arm outstretched on the tabletop and sat motionless with his head bowed.","On a winter morning—outside, snow was falling in the dull light—K. was sitting in his office, already thoroughly fatigued in spite of the early hour.

"»Ich will nicht Rednererfolg«, sagte K. aus dieser Überlegung heraus, »er dürfte mir auch nicht erreichbar sein. Der Herr Untersuchungsrichter spricht wahrscheinlich viel besser, es gehört ja zu seinem Beruf. Was ich will, ist nur die öffentliche Besprechung eines öffentlichen Mißstandes. Hören Sie: Ich bin vor etwa zehn Tagen verhaftet worden, über die Tatsache der Verhaftung selbst lache ich, aber das gehört jetzt nicht hierher. Ich wurde früh im Bett überfallen, vielleicht hatte man – es ist nach dem, was der Untersuchungsrichter sagte, nicht ausgeschlossen – den Befehl, irgendeinen Zimmermaler, der ebenso unschuldig ist wie ich, zu verhaften, aber man wählte mich. Das Nebenzimmer war von zwei groben Wächtern besetzt. Wenn ich ein gefährlicher Räuber wäre, hätte man nicht bessere Vorsorge treffen können. Diese Wächter waren überdies demoralisiertes Gesindel, sie schwätzten mir die Ohren voll, sie wollten sich bestechen lassen, sie wollten mir unter Vorspiegelungen Wäsche und Kleider herauslocken, sie wollten Geld, um mir angeblich ein Frühstück zu bringen, nachdem sie mein eigenes Frühstück vor meinen Augen schamlos aufgegessen hatten. Nicht genug daran. Ich wurde in ein drittes Zimmer vor den Aufseher geführt. Es war das Zimmer einer Dame, die ich sehr schätze, und ich mußte zusehen, wie dieses Zimmer meinetwegen, aber ohne meine Schuld, durch die Anwesenheit der Wächter und des Aufsehers gewissermaßen verunreinigt wurde. Es war nicht leicht, ruhig zu bleiben. Es gelang mir aber, und ich fragte den Aufseher vollständig ruhig – wenn er hier wäre, müßte er es bestätigen –, –, warum ich verhaftet sei. Was antwortete nun dieser Aufseher, den ich jetzt noch vor mir sehe, wie er auf dem Sessel der erwähnten Dame als eine Darstellung des stumpfsinnigsten Hochmuts sitzt? Meine Herren, er antwortete im Grunde nichts, vielleicht wußte er wirklich nichts, er hatte mich verhaftet und war damit zufrieden. Er hat sogar noch ein übriges getan und in das Zimmer jener Dame drei niedrige Angestellte meiner Bank gebracht, die sich damit beschäftigten, Photographien, Eigentum der Dame, zu betasten und in Unordnung zu bringen. Die Anwesenheit dieser Angestellten hatte natürlich noch einen andern Zweck, sie sollten, ebenso wie meine Vermieterin und ihr Dienstmädchen, die Nachricht von meiner Verhaftung verbreiten, mein öffentliches Ansehen schädigen und insbesondere in der Bank meine Stellung erschüttern. Nun ist nichts davon, auch nicht im geringsten, gelungen, selbst meine Vermieterin, eine ganz einfache Person – ich will ihren Namen hier in ehrendem Sinne nennen, sie heißt Frau Grubach –, selbst Frau Grubach war verständig genug, einzusehen, daß eine solche Verhaftung nicht mehr bedeutet, als einen Anschlag, den nicht genügend beaufsichtigte Jungen auf der Gasse ausführen. Ich wiederhole, mir hat das Ganze nur Unannehmlichkeiten und vorübergehenden Ärger bereitet, hätte es aber nicht auch schlimmere Folgen haben können?«","'I don't want success as a speaker,' said K., reflecting this, 'I shouldn't be able to reach him either. The examining magistrate probably speaks much better, it's part of his job. What I want is only the public discussion of a public grievance. Listen: I was arrested about ten days ago, I laugh at the fact of the arrest itself, but that doesn't belong here. I was attacked early in bed, maybe they had - it's not impossible after what the examining magistrate said - ordered to arrest some room painter who is just as innocent as I am, but I was chosen. The next room was occupied by two rude guards. If I were a dangerous robber, better precautions could not have been taken. Moreover, these guards were demoralized rabble, they talked in my ears, they wanted to be bribed, they wanted to lure linen and clothes out of me under pretenses, they wanted money to supposedly bring me breakfast after they had my own breakfast in front of my eyes shamelessly eaten up. Not enough about that. I was led into a third room in front of the guard. It was the room of a lady whom I respect very much, and I had to see this room become somewhat polluted through the presence of the guards and the overseer, through no fault of my own. It wasn't easy staying calm. I succeeded, however, and asked the warder, perfectly calm—if he were here he would have to confirm it—why I was under arrest. What did this warden answer, whom I can still see sitting on the lady's chair as a display of the dullest arrogance? Gentlemen, he basically didn't answer anything, maybe he really didn't know anything, he had arrested me and was happy with that. He even went one step further and brought into that lady's room three lowly employees of my bank, who were busy touching and disarranging photographs belonging to the lady. The presence of these employees, of course, had another purpose: they, like my landlady and her maid, were to spread the news of my arrest, damage my public image, and particularly shake my position in the bank. Now none of this has worked, not in the least, even my landlady, a very simple person - I want to use her name here in an honorable way, her name is Frau Grubach - even Frau Grubach was sensible enough to see that such an arrest means nothing more than an attack carried out in the alley by under-supervised boys. I repeat, this has only caused me inconvenience and temporary annoyance, but couldn’t it have been worse?”","“I don’t seek success as an orator,” K. said with this in mind, “nor could I necessarily achieve it. The examining magistrate is no doubt a much better speaker; after all, it goes with his profession. What I seek is simply a public discussion of a public disgrace. Listen: Around ten days ago I was arrested; the arrest itself makes me laugh, but that’s another matter. I was assaulted in the morning in bed; perhaps they’d been ordered to arrest some house painter—that can’t be ruled out after what the examining magistrate has said—someone as innocent as I am, but they chose me. The room next door had been taken over by two coarse guards. If I had been a dangerous thief, they couldn’t have taken better precautions. These guards were corrupt ruffians as well; they talked my ear off, they wanted bribes, they tried to talk me out of my undergarments and clothes under false pretenses, they wanted money, supposedly to bring me breakfast, after they’d shamelessly eaten my own breakfast before my very eyes. And that wasn’t all. I was led into a third room to see the inspector. It was the room of a young woman for whom I have the highest respect, yet I was forced to look on while this room was defiled, so to speak, by the presence of the guards and the inspector, on my account, but through no fault of my own. It wasn’t easy to stay calm. However, I managed to, and I asked the inspector quite calmly— if he were here he’d have to confirm that—why I had been arrested. And what was the reply of this inspector, whom I still see before me, sitting on the chair of the young woman I mentioned, the very image of mindless arrogance? Gentlemen, he really had no reply at all, perhaps he actually knew nothing, he had arrested me and that was enough for him. He had taken the additional step of bringing to the young lady’s room three minor employees from my bank, who spent their time fingering photographs, the property of the lady, and mixing them all up. The presence of these employees served another purpose, of course: they were meant, like my landlady and her maid, to spread the news of my arrest, damage my public reputation, and in particular to undermine my position at the bank. Well, none of this met with the slightest success; even my landlady, a very simple person—I pronounce her name in all honor, she’s called Frau Grubach—even Frau Grubach was sensible enough to realize that an arrest like that means as little as a mugging on the street by teenage hoodlums. I repeat, the whole affair has merely caused me some unpleasantness and temporary annoyance, but might it not have had more serious consequences as well?”","""I have no wish to shine as an orator,"" said K., having come to this conclusion, ""nor could I if I wished. The Examining Magistrate, no doubt, is much the better speaker, it is part of his vocation. All I desire is the public ventilation of a public grievance. Listen to me. Some ten days ago I was arrested, in a manner that seems ridiculous even to myself, though that is immaterial at the moment. I was seized in bed before I could get up, perhaps -- it is not unlikely, considering the Examining Magistrate's statement -- perhaps they had orders to arrest some house painter who is just as innocent as I am, only they hit on me. The room next to mine was requisitioned by two coarse warders. If I had been a dangerous bandit they could not have taken more careful precautions. These warders, moreover, were degenerate ruffians, they deafened my ears with their gabble, they tried to induce me to bribe them, they attempted to get my clothes and underclothes from me under dishonest pretexts, they asked me to give them money ostensibly to bring me some breakfast after they had brazenly eaten my own breakfast under my eyes. But that was not all. I was led into a third room to confront the Inspector. It was the room of a lady whom I deeply respect, and I had to look on while this room was polluted, yes, polluted, on my account but not by any fault of mine, through the presence of these warders and this Inspector. It was not easy for me to remain calm. I succeeded, however, and I asked the Inspector with the utmost calm if he were here, he would have to substantiate that -- why I had been arrested. And what was the answer of this Inspector, whom I can see before me now as lie lounged in a chair belonging to the lady I have mentioned, like an embodiment of crass arrogance? Gentlemen, he answered in effect nothing at all, perhaps he really knew nothing; he had arrested me and that was enough. But that is not all, he had brought three minor employees of my Bank into the lady's roomy who amused themselves by fingering and disarranging certain photographs, the property of the lady. The presence of these employees had another object as well, of course, they were expected, like my landlady and her maid, to spread the news of my arrest, damage my public reputation, and in particular shake my position in the Bank. Well, this expectation has entirely failed of its success, even my landlady, a quite simple person -- I pronounce her name in all honor, she is called Frau Grubach -- even Frau Grubach has been intelligent enough to recognize that an arrest such as this is no more worth taking seriously than some wild prank committed by stray urchins at the street corners. I repeat, the whole matter has caused me nothing but some unpleasantness and passing annoyance, but might it not have had worse consequences?""","“I'm not trying to be a successful orator,” said K. after this thought, “that's probably more than I'm capable of anyway. I'm sure the examining judge can speak far better than I can , it is part of his job after all. All that I want is a public discussion of a public wrong. Listen: ten days ago I was placed under arrest, the arrest itself is something I laugh about but that's beside the point. They came for me in the morning when I was still in bed. Maybe the order had been given to arrest some house painter—that seems possible after what the judge has said—someone who is as innocent as I am, but it was me they chose. There were two police thugs occupying the next room. They could not have taken better precautions if I had been a dangerous robber. And these policemen were unprincipled riff-raff, they talked at me till I was sick of it , they wanted bribes, they wanted to trick me into giving them my clothes, they wanted money, supposedly so that they could bring me my breakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in front of my eyes. And even that was not enough. I was led in front of the supervisor in another room. This was the room of a lady who I have a lot of respect for, and I was forced to look on while the supervisor and the policemen made quite a mess of this room because of me, although not through any fault of mine. It was not easy to stay calm, but I managed to do so and was completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it was that I was under arrest. If he were here he would have to confirm what I say. I can see him now, sitting on the chair belonging to that lady I mentioned—a picture of dull-witted arrogance. What do you think he answered? What he told me, gentlemen, was basically nothing at all; perhaps he really did know nothing, he had placed me under arrest and was satisfied. In fact he had done more than that and brought three junior employees from the bank where I work into the lady's room; they had made themselves busy interfering with some photographs that belonged to the lady and causing a mess. There was, of course, another reason for bringing these employees; they, just like my landlady and her maid, were expected to spread the news of my arrest and damage my public reputation and in particular to remove me from my position at the bank. Well they didn't succeed in any of that, not in the slightest, even my landlady, who is quite a simple person—and I will give you here her name in full respect, her name is Mrs. Grubach—even Mrs. Grubach was understanding enough to see that an arrest like this has no more significance than an attack carried out on the street by some youths who are not kept under proper control.

"Als K. an einem der nächsten Abende den Korridor passierte, der sein Büro von der Haupttreppe trennte – er ging diesmal fast als der letzte nach Hause, nur in der Expedition arbeiteten noch zwei Diener im kleinen Lichtfeld einer Glühlampe –, hörte er hinter einer Tür, hinter der er immer nur eine Rumpelkammer vermutet hatte, ohne sie jemals selbst gesehen zu haben, Seufzer ausstoßen. Er blieb erstaunt stehen und horchte noch einmal auf, um festzustellen, ob er sich nicht irrte – es wurde ein Weilchen still, dann waren es aber doch wieder Seufzer. – Zuerst wollte er einen der Diener holen, man konnte vielleicht einen Zeugen brauchen, dann aber faßte ihn eine derart unbezähmbare Neugierde, daß er die Tür förmlich aufriß. Es war, wie er richtig vermutet hatte, eine Rumpelkammer. Unbrauchbare, alte Drucksorten, umgeworfene leere irdene Tintenflaschen lagen hinter der Schwelle. In der Kammer selbst aber standen drei Männer, gebückt in dem niedrigen Raum. Eine auf einem Regal festgemachte Kerze gab ihnen Licht. »Was treibt ihr hier?« fragte K., sich vor Aufregung überstürzend, aber nicht laut. Der eine Mann, der die anderen offenbar beherrschte und zuerst den Blick auf sich lenkte, stak in einer Art dunkler Lederkleidung, die den Hals bis tief zur Brust und die ganzen Arme nackt ließ. Er antwortete nicht. Aber die zwei anderen riefen: »Herr! Wir sollen geprügelt werden, weil du dich beim Untersuchungsrichter über uns beklagt hast.« Und nun erst erkannte K., daß es wirklich die Wächter Franz und Willem waren, und daß der dritte eine Rute in der Hand hielt, um sie zu prügeln. »Nun«, sagte K. und starrte sie an, »ich habe mich nicht beklagt, ich habe nur gesagt, wie es sich in meiner Wohnung zugetragen hat. Und einwandfrei habt ihr euch ja nicht benommen.« »Herr«, sagte Willem, während Franz sich hinter ihm vor dem dritten offenbar zu sichern suchte, »wenn Ihr wüßtet, wie schlecht wir bezahlt sind, Ihr würdet besser über uns urteilen. Ich habe eine Familie zu ernähren, und Franz hier wollte heiraten, man sucht sich zu bereichern, wie es geht, durch bloße Arbeit gelingt es nicht, selbst durch die angestrengteste. Euere feine Wäsche hat mich verlockt, es ist natürlich den Wächtern verboten, so zu handeln, es war unrecht, aber Tradition ist es, daß die Wäsche den Wächtern gehört, es ist immer so gewesen, glaubt es mir; es ist ja auch verständlich, was bedeuten denn noch solche Dinge für den, welcher so unglücklich ist, verhaftet zu werden? Bringt er es dann allerdings öffentlich zur Sprache, dann muß die Strafe erfolgen.« »Was ihr jetzt sagt, wußte ich nicht, ich habe auch keineswegs eure Bestrafung verlangt, mir ging es um ein Prinzip.« »Franz«, wandte sich Willem zum anderen Wächter, »sagte ich dir nicht, daß der Herr unsere Bestrafung nicht verlangt hat? Jetzt hörst du, daß er nicht einmal gewußt hat, daß wir bestraft werden müssen.« »Laß dich nicht durch solche Reden rühren«, sagte der dritte zu K., »die Strafe ist ebenso gerecht als unvermeidlich.« »Höre nicht auf ihn«, sagte Willem und unterbrach sich nur, um die Hand, über die er einen Rutenhieb bekommen hatte, schnell an den Mund zu führen, »wir werden nur gestraft, weil du uns angezeigt hast. Sonst wäre uns nichts geschehen, selbst wenn man erfahren hätte, was wir getan haben. Kann man das Gerechtigkeit nennen? Wir zwei, insbesondere aber ich, hatten uns als Wächter durch lange Zeit sehr bewährt – du selbst mußt eingestehen, daß wir, vom Gesichtspunkt der Behörde gesehen, gut gewacht haben – wir hatten Aussicht, vorwärtszukommen und wären gewiß bald auch Prügler geworden wie dieser, der eben das Glück hatte, von niemandem angezeigt worden zu sein, denn eine solche Anzeige kommt wirklich nur sehr selten vor. Und jetzt, Herr, ist alles verloren, unsere Laufbahn beendet, wir werden noch viel untergeordnetere Arbeiten leisten müssen, als es der Wachdienst ist, und überdies bekommen wir jetzt diese schrecklich schmerzhaften Prügel.« »Kann denn die Rute solche Schmerzen machen?« fragte K. und prüfte die Rute, die der Prügler vor ihm schwang. »Wir werden uns ja ganz nackt ausziehen müssen«, sagte Willem. »Ach so«, sagte K. und sah den Prügler genau an, er war braun gebrannt wie ein Matrose und hatte ein wildes, frisches Gesicht. »Gibt es keine Möglichkeit, den beiden die Prügel zu ersparen?« fragte er ihn. »Nein«, sagte der Prügler und schüttelte lächelnd den Kopf. »Zieht euch aus!« befahl er den Wächtern. Und zu K. sagte er: »Du mußt ihnen nicht alles glauben, sie sind durch die Angst vor den Prügeln schon ein wenig schwachsinnig geworden. Was dieser hier, zum Beispiel« er zeigte auf Willem – »über seine mögliche Laufbahn erzählt hat, ist geradezu lächerlich. Sieh an, wie fett er ist – die ersten Rutenstreiche werden überhaupt im Fett verlorengehen. – Weißt du, wodurch er so fett geworden ist? Er hat die Gewohnheit, allen Verhafteten das Frühstück aufzuessen. Hat er nicht auch dein Frühstück aufgegessen? Nun, ich sagte es ja. Aber ein Mann mit einem solchen Bauch kann nie und nimmermehr Prügler werden, das ist ganz ausgeschlossen.« »Es gibt auch solche Prügler«, behauptete Willem, der gerade seinen Hosengürtel löste. »Nein«, sagte der Prügler und strich ihm mit der Rute derartig über den Hals, daß er zusammenzuckte, »du sollst nicht zuhören, sondern dich ausziehen.« »Ich würde dich gut belohnen, wenn du sie laufen läßt«, sagte K. und zog, ohne den Prügler nochmals anzusehen – solche Geschäfte werden beiderseits mit niedergeschlagenen Augen am besten abgewickelt – seine Brieftasche hervor. »Du willst wohl dann auch mich anzeigen«, sagte der Prügler, »und auch noch mir Prügel verschaffen. Nein, nein!« »Sei doch vernünftig«, sagte K., »wenn ich gewollt hätte, daß diese beiden bestraft werden, würde ich sie doch jetzt nicht loskaufen wollen. Ich könnte einfach die Tür hier zuschlagen, nichts weiter sehen und hören wollen und nach Hause gehen. Nun tue ich das aber nicht, vielmehr liegt mir ernstlich daran, sie zu befreien; hätte ich geahnt, daß sie bestraft werden sollen oder auch nur bestraft werden können, hätte ich ihre Namen nie genannt. Ich halte sie nämlich gar nicht für schuldig, schuldig ist die Organisation, schuldig sind die hohen Beamten.« »So ist es!« riefen die Wächter und bekamen sofort einen Hieb über ihren schon entkleideten Rücken. »Hättest du hier unter deiner Rute einen hohen Richter«, sagte K. und drückte, während er sprach, die Rute, die sich schon wieder erheben wollte, nieder, »ich würde dich wahrhaftig nicht hindern, loszuschlagen, im Gegenteil, ich würde dir noch Geld geben, damit du dich für die gute Sache kräftigst.« »Was du sagst, klingt ja glaubwürdig«, sagte der Prügler, »aber ich lasse mich nicht bestechen. Ich bin zum Prügeln angestellt, also prügle ich.« Der Wächter Franz, der vielleicht in Erwartung eines guten Ausgangs des Eingreifens von K. bisher ziemlich zurückhaltend gewesen war, trat jetzt, nur noch mit den Hosen bekleidet, zur Tür, hing sich niederkniend an K.s Arm und flüsterte: »Wenn du für uns beide Schonung nicht durchsetzen kannst, so versuche wenigstens, mich zu befreien. Willem ist älter als ich, in jeder Hinsicht weniger empfindlich, auch hat er schon einmal vor ein paar Jahren eine leichte Prügelstrafe bekommen, ich aber bin noch nicht entehrt und bin doch zu meiner Handlungsweise nur durch Willem gebracht worden, der im Guten und Schlechten mein Lehrer ist. Unten vor der Bank wartet meine arme Braut auf den Ausgang, ich schäme mich ja so erbärmlich.« Er trocknete mit K.s Rock sein von Tränen ganz überlaufenes Gesicht. »Ich warte nicht mehr«, sagte der Prügler, faßte die Rute mit beiden Händen und hieb auf Franz ein, während Willem in einem Winkel kauerte und heimlich zusah, ohne eine Kopfwendung zu wagen. Da erhob sich der Schrei, den Franz ausstieß, ungeteilt und unveränderlich, er schien nicht von einem Menschen, sondern von einem gemarterten Instrument zu stammen, der ganze Korridor tönte von ihm, das ganze Haus mußte es hören. »Schrei nicht«, rief K., er konnte sich nicht zurückhalten, und während er gespannt in die Richtung sah, aus der die Diener kommen mußten, stieß er an Franz, nicht stark, aber doch stark genug, daß der Besinnungslose niederfiel und im Krampf mit den Händen den Boden absuchte; den Schlägen entging er aber nicht, die Rute fand ihn auch auf der Erde; während er sich unter ihr wälzte, schwang sich ihre Spitze regelmäßig auf und ab. Und schon erschien in der Ferne ein Diener und ein paar Schritte hinter ihm ein zweiter. K. hatte schnell die Tür zugeworfen, war zu einem der Hoffenster getreten und öffnete es. Das Schreien hatte vollständig aufgehört. Um die Diener nicht herankommen zu lassen, rief er: »Ich bin es!« »Guten Abend, Herr Prokurist!« rief es zurück. »Ist etwas geschehen?« »Nein, nein«, antwortete K., »es schreit nur ein Hund auf dem Hof.« Als die Diener sich doch nicht rührten, fügte er hinzu: »Sie können bei Ihrer Arbeit bleiben.« Um sich in kein Gespräch mit den Dienern einlassen zu müssen, beugte er sich aus dem Fenster. Als er nach einem Weilchen wieder in den Korridor sah, waren sie schon weg. K. aber blieb nun beim Fenster, in die Rumpelkammer wagte er nicht zu gehen und nach Hause gehen wollte er auch nicht. Es war ein kleiner viereckiger Hof, in den er hinuntersah, ringsherum waren Büroräume untergebracht, alle Fenster waren jetzt schon dunkel, nur die obersten fingen einen Widerschein des Mondes auf. K. suchte angestrengt mit den Blicken in das Dunkel eines Hofwinkels einzudringen, in dem einige Handkarren ineinandergefahren waren. Es quälte ihn, daß es ihm nicht gelungen war, das Prügeln zu verhindern, aber es war nicht seine Schuld, daß es nicht gelungen war, hätte Franz nicht geschrien – gewiß, es mußte sehr weh getan haben, aber in einem entscheidenden Augenblick muß man sich beherrschen – hätte er nicht geschrien, so hätte K., wenigstens sehr wahrscheinlich, noch ein Mittel gefunden, den Prügler zu überreden. Wenn die ganze unterste Beamtenschaft Gesindel war, warum hätte gerade der Prügler, der das unmenschlichste Amt hatte, eine Ausnahme machen sollen, K. hatte auch gut beobachtet, wie ihm beim Anblick der Banknote die Augen geleuchtet hatten, er hatte mit dem Prügeln offenbar nur deshalb Ernst gemacht, um die Bestechungssumme noch ein wenig zu erhöhen. Und K. hätte nicht gespart, es lag ihm wirklich daran, die Wächter zu befreien; wenn er nun schon angefangen hatte, die Verderbnis dieses Gerichtswesens zu bekämpfen, so war es selbstverständlich, daß er auch von dieser Seite eingriff. Aber in dem Augenblick, wo Franz zu schreien angefangen hatte, war natürlich alles zu Ende. K. konnte nicht zulassen, daß die Diener und vielleicht noch alle möglichen Leute kämen und ihn in Unterhandlungen mit der Gesellschaft in der Rumpelkammer überraschten. Diese Aufopferung konnte wirklich niemand von K. verlangen. Wenn er das zu tun beabsichtigt hätte, so wäre es ja fast einfacher gewesen, K. hätte sich selbst ausgezogen und dem Prügler als Ersatz für die Wächter angeboten. Übrigens hätte der Prügler diese Vertretung gewiß nicht angenommen, da er dadurch, ohne einen Vorteil zu gewinnen, dennoch seine Pflicht schwer verletzt hätte, und wahrscheinlich doppelt verletzt hätte, denn K. mußte wohl, solange er im Verfahren stand, für alle Angestellten des Gerichts unverletzlich sein. Allerdings konnten hier auch besondere Bestimmungen gelten. Jedenfalls hatte K. nichts anderes tun können, als die Tür zuschlagen, obwohl dadurch auch jetzt noch für K. durchaus nicht jede Gefahr beseitigt blieb. Daß er noch zuletzt Franz einen Stoß gegeben hatte, war bedauerlich und nur durch seine Aufregung zu entschuldigen.","One evening later, as K. passed the corridor that separates his office from the main staircase - this time he was almost the last to go home, only two servants were still working on the expedition in the small field of light from an incandescent lamp - he heard something behind a door , behind which he had always assumed only a lumber room, without ever having seen it himself, sigh. He stopped in astonishment and listened again to see if he wasn't mistaken - there was silence for a while, but then it was sighs again. - First he wanted to fetch one of the servants, one could perhaps use a witness, but then such indomitable curiosity seized him that he literally yanked open the door. It was, as he had correctly guessed, a lumber room. Unusable, old printed matter, overturned empty earthenware ink bottles lay behind the threshold. But in the chamber itself stood three men, crouched in the low space. A candle fixed on a shelf gave them light. ""What are you doing here?"" asked K., rushing with excitement, but not loudly. The one man who seemed to dominate the others and who drew attention to himself first, was dressed in some sort of dark leather outfit that left his neck deep to his chest and his entire arm bare. He didn't answer. But the other two cried, 'Lord! We are to be beaten because you complained about us to the examining magistrate.” And only then did K. realize that it really was the guards Franz and Willem, and that the third had a rod in his hand to beat them. 'Well,' said K., staring at her, 'I didn't complain, I just said what happened in my apartment. And you didn't behave impeccably."" ""Sir,"" said Willem, while Franz behind him was obviously trying to secure himself from the third, ""if you knew how badly we're paid, you'd judge us better. I have a family to support, and Franz here wanted to get married, people try to enrich themselves as much as they can, it doesn't work through mere work, even the most strenuous ones. I was tempted by your fine linen, of course the guards are forbidden to act like that, it was wrong, but it's tradition that the linen belongs to the guards, it's always been like that, believe me; it's also understandable, what do such things mean for someone who is so unfortunate as to be arrested? If he then brings it up publicly, then the punishment must follow."" ""I didn't know what you're saying now, I didn't ask for your punishment either, I was concerned with a principle."" ""Franz,"" Willem turned to other guards, ""Didn't I tell you that the Lord did not require our punishment? Now you hear that he didn't even know that we had to be punished."" ""Don't let such talk move you,"" said the third to K., ""the punishment is just as fair as it is inevitable."" ""Don't listen to him ' said Willem, only stopping to put the hand that had hit him to his mouth, 'we're only being punished because you reported us. Otherwise nothing would have happened to us, even if they found out what we did. Can you call that justice? We two, but especially I, had proved ourselves as watchmen over a long period of time - you must admit that we kept watch well from the point of view of the authorities - we had prospects of making progress and would certainly soon have become thugs like this one, who was just lucky not to have been reported by anyone, because such a report is really very rare. And now, sir, all is lost, our careers over, we shall have to do far more menial work than guard duty, and besides, we are now getting these terribly painful beatings.” “Can the rod cause such pain?” asked K. and checked the rod that the whipper was swinging in front of him. ""We're going to have to strip completely naked,"" Willem said. ""Oh,"" said K. and looked closely at the whipper, he was as tanned as a sailor and had a wild, fresh face. ""Isn't there a way to spare them both the beating?"" he asked him. ""No,"" said the whipper, smiling and shaking his head. ""Undress your clothes!"" he ordered the guards. And to K. he said: 'You don't have to believe everything they say, they've become a bit feeble because they're afraid of being beaten. What this one here, for example"" he pointed at Willem - ""said about his possible career is downright ridiculous. Look how fat he is - the first few strokes of the rod will be lost in the fat at all. – Do you know what made him so fat? He is in the habit of eating breakfast for all those arrested. Didn't he eat your breakfast too? Well I said so. But a man with a stomach like that can never, ever become a flogger, that's completely out of the question.' 'There are floggers like that too,' declared Willem, who was just unbuckling the belt of his pants. ""No,"" said the whipper, stroking his neck with the rod so much that he winced, ""you shouldn't listen, you should undress."" ""I'd reward you well if you let her go,"" said K. and without looking at the thug again - such business is best done with downcast eyes on both sides - pulled out his wallet. ""Then you probably want to report me too,"" said the whipper, ""and also get me a beating. No, no!"" ""Be sensible,"" said K., ""if I had wanted these two to be punished, I wouldn't want to buy them out now. I could just slam the door here, wanting to see and hear no more, and go home. But I don't do that now, I'm more serious about freeing her; had I known that they should be punished or even could be punished, I would never have mentioned their names. I don't think they're guilty at all, the organization is to blame, the high officials are to blame.' 'That's right!' cried the guards, and they immediately got a smack on their already undressed back. ""If you had a high judge here under your rod,"" said K., and as he spoke he pressed down the rod that was about to rise again, ""I really wouldn't prevent you from striking out, on the contrary, I would give you money so that you can strengthen yourself for the good cause."" ""What you say sounds credible,"" said the whipper, ""but I won't take bribes. I'm employed for beatings, so I'm beating.' The guard Franz, who had perhaps been rather reticent up to now, perhaps expecting a good result from K.'s intervention, now walked to the door, only wearing his trousers, and knelt down to hang on K.'s arm and whispered: ""If you can't get us both to take it easy, at least try to free me. Willem is older than me, less sensitive in every respect, and he received a light beating a few years ago, but I am not yet dishonored and my actions were only brought to my actions by Willem, who is mine for good and ill teacher is. Downstairs in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for the exit, I'm so ashamed.' He wiped his tear-streaked face with K.'s coat. ""I won't wait any longer,"" said the whipper, grasping the rod with both hands and hacking at Franz, while Willem crouched in a corner and watched secretly, not daring to turn his head. Then the scream that Franz let out rose, undivided and unchangeable, it didn't seem to come from a human being but from a tortured instrument, the whole corridor resounded from him, the whole house must have heard it. ""Don't shout,"" shouted K., he couldn't hold back, and while he was looking tensely in the direction the servants were supposed to be coming from, he bumped into Franz, not hard, but hard enough that the unconscious man fell down and fell spasm searching the ground with his hands; but he did not escape the blows, the rod also found him on the ground; as he rolled beneath her, her tip periodically swung up and down. And already a servant appeared in the distance and a few steps behind him another. K. quickly slammed the door, went to one of the courtyard windows and opened it. The screaming had stopped completely. In order not to let the servants approach, he called out: ""It's me!"" ""Good evening, Herr General Manager!"" she called back. 'Has something happened?' 'No, no,' answered K., 'a dog is just screaming in the yard.' When the servants didn't move after all, he added: 'You can stay on with your work.' To himself not having to engage in conversation with the servants, he leaned out of the window. After a while, when he looked down the corridor again, they were already gone. But K. stayed by the window, he didn't dare go into the lumber room and he didn't want to go home either. It was a small square courtyard that he looked down into, offices were all around it, all the windows were already dark, only the top ones caught a reflection of the moon. K. tried hard to penetrate the dark corner of a courtyard where a few handcarts had bumped into each other. It tormented him that he hadn't been able to stop the beating, but it wasn't his fault that it hadn't worked if Franz hadn't screamed—certainly, it must have hurt a lot, but at a crucial moment you have to control himself – if he hadn't screamed, K. would, at least very likely, have found another way to persuade the bully. If all the lowest officials were rabble, why should the flogger, who held the most inhuman office, should have made an exception? K. had also observed how his eyes lit up when he saw the banknote, he obviously only did the beating therefore taken seriously to increase the bribe a little. And K. wouldn't have skimped, it was really important to him to free the guards; if he had already begun to combat the corruption of this judiciary, it was only natural that he should intervene from this side as well. But the moment Franz started screaming, of course it was all over. K. couldn't allow the servants and perhaps all sorts of other people to come and surprise him in negotiations with the company in the lumber room. No one could really ask K. for this sacrifice. If he had intended to do that, it would almost have been easier if K. would have undressed himself and offered the whipper to replace the guards. Incidentally, the whipper would certainly not have accepted this representation, since he would still have seriously violated his duty without gaining any advantage, and would probably have violated it twice, because as long as he was in the proceedings, K. probably had to represent all the employees of the court be invulnerable. However, special provisions could also apply here. In any case, K. couldn't have done anything but slam the door, although that still didn't remove all danger for K.. The fact that he finally gave Franz a shove was regrettable and could only be excused by his excitement.","A few evenings later, as K. passed through the corridor that led from his office to the main staircase—he was almost the last to leave that night, only two assistants in shipping were still at work in the small circle of light from a single bulb—he heard the sound of groans behind a door that he had always assumed led to a mere junk room, though he had never seen it himself. He stopped in amazement and listened again to see if he might not be mistaken—it was quiet for a little while, but then the groans came again.—At first, feeling he might need a witness, he was about to call one of the assistants, but then he was seized by such uncontrollable curiosity that he practically tore the door open. It was, as he had suspected, a junk room. Old obsolete printed forms and overturned empty ceramic ink bottles lay beyond the threshold. In the little room itself, however, stood three men, stooping beneath the low ceiling. A candle stuck on a shelf provided light. “What’s going on here?” K. blurted out in his excitement, but not loudly. One man, who was apparently in charge of the others and drew K.’s attention first, was got up in some sort of dark leather garment that left his neck and upper chest, as well as his entire arms, bare. He didn’t reply. But the other two cried out: “Sir! We’re to be flogged because you complained about us to the examining magistrate.” And only then did K. recognize that it was indeed the guards Franz and Willem, and that the third man held a rod in his hand to flog them with. “Well now,” said K. staring at them, “I didn’t complain, I just told them what went on in my lodgings. And your behavior wasn’t exactly impeccable.” “Sir,” said Willem, while Franz apparently tried to seek safety behind him from the third man, “if you knew how poorly we’re paid, you’d judge us more kindly. I have a family to feed and Franz here wants to get married, you try to make money however you can, just working isn’t enough, no matter how hard you try, I was tempted by your fine undergarments, guards are forbidden to act that way of course, it was wrong, but it’s a tradition that the undergarments belong to the guards , it’s always been that way, believe me; and you can see why, what difference do such things make to a person unlucky enough to be arrested. If he makes it public, of course, then punishment must follow.” “I didn’t know any of that, and I certainly didn’t demand your punishment, it was a matter of principle.” “Franz,” Willem turned to the other guard, “didn’t I tell you the gentleman didn’t demand our punishment? Now, as you hear, he didn’t even realize we’d have to be punished.” “Don’t be swayed by that sort of talk,” the third man said to K., “their punishment is as just as it is inevitable.” “Don’t listen to him,” said Willem, interrupting himself only to lift a hand, across which he had received a blow of the rod, quickly to his mouth, “we’re only being punished because you reported us. Otherwise nothing would have happened, even if they had found out what we had done. Do you call that justice? Both of us have proved ourselves as guards over a long period of time, especially me—you have to admit we did a good job from the authorities’ point of view—we had prospects for advancement and would soon have been floggers ourselves, like him, who was simply fortunate enough never to be reported by anyone, for such reports are really quite rare. And now everything is lost, sir, our careers are finished, we’ll have to work at a much lower level than a guard, and undergo this terribly painful flogging as well.” “Can a rod cause that much pain?” K. asked, and examined the rod, which the flogger swung before him. “We have to strip completely,” said Willem. “Oh, I see,” said K., looking more closely at the flogger, who had a sailor’s tan and a savage, ruddy face. “Is there any possibility of sparing these two a flogging?” he asked him. “No,” said the flogger, and shook his head with a smile. “Strip,” he ordered the guards. And to K. he said: “You mustn’t believe everything they say. They’re already a bit weak in the head because they’re so afraid of the flogging. What this one was saying, for example”—he pointed at Willem—“about his prospective career is totally ridiculous. Look how overweight he is—the first blows of the rod will be lost in fat.—Do you know how he got so fat? He’s in the habit of eating the breakfast of anyone who’s arrested. Didn’t he eat yours as well? Well, what did I tell you? But a man with a belly like that can never become a flogger, it’s totally out of the question.” “There are floggers like me,” insisted Willem, who was just undoing his belt. “No!” said the flogger, stroking him across the neck with the rod in a way that made him twitch, “you shouldn’t be listening, you should be stripping.” “I’ll reward you well if you’ll let them go,” said K., taking out his wallet without looking at the flogger again, such matters being best conducted by both parties with lowered eyes. “Then you’ll probably report me too,” said the flogger, “and earn me a flogging as well. No thanks!” “Be reasonable,” said K., “if I’d wanted to have these two punished, I wouldn’t be trying to buy them off. I could simply shut the door, close my eyes and ears, and head home. But I’m not doing that, instead I’m serious about getting them off; if I’d suspected they’d be punished, or even known they faced possible punishment, I would never have mentioned their names. Because I don’t even consider them guilty; it’s the organization that’s guilty , it’s the high officials who are guilty.” “That’s right,” cried the guards, and immediately received a blow across their now bare backs. “If you had a high judge here beneath your rod,” said K., pressing down the rod, which was about to rise again as he spoke, “I really wouldn’t stop you from flailing away; on the contrary, I’d pay you extra, to strengthen you in your good work.” “I believe what you say,” said the flogger, “but I can’t be bribed. I’ve been hired to flog, and flog I will.” The guard Franz, who had kept somewhat in the background up to that point, perhaps in hope of a favorable outcome based on K.’s intervention, now stepped to the door dressed only in his trousers, fell to his knees, and clinging to K.’s arm whispered: “If you can’t manage to get us both off, please try to at least save me. Willem is older than me, less sensitive in every way, and he already received a minor flogging once a few years ago, but I’ve never been disgraced that way, and was only following the lead of Willem, who is my mentor in all things good and bad. My poor bride is waiting for me below in front of the bank; I’m so terribly ashamed.” He dried his tearstained face on K.’s jacket. “I’m not waiting any longer,” said the flogger, seized the rod with both hands, and laid into Franz, while Willem cowered in a corner and peeked over without daring to turn his head. The scream that Franz expelled rose steady and unchanging, scarcely human, as if it came from some tortured instrument; the whole corridor rang with it, the entire building would hear. “Don’t scream,” cried K., unable to stop himself, and as he looked intently in the direction from which the assistants would be coming, he pushed Franz, not hard, but hard enough that the witless man fell to the floor and clawed convulsively about with his hands; he didn’t escape the blows, however, the rod found him on the floor as well, as he writhed beneath it, its tip swung up and down steadily. And in the distance an assistant had already appeared, and a few steps behind him a second one. K. slammed the door quickly, stepped up to a nearby courtyard window, and opened it. The screams had ceased completely. To keep the assistants from coming nearer, he called out: “It’s me.” “Good evening, sir,” the call came back. “Has anything happened?” “No, no,” K. replied, “it’s just a dog howling in the courtyard.” When the assistants still didn’t stir, he added: “You can go on with your work.” And to avoid getting involved in a conversation with them, he leaned out the window. When he looked down the corridor again a while later, they were gone. But now K. remained at the window; he didn’t dare go into the junk room, and he didn’t want to go home either. The small, rectangular courtyard he looked down upon was lined with offices; all the windows were dark by now, only the highest ones catching a reflection of the moon. K. peered down intently, trying to penetrate the darkness of a corner of the courtyard where several pushcarts had been shoved together. It tormented him that he had been unable to prevent the flogging, but it wasn’t his fault; if Franz hadn’t screamed—of course it must have hurt terribly, but at critical moments you have to control yourself—if he hadn’t screamed, K. could very probably have still found some way to convince the flogger. If the entire lowest level of the bureaucracy was made up of riff-raff, why should the flogger, who had the most inhuman job of all, be an exception; K. had also taken close note of the way his eyes gleamed at the sight of the bank note; he had obviously taken the flogging so seriously solely to raise the amount of the bribe. And K. wouldn’t have been stingy, he really wanted to get the guards off; having already begun to fight corruption in the judicial system, it was only natural to take this approach as well. But the moment Franz started screaming, it was all over of course. K. couldn’t permit the assistants, and perhaps all sorts of other people, to arrive and catch him negotiating with this bunch in the junk room. No one could really demand such a sacrifice of him. If he had intended one, it would almost have been simpler for K. to strip and offer himself to the flogger in place of the guards. The flogger would hardly have accepted this substitution, however, since it would have been a grave dereliction of duty with nothing to gain, and no doubt a double dereliction, since surely no employee of the court had the right to harm him while his case was still in progress. Of course there might be special instructions in this respect as well. In any case, K. could not have done otherwise than slam the door, even though he had by no means escaped all danger by doing so even now. That he had shoved Franz at the end was unfortunate, and could only be excused by his state of agitation.","A FEW evenings later K. was passing along the Bank corridor from his office to the main staircase -- he was almost the last to leave, only two clerks in the dispatch department were still at work by the dim light of a glow lamp -- when he heard convulsive sighs behind a door, which he had always taken to be the door of a lumber-room, although he had never opened it. He stopped in astonishment and listened to make sure that he had not been mistaken -- all was still, yet in a little while the sighing began again. At first he thought of fetching one of the dispatch clerks, he might need a witness, but then he was seized by such uncontrollable curiosity that he literally tore the door open. It was, as he had correctly assumed, a lumber-room. Bundles of useless old papers and empty earthenware ink bottles lay in a tumbled heap behind the threshold. But in the room itself stood three men, stooping because of the low ceiling, by the light of a candle stuck on a shelf. ""What are you doing here?"" asked K., in great haste and agitation, but not loud. One of the men, who was clearly in authority over the other two and took the eye first, was sheathed in a sort of dark leather garment which left his throat and a good deal of his chest and the whole of his arms bare. He made no answer. But the other two cried: ""Sir! We're to be flogged because you complained about us to the Examining Magistrate."" And only then did K. realize that it was actually the warders Franz and Willem, and that the third man was holding a rod in his hand with which to beat them. "" Why,"" said K., staring at them in astonishment, ""I never complained, I only said what happened in my rooms. And, after all, your behavior there was not exactly blameless."" ""Sir,"" said Willem, while Franz openly tried to take cover behind him from the third man, ""if you only knew how badly we are paid, you wouldn't be so hard on us. I have a family to feed and Franz here wants to get married, a man tries to make whatever he can, and you don't get rich on hard work, not even if you work day and night. Your fine shirts were a temptation, of course that kind of thing is forbidden to warders, it was wrong, but it's a tradition that body-linen is the warders' perquisite , it has always been the case, believe me; and it's understandable too, for what importance can such things have for a man who is unlucky enough to be arrested? But if he ventilates it openly, punishment is bound to follow."" ""I had no idea of all this, nor did I ever demand that you should be punished, I was only defending a principle."" ""Franz,"" Willem turned to the other warder, ""didn't I tell you that the gentleman never asked us to be punished? Now you see that lie didn't even know we should be punished."" ""Don't be taken in by what they say,"" remarked the third man to K., ""the punishment is as Just as it is inevitable."" ""Don't listen to him,"" said Willem, interrupting himself to clap his hand, over which he had got a stinging blow with the rod, to his mouth. ""We are only being punished because you accused us; if you hadn't, nothing would have happened, not even if they had discovered what we did. Do you call that justice? Both of us, and especially myself, have a long record of trustworthy service as warders -- you must yourself admit that, officially speaking, we guarded you quite well -- we had every prospect of advancement and would certainly have been promoted to be Whippers pretty soon, like this man here, who simply had the luck never to be complained of, for a complaint of that kind really happens very seldom indeed. And all is lost now, sir, our careers are done for, we'll be set to do much more menial work than a warder's, and, besides that, we're in for a whipping, and that's horribly painful."" ""Can that birch-rod cause such terrible pain ? "" asked K., examining the switch, which the man waved to and fro in front of him. ""We'll have to take off all our clothes first,"" said Willem. "" Ah, I see,"" said K., and he looked more attentively at the Whipper, who was tanned like a sailor and had a brutal, healthy face. "" Is there no way of getting these two off their whipping?"" K. asked him. "" No,"" said the man, smilingly shaking his head. ""Strip,"" he ordered the warders. And he said to K.: ""You mustn't believe all they say, they're so terrified of the whipping that they've already lost what wits they had. For instance, all that this one here"" -- he pointed to Willem -- ""says about his possible career is simply absurd. See how fat he is -- the first cuts of the birch will be quite lost in fat. Do you know what made him so fat? He stuffs himself with the breakfasts of all the people he arrests. Didn't he eat up your breakfast too? There, you see, I told you so. But a man with a belly like that couldn't ever become a Whipper, it's quite out of the question."" ""There are Whippers just like me,"" maintained Willem, loosening his trouser belt. "" No,"" said the Whipper, drawing the switch across his neck so that he winced, ""you aren't supposed to be listening, you're to take off your clothes."" ""I'll reward you well if you'll let them go,"" said K., and without glancing at the Whipper again -- such things should be done with averted eyes on both sides -- he drew out his pocketbook. "" So you want to lay a complaint against me too,"" said the Whipper, ""and get me a whipping as well? No, no!"" ""Do be reasonable,"" said K. ""If I had wanted these two men to be punished, I shouldn't be trying to buy them off now. I could simply leave, shut this door after me, close my eyes and ears, and go home; but I don't want to do that, I really want to see them set free; if I had known that they would be punished or even that they could be punished, I should never have mentioned their names. For in my view they are not guilty. The guilt lies with the organization. It is the high officials who are guilty."" ""That's so,"" cried the warders and at once got a cut of the switch over their backs, which were bare now. ""If it was one of the high Judges you were flogging,"" said K., and as he spoke he thrust down the rod which the Whipper was raising again, ""I certainly wouldn't try to keep you from laying on with a will, on the contrary I would pay you extra to encourage you in the good work."" ""What you say sounds reasonable enough,"" said the man, ""but I refuse to be bribed. I am here to whip people, and whip them I shall. "" The warder Franz, who, perhaps hoping that K.'s intervention might succeed, had thus far kept as much as possible in the background, now came forward to the door clad only in his trousers, fell on his knees, and clinging to K.'s arm whispered: ""If you can't get him to spare both of us, try to get me off at least. Willem is older than I am, and far less sensitive too, besides he's had a small whipping already, some years ago, but I've never been in disgrace yet, and I was only following Willem's lead in what I did, he's my teacher, for better or worse. My poor sweetheart is awaiting the outcome at the door of the Bank. I'm so ashamed and miserable."" He dried his tear-wet face on K.'s jacket. ""I can't wait any longer,"" said the Whipper, grasping the rod with both hands and making a cut at Franz, while Willem cowered in a corner and secretly watched without daring to turn his head. Then the shriek rose from Franz's throat, single and irrevocable, it did not seem to come from a human being but from some martyred instrument, the whole corridor rang with it, the whole building must hear it. ""Don't,"" cried K.; he was beside himself, he stood staring in the direction from which the clerks must presently come running, but he gave Franz a push, not a violent one but violent enough nevertheless to make the half-senseless man fall and convulsively claw at the floor with his hands; but even then Franz did not escape his punishment, the birch-rod found him where he was lying, its point swished up and down regularly as he writhed on the floor. And now a clerk was already visible in the distance and a few paces behind him another. K. quickly slammed the door, stepped over to a window close by, which looked out on the courtyard, and opened it. The shrieks had completely stopped. To keep the clerks from approaching any nearer, K. cried: ""It's me."" ""Good evening, Sir,"" they called back. "" Has anything happened?"" ""No, no,"" replied K. ""It was only a dog howling in the courtyard. "" As the clerks still did not budge, he added: ""You can go back to your work."" And to keep himself from being involved in any conversation he leaned out of the window. When after a while he glanced into the corridor again, they were gone. But he stayed beside the window, he did not dare to go back into the lumber-room, and he had no wish to go home either. It was a little square courtyard into which he was looking down, surrounded by offices, all the windows were dark now, but the topmost panes cast back a faint reflection of the moon. K. intently strove to pierce the darkness of one corner of the courtyard, where several handbarrows were jumbled close together. He was deeply disappointed that he had not been able to prevent the whipping, but it was not his fault that he had not succeeded; if Franz had not shrieked -- it must have been very painful certainly, but in a crisis one must control oneself -- if he had not shrieked, then K., in all probability at least, would have found some other means of persuading the Whipper. If the whole lower grade of this organization were scoundrels, why should the Whipper, who had the most inhuman office of all, turn out to be an exception? Besides, K. had clearly seen his eyes glittering at the sight of the banknote, obviously he had set about his job in earnest simply to raise his price a little higher. And K. would not have been stingy, he was really very anxious to get the warders off; since he had set himself to fight the whole corrupt administration of this Court, it was obviously his duty to intervene on this occasion. But at the moment when Franz began to shriek, any intervention became impossible. K. could not afford to let the dispatch clerks and possibly all sorts of other people arrive and surprise him in a scene with these creatures in the lumber-room. No one could really demand such a sacrifice from him. If a sacrifice had been needed, it would almost have been simpler to take off his own clothes and offer himself to the Whipper as a substitute for the warders. * In any case the Whipper certainly would not have accepted such a substitution, since without gaining any advantage he would have been involved in a grave dereliction of duty, for as long as this trial continued, K. must surely be immune from molestation by the servants of the Court. Though of course ordinary standards might not apply here either. At all events, he could have done nothing but slam the door, though even that action had not shut out all danger. It was a pity that he had given Franz a push at the last moment, the state of agitation he was in was his only excuse.","One evening, a few days later, K. was walking along one of the corridors that separated his office from the main stairway—he was nearly the last one to leave for home that evening, there remained only a couple of workers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatch department—when he heard a sigh from behind a door which he had himself never opened but which he had always thought just led into a junk room. He stood in amazement and listened again to establish whether he might not be mistaken. For a while there was silence, but then came some more sighs. His first thought was to fetch one of the servitors, it might well have been worth having a witness present, but then he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply yank the door open. It was, as he had thought, a junk room. Old, unusable forms, empty stone ink-bottles lay scattered behind the entrance. But in the cupboard-like room itself stood three men, crouching under the low ceiling. A candle fixed on a shelf gave them light. “What are you doing here?” asked K. quietly, but crossly and without thinking. One of the men was clearly in charge, and attracted attention by being dressed in a kind of dark leather costume which left his neck and chest and his arms exposed. He did not answer. But the other two called out, “Mr. K.! We're to be beaten because you made a complaint about us to the examining judge.” And now, K. finally realised that it was actually the two policemen, Franz and Willem, and that the third man held a cane in his hand with which to beat them. “Well,” said K., staring at them, “I didn't make any complaint, I only said what took place in my home. And your behaviour was not entirely unobjectionable, after all.” “Mr. K.,” said Willem, while Franz clearly tried to shelter behind him as protection from the third man, “if you knew how badly we get paid you wouldn't think so badly of us. I've got a family to feed, and Franz here wanted to get married, you just have to get more money where you can, you can't do it just by working hard, not however hard you try. I was sorely tempted by your fine clothes, policemen aren't allowed to do that sort of thing, course they aren't, and it wasn't right of us, but it's tradition that the clothes go to the officers , that's how it's always been, believe me; and it's understandable too, isn't it, what can things like that mean for anyone unlucky enough to be arrested? But if he starts talking about it openly then the punishment has to follow.” “I didn't know about any of this that you've been telling me, and I made no sort of request that you be punished, I was simply acting on principle.” “Franz,” said Willem, turning to the other policeman, “didn't I tell you that the gentleman didn't say he wanted us to be punished? Now you can hear for yourself, he didn't even know we'd have to be punished.” “Don't you let them persuade you, talking like that,” said the third man to K., “this punishment is both just and unavoidable.” “Don't listen to him,” said Willem, interrupting himself only to quickly bring his hand to his mouth when it had received a stroke of the cane, “we're only being punished because you made a complaint against us. Nothing would have happened to us otherwise, not even if they'd found out what we'd done. Can you call that justice? Both of us, me especially, we'd proved our worth as good police officers over a long period—you've got to admit yourself that as far as official work was concerned we did the job well—things looked good for us , we had prospects, it's quite certain that we would've been made whip-men too, like this one, only he had the luck not to have anyone make a complaint about him, as you really don't get many complaints like that. Only that's all finished now, Mr. K., our careers are at an end, we're going to have to do work now that's far inferior to police work and besides all this we're going to get this terrible, painful beating.” “Can the cane really cause so much pain, then?” asked K., testing the cane that the whip-man swang in front of him. “We're going to have to strip off totally naked,” said Willem. “Oh, I see,” said K., looking straight at the whip-man, his skin was burned brown like a sailor's, and his face showed health and vigorous. “Is there then no possibility of sparing these two their beating?” he asked him. “No,” said the whip-man, shaking his head with a laugh. “Get undressed!” he ordered the policemen. And to K. he said, “You shouldn't believe everything they tell you, it's the fear of being beaten, it's already made them a bit weak in the head. This one here, for instance,” he pointed at Willem, “all that he told you about his career prospects, it's just ridiculous. Look at him, look how fat he is—the first strokes of the cane will just get lost in all that fat. Do you know what it is that's made him so fat? He's in the habit of, everyone that gets arrested by him, he eats their breakfast. Didn't he eat up your breakfast? Yeah, I thought as much. But a man with a belly like that can't be made into a whip-man and never will be, that is quite out of the question.” “There are whip-men like that,” Willem insisted, who had just released the belt of this trousers. “No,” said the whip-man, striking him such a blow with the cane on his neck that it made him wince, “you shouldn't be listening to this, just get undressed.” “I would make it well worth your while if you would let them go,” said K., and without looking at the whip-man again—as such matters are best carried on with both pairs of eyes turned down—he pulled out his wallet. “And then you'd try and put in a complaint against me, too,” said the whip-man, “and get me flogged. No, no!” “Now, do be reasonable,” said K., “if I had wanted to get these two punished I would not now be trying to buy their freedom, would I. I could simply close the door here behind me, go home and see or hear nothing more of it. But that's not what I'm doing, it really is of much more importance to me to let them go free; if I had realised they would be punished, or even that they might be punished, I would never have named them in the first place as they are not the ones I hold responsible. It's the organisation that's to blame, the high officials are the ones to blame.” “That's how it is!” shouted the policemen, who then immediately received another blow on their backs, which were by now exposed. “If you had a senior judge here beneath your stick,” said K., pressing down the cane as he spoke to stop it being raised once more, “I really would do nothing to stop you, on the contrary, I would even pay you money to give you all the more strength.” “Yeah, that's all very plausible, what you're saying there,” said the whip-man , “only I'm not the sort of person you can bribe. It's my job to flog people, so I flog them.” Franz, the policeman had been fairly quiet so far, probably in expectation of a good result from K.'s intervention, but now he stepped forward to the door wearing just his trousers, kneeled down hanging on to K.'s arm and whispered, “Even if you can't get mercy shown for both of us, at least try and get me set free. Willem is older than me, he's less sensitive than me in every way, he even got a light beating a couple of years ago, but my record's still clean, I only did things the way I did because Willem led me on to it, he's been my teacher both for good and bad. Down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me at the entrance, I'm so ashamed of myself, it's pitiful.” His face was flowing over with tears, and he wiped it dry on K.'s coat. “I'm not going to wait any longer,” said the whip-man, taking hold of the cane in both hands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner and looked on secretly, not even daring to turn his head. Then, the sudden scream that shot out from Franz was long and irrevocable, it seemed to come not from a human being but from an instrument that was being tortured, the whole corridor rang with it, it must have been heard by everyone in the building. “Don't shout like that!”, called out K., unable to prevent himself, and, as he looked anxiously in the direction from which the servitor would come, he gave Franz a shove, not hard, but hard enough for him to fall down unconscious, clawing at the ground with his hands by reflex ; he still did not avoid being hit; the rod still found him on the floor; the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down while he rolled to and fro under its blows. And now one of the servitors appeared in the distance, with another a few steps behind him. K. had quickly thrown the door shut, gone over to one of the windows overlooking the yard and opened it. The screams had completely stopped. So that the servitor wouldn't come in, he called out, “It's only me!” “Good evening, chief clerk,” somebody called back. “Is there anything wrong?” “No, no,” answered K., “it's only a dog yelping in the yard.” There was no sound from the servitors so he added, “You can go back to what you were doing.” He did not want to become involved with a conversation with them, and so he leant out of the window. A little while later, when he looked out in the corridor, they had already gone. Now, K. remained at the window, he did not dare go back into the junk room, and he did not want to go home either. The yard he looked down into was small and rectangular, all around it were offices, all the windows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection of the moon. K tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the yard, where a few handcarts had been left behind one another. He felt anguish at not having been able to prevent the flogging, but that was not his fault, if Franz had not screamed like that—clearly it must have caused a great deal of pain but it's important to maintain control of oneself at important moments —if Franz had not screamed then it was at least highly probable that K. would have been able to dissuade the whip-man. If all the junior officers were contemptible why would the whip-man, whose position was the most inhumane of all, be any exception, and K. had noticed very clearly how his eyes had lit up when he saw the banknotes, he had obviously only seemed serious about the flogging to raise the level of the bribe a little. And K. had not been ungenerous, he really had wanted to get the policemen freed; if he really had now begun to do something against the degeneracy of the court then it was a matter of course that he would have to do something here as well. But of course, it became impossible for him to do anything as soon as Franz started screaming. K. could not possibly have let the junior bank staff, and perhaps even all sorts of other people, come along and catch him by surprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room. Nobody could really expect that sort of sacrifice of him. If that had been his intention then it would almost have been easier, K. would have taken his own clothes off and offered himself to the whip-man in the policemen's place. The whip-man would certainly not have accepted this substitution anyway, as in that way he would have seriously violated his duty without gaining any benefit. He would most likely have violated his duty twice over, as court employees were probably under orders not to cause any harm to K. while he was facing charges, although there may have been special conditions in force here. However things stood, K. was able to do no more than throw the door shut, even though that would still do nothing to remove all the dangers he faced. It was regrettable that he had given Franz a shove, and it could only be excused by the heat of the moment.","One evening, a few days later, K. was walking along one of the corridors that separated his office from the main stairway - he was nearly the last one to leave for home that evening, there remained only a couple of workers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatch department - when he heard a sigh from behind a door which he had himself never opened but which he had always thought just led into a junk room.

""Don't you let them persuade you, talking like that,"" said the third man to K., ""this punishment is both just and unavoidable."" ""Don't listen to him,"" said Willem, interrupting himself only to quickly bring his hand to his mouth when it had received a stroke of the cane, ""we're only being punished because you made a complaint against us. Nothing would have happened to us otherwise, not even if they'd found out what we'd done. Can you call that justice? Both of us, me especially, we'd proved our worth as good police officers over a long period - you've got to admit yourself that as far as official work was concerned we did the job well - things looked good for us , we had prospects, it's quite certain that we would've been made whip-men too, like this one, only he had the luck not to have anyone make a complaint about him, as you really don't get many complaints like that. Only that's all finished now, Mr. K., our careers are at an end, we're going to have to do work now that's far inferior to police work and besides all this we're going to get this terrible, painful beating."" ""Can the cane really cause so much pain, then?"" asked K., testing the cane that the whip-man swang in front of him. ""We're going to have to strip off totally naked,"" said Willem. "" Oh, I see,"" said K., looking straight at the whip-man, his skin was burned brown like a sailor's, and his face showed health and vigour. "" Is there then no possibility of sparing these two their beating?"" he asked him. "" No,"" said the whip-man, shaking his head with a laugh. "" Get undressed!"" he ordered the policemen. And to K. he said, ""You shouldn't believe everything they tell you, it's the fear of being beaten, it's already made them a bit weak in the head. This one here, for instance,"" he pointed at Willem, ""all that he told you about his career prospects, it's just ridiculous. Look at him, look how fat he is - the first strokes of the cane will just get lost in all that fat. Do you know what it is that's made him so fat? He's in the habit of, everyone that gets arrested by him, he eats their breakfast. Didn't he eat up your breakfast? Yeah, I thought as much. But a man with a belly like that can't be made into a whip-man and never will be, that is quite out of the question."" ""There are whip-men like that,"" Willem insisted, who had just released the belt of this trousers. "" No,"" said the whip-man, striking him such a blow with the cane on his neck that it made him wince, ""you shouldn't be listening to this, just get undressed."" ""I would make it well worth your while if you would let them go,"" said K., and without looking at the whip-man again - as such matters are best carried on with both pairs of eyes turned down - he pulled out his wallet. "" And then you'd try and put in a complaint against me, too,"" said the whip-man, ""and get me flogged. No, no!"" ""Now, do be reasonable,"" said K., ""if I had wanted to get these two punished I would not now be trying to buy their freedom, would I. I could simply close the door here behind me, go home and see or hear nothing more of it. But that's not what I'm doing, it really is of much more importance to me to let them go free; if I had realised they would be punished, or even that they might be punished, I would never have named them in the first place as they are not the ones I hold responsible. It's the organisation that's to blame, the high officials are the ones to blame."" ""That's how it is!"" shouted the policemen, who then immediately received another blow on their backs, which were by now exposed. ""If you had a senior judge here beneath your stick,"" said K., pressing down the cane as he spoke to stop it being raised once more, ""I really would do nothing to stop you, on the contrary, I would even pay you money to give you all the more strength."" ""Yeah, that's all very plausible, what you're saying there,"" said the whip-man, ""only I'm not the sort of person you can bribe. It's my job to flog people, so I flog them."" Franz, the policeman, had been fairly quiet so far, probably in expectation of a good result from K.'s intervention, but now he stepped forward to the door wearing just his trousers, kneeled down hanging on to K.'s arm and whispered, ""Even if you can't get mercy shown for both of us, at least try and get me set free. Willem is older than me, he's less sensitive than me in every way, he even got a light beating a couple of years ago, but my record's still clean, I only did things the way I did because Willem led me on to it, he's been my teacher both for good and bad. Down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me at the entrance, I'm so ashamed of myself, it's pitiful. "" His face was flowing over with tears, and he wiped it dry on K.'s coat. ""I'm not going to wait any longer,"" said the whip-man, taking hold of the cane in both hands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner and looked on secretly, not even daring to turn his head. Then, the sudden scream that shot out from Franz was long and irrevocable, it seemed to come not from a human being but from an instrument that was being tortured, the whole corridor rang with it, it must have been heard by everyone in the building. ""Don't shout like that!"", called out K., unable to prevent himself, and, as he looked anxiously in the direction from which the servitor would come, he gave Franz a shove, not hard, but hard enough for him to fall down unconscious, clawing at the ground with his hands by reflex ; he still did not avoid being hit; the rod still found him on the floor; the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down while he rolled to and fro under its blows. And now one of the servitors appeared in the distance, with another a few steps behind him. K. had quickly thrown the door shut, gone over to one of the windows overlooking the yard and opened it. The screams had completely stopped. So that the servitor wouldn't come in, he called out, ""It's only me!"" ""Good evening, chief clerk,"" somebody called back. "" Is there anything wrong?"" ""No, no,"" answered K., ""it's only a dog yelping in the yard. "" There was no sound from the servitors so he added, ""You can go back to what you were doing."" He did not want to become involved with a conversation with them, and so he leant out of the window. A little while later, when he looked out in the corridor, they had already gone. Now, K. remained at the window, he did not dare go back into the junk room, and he did not want to go home either. The yard he looked down into was small and rectangular, all around it were offices, all the windows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection of the moon. K tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the yard, where a few handcarts had been left behind one another. He felt anguish at not having been able to prevent the flogging, but that was not his fault, if Franz had not screamed like that - clearly it must have caused a great deal of pain but it's important to maintain control of oneself at important moments - if Franz had not screamed then it was at least highly probable that K. would have been able to dissuade the whip-man. If all the junior officers were contemptible why would the whip-man, whose position was the most inhumane of all, be any exception, and K. had noticed very clearly how his eyes had lit up when he saw the banknotes, he had obviously only seemed serious about the flogging to raise the level of the bribe a little. And K. had not been ungenerous, he really had wanted to get the policemen freed; if he really had now begun to do something against the degeneracy of the court then it was a matter of course that he would have to do something here as well. But of course, it became impossible for him to do anything as soon as Franz started screaming. K. could not possibly have let the junior bank staff, and perhaps even all sorts of other people, come along and catch him by surprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room. Nobody could really expect that sort of sacrifice of him. If that had been his intention then it would almost have been easier, K. would have taken his own clothes off and offered himself to the whip-man in the policemen's place. The whip-man would certainly not have accepted this substitution anyway, as in that way he would have seriously violated his duty without gaining any benefit. He would most likely have violated his duty twice over, as court employees were probably under orders not to cause any harm to K. while he was facing charges, although there may have been special conditions in force here. However things stood, K. was able to do no more than throw the door shut, even though that would still do nothing to remove all the dangers he faced. It was regrettable that he had given Franz a shove, and it could only be excused by the heat of the moment."
Neuntes Kapitel,Ninth Chapter,“Leave that fur alone and listen to the lawyer.”,Chapter 9,Chapter Nine.,Chapter Nine
"Beim Eintritt wäre er fast hingefallen, denn hinter der Tür war noch eine Stufe. »Auf das Publikum nimmt man nicht viel Rücksicht«, sagte er. »Man nimmt überhaupt keine Rücksicht«, sagte der Gerichtsdiener, »sehen Sie nur hier das Wartezimmer.« Es war ein langer Gang, von dem aus roh gezimmerte Türen zu den einzelnen Abteilungen des Dachbodens führten. Obwohl kein unmittelbarer Lichtzutritt bestand, war es doch nicht vollständig dunkel, denn manche Abteilungen hatten gegen den Gang zu statt einheitlicher Bretterwände bloße, allerdings bis zur Decke reichende Holzgitter, durch die einiges Licht drang und durch die man auch einzelne Beamte sehen konnte, wie sie an Tischen schrieben oder geradezu am Gitter standen und durch die Lücken die Leute auf dem Gang beobachteten. Es waren, wahrscheinlich weil Sonntag war, nur wenig Leute auf dem Gang. Sie machten einen sehr bescheidenen Eindruck. In fast regelmäßigen Entfernungen voneinander saßen sie auf den zwei Reihen langer Holzbänke, die zu beiden Seiten des Ganges angebracht waren. Alle waren vernachlässigt angezogen, obwohl die meisten nach dem Gesichtsausdruck, der Haltung, der Barttracht und vielen, kaum sicherzustellenden kleinen Einzelheiten den höheren Klassen angehörten. Da keine Kleiderhaken vorhanden waren, hatten sie die Hüte, wahrscheinlich einer dem Beispiel des anderen folgend, unter die Bank gestellt. Als die, welche zunächst der Tür saßen, K. und den Gerichtsdiener erblickten, erhoben sie sich zum Gruß, da das die Folgenden sahen, glaubten sie auch grüßen zu müssen, so daß alle beim Vorbeigehen der beiden sich erhoben. Sie standen niemals vollständig aufrecht, der Rücken war geneigt, die Knie geknickt, sie standen wie Straßenbettler. K. wartete auf den ein wenig hinter ihm gehenden Gerichtsdiener und sagte: »Wie gedemütigt die sein müssen.« »Ja«, sagte der Gerichtsdiener, »es sind Angeklagte, alle, die Sie hier sehn, sind Angeklagte.« »Wirklich!« sagte K. »Dann sind es ja meine Kollegen.« Und er wandte sich an den nächsten, einen großen, schlanken, schon fast grauhaarigen Mann. »Worauf warten Sie hier?« fragte K. höflich. Die unerwartete Ansprache aber machte den Mann verwirrt, was um so peinlicher aussah, da es sich offenbar um einen welterfahrenen Menschen handelte, der anderswo gewiß sich zu beherrschen verstand und die Überlegenheit, die er sich über viele erworben hatte, nicht leicht aufgab. Hier aber wußte er auf eine so einfache Frage nicht zu antworten und sah auf die anderen hin, als seien sie verpflichtet, ihm zu helfen, und als könne niemand von ihm eine Antwort verlangen, wenn diese Hilfe ausbliebe. Da trat der Gerichtsdiener hinzu und sagte, um den Mann zu beruhigen und aufzumuntern: »Der Herr hier fragt ja nur, worauf Sie warten. Antworten Sie doch.« Die ihm wahrscheinlich bekannte Stimme des Gerichtsdieners wirkte besser: »Ich warte –« begann er und stockte. Offenbar hatte er diesen Anfang gewählt, um ganz genau auf die Fragestellung zu antworten, fand aber jetzt die Fortsetzung nicht. Einige der Wartenden hatten sich genähert und umstanden die Gruppe, der Gerichtsdiener sagte zu ihnen: »Weg, weg, macht den Gang frei.« Sie wichen ein wenig zurück, aber nicht bis zu ihren früheren Sitzen. Inzwischen hatte sich der Gefragte gesammelt und antwortete sogar mit einem kleinen Lächeln: »Ich habe vor einem Monat einige Beweisanträge in meiner Sache gemacht und warte auf die Erledigung.« »Sie scheinen sich ja viele Mühe zu geben«, sagte K. »Ja«, sagte der Mann, »es ist ja meine Sache.« »Jeder denkt nicht so wie Sie«, sagte K., »ich zum Beispiel bin auch angeklagt, habe aber, so wahr ich selig werden will, weder einen Beweisantrag gestellt, noch auch sonst irgend etwas Derartiges unternommen. Halten Sie denn das für nötig?« »Ich weiß nicht genau«, sagte der Mann wieder in vollständiger Unsicherheit; er glaubte offenbar, K. mache mit ihm einen Scherz, deshalb hätte er wahrscheinlich am liebsten, aus Furcht, irgendeinen neuen Fehler zu machen, seine frühere Antwort ganz wiederholt, vor K.s ungeduldigem Blick aber sagte er nur: »Was mich betrifft, ich habe Beweisanträge gestellt.« »Sie glauben wohl nicht, daß ich angeklagt bin?« fragte K. »O bitte, gewiß«, sagte der Mann, und trat ein wenig zur Seite, aber in der Antwort war nicht Glaube, sondern nur Angst. »Sie glauben mir also nicht?« fragte K. und faßte ihn, unbewußt durch das demütige Wesen des Mannes aufgefordert, beim Arm, als wolle er ihn zum Glauben zwingen. Aber er wollte ihm nicht Schmerz bereiten, hatte ihn auch nur ganz leicht angegriffen, trotzdem schrie der Mann auf, als habe K. ihn nicht mit zwei Fingern, sondern mit einer glühenden Zange erfaßt. Dieses lächerliche Schreien machte ihn K. endgültig überdrüssig; glaubte man ihm nicht, daß er angeklagt war, so war es desto besser; vielleicht hielt er ihn sogar für einen Richter. Und er faßte ihn nun zum Abschied wirklich fester, stieß ihn auf die Bank zurück und ging weiter. »Die meisten Angeklagten sind so empfindlich«, sagte der Gerichtsdiener. Hinter ihnen sammelten sich jetzt fast alle Wartenden um den Mann, der schon zu schreien aufgehört hatte, und schienen ihn über den Zwischenfall genau auszufragen. K. entgegen kam jetzt ein Wächter, der hauptsächlich an einem Säbel kenntlich war, dessen Scheide, wenigstens der Farbe nach, aus Aluminium bestand. K. staunte darüber und griff sogar mit der Hand hin. Der Wächter, der wegen des Schreiens gekommen war, fragte nach dem Vorgefallenen. Der Gerichtsdiener suchte ihn mit einigen Worten zu beruhigen, aber der Wächter erklärte, doch noch selbst nachsehen zu müssen, salutierte und ging weiter mit sehr eiligen, aber sehr kurzen, wahrscheinlich durch Gicht abgemessenen Schritten.","He almost fell as he entered, because there was another step behind the door. ""You don't pay much attention to the audience,"" he said. ""One doesn't show any consideration at all,"" said the bailiff, ""just look at the waiting room here."" It was a long corridor, from which rough wooden doors led to the individual compartments of the attic. Although there was no direct access to light, it was not completely dark, because some departments had wooden lattices facing the corridor instead of uniform wooden lattices, although they reached to the ceiling, through which some light came through and through which one could see individual officials like them writing at tables or practically standing at the bars and watching the people in the corridor through the gaps. Probably because it was Sunday, there were only a few people in the corridor. They made a very humble impression. They sat at almost regular distances from each other on the two rows of long wooden benches that lined either side of the aisle. They were all dressed sloppily, although most of them belonged to the upper classes, judging by facial expressions, posture, beards, and many small details that could hardly be ascertained. Since there were no coat hooks, they had put the hats under the bench, probably following the example of the others. When those closest to the door saw K. and the bailiff, they stood up to salute, and when the following saw this, they felt they had to salute too, so that everyone stood up as the two passed. They never stood fully erect, their backs were bent, their knees bent, they stood like street beggars. K. waited for the bailiff who was walking a little behind him and said: ""How humiliated they must be."" ""Yes,"" said the bailiff, ""they are accused, everyone you see here is accused."" ""Really!"" said K. ""Then it's my colleagues."" And he turned to the next man, a tall, slim, almost gray-haired man. ""What are you waiting for here?"" asked K. politely. But the unexpected speech made the man confused, which looked all the more embarrassing since he was obviously dealing with a world-experienced person who certainly knew how to control himself elsewhere and did not easily give up the superiority he had acquired over many. Here, however, he did not know how to answer such a simple question and looked at the others as if they were obliged to help him and as if nobody could ask him for an answer if this help did not come. Then the bailiff came up and said, to calm and cheer the man up: ""The gentleman here is just asking what you're waiting for. Answer me.” The bailiff's voice, probably familiar to him, sounded better: “I'm waiting—” he began, and faltered. Apparently he had chosen this beginning in order to answer the question very precisely, but now he couldn't find the continuation. Some of those waiting had approached and were standing around the group, and the bailiff said to them, ""Go away, clear the aisle."" They backed up a little, but not to their former seats. In the meantime, the person asked had collected himself and even answered with a small smile: ""A month ago I submitted some requests for evidence in my case and I'm waiting for it to be settled."" ""You seem to be trying very hard,"" said K. ""Yes."" , said the man, ""It's my business."" ""Everyone doesn't think like you do,"" said K., ""I, for example, am also accused, but, as sure as I want to be saved, I have not submitted any evidence or did anything else of the sort. Do you think that's necessary?' 'I don't know exactly,' said the man, again in complete uncertainty; he obviously thought K. was joking with him, which is probably why he would have preferred to repeat his earlier answer for fear of making some new mistake, but in front of K.'s impatient look he just said: ""As for me, I have Evidence has been requested.” “You don't think I'm being accused?” asked K. “Oh please, of course,” said the man, stepping aside a little, but the answer wasn't faith, just fear. ""So you don't believe me?"" asked K. and, unconsciously prompted by the man's humble nature, grabbed his arm as if he were trying to force him to believe. But he didn't want to cause him any pain, he only attacked him very lightly, but the man cried out anyway, as if K. hadn't grabbed him with two fingers but with red-hot pincers. K. finally got tired of this ridiculous screaming; if they did not believe that he was accused, so much the better; perhaps he even took him for a judge. And now, in farewell, he actually gripped him tighter, pushed him back onto the bench, and went on. ""Most of the defendants are so sensitive,"" said the bailiff. Almost everyone waiting behind them now gathered around the man, who had already stopped screaming, and seemed to be questioning him about the incident. K. was met by a guard who was mainly identifiable by a saber whose scabbard was made of aluminum, at least in terms of color. K. was amazed and even reached out with his hand. The guard who came to hear the yelling asked what had happened. The bailiff tried to calm him down with a few words, but the guard explained that he still had to see for himself, saluted and went on with very hasty but very short steps, probably measured by gout.","As he entered he almost stumbled, for there was an extra step beyond the door. “They don’t show much consideration for the public,” he said. “They show no consideration of any kind,” said the court usher, “just look at this waiting room.” It was a long hallway, with ill-fitting doors leading to the individual offices of the attic. Although there was no direct source of light, it was not completely dark, since some of the offices had been constructed with open wooden grillwork instead of solid wooden boards facing the hall, reaching to the ceiling to be sure, through which some light penetrated, and beyond which a few officials were visible writing at desks, or standing for the moment near the grille, looking out through the gaps at the people in the hallway. There were very few people in the hallway, probably because it was Sunday. They made a very modest impression. Spaced out at nearly regular intervals, they sat in two rows on long wooden benches situated on both sides of the hallway. All of them were carelessly dressed, in spite of the fact that most, to judge by their expression, their posture, the style of their beards, and numerous other small details difficult to pin down, belonged to the upper classes. Since no coathooks were available, they had placed their hats beneath the bench, probably following each other’s lead. As those sitting closest to the door caught sight of K. and the court usher, they rose in greeting; when those behind them noticed, they thought they had to do so as well, so that all of them rose as the two men passed by. They never straightened entirely; backs bowed and knees bent, they stood like beggars in the street. K. waited for the court usher, who was a few steps behind him, and said: “How humbled they must be.” “Yes,” said the court usher, “they’re defendants, everyone you see is a defendant.” “Really?” said K. “Then they’re my colleagues.” And he turned to the closest one, a tall slim man whose hair was already turning gray. “What is it you’re waiting for?” K. asked politely. The unexpected question, however, confused the man, which was even more embarrassing since he was obviously a man of the world, who would certainly have retained his self-confidence elsewhere and did not easily relinquish the superiority he had attained over so many others. But here he couldn’t even answer such a simple question and looked at the others as if it were their duty to come to his aid, and as if no one could expect an answer from him if such aid were not forthcoming. Then the court usher stepped forward and said, trying to calm the man and lend him encouragement: “The gentleman is only asking what you’re waiting for. Go ahead and answer.” The no doubt familiar voice of the court usher was more effective: “I’m waiting—” he began, and hesitated. He had apparently chosen this opening in order to answer the question exactly as it was posed, but could not think how to go on now. A few among those waiting had drawn near and gathered about them; the court usher said to them: “Get back, get back, keep the hallway clear.” They retreated somewhat, but did not return to their original places. In the meantime the man who had been questioned had pulled himself together and even managed a faint smile as he answered: “A month ago I submitted several petitions to hear evidence in my case, and I’m waiting for them to be acted upon.” “You seem to be taking great pains,” said K. “Yes,” said the man, “after all, it’s my case.” “Not everyone shares your view,” said K., “for example I’m a defendant too, but I’ll be blessed if I’ve submitted a petition to hear evidence or done anything at all of that sort. Do you really think it’s necessary?” “I’m not certain,” said the man, once more completely unsure of himself; he apparently thought K. was making fun of him, and would have evidently preferred to repeat his earlier answer in full, for fear of making some new mistake, but in the face of K.’s impatient gaze he simply said: “For my part, I’ve submitted petitions to hear evidence.” “You probably don’t think I’m really a defendant,” K. said. “Oh, yes, certainly,” said the man, and stepped aside slightly, but anxiety, not belief, lay in his reply. “So you don’t believe me?” asked K., seizing the man by the arm, unconsciously provoked by his humbleness, as if he wished to compel him to believe. He had no intention of hurting him, however, and squeezed quite gently, but even so the man screamed as if K. had applied a pair of red-hot pincers, and not merely two fingers. With this ridiculous outcry K. finally had enough of the man; if he didn’t believe he was a defendant, so much the better; perhaps he even took him for a judge. And now, in parting, he indeed squeezed him harder, pushed him back down onto the bench, and walked on. “Most defendants are so sensitive,” said the court usher. Behind them almost all those who were waiting gathered around the man, who had already stopped screaming, apparently quizzing him closely about the incident. K. was now approached by a guard, who could be recognized chiefly by a saber whose scabbard, to judge by its color, was made of aluminum. K. was amazed by this and even reached out toward it. The guard, who had been drawn by the screams, asked what had happened. The court usher attempted to pacify him with a few words, but the guard said he’d have to look into it himself, saluted and hurried on, taking extremely rapid but quite short steps, probably hindered by gout.","On entering he almost stumbled, for behind the door there was an extra step. ""They don't show much consideration for the public,"" he said. ""They show no consideration of any kind,"" replied the usher. "" Just look at this waiting-room. "" It was a long passage, a lobby communicating by ill-fitting doors with the different offices on the floor. Although there was no window to admit light, it was not entirely dark, for some of the offices were not properly boarded off from the passage but had an open frontage of wooden rails, reaching, however, to the roof, through which a little light penetrated and through which one could see a few officials as well, some writing at their desks, and some standing close to the rails peering through the interstices at the people in the lobby. There were only a few people in the lobby, probably because it was Sunday. They made a very modest showing. At almost regular intervals they were sitting singly along a row of wooden benches fixed to either side of the passage. All of them were carelessly dressed, though to judge from the expression of their faces, their bearing, the cut of their beards, and many almost imperceptible little details, they obviously belonged to the upper classes. As there was no hat-rack in the passage, they had placed their hats under the benches, in this probably following each other's example. When those who were sitting nearest the door caught sight of K. and the usher, they rose politely, followed in turn by their neighbors, who also seemed to think it necessary to rise, so that everyone stood as the two men passed. They did not stand quite erect, their backs remained bowed, their knees bent, they stood like street beggars. K. waited for the usher, who kept slightly behind him, and said: ""How humbled they must be!"" ""Yes,"" said the usher, ""these are the accused men, all of them are defendants."" ""Indeed !"" said K. "" Then they're colleagues of mine."" And he turned to the nearest, a tall, slender, almost gray-haired man. ""What are you waiting here for?"" asked K. courteously. But this unexpected question confused the man, which was the more deeply embarrassing as he was obviously a man of the world who would have known how to comport himself anywhere else and would not lightly have renounced his natural superiority. Yet in this place he did not know even how to reply to a simple question and gazed at the others as if it were their duty to help him, as if no one could expect him to answer should help not be forthcoming. Then the usher stepped up and said, to reassure the man and encourage him: ""This gentleman merely asked what you are waiting for. Come, give him an answer. "" The familiar voice of the usher had its effect: ""I'm waiting- "" the man started to say, but could get out no more. He had obviously begun by intending to make an exact reply to the question, but did not know how to go on. Some of the other clients had drifted up and now clustered round, and the usher said to them: ""Off with you, keep the passage clear. "" They drew back a little, but not to their former places. Meanwhile the man had collected himself and actually replied with a faint smile: "" A month ago I handed in several affidavits concerning my case and I am waiting for the result."" ""You seem to put yourself to a great deal of trouble,"" said K. ""Yes,"" said the man, ""for it is my case."" ""Everyone doesn't think as you do,"" said K. ""For example, I am under arrest too, but as sure as I stand here I have neither put in any affidavit nor attempted anything whatever of the kind. Do you consider such things necessary, then?"" ""I can't exactly say,"" replied the man, once more deprived of all assurance; he evidently thought that K. was making fun of him, and appeared to be on the point of repeating his first answer all over again for fear of making a new mistake, but under K.'s impatient eye he merely said: ""Anyhow, I have handed in my affidavits."" ""Perhaps you don't believe that I am under arrest?"" asked K. ""Oh, yes, certainly,"" said the man, stepping somewhat aside, but there was no belief in his answer, merely apprehension. ""So you don't really believe me?"" asked K. and, provoked without knowing it by the man's humility, he seized him by the arm as if to compel him to believe. He had no wish to hurt him, and besides had grasped him quite loosely, yet the man cried out as if K. had gripped him with glowing pincers instead of with two fingers. That ridiculous outcry was too much for K.; if the man would not believe that he was under arrest, so much the better; perhaps he actually took him for a Judge. As a parting gesture he gripped the man with real force, flung him back on the bench, and went on his way. ""Most of these accused men are so sensitive,"" said the usher. Behind them almost all the clients were now gathered round the man, whose cries had already ceased, and they seemed to be eagerly asking him about the incident. A guard came up to K., he was mainly recognizable by his sword, whose sheath, at least to judge from its color, was of aluminum. K. gaped at it and actually put out his hand to feel it. The guard, who had come to inquire into the commotion, asked what had happened. The usher tried to put him off with a few words, but the guard declared that he must look into this matter himself, saluted, and strutted on with hasty but very short steps, probably resulting from gout.","At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was another step. “They don't show much concern for the public,” he said. “They don't show any concern at all,” said the usher, “just look at the waiting room here.” It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic. There was no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the departments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to the ceiling to separate them from the corridor. The light made its way in through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the gaps. There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it was Sunday. They were not very impressive. They sat, equally spaced, on two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both sides of the corridor. All of them were carelessly dressed although the expressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to the upper classes. There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so they had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having followed the example of the others. When those who were sitting nearest the door saw K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them, and when the others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them, so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up. None of them stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees bent, they stood like beggars on the street. K. waited for the usher, who was following just behind him. “They must all be very dispirited,” he said. “Yes,” said the usher, “they are the accused, everyone you see here has been accused.” “Really!” said K. “They're colleagues of mine then.” And he turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hair that was nearly grey. “What is it you are waiting for here?” asked K., politely, but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly, which was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had some experience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able to show his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage he had acquired. Here, though, he did not know what answer to give to such a simple question and looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to help him, and as if no-one could expect any answer from him without this help. Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, “The gentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for. You can give him an answer.” The voice of the usher was probably familiar to him, and had a better effect than K.'s. “I'm ... I'm waiting ...” he began, and then came to a halt. He had clearly chosen this beginning so that he could give a precise answer to the question, but now he didn't know how to continue. Some of the others waiting had come closer and stood round the group, the usher of the court said to them, “Get out the way, keep the gangway free.” They moved back slightly, but not as far as where they had been sitting before. In the meantime, the man whom K. had first approached had pulled himself together and even answered him with a smile. “A month ago I made some applications for evidence to be heard in my case, and I'm waiting for it to be settled.” “You certainly seem to be going to a lot of effort,” said K. “Yes,” said the man, “it is my affair after all.” “Not everyone thinks the same way as you do,” said K. “I've been indicted as well but I swear on my soul that I've neither submitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort. Do you really think that's necessary?” “I don't really know, exactly,” said the man, once more totally unsure of himself; he clearly thought K. was joking with him and therefore probably thought it best to repeat his earlier answer in order to avoid making any new mistakes. With K. looking at him impatiently, he just said, “as far as I'm concerned, I've applied to have this evidence heard.” “Perhaps you don't believe I've been indicted?” asked K. “Oh, please, I certainly do,” said the man, stepping slightly to one side, but there was more anxiety in his answer than belief. “You don't believe me then?” asked K., and took hold of his arm, unconsciously prompted by the man's humble demeanour, and as if he wanted to force him to believe him. But he did not want to hurt the man and had only taken hold of him very lightly. Nonetheless, the man cried out as if K. had grasped him not with two fingers but with red hot tongs. Shouting in this ridiculous way finally made K. tired of him, if he didn't believe he was indicted then so much the better; maybe he even thought K. was a judge. And before leaving, he held him a lot harder, shoved him back onto the bench and walked on. “These defendants are so sensitive, most of them,” said the usher of the court. Almost all of those who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who, by now, had stopped shouted and they seemed to be asking him lots of precise questions about the incident. K. was approached by a security guard, identifiable mainly by his sword, of which the scabbard seemed to be made of aluminium. This greatly surprised K., and he reached out for it with his hand. The guard had come because of the shouting and asked what had been happening. The usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself, saluted, and hurried on, walking with very short steps, probably because of gout.","At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was another step. ""They don't show much concern for the public,"" he said. ""They don't show any concern at all,"" said the usher, ""just look at the waiting room here. "" It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic. There was no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the departments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to the ceiling to separate them from the corridor. The light made its way in through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the gaps. There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it was Sunday. They were not very impressive. They sat, equally spaced, on two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both sides of the corridor. All of them were carelessly dressed although the expressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to the upper classes. There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so they had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having followed the example of the others. When those who were sitting nearest the door saw K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them, and when the others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them, so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up. None of them stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees bent, they stood like beggars on the street. K. waited for the usher, who was following just behind him. ""They must all be very dispirited,"" he said. ""Yes,"" said the usher, ""they are the accused, everyone you see here has been accused."" ""Really!"" said K. ""They're colleagues of mine then. "" And he turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hair that was nearly grey. ""What is it you are waiting for here?"" asked K., politely, but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly, which was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had some experience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able to show his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage he had acquired. Here, though, he did not know what answer to give to such a simple question and looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to help him, and as if no-one could expect any answer from him without this help. Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, ""The gentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for. You can give him an answer. "" The voice of the usher was probably familiar to him, and had a better effect than K.'s. ""I'm ... I'm waiting ..."" he began, and then came to a halt. He had clearly chosen this beginning so that he could give a precise answer to the question, but now he didn't know how to continue. Some of the others waiting had come closer and stood round the group, the usher of the court said to them, ""Get out the way, keep the gangway free.

"»Es ist kein Zweifel«, sagte K. sehr leise, denn ihn freute das angespannte Aufhorchen der ganzen Versammlung, in dieser Stille entstand ein Sausen, das aufreizender war als der verzückteste Beifall, »es ist kein Zweifel, daß hinter allen Äußerungen dieses Gerichtes, in meinem Fall also hinter der Verhaftung und der heutigen Untersuchung, eine große Organisation sich befindet. Eine Organisation, die nicht nur bestechliche Wächter, läppische Aufseher und Untersuchungsrichter, die günstigsten Falles bescheiden sind, beschäftigt, sondern die weiterhin jedenfalls eine Richterschaft hohen und höchsten Grades unterhält, mit dem zahllosen, unumgänglichen Gefolge von Dienern, Schreibern, Gendarmen und andern Hilfskräften, vielleicht sogar Henkern, ich scheue vor dem Wort nicht zurück. Und der Sinn dieser großen Organisation, meine Herren? Er besteht darin, daß unschuldige Personen verhaftet werden und gegen sie ein sinnloses und meistens, wie in meinem Fall, ergebnisloses Verfahren eingeleitet wird. Wie ließe sich bei dieser Sinnlosigkeit des Ganzen die schlimmste Korruption der Beamtenschaft vermeiden? Das ist unmöglich, das brächte auch der höchste Richter nicht einmal für sich selbst zustande. Darum suchen die Wächter den Verhafteten die Kleider vom Leib zu stehlen, darum brechen Aufseher in fremde Wohnungen ein, darum sollen Unschuldige, statt verhört, lieber vor ganzen Versammlungen entwürdigt werden. Die Wächter haben nur von Depots erzählt, in die man das Eigentum der Verhafteten bringt, ich wollte einmal diese Depotplätze sehen, in denen das mühsam erarbeitete Vermögen der Verhafteten fault, soweit es nicht von diebischen Depotbeamten gestohlen ist.«","""There is no doubt,"" said K. very quietly, because he was pleased that the whole assembly listened tensely, in this silence there was a roar that was more provocative than the most ecstatic applause, ""there is no doubt that behind all the statements by this court , in my case behind the arrest and today's investigation, there is a large organization. An organization that not only employs corrupt guards, silly overseers and examining magistrates, who are modest at best, but which in any case continues to maintain a judiciary of the highest and highest grade, with the countless, indispensable entourage of servants, clerks, gendarmes and other auxiliaries, maybe even hangmen, I don't shy away from the word. And the purpose of this great organization, gentlemen? It consists in arresting innocent people and initiating a pointless and mostly, as in my case, inconclusive procedure against them. With all this senselessness, how could the worst corruption of the civil service be avoided? That is impossible, not even the supreme judge could do it for himself. That's why the guards try to steal the clothes from the arrested people, that's why guards break into other people's homes, that's why innocent people should rather be degraded in front of whole assemblies instead of being questioned. The guards only talked about depots where the property of those arrested was taken. I wanted to see these depots where the hard-earned assets of those arrested rotted, provided they weren’t stolen by thieving depot officials.”","“There can be no doubt,” K. said very quietly, for he was pleased by the keen attention with which the whole assembly was listening, a murmuring arising in that stillness that was more exciting than the most delighted applause, “there can be no doubt that behind all the pronouncements of this court, and in my case, behind the arrest and today’s inquiry, there exists an extensive organization. An organization that not only engages corrupt guards, inane inspectors, and examining magistrates who are at best mediocre, but that supports as well a system of judges of all ranks, including the highest, with their inevitable innumerable entourage of assistants, scribes, gendarmes, and other aides, perhaps even hangmen, I won’t shy away from the word. And the purpose of this extensive organization, gentlemen? It consists of arresting innocent people and introducing senseless proceedings against them, which for the most part, as in my case, go nowhere. Given the senselessness of the whole affair, how could the bureaucracy avoid becoming entirely corrupt? It’s impossible, even the highest judge couldn’t manage it, even with himself. So guards try to steal the shirts off the backs of arrested men, inspectors break into strange apartments, and innocent people, instead of being examined, are humiliated before entire assemblies. The guards told me about depositories to which an arrested man’s property is taken; I’d like to see these depository places sometime, where the hard-earned goods of arrested men are rotting away, if they haven’t already been stolen by pilfering officials.”","""There can be no doubt --"" said K., quite softly, for he was elated by the breathless attention of the meeting; in that stillness a subdued hum was audible which was more exciting than the wildest applause -- ""there can he no doubt that behind all the actions of this court of justice, that is to say in my case, behind my arrest and today's interrogation, there is a great organization at work. An organization which not only employs corrupt warders, oafish Inspectors, and Examining Magistrates of whom the best that can be said is that they recognize their own limitations, but also has at its disposal a judicial hierarchy of high, indeed of the highest rank, with an indispensable and numerous retinue of servants, clerks, police, and other assistants, perhaps even hangmen, I do not shrink from that word. And the significance of this great organization, gentlemen? It consists in this, that innocent persons are accused of guilt, and senseless proceedings are put in motion against them, mostly without effect, it is true, as in my own case. But considering the senselessness of the whole, how is it possible for the higher ranks to prevent gross corruption in their agents? It is impossible. Even the highest Judge in this organization cannot resist it. So the warders try to steal the clothes off the bodies of the people they arrest, the Inspectors break into strange houses, and innocent men, instead of being fairly examined, are humiliated in the presence of public assemblies. The warders mentioned certain depots where the property of prisoners is kept; I should like to see these depots where the hard-earned property of arrested men is left to rot, or at least what remains of it after thieving officials have helped themselves.""","K was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they listened to him, a rustling rose from the silence which was more invigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been. “There is no doubt,” he said quietly, “that there is some enormous organisation determining what is said by this court. In my case this includes my arrest and the examination taking place here today, an organisation that employs policemen who can be bribed, oafish supervisors and judges of whom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as some others. This organisation even maintains a high-level judiciary along with its train of countless servants, scribes, policemen and all the other assistance that it needs, perhaps even executioners and torturers—I'm not afraid of using those words. And what, gentlemen, is the purpose of this enormous organisation? Its purpose is to arrest innocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, as in my case, lead to no result. How are we to avoid those in office becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning? That is impossible, not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that for himself. That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of those they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes of people they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated in front of crowds rather than being given a proper trial. The policemen only talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those they arrest, I would like to see these warehouses where the hard won possessions of people under arrest is left to decay, if, that is, it's not stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers.”","K was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they listened to him, a rustling rose from the silence which was more invigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been.

"Es war unbedingt nötig, daß K. selbst eingriff. Gerade in Zuständen großer Müdigkeit, wie an diesem Wintervormittag, wo ihm alles willenlos durch den Kopf zog, war diese Überzeugung unabweisbar. Die Verachtung, die er früher für den Prozeß gehabt hatte, galt nicht mehr. Wäre er allein in der Welt gewesen, hätte er den Prozeß leicht mißachten können, wenn es allerdings auch sicher war, daß dann der Prozeß überhaupt nicht entstanden wäre. Jetzt aber hatte ihn der Onkel schon zum Advokaten gezogen, Familienrücksichten sprachen mit; seine Stellung war nicht mehr vollständig unabhängig von dem Verlauf des Prozesses, er selbst hatte unvorsichtigerweise mit einer gewissen unerklärlichen Genugtuung vor Bekannten den Prozeß erwähnt, andere hatten auf unbekannte Weise davon erfahren, das Verhältnis zu Fräulein Bürstner schien entsprechend dem Prozeß zu schwanken – kurz, er hatte kaum mehr die Wahl, den Prozeß anzunehmen oder abzulehnen, er stand mitten darin und mußte sich wehren. War er müde, dann war es schlimm.","It was absolutely necessary for K. to intervene himself. Especially when he was very tired, like on this winter morning, when everything was running through his mind without will, this conviction was irrefutable. The contempt he used to have for the trial no longer applied. If he had been alone in the world, he could easily have disregarded the process, although it was certain that the process would not have arisen at all. But now his uncle had already taken him to be a lawyer, family considerations played a part; his position was no longer completely independent of the course of the trial, he himself had carelessly mentioned the trial to acquaintances with a certain inexplicable satisfaction, others had found out about it in an unknown way, the relationship with Miss Bürstner seemed to fluctuate according to the trial - in short, he no longer had the choice of accepting or rejecting the lawsuit, he was right in the middle of it and had to defend himself.

Had he stood alone in the world he could easily have ridiculed the whole affair, though it was also certain that in that event it could never have arisen at all. But now his uncle had dragged him to this lawyer, family considerations had come in; his position was no longer quite independent of the course the case took, he himself, with a certain inexplicable complacence, had imprudently mentioned it to some of his acquaintances, others had come to learn of it in ways unknown to him, his relations with Fräulein Bürstner seemed to fluctuate with the case itself -- in short, he hardly had the choice now to accept the trial or reject it, he was in the middle of it and must fend for himself.

"K. kümmerte sich nicht lange um ihn und die Gesellschaft auf dem Gang, besonders da er etwa in der Hälfte des Ganges die Möglichkeit sah, rechts durch eine türlose Öffnung einzubiegen. Er verständigte sich mit dem Gerichtsdiener darüber, ob das der richtige Weg sei, der Gerichtsdiener nickte, und K. bog nun wirklich dort ein. Es war ihm lästig, daß er immer einen oder zwei Schritte vor dem Gerichtsdiener gehen mußte, es konnte wenigstens an diesem Ort den Anschein haben, als ob er verhaftet vorgeführt werde. Er wartete also öfters auf den Gerichtsdiener, aber dieser blieb gleich wieder zurück. Schließlich sagte K., um seinem Unbehagen ein Ende zu machen: »Nun habe ich gesehen, wie es hier aussieht, ich will jetzt weggehen.« »Sie haben noch nicht alles gesehen«, sagte der Gerichtsdiener vollständig unverfänglich. »Ich will nicht alles sehen«, sagte K., der sich übrigens wirklich müde fühlte, »ich will gehen, wie kommt man zum Ausgang?« »Sie haben sich doch nicht schon verirrt?« fragte der Gerichtsdiener erstaunt, »Sie gehen hier bis zur Ecke und dann rechts den Gang hinunter geradeaus zur Tür.« »Kommen Sie mit«, sagte K., »zeigen Sie mir den Weg, ich werde ihn verfehlen, es sind hier so viele Wege.« »Es ist der einzige Weg«, sagte der Gerichtsdiener nun schon vorwurfsvoll, »ich kann nicht wieder mit Ihnen zurückgehen, ich muß doch meine Meldung vorbringen und habe schon viel Zeit durch Sie versäumt.« »Kommen Sie mit!« wiederholte K. jetzt schärfer, als habe er endlich den Gerichtsdiener auf einer Unwahrheit ertappt. »Schreien Sie doch nicht so«, flüsterte der Gerichtsdiener, »es sind ja hier überall Büros. Wenn Sie nicht allein zurückgehen wollen, so gehen Sie noch ein Stückchen mit mir oder warten Sie hier, bis ich meine Meldung erledigt habe, dann will ich ja gern mit Ihnen wieder zurückgehen.« »Nein, nein«, sagte K., »ich werde nicht warten und Sie müssen jetzt mit mir gehen.« K. hatte sich noch gar nicht in dem Raum umgesehen, in dem er sich befand, erst als jetzt eine der vielen Holztüren, die ringsherum standen, sich öffnete, blickte er hin. Ein Mädchen, das wohl durch K.s lautes Sprechen herbeigerufen war, trat ein und fragte: »Was wünscht der Herr?« Hinter ihr in der Ferne sah man im Halbdunkel noch einen Mann sich nähern. K. blickte den Gerichtsdiener an. Dieser hatte doch gesagt, daß sich niemand um K. kümmern werde, und nun kamen schon zwei, es brauchte nur wenig und die Beamtenschaft wurde auf ihn aufmerksam, würde eine Erklärung seiner Anwesenheit haben wollen. Die einzig verständliche und annehmbare war die, daß er Angeklagter war und das Datum des nächsten Verhörs erfahren wollte, gerade diese Erklärung aber wollte er nicht geben, besonders da sie auch nicht wahrheitsgemäß war, denn er war nur aus Neugierde gekommen oder, was als Erklärung noch unmöglicher war, aus dem Verlangen, festzustellen, daß das Innere dieses Gerichtswesens ebenso widerlich war wie sein Äußeres. Und es schien ja, daß er mit dieser Annahme recht hatte, er wollte nicht weiter eindringen, er war beengt genug von dem, was er bisher gesehen hatte, er war gerade jetzt nicht in der Verfassung, einem höheren Beamten gegenüberzutreten, wie er hinter jeder Tür auftauchen konnte, er wollte weggehen, und zwar mit dem Gerichtsdiener oder allein, wenn es sein mußte.","K. didn't bother with him and the people in the corridor for long, especially since he saw the possibility of turning right through a doorless opening about halfway down the corridor. He agreed with the bailiff whether that was the right way, the bailiff nodded, and K. actually turned in there. It bothered him that he always had to walk a step or two in front of the bailiff, at least in this place it could appear as if he was being brought under arrest. So he often waited for the bailiff, but he stayed right back. Finally K. said, to put an end to his discomfort: ""Now I've seen what it looks like here, I want to go away now."" ""You haven't seen everything yet,"" said the bailiff, completely innocently. 'I don't want to see everything,' said K., who actually felt really tired, 'I want to go, how do you get to the exit?' 'You haven't lost your way already?' to the corner and then right down the corridor straight to the door."" ""Come with me,"" said K., ""show me the way, I'll miss it, there are so many ways here."" ""It's the only way ' said the bailiff reproachfully, 'I can't go back with you, I have to report and I've wasted a lot of time because of you.' caught the bailiff in an untruth. 'Don't yell like that,' the bailiff whispered, 'there are offices everywhere here. If you don't want to go back alone, walk with me a little longer or wait here until I've finished my report, then I'd be happy to go back with you."" ""No, no,"" said K., ""I I won't wait and you have to go with me now.' K. hadn't even looked around the room he was in, only when one of the many wooden doors around it opened did he look. A girl, who was probably summoned by K.'s loud speech, came in and asked: ""What does the gentleman want?"" Behind her in the distance a man could be seen approaching in the semidarkness. K. looked at the bailiff. After all, the latter had said that nobody would bother about K., and now two of them came, it didn't take much for the officials to notice him and would want an explanation for his presence. The only understandable and acceptable one was that he was the accused and wanted to know the date of the next interrogation, but that was precisely the explanation he didn't want to give, especially since it wasn't truthful either, because he had only come out of curiosity or what sort of explanation even more impossible, from a desire to ascertain that the inside of this court system was as repulsive as its outside. And it seemed that he was right in that assumption, he didn't want to intrude any further, he was cramped enough from what he had seen so far, he wasn't in the mood right now to face a higher official like he was behind everyone He wanted to go away, with the bailiff or alone if he had to.","K. soon ceased worrying about him and the people in the hallway, particularly since he saw, about halfway down the hall, a turn to the right through an opening with no door. He checked with the court usher whether it was the right way, the court usher nodded, and K. took the turn. It annoyed him that he always had to walk a pace or two ahead of the court usher, since, given the location, it might appear that he was an arrested man under escort. So he slowed up several times for the court usher, who, however, kept hanging back. Finally, to put an end to his discomfort, K. said: “Well, I’ve seen what things look like here, and I’m ready to leave.” “You haven’t seen everything yet,” said the court usher, completely without guile. “I don’t want to see everything,” said K., who was in fact feeling quite tired, “I want to leave, where’s the exit?” “Surely you’re not lost already,” asked the court usher in amazement, “you go to the corner there, turn right and go straight down the hall to the door.” “Come with me,” said K. “Show me the way; I’ll miss it, there are so many ways here.” “It’s the only way,” said the court usher, reproachfully now, “I can’t go back with you; I have to deliver my report, and I’ve already lost a good deal of time because of you.” “Come with me,” K. repeated more sharply, as if he had finally caught the court usher in a lie. “Don’t shout so,” whispered the court usher, “there are offices all around here. If you don’t want to go back by yourself, then come along with me a ways, or wait here until I’ve delivered my report, then I’ll gladly go back with you.” “No, no,” said K., “I won’t wait and you have to go with me now.” K. hadn’t even looked around the room he was in; not until one of the many wooden doors surrounding him opened did he glance over. A young woman, no doubt drawn by K.’s loud voice, stepped in and asked: “May I help you, sir?” Behind her in the distance a man could be seen approaching in the semidarkness. K. looked at the court usher. After all, he’d said that no one would pay any attention to K., and now here came two people already; it wouldn’t take much and the official bureaucracy would notice him and demand an explanation for his presence. The only reasonable and acceptable one was that he was a defendant trying to discover the date of his next hearing, but that was precisely the explanation he didn’t wish to give, particularly since it wasn’t true, for he had come out of pure curiosity or, even less acceptable as an explanation, out of a desire to confirm that the interior of this judicial system was just as repugnant as its exterior. And it seemed that he had been right in that assumption; he had no wish to intrude any further, he was inhibited enough by what he had already seen, and he was certainly in no mood now to confront some high official who might appear from behind any door; he wanted to leave, with the court usher or alone if need be.","K. did not trouble his head for long over him and the people in the lobby, particularly as, when he had walked halfway down the lobby, he saw a turning leading to the right through an opening which had no door. He inquired of the usher if this was the right way, the usher nodded, and K. then turned into it. It troubled him that he had always to walk one or two paces ahead of the usher, in a place like this it might look as if he were a prisoner under escort. Accordingly he paused several times to wait for the usher, but the man always dropped behind again. At last K. said, to put an end to his discomfort: ""I've seen the place now, and I think I'll go."" ""You haven't seen everything yet,"" said the usher innocently. ""I don't want to see everything,"" said K., who by now felt really tired. ""I want to get away, how does one reach the outside door?"" ""You surely haven't lost your way already?"" asked the usher in surprise. ""You just go along here to the corner and then turn to the right along the lobby straight to the door."" ""You come too,"" said K. ""Show me the way, there are so many lobbies here, I'll never find the way."" ""There's only the one way,"" said the usher reproachfully. ""I can't go back with you, I must deliver my message and I've lost a great deal of time through you already."" ""Come with me,"" said K. still more sharply, as if he had at last caught the usher in a falsehood. "" Don't shout like that,"" whispered the usher, ""there are offices everywhere hereabouts. If you don't want to go back by yourself, then come a little farther with me, or wait here until I've delivered my message, then I'll be glad to take you back."" ""No, no,"" said K., ""I won't wait and you must come with me now. "" K. had not yet even glanced round the place where he was, and only when one of the many wooden doors opened did he turn his head. A girl whose attention must have been caught by K.'s raised voice appeared and asked: ""What does the gentleman want ? "" A good way behind her he could also see a male figure approaching in the half-light. K. looked at the usher. The man had said that nobody would pay any attention to him, and now two people were already after him, it wouldn't take much to bring all the officials down on him, demanding an explanation of his presence. The only comprehensible and acceptable one was that he was an accused man and wished to know the date of his next interrogation, but that explanation he did not wish to give, especially as it was not even in accordance with the truth, for he had come only out of curiosity or, what was still more impossible as an explanation of his presence, out of a desire to assure himself that the inside of this legal system was just as loathsome as its external aspect. And it seemed, indeed, that he had been right in that assumption, he did not want to make any further investigation, he was dejected enough by what he had already seen, he was not at that moment in a fit state to confront any higher official such as might appear from behind one of these doors, he wanted to quit the place with the usher, or, if need be, alone.","K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people, especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along it on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going that way. He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the usher nodded, and that is the way that K. went. The usher remained always one or two steps behind K, which he found irritating as in a place like this it could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up, but the usher always remained behind him. In order to put an end to his discomfort, K. finally said, “Now that I've seen what it looks like here, I'd like to go.” “You haven't seen everything yet,” said the usher ingenuously. “I don't want to see everything,” said K., who was also feeling very tired, “I want to go , what is the way to the exit?” “You haven't got lost, have you?” asked the usher in amazement, “you go down this way to the corner, then right down the corridor straight ahead as far as the door.” “Come with me,” said K., “show me the way , I'll miss it, there are so many different ways here.” “It's the only way there is,” said the usher, who had now started to sound quite reproachful, “I can't go back with you again, I've got to hand in my report, and I've already lost a lot of time because of you as it is.” “Come with me!” K. repeated, now somewhat sharper as if he had finally caught the usher out in a lie. “Don't shout like that,” whispered the usher, “there's offices all round us here. If you don't want to go back by yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I've sorted out my report, then I'll be glad to go back with you again.” “No, no,” said K., “I will not wait and you must come with me now.” K. had still not looked round at anything at all in the room where he found himself, and it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around him opened that he noticed it. A young woman, probably summoned by the loudness of K.'s voice, entered and asked, “What is it the gentleman wants?” In the darkness behind her there was also a man approaching. K. looked at the usher. He had, after all, said that no-one would take any notice of K., and now there were two people coming, it only needed a few and everyone in the office would become aware of him and asking for explanations as to why he was there. The only understandable and acceptable thing to say was that he was accused of something and wanted to know the date of his next hearing, but this was an explanation he did not want to give, especially as it was not true—he had only come out of curiosity. Or else, an explanation even less usable, he could say that he wanted to ascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as it was on the outside. And it did seem that he had been quite right in this supposition, he had no wish to intrude any deeper, he was disturbed enough by what he had seen already, he was not in the right frame of mind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind any door, and he wanted to go, either with the usher of the court or, if needs be, alone.","K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people, especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along it on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going that way.

"»Mag sie also jetzt Ihre Geliebte sein«, sagte Leni, »Sie würden sie aber nicht sehr vermissen, wenn Sie sie verlören oder für jemand anderen, zum Beispiel für mich, eintauschten.« »Gewiß«, sagte K. lächelnd, »das wäre denkbar, aber sie hat einen großen Vorteil Ihnen gegen über, sie weiß nichts von meinem Prozeß, und selbst wenn sie etwas davon wüßte, würde sie nicht daran denken. Sie würde mich nicht zur Nachgiebigkeit zu überreden suchen.« »Das ist kein Vorteil«, sagte Leni. »Wenn sie keine sonstigen Vorteile hat, verliere ich nicht den Mut. Hat sie irgendeinen körperlichen Fehler?« »Einen körperlichen Fehler?« fragte K. »Ja«, sagte Leni, »ich habe nämlich einen solchen kleinen Fehler, sehen Sie.« Sie spannte den Mittel- und Ringfinger ihrer rechten Hand auseinander, zwischen denen das Verbindungshäutchen fast bis zum obersten Gelenk der kurzen Finger reichte. K. merkte im Dunkel nicht gleich, was sie ihm zeigen wollte, sie führte deshalb seine Hand hin, damit er es abtaste. »Was für ein Naturspiel«, sagte K. und fügte, als er die ganze Hand überblickt hatte, hinzu: »Was für eine hübsche Kralle!« Mit einer Art Stolz sah Leni zu, wie K. staunend immer wieder ihre zwei Finger auseinanderzog und zusammenlegte, bis er sie schließlich flüchtig küßte und losließ. »Oh!« rief sie aber sofort, »Sie haben mich geküßt!« Eilig, mit offenem Mund erkletterte sie mit den Knien seinen Schoß. K. sah fast bestürzt zu ihr auf, jetzt, da sie ihm so nahe war, ging ein bitterer, aufreizender Geruch wie von Pfeffer von ihr aus, sie nahm seinen Kopf an sich, beugte sich über ihn hinweg und biß und küßte seinen Hals, biß selbst in seine Haare. »Sie haben mich eingetauscht!« rief sie von Zeit zu Zeit, »sehen Sie, nun haben Sie mich eingetauscht!« Da glitt ihr Knie aus, mit einem kleinen Schrei fiel sie fast auf den Teppich, K. umfaßte sie, um sie noch zu halten, und wurde zu ihr hinabgezogen. »Jetzt gehörst du mir«, sagte sie.","""So she may be your lover now,"" said Leni, ""but you wouldn't miss her very much if you lost her or traded her for someone else, like me for example."" ""Certainly,"" said K., smiling, ""that It's possible, but she has one great advantage over you, she doesn't know about my trial, and even if she did, she wouldn't think about it. She wouldn't try to persuade me to give in."" ""That's no advantage,"" said Leni. “If she has no other advantages, I will not lose heart. Does she have any physical faults?” “A physical fault?” asked K. “Yes,” said Leni, “I have such a small fault, you see.” She spread the middle and ring fingers of her right hand between them the connecting membrane reached almost to the top knuckle of the short fingers. In the dark, K. didn't immediately notice what she wanted to show him, so she put his hand there so he could feel it. ""What a game of nature,"" said K. and, once he had surveyed the whole hand, added: ""What a pretty claw!"" Leni watched with a kind of pride as K. kept pulling her two fingers apart and together until he finally gave her a quick kiss and let go. ""Oh!"" but she exclaimed immediately, ""You kissed me!"" Hurriedly, open-mouthed, she climbed onto his lap with her knees. K. looked up at her almost in dismay, now that she was so close to him she emitted a bitter, provocative smell like pepper, she took his head, bent over him and bit and kissed his neck, bit his own hair. ""You traded me in!"" she cried from time to time, ""You see, now you have traded me in!"" Then her knee slipped, and with a little cry she almost fell on the carpet. K. hugged her, still around her to hold, and was drawn down to her. ""You're mine now,"" she said.","“Well she may be your sweetheart now,” said Leni, “but you wouldn’t miss her much if you lost her, or traded her for someone else—me, for example.” “Of course,” said K. with a smile, “that’s conceivable, but she has one major advantage over you: she doesn’t know anything about my trial, and even if she did, she wouldn’t think about it. She wouldn’t try to talk me into giving in.” “That’s no advantage,” said Leni. “If that’s her only advantage, I won’t lose heart. Does she have a physical defect of any sort?” “A physical defect?” asked K. “Yes,” said Leni, “I have a slight defect of that sort, look.” She spread apart the middle and ring fingers of her right hand, between which the connecting skin extended almost to the top knuckle of her short fingers. In the darkness, K. couldn’t see at first what it was she wanted to show him, so she guided his hand to feel it. “What a whim of nature,” K. said, and added, when he had examined her whole hand: “ What a pretty claw!” Leni watched with a kind of pride as K. opened and closed her two fingers repeatedly in astonishment, until he finally kissed them lightly and released them. “Oh!” she cried out at once, “you’ve kissed me!” Hastily, with open mouth, she climbed up his lap on her knees; K. looked up at her in near dismay; now that she was so close to him an exciting, almost bitter odor, like pepper, rose from her; she pulled his head to her and bent over it, biting and kissing his neck, even biting his hair. “You’ve traded her for me,” she cried from time to time, “you see, now you’ve traded her for me after all!” Then her knees slid from under her, and with a small cry she almost slipped to the carpet; K. put his arms around her to catch her and was drawn down with her. “Now you belong to me,” she said.","""Well, granted that she's your sweetheart,"" said Leni, ""you wouldn't miss her very much, all the same, if you were to lose her or exchange her for someone else, me, for instance?"" ""Certainly,"" said K., smiling, ""that's conceivable, but she has one great advantage over you , she knows nothing about my case, and even if she knew she wouldn't bother her head about it. She wouldn't try to get me to be less unyielding."" ""That's no advantage,"" said Leni. ""If that's all the advantage she has over me I shan't give up hope. Has she any physical defect?"" ""Any physical defect?"" asked K. "" Yes,"" said Leni. "" For I have a slight one. Look."" She held up her right hand and stretched out the two middle fingers, between which the connecting web of skin reached almost to the top joint, short as the fingers were. In the darkness K. could not make out at once what she wanted to show him, so she took his hand and made him feel it. "" What a freak of nature!"" said K. and he added, when he had examined the whole hand: ""What a pretty little paw ! "" Leni looked on with a kind of pride while K. in astonishment kept pulling the two fingers apart and then putting them side by side again, until at last he kissed them lightly and let them go. "" Oh !"" she cried at once. ""You have kissed me !"" She hastily scrambled up until she was kneeling openmouthed on his knees. K. looked up at her almost dumfounded; now that she was so close to him she gave out a bitter exciting odor like pepper; she clasped his head to her, bent over him, and bit and kissed him on the neck, biting into the very hairs of his head. ""You have exchanged her for me,"" she cried over and over again. "" Look, you have exchanged her for me after all !"" Then her knees slipped, with a faint cry she almost fell on the carpet, K. put his arms round her to hold her up and was pulled down to her. ""You belong to me now,"" she said.","“Well she might be your lover now, then,” said Leni, “but you wouldn't miss her much if you lost her or if you exchanged her for somebody else, me for instance.” “That is certainly conceivable,” said K. with a smile, “but she does have one major advantage over you , she knows nothing about my trial, and even if she did she wouldn't think about it. She wouldn't try to persuade me to be les unyielding.” “Well that's no advantage,” said Leni. “If she's got no advantage other than that, I can keep on hoping. Has she got any bodily defects?” “'Bodily defects'?” asked K. “Yeah,” said Leni, “as I do have a bodily defect, just a little one. Look.” She spread the middle and ring fingers of her right hand apart from each other. Between those fingers the flap of skin connecting them reached up almost as far as the top joint of the little finger. In the darkness, K. did not see at first what it was she wanted to show him, so she led his hand to it so that he could feel. “What a freak of nature,” said K., and when he had taken a look at the whole hand he added, “What a pretty claw!” Leni looked on with a kind of pride as K. repeatedly opened and closed her two fingers in amazement, until, finally, he briefly kissed them and let go. “Oh!” she immediately exclaimed, “you kissed me!” Hurriedly, and with her mouth open, she clambered up K.'s lap with her knees. He was almost aghast as he looked up at her, now that she was so close to him there was a bitter, irritating smell from her, like pepper, she grasped his head, leant out over him, and bit and kissed his neck, even biting into his hair. “I've taken her place!” she exclaimed from time to time. “Just look, now you've taken me instead of her!” Just then, her knee slipped out and, with a little cry, she nearly fell down onto the carpet, K. tried to hold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down with her. “Now you're mine,” she said.","""Well she might be your lover now, then,"" said Leni, ""but you wouldn't miss her much if you lost her or if you exchanged her for somebody else, me for instance.""

"»Weinen Sie doch nicht, Frau Grubach«, sagte K. und sah zum Fenster hinaus, er dachte nur an Fräulein Bürstner und daran, daß sie ein fremdes Mädchen in ihr Zimmer aufgenommen hatte. »Weinen Sie doch nicht«, sagte er nochmals, als er sich ins Zimmer zurückwandte und Frau Grubach noch immer weinte. »Es war ja damals auch von mir nicht so schlimm gemeint. Wir haben eben einander gegenseitig mißverstanden. Das kann auch alten Freunden einmal geschehen.« Frau Grubach rückte die Schürze unter die Augen, um zu sehen, ob K. wirklich versöhnt sei. »Nun ja, es ist so«, sagte K. und wagte nun, da, nach dem Verhalten der Frau Grubach zu schließen, der Hauptmann nichts verraten hatte, noch hinzuzufügen: »Glauben Sie denn wirklich, daß ich mich wegen eines fremden Mädchens mit Ihnen verfeinden könnte?« »Das ist es ja eben, Herr K.«, sagte Frau Grubach, es war ihr Unglück, daß sie, sobald sie sich nur irgendwie freier fühlte, gleich etwas Ungeschicktes sagte. »Ich fragte mich immerfort: Warum nimmt sich Herr K. so sehr des Fräulein Bürstner an? Warum zankt er ihretwegen mit mir, obwohl er weiß, daß mir jedes böse Wort von ihm den Schlaf nimmt? Ich habe ja über das Fräulein nichts anderes gesagt, als was ich mit eigenen Augen gesehen habe.« K. sagte dazu nichts, er hätte sie mit dem ersten Wort aus dem Zimmer jagen müssen, und das wollte er nicht. Er begnügte sich damit, den Kaffee zu trinken und Frau Grubach ihre Überflüssigkeit fühlen zu lassen. Draußen hörte man wieder den schleppenden Schritt des Fräulein Montag, welche das ganze Vorzimmer durchquerte. »Hören Sie es?« fragte K. und zeigte mit der Hand nach der Tür. »Ja«, sagte Frau Grubach und seufzte, »ich wollte ihr helfen und auch vom Dienstmädchen helfen lassen, aber sie ist eigensinnig, sie will alles selbst übersiedeln. Ich wundere mich über Fräulein Bürstner. Mir ist es oft lästig, daß ich Fräulein Montag in Miete habe, Fräulein Bürstner aber nimmt sie sogar zu sich ins Zimmer.« Das muß Sie gar nicht kümmern, sagte K. und zerdrückte die Zuckerreste in der Tasse. »Haben Sie denn dadurch einen Schaden?« »Nein«, sagte Frau Grubach, »an und für sich ist es mir ganz willkommen, ich bekomme dadurch ein Zimmer frei und kann dort meinen Neffen, den Hauptmann, unterbringen. Ich fürchtete schon längst, daß er Sie in den letzten Tagen, während derer ich ihn nebenan im Wohnzimmer wohnen lassen mußte, gestört haben könnte. Er nimmt nicht viel Rücksicht.« »Was für Einfälle!« sagte K. und stand auf, »davon ist ja keine Rede. Sie scheinen mich wohl für überempfindlich zu halten, weil ich diese Wanderungen des Fräulein Montag – jetzt geht sie wieder zurück – nicht vertragen kann.« Frau Grubach kam sich recht machtlos vor. »Soll ich, Herr K., sagen, daß sie den restlichen Teil der Übersiedelung aufschieben soll? Wenn Sie wollen, tue ich es sofort.« »Aber sie soll doch zu Fräulein Bürstner übersiedeln!« sagte K. »Ja«, sagte Frau Grubach, sie verstand nicht ganz, was K. meinte. »Nun also«, sagte K., »dann muß sie doch ihre Sachen hinübertragen.« Frau Grubach nickte nur. Diese stumme Hilflosigkeit, die äußerlich nicht anders aussah als Trotz, reizte K. noch mehr. Er fing an, im Zimmer vom Fenster zur Tür auf und ab zu gehen und nahm dadurch Frau Grubach die Möglichkeit, sich zu entfernen, was sie sonst wahrscheinlich getan hätte.","""Don't cry, Frau Grubach,"" said K. and looked out the window, all he was thinking about was Fraulein Bürstner and the fact that she had taken a stranger into her room. ""Don't cry,"" he said again, turning back into the room and Frau Grubach was still crying. “I didn't mean it so badly back then either. We just misunderstood each other. That can also happen to old friends once in a while.' Frau Grubach put her apron under her eyes to see if K. was really reconciled. ""Well, that's the way it is,"" said K., and now that, judging from Frau Grubach's behavior, the captain hadn't revealed anything, he dared to add: ""Do you really think that I'd come along because of a strange girl?"" Could make enemies of you?' 'That's just it, Herr K.,' said Frau Grubach, it was her misfortune that as soon as she felt any more free she said something awkward. “I kept asking myself: why is Herr K. taking such good care of Fraulein Bürstner? Why does he quarrel with me about her, knowing that every angry word from him puts me to sleep? I didn't say anything about the young lady other than what I saw with my own eyes.' K. didn't say anything about that, he should have chased her out of the room at the first word, and he didn't want to. He contented himself with drinking the coffee and letting Frau Grubach feel that she was superfluous. Outside, Fraulein Montag's sluggish footsteps could be heard again, crossing the entire antechamber. ""Do you hear it?"" asked K., pointing to the door. ""Yes,"" said Frau Grubach and sighed, ""I wanted to help her and also let the maid help, but she's stubborn, she wants to move everything herself. I'm surprised about Miss Bürstner. It often bothers me that I'm renting Miss Montag, but Miss Bürstner even takes her into her room.' You don't have to worry about that, said K., crushing the remains of sugar in the cup. 'Did you suffer any damage as a result?' 'No,' said Frau Grubach, 'in and of itself I'm quite happy with it, it frees up a room and I can accommodate my nephew, the captain, there. I had long feared that he might have disturbed you during the last few days, during which I had to let him live next door in the living room. He doesn't show much consideration."" ""What ideas!"" said K. and stood up, ""there's no question of that. You seem to think I'm overly sensitive because I can't stand Miss Montag's wanderings – now she's going back again.' Frau Grubach felt quite helpless. 'Should I, Herr K., tell her to postpone the rest of the move? If you want, I'll do it immediately.' 'But she's supposed to move to Fraulein Bürstner!' said K. 'Yes,' said Frau Grubach, she didn't quite understand what K. meant. ""Well then,"" said K., ""she'll have to take her things over there after all."" Frau Grubach just nodded. This mute helplessness, which outwardly looked no different than defiance, irritated K. even more. He began pacing up and down the room from the window to the door, thereby preventing Frau Grubach from going away, which she probably would have done otherwise.","“Please don’t cry, Frau Grubach,” said K., gazing out the window; he was thinking only of Fräulein Bürstner and that she was taking a stranger into her room. “Please don’t cry,” he said again, as he turned back toward the room and Frau Grubach continued to weep. “I didn’t mean to be so harsh either then. We just misunderstood one another. That happens sometimes, even to old friends.” Frau Grubach lowered the apron from her eyes to see if K. was truly appeased. “That’s all it was,” said K., and ventured to add, since he gathered from Frau Grubach ’s behavior that the captain hadn’t told her anything: “Do you really think I’d let some young woman I don’t really know come between us?” “That’s just it, Herr K.,” said Frau Grubach, whose misfortune it was to say something awkward the moment she began to relax in the least, “I kept asking myself: Why is Herr K. taking such an interest in Fräulein Bürstner? Why is he arguing with me about her, when he knows I lose sleep over every angry word he says? After all, all I said about Fräulein Bürstner was what I’d seen with my own eyes.” K. made no reply; it would have meant driving her from the room at the very first word, and he didn’t want to do that. He was content to drink his coffee and allow Frau Grubach to feel superfluous. Outside, the dragging steps of Fräulein Montag could be heard once more along the entire length of the hall. “Do you hear that?” asked K., pointing toward the door. “Yes,” Frau Grubach said with a sigh, “I wanted to help her, and have the maid help too, but she’s stubborn, she wants to move everything herself. I’m surprised at Fräulein Bürstner. I regret having Fräulein Montag as a boarder often enough, and now Fräulein Bürstner is taking her into her own room.” “That shouldn’t bother you,” said K., crushing the sugary residue in his cup. “Do you lose anything by it?” “No,” said Frau Grubach, “it’s even good as far as I’m concerned; it leaves a room free for my nephew, the captain. I’ve been worried he might have bothered you the last few days while I had to let him sleep next door in the living room. He’s not particularly considerate.” “What an idea!” said K., standing up; “not in the least. You seem to think I’m overly sensitive just because I can’t stand listening to Fräulein Montag—there she goes back again—making all those trips.” Frau Grubach found herself at a loss. “Should I tell her to postpone the rest of the move, Herr K.? I’ll do so at once if you wish.” “But she’s moving in with Fräulein Bürstner!” said K. “Yes,” said Frau Grubach, not quite seeing K.’s point. “Well, then,” said K., “she has to take her things there.” Frau Grubach merely nodded. This silent helplessness, which had the surface appearance of stubbornness, irritated K. even further. He began pacing back and forth in the room from window to door, giving Frau Grubach no opportunity to slip away, which she would otherwise no doubt have done.","""Please don't cry, Frau Grubach,"" said K., looking out through the window, he was really thinking of Fräulein Bürstner and of the fact that she had taken a strange girl into her room. ""Please don't cry,"" he said again as he turned back to the room and found Frau Grubach still weeping. ""I didn't mean what I said so terribly seriously either. We misunderstood each other. That can happen occasionally even between old friends. "" Frau Grubach took her apron from her eyes to see whether K. were really appeased. "" Come now , that's all there was to it,"" said K., and then ventured to add, since to judge from Frau Grubach's expression her nephew the Captain could not have divulged anything: ""Do you really believe that I would turn against you because of a strange girl?"" ""That's just it, Herr K.,"" said Frau Grubach, it was her misfortune that as soon as she felt relieved in her mind she immediately said something tactless, ""I kept asking myself: Why should Herr K. bother himself so much about Fräulein Bürstner? Why should he quarrel with me because of her, though he knows that every cross word from him makes me lose my sleep? And I said nothing about the girl that I hadn't seen with my own eyes."" K. made no reply to this, he should have sent her from the room at the very first word, and he did not want to do that. He contented himself with drinking his coffee and leaving Frau Grubach to feel that her presence was burdensome. Outside he could hear again the trailing step of Fräulein Montag as she limped from end to end of the entrance hall. "" Do you hear that? "" asked K., indicating the door. "" Yes,"" said Frau Grubach, sighing, ""I offered to help her and to order the maid to help too, but she's self-willed, she insists on moving everything herself. I'm surprised at Fräulein Bürstner. I often regret having Fräulein Montag as a boarder, but now Fräulein Bürstner is actually taking her into her own room."" ""You mustn't worry about that,"" said K., crushing with the spoon the sugar left at the bottom of his cup. "" Does it mean any loss to you?"" ""No,"" said Frau Grubach, ""in itself it's quite welcome to me, I am left with an extra room, and I can put my nephew, the Captain, there. I've been bothered in case he might have disturbed you these last few days, for I had to let him occupy the living room next door. He's not very considerate."" ""What an idea !"" said K., getting up. ""There's no question of that. You really seem to think I'm hypersensitive because I can't stand Fräulein Montag's trailings to and fro -- there she goes again, coming back this time. "" Frau Grubach felt quite helpless. "" Shall I tell her, Herr K., to put off moving the rest of her things until later? If you like I'll do so at once."" ""But she's got to move into Fräulein Bürstner room ! "" cried K. "" Yes,"" said Frau Grubach, she could not quite make out what K. meant. "" Well then,"" said K., ""she must surely be allowed to shift her things there. "" Frau Grubach simply nodded. Her dumb helplessness, which outwardly had the look of simple obstinacy, exasperated K. still more. He began to walk up and down from the window to the door and back again, and by doing that he hindered Frau Grubach from being able to slip out of the room, which she would probably have done.","“Oh, don't cry Mrs. Grubach,” said K., looking out the window, he was thinking only of Miss Borstner and how she was accepting an unknown girl into her room. “Now don't cry,” he said again as he turned his look back into the room where Mrs. Grubach was still crying. “I meant no harm either when I said that. It was simply a misunderstanding between us. That can happen even between old friends sometimes.” Mrs. Grubach pulled her apron down to below her eyes to see whether K. really was attempting a reconciliation. “Well, yes, that's how it is,” said K., and as Mrs. Grubach's behaviour indicated that the captain had said nothing he dared to add, “Do you really think, then, that I'd want to make an enemy of you for the sake of a girl we hardly know?” “Yes, you're quite right, Mr. K.,” said Mrs. Grubach, and then, to her misfortune, as soon as she felt just a little freer to speak, she added something rather inept. “I kept asking myself why it was that Mr. K. took such an interest in Miss Borstner. Why does he quarrel with me over her when he knows that any cross word from him and I can't sleep that night? And I didn't say anything about Miss B�rstner that I hadn't seen with my own eyes.” K. said nothing in reply, he should have chased her from the room as soon as she had opened her mouth, and he didn't want to do that. He contented himself with merely drinking his coffee and letting Mrs. Grubach feel that she was superfluous. Outside, the dragging steps of Miss Montag could still be heard as she went from one side of the hallway to the other. “Do you hear that?” asked K. pointing his hand at the door. “Yes,” said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh, “I wanted to give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but she's stubborn , she wants to move everything in herself. I wonder at Miss Borstner. I often feel it's a burden for me to have Miss Montag as a tenant but Miss Borstner accepts her into her room with herself.” “There's nothing there for you to worry about” said K., crushing the remains of a sugar lump in his cup. “Does she cause you any trouble?” “No,” said Mrs. Grubach, “in itself it's very good to have her there, it makes another room free for me and I can let my nephew, the captain, occupy it. I began to worry he might be disturbing you when I had to let him live in the living room next to you over the last few days. He's not very considerate.” “What an idea!” said K. standing up, “there's no question of that. You seem to think that because I can't stand this to-ing and fro-ing of Miss Montag that I'm over-sensitive—and there she goes back again.” Mrs. Grubach appeared quite powerless. “Should I tell her to leave moving the rest of her things over till later, then, Mr. K.? If that's what you want I'll do it immediately.” “But she has to move in with Miss Borstner!” said K. “Yes,” said Mrs. Grubach, without quite understanding what K. meant. “So she has to take her things over there.” Mrs. Grubach just nodded. K. was irritated all the more by this dumb helplessness which, seen from the outside, could have seemed like a kind of defiance on her part. He began to walk up and down the room between the window and the door, thus depriving Mrs. Grubach of the chance to leave, which she otherwise probably would have done.","""Oh, don't cry Mrs. Grubach,"" said K., looking out the window, he was thinking only of Miss Bürstner and how she was accepting an unknown girl into her room.

"Der Maler hatte seinen Sessel näher zum Bett gezogen und fuhr mit gedämpfter Stimme fort: »Ich habe vergessen, Sie zunächst zu fragen, welche Art der Befreiung Sie wünschen. Es gibt drei Möglichkeiten, nämlich die wirkliche Freisprechung, die scheinbare Freisprechung und die Verschleppung. Die wirkliche Freisprechung ist natürlich das Beste, nur habe ich nicht den geringsten Einfluß auf diese Art der Lösung. Es gibt meiner Meinung nach überhaupt keine einzelne Person, die auf die wirkliche Freisprechung Einfluß hätte. Hier entscheidet wahrscheinlich nur die Unschuld des Angeklagten. Da Sie unschuldig sind, wäre es wirklich möglich, daß Sie sich allein auf Ihre Unschuld verlassen.

"Da erschreckte ihn ein Zuruf aus dem Nebenzimmer derartig, daß er mit den Zähnen ans Glas schlug. »Der Aufseher ruft Sie!« hieß es. Es war nur das Schreien, das ihn erschreckte, dieses kurze, abgehackte, militärische Schreien, das er dem Wächter Franz gar nicht zugetraut hätte. Der Befehl selbst war ihm sehr willkommen. »Endlich!« rief er zurück, versperrte den Wandschrank und eilte sofort ins Nebenzimmer. Dort standen die zwei Wächter und jagten ihn, als wäre das selbstverständlich, wieder in sein Zimmer zurück. »Was fällt Euch ein?« riefen sie. »Im Hemd wollt Ihr vor den Aufseher? Er läßt Euch durchprügeln und uns mit!« »Laßt mich, zum Teufel!« rief K., der schon bis zu seinem Kleiderkasten zurückgedrängt war, »wenn man mich im Bett überfällt, kann man nicht erwarten, mich im Festanzug zu finden.« »Es hilft nichts«, sagten die Wächter, die immer, wenn K. schrie, ganz ruhig, ja fast traurig wurden und ihn dadurch verwirrten oder gewissermaßen zur Besinnung brachten. »Lächerliche Zeremonien!« brummte er noch, hob aber schon einen Rock vom Stuhl und hielt ihn ein Weilchen mit beiden Händen, als unterbreite er ihn dem Urteil der Wächter. Sie schüttelten die Köpfe. »Es muß ein schwarzer Rock sein«, sagten sie. K. warf daraufhin den Rock zu Boden und sagte – er wußte selbst nicht, in welchem Sinne er es sagte –: »Es ist doch noch nicht die Hauptverhandlung.« Die Wächter lächelten, blieben aber bei ihrem: »Es muß ein schwarzer Rock sein.« »Wenn ich dadurch die Sache beschleunige, soll es mir recht sein«, sagte K., öffnete selbst den Kleiderkasten, suchte lange unter den vielen Kleidern, wählte sein bestes schwarzes Kleid, ein Jackettkleid, das durch seine Taille unter den Bekannten fast Aufsehen gemacht hatte, zog nun auch ein anderes Hemd hervor und begann, sich sorgfältig anzuziehen. Im geheimen glaubte er, eine Beschleunigung des Ganzen damit erreicht zu haben, daß die Wächter vergessen hatten, ihn zum Bad zu zwingen. Er beobachtete sie, ob sie sich vielleicht daran doch erinnern würden, aber das fiel ihnen natürlich gar nicht ein, dagegen vergaß Willem nicht, Franz mit der Meldung, daß sich K. anziehe, zum Aufseher zu schicken.","A shout from the next room startled him so much that he banged his teeth on the glass. ""The warden is calling you!"" they said. It was only the shouting that frightened him, this short, choppy, military shout that he wouldn't have believed the guard Franz capable of. The order itself was very welcome to him. ""Finally!"" he called back, locked the closet and immediately rushed into the next room. The two guards stood there and, as if that were a matter of course, chased him back to his room. ""What are you thinking of?"" they cried. “You want to see the supervisor in your shirt? He's going to beat you up and let us with him!"" ""Let me go, the hell!"" cried K., who had already been pushed back to his wardrobe, ""if they attack me in bed, you can't expect to find me in my formal suit."" ""It doesn't help,"" said the guards, who became very calm, almost sad, whenever K. screamed, thereby confusing him or bringing him to his senses, so to speak. ""Ridiculous ceremonies!"" he muttered, but he was already lifting a coat from the chair and holding it for a while with both hands, as if submitting it to the guards' judgment. They shook their heads. ""It must be a black coat,"" they said. K. then threw the coat on the ground and said—he didn't know himself what the meaning of that was—: ""It's not the main hearing yet."" The guards smiled, but stuck to theirs: ""It has to be a black coat ."" ""If I speed things up that way, I'll be fine,"" said K., opened the wardrobe himself, searched for a long time among the many dresses, chose his best black dress, a jacket dress that almost stood out among acquaintances because of its waist had caused a stir, pulled out another shirt and began to dress carefully. Secretly he thought he had speeded things up because the guards had forgotten to force him to take a bath. He watched them to see if they would perhaps remember, but of course that didn't occur to them, but Willem didn't forget to send Franz to the supervisor with the report that K. was getting dressed.","Then a shout from the adjoining room startled him so that he rattled his teeth on the glass. “The inspector wants you!” It was the cry alone that startled him: a short clipped military cry that he would never have expected from the guard Franz. The order itself he gladly welcomed: “It’s about time,” he called back, locked the cupboard, and hurried into the adjoining room. The two guards were standing there and, as if it were a matter of course, chased him back into his room. “What are you thinking of?” they cried. “Do you want to see the inspector in your nightshirt? He’ll have you soundly flogged and us along with you!” “Let go of me, damn you,” cried K., who was already pushed back against his wardrobe, “if you assault me in bed, you can hardly expect to find me in formal attire.” “It’s no use,” said the guards, who, whenever K. shouted at them, fell into a calm, almost sad state that either put him at a loss or restored him somewhat to his senses. “Ridiculous formalities!” he grumbled, but he was already lifting a coat from the chair and holding it up for a moment in both hands, as if submitting it to the judgment of the guards. They shook their heads. “It has to be a black coat,” they said. K. threw the coat to the floor in response and said—without knowing himself in what sense he meant it—: “But this isn’t the main hearing yet.” The guards smiled, but stuck to their words: “It has to be a black coat.” “If that will speed things up, it’s fine with me,” said K., opened the wardrobe himself, took his time going through his many clothes, selected his best black suit, an evening jacket that had caused a small sensation among his friends because it was so stylish, then changed his shirt as well and began dressing with care. He secretly believed he’d managed to speed up the whole process after all, for the guards had forgotten to make him bathe. He watched to see if they might recall it now, but of course it didn’t occur to them, although Willem did remember to send Franz to the inspector with the message that K. was getting dressed.","Then a shout came from the next room which made him start so violently that his teeth rattled against the glass. "" The Inspector wants you,"" was its tenor. It was merely the tone of it that startled him, a curt, military bark with which we would never have credited the warder Franz. The command itself was actually welcome to him. "" At last,"" he shouted back, closing the cupboard and hurrying at once into the next room. There the two warders were standing, and, as if that were a matter of course, immediately drove him back into his room again. ""What are you thinking of?"" they cried. ""Do you imagine you can appear before the Inspector in your shirt? He'll have you well thrashed, and us too."" ""Let me alone, damn you,"" cried K., who by now had been forced back to his wardrobe. ""If you grab me out of bed, you can't expect to find me all dressed up in my best suit."" ""That can't be helped,"" said the warders, who as soon as K. raised his voice always grew quite calm, indeed almost melancholy, and thus contrived either to confuse him or to some extent bring him to his senses. "" Silly formalities !"" he growled, but immediately lifted a coat from a chair and held it up for a little while in both hands, as if displaying it to the warders for their approval. They shook their heads. ""It must be a black coat,"" they said. Thereupon K. flung the coat on the floor and said -- he did not himself know in what sense he meant the words -- "" But this isn't the capital charge yet."" The warders smiled, but stuck to their: ""It must be a black coat."" ""If it's to dispatch my case any quicker, I don't mind,"" replied K., opening the wardrobe, where he searched for a long time among his many suits, chose his best black one, a lounge suit which had caused almost a sensation among his acquaintances because of its elegance, then selected another shirt and began to dress with great care. In his secret heart he thought he had managed after all to speed up the proceedings, for the warders had forgotten to make him take a bath. He kept an eye on them to see if they would remember the ducking, but of course it never occurred to them, yet on the other hand Willem did not forget to send Franz to the Inspector with the information that K. was dressing.","Then he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that he struck his teeth against the glass. “The supervisor wants to see you!” a voice said. It was only the shout that startled him, this curt, abrupt, military shout, that he would not have expected from the policeman called 'Franz'. In itself, he found the order very welcome. “At last!” he called back, locked the cupboard and, without delay, hurried into the next room. The two policemen were standing there and chased him back into his bedroom as if that were a matter of course. “What d'you think you're doing?” they cried. “Think you're going to see the supervisor dressed in just your shirt, do you? He'd see to it you got a right thumping, and us and all!” “Let go of me for God's sake!” called K., who had already been pushed back as far as his wardrobe, “if you accost me when I'm still in bed you can't expect to find me in my evening dress.” “That won't help you,” said the policemen, who always became very quiet, almost sad, when K. began to shout, and in that way confused him or, to some extent, brought him to his senses. “Ridiculous formalities!” he grumbled, as he lifted his coat from the chair and kept it in both his hands for a little while, as if holding it out for the policemen's inspection. They shook their heads. “It's got to be a black coat,” they said. At that, K. threw the coat to the floor and said—without knowing even himself what he meant by it—“Well it's not going to be the main trial, after all.” The policemen laughed, but continued to insist, “It's got to be a black coat.” “Well that's alright by me if it makes things go any faster,” said K. He opened the wardrobe himself, spent a long time searching through all the clothes, and chose his best black suit which had a short jacket that had greatly surprised those who knew him, then he also pulled out a fresh shirt and began, carefully, to get dressed. He secretly told himself that he had succeeded in speeding things up by letting the policemen forget to make him have a bath. He watched them to see if they might remember after all, but of course it never occurred to them, although Willem did not forget to send Franz up to the supervisor with the message saying that K. was getting dressed.","Then he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that he struck his teeth against the glass.

"Als er vollständig angezogen war, mußte er knapp vor Willem durch das leere Nebenzimmer in das folgende Zimmer gehen, dessen Tür mit beiden Flügeln bereits geöffnet war. Dieses Zimmer wurde, wie K. genau wußte, seit kurzer Zeit von einem Fräulein Bürstner, einer Schreibmaschinistin, bewohnt, die sehr früh in die Arbeit zu gehen pflegte, spät nach Hause kam und mit der K. nicht viel mehr als die Grußworte gewechselt hatte. Jetzt war das Nachttischchen von ihrem Bett als Verhandlungstisch in die Mitte des Zimmers gerückt, und der Aufseher saß hinter ihm. Er hatte die Beine übereinandergeschlagen und einen Arm auf die Rückenlehne des Stuhles gelegt.","When he was fully dressed, he had to walk just ahead of Willem through the empty adjoining room into the next room, both doors of which were already open.

"»Verzeihen Sie«, sagte der Maler, als er zu K. wieder zurückkehrte. K. hatte sich kaum zur Tür hingewendet, er hatte es vollständig dem Maler überlassen, ob und wie er ihn in Schutz nehmen wollte. Er machte auch jetzt kaum eine Bewegung, als sich der Maler zu ihm niederbeugte und ihm, um draußen nicht gehört zu werden, ins Ohr flüsterte: »Auch diese Mädchen gehören zum Gericht.« »Wie?« fragte K., wich mit dem Kopf zur Seite und sah den Maler an. Dieser aber setzte sich wieder auf seinen Sessel und sagte halb im Scherz, halb zur Erklärung: »Es gehört ja alles zum Gericht.« »Das habe ich noch nicht bemerkt«, sagte K. kurz, die allgemeine Bemerkung des Malers nahm dem Hinweis auf die Mädchen alles Beunruhigende.

Und wieder Bravo!« Die in der ersten Reihe griffen hier und da in ihre Bärte, keiner kehrte sich wegen des Ausrufs um. Auch K. maß ihm keine Bedeutung bei, war aber doch aufgemuntert; er hielt es jetzt gar nicht mehr für nötig, daß alle Beifall klatschten, es genügte, wenn die Allgemeinheit über die Sache nachzudenken begann und nur manchmal einer durch Überredung gewonnen wurde.","He had involuntarily raised his voice. Somewhere someone clapped their hands up and shouted, “Bravo! Why not? Bravo! Bravo again!' Those in the front row touched their beards here and there, no one looking back at the exclamation. K. didn't attach any importance to him either, but he was cheered up; he no longer considered it necessary for everyone to applaud, it was enough if the general public began to think about the matter and only occasionally one was won over by persuasion.","He had instinctively raised his voice. Someone clapped somewhere with raised hands and cried out: “Bravo! Why not? Bravo! And encore bravo!” Those in the front row pulled at their beards now and then; no one turned around at the cry. Nor did K. grant it any importance, yet it cheered him; he no longer considered it necessary for everyone to applaud, it was enough that the audience in general was beginning to think the matter over and that someone was occasionally won over by his words.","He had involuntarily raised his voice. Someone in the audience clapped his hands high in the air and shouted: ""Bravo! Why not? Bravo! And bravo again!"" A few men in the first row pulled at their beards, but none turned round at this interruption. K., too, did not attach any importance to it, yet felt cheered nevertheless; he no longer considered it necessary to get applause from everyone, he would be quite pleased if he could make the audience start thinking about the question and win a man here and there through conviction.","Without having intended it, he had raised his voice. Somewhere in the hall, someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting, “Bravo! Why not then? Bravo! Again I say, Bravo!” Some of the men in the first row groped around in their beards, none of them looked round to see who was shouting. Not even K. thought him of any importance but it did raise his spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all of those in the hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majority of them began to think about the matter and if only one of them, now and then, was persuaded.","Without having intended it, he had raised his voice.

"K. hatte sich entschlossen, mehr zu beobachten als zu reden, infolgedessen verzichtete er auf die Verteidigung wegen seines angeblichen Zuspätkommens und sagte bloß: »Mag ich zu spät gekommen sein, jetzt bin ich hier.« Ein Beifallklatschen, wieder aus der rechten Saalhälfte, folgte. Leicht zu gewinnende Leute, dachte K. und war nur gestört durch die Stille in der linken Saalhälfte, die gerade hinter ihm lag und aus der sich nur ganz vereinzeltes Händeklatschen erhoben hatte. Er dachte nach, was er sagen könnte, um alle auf einmal oder, wenn das nicht möglich sein sollte, wenigstens zeitweilig auch die anderen zu gewinnen.","K. had decided to observe more than to talk, so he refrained from defending himself because of his alleged lateness and simply said: ""I may have been late, now I'm here."" Applause, again from the right half of the room, followed. People who are easy to win over, thought K., and was only disturbed by the silence in the left half of the room, which lay just behind him and from which only very isolated clapping of hands had arisen. He thought about what he could say to win everyone over at once, or if that wasn't possible, at least temporarily win over the others as well.","K. had decided to observe more than speak, and therefore waived any defense of his supposedly late arrival, merely saying: “I may have arrived late, but I’m here now.” A burst of applause followed, once again from the right half of the hall. “These people are easily won over,” thought K. and was only disturbed by the silence in the left half of the hall, which lay immediately behind him and from which only thinly scattered applause had arisen. He considered what he might say to win all of them over at once, or if that was not possible, at least to win the others for the time being.","K. made up his mind to observe rather than speak, consequently he offered no defense of his alleged lateness in arriving and merely said: ""Whether I am late or not, I am here now. "" A burst of applause followed, once more from the right side of the hail. ""These people are easy to win over,"" thought K., disturbed only by the silence in the left half of the room, which lay just behind him and from which only one or two isolated handclaps had come. He considered what he should say to win over the whole of the audience once and for all, or if that were not possible, at least to win over most of them for the time being.","K. had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he did not defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said, “Well maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now.” There followed loud applause, once more from the right hand side of the hall. Easy people to get on your side, thought K., and was bothered only by the quiet from the left hand side which was directly behind him and from which there was applause from only a few individuals. He wondered what he could say to get all of them to support him together or, if that were not possible, to at least get the support of the others for a while.","K. had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he did not defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said, ""Well maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now.

"Es war ein sehr regnerischer, stürmischer Morgen, als K. voll Ärger über den Tag, der ihm bevorstand, schon um sieben Uhr ins Büro kam, um wenigstens einige Arbeit noch fertigzubringen, ehe der Besuch ihn allem entziehen würde. Er war sehr müde, denn er hatte die halbe Nacht mit dem Studium einer italienischen Grammatik verbracht, um sich ein wenig vorzubereiten; das Fenster, an dem er in der letzten Zeit viel zu oft zu sitzen pflegte, lockte ihn mehr als der Schreibtisch, aber er widerstand und setzte sich zur Arbeit. Leider trat gerade der Diener ein und meldete, der Herr Direktor habe ihn geschickt, um nachzusehen, ob der Herr Prokurist schon hier sei; sei er hier, dann möge er so freundlich sein und ins Empfangszimmer hinüberkommen, der Herr aus Italien sei schon da. »Ich komme schon«, sagte K., steckte ein kleines Wörterbuch in die Tasche, nahm ein Album der städtischen Sehenswürdigkeiten, das er für den Fremden vorbereitet hatte, unter den Arm und ging durch das Büro des Direktor-Stellvertreters in das Direktionszimmer. Er war glücklich darüber, so früh ins Büro gekommen zu sein und sofort zur Verfügung stehen zu können was wohl niemand ernstlich erwartet hatte. Das Büro des Direktor-Stellvertreters war natürlich noch leer wie in tiefer Nacht, wahrscheinlich hatte der Diener auch ihn ins Empfangszimmer berufen sollen, es war aber erfolglos gewesen. Als K. ins Empfangszimmer eintrat, erhoben sich die zwei Herren aus den tiefen Fauteuils. Der Direktor lächelte freundlich, offenbar war er sehr erfreut über K.s Kommen, er besorgte sofort die Vorstellung, der Italiener schüttelte K. kräftig die Hand und nannte lächelnd irgend jemanden einen Frühaufsteher. K. verstand nicht genau, wen er meinte, es war überdies ein sonderbares Wort, dessen Sinn K. erst nach einem Weilchen erriet. Er antwortete mit einigen glatten Sätzen, die der Italiener wieder lachend hinnahm, wobei er mehrmals mit nervöser Hand über seinen graublauen, buschigen Schnurrbart fuhr. Dieser Bart war offenbar parfümiert, man war fast versucht, sich zu nähern und zu riechen. Als sich alle gesetzt hatten und ein kleines, einleitendes Gespräch begann, bemerkte K. mit großem Unbehagen, daß er den Italiener nur bruchstückweise verstand. Wenn er ganz ruhig sprach, verstand er ihn fast vollständig, das waren aber nur seltene Ausnahmen, meistens quoll ihm die Rede aus dem Mund, er schüttelte den Kopf wie vor Lust darüber. Bei solchen Reden aber verwickelte er sich regelmäßig in irgendeinen Dialekt, der für K. nichts Italienisches mehr hatte, den aber der Direktor nicht nur verstand, sondern auch sprach, was K. allerdings hätte voraussehen können, denn der Italiener stammte aus Süditalien, wo auch der Direktor einige Jahre gewesen war. Jedenfalls erkannte K., daß ihm die Möglichkeit, sich mit dem Italiener zu verständigen, zum größten Teil genommen war, denn auch dessen Französisch war nur schwerverständlich, auch verdeckte der Bart die Lippenbewegungen, deren Anblick vielleicht zum Verständnis geholfen hätte. K. begann viel Unannehmlichkeiten vorauszusehen, vorläufig gab er es auf, den Italiener verstehen zu wollen – in der Gegenwart des Direktors, der ihn so leicht verstand, wäre es unnötige Anstrengung gewesen –, und er beschränkte sich darauf, ihn verdrießlich zu beobachten, wie er tief und doch leicht in dem Fauteuil ruhte, wie er öfters an seinem kurzen, scharf geschnittenen Röckchen zupfte und wie er einmal mit erhobenen Armen und lose in den Gelenken bewegten Händen irgend etwas darzustellen versuchte, das K. nicht begreifen konnte, obwohl er vorgebeugt die Hände nicht aus den Augen ließ. Schließlich machte sich bei K., der sonst unbeschäftigt, nur mechanisch mit den Blicken dem Hin und Her der Reden folgte, die frühere Müdigkeit geltend, und er ertappte sich einmal zu seinem Schrecken, glücklicherweise noch rechtzeitig, dabei, daß er in der Zerstreutheit gerade hatte aufstehen, sich umdrehen und weggehen wollen. Endlich sah der Italiener auf die Uhr und sprang auf. Nachdem er sich vom Direktor verabschiedet hatte, drängte er sich an K., und zwar so dicht, daß K. seinen Fauteuil zurückschieben mußte, um sich bewegen zu können. Der Direktor, der gewiß an K.s Augen die Not erkannte, in der er sich gegenüber diesem Italienisch befand, mischte sich in das Gespräch, und zwar so klug und so zart, daß es den Anschein hatte, als füge er nur kleine Ratschläge bei, während er in Wirklichkeit alles, was der Italiener, unermüdlich ihm in die Rede fallend, vorbrachte, in aller Kürze K. verständlich machte. K. erfuhr von ihm, daß der Italiener vorläufig noch einige Geschäfte zu besorgen habe, daß er leider auch im ganzen nur wenig Zeit haben werde, daß er auch keinesfalls beabsichtige, in Eile alle Sehenswürdigkeiten abzulaufen, daß er sich vielmehr – allerdings nur, wenn K. zustimme, bei ihm allein liege die Entscheidung – entschlossen habe, nur den Dom, diesen aber gründlich, zu besichtigen. Er freue sich ungemein, diese Besichtigung in Begleitung eines so gelehrten und liebenswürdigen Mannes – damit war K. gemeint, der mit nichts anderem beschäftigt war, als den Italiener zu überhören und die Worte des Direktors schnell aufzufassen – vornehmen zu können, und er bitte ihn, wenn ihm die Stunde gelegen sei, in zwei Stunden, etwa um zehn Uhr, sich im Dom einzufinden. Er selbst hoffe, um diese Zeit schon bestimmt dort sein zu können. K. antwortete einiges Entsprechende, der Italiener drückte zuerst dem Direktor, dann K., dann nochmals dem Direktor die Hand und ging, von beiden gefolgt, nur noch halb ihnen zugewendet, im Reden aber noch immer nicht aussetzend, zur Tür. K. blieb dann noch ein Weilchen mit dem Direktor beisammen, der heute besonders leidend aussah. Er glaubte, sich bei K. irgendwie entschuldigen zu müssen und sagte – sie standen vertraulich nahe beisammen –, zuerst hätte er beabsichtigt, selbst mit dem Italiener zu gehen, dann aber – er gab keinen näheren Grund an – habe er sich entschlossen, lieber K. zu schicken. Wenn er den Italiener nicht gleich im Anfang verstehe, so müsse er sich dadurch nicht verblüffen lassen, das Verständnis komme sehr rasch, und wenn er auch viel überhaupt nicht verstehen sollte, so sei es auch nicht so schlimm, denn für den Italiener sei es nicht gar so wichtig, verstanden zu werden. Übrigens sei K.s Italienisch überraschend gut, und er werde sich gewiß ausgezeichnet mit der Sache abfinden. Damit war K. verabschiedet. Die Zeit, die ihm noch freiblieb, verbrachte er damit, seltene Vokabeln, die er zur Führung im Dom benötigte, aus dem Wörterbuch herauszuschreiben. Es war eine äußerst lästige Arbeit, Diener brachten die Post, Beamte kamen mit verschiedenen Anfragen und blieben, da sie K. beschäftigt sahen, bei der Tür stehen, rührten sich aber nicht weg, bevor sie K. angehört hatte, der Direktor-Stellvertreter ließ es sich nicht entgehen, K. zu stören, kam öfters herein, nahm ihm das Wörterbuch aus der Hand und blätterte offenbar ganz sinnlos darin, selbst Parteien tauchten, wenn sich die Tür öffnete, im Halbdunkel des Vorzimmers auf und verbeugten sich zögernd – sie wollten auf sich aufmerksam machen, waren aber dessen nicht sicher, ob sie gesehen wurden –, das alles bewegte sich um K. als um seinen Mittelpunkt, während er selbst die Wörter, die er brauchte, zusammenstellte, dann im Wörterbuch suchte, dann herausschrieb, dann ihre Aussprache übte und schließlich auswendig zu lernen versuchte. Sein früheres gutes Gedächtnis schien ihn aber ganz verlassen zu haben, manchmal wurde er auf den Italiener, der ihm diese Anstrengung verursachte, so wütend, daß er das Wörterbuch unter Papieren vergrub, mit der festen Absicht, sich nicht mehr vorzubereiten, dann aber sah er ein, daß er doch nicht stumm mit dem Italiener vor den Kunstwerken im Dom auf und ab gehen könne, und er zog mit noch größerer Wut das Wörterbuch wieder hervor.","It was a very rainy, stormy morning when K. came to the office at seven o'clock, angry about the day ahead of him, in order to get at least some work done before the visit would deprive him of everything. He was very tired, for he had spent half the night studying an Italian grammar to prepare himself a little; the window, by which he used to sit far too often lately, lured him more than the desk, but he resisted and sat down to work. Unfortunately, the servant just came in and reported that the manager had sent him to see if the manager was already here; if he was here, then he should be so kind as to come over to the reception room, the gentleman from Italy was already there. ""I'm coming,"" said K., put a small dictionary in his pocket, took an album of the sights of the city that he had prepared for the stranger under his arm, and went through the deputy director's office to the director's office. He was happy to be able to get into the office so early and be available immediately, which no one seriously expected. The deputy director's office was of course still empty, like it had been the middle of the night; the servant probably should have summoned him to the reception room too, but it had been unsuccessful. When K. entered the reception room, the two gentlemen got up from the deep armchairs. The manager smiled friendly, he was obviously very pleased that K. was coming, he got the introduction straight away, the Italian shook K.'s hand vigorously and, with a smile, called someone an early riser. K. didn't understand exactly whom he meant, and it was also a strange word, which K. only guessed after a while. He replied with a few smooth sentences, which the Italian accepted again with a laugh, nervously stroking his grey-blue, bushy mustache several times. This beard was obviously perfumed, one was almost tempted to approach and smell it. When everyone had sat down and a short, introductory conversation began, K. noticed with great uneasiness that he only understood fragments of the Italian. When he spoke very calmly, he understood him almost completely, but these were only rare exceptions, most of the time the speech spilled out of his mouth and he shook his head as if with pleasure. But during such speeches he regularly got mixed up in some dialect that, for K., no longer had anything Italian about it, but which the director not only understood but also spoke, which K. could have foreseen, because the Italian came from southern Italy, wherever who had been director for some years. In any case, K. realized that he had lost most of the opportunity to communicate with the Italian, because his French was also difficult to understand, and the beard also covered the movements of his lips, the sight of which might have helped understanding. K. began to anticipate a great deal of trouble, for the time being he gave up trying to understand the Italian—in the presence of the director, who understood him so easily, it would have been an unnecessary effort—and he confined himself to watching him angrily as he did he rested deeply and yet lightly in the armchair, as he often tugged at his short, sharply cut skirt and as he once tried to portray something with raised arms and hands loosely moving at the joints that K. could not understand, even though he was leaning forward never let your hands out of your sight. Finally, K., who was otherwise idle, only mechanically following the back and forth of the speeches with his eyes, made itself felt in the past, and to his horror he caught himself, fortunately in time, in the midst of his absent-mindedness wanted to get up, turn and walk away. Finally the Italian looked at his watch and jumped up. After he had said goodbye to the headmaster, he pressed himself against K. so closely that K. had to push back his armchair in order to be able to move. The manager, who must have recognized from K.'s eyes the difficulty he was in when dealing with this Italian, joined in the conversation so intelligently and so gently that it seemed as if he was only adding small pieces of advice while In fact, he made K. understand very briefly everything that the Italian said, tirelessly interrupting him. K. learned from him that the Italian still had some business to take care of for the time being, that unfortunately he would only have little time overall, that he had no intention of rushing to see all the sights, that he would rather - but only if K. agrees, the decision is his alone – I have decided to visit only the cathedral, but thoroughly. He was immensely pleased to be able to make this tour in the company of such a learned and amiable man - by that he meant K., who was busy with nothing else than overhearing the Italian and quickly grasping the director's words - and he begs him , if the hour suits him, in two hours, around ten o'clock, to go to the cathedral. He himself hopes to be there by this time. K. answered something to the effect, the Italian shook hands first with the manager, then K., then with the manager again and, followed by both of them, only half turned towards them, but still not stopping to speak, walked to the door. K. then stayed with the director for a while, who looked particularly ill today. He thought he had to apologize to K. in some way and said - they were standing close to each other - that at first he had intended to go with the Italian himself, but then - he gave no further reason - he had decided, dear K . to send. If he didn't understand the Italian right from the start, he shouldn't be taken aback by that, understanding came very quickly, and even if he didn't understand a lot at all, it wasn't that bad either, because it wasn't for the Italian so important to be understood. Incidentally, K.'s Italian was surprisingly good and I'm sure he'd come to terms with it very well. With that, K. was dismissed. He spent the time he still had free copying from the dictionary rare vocabulary that he needed for the tour of the cathedral. It was extremely tiresome work, servants brought the mail, officials came with various inquiries and, seeing K. busy, stayed by the door, but didn't move until they had heard K., who left the deputy director couldn't avoid disturbing K., came in often, took the dictionary from his hand and leafed through it apparently pointlessly, even parties would appear in the half-darkness of the anteroom when the door opened and bow hesitantly - they wanted to draw attention to themselves, but weren't sure if they would be seen - it all revolved around K. as its center as he himself put together the words he needed, then looked them up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then practiced her pronunciation and finally tried to learn it by heart. His good memory, however, seemed to have left him completely, sometimes he got so angry with the Italian who caused him this effort that he buried the dictionary under papers with the firm intention of not preparing himself any more, but then he saw agreed that he couldn't walk up and down silently with the Italian in front of the works of art in the cathedral, and with even greater anger he pulled out the dictionary again.","It was a very wet and windy morning as K., full of irritation at the day before him, entered his office at seven o’clock in hopes of accomplishing at least some work before the visitor took him away from everything. He was very tired, having spent half the night preparing himself somewhat by poring over an Italian grammar; the window at which he was accustomed to sit all too often in recent days attracted him more than his desk, but he resisted and sat down to work. Unfortunately his assistant entered immediately and announced that the president had asked him to see if K. was in yet; if he was, would he be so kind as to come over to the reception room, since the gentleman from Italy had already arrived. “I’ll be right there,” said K., stuck a small dictionary in his pocket, tucked an album of city sights he had brought for the visitor under his arm, and walked through the vice president’s office into the head office. He was happy that he’d arrived at the office so early and was immediately available, which no one could seriously have expected. The vice president’s office was still empty of course, as in the depths of night; the assistant had probably been asked to call him to the reception room too, but without success. As K. entered the reception room the two men rose from their deep armchairs. The president wore a friendly smile and was obviously delighted at K.’s arrival; he handled the introductions at once, the Italian shook K.’s hand warmly, and laughingly called someone an early riser; K. wasn’t sure exactly whom he meant, for it was an odd expression, and it took K. a moment or so to guess its sense. He answered with a few smooth sentences that the Italian responded to with another laugh, nervously stroking his bushy, gray-blue mustache several times. This mustache was obviously perfumed, one was almost tempted to draw near and sniff it. When they were all seated and had launched into a brief preliminary conversation, K. realized with discomfort that he understood only bits and pieces of what the Italian was saying. When he spoke slowly, he could understand almost everything, but those were rare exceptions; for the most part the words literally poured from his lips, and he shook his head in seeming pleasure as they did so. At such times, however, he kept falling into some dialect or other that didn’t really sound like Italian to K., but that the president not only understood but also spoke, something K. should have predicted, of course, since the Italian came from southern Italy, and the president had spent a few years there himself. At any rate K. realized he would have little chance of understanding the Italian, for his French was hard to follow too, and his mustache hid the movement of his lips, the sight of which might otherwise have helped him out. K. began to foresee various difficulties; for the moment he’d given up trying to follow the Italian—given the presence of the president, who understood him so easily, it was an unnecessary strain—and limited himself to observing peevishly the way he sat so deeply yet lightly in the armchair, how he tugged repeatedly at his short, sharply tailored jacket, and how once, lifting his arms and fluttering his hands, he tried to describe something K. couldn’t quite follow, even though he leaned forward and stared at his hands. In the end K., who was now simply glancing mechanically back and forth during the conversation, began to fall prey to his earlier fatigue and at one point to his horror caught himself, just in time fortunately, starting to rise absentmindedly, turn around, and leave. Finally the Italian glanced at his watch and jumped up. After he had taken leave of the president, he pressed up so near to K. that K. had to shove his armchair back in order to move at all. The president, who had surely seen in K.’s eyes the difficulty in which he found himself with the Italian, intervened in their conversation so delicately and cleverly that it seemed as if he were only making minor suggestions, while in reality he was succinctly conveying the sense of everything the Italian, who kept on interrupting him, was saying. K. gathered from him that the Italian still had a few business errands to attend to, that his time was unfortunately limited, that it was certainly not his intention to try to rush through every sight, and that he had decided—provided, of course, it met with K.’s approval, the decision was entirely up to him—to visit just the cathedral, but to take a really good look at it. He was looking forward to visiting it in the company of such a learned and amiable companion—by this he meant K., who was interested in nothing but trying to tune out the Italian and quickly grasp the president’s words— and if it was convenient, he would like to meet him at the cathedral about two hours from now, say around ten. He thought he could surely make it there by then. K. responded appropriately, the Italian shook hands, first with the president, then with K., then with the president again, and walked to the door accompanied by them both, still half turned to them, not quite finished talking even yet. K. remained for a short time with the president, who appeared to be feeling worse than usual today. He thought he owed some sort of apology to K. and said—they were standing in close intimacy—that at first he’d intended to accompany the Italian himself, but then—he offered no specific reason why—he’d decided to send K. instead. If he didn’t understand the Italian at first, he mustn’t let that bother him, he would soon begin to catch on, and even if there was a lot he didn’t understand, that wouldn’t be so terrible, since it really didn’t matter that much to the Italian whether anyone understood him or not. Moreover, K.’s Italian was surprisingly good and he was certain everything would go fine. With that K. was dismissed. He spent his remaining free time copying down various special terms he would need for the tour of the cathedral from the dictionary. It was a terribly tedious task; assistants brought in mail, clerks came with various inquiries, pausing at the door when they saw K. was busy, but refusing to stir until K. had heard them out, the vice president missed no opportunity to disturb K., entering several times, taking the dictionary from his hand and leafing through it, obviously at random; clients even appeared in the semidarkness of the waiting room when the door opened, bowing hesitantly, trying to attract his attention, but unsure whether or not they had been seen—all this revolved around K. as if he were an axis, while he himself listed the words he would need, looked them up in the dictionary, copied them down, practiced pronouncing them, and finally tried to learn them by heart. But his once excellent memory seemed to have abandoned him totally; at times he got so mad at the Italian for causing all this trouble that he buried the dictionary under stacks of paper with the firm intention of making no further preparations; but then he would realize that he couldn’t just parade past the artworks in the cathedral in total silence with the Italian, and he would pull the dictionary out again in even greater rage.","It was a very wet and windy morning when K. arrived in his office at the early hour of seven o'clock, full of irritation at the program before him, but determined to accomplish at least some work before being distracted from it by the visitor. He was very tired, for he had spent half the night studying an Italian grammar as some slight preparation; he was more tempted by the window, where he had recently been in the habit of spending too much time, than by his desk, but he resisted the temptation and sat down to work. Unfortunately at that very moment the attendant appeared, reporting that he had been sent by the Manager to see if the Chief Clerk was in his office yet, and, if he was, to beg him to be so good as to come to the reception room; the gentleman from Italy had already arrived. ""All right,"" said K., stuffed a small dictionary into his pocket, tucked under his arm an album for sightseers, which he had procured in readiness for the stranger, and went through the Assistant Manager's office into the Manager's room. He was glad that he had turned up early enough to be on the spot immediately when required; probably no one had really expected him to do so. The Assistant Manager's office, of course, was as empty as in the dead of night; very likely the attendant had been told to summon him too, and without result. When K. entered the reception room the two gentlemen rose from their deep armchairs. The Manager smiled kindly on K., he was obviously delighted to see him, he performed the introduction at once, the Italian shook K. heartily by the hand and said laughingly that someone was an early riser. K. did not quite catch whom he meant, for it was an unfamiliar phrase the sense of which did not dawn on him at once. He answered with a few fluent sentences which the Italian received with another laugh, meanwhile nervously stroking his bushy iron-gray mustache. This mustache was obviously perfumed; one was almost tempted to go. close up and have a sniff at it. When they all sat down again and a preliminary conversation began, K. was greatly disconcerted to find that he only partly understood what the Italian was saying. He could understand him almost completely when he spoke slowly and quietly, but that happened very seldom, the words mostly came pouring out in a flood, and he made lively gestures with his head as if enjoying the rush of talk. Besides, when this happened, he invariably relapsed into a dialect which K. did not recognize as Italian but which the Manager could both speak and understand, as indeed K. might have expected, considering that this Italian came from the very south of Italy, where the Manager had spent several years. At any rate, it became clear to K. that there was little chance of communication with the Italian, for the man's French was difficult to follow and it was no use watching his lips for clues, since their movements were covered by the bushy mustache. K. began to foresee vexations and for the moment gave up trying to follow the talk -- while the Manager was present to understand all that was said it was an unnecessary effort to make -- confining himself to morose observation of the Italian lounging so comfortably and yet lightly in his armchair, tugging every now and then at the sharply peaked corners of his short little jacket, and once raising his arms with loosely fluttering hands to explain something * which K. found it impossible to understand, although he was leaning forward to watch every gesture. In the end, as K. sat there taking no part in the conversation, only mechanically following with his eyes the see-saw of the dialogue, his earlier weariness made itself felt again, and to his horror, although fortunately just in time, he caught himself absent-mindedly rising to turn round and walk away. At long last the Italian looked at his watch and sprang to his feet. After taking leave of the Manager he pressed up to K. so close that K. had to push his chair back in order to have any freedom of movement. The Manager, doubtless seeing in K.'s eye that he was in desperate straits with this unintelligible Italian, intervened so cleverly and delicately that it appeared as if he were merely contributing little scraps of advice, while in reality he was briefly conveying to K. the sense of all the remarks with which the Italian kept on interrupting him. In this way K. learned that the Italian had some immediate business to attend to, that unfortunately he was pressed for time, that he had no intention of rushing round to see all the sights in a hurry, that he would much rather -- of course only if K. agreed, the decision lay with K. alone -- confine himself to inspecting the Cathedral, but to inspect that thoroughly. He was extremely delighted to have the chance of doing so in the company of such a learned and amiable gentleman -- this was how he referred to K., who was trying hard to turn a deaf ear to his words and grasp as quickly as possible what the Manager was saying -- and he begged him, if it were convenient, to meet him there in a couple of hours, say at about ten o'clock. He had hopes of being able to arrive there for certain about that time. K. made a suitable rejoinder, the Italian pressed the Manager's hand, then K.'s hand, then the Manager's hand again, and, followed by both of them, turning only half toward them by this time but still maintaining a flow of words, departed toward the door. K. stayed a moment or two with the Manager, who was looking particularly unwell that day. He felt that he owed K. an apology and said -- they were standing intimately together -- that he had at first intended to escort the Italian himself, but on second thoughts -- he gave no definite reason -- he had decided that K. had better go. If K. found that he could not understand the man to begin with he mustn't let that upset him, for he wouldn't take long to catch the sense of what was said, and even if he didn't understand very much it hardly mattered, since the Italian cared little whether he was understood or not. Besides, K.'s knowledge of Italian was surprisingly good and he would certainly acquit himself well. With that K. was dismissed to his room. The time still at his disposal he devoted to copying from the dictionary various unfamiliar words which he would need in his tour of the Cathedral. It was an unusually exasperating task; attendants came in with letters, clerks arrived with inquiries, standing in the doorway when they saw that K. was busy, yet not removing themselves until he answered, the Assistant Manager did not miss the chance of making a nuisance of himself and appeared several times, taking the dictionary out of K.'s hand and with obvious indifference turning the pages over; even clients were dimly visible in the antechamber whenever the door opened, making deprecating bows to call attention to themselves, but uncertain whether they had been remarked or not -- all this activity rotated around K. as if he were the center of it, while he himself was occupied in collecting the words he might need, looking them up in the dictionary, copying them out, practicing their pronunciation, and finally trying to learn them by heart. His once excellent memory seemed to have deserted him, and every now and then he grew so furious with the Italian who was causing him all this trouble that he stuffed the dictionary beneath a pile of papers with the firm intention of preparing himself no further, yet he could not help seeing that it would not do to march the Italian round the art treasures of the Cathedral in dumb silence, and so with even greater rage he took the dictionary out again.","It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K., in a foul temper at the thought of the day ahead of him, arrived early at seven o'clock in the office so that he could at least do some work before his visitor would prevent him. He had spent half the night studying a book of Italian grammar so that he would be somewhat prepared and was very tired; his desk was less attractive to him than the window where he had spent far too much time sitting of late, but he resisted the temptation and sat down to his work. Unfortunately, just then the servitor came in and reported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief clerk was already in his office; if he was, then would he please be so kind as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was already there. “I'll come straight away,” said K. He put a small dictionary in his pocket, took a guide to the city's tourist sites under his arm that he had compiled for strangers, and went through the deputy director's office into that of the director. He was glad he had come into the office so early and was able to be of service immediately, nobody could seriously have expected that of him. The deputy director's office was, of course, still as empty as the middle of the night, the servitor had probably been asked to summon him too but without success. As K. entered the reception room two men stood up from the deep armchairs where they had been sitting. The director gave him a friendly smile, he was clearly very glad that K. was there , he immediately introduced him to the Italian who shook K.'s hand vigorously and joked that somebody was an early riser. K. did not quite understand whom he had in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use and it took K. a little while to guess its meaning. He replied with a few bland phrases which the Italian received once more with a laugh, passing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his blue-grey, bushy moustache. This moustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting to come close to it and sniff. When they had all sat down and begun a light preliminary conversation, K. was disconcerted to notice that he understood no more than fragments of what the Italian said. When he spoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was very infrequent, mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be enjoying himself so much his head shook. When he was talking in this way his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which seemed to K. to have nothing to do with Italian but which the director not only understood but also spoke, although K. ought to have foreseen this as the Italian came from the south of his country where the director had also spent several years. Whatever the cause, K. realised that the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely taken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and his moustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered some help in understanding what he said. K. began to anticipate many difficulties, he gave up trying to understand what the Italian said—with the director there, who could understand him so easily, it would have been pointless effort—and for the time being did no more than scowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in the armchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored jacket and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands freely to try and depict something that K. could not grasp, even though he was leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight. K. had nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange between the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his alarm, although fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly getting up, turning round and leaving. Eventually the Italian looked at the clock and jumped up. After taking his leave from the director he turned to K., pressing himself so close to him that K. had to push his chair back just so that he could move. The director had, no doubt, seen the anxiety in K.'s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of Italian, he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so adroit and unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor comments, whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into what the Italian said so that K. could understand. K. learned in this way that the Italian first had a few business matters to settle, that he unfortunately had only a little time at his disposal, that he certainly did not intend to rush round to see every monument in the city, that he would much rather—at least as long as K. would agree , it was entirely his decision—just see the cathedral and to do so thoroughly. He was extremely pleased to be accompanied by someone who was so learned and so pleasant—by this he meant K., who was occupied not with listening to the Italian but the director—and asked if he would be so kind, if the time was suitable, to meet him in the cathedral in two hours' time at about ten o'clock. He hoped he would certainly be able to be there at that time. K. made an appropriate reply, the Italian shook first the director's hand and then K.'s, then the director's again and went to the door, half turned to the two men who followed him and continuing to talk without a break. K. remained together with the director for a short while, although the director looked especially unhappy today. He thought he needed to apologise to K. for something and told him—they were standing intimately close together—he had thought at first he would accompany the Italian himself, but then—he gave no more precise reason than this —then he decided it would be better to send K. with him. He should not be surprised if he could not understand the Italian at first, he would be able to very soon, and even if he really could not understand very much he said it was not so bad, as it was really not so important for the Italian to be understood. And anyway, K.'s knowledge of Italian was surprisingly good, the director was sure he would get by very well. And with that, it was time for K. to go. He spent the time still remaining to him with a dictionary, copying out obscure words he would need to guide the Italian round the cathedral. It was an extremely irksome task, servitors brought him the mail, bank staff came with various queries and, when they saw that K. was busy, stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to them, the deputy director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and came in frequently, took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its pages, clearly for no purpose, when the door to the ante-room opened even clients would appear from the half darkness and bow timidly to him—they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he had seen them—all this activity was circling around K. with him at its centre while he compiled the list of words he would need, then looked them up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then practised their pronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart. The good intentions he had had earlier, though, seemed to have left him completely, it was the Italian who had caused him all this effort and sometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionary under some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation, but then he realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the Italian without saying a word, so, with in an even greater rage, he pulled the dictionary back out again.","It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K., in a foul temper at the thought of the day ahead of him, arrived early at seven o'clock in the office so that he could at least do some work before his visitor would prevent him.

"K. wurde durch ein Kreischen vom Saalende unterbrochen, er beschattete die Augen, um hinsehen zu können, denn das trübe Tageslicht machte den Dunst weißlich und blendete. Es handelte sich um die Waschfrau, die K. gleich bei ihrem Eintritt als eine wesentliche Störung erkannt hatte. Ob sie jetzt schuldig war oder nicht, konnte man nicht erkennen. K. sah nur, daß ein Mann sie in einen Winkel bei der Tür gezogen hatte und dort an sich drückte. Aber nicht sie kreischte, sondern der Mann, er hatte den Mund breit gezogen und blickte zur Decke. Ein kleiner Kreis hatte sich um beide gebildet, die Galeriebesucher in der Nähe schienen darüber begeistert, daß der Ernst, den K. in die Versammlung eingeführt hatte, auf diese Weise unterbrochen wurde. K. wollte unter dem ersten Eindruck gleich hinlaufen, auch dachte er, allen würde daran gelegen sein, dort Ordnung zu schaffen und zumindest das Paar aus dem Saal zu weisen, aber die ersten Reihen vor ihm blieben ganz fest, keiner rührte sich, und keiner ließ K. durch. Im Gegenteil, man hinderte ihn, alte Männer hielten den Arm vor, und irgendeine Hand – er hatte nicht Zeit, sich umzudrehen – – faßte ihn hinten am Kragen. K. dachte nicht eigentlich mehr an das Paar, ihm war, als werde seine Freiheit eingeschränkt, als mache man mit der Verhaftung ernst, und er sprang rücksichtslos vom Podium hinunter. Nun stand er Aug in Aug dem Gedränge gegenüber. Hatte er die Leute nicht richtig beurteilt? Hatte er seiner Rede zuviel Wirkung zugetraut? Hatte man sich verstellt, solange er gesprochen hatte, und hatte man jetzt, da er zu den Schlußfolgerungen kam, die Verstellung satt? Was für Gesichter rings um ihn! Kleine, schwarze Äuglein huschten hin und her, die Wangen hingen herab, wie bei Versoffenen, die langen Bärte waren steif und schütter, und griff man in sie, so war es, als bilde man bloß Krallen, nicht als griffe man in Bärte. Unter den Bärten aber – und das war die eigentliche Entdeckung, die K. machte – schimmerten am Rockkragen Abzeichen in verschiedener Größe und Farbe. Alle hatten diese Abzeichen, soweit man sehen konnte. Alle gehörten zueinander, die scheinbaren Parteien rechts und links, und als er sich plötzlich umdrehte, sah er die gleichen Abzeichen am Kragen des Untersuchungsrichters der, die Hände im Schoß, ruhig hinuntersah. »So«, rief K. und warf die Arme in die Höhe, die plötzliche Erkenntnis wollte Raum, »ihr seid ja alle Beamte, wie ich sehe, ihr seid ja die korrupte Bande, gegen die ich sprach, ihr habt euch hier gedrängt, als Zuhörer und Schnüffler, habt scheinbare Parteien gebildet, und eine hat applaudiert, um mich zu prüfen, ihr wolltet lernen, wie man Unschuldige verführen soll! Nun, ihr seid nicht nutzlos hier gewesen, hoffe ich, entweder habt ihr euch darüber unterhalten, daß jemand die Verteidigung der Unschuld von euch erwartet hat, oder aber – laß mich oder ich schlage«, rief K. einem zitternden Greis zu, der sich besonders nahe an ihn geschoben hatte – »oder aber ihr habt wirklich etwas gelernt. Und damit wünsche ich euch Glück zu euerem Gewerbe.« Er nahm schnell seinen Hut, der am Rande des Tisches lag, und drängte sich unter allgemeiner Stille, jedenfalls der Stille vollkommenster Überraschung, zum Ausgang. Der Untersuchungsrichter schien aber noch schneller als K. gewesen zu sein, denn er erwartete ihn bei der Tür. »Einen Augenblick«, sagte er. K. blieb stehen, sah aber nicht auf den Untersuchungsrichter, sondern auf die Tür, deren Klinke er schon ergriffen hatte. »Ich wollte Sie nur darauf aufmerksam machen«, sagte der Untersuchungsrichter, »daß Sie sich heute – es dürfte Ihnen noch nicht zu Bewußtsein gekommen sein – des Vorteils beraubt haben, den ein Verhör für den Verhafteten in jedem Falle bedeutet.« K. lachte die Tür an. »Ihr Lumpen«, rief er, »ich schenke euch alle Verhöre«, öffnete die Tür und eilte die Treppe hinunter. Hinter ihm erhob sich der Lärm der wiederlebendig gewordenen Versammlung, welche die Vorfälle wahrscheinlich nach Art von Studierenden zu besprechen begann.","K. was interrupted by a screech from the end of the room, he shaded his eyes to be able to look, because the dull daylight turned the haze whitish and dazzled. It was the washerwoman, whom K. had recognized as a major disruption as soon as she entered. You couldn't tell if she was guilty or not. K. only saw that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and was hugging her there. But it wasn't she who was screaming, it was the man, he had spread his mouth wide and was looking at the ceiling. A small circle had formed around the two of them, and the nearby gallery visitors seemed delighted that the seriousness that K. had introduced into the meeting had been interrupted in this way. K. wanted to run there immediately after the first impression, he also thought that everyone would want to put things in order there and at least show the couple out of the room, but the first rows in front of him remained very firm, nobody moved and nobody let K. through. On the contrary, they stopped him, old men held out their arms, and some hand - he didn't have time to turn around - - grabbed the back of his collar. K. wasn't really thinking about the couple anymore, he felt as if his freedom were being restricted, as if the arrest were being taken seriously, and he ruthlessly jumped down from the podium. Now he was face to face with the crowd. Hadn't he judged people correctly? Had he thought his speech would have too much impact? Had one been pretending while he was talking, and now that he was coming to the conclusions, were one fed up with the pretense? What faces all around him! Small, black eyes darted to and fro, the cheeks drooped like drunkards, the long beards were stiff and sparse, and if you grabbed them it was as if you were only forming claws, not as if you were grabbing a beard. But under the beards – and that was the real discovery that K. made – badges of different sizes and colors shimmered on the coat collar. All had those badges as far as could be seen. All belonged to one another, the apparent parties to the right and left, and when he turned suddenly he saw the same insignia on the coroner's collar, who was looking down calmly, his hands in his lap. ""So,"" cried K. and threw up his arms, the sudden realization wanted space, ""you're all civil servants, as I can see, you're the corrupt gang I spoke against, you crowded around here, as listeners and snoops, formed apparent factions, and one applauded to test me, you wanted to learn how to seduce the innocent! Well, you haven't been here uselessly, I hope, either you talked about the fact that someone expected you to defend your innocence, or - leave me alone or I'll hit you,"" K. called out to a trembling old man who turned particularly close to him-""or else you really did learn something. And with that, I wish you luck in your trade.” He quickly picked up his hat that lay on the edge of the table and, amid a general silence, at least the silence of complete surprise, pushed his way to the exit. But the examining magistrate seemed to have been even quicker than K., because he was waiting for him at the door. ""One moment,"" he said. K. stopped, but didn't look at the examining magistrate, but at the door, the handle of which he had already grabbed. ""I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact,"" said the examining magistrate, ""that today - you probably haven't realized it yet - you have robbed yourself of the advantage that an interrogation always means for the arrested person."" K. laughed the door. ""You rascals,"" he cried, ""I'll give you all the interrogations for free,"" opened the door and hurried down the stairs. Behind him rose the din of the revived assembly, which was beginning to discuss the events, probably in the manner of students.","K. was interrupted by a shriek from the other end of the hall; he shaded his eyes so that he could see, for the dull daylight had turned the haze into a blinding white glare. It was the washerwoman, whom K. had sensed as a major disturbance from the moment she entered. Whether or not she was at fault now was not apparent. K. saw only that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and pressed her to himself. But she wasn’t shrieking, it was the man; he had opened his mouth wide and was staring up toward the ceiling. A small circle had gathered around the two of them, and the nearby visitors in the gallery seemed delighted that the serious mood K. had introduced into the assembly had been interrupted in this fashion. K.’s initial reaction was to run toward them, in fact he thought everyone would want to restore order and at least banish the couple from the hall, but the first rows in front of him stood fast; not a person stirred and no one let K. through. On the contrary they hindered him: old men held out their arms and someone’s hand—he didn’t have time to turn around—grabbed him by the collar from behind; K. wasn’t really thinking about the couple anymore, for now it seemed to him as if his freedom were being threatened, as if he were being arrested in earnest, and he sprang from the platform recklessly. Now he stood eye-to-eye with the crowd. Had he misjudged these people? Had he overestimated the effect of his speech? Had they been pretending all the time he was speaking, and now that he had reached his conclusions, were they fed up with pretending? The faces that surrounded him! Tiny black eyes darted about, cheeks drooped like those of drunken men, the long beards were stiff and scraggly, and when they pulled on them, it seemed as if they were merely forming claws, not pulling beards. Beneath the beards, however—and this was the true discovery K. made—badges of various sizes and colors shimmered on the collars of their jackets. They all had badges, as far as he could see. They were all one group, the apparent parties on the left and right, and as he suddenly turned, he saw the same badges on the collar of the examining magistrate, who was looking on calmly with his hands in his lap. “So!” K. cried and flung his arms in the air, this sudden insight demanding space; “I see you’re all officials, you’re the corrupt band I was speaking about; you’ve crowded in here to listen and snoop , you’ve formed apparent parties and had one side applaud to test me, you wanted to learn how to lead innocent men astray. Well I hope you haven’t come in vain; either you found it entertaining that someone thought you would defend the innocent or else—back off or I’ll hit you,” cried K. to a trembling old man who had shoved his way quite near to him “—or else you’ve actually learned something. And with that I wish you luck in your trade.” He quickly picked up his hat, which was lying at the edge of the table, and made his way through the general silence, one of total surprise at least, toward the exit. The examining magistrate, however, seemed to have been even quicker than K., for he was waiting for him at the door. “One moment,” he said. K. stopped, looking not at the examining magistrate but at the door, the handle of which he had already seized. “I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact,” said the examining magistrate, “that you have today deprived yourself—although you can’t yet have realized it—of the advantage that an interrogation offers to the arrested man in each case.” K. laughed at the door. “You scoundrels,” he cried, “you can have all your interrogations”; then he opened the door and hurried down the stairs. Behind him rose the sounds of the assembly, which had come to life again, no doubt beginning to discuss what had occurred, as students might.","Here K. was interrupted by a shriek from the end of the hail; he peered from beneath his hand to see what was happening, for the reek of the room and the dim light together made a whitish dazzle of fog. It was the washer-woman, whom K. had recognized as a potential cause of disturbance from the moment of her entrance. Whether she was at fault now or not, one could not tell. All K. could see was that a man had drawn her into a corner by the door and was clasping her in his arms. * Yet it was not she who had uttered the shriek but the man; his mouth was wide open and he was gazing up at the ceiling. A little circle had formed round them, the gallery spectators near by seemed to be delighted that the seriousness which K. had introduced into the proceedings should be dispelled in this manner. K.'s first impulse was to rush across the room, he naturally imagined that everybody would be anxious to have order restored and the offending couple at least ejected from the meeting, but the first rows of the audience remained quite impassive, no one stirred and no one would let him through. On the contrary they actually obstructed him, someone's hand -- he had no time to turn round -- seized him from behind by the collar, old men stretched out their arms to bar his way, and by this time K. was no longer thinking about the couple, it seemed to him as if his freedom were being threatened, as if he were being arrested in earnest, and he sprang recklessly down from the platform. Now he stood eye to eye with the crowd. Had he been mistaken in these people? Had he overestimated the effectiveness of his speech? Had they been disguising their real opinions while he spoke, and now that he had come to the conclusion of his speech were they weary at last of pretense? What faces these were around him! Their little black eyes darted furtively from side to side, their beards were stiff and brittle, and to take hold of them would be like clutching bunches of claws rather than beards. But under the beards -- and this was K.'s real discovery -- badges of various sizes and colors gleamed on their coatcollars. They all wore these badges, so far as he could see. They were all colleagues, these ostensible parties of the Right and the Left, and as he turned round suddenly he saw the same badges on the coat-collar of the Examining Magistrate, who was sitting quietly watching the scene with his hands on his knees. "" So !"" cried K., flinging his arms in the air, his sudden enlightenment had to break out, ""every man jack of you is an official , I see, you are yourselves the corrupt agents of whom I have been speaking, you've all come rushing here to listen and nose out what you can about me, making a pretense of party divisions, and half of you applauded merely to lead me on, you wanted some practice in fooling an innocent man. Well, much good I hope it's done you, for either you have merely gathered some amusement from the fact that I expected you to defend the innocent, or else -- keep off or I'll strike you,"" cried K. to a trembling old man who had pushed quite close to him -- "" or else you have really learned a thing or two. And I wish you joy of your trade."" He hastily seized his hat, which lay near the edge of the table, and amid universal silence, the silence of complete stupefaction, if nothing else, pushed his way to the door. But the Examining Magistrate seemed to have been still quicker than K., for he was waiting at the door. "" A moment,"" he said. K. paused but kept his eyes on the door, not on the Examining Magistrate; his hand was already on the latch. ""I merely wanted to point out,"" said the Examining Magistrate, ""that today -- you may not yet have become aware of the fact -- today you have flung away with your own hand all the advantages which an interrogation invariably confers on an accused man. "" K. laughed, still looking at the door. "" You scoundrels, I'll spare you future interrogations,"" he shouted, opened the door, and hurried down the stairs. Behind him rose the buzz of animated discussion, the audience had apparently come to life again and were analyzing the situation like expert students.","K. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall, he shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made the smoke whitish and hard to see through. It was the washerwoman whom K. had recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had entered. It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not. K. could only see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and was pressing himself against her. But it was not her who was screaming, but the man, he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling. A small circle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near him in the gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K. had introduced into the gathering had been disturbed in this way. K.'s first thought was to run over there, and he also thought that everyone would want to bring things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave the room, but the first row of people in from of him stayed were they were, no-one moved and no-one let K. through. On the contrary, they stood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from somewhere—he did not have the time to turn round—took hold of his collar. K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed to him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he jumped down from the podium. Now he stood face to face with the crowd. Had he judged the people properly? Had he put too much faith in the effect of his speech? Had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had been speaking, and now that he come to the end and to what must follow, were they tired of pretending? What faces they were, all around him! Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down like on drunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they took hold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws, not as if they were taking hold of their own beards. But underneath those beards—and this was the real discovery made by K. —there were badges of various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their coats. As far as he could see, every one of them was wearing one of these badges. All of them belonged to the same group, even though they seemed to be divided to the right and the left of him, and when he suddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of the examining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap. “So,” called out K, throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed more room, “all of you are working for this organisation, I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and liars I've just been speaking about , you've all pressed yourselves in here in order to listen in and snoop on me, you gave the impression of having formed into factions, one of you even applauded me to test me out, and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man! Well, I hope you haven't come here for nothing , I hope you've either had some fun from someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else—let go of me or I'll hit you,” shouted K. to a quivery old man who had pressed himself especially close to him—“or else that you've actually learned something. And so I wish you good luck in your trade.” He briskly took his hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and, surrounded by a silence caused perhaps by the completeness of their surprise, pushed his way to the exit. However, the examining judge seems to have moved even more quickly than K., as he was waiting for him at the doorway. “One moment,” he said. K. stood where he was, but looked at the door with his hand already on its handle rather than at the judge. “I merely wanted to draw your attention, “ said the judge, “to something you seem not yet to be aware of: today, you have robbed yourself of the advantages that a hearing of this sort always gives to someone who is under arrest .” K. laughed towards the door. “You bunch of louts,” he called, “you can keep all your hearings as a present from me,” then opened the door and hurried down the steps. Behind him, the noise of the assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began to discuss these events as if making a scientific study of them.","K. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall, he shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made the smoke whitish and hard to see through. It was the washerwoman whom K. had recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had entered. It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not. K. could only see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and was pressing himself against her. But it was not her who was screaming, but the man, he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling. A small circle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near him in the gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K. had introduced into the gathering had been disturbed in this way. K.'s first thought was to run over there, and he also thought that everyone would want to bring things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave the room, but the first row of people in front of him stayed were they were, no-one moved and no-one let K. through. On the contrary, they stood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from somewhere - he did not have the time to turn round - took hold of his collar. K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed to him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he jumped down from the podium. Now he stood face to face with the crowd. Had he judged the people properly? Had he put too much faith in the effect of his speech? Had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had been speaking, and now that he come to the end and to what must follow, were they tired of pretending? What faces they were, all around him! Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down like on drunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they took hold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws, not as if they were taking hold of their own beards. But underneath those beards - and this was the real discovery made by K. - there were badges of various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their coats. As far as he could see, every one of them was wearing one of these badges. All of them belonged to the same group, even though they seemed to be divided to the right and the left of him, and when he suddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of the examining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap. "" So,"" called out K, throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed more room, ""all of you are working for this organisation, I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and liars I've just been speaking about , you've all pressed yourselves in here in order to listen in and snoop on me, you gave the impression of having formed into factions, one of you even applauded me to test me out, and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man! Well, I hope you haven't come here for nothing , I hope you've either had some fun from someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else - let go of me or I'll hit you,"" shouted K. to a quivery old man who had pressed himself especially close to him - ""or else that you've actually learned something. And so I wish you good luck in your trade."" He briskly took his hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and, surrounded by a silence caused perhaps by the completeness of their surprise, pushed his way to the exit. However, the examining judge seems to have moved even more quickly than K., as he was waiting for him at the doorway. ""One moment,"" he said. K. stood where he was, but looked at the door with his hand already on its handle rather than at the judge. ""I merely wanted to draw your attention,"" said the judge, ""to something you seem not yet to be aware of: today, you have robbed yourself of the advantages that a hearing of this sort always gives to someone who is under arrest. "" K. laughed towards the door. ""You bunch of louts,"" he called, ""you can keep all your hearings as a present from me,"" then opened the door and hurried down the steps. Behind him, the noise of the assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began to discuss these events as if making a scientific study of them."
"Die einzige wohltätige Unterbrechung dieser Besuche war Leni, die es immer so einzurichten wußte, daß sie dem Advokaten in Anwesenheit K.s den Tee brachte. Dann stand sie hinter K., sah scheinbar zu, wie der Advokat, mit einer Art Gier tief zur Tasse hinabgebeugt, den Tee eingoß und trank, und ließ im geheimen ihre Hand von K. erfassen. Es herrschte völliges Schweigen. Der Advokat trank. K. drückte Lenis Hand, und Leni wagte es manchmal, K.s Haare sanft zu streicheln. »Du bist noch hier?« fragte der Advokat, nachdem er fertig war. »Ich wollte das Geschirr wegnehmen«, sagte Leni, es gab noch einen letzten Händedruck, der Advokat wischte sich den Mund und begann mit neuer Kraft auf K. einzureden.","The only charitable interruption of these visits was Leni, who always managed to bring the lawyer tea in K.'s presence.

"Noch war er frei. »Erlauben Sie«, sagte er und ging eilig zwischen den Wächtern durch in sein Zimmer. »Er scheint vernünftig zu sein«, hörte er hinter sich sagen. In seinem Zimmer riß er gleich die Schubladen des Schreibtischs auf, es lag dort alles in großer Ordnung, aber gerade die Legitimationspapiere, die er suchte, konnte er in der Aufregung nicht gleich finden. Schließlich fand er seine Radfahrlegitimation und wollte schon mit ihr zu den Wächtern gehen, dann aber schien ihm das Papier zu geringfügig und er suchte weiter, bis er den Geburtsschein fand. Als er wieder in das Nebenzimmer zurückkam, öffnete sich gerade die gegenüberliegende Tür und Frau Grubach wollte dort eintreten. Man sah sie nur einen Augenblick, denn kaum hatte sie K. erkannt, als sie offenbar verlegen wurde, um Verzeihung bat, verschwand und äußerst vorsichtig die Tür schloß. »Kommen Sie doch herein«, hatte K. gerade noch sagen können. Nun aber stand er mit seinen Papieren in der Mitte des Zimmers, sah noch auf die Tür hin, die sich nicht wieder öffnete, und wurde erst durch einen Anruf der Wächter aufgeschreckt, die bei dem Tischchen am offenen Fenster saßen und, wie K. jetzt erkannte, sein Frühstück verzehrten. »Warum ist sie nicht eingetreten?« fragte er. »Sie darf nicht«, sagte der große Wächter. »Sie sind doch verhaftet.« »Wie kann ich denn verhaftet sein, und gar auf diese Weise?« »Nun fangen Sie also wieder an«, sagte der Wächter und tauchte ein Butterbrot ins Honigfäßchen. »Solche Fragen beantworten wir nicht.« »Sie werden sie beantworten müssen«, sagte K. »Hier sind meine Legitimationspapiere, zeigen Sie mir jetzt die Ihrigen und vor allem den Verhaftbefehl.« »Du lieber Himmel!« sagte der Wächter. »Daß Sie sich in Ihre Lage nicht fügen können und daß Sie es darauf angelegt zu haben scheinen, uns, die wir Ihnen jetzt wahrscheinlich von allen Ihren Mitmenschen am nächsten stehen, nutzlos zu reizen!« »Es ist so, glauben Sie es doch«, sagte Franz, führte die Kaffeetasse, die er in der Hand hielt, nicht zum Mund, sondern sah K. mit einem langen, wahrscheinlich bedeutungsvollen, aber unverständlichen Blick an. K. ließ sich, ohne es zu wollen, in ein Zwiegespräch der Blicke mit Franz ein, schlug dann aber doch auf seine Papiere und sagte: »Hier sind meine Legitimationspapiere.« »Was kümmern uns denn die?« rief nun schon der große Wächter. »Sie führen sich ärger auf als ein Kind. Was wollen Sie denn? Wollen Sie Ihren großen, verfluchten Prozeß dadurch zu einem raschen Ende bringen, daß Sie mit uns, den Wächtern, über Legitimation und Verhaftbefehl diskutieren? Wir sind niedrige Angestellte, die sich in einem Legitimationspapier kaum auskennen und die mit Ihrer Sache nichts anderes zu tun haben, als daß sie zehn Stunden täglich bei Ihnen Wache halten und dafür bezahlt werden. Das ist alles, was wir sind, trotzdem aber sind wir fähig, einzusehen, daß die hohen Behörden, in deren Dienst wir stehen, ehe sie eine solche Verhaftung verfügen, sich sehr genau über die Gründe der Verhaftung und die Person des Verhafteten unterrichten. Es gibt darin keinen Irrtum. Unsere Behörde, soweit ich sie kenne, und ich kenne nur die niedrigsten Grade, sucht doch nicht etwa die Schuld in der Bevölkerung, sondern wird, wie es im Gesetz heißt, von der Schuld angezogen und muß uns Wächter ausschicken. Das ist Gesetz. Wo gäbe es da einen Irrtum?« »Dieses Gesetz kenne ich nicht«, sagte K. »Desto schlimmer für Sie«, sagte der Wächter. »Es besteht wohl auch nur in Ihren Köpfen«, sagte K., er wollte sich irgendwie in die Gedanken der Wächter einschleichen, sie zu seinen Gunsten wenden oder sich dort einbürgern. Aber der Wächter sagte nur abweisend: »Sie werden es zu fühlen bekommen.« Franz mischte sich ein und sagte: »Sieh, Willem, er gibt zu, er kenne das Gesetz nicht, und behauptet gleichzeitig, schuldlos zu sein.« »Du hast ganz recht, aber ihm kann man nichts begreiflich machen«, sagte der andere. K. antwortete nichts mehr; muß ich, dachte er, durch das Geschwätz dieser niedrigsten Organe – sie geben selbst zu, es zu sein – mich noch mehr verwirren lassen? Sie reden doch jedenfalls von Dingen, die sie gar nicht verstehen. Ihre Sicherheit ist nur durch ihre Dummheit möglich. Ein paar Worte, die ich mit einem mir ebenbürtigen Menschen sprechen werde, werden alles unvergleichlich klarer machen als die längsten Reden mit diesen. Er ging einige Male in dem freien Raum des Zimmers auf und ab, drüben sah er die alte Frau, die einen noch viel älteren Greis zum Fenster gezerrt hatte, den sie umschlungen hielt. K. mußte dieser Schaustellung ein Ende machen: »Führen Sie mich zu Ihrem Vorgesetzten«, sagte er. »Wenn er es wünscht; nicht früher«, sagte der Wächter, der Willem genannt worden war. »Und nun rate ich Ihnen«, fügte er hinzu, »in Ihr Zimmer zu gehen, sich ruhig zu verhalten und darauf zu warten, was über Sie verfügt werden wird. Wir raten Ihnen, zerstreuen Sie sich nicht durch nutzlose Gedanken, sondern sammeln Sie sich, es werden große Anforderungen an Sie gestellt werden. Sie haben uns nicht so behandelt, wie es unser Entgegenkommen verdient hätte, Sie haben vergessen, daß wir, mögen wir auch sein was immer, zumindest jetzt Ihnen gegenüber freie Männer sind, das ist kein kleines Übergewicht. Trotzdem sind wir bereit, falls Sie Geld haben, Ihnen ein kleines Frühstück aus dem Kaffeehaus drüben zu bringen.«","He was still free. ""Allow me,"" he said, hurrying through the guards to his room. ""He seems reasonable,"" he heard the voice say behind him. In his room he immediately opened the drawers of the desk, everything was in order there, but in all his excitement he couldn't find the identity papers he was looking for. Eventually he found his bicycle license and wanted to take it to the guards, but then the paper seemed too trivial and he kept looking until he found the birth certificate. When he returned to the next room, the door opposite was just opening and Frau Grubach was about to enter. You only saw her for a moment, because she had hardly recognized K. when she was obviously embarrassed, asked for forgiveness, disappeared and closed the door very carefully. ""Come in,"" K. was just able to say. But now he was standing in the middle of the room with his papers, still looking at the door, which didn't open again, and was only startled by a call from the guards, who were sitting at the little table by the open window and, like K. now realized he was eating his breakfast. ""Why didn't she come in?"" he asked. ""She mustn't,"" said the tall guard. ""You're under arrest."" ""How can I be under arrest, especially like this?"" ""Now start again,"" said the guard, dipping a sandwich into the honey jar. 'We don't answer questions like that.' 'You'll have to answer them,' said K. 'Here are my identification papers, now show me yours and, above all, the arrest warrant.' 'Good heavens!' said the guard. ""That you cannot accept your situation and that you seem intent on irritating us, who are now probably closest to you of all your fellow human beings!"" ""It is so, believe it."" , said Franz, didn't raise the coffee cup he was holding to his mouth, but gave K. a long, probably meaningful but incomprehensible look. Without wanting to, K. entered into a conversation with Franz, but then he slapped his papers anyway and said: ""Here are my identification papers."" ""What do they care?"" called the big guard . 'You're acting worse than a child. What do you want? Do you want to bring your great, damn trial to a quick end by discussing legitimation and arrest warrants with us, the guards? We are lowly employees who hardly know our way around an identification paper and who have nothing to do with your cause other than to keep watch over you ten hours a day and get paid for it. That is all we are, but we are nevertheless able to see that the high authorities in whose service we work, before they order such an arrest, inform themselves very precisely about the reasons for the arrest and the person arrested. There is no error in that. Our authorities, as far as I know them, and I only know the lowest grades, do not look to blame the population, but, as the law says, is attracted by the guilt and has to send out guards. That's law. Where could there be a mistake?' 'I don't know that law,' said K. 'That makes it worse for you,' said the guard. ""It's probably only in your heads, too,"" said K., wanting to somehow sneak into the minds of the guards, turn them in his favor or settle in there. But the guard said dismissively, ""You'll feel it."" Franz intervened and said, ""Look, Willem, he admits he doesn't know the law and at the same time claims to be innocent."" quite right, but you can't make him understand anything,' said the other. K. didn't answer any more; Must I, he thought, allow myself to be further confused by the twaddle of these lowest organs - they themselves admit that they are? In any case, they're talking about things they don't understand at all. Their safety is only possible through their stupidity. A few words that I will speak to a person of my own stature will make everything incomparably clearer than the longest speeches with them. He walked up and down a few times in the free space of the room, over there he saw the old woman who had dragged a much older man to the window, whom she was holding in her arms. K. had to put an end to this show: ""Take me to your superior,"" he said. 'If he wishes; not sooner,' said the guard, who had been named Willem. 'And now I advise you,' he added, 'to go to your room, be still and wait to see what will happen to you. We advise you, do not distract yourself with useless thoughts, but collect yourself, great demands will be placed on you. You didn't treat us as our courtesy deserved, you forgot that whatever we may be, we are at least now free men in relation to you, that's no small advantage. Nevertheless, if you have money, we are willing to bring you a small breakfast from the coffee house over there.”","He was still free. “Pardon me,” he said, and walked quickly between the guards into his room. “He seems to be reasonable,” he heard them say behind him. In his room he yanked open the drawers of his desk at once; everything lay there in perfect order, but at first, in his agitation, he couldn’t find the one thing he was looking for: his identification papers. Finally he found his bicycle license and was about to take that to the guards, but then it seemed too insignificant a document and he kept on looking until his found his birth certificate. When he returned to the adjoining room, the door opposite opened and Frau Grubach started to enter. She was only visible for a moment, for no sooner had she noticed K. than she seemed seized by embarrassment, apologized, and disappeared, closing the door carefully behind her. “Come on in,” K. barely had time to say. But now he remained standing in the middle of the room with his papers, still staring at the door, which did not reopen, until he was brought to himself by a call from the guards, who were sitting at the small table by the open window and, as K. now saw, eating his breakfast. “Why didn’t she come in?” he asked. “She’s not allowed to,” said the tall guard, “after all, you’re under arrest.” “How can I be under arrest? And in this manner?” “Now there you go again,” said the guard, dipping his buttered bread into the little honey pot. “We don’t answer such questions.” “You’re going to have to answer them,” said K. “Here are my papers, now show me yours, starting with the arrest warrant.” “Good heavens!” said the guard, “you just can’t accept your situation; you seem bent on annoying us unnecessarily, although we’re probably the human beings closest to you now.” “That’s right, you’d better believe it,” said Franz, not lifting the coffee cup in his hand to his mouth but staring at K. with a long and no doubt meaningful, but incomprehensible, look. K. allowed himself to become involved in an involuntary staring match with Franz, but at last thumped his papers and said: “Here are my identification papers.” “So what?” the taller guard cried out, “you’re behaving worse than a child. What is it you want? Do you think you can bring your whole damn trial to a quick conclusion by discussing your identity and arrest warrant with your guards? We’re lowly employees who can barely make our way through such documents, and whose only role in your affair is to stand guard over you ten hours a day and get paid for it. That’s all we are, but we’re smart enough to realize that before ordering such an arrest the higher authorities who employ us inform themselves in great detail about the person they’re arresting and the grounds for the arrest. There’s been no mistake. After all, our department, as far as I know, and I know only the lowest level, doesn’t seek out guilt among the general population, but, as the Law states, is attracted by guilt and has to send us guards out. That’s the Law. What mistake could there be?” “I don’t know that law,” said K. “All the worse for you,” said the guard. “It probably exists only in your heads,” said K.; he wanted to slip into his guards’ thoughts somehow and turn them to his own advantage or accustom himself to them. But the guard merely said dismissively: “You’ll feel it eventually.” Franz broke in and said: “You see, Willem, he admits that he doesn’t know the Law and yet he claims he’s innocent.” “You’re right there, but he can’t seem to understand anything,” said the other. K. said nothing more; why should I let the idle talk of these lowly agents—they admit themselves that’s what they are —confuse me even further? he thought. After all, they’re discussing things they don’t understand. Their confidence is based solely on ignorance. A few words spoken with someone of my own sort will make everything incomparably clearer than the longest conversations with these two. He paced back and forth a few times through the cleared space of the room; across the way he saw the old woman, who had pulled an ancient man far older than herself to the window and had her arms wrapped about him; K. had to bring this show to an end: “Take me to your supervisor,” he said. “When he wishes it; not before,” said the guard called Willem. “And now I advise you,” he added, “to go to your room, remain there quietly, and wait to find out what’s to be done with you. We advise you not to waste your time in useless thought, but to pull yourself together; great demands will be placed upon you. You haven’t treated us as we deserve, given how accommodating we’ve been; you’ve forgotten that whatever else we may be, we are at least free men with respect to you, and that’s no small advantage. Nevertheless we’re prepared, if you have any money, to bring you a small breakfast from the coffeehouse across the way.”","But he was still free. "" Allow me,"" he said, passing quickly between the warders to his room. "" He seems to have some sense,"" he heard one of them saying behind him. When he reached his room he at once pulled out the drawer of his desk. Everything lay there in perfect orders but in his agitation he could not find at first the identification papers for which he was looking. At last he found his bicycle license and was about to start off with it to the warders, but then it seemed too trivial a thing, and he searched again until he found his birth certificate. As he was re-entering the next room the opposite door opened and Frau Grubach showed herself. He saw her only for an instant, for no sooner did she recognize him than she was obviously overcome by embarrassment, apologized for intruding, vanished, and shut the door again with the utmost care. ""Come in, do,"" he would just have had time to say. But he merely stood holding his papers in the middle of the room, looking at the door, which did not open again, and was only recalled to attention by a shout from the warders, who were sitting at a table by the open window and, as he now saw, devouring his breakfast. ""Why didn't she come in?"" he asked. ""She isn't allowed to,"" said the tall warder, ""since you're under arrest."" ""But how can I be under arrest? And particularly in such a ridiculous fashion ?"" ""So now you're beginning it all over again?"" said the warder, dipping a slice of bread and butter into the honey-pot. ""We don't answer such questions."" ""You'll have to answer them,"" said K. ""Here are my papers, now show me yours, and first of all your warrant for arresting me."" ""Oh, good Lord,"" said the warder. ""If you would only realize your position, and if you wouldn't insist on uselessly annoying us two, who probably mean better by you and stand closer to you than any other people in the world."" ""That's so, you can believe that,"" said Franz, not raising to his lips the coffee-cup he held in his hand, but instead giving K. a long, apparently significant, yet incomprehensible look. Without wishing it K. found himself decoyed into an exchange of speaking looks with Franz, none the less he tapped his papers and repeated: ""Here are my identification papers."" ""What are your papers to us?"" cried the tall warder. ""You're behaving worse than a child. What are you after? Do you think you'll bring this fine case of yours to a speedier end by wrangling with us, your warders, over papers and warrants? We are humble subordinates who can scarcely find our way through a legal document and have nothing to do with your case except to stand guard over you for ten hours a day and draw our pay for it. That's all we are, but we're quite capable of grasping the fact that the high authorities we serve, before they would order such an arrest as this , must be quite well informed about the reasons for the arrest and the person of the prisoner. There can be no mistake about that. Our officials, so far as I know them, and I know only the lowest grades among them, never go hunting for crime in the populace, but, as the Law decrees, are drawn toward the guilty and must then send out us warders. That is the Law. How could there be a mistake in that?"" ""I don't know this Law,"" said K. ""All the worse for you,"" replied the warder. "" And it probably exists nowhere but in your own head,"" said K.; he wanted in some way to enter into the thoughts of the warders and twist them to his own advantage or else try to acclimatize himself to them. But the warder merely said in a discouraging voice: ""You'll come up against it yet. "" Franz interrupted: ""See, Willem, he admits that he doesn't know the Law and yet he claims he's innocent."" ""You're quite right, but you'll never make a man like that see reason,"" replied the other. K. gave no further answer; ""Must I,"" he thought, ""let myself be confused still worse by the gabble of those wretched hirelings? -- they admit themselves that's all they are. They're talking of things, in any case, which they don't understand. Plain stupidity is the only thing that can give them such assurance. A few words with a man on my own level of intelligence would make everything far clearer than hours of talk with these two."" He walked up and down a few times in the free part of the room; at the other side of the street he could still see the old woman, who had now dragged to the window an even older man, whom she was holding round the waist. K. felt he must put an end to this farce. ""Take me to your superior officer,"" he said. ""When he orders me, not before,"" retorted the warder called Willem. ""And now I advise you,"" lie went on, ""to go to your room, stay quietly there, and wait for what may be decided about you. Our advice to you is not to let yourself be distracted by vain thoughts, but to collect yourself, for great demands will be made upon you. You haven't treated us as our kind advances to you deserved, you have forgotten that we, no matter who we may be, are at least free men compared to you; that is no small advantage. All the same, we are prepared, if you have any money, to bring you a little breakfast from the coffee-house across the street.""","He still had time. “Allow me,” he said, and hurried between the two policemen through into his room. “He seems sensible enough,” he heard them say behind him. Once in his room, he quickly pulled open the drawer of his writing desk, everything in it was very tidy but in his agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was looking for straight away. He finally found his bicycle permit and was about to go back to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too petty, so he carried on searching until he found his birth certificate. Just as he got back in the adjoining room the door on the other side opened and Mrs. Grubach was about to enter. He only saw her for an instant, for as soon as she recognised K. she was clearly embarrassed, asked for forgiveness and disappeared, closing the door behind her very carefully. “Do come in,” K. could have said just then. But now he stood in the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking at the door which did not open again. He stayed like that until he was startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little table at the open window and, as K. now saw, was eating his breakfast. “Why didn't she come in?” he asked. “She's not allowed to,” said the big policeman. “You're under arrest, aren't you.” “But how can I be under arrest? And how come it's like this?” “Now you're starting again,” said the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the honeypot. “We don't answer questions like that.” “You will have to answer them,” said K. “Here are my identification papers, now show me yours and I certainly want to see the arrest warrant.” “Oh, my God!” said the policeman. “In a position like yours, and you think you can start giving orders, do you? It won't do you any good to get us on the wrong side even if you think it will —we're probably more on your side that anyone else you know!” “That's true, you know, you'd better believe it,” said Franz, holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he did not lift to his mouth but looked at K. in a way that was probably meant to be full of meaning but could not actually be understood. K. found himself, without intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but then slapped his hand down on his papers and said, “Here are my identity documents.” “And what do you want us to do about it?” replied the big policeman, loudly. “The way you're carrying on, it's worse than a child. What is it you want? Do you want to get this great, bloody trial of yours over with quickly by talking about ID and arrest warrants with us? We're just coppers, that's all we are. Junior officers like us hardly know one end of an ID card from another, all we've got to do with you is keep an eye on you for ten hours a day and get paid for it. That's all we are. Mind you, what we can do is make sure that the high officials we work for find out just what sort of person it is they're going to arrest, and why he should be arrested, before they issue the warrant. There's no mistake there. Our authorities as far as I know, and I only know the lowest grades, don't go out looking for guilt among the public; it's the guilt that draws them out, like it says in the law, and they have to send us police officers out. That's the law. Where d'you think there'd be any mistake there?” “I don't know this law,” said K. “So much the worse for you, then,” said the policeman. “It's probably exists only in your heads,” said K., he wanted, in some way, to insinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those thoughts to his benefit or to make himself at home there. But the policeman just said dismissively, “You'll find out when it affects you.” Franz joined in, and said, “Look at this, Willem, he admits he doesn't know the law and at the same time insists he's innocent.” “You're quite right, but we can't get him to understand a thing,” said the other. K. stopped talking with them; do I, he thought to himself, do I really have to carry on getting tangled up with the chattering of base functionaries like this?—and they admit themselves that they are of the lowest position. They're talking about things of which they don't have the slightest understanding, anyway. It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves. I just need few words with someone of the same social standing as myself and everything will be incomparably clearer, much clearer than a long conversation with these two can make it. He walked up and down the free space in the room a couple of times, across the street he could see the old woman who, now, had pulled an old man, much older than herself, up to the window and had her arms around him. K. had to put an end to this display, “Take me to your superior,” he said. “As soon as he wants to see you. Not before,” said the policeman, the one called Willem. “And now my advice to you,” he added, “is to go into your room, stay calm, and wait and see what's to be done with you. If you take our advice, you won't tire yourself out thinking about things to no purpose, you need to pull yourself together as there's a lot that's going to required of you. You've not behaved towards us the way we deserve after being so good to you, you forget that we, whatever we are, we're still free men and you're not, and that's quite an advantage. But in spite of all that we're still willing, if you've got the money, to go and get you some breakfast from the cafe over the road.”","He still had time. "" Allow me,"" he said, and hurried between the two policemen through into his room. "" He seems sensible enough,"" he heard them say behind him. Once in his room, he quickly pulled open the drawer of his writing desk, everything in it was very tidy but in his agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was looking for straight away. He finally found his bicycle permit and was about to go back to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too petty, so he carried on searching until he found his birth certificate. Just as he got back in the adjoining room the door on the other side opened and Mrs. Grubach was about to enter. He only saw her for an instant, for as soon as she recognised K. she was clearly embarrassed, asked for forgiveness and disappeared, closing the door behind her very carefully. ""Do come in,"" K. could have said just then. But now he stood in the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking at the door which did not open again. He stayed like that until he was startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little table at the open window and, as K. now saw, was eating his breakfast. ""Why didn't she come in?"" he asked. ""She's not allowed to,"" said the big policeman. ""You're under arrest, aren't you."" ""But how can I be under arrest? And how come it's like this?"" ""Now you're starting again,"" said the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the honeypot. ""We don't answer questions like that."" ""You will have to answer them,"" said K. ""Here are my identification papers, now show me yours and I certainly want to see the arrest warrant."" ""Oh, my God!"" said the policeman. ""In a position like yours, and you think you can start giving orders, do you? It won't do you any good to get us on the wrong side, even if you think it will - we're probably more on your side that anyone else you know!"" ""That's true, you know, you'd better believe it,"" said Franz, holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he did not lift to his mouth but looked at K. in a way that was probably meant to be full of meaning but could not actually be understood. K. found himself, without intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but then slapped his hand down on his papers and said, ""Here are my identity documents."" ""And what do you want us to do about it?"" replied the big policeman, loudly. ""The way you're carrying on, it's worse than a child. What is it you want? Do you want to get this great, bloody trial of yours over with quickly by talking about ID and arrest warrants with us? We're just coppers, that's all we are. Junior officers like us hardly know one end of an ID card from another, all we've got to do with you is keep an eye on you for ten hours a day and get paid for it. That's all we are. Mind you, what we can do is make sure that the high officials we work for find out just what sort of person it is they're going to arrest, and why he should be arrested, before they issue the warrant. There's no mistake there. Our authorities as far as I know, and I only know the lowest grades, don't go out looking for guilt among the public; it's the guilt that draws them out, like it says in the law, and they have to send us police officers out. That's the law. Where d'you think there'd be any mistake there?"" ""I don't know this law,"" said K. ""So much the worse for you, then,"" said the policeman. ""It's probably exists only in your heads,"" said K., he wanted, in some way, to insinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those thoughts to his benefit or to make himself at home there. But the policeman just said dismissively, ""You'll find out when it affects you. "" Franz joined in, and said, ""Look at this, Willem, he admits he doesn't know the law and at the same time insists he's innocent."" ""You're quite right, but we can't get him to understand a thing,"" said the other.

"Als er um halb zehn Uhr abends vor dem Hause, in dem er wohnte, ankam, traf er im Haustor einen jungen Burschen, der dort breitbeinig stand und eine Pfeife rauchte. »Wer sind Sie?« fragte K. sofort und brachte sein Gesicht nahe an den Burschen, man sah nicht viel im Halbdunkel des Flurs. »Ich bin der Sohn des Hausmeisters, gnädiger Herr«, antwortete der Bursche, nahm die Pfeife aus dem Mund und trat zur Seite. »Der Sohn des Hausmeisters?« fragte K. und klopfte mit seinem Stock ungeduldig den Boden. »Wünscht der gnädige Herr etwas? Soll ich den Vater holen?« »Nein, nein«, sagte K., in seiner Stimme lag etwas Verzeihendes, als habe der Bursche etwas Böses ausgeführt, er aber verzeihe ihm. »Es ist gut«, sagte er dann und ging weiter, aber ehe er die Treppe hinaufstieg, drehte er sich noch einmal um.","When he arrived at the house where he lived at nine-thirty in the evening, he met a young fellow standing there with his legs apart and smoking a pipe. ""Who are you?"" K. asked immediately and put his face close to the boys, you couldn't see much in the semidarkness of the hallway. ""I'm the caretaker's son, sir,"" the boy answered, taking his pipe out of his mouth and stepping aside. ""The caretaker's son?"" asked K., tapping the floor impatiently with his stick. 'Does the gracious gentleman want anything? Shall I fetch Father?' 'No, no,' said K., there was something forgiving in his voice, as if the boy had done something bad, but he would forgive him. ""It's fine,"" he said, and walked on, but before he went up the stairs he turned around again.","When, at nine-thirty that evening, he arrived at the building where he lived, he met a young fellow standing spread-legged at the entrance, smoking a pipe. “Who are you,” K. asked straightaway and brought his face close to that of the fellow; the semidarkness of the entranceway made it hard to see. “I’m the caretaker’s son, sir,” the fellow answered, removing the pipe from his mouth and stepping aside. “The caretaker’s son?” K. asked, tapping the floor impatiently with his cane. “Is there anything I can do for you, sir? Shall I get my father?” “No, no,” said K. with a note of forgiveness, as if the fellow had done something truly wrong, but he was willing to forgive him. “That’s all right,” he said, and passed on; but before he went up the stairs, he turned around once more.","When at half past nine he arrived at the house where he lived he found a young lad in the street doorway, standing with his legs wide apart and smoking a pipe. ""Who are you?"" K. asked at once, bringing his face close to the lad's -- one could not see very well in the darkness of the entrance. ""I'm the house-porter's son, sir,"" said the lad, taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping aside. "" The house-porter's son ?"" asked K., tapping his stick impatiently on the ground. "" Do you want anything, sir? Shall I fetch my father?"" ""No, no,"" said K., and his voice had a reassuring note, as if the lad had done something wrong but was to be forgiven. ""It's all right,"" he said and went on, yet before he climbed the stair he turned round for another look.","At half past nine that evening, when he arrived back in front of the building where he lived, he met a young lad in the doorway who was standing there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe. “Who are you?” immediately asked K., bringing his face close to the lad's, as it was hard to see in the half light of the landing. “I'm the landlord's son, sir,” answered the lad, taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping to one side. “The landlord's son?” asked K., and impatiently knocked on the ground with his stick. “Did you want anything, sir? Would you like me to fetch my father?” “No, no,” said K., there was something forgiving in his voice, as if the boy had harmed him in some way and he was excusing him. “It's alright,” he said then, and went on, but before going up the stairs he turned round once more.","At half past nine that evening, when he arrived back in front of the building where he lived, he met a young lad in the doorway who was standing there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe.

"Lange saß er so, ohne zu wissen, was ihm eigentlich Sorgen machte, nur von Zeit zu Zeit blickte er ein wenig erschreckt über die Schulter hinweg zur Vorzimmertür, wo er irrtümlicherweise ein Geräusch zu hören geglaubt hatte. Da aber niemand kam, wurde er ruhiger, ging zum Waschtisch, wusch sich mit kaltem Wasser und kehrte mit freierem Kopf zu seinem Fensterplatz zurück. Der Entschluß, seine Verteidigung selbst in die Hand zu nehmen, stellte sich ihm schwerwiegender dar, als er ursprünglich angenommen hatte. Solange er die Verteidigung auf den Advokaten überwälzt hatte, war er doch noch vom Prozeß im Grunde wenig betroffen gewesen, er hatte ihn von der Ferne beobachtet und hatte unmittelbar von ihm kaum erreicht werden können, er hatte nachsehen können, wann er wollte, wie seine Sache stand, aber er hatte auch den Kopf wieder zurückziehen können, wann er wollte. Jetzt hingegen, wenn er seine Verteidigung selbst führen würde, mußte er sich – wenigstens für den Augenblick – ganz und gar dem Gericht aussetzen, der Erfolg dessen sollte ja für später seine vollständige und endgültige Befreiung sein, aber um diese zu erreichen, mußte er sich vorläufig jedenfalls in viel größere Gefahr begeben als bisher. Hätte er daran zweifeln wollen, so hätte ihn das heutige Beisammensein mit dem Direktor-Stellvertreter und dem Fabrikanten hinreichend vom Gegenteil überzeugen können. Wie war er doch dagesessen, schon vom bloßen Entschluß, sich selbst zu verteidigen, gänzlich benommen? Wie sollte es aber später werden? Was für Tage standen ihm bevor! Würde er den Weg finden, der durch alles hindurch zum guten Ende führte? Bedeutete nicht eine sorgfältige Verteidigung – und alles andere war sinnlos –, bedeutete nicht eine sorgfältige Verteidigung gleichzeitig die Notwendigkeit, sich von allem anderen möglichst anzuschließen? Würde er das glücklich überstehen? Und wie sollte ihm die Durchführung dessen in der Bank gelingen? Es handelte sich ja nicht nur um die Eingabe, für die ein Urlaub vielleicht genügt hätte, obwohl die Bitte um einen Urlaub gerade jetzt ein großes Wagnis gewesen wäre, es handelte sich doch um einen ganzen Prozeß, dessen Dauer unabsehbar war. Was für ein Hindernis war plötzlich in K.s Laufbahn geworfen worden!","He sat like that for a long time without knowing what was really worrying him, only from time to time he looked a little startled over his shoulder at the antechamber door, where he had mistakenly thought he heard a noise. But since nobody came, he calmed down, went to the washbasin, washed himself with cold water and returned to his window seat with a clearer head. The decision to take his defense into his own hands proved more serious than he had originally thought. As long as he had left the defense to the lawyer, he had basically been little affected by the trial, he had observed it from afar and could hardly be reached by him directly, he could look up whenever he wanted, like his The matter stood, but he could pull his head back whenever he wanted. Now, on the other hand, if he were to conduct his own defense, he must - at least for the moment - expose himself entirely to the court, the success of which was to be his complete and final liberation later on, but in order to achieve this he had to surrender himself for the time being, at any rate, in much greater danger than before. If he had doubted that, today's meeting with the deputy director and the manufacturer would have sufficiently convinced him otherwise. How had he sat there, stunned by the mere decision to defend himself? But how should it be later? What days awaited him! Would he find the path that led through everything to a happy ending? Didn't a careful defense mean—and all else was pointless—didn't a careful defense mean at the same time the need to be as close as possible to everything else? Would he be happy? And how should he manage to carry this out in the bank? It wasn't just a question of a petition, for which a vacation might have sufficed, although asking for a vacation at this point would have been a big risk, it was a whole process, the duration of which was incalculable. What an obstacle had suddenly been thrown in K.'s career!","He sat like that for a long time, without knowing what was actually troubling him, just glancing over his shoulder with a start from time to time at the door to the waiting room, where he mistakenly thought he heard a noise. But when no one arrived, he relaxed, went to the washbasin, washed his face with cold water, and returned to his place at the window with a clearer head. The decision to take charge of his own defense appeared more momentous now than he had originally assumed. So long as he had shifted the burden of his defense to his lawyer the trial had not affected him all that much; he had observed it from afar and could scarcely be touched by it directly; he could check up on his case whenever he wished, but he could also pull his head back whenever he wanted to. Now, on the other hand, if he intended to undertake his own defense, he would have to expose himself fully to the court for the moment; the result would eventually be his full and definitive release, but in order to achieve this, he must temporarily place himself in far greater danger than before. If he had any doubts on that score, today’s meeting with the vice president and the manufacturer offered ample proof. How could he have just sat there, totally paralyzed by the mere decision to defend himself? What would things be like later? The days that lay ahead! Would he find the path that led through it all to a favorable end? Didn’t a painstaking defense—and any other kind would be senseless—didn’t a painstaking defense simultaneously imply the necessity of cutting himself off as far as possible from everything else? Would he successfully survive that? And how was he supposed to do that here at the bank? It wasn’t just a matter of the petition, for which a leave might perhaps suffice, although requesting one just now would be taking a great chance; it was a matter of an entire trial, the length of which was unforeseeable. What an obstacle had suddenly been thrown in the path of K.’s career!","For a long time he sat like this, without knowing what really troubled him, only turning his head from time to time with an alarmed glance toward the anteroom, where he fancied, mistakenly, that he heard a noise. But as no one came in he recovered his composure, went over to the washbasin, washed his face in cold water, and returned to his place at the window with a clearer mind. The decision to take his defense into his own hands seemed now more grave to him than he had originally fancied. So long as the lawyer was responsible for the case it had not come really home to him, he had viewed it with a certain detachment and kept beyond reach of immediate contact with it, he had been able to supervise it whenever he liked, but could also withdraw whenever he liked. Now, on the other hand, if he were to conduct his own defense he would be putting himself completely in the power of the Court, at least for the time being, a policy which would eventually bring about his absolute and definite acquittal, but would meanwhile, provisionally at least, involve him in far greater dangers than before. If he had ever doubted that, his state of mind today in his encounter with the Assistant Manager and the manufacturer would have been more than enough to convince him. What a stupor had overcome him, merely because he had decided to conduct his own defense! And what would develop later on? What days were lying in wait for him? Would he ever find the right path through all these difficulties? To put up a thoroughgoing defense -- and any other kind would be a waste of time -- to put up a thoroughgoing defense, did that not involve cutting himself off from every other activity? Would he be able to carry that through? And how was he to conduct his case from a Bank office? It was not merely the drawing up of a plea; that might be managed on a few weeks' furlough, though to ask for leave of absence just now would be decidedly risky; but a whole trial was involved, whose duration it was impossible to foresee. What an obstacle had suddenly arisen to block K.'s career!","He remained a long time sitting in this way, not knowing what it actually was that made him so anxious, only occasionally did he glance, slightly startled, over his shoulder at the door to the outer room where, mistakenly, he thought he'd heard some noise. No-one came, and that made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed his face with cold water and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to his place by the window. The decision to take his defence into his own hands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed. All the while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had little basic affect on him, he had observed it from afar as something that was scarcely able to reach him directly, when it suited him he looked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his head back again whenever he wanted. Now, in contrast, if he was to conduct his defence himself, he would have to devote himself entirely to the court—for the time being, at least—success would mean, later on, his complete and conclusive liberation, but if he was to achieve this he would have to place himself, to start with, in far greater danger than he had been in so far. If he ever felt tempted to doubt this, then his experience with the deputy director and the manufacturer that day would be quite enough to convince him of it. How could he have sat there totally convinced of the need to do his own defence? How would it be later? What would his life be like in the days ahead? Would he find the way through it all to a happy conclusion? Did a carefully worked out defence—and any other sort would have made no sense—did a carefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himself off from everything else as much as he could? Would he survive that? And how was he to succeed in conducting all this at the bank? It involved much more than just submitting some documents that he could probably prepare in a few days' leave, although it would have been great temerity to ask for time off from the bank just at that time, it was a whole trial and there was no way of seeing how long it might last.

"Zwischen zwei Männern hindurch, die sich unmittelbar bei der Tür unterhielten – der eine machte mit beiden, weit vorgestreckten Händen die Bewegung des Geldaufzählens, der andere sah ihm scharf in die Augen –, faßte eine Hand nach K. Es war ein kleiner, rotbäckiger Junge. »Kommen Sie, kommen Sie«, sagte er. K. ließ sich von ihm führen, es zeigte sich, daß in dem durcheinanderwimmelnden Gedränge doch ein schmaler Weg frei war, der möglicherweise zwei Parteien schied; dafür sprach auch, daß K. in den ersten Reihen rechts und links kaum ein ihm zugewendetes Gesicht sah, sondern nur die Rücken von Leuten, welche ihre Reden und Bewegungen nur an Leute ihrer Partei richteten. Die meisten waren schwarz angezogen, in alten, lang und lose hinunterhängenden Feiertagsröcken. Nur diese Kleidung beirrte K., sonst hätte er das Ganze für eine politische Bezirksversammlung angesehen.","Between two men who were talking right by the door - one made the motion of counting the money with both hands stretched out wide, the other looked him straight in the eye - a hand reached for K. It was a small, red-cheeked boy . ""Come on, come on,"" he said. K. let him lead him, it turned out that in the swarming crowd there was a narrow path that might have separated two parties; This was also supported by the fact that in the first rows to the left and right, K. hardly saw a face turned towards him, only the backs of people who were only addressing their speeches and movements to people from their party. Most were dressed in black, in old holiday skirts that hung long and loose. K. was only confused by this clothing, otherwise he would have taken the whole thing for a political district meeting.","Between two men who were conversing near the door—one of them was going through the motions of counting out money with outstretched hands, the other was looking him sharply in the eye—a hand reached out for K. It was a little red-cheeked boy. “Come on, come on,” he said. K. let him lead the way; it turned out that there was indeed a narrow path free through the swirling crowd, one that possibly divided two parties; this possibility was further supported by the fact that K. saw scarcely a face turned toward him in the closest rows on his left and right, but merely the backs of people addressing their words and gestures solely to those in their own party. Most were dressed in black, in old, long, loosely hanging formal coats. This was the only thing K. found confusing; otherwise he would have taken it all for a local precinct meeting.","Between two men who were talking together just inside the door -- the one was making with both outstretched hands a gesture as if paying out money while the other was looking him sharply in the eye -- a hand reached out and seized K. It belonged to a little red-cheeked lad. ""Come along, come along,"" he said. K. let himself be led off, it seemed that in the confused, swarming crowd a slender path was kept free after all, possibly separating two different factions; in favor of this supposition was the fact that immediately to right and left of him K. saw scarcely one face looking his way, but only the backs of people who were addressing their words and gestures to the members of their own party.

K. let himself be led by him, and it turned out that there was—surprisingly in a densely packed crowd of people moving to and fro—a narrow passage which may have been the division between two factions; this idea was reinforced by the fact that in the first few rows to the left and the right of him there was hardly any face looking in his direction, he saw nothing but the backs of people directing their speech and their movements only towards members of their own side.

"Als er in das Hauptschiff trat, um seinen Platz zu suchen, auf dem er das Album liegengelassen hatte, bemerkte er an einer Säule, fast angrenzend an die Bänke des Altarchors, eine kleine Nebenkanzel, ganz einfach, aus kahlem, bleichem Stein. Sie war so klein, daß sie aus der Ferne wie eine noch leere Nische erschien, die für die Aufnahme einer Heiligenstatue bestimmt war. Der Prediger konnte gewiß keinen vollen Schritt von der Brüstung zurücktreten. Außerdem begann die steinerne Einwölbung der Kanzel ungewöhnlich tief und stieg, zwar ohne jeden Schmuck, aber derartig geschweift in die Höhe, daß ein mittelgroßer Mann dort nicht aufrecht stehen konnte, sondern sich dauernd über die Brüstung vorbeugen mußte. Das Ganze war wie zur Qual des Predigers bestimmt, es war unverständlich, wozu man diese Kanzel benötigte, da man doch die andere, große und so kunstvoll geschmückte zur Verfügung hatte.","Stepping into the nave to find his place where he had left the album, he noticed on a pillar, almost adjacent to the altar choir pews, a small ancillary pulpit, quite plain, of bare, pale stone. It was so small that from a distance it looked like an empty niche intended for a statue of a saint. Certainly the preacher could not take a full step back from the parapet. In addition, the stone vaulting of the pulpit began unusually deep and rose, admittedly without any decoration, but so curved upwards that a man of medium height could not stand upright there, but had to keep leaning over the parapet. The whole thing was destined to be the preacher's torment, it was incomprehensible why one needed this pulpit, since one had the other, large and artistically decorated one at one's disposal.","As he stepped into the nave to find the place where he’d left the album, he noticed, almost immediately adjoining the benches for the choir, a column with a small auxiliary pulpit of pale bare stone. It was so small that from the distance it appeared to be an empty niche intended for a statue. The preacher would not have room to step even one full pace back from the balustrade. Moreover the stone vaulting of the pulpit began at an unusually low point and rose, bare of any decoration it’s true, but curved inward so sharply that a man of average height could not stand upright there, but instead would have to bend forward over the balustrade the entire time. The whole arrangement seemed designed to torture the preacher; there was no conceivable reason why this pulpit was needed at all, since the other large and finely decorated one was available.","As he returned to the nave to find the seat on which he had left the album, K. caught sight of a small side pulpit attached to a pillar almost immediately adjoining the choir, a simple pulpit of plain, pale stone. It was so small that from a distance it looked like an empty niche intended for a statue. There was certainly no room for the preacher to take a full step backward from the balustrade. The vaulting of the stone canopy, too, began very low down and curved forward and upward, although without ornamentation, in such a way that a medium-sized man could not stand upright beneath it, but would have to keep leaning over the balustrade. The whole structure was designed as if to torture the preacher; there seemed no comprehensible reason why it should be there at all while the other pulpit, so large and finely decorated, was available.","When he entered the central nave to go back to where he had left the album, he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next to the stalls by the altar where the choir sat. It was very simple, made of plain white stone, and so small that from a distance it looked like an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been. It certainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full step back from the balustrade, and, although there was no decoration on it, the top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man of average height would not be able stand upright and would have to remain bent forward over the balustrade. In all, it looked as if it had been intended to make the priest suffer, it was impossible to understand why this pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available which were large and so artistically decorated.","When he entered the central nave to go back to where he had left the album, he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next to the stalls by the altar where the choir sat.

"Endlich war K. allein. Er dachte gar nicht daran, irgendeine andere Partei vorzulassen, und nur undeutlich kam ihm zu Bewußtsein, wie angenehm es sei, daß die Leute draußen in dem Glauben waren, er verhandle noch mit dem Fabrikanten und es könne aus diesem Grunde niemand, nicht einmal der Diener, bei ihm eintreten. Er ging zum Fenster, setzte sich auf die Brüstung, hielt sich mit einer Hand an der Klinke fest und sah auf den Platz hinaus. Der Schnee fiel noch immer, es hatte sich noch gar nicht aufgehellt.","Finally K. was alone. He had no thought of letting any other party in front of him, and he only vaguely realized how pleasant it was that the people outside believed that he was still negotiating with the manufacturer and that for this reason nobody could, not even him Servant, come in to him. He went to the window, sat on the parapet, held the handle with one hand, and looked out over the square. The snow was still falling, it hadn't even cleared yet.","At last K. was alone. He had no intention of admitting any other clients, and he was only vaguely conscious of how pleasant it was that the people outside believed he was still dealing with the manufacturer, so that no one, not even his assistant, could enter. He went to the window, sat down on the broad sill, held on tightly to the handle with one hand, and looked out onto the square. The snow was still falling; the day had not yet brightened.","At last K. was alone. He had not the slightest intention of interviewing any more clients and vaguely realized how pleasant it was that the people waiting outside believed him to be still occupied with the manufacturer, so that nobody, not even the attendant, could disturb him. He went over to the window, perched on the sill, holding on to the latch with one hand, and looked down on the square below. The snow was still falling, the sky had not yet cleared.","At last, K. was by himself. It did not enter his head to show anyone else into his office and only became vaguely aware of how nice it was that the people outside thought he was still negotiating with the manufacturer and, for this reason, he could not let anyone in to see him, not even the servitor. He went over to the window, sat down on the ledge beside it, held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto the square outside. The snow was still falling, the weather still had not brightened up at all.","At last, K. was by himself.
