Mit tiefer Freude, mit tiefem Ernst blickte er ihm nach, sah seine Schritte voll Frieden, sah sein Haupt voll Glanz, sah seine Gestalt voll Licht.","Beaming he went away; Siddhartha looked after him.

"Neben ihm lebte Govinda, sein Schatten, ging dieselben Wege, unterzog sich denselben Bemühungen. Selten sprachen sie anderes miteinander, als der Dienst und die Übungen erforderten. Zuweilen gingen sie zu zweien durch die Dörfer, um Nahrung für sich und ihre Lehrer zu betteln.","Beside him lived Govinda, his shadow, walked the same paths, underwent the same endeavours. They seldom spoke to each other other than what the service and the exercises required. Sometimes they went in pairs through the villages to beg food for themselves and their teachers.","Next to him lived Govinda, his shadow, following the same paths, undergoing the same efforts.

"Lange saß er und blickte auf ihr entschlafnes Gesicht. Lange betrachtete er ihren Mund, ihren alten, müden Mund mit den schmal gewordenen Lippen, und erinnerte sich, dass er einst, im Frühling seiner Jahre, diesen Mund einer frisch aufgebrochenen Feige verglichen hatte. Lange saß er, las in dem bleichen Gesicht, in den müden Falten, füllte sich mit dem Anblick, sah sein eigenes Gesicht ebenso liegen, ebenso weiß, ebenso erloschen, und sah zugleich sein Gesicht und das ihre jung, mit den roten Lippen, mit dem brennenden Auge, und das Gefühl der Gegenwart und Gleichzeitigkeit durchdrang ihn völlig, das Gefühl der Ewigkeit. Tief empfand er, tiefer als jemals, in dieser Stunde die Unzerstörbarkeit jedes Lebens, die Ewigkeit jedes Augenblicks.","He sat for a long time and looked at her sleepy face. He looked at her mouth for a long time, her old, tired mouth with the thin lips, and remembered that once, in the spring of his years, he had compared this mouth to a freshly broken fig.

In that hour, more deeply than ever, he felt the indestructibility of every life, the eternity of every moment.","He sat and sat, gazing at her lifeless face. He gazed and gazed at her lips, her old, tired, pinched lips, and he remembered that once, in the springtime of his life, he had likened those lips to a freshly broken fig.

In this hour he felt deeply, more deeply than ever, the indestructibility of every life, the eternity of every instant.","For a long time he sat there, gazing at her face in its repose.

"Ihre Augen wurden irr und fielen zu. Der Knabe weinte, Siddhartha nahm ihn auf seine Knie, ließ ihn weinen, streichelte sein Haar, und beim Anblick des Kindergesichtes fiel ein brahmanisches Gebet ihm ein, das er einst gelernt hatte, als er selbst ein kleiner Knabe war. Langsam, mit singender Stimme, begann er es zu sprechen, aus der Vergangenheit und Kindheit her kamen ihm die Worte geflossen. Und unter seinem Singsang wurde der Knabe ruhig, schluchzte noch hin und wieder auf und schlief ein. Siddhartha legte ihn auf Vasudevas Lager. Vasudeva stand am Herd und kochte Reis. Siddhartha warf ihm einen Blick zu, den er lächelnd erwiderte.","Her eyes went wild and fell shut. The boy cried, Siddhartha took him on his knees, let him cry, stroked his hair, and looking at the child's face he remembered a Brahmanic prayer that he had learned when he was a little boy himself.

And to the sound of his singing, the boy grew calm, sobbed now and then, and fell asleep. Siddhartha laid him on Vasudeva's bed. Vasudeva stood at the stove and cooked rice. Siddhartha gave him a look, which he returned with a smile.","Her eyes grew confused and they closed. The boy wept. Siddhartha took him on his lap, let him weep, caressed his hair, and as he looked at the boy’s face, he thought of a Brahmin prayer he had once learned when he himself had been a little boy. Slowly, in a singsong voice, he began to recite it: from his past and his childhood the words came flowing to him. And under his singsong, the boy grew calm, sobbed a little now and then, and fell asleep. Siddhartha put him on Vasudeva’s pallet. Vasudeva stood at the hearth, cooking rice. Siddhartha glanced at him, and Vasudeva smiled back.","She glanced about wildly, then her eyes fell shut. The boy began to cry.

"Siddhartha schonte ihn und ließ ihn gewähren, er ehrte seine Trauer. Siddhartha verstand, dass sein Sohn ihn nicht kenne, dass er ihn nicht lieben könne wie einen Vater. Langsam sah und verstand er auch, dass der Elfjährige ein verwöhnter Knabe war, ein Mutterkind, und in Gewohnheiten des Reichtums aufgewachsen, gewohnt an feinere Speisen, an ein weiches Bett, gewohnt, Dienern zu befehlen. Siddhartha verstand, dass der Trauernde und Verwöhnte nicht plötzlich und gutwillig in der Fremde und Armut sich zufrieden geben könne. Er zwang ihn nicht, er tat manche Arbeit für ihn, suchte stets den besten Bissen für ihn aus. Langsam hoffte er ihn zu gewinnen, durch freundliche Geduld.","Siddhartha spared him and let him do what he wanted, he honored his grief. Siddhartha understood that his son didn't know him, that he couldn't love him like a father. Slowly he also saw and understood that the eleven-year-old was a spoiled boy, a mother's child, and raised in habits of wealth, accustomed to finer food, a soft bed, accustomed to commanding servants.

"Mit halbem Lächeln, mit einer unerschütterten Helle und Freundlichkeit sah Gotama dem Fremdling ins Auge und verabschiedete ihn mit einer kaum sichtbaren Gebärde.","With a half smile, with an unwavering brightness and friendliness, Gotama looked the stranger in the eye and with a barely visible gesture bid him farewell.","With a half smile, with an unperturbable brightness and friendliness, Gautama gazed into the stranger’s eyes and bade him good-bye with a barely visible gesture.","With a half smile, with imperturbable brightness and amicability, Gautama looked directly into the face of the stranger and bade him farewell with a scarcely visible gesture."
"Sprach Govinda: »So sagst du, o Freund, und weißt doch, dass Siddhartha kein Ochsentreiber ist und ein Samana kein Trunkenbold. Wohl findet der Trinker Betäubung, wohl findet er kurze Flucht und Rast, aber er kehrt zurück aus dem Wahn und, findet alles beim alten, ist nicht weiser geworden, hat nicht Erkenntnis gesammelt, – ist nicht um Stufen höher gestiegen.«","Said Govinda: »So you say, o friend, and yet you know that Siddhartha is not an ox driver and a Samana is not a drunkard.

He has not grown wiser, has not gathered wisdom, has not ascended to a higher rung.”"
"Mit anderen Mönchen weilte Govinda einst während einer Rastzeit in dem Lusthain, welchen die Kurtisane Kamala den Jüngern des Gotama geschenkt hatte. Er hörte von einem alten Fährmanne sprechen, welcher eine Tagereise entfernt vom Flusse wohne, und der von vielen für einen Weisen gehalten werde. Als Govinda des Weges weiterzog, wählte er den Weg zur Fähre, begierig diesen Fährmann zu sehen. Denn ob er wohl sein Leben lang nach der Regel gelebt hatte, auch von den jüngeren Mönchen seines Alters und seiner Bescheidenheit wegen mit Ehrfurcht angesehen wurde, war doch in seinem Herzen die Unruhe und das Suchen nicht erloschen.","Govinda was once resting with other monks in the pleasure grove which the courtesan Kamala had given to the disciples of Gotama. He heard of an old ferryman, who lived a day's journey from the river, and who was thought by many to be a wise man.

"Er kam zum Flüsse, er bat den Alten um Überfahrt, und da sie drüben aus dem Boot stiegen, sagte er zum Alten: »Viel Gutes erweisest du uns Mönchen und Pilgern, viele von uns hast du schon übergesetzt. Bist nicht auch du, Fährmann, ein Sucher nach dem rechten Pfade?«","He came to the river, he asked the old man for a crossing, and as they got out of the boat over there, he said to the old man: ""You are doing us monks and pilgrims many good things, you have already crossed many of us.

"»Du siehst in mein Herz,« sprach Siddhartha traurig. »Oft habe ich daran gedacht. Aber sieh, wie soll ich ihn, der ohnehin kein sanftes Herz hat, in diese Welt geben? Wird er nicht üppig werden, wird er nicht sich an Lust und Macht verlieren, wird er nicht alle Irrtümer seines Vaters wiederholen, wird er nicht vielleicht ganz und gar in Sansara verloren gehen?«","""You look into my heart,"" said Siddhartha sadly.

"Einst, als des Knaben Gesicht ihn sehr an Kamala erinnerte, musste Siddhartha plötzlich eines Wortes gedenken, das Kamala vor Zeiten, in den Tagen der Jugend, einmal zu ihm gesagt hatte. »Du kannst nicht lieben,« hatte sie ihm gesagt, und er hatte ihr Recht gegeben und hatte sich mit einem Stern, die Kindermenschen aber mit fallendem Laub verglichen, und dennoch hatte er in jenem Wort auch einen Vorwurf gespürt. In der Tat hatte er niemals sich an einen anderen Menschen ganz verlieren und hingeben können, sich selbst vergessen, Torheiten der Liebe eines anderen wegen begehen; nie hatte er das gekonnt, und dies war, wie ihm damals schien, der große Unterschied gewesen, der ihn von den Kindermenschen trennte. Nun aber, seit sein Sohn da war, nun war auch er, Siddhartha, vollends ein Kindermensch geworden, eines Menschen wegen leidend, einen Menschen liebend, an eine Liebe verloren, einer Liebe wegen ein Tor geworden. Nun fühlte auch er, spät, einmal im Leben diese stärkste und seltsamste Leidenschaft, litt an ihr, litt kläglich, und war doch beseligt, war doch um etwas erneuert, um etwas reicher.","Once, when the boy's face reminded him very much of Kamala, Siddhartha suddenly had to think of a word that Kamala had said to him a long time ago, in the days of his youth. ""You cannot love,"" she had said to him, and he had agreed with her and had compared himself to a star, but children to falling leaves, and yet he had sensed a reproach in that word. In fact, he had never been able to lose and give himself completely to another person, forget himself, commit follies for the love of another; he had never been able to do that, and that, it seemed to him at the time, was the big difference that separated him from the childish people. But now, since his son was there, now he too, Siddhartha, had completely become a childish human being, suffering because of someone, loving someone, lost to a love, become a fool because of a love. Now he too, late in life, felt this strongest and strangest passion, suffered from it, suffered miserably, and yet was blissful, was somewhat renewed, somewhat richer.","Once, when the boy’s face reminded him very much of Kamala, Siddhartha recalled something she had said to him long ago, in the days of youth. “You cannot love,” she had said to him, and he had agreed with her, and had likened himself to a star and the child people to falling leaves, and yet he had sensed a rebuke in her words. Indeed, he had never been able to lose himself completely in anyone else, give himself completely to another person, forget himself, commit follies of love for someone else. He had never been able to do these things, and this had struck him as the great gap between him and the child people. But now that his son was here, now he, Siddhartha, too, had become a child person, suffering for someone else, loving someone else, lost in a love, a fool for love. Now he too, at this late time, felt this strongest and strangest passion, suffered from it, suffered woefully, and yet he was blissful, was somewhat renewed, was somewhat richer.","Once when the boy’s face reminded him very much of Kamala, Siddhartha suddenly remembered something Kamala had once said to him a long time before, in the days of their youth. “You cannot love,” she had said, and he had agreed that she was right, comparing himself to a star and the child people to falling leaves; nonetheless, he had felt a reproach in what she’d said. It was true that he had never been able to lose himself entirely in another person, give himself to another, forget himself, commit the follies of love for the sake of another; never had he been able to do this—and this, it had seemed to him at the time, was the great difference separating him from the child people.

"»Höre gut, Lieber, höre gut! Der Sünder, der ich bin und der du bist, der ist Sünder, aber er wird einst wieder Brahma sein, er wird einst Nirvana erreichen, wird Buddha sein – und nun siehe: dies »Einst« ist Täuschung, ist nur Gleichnis! Der Sünder ist nicht auf dem Weg zur Buddhaschaft unterwegs, er ist nicht in einer Entwickelung begriffen, obwohl unser Denken sich die Dinge nicht anders vorzustellen weiß. Nein, in dem Sünder ist, ist jetzt und heute schon der künftige Buddha, seine Zukunft ist alle schon da, du hast in ihm, in dir, in jedem den werdenden, den möglichen, den verborgenen Buddha zu verehren. Die Welt, Freund Govinda, ist nicht unvollkommen, oder auf einem langsamen Wege zur Vollkommenheit begriffen: nein, sie ist in jedem Augenblick vollkommen, alle Sünde trägt schon die Gnade in sich, alle kleinen Kinder haben schon den Greis in sich, alle Säuglinge den Tod, alle Sterbenden das ewige Leben. Es ist keinem Menschen möglich, vom anderen zu sehen, wie weit er auf seinem Wege sei, im Räuber und Würfelspieler wartet Buddha, im Brahmanenwartet der Räuber. Es gibt, in der tiefen Meditation, die Möglichkeit, die Zeit aufzuheben, alles gewesene, seiende und sein werdende Leben als gleichzeitig zu sehen, und da ist alles gut, alles vollkommen, alles ist Brahm an. Darum scheint mir das, was ist, gut, es scheint mir Tod wie Leben, Sünde wie Heiligkeit, Klugheit wie Torheit, alles muss so sein, alles bedarf nur meiner Zustimmung, nur meiner Willigkeit, meines liebenden Einverständnisses, so ist es für mich gut, kann mich nur fördern, kann mir nie schaden. Ich habe an meinem Leibe und an meiner Seele erfahren, dass ich der Sünde sehr bedurfte, ich bedurfte der Wollust, des Strebens nach Gütern, der Eitelkeit, und bedurfte der schmählichsten Verzweiflung, um das Widerstreben aufgeben zu lernen, um die Welt lieben zu lernen, um sie nicht mehr mit irgendeiner von mir gewünschten, von mir eingebildeten Welt zu vergleichen, einer von mir ausgedachten Art der Vollkommenkeit, sondern sie zu lassen, wie sie ist, und sie zu lieben, und ihr gerne anzugehören. – Dies, o Govinda, sind einige,von den Gedanken, die mir in den Sinn gekommen sind.«","»Listen well, dear, hear well! The sinner that I am and that you are is a sinner, but he will one day be Brahma again, he will one day reach Nirvana, will be Buddha - and now behold: this ""one day"" is deception, is only a simile! The sinner is not on the way to Buddhahood, he is not evolving, although our minds cannot picture things differently. No, in the sinner is the future Buddha, now and today, his future is all already there, you have to honor the emerging, the possible, the hidden Buddha in him, in you, in everyone. The world, friend Govinda, is not imperfect, or on a slow path to perfection: no, it is perfect in every moment, all sin already has grace in it, all small children already have the old man in them, all babies the death, all dying eternal life. It is not possible for any human being to see from the other how far he is on his way; Buddha awaits in the robber and dice player, the robber awaits in the Brahmin. In deep meditation there is the possibility of suspending time, of seeing all life that has been, is and will be simultaneously, and then everything is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman. That's why what is seems good to me, it seems to me death like life, sin like holiness, wisdom like folly, everything has to be like this, everything only needs my consent, only my willingness, my loving consent, then it's good for me , can only help me, can never hurt me. I experienced in my body and in my soul that I needed sin very much, I needed lust, the striving for goods, vanity, and needed the most shameful despair to learn to give up resistance, to learn to love the world , to no longer compare it to some world I wish, some world I imagine, some kind of perfection I devise, but to leave it as it is and to love it and be happy to belong to it. – These, O Govinda, are some of the thoughts that have come to my mind.«","“Listen well, dear friend, listen well! The sinner that I am and that you are is a sinner, but someday he will be a Brahmin again, some day he will achieve Nirvana, he will be a Buddha. And now listen: This ‘someday’ is an illusion, is merely a metaphor! The sinner is not on the way to becoming a Buddha, he is not involved in a development, although our thinking cannot imagine things in any other way. No, the sinner now and today, already contains the future Buddha, his future is fully here; you must worship in the sinner, in you, in everyone, the developing, the possible, the hidden Buddha. The world, my friend, Govinda, is not imperfect or developing slowly toward perfection. No, the world is perfect at every moment, all sin already contains grace, all youngsters already contain oldsters, all babies contain death, all the dying contain eternal life. It is not possible for any man to see how far along another man is on his way; Buddha is waiting in robbers and dicers, the robber is waiting in the Brahmin. In deep meditation it is possible to eliminate time, to see all past, all present, all developing life as coexisting, and everything is good, everything perfect, everything is Brahma. This is why that which is seems good to me, death seems like life, sin seems like saintliness, cleverness like foolishness, everything must be like that, everything needs only my assent, only my willingness, my loving agreement; it is good for me like that , it can never harm me. In my body and in my soul I realized that I greatly needed sin, I needed lust, vanity, the striving for goods, and I needed the most shameful despair to learn how to give up resistance, to learn how to love the world, to stop comparing the world with any world that I wish for, that I imagine, with any perfection that I think up; I learned how to let the world be as it is, and to love it and to belong to it gladly. Those, O Govinda, are some of the thoughts that have crossed my mind.”","“Listen well, my dear friend, listen well! The sinner who I am and who you are is a sinner, but one day he will again be Brahman, he will one day reach Nirvana, will be a Buddha—and now behold : This one day is an illusion, it is only an allegory! The sinner is not on his way to the state of Buddhahood, he is not caught up in a process of developing, although our thought cannot imagine things in any other way. No, in this sinner the future Buddha already exists—now, today—all his future is already there. In him, in yourself, in everyone you must worship the future Buddha, the potential Buddha, the hidden Buddha. The world, friend Govinda, is not imperfect, nor is it in the middle of a long path to perfection. No, it is perfect in every moment; every sin already carries forgiveness within it, all little children already carry their aged forms within them, all infants death, all dying men eternal life. It is not possible for anyone to see how far any other person has come along his path. Buddha waits within the robber and the dice player, and the robber waits in the Brahmin. In the deepest meditation we have the possibility of negating time, of seeing all life, all having-been, being, and becoming, as simultaneous, and then everything is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman. Therefore everything that is appears good to me. Death appears to me like life, sin like holiness, cleverness like folly; everything must be just as it is, everything requires only my assent, only my willingness, my loving approval, and for me it is good and can never harm me. I experienced by observing my own body and my own soul that I sorely needed sin, sorely needed concupiscence, needed greed, vanity, and the most shameful despair to learn to stop resisting, to learn to love the world and stop comparing it to some world I only wished for and imagined, some sort of perfection I myself had dreamed up, but instead to let it be as it was and to love it and be happy to belong to it. “These, O Govinda, are a few of the thoughts that have come into my mind.”"

"Siddhartha lauschte. Er war nun ganz Lauscher, ganz ins Zuhören vertieft, ganz leer, ganz einsaugend, er fühlte, dass er nun das Lauschen zu Ende gelernt habe. Oft schon hatte er all dies gehört, diese vielen Stimmen im Fluss, heute klang es neu. Schon konnte er die vielen Stimmen nicht mehr unterscheiden, nicht frohe von weinenden, nicht kindliche von männlichen, sie gehörten alle zusammen, Klage der Sehnsucht und Lachen des Wissenden, Schrei des Zorns und Stöhnen der Sterbenden, alles war eins, alles war ineinander verwoben und verknüpft, tausendfach verschlungen. Und alles zusammen, alle Stimmen, alle Ziele, alles Sehnen, alle Leiden, alle Lust, alles Gute und Böse, alles zusammen war die Welt. Alles zusammen war der Fluss des Geschehens, war die Musik des Lebens. Und wenn Siddhartha aufmerksam diesem Fluss, diesem tausendstimmigen Liede lauschte, wenn er nicht auf das Leid noch auf das Lachen hörte, wenn er seine Seele nicht an irgendeine Stimme band und mit seinem Ich in sie einging, sondern alle hörte, das Ganze, die Einheit vernahm, dann bestand das große Lied der tausend Stimmen aus einem einzigen Worte, das hieß OM: die Vollendung.","Siddhartha listened. He was now a mere eavesdropper, completely engrossed in listening, completely empty, completely absorbing, he felt that he had now learned to listen to the end. He had often heard all this, all these voices in the river, today it sounded new. Already he could no longer distinguish the many voices, not happy from crying, not childish from male, they all belonged together, lamentation of longing and laughter of the knowing, cry of anger and groaning of the dying, everything was one, everything was interwoven and linked, entwined a thousandfold. And everything together, all voices, all goals, all longing, all suffering, all desire, all good and bad, all together was the world. Everything together was the flow of events, was the music of life. And when Siddhartha listened attentively to this flow, to this thousand-voiced song, when he did not listen to suffering or laughter, when he did not bind his soul to any voice and enter into it with his ego, but heard everyone, the whole, the unity heard, then the great song of a thousand voices consisted of a single word, that was OM: the perfection.","Siddhartha listened.

"Er sah seines Freundes Siddhartha Gesicht nicht mehr, er sah statt dessen andre Gesichter, viele, eine lange Reihe, einen strömenden Fluss von Gesichtern, von hunderten, von tausenden, welche alle kamen und vergingen, und doch alle zugleich dazusein schienen, welche alle sich beständig veränderten und erneuerten, und welche doch alle Siddhartha waren.

"Da mahnte ihn einst ein Traum. Er war die Abendstunden bei Kamala gewesen, in ihrem schönen Lustgarten. Sie waren unter den Bäumen gesessen, im Gespräch, und Kamala hatte nachdenkliche Worte gesagt, Worte, hinter welchen sich eine Trauer und Müdigkeit verbarg. Von Gotama hatte sie ihn gebeten zu erzählen, und konnte nicht genug von ihm hören, wie rein sein Auge, wie still und schön sein Mund, wie gütig sein Lächeln, wie friedevoll sein Gang gewesen. Lange hatte er ihr vom erhabenen Buddha erzählen müssen, und Kamala hatte geseufzt, und hatte gesagt: Einst, vielleicht bald, werde auch ich diesem Buddha folgen. Ich werde ihm meinen Lustgarten schenken, und werde meine Zuflucht zu seiner Lehre nehmen.« Darauf aber hatte sie ihn gereizt, und ihn im Liebesspiel mit schmerzlicher Inbrunst an sich gefesselt, unter Bissen und unter Tränen, als wolle sie noch einmal aus dieser eiteln, vergänglichen Lust den letzten süßen Tropfen pressen. Nie war es Siddhartha so seltsam klar geworden, wie nahe die Wollust dem Tode verwandt ist. Dann war er an ihrer Seite gelegen, und Kamalas Antlitz war ihm nahe gewesen, und unter ihren Augen und neben ihren Mundwinkeln hatte er, deutlich wie noch niemals, eine bange Schrift gelesen, eine Schrift von feinen Linien, von leisen Furchen, eine Schrift, die an den Herbst und an das Alter erinnerte, wie denn auch Siddhartha selbst, der erst in den Vierzigern stand, schon hier und dort ergraute Haare zwischen seinen schwarzen bemerkt hatte. Müdigkeit stand auf Kamalas schönem Gesicht geschrieben, Müdigkeit vom Gehen eines langen Weges, der kein frohes Ziel hat, Müdigkeit und beginnende Welke, und verheimlichte, noch nicht gesagte, vielleicht noch nicht einmal gewusste Bangigkeit: Furcht vor dem Alter, Furcht vor dem Herbste, Furcht vor dem Sterbenmüssen. Seufzend hatte er von ihr Abschied genommen, die Seele voll Unlust, und voll verheimlichter Bangigkeit.","A dream once reminded him. He had been with Kamala in the evening hours, in her beautiful pleasure garden. They had sat under the trees, talking, and Kamala had said thoughtful words, words behind which a sadness and weariness hid. She had asked him to tell about Gotama and could not hear enough of him, how pure his eyes, how still and beautiful his mouth, how kind his smile, how peaceful his walk. He had had to tell her about the sublime Buddha for a long time, and Kamala sighed and said: One day, maybe soon, I too will follow this Buddha. I will give him my pleasure garden, and I will take refuge in his teaching."" But then she had provoked him, and in lovemaking had tied him to her with painful fervor, biting and tearing, as if she wanted to get out of it once more, squeeze the last sweet drop of fleeting lust. It was never so strangely clear to Siddhartha how closely related lust is to death. Then he had lain by her side and Kamala's face had been close to him, and under her eyes and around the corners of her mouth he had read, more clearly than ever before, an anxious writing, a writing of fine lines, of gentle furrows, a writing which reminded of autumn and old age, just as Siddhartha himself, who was only in his forties, had already noticed here and there gray hair between his black ones. Tiredness was written on Kamala's beautiful face, tiredness from walking a long path that has no happy destination, tiredness and the onset of withering, and concealed anxiety that has not yet been said, perhaps not even known: fear of old age, fear of autumn, fear of dying. He had bid her farewell with a sigh, his soul full of displeasure and full of hidden anxiety.","Then one night he was warned by a dream. He had spent the evening with Kamala, in her beautiful pleasure garden. They had sat conversing under the trees, and Kamala had spoken pensive words, words concealing sadness and weariness. She had asked him to talk about Gautama and she could not hear enough about him: how pure his eyes, how still and lovely his lips, how kind his smile, how peaceful his gait. Siddhartha had had to talk and talk to her about the sublime Buddha, and Kamala had sighed and had said: “Someday, perhaps soon, I too will follow this Buddha. I will give him my pleasure garden and will take refuge with his Teaching.” But thereupon she had teased him and gripped him with painful ardor in the game of love, amid bites and tears, as if trying to squeeze the last sweet drop from this vain and ephemeral pleasure. Never had it been so strangely clear to Siddhartha how closely lust is related to death. Next, he had lain at her side, and Kamala’s face had been near his, and under her eyes and next to the corners of her mouth he had more clearly than ever before read an anxious handwriting, a writing of fine lines, of quiet furrows, a writing that recalled autumn and old age, just as Siddhartha himself, though only in his forties, had noticed gray hairs here and there in his black hair. Fatigue was written on Kamala’s beautiful face, fatigue caused by going a long way that has no cheerful end, fatigue and the start of fading, and secret, unspoken, and perhaps not even conscious anxiety: fear of old age, fear of autumn, fear of death. He had parted from her with a sigh, his soul full of surfeit and full of secret anxiety.","Then one day a dream came to warn him. He had spent the evening hours with Kamala in her beautiful pleasure garden. They had sat beneath the trees, deep in conversation, and Kamala had spoken sober words, words behind which grief and weariness lay hidden. She had asked him to tell her about Gautama and couldn’t get enough of hearing how pure his eyes were, how still and beautiful his mouth, how kind his smile, how peaceful his gait. Having made him go on telling stories of the sublime Buddha for a long time, Kamala had sighed and said, “One day, perhaps soon, I too will follow this Buddha. I will give him my pleasure garden and take refuge in his doctrine.” But then she aroused him and bound him to her in love play with an anguished passion, biting him and wetting him with tears, as if trying to squeeze the last sweet drop from this vain, transitory pleasure. Never before had it seemed so strangely clear to Siddhartha how closely sensuality was linked to death. He had lain at Kamala’s side with her face close beside his, and beneath her eyes and beside the corners of her mouth he was able to read clearly as never before an anxious script, a writing made of tiny lines, quiet furrows, writing that called to mind autumn and age, just as Siddhartha himself, who was only in his forties, had already noticed gray hairs here and there among the black. Weariness was inscribed in Kamala’s beautiful face, weariness from walking a long path that had no happy goal, weariness and the first signs of withering, and a secret anxiety, not yet uttered, perhaps not yet even recognized: fear of old age, fear of autumn, fear of having to die. Sighing, he had taken leave of her, his soul full of reluctance and secret apprehension."
"Lange noch wandelten die Freunde im Gehölz, lange lagen sie und fanden nicht den Schlaf. Und immer von neuem drang Govinda in seinen Freund, er möge ihm sagen, warum er nicht seine Zuflucht zu Gotamas Lehre nehmen wolle, welchen Fehler denn er in dieser Lehre finde. Siddhartha aber wies ihn jedesmal zurück und sagte: »Gib dich zufrieden, Govinda! Sehr gut ist des Erhabenen Lehre, wie sollte ich einen Fehler an ihr finden?«","For a long time the friends wandered in the woods, they lay for a long time and could not sleep. And again and again Govinda urged his friend to tell him why he didn't want to take refuge in Gotama's teachings, what mistakes he found in these teachings.

Very good is the teaching of the Blessed One, how should I find fault in it?”","For a long time the friends walked through the woods, for a long time they lay and found no sleep. And Govinda kept urging his friend to tell him why he did not want to take refuge in Gautama’s Teaching, tell him what failing he found in this Teaching.

The Sublime One’s Teaching is very good; how could I find a failing in it?”","The friends continued their stroll through the coppice for a long time; for a long time they lay and could not find sleep. Again and again Govinda pressed his friend to tell him why he would not take refuge in Gautama’s teachings, what errors he saw in his doctrine. But Siddhartha turned him away each time, saying, “Be satisfied, Govinda! The teachings of the Sublime One are excellent; how could I find an error in them?”"
"»Ich habe ihn verloren, oder er mich. Er ist mir abhanden gekommen. Schnell dreht sich das Rad der Gestaltungen, Govinda. Wo ist der Brahmane Siddhartha? Wo ist der Samana Siddhartha? Wo ist der Reiche Siddhartha? Schnell wechselt das Vergängliche, Govinda, du weißt es.","'I lost him or he lost me. I lost him. The wheel of formation turns quickly, Govinda. Where is the Brahmin Siddhartha? Where is the Samana Siddhartha? Where is the rich Siddhartha? The ephemeral changes quickly, Govinda, you know it.","“I have lost it, or it has lost me. It has gone astray. The wheel of formations turns swiftly, Govinda. Where is Siddhartha the Brahmin? Where is Siddhartha the samana? Where is Siddhartha the rich man?

"»Ich danke dir, Samana, dass du meinen Schlaf behütet hast,« sprach Siddhartha. »Freundlich seid Ihr Jünger des Erhabenen. Nun magst du denn gehen.«","""Thank you, Samana, for protecting my sleep,"" said Siddhartha. 'Kindly are you disciples of the Exalted. Now you may go.”","“Thank you, samana, for guarding my sleep,” said Siddhartha. “You disciples of the Sublime One are friendly. Go now.”","“I thank you, Samana, for guarding my sleep,” Siddhartha said. “You disciples of the Sublime One are most kind. Now you may go.”"
"»Willkommen sei dein Sohn auch mir. Nun aber, Siddhartha, lass uns an die Arbeit gehen, viel ist zu tun. Auf demselben Lager ist Kamala gestorben, auf welchem einst mein Weib gestorben ist.

"Den nächsten Menschen, der des Weges kam, fragte er nach dem Hain und nach dem Namen dieser Frau, und erfuhr, dass dies der Hain der Kamala war, der berühmten Kurtisane, und dass sie außer dem Haine ein Haus in der Stadt besaß.","He asked the next person who came his way about the grove and the name of this woman, and learned that this was the grove of Kamala, the famous courtesan, and that besides the grove she had a house in the city.","He stopped the very next person he met, inquired about the grove, and asked for that woman’s name, and he learned that this was the grove of Kamala, the renowned courtesan, and that aside from the grove she owned a house in town.","He asked the next person to come along what this grove was and the name of the woman, and learned that this was the grove of Kamala, the famous courtesan, and that in addition to the grove she owned a house in town."
"Siddhartha erwachte wie aus einem Schlafe, als er Govindas Worte vernahm. Lange blickte er in Govindas Gesicht. Dann sprach er leise, mit einer Stimme ohne Spott: »Govinda, mein Freund, nun hast du den Schritt getan, nun hast du den Weg erwählt. Immer, o Govinda, bist du mein Freund gewesen, immer bist du einen Schritt hinter mir gegangen. Oft habe ich gedacht: Wird Govinda nicht auch einmal einen Schritt allein tun, ohne mich, aus der eigenen Seele? Siehe, nun bist du ein Mann geworden und wählst selber deinen Weg. Mögest du ihn zu Ende gehen, o mein Freund! Mögest du Erlösung finden!«","Siddhartha woke up as if from a sleep when he heard Govinda's words. He looked into Govinda's face for a long time. Then he spoke softly, in a voice without mockery: 'Govinda, my friend, now you have taken the step, now you have chosen the way. Always, O Govinda, you have been my friend, you have always walked a step behind me. I've often thought: Won't Govinda take a step alone, without me, out of his own soul? Behold, now you have become a man and you choose your own way. May you finish it, O my friend! May you find salvation!«","Siddhartha, upon hearing Govinda’s words, awoke as if from a dream.

You have always, O Govinda, been my friend, you have always walked a step behind me. I have often wondered: ‘Will Govinda ever take a step alone, without me, prompted by his own soul?’ Look, now you have become a man and are choosing your own path. May you walk it to its end, O my friend! May you find deliverance!”","Siddhartha awoke as if from slumber when he heard Govinda’s words. For a long time he gazed into Govinda’s face. Then he said softly, in a voice free of mockery, “Govinda, my friend, now you have taken the step, now you have chosen the path. Always, O Govinda, you have been my friend, and always you have walked one step behind me. Often I have thought, Will not Govinda one day take a step on his own without me, as his own soul commands? And behold, now you have become a man and are choosing your own path. May you follow it to its end, O my friend! May you find redemption!”"
"Kamala blickte ihm unverwandt in die Augen. Sie dachte daran, dass sie zu Gotama hatte pilgern wollen, um das Gesicht eines Vollendeten zu sehen, um seinen Frieden zu atmen, und dass sie statt seiner nun ihn gefunden, und dass es gut war, ebenso gut, als wenn sie jenen gesehen hätte. Sie wollte es ihm sagen, aber die Zunge gehorchte ihrem Willen nicht mehr. Schweigend sah sie ihn an, und er sah in ihren Augen das Leben erlöschen. Als der letzte Schmerz ihr Auge erfüllte und brach, als der letzte Schauder über ihre Glieder lief, schloss sein Finger ihre Lider.","Kamala looked him straight in the eye. She remembered that she had wanted to make a pilgrimage to Gotama, to see the face of a perfect one, to breathe his peace, and that instead of him she found him, and that it was good, just as good as if she had seen that one . She wanted to tell him, but her tongue no longer obeyed her will. She looked at him in silence and he saw the life go out in her eyes. As the last pain filled and broke her eye, as the last shudder ran down her limbs, his finger closed her lids.","Kamala gazed steadily into his eyes. She recalled wanting to go on a pilgrimage to Gautama, to see the face of the Perfect Man, to breathe his peace. And now instead she had found Siddhartha, and that was good, it was just as good as if she had seen the other. She wanted to tell him, but her tongue no longer obeyed her will. Silently she looked at him, and he saw the light fading in her eyes. When the final pain filled her eyes and broke, when the final shudder ran through her limbs, his finger closed her lids.","Kamala gazed intently into his eyes.

She wanted to tell him this, but her tongue would no longer obey her will. Silently she gazed at him, and he watched as the life ebbed from her eyes. When the final agony had filled them and left them lifeless, when the final shudder had trembled through her body, he ran his fingers down her eyelids to close them."
"»Wohl hast du beobachtet, alles hast du gesehen. Du hast Siddhartha gesehen, den Brahmanensohn, welcher seine Heimat verlassen hat, um ein Samana zu werden, und drei Jahre lang ein Samana gewesen ist. Nun aber habe ich jenen Pfad verlassen, und kam in diese Stadt, und die erste, die mir noch vor dem Betreten der Stadt begegnete, warst du. Dies zu sagen, bin ich zu dir gekommen, o Kamala!

"Einstmals, als die beiden Jünglinge gegen drei Jahre bei den Samanas gelebt und ihre Übungen geteilt hatten, da erreichte sie auf mancherlei Wegen und Umwegen eine Kunde, ein Gerücht, eine Sage: Einer sei erschienen, Gotama genannt, der Erhabene, der Buddha, der habe in sich das Leid der Welt überwunden und das Rad der Wiedergeburten zum Stehen gebracht. Lehrend ziehe er, von Jüngern umgeben, durch das Land, besitzlos, heimatlos, weiblos, im gelben Mantel eines Asketen, aber mit heiterer Stirn, ein Seliger, und Brahmanen und Fürsten beugten sich vor ihm und würden seine Schüler.","Once upon a time, when the two youths had been living with the Samanas for about three years and had shared their exercises, word reached them through various paths and detours, a rumor, a legend: One had appeared, called Gotama, the sublime, the Buddha, the overcame the suffering of the world and brought the wheel of reincarnation to a standstill. Surrounded by disciples he would travel through the land teaching, without property, homeless, womanless, in the yellow cloak of an ascetic, but with a cheerful brow, a blessed one, and Brahmins and princes bowed down to him and became his students.","Once, after the two youths had spent some three years with the samanas, sharing their exercises, a report, a rumor, a legend reached them through various roads and roundabout routes: someone had appeared, named Gautama, the Sublime One, the Buddha. He had supposedly overcome the sorrow of the world in himself and had stopped the wheel of rebirths. Teaching and surrounded by disciples, he was wandering through the land, with no property, with no home, with no wife, in the yellow cloak of an ascetic, but with a serene brow: a blissful man. And Brahmins and princes were bowing to him and becoming his followers.","One day when the two youths had lived among the Samanas for nearly three years and shared their exercises, word reached them in a roundabout way, a rumor, a legend: A man had been discovered, by the name of Gautama, the Sublime One, the Buddha, who had overcome the sufferings of the world within himself and brought the wheel of rebirths to a halt.

"Sprach Vasudeva: »Bring ihn zur Stadt, bringe ihn in seiner Mutter Haus, es werden noch Diener dort sein, denen gib ihn.

Die Menschen von unserer Art können vielleicht nicht lieben. Die Kindermenschen können es; das ist ihr Geheimnis.«","""It may well be so,"" said Siddhartha wearily. 'I'm like you. You don't love either - otherwise how could you 'practice love as an art? Our kind of people may not be able to love.

"Und in der letzten Nachtstunde, ehe der Tag begann, kehrte er wieder, trat in die Kammer, sah den Jüngling stehen, der ihm groß und wie fremd erschien.","And in the last hour of the night, before day began, he returned, stepped into the room, saw the youth standing there, who seemed tall and strange to him.","And in the final hour of night, before the day began, he returned, stepped into the room, and saw the youth standing there, and he looked big and foreign.","And in the last hour of night before day began, he got up once more, went into the room, and saw the youth standing there; he looked tall to him and like a stranger."
"So betrete ich diese Stadt, dachte Siddhartha, unter einem holden Zeichen. Es zog ihn, sogleich in den Hain zu treten, doch bedachte er sich, und nun erst ward ihm bewusst, wie ihn die Diener und Mägde am Eingang betrachtet hatten, wie verächtlich, wie misstrauisch, wie abweisend.","This is how I enter this city, Siddhartha thought, under a sweet sign. He felt drawn to step straight into the grove, but he considered it, and only now did he realize how the servants and maids at the entrance had looked at him, how contemptuously, how suspiciously, how dismissively.","So I come to this town, thought Siddhartha, under a lucky star.

He felt an urge to hurry into the grove straightaway but then thought better of it; only now did it occur to him how the servants and maids standing at its entrance had looked at him, with what contempt, what suspicion, what displeasure."
"Unterwegs sagte Govinda: »O Siddhartha, du hast bei den Samanas mehr gelernt, als ich wusste. Es ist schwer, es ist sehr schwer, einen alten Samana zu bezaubern. Wahrlich, wärest du dort geblieben, du hättest bald gelernt, auf dem Wasser zu gehen.«","On the way Govinda said: »O Siddhartha, you learned more from the Samanas than I knew. It's hard, it's very hard to charm an old Samana. Truly, if you had stayed there, you would soon have learned to walk on water.""","On their way, Govinda said: “O Siddhartha, you have learned more from the samanas than I realized. It is hard, it is very hard to spellbind an old samana. Truly, had you remained there, you would soon have learned how to walk on water.”","As they walked, Govinda said, “O Siddhartha, you learned more among the Samanas than I knew. It is difficult, very difficult, to enchant an old Samana. Verily, if you had remained there among them, you would soon have learned to walk upon water!”"

"Siddhartha lachte. »Schon einmal bin ich heute um meiner Kleider willen betrachtet worden, mit Misstrauen betrachtet. Willst du nicht, Fährmann, diese Kleider, die mir lästig sind, von mir annehmen? Denn du musst wissen, ich habe kein Geld, dir einen Fährlohn zu zahlen.«","Siddhartha laughed. 'I've been looked at before, today, for my clothes, looked at with suspicion. Won't you, ferryman, take these clothes from me, which are a nuisance to me?

Ferryman, would you not like to accept these clothes, which are a burden to me? For you must know: I have no money to pay you the fare.”","Siddhartha laughed. “This is not the first time I have been scrutinized this day on account of my clothing, scrutinized with distrust. Ferryman, would you accept these clothes, which are a burden to me? For you should know that I have no money with which to pay your fare.”"
"Siddhartha hatte gelernt, Handel zu treiben, Macht über Menschen auszuüben, sich mit dem Weibe zu vergnügen, er hatte gelernt, schöne Kleider zu tragen, Dienern zu befehlen, sich in wohlriechenden Wassern zu baden. Er hatte gelernt, zart und sorgfältig bereitete Speisen zu essen, auch den Fisch, auch Fleisch und Vogel, Gewürze und Süßigkeiten, und den Wein zu trinken, der träge und vergessen macht. Er hatte gelernt, mit Würfeln und auf dem Schachbrette zu spielen, Tänzerinnen zuzusehen, sich in der Sänfte tragen zu lassen, auf einem weichen Bett zu schlafen. Aber immer noch hatte er sich von den andern verschieden und ihnen überlegen gefühlt, immer hatte er ihnen mit ein wenig Spott zugesehen, mit ein wenig spöttischer Verachtung, mit eben jener Verachtung, wie sie ein Samana stets für Weltleute fühlt. Wenn Kamaswami kränklich war, wenn er ärgerlich war, wenn er sich beleidigt fühlte, wenn er von seinen Kaufmannssorgen geplagt wurde, immer hatte Siddhartha es mit Spott angesehen. Langsam und unmerklich nur, mit den dahingehenden Erntezeiten und Regenzeiten, war sein Spott müder geworden, war seine Überlegenheit stiller geworden. Langsam nur, zwischen seinen wachsenden Reichtümern, hatte Siddhartha selbst etwas von der Art der Kindermenschen angenommen, etwas von ihrer Kindlichkeit und von ihrer Ängstlichkeit. Und doch beneidete er sie, beneidete sie desto mehr, je ähnlicher er ihnen wurde. Er beneidete sie um das Eine, was ihm fehlte und was sie hatten, um die Wichtigkeit, welche sie ihrem Leben beizulegen vermochten, um die Leidenschaftlichkeit ihrer Freuden und Ängste, um das bange, aber süße Glück ihrer ewigen Verliebtheit. In sich selbst, in Frauen, in ihre Kinder, in Ehre oder Geld, in Pläne oder Hoffnungen verliebt waren diese Menschen immerzu. Er aber lernte dies nicht von ihnen, gerade dies nicht, diese Kinderfreude und Kindertorheit; er lernte von ihnen gerade das Unangenehme, was er selbst verachtete. Es geschah immer öfter, dass er am Morgen nach einem geselligen Abend lange liegen blieb und sich dumpf und müde fühlte. Es geschah, dass er ärgerlich und ungeduldig wurde, wenn Kamaswami ihn mit seinen Sorgen lang weilte. Es geschah, dass er allzu laut lachte, wenn er im Würfelspiel verlor. Sein Gesicht war noch immer klüger und geistiger als andre, aber es lachte selten, und nahm einen um den andern jene Züge an, die man im Gesicht reicher Leute so häufig findet, jene Züge der Unzufriedenheit, der Kränklichkeit, des Missmutes, der Trägheit, der Lieblosigkeit. Langsam ergriff ihn die Seelenkrankheit der Reichen.","Siddhartha had learned to trade, to exercise power over people, to have fun with women, he had learned to wear beautiful clothes, to order servants to bathe in fragrant water. He had learned to eat tender and carefully prepared food, including fish, meat and birds, spices and sweets, and to drink the wine that makes you lazy and forgetful. He had learned to play with dice and on the chessboard, to watch dancers, to be carried in a sedan chair, to sleep on a soft bed. But he had always felt different from the others and superior to them, he had always looked at them with a little mockery, with a little mocking contempt, with just that contempt that a Samana always feels for people of the world. When Kamaswami was sick, when he was angry, when he felt insulted, when he was plagued by his business concerns, Siddhartha always looked at it with scorn. Slowly and imperceptibly, as the harvest and rainy seasons passed, his mockery grew weary, his superiority quieter. Only slowly, between his growing riches, did Siddhartha himself take on something of the childlike nature, something of their childishness and their timidity. And yet he envied them, envied them all the more the more he resembled them. He envied her the one thing he lacked and what they had, the importance they were able to attach to their lives, the passion of their joys and fears, the anxious but sweet happiness of their everlasting love. These people were always in love with themselves, with women, with their children, with honor or money, with plans or hopes. But he didn't learn this from them, precisely not this, this childish joy and childish folly; he learned from them precisely what was unpleasant, which he himself despised. It was becoming more and more common for him to lie down late in the morning after a social evening, feeling dull and tired. It happened that he became angry and impatient when Kamaswami bored him with his worries. It happened that he laughed too loudly when he lost at dice. His face was still smarter and more intellectual than others, but it seldom laughed, and gradually took on those features that one so often finds in the faces of rich people, those features of dissatisfaction, sickness, displeasure, indolence, of lovelessness. The mental illness of the rich slowly took hold of him.","Siddhartha had learned how to do business, wield power over people, take pleasure with a woman; he had learned how to wear beautiful clothes, command servants, bathe in fragrant water. He had learned how to eat delicately and meticulously prepared dishes, including fish, including meat and fowl, sweets and spices, and to drink wine, which makes you slothful and forgetful. He had learned how to dice and play chess, watch dancing girls, be carried in a sedan, sleep on a soft bed. Yet he still felt different from others and superior to them; he had always watched them with a touch of scoffing, with a touch of scorn, the very scorn that a samana always feels toward people of the world. When Kamaswami was ailing, when he was angry, when he felt offended, when he was plagued by his merchant worries, Siddhartha had watched him scornfully. Only slowly and imperceptibly, with the passing harvest seasons and rainy seasons, had his scorn grown weary, had his superiority grown stiller. Only slowly, amid his grown riches, had Siddhartha himself taken on something of the ways of the child people, something of their childishness and their anxiety. And yet he envied them, envied them all the more the more he resembled them. He envied them for the one thing that he lacked and that they had: the importance they were able to place on their lives, the passionateness of their joys and fears, the queasy but sweet happiness of being eternally in love. These men were constantly in love with themselves, with women, with their children, with honor or money, with plans or hopes. But this was not what he learned from them, not this, this childlike joy and folly; what he learned from them were the unpleasant things, the things that he himself despised. It happened more and more often that in the morning, after a convivial evening, he would lie and linger on in bed, feeling stupid and tired. It happened that he became annoyed and impatient when Kamaswami bored him with his worries. It happened that he laughed all too loudly when he lost at dice. His face was still wiser and more spiritual than others, but it seldom laughed and it took on, one after another, those features found so often in the faces of the rich, those features of discontent, sickliness, sulkiness, sluggishness, lovelessness. Slowly he was stricken with the spiritual illness of the rich.","Siddhartha had learned to conduct business, to wield power over people, to take pleasure with a woman; he had learned to wear nice clothes, give orders to servants, and bathe in sweet-smelling water. He had learned to eat dishes prepared with delicacy and care, even fish, even flesh and fowl, spices and sweets, and to drink wine, which brings lethargy and forgetfulness. He had learned to throw dice and play chess, to be entertained by dancing girls, have himself carried about in a sedan chair, sleep in a soft bed. But still he had felt himself to be different from the others, superior to them, still he had watched them with a certain disdain, a certain contempt, that very contempt a Samana always feels for the worldly. When Kamaswami was indisposed, when he was cross, when he felt slighted, when he was tortured by his mercantile woes, Siddhartha had always observed this disdainfully Only slowly and imperceptibly, with the coming and going of the harvests and monsoons, had his disdain grown weary, his superiority waned. Only slowly, among his growing riches, had Siddhartha himself taken on some of the characteristics of the child people, something of their childlike manner and fearfulness. And yet he envied them, envying them more the more he came to resemble them. He envied them the one thing they possessed that he was lacking: the importance they were capable of attaching to their lives, their passionate joys and fears, the happiness, uneasy but sweet, of their eternal infatuations. For infatuated they were—with themselves, with women, with their children, with honor or money, with plans or hopes. But this childish joy and childish folly he had not learned from them, this one thing remained unlearned; all he was learning from them were unpleasant things that he himself despised. It happened more and more often now that he remained lying in bed for a long time the day after an evening of conviviality, feeling stupid and weary. It would happen that he became cross and impatient when Kamaswami bored him with his worries. It would happen that he laughed too loudly when he lost at dice. His face was still more clever and spiritual than others, but it seldom smiled, and one after the other it was taking on the traits one so often observes in the faces of the wealthy: that look of dissatisfaction, infirmity, displeasure, lethargy, unkindness. Slowly he was being stricken with the maladies that afflict rich people’s souls."
"Sprach Siddhartha: »Mit deiner Erlaubnis, mein Vater. Ich bin gekommen, dir zu sagen, dass mich verlangt, morgen dein Haus zu verlassen und zu den Asketen zu gehen. Ein Samana zu werden ist mein Verlangen. Möge mein Vater dem nicht entgegen sein.«","Siddhartha spoke: »With your permission, my father. I have come to tell you that tomorrow I want to leave your house and go to the ascetics. Becoming a samana is my desire. May my father not oppose it.”","Siddhartha spoke: “With your permission, my father. I have come to say that I long to leave your house tomorrow and join the ascetics. My longing is to become a samana. May my father have nothing against it.”","Said Siddhartha, “With your permission, my father.

"Beim Aufgang der Sonne sahen sie mit Erstaunen, welch große Schar, Gläubige und Neugierige, hier genächtigt hatte. In allen Wegen des herrlichen Haines wandelten Mönche im gelben Gewand, unter den Bäumen saßen sie hier und dort, in Betrachtung versenkt – oder im geistlichen Gespräch, wie eine Stadt waren die schattigen Gärten zu sehen, voll von Menschen, wimmelnd wie Bienen. Die Mehrzahl der Mönche zog mit der AImosenschale aus, um in der Stadt Nahrung für die Mittagsmahlzeit, die einzige des Tages, zu sammeln. Auch der Buddha selbst, der Erleuchtete, pflegte am Morgen den Bettelgang zu tun.","As the sun rose, they were amazed to see what a large crowd, believers and curious alike, had slept here. In all the ways of the glorious grove wandered monks in yellow robes, under the trees they sat here and there, absorbed in contemplation - or in spiritual conversation, the shady gardens could be seen like a city, full of people, teeming like bees. Most of the monks went out with the alms bowl to collect food in the city for the noon meal, the only meal of the day. Even the Buddha himself, the enlightened one, used to go begging in the morning.","At sunrise they were amazed to see the multitude of the faithful and the curious who had spent the night here.

"Wunderlich in der Tat war mein Leben, so dachte er, wunderliche Umwege hat es genommen. Als Knabe habe ich nur mit Göttern und Opfern zu tun gehabt. Als Jüngling habe ich nur mit Askese, mit Denken und Versenkung zu tun gehabt, war auf der Suche nach Brahman, verehrte das Ewige im Atman. Als junger Mann aber zog ich den Büßern nach, lebte im Walde, litt Hitze und Frost, lernte hungern, lehrte meinen Leib absterben. Wunderbar kam mir alsdann in der Lehre des großen Buddha Erkenntnis entgegen, ich fühlte Wissen um die Einheit der Welt in mir kreisen wie mein eigenes Blut. Aber auch von Buddha und von dem großen Wissen musste ich wieder fort. Ich ging und lernte bei Kamala die Liebeslust, lernte bei Kamaswami den Handel, häufte Geld, vertat Geld, lernte meinen Magen lieben, lernte meinen Sinnen schmeicheln. Viele Jahre musste ich damit hinbringen, den Geist zu verlieren, das Denken wieder zu verlernen, die Einheit zu vergessen. Ist es nicht so, als sei ich langsam und auf großen Umwegen aus einem Mann ein Kind geworden, aus einem Denker ein Kindermensch? Und doch ist dieser Weg sehr gut gewesen, und doch ist der Vogel in meiner Brust nicht gestorben. Aber welch ein Weg war das! Ich habe durch so viel Dummheit, durch so viel Laster, durch so viel Irrtum, durch so viel Ekel und Enttäuschung und Jammer hindurchgehen müssen, bloß um wieder ein Kind zu werden und neu anfangen zu können. Aber es war richtig so, mein Herz sagt Ja dazu, meine Augen lachen dazu. Ich habe Verzweiflung erleben müssen, ich habe hinabsinken müssen bis zum törichtesten aller Gedanken, zum Gedanken des Selbstmordes, um Gnade erleben zu können, um wieder Om zu vernehmen, um wieder richtig schlafen und richtig erwachen zu können. Ich habe ein Tor werden müssen, um Atman wieder in mir zu finden. Ich habe sündigen müssen, um wieder leben zu können. Wohin noch mag mein Weg mich führen? Närrisch ist er, dieser Weg, er geht in Schleifen, er geht vielleicht im Kreise. Mag er gehen, wie er will, ich will ihn gehen.","My life was indeed strange, he thought, it has taken strange detours. As a boy I only dealt with gods and sacrifices. As a youth I was only concerned with asceticism, with thinking and contemplation, was in search of Brahman, worshiped the Eternal in the Atman. But as a young man I followed the penitents, lived in the forest, suffered heat and cold, learned to starve, taught my body to die. Wonderful knowledge then came to me in the teachings of the great Buddha, I felt knowledge of the unity of the world circulating in me like my own blood. But I also had to leave the Buddha and the great knowledge. I went and learned love from Kamala, learned trade from Kamaswami, accumulated money, gambled away money, learned to love my stomach, learned to flatter my senses. I spent many years losing my mind, unlearning how to think, forgetting unity. Isn't it as if I had slowly and in a roundabout way turned from a man into a child, from a thinker into a child? And yet this way has been very good, and yet the bird in my breast has not died. But what a way that was! I've had to go through so much stupidity, through so much vice, through so much error, through so much disgust and disappointment and misery just to be a kid again and start over. But it was right, my heart says yes to it, my eyes laugh to it. I had to experience despair, I had to sink down to the most foolish of all thoughts, to the thought of suicide, in order to be able to experience grace, to hear Om again, to be able to sleep properly and wake up properly again. I had to become a fool to find Atman in me again. I had to sin in order to be able to live again. Where else may my path lead me? It's foolish, this way, it goes in loops, maybe it goes in circles. Let him go as he pleases, I want him to go.","“Peculiar is my life indeed,” he thought, “it has taken peculiar detours. As a boy, I dealt only with gods and sacrifices. As a youth I dealt only with asceticism, with thinking and meditating, seeking Brahma, honoring the eternal in Atman. But as a young man, I followed the penitents, lived in the forest, suffered heat and frost, learned how to hunger, taught my body castigation. Prompt and wonderful, in the Teaching of the great Buddha, enlightenment came to me , I felt knowledge about the oneness of the world circulating in me like my own blood. But then I had to get away from Buddha too and from the great knowledge. I went and learned the pleasure of love from Kamala, learned business from Kamaswami, piled up money, wasted money, learned to love my stomach, learned to flatter my senses. I had to spend many years losing my spirit, unlearning how to think, forgetting the oneness. “Is it not as if I, a man, gradually and very circuitously became a child again, as if I, a thinker, became a child person?

Let it run as it will, I will follow it.”","Curious indeed this life of mine has been, he thought, it has taken such strange detours. As a boy I was concerned only with gods and sacrifices. As a youth I was concerned only with asceticism, with thinking and samadhi; I went searching for Brahman, revered the eternal in Atman. But as a young man I set off after the penitents, lived in the forest, suffered heat and frost, learned to go without food, taught my body to feel nothing. How glorious it was then when realization came to me in the doctrine of the great Buddha; I felt knowledge of the Oneness of the world coursing through me like my own blood. But even the Buddha and his great knowledge had to be left behind. I went off and learned the pleasures of love from Kamala, learned to conduct business from Kamaswami, accumulated money, squandered money, learned to love my stomach, learned to indulge my senses. I had to spend many years losing my spirit, unlearning how to think, forgetting the great Oneness. Is it not as if I were slowly and circuitously turning from a man into a child, from a thinker into one of the child people? And still this path has been very good, and still the bird in my breast has not died. But what a path it has been! I have had to pass through so much foolishness, so much vice, so much error, so much nausea and disillusionment and wretchedness, merely in order to become a child again and be able to start over.

I had to experience despair, I had to sink to the most foolish of all thoughts, the thought of suicide, to be able to experience grace, to hear Om again, to be able to sleep well and awaken well. I had to become a fool to find Atman within me once more. I had to sin to be able to live again. Where else may my path be taking me? How stupid it is, this path of mine; it goes in loops.

"»Entschuldige mich,« sagte er, »aus freundlichem Herzen rede ich zu dir. Ich sehe, dass du dich quälst, ich sehe, dass du Kummer hast. Dein Sohn, Lieber, macht dir Sorge, und auch mir macht er Sorge. An ein anderes Leben, an ein anderes Nest ist der junge Vogel gewöhnt. Nicht wie du ist er dem Reichtum und der Stadt entlaufen aus Ekel und Überdruss, er hat wider seinen Willen dies alles dahinten lassen müssen. Ich fragte den Fluss, o Freund, vielemale habe ich ihn gefragt. Der Fluss aber lacht, er lacht mich aus, mich und dich lacht er aus, und schüttelt sich über unsre Torheit. Wasser will zu Wasser, Jugend will zu Jugend, dein Sohn ist nicht an dem Orte, wo er gedeihen kann. Frage auch du den Fluss, höre auch du auf ihn!«","""Excuse me,"" he said, ""I speak to you from a kind heart. I see that you are tormented, I see that you are troubled. Your son, dear, worries you and he worries me too. The young bird is used to a different life, to a different nest. He didn't run away from wealth and the city like you did out of disgust and weariness, against his will he had to leave it all behind. I asked the river, O friend, many times have I asked it. But the river laughs, it laughs at me, it laughs at me and you, and shudders at our foolishness. Water wants to water, youth wants to youth, your son is not in the place where he can thrive. You too ask the river, you too listen to it!«","“Forgive me,” he said, “but I am talking to you with a friendly heart. I see that you are in torment, I see that you are in anguish. Your son, dear friend, is causing you worry, and he is causing me worry too. The young bird is used to a different life, to a different nest.

Your son, my friend, is making you worry, and I also worry on his account. This young bird is accustomed to a different life, a different nest. Unlike you, he did not flee from wealth, from the city, out of nausea and surfeit; he was forced to leave them behind against his will. I have asked the river, my friend; many times I have asked it.

Your son is not in a place where he can flourish. Ask the river and hear its counsel for yourself!”"
"Reich und glücklich hatte er sich genannt, als der Knabe zu ihm gekommen war. Da indessen die Zeit hinfloss, und der Knabe fremd und finster blieb, da er ein stolzes und trotziges Herz zeigte, keine Arbeit tun wollte, den Alten keine Ehrfurcht erwies, Vasudevas Fruchtbäume beraubte, da begann Siddhartha zu verstehen, dass mit seinem Sohne nicht Glück und Friede zu ihm gekommen war, sondern Leid und Sorge. Aber er liebte ihn, und lieber war ihm Leid und Sorge der Liebe, als ihm Glück und Freude ohne den Knaben gewesen war. Seit der junge Siddhartha in der Hütte war, hatten die Alten sich in die Arbeit geteilt. Vasudeva hatte das Amt des Fährmanns wieder allein übernommen, und Siddhartha, um bei dem Sohne zu sein, die Arbeit in Hütte und Feld.","He had called himself rich and happy when the boy came to him. However, as time passed and the boy remained a stranger and gloomy, because he showed a proud and defiant heart, did not want to do any work, showed no respect to the elderly, robbed Vasudeva's fruit trees, Siddhartha began to understand that there was no luck with his son and peace had come to him, but sorrow and sorrow. But he loved him, and he preferred the sorrow and sorrow of love to happiness and joy without the boy. Ever since young Siddhartha was in the hut, the old people had shared the work. Vasudeva had taken over the job of the ferryman alone again, and Siddhartha, to be with his son, the work in the hut and field.","He had felt rich and happy when the boy had come to him. But time flowed on, and since the boy remained foreign and surly, displaying a proud and defiant heart, refusing to work, showing the old men no respect, robbing Vasudeva’s fruit trees, Siddhartha began to realize that his son had brought not peace and happiness to him but sorrow and suffering. Still, he loved him, and he cherished the sorrow and suffering of love more than joy and happiness without the boy. When young Siddhartha had arrived in the hut, the old men had divided their labor. Vasudeva had taken over as sole ferryman, and Siddhartha the labor in hut and field in order to be with his son.","Rich and happy is what he’d called himself when the boy had come to him. But when with the passing of time the boy remained a sullen stranger, when he displayed a proud and stubborn heart, refused to work, showed no reverence for his elders, and plundered Vasudeva’s fruit trees, Siddhartha began to understand that it was not happiness and peace that had come to him with his son but, rather, sorrow and worry. But he loved him and preferred the sorrow and worry of love to the happiness and peace he had known without the boy. Since young Siddhartha’s arrival in the hut, the two old men had split up their work. Vasudeva had once more begun to perform the duties of ferryman on his own, while Siddhartha, wanting to keep his son near him, took over the work in the hut and the field."

"Vor der Stadt, bei einem schönen umzäunten Haine, begegnete dem Wandernden ein kleiner Tross von Dienern und Dienerinnen, mit Körben beladen. Inmitten in einer geschmückten Sänfte, von Vieren getragen, saß auf roten Kissen unter einem bunten Sonnendach eine Frau, die Herrin. Siddhartha blieb beim Eingang des Lusthaines stehen und sah dem Aufzuge zu, sah die Diener, die Mägde, die Körbe, sah die Sänfte, und sah in der Sänfte die Dame. Unter hochgetürmten schwarzen Haaren sah er ein sehr helles, sehr zartes, sehr kluges Gesicht, hellroten Mund wie eine frisch aufgebrochene Feige, Augenbrauen gepflegt und gemalt in hohen Bogen, dunkle Augen klug und wachsam, lichten hohen Hals aus grün und goldenem Oberkleide steigend, ruhende helle Hände lang und schmal mit breiten Goldreifen über den Gelenken.","In front of the city, near a beautiful fenced grove, the wanderer met a small procession of servants laden with baskets.

Under piled black hair he saw a very fair, very delicate, very clever face, bright red mouth like a freshly broken fig, eyebrows groomed and painted in high arches, dark eyes clever and watchful, clear high neck rising from green and gold upper garment, resting fair hands long and narrow with wide gold bands over the joints.","Outside the town, near a beautiful fenced grove, the wanderer encountered a small train of male and female servants loaded with baskets.

"In der Nacht, da er in der strohernen Hütte eines Fährmanns am Flusse schlief, hatte Siddhartha einen Traum: Govinda stand vor ihm, in einem gelben Asketengewand. Traurig sah Govinda aus, traurig fragte er: Warum hast du mich verlassen? Da umarmte er Govinda, schlang seine Arme um ihn, und indem er ihn an seine Brust zog und küsste, war es nicht Govinda mehr, sondern ein Weib, und aus des Weibes Gewand quoll eine volle Brust, an der lag Siddhartha und trank, süß und stark schmeckte die Milch dieser Brust. Sie schmeckte nach Weib und Mann, nach Sonne und Wald, nach Tier und Blume, nach jeder Frucht, nach jeder Lust. Sie machte trunken und bewusstlos. – Als Siddhartha erwachte, schimmerte der bleiche Fluss durch die Tür der Hütte, und im Walde klang tief und wohllaut ein dunkler Eulenruf.","The night he slept in a ferryman's straw hut by the river, Siddhartha had a dream: Govinda stood before him in a yellow ascetic robe.

She tasted of woman and man, of sun and forest, of animals and flowers, of every fruit, of every desire.

The milk from that breast tasted sweet and strong. It tasted of woman and man, of sun and woods, of creature and flower, of every fruit, of every pleasure. Her milk left him drunk and senseless.

She had been walking beside the river with her little son, but the boy soon grew tired and wanted to go home, wanted to rest, wanted to eat, became stubborn and tearful."
"»Wohl bin ich alt,« sprach Govinda, »zu suchen aber habe ich nicht aufgehört. Nie werde ich aufhören zu suchen, dies scheint meine Bestimmung. Auch du, so scheint es mir, hast gesucht. Willst du mir ein Wort sagen, Verehrter?«","""I am old,"" said Govinda, ""but I have not stopped searching. I will never stop searching, this seems to be my destiny. You too, it seems to me, have been looking. Do you want to say a word to me, dear?""","“It is true, I am old,” said Govinda, “but I have not stopped seeking. Never will I stop seeking—this seems to be my destiny. You too, it seems to me, have sought. Will you say a word to me, Honored One?”","“Indeed, I am old,” Govinda said, “but I have not stopped searching Never will I cease to search; this seems to be my destiny. You too, it seems to me, have done some searching. Will you speak a word to me, Revered One?”"
Das soll man unentwegt treffen.,You should always meet that.,It must be struck unswervingly.,Strike it with steady aim.”
"Und Govinda murmelte einen Vers vor sich hin, einen Vers aus einer Upanishad:","And Govinda murmured a verse, a verse from an Upanishad:","And Govinda murmured verses to himself, verses from an Upanishad:","And Govinda murmured a verse under his breath, a verse from an Upanishad:"
"Früh am Morgen, noch ehe die Sonne sichtbar ward, kam Vasudeva aus dem Stalle und trat zu seinem Freunde.","Early in the morning, before the sun was visible, Vasudeva came out of the stable and went to his friend.","Early in the morning, before the sun was visible, Vasudeva came from the stable and went to his friend.","Early the next morning, even before the sun had shown itself, Vasudeva emerged from the lean-to and joined his friend."
"Nicht lange war er in Kamaswamis Hause, da nahm er schon an seines Hausherrn Handel teil. Täglich aber zu der Stunde, die sie ihm nannte, besuchte er die schöne Kamala, in hübschen Kleidern, in feinen Schuhen, und bald brachte er ihr auch Geschenke mit. Vieles lehrte ihn ihr roter, kluger Mund. Vieles lehrte ihn ihre zarte, geschmeidige Hand. Ihm, der in der Liebe noch ein Knabe war und dazu neigte, sich blindlings und unersättlich in die Lust zu stürzen wie ins Bodenlose, lehrte sie von Grund auf die Lehre, dass man Lust nicht nehmen kann, ohne Lust zu geben, und dass jede Gebärde, jedes Streicheln, jede Berührung, jeder Anblick, jede kleinste Stelle des Körpers ihr Geheimnis hat, das zu wecken dem Wissenden Glück bereitet. Sie lehrte ihn, dass Liebende nach einer Liebesfeier nicht voneinander gehen dürfen, ohne eins das andere zu bewundern, ohne ebenso besiegt zu sein, wie gesiegt zu haben, so dass bei keinem von beiden Übersättigung und Öde entstehe und das böse Gefühl, missbraucht zu haben oder missbraucht worden zu sein. Wunderbare Stunden brachte er bei der schönen und klugen Künstlerin zu, wurde ihr Schüler, ihr Liebhaber, ihr Freund. Hier bei Kamala lag der Wert und Sinn seines jetzigen Lebens, nicht im Handel des Kamaswami.","He was not long in Kamaswami's house before he took part in his master's trade. Every day, however, at the hour she called for him, he would visit the beautiful Kamala, in pretty clothes and fine shoes, and soon he would bring her presents as well. Her red, clever mouth taught him a lot. Her delicate, supple hand taught him a great deal. He, who was still a boy in love and tended to plunge blindly and insatiably into lust as if into the abyss, she taught the lesson from the ground up that one cannot take pleasure without giving pleasure, and that every Every gesture, every caress, every touch, every sight, every smallest part of the body has its secret, which brings happiness to the knower to awaken it. She taught him that after a love-celebration, lovers must not part without admiring one another, without being as defeated as they have been victorious, so that there is neither satiation and wasting, nor the evil feeling of having abused or to have been abused. He spent wonderful hours with the beautiful and clever artist, became her pupil, her lover, her friend. Here with Kamala was the value and meaning of his present life, not in the trade of the Kamaswami.","Not long after settling in Kamaswami’s home, Siddhartha was already taking part in his host’s transactions. But every day at the hour that she set, he visited beautiful Kamala: he wore lovely clothes, fine shoes, and soon he also brought her gifts. Her clever red lips taught him a lot. Her tender, supple hand taught him a lot. In regard to love, he was still a boy, and he tended to plunge into pleasure blindly, endlessly, insatiably. So she thoroughly taught him that one cannot take pleasure without giving pleasure, and that every gesture, every caress, every touch, every glance, every last bit of the body has its secret, which brings happiness to the person who knows how to wake it. She taught him that after a celebration of love the lovers should not part without admiring each other, without being conquered or having conquered, so that neither is bleak or glutted or has the bad feeling of having misused or been misused. He spent wonderful hours with the clever and beautiful artist, became her pupil, her lover, her friend. Here, with Kamala, lay the value and purpose of his current life, and not with Kamaswami’s business.","Not long after arriving in Kamaswami’s house, Siddhartha began to take part in his business dealings. Daily, however, at the hour chosen by her, he visited beautiful Kamala dressed in attractive clothes and fine shoes, and soon he was also bringing her presents. Her clever red mouth taught him many things. Her delicate, nimble hand taught him many things. He—who in matters of love was still a boy and tended to hurl himself blindly and insatiably into pleasure as into an abyss—was now being instructed methodically in this doctrine: that one cannot receive pleasure without giving pleasure; that every gesture, every caress, every touch, every glance, every inch of the body had its secret; and that awakening this secret brought happiness to the one who held this knowledge. She taught him that lovers may not part after celebrating their love until each has admired the other, each been as much victor as vanquished, so that neither might be beset by surfeit or tedium or an uneasy sense of having taken advantage or been taken advantage of. He passed glorious hours in the company of this beautiful, intelligent artist; he became her pupil, her lover, her friend. The value and meaning of the life he now was leading lay here with Kamala, not in the business dealings of Kamaswami."
"Und wieder ein anderes Mal, da Siddhartha mit Govinda den Wald verließ, um im Dorfe etwas Nahrung für ihre Brüder und Lehrer zu betteln, begann Siddhartha zu sprechen und sagte: »Wie nun, o Govinda, sind wir wohl auf dem rechten Wege? Nähern wir uns wohl der Erkenntnis? Nähern wir uns wohl der Erlösung? Oder gehen wir nicht vielleicht im Kreise – wir, die wir doch dem Kreislauf zu entrinnen dachten?«","And another time, when Siddhartha was leaving the forest with Govinda to beg for some food for her brothers and teachers in the village, Siddhartha began to speak and said: How now, o Govinda, are we on the right path? Are we approaching knowledge? Are we approaching salvation? Or are we perhaps going in circles – we who thought we were escaping the cycle?”","O Govinda, that I know.” Another time, when Siddhartha and Govinda left the forest and went to the village, begging food for their brothers and their teacher, Siddhartha again spoke: “Now tell me, Govinda, are we really on the right path? Are we really approaching knowledge? Are we really approaching redemption? Or are we not perhaps going in a circle—we who thought we were escaping the cycle?”","On yet another occasion, as Siddhartha was leaving the forest with Govinda to beg sustenance for their brothers and teachers in the village, he began to speak. “And now, Govinda, do you think we are on the right path? Are we drawing closer to knowledge? Are we drawing closer to redemption? Or are we not perhaps walking in circles—we who had hoped to escape the cycle?”"
"Wie ein Schleier, wie ein dünner Nebel senkte sich Müdigkeit über Siddhartha, langsam, jeden Tag ein wenig dichter, jeden Monat ein wenig trüber, jedes Jahr ein wenig schwerer. Wie ein neues Kleid mit der Zeit alt wird, mit der Zeit seine schöne Farbe verliert, Flecken bekommt, Falten bekommt, an den Säumen abgestoßen wird und hier und dort blöde, fädige Stellen zu zeigen beginnt, so war Siddharthas neues Leben, das er nach seiner Trennung von Govinda begonnen hatte, alt geworden, so verlor es mit den hinrinnenden Jahren Farbe und Glanz, so sammelten sich Falten und Flecken auf ihm, und im Grunde verborgen, hier und dort schon häßlich hervorblickend, wartete Enttäuschung und Ekel. Siddhartha merkte es nicht. Er merkte nur, das jene helle und sichere Stimme seines Innern, die einst in ihm erwacht war und ihn in seinen glänzenden Zeiten je und je geleitet hatte, schweigsam geworden war.","Tiredness descended over Siddhartha like a veil, like a thin mist, slowly, a little thicker every day, a little cloudier every month, a little heavier every year. Just like a new dress gets old over time, loses its beautiful color over time, gets stains, wrinkles, is shed at the hems and starts to show stupid, thready spots here and there, so was Siddhartha's new life that he was after had begun his separation from Govinda, it lost color and shine as the years passed, wrinkles and stains accumulated on it, and deep down hidden, ugly here and there, disappointment and disgust waited. Siddhartha didn't notice. He only noticed that that clear and sure voice within him, which had once awakened in him and had always guided him in his brilliant times, had become silent.","Like a veil, like a thin mist, weariness descended on Siddhartha, slowly, a bit denser each day, a bit dimmer each month, a bit heavier each year. A new garment grows old with time, loses its lovely color with time, gets stains, gets wrinkles, frays out at the hems, and starts showing awkward, threadbare areas. And Siddhartha’s new life, begun after his parting from Govinda, had likewise grown old; and so, with the fleeting years, his life lost color and luster, and so stains and wrinkles gathered on him, and, deeply concealed, peeping out here and there and already ugly, disgust and disillusion waited. Siddhartha did not notice. He noticed only that the clear and certain inner voice, which had awoken in him long ago and had always guided him in his luminous times, had now grown still.","Like a veil or a thin fog, weariness descended upon Siddhartha, slowly, a bit thicker each day, a bit hazier each month, a bit heavier each year. Just as a new garment gets old with time, loses its attractive colors, becomes stained, wrinkled, and worn at the seams, and here and there begins to display unfortunate threadbare patches, so too had the new life that Siddhartha began after parting from Govinda gotten old and with the passing of the years begun to lose its color and sheen; wrinkles and stains were collecting on it, and—hidden beneath the surface but already peeking out hideously now and again—disillusionment and nausea lay waiting. This Siddhartha did not notice. He noticed only that the bright and certain inner voice that once had awoken within him and accompanied him unceasingly in his days of glory had fallen silent."

"An diesem Tage erreichte er vor Abend eine große Stadt, und freute sich, denn er begehrte nach Menschen. Lange hatte er in den Wäldern gelebt, und die stroherne Hütte des Fährmanns, in welcher er diese Nacht geschlafen hatte, war seit langer Zeit das erste Dach, das er über sich gehabt hatte.","On that day before evening he reached a large city, and rejoiced, for he desired people. Long had he lived in the woods, and the ferryman's thatched hut in which he had slept that night was the first roof he had had over himself in a long time.","That day, he reached a large town before evening and was overjoyed, for he yearned for people.

"Siddhartha aber schwieg. Er dachte der Worte, welche Govinda zu ihm gesagt hatte, und dachte die Worte bis an ihr Ende.",But Siddhartha said nothing. He thought of the words that Govinda had said to him and thought the words to the end.,"But Siddhartha kept silent. He thought about the words that Govinda had spoken to him, and thought the words all the way through.","Siddhartha was silent. He was thinking of the words Govinda had spoken, thinking them through to their conclusion."
"Stolz flammte plötzlich in ihm auf. Er war kein Samana mehr, nicht mehr stand es ihm an, zu betteln. Er gab den Reiskuchen einem Hunde und blieb ohne Speise.","Pride suddenly flared up in him. He was no longer a samana, it was no longer his place to beg. He gave the rice cake to a dog and was left without food.","Suddenly pride blazed up in him. No longer was he a samana, no longer was it seemly for him to beg. He gave the rice cake to a dog and remained without nourishment.","Pride suddenly flared up within him.

"Indem er sich nahe vor dem Samana aufstellte, mit gesammelter Seele, fing er den Blick des Alten mit seinen Blicken ein, bannte ihn, machte ihn stumm, machte ihn willenlos, unterwarf ihn seinem Willen, befahl ihm, lautlos zu tun, was er von ihm verlangte. Der alte Mann wurde stumm, sein Auge wurde starr, sein Wille gelähmt, seine Arme hingen herab, machtlos war er Siddharthas Bezauberung erlegen. Siddharthas Gedanken aber bemächtigten sich des Samana, er musste vollführen, was sie befahlen. Und so verneigte sich der Alte mehrmals, vollzog segnende Gebärden, sprach stammelnd einen frommen Reisewunsch. Und die Jünglinge erwiderten dankend die Verneigungen, erwiderten den Wunsch, zogen grüßend von dannen.","Positioning himself close to the Samana, with a collected soul, he caught the old man's gaze with his eyes, banished him, made him dumb, made him weak of will, subjected him to his will, commanded him to silently do what he was told demanded of him. The old man became mute, his eyes became rigid, his will was paralyzed, his arms hung down, powerless he had succumbed to Siddhartha's enchantment. But Siddhartha's thoughts took possession of Samana, he had to carry out what they ordered. And so the old man bowed several times, gestured in blessing, stammered a pious wish for a journey. And the youths thankfully returned the bows, returned the wish, and went away with greetings.","Standing face-to-face with the samana, he caught the old man’s gaze with his own eyes and with all his soul, spellbound him, made him mute, made him will-less, subdued him to his will, ordered him to soundlessly do what he, Siddhartha, demanded. The old man went mute, his eyes glazed over, his will was paralyzed, his arms dangled: he was helpless, overpowered by Siddhartha’s enchantment. Siddhartha’s thoughts took possession of the samana; he had to do what they commanded. And so the old man bowed several times, made gestures of blessing, stammered a pious wish for a good journey. And the youths thanked him, requiting his bows, requiting his best wishes, making their farewells as they departed.","Stationing himself immediately before the Samana, his soul collected, he caught the eye of the old man with his own eyes and bewitched him, made him fall silent, made him lose his will, subjected him to his own will, commanded him to perform mutely what was asked of him. The old man fell silent: His eyes were locked in position, his will was paralyzed, his arms dangled down, he was powerless in the grasp of Siddhartha’s enchantment. Now Siddhartha’s thoughts took control of the thoughts of the Samana, forcing him to perform what they commanded. And so the old man bowed several times, made gestures of blessing, and, in a stammer, wished them safe travels. The youths responded to his bows with thanks, responded to his good wishes with wishes of their own, took their leave of him, and set off."
Siddhartha verneigte sich tief vor dem Abschiednehmenden.,Siddhartha bowed deeply to the farewell.,Siddhartha bowed low to the departing man.,Siddhartha bowed deeply before the one taking his leave.
"Auch Siddhartha fühlte Sehnsucht und den Quell des Geschlechts sich bewegen; da er aber noch nie ein Weib berührt hatte, zögerte er einen Augenblick, während seine Hände schon bereit waren, nach ihr zu greifen. Und in diesem Augenblick hörte er, erschauernd, die Stimme seines Innern, und die Stimme sagte Nein. Da wich vom lächelnden Gesicht der jungen Frau aller Zauber, er sah nichts mehr als den feuchten Blick eines brünstigen Tierweibchens. Freundlich streichelte er ihre Wange, wandte sich von ihr und verschwand vor der Enttäuschten leichtfüßig in das Bambusgehölze.","Siddhartha also felt longing and the source of sex moving; but since he had never touched a woman, he hesitated a moment while his hands were ready to take her. And at that moment, shuddering, he heard the voice within him, and the voice said no. Then all magic left the smiling face of the young woman, he saw nothing more than the wet gaze of a fervent female animal. He gently stroked her cheek, turned away from her and disappeared lightly into the bamboo grove in front of the disappointed woman.","Siddhartha likewise felt yearning and felt the source of sex moving, but since he had never touched a woman, he hesitated for an instant though his hands were ready to reach for her.

He amiably stroked her cheek, turned away from the disappointed woman, and nimbly vanished in the bamboo forest.","Siddhartha too was filled with longing and felt the source of his sex stir, but as he had never before touched a woman, he hesitated for a moment while his hands were already preparing to reach out for her.

At once the charm vanished from the smiling face of the young woman; all he saw now was the dewy gaze of a beast in heat. With a friendly gesture he stroked her cheek, turned away from her, and with a light step disappeared into the bamboo thicket, leaving the disappointed woman behind."
"Die Jahre gingen hin und keiner zählte sie. Da kamen einst Mönche gepilgert, Anhänger des Gotama, des Buddha, welche baten, sie über den Fluss zu setzen, und von ihnen erfuhren die Fährmänner, dass sie eiligst zu ihrem großen Lehrer zurück wanderten, denn es habe sich die Nachricht verbreitet, der Erhabene sei todkrank und werde bald seinen letzten Menschentod sterben, um zur Erlösung einzugehen. Nicht lange, so kam eine neue Schar Mönche gepilgert, und wieder eine, und sowohl die Mönche wie die meisten der übrigen Reisenden und Wanderer sprachen von nichts anderem als von Gotama und seinem nahen Tode. Und wie zu einem Kriegszug oder zur Krönung eines Königs von überall und allen Seiten her die Menschen strömen und sich gleich Ameisen in Scharen sammeln, so strömten sie, wie von einem Zauber gezogen, dahin, wo der große Buddha seinen Tod erwartete, wo das Ungeheure geschehen und der große Vollendete eines Weltalters zur Herrlichkeit eingehen sollte.","The years went by and nobody counted them. Once upon a time monks came on pilgrimage, followers of Gotama, the Buddha, who asked to be taken across the river, and from them the ferrymen learned that they were hurrying back to their great teacher, because the news had spread, the Exalted One is terminally ill and will soon die his last human death in order to enter salvation. It was not long before a new group of monks came on pilgrimage, and another one, and both the monks and most of the other travelers and wanderers spoke of nothing but Gotama and his approaching death. And just as people flock from everywhere and from all sides to a military expedition or to the coronation of a king and gather in droves like ants, so they flocked, as if drawn by magic, to where the great Buddha awaited his death, where the monstrous happen and the great perfected one of an age should come in to glory.","The years flowed away, and no one counted them.

Not long after, another group of monks came to the ferry on their pilgrimage, and then another, and not only the monks but most of the other travelers and wanderers as well spoke of nothing but Gautama and his impending death.

"Mit lächelndem Gesichte schaute Siddhartha dem hinweggehenden Mönche nach. Der Schlaf hatte ihn sehr gestärkt, sehr aber quälte ihn der Hunger, denn er hatte nun zwei Tage nichts gegessen, und lange war die Zeit vorüber, da er hart gegen den Hunger gewesen war. Mit Kummer, und doch auch mit Lachen, gedachte er jener Zeit. Damals, so erinnerte er sich, hatte er sich vor Kamala dreier Dinge gerühmt, hatte drei edle und unüberwindliche Künste gekonnt: Fasten – Warten – Denken. Dies war sein Besitz gewesen, seine Macht und Kraft, sein fester Stab, in den fleißigen, mühseligen Jahren seiner Jugend hatte er diese drei Künste gelernt, nichts anderes. Und nun hatten sie ihn verlassen, keine von ihnen war mehr sein, nicht Fasten, nicht Warten, nicht Denken. Um das Elendeste hatte er sie hingegeben, um das Vergänglichste, um SinnenIust, um Wohlleben, um Reichtum! Seltsam war es ihm in der Tat ergangen. Und jetzt, so schien es, jetzt war er wirklich ein Kindermensch geworden.","With a smiling face, Siddhartha watched the departing monk. Sleep had greatly strengthened him, but hunger tormented him greatly, for he had not eaten for two days, and the time was long gone when he had been hard against hunger. With sorrow, and yet also with laughter, he thought of that time. At that time, he recalled, he had boasted three things to Kamala, had mastered three noble and insurmountable arts: Fasting - Waiting - Thinking. This had been his possession, his might and strength, his steady staff, in the busy, toilsome years of his youth he had learned these three arts, nothing else. And now they had left him, none of them was his anymore, not fasting, not waiting, not thinking. He had given her up for what was most miserable, for what was most perishable, for sensual pleasure, for a good life, for riches! It had indeed been strange for him. And now, it seemed, he really had become a childish man.","With a smiling face, Siddhartha peered after the departing monk. Sleep had greatly strengthened him, but hunger now greatly tormented him, for he had not eaten in two days, and long past was the time when he had been hard toward hunger. With grief, and yet with laughter too, he thought back to that time. He recalled that he had boasted of three things to Kamala; he had been master of three noble and invincible arts: fasting—waiting—thinking. That had been his property, his might and strength, his solid staff. In the zealous, arduous years of his youth he had learned those three arts, and nothing else. And now they had abandoned him; none of them were his anymore: not fasting, not waiting, not thinking. He had given them away for the most wretched things, the most ephemeral things, for sensuality, for luxury, for wealth! His life had indeed been bizarre. And now, so it seemed, he had truly become a child person.","With a smiling face, Siddhartha gazed after the departing monk. His sleep had restored him, but he was still tormented by hunger, for he had eaten nothing for two days and the time when he had been impervious to hunger was now long past. With sorrow, yet also with laughter, he thought of this time. Back then, he recalled, he had boasted of three things before Kamala, the three noble and unassailable arts he had mastered: fasting—waiting—thinking. These had been his possessions, his power and strength, his sturdy staff; it was these three arts he had studied in the assiduous, laborious years of his youth, to the exclusion of all else. And now they had abandoned him; not one of them remained, not fasting, not waiting, not thinking. He had sacrificed them for the most miserable of things, the most transitory: for sensual pleasure, for luxury, for wealth! How strangely things had gone with him. And now, it appeared, he had truly become one of the child people."
"»Nun ja,« gab sie zu. »Aber wie stünde es mit dir ohne mich? Was wärest du, wenn Kamala dir nicht hülfe?«","""Well, yes,"" she admitted. 'But what about you without me? What would you be if Kamala didn't help you?”","“Fine,” she conceded. “But where would you be without me? What would become of you if Kamala were not helping you?”","“Well, yes,” she conceded, “but where would you be without me? What would you be if Kamala did not help you?”"
"»Du hast geschlafen,« antwortete Govinda. »Es ist nicht gut, an solchen Orten zu schlafen, wo häufig Schlangen sind und die Tiere des Waldes ihre Wege haben.

Darum suchte ich dich zu wecken, o Herr, und da ich sah, dass dein Schlaf sehr tief war, blieb ich hinter den Meinigen zurück und saß bei dir. Und dann, so scheint es, bin ich selbst eingeschlafen, der ich deinen Schlaf bewachen wollte. Schlecht habe ich meinen Dienst versehen, Müdigkeit hat mich übermannt. Aber nun, da du ja wach bist, lass mich gehen, damit ich meine Brüder einhole.«","""You were asleep,"" answered Govinda. 'It is not good to sleep in places where snakes are common and the beasts of the forest have their ways. I, oh Lord, am a disciple of the sublime Gotama, the Buddha, the Sakyamuni, and having been on this pilgrimage with a number of our own, I saw you lying and sleeping in a place where it is dangerous to sleep. So I tried to wake you up, O Lord, and seeing that your sleep was very deep, I stayed behind my family and sat with you. And then, it seems, I fell asleep myself, wanting to guard your sleep. I did my duty badly, tiredness overcame me. But now that you're awake, let me go to catch up with my brothers.""","“You were sleeping,” replied Govinda. “It is not good to sleep in such places, where there are many serpents and the forest animals have their trails. I, sir, am a disciple of the sublime Gautama, the Buddha, the Sakyamuni, and a number of us were pilgriming here: I saw you lying and sleeping in this place, where it is dangerous to sleep. I therefore tried to waken you, sir, and since I saw that your sleep was very deep, I remained behind my brethren and sat with you. And then, so it seems, I fell asleep myself, I, who wanted to watch over your sleep. I did my duty poorly, weariness overwhelmed me. But now that you are awake, let me go, so that I may catch up with my brethren.”","“You were asleep,” Govinda replied. “It is not good to sleep in such places where there are often snakes and the creatures of the forest have their paths. I, master, am a disciple of the sublime Gautama, the Buddha, the Sakyamuni, and was on a pilgrimage along this path with others of our order when I saw you lying asleep in a place where it is dangerous to sleep. For this reason I attempted to rouse you, master, and when I saw that your sleep was very sound, I remained behind to sit with you. And then, it appears, I myself fell asleep—I who had intended to watch over you. I have performed my duties poorly; weariness overcame me. But now that you are awake, let me go, that I might catch up with my brothers.”"
"Noch bin ich ein Samana, dachte er, noch immer, ein Asket und Bettler. Nicht so werde ich bleiben dürfen, nicht so in den Hain treten. Und er lachte.","I'm still a Samana, he thought, still an ascetic and a beggar. I won't be allowed to stay like this, I won't be allowed to step into the grove like this.

"»Halt,« unterbrach ihn Kamala. »Du kannst lesen? Und schreiben?«","""Stop,"" Kamala interrupted. ""You can read? And write?""","“Stop,” Kamala broke in. “You can read? And write?”",“Stop.” Kamala interrupted him. “You can read and write?”
"Kamala besaß in einem goldenen Käfig einen kleinen seltenen Singvogel. Von diesem Vogel träumte er. Er träumte: dieser Vogel war stumm geworden, der sonst stets in der Morgenstunde sang, und da dies ihm auffiel, trat er vor den Käfig und blickte hinein, da war der kleine Vogel tot und lag steif am Boden. Er nahm ihn heraus, wog ihn einen Augenblick in der Hand und warf ihn dann weg, auf die Gasse hinaus, und im gleichen Augenblick erschrak er furchtbar, und das Herz tat ihm weh, so, als habe er mit diesem toten Vogel allen Wert und alles Gute von sich geworfen.","Kamala owned a small rare songbird in a golden cage.

He took it out, weighed it in his hand for a moment and then threw it out into the street, and at the same moment he was terribly frightened and his heart ached, as if he had every value and worth with this dead bird everything good thrown away.","Kamala kept a small, rare songbird in a gold cage. He dreamed about this bird. He dreamed that this bird, which normally sang in the morning, had grown mute, and noticing this, he went over to the cage and peered inside. The little bird was dead, lying stiff on the bottom. He took it out, weighed it in his hand for a moment and then threw it away, out into the street—and at that same moment, he was terribly frightened, and his heart ached as if, with this dead bird, he had thrown away all value and all goodness.","Kamala kept a rare little songbird in a golden cage; he dreamed about this bird. He dreamed the bird, which always used to sing at dawn, had fallen silent, and since the silence struck him, he went over to the cage and looked inside; the little bird lay dead and still on the bottom. He took it out, weighed it for a moment in his hand, and then tossed it aside, into the street, and at the same moment he was seized with fear and horror and his heart hurt, as if with this dead bird he had thrust aside everything that had worth and value."
"»Jetzt erkenne ich dich,« sagte er endlich. »Einst hast du in meiner Hütte geschlafen, lange ist es her, wohl mehr als zwanzig Jahre mag das her sein, und bist von mir über den Fluss gebracht worden, und wir nahmen Abschied voneinander wie gute Freunde. Warst du nicht ein Samana? Deines Namens kann ich mich nicht mehr entsinnen.«","""Now I recognize you,"" he said at last. “Once you slept in my hut, a long time ago, it must have been more than twenty years ago, and you were brought across the river by me, and we said goodbye to each other like good friends. Weren't you a Samana? I can't remember your name.""","“Now I recognize you,” he finally said. “You once slept in my hut. That was long ago. It must have been more than twenty years ago, and I ferried you across the river, and we said good-bye as good friends. Were you not a samana? I no longer remember your name.”","“Now I recognize you,” he said at last. “You spent the night in my hut once, a long time ago, surely it’s been more than twenty years, and then I ferried you across the river and we parted from each other like good friends. Were you not a Samana? I can no longer recall your name.”"
"»Wohl, Lieber, gut hast du beobachtet, alles sieht dein scharfes Auge. Doch habe ich nicht zu dir gesagt, dass ich ein Samana sei. Ich sagte: ich pilgere. Und so ist es: ich pilgere.«","“Well, dear, you have observed well, your sharp eye sees everything. But I have not said to you that I am a samana. I said: I'm going on a pilgrimage. And so it is: I make a pilgrimage.«","“True, dear friend, you have observed well, your sharp eye sees everything. But I did not say that I am a samana. I said: I am pilgriming. And that is the way it is: I am pilgriming.”","“Indeed, dear friend, you have observed all this well; your keen eye misses nothing. But I did not say to you that I was a Samana. I said I am on a pilgrimage—and, indeed, I am a pilgrim.”"
"»Du hast ihn lachen hören,« sagte er. »Aber du hast nicht alles gehört. Lass uns lauschen, du wirst mehr hören.«","""You heard him laugh,"" he said. 'But you didn't hear everything. Let's listen, you'll hear more.«","“You heard it laugh,” said Vasudeva. “But you have not heard everything. Let us listen, you will hear more.”","“You have heard the river laugh,” he said, “but you have not heard everything. Let us listen; you will hear more.”"

"Als der Tag begann, bat Siddhartha seinen Gastgeber, den Fährmann, ihn über den Fluss zu setzen. Der Fährmann setzte ihn auf seinem Bambusfloss über den Fluss, rötlich schimmerte im Morgenschein das breite Wasser.","As the day began, Siddhartha asked his host, the ferryman, to take him across the river.

"Und eines Tages, als die Wunde heftig brannte, fuhr Siddhartha über den Fluss, gejagt von Sehnsucht, stieg aus und war Willens, nach der Stadt zu gehen und seinen Sohn zu suchen. Der Fluss floss sanft und leise, es war in der trockenen Jahreszeit, aber seine Stimme klang sonderbar: sie lachte! Sie lachte deutlich. Der Fluss lachte, er lachte hell und klar den alten Fährmann aus. Siddhartha blieb stehen, er beugte sich übers Wasser, um noch besser zu hören, und im still ziehenden Wasser sah er sein Gesicht gespiegelt, und in diesem gespiegelten Gesicht war etwas, das ihn erinnerte, etwas Vergessenes, und da er sich besann, fand er es: dies Gesicht glich einem andern, das er einst gekannt und geliebt und auch gefürchtet hatte. Es glich dem Gesicht seines Vaters, des Brahmanen. Und er erinnerte sich, wie er vor Zeiten, ein Jüngling, seinen Vater gezwungen hatte, ihn zu den Büßern gehen zu lassen, wie er Abschied von ihm genommen hatte, wie er gegangen und nie mehr wiedergekommen war. Hatte nicht auch sein Vater um ihn dasselbe Leid gelitten, wie er es nun um seinen Sohn litt? War nicht sein Vater längst gestorben, allein, ohne seinen Sohn wiedergesehen zu haben? Musste er selbst nicht dies selbe Schicksal erwarten? War es nicht eine Komödie, eine seltsame und dumme Sache, diese Wiederholung, dieses Laufen in einem verhängnisvollen Kreise?","And one day, when the wound was burning violently, Siddhartha drove across the river, driven by longing, got out and was willing to go to town and look for his son. The river flowed softly and quietly, it was the dry season, but his voice sounded strange: she was laughing! She laughed distinctly. The river laughed, it laughed loud and clear at the old ferryman. Siddhartha stopped, he bent over the water to hear even better, and he saw his face reflected in the still moving water, and in this reflected face there was something that reminded him, something forgotten, and when he thought about it, he found it it: this face resembled another that he had once known and loved and also feared. It resembled the face of his father the Brahmin. And he remembered how long ago, as a young man, he had forced his father to let him go to the penitents, how he had taken leave of him, how he had gone and never come back. Hadn't his father suffered the same suffering for him as he now suffered for his son? Hadn't his father died long ago, alone, without having seen his son again? Didn't he have to expect the same fate himself? Wasn't it a comedy, a strange and silly thing, this repetition, this running in a fatal circle?","And one day, when the wound was burning fiercely, Siddhartha, driven by longing, ferried across the river, disembarked, and wanted to go to town and seek his son. The river flowed softly and gently, it was the dry season of the year, but the river’s voice sounded strange. It was laughing! It was clearly laughing. The river was laughing, it laughed, clear and bright, at the old ferryman. Siddhartha halted, he leaned over the water the better to hear, and in the silently flowing water he saw his own face reflected, and in this reflected face there was something that reminded him, something forgotten, and by pondering it, he found it. This face resembled another face, that he had once known and loved and also feared. It resembled the face of his father, the Brahmin. And he remembered that ages ago, he, a youth, had forced his father to let him join the penitents, he remembered saying good-bye to him, going away, and never returning. Had not his father suffered the same sorrow that Siddhartha was now suffering for his own son? Had his father not died long since, alone, without seeing his son again? Would Siddhartha not have to suffer the same fate? Was it not a comedy, a strange and stupid thing, this repetition, this running in a fateful circle?","One day when the wound was violently burning, Siddhartha crossed the river, driven by longing, got out of the boat, and was of a mind to go to the city again and look for his son. The river was flowing gently and softly; it was the dry season, but its voice sounded odd; it was laughing! It was distinctly laughing. The river was laughing, brightly and clearly laughing at the old ferryman. Siddhartha stopped. He leaned over the water to hear better and saw his face reflected in the calm streaming water, and in this mirrored face there was something that stirred his memory, something forgotten, and when he considered further, he realized what it was: This face resembled another face he had once known and loved and also feared. It resembled the face of his father, the Brahmin. And he remembered how, a very long time ago, he, a mere youth, had forced his father to let him go to join the penitents, how he had taken leave of him, and then he had gone and had never again returned. Had not his father suffered the same pain he himself was now suffering on account of his son? Had not his father died long ago, without ever having seen his son again? Must not he himself expect the same fate? Was not this repetition a comedy, a strange and foolish thing, this constant circulation in a preordained course?"
"»Nirgendshin gehe ich. Immer sind wir Mönche unterwegs, solange nicht Regenzeit ist, immer ziehen wir von Ort zu Ort, leben nach der Regel, verkündigen die Lehre, nehmen Almosen, ziehen weiter.

"Ein Ziel stand vor Siddhartha, ein einziges: leer werden, leer von Durst, leer von Wunsch, leer von Traum, leer von Freude und Leid. Von sich selbst wegsterben, nicht mehr Ich sein, entleerten Herzens Ruhe zu finden, im entselbsteten Denken dem Wunder offen zu stehen, das war sein Ziel. Wenn alles Ich überwunden und gestorben war, wenn jede Sucht und jeder Trieb im Herzen schwieg, dann musste das Letzte erwachen, das Innerste im Wesen, das nicht mehr Ich ist, das große Geheimnis.","One goal stood before Siddhartha, a single one: to become empty, empty of thirst, empty of desire, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow. To die away from himself, to no longer be myself, to find peace with an empty heart, to be open to miracles in selfless thinking, that was his goal. When everything I had overcome and died, when every addiction and every impulse fell silent in the heart, then the ultimate had to awaken, the innermost part of the being that is no longer me, the great secret.","Siddhartha had a goal, a single one: to become empty— empty of thirst, empty of desire, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow. To die away from himself, no longer be self, to find peace with an emptied heart, to be open to miracles in unselfed thinking: that was his goal. When the entire self was transcended and extinct, when every drive and every mania in the heart had fallen silent, then the ultimate was bound to awaken, the innermost essence, which is no longer ego, the great secret.","Before him, Siddhartha saw a single goal: to become empty, empty of thirst, empty of want, empty of dream, empty of joy and sorrow. To let the ego perish, to be “I” no longer, to find peace with an empty heart and await the miraculous with thoughts free of Self. This was his goal. When all ego had been overcome, had perished, when every longing and every drive in his heart had fallen silent, only then could the Utmost awaken, the great secret, that innermost core of being that is no longer Self."

"Entzückt lauschte Govinda und wollte noch vieles fragen und hören. Aber Siddhartha mahnte zum Weitergehen. Sie sagten Dank und gingen und brauchten kaum nach dem Wege zu fragen, denn nicht wenige Pilger und auch Mönche aus Gotamas Gemeinschaft waren nach dem Jetavana unterwegs. Und da sie in der Nacht dort anlangten, war daselbst ein beständiges Ankommen, Rufen und Reden von solchen, welche Herberge heischten und bekamen. Die beiden Samanas, des Lebens im Walde gewohnt, fanden schnell und geräuschlos einen Unterschlupf und ruhten da bis zum Morgen.","Delighted, Govinda listened and wanted to ask and hear a lot more. But Siddhartha warned to go on. They gave thanks and left, scarcely needing to ask directions, for quite a few pilgrims and monks from Gotama's community were on their way to Jetavana.

The two Samanas, accustomed to life in the forest, quickly and quietly found shelter and rested there until morning.","Govinda listened ecstatically and wanted to ask and hear a lot more. But Siddhartha said they would have to go on. They thanked the woman and left, and they scarcely needed to ask the way, for not a few pilgrims and monks in Gautama’s fellowship were heading toward the Jetavana. And when they reached it at night, there were constant arrivals, there were words and calls from people requesting and receiving shelter. The two samanas, accustomed to living in the forest, quickly and soundlessly found a refuge and rested there until morning.","Govinda listened, rapt, and wanted to ask and hear much more. But Siddhartha announced it was time they were on their way.

"An diesem Fluss will ich bleiben, dachte Siddhartha, es ist der selbe, über den ich einstmals auf dem Wege zu den Kindermenschen gekommen bin, ein freundlicher Fährmann hat mich damals geführt, zu ihm will ich gehen, von seiner Hütte aus führte mich einst mein Wegin ein neues Leben, das nun alt geworden und tot ist – möge auch mein jetziger Weg, mein jetziges neues Leben dort seinen Ausgang nehmen!","I want to stay on this river, thought Siddhartha, it's the same one that I used to come by on the way to the children's people, a friendly ferryman took me back then, I want to go to him, mine once led me from his hut Away into a new life that is now old and dead - may my present path, my present new life, also start there!","I want to remain by this river, thought Siddhartha, it is the same one that I crossed while going to the child people.

Let the path and the life I am embarking on now have their start here as well!"
"Glaubst du denn, Lieber, dieser Weg bleibe irgend jemandem vielleicht erspart? Vielleicht deinem Söhnchen, weil du es liebst, weil du ihm gern Leid und Schmerz und Enttäuschung ersparen möchtest?

"Auch damit schloss er ab, auch das starb in ihm. Er erhob sich, nahm Abschied vom Mangobaum, Abschied vom Lustgarten. Da er den Tag ohne Speise geblieben war, fühlte er heftigen Hunger, und gedachte an sein Haus in der Stadt, an sein Gemach und Bett, an den Tisch mit den Speisen. Er lächelte müde, schüttelte sich und nahm Abschied von diesen Dingen.","He ended that too, that too died in him. He got up, said goodbye to the mango tree, goodbye to the pleasure garden.

He smiled tiredly, shook himself and said goodbye to these things.","He was done with them too, they died in him too. He rose, said farewell to the mango tree, farewell to the pleasure garden. Since he had not eaten all day, he felt vehement hunger and he recalled his house in town, his chamber and his bed, the table with food.

With a weary smile, he shook himself and took leave of these things."
"Siddhartha fuhr fort: »Ein Gedanke, es mag so sein. Ich muss dir gestehen, Lieber: ich unterscheide zwischen Gedanken und Worten nicht sehr. Offen gesagt, halte ich auch von Gedanken nicht viel. Ich halte von Dingen mehr. Hier auf diesem Fährboot zum Beispiel war ein Mann mein Vorgänger und Lehrer, ein heiliger Mann, der hat manche Jahre lang einfach an den Fluss geglaubt, sonst an nichts. Er hatte gemerkt, dass des Flusses Stimme zu ihm sprach, von ihr lernte er, sie erzog und lehrte ihn, der Fluss schien ihm ein Gott, viele Jahre lang wusste er nicht, dass jeder Wind, jede Wolke, jeder Vogel, jeder Käfer genau so göttlich ist und ebensoviel weiß und lehren kann wie der verehrte Fluss. Als dieser Heilige aber in die Wälder ging, da wusste er alles, wusste mehr als du und ich, ohne Lehrer, ohne Bücher, nur weil er an den Fluss geglaubt hatte.«","Siddhartha continued: »One thought, it may be so. I must confess to you, dear: I don't distinguish very much between thoughts and words. Frankly, I don't think much of thoughts either. I think more of things. Here on this ferry boat, for example, a man was my predecessor and teacher, a holy man, who for many years simply believed in the river and nothing else. He had noticed that the voice of the river spoke to him, he learned from it, it educated and taught him, the river seemed to him a god, for many years he didn't know that every wind, every cloud, every bird, every beetle exactly is as divine and knows and can teach as much as the revered river. But when that saint went into the woods, he knew everything, knew more than you and I, with no teachers, no books, just because he believed in the river.”","Siddhartha went on: “A thought—that may be. I must confess to you, dear friend: I barely distinguish between thoughts and words. Frankly, I have little esteem for thoughts. I have more esteem for things. Here on this ferry, for example, there was a man, my forerunner and teacher, a saintly man; for years he simply believed in the river, and in nothing else. He noticed that the river’s voice spoke to him; he learned from its voice, it raised him and taught him. The river seemed like a god to him. For many years he did not know that every wind, every cloud, every bird, every bug is just as godly and knows and can teach just as much as the venerated river. But when this saint went into the forest, he knew everything, knew more than you and I, without teachers, without books, only because he believed in the river.”","Siddhartha continued. “A thought—this may be true. I have to confess to you, my dear friend , I do not see much difference between thoughts and words. To speak plainly, I do not have such a high regard for thoughts, either. I have a much higher regard for things. Here on this ferryboat, for example, my predecessor and teacher was a man, a holy man, who for many years believed only in the river, nothing else. He noticed that the river’s voice was speaking to him, and from this voice he learned; it taught and educated him.

"Sprach Siddhartha: »Eines, o Ehrwürdigster, habe ich an deiner Lehre vor allem bewundert. Alles in deiner Lehre ist vollkommen klar, ist bewiesen; als eine vollkommene, als eine nie und nirgends unterbrochene Kette zeigst du die Welt als eine ewige Kette, gefügt aus Ursachen und Wirkungen. Niemals ist dies so klar gesehen, nie so unwiderleglich dargestellt worden; höher wahrlich muss jedem Brahmanen das Herz im Leibe schlagen, wenn er, durch deine Lehre hindurch, die Welt erblickt als vollkommenen Zusammenhang, lückenlos, klar wie ein Kristall, nicht vom Zufall abhängig, nicht von Göttern abhängig. Ob sie gut oder böse, ob das Leben in ihr Leid oder Freude sei, möge dahingestellt bleiben, es mag vielleicht sein, dass dies nicht wesentlich ist – aber die Einheit der Welt, der Zusammenhang alles Geschehens, das Umschlossensein alles Großen und Kleinen vom selben Strome, vom selben Gesetz der Ursachen, des Werdens und des Sterbens, dies leuchtet hell aus deiner erhabenen Lehre, o Vollendeter. Nun aber ist, deiner selben Lehre nach, diese Einheit und Folgerichtigkeit aller Dinge dennoch an einer Stelle unterbrochen, durch eine kleine Lücke strömt in diese Welt der Einheit etwas Fremdes, etwas Neues, etwas, das vorher nicht war, und das nicht gezeigt und nicht bewiesen werden kann: das ist deine Lehre von der Überwindung der Welt, von der Erlösung. Mit dieser kleinen Lücke, mit dieser kleinen Durchbrechung aber ist das ganze ewige und einheitliche Weltgesetz wieder zerbrochen und aufgehoben. Mögest du mir verzeihen, wenn ich diesen Einwand ausspreche.«","Siddhartha spoke: »One thing, oh most venerable one, I admired above all about your teaching. Everything in your teaching is perfectly clear, is proved; as a perfect chain, never broken anywhere, you show the world as an eternal chain made up of causes and effects. Never has this been so clearly seen, never so irrefutably presented; the heart of every Brahmin must be beating higher when, through your teaching, he sees the world as a perfect connection, gapless, clear as a crystal, not dependent on chance, not dependent on gods. Whether it is good or bad, whether life in it is suffering or joy, may remain undecided, it may perhaps be that this is not essential - but the unity of the world, the connection of all events, the enclosing of everything large and small by the same Strome, from the same law of causes, of becoming and of dying, this shines brightly from your sublime teaching, o perfect one. But now, according to your same teaching, this unity and consistency of all things is interrupted at one point, through a small gap something strange, something new, streams into this world of unity, something that was not there before and that was not shown and not can be proven: that is your teaching about overcoming the world, about redemption. With this small gap, with this small breach, however, the whole eternal and uniform world law is broken up again and abolished. May you forgive me for raising this objection.”","Siddhartha said: “There is one thing in your Teaching, O Most Venerable One, that I admire more than anything else. Everything in your Teaching is perfectly clear, is proven. You show the world as a perfect chain, nowhere and never interrupted, as an eternal chain, linking causes and effects. Never has this been seen so clearly, never presented so irrefutably. Truly, the heart of every Brahmin must leap with joy in his body when he, through your Teaching, sees the world as a perfect and coherent whole, unbroken, clear as crystal, independent of chance, independent of gods. Whether the world is good or evil, whether life in it is sorrow or joy, no matter—it may even be unessential. But the unity of the world, the coherent togetherness of all events, the enfolding of everything, big or little, in the same river, in the same law of cause and effect, of becoming and dying: all this shines brightly from your sublime Teaching, O Perfect One. Yet now, according to that selfsame law, this unity and consistency of all things is nevertheless interrupted in one place: something alien, something new is pouring through a small gap into this world of unity, something that was not here before, something that cannot be shown and proved. That gap is your Teaching about the overcoming of the world, about deliverance. And that small gap, that small break shatters and abolishes the whole eternal and unified law of the world. Please forgive me for expressing my objection.”","Said Siddhartha, “There is one thing in particular, O Most Venerable One, that I have admired in your teachings. Everything in your doctrine is utterly clear, is proven; you show the world as a perfect chain, a chain never and nowhere interrupted, an eternal chain forged of causes and effects. Never has this been so clearly beheld, never so irrefutably presented. In truth, it must make the heart of any Brahmin beat faster when, through your teachings, he is able to glimpse the world as a perfect continuum, free of gaps, clear as a crystal, not dependent on chance, not dependent on gods. Whether this world be good or evil, and life in it sorrow or joy—let us set this question aside, for it is quite possibly not essential. But the oneness of the world, the continuum of all occurrences, the enfolding of all things great and small within a single stream, a single law of causes, of becoming and of death, this shines brightly forth from your sublime doctrine, O Perfect One. But now, according to your very same doctrine, this oneness and logical consistency of all things is nevertheless interrupted at one point; there is a tiny hole through which something strange is flowing into this world of oneness, something new, something that wasn’t there before and that cannot be shown and cannot be proven: This is your doctrine of the overcoming of the world, of redemption. With this tiny hole, this tiny gap, the entire eternal unified law of the world is smashed to pieces, rendered invalid. May you forgive me for giving voice to this objection.”"

"Regungslos blieb Siddhartha stehen, und einen Augenblick und Atemzug lang fror sein Herz, er fühlte es in der Brust innen frieren wie ein kleines Tier, einen Vogel oder einen Hasen, als er sah, wie allein er sei. Jahrelang war er heimatlos gewesen und hatte es nicht gefühlt. Nun fühlte er es. Immer noch, auch in der fernsten Versenkung, war er seines Vaters Sohn gewesen, war Brahmane gewesen, hohen Standes, ein Geistiger. Jetzt war er nur noch Siddhartha, der Erwachte, sonst nichts mehr. Tief sog er den Atem ein, und einen Augenblick fror er und schauderte. Niemand war so allein wie er. Kein Adliger, der nicht zu den Adligen, kein Handwerker, der nicht zu den Handwerkern gehörte und Zuflucht bei ihnen fand, ihr Leben teilte, ihre Sprache sprach. Kein Brahmane, der nicht zu den Brahmanen zählte und mit ihnen lebte, kein Asket, der nicht im Stande der Samanas seine Zuflucht fand, und auch der verlorenste Einsiedler im Walde war nicht einer und allein, auch ihn umgab Zugehörigkeit, auch er gehörte einem Stande an, der ihm Heimat war. Govinda war Mönch geworden, und tausend Mönche waren seine Brüder, trugen sein Kleid, glaubten seinen Glauben, sprachen seine Sprache. Er aber, Siddhartha, wo war er zugehörig? Wessen Leben würde er teilen? Wessen Sprache würde er sprechen?","Siddhartha stood motionless and for a moment and a breath his heart froze, he felt it freeze inside his chest like a small animal, a bird or a rabbit when he saw how alone he was. For years he had been homeless and had not felt it. Now he felt it. Still, even in the most distant contemplation, he had been his father's son, had been a Brahman, of high rank, a spiritual being. Now he was just Siddhartha, the awakened one, nothing else. He drew in a deep breath, and for a moment he froze and shivered. Nobody was as alone as he was. No nobleman who did not belong to the nobles, no craftsman who did not belong to the craftsmen and found refuge with them, shared their life, spoke their language. There was no Brahman who did not belong to the Brahmins and lived with them, no ascetic who did not find his refuge in the class of the Samanas, and even the most lost hermit in the forest was not one and alone, he too was surrounded by belonging, he too belonged to a class to which was his home. Govinda had become a monk and a thousand monks were his brothers, wore his dress, believed his faith, spoke his language. But he, Siddhartha, where did he belong? Whose life would he share? Whose language would he speak?","Siddhartha stood motionless, and for a moment and for an instant of breathing, his heart froze—he felt it freezing in his chest like a small animal, a bird or a hare, when he saw how alone he was. For years he had been homeless and had not felt it. But now he felt it. Always, even in the most faraway meditation, he had been his father’s son, had been a Brahmin, high-ranking, spiritual.

No Brahmin who was not counted among the Brahmins and lived with them, no ascetic who did not find refuge with the samanas. And even the most forlorn hermit in the forest was not all alone: he too was surrounded by ties and bonds, he too belonged to a class that was his home. Govinda had become a monk, and a thousand monks were his brothers, wore his garment, believed his belief, spoke his tongue. But he, Siddhartha—where did he belong? Whose life would he share? Whose tongue would he speak?","Motionless, Siddhartha remained standing there, and for a moment, for the space of a single breath, his heart was freezing cold; he could feel it freezing in his breast like a small animal, a bird or a rabbit, when he saw how alone he was. For years he had been without a home and had not felt it. Now he felt it. Always, even in the most distant depths of samadhi, he had been his father’s son, a Brahmin, a person of high birth, a thinker. Now he was no longer anything but Siddhartha; he was the one who had awoken and nothing more. He drew in a deep breath and for a moment he shivered, freezing. No one was as alone as he was. Every nobleman had his place among noblemen, every craftsman had his place among craftsmen and found refuge with them, sharing their life and speaking in their tongue. Every Brahmin belonged among Brahmins and lived with them. Every ascetic could find refuge among the Samanas. Even the most obscure hermit in the forest was not utterly alone; he too was enfolded in belonging, he too belonged to a class that was his home. Govinda had become a monk, and a thousand monks were his brothers, wore his habit, believed his beliefs, spoke his tongue. But he, Siddhartha: Where did he belong? Whose life would he share? Whose tongue would he speak?"
"Und von Mal zu Mal ward sein Lächeln dem des Fährmanns ähnlicher, ward beinahe ebenso strahlend, beinahe ebenso von Glück durchglänzt, ebenso aus tausend kleinen Falten leuchtend, ebenso kindlich, ebenso greisenhaft. Viele Reisende, wenn sie die beiden Fährmänner sahen, hielten sie für Brüder. Oft saßen sie am Abend gemeinsam beim Ufer auf dem Baumstamm, schwiegen und hörten beide dem Wasser zu, welches für sie kein Wasser war, sondern die Stimme des Lebens, die Stimme des Seienden, des ewig Werdenden. Und es geschah zuweilen, dass beide beim Anhören des Flusses an dieselben Dinge dachten, an ein Gespräch von vorgestern, an einen ihrer Reisenden, dessen Gesicht und Schicksal sie beschäftigte, an den Tod, an ihre Kindheit, und dass sie beide im selben Augenblick, wenn der Fluss ihnen etwas Gutes gesagt hatte, einander anblickten, beide genau dasselbe denkend, beide beglückt über dieselbe Antwort auf dieselbe Frage.","And from time to time his smile became more like that of the ferryman, became almost as radiant, almost as radiant with happiness, just as radiant with a thousand small wrinkles, just as childlike, just as senile.

In the evening they often sat together on the tree trunk by the bank, were silent and both listened to the water, which for them was not water, but the voice of life, the voice of being, of eternal becoming. And it sometimes happened that while listening to the river both thought of the same things, of a conversation from the day before yesterday, of one of their travelers, whose face and fate occupied them, of death, of their childhood, and that they both at the same moment, when the river had said something good to them, looked at each other, both thinking exactly the same thing, both happy with the same answer to the same question.","And little by little, his smile grew more similar to the ferryman’s, became almost as radiant, almost as blissful, likewise shining from a thousand tiny creases, likewise a youngster’s, likewise an oldster’s.

Often they sat together in the evenings beside the riverbank on the tree trunk, sat in silence, both listening to the water, which for them was not water but rather the voice of Life, the voice of Being, of the eternally Becoming.

"»Es ist sehr gut, Herr. Wenn ein Mensch nichts zu essen hat, so ist Fasten das Allerklügste, was er tun kann. Wenn, zum Beispiel, Siddhartha nicht fasten gelernt hätte, so müsste er heute noch irgendeinen Dienst annehmen, sei es bei dir oder wo immer, denn der Hunger würde ihn dazu zwingen.

Dazu, Herr, ist Fasten gut.«","'It is very good, sir. When a man has nothing to eat, fasting is the smartest thing he can do.

But now Siddhartha can calmly wait, he knows no impatience, he knows no plight. He can stave off hunger for a long time and he can laugh at it. That, sir, is what fasting is good for.”","“It is most excellent, sir. If a person has nothing to eat, then fasting is the most sensible thing he can do. If, for example, Siddhartha had not learned to fast, he would be compelled to take up some service or other straightaway, be it with you or wherever else, for his hunger would force him to do so. But Siddhartha can wait calmly. He knows no impatience, no urgent hardship; hunger can besiege him for a long time and just make him laugh. This, sir, is the usefulness of fasting.”"
"Als er im ersten Tageslicht langsam auf erstarrten Beinen die noch stille Stadt verließ, erhob sich bei der letzten Hütte ein Schatten, der dort gekauert war, und schloss sich an den Pilgernden an – Govinda.","As he slowly left the still silent city on stiff legs at first light, a shadow that was crouched there arose by the last hut and joined the pilgrims - Govinda.","When, in the first light of day, walking slowly on numb legs, he left the still-silent town, a shadow crouching by the last hut stood up and joined the pilgrim: it was Govinda.","In the first light of dawn, as he was slowly leaving the town on his stiff legs, a shadow rose up beside the last hut, a shadow that had been crouching there and now joined the pilgrim: Govinda."

Nein, denn die gehören ihm zu eigen und er gibt davon nur, was er geben will und wem er geben will. So ist es, genau ebenso ist es auch mit Kamala, und mit den Freuden der Liebe. Schön und rot ist Kamalas Mund, aber versuche, ihn gegen Kamalas Willen zu küssen, und nicht einen Tropfen Süßigkeit wirst du von ihm haben, der so viel Süßes zu geben versteht! Du bist gelehrig, Siddhartha, so lerne auch dies: Liebe kann man erbetteln, erkaufen, geschenkt bekommen, auf der Gasse finden, aber rauben kann man sie nicht. Da hast du dir einen falschen Weg ausgedacht. Nein, schade wäre es, wenn ein hübscher Jüngling wie du es so falsch angreifen wollte.«","“No, Samana, I'm afraid not. Has ever a Samana or a Brahman feared that some might come and seize him and rob him of his learning, and his piety, and his profundity? No, because they belong to him and he only gives what he wants to give and to whom he wants to give. That's how it is, that's exactly how it is with Kamala, and with the joys of love. Beautiful and red is Kamala's mouth, but try to kiss it against Kamala's will, and you won't get a drop of candy from him, who knows how to give so many sweets! You are docile, Siddhartha, so learn this too: Love can be begged, bought, given as a gift, found in the street, but you cannot steal it. You went the wrong way there. No, it would be a pity if a handsome young man like you attacked it so wrongly.""","“No, samana, I do not fear that. Has any samana or any Brahmin ever feared that someone might come and grab him and rob him of his learning and his piety and his profundity? No, for they are his own, and he gives of them only what he wishes to give and to whom he wishes to give. It is the same, exactly the same, with Kamala, and with the joys of love. Red and beautiful are Kamala’s lips, but try to kiss them against Kamala’s will, and you will not get a drop of sweetness from the lips that know how to give so much sweetness! You learn easily, Siddhartha, then learn this too: One can get love by begging, by buying, by receiving it as a gift, by finding it in the street, but one cannot steal it. You have hit on the wrong way. No, it would be too bad if a handsome youth like you were to tackle it so wrongly.”","“No, Samana, I have no fear of this. Has a Samana or a Brahmin ever been afraid that someone might come and seize him and rob him of his learnedness, his piousness, and his profound thoughts? No, for these things belong to him, and he gives of them only what and to whom he will. It is precisely the same with Kamala and the pleasures of love. Beautiful and red is Kamala’s mouth, but try to kiss it against her will and you will get from it not a single drop of sweetness, though it has much sweetness to offer. You are a willing pupil, Siddhartha, so learn this as well: Love can be begged, bought, or received as a gift, one can find it in the street, but one cannot steal it. This notion of yours is misguided. It would be a shame if a handsome youth like you were to set about things in the wrong way.”"
"Nun, dachte er, da alle diese vergänglichsten Dinge mir wieder entglitten sind, nun stehe ich wieder unter der Sonne, wie ich einst als kleines Kind gestanden bin, nichts ist mein, nichts kann ich, nichts vermag ich, nichts habe ich gelernt. Wie ist dies wunderlich! Jetzt, wo ich nicht mehr jung bin, wo meine Haare schon halb grau sind, wo die Kräfte nachlassen, jetzt fange ich wieder von vorn und beim Kinde an! Wieder musste er lächeln. Ja, seltsam war sein Geschick! Es ging abwärts mit ihm, und nun stand er wieder leer und nackt und dumm in der Welt. Aber Kummer darüber konnte er nicht empfinden, nein, er fühlte sogar großen Anreiz zum Lachen, zum Lachen über sich, zum Lachen über diese seltsame, törichte Welt.","Well, he thought, since all these most ephemeral things have slipped away from me again, now I'm standing under the sun again as I once stood as a small child, nothing is mine, I can't do anything, I can't do anything, I haven't learned anything. How wonderful is this! Now that I'm no longer young, when my hair is already half gray, when my strength is flagging, I'll start again from the beginning and start with the child! Again he had to smile. Yes, strange was his skill! Things went downhill with him, and now he was again standing empty and naked and stupid in the world. But he couldn't feel sorrow about it, no, he even felt great incentive to laugh, to laugh at himself, to laugh at this strange, foolish world.","“Well,” he thought, “since all these so ephemeral things have slipped away from me again, I am now standing again under the sun, under which I once stood as a little child.

Now that I am no longer young, now that my hair is already half gray, now that my energy is ebbing—I am starting all over again, like a child!” Again he had to smile. Yes, strange was his fate! Things were going downhill for him, and now he stood again empty and naked and foolish in the world. Yet he could feel no grief, no, he actually felt like laughing, laughing at himself, laughing at this strange and stupid world.","Now that all these utterly transitory things have slipped away from me, he thought, I am left under the sun just as I stood here once as a small child; I own nothing, know nothing, can do nothing, have learned nothing. How curious this is! Now that I am no longer young, now that my hair is already half gray and my strength is beginning to wane, I am starting over again from the beginning, from childhood! Again he had to smile. Yes, it certainly was strange, this fate of his! Things were going downhill with him, and now he was once more standing in the world, empty and naked and foolish. But he could not quite bring himself to feel sorrowful on this account. Indeed, he felt a tremendous urge to burst out laughing: laughter at himself, laughter at this strange, foolish world."

Manche Stunde kauerte er lauschend, sah keine Bilder mehr, sank in die Leere, ließ sich sinken, ohne einen Weg zu sehen.

And so: Siddhartha is not satisfactory to you as he is, with oil in his hair, but no clothes, no shoes, no money?”","Siddhartha said, “Already I am beginning to learn from you. Even yesterday I learned something. Already I have given up my beard and combed and oiled my hair. Very little is still lacking, most splendid woman: fine clothes, fine shoes, money in my wallet. Know that Siddhartha has undertaken far more difficult tasks than these and has succeeded in them. How could I fail to succeed in yesterday’s resolve: to be your friend and learn from you the pleasures of love? You will find me a willing pupil, Kamala; I have learned more difficult things than what you are to teach me. So tell me: Is Siddhartha satisfactory to you as he is now, with oil in his hair but without clothes, shoes, or money?”"
"Siddhartha erhob sich, unerträglich wurde das Treiben des Hungers in seinem Leibe. Hingenommen wanderte er weiter, den Uferpfad hinan, dem Strom entgegen, lauschte auf die Strömung, lauschte auf den knurrenden Hunger in seinem Leibe.","Siddhartha got up, the hunger pangs in his body became unbearable. Accepted, he walked on, up the bank path, towards the current, listening to the current, listening to the rumbling hunger in his body.","Siddhartha stood up; unbearable was the roiling of the hunger in his body. Suffering, he wandered farther, along the bank, upstream, listened to the current, listened to the growling hunger in his body.","Siddhartha got to his feet; the gnawing hunger in his mid-section was becoming unbearable. Lost in thought, he wandered farther along the riverbank, walking upstream, listening to the current and to the growling hunger in his belly."
"Zärtlich blickte er in das strömende Wasser, in das durchsichtige Grün, in die kristallenen Linien seiner geheimnisreichen Zeichnung. Lichte Perlen sah er aus der Tiefe steigen, stille Luftblasen auf dem Spiegel schwimmen, Himmelsbläue darin abgebildet. Mit tausend Augen blickte der Fluss ihn an, mit grünen, mit weißen, mit kristallnen, mit himmelblauen. Wie liebte er dies Wasser, wie entzückte es ihn, wie war er ihm dankbar! Im Herzen hörte er die Stimme sprechen, die neu erwachte, und sie sagte ihm: Liebe dies Wasser! Bleibe bei ihm! Lerne von ihm! O ja, er wollte von ihm lernen, er wollte ihm zuhören. Wer dies Wasser und seine Geheimnisse verstünde, so schien ihm, der würde auch viel anderes verstehen, viele Geheimnisse, alle Geheimnisse.","Tenderly he gazed into the flowing water, into the transparent green, into the crystalline lines of his mysterious drawing. He saw pearls of light rising from the depths, still air bubbles floating on the mirror, the blue of the sky depicted in them. The river looked at him with a thousand eyes, green, white, crystal, sky-blue. How he loved this water, how delighted he was, how grateful he was! In his heart he heard the voice speaking, which awoke anew, and it said to him: Love this water! stay with him! learn from him! Oh yes, he wanted to learn from him, he wanted to listen to him. It seemed to him that anyone who understood this water and its secrets would also understand many other things, many secrets, all secrets.","Tenderly he gazed at the streaming water, at the transparent green, at the crystalline lines of its mysterious pattern.

"Als Siddhartha schon lange im Walde unterwegs war, kam ihm der Gedanke, dass sein Suchen nutzlos sei. Entweder, so dachte er, war der Knabe längst voraus und schon in der Stadt angelangt, oder, wenn er noch unterwegs sein sollte, würde er vor ihm, dem Verfolgenden, sich verborgen halten. Da er weiter dachte, fand er auch, dass er selbst nicht in Sorge um seinen Sohn war, dass er im Innersten wusste, er sei weder umgekommen, noch drohe ihm im Walde Gefahr. Dennoch lief er ohne Rast, nicht mehr, um ihn zu retten, nur aus Verlangen, nur um ihn vielleicht nochmals zu sehen. Und er lief bis vor die Stadt.","When Siddhartha had been out in the forest for a long time, it occurred to him that his search was useless. Either, he thought, the boy was long ahead and had already reached the city, or, if he was still on the way, he would be hiding from the pursuer. As he continued to think, he also found that he himself was not worried about his son, that he knew deep down that he had neither perished nor was there any danger in the forest. Yet he ran without rest, no longer to save him, only out of desire, just to maybe see him again. And he ran to the city.","After Siddhartha had been walking through the forest for a long time, it occurred to him that his seeking was useless.

Thinking further, he also found that he was no longer worried about his son; deep down he knew that his son neither had perished nor was menaced by any danger in the forest.

"»Freund, das möchten viele wissen. Du musst tun, was du gelernt hast, und dir dafür Geld geben lassen, und Kleider, und Schuhe. Anders kommt ein Armer nicht zu Geld.

"Hell strahlte des Fährmanns Lächeln auf; er berührte zart Siddharthas Arm und sagte: »Frage den Fluss darüber, Freund! Höre ihn darüber lachen! Glaubst du denn wirklich, dass du deine Torheiten begangen habest, um sie dem Sohn zu ersparen? Und kannst du denn deinen Sohn vor Sansara schützen? Wie denn? Durch Lehre, durch Gebet, durch Ermahnung? Lieber, hast du jene Geschichte denn ganz vergessen, jene lehrreiche Geschichte vom Brahmanensohn Siddhartha, die du mir einst hier an dieser Stelle erzählt hast? Wer hat den Samana Siddhartha vor Sansara bewahrt, vor Sünde, vor Habsucht, vor Torheit? Hat seines Vaters Frömmigkeit, seiner Lehrer Ermahnung, hat sein eigenes Wissen, sein eigenes Suchen ihn bewahren können? Welcher Vater, welcher Lehrer hat ihn davor schützen können, selbst das Leben zu leben, selbst sich mit dem Leben zu beschmutzen, selbst Schuld auf sich zu laden, selbst den bitteren Trank zu trinken, selber seinen Weg zu finden?","The ferryman's smile shone brightly; he gently touched Siddhartha's arm and said: »Ask the river about it, friend! Hear him laugh about it! Do you really think that you committed your follies to spare your son? And can you protect your son from Sansara? How come? By teaching, by prayer, by exhortation? Dear, have you completely forgotten that story, that instructive story about the Brahman son Siddhartha, which you once told me here at this point? Who saved Samana Siddhartha from Sansara, from sin, from greed, from foolishness? Could his father's piety, his teacher's admonition, his own knowledge, his own searching, keep him?

"In der Tat war seine Seele nicht beim Handel. Die Geschäfte waren gut, um ihm Geld für Kamala einzubringen, und sie brachten weit mehr ein, als er brauchte. Im übrigen war Siddharthas Teilnahme und Neugierde nur bei den Menschen, deren Geschäfte, Handwerke, Sorgen, Lustbarkeiten und Torheiten ihm früher fremd und fern gewesen waren wie der Mond. So leicht es ihm gelang, mit allen zu sprechen, mit allen zu leben, von allen zu lernen, so sehr ward ihm dennoch bewusst, dass etwas sei, was ihn von ihnen trenne, und dies Trennende war sein Samanatum. Er sah die Menschen auf eine kindliche oder tierhafte Art dahinleben, welche er zugleich liebte und auch verachtete. Er sah sie sich mühen, sah sie leiden und grau werden um Dinge, die ihm dieses Preises ganz unwert schienen, um Geld, um kleine Lust, um kleine Ehren, er sah sie einander schelten und beleidigen, er sah sie um Schmerzen wehklagen, über die der Samana lächelt, und unter Entbehrungen leiden, die ein Samana nicht fühlt.","In fact, his soul was not in commerce. The trades were good for bringing him money for Kamala, and they brought in far more than he needed. For the rest, Siddhartha's sympathy and curiosity was only with those people whose businesses, trades, worries, merrymaking and follies had previously been alien and distant to him like the moon. As easily as he managed to speak to everyone, to live with everyone, to learn from everyone, he was nevertheless aware that something was separating him from them, and this separating thing was his Samanatum. He saw people living in a childish or animalistic way, which he both loved and despised. He saw them toil, saw them suffer and turn gray for things that seemed to him quite unworthy of this price, for money, for small pleasures, for small honors, he saw them scold and insult each other, he saw them lament for pain, over which the samana smiles, and suffer from deprivations which a samana does not feel.","And indeed his soul was not with business. Business was good enough to bring him money for Kamala, and it brought in far more than he needed. Otherwise Siddhartha’s sympathy and curiosity lay only with the people whose dealings, handicrafts, anxieties, diversions, and follies had once been as far from him and as foreign to him as the moon. But easily as he managed to speak to everyone, live with everyone, learn from everyone, he nevertheless remained aware that something separated him from them, and what separated them was that he had been a samana. He saw the people living in a childlike and animal fashion, which he both loved and despised. He saw them struggling, saw them suffering, saw them turning gray about things that struck him as not worth this price, about money, about petty pleasures, petty honors. He saw them scolding and insulting one another, he saw them lamenting about pains that the samana smiles at, and suffering from deprivations that the samana never feels.","In fact, his heart wasn’t in his trading. Conducting business was good because it brought him money for Kamala—indeed, much more than he needed. As for the rest, Siddhartha’s interest and curiosity were piqued only by those whose trades, crafts, worries, amusements, and follies had once been as foreign and distant to him as the moon. Easy as it was for him to converse with everyone, live with everyone, learn from everyone, he was nonetheless quite aware that there was something separating him from them, and this thing that set him apart was his life as a Samana. He observed people living in a childish or animal way that he simultaneously loved and deplored. He saw their struggles, watched them suffer and turn gray over things that seemed to him utterly unworthy of such a price—things like money, petty pleasures, petty honors. He saw people scold and insult one another, saw them wailing over aches and pains that would just make a Samana smile, suffering on account of deprivations a Samana would not notice."

"Diese Sage, dies Gerücht, dies Märchen klang auf, duftete empor, hier und dort, in den Städten sprachen die Brahmanen davon, im Wald die Samanas, immer wieder drang der Name Gotamas, des Buddha, zu den Ohren der Jünglinge, im Guten und im Bösen, in Lobpreisung und in Schmähung.","This legend, this rumour, this fairy tale sounded, wafted up, here and there, in the cities the Brahmins spoke of it, in the forest the Samanas, the name of Gotama, the Buddha, repeatedly reached the ears of the youths, in good and in evil, in praise, and in slander.","This legend, this rumor, this tale resounded, fragrantly wafted up, here and there: in the towns the Brahmins talked about it, in the forests the samanas. The name of Gautama, the Buddha, kept reaching the ears of the youths, for better or for worse, with praise or with scorn.","This legend, this rumor, this myth rippled and wafted through the air; in the towns all the Brahmins were speaking of it, in the forest the Samanas. Again and again the youths heard the name of Gautama, the Buddha, uttered by supporters and detractors alike, in both praise and vituperation."
"Nach dieser Gegend hatten alle Erzählungen und Antworten hingewiesen, welche den beiden jungen Asketen auf der Suche nach Gotamas Aufenthalt zuteil wurden. Und da sie in Savathi ankamen, ward ihnen gleich im ersten Hause, vor dessen Tür sie bittend stehen blieben, Speise angeboten, und sie nahmen Speise an, und Siddhartha fragte die Frau, welche ihnen die Speise reichte:","All the tales and answers which the two young ascetics received in their search for Gotama's abode pointed to this region. And when they arrived in Savathi, they were immediately offered food in the first house, in front of whose door they stood begging, and they accepted food, and Siddhartha asked the woman who gave them the food:","This area was indicated by the tales and responses heard by the two young ascetics during their quest for Gautama’s whereabouts. And when they arrived in Savathi, they were offered food at the very first home where they stopped and begged, and they took the food, and Siddhartha asked the woman who served them the food:","This was the place mentioned in all the tales that had been shared with the two young ascetics in their search to discover Gautama’s whereabouts, in all the answers they had received to their queries. And when they arrived in Savathi, they were offered food at the very first house at whose door they stopped to beg, and they accepted it."
"»Mögest du mir, o Erhabener, nicht zürnen«, sagte der Jüngling. »Nicht um Streit mit dir zu suchen, Streit um Worte, habe ich so zu dir gesprochen. Du hast wahrlich recht, wenig ist an Meinungen gelegen. Aber lass mich dies eine noch sagen: Nicht einen Augenblick habe ich an dir gezweifelt. Ich habe nicht einen Augenblick gezweifelt, dass du Buddha bist, dass du das Ziel erreicht hast, das höchste, nach welchem so viel tausend Brahmanen und Brahmanensöhne unterwegs sind. Du hast die Erlösung,vom Tode gefunden. Sie ist dir geworden aus deinem eigenen Suchen, auf deinem eigenen Wege, durch Gedanken, durch Versenkung, durch Erkenntnis, durch Erleuchtung. Nicht ist sie dir geworden durch Lehre! Und – so ist mein Gedanke, o Erhabener – keinem wird Erlösung zu teil durch Lehre! Keinem, o Ehrwürdiger, wirst du in Worten und durch Lehre mitteilen und sagen können, was dir geschehen ist in der Stunde deiner Erleuchtung! Vieles enthält die Lehre des erleuchteten Buddha, viele lehrt sie, rechtschaffen zu leben, Böses zu meiden. Eines aber enthält die so klare, die so ehrwürdige Lehre nicht: sie enthält nicht das Geheimnis dessen, was der Erhabene selbst erlebt hat, er allein unter den Hunderttausenden. Dies ist es, was ich gedacht und erkannt habe, als ich die Lehre hörte. Dies ist es, weswegen ich meine Wanderschaft fortsetze – nicht um eine andere, eine bessere Lehre zu suchen, denn ich weiß, es gibt keine, sondern um alle Lehren und alle Lehrer zu verlassen und allein mein Ziel zu erreichen oder zu sterben. Oftmals aber werde ich dieses Tages denken, o Erhabener, und dieser Stunde, da meine Augen einen Heiligen sahen.«","""May you not be angry with me, O Exalted One,"" said the youth. “I have not spoken to you in this way to seek quarrels with you, quarrels over words. You are truly right, opinions matter little. But let me say this one more thing: I never doubted you for a moment. I have not doubted for a moment that you are Buddha, that you have reached the goal, the highest, toward which so many thousands of Brahmins and Brahmin sons are striving. You have found redemption from death. It has come to you from your own search, on your own way, through thoughts, through contemplation, through knowledge, through enlightenment. It did not come to you through teaching! And - this is my thought, O Exalted One - no one gets salvation through teaching! You will not be able to tell anyone, oh venerable one, in words and through teaching what happened to you in the hour of your enlightenment! There is much in the teaching of the enlightened Buddha, teaching many to live righteously, to avoid evil. But there is one thing that the so clear, so venerable teaching does not contain: it does not contain the secret of what the Blessed One experienced himself, he alone among the hundreds of thousands. This is what I thought and realized when I heard the teaching. This is why I continue my wanderings - not to seek another, better teaching, for I know there is none, but to leave all teachings and all teachers and reach my goal alone or die. Often, however, will I think of this day, O Exalted One, and this hour when my eyes saw a saint.”","“Please, O Sublime One, do not be angry with me,” said the youth. “I have not spoken with you to fight with you or to fight over words. You are truly right: opinions are unimportant. But may I say one thing more? I have never doubted you for a moment, I have never doubted for a moment that you are the Buddha, that you have attained the goal, the highest, which so many thousands of Brahmins and sons of Brahmins are journeying to reach. You have found the deliverance from death. It came to you from your own seeking, on your own path, through thinking, through meditation, through knowledge, through illumination. It did not come through a teaching! And—this is my thought, O Sublime One—no one is granted deliverance through a teaching! You cannot, O Venerable One, impart to anyone, tell anyone in words and through teachings what happened to you in the hour of your illumination. The Teaching of the illuminated Buddha contains a great deal, it teaches many how to live righteously, avoid evil. But there is one thing that the so clear, so venerable Teaching does not contain: it does not contain the secret of what the Sublime One himself has experienced, he alone among the hundreds of thousands. That is what I thought and realized when I heard the Teaching. That is why I am resuming my wandering—not to seek a different, a better teaching, for I know that there is none; but to leave all teachings and all teachers and to reach my goal alone or die. Yet I will often think back to this day, O Sublime One, and to this hour when my eyes beheld a saint.”","“May you not be angry with me, O Sublime One,” the youth replied. “It is not to quarrel, to quibble over words, that I spoke to you thus. Truly you are right; opinions are of little account. But let me say this as well: Never for a moment have I doubted you. I never doubted for a moment that you are the Buddha, that you have reached the goal, the highest goal, toward which so many thousands of Brahmins and Brahmins’ sons are striving. You have found redemption from death. It came to you as you were engaged in a search of your own, upon a path of your own; it came to you through thinking, through meditation, through knowledge, through enlightenment. Not through doctrine did it come to you. And this is my thought, O Sublime One: No one will ever attain redemption through doctrine! Never, O Venerable One, will you be able to convey in words and show and say through your teachings what happened to you in the hour of your enlightenment. Much is contained in the doctrine of the enlightened Buddha; many are taught by it to live in an upright way, to shun evil. But there is one thing this so clear and venerable doctrine does not contain: It does not contain the secret of what the Sublime One himself experienced, he alone among the hundreds of thousands. This is what I thought and realized when I heard the doctrine. This is why I am continuing my journey—not in order to seek a different, better doctrine, for I know there is none, but to leave behind me all teachings and all teachers and to reach my goal alone or perish. But often will I remember this day, O Sublime One, and this hour when my eyes beheld a holy man.”"

"Nachdem er lange beim Tor des Gartens gestanden war, sah Siddhartha ein, dass das Verlangen töricht war, das ihn bis zu dieser Stätte getrieben hatte, dass er seinem Sohne nicht helfen konnte, dass er sich nicht an ihn hängen durfte.

"Der Magd aber befahl sie, dem frommen Brahmanen ein weißes Obergewand zu geben.

"So lobte er sich, hatte Freude an sich, hörte neugierig seinem Magen zu, der vor Hunger knurrte. Ein Stück Leid, ein Stück Elend hatte er nun, so fühlte er, in diesen letzten Zeiten und Tagen ganz und gar durchgekostet und ausgespien, bis zur Verzweiflung und bis zum Tode ausgefressen. So war es gut. Lange noch hätte er bei Kamaswami bleiben können, Geld erwerben, Geld vergeuden, seinen Bauch mästen und seine Seele verdursten lassen, lange noch hätte er in dieser sanften, wohlgepolsterten Hölle wohnen können, wäre dies nicht gekommen: der Augenblick der vollkommenen Trostlosigkeit und Verzweiflung, jener äußerste Augenblick, da er über dem strömenden Wasser hing und bereit war, sich zu vernichten. Dass er diese Verzweiflung, diesen tiefsten Ekel gefühlt hatte, und dass er ihm nicht erlegen war, dass der Vogel, die frohe Quelle und Stimme in ihm doch noch lebendig war, darüber fühlte er diese Freude, darüber lachte er, darüber strahlte sein Gesicht unter den ergrauten Haaren.","So he praised himself, took pleasure in himself, listened curiously to his stomach, which was growling with hunger.

Long could he have stayed with Kamaswami, earning money, squandering money, fattening his belly and letting his soul thirst, long could he have dwelt in this soft, well-cushioned hell, if this had not come: the moment of utter desolation and despair, that extreme moment when he hung above the flowing water and was ready to annihilate himself.

He had felt that despair, that deepest disgust, and he had not succumbed: the bird, the cheerful source and voice in him were still alive; and that was why he felt this joy, why he laughed, why his face beamed under his graying hair.","In this way he praised himself and felt pleased with himself, listening with curiosity to his stomach, which was rumbling with hunger. He had tasted his share of sorrow and misery these past days and times, tasted them and spit them out, eaten of them till he had reached the point of despair, of death. All was well. He might have remained a great while longer at Kamaswami’s side, earning money, squandering money, stuffing his belly and letting his soul thirst; he might have gone on living a great while longer in this cozy well-upholstered hell if that moment had not come: that moment of utter despondency and despair, that extreme moment when he was hanging above the flowing water, ready to destroy himself. That he had felt this despair, this deepest nausea, and yet had not succumbed to it, that the bird, the happy fountainhead and voice within him, had remained alive after all—it was because of all these things that he now felt such joy, that he laughed, that his face was beaming beneath his gray hair."
"»Ja, Siddhartha,« sprach er. »Es ist doch dieses, was du meinst: dass der Fluss überall zugleich ist, am Ursprung und an der Mündung, am Wasserfall, an der Fähre, an der Stromschnelle, im Meer, im Gebirge, überall zugleich, und dass es für ihn nur Gegenwart gibt, nicht den Schatten Vergangenheit, nicht den Schatten Zukunft?«","""Yes, Siddhartha,"" he said. ""It's what you mean: that the river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at the same time, and that it is only for him present, not the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?”","“Yes, Siddhartha,” he said. “Is this what you mean: that the river is everywhere at once, at its source and at its mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at once, and only the present exists for it, and not the shadow of the future?”","“Yes, Siddhartha,” he said. “Is this what you mean: that the river is in all places at once, at its source and where it flows into the sea, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the ocean, in the mountains, everywhere at once, so for the river there is only the present moment and not the shadow of a future?”"
"»Kann ich mich denn von ihm trennen?« sagte er leise, beschämt. »Lass mir noch Zeit, Lieber! Sieh, ich kämpfe um ihn, ich werbe um sein Herz, mit Liebe und mit freundlicher Geduld will ich es fangen. Auch zu ihm soll einst der Fluss reden, auch er ist berufen.«","""Can I part with him?"" he said softly, ashamed. ""Give me time, dear! See, I fight for him, I woo his heart, with love and kind patience I want to catch it. The river should also speak to him one day, he too is called.”","“Can I part with him?” he asked softly, embarrassed. “Give me more time, dear friend! Look, I am fighting for him, I am wooing his heart, I want to capture it with love and friendly patience. Let the river speak to him too someday; he too is called.”","“Could I bring myself to part with him?” he asked quietly, ashamed. “Give me more time, my friend! I am fighting for him, you see, trying to win his heart and hoping to capture it with loving-kindness and patience. To him too the river must speak someday; he too has a calling.”"
"»Fern ist ein solcher Gedanke von mir«, rief Siddhartha. »Mögen sie alle bei der Lehre bleiben, mögen sie ihr Ziel erreichen! Nicht steht mir zu, über eines andern Leben zu urteilen. Einzig für mich, für mich allein muss ich urteilen, muss ich wählen, muss ich ablehnen. Erlösung vom Ich suchen wir Samanas, o Erhabener. Wäre ich nun einer deiner Jünger, o Ehrwürdiger, so fürchte ich, es möchte mir geschehen, dass nur scheinbar, nur trügerisch mein Ich zur Ruhe käme und erlöst würde, dass es aber in Wahrheit weiterlebte und groß würde, denn ich hätte dann die Lehre, hätte meine Nachfolge, hätte meine Liebe zu dir, hätte die Gemeinschaft der Mönche zu meinem Ich gemacht!«","""Far is such a thought from me,"" cried Siddhartha. »May they all stick to the teaching, may they achieve their goal! It is not my place to judge another's life. Only for me, for myself alone, must I judge, must I choose, must I reject. We seek salvation from self Samanas, O Exalted One. If I were now one of your disciples, o venerable one, I fear that it might happen to me that only apparently, only deceptively, my ego would come to rest and be redeemed, but that in truth it would live on and grow, because then I would have the lesson , had my successor, had my love for you, would have made the community of monks my ego!«","“Such a thought is remote from me,” cried Siddhartha. “May they all remain with the Teaching, may they reach their goal! It is not for me to judge another man’s life! I must judge, I must choose, I must spurn purely for myself, for myself alone. We samanas, O Sublime One, are seeking deliverance from the ego. Now if I were one of your disciples, O Venerable One, I fear that my ego would find peace and deliverance only as a figment, as a delusion. I fear that my ego would actually live on and grow big, for I would then have made the Teaching, made my following, made my love for you, made the fellowship of the monks into my ego!”","“Far be it from me to entertain such a thought!” Siddhartha cried. “May they all remain faithful to the doctrine, may they reach their goal! It is not fitting for me to pass judgment on another’s life! Only for myself, for myself alone, must I judge, must I choose, must I reject. Redemption from Self is what we Samanas seek, O Sublime One. If I were one of your disciples, O Venerable One, what I fear might happen is that my Self would only apparently, deceptively find peace and be redeemed, but that in truth it would live on and become huge, for I would have made the doctrine and my adherence to it and my love for you and the fellowship of the monks my Self!”"
"Während aber Govinda verwundert, und dennoch von großer Liebe und Ahnung gezogen, seinen Worten gehorchte, sich nahe zu ihm neigte und seine Stirn mit den Lippen berührte, geschah ihm etwas Wunderbares. Während seine Gedanken noch bei Siddharthas wunderlichen Worten verweilten, während er sich noch vergeblich und mit Widerstreben bemühte, sich die Zeit hinwegzudenken, sich Nirvana und Sansara als Eines vorzustellen, während sogar eine gewisse Verachtung für die Worte des Freundes in ihm mit einer ungeheuren Liebe und Ehrfurcht stritt, geschah ihm dieses:","But while Govinda, amazed and yet drawn by great love and foreboding, obeyed his words, leaned close to him and touched his forehead with his lips, something wonderful happened to him. While his thoughts still lingered on Siddhartha's wondrous words, while he still tried in vain and with reluctance to think away time, to imagine Nirvana and Sansara as one, while even a certain contempt for the words of his friend with an immense love and reverence, this happened to him:","But while Govinda, surprised and yet drawn by great love and premonition, obeyed Siddhartha’s words, leaned over to him, and touched his forehead with his lips, something wonderful happened to him. While his thoughts still dwelled on Siddhartha’s peculiar words, while he vainly and reluctantly tried to think time away, to imagine Nirvana and samsara as one, while a certain scorn for his friend’s words struggled in him with tremendous love and reverence, this happened to him:","When Govinda, perplexed and yet drawn by great love and foreboding, obeyed his words, bent down close to him, and touched his forehead with his lips, something wondrous happened to him. While his thoughts were still lingering over Siddhartha’s odd words, while he was still fruitlessly and reluctantly attempting to think away time, to imagine Nirvana and Sansara as one, while a certain contempt for his friend’s words was even then battling inside him with tremendous love and reverence, this happened:"
Siddhartha aber wandelte in Gedanken durch den Hain.,But Siddhartha wandered through the grove in his thoughts.,"Siddhartha, however, walked through the grove, lost in thought.","Siddhartha wandered through the grove, deep in thought."
"Als es am andern Morgen Zeit war, die Tageswanderung anzutreten, da sagte Govinda, nicht ohne Zögern, die Worte: »Ehe ich meinen Weg fortsetze, Siddhartha, erlaube mir noch eine Frage. Hast du eine Lehre? Hast du einen Glauben, oder ein Wissen, dem du folgst, das dir leben und rechttun hilft?«","When it was time to start the day's hike the next morning, Govinda said, not without hesitation, the words: ""Before I continue on my way, Siddhartha, allow me one more question. do you have an apprenticeship Do you have a belief or knowledge that you follow that helps you live and do right?""","The next morning, when it was time to begin his day’s wandering, Govinda, not without hesitating, spoke these words: “Before I continue on my way, Siddhartha, permit me one last question. Do you have a teaching? Do you have a faith or a knowledge that you follow , that helps you live and do right?”","When, the next morning, it was time for Govinda to set off again on his day’s journey, he said these words, not without hesitation: “Before I set off on my way again, Siddhartha, allow me one last question. Do you have a doctrine? Is there a belief or some knowledge that guides you, that helps you to live and do what is right?”"
"»Abwärts geht es mit dir!« sagte er zu sich selber, und lachte dazu, und wie er es sagte, fiel sein Blick auf den Fluss, und auch den Fluss sah er abwärts gehen, immer abwärts wandern, und dabei singen und fröhlich sein. Das gefiel ihm wohl, freundlich lächelte er dem Flusse zu. War dies nicht der Fluss, in welchem er sich hatte ertränken wollen, einst, vor hundert Jahren, oder hatte er das geträumt?","""You're going down!"" he said to himself, and laughed, and as he said it, his eyes fell on the river, and he saw the river going down, always going down, and singing and being merry at the same time . That pleased him well, he smiled affably at the river. Wasn't this the river in which he had wanted to drown himself a hundred years ago, or had he dreamed it?","“Things are going downhill with you!” he said to himself and laughed, and as he said it, he looked at the river, and he saw the river also going downhill, always wandering downhill, and yet singing and remaining cheerful. He liked that, he gave the river a friendly smile. Was this not the river in which he had wanted to drown, once, a century ago, or had he merely dreamed it?","Things are going downhill with you! he said to himself, laughing, and as he said this his eyes came to rest upon the river, and he saw the river too going downhill, wandering always downhill and singing gaily all the while. This pleased him greatly, and he gave the river a friendly smile. Was this not the river in which he had wished to drown once, a hundred years before, or had it only been a dream?"
"Der im langsamen Dahingehen Denkende blieb stehen, von diesem Gedanken erfasst, und alsbald sprang aus diesem Gedanken ein anderer hervor, ein neuer Gedanke, der lautete: »Dass ich nichts von mir weiß, dass Siddhartha mir so fremd und unbekannt geblieben ist, das kommt aus einer Ursache, einer einzigen: Ich hatte Angst vor mir, ich war auf der Flucht vor mir! Atman suchte ich, Brahman suchte ich, ich war gewillt, mein Ich zu zerstücken und auseinander zu schälen, um in seinem unbekannten Innersten den Kern aller Schalen zu finden, den Atman, das Leben, das Göttliche, das Letzte. Ich selbst aber ging mir dabei verloren.«","The one who was thinking as he walked slowly along stopped, seized by this thought, and soon another thought sprang forth from this thought, a new thought that read: “That I don’t know anything about myself, that Siddhartha has remained so alien and unknown to me, that’s coming for one reason, one: I was afraid of myself, I was running away from myself! I was looking for Atman, I was looking for Brahman, I was willing to dismember and peel apart my ego to find in its unknown core the core of all shells, the Atman, life, the divine, the ultimate. But I got lost in the process.”","The thinking man, walking along slowly, halted, overcome by that thought; and instantly another thought sprang from that one, a new thought: “There is only one reason, a single one, why I know nothing about myself, why Siddhartha has remained so foreign to myself, so unknown. The reason is that I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing myself! I was seeking Atman, I was seeking Brahma. I was willing to dismember my ego and peel it apart in order to find the core of all peels in its unknown innermost essence: to find Atman, Life, the Divine, the Ultimate. But I myself was lost in the process.”","Gripped by this thought, the slowly walking thinker stopped short, and at once a further thought sprang from the first one, a thought that was new to him. That I know nothing of myself, that Siddhartha has remained such a stranger to me, such an unknown, comes from one cause, from a single cause : I was afraid of myself, was running away from myself! I was searching for Atman, searching for Brahman; I was prepared to chop my ego into little pieces and peel off its layers so as to find, in its unknown innermost core, the kernel that lies at the heart of every husk: Atman, Life, the Divine, that final utmost thing. But I myself got lost in the process."
"»Wie bin ich taub und stumpf gewesen!« dachte der rasch dahin Wandelnde. »Wenn einer eine Schrift liest, deren Sinn er suchen will, so verachtet er nicht die Zeichen und Buchstaben und nennt sie Täuschung, Zufall und wertlose Schale, sondern er liest sie, er studiert und liebt sie, Buchstabe um Buchstabe. Ich aber, der ich das Buch der Welt und das Buch meines eigenen Wesens lesen wollte, ich habe, einem im voraus vermuteten Sinn zuliebe, die Zeichen und Buchstaben verachtet, ich nannte die Welt der Erscheinungen Täuschung, nannte mein Auge und meine Zunge zufällige und wertlose Erscheinungen. Nein, dies ist vorüber, ich bin erwacht, ich bin in der Tat erwacht und heute erst geboren.«","""How deaf and dull I have been!"" thought the man who was quickly walking along. ""When someone reads a writing whose meaning he wants to seek, he does not despise the signs and letters and call them deception, chance and worthless shells, but he reads them, he studies and loves them, letter by letter. But I, who wanted to read the book of the world and the book of my own being, for the sake of a presupposed meaning, I despised signs and letters, I called the world of appearances illusion, called my eye and my tongue accidental and worthless apparitions. No, this is over, I am awake, I am indeed awake and just born today.«","“How deaf and dense I was!” thought the swift walker. “If someone reads a manuscript, trying to find its meaning, he does not scorn the signs and letters, calling them deception, happenstance, and worthless peels. Instead, he reads them, he studies and loves them, letter by letter. But I, who wanted to read the book of the world and the book of my own being, I, for the sake of a presumed meaning, scorned the signs and the letters, I called the world of appearances deception, called my eyes and my tongue random and worthless. No, that is past, I have awakened, I am truly awake, and today is the day of my birth.”","How deaf I have been, how unfeeling! he thought, walking ever more swiftly. When a person reads something and wishes to grasp its meaning, he does not scorn the characters and letters and call them illusory, random, and worthless husks; he reads them, studies them, and loves them, letter for letter. But I—I who set out to read the book of the world and the book of my own being—I scorned the characters and letters in deference to a meaning I assumed in advance, I called the world of appearances illusory, called my own eye and my own tongue random and worthless illusions. Enough of all this. I have awoken, have truly awoken, and this day is the day of my birth."
"So habe ich noch keinen Menschen blicken und lächeln, sitzen und schreiten sehen, dachte er, so wahrlich wünsche auch ich blicken und lächeln, sitzen und schreiten zu können, so frei, so ehrwürdig, so verborgen, so offen, so kindlich und geheimnisvoll. So wahrlich blickt und schreitet nur der Mensch, der ins Innerste seines Selbst gedrungen ist. Wohl, auch ich werde ins Innerste meines Selbst zu dringen suchen.","I've never seen anyone look and smile, sit and walk like this, he thought, so truly do I wish to be able to look and smile, sit and walk, so freely, so dignified, so hidden, so open, so childlike and mysterious. Only the human being who has penetrated into the innermost core of himself sees and walks so truly. Well, I too will try to penetrate into the innermost part of myself.","I have never seen anyone gaze and smile like that, sit and stride like that, he thought. Truly, I wish I could gaze and smile, sit and stride like that, so free, so venerable, so concealed, so open, so childlike and mysterious. Truly, a man gazes and strides like that only if he has reached the innermost core of his ego. Fine, I too will try to pierce to the innermost core of my ego.","Never have I seen a man gaze and smile like this, sit and walk like this, he thought; I myself would like to be able to gaze and smile, sit and walk in just such a way, so freely, so venerably, so secretly, so openly, so childishly and mysteriously. Truly, only a man who has penetrated the innermost core of his being can gaze and walk like that. Very well, I too will seek to penetrate the innermost core of my being."
"»Sehr hübsch ist dies alles,« rief Kamaswami unwillig, »aber tatsächlich bist du doch ein Händler, sollte ich meinen! Oder bist du denn nur zu deinem Vergnügen gereist?«","'It's all very pretty,' cried Kamaswami indignantly, 'but you're actually a trader, I should think! Or did you only travel for your pleasure?”","“That is all very nice,” Kamaswami cried indignantly, “but I should think you really are a merchant! Or did you travel purely for your pleasure?”",“How very lovely!” Kamaswami cried out indignantly. “But in fact a tradesman is just what you are! Or did you undertake this journey solely for your own pleasure?”
"Dann hatte Siddhartha die Nacht in seinem Hause mit Tänzerinnen beim Weine zugebracht, hatte gegen seine Standesgenossen den überlegenen gespielt, welcher er nicht mehr war, hatte viel Wein getrunken und spät nach Mitternacht sein Lager aufgesucht, müde und dennoch erregt, dem Weinen und der Verzweiflung nahe, und hatte lang vergeblich den Schlaf gesucht, das Herz voll eines Elendes, das er nicht mehr ertragen zu können meinte, voll eines Ekels, von dem er sich durchdrungen fühlte wie vom lauen, widerlichen Geschmack des Weines, der allzu süßen, öden Musik, dem allzu weichen Lächeln der Tänzerinnen, dem allzu süßen Duft ihrer Haare und Brüste. Mehr aber als vor allem anderen ekelte ihm vor sich selbst, vor seinen duftenden Haaren, vor dem Weingeruch seines Mundes, vor der schlaffen Müdigkeit und Unlust seiner Haut. Wie wenn einer, der allzuviel gegessen oder getrunken hat, es unter Qualen wieder erbricht und doch der Erleichterung froh ist, so wünschte sich der Schlaflose, in einem ungeheuren Schwall von Ekel sich dieser Genüsse, dieser Gewohnheiten, dieses ganzen sinnlosen Lebens und seiner selbst zu entledigen. Erst beim Schein des Morgens und dem Erwachen der ersten Geschäftigkeit auf der Straße vor seinem Stadthause war er eingeschlummert, hatte für wenige Augenblicke eine halbe Betäubung, eine Ahnung von Schlaf gefunden. In diesen Augenblicken hatte er einen Traum:","Then Siddhartha had spent the night in his house with the dancers drinking wine, had played the superior to his peers, which he was no longer, had drunk a lot of wine and went to his bed late after midnight, tired and yet excited, with tears and despair near, and had long sought sleep in vain, his heart full of misery that he thought he could bear no more, full of a disgust that penetrated him like the tepid, disgusting taste of wine, the all too sweet, dreary music , the too-soft smiles of the dancers, the too-sweet smell of their hair and breasts. But more than anything else, he was disgusted by himself, by his fragrant hair, by the smell of wine in his mouth, by the slack tiredness and listlessness of his skin. As when someone who has eaten or drunk too much vomits it up again in agony and yet is glad of the relief, so the insomniac, in a tremendous surge of disgust, wished for these pleasures, these habits, this whole meaningless life and himself get rid of It was not until the morning light and the first bustling activity on the street in front of his town house that he fell asleep, and for a few moments he felt half stunned, an inkling of sleep. In those moments he had a dream:","Then Siddhartha had spent the night in his house with wine and dancing girls, had played the superior to his peers, the superior man that he no longer was. He had drunk a lot of wine and gone to bed long after midnight, weary and yet agitated, on the verge of weeping and despairing, and tried and tried but failed to find sleep. His heart was full of a misery that he thought he could no longer bear, full of a disgust that permeated him like the tepid, repulsive taste of wine, the all-too-sweet and bleak music, the all-too-soft smiles of the dancing girls, the all-too-sweet scent of their hair and breasts. But above all, he was disgusted at himself, at his fragrant hair, at the smell of wine from his mouth, at the slack fatigue and surfeit of his skin. Like someone who has eaten or drunk too much and vomits it up, tormented, and yet glad about the relief, the sleepless man, in a tremendous surge of disgust, wished he were rid of these pleasures, these habits, this whole senseless life and himself. It was not before the glow of morning and the first bustle outside his town house that he fell asleep, that he found a half numbing, an inkling of sleep for a few moments. And in those moments he had a dream:","Siddhartha had spent the night in his home with dancing girls and wine, had made a show of superiority before others of his standing, though he was no longer superior, had drunk a great deal of wine, and had gone to bed long after midnight, weary and yet agitated, close to tears and despair. For a long time he sought sleep in vain, his heart full of a misery he felt he could no longer endure, full of a nausea that coursed through him like the vile, insipid taste of the wine, like the dreary all-too-sweet music, the all-too-soft smiles of the dancers, the all-too-sweet perfume of their hair and breasts. But nothing made the nausea well up in him more bitterly than did he himself He felt nausea at his perfumed hair, the smell of wine on his breath, the weary slackness and reluctance of his skin. Just as someone who has eaten or drunk too much vomits it up again in agony and yet is glad for the relief, sleepless Siddhartha yearned for a monstrous wave of nausea that would rid him of these pleasures, these habits, this whole meaningless existence and himself along with it. Only with the first rays of morning and with the first stirrings in the street outside his town house had he sunk into slumber and found a few moments of half numbness, a suggestion of sleep. During these moments he had a dream."
"Sein Ziel verfolgend, ließ er sich von der Stadt einschlürfen, trieb im Strom der Gassen, stand auf Plätzen still, ruhte auf Steintreppen am Flusse aus. Gegen den Abend befreundete er sich mit einem Barbiergehilfen, den er im Schatten eines Gewölbes hatte arbeiten sehen, den er betend in einem Tempel Vishnus wiederfand, dem er von den Geschichten Vishnu's und der Lakschmi erzählte. Bei den Booten am Flusse schlief er die Nacht, und früh am Morgen, ehe die ersten Kunden in seinen Laden kamen, ließ er sich von dem Barbiergehilfen den Bart rasieren und das Haar beschneiden, das Haar kämmen und mit feinem Öle salben. Dann ging er im Flusse baden.","Pursuing his goal, he let the city lull him in, drifted in the stream of streets, stood still in squares, rested on stone steps by the river.

He slept at night by the boats on the river, and early in the morning, before the first customers came into his shop, he had the barber's assistant shave his beard and trim his hair, comb his hair and anoint him with fine oil.

"Es kam ein Tag, an welchem des jungen Siddhartha Sinn zum Ausbruch kam und sich offen gegen seinen Vater wandte. Der hatte ihm einen Auftrag erteilt, er hatte ihn Reisig sammeln geheißen.

"»Hast du,« so fragte er ihn einst, »hast auch du vom Flusse jenes Geheime gelernt: dass es keine Zeit gibt?«","""Have you,"" he once asked him, ""did you also learn that secret from the river: that there is no time?""","“Did the river,” he once asked, “also teach you this secret: that time does not exist?”","“Have you too,” he asked him once, “have you too learned this secret from the river: that time does not exist?”"

"Kamalas Wunde wurde gewaschen, war aber schon schwarz und ihr Leib angeschwollen, ein Heiltrank wurde ihr eingeflösst.

"Wohl spürte er, dass diese Liebe, diese blinde Liebe zu seinem Sohn eine Leidenschaft, etwas sehr Menschliches, dass sie Sansara sei, eine trübe Quelle, ein dunkles Wasser.

"Lange noch brannte die Wunde. Manchen Reisenden musste Siddhartha über den Fluss setzen, der einen Sohn oder eine Tochter bei sich hatte, und keinen von ihnen sah er, ohne dass er ihn beneidete, ohne dass er dachte: »So viele, so viel Tausende besitzen dies holdeste Glück – warum ich nicht? Auch böse Menschen, auch Diebe, und Räuber haben Kinder, und lieben sie, und werden von ihnen geliebt, nur ich nicht.« So einfach, so ohne Verstand dachte er nun, so ähnlich war er den Kindermenschen geworden.","The wound burned for a long time. Siddhartha had to carry many a traveler across the river who had a son or daughter with him, and he saw none of them without envying them, without thinking: “So many, so many thousands have this sweetest happiness – why not me?

So simple, so stupid was his thought, so much like the child-like people he had become.","The wound burned for a long time.

A number of the travelers Siddhartha ferried across the river had a son or daughter with them, and he was never able to look at them without feeling envy, without thinking, So many, many thousands enjoy this most precious sort of happiness; why can’t I? Even wicked people, even thieves and robbers have children and love them and are loved by them; I alone do not. How simple his thoughts had now become, how lacking in understanding. That’s how greatly he had come to resemble the child people."
"Gleich darauf, da sich der Buddha zur Nachtruhe zurückgezogen hatte, wendete sich Govinda zu Siddhartha und sprach eifrig: »Siddhartha, nicht steht es mir zu, dir einen Vorwurf zu machen. Beide haben wir den Erhabenen gehört, beide haben wir die Lehre vernommen. Govinda hat die Lehre gehört, er hat seine Zuflucht zu ihr genommen. Du aber, Verehrter, willst denn nicht auch du den Pfad der Erlösung gehen? Willst du zögern, willst du noch warten?«","Immediately afterwards, when the Buddha had retired to sleep, Govinda turned to Siddhartha and spoke eagerly: »Siddhartha, it is not my place to reproach you.

Do you want to hesitate, do you want to wait?""","Promptly thereupon, when the Buddha had retired to his nightly rest, Govinda turned to Siddhartha and eagerly said: “Siddhartha, it is not my place to reproach you. Both of us have heard the Sublime One, both of us have listened to his Teaching. Govinda has heard the Teaching, and he has taken refuge with it. But you, my honored friend—do you not wish to follow the path of deliverance too? Do you wish to hesitate, do you wish to wait?”","Directly afterward, when the Buddha had retired for the night, Govinda turned to Siddhartha and spoke earnestly. “Siddhartha, it is not fitting for me to reproach you. Both of us heard the Sublime One; both of us heard his teachings. Govinda heard the doctrine and has taken refuge in it. But you, my revered friend, will you not also tread the path of redemption?

"Da er sich erhob, hatte Vasudeva Reis für ihn bereitet. Doch aß Siddhartha nicht. Im Stall, wo ihre Ziege stand, machten sich die beiden Alten eine Streu zurecht, und Vasudeva legte sich schlafen.

"Zuzeiten spürte er, tief in der Brust, eine sterbende, leise Stimme, die mahnte leise, klagte leise, kaum dass er sie vernahm. Alsdann kam ihm für eine Stunde zum Bewusstsein, dass er ein seltsames Leben führe, dass er da lauter Dinge tue, die bloß ein Spiel waren, dass er wohl heiter sei und zuweilen Freude fühle, dass aber das eigentliche Leben dennoch an ihm vorbeifließe und ihn nicht berühre. Wie ein Ballspieler mit seinen Bällen spielt, so spielte er mit seinen Geschäften, mit den Menschen seiner Umgebung, sah ihnen zu, fand seinen Spaß an ihnen; mit dem Herzen, mit der Quelle seines Wesens war er nicht dabei. Die Quelle lief irgendwo, wie fern von ihm, lief und lief unsichtbar, hatte nichts mehr mit seinem Leben zu tun. Und einigemal erschrak er ob solchen Gedanken und wünschte sich, es möge doch auch ihm gegeben sein, bei all dem kindlichen Tun des Tages mit Leidenschaft und mit dem Herzen beteiligt zu sein, wirklich zu leben, wirklich zu tun, wirklich zu genießen und zu leben, statt nur so als ein Zuschauer daneben zu stehen. Immer aber kam er wieder zur schönen Kamala, lernte Liebeskunst, übte den Kult der Lust, bei welchem mehr als irgendwo geben und nehmen zu einem wird, plauderte mit ihr, lernte von ihr, gab ihr Rat, empfing Rat. Sie verstand ihn besser, als Govinda ihn einst verstanden hatte, sie war ihm ähnlicher.","At times he felt, deep in his chest, a dying, quiet voice, which quietly admonished, softly lamented, as soon as he heard it. Then for an hour he became aware that he was leading a strange life, that he was doing nothing but things that were just a game, that he was cheerful and sometimes felt happy, but that real life was still flowing past him and him don't touch. As a ball player plays with his balls, so he played with his business, with the people around him, watched them, found fun in them; he was not there with his heart, with the source of his being. The source ran somewhere, how far from him, ran and ran invisibly, no longer had anything to do with his life. And sometimes he was frightened by such thoughts and wished that he too might be able to be passionately and heartily involved in all the childish activities of the day, to really live, really do, really enjoy and live , instead of just standing there as a spectator. But he always came back to beautiful Kamala, learned the art of love, practiced the cult of lust, in which more than just giving and taking becomes one, chatted with her, learned from her, gave her advice, received advice. She understood him better than Govinda had once understood him, she was more like him.","At times he heard, deep in his breast, a soft and dying voice that admonished softly, lamented softly, barely audible. Then for an hour he was aware that he was leading a strange life, that he was doing all sorts of things that were merely a game, that he was cheerful, granted, and sometimes felt joy, but that real life was flowing past him and not touching him. Like a juggler juggling his balls, he played with his business, with the people around him, watched them, enjoyed them; but he never participated with his heart, with the wellspring of his being. The wellspring ran somewhere, as if far from him, ran and ran, invisible, having nothing to do with his life. And sometimes he was startled by such thoughts and wished that it could be granted him to participate with passion and with all his heart in the childlike doings of the day, to live really—to act really, to enjoy really, and to live really instead of merely standing on the side as a spectator. But he always went back to beautiful Kamala, learned the art of love, practiced the cult of pleasure, in which, more than anywhere else, giving and taking become one. He chatted with her, learned from her, gave her advice, got her advice. She understood him better than Govinda had understood him, she was more similar to Siddhartha.","At times he felt, deep down in his breast, a faint, dying voice faintly warning him, faintly lamenting, so faint he could scarcely hear it. At once he would become conscious for an hour that he was living a strange life, that all the things he was doing here were but a game, and that, while he was in good spirits and at times felt joy, life itself was nonetheless rushing by without touching him. Like a juggler with his balls, he was just playing in his business dealings with the people around him, watching them, taking his pleasure in them; his heart, the fountainhead of his being, was not in it. This fountainhead was flowing somewhere else, as if far distant from him, invisibly flowing and flowing, no longer part of his life. Now and again he was seized with horror at these thoughts and wished that he too might be permitted to join in all these childish goings-on with passion, with all his heart—that he might be permitted truly to live, truly to act, truly to enjoy and live rather than just standing there as a spectator. But again and again he returned to beautiful Kamala, learned the art of love, practiced the cult of pleasure in which, more than in any other sphere, giving and taking become one. He conversed with her, learned from her, gave her counsel, received counsel. She understood him better than Govinda had once understood him; she resembled him more closely."
"Siddhartha setzte sich zu dem Greise, langsam begann er zu sprechen. Worüber sie niemals gesprochen hatten, davon erzählte er jetzt, von seinem Gange zur Stadt, damals, von der brennenden Wunde, von seinem Neid beim Anblick glücklicher Väter, von seinem Wissen um die Torheit solcher Wünsche, von seinem vergeblichen Kampf wider sie.

"Am Abend aber, als die Hitze sich legte und alles im Lager lebendig ward und sich versammelte, hörten sie den Buddha lehren. Sie hörten seine Stimme, und auch sie war vollkommen, war von vollkommener Ruhe, war voll von Frieden. Gotama lehrte die Lehre vom Leiden, von der Herkunft des Leidens, vom Weg zur Aufhebung des Leidens. Ruhig floss und klar seine stille Rede. Leiden war das Leben, voll Leid war die Welt, aber Erlösung vom Leid war gefunden: Erlösung fand, wer den Weg des Buddha ging. Mit sanfter, doch fester Stimme sprach der Erhabene, lehrte die vier Hauptsätze, lehrte den achtfachen Pfad, geduldig ging er den gewohnten Weg der Lehre, der Beispiele, der Wiederholungen, hell und still schwebte seine Stimme über den Hörenden, wie ein Licht, wie ein Sternhimmel.","But in the evening, when the heat abated and everyone in the camp came alive and gathered, they heard the Buddha teaching. They heard his voice and it too was perfect, was of perfect stillness, was full of peace. Gotama taught the doctrine of suffering, the origin of suffering, the path to the cessation of suffering. His silent speech flowed smoothly and clearly. Life was suffering, the world was full of suffering, but salvation from suffering was found: salvation was found by those who followed the path of the Buddha. With a soft but firm voice the Blessed One spoke, taught the four main tenets, taught the eightfold path, he patiently walked the usual path of teaching, examples, repetitions, bright and still his voice hovered over the listener, like a light, like a starry sky.","That evening, however, when the heat subsided and everyone in the camp grew lively and gathered together, they heard the Buddha teach.

"»Ich scherze nicht. Ich sage, was ich gefunden habe. Wissen kann man mitteilen, Weisheit aber nicht. Man kann sie finden, man kann sie leben, man kann von ihr getragen werden, man kann mit ihr Wunder tun, aber sagen und lehren kann man sie nicht. Dies war es, was ich schon als Jüngfing manchmal ahnte, was mich von den Lehrern fortgetrieben hat. Ich habe einen Gedanken gefunden, Govinda, den du wieder für Scherz oder für Narrheit halten wirst, der aber mein, bester Gedanke ist. Er heißt: Von jeder Wahrheit ist das Gegenteil ebenso wahr! Nämlich so: eine Wahrheit lässt sich immer nur aussprechen und in Worte hüllen, wenn sie einseitig ist. Einseitig ist alles, was mit Gedanken gedacht und mit Worten gesagt werden kann, alles einseitig, alles halb, alles entbehrt der Ganzheit, des Runden, der Einheit. Wenn der erhabene Gotama lehrend von der Welt sprach, so musste er sie teilen in Sansara und Nirvana, in Täuschung und Wahrheit, in Leid und Erlösung. Man kann nicht anders, es gibt keinen andern Weg für den, der lehren will. Die Welt selbst aber, das Seiende um uns her und in uns innen, ist nie einseitig. Nie ist ein Mensch, oder eine Tat, ganz Sansara oder ganz Nirvana, nie ist ein Mensch ganz heilig oder ganz sündig. Es scheint ja so, weil wir der Täuschung unterworfen sind, dass Zeit etwas Wirkliches sei. Zeit ist nicht wirklich, Govinda, ich habe dies oft und oft erfahren. Und wenn Zeit nicht wirklich ist, so ist die Spanne, die zwischen Welt und Ewigkeit, zwischen Leid und Seligkeit, zwischen Böse und Gut zu liegen scheint, auch eine Täuschung.«","""I'm not joking.

I have found a thought, Govinda, which you will again take for a joke or for folly, but which is my best thought. It means: The opposite of every truth is just as true! Namely like this: a truth can only ever be expressed and wrapped in words if it is one-sided. Everything that can be thought with thoughts and said with words is one-sided, everything one-sided, everything half, everything lacks wholeness, roundness, unity. When the sublime Gotama spoke teachingly of the world, he had to divide it into Sansara and Nirvana, into deception and truth, into suffering and salvation. One cannot do otherwise, there is no other way for those who want to teach. But the world itself, the beings around us and within us, is never one-sided. A person or an act is never completely Sansara or completely Nirvana, a person is never completely holy or completely sinful. It seems so because we are under the delusion that time is real.

"»Sehr schön sind deine Verse,« rief Kamala, »wenn ich reich wäre, gäbe ich dir Goldstücke dafür. Aber schwer wird es dir werden, mit Versen so viel Geld zu erwerben, wie du brauchst. Denn du brauchst viel Geld, wenn du Kamalas Freund sein willst.«","""Your verses are very beautiful,"" cried Kamala, ""if I were rich I would give you pieces of gold for them. But it will be difficult for you to acquire as much money with verses as you need. Because you need a lot of money if you want to be Kamala's friend.""","“Your verses are very beautiful,” cried Kamala. “If I were rich, I would give you gold pieces for them. But it will be hard for you to obtain the money you need with verses. For you will need a lot of money if you want to become Kamala’s friend.”","“How very beautiful your poetry is!” Kamala exclaimed. “If I were rich, I would give you pieces of gold for it. But it will be difficult for you to earn as much money as you need with poetry. For you will need a great deal of money if you wish to be Kamala’s friend.”"
"Siddhartha verneigte sich lächelnd. »Schade wäre es, Kamala, wie, sehr hast du Recht! Überaus schade wäre es. Nein, von deinem Munde soll mir kein Tropfen Süßigkeit verloren gehen, noch dir von dem meinen! Es bleibt also dabei: Siddhartha wird wiederkommen, wenn er hat, was ihm noch fehlt: Kleider, Schuhe, Geld. Aber sprich, holde Kamala, kannst du mir nicht noch einen kleinen Rat geben?«","Siddhartha bowed and smiled. 'It would be a pity, Kamala, you're very right! It would be a great pity. No, I shall not lose a drop of sweetness from your mouth, nor you from mine! So it stays the same: Siddhartha will come back when he has what he still lacks: clothes, shoes, money. But speak, lovely Kamala, can you not give me a little advice?'","Siddhartha bowed, smiling. “It would be too bad, Kamala, you are so right! It would really be too bad. No. Not a drop of sweetness will be lost for me from your lips or for you from mine! So it is settled. Siddhartha will come back when he has what he is lacking: clothes, shoes, money. But listen, sweet Kamala: can you give me a bit more advice?”","Siddhartha bowed to her, smiling. “A shame it would be, Kamala, how right you are! A terrible shame. No, not a single drop of your mouth’s sweetness shall go to waste, and you will taste the full sweetness of mine. Let this be our agreement: Siddhartha will come again when he has what he is presently lacking: clothes, shoes, and money. But tell me, lovely Kamala, can you not give me one more piece of advice?”"
"»Du pilgerst,« sagte Govinda. »Aber wenige pilgern in solchem Kleide, wenige in solchen Schuhen, wenige mit solchen Haaren. Nie habe ich, der ich schon viele Jahre pilgere, solch einen Pilger angetroffen.«","""You are on pilgrimage,"" said Govinda. 'But few pilgrims in such garb, few in such shoes, few with such hair. I, who have been a pilgrim for many years, have never met such a pilgrim.«","“You are pilgriming,” said Govinda. “But few pilgrim in such clothes, few in such shoes, few with such hair. Never have I met such a pilgrim though I have been pilgriming for many years.” “I believe you, my Govinda.","“You are a pilgrim,” Govinda said. “But few men embark on pilgrimages wearing such clothes, with such shoes, with such hair. Never, in all my years of pilgrimage, have I encountered such a pilgrim as you.” “I believe you, my Govinda."
"Danach setzten sie sich, es ging gegen Sonnenuntergang, auf einem Baumstamm am Ufer, und Siddhartha erzählte dem Fährmann seine Herkunft und sein Leben, wie er es heute, in jener Stunde der Verzweiflung, vor seinen Augen gesehen hatte. Bis tief in die Nacht währte sein Erzählen.","Then they sat down, towards sunset, on a tree trunk on the shore, and Siddhartha told the ferryman his origins and his life as he had seen it before his eyes today, in that hour of despair. His story lasted until late at night.","Then, as the sun was about to go down, they settled at a tree trunk on the bank, and Siddhartha told the ferryman about his background, about his life, and how today, in that hour of despair, he had seen it pass before his eyes. He talked until deep into the night.","After their meal—it was nearly twilight now—they found seats upon a tree trunk on the riverbank, and Siddhartha told the ferryman of his origins and his life, just as it had passed before his eyes today, in the hour of his despair. His story lasted deep into the night."
"Siddhartha hatte begonnen, Unzufriedenheit in sich zu nähren, Er hatte begonnen zu fühlen, dass die Liebe seines Vaters, und die Liebe seiner Mutter, und auch die Liebe seines Freundes, Govindas, nicht immer und für alle Zeit ihn beglücken, ihn stillen, ihn sättigen, ihm genügen werde. Er hatte begonnen zu ahnen, dass sein ehrwürdiger Vater und seine anderen Lehrer, dass die weisen Brahmanen ihm von ihrer Weisheit das meiste und beste schon mitgeteilt, dass sie ihre Fülle schon in sein wartendes Gefäß gegossen hätten, und das Gefäß war nicht voll, der Geist war nicht begnügt, die Seele war nicht ruhig, das Herz nicht gestillt. Die Waschungen waren gut, aber sie waren Wasser, sie wuschen nicht Sünde ab, sie heilten nicht Geistesdurst, sie lösten nicht Herzensangst. Vortrefflich waren die Opfer und die Anrufung der Götter aber war dies alles? Gaben die Opfer Glück? Und wie war das mit den Göttern? War es wirklich Prajapati, der die Welt erschaffen hat? War es nicht der Atman, Er, der Einzige, der Alleine? Waren nicht die Götter Gestaltungen, erschaffen wie ich und du, der Zeit untertan, vergänglich? War es also gut, war es richtig, war es ein sinnvolles und höchstes Tun, den Göttern zu opfern? Wem anders war zu opfern, wem anders war Verehrung darzubringen als Ihm, dem Einzigen, dem Atman? Und wo war Atman zu finden, wo wohnte Er, wo schlug Sein ewiges Herz, wo anders als im eigenen Ich, im Innersten, im Unzerstörbaren, das ein jeder in sich trug? Aber wo, wo war dies Ich, dies Innerste, dies Letzte? Es war nicht Fleisch und Bein, es war nicht Denken noch Bewusstsein, so lehrten die Weisesten. Wo, wo also war es? Dorthin zu dringen, zum Ich, zu mir, zum Atman, gab es einen andern Weg, den zu suchen sich lohnte? Ach, und niemand zeigte diesen Weg, niemand wusste ihn, nicht der Vater, nicht die Lehrer und Weisen, nicht die heiligen Opfergesänge! Alles wussten sie, die Brahmanen und ihre heiligen Bücher, alles wussten sie, um alles hatten sie sich gekümmert und um mehr als alles, die Erschaffung der Welt, das Entstehen der Rede, der Speise, des Einatmens, des Ausatmens, die Ordnungen der Sinne, die Taten der Götter unendlich vieles wussten sie – aber war es wertvoll, dies alles zu wissen, wenn man das Eine und Einzige nicht wusste, das Wichtigste, das allein Wichtige? Gewiss, viele Verse der heiligen Bücher, zumal in den Upanishaden des Samaveda, sprachen von diesem Innersten und Letzten, herrliche Verse. »Deine Seele ist die ganze Welt«, stand da geschrieben, und geschrieben stand, dass der Mensch im Schlafe, im Tiefschlaf, zu seinem Innersten eingehe und im Atman wohne. Wunderbare Weisheit stand in diesen Versen, alles Wissen der Weisesten stand hier in magischen Worten gesammelt, rein wie von Bienen gesammelter Honig. Nein, nicht gering zu achten war das Ungeheure an Erkenntnis, das hier von unzählbaren Geschlechterfolgen weiser Brahmanen gesammelt und bewahrt lag. – Aber wo waren die Brahmanen, wo die Priester, wo die Weisen oder Büßer, denen es gelungen war, dieses tiefste Wissen nicht bloß zu wissen, sondern zu leben? Wo war der Kundige, der das Daheimsein im Atman aus dem Schlafe herüberzauberte ins Wachsein, in das Leben, in Schritt und Tritt, in Wort und Tat? Viele ehrwürdige Brahmanen kannte Siddhartha, seinen Vater vor allen, den Reinen, den Gelehrten, den höchst Ehrwürdigen. Zu bewundern war sein Vater, still und edel war sein Gehaben, rein sein Leben, weise sein Wort, feine und adlige Gedanken wohnten in seiner Stirn – aber auch er, der so viel Wissende, lebte er denn in Seligkeit, hatte er Frieden, war er nicht auch nur ein Suchender, ein Dürstender? Musste er nicht immer und immer wieder an heiligen Quellen, ein Durstender, trinken, am Opfer, an den Büchern, an der Wechselrede der Brahmanen? Warum musste er, der Untadelige, jeden Tag Sünde abwaschen, jeden Tag sich um Reinigung mühen, jeden Tag von neuem? War denn nicht Atman in ihm, floss denn nicht in seinem eigenen Herzen der Urquell? Ihn musste man finden, den Urquell im eigenen Ich, ihn musste man zu eigen haben! Alles andre war Suchen, war Umweg, war Verirrung.","Siddhartha had begun to nurture dissatisfaction within himself. He had begun to feel that his father's love and his mother's love, and also the love of his friend, Govinda, would not always and for all time make him happy, still him, him satiate, will suffice for him. He had begun to suspect that his venerable father and his other teachers, that the wise Brahmans had already imparted to him most and best of their wisdom, that they had already poured their fullness into his waiting vessel, and the vessel was not full, the Spirit was not satisfied, soul was not calm, heart was not stilled. The ablutions were good, but they were water, they did not wash away sin, they did not heal thirst of the spirit, they did not loosen the anguish of the heart. Excellent were the sacrifices and the invocation of the gods, but was that all? Were the victims lucky? And what about the gods? Was it really Prajapati who created the world? Wasn't it the Atman, He, the One, the Alone? Were not the gods formations, created like me and you, subject to time, ephemeral? So was it good, was it right, was it a meaningful and supreme act to sacrifice to the gods? Whom was to be sacrificed, whom was worshiped, but to Him, the One, the Atman? And where was Atman to be found, where did He live, where did His eternal heart beat, where else than in one's own ego, in the innermost, in the indestructible that everyone carried within? But where, where was this I, this innermost, this ultimate? It was not flesh and bones, it was not thought nor consciousness, so taught the wisest. So where, where was it? To get there, to the I, to me, to the Atman, was there another way worth seeking? Oh, and nobody showed this way, nobody knew it, not the Father, not the teachers and sages, not the holy sacrificial songs! They knew everything, the Brahmans and their holy books, they knew everything, they had taken care of everything and more than everything, the creation of the world, the origin of speech, food, inhalation, exhalation, the orders of the senses , the deeds of the gods they knew infinitely many things - but was it valuable to know all this if one did not know the one and only thing, the most important thing, the only important thing? Certainly, many verses of the holy books, especially in the Upanishads of the Samaveda, spoke of this innermost and ultimate, glorious verses. ""Your soul is the whole world,"" was written there, and it was written that in sleep, in deep sleep, man enters his innermost being and dwells in the Atman. Wonderful wisdom was in these verses, all the knowledge of the wisest was here gathered in magical words, pure as honey gathered by bees. No, the tremendous amount of knowledge that lay collected and preserved here by innumerable generations of wise Brahmins should not be underestimated. – But where were the Brahmans, where were the priests, where were the wise men or penitents who had succeeded not only in knowing this deepest knowledge but in living it? Where was the expert who conjured up being at home in the Atman from sleep to wakefulness, to life, in every step, in word and deed? Siddhartha, his father above all, knew many venerable Brahmans, the pure, the learned, the most venerable. His father was to be admired, his demeanor was quiet and noble, his life pure, his word wise, fine and noble thoughts lived in his forehead – but he, too, who knew so much, if he lived in happiness, if he was at peace, was he not also just a seeker, a thirsty one? Didn't he have to drink again and again from holy springs, a thirsty one, from the sacrifice, from the books, from the exchanges of the Brahmins? Why did he, the blameless, wash away sin every day, strive for cleansing every day, every day anew? Wasn't there Atman in him, didn't the source flow in his own heart? You had to find it, the original source in your own ego, you had to own it! Everything else was a search, a detour, an error.","Siddhartha had started nursing discontent within himself. He had started feeling that his father’s love, and his mother’s love, and also his friend Govinda’s love would not make him happy forever and always, not please him, gratify him, satisfy him. He had begun to sense that his venerable father and his other teachers, that the wise Brahmins had already imparted to him the bulk and the best of their knowledge, that they had already poured their fullness into his waiting vessel, and the vessel was not full, his mind was not contented, his soul was not tranquil, his heart not sated. The ablutions were good, but they were water, they did not wash away sin, they did not slake the thirst of the mind, they did not calm the fright of the heart. Splendid were the offerings and the invokings of the gods—but was that all there was? Did the offerings bring happiness? And what about the gods? Was it really Prajapati who had created the world? Was it not Atman, he, the Only One, the All-One? Were not the gods formations, created like me and you, subject to time, ephemeral? So was it good, was it right, was it a sublime and meaningful act to sacrifice to the gods? To whom else should one sacrifice, to whom else was veneration due but to him, the Only One, Atman? And where was Atman to be found, where did he dwell, where did his eternal heart beat if not in one’s own self, in the innermost, in the indestructible essence that every person bore within? But where, where was this self, this innermost, this ultimate? It was not flesh and blood, it was not thinking or consciousness —that was what the wisest teach. But then where, where was it? To pierce there, to the self, to myself, to Atman—was there any other path worth seeking? Ah, but no one showed this path, no one knew it, not his father, not the teachers and sages, not the holy sacrificial chants! They knew everything, the Brahmins and their holy books, they knew everything, they had concerned themselves with everything and with more than everything: the creation of the world, the genesis of speech, of food, of inhaling, of exhaling, the orders of the senses, the deeds of the gods—they knew an infinite amount. But was it worthwhile knowing all this if you did not know the One and Only, the most important, the only important thing? True, many verses in the holy books, especially in the Upanishads of Sama-Veda, spoke about this innermost and ultimate—glorious verses. “Thy soul is the entire world,” they said, and it was written that in sleep, in deep sleep, a human being goes into his innermost and dwells in Atman. Wonderful wisdom was in these verses, all the wisdom of the wisest was gathered here in magical words, as pure as honey gathered by bees. No, there was no disdaining the tremendous amount of knowledge collected and preserved here by countless generations of wise Brahmins. But where were the Brahmins, where the priests, where the sages or penitents who had succeeded in not only knowing this deepest knowledge but also living it? Where was the initiate who spirited his home in Atman from sleeping to waking, to living, at every step and turn, in word and deed? Siddhartha knew many venerable Brahmins, above all his father, the pure, the learned, the supremely venerable man. Admirable was his father; still and noble was his bearing , pure was his life, wise were his words, fine and noble thoughts dwelled in his brow. But even he, the man who knew so much: did he live in bliss, was he at peace? Was he not also a seeker, a thirster? Did he not always and always again have to drink, a thirster, from the holy sources, from the sacrifices, from the books, from the dialogues of the Brahmins? Why must he, the irreproachable man, wash away sin every day, strive for purification every day, every day anew? Was Atman not in him, did not the primal source flow in his own heart? One had to find it, the primal source in one’s own self, one had to make it one’s own! Everything else was seeking, was detour, was confusion.","Siddhartha had begun to harbor discontent. He had begun to feel that his father’s love and the love of his mother, even the love of his friend Govinda, would not always and forever suffice to gladden him, content him, sate him, fulfill him. He had begun to suspect that his venerable father and his other teachers, all wise Brahmins, had already given him the richest and best part of their wisdom, had already poured their plenty into his waiting vessel, yet the vessel was not full: His mind was not content, his soul not at peace, his heart restless. The ablutions were good, but they were only water; they could not wash away sin, could not quench his mind’s thirst or dispel his heart’s fear. The sacrifices and the invocations of the gods were most excellent—but was this all? Did the sacrifices bring happiness? And what of the gods? Was it really Prajapati who had created the world? Was it not rather Atman, He, the Singular, the One and Only? Weren’t the gods mere shapes, creations like you and me, subject to time, transitory? And was it then good, was it proper, was it meaningful, a noble act, to sacrifice to the gods? To whom else should one sacrifice, to whom else show devotion, if not to Him, the Singular, Atman? And where was Atman to be found, where did He reside, where did His eternal heart lie beating? Where else but within oneself, in the innermost indestructible core each man carries inside him. But where, where was this Self, this innermost, utmost thing? It was not flesh and bone, it was not thought and not consciousness, at least according to the wise men’s teachings. Where was it then, where? To penetrate to this point, to reach the Self, oneself, Atman—could there be any other path worth seeking? Yet this was a path no one was showing him; it was a path no one knew, not his father, not the teachers and wise men, not the holy songs intoned at the sacrifices! They knew everything, these Brahmins and their holy books, everything, and they had applied themselves to everything, more than everything: to the creation of the world, the origins of speech, of food, of inhalation and exhalation; to the orders of the senses, the deeds of the gods—they knew infinitely many things—but was there value in knowing all these things without knowing the One, the Only thing, that which was important above all else, that was, indeed, the sole matter of importance? To be sure, many verses in the holy books, above all the Upanishads of the Sama-Veda, spoke of this innermost, utmost thing: splendid verses. “Your soul is the entire world” was written there, and it was written as well that in sleep, the deepest sleep, man entered the innermost core of his being and dwelt in Atman. There was glorious wisdom in these verses; all the knowledge of the wisest men was collected here in magic words, pure as the honey collected by bees. It was not to be disregarded, this massive sum of knowledge that had been collected here by countless generations of wise Brahmins. But where were the Brahmins, where the priests, where the wise men or penitents who had succeeded not merely in knowing this knowledge but in living it? Where was the master who had been able to transport his own being-at-home-in-Atman from sleep to the waking realm, to life, to all his comings and goings, his every word and deed? Siddhartha knew a great many venerable Brahmins, above all his father, a pure, learned, utterly venerable man. Worthy of admiration was his father, still and regal his bearing, his life pure, his words full of wisdom; fine and noble thoughts resided in his brow. But even he, who was possessed of such knowledge, did he dwell in bliss, did he know peace? Was not he too only a seeker, a man tormented by thirst? Was he not compelled to drink again and again from the holy springs, a thirsty man drinking in the sacrifices, the books, the dialogues of the Brahmins? Why must he, who was without blame, wash away sin day after day, labor daily to cleanse himself, each day anew? Was not Atman within him? Did not the ancient source of all springs flow within his own heart? This was what must be found, the fountainhead within one’s own being; you had to make it your own! All else was searching, detour, confusion."
"Wonne sprang in seiner Mutter Brust, wenn sie ihn sah, wenn sie ihn schreiten, wenn sie ihn niedersitzen und aufstehen sah, Siddhartha, den Starken, den Schönen, den auf schlanken Beinen Schreitenden, den mit vollkommenem Anstand sie Begrüßenden.","Delight jumped in his mother's breast when she saw him, when she walked him, when she saw him sitting down and getting up, Siddhartha, the strong, the beautiful, the one walking on slender legs, the one who greeted her with perfect decency.","Bliss leaped in his mother’s breast when she saw him, when she saw him striding, saw him sitting down and standing up— Siddhartha, the strong, the beautiful boy, striding on slender legs, greeting her with perfect breeding.","Delight leaped into his mother’s breast when she beheld him, watched him as he walked and sat and stood, Siddhartha, the strong handsome boy walking on slender legs, greeting her with flawless grace."
"Der Fährmann, erstaunt, einen so vornehmen Mann allein und zu Fuße wandern zu sehen, nahm ihn ins Boot und stieß ab.","The ferryman, astonished to see such a distinguished man walking alone and on foot, took him into the boat and pushed off.","The ferryman, astonished at seeing such a noble person wandering alone and on foot, took him into the boat and pushed off.","The ferryman, astonished to see so elegant a gentleman alone and journeying on foot, took him into the boat and pushed off from shore."
"Siddhartha erinnerte sich unterwegs auch alles dessen, was er im Garten Jetavana erlebt hatte, der Lehre, die er dort gehört, des göttlichen Buddha, des Abschiedes von Govinda, des Gespräches mit dem Erhabenen. Seiner eigenen Worte, die er zum Erhabenen gesprochen hatte, erinnerte er sich wieder, jedes Wortes, und mit Erstaunen wurde er dessen inne, dass er da Dinge gesagt hatte, die er damals noch gar nicht eigentlich wusste. Was er zu Gotama gesagt hatte: sein, des Buddha, Schatz und Geheimnis sei nicht die Lehre, sondern das Unaussprechliche und nicht Lehrbare, das er einst zur Stunde seiner Erleuchtung erlebt habe – dies war es ja eben, was zu erleben er jetzt auszog, was zu erleben er jetzt begann. Sich selbst musste er jetzt erleben. Wohl hatte er schon lange gewusst, dass sein Selbst Atman sei, vom selben ewigen Wesen wie Brahman. Aber nie hatte er dies Selbst wirklich gefunden, weil er es mit dem Netz des Gedankens hatte fangen wollen. War auch gewiss der Körper nicht das Selbst, und nicht das Spiel der Sinne, so war es doch auch das Denken nicht, nicht der Verstand, nicht die erlernte Weisheit, nicht die erlernte Kunst, Schlüsse zu ziehen und aus schon Gedachtem neue Gedanken zu spinnen. Nein, auch diese Gedankenwelt war noch diesseits, und es führte zu keinem Ziele, wenn man das zufällige Ich der Sinne tötete, dafür aber das zufällige Ich der Gedanken und Gelehrsamkeiten mästete. Beide, die Gedanken wie die Sinne, waren hübsche Dinge, hinter beiden lag der letzte Sinn verborgen, beide galt es zu hören, mit beiden zu spielen, beide weder zu verachten noch zu überschätzen, aus beiden die geheimen Stimmen des Innersten zu erlauschen. Nach nichts wollte er trachten, als wonach die Stimme ihm zu trachten beföhle, bei nichts verweilen, als wo die Stimme es riete. Warum war Gotama einst, in der Stunde der Stunden, unter dem Bo-Baume niedergesessen, wo die Erleuchtung ihn traf? Er hatte eine Stimme gehört, eine Stimme im eigenen Herzen, die ihm befahl, unter diesem Baume Rast zu suchen, und er hatte nicht Kasteiung, Opfer, Bad oder Gebet, nicht Essen noch Trinken, nicht Schlaf noch Traum vorgezogen, er hatte der Stimme gehorcht. So zu gehorchen, nicht äußerm Befehl, nur der Stimme, so bereit zu sein, das war gut, das war notwendig, nichts anderes war notwendig.","Along the way, Siddhartha also remembered everything he had experienced in the Garden of Jetavana, the teaching he had heard there, the divine Buddha, the farewell to Govinda, the conversation with the Blessed One. He remembered every word of his own words, which he had spoken to the Blessed One, and he realized with astonishment that he had said things that he didn't actually know at the time. What he had said to Gotama: his, the Buddha's treasure and secret, was not the teaching, but the unspeakable and unteachable, which he once experienced at the hour of his enlightenment - this was just what he set out to experience now, what he was about to experience. He had to experience himself now. Indeed, he had long known that his Self was Atman, of the same eternal essence as Brahman. But he had never really found this self because he had wanted to catch it in the web of thought. Even if the body was certainly not the self and not the play of the senses, neither was thinking, not the intellect, not the learned wisdom, not the learned art of drawing conclusions and spinning new thoughts from what has already been thought . No, this world of thoughts was still on this side, and it would lead to no goal if one killed the accidental ego of the senses, but instead fattened the accidental ego of thoughts and learning. Both the thoughts and the senses were pretty things, the ultimate meaning lay hidden behind both, both had to be heard, played with both, neither despised nor overestimated, the secret inner voices of both had to be heard. He would seek nothing but what the voice commanded him to seek, dwell on nothing except where the voice advised. Why was Gotama once, in the hour of hours, sat down under the Bo tree where enlightenment met him? He had heard a voice, a voice in his own heart, commanding him to rest under that tree, and he had preferred not mortification, sacrifice, bathing or prayer, eating nor drinking, sleeping nor dreaming, he had preferred the voice obeys. To obey like that, not under orders, just the voice, to be so ready, that was good, that was necessary, nothing else was necessary.","On the way Siddhartha also remembered everything he had experienced in the garden of Jetavana, he remembered the Teaching he had heard there, the divine Buddha, the parting with Govinda, the conversation with the Sublime One. He remembered his own words, which he had spoken to the Sublime One, he remembered every word, and he was amazed that he had said things he had not yet really known at the time. What he had said to Gautama—his, the Buddha’s, treasure and secret were not the Teaching, but the ineffable and unteachable that he had once experienced in the hour of his illumination —that was precisely what he was now setting out to experience, what he was now starting to experience. He now had to experience on his own. True, he had long known that his self was Atman, of the same eternal essence as Brahma. But he had never really found that self because he had tried to catch it in the net of thought. The body was certainly not the self, nor was the self the playing of the senses; but neither was thinking the self, nor the mind, nor the acquired wisdom, nor the acquired art of drawing conclusions and spinning new thoughts from earlier ones. No, even this world of thought was of this world, and it led to no goal if one killed the random ego of the senses while fattening the random ego of thinking and learning. Both thoughts and senses were pretty things; beyond them the ultimate meaning was concealed. Both had to be heard, both had to be played with, neither was to be scorned or overrated; and the secret voices of their innermost cores had to be listened to. He wished to strive for nothing but what the voice ordered him to strive for; stay with nothing but what the voice advised him to stay with. Why had Gautama once, in the hour of hours, sat down under the bo tree, where the illumination struck him? He had heard a voice, a voice in his own heart, which ordered him to seek rest under this tree, and he had not preferred castigation, sacrifice, bathing, or praying, eating or drinking, sleeping or dreaming; he had obeyed the voice. Obeying like that, not external orders, but only the voice, to be ready like that—that was good, that was necessary, nothing else was necessary.","As he walked, Siddhartha also thought back on everything he had experienced in the garden of Jetavana: the doctrine he had heard there, the divine Buddha, bidding farewell to Govinda, his conversation with the Sublime One. He thought back on the words he had spoken to the Sublime One, on each of them, and with astonishment he realized he had said things that he had not yet really known. What he had said to Gautama—that his, the Buddha’s, treasure and secret was not his doctrine but rather the inexpressible, unteachable things he had experienced in the hour of his enlightenment—was precisely what he, Siddhartha, was now setting off to experience, was now beginning to experience. It was he himself he now had to experience. To be sure, he had known for a long time that his Self was Atman, of the same eternal essence as Brahman. But never had he truly found this Self, for he had been trying to capture it with a net made of thought. While certainly body was not Self—nor was it the play of the senses— this Self was also not thought, was not mind, was not the wisdom amassed through learning, not the learned art of drawing conclusions and spinning new thoughts out of old. No, even thought was still in this world; no goal could be reached by killing off the happenstance Self of the senses while continuing to fatten the happenstance Self of thought and learnedness. Thought and senses were both fine things. Ultimate meaning lay hidden behind them; both should be listened to, played with, neither scorned nor overvalued, for in each of them the secret voice of the innermost core might be discerned. He would aspire to nothing but what this voice commanded him, occupy himself with nothing but what the voice advised. Why had Gautama once, in the hour of hours, sat down beneath the bo tree where enlightenment struck him? He had heard a voice, a voice in his own heart, commanding him to rest beneath this tree, and he had not chosen to devote himself instead to self-castigation, sacrifice, ablution, or prayer, nor to eating or drinking, nor to sleeping or dreaming; he had obeyed the voice. To obey like this, to obey not a command from the outside but only the voice, to be in readiness—this was good, this was necessary. Nothing else was necessary."
"Siddhartha trat in die Kammer, wo sein Vater auf einer Matte aus Bast saß, und trat hinter seinen Vater und blieb da stehen, bis sein Vater fühlte, dass einer hinter ihm stehe. Sprach der Brahmane: »Bist du es, Siddhartha? So sage, was zu sagen du gekommen bist.«","Siddhartha entered the room where his father was sitting on a mat made of raffia and stood behind his father and stood there until his father felt someone standing behind him.

"Noch niemals hatte Vasudeva so viele Worte gesprochen. Freundlich dankte ihm Siddhartha, ging bekümmert in die Hütte, fand lange keinen Schlaf. Vasudeva hatte ihm nichts gesagt, das er nicht selbst schon gedacht und gewusst hätte. Aber es war ein Wissen, das er nicht tun konnte, stärker als das Wissen war seine Liebe zu dem Knaben, stärker seine Zärtlichkeit, seine Angst, ihn zu verlieren. Hatte er denn jemals an irgend etwas so sehr sein Herz verloren, hatte er je irgendeinen Menschen so geliebt, so blind, so leidend, so erfolglos, und doch so glücklich?","Never before had Vasudeva spoken so many words. Siddhartha thanked him in a friendly manner, went into the hut in distress, and didn't sleep for a long time. Vasudeva had not told him anything that he had not already thought and known himself. But it was a knowledge he could not do, stronger than the knowledge was his love for the boy, stronger his tenderness, his fear of losing him.

Siddhartha thanked him in a friendly fashion, went, worried, into the hut, but found no sleep for a long time. Vasudeva had told him nothing that he himself had not already thought and known. But it was a knowledge he could not act on; stronger than his knowledge was his love for the boy, stronger his tenderness, his fear of losing him. Had he ever lost his heart so greatly, had he ever loved anyone like this, with a love so blind, so painful, so futile, and yet so happy?","Never before had Vasudeva spoken so many words at once. Siddhartha thanked him warmly, went into the hut with his heart full of worry, and for a long time could not find sleep. Vasudeva had told him nothing that he himself had not already thought and known. But it was a knowledge he could not act on; stronger than this knowledge was his love for the boy, his tenderness, his fear of losing him. Had he ever given his heart so completely to anything, had he ever loved another person so deeply, so blindly, with so much suffering, with so little success and yet so happily?"
"Da freute sich Govinda, und voll Freude rief er: »Wohl denn, so ist unser Ziel erreicht und unser Weg zu Ende! Aber sage uns, du Mutter der Pilgernden, kennst du ihn, den Buddha, hast du ihn mit deinen Augen gesehen?«","Then Govinda was happy and full of joy he called out: ""Well then, our goal has been reached and our way is over! But tell us, mother of pilgrims, do you know the Buddha, have you seen him with your eyes?”","Govinda was delighted, and joyfully he cried: “Fine, then we have reached our goal and our journey is over! But tell us, you mother of the pilgrims, do you know him, the Buddha, have you seen him with your own eyes?”","At these words, Govinda was glad and he cried out gaily, “How wonderful! Then our goal has been reached and our journey come to an end! But tell us, O mother of all pilgrims, do you know the Buddha? Have you beheld him with your own eyes?”"

"Siddhartha schenkte sein Gewand einem armen Brahmanen auf der Straße. Er trug nur noch die Schambinde und den erdfarbenen ungenähten Überwurf. Er aß nur einmal am Tage, und niemals Gekochtes. Er fastete fünfzehn Tage. Er fastete acht und zwanzig Tage. Das Fleisch schwand ihm von Schenkeln und Wangen. Heiße Träume flackerten aus seinen vergrößerten Augen, an seinen dorrenden Fingern wuchsen lang die Nägel und am Kinn der trockne, struppige Bart. Eisig wurde sein Blick, wenn er Weibern begegnete; sein Mund zuckte Verachtung, wenn er durch eine Stadt mit schön gekleideten Menschen ging. Er sah Händler handeln, Fürsten zur Jagd gehen, Leidtragende ihre Toten beweinen, Huren sich anbieten, Ärzte sich um Kranke mühen, Priester den Tag für die Aussaat bestimmen, Liebende lieben, Mütter ihre Kinder stillen – und alles war nicht den Blick seines Auges wert, alles log, alles stank, alles stank nach Lüge, alles täuschte Sinn und Glück und Schönheit vor, und alles war uneingestandene Verwesung. Bitter schmeckte die Welt. Qual war das Leben.","Siddhartha gave his robe to a poor Brahmin on the street. He wore only the pubic napkin and the earth-colored, unstitched coverall. He only ate once a day and never cooked. He fasted for fifteen days. He fasted for eight and twenty days. The flesh drained from his thighs and cheeks. Hot dreams flickered from his enlarged eyes, the nails grew long on his withering fingers and the dry, shaggy beard on his chin. His eyes became icy when he met women; his mouth twitched in contempt as he walked through a town of nicely dressed people. He saw merchants trade, princes go hunting, mourners mourn their dead, whores offer themselves, doctors tend to the sick, priests set the day for sowing, lovers make love, mothers nurse their children - and all was not worth the look of his eye , everything lied, everything stank, everything stank of lies, everything feigned meaning and happiness and beauty, and everything was unacknowledged decay. The world tasted bitter. Life was agony.","Siddhartha gave his robe away to a poor Brahmin in the street. All he now wore was the loincloth and the unstitched, earth-colored cloak.

Hot dreams flared from his enlarged eyes, the nails grew long on his withering fingers, as did, on his chin, the dry and bristly beard. His gaze grew icy when it encountered women; his mouth curled in scorn when he walked through a town with people in lovely clothes. He saw dealers dealing, princes hunting, mourners mourning their dead, whores offering themselves, doctors tending patients, priests setting the day of sowing, lovers loving, mothers nursing their babies—and everything was unworthy of his eyes, everything lied, everything stank, everything stank of lies, everything shammed meaning and happiness and beauty, and everything was unacknowledged decay.

Hot tears flickered in his enlarged eyes, the nails grew long on his withering fingers, and from his chin grew a dry, patchy beard.

Bitter was the taste of the world. Life was a torment."
"Siddhartha gab nicht Antwort. Er war wenig neugierig auf die Lehre, er glaubte nicht, dass sie ihn Neues lehren werde, hatte er doch, ebenso wie Govinda, wieder und wieder den Inhalt dieser Buddhalehre vernommen, wenn schon aus Berichten von zweiter und dritter Hand. Aber er blickte aufmerksam auf Gotamas Haupt, auf seine Schultern, auf seine Füße, auf seine still herabhängende Hand, und ihm schien, jedes Glied an jedem Finger dieser Hand war Lehre, sprach, atmete, duftete, glänzte Wahrheit. Dieser Mann, dieser Buddha, war wahrhaftig bis in die Gebärde seines letzten Fingers. Dieser Mann war heilig. Nie hatte Siddhartha einen Menschen so verehrt, nie hatte er einen Menschen so geliebt wie diesen.","Siddhartha didn't answer. He was not very curious about the teaching, he did not believe that it would teach him anything new, since he, like Govinda, had heard the content of this Buddha teaching again and again, albeit from second- and third-hand reports. But he looked attentively at Gotama's head, at his shoulders, at his feet, at his still hanging hand, and it seemed to him that every limb on every finger of this hand was teaching, spoke, breathed, smelled, shone truth. This man, this Buddha, was truthful down to the gesture of his last finger. This man was holy. Siddhartha had never honored a person so much, never loved a person as much as this one.","Siddhartha did not respond. He was not very curious about the Teaching; he did not believe it could teach him anything new; after all, he, just like Govinda, had heard the contents of the Buddha’s Teaching over and over, albeit from secondhand and thirdhand accounts. But he peered attentively at Gautama’s head, at his shoulders, at his feet, at his silently hanging hand, and it seemed as if every joint of every finger of this hand contained a Teaching, as if it spoke, breathed, shone, was scented with Truth. This man, this Buddha, was full of Truth down to the gesture of his very last finger. This man was holy. Never had Siddhartha venerated a human being so deeply, never had he loved a human being so deeply as this one.","Siddhartha gave no reply. He felt no great curiosity to hear this doctrine. He did not think it would teach him anything new; after all, he, like Govinda, had already heard the substance of the Buddha’s teachings over and over again, if only from second- and thirdhand reports. Nonetheless he scrutinized Gautama’s head, his shoulders, his feet, his quietly dangling hand, and it seemed to him that every joint of every finger on this hand was doctrine; it spoke, breathed, wafted, and glinted Truth. This man, this Buddha, was genuine down to the gestures of his littlest finger. This man was holy. Never had Siddhartha revered a man like this, never had he loved a man as he loved this one."
"»Ja,« sagte der Fährmann, »ein sehr schöner Fluss, ich liebe ihn über alles. Oft habe ich ihm zugehört, oft in seine Augen gesehen, und immer habe ich von ihm gelernt. Man kann viel von einem Flusse lernen.«","'Yes,' said the ferryman, 'a very beautiful river, I love it more than anything. I have often listened to him, often looked into his eyes, and I have always learned from him. One can learn much from a river.«","“Yes,” said the ferryman, “a very beautiful river. I love it more than anything else. I often listen to it, I often look into its eyes, I have always learned from it. One can learn a lot from a river.”","“Yes,” the ferryman said, “it is a very beautiful river. I love it above all else. Often I have listened to it, often gazed into its eyes, and always I have learned from it. You can learn a great deal from a river.”"
"»Dies ist es,« sagte Siddhartha. »Und als ich es gelernt hatte, da sah ich mein Leben an, und es war auch ein Fluss, und es war der Knabe Siddhartha vom Manne Siddhartha und vom Greis Siddhartha nur durch Schatten getrennt, nicht durch Wirkliches. Es waren auch Siddharthas frühere Geburten keine Vergangenheit, und sein Tod und seine Rückkehr zu Brahma keine Zukunft. Nichts war, nichts wird sein; alles ist, alles hat Wesen und Gegenwart.«","""This is it,"" said Siddhartha. »And when I had learned it, I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by shadows, not by reality. Siddhartha's earlier births were also not a past, and his death and his return to Brahma were not a future. Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has essence and presence.«","“That is it,” said Siddhartha. “And when I learned that, I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was separated from the adult Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha only by shadow, not by substance. Nor were Siddhartha’s earlier births the past, and his death and his return to Brahma are no future. Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has being and is present.”","“It is,” Siddhartha said. “And once I learned this I considered my life, and it too was a river, and the boy Siddhartha was separated from the man Siddhartha and the graybeard Siddhartha only by shadows, not by real things. Siddhartha’s previous lives were also not the past, and his death and his return to Brahman not the future. Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has being and presence.”"
"»Mögest du doch,« sprach Govinda, »nicht so erschreckende Worte aussprechen, Siddhartha! Wie sollte denn unter so vielen gelehrten Männern, unter so viel Brahmanen, unter so vielen strengen und ehrwürdigen Samanas, unter so viel suchenden, so viel innig beflissenen, so viel heiligen Männern keiner den Weg der Wege finden?«","""Please don't utter such frightening words,"" said Govinda, ""Siddhartha!

"»Wenn jemand sucht,« sagte Siddhartha, »dann geschieht es leicht, dass sein Auge nur noch das Ding sieht, das er sucht, dass er nichts zu finden, nichts in sich einzulassen vermag, weil er nur immer an das Gesuchte denkt, weil er ein Ziel hat, weil er vom Ziel besessen ist. Suchen heißt: ein Ziel haben. Finden aber heißt: frei sein, offen stehen, kein Ziel haben. Du, Ehrwürdiger, bist vielleicht in der Tat ein Sucher, denn, deinem Ziel nachstrebend, siehst du manches nicht, was nah vor deinen Augen steht.«","»When someone searches,« said Siddhartha, »then it easily happens that his eye only sees the thing he is looking for, that he cannot find anything, is unable to let anything into himself, because he only ever thinks of what he is looking for, because he has a goal because he is obsessed with the goal.

You, venerable one, are perhaps indeed a seeker, for in pursuing your goal you do not see much that is near before your eyes.”","“When someone seeks,” said Siddhartha, “then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing because he always thinks only about the thing he is seeking, because he has one goal, because he is obsessed with his goal.

You, Venerable One, may truly be a seeker, for, in striving toward your goal, you fail to see certain things that are right under your nose.”","“When a person seeks,” Siddhartha said, “it can easily happen that his eye sees only the thing he is seeking; he is incapable of finding anything, of allowing anything to enter into him, because he is always thinking only of what he is looking for, because he has a goal, because he is possessed by his goal. Seeking means having a goal. Finding means being free, being open, having no goal.

"Da lachte Siddhartha, auf seine Weise, wobei der Ton seiner Stimme einen Schatten von Trauer und einen Schatten von Spott annahm, und sagte: »Wohl, Govinda, wohl hast du gesprochen, richtig hast du dich erinnert.

"Tief war sein Schlaf und frei von Träumen, seit langer Zeit hatte er einen solchen Schlaf nicht mehr gekannt. Als er nach manchen Stunden erwachte, war ihm, als seien zehn Jahre vergangen, er hörte das leise Strömen des Wassers, wusste nicht, wo er sei und wer ihn hierher gebracht habe, schlug die Augen auf, sah mit Verwunderung Bäume und Himmel über sich, und erinnerte sich, wo er wäre und wie er hierher gekommen sei. Doch bedurfte er hierzu einer langen Weile, und das Vergangene erschien ihm wie von einem Schleier überzogen, unendlich fern, unendlich weit weg gelegen, unendlich gleichgültig. Er wusste nur, dass er sein früheres Leben (im ersten Augenblick der Besinnung erschien ihm dies frühere Leben wie eine weit zurückliegende, einstige Verkörperung, wie eine frühe Vorgeburt seines jetzigen Ich) – dass er sein früheres Leben verlassen habe, dass er voll Ekel und Elend sogar sein Leben habe wegwerfen wollen, dass er aber an einem Flusse, unter einem Kokosbaume, zu sich gekommen sei, das heilige Wort Om auf den Lippen, dann entschlummert sei, und nun erwacht als ein neuer Mensch in die Welt blicke. Leise sprach er das Wort Om vor sich hin, über welchem er eingeschlafen war, und ihm schien sein ganzer langer Schlaf sei nichts als ein langes, versunkenes Om-Sprechen gewesen, ein Om-Denken, ein Untertauchen und völliges Eingehen in Om, in das Namenlose, Vollendete.","His sleep was deep and free from dreams, he hadn't known such a sleep for a long time.

But it took him a long time to do this, and the past seemed to him as if covered by a veil, infinitely far away, infinitely far away, infinitely indifferent.

Kamaswami told him about his business, he showed him wares and warehouses, showed him accounts. Siddhartha learned a lot of new things, he heard much and said little. And mindful of Kamala’s words, he never submitted to the merchant, he forced him to treat Siddhartha as his peer, indeed more than his peer. Kamaswami conducted his business with care and often with passion, but Siddhartha treated it all as a game, whose rules he strove to learn precisely, but whose content did not touch his heart.","Siddhartha thanked him and accepted, and now he was living in the home of the tradesman. Clothing was brought to him, and shoes, and a servant prepared a bath for him daily. Twice a day an opulent meal was served, but Siddhartha ate only once a day, and he neither ate meat nor drank wine. Kamaswami told him of his trading, showed him goods and storerooms, showed him his accounts, and Siddhartha learned many new things. He listened much and spoke little and, mindful of Kamala ’s words, he never behaved subserviently toward the merchant. Instead, he compelled him to treat him as an equal: indeed, as more than an equal. Kamaswami pursued his business with solicitousness, even with passion, but Siddhartha saw it all as a game whose rules he was striving to learn but whose substance did not touch his heart."
"Als Siddhartha den Hain verließ, in welchem der Buddha, der Vollendete, zurückblieb, in welchem Govinda zurückblieb, da fühlte er, dass in diesem Hain auch sein bisheriges Leben hinter ihm zurückblieb und sich von ihm trennte. Dieser Empfindung, die ihn ganz erfüllte, sann er im langsamen Dahingehen nach. Tief sann er nach, wie durch ein tiefes Wasser ließ er sich bis auf den Boden dieser Empfindung hinab, bis dahin, wo die Ursachen ruhen, denn Ursachen erkennen, so schien ihm, das eben ist Denken, und dadurch allein werden Empfindungen zu Erkenntnissen und gehen nicht verloren, sondern werden wesenhaft und beginnen auszustrahlen, was in ihnen ist.","When Siddhartha left the grove in which the Buddha, the perfected one, stayed behind, in which Govinda stayed behind, he felt that in this grove his previous life also lagged behind him and separated from him. He meditated on this feeling, which filled him completely, as he walked slowly along. He pondered deeply, as if through deep water, he lowered himself to the bottom of this feeling, to the point where the causes rest, for recognizing causes, it seemed to him, is just thinking, and only through this can feelings become cognitions and do not get lost, but become substantial and begin to radiate what is within them.","When he left the grove, where the Buddha, the Perfect One, remained, where Govinda remained, Siddhartha felt that his previous life too was remaining behind in this grove and separating from him. This sensation filled him fully, and he mused about it as he slowly walked away. He mused deeply, descending to the very bottom of this sensation as if through deep water, all the way down to where the causes rest. For, it seemed to him, thinking is recognizing causes, and that is the only way in which sensations become insights: they are not lost, they become substance and begin to radiate what is within them.","When Siddhartha left the grove in which the Buddha, the Perfect One, remained behind, in which Govinda remained behind, he felt that his former life, too, was remaining behind him in this grove. Immersed in deep contemplation of this feeling, which had taken hold of him completely, he walked slowly away, allowing himself to sink to the bottom of this feeling as if through deep water, down to where the causes lay. Recognizing the causes, it seemed to him, was just what thought was; it was only in this way that feelings gave rise to insights and, rather than being lost, took on substance and began to radiate what was within them."
"Siehe, da trat auch Govinda hervor, der Schüchterne, und sprach: »Auch ich nehme meine Zuflucht zum Erhabenen und zu seiner Lehre,« und bat um Aufnahme in die Jüngerschaft, und ward aufgenommen.","Behold, Govinda, the shy one, also stepped forward and said: ""I too take refuge in the Blessed One and in his teaching,"" and asked to be accepted into the discipleship, and was accepted.","Lo, now Govinda also stepped forward, the shy youth, and said, “I too take refuge with the Sublime One and his Teaching,” and asked to be accepted into the fellowship of the disciples, and was accepted.","And lo! Govinda too stepped forward, shy Govinda, and said, “I too take refuge in the Sublime One and his doctrine,” and asked that he be taken in as a disciple, and he was taken in."
