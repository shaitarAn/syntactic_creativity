"»Na, wenn's der Herr eh weiß. Aber mir sein g'sund, Gott sei Dank«, rief sie fröhlich aus und trat ganz nahe an Fridolin heran mit halbgeöffneten Lippen und einem frechen Zurückwerfen ihres üppigen Leibes, so daß der Bademantel sich öffnete. Fridolin sagte ablehnend: »Ich bin nur im Vorbeigehen heraufgekommen, um der Mizzi was zu bringen«, und er erschien sich plötzlich wie ein Gymnasiast. Und in einem neuen, sachlichen Ton fragte er: »Auf welcher Abteilung liegt sie denn?«","“Well, if the gentleman knows anyway. But I'm fine, thank God,' she exclaimed happily and came very close to Fridolin with half-open lips and a cheeky throwing back of her voluptuous body so that the bathrobe fell open. Fridolin said in disapproval: ""I just came up in passing to bring something for Mizzi,"" and he suddenly seemed like a high school student. And in a new, matter-of-fact tone he asked: ""Which department is she in?""","‘Well, if you already know, sir! But I’m quite healthy, thank God,’ she protested gaily and came up close to Fridolin with half-open lips, thrusting her opulent body back cheekily, so that her dressing-gown fell open. ‘I just came up as I was passing to give something to Mizzi,’ said Fridolin evasively, and suddenly he felt like a schoolboy. Then, in an altered, matter-of-fact tone, he asked, ‘Which clinic is she in?’","""Well, as long as you know it anyhow. But there's nothing wrong with me, thank heaven,"" she exclaimed vivaciously and stepped quite close to Fridolin. Her lips were half open, and as she boldly drew up her voluptuous body the bath-robe parted. Fridolin declined and said: ""I was passing by and I stopped to bring something for Mizzi."" He suddenly felt very young, but asked in a matter-of-fact voice: ""In which ward is she?"""
"Der Diener antwortete mit einer Handbewegung so wenig bedientenhafter Art, daß sie jeden Widerspruch ausschloß. Der Zylinder des Kutschers ragte lächerlich lang in die Nacht auf. Der Wind blies heftig, über den Himmel hin flogen violette Wolken. Fridolin konnte sich nach seinen bisherigen Erlebnissen nicht darüber täuschen, daß ihm nichts übrigblieb, als in den Wagen zu steigen, der sich auch mit ihm unverzüglich in Bewegung setzte.","The servant replied with a hand gesture so unservile that it ruled out any contradiction. The coachman's top hat loomed ridiculously long in the night. The wind blew fiercely, purple clouds flew across the sky. Based on what he had experienced so far, Fridolin could not have fooled himself that there was nothing left to do but get into the car, which immediately set off with him.","The servant replied with a gesture which, far from being servile, clearly brooked no opposition. In the gloom the coachman’s top hat seemed to loom absurdly tall. The wind was blowing briskly and violet clouds were racing across the sky. After all his adventures thus far, Fridolin could not delude himself that he had any choice but to get into the carriage, and it promptly moved off.","The man replied with a wave of his hand which was anything but servant-like, so that objection was out of the question. The ridiculously high silk hat of the coachman towered up into the night. The wind was blowing a gale; violet clouds raced across the sky. Fridolin felt that, after his previous experience, there was nothing for him to do but to get into the carriage. It started the moment he was inside."
"Sie hörte kaum, was er sagte. Ihre Augen wurden feucht, große Tränen liefen ihr über die Wangen herab, und wieder verbarg sie ihr Gesicht in den Händen. Unwillkürlich legte er seine Hand auf ihren Scheitel und strich ihr über die Stirn. Er fühlte, wie ihr Körper zu zittern begann, sie schluchzte in sich hinein, kaum hörbar zuerst, allmählich lauter, endlich ganz ungehemmt. Mit einemmal war sie vom Sessel herabgeglitten, lag Fridolin zu Füßen, umschlang seine Knie mit den Armen und preßte ihr Antlitz daran. Dann sah sie zu ihm auf mit weit offenen, schmerzlich-wilden Augen und flüsterte heiß: »Ich will nicht fort von hier. Auch wenn Sie niemals wiederkommen, wenn ich Sie niemals mehr sehen soll; ich will in Ihrer Nähe leben.«","She barely heard what he said. Her eyes grew moist, large tears ran down her cheeks, and again she buried her face in her hands. Involuntarily he put his hand on the top of her head and stroked her forehead. He felt her body begin to tremble, she sobbed to herself, barely audibly at first, gradually louder, finally completely uninhibited. Suddenly she slipped down from the chair, lay at Fridolin's feet, wrapped her arms around his knees and pressed her face against them. Then she looked up at him with wide open, achingly wild eyes and whispered hotly, 'I don't want to leave here. Even if you never come back, if you never want me to see you again; I want to live near you.""","She hardly heard what he was saying. Her eyes grew moist, large tears rolled down her cheeks and again she buried her face in her hands. Involuntarily he stretched out his hand and stroked her forehead. He felt her whole body tremble as she began to sob, almost inaudibly at first, then gradually louder and finally without restraint. Suddenly she slipped out of the armchair, prostrated herself at his feet, flung her arms around his knees and pressed her face against them. Then she looked up at him with wide open, wild, agonized eyes and whispered fervently, ‘I don’t want to leave here. Even if you never came again, and I were never to see you any more, I would still want to live close by you.’","She hardly heard what he said. Her eyes became moist, large tears streamed down her cheeks and again she buried her face in her hands. In spite of himself, he placed his hand on her head, caressing it. He could feel her body beginning to tremble, and her sobs which were at first very quiet, gradually became louder and finally quite unrestrained. All at once she slipped down from her chair and lay at Fridolin's feet, clasping his knees with her arms and pressing her face against them. Then she looked up to him with large eyes, wild with grief, and whispered ardently: ""I don't want to leave here. Even if you never return, if I am never to see you again, I want, at least, to live near you."""
"»Ach so«, bemerkte Fridolin mit einem verächtlichen Zucken der Mundwinkel und mit einem bitteren Geschmack auf der Zunge.","""Oh,"" remarked Fridolin with a contemptuous twitch of the corners of his mouth and a bitter taste on his tongue.","‘I see,’ remarked Fridolin with a sneer of contempt and a bitter taste in his mouth.","""Oh, that's how it is,"" remarked Fridolin with a contemptuous twitch of his mouth and a bitter taste on his tongue."
»Du hast dir also richtig ein Kostüm verschafft?«,"""So you got yourself a proper costume?""",‘So you’ve really managed to get yourself fitted out?’,"""Then you did manage to get a costume?"""
Fridolin schüttelte wieder den Kopf. »Es handelt sich um keine – dienstliche Angelegenheit.«,"Fridolin shook his head again. ""It's not a - business matter.""",Fridolin shook his head again. ‘It’s not a – professional matter.’,"Fridolin again shook his head. ""My visit has nothing to do with—official matters."""
"Er war mehr ergriffen als erstaunt; denn er hatte es immer gewußt, daß sie in ihn verliebt war oder sich einbildete, es zu sein.","He was more moved than amazed; for he had always known that she was, or fancied herself, in love with him.","He was more moved than astonished; for he had always known that she was in love with him, or imagined that she was.","He was touched rather than surprised, for he had always known that she either was, or imagined herself to be, in love with him."
»Und die zwei Herren?« fragte Fridolin scharf und kam sich selbst vor wie ein Geheimpolizist.,"""And the two gentlemen?"" asked Fridolin sharply and felt like a secret policeman himself.","‘And the two gentlemen?’ asked Fridolin, feeling like someone from the secret police.","""And the two men?"" asked Fridolin, rather sharply. He felt like a detective."
"Irgendein Arm griff plötzlich nach seinem Gesicht, wie um ihm die Maske herunterzureißen, als plötzlich die eine Tür sich auftat und eine der Frauen – Fridolin konnte sich nicht im Zweifel darüber befinden, welche es war – dastand, in Nonnentracht, so wie er sie zuerst erblickt hatte. Hinter ihr aber in dem überhellten Raum waren die andern zu sehen, nackt mit verhüllten Gesichtern, aneinandergedrängt, stumm, eine verschüchterte Schar. Doch die Türe schloß sich sofort wieder.","One arm suddenly grabbed his face as if to rip off his mask, when suddenly one of the doors opened and one of the women—Fridolin could not be in any doubt which it was—stood there, in nun's habit, just as he had done at first had seen. But behind her in the overlit room the others could be seen, naked with covered faces, huddled together, mute, a timid crowd. But the door immediately closed again.","An arm suddenly snatched at his face, as if to tear off the mask, when all at once a door opened and a woman – Fridolin had no doubt who it was – stood there, in the habit of a nun, just as when he had first seen her. Behind her in the brilliantly lit room he could see the others, naked with their faces hidden, huddled together, silent, an intimidated group. But the door closed again immediately.","A hand suddenly reached out, as if to tear off the mask, when a door suddenly opened and one of the women— Fridolin did not doubt which one it was—stood there, dressed as a nun, as he had first seen her. The others could be seen behind her in the brilliantly lighted room, naked, with veiled faces, crowding together in a terrified group. The door at once closed again."
"Eines der herumstreifenden Mädchen forderte ihn zum Mitgehen auf. Es war ein zierliches, noch ganz junges Geschöpf, sehr blaß mit rotgeschminkten Lippen. Könnte gleichfalls mit Tod enden, dachte er, nur nicht so rasch! Auch Feigheit? Im Grunde schon. Er hörte ihre Schritte, bald ihre Stimme hinter sich. »Willst nicht mitkommen, Doktor?«","One of the roaming girls asked him to go with him. It was a dainty creature, still very young, very pale with red lips. Might as well end in death, he thought, just not so soon! Also cowardice? Basically yes. He heard her footsteps, soon her voice behind him. ""Don't you want to come with me, Doctor?""","One of the strolling girls was on the point of propositioning him. She was a pretty creature, still quite young but very pale with lips painted red. This could also end in death, he thought, only not quite so quickly! Cowardice again? Basically, yes. He heard her steps and then her voice behind him. ‘Won’t you come with me, doctor?’","One of the girls wandering about stopped him. She was still a young and pretty little thing, very pale with red-painted lips. She also might lead to a fatal end, only not as quickly, he thought. Is this cowardice too? I suppose really it is. He heard her steps and then her voice behind him. ""Won't you come with me, doctor?"""
"Und wieder fiel ihm ein, daß er möglicherweise schon den Keim einer Todeskrankheit im Leibe trug. Wäre es nicht zu albern, daran zu sterben, daß einem ein diphtheriekrankes Kind ins Gesicht gehustet hatte? Vielleicht war er schon krank. Hatte er nicht Fieber? Lag er in diesem Augenblick nicht daheim zu Bett – und all das, was er erlebt zu haben glaubte, waren nichts als Delirien gewesen?!",And again it occurred to him that he might already be carrying the germ of a terminal illness in his body. Wouldn't it be too silly to die because a child with diphtheria coughed in your face? Maybe he was already ill. Didn't he have a fever? Wasn't he at home in bed at that moment - and everything he thought he had experienced was nothing but delirium?!,And again it crossed his mind that his body might already be carrying the seed of some fatal disease. Wouldn’t it be absurd to die because a child infected with diphtheria had coughed in one’s face? Perhaps he was already sick. Didn’t he have a fever? Wasn’t he perhaps lying at home in bed this very moment – and hadn’t everything he believed he had experienced been nothing more than his delirium?,Again the thought came to him that even now the germ of a fatal disease might be in his body. Wouldn't it be silly to die just because a child with diphtheria had coughed in his face? Perhaps he was already ill. Wasn't he feverish? Perhaps at this moment he was lying at home in bed—and everything he thought he had experienced was merely delirium?
"Fridolin fand sich allein, und diese plötzliche Verlassenheit überfiel ihn wie Frost. Er sah um sich. In diesem Augenblick schien sich niemand um ihn zu kümmern. Vielleicht war jetzt noch eine letzte Möglichkeit, sich ungestraft zu entfernen. Was ihn trotzdem in seine Ecke gebannt hielt, wo er sich nun ungesehen und unbeachtet fühlen durfte – die Scheu vor einem ruhmlosen und etwas lächerlichen Rückzug, das ungestillte, quälende Verlangen nach dem wundersamen Frauenleib, dessen Duft noch um ihn strich; oder die Erwägung, daß alles, was bisher geschehen, vielleicht eine Prüfung seines Muts bedeutet hätte und daß ihm die herrliche Frau als Preis zufallen würde – das wußte er selbst nicht. Jedenfalls aber war ihm klar, daß diese Spannung nicht länger zu ertragen war und daß er auf alle Gefahr hin diesem Zustand ein Ende machen mußte. Wozu immer er sich entschlösse, das Leben konnte es nicht kosten. Er befand sich vielleicht unter Narren, vielleicht unter Wüstlingen, gewiß nicht unter Buben oder Verbrechern. Und es kam ihm der Einfall, unter sie hinzutreten, sich selbst als Eindringling zu bekennen und sich ihnen in ritterlicher Weise zur Verfügung zu stellen. Nur in solcher Art, wie mit einem edeln Akkord, durfte diese Nacht abschließen, wenn sie mehr bedeuten sollte als ein schattenhaft wüstes Nacheinander von düsteren, trübseligen, skurrilen und lüsternen Abenteuern, deren doch keines zu Ende gelebt worden war. Und aufatmend machte er sich bereit.","Fridolin found himself alone, and this sudden loneliness overcame him like frost. He looked around. At that moment no one seemed to care about him. Perhaps now was a last chance to escape with impunity. What still kept him banished to his corner, where he could now feel unseen and unappreciated - the dread of an inglorious and somewhat ridiculous retreat, the unquenched, tormenting longing for the wondrous woman's body whose scent still lingered about him; or the consideration that everything that had happened hitherto might have been a test of his courage, and that the glorious woman would be his prize—he did not know that himself. In any case, it was clear to him that this tension could no longer be endured and that he must put an end to this state of affairs at all costs. Whatever he decided to do, life couldn't cost it. He was perhaps among fools, perhaps among libertines, certainly not among boys or criminals. And it occurred to him that he should go among them, profess himself an intruder, and put himself at their disposal in a chivalrous manner. This night could only end in such a way as with a noble chord, if it was to mean more than a shadowy, deserted succession of gloomy, gloomy, bizarre and lustful adventures, none of which had been lived to the end. And he got ready with a sigh of relief.","Now Fridolin found himself alone, and this sudden abandonment descended on him like a frost. He looked around. For the moment no one seemed in the least concerned about him. Perhaps there was still one last chance that he might escape unpunished. What it was that despite this held him spellbound in his corner, invisible and unobserved – whether it was fear of an ignoble and somewhat ridiculous retreat, or the torment of unsatisfied longing for the mysterious woman’s body, whose fragrance still caressed him, or the notion that everything he had seen so far might have been meant to test his courage, and that the gorgeous woman would fall to him as his reward – he did not rightly know himself. At all events, it was clear to him that this suspense was no longer tolerable, and that no matter what the danger he must bring the situation to a head. Whatever he decided, it could scarcely be a matter of life and death. He might be among fools and perhaps even among profligates, but certainly not among criminals and thugs. And the thought occurred to him that he might go over and join them, acknowledge that he was an intruder, and place himself chivalrously at their disposal. This seemed the only possible way to end the night, with an honourable understanding, as it were – if, that is, it were to be anything more than a barren, shadowy succession of dreary, lurid and scurrilous libidinous adventures, none of which had been pursued to the end. And with a deep breath he prepared himself.","A sudden feeling of solitude made Fridolin shiver as if with cold. He looked about him. Nobody seemed to be paying any attention to him. This was perhaps his last chance to leave with impunity. He didn't know, however, why it was that he remained spell-bound in his corner where he now felt sure that he was not observed. It might be his aversion to an inglorious and perhaps ridiculous retreat, or the excruciating ungratified desire for the beautiful woman whose fragrance was still in his nostrils. Or he may have stayed because he vaguely hoped that all that had happened so far was intended as a test of his courage and that this magnificent woman would be his reward. It was clear at any rate that the strain was too great to be endured, and that, no matter what the danger, he would have to end it. It could hardly cost him his life, no matter what he decided. He might be among fools, or libertines, but certainly not among rascals or criminals. The thought occurred to him to acknowledge himself as an intruder and to place himself at their disposal in chivalrous fashion. This night could only conclude in such a manner,—with a harmonious finale, as it were—if it were to mean more than a wild, shadow-like succession of gloomy and lascivious adventures, all without an end. So, taking a deep breath, he prepared to carry out his plan."
Fridolin schwieg.,Fridolin said nothing.,Fridolin said nothing.,""" Fridolin was silent."
"Ein paar Minuten darauf war er im Krankensaal. Der Chefarzt hatte melden lassen, daß er eines Konsiliums wegen plötzlich habe verreisen müssen, die Herren Assistenten möchten ohne ihn Visite machen. Fridolin fühlte sich beinahe glücklich, als er, von den Studenten gefolgt, von Bett zu Bett ging, Untersuchungen vornahm, Rezepte schrieb, mit Hilfsärzten und Wärterinnen sich fachlich besprach. Es gab allerlei Neuigkeiten. Der Schlossergeselle Karl Rödel war in der Nacht gestorben. Sektion nachmittag halb fünf. Im Weibersaal war ein Bett frei geworden, aber schon wieder belegt. Die Frau von Bett siebzehn hatte man auf die chirurgische Abteilung transferieren müssen. Zwischendurch wurden auch Personalfragen berührt. Die Neubesetzung der Augenabteilung sollte übermorgen entschieden werden; Hügelmann, jetzt Professor in Marburg, vor vier Jahren noch zweiter Assistent bei Stellwag, hatte die meisten Chancen. Rasche Karriere, dachte Fridolin. Ich werde nie für die Leitung einer Abteilung in Betracht kommen, schon weil mir die Dozentur fehlt. Zu spät. Warum eigentlich? Man müßte eben wieder wissenschaftlich zu arbeiten anfangen oder manches Begonnene mit größerem Ernst wieder aufnehmen. Die Privatpraxis ließ immer noch Zeit genug.","A few minutes later he was in the hospital ward. The chief physician had sent word that he had suddenly had to leave for a consultation, the assistants would like to make rounds without him. Fridolin felt almost happy as, followed by the students, he went from bed to bed, carried out examinations, wrote prescriptions and discussed technical matters with the assistant doctors and nurses. There was all sorts of news. The journeyman locksmith Karl Rödel had died in the night. Section half past four in the afternoon. A bed had become free in the women's room, but it was already occupied again. The woman from bed seventeen had had to be transferred to the surgical department. In between, personnel issues were also touched upon. The replacement of the eye department should be decided the day after tomorrow; Hügelmann, now a professor in Marburg and four years ago a second assistant at Stellwag, had the most chances. Rapid career, thought Fridolin. I will never be considered for the management of a department, if only because I don't have a lectureship. Too late. Why actually? One would have to start working scientifically again, or take up some of what was started with more seriousness. Private practice still left plenty of time.","A few minutes later he was on the ward. The head physician had left word that he had been suddenly called away for a consultation, and his colleagues were to do the rounds without him. Fridolin felt almost happy as he went from bed to bed followed by the students, examining patients, writing prescriptions and consulting professionally with registrars and nurses. There were all sorts of new developments. The locksmith Karl Rödel had died during the night. The post-mortem was at five that afternoon. In the women’s ward a bed had become vacant, but had already been filled. The woman from bed no. 17 had had to be transferred for surgery. Now and then questions to do with personnel were touched on too. The new director of the clinic was to be appointed the day after tomorrow; Hügelmann, who was currently a professor at Marburg and four years ago had still only been Stellwag’s second assistant, had the best chance. A rapid career, thought Fridolin. I shall never be considered for the headship of a department, because I don’t have my dissertation in hand. Too late. But how so? One would have to start doing research again, or pick up work already embarked on much more seriously. Private practice did still leave one enough free time.","A few minutes later he was in the ward. The physician in charge had suddenly sent word that he had to leave the city for a conference, and that the assistants should make the rounds without him. Fridolin felt almost happy as he walked from bed to bed, followed by the students, making examinations, writing prescriptions, and having professional conversations with the assistants and nurses. Various changes had taken place. The journeyman-locksmith, Karl Rodel, had died during the night and the autopsy was to take place at half past four in the afternoon. A bed had become vacant in the woman's ward, but was again occupied. The woman in bed seventeen had had to be transferred to the surgical division. Besides this, there was a lot of personal gossip. The appointment of a man for the ophthalmology division would be decided day after tomorrow. Hiigelmann, at present professor at the University of Marburg, had the best chances, although four years ago he had been merely a second assistant to Stellwag. That's quick promotion, thought Fridolin. I'll never be considered for the headship of a department, if for no other reason than that I've never been a Dozent. It's too late. But why should it be? I really ought to begin again to do scientific work or take up more seriously some of the things that I have already started. My private practice would leave me ample time for it."
"»Oh, lieber Kollege«, begrüßte ihn Doktor Adler immer noch etwas unwillig, aber zugleich verwundert, »was verschafft mir die Ehre zu so ungewohnter Stunde?«","""Oh, dear colleague,"" Doctor Adler greeted him, still a little unwilling but at the same time surprised, ""what gives me the honor at such an unusual hour?""","‘Ah, my dear colleague,’ said Dr Adler, still a little reluctantly but also with surprise, ‘to what do I owe the honour at such an unusual hour?’","""Oh, it's you,"" he said to Fridolin, a little annoyed, but also surprised, ""to what do I owe the honor of your visit at such an unaccustomed hour?"""
"Fridolin dankte für die Auskunft, entfernte sich ziemlich rasch, da einer der eben hinzugetretenen Hoteldirektoren ihn mit unangenehmer Neugier zu mustern begann, stieg wieder in den Wagen und ließ sich zum Krankenhaus fahren. Wenige Minuten später, in der Aufnahmekanzlei, erfuhr er nicht nur, daß die angebliche Baronin Dubieski auf die zweite interne Klinik eingeliefert worden, sondern daß sie nachmittags um fünf, trotz aller ärztlichen Bemühungen – ohne das Bewußtsein wiedererlangt zu haben – gestorben war.","Fridolin thanked him for the information, left rather quickly, since one of the hotel managers who had just arrived began to examine him with unpleasant curiosity, got back in the car and had himself driven to the hospital.

"Es war vier Uhr morgens, als er die Treppe zu seiner Wohnung hinaufschritt. Er begab sich vor allem in sein Sprechzimmer, verschloß das Maskengewand sorgfältig in einen Schrank, und da er es vermeiden wollte, Albertine zu wecken, legte er Schuhe und Kleider ab, noch ehe er ins Schlafzimmer trat. Vorsichtig schaltete er das gedämpfte Licht seiner Nachttischlampe ein. Albertine lag ruhig, die Arme im Nacken verschlungen, ihre Lippen waren halb geöffnet, schmerzliche Schatten zogen rings um sie; es war ein Antlitz, das Fridolin nicht kannte. Er beugte sich über ihre Stirne, die sich sofort, wie unter einer Berührung, in Falten legte, ihre Mienen verzerrten sich sonderbar; und plötzlich, immer noch im Schlafe, lachte sie so schrill auf, daß Fridolin erschrak. Unwillkürlich rief er sie beim Namen. Sie lachte von neuem, wie zur Antwort, in einer völlig fremden, fast unheimlichen Weise. Nochmals und lauter rief Fridolin sie an. Nun öffnete sie die Augen, langsam, mühselig, groß, blickte ihn starr an, als erkenne sie ihn nicht.","It was four in the morning when he climbed the stairs to his apartment. First of all, he went to his consulting room, carefully locked the masked robe in a cupboard, and, not wanting to wake Albertine, he took off his shoes and clothes before going into the bedroom. He carefully switched on the dim light of his bedside lamp. Albertine lay quietly, her arms clasped behind her neck, her lips parted, painful shadows passed around her; it was a face that Fridolin did not know. He bent over her forehead, which immediately wrinkled as if touched, and her expression became strangely contorted; and suddenly, still asleep, she laughed so shrillly that Fridolin was startled. Involuntarily he called her by name. She laughed again, as if in reply, in a completely strange, almost uncanny way. Fridolin called her again and louder. Now she opened her eyes, slowly, laboriously, wide, stared at him as if she didn't recognize him.","It was four in the morning as he climbed the stairs to his apartment. The first thing he did was to go into his consulting-room and lock the mask and habit carefully away in a cupboard, and, as he wanted to avoid waking Albertine, took his shoes and clothes off before entering the bedroom. Carefully he turned up his bedside lamp. Albertine was lying quite still, her arms behind her neck, her half-open lips distressingly contorted by the play of shadows: it was a face unknown to Fridolin. He bent over her brow, which puckered at once as if in response to being touched, while her features became curiously distorted; then suddenly she laughed out loud so shrilly in her sleep that Fridolin was startled. Involuntarily he called out to her by name. As if in response, she laughed again in an utterly alien, almost uncanny manner. Fridolin called out to her more loudly.

"Fridolin fuhr sofort in das bezeichnete Hotel und erhielt dort die Auskunft, daß die Baronin D. unverzüglich nach ihrer Auffindung ins Allgemeine Krankenhaus geschafft worden sei. Fridolin erkundigte sich, auf welche Weise die Entdeckung des Selbstmordversuches erfolgt sei. Was für Anlaß denn vorgelegen habe, sich schon um die Mittagsstunde um eine Dame zu kümmern, die doch erst um vier Uhr früh nach Hause gekommen war? Nun, das war ganz einfach: zwei Herren (also wieder zwei Herren!) hatten vormittags um elf Uhr nach ihr gefragt. Da die Dame sich auf wiederholten telephonischen Anruf nicht gemeldet, hatte das Stubenmädchen an die Türe geklopft; da sich darauf wieder nichts gerührt hatte und die Türe von innen verriegelt blieb, war nichts übriggeblieben, als sie aufzusprengen, und da hatte man die Baronin bewußtlos im Bette liegend gefunden. Man hatte sofort Rettungsgesellschaft und Polizei verständigt.","Fridolin immediately drove to the designated hotel and was informed there that Baroness D. had been taken to the general hospital immediately after she was found. Fridolin inquired how the suicide attempt had been discovered. What reason had there been to look after a lady at noon who had only come home at four in the morning? Well, that was very simple: two gentlemen (ie two gentlemen again!) had asked for her at eleven o'clock in the morning. As the lady did not respond to repeated telephone calls, the chambermaid knocked on the door; since after that nothing had stirred and the door remained bolted from the inside, there was nothing to do but force it open, and the baroness was found lying unconscious in bed. The rescue company and the police were immediately notified.","Fridolin drove at once to the hotel in question, and there received the news that Baroness D. had been rushed to the General Hospital as soon as she had been discovered. Fridolin asked how the suicide attempt had come to light. What had caused them to become concerned at noon about a lady who had not arrived home until four that morning? That was simple enough: two gentlemen (again two gentlemen!) had asked for her at about eleven o’clock. As the lady had not responded to repeated telephone calls, the chambermaid had knocked on her door; since there was still no response and the door was locked from within, they had had no choice but to break it open, and had found the Baroness lying in bed unconscious.","Fridolin at once went there and found that Baroness D. had been taken to the General Hospital immediately after they found her.

In der Tiefe seiner Seele war er doch fertig mit ihr, wie immer das äußere Leben weitergehen sollte. Die blonde Schwester half ihm aus den Ärmeln seines Rocks und reichte ihm den weißen Ärztekittel.

"»Du gehst mir voran«, sagte Gibiser zu der Kleinen und wies gebieterisch zur Treppe. Pierrette wandte sich um, blickte zum Ende des Gangs und winkte einen wehmütig-heiteren Abschiedsgruß hin. Fridolin folgte ihrem Blick; dort standen keine Femrichter mehr, sondern zwei schlanke junge Herrn in Frack und weißer Krawatte, doch beide noch mit den roten Larven über den Gesichtern. Pierrette schwebte die Wendeltreppe hinab, Gibiser ging hinter ihr, ihnen folgte Fridolin.

Pierrette floated down the spiral staircase, Gibiser walked behind her, and Fridolin followed them.

"Die dunkle Tracht fiel wie durch einen Zauber von ihr ab, im Glanz ihres weißen Leibes stand sie da, sie griff nach dem Schleier, der ihr um Stirn, Haupt und Nacken gewunden war, und mit einer wundersamen runden Bewegung wand sie ihn los. Er sank zu Boden, dunkle Haare stürzten ihr über Schultern, Brust und Lenden – doch ehe noch Fridolin das Bild ihres Antlitzes zu erhaschen vermochte, war er von unwiderstehlichen Armen erfaßt, fortgerissen und zur Türe gedrängt worden; im Augenblick darauf befand er sich im Vorraum, die Türe hinter ihm fiel zu, ein verlarvter Bedienter brachte ihm den Pelz, war ihm beim Anziehen behilflich, und das Haustor öffnete sich. Wie von einer unsichtbaren Gewalt fortgetrieben eilte er weiter, er stand auf der Straße, das Licht hinter ihm erlosch, er blickte sich um und sah das Haus schweigend daliegen mit verschlossenen Fenstern, aus denen kein Schimmer drang.

As if driven away by an invisible force, he hurried on, he stood in the street, the light went out behind him, he looked around and saw the house lying there in silence with the windows closed, from which not a glimmer came.

"Sie nahm seine Hände, streichelte sie und sah zu ihm auf mit umflorten Augen, auf deren Grund er ihre Gedanken zu lesen vermochte. Jetzt dachte sie seiner andern, wirklicherer, dachte seiner Jünglingserlebnisse, in deren manche sie eingeweiht war, da er, ihrer eifersüchtigen Neugier allzu willig nachgebend, ihr in den ersten Ehejahren manches verraten, ja, wie ihm oftmals scheinen wollte, preisgegeben, was er lieber für sich hätte behalten sollen. In dieser Stunde, er wußte es, drängte manche Erinnerung sich ihr mit Notwendigkeit auf, und er wunderte sich kaum, als sie, wie aus einem Traum, den halbvergessenen Namen einer seiner Jugendgeliebten aussprach.

"Er überquerte den Rathausplatz, der trüb erglänzte wie ein bräunlicher Teich, und wandte sich dem heimatlichen Josefstädter Bezirk zu. Von weitem hörte er dumpfe, regelmäßige Schritte und sah, noch ziemlich entfernt, eben um eine Straßenecke biegend, einen kleinen Trupp von Couleurstudenten, die, sechs oder acht an der Zahl, ihm entgegenkamen. Als die jungen Leute in den Schein einer Laterne gerieten, glaubte er die blauen Alemannen in ihnen zu erkennen. Er selbst hatte nie einer Verbindung angehört, aber seinerzeit ein paar Säbelmensuren ausgefochten. Im Zusammenhang mit dieser Erinnerung an seine Studentenzeit fielen ihm die roten Dominos ein, die ihn gestern nacht in die Loge gelockt und so bald wieder schnöde verlassen hatten. Die Studenten waren ganz nahe, sie redeten laut und lachten; – ob er nicht einen oder den andern aus dem Spitale kennen mochte? Doch bei der unsicheren Beleuchtung war es nicht möglich, die Physiognomien deutlich auszunehmen. Er mußte sich ganz nahe an die Mauer halten, um nicht mit ihnen zusammenzustoßen; – jetzt waren sie vorbei; nur der zuletzt ging, ein langer Kerl im offnen Winterrock, eine Binde über dem linken Auge, schien geradezu absichtlich ein Stückchen zurückzubleiben und stieß mit seitlich abgestrecktem Ellbogen an ihn an. Es konnte kein Zufall sein. Was fällt dem Kerl ein, dachte Fridolin und blieb unwillkürlich stehen; der andere nach zwei Schritten tat desgleichen, und so sahen sie einander einen Moment lang aus mäßiger Entfernung in die Augen. Plötzlich aber wandte Fridolin sich wieder ab und ging weiter. Er hörte ein kurzes Lachen hinter sich – fast hätte er sich nochmals umgewandt, um den Burschen zu stellen, aber er verspürte ein sonderbares Herzklopfen – ganz wie einmal vor zwölf oder vierzehn Jahren, als es so heftig an seine Tür gepocht hatte, während das anmutige junge Ding bei ihm war, das immer von einem entfernt lebenden, wahrscheinlich gar nicht existierenden Bräutigam zu faseln liebte; es war auch tatsächlich nur der Briefträger gewesen, der so drohend gepocht hatte. – Und geradeso wie damals fühlte er jetzt sein Herz klopfen. Was ist das, fragte er sich ärgerlich und merkte nun, daß ihm die Knie ein wenig zitterten. Feig? Unsinn, erwiderte er sich selbst. Soll ich mich mit einem betrunkenen Studenten herstellen, ich, ein Mann von fünfunddreißig Jahren, praktischer Arzt, verheiratet, Vater eines Kindes! – Kontrahage! Zeugen! Duell! Und am Ende wegen einer solchen dummen Rempelei einen Hieb in den Arm? Und für ein paar Wochen berufsunfähig? – Oder ein Auge heraus? – Oder gar Blutvergiftung? – Und in acht Tagen so weit wie der Herr in der Schreyvogelgasse unter der Bettdecke aus braunem Flanell! Feig? Drei Säbelmensuren hatte er ausgefochten, und auch zu einem Pistolenduell war er einmal bereit gewesen, und nicht auf seine Veranlassung war die Sache damals gütlich beigelegt worden. Und sein Beruf! Gefahren von allen Seiten und in jedem Augenblick – man vergaß nur immer wieder dran. Wie lange war es her, daß das diphtheritiskranke Kind ihm ins Gesicht gehustet hatte? Drei oder vier Tage, nicht mehr. Das war immerhin eine bedenklichere Sache als so eine kleine Säbelfechterei. Und er hatte überhaupt nicht mehr daran gedacht. Nun, wenn er dem Kerl wieder begegnete, ließ sich die Angelegenheit immer noch ins reine bringen. Keineswegs war er verpflichtet, um Mitternacht auf dem Weg von einem Kranken oder auch zu einem Kranken, das hätte ja schließlich auch der Fall sein können – nein, er war wirklich nicht verpflichtet, auf solch eine alberne Studentenrempelei zu reagieren. Wenn jetzt zum Exempel der junge Däne ihm entgegenkäme, mit dem Albertine – ach nein, was fiel ihm denn nur ein? Nun – es war ja doch nicht anders, als wenn sie seine Geliebte gewesen wäre. Schlimmer noch. Ja, der sollte ihm jetzt entgegenkommen. Oh, eine wahre Wonne wäre es, dem irgendwo in einer Waldlichtung gegenüberzustehen und auf die Stirn mit dem glattgestrichenen Blondhaar den Lauf einer Pistole zu richten.","He crossed the town hall square, which shone dimly like a brownish pond, and turned towards his home district of Josefstadt. In the distance he heard muffled, regular footsteps, and still quite a distance away, turning a street corner, he saw a small group of Couleur students, six or eight in number, coming toward him. When the young people caught the light of a lantern, he thought he recognized the blue Alemanni in them. He himself had never belonged to a fraternity, but had fought a few saber mensurations in his time. In connection with this memory of his student days, he remembered the red dominoes that had lured him into the box last night and so soon left again despicably. The students were very close, they were talking loudly and laughing; - whether he might not know one or the other from the hospital? However, with the uncertain lighting, it was not possible to make out the physiognomies clearly. He had to keep very close to the wall to avoid colliding with them; – now they were over; only the one who went last, a tall fellow in an open winter coat, a bandage over his left eye, seemed to deliberately stay behind a bit and bumped into him with his elbow stretched out to the side. It couldn't be a coincidence. What's that guy thinking of, Fridolin thought and stopped involuntarily; the other two steps away did the same, and so for a moment they looked into each other's eyes from a moderate distance. Suddenly Fridolin turned away and went on. He heard a short laugh behind him - he almost turned to confront the lad again, but felt a strange pounding of his heart - just like it had twelve or fourteen years ago when there had been a loud knock on his door during the graceful there was a young thing with him who always loved to babble about a distant, probably nonexistent, groom; in fact, it had only been the postman who had knocked so menacingly. And just as then he felt his heart beating. What is that, he asked himself angrily and now noticed that his knees were shaking a little. cowardly? Nonsense, he replied to himself. Shall I make amends with a drunk student, I, a man of thirty-five, a general practitioner, married, father of one child! - Contracthage! witnesses! Duel! And in the end a slap in the arm for such a stupid jostle? And unable to work for a few weeks? – Or an eye out? – Or even blood poisoning? – And in eight days as far as the gentleman in Schreyvogelgasse under the brown flannel blanket! cowardly? He had fought three times with a saber, and he had once been ready for a pistol duel, and the matter had not been settled amicably at that time, not through his instigation. And his job! Dangers from all sides and at every moment - one just kept forgetting about it. How long had it been since the child with diphtheria had coughed in his face? Three or four days, no more. That was at least a more serious matter than a little saber fencing. And he hadn't thought about it at all. Well, if he ran into the guy again, things could always be settled. He wasn't obligated to go at midnight on his way from or to a sick person, which could have been the case after all - no, he really wasn't obligated to react to such a silly student jostle. If, for example, the young Dane were to come towards him with the Albertine - oh no, what was he thinking of? Well – it wasn't any different than if she had been his mistress. Even worse. Yes, he should meet him now. Oh, how blissful it would be to face him somewhere in a clearing in the woods and point the barrel of a pistol at the forehead with the straightened blond hair.","He crossed the Rathausplatz, which glistened faintly like a brownish pond, and turned towards home in the Josefstadt district. In the distance he could hear the regular muffled sound of marching, and still some way off, just rounding a street corner, he saw a small troop of some half dozen fraternity students coming towards him. As the youths emerged into the light of a street lamp, he recognized that they were Alemannians from the blue colours they were sporting. He himself had never belonged to a fraternity, but he had taken part in a few fencing-matches in his time. And the memory of his student days put him in mind of the dominoes in red, who had enticed him into their box the night before and contemptuously abandoned him again so soon. The students were now quite close and were laughing and talking loudly; did he know any of them from the hospital? But in the uncertain light it was impossible to make out their features clearly. He was obliged to stay very close to the wall to avoid colliding with them; now they were past; but the last one to pass him, a lanky fellow in an open winter overcoat and with a bandage over his left eye, seemed quite deliberately to hold back a little and, thrusting his elbow sideways, bumped against him. It could not have been an accident. What does the fellow think he’s doing, thought Fridolin, and immediately stopped short; after a couple of steps the student did the same, and so for a moment they eyed one another at close range. But then Fridolin suddenly turned round again and continued on his way. He heard a short laugh behind him, and was on the point of turning back again to challenge the fellow, but felt his heart beating wildly – exactly as it had about twelve years ago when there had been a loud knocking at his door while he had been entertaining a charming young lady given to rambling on about a – probably non-existent – bridegroom living some way away; though as it turned out it had only been the postman who had been knocking in so threatening a manner. And now he again felt his heart racing, exactly as on that occasion. What’s all this, he said to himself peevishly, noticing that his knees were trembling a little. Cowardice? Nonsense! Am I, a man of thirty-five, a practising physician, married and father of a child, really expected to go challenging some drunken student! Challenges! Witnesses! A duel! And perhaps an arm wound into the bargain, all because of a stupid incident like that. And then be professionally incapacitated for a few weeks? Or lose an eye? Or even blood-poisoning? Within a week he could well be as far gone as the gentleman under the brown flannel bed-cover in the Schreyvogelgasse! Cowardice? He had fought in three student fencing-matches, and once had even been prepared to duel with pistols, and it certainly was not on his initiative that the matter had then been amicably settled. And what about his profession! Dangers on all sides and at every moment – it was just that one tended to forget about them. How long ago was it that that child with diphtheria had coughed in his face? No more than three or four days. Now that was a far more serious matter than some footling sword-play, and he had not thought twice about it. Well, if he met the fellow again, the matter could yet be resolved. He was scarcely obliged, at midnight on the way to or from a patient – and after all that might have been the case – to respond to the absurd effrontery of some student. Now if on the other hand he were to come across the young Dane, with whom Albertine – no, no, what was he thinking of? But then – it really was no different to her having been his mistress. Worse even. If only he were to come towards him now. What a pleasure it would be to stand opposite him in some forest clearing and aim the barrel of his pistol at that forehead with the fair hair combed across it.","As he crossed Rathaus Square, which had a dull gleam like a brownish pond, and turned homeward, he heard the muffled sound of marching steps in the distance. Then he saw, still quite far away, a small group of fraternity students, six or eight in number, turning a corner and coming towards him. When the light of a street lamp fell upon them he thought he recognized them, with their blue caps, as members of the Alemannia, for although he had never belonged to a fraternity, he had fought a few sabre duels in his time. In thinking of his student days he was reminded again of the red dominoes who had lured him into a box at the ball the night before and then had so shamefully deserted him. The students were quite near now; they were laughing and talking loudly. Perhaps one or two of them were from the hospital? But it was impossible to see their faces plainly because of the dim light, and he had to stay quite close to the houses so as not to collide with them. Now they had passed. Only the one in the rear, a tall fellow with open overcoat and a bandage over his left eye, seemed to lag behind, and deliberately bumped into him with his raised elbow. It couldn't have been mere chance. What's got into that fellow? Fridolin thought, and involuntarily he stopped. The other took two more steps and turned. They looked at each other for a moment with only a short distance separating them. Suddenly Fridolin turned around again and went on. He heard a short laugh behind him and he longed to challenge the fellow, but he felt his heart beating strangely, just as it had on a previous occasion, twelve or fourteen years before. There had been an unusually loud knock on his door while he had had with him a certain charming young creature who was never tired of prattling about her jealous fiance. As a matter of fact, it was only the postman who had knocked in such a threatening manner. And now he felt his heart beating just as it had at that time. What's the meaning of this? he asked himself, and he noticed that his knees were shaking a little. Am I a coward? Oh! nonsense, he reassured himself. Why should I go and face a drunken student, I, a man of thirty-five, a practising physician, a married man and father of a child? Formal challenge! Seconds! A duel! And perhaps because of such a silly encounter receive a cut in my arm and be unable to perform my professional duties?—Or lose an eye?—Or even get blood-poisoning?—And in a week perhaps be in the same position as the man in Schreyvogel Strasse under the brown flannel blanket? Coward—? He had fought three sabre duels, and had even been ready to fight a duel with pistols, and it wasn't at his request that the matter had been called off. And what about his profession! There were dangers lurking everywhere and at all times—except that one usually forgets about them. Why, how long ago was it that that child with diphtheria had coughed in his face? Only three or four days, that's all. After all, that was much more dangerous than a little fencing match with sabres, and he hadn't given it a second thought. Well, if he ever met that fellow again, the affair could still be straightened out. He was by no means bound by the code of honor to take a silly encounter with a student seriously when on an errand of mercy, to or from a patient. But if, for instance, he should meet the young Dane with whom Albertina —oh, nonsense, what was he thinking of? Well, after all, it was just as bad as if she had been his mistress. Even worse. Yes, just let that fellow cross his path! What a joy it would be to face him somewhere in a clearing in the woods and aim a pistol at his forehead with its smoothly combed blond hair."
"»Du bist in Wien, Nachtigall?« rief Fridolin.","""Are you in Vienna, nightingale?"" called Fridolin.",‘So you’re in Vienna?’ cried Fridolin.,"""You here in Vienna, Nachtigall?"" exclaimed Fridolin."
"»Nicht mehr«, erwiderte Doktor Roediger, »jetzt ist sie allein. Es wird sie gewiß freuen, Sie noch zu sehen, Herr Doktor. Morgen bringen wir sie nämlich nach Mödling, meine Mutter und ich«, und auf einen höflich fragenden Blick Fridolins: »Meine Eltern haben nämlich dort ein kleines Häuschen. Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Doktor. Ich habe noch allerlei zu besorgen. Ja, was so ein – Fall zu tun gibt! Ich hoffe, Sie noch oben anzutreffen, Herr Doktor, wenn ich zurückkomme.« Und schon trat er aus dem Haustor auf die Straße.","'Not anymore,' said Doctor Roediger, 'now she's alone. I'm sure she'll be happy to see you, Doctor. Tomorrow we're taking her to Mödling, my mother and I."" And at a politely questioning look from Fridolin: ""My parents have a little house there. Goodbye, doctor. I still have things to do. Yes, what such a - case there is to do! I hope to see you upstairs, Doctor, when I get back.' And he stepped out of the front door onto the street.","‘No,’ replied Roediger, ‘she’s alone at present. I’m sure she’ll be pleased to see you again. Tomorrow my mother and I are taking her to Mödling,’ and in response to Fridolin’s polite look of inquiry, ‘You see, my parents have a little house there. Goodbye, doctor. I still have several matters to attend to. The things that have to be seen to in a – case like this! I hope I shall see you upstairs when I get back.’ And he stepped out of the door into the street.","""No,"" replied Doctor Roediger, ""she is alone now. She will be pleased to see you once more, for tomorrow my mother and I are taking her to Modling. "" When Fridolin raised his eyes with a politely questioning look, Doctor Roediger continued: ""My parents have a little house out there. Good-bye, doctor. I still have many things to attend to. It's unbelievable how much trouble is connected with such a—case. I hope I shall still find you upstairs when I return. "" And as he said this he reached the street."
"Fridolin erhob sich, ging ein paarmal im Zimmer auf und ab, dann sagte er: »Du hast recht.« Er stand am Fenster, das Antlitz im Dunkel. »Des Morgens«, begann er mit verschleierter, etwas feindseliger Stimme, »manchmal sehr früh noch, ehe du aufgestanden warst, pflegte ich längs des Ufers dahinzuwandern, über den Ort hinaus; und, so früh es war, immer lag schon die Sonne hell und stark über dem Meer. Da draußen am Strand gab es kleine Landhäuser, wie du weißt, die, jedes, dastanden, eine kleine Welt für sich, manche mit umplankten Gärten, manche auch nur von Wald umgeben, und die Badehütten waren von den Häusern durch die Landstraße und ein Stück Strand getrennt. Kaum daß ich je in so früher Stunde Menschen begegnete; und Badende waren überhaupt niemals zu sehen. Eines Morgens aber wurde ich ganz plötzlich einer weiblichen Gestalt gewahr, die, eben noch unsichtbar gewesen, auf der schmalen Terrasse einer in den Sand gepfählten Badehütte, einen Fuß vor den andern setzend, die Arme nach rückwärts an die Holzwand gespreitet, sich vorsichtig weiterbewegte. Es war ein ganz junges, vielleicht fünfzehnjähriges Mädchen mit aufgelöstem blonden Haar, das über die Schultern und auf der einen Seite über die zarte Brust herabfloß. Das Mädchen sah vor sich hin, ins Wasser hinab, langsam glitt es längs der Wand weiter, mit gesenktem Auge nach der andern Ecke hin, und plötzlich stand es mir gerade gegenüber; mit den Armen griff sie weit hinter sich, als wollte sie sich fester anklammern, sah auf und erblickte mich plötzlich. Ein Zittern ging durch ihren Leib, als müßte sie sinken oder fliehen. Doch da sie auf dem schmalen Brett sich doch nur ganz langsam hätte weiterbewegen können, entschloß sie sich innezuhalten – und stand nun da, zuerst mit einem erschrockenen, dann mit einem zornigen, endlich mit einem verlegenen Gesicht. Mit einemmal aber lächelte sie, lächelte wunderbar; es war ein Grüßen, ja ein Winken in ihren Augen – und zugleich ein leiser Spott, mit dem sie ganz flüchtig zu ihren Füßen das Wasser streifte, das mich von ihr trennte. Dann reckte sie den jungen schlanken Körper hoch, wie ihrer Schönheit froh, und, wie leicht zu merken war, durch den Glanz meines Blicks, den sie auf sich fühlte, stolz und süß erregt. So standen wir uns gegenüber, vielleicht zehn Sekunden lang, mit halboffenen Lippen und flimmernden Augen. Unwillkürlich breitete ich meine Arme nach ihr aus, Hingebung und Freude war in ihrem Blick. Mit einemmal aber schüttelte sie heftig den Kopf, löste einen Arm von der Wand, deutete gebieterisch, ich solle mich entfernen; und als ich es nicht gleich über mich brachte zu gehorchen, kam ein solches Bitten, ein solches Flehen in ihre Kinderaugen, daß mir nichts anderes übrigblieb, als mich abzuwenden. So rasch als möglich setzte ich meinen Weg wieder fort; ich sah mich kein einziges Mal nach ihr um, nicht eigentlich aus Rücksicht, aus Gehorsam, aus Ritterlichkeit, sondern darum, weil ich unter ihrem letzten Blick eine solche, über alles je Erlebte hinausgehende Bewegung verspürt hatte, daß ich mich einer Ohnmacht nah fühlte.« Und er schwieg.","Fridolin got up, walked up and down the room a couple of times, then he said: ""You're right."" He stood at the window, his face in the dark. ""In the mornings,"" he began in a muffled, somewhat hostile voice, ""sometimes very early, before you were up, I used to walk along the shore beyond the town; and, as early as it was, the sun was always bright and strong over the sea. There were little cottages out there on the beach, you know, standing there, each one, a little world unto itself, some with boarded gardens, some just surrounded by woods, and the bathing huts were across the country lane and a bit from the cottages beach separated. I hardly ever met people at such an early hour; and bathers were never to be seen at all. One morning, however, I suddenly became aware of a female figure who, a moment before, had been invisible on the narrow terrace of a bathing hut piled on the sand, one foot in front of the other, arms spread backwards against the wooden wall, moving cautiously onward. It was a very young girl, maybe fifteen, with loose blond hair that flowed down over her shoulders and down one side over her tender chest. The girl looked in front of her, down into the water, slowly she slid along the wall, with lowered eyes towards the other corner, and suddenly she was standing right in front of me; she reached far behind her with her arms as if she wanted to cling tighter, looked up and suddenly saw me. A trembling went through her body, as if she must sink or flee. But since she could only have moved very slowly on the narrow board, she decided to stop - and now she stood there, first with a frightened, then with an angry, and finally with an embarrassed face. But suddenly she smiled, smiled wonderfully; it was a greeting, even a wink in her eyes - and at the same time a gentle mockery with which she briefly touched the water at her feet that separated me from her. Then she raised her young, slender body, pleased with her beauty and, as was easy to see, proudly and sweetly aroused by the gleam of my gaze she felt upon her. We stood like that, for maybe ten seconds, with parted lips and flickering eyes. Instinctively I spread my arms to her, devotion and joy was in her eyes. Suddenly she shook her head violently, released one arm from the wall, and gestured imperiously that I should go away; and when I couldn't bring myself to obey at once, such a plea, such a plea, came into her children's eyes that I had no choice but to turn away. I continued on my way as quickly as possible; I didn't look back at her once, not really out of consideration, out of obedience, out of chivalry, but because under her last look I had felt such a movement, going beyond anything I had ever experienced, that I felt on the verge of fainting. ' And he said nothing.","Fridolin got up, paced up and down the room a few times, then said, ‘You’re right.’ He stood at the window, his face in darkness. ‘In the morning,’ he began in a restrained, somewhat resentful tone, ‘often very early before you got up, I would wander along the shore out past the resort; yet, early as it was, the sun would always be shining brightly over the sea. Out there along the shore, as you know, there were little houses, each a small world unto its own, some with fenced-off gardens, some just surrounded by woods, and the bathing-huts were separated from the houses by the road and by a stretch of sand. I seldom encountered anybody, and there were never any bathers at that hour. One morning, however, I suddenly became aware of a female figure, not visible before, who was gingerly advancing along the narrow gangplank of one of those bathing-huts on stilts, putting one foot in front of the other and stretching her arms behind as she groped along the wooden wall. She was a young girl of no more than fifteen, her loose, blonde hair falling over her shoulders and on one side across her tender breast. Gazing down into the water, she slowly inched her way with lowered eyes along the wall towards the near corner of the hut, and suddenly emerged directly opposite where I was standing; she reached behind her even further with her arms, as if to gain a firmer hold, looked up and suddenly caught sight of me. Her whole body began to tremble, as though she were about to either fall or to run away. But, as she could only have proceeded very slowly along the narrow plank, she decided not to move – and so she just stood there, looking at first frightened, then angry and finally embarrassed. But all at once she smiled, a ravishing smile; indeed there was a welcoming twinkle in her eye – and at the same time a gentle mockery about the way she lightly skimmed the water between us with her foot. Then she stretched her young, slender body, as though exulting in her beauty, and evidently proud and sweetly aroused at feeling my ardent gaze upon her. We stood opposite each other like this for perhaps ten seconds, with lips half open and eyes aflame. Involuntarily I stretched out my arms towards her: there was joy and abandon in her gaze. But all at once she shook her head vigorously, let go of the side of the hut with one hand, and peremptorily signalled that I should withdraw; and, when I could not bring myself to obey at once, such a pleading, such a beseeching look came into her child’s eyes that I had no alternative but to turn away. I hastily resumed my walk without once turning round – not out of consideration, obedience or chivalry, but because I’d felt so profoundly moved by her parting look, far transcending anything I’d experienced before, that I was on the point of swooning.’ And with that he ended.","Fridolin rose, walked up and down the room several times and then said: ""You're right."" He was standing at the window, his face in shadow and in a hoarse and slightly hostile voice he began: "" In the morning, sometimes very early before you got up, I used to stroll along the beach, out beyond the town. Even at that hour the sun was always shining over the sea, bright and strong. Out there on the beach, as you know, were cottages, each one standing like a world in itself. Some had fenced-in gardens, others were surrounded only by the woods. The bathing-huts were separated from the cottages by the road and part of the beach. I hardly ever met people at such an early hour, and bathers were never out. One morning, quite suddenly, I noticed the figure of a woman. She had suddenly appeared on the narrow ledge of a bathing-hut, which rested on piles driven into the sand. She was cautiously advancing, placing one foot before the other, her arms extended backward against the wooden boards. She was quite a young girl, possibly fifteen years old, with loose blond hair hanging over her shoulders and on one side over her delicate breast. She was looking down into the water and was slowly moving along the wall, her gaze lowered in the direction of the far corner. All at once she stopped opposite me and reached far back with her arms as though trying to secure a firmer hold. Looking up, she suddenly saw me. A tremor passed through her body, as though she wished to drop into the water or run. But as she could move only very slowly on the narrow ledge, she had to stay where she was. She stood there with a face expressing at first fright, then anger, and finally embarrassment. All at once, however, she smiled, smiled marvelously. Her eyes welcomed me, beckoned to me, and at the same time slightly mocked me, as she glanced at the strip of water between us. Then she stretched her young and slender body, glad of her beauty, and proudly and sweetly stirred by my obvious admiration. We stood facing each other for perhaps ten seconds, with half-open lips and dazzled eyes. Involuntarily I stretched out my arms to her; her eyes expressed surrender and joy. Then she shook her head vigorously, took one arm from the wall and commanded me with a gesture to go away. When I didn't at once obey, her childlike eyes turned on me such a beseeching look that there was nothing for me to do but to go, and I went as quickly as possible. I did not look back once —not because I felt considerate, obedient or chivalrous, but because in her last glance I sensed an emotion so intense, so far beyond anything I had ever experienced, that I was not far from fainting."" And he stopped."

"Er folgte ihr durch das Sterbezimmer, in dem das Bett nun leer stand, in den Nebenraum, wo er gestern unter dem Bilde mit dem weißuniformierten Offizier den Totenschein für den Hofrat geschrieben hatte.

"Fridolin ließ unmutig ihre Hand los. »Und wenn an jenem Abend«, sagte er dann, »zufällig ein anderer an deinem Fenster gestanden hätte und ihm wäre das richtige Wort eingefallen, zum Beispiel – –«, er dachte nach, welchen Namen er nennen sollte, da streckte sie schon wie abwehrend die Arme vor.","Fridolin unwillingly let go of her hand.

He went over to her and attempted to embrace her, reassuring her that she inspired complete confidence in him, and indeed this was no more than the truth.

"Und langsamen, zögernden Schritts nahm er den Weg durch die wohlbekannten Höfe nach dem Pathologisch-anatomischen Institut. Er fand das Tor unverschlossen, so daß er nicht nötig hatte zu klingeln. Der steinerne Fußboden hallte unter seinen Tritten, als er durch den schwach beleuchteten Gang schritt. Ein vertrauter, gewissermaßen heimatlicher Geruch von allerlei Chemikalien, der den angestammten Duft dieses Gebäudes übertönte, umfing Fridolin. Er klopfte an die Tür des histologischen Kabinetts, wo er wohl noch einen Assistenten bei der Arbeit vermuten durfte. Auf ein etwas unwirsches »Herein« trat Fridolin in den hohen, geradezu festlich erhellten Raum, in dessen Mitte, das Auge eben vom Mikroskop entfernend, wie Fridolin beinahe erwartet, sein alter Studienkollege, der Assistent des Institutes, Doktor Adler, sich von seinem Stuhl erhob.","And with slow, hesitant steps he made his way through the well-known courtyards to the pathological-anatomical institute. He found the gate unlocked so he didn't need to ring the bell. The stone floor rumbled under his feet as he strode down the dimly lit corridor. A familiar, almost homely smell of all sorts of chemicals that drowned out the ancestral scent of this building enveloped Fridolin. He knocked on the door of the histology cabinet, where he probably still suspected an assistant at work. At a somewhat rude ""Come in,"" Fridolin stepped into the high, almost festively lit room, in the middle of which, removing his eye from the microscope, as Fridolin almost expected, his old fellow student, the institute's assistant, Doctor Adler, rose from his chair he lifted.","With slow, hesitant steps he made his way across the courtyards to the Pathology Institute. He found the main gate unlocked, so he did not have to ring. The stone floor echoed beneath his feet as he walked along the dimly lit passage. A familiar, almost domestic smell of various chemicals, which drowned out the native odour of the building, enveloped Fridolin. He knocked at the door of the histology lab, where he suspected there might be a technician still at work. On hearing a rather irritable ‘Come in’, he entered the high-ceilinged, almost festively illuminated room, in the middle of which, as Fridolin had half expected, his old fellow student, the Institute technician Dr Adler had just withdrawn his eye from a microscope, and was now rising from his chair.","With slow and hesitating steps he crossed the familiar courtyards to the Institute of Pathological Anatomy. Finding the door unlocked, it was unnecessary to ring the bell. The stone floor resounded under his footsteps as he walked through the dimly lighted hall. A familiar, and to a certain extent homelike, smell of all kinds of chemicals pervaded the place. He knocked on the door of the Histological Room where he expected to find some assistant still at work. A rather gruff voice called ""Come in."" Fridolin entered the high-ceilinged room which seemed almost festively illuminated. As he half expected, Doctor Adler, an assistant in the Institute and an old fellow-student of his, was in the center of the room. He raised his eyes from the microscope and arose from his chair."
»Eben bin ich im Hausflur Herrn Doktor Roediger begegnet. – Also morgen schon fahren Sie aufs Land?«,"“I just met Doctor Roediger in the hallway. ""So you're going to the country tomorrow?""",‘I just met Dr Roediger in the hall. So you’re off to the country tomorrow already?’,"""I have just met Doctor Roediger. So you are going to the country tomorrow?"""
"»Die Maske herunter!« riefen einige zugleich. Wie zum Schutz hielt Fridolin die Arme vor sich hingestreckt. Tausendmal schlimmer wäre es ihm erschienen, der einzige mit unverlarvtem Gesicht unter lauter Masken dazustehen, als plötzlich unter Angekleideten nackt. Und mit fester Stimme sagte er: »Wenn einer von den Herren sich durch mein Erscheinen in seiner Ehre gekränkt fühlen sollte, so erkläre ich mich bereit, ihm in üblicher Weise Genugtuung zu geben. Doch meine Maske werde ich nur in dem Falle ablegen, daß Sie alle das gleiche tun, meine Herren.«","""Take off the mask!"" some shouted in unison. As if for protection, Fridolin stretched out his arms in front of him. It would have seemed a thousand times worse to be the only one standing there with his face uncovered under masks than suddenly naked among dressed people. And in a firm voice he said: 'If any of the gentlemen should feel their honor injured by my appearance, I declare myself ready to give him the usual satisfaction. But I will only take off my mask in case you all do the same, gentlemen.'","‘Take off your mask!’ cried several of them at once. Fridolin held up his arm in front of him as if to shield his face. It seemed to him a thousand times worse to stand there as the only one unmasked amid a host of masks, than suddenly to stand naked among those fully dressed. And in a firm voice he said, ‘If any of you gentlemen should feel his honour stained by my appearance here, I’m quite ready to give him satisfaction in the usual way. But I’ll remove my mask only on the condition, gentlemen, that the rest of you do likewise.’","""Take off your mask!"" several of them demanded. Fridolin held out his arm to protect himself. It seemed a thousand times worse to be the only one unmasked amongst so many that were, than to stand suddenly naked amongst people who were dressed. He replied firmly: ""If my appearance here has offended any of the gentlemen present, I am ready to give satisfaction in the usual manner, but I shall take off my mask only if all of you will do the same."""
"Nun merkte er, daß er immer noch ihre Finger mit seinen Händen umfaßt hielt und daß er, wie sehr er diese Frau auch zu hassen gewillt war, für diese schlanken, kühlen, ihm so vertrauten Finger eine unveränderte, nur schmerzlicher gewordene Zärtlichkeit empfand; und unwillkürlich, ja gegen seinen Willen – ehe er diese vertraute Hand aus der seinen löste, berührte er sie sanft mit seinen Lippen.","Now he noticed that he was still holding her fingers in his hands and that, however much he wanted to hate this woman, he felt an unchanged tenderness for these slender, cool fingers that were so familiar to him, only becoming more painful; and involuntarily, even against his will—before he took that familiar hand from his, he touched it gently with his lips.","He now noticed that he was still holding her fingers in his hand and that, despite his determination to hate this woman, he felt an undiminished though more painful affection for those cool slender fingers that he knew so well; and involuntarily, indeed positively against his will, he softly pressed his lips to her hand before relinquishing it…","He realized that he was still clasping her fingers. Ready as he was to hate her, his feeling of tenderness for these slender, cool fingers was unchanged except that it was more acute. Involuntarily, in fact against his will, he gently pressed his lips on this familiar hand before he let it go."
"Fridolin schlug die Tür hinter sich zu. Dies wäre nun erledigt, dachte er mit einem Gefühl des Ärgers, das ihn selbst unverhältnismäßig dünkte. Er eilte die Treppen hinab, begab sich ohne besondere Eile auf die Poliklinik und telephonierte vor allem nach Hause, um sich zu erkundigen, ob ein Patient nach ihm geschickt habe, ob Post gekommen sei, was es sonst Neues gebe. Das Dienstmädchen hatte kaum ihre Antworten erteilt, als Albertine selbst an den Apparat kam und Fridolin begrüßte. Sie wiederholte alles, was das Dienstmädchen schon gesagt, dann erzählte sie unbefangen, daß sie eben erst aufgestanden sei und mit dem Kinde gemeinsam frühstücken wolle. »Gib ihr einen Kuß von mir«, sagte Fridolin, »und laßt es euch gut schmecken.«","Fridolin slammed the door behind her. That's settled now, he thought with a feeling of anger that he felt disproportionate to himself. He hurried down the stairs, went to the polyclinic without any particular hurry and, above all, telephoned home to inquire whether a patient had sent for him, whether the mail had come, and what else was new. The maid had scarcely finished replying when Albertine herself came to the line and greeted Fridolin. She repeated everything the maid had already said, then she said in an uninhibited manner that she had just got up and wanted to have breakfast with the child. ""Give her a kiss from me,"" said Fridolin, ""and enjoy it.""","Fridolin slammed the door behind him. Well, that’s seen to, he thought, with a feeling of exasperation that even to him seemed out of all proportion. He hurried down the stairs, made for the polyclinic without undue haste, and telephoned home at once to inquire whether any of his patients had sent for him, whether the post had come, and whether there was any other news. The maid had scarcely finished answering when Albertine herself came to the phone and greeted him. She repeated everything the maid had just said, and without any awkwardness told him she had just got up and was about to have breakfast with the child. ‘Give her a kiss from me,’ said Fridolin, ‘and enjoy your meal.’","Fridolin slammed the door behind him. So that is settled, he thought, as he hurried down the stairs with a feeling of annoyance which, even to him, seemed exaggerated. The first thing he did on arriving at the Polyclinic was to telephone home to inquire whether any patients had sent for him, if there was any mail, or any other news. The maid had scarcely answered him when Albertina herself came to the phone to answer Fridolin's call. She repeated everything the maid had already told him, and then said casually that she had just got up and was going to have breakfast with the child. ""Give her a kiss for me,"" said Fridolin, ""and I hope you enjoy your breakfast."""
"Er hörte den gleichmäßig-ruhigen Atem Albertinens und sah die Umrisse ihres Kopfes sich auf dem weichen Polster abzeichnen. Ein Gefühl von Zärtlichkeit, ja von Geborgenheit, wie er es nicht erwartet, durchdrang seine Herz. Und er nahm sich vor, ihr bald, vielleicht morgen schon, die Geschichte der vergangenen Nacht zu erzählen, doch so, als wäre alles, was er erlebt, ein Traum gewesen – und dann, erst wenn sie die ganze Nichtigkeit seiner Abenteuer gefühlt und erkannt hatte, wollte er ihr gestehen, daß sie Wirklichkeit gewesen waren. Wirklichkeit? fragte er sich – und gewahrte in diesem Augenblick, ganz nahe dem Antlitz Albertines auf dem benachbarten, auf seinem Polster etwas Dunkles, Abgegrenztes, wie die umschatteten Linien eines menschlichen Gesichts. Einen Moment nur stand ihm das Herz still, im nächsten schon wußte er, woran er war, griff nach dem Polster hin und hielt die Maske in der Hand, die er während der vorigen Nacht getragen, die ihm, während er heute morgen das Paket zusammengerollt, ohne daß er es bemerkt, entglitten, und von dem Stubenmädchen oder Albertine selbst gefunden sein mochte. So konnte er auch nicht daran zweifeln, daß Albertine nach diesem Fund mancherlei ahnte und vermutlich noch mehr und noch Schlimmeres, als sich tatsächlich ereignet hatte. Doch die Art, wie sie ihm das zu verstehen gab, ihr Einfall, die dunkle Larve neben sich auf das Polster hinzulegen, als hätte sie nun sein, des Gatten, ihr nun rätselhaft gewordenes Antlitz zu bedeuten, diese scherzhafte, fast übermütige Art, in der zugleich eine milde Warnung und die Bereitwilligkeit des Verzeihens ausgedrückt schien, gab Fridolin die sichere Hoffnung, daß sie, wohl in Erinnerung ihres eigenen Traums – was auch geschehen sein mochte, geneigt war, es nicht allzu schwer zu nehmen. Fridolin aber, mit einem Male am Ende seiner Kräfte, ließ die Maske zu Boden gleiten, schluchzte, sich selbst ganz unerwartet, laut und schmerzlich auf, sank neben dem Bette nieder und weinte leise in die Kissen hinein.","He heard Albertina's even, calm breathing and saw the outline of her head on the soft cushion. A feeling of tenderness, yes of security that he did not expect penetrated his heart. And he made up his mind to tell her the story of the previous night soon, maybe tomorrow, but as if everything he experienced had been a dream - and then only when she felt and recognized the entire futility of his adventures had, he wanted to confess to her that they had been real. Reality? he wondered - and at that moment, very close to Albertine's face on the next one, on his cushion, saw something dark and delineated, like the shadowed lines of a human face. For a moment his heart stood still, the next he knew where he was, reached for the pillow and held the mask in his hand that he had worn the night before, which he had given him while he rolled up the package this morning slipped away without him noticing, and might have been found by the chambermaid or by Albertine herself. So he could not doubt that after this discovery Albertine suspected many things and probably even more and even worse things than had actually happened. But the way she made him understand that, her idea of laying the dark mask down on the cushion next to her, as if she now meant his, her husband's, her now mysterious face, this jocular, almost cocky way, in which at the same time seemed to express a mild warning and a willingness to forgive, gave Fridolin the sure hope that, remembering her own dream, whatever happened, she was inclined not to take it too seriously. But Fridolin, suddenly at the end of his strength, let the mask slide to the floor, sobbed, quite unexpectedly, loudly and painfully, sank down beside the bed and wept softly into the pillows.","He could hear Albertine’s calm, regular breathing and see the outline of her head silhouetted against the soft pillow. A feeling of tenderness and of security he had not expected overwhelmed him. And he resolved to tell her the whole story quite soon, perhaps even tomorrow, but as if everything he had experienced had only been a dream – and then, when she had felt and acknowledged the insignificance of his adventure, he would confess that it had indeed been real. Real? he asked himself – and at that moment became aware of something very close to Albertine’s face on the other pillow, on his pillow, something dark and quite distinct, like the shadowy outline of a human face. His heart stood still for an instant until he grasped the situation, and, reaching out, he seized the mask he had worn the previous evening, which evidently had slipped out without his noticing that morning as he rolled up his costume, and which the chambermaid or even Albertine herself must then have found. So he could scarcely doubt that after this discovery Albertine must suspect something, and conceivably worse things than had actually happened. Yet the way she had chosen to let him know this, the idea of laying out the dark mask on the pillow next to her, as if to represent his, her husband’s face, which had become a riddle to her, this witty, almost light-hearted approach, which seemed to contain both a mild warning and a willingness to forgive, gave Fridolin reason to hope that, remembering her own dream, she would be disposed not to take whatever might have happened all that seriously. But then suddenly, feeling utterly exhausted, Fridolin let the mask slip to the floor and to his own surprise broke into loud, heart-rending sobs, sank down beside the bed and wept quietly into the pillow.","He heard Albertina breathing quietly and regularly and saw the outlines of her head on the soft pillow. Unexpectedly, his heart was filled with a feeling of tenderness and even of security. He decided to tell her the story of the preceding night very soon— perhaps even the next day—but to tell it as though everything he had experienced had been a dream. Then, when she had fully realized the utter futility of his adventures, he would confess to her that they had been real. Real? he asked himself—and at this moment he noticed something dark quite near Albertina's face. It had definite outlines like the shadowy features of a human face, and it was lying on his pillow. For a moment his heart stopped beating, but an instant later he saw what it was, and stretching out his hand, picked up the mask he had worn the night before. He must have lost it in the morning when making up his bundle, and the maid or Albertina herself had found it. Undoubtedly Albertina, after making this find, suspected something—presumably, more and worse things than had actually happened. And she intimated this, by placing the mask on the pillow beside her, as though it signified his face, the face of her husband who had become an enigma to her. This playful, almost joking action seemed to express both a gentle warning and her readiness to forgive. Fridolin confidently hoped that, remembering her own dream, she would not be inclined to take his too seriously, no matter what might have happened. All at once, however, he reached the end of his strength. He dropped the mask, uttered a loud and painful sob—quite unexpectedly—sank down beside the bed, buried his head in the pillows, and wept."
"Seit seiner Gymnasiastenzeit hatte er mit einem Frauenzimmer dieser Art nichts zu tun gehabt. Geriet er plötzlich in seine Knabenjahre zurück, daß dieses Geschöpf ihn reizte? Er erinnerte sich eines flüchtigen Bekannten, eines eleganten jungen Mannes, dem man ein fabelhaftes Glück bei Frauen nachsagte, mit dem er als Student nach einem Ball in einem Nachtlokal gesessen hatte und der, ehe er sich mit einer der gewerbsmäßigen Besucherinnen entfernte, Fridolins etwas verwunderten Blick mit den Worten erwidert hatte: »Es bleibt immer das Bequemste; – und die Schlimmsten sind es auch nicht.«","He hadn't had anything to do with a woman like that since he was in high school. Was he suddenly too young to be tempted by this creature? He remembered a casual acquaintance, an elegant young man who was said to have fabulous luck with women, with whom he had sat after a ball in a nightclub as a student, and who, before going off with one of the professional visitors, had puzzled Fridolins somewhat Blick had replied with the words: ""It's always the most comfortable thing; – and they aren’t the worst either.«","He had not had anything to do with women of her kind since his high school days. If he were suddenly transported back to his boyhood, would this creature have attracted him? He remembered a passing acquaintance, an elegant young man who was reputed to be a great womanizer, with whom as a student he had once visited a nightclub after a ball, and how as he departed with one of the professional hostesses he answered Fridolin’s bewildered look by saying, ‘It’s always the most pleasurable way. Besides, they’re not the worst women in the world.’","He had had no relations with a woman of this sort since he had been a student at the Gymnasium. Was the attraction this girl had for him a sign that he was suddenly reverting to adolescence? He recalled a casual acquaintance, a smart young man, who was supposed to be extremely successful with women. Once while Fridolin was a student he had been sitting with him in an all-night cafe, after a ball. When the young man proposed to leave with one of the regular girls of the place, Fridolin looked at him in surprise. Thereupon he answered: ""After all, it's the most convenient way— and they aren't by any means the worst."""
"»Ja und nein«, lachte Nachtigall, wurde aber gleich wieder ernst.","""Yes and no,"" Nightingale laughed, but then turned serious again.","‘Yes and no,’ laughed Nachtigall, but he immediately became serious again.","""Yes and no,"" said Nachtigall, laughing, but he became serious again at once."

"»Stets gerne zu Diensten«, sagte Doktor Adler, begleitete Fridolin über die hallenden Steinfliesen bis zum Tore, das indessen geschlossen worden war, und sperrte es mit seinem eigenen Schlüssel auf.","""Always happy to help,"" said Doctor Adler, accompanying Fridolin across the echoing stone tiles to the gate, which had meanwhile been closed, and unlocking it with his own key.","‘Always pleased to be of service,’ said Adler, and accompanied Fridolin along the echoing flagstones to the main door, which meanwhile had been locked, and opened it with his own key.","""I'm always at your service,"" said Doctor Adler. He accompanied Fridolin over the resounding flagstones to the locked outer door, and opened it with his own key."
"Er folgte Doktor Adler über den Gang zu der gegenüberliegenden Türe, die halb offen stand. Der kahle hohe Raum war durch die zwei offenen, etwas heruntergeschraubten Flammen eines zweiarmigen Gaslüsters schwach beleuchtet. Von den zwölf oder vierzehn Leichentischen war nur die geringere Anzahl belegt. Einige Körper lagen nackt da, über die anderen waren Leinentücher gebreitet. Fridolin trat zu dem ersten Tisch gleich an der Türe und zog vorsichtig das Tuch von dem Kopf der Leiche weg. Ein greller Lichtschein von der elektrischen Taschenlampe des Doktor Adler fiel plötzlich hin. Fridolin sah ein gelbes, graubärtiges Männergesicht und bedeckte es gleich wieder mit dem Leichentuch. Auf dem nächsten Tisch lag ein hagerer nackter Jünglingsleib. Doktor Adler, von einem anderen Tische her, sagte: »Eine zwischen sechzig und siebzig, die wird's also wohl auch nicht sein.«","He followed Doctor Adler across the corridor to the opposite door, which was half open. The bare high room was dimly lit by the two open flames of a two-armed gas chandelier, slightly dimmed. Only a small number of the twelve or fourteen mortuary tables were occupied. Some bodies lay naked, others had linen sheets spread over them. Fridolin went to the first table right by the door and carefully pulled the cloth away from the corpse's head. A glare from Doctor Adler's electric flashlight suddenly fell. Fridolin saw a yellow, grey-bearded man's face and immediately covered it again with the shroud. On the next table lay a gaunt, naked youthful body. Doctor Adler, from another table, said: ""One between sixty and seventy, so it probably won't be that either.""","He followed Adler across the hall to the door opposite, which stood ajar. The high, bare room was dimly illuminated by the low flame from a double gas lamp. Only a few of the dozen or so mortuary beds were occupied. A few corpses were lying there stark naked, the others were covered with linen sheets. Fridolin went up to the first table, next to the door, and carefully removed the sheet from the head of the deceased. Suddenly it was lit up by the harsh light from Adler’s pocket torch. Fridolin saw a yellow, grey-bearded man’s face and covered it with the shroud again at once. On the next table lay the thin naked body of a young man. Coming over from another table, Adler said, ‘A woman in her sixties or seventies, that wouldn’t be her.’","He followed Doctor Adler across the hallway to the door opposite, which was ajar. The bare high room was dimly lighted by the low, unshaded flames of a two-armed gas-fixture. Less than half of the twelve or fourteen morgue tables were occupied by corpses. A few bodies were lying there naked. Others were covered with linen sheets. Fridolin stepped up to the first table by the door and carefully drew back the covering from the head of the corpse. A glare from Doctor Adler's flashlight suddenly fell upon it and Fridolin saw the yellow face of a gray-bearded man. He immediately covered it again with the shroud. On the next table was the naked, emaciated body of a young man, and Doctor Adler called out from farther down: ""Here's a woman between sixty and seventy, so I suppose she isn't the one either."""
"»Ich glaube, noch viel mehr«, erwiderte Albertine ernst. »Aber, wie soll ich dir das erklären – trotz der innigsten Umarmung war unsere Zärtlichkeit ganz schwermütig wie mit einer Ahnung von vorbestimmtem Leid. Mit einemmal war der Morgen da. Die Wiese war licht und bunt, der Wald ringsum köstlich betaut, und über der Felswand zitterten Sonnenstrahlen. Und wir beide sollten nun wieder zurück in die Welt, unter die Menschen, es war die höchste Zeit. Doch nun war etwas Fürchterliches geschehen. Unsere Kleider waren fort. Ein Entsetzen ohnegleichen erfaßte mich, brennende Scham bis zu innerer Vernichtung, zugleich Zorn gegen dich, als wärst du allein an dem Unglück schuld; – und all das: Entsetzen, Scham, Zorn war an Heftigkeit mit nichts zu vergleichen, was ich jemals im Wachsein empfunden habe. Du aber im Bewußtsein deiner Schuld stürztest davon, nackt wie du warst, um hinabzusteigen und uns Gewänder zu verschaffen. Und als du verschwunden warst, wurde mir ganz leicht zumut. Du tatest mir weder leid, noch war ich in Sorge um dich, ich war nur froh, daß ich allein war, lief glückselig auf der Wiese umher und sang: es war die Melodie eines Tanzes, die wir auf der Redoute gehört haben. Meine Stimme klang wundervoll, und ich wünschte, man sollte mich unten in der Stadt hören. Diese Stadt sah ich nicht, aber ich wußte sie. Sie lag tief unter mir und war von einer hohen Mauer umgeben; eine ganz phantastische Stadt, die ich nicht schildern kann. Nicht orientalisch, auch nicht eigentlich altdeutsch, und doch bald das eine, bald das andere, jedenfalls eine längst und für immer versunkene Stadt. Ich aber lag plötzlich auf der Wiese hingestreckt im Sonnenglanz – viel schöner, als ich je in Wirklichkeit war, und während ich so dalag, trat aus dem Wald ein Herr, ein junger Mensch hervor, in einem hellen, modernen Anzug, er sah, wie ich jetzt weiß, ungefähr aus wie der Däne, von dem ich dir gestern erzählt habe. Er ging seines Weges, grüßte sehr höflich, als er an mir vorüberkam, beachtete mich aber nicht weiter, ging geradenwegs auf die Felswand zu und betrachtete sie aufmerksam, als überlegte er, wie man sie bezwingen könnte. Zugleich aber sah ich auch dich. Du eiltest in der versunkenen Stadt von Haus zu Haus, von Kaufladen zu Kaufladen, bald unter Laubengängen, bald durch eine Art von türkischem Bazar, und kauftest die schönsten Dinge ein, die du für mich nur finden konntest: Kleider, Wäsche, Schuhe, Schmuck; – und all das tatest du in eine kleine gelblederne Handtasche, in der doch alles Platz fand. Immerfort aber warst du von einer Menschenmenge verfolgt, die ich nicht wahrnahm, ich hörte nur ihr dumpfes, drohendes Geheul. Und nun erschien der andere wieder, der Däne, der früher vor der Felswand stehengeblieben war. Wieder kam er vom Walde her auf mich zu – und ich wußte, daß er indessen um die ganze Welt gewandert war. Er sah anders aus als zuvor, aber doch war er derselbe. Er blieb wie das erstemal vor der Felswand stehen, verschwand wieder, dann kam er wieder aus dem Wald hervor, verschwand, kam aus dem Wald; das wiederholte sich zwei oder drei oder hundertmal. Es war immer derselbe und immer ein anderer, jedesmal grüßte er, wenn er an mir vorüberkam, endlich aber blieb er vor mir stehen, sah mich prüfend an, ich lachte verlockend, wie ich nie in meinem Leben gelacht habe, er streckte die Arme nach mir aus, nun wollte ich fliehen, doch ich vermochte es nicht – und er sank zu mir auf die Wiese hin.«","""I think a lot more,"" replied Albertine gravely. “But, how can I explain this to you – despite the deepest embrace, our tenderness was quite melancholy, as with an inkling of preordained suffering. Suddenly morning came. The meadow was bright and colourful, the forest all around was covered with delicious dew, and the sun's rays trembled over the rock face. And we both should now go back into the world, among the people, it was high time. But now something terrible had happened. Our clothes were gone. An incomparable horror seized me, burning shame to the point of inner destruction, at the same time anger against you, as if you alone were to blame for the misfortune; - and all that: horror, shame, anger was like nothing I've ever felt while awake in intensity. You, however, conscious of your guilt, rushed away, naked as you were, to go down and get us robes. And when you were gone, I felt very light. I didn't feel sorry for you, nor did I worry about you, I was just glad that I was alone, ran happily about the meadow and sang: it was the melody of a dance that we heard on the redoubt. My voice sounded wonderful and I wished I could be heard down town. I didn't see this city, but I knew it. It lay far below me and was surrounded by a high wall; a very fantastic city that I cannot describe. Not oriental, not really old German either, and yet sometimes one, sometimes the other, in any case a city that has long since disappeared forever. But I suddenly lay stretched out on the meadow in the sunshine - much more beautiful than I ever was in reality, and while I was lying there a gentleman, a young man, came out of the forest in a light, modern suit, he saw how I know now, kind of like the Dane I told you about yesterday. He went on his way, saluting very politely as he passed me, but paying no further attention to me, walked straight towards the cliff face and studied it intently, as if contemplating how to conquer it. But at the same time I also saw you. You hurried from house to house in the lost city, from shop to shop, sometimes under arcades, sometimes through a kind of Turkish bazaar, and bought the most beautiful things that you could only find for me: clothes, underwear, shoes, jewelry ; – and you put all that in a small yellow leather handbag, in which there was still space for everything. But you were always followed by a crowd of people that I didn't see, I only heard their dull, menacing howls. And now the other appeared again, the Dane, who had earlier stopped in front of the cliff. Again he came towards me from the forest - and I knew that he had meanwhile wandered round the whole world. He looked different than before, but he was the same. Like the first time he stopped in front of the rock face, disappeared again, then he came out of the forest again, disappeared, came out of the forest; this was repeated two or three or a hundred times. It was always the same and always someone else, he greeted me every time he passed me, but finally he stopped in front of me, looked at me searchingly, I laughed temptingly as I have never laughed in my life, he stretched out his arms I wanted to flee, but I couldn't - and he sank down on the meadow next to me.""","‘Even more so, I suspect,’ Albertine replied seriously. ‘ And yet, how should I put it – despite our intimate embrace our love was tinged with sadness, as if by a presentiment of suffering to come. All of a sudden it was morning. The meadow was radiant and gaily coloured, the surrounding forest exquisitely bedewed, and sunlight played over the surface of the rock. And we too now felt that it was high time to rejoin the world of everyday society. But now something terrible occurred. Our clothes had disappeared. I was overcome by absolute horror, burning, all-consuming shame, and at the same time anger against you, as though you alone were responsible for this misfortune; and all this horror, shame and anger were infinitely more intense than anything I had ever experienced while awake. You, however, fully conscious of your guilt, fled down the mountain naked as you were to find some clothes for us. Once you had disappeared I felt totally at ease. I was neither sorry for you nor worried about you, but simply glad to be alone, and I ran happily across the meadow singing: it was a tune from a dance we had listened to at the masked ball. My voice sounded absolutely wonderful, and I wished that people could hear me far down in the city. I could not see this city, but I somehow knew what it was like. It lay there far below me and was surrounded by a high wall, an utterly fantastic city hard to describe in words. Not exactly oriental, nor medieval, but rather first one and then the other, at all events a city that long ago had disappeared for ever. But suddenly I was lying stretched out on the meadow in the sunshine, appearing much more beautiful than in real life, and as I lay there a gentleman stepped out of the forest, a young man in a light fashionable suit, looking, I now realize, very like the Dane I told you about yesterday. He continued on, greeting me politely as he passed, but not paying any particular attention to me, and walked straight towards the cliff, which he started to scrutinize, as though considering how it might be scaled. At the same time I could see you as well. You were down in the lost city, hurrying from house to house, from shop to shop beneath leafy arcades, then through a sort of Turkish bazaar, buying the most gorgeous things that you could find for me: clothes, linen, shoes and jewellery; and all of this you put into a yellow leather case which seemed to have room for everything. The whole time, though, you were pursued by a motley crowd of people – I couldn’t see them, I could only hear their muffled threatening cries. And then the other man appeared again, the Dane who had stopped at the cliff face before. Again he came towards me from the forest – and I somehow knew that in the interim he had been right around the world. He looked quite different from before, yet was clearly the same person. As on the first occasion he stopped before the cliff, disappeared, then re-emerged out of the forest, disappeared again, and again came back out of the forest; this was repeated two, three or perhaps a hundred times. It was always the same person, yet always someone different, and he always greeted me as he came past, until finally he stopped short before me and looked searchingly at me. I laughed seductively, more so than ever in my life before, but when he stretched out his arms towards me I wanted to fly, yet failed to do so – and he lay down with me upon the meadow.’","""Even more than you did me,"" replied Albertina seriously, ""but, how can I explain it—in spite of the intensity of our happiness our love was also sad, as if filled with some presentiment of sorrow. Suddenly, it was morning. The meadow was light and covered with flowers, the forest glistened with dew, and over the rocky wall the sun sent down quivering rays of light. It was now time to return to the world and go among people. But something terrible happened: our clothes were gone. I was seized with unheard of terror and a shame so burning that it almost consumed me. At the same time I was angry with you, as though you were to blame for the misfortune. This sensation of terror, shame and anger was much more intense than anything I had ever felt when awake. Conscious of your guilt, you rushed away naked, to go and get clothes for us. When you had gone I was very gay. I neither felt sorry for you, nor worried about you. Delighted to be alone, I ran happily about in the meadow singing a tune we had heard at some dance. My voice had a wonderful ring and I wished that they could hear me down in the city, which I couldn't see but which nevertheless existed. It was far below me and was surrounded by a high wall, a very fantastic city which I can't describe. It was not Oriental and not exactly Old-German, and yet it seemed to be first one, and then the other. At any rate, it was a city buried a long time ago and forever. Suddenly I was lying in the meadow, stretched out in the sunlight—far more beautiful than I ever was in reality, and while I lay there, a young man wearing a light-colored fashionable suit of clothes walked out of the woods. I now realize that he looked like the Dane whom I mentioned yesterday. He walked up and spoke to me courteously as he passed, but otherwise paid no particular attention to me. He went straight to the wall of rock and looked it over carefully, as though considering how to master it. At the same time I could see you hurrying from house to house, from shop to shop in the buried city, now walking underneath arbors, then passing through a sort of Turkish bazaar. You were buying the most beautiful things you could find for me: clothes, linen, shoes, and jewelry. And then you put these things into a little hand-bag of yellow leather that held them all. You were being followed by a crowd of people whom I could not see, but I heard the sound of their threatening shouts. The Dane, who had stopped before the wall of rock a little while before, now reappeared from the woods—and apparently in the meantime he had encircled the whole globe. He looked different, but he was the same, nevertheless. He stopped before the wall of rock, vanished and came out of the woods again, appearing and disappearing two, or three, or a hundred times. It was always the same man and yet always different. He spoke to me every time he passed, and finally stopped in front of me and looked at me searchingly. I laughed seductively as I have never laughed in my life, and he held out his arms to me. I wished to escape but it was useless—and he sank down beside me on the meadow."""

"Fridolin sah, daß von einer anderen Ecke her ihn zwei Edelleute scharf ins Auge gefaßt hatten, und er vermutete, daß das Geschöpf an seiner Seite – es war knabenhaft und schlank gewachsen – zu ihm gesandt war, ihn zu prüfen und zu versuchen. Trotzdem breitete er die Arme nach ihr aus, um sie an sich zu ziehen, als ein anderes der Weiber sich von ihrem Tänzer löste und geradewegs zu Fridolin gelaufen kam. Er wußte sofort, daß es seine Warnerin von früher war. Sie stellte sich an, als erblicke sie ihn zum erstenmal, und flüsterte, doch so vernehmlich, daß man sie auch in jener anderen Ecke hören mußte: »Bist du endlich zurück?« Und heiter lachend: »Es ist alles vergeblich, du bist erkannt.« Und zu der Knabenhaften gewandt: »Laß mir ihn nur für zwei Minuten. Dann sollst du ihn gleich wieder, wenn du willst, bis zum Morgen haben.« Und leiser zu ihr, wie freudig: »Er ist es, ja, er.« Die andere erstaunt: »Wirklich?« und schwebte fort in die Ecke zu den Kavalieren.","Fridolin saw that from another corner two noblemen had eyed him sharply, and he guessed that the creature at his side - it was boyish and slender - had been sent to test and test him.

Then you can have him again, until morning if you wish.’ And then more softly to her, and as if elated, ‘It’s him, yes, him.’ With surprise, the other woman said, ‘Really?’ and glided off to join the courtiers in the other corner.","Fridolin, seeing two noblemen watch fixedly from another corner, suspected that this woman with the boyish and slender figure, was sent to put him to the test.

She pretended that she had just seen him and whispered, in a voice loud enough to be heard in the other corner: ""Returned at last!"" Laughingly, she continued: ""All your efforts are useless.

"Als er etwas ermüdet, aber in einer seltsam erlösten Stimmung, die er doch zugleich als trügerisch empfand, zu Hause anlangte, hatten Albertine und das Kind schon zu Mittag gegessen, leisteten ihm aber Gesellschaft, während er selbst sein Mahl einnahm. Da saß sie ihm gegenüber, die ihn heute nacht ruhig ans Kreuz hatte schlagen lassen, mit engelhaftem Blick, hausfraulich-mütterlich, und er verspürte zu seiner Verwunderung keinerlei Haß gegen sie. Er ließ es sich schmecken, befand sich in etwas erregter, aber eigentlich heiterer Laune, und nach seiner Art sprach er sehr lebhaft von den kleinen Berufserlebnissen des Tages, insbesondere von den ärztlichen Personalfragen, über die er Albertine immer genau zu unterrichten pflegte. Er erzählte, daß die Ernennung Hügelmanns so gut wie sicher sei, und sprach von seinem eigenen Vorsatz, die wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten wieder mit etwas größerer Energie aufzunehmen. Albertine kannte diese Stimmung, wußte, daß sie nicht allzulange anzuhalten pflegte, und ein leises Lächeln verriet ihre Zweifel. Fridolin ereiferte sich, worauf Albertine mit milder Hand ihm beruhigend über die Haare strich. Jetzt zuckte er leicht zusammen und wandte sich dem Kinde zu, wodurch er seine Stirn weiterer peinlicher Berührung entzog. Er nahm die Kleine auf den Schoß, schickte sich eben an, sie auf den Knien zu schaukeln, als das Dienstmädchen meldete, daß schon einige Patienten warteten. Fridolin erhob sich wie befreit, erwähnte noch beiläufig, daß doch Albertine und das Kind die schöne sonnige Nachmittagsstunde zum Spazierengehen benützen sollten, und begab sich in sein Sprechzimmer.","When he got home, somewhat tired but in a strangely relieved mood, which he found at the same time deceptive, Albertine and the child had already eaten lunch, but kept him company while he ate his own meal. There she sat across from him, who had quietly had him crucified last night, with angelic eyes, like a motherly housewife, and to his amazement he felt no hatred for her. He savored it, was in a somewhat excited but actually cheerful mood, and, as was his way, he spoke very animatedly of the little professional events of the day, especially of the medical personnel questions, about which he was always in the habit of briefing Albertine in detail. He said that Hügelmann's appointment was as good as certain and spoke of his own resolution to resume scientific work with a little more energy. Albertine knew this mood, knew that it didn't last long, and a faint smile betrayed her doubts. Fridolin got excited, whereupon Albertine stroked his hair soothingly with a gentle hand. Now he winced slightly and turned to the child, withdrawing his forehead from further embarrassing touch. He took the little one on his lap and was about to rock her on his knees when the maid announced that some patients were already waiting. Fridolin got up as if relieved, casually mentioned that Albertine and the child should use the beautiful sunny afternoon to go for a walk, and went to his office.","When he reached home a little tired, yet in a strange mood of release which at the same time he felt to be deceptive, Albertine and the child had already had their lunch, but kept him company while he ate his meal. There, sitting opposite him, was the woman who last night would have calmly had him crucified, now looking angelic, domesticated and maternal, and to his surprise he felt no hatred for her whatsoever. Savouring his food, he found himself in an excitable but also more light-hearted mood and, as was his wont, talked animatedly about the day’s little professional incidents, dwelling particularly on matters to do with medical personnel, which he was accustomed to relay to Albertine in detail. He explained that the nomination of Hügelmann was as good as certain, and mentioned his own resolve to resume research more vigorously. Albertine was familiar with these moods, and knew that they tended not to last that long, and a smile betrayed her scepticism. Fridolin became more enthusiastic, and Albertine gently stroked his hair to soothe him. He winced slightly and turned towards the child, thus evading further painful contact. He lifted the child on to his lap, and was beginning to rock her on his knees when the maid announced that several patients were already waiting. As if released, Fridolin stood up and, observing casually that Albertine and the child ought to take advantage of the beautiful sunny afternoon and go out for a walk, entered his consulting-room.","He went home, feeling rather tired but with a strange sense of security which somehow seemed deceptive. Albertina and the child had finished their dinner, but they kept him company while he ate his meal. There she sat opposite him, the woman who had calmly allowed him to be crucified the preceding night. She was sitting there with an angelic look, like a good housewife and mother, and to his surprise he did not hate her. He enjoyed his meal, being in an excited, cheerful mood, and, as he usually did, gave a very lively account of the little professional incidents of the day. He mentioned especially the gossip about the doctors, about whom he always kept Albertina well informed. He told her that the appointment of Hugelmann was as good as settled, and then spoke pf his own determination to take up scientific work again with greater energy. Albertina knew this mood. She also knew that it usually didn't last very long and betrayed her doubts by a slight smile. When Fridolin became quite warm on the subject, she gently smoothed his hair to calm him. He started slightly and turned to the child, so as to remove his forehead from the embarrassing touch. He took the little girl on his lap and was just beginning to dance her up and down, when the maid announced that several patients were waiting. Fridolin rose with a sigh of relief, suggesting to Albertina that she and the child ought to go for a walk on such a beautiful, sunny afternoon, and went to his consulting room."

"Albertine öffnete noch immer nicht die Augen, Fridolin glaubte zu sehen, wie ihr Mund, ihre Stirn, ihr ganzes Antlitz mit beglücktem, verklärtem, unschuldsvollem Ausdruck lächelte, und er fühlte einen ihm selbst unbegreiflichen Drang, sich über Albertine zu beugen und auf ihre blasse Stirn einen Kuß zu drücken.

"Er fand sich, mit einem Male, schon über sein Ziel hinaus in einer engen Gasse, durch die nur ein paar armselige Dirnen auf nächtlichem Männerfang umherstrichen. Gespenstisch, dachte er. Und auch die Studenten mit den blauen Kappen wurden ihm plötzlich gespenstisch in der Erinnerung, ebenso Marianne, ihr Verlobter, Onkel und Tante, die er sich nun alle, Hand in Hand, um das Totenbett des alten Hofrats gereiht vorstellte; auch Albertine, die ihm nun im Geist als tief Schlafende, die Arme unter dem Nacken verschränkt, vorschwebte – sogar sein Kind, das jetzt zusammengerollt in dem schmalen weißen Messingbettchen lag, und das rotbäckige Fräulein mit dem Muttermal an der linken Schläfe –, sie alle waren ihm völlig ins Gespenstische entrückt. Und in dieser Empfindung, obzwar sie ihn ein wenig schaudern machte, war zugleich etwas Beruhigendes, das ihn von aller Verantwortung zu befreien, ja aus jeder menschlichen Beziehung zu lösen schien.","Suddenly he found himself already beyond his goal in a narrow street through which only a few miserable prostitutes roamed about nightly chasing men. Spooky, he thought. And the students with the blue caps suddenly became ghostly in his memory, as did Marianne, her fiancé, uncle, and aunt, all of whom he now imagined hand in hand, lined up around the deathbed of the old privy councillor; also Albertine, who now floated before him in his mind as a sound sleeper, her arms folded behind her neck - even his child, who was now curled up in the narrow white brass bed, and the rosy-cheeked young lady with the birthmark on her left temple - all of them were completely removed from him into the ghostly. And in this sensation, although it made him shudder a little, there was something reassuring at the same time that seemed to free him from all responsibility, even from every human relationship.","Suddenly he found himself well beyond his intended destination, in a narrow street where only a few wretched whores were strolling on their nightly man-hunt. Like ghosts, he thought. And in his memory the students too, with their blue caps, suddenly seemed ghost-like, as did Marianne with her fiancé, uncle and aunt, whom he now imagined sitting hand in hand around the old Court Counsellor’s deathbed; Albertine too, who floated before his mind’s eye as she might appear when in deep sleep, her arms tucked beneath her neck, even his child, who lay curled up in her narrow white brass bed, and the rosy-cheeked maid with the mole on her left temple – to him they had all withdrawn into the realm of ghosts. And although this made him shudder a little, there was also something soothing about this feeling, which seemed to release him from all responsibility, indeed from all connection with humanity.","He suddenly discovered that he had passed his destination. He was in a narrow street in which only a few doubtful-looking women were strolling about in a pitiful attempt to bag their game. It's phantomlike, he thought. And in retrospect the students, too, with their blue caps, suddenly seemed unreal. The same was true of Marianne, her fiance, her uncle and aunt, all of whom he pictured standing hand in hand around the deathbed of the old Councilor. Albertina, too, whom he could see in his mind's eye soundly sleeping, her arms folded under her head—even his child lying in the narrow white brass bed, rolled up in a heap, and the red-cheeked governess with the mole on her left temple—all of them seemed to belong to another world. Although this idea made him shudder a bit, it also reassured him, for it seemed to free him from all responsibility, and to loosen all the bonds of human relationship."

And when she raised her head a little, without, however, looking at Fridolin, he continued: ""I suppose your fiance will soon get a professorship.

"Trotzdem er die Nachmittagsvisite abgesagt hatte, zog es ihn doch unwiderstehlich auf die Abteilung. Es lagen zwei Fälle dort, die für die wissenschaftliche Arbeit, die er vor allem plante, besonders in Betracht kamen, und er beschäftigte sich eine Weile eingehender mit ihnen, als er es bisher getan. Dann hatte er noch einen Krankenbesuch in der inneren Stadt zu erledigen, und so war es sieben Uhr abends geworden, als er vor dem alten Hause in der Schreyvogelgasse stand. Nun erst, da er zu Mariannens Fenster aufblickte, wurde ihm ihr Bild, das indes völlig verblaßt war, noch mehr als das aller anderen wieder lebendig. Nun – hier konnte es ihm nicht fehlen. Ohne Aufwand besonderer Mühe konnte er hier sein Rachewerk beginnen, hier gab es für ihn keine Schwierigkeit, keine Gefahr; und das, wovor andere vielleicht zurückgeschreckt wären, der Verrat an dem Bräutigam, das bedeutete für ihn beinahe einen Anreiz mehr. Ja, verraten, betrügen, lügen, Komödie spielen, da und dort, vor Marianne, vor Albertine, vor diesem guten Doktor Roediger, vor der ganzen Welt; – eine Art von Doppelleben führen, zugleich der tüchtige, verläßliche, zukunftsreiche Arzt, der brave Gatte und Familienvater sein – und zugleich ein Wüstling, ein Verführer, ein Zyniker, der mit den Menschen, mit Männern und Frauen spielte, wie ihm just die Laune ankam – das erschien ihm in diesem Augenblick als etwas ganz Köstliches; – und das Köstlichste dran war, daß er später einmal, wenn Albertine sich schon längst in der Sicherheit eines ruhigen Ehe-und Familienlebens geborgen wähnte, ihr kühl lächelnd alle seine Sünden eingestehen wollte, um so Vergeltung zu üben für das, was sie ihm in einem Traume Bitteres und Schmachvolles angetan hatte.","Despite canceling the afternoon rounds, he was irresistibly drawn to the department. There were two cases there that were particularly relevant to the scientific work that he was primarily planning, and for a while he occupied himself with them more closely than he had hitherto done. Then he still had to visit the sick in the inner city, and it was seven o'clock in the evening when he stood in front of the old house on Schreyvogelgasse. Only now, when he looked up at Mariana's window, did her image, which was completely faded, come to life again more than that of all the others. Well – here he could not fail. Here he could begin his work of vengeance without any special effort, there was no difficulty, no danger for him here; and what others might have shrunk from, the betrayal of the bridegroom, that was almost an incentive for him. Yes, betray, cheat, lie, play comedy, here and there, in front of Marianne, in front of Albertine, in front of that good Doctor Roediger, in front of the whole world; - lead a kind of double life, being at the same time the competent, reliable, future-oriented doctor, the good husband and father of a family - and at the same time a libertine, a seducer, a cynic who played with people, with men and women, just as he felt like it arrived - that seemed to him at that moment to be something very delicious; - and the best thing about it was that later, when Albertine had long felt secure in the security of a quiet married and family life, he wanted to confess all his sins to her with a cool smile, in order to take revenge for what she had done to him had done something bitter and shameful to a dream.","Even though he had excused himself from the afternoon rounds, he found himself irresistibly drawn to the clinic. There were two cases that were particularly relevant to his more immediate research plans, and for a while he occupied himself with them more intensively than he had previously done. Then he had one more call to attend to in the centre of town, so that by the time he found himself outside the old house in the Schreyvogelgasse it was already seven in the evening. Only then, as he looked up at Marianne’s window, did her image, which had faded more than that of all the others in the interim, come to life again. Here at least he would not go unrequited. Here he could begin his work of vengeance without too much trouble; here there were no difficulties and no danger; and the betrayal of a bridegroom which might have given others pause was for him merely an additional inducement. Indeed, the idea of betrayal, lying, infidelity and a bit of hanky-panky here and there, all under the noses of Marianne, Albertine, the good Dr Roediger, all the world – the thought of leading a kind of double life, of being at once a hard-working reliable progressive doctor, a decent husband, family man and father, and at the same time a profligate, seducer and cynic who played with men and women as his whim dictated – this prospect seemed to him at that moment peculiarly agreeable. And the most agreeable thing of all about it was that later on, when Albertine imagined herself secure in the haven of her tranquil conjugal and family life, he would be able to smile coldly and confess his sins to her, and thus get even for all the bitterness and shame she had brought upon him in her dream.","Although he had excused himself from his afternoon duties at the hospital, he felt irresistibly drawn to his ward. There were two cases there of special importance to the piece of research he was planning. He was busy for some time making a more detailed study of them than he had yet done, and following that he still had to visit a patient in the heart of the city. It was already seven o'clock in the evening when he stood before the old house in Schreyvogel Strasse. As he looked up at Marianne's window, her image, which had completely faded from his mind, was revived—more clearly than that of all the others. Well— there was no chance of failure here. He could begin his work of vengeance without any special exertion and with little difficulty or danger. What might have deterred others, the betrayal of her fiance, only made him keener. Yes, to betray, to deceive, to lie, to play a part, before Marianne, before Albertina, before the good Doctor Roediger, before the whole world. To lead a sort of double life, to be the capable, reliable physician with a future before him, the upright husband and head of a family. And at the same time a libertine, a seducer, a cynic who played with people, with men and women, just as the spirit moved him— that seemed to him, at the time, very delightful. And the most delightful part was that at some future time, long after Albertina fancied herself secure in the peacefulness of marriage and of—family life—he would confess to her, with a superior smile, all of his sins, in retribution for the bitter and shameful things she had committed against him in a dream."
Und sie erzählte:,And she said:,"And she continued, ‘It was on the Wörthersee, shortly before our engagement, Fridolin, when one beautiful summer evening an extremely handsome youth appeared outside my window, which looked out over broad extensive meadows.",But she continued:
"Der Wagen stand still. Wie wär's, dachte Fridolin, wenn ich gar nicht erst ausstiege – sondern lieber gleich zurückkehrte? Aber wohin? Zu der kleinen Pierrette? Oder zu dem Dirnchen in der Buchfeldgasse? Oder zu Marianne, der Tochter des Verstorbenen? Oder nach Hause? Und mit einem leichten Schauer empfand er, daß er nirgendshin sich weniger sehnte als gerade dorthin. Oder war es, weil dieser Weg ihn der weiteste dünkte? Nein, ich kann nicht zurück, dachte er bei sich. Weiter meinen Weg, und wär's mein Tod. Er lachte selbst zu dem großen Wort, aber sehr heiter war ihm dabei nicht zumut.","The car stopped. How about, thought Fridolin, if I didn't even get out of the car, but would rather come back straight away? But where? To little Pierrette? Or to the wench in Buchfeldgasse? Or to Marianne, the daughter of the deceased? Or home? And with a slight shudder he realized that he longed for nowhere less than right there. Or was it because this path seemed the farthest to him? No, I can't go back, he thought to himself. Continue my way, even if it were my death. He laughed at the big word himself, but he didn't feel very cheerful about it.","The coach came to a halt. Suppose, thought Fridolin, I didn’t get out at all – and drove back at once instead? But where to? To the little Pierrette? Or to the little trollop in the Buchfeldgasse? Or to Marianne, the daughter of the dead Court Counsellor? Or home? And with a slight shudder he realized that there was nowhere he wanted to go less. Or was it because that path seemed more circuitous to him? No, I can’t go back, he thought to himself. My way lies forward, even were it to my death. He couldn’t help laughing at these melodramatic notions, but even so he did not feel altogether at his ease.","His cab stopped. What if I don't get out at all, Fridolin thought, and go back at once? But go where? To little Pierrette? To the girl in Buchfeld Strasse? Or to Marianne, the daughter of the deceased? Or perhaps home? He shuddered slightly and decided he'd rather go anywhere than home. Was it because it was farthest to go? No, I can't turn back, he thought. I must go through with this, even if it means death. And he laughed at himself, using such a big word but without feeling very cheerful about it."
"»Wieso gehört? – Ach ja!« Und nun erst kam es Fridolin zu Bewußtsein, daß er während seines Eintretens, ja schon früher, als er sich dem Kaffeehaus genähert, aus irgendeiner Kellertiefe Klavierspiel heraufklingen gehört hatte. »Also das warst du?« rief er aus.","»Why heard? Oh yes!' And only then did Fridolin become aware that as he entered, indeed even earlier, when he was approaching the coffee house, he had heard the piano playing coming up from somewhere in the basement. ""So that was you?"" he exclaimed.","‘How do you mean, hear you? – Ah, I see!’ And for the first time Fridolin became conscious of the fact that, as he had entered, indeed even earlier as he had approached the coffee-house , he had heard a piano playing from somewhere in the depths of the establishment. ‘ So that was you?’ he exclaimed.","""What do you mean—hear you?—Why, of course."" Suddenly it occurred to him that someone had been playing the piano when he entered; in fact, he had heard music coming from some basement as he approached the cafe. "" So that was you playing? "" he exclaimed."
"»Ein anderer, wer immer es gewesen wäre, er hätte sagen können, was er wollte – es hätte ihm wenig geholfen. Und wärst nicht du es gewesen, der vor dem Fenster stand« – sie lächelte zu ihm auf –, »dann wäre wohl auch der Sommerabend nicht so schön gewesen.«","'Another, whoever it might have been, could have said what he liked - it would have done him little good. And if it hadn't been you standing in front of the window' - she smiled up at him - 'then the summer evening wouldn't have been so nice either.'","‘Anyone else, whoever it might have been, could have said what he liked, it would have been to little avail. And if you hadn’t been the one to stand before my window,’ she said, smiling up at him, ‘then the summer evening wouldn’t have been so lovely either.’","""Any other man—no matter who—could have said anything he liked—it would have been useless. And if it hadn't been you standing by the window, then very likely the summer evening wouldn't have been so beautiful."" And she smiled at him."
"»Und wie oft«, fragte Albertine, vor sich hinsehend und ohne jede Betonung, »bist du nachher noch denselben Weg gegangen?«","""And how often,"" asked Albertine, looking straight ahead and without any emphasis, ""did you go the same way afterwards?""","‘And how often,’ asked Albertine flatly, looking straight ahead, ‘did you later follow the same path?’","With her eyes cast down and in a monotonous voice, Albertina asked: ""And how often did you see her after that?"""
"Zweite Warnung? Wieso? Ach ja, in der Nacht war die erste an ihn ergangen. Warum aber zweite – und nicht letzte? Wollten sie seinen Mut nochmals erproben? Sollte er eine Prüfung zu bestehen haben? Und woher kannten sie seinen Namen? Nun, das war weiter nicht sonderbar, wahrscheinlich hatte man Nachtigall gezwungen, ihn zu verraten. Und überdies – er lächelte unwillkürlich über seine Zerstreutheit – im Futter seines Pelzes war sein Monogramm und seine genaue Adresse eingenäht.","Second warning? How so? Oh yes, the first one had come to him during the night. But why second – and not last? Did they want to try his courage again? Should he have to pass an exam? And how did they know his name? Well, that wasn't strange, Nightingale had probably been forced to betray him. And besides - he smiled involuntarily at his absentmindedness - his monogram and his exact address were sewn into the lining of his fur.","A second warning? Why? Ah, yes, the first had been the one issued to him the previous night. But why a second – and not a final warning? Did they want to try his courage yet again? Did he have to pass some sort of test? And how did they know his name? There was nothing strange about that, they had probably forced Nachtigall to reveal it. And besides – he smiled at his own forgetfulness – his monogram and full address were sewn into the lining of his coat.","Second warning—? How was that? Oh yes, he had received the first one during the night. But why second warning—and not the last? Did they want to try his courage once more? Was he to pass a test? And how did they know his name? Well, that wasn't difficult. They had probably forced Nachtigall to tell. And besides—he smiled at his absent-mindedness—his monogram and his full address were sewn into the lining of his fur coat."
"»Unmeglich, zu gefährlich.«","""Impossible, too dangerous.""",‘Impossible. Too dangerous.’,"""Impossible. It's too dangerous."""
»Weißt du das auch ganz gewiß?« fragte er.,"""Are you sure of that?"" he asked.",‘Are you quite sure of that?’ he asked.,"""Are you quite sure of that?"" he asked."
"»Ah«, sagte Fridolin und wollte eine Art Glückwunsch anbringen, aber das schien ihm wenig angemessen in diesem Augenblick und in dieser Umgebung. Er warf einen Blick nach dem geschlossenen Fenster und, ohne vorher um Erlaubnis zu fragen, wie in Ausübung eines ärztlichen Rechtes öffnete er beide Flügel und ließ die Luft herein, die, indes noch wärmer und frühlingshafter geworden, einen linden Duft aus den erwachenden fernen Wäldern mitzubringen schien. Als er sich wieder ins Zimmer wandte, sah er die Augen Mariannens wie fragend auf sich gerichtet. Er trat näher zu ihr hin und bemerkte: »Die frische Luft wird Ihnen hoffentlich wohl tun. Es ist geradezu warm geworden, und gestern nacht« – er wollte sagen: fuhren wir im Schneegestöber von der Redoute nach Hause, aber er formte rasch den Satz um und ergänzte: »Gestern abend lag der Schnee noch einen halben Meter hoch in den Straßen.«","""Ah,"" said Fridolin, wanting to offer a kind of congratulations, but that didn't seem appropriate at the moment and in these surroundings. He glanced at the closed window and, without first asking permission, as if exercising a medical right, opened both wings and let in the air, which, however, had become even warmer and more spring-like, smelling a faint scent from the distant awakening woods seemed to bring. When he turned back into the room, he saw Mariana's eyes fixed on him as if questioning. Stepping closer to her, he remarked, 'I hope the fresh air will do you good. It has gotten really warm, and last night' - he wanted to say: we drove home from the redoubt in a snowstorm, but he quickly rephrased the sentence and added: 'Last night there was still half a meter of snow in the streets. «","‘Ah,’ said Fridolin, and wanted to congratulate her in some way, but this hardly seemed the appropriate moment. He glanced at the closed window and, as if exercising his prerogative as a physician, opened both wings without asking her permission and let in the breeze, which, having by now become even warmer and more springlike, seemed to bring with it a mild fragrance from the distant wakening woods. When he turned back towards the room, he saw Marianne’s eyes turned on him questioningly. He moved closer to her and remarked, ‘The fresh air will do you good, I hope. It’s become quite warm, and last night –’ He was going to say: we drove home from the masked ball in a flurry of snow, but he hastily reformulated his sentence and concluded, ‘Last night the snow in the streets was still half a metre deep.’","""Oh,"" said Fridolin, and was about to congratulate her but it seemed rather out of place at the moment. He glanced at the closed window, and without asking for permission but availing himself of his privilege as a doctor, he opened both casements and let some air in. It had become even warmer and more spring-like, and the breeze seemed to bring with it a slight fragrance of the distant awakening woods. When he turned back into the room, he saw Marianne's eyes fixed upon him with a questioning look. He moved nearer to her and said: ""I hope the fresh air will be good for you. It has become quite warm, and last night""—he was about to say: we drove home from the masquerade in a snowstorm, but he quickly changed the sentence and continued: ""Last night the snow was still lying on the streets a foot and a half deep."""
"Die Junge nannte ihm den Namen eines Professors, auf dessen Klinik Fridolin vor einigen Jahren Sekundararzt gewesen war. Und dann fügte sie gutmütig hinzu: »Geben S' es her, die Packerln, ich bring ihr's morgen. Können sich drauf verlassen, daß ich nichts wegnaschen werde. Und grüßen werd' ich sie auch von Ihnen und ihr ausrichten, Sie sein ihr nicht untreu worden.«","The boy gave him the name of a professor at whose clinic Fridolin had been a junior doctor a few years before. And then she added good-naturedly: ""Give it to me, the packers, I'll bring it to her tomorrow. You can rest assured that I won't nibble anything. And I'll say hello to you and her too, you haven't been unfaithful to her.""","The young woman mentioned that of a professor under whom Fridolin had studied several years ago. Then she added good-naturedly, ‘Let me have the little parcel , I’ll bring it her tomorrow. You can trust me not to nibble. And I’ll be sure to send your greetings and to tell her you’ve been true to her.’","The younger woman mentioned the name of a professor in whose clinic Fridolin had been an assistant several years before, and added good-naturedly: ""Just let me have those packages, I'll take them to her tomorrow. And I promise that I won't snitch any of it. I'll give her your regards too and tell her that you're still true to her."""
Fridolin sah vor sich hin. »Es sind wohl – die Verwandten bei Fräulein Marianne?«,"Fridolin looked straight ahead. ""They are probably - the relatives at Fraulein Marianne's?""",Fridolin looked straight ahead. ‘The relatives – are they still with Marianne?’,"Fridolin looked down. ""I suppose— Fraulein Marianne's relatives are with her?"""
"»Sie lassen mich lange warten«, sagte sie mit einem schwachen Lächeln.","""You keep me waiting a long time,"" she said with a faint smile.","‘You’ve taken your time coming,’ she said with a wan smile.","""You made me wait a long time,"" she said, smiling feebly."
»Du bestehst also darauf?«,"""So you insist?""",‘So you insist?’,"""You insist on knowing it?"""
"Und wie er so weiterging und doch unwillkürlich die Richtung nach seiner Wohnung zu nahm, geriet er in die Nähe der dunklen, ziemlich verrufenen Gasse, in der er vor weniger als vierundzwanzig Stunden einem verlorenen Geschöpf nach ihrer armseligen und doch traulichen Behausung gefolgt war. Verloren, gerade die? Und gerade diese Gasse verrufen? Wie man doch immer wieder, durch Worte verführt, Straßen, Schicksale, Menschen in träger Gewohnheit benennt und beurteilt. War dieses junge Mädchen nicht im Grunde von allen, mit denen seltsame Zufälle ihn in der letzten Nacht zusammengeführt, das anmutigste, ja geradezu das reinste gewesen? Er fühlte einige Rührung, wenn er ihrer dachte. Und nun erinnerte er sich auch seines Vorsatzes von gestern; rasch entschlossen kaufte er im nächsten Laden allerlei Eßbares ein; und als er mit dem kleinen Päckchen die Häusermauern entlangschritt, fühlte er sich geradezu froh in dem Bewußtsein, daß er im Begriffe war, eine zum mindesten vernünftige, vielleicht sogar lobenswerte Handlung zu begehen. Immerhin schlug er den Kragen hoch, als er in den Hausflur trat, nahm beim Treppensteigen einige Stufen auf einmal, die Wohnungsglocke tönte ihm mit unerwünschter Schrille ins Ohr; und als er von einer übel aussehenden Frauensperson den Bescheid erhielt, daß das Fräulein Mizzi nicht zu Hause sei, atmete er auf. Doch ehe die Frau noch Gelegenheit hatte, das Päckchen für die Abwesende in Empfang zu nehmen, trat ein anderes, noch junges, nicht unhübsches Frauenzimmer, in eine Art von Bademantel gehüllt, ins Vorzimmer und sagte: »Wen sucht der Herr? Die Fräuln Mizzi? Die wird so bald nicht z'haus kommen.«","And as he went on, yet involuntarily taking the direction of his dwelling, he came near the dark, rather infamous alley in which less than twenty-four hours before he had followed a lost creature to her miserable yet cozy dwelling. Lost, just those? And just this alley notorious? How, again and again, seduced by words, one names and judges roads, destinies, people in lazy habit. Hadn't this young girl been the loveliest, even the purest, of all those with whom strange coincidences had brought him last night? He felt some emotion when he thought of her. And now he also remembered his resolution from yesterday; Quickly determined, he bought all kinds of edibles in the nearest store; and as he walked along the walls of the house with the little package, he felt positively glad, knowing that he was about to do something at least reasonable, perhaps even commendable. At least he turned up his collar when he stepped into the hallway, took the stairs a few at a time, the apartment bell rang with an unwanted shrillness in his ear; and when he received the news from a nasty-looking woman that Fraulein Mizzi wasn't at home, he breathed a sigh of relief. But before the woman had a chance to receive the package for the absent woman, another woman, still young and not unpretty, came into the hall, wrapped in a kind of bathrobe, and said: ""Who is the gentleman looking for? Miss Mizzi? She won't be coming home anytime soon.""","And as he wandered on, unconsciously heading in the direction of his apartment, he found himself not far from the dark, rather disreputable street where less than twenty-four hours ago he had followed that abandoned creature to her tawdry yet comfortable lodgings. But why should she particularly be thought of as abandoned? Or this particular street be called disreputable? Curious how, seduced by words, again and again one labels and condemns people, destinies and streets through sheer idle force of habit. Hadn’t that young girl been the most charming and even the purest of all those with whom the strange circumstances of the previous evening had brought him into contact? He felt himself becoming a little aroused as he thought of her. Then he also recollected his intentions on the previous day and, quickly making up his mind, went into the next shop to purchase various dainty things to eat. He continued on close to the walls of the houses with his little parcel, feeling almost happy at the thought that he was about to do something sensible and even perhaps praiseworthy. Despite this, however, he turned up his collar as he stepped into the entrance hall and ran up the stairs several steps at a time. The apartment doorbell resounded in his ears with an unpleasant shrillness, and when he was informed by an evil-looking woman that Mizzi was not at home, he breathed a sigh of relief. But before the woman had a chance to accept the package for the absent girl, another youngish, not unattractive woman wrapped in a sort of dressing-gown came out into the hall and said, ‘Who’re you looking for, sir? Mizzi? She won’t be back in a hurry.’","While Fridolin wandered along, drifting aimlessly towards his home, he entered the neighborhood of the dark, rather questionable street, where he had accompanied the forlorn little girl to her humble room less than twenty-four hours before. Why was she ""forlorn?"" And why was just this street ""questionable?"" Isn't it strange how we are misled by words , how we give names to streets, events and people, and form judgments about them, just because we are too lazy to change our habits? Wasn't this young girl in reality the most charming, if not actually the purest of all those with whom he had come in contact during the past night? He felt rather touched when he thought of her, and remembering his plan of the night before, he turned into the nearest store and bought all kinds of delicacies. Walking along with his package, the consciousness of performing an act which was at least sensible, and perhaps actually laudable, made him feel glad. Nevertheless, he turned up his coat collar when he stepped into the hallway and went upstairs several steps at a time. The bell of the apartment rang with unwelcome shrillness and he felt relieved when a disreputable looking woman informed him that Fraulein Mizzi was not at home. But before the woman had an opportunity of taking charge of the package for Mizzi, another woman joined them. She was still young and not bad-looking, and had on a sort of bath-robe. ""Whom are you looking for?"" she said, ""Fraulein Mizzi? Well, she won't be home again for some time."""

"Er trat in ein Café, eines der vornehmeren, stilleren in der Nähe des Rathauses, telephonierte nach Hause, daß man ihn zum Abendessen nicht erwarten solle, läutete rasch ab, damit nicht etwa Albertine noch ans Telephon käme, dann setzte er sich an ein Fenster und zog den Vorhang zu. In einer entfernten Ecke nahm eben ein Herr Platz; in dunklem Überzieher, auch sonst ganz unauffällig gekleidet. Fridolin erinnerte sich, diese Physiognomie im Laufe dieses Tages schon irgendwo gesehen zu haben. Das konnte natürlich auch Zufall sein. Er nahm ein Abendblatt zur Hand und las, so wie er es gestern nacht in einem anderen Kaffeehaus getan, da und dort ein paar Zeilen: Berichte über politische Ereignisse, Theater, Kunst, Literatur, über kleine und große Unglücksfälle aller Art. In irgendeiner Stadt Amerikas, deren Namen er niemals gehört hatte, war ein Theater abgebrannt. Der Rauchfangkehrermeister Peter Korand hatte sich zum Fenster hinausgestürzt. Es kam Fridolin irgendwie sonderbar vor, daß auch Rauchfangkehrer sich zuweilen umbrachten, und er fragte sich unwillkürlich, ob der Mann sich vorher ordentlich gewaschen oder schwarz, wie er war, ins Nichts gestürzt hatte. In einem vornehmen Hotel der inneren Stadt hatte sich heute früh eine Frau vergiftet, eine Dame, die unter dem Namen einer Baronin D. vor wenigen Tagen dort abgestiegen war, eine auffallend hübsche Dame. Fridolin fühlte sich sofort ahnungsvoll berührt. Die Dame war morgens um vier Uhr in Begleitung zweier Herren nach Hause gekommen, die am Tore sich von ihr verabschiedeten. Vier Uhr. Gerade zu der Stunde, da auch er nach Hause gekommen war. Und gegen Mittag war sie bewußtlos – so hieß es weiter – mit den Anzeichen einer schweren Vergiftung im Bette aufgefunden worden... Eine auffallend hübsche junge Dame... Nun, es gab manche auffallend hübsche junge Damen... Es war kein Anlaß, anzunehmen, daß die Baronin D., vielmehr die Dame, die unter dem Namen Baronin D. in dem Hotel abgestiegen war, und eine gewisse andere ein und dieselbe Person vorstellen. Und doch – ihm klopfte das Herz, und das Blatt bebte in seiner Hand. In einem vornehmen Stadthotel... in welchem? Warum so geheimnisvoll? – So diskret?...","He went into a café, one of the smarter, quieter ones near the town hall, phoned home that he shouldn't be expected for supper, rang off the bell quickly so that Albertine wouldn't come to the phone, then sat down by a window and drew the curtain. A gentleman was just sitting down in a far corner; in a dark overcoat, otherwise dressed quite unobtrusively. Fridolin remembered having seen this physiognomy somewhere earlier that day. Of course, that could also be a coincidence. He picked up an evening paper and read, as he had done last night in another coffee house, a few lines here and there: reports on political events, theatre, art, literature, on small and large accidents of all kinds. In any town Americas, whose names he had never heard, had a theater burned down. The master chimney sweep Peter Korand had thrown himself out of the window. It seemed strange to Fridolin that chimney sweeps sometimes killed themselves too, and he couldn't help wondering whether the man had washed himself properly beforehand or, black as he was, fallen into the void. In an elegant hotel in the inner city a woman had poisoned herself this morning, a lady who had stayed there a few days earlier under the name of Baroness D., a remarkably pretty lady. Fridolin was immediately touched with foreboding. The lady had come home at four o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two gentlemen who said goodbye to her at the gate. Four o'clock. Just at the hour when he, too, had come home. And around noon she was found unconscious - so it was said - with signs of severe poisoning in bed... A strikingly pretty young lady... Well, there were many strikingly pretty young ladies... There was no reason It can be assumed that the Baroness D., or rather the lady who had stayed at the hotel under the name of Baroness D., and a certain other person represent one and the same person. And yet - his heart was pounding and the sheet of paper trembled in his hand. In a posh city hotel... which one? Why so mysterious? – So discreet?...","He entered a coffee-house, one of the quieter, more formal ones near the town hall, telephoned to say that they should not expect him home for supper, hastily rang off lest Albertine should come to the phone, and then took a window seat and drew the curtain. A gentleman inconspicuously dressed in a dark overcoat sat down in a remote corner of the room. Fridolin remembered having seen his features somewhere before during the day. That could of course have been mere coincidence. He picked up an evening paper and read a few lines here and there, as he had done the previous evening in another coffee-house: reports on political events, the theatre, art, literature and all sorts of misadventures, large and small. In some town in America he had never heard of a theatre had burned down. Peter Korand, a master sweep, had thrown himself out of a window. To Fridolin it somehow seemed odd that even chimney-sweeps should commit suicide occasionally, and he couldn’t help asking himself whether the man had had a proper wash beforehand, or simply plunged into oblivion all blackened as he was. In a fashionable hotel in the centre of the city a woman had taken poison: a lady who had checked in there a few days before under the name of Baroness D., a lady of quite remarkable beauty… Well there were so many remarkably beautiful young ladies … There was no reason to assume that Baroness D., or rather the lady who had checked in to the hotel under the name of Baroness D., and the person he was thinking of were one and the same.

He telephoned home not to expect him for supper, and hung up the receiver quickly so that Albertina wouldn't have a chance to come to the phone. Then he sat down by a window and drew the curtain. A man had just taken a seat in a distant corner. He wore a dark overcoat and inconspicuous clothes and Fridolin thought he had seen his face before, during the day. It might, of course, be just a fancy. He picked up an evening paper, read a few lines here and there, just as he had done the night before in a different place. Reports on political events, articles on the theatre, art and literature, accounts of accidents and disasters. In some city that he had never heard of in the United States a theatre had burned down. Peter Korand, a chimney-sweep, had thrown himself out of a window. Somehow, it seemed strange to Fridolin that even chimney-sweeps occasionally commit suicide. Involuntarily he wondered whether the man had first washed himself properly or whether he had plunged into nothingness just as he was, black and dirty. A woman had taken poison that morning in a fashionable hotel in the heart of the city. She was an unusually good-looking woman and had registered there a few days before under the name of Baroness D. At once Fridolin felt a strange presentiment. The woman had returned to the hotel at four o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two men who had left her at the door. Four o'clock! That was exactly the time that he, too, had reached home. About noontime—the account continued —she had been found unconscious in her bed with every indication of serious poisoning... An unusually good-looking woman... Well, there were many unusually good-looking women... There was no reason to believe that Baroness D., or rather the woman who had registered as such, and a certain other person, were one and the same.

"»Für mich?« fragte er stockend. Der Diener nickte, wandte sich, ging, und die Haustür fiel hinter ihm zu. Was bedeutet das? fragte sich Fridolin. Am Ende von ihr? Sie ist es vielleicht selbst, der das Haus gehört? Rasch schritt er wieder die Straße aufwärts, jetzt erst merkte er, daß auf dem Kuvert sein Name stand in steiler, hoheitsvoller Schrift. An der Ecke öffnete er den Brief, entfaltete ein Blatt und las: »Geben Sie Ihre Nachforschungen auf, die völlig nutzlos sind, und betrachten Sie diese Worte als zweite Warnung. Wir hoffen in Ihrem Interesse, daß keine weitere nötig sein wird.« Er ließ das Blatt sinken.","""For me?"" he asked haltingly. The servant nodded, turned and left, and the front door slammed shut behind him. What does that mean? Fridolin wondered. At the end of her? Is it perhaps she herself who owns the house? He walked quickly up the street again, only now did he notice that his name was written on the envelope in steep, majestic letters. He opened the letter at the corner, unfolded a sheet of paper and read: 'Give up your research, which is utterly useless, and take these words as a second warning. We hope, in your interest, that no more will be necessary.' He lowered the paper.","‘For me?’ he asked hesitantly. The servant nodded, turned and withdrew, and the front door closed behind him. What can this mean? Fridolin asked himself. Perhaps it’s from her? Perhaps she is the one who owns the house? He walked quickly back up the street and only then noticed that his name was written on the envelope in imperious Gothic lettering. At the corner he opened the letter, unfolded the sheet and read, ‘Give up your investigations, which are completely futile, and consider this a second warning. We hope, for your sake, that a further one will not be necessary.’ He let the note fall to his side.","""For me?"" he asked, hesitantly. The servant nodded, went back to the house, and the door closed behind him. What does that mean? Fridolin asked himself. Can it possibly be from her? Does she, herself, own the house? He walked back up the street quickly and it was only then that he noticed his name on the envelope in large, dignified letters. He opened it, unfolded a sheet and read the following: Give up your inquiries which are perfectly useless, and consider these words a second warning. We hope, for your own good, that this will be sufficient. This message disappointed him in every respect, but at any rate it was different from what he had foolishly expected."
"Er bat Herrn Doktor Fuchstaler, die Ambulanz zu leiten, und mußte sich gestehen, daß er lieber hier geblieben als auf den Galitzinberg gefahren wäre. Und doch, es mußte sein. Nicht nur sich allein gegenüber war er verpflichtet, der Sache weiter nachzugehen; noch allerlei anderes gab es heute zu erledigen. Und so entschloß er sich für alle Fälle, Herrn Doktor Fuchstaler auch mit der Abendvisite zu betrauen. Das junge Mädchen mit dem verdächtigen Spitzenkatarrh dort im letzten Bett lächelte ihm zu. Es war dieselbe, die neulich bei Gelegenheit einer Untersuchung ihre Brüste so zutraulich an seine Wange gepreßt hatte. Fridolin erwiderte ihren Blick ungnädig und wandte sich stirnrunzelnd ab. Eine wie die andere, dachte er mit Bitterkeit, und Albertine ist wie sie alle – sie ist die Schlimmste von allen. Ich werde mich von ihr trennen. Es kann nie wieder gut werden.","He asked Doctor Fuchstaler to run the ambulance and had to admit that he would rather have stayed here than gone to the Galitzinberg. And yet it had to be. He was under an obligation not only to himself to pursue the matter further; there were a lot of other things to do today. And so he decided, just in case, to entrust Doctor Fuchstaler with the evening rounds as well. The young girl with the suspicious catarrh there in the last bed smiled at him. It was the same one who had pressed her breasts so trustingly against his cheek the other day during an examination. Fridolin returned her look ungraciously and turned away frowning. One like the other, he thought bitterly, and Albertine is like them all - she is the worst of them all. I will break up with her. It can never be good again.","He asked Dr Fuchstaler to take charge of the rounds, though he had to admit that he would rather have stayed on than drive out to the Galitzinberg. And yet it had to be done. He did not just owe it to himself to pursue the matter further; and there were many things still to be attended to today. And so, just in case, he decided to entrust Dr Fuchstaler with the evening rounds as well. The young girl with suspected acute bronchitis over in the last bed smiled at him. She was the one who during a recent examination had taken the opportunity to press her breast so intimately against his cheek. Fridolin returned her gaze ungraciously and turned away with a frown. They’re all the same, he thought bitterly, and Albertine no different from the rest – in fact she’s the worst of them all. We’ll have to part. Things can never be the same again between us.","He asked Doctor Fuchstaler if he would please take charge of the dispensary. He confessed to himself that he would rather have stayed there than drive out to Galitzinberg. And yet, he must. He felt obliged, not only for his own sake, to investigate this matter further, but there were all sorts of other things to be settled that day. He decided to ask Doctor Fuchstaler to take charge of the afternoon rounds, too, so as to be prepared for all emergencies. The young girl, over there, with suspected tuberculosis was smiling at him. It was the same one who had recently pressed her breasts so confidingly against his cheek when he examined her. Fridolin gave her a cold look and turned away with a frown. They are all alike, he thought bitterly, and Albertina is like the rest of them —if not the worst. I won't live with her any longer. Things can never be the same again."
"» Mir kann nichts passieren, heechstens, daß ich zum letzten Male heite – aber das ist vielleicht auch soo.« Er schwieg und blickte wieder durch den Vorhangspalt hinaus.","""Nothing can happen to me, at least that's my last name - but maybe that's the way it is.""

At best this would be the last time—but perhaps that may be the case anyhow. "" He stopped and looked out again through the crevice in the curtain."
"Sie sprach immer weiter, aber ihm schien, als wüßte sie gar nicht recht, zu wem sie sprach; oder als spräche sie zu sich selbst. Zwölf Jahre war der Bruder nun fort vom Haus, ja, sie war noch ein Kind gewesen, als er plötzlich verschwand. Vor vier oder fünf Jahren zu Weihnachten war die letzte Nachricht von ihm gekommen, aus einer kleinen italienischen Stadt. Sonderbar, sie hatte den Namen vergessen. So redete sie noch eine Weile gleichgültige Dinge, ohne Notwendigkeit, fast ohne Zusammenhang, bis sie mit einemmal schwieg und nun stumm dasaß, den Kopf in den Händen. Fridolin war müde und noch mehr gelangweilt, wartete sehnlich, daß jemand käme, die Verwandten oder der Verlobte. Das Schweigen im Raume lastete schwer. Es war ihm, als schwiege der Tote mit ihnen; nicht etwa weil er nun unmöglich mehr reden konnte, sondern absichtsvoll und mit Schadenfreude.","She kept talking, but it seemed to him that she didn't really know who she was talking to; or as if she were talking to herself.

So for a while she talked irrelevant things, without necessity, almost without context, until all of a sudden she fell silent and sat there silently, her head in her hands. Fridolin was tired and even more bored, eagerly waiting for someone to come, the relatives or the fiancé. The silence in the room weighed heavily. It seemed to him that the dead man was silent with them; not because it was now impossible for him to speak, but intentionally and with glee.","She talked on and on, but to him it seemed as if she didn’t really know whom she was talking to, or as if she were talking to herself.

She continued talking thus a while aimlessly and almost without logical connection about indifferent matters, then suddenly stopped and sat there silently, her head in her hands. Fridolin was tired and even more bored, and waited anxiously for the relatives or the fiancé to arrive. The silence in the room became oppressive. He felt as though the dead man were joining in their silence, not because he could no longer talk, but deliberately and out of sheer malice.","She kept up her stream of talk, but it seemed to him that she didn't quite know what she was saying.

"Im Laufe der nächsten zwei Stunden hatte Fridolin sechs alte Patienten und zwei neue vorzunehmen.

Er trug einen offenen grauen Havelock, darunter einen etwas speckigen Frack, ein zerdrücktes Hemd mit drei falschen Brillantknöpfen, einen zerknitterten Kragen und eine flatternde weiße Seidenkrawatte. Seine Lider waren gerötet wie von vielen durchwachten Nächten, doch die Augen strahlten heiter und blau.","He looked up from the newspaper. Then he saw two eyes on him from a table opposite. Was it possible? Nightingale?

"»Findest du dich zurecht?« fragte er, während Fridolin ins Mikroskop schaute. »Es ist nämlich eine ziemlich neue Färbungsmethode.«","""Do you find your way around?"" he asked while Fridolin looked into the microscope.

"Als der Arzt eingetreten war, hatte sie den Blick zu ihm gewandt, doch in der kärglichen Beleuchtung sah er kaum, ob ihre Wangen sich röteten wie sonst, wenn er erschien. Sie wollte sich erheben, eine Handbewegung Fridolins verwehrte es ihr, sie nickte ihm mit großen, aber trüben Augen einen Gruß zu. Er trat an das Kopfende des Bettes, berührte mechanisch die Stirn des Toten, dessen Arme, die in weiten offenen Hemdärmeln über der Bettdecke lagen, dann senkte er mit leichtem Bedauern die Schultern, steckte die Hände in die Taschen seines Pelzrockes, ließ den Blick im Zimmer umherschweifen und endlich auf Marianne verweilen.

He approached the head of the bed, mechanically felt the dead man’s temples, then the wrists that protruded from the wide, open sleeves resting on the bed-cover, then shrugged his shoulders in a mild gesture of regret and put his hands in the pockets of his fur coat, his gaze wandering round the room and eventually coming to rest on Marianne. Her hair was thick and fair but dry, her neck well formed and slender but of a yellowish complexion and no longer completely free of wrinkles, and her lips pinched as if from many unspoken words.","When the doctor entered she looked up, but because of the dim light he could not see whether she had blushed, as usual, when he appeared.

He stepped to the head of the bed and mechanically placed his hands on the forehead of the dead man and on the arms which were lying on the bed-spread in loose and open shirt sleeves.

"»Die Maske herunter!« befahl wieder ein anderer mit einer hellen frechen Stimme, durch die sich Fridolin an den Kommandoton eines Offiziers erinnert fühlte. »Man wird Ihnen ins Gesicht sagen, was Ihrer harrt, und nicht in Ihre Larve.«","""Take off your mask!"" another commanded in a clear, cheeky voice that reminded Fridolin of an officer's tone of command.

Auch in der Nacht, die dem Tod seiner Mutter gefolgt war, hatte er geschlafen, hatte tief und traumlos schlafen können, und er sollte es in dieser nicht? Und er streckte sich an der Seite Albertinens hin, die schon eingeschlummert zu sein schien. Ein Schwert zwischen uns, dachte er wieder. Und dann: wie Todfeinde liegen wir hier nebeneinander. Aber es war nur ein Wort.","But no matter how things stood with him at that moment, whatever decisions he was to reach in the course of the next few hours, the urgent need of the moment was to flee into sleep and oblivion at least for a while. He had also slept the night after his mother's death, had been able to sleep deeply and dreamlessly, and shouldn't he be sleeping this time? And he lay down at Albertina's side, who seemed to have fallen asleep. A sword between us, he thought again. And then: we lie side by side here like mortal enemies. But it was only one word.","But however matters stood with him at present, whatever decisions he might reach in the next few hours, what he urgently needed at that moment was to escape, at least for a while, into sleep and oblivion. On the night following his mother’s death he had been able to fall into a deep and dreamless sleep, and should he not succeed in doing so tonight? So he stretched out beside Albertine, who by now appeared to have gone to sleep. As if there were a sword between us, he thought again. And then: we are lying here side by side like mortal enemies.","But whatever his present state of mind— whatever decisions he might reach in the next few hours, the urgent demand of the moment was for sleep and forgetfulness.

A sword between us, he thought, we are lying here like mortal enemies. But it was only an illusion."
"Das Tor fiel hinter ihm zu, und Fridolin prägte mit einem raschen Blick seinem Gedächtnis die Hausnummer ein, um in der Lage zu sein, dem lieben armen Ding morgen Wein und Näschereien heraufzuschicken.","The gate slammed shut behind him, and Fridolin took a quick look and memorized the house number so he would be able to send up wine and sweets to the poor dear tomorrow.","The door fell shut behind him, and Fridolin, with a quick glance, memorized the house number so that he could send wine and food up to the poor creature the following day.","The door closed behind Fridolin and he quickly made a mental note of the street number, so as to be able to send the poor little thing some wine and cakes the following day."

"Er führte Fridolin über eine Wendeltreppe ins Magazin hinauf. Es roch nach Seide, Samt, Parfüms, Staub und trockenen Blumen; aus schwimmendem Dunkel blitzte es silbern und rot; und plötzlich glänzten eine Menge kleiner Lämpchen zwischen offenen Schränken eines engen, langgestreckten Gangs, der sich rückwärts in Finsternis verlor. Rechts und links hingen Kostüme aller Art; auf der einen Seite Ritter, Knappen, Bauern, Jäger, Gelehrte, Orientalen, Narren, auf der anderen Hofdamen, Ritterfräulein, Bäuerinnen, Kammerzofen, Königinnen der Nacht. Oberhalb der Kostüme waren die entsprechenden Kopfbedeckungen zu sehen, und es war Fridolin zumute, als wenn er durch eine Allee von Gehängten schritte, die im Begriffe wären, sich gegenseitig zum Tanz aufzufordern. Herr Gibiser ging hinter ihm einher. »Haben der Herr einen besonderen Wunsch? Louis Quatorze? Directoire? Altdeutsch?«","He led Fridolin up a spiral staircase to the warehouse. There was a smell of silk, velvet, perfumes, dust, and dried flowers; silver and red flashed out of the floating darkness; and suddenly a multitude of little lamps gleamed between open cupboards of a narrow, long corridor that lost itself backwards in darkness. Costumes of all kinds hung to the right and left; on the one side knights, squires, peasants, hunters, scholars, orientals, jesters, on the other ladies-in-waiting, damsels, peasant women, maids, queens of the night. The corresponding head coverings could be seen above the costumes, and Fridolin felt as if he were walking through an avenue of hanged men who were about to ask each other to dance. Herr Gibiser walked behind him. 'Do you have a special request, gentleman? Louis Quatorze? Directoire? Old German?""","He led Fridolin up a spiral staircase to the store-room. There was a pervasive smell of silk, satin, perfume, dust and dry flowers; here and there in the looming darkness red and silvery objects glinted; then suddenly a string of little lights came on between the lockers of a long narrow gallery stretching back into the gloom. To the left and right of them costumes of every imaginable kind were hanging: on one side there were knights, squires, peasants, huntsmen, sages, orientals, fools; on the other, maids of honour, courtly ladies, peasant women, chambermaids and queens-of-the-night. Appropriate headgear was on display above the costumes, so that Fridolin felt as though he were walking down an avenue of gallows-birds on the point of asking one another for a dance. Herr Gibiser followed along behind him. ‘Have you any particular preference, sir? Louis Quatorze? Directoire? Old Germanic?’","He led the way up a winding staircase into the store. There was an odor of silk, velvet, perfume, dust and withered flowers, and a glitter of silver and red out of the indistinct darkness. A number of little electric bulbs suddenly shone between the open cabinets of a long, narrow passage, the end of which was enveloped in darkness. There were all kinds of costumes hanging to the right and to the left. On one side knights, squires, peasants, hunters, scholars, Orientals and clowns; on the other, ladies-at-court, baronesses, peasant women, lady's maids, queens of the night. The corresponding head-dresses were on a shelf above the costumes. Fridolin felt as though he were walking through a gallery of hanged people who were on the point of asking each other to dance.

""I was beginning to think that your bad conscience brought you down here when all good people should be sleeping."""
"Gibiser ließ sie beide los, und Fridolin hörte, wie er zu ihnen sagte: »Hierüber werden Sie nähere Auskunft zu geben haben. Oder sahen Sie nicht sofort, daß Sie es mit einer Wahnsinnigen zu tun hatten?« und zu Fridolin gewendet: »Verzeihen Sie den Zwischenfall, mein Herr.«","Gibiser let go of them both, and Fridolin heard him say to them: 'You will have to provide more information about this.

"»No, wie wir i denn heißen? Mizzi natürlich.« Schon hatte sie den Schlüssel im Haustor umgedreht, trat in den Flur und wartete, daß Fridolin ihr folgte.","»Well, what's our name? Mizzi, of course.' She had already turned the key in the front door, stepped into the hall and waited for Fridolin to follow her.","‘What’s your name?’ asked Fridolin. ‘Mizzi, of course, what else?’ She had already turned the key in the door to the apartment block, and stepping into the entrance-hall she waited for Fridolin to follow her. ‘Hurry up!’","""Well, what do you think?

"Aber was nun? Nach Hause? Wohin sonst! Heute konnte er ja doch nichts mehr unternehmen. Und morgen? Was? Und wie? Er fühlte sich ungeschickt, hilflos, alles zerfloß ihm unter den Händen; alles wurde unwirklich, sogar sein Heim, seine Frau, sein Kind, sein Beruf, ja, er selbst, wie er so mit schweifenden Gedanken die abendlichen Straßen mechanisch weiterging.","But what now? Home? Where else! There was nothing he could do today after all. And tomorrow? What? And how?

Home again? What else! After all, he couldn’t embark on anything more today. What about tomorrow? And how should he set about things?

Go home? Where else could he go? Anyhow, there was nothing more he could do today. And what about tomorrow? What could he do and how should he go about it? He felt awkward and helpless.

"Am Ende des Liebhartstals, wo der Weg entschiedener nach aufwärts führte, stieg er aus und schickte den Wagen vorsichtshalber wieder fort. Der Himmel war blaßblau, mit weißen Wölkchen, und die Sonne schien frühlingswarm. Er blickte zurück – nichts Verdächtiges war zu sehen. Kein Wagen, kein Fußgänger. Langsam stieg er bergan. Der Mantel wurde ihm schwer; er legte ihn ab und warf ihn um die Schultern. Er kam an die Stelle, wo rechts die Seitenstraße abbiegen mußte, in der das geheimnisvolle Haus stand; er konnte nicht fehlgehen; sie führte nach abwärts, aber keineswegs so steil, als es ihn nachts im Fahren gedünkt hatte. Eine stille Gasse. In einem Vorgarten standen Rosenstöcke, sorgfältig in Stroh gehüllt, in einem nächsten stand ein Kinderwägelchen; ein Bub, ganz in blaue Wolle gekleidet, tollte hin und her; vom Parterrefenster aus schaute eine junge Frau lachend zu. Dann kam ein unbebauter Platz, dann ein wilder eingezäunter Garten, dann eine kleine Villa, dann ein Rasenplatz, und nun, kein Zweifel – dies hier war das Haus, das er suchte. Es sah keineswegs groß oder prächtig aus, es war eine einstöckige Villa in bescheidenem Empirestil und offenbar vor nicht allzu langer Zeit renoviert. Die grünen Jalousien waren überall heruntergelassen, nichts deutete darauf hin, daß die Villa bewohnt sein könnte. Fridolin blickte rings um sich. Niemand war in der Gasse zu sehen; nur weiter unten gingen, sich entfernend, zwei Knaben mit Büchern unter dem Arm. Er stand vor der Gartentür. Und was nun? Einfach wieder zurückspazieren? Das wäre ihm geradezu lächerlich erschienen. Er suchte nach dem elektrischen Taster. Und wenn man ihm aufschlösse, was sollte er sagen? Nun, ganz einfach – ob das hübsche Landhaus nicht über den Sommer zu vermieten wäre? Doch schon tat sich das Haustor von selbst auf, ein alter Diener in einfacher Morgenlivree trat heraus und ging langsam den schmalen Pfad bis zur Gartentür. Er hielt einen Brief in der Hand und reichte ihn stumm zwischen den Gitterstäben Fridolin, dem das Herz klopfte.","At the end of the Liebhartstal, where the path led more decidedly uphill, he got out and, to be on the safe side, sent the car away again. The sky was pale blue, with white clouds, and the sun shone with spring warmth. He looked back - nothing suspicious was to be seen. No car, no pedestrian. He slowly climbed up the hill. His cloak grew heavy; he put it down and threw it around his shoulders. He came to the place where the side street, where the mysterious house stood, had to turn right; he could not go wrong; it led downwards, but by no means as steeply as it had seemed to him while driving at night. A quiet alley. In one front yard stood rose bushes, carefully wrapped in straw, in another stood a pram; a boy, all dressed in blue wool, frolicked to and fro; A young woman looked on from the ground floor window, laughing. Then came a vacant lot, then a wild fenced yard, then a small villa, then a lawn, and well, no doubt, this was the house he was looking for. It didn't look big or grand at all, it was a one-story mansion in a modest Empire style and apparently recently renovated. The green blinds were drawn everywhere, giving no indication that the villa could be inhabited. Fridolin looked around. There was no one to be seen in the alley; only further down were two boys with books under their arms, going away. He stood in front of the garden door. And what's next? Just walk back? That would have seemed ridiculous to him. He looked for the electric button. And if you opened the door to him, what should he say? Well, quite simply - couldn't the pretty country house be rented out over the summer? But the front door opened by itself, an old servant in a simple morning livery stepped out and slowly walked the narrow path to the garden door. He held a letter in his hand and silently handed it between the bars of Fridolin, whose heart was pounding.","At the end of the Liebhart Valley, where the road begins to climb more steeply, he got out, dismissing the cab as a precaution. The pale blue sky was flecked with little white clouds, and the sun was shining with the warmth of spring. He looked back, but could see nothing to arouse suspicion. No cab, no one on foot. Slowly he walked up the hill. His coat began to feel heavy; he took it off and threw it over his shoulder. He reached the spot where he had to turn right into the side-road leading to the mysterious house; he couldn’t go wrong; the road descended, but not as steeply as he had imagined when being driven down during the night. A quiet road. In one front garden there were rose-bushes wrapped carefully in straw, while in the next there was a small pram; a little boy clad in blue woollen clothes was tottering to and fro; from a ground-floor window a young woman watched him with a smile. Then came a vacant plot, then a fenced-off garden run to seed, then a small villa, then a stretch of lawn and here, there could be no mistake – here was the house that he was looking for. It didn’t look particularly large or grand, being a modest, single-storey Empire-style villa which had evidently been renovated not too long ago. The green shutters were all let down, and there was nothing to indicate that it was inhabited. Fridolin looked all around. There was no one about in the street, apart from two boys further down who were walking away from him with books under their arms. He stood outside the garden gate. What next? Should he simply walk away? That seemed too ridiculous. He looked round for the bell. And suppose they were to open the door, what should he say? Simply inquire, perhaps, whether this fine country residence might be available for rent over the summer? But the front door had already opened and an old servant in simple morning livery came out and walked slowly down the narrow path towards the garden gate. He was holding a letter which he silently handed through the bars to Fridolin, whose heart was pounding.","He got out at the end of Liebhartstal, where the road led sharply up-hill, and took the precaution of sending the cab away. There were white clouds in the pale-blue sky and the sun shone with the warmth of spring. He looked back—there was nothing suspicious in sight, no cab, no pedestrian. He walked slowly up the road. His coat became heavy. He took it off and threw it over his shoulder just as he came to the spot where he thought the side-street, in which the mysterious house stood, branched off to the right. He could not go wrong. The street went down-hill but not nearly so steeply as it had seemed during the night. It was a quiet little street. There were rosebushes carefully covered with straw in a front garden, and in the next yard stood a baby carriage. A boy in a blue jersey suit was romping about and a laughing young woman watched him from a ground-floor window. Next came an empty lot, then an uncultivated fenced-in garden, then a little villa, next a lawn, and finally—there was no doubt about it—the house he was looking for. It certainly did not seem large or magnificent. It was a one-story villa in modest Empire style and obviously renovated a comparatively short time before. The green blinds were down and there was nothing to show that anyone lived there. Fridolin looked around. There was no one in the street, except farther down where two boys with books under their arms were going in the opposite direction. He stopped in front of the garden gate. And what was he to do now? Simply walk back again? That would be too ridiculous, he thought, looking for the bell-button. Supposing someone answered it, what was he to say? Well, he would simply ask if the pretty country house was to let for the summer. But the house-door had already opened and an old servant in plain morning livery came out and slowly walked down the narrow path to the gate.

"Das leise Klopfen des Dienstmädchens weckte ihn um sieben Uhr früh. Er warf einen raschen Blick auf Albertine. Manchmal, nicht immer, weckte dieses Klopfen auch sie. Heute schlief sie regungslos, allzu regungslos weiter. Fridolin machte sich rasch fertig. Ehe er fortging, wollte er seine kleine Tochter sehen. Sie lag ruhig in ihrem weißen Bett, die Hände nach Kinderart zu kleinen Fäustchen verkrampft. Er küßte sie auf die Stirn. Und noch einmal, auf den Fußspitzen, schlich er zur Tür des Schlafzimmers, wo Albertine immer noch ruhte, unbeweglich wie vorher. Dann ging er. In seiner schwarzen Arztenstasche, wohl verwahrt, trug er Mönchskutte und Pilgerhut mit sich. Das Programm für den Tag hatte er sorgfältig, ja mit einiger Pedanterie entworfen. An erster Stelle stand ein Besuch ganz in der Nähe bei einem schwerkranken jungen Rechtsanwalt. Fridolin nahm eine sorgfältige Untersuchung vor, fand den Zustand etwas gebessert, gab seiner Befriedigung darüber ehrlich erfreuten Ausdruck und versah ein altes Rezept mit dem üblichen Repetatur. Dann begab er sich unverzüglich nach dem Hause, in dessen Kellertiefen Nachtigall gestern abend Klavier gespielt hatte. Das Lokal war noch gesperrt, doch im Café oben die Kassiererin wußte, daß Nachtigall in einem kleinen Hotel der Leopoldstadt wohne. Eine Viertelstunde darauf fuhr Fridolin dort vor. Es war ein elender Gasthof. Im Flur roch es nach ungelüfteten Betten, schlechtem Fett und Zichorienkaffee. Ein übel aussehender Portier, mit rotgeränderten pfiffigen Augen, stets auf polizeiliche Einvernahme gefaßt, gab bereitwillig Auskunft. Herr Nachtigall sei heute morgen um fünf Uhr in Gesellschaft zweier Herren vorgefahren, die ihr Gesicht durch hochgeschlungene Halstücher vielleicht absichtlich beinahe unkenntlich gemacht hätten. Während Nachtigall sich in sein Zimmer begeben, hätten die Herren seine Rechnung für die letzten vier Wochen bezahlt; als er nach einer halben Stunde nicht wieder erschienen war, hätte ihn der eine Herr persönlich heruntergeholt, worauf alle drei zum Nordbahnhof gefahren wären. Nachtigall hatte einen höchst aufgeregten Eindruck gemacht; ja – warum sollte man einem so vertrauenerweckenden Herrn nicht die ganze Wahrheit sagen – er hatte dem Portier einen Brief zuzustecken versucht, was die beiden Herren aber sofort verhindert hatten. Briefe, die für Herrn Nachtigall kämen – so hatten die Herren weiter erklärt –, würden von einer hierzu legitimierten Person abgeholt werden. Fridolin empfahl sich, es war ihm angenehm, daß er seine Arztenstasche in der Hand trug, als er aus dem Haustor trat; so würde man ihn wohl nicht für einen Bewohner dieses Hotels halten, sondern für eine Amtsperson. Mit Nachtigall war es also vorderhand nichts. Man war recht vorsichtig gewesen und hatte wohl allen Anlaß dazu.","The maid's soft knocking woke him at seven in the morning. He glanced at Albertine. Sometimes, not always, the knocking woke her too. Today she slept motionless, all too motionless. Fridolin quickly got ready. Before he left he wanted to see his little daughter. She lay quietly in her white bed, her hands clenched into little fists in a child's fashion. He kissed her forehead. And once more, on tiptoe, he crept to the door of the bedroom, where Albertine still lay, motionless as before. Then he left. In his black doctor's bag, well kept, he carried a monk's robe and a pilgrim's hat with him. He had planned the program for the day carefully, even with some pedantry. The first thing to do was to visit a young lawyer who was seriously ill nearby. Fridolin undertook a careful examination, found the condition somewhat improved, expressed his satisfaction with it and provided the usual repetition of an old recipe. Then he immediately went to the house in the basement of which Nightingale had been playing the piano last night. The bar was still closed, but the cashier in the café upstairs knew that Nachtigall lived in a small hotel in Leopoldstadt. Fifteen minutes later Fridolin drove up there. It was a miserable inn. The hallway smelled of unaired beds, bad fat and chicory coffee. A nasty-looking porter, with sly red-rimmed eyes, always ready for police questioning, was willing to provide information. Herr Nachtigall drove up at five o'clock this morning in the company of two gentlemen who, perhaps on purpose, had almost made their faces unrecognizable by tying up scarves. While Nachtigall went to his room, the gentlemen had paid his bill for the last four weeks; when he hadn't appeared again after half an hour, one gentleman would have fetched him down personally, after which all three would have driven to the North Station. Nightingale had looked most excited; Yes - why shouldn't one tell the whole truth to such a trustworthy gentleman - he had tried to slip a letter to the porter, but the two gentlemen immediately prevented it. Letters that came for Mr. Nightingale - the gentlemen had explained further - would be picked up by a person authorized to do so. Fridolin took his leave, it pleased him that he was carrying his doctor's bag in his hand when he stepped through the front door; so one would probably not take him for an inhabitant of this hotel, but for an official. So for the time being it was nothing with Nightingale. They had been very careful and probably had every reason to be.","He was woken at seven o’clock that morning by the gentle knocking of the maid. He cast a quick glance at Albertine. Sometimes, though not always, this knocking would wake her too. Today she slept on tranquilly, all too tranquilly: Fridolin hurriedly got ready. He wanted to see his little daughter before leaving. She was lying peacefully in her white bed, her hands curled into little fists, the way children do. He kissed her forehead. And once again he tiptoed to the door of the bedroom where Albertine was still lying motionless. Then he left, the monk’s habit and pilgrim’s hat stowed safely in his doctor’s bag. He had worked out his programme for the day carefully and even with a touch of pedantry. First on his list was a visit to a lawyer quite close by who was seriously ill. Fridolin examined him thoroughly, found his condition somewhat improved, expressed his satisfaction with genuine pleasure and prescribed a well-tried remedy with the usual admonitions. Then he went directly to the cavernous basement tavern where Nachtigall had played the piano the previous evening. That establishment was still closed, but in the coffee-house upstairs the lady at the till happened to know that Nachtigall boarded at a small hotel in Leopoldstadt. A quarter of an hour later Fridolin drew up in front of it. It was a squalid little boarding-house. The lobby smelled of unaired beds, bad fat and chicory coffee. An evil-looking porter with piercing red-rimmed eyes, well accustomed to police interrogations, was willing to furnish him with information. Herr Nachtigall had driven up at five that morning in the company of two gentlemen who, perhaps deliberately, had made sure they would be virtually unrecognizable by wearing scarves over their faces. While Nachtigall had gone up to his room, these gentlemen had paid his rent for the previous four weeks; and when after half an hour he had still not reappeared, one of them had fetched him down, whereupon all three had driven to the Northern District Station. Nachtigall had appeared to be extremely agitated; indeed, why should one not tell the whole truth to a gentleman who inspired such confidence – he had tried to slip a note to the porter, but the two gentlemen had intervened at once. Any letters for Herr Nachtigall, the two gentlemen had explained, would be collected by someone authorized to do so. Fridolin took his leave, thankful that he had his doctor’s bag with him as he came out of the main door: that way people would not take him for a lodger but for someone there officially. From Nachtigall, then, there was nothing to be gleaned. They had been very careful, and evidently had every reason for being so.","AT seven o'clock Fridolin was awakened by the maid gently knocking on the door, and he cast a quick glance at Albertina. Sometimes this knocking awakened her too. But today she was sleeping soundly; too soundly Fridolin thought. He dressed himself quickly, intending to see his little daughter before leaving. The child lay quietly in her white bed, her hands clenched into little fists, as children do in sleep, and he kissed her on her forehead. Tip-toeing to the door of the bedroom he found Albertina still sleeping soundly; then he went out. The cassock and pilgrim's hat were safely concealed in his black doctor's bag. He had drawn up a program for the day with great care, indeed, even a bit pedantically. First of all he had to see a young attorney in the neighborhood who was seriously ill. Fridolin made a careful examination and found his condition somewhat improved. He expressed his satisfaction with sincere joy and ordered an old prescription to be refilled. Then he went to the house in the basement of which Nachtigall had played the piano the night before. The place was still closed, but the girl at the counter in the cafe above said that Nachtigall lived in a small hotel in Leopoldstadt. He took a cab and arrived there a quarter of an hour later. It was a very shabby place, smelling of unaired beds, rancid lard and chicory. A tough looking concierge, with sly, inflamed eyes, wishing to keep on good terms with the police, willingly gave information. Herr Nachtigall had arrived in a cab at five o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two men who had disguised their faces, perhaps intentionally so, with scarfs which they wore wrapped about their heads and necks. While Nachtigall was in his room, the two men had paid his bill for the last four weeks. When he didn't appear after half an hour, one of them had gone up to fetch him, whereupon they all three took a cab to North Station. Nachtigall had seemed highly excited, in fact— well, why not tell the whole truth to a man who gave one so much confidence—he had tried to slip a letter to the concierge, but the two men stopped that. Any letters for Herr Nachtigall—so the men had explained— would be called for by a person properly authorized to do so. Fridolin took his leave. He was glad that he had his doctor's bag with him when he stepped out of the door, for anyone seeing him would not think that he was staying at the hotel, but would take him for some official person. There was nothing to be done about Nachtigall for the time being. They had been extremely cautious, probably with good reason."

"Von der Uhr des Rathausturmes schlug es halb acht. Es war übrigens gleichgültig, wie spät es war; die Zeit lag in völliger Überflüssigkeit vor ihm. Nichts, niemand ging ihn an. Er verspürte ein leises Mitleid mit sich selbst. Ganz flüchtig, nicht etwa wie ein Vorsatz, kam ihm der Einfall, zu irgendeinem Bahnhof zu fahren, abzureisen, gleichgültig wohin, zu verschwinden für alle Leute, die ihn gekannt, irgendwo in der Fremde wieder aufzutauchen und ein neues Leben zu beginnen als ein anderer, neuer Mensch. Er besann sich gewisser merkwürdiger Krankheitsfälle, die er aus psychiatrischen Büchern kannte, sogenannter Doppelexistenzen: ein Mensch verschwand plötzlich aus ganz geordneten Verhältnissen, war verschollen, kehrte nach Monaten oder nach Jahren wieder, erinnerte sich selbst nicht, wo er in dieser Zeit gewesen, aber später erkannte ihn irgendwer, der irgendwo in einem fernen Land mit ihm zusammengetroffen war, und der Heimgekehrte wußte gar nichts davon. Solche Dinge kamen freilich selten vor, aber immerhin, sie waren erwiesen. Und in abgeschwächter Form erlebte sie wohl mancher. Wenn man aus Träumen wiederkehrte zum Beispiel? Freilich, man erinnerte sich... Aber gewiß gab es auch Träume, die man völlig vergaß, von denen nichts übrigblieb als irgendeine rätselhafte Stimmung, eine geheimnisvolle Benommenheit.

Quite fleetingly, not like a resolution, the idea came to him to go to some station, to leave, to wherever he went, to disappear for everyone who knew him, to turn up somewhere in a strange land and start a new life as a different, new person. He remembered certain strange cases of illness that he knew from psychiatric books, so-called double existences: a person suddenly disappeared from quite orderly circumstances, was missing, returned months or years later, didn't remember where he was at that time, but later someone who had met him somewhere in a distant country recognized him, and the one who came home knew nothing about it. Of course, such things rarely happened, but at least they were proven. And some people probably experienced it in a weakened form. When you come back from dreams, for example?

He remembered a number of remarkable cases of double identity he knew about from books on psychiatry: a person would disappear suddenly from a perfectly orderly milieu, be forgotten and then return months or years later, unable to remember where he had been for all that time; afterwards someone who had known him in some distant land would recognize him, yet the home-comer would know nothing about it whatsoever. True, such things happened very rarely, but they had been authenticated none the less. And in a milder form they were experienced by a great many people. What about when one awoke from dreams, for example? Of course, there one could remember… But there were also surly dreams which one forgot completely, of which nothing remained but some mysterious aura, some obscure bemusement.

"Nun berichtete Nachtigall. Er hatte sich, wie Fridolin richtig vermutet, die ganzen Jahre über als Pianist in allen möglichen polnischen, rumänischen, serbischen und bulgarischen Städten und Städtchen fortgebracht, in Lemberg lebte ihm eine Frau mit vier Kindern; – und er lachte hell, als wäre es ausnehmend lustig, vier Kinder zu haben, alle in Lemberg und alle von ein und derselben Frau. Seit dem vergangenen Herbst hielt er sich wieder in Wien auf. Das Varieté, das ihn engagiert hatte, war sofort verkracht, nun spielte er in den verschiedensten Lokalen, wie es sich eben fügte, manchmal auch in zweien oder dreien in derselben Nacht, hier unten zum Beispiel, im Keller – kein sehr vornehmes Etablissement, wie er bemerkte, eigentlich eine Art von Kegelbahn, und was das Publikum anbelangt... »Aber wenn man für vier Kinder zu sorgen hat und eine Frau in Lemberg« – und er lachte wieder, nicht mehr ganz so lustig wie vorher. »Auch privat habe ich manchmal zu tun«, fügte er rasch hinzu.

»Erzähl' doch weiter. Wenn du schon einmal angefangen hast... Geheime Veranstaltung? Geschlossene Gesellschaft? Geladene Gäste?«,"'Go on. If you've ever started... Secret Event? closed society? Invited guests?""",‘Tell me more. Now you’ve started… Secret shows? Closed societies? Invited guests?’,""" asked Nachtigall, as if coming out of a dream. ""Tell me the rest of the story, now that you've started. A secret party? Closed affair? Nothing but invited guests?"""
"Der Morgen dämmerte grau durch die Vorhänge, als Fridolin zu Ende war. Nicht ein einziges Mal hatte ihn Albertine mit einer neugierigen oder ungeduldigen Frage unterbrochen. Sie fühlte wohl, daß er ihr nichts verschweigen wollte und konnte. Ruhig lag sie da, die Arme im Nacken verschlungen, und schwieg noch lange, als Fridolin schon längst geendet hatte. Endlich – er lag an ihrer Seite hingestreckt – beugte er sich über sie, und in ihr regungsloses Antlitz mit den großen hellen Augen, in denen jetzt auch der Morgen aufzugehen schien, fragte er zweifelnd und hoffnungsvoll zugleich: »Was sollen wir tun, Albertine?«","The morning dawned gray through the curtains when Fridolin was over. Not once had Albertine interrupted him with a curious or impatient question. She felt that he didn't want to and couldn't hide anything from her. She lay there quietly, her arms clasped behind her neck, and remained silent for a long time, long after Fridolin had finished. Finally - he was lying stretched out by her side - he bent over her, and into her motionless face with the large, bright eyes, in which the morning seemed to be dawning, he asked at the same time doubtfully and hopefully: ""What shall we do, Albertine? «","By the time Fridolin had ended the first grey light of dawn was coming through the curtains. Albertine had not once interrupted him with curious or impatient questions. She seemed to sense that he had no desire to conceal anything from her, that he was indeed unable to. She lay there quietly, her hands behind her neck, and remained silent a long time after Fridolin had finished. At last – he had been lying stretched out by her side – he bent over her and, gazing into her impassive face and large bright eyes, in which the day now seemed to be dawning too, asked hesitantly yet full of hope, ‘What should we do, Albertine?’","The gray dawn was creeping in through the curtains when Fridolin finished. Albertina hadn't once interrupted him with a curious or impatient question. She probably felt that he could not, and would not, keep anything from her. She lay there quietly, with her arms folded under her head, and remained silent long after Fridolin had finished. He was lying by her side and finally bent over her, and looking into her immobile face with the large, bright eyes in which morning seemed to have dawned, he asked, in a voice of both doubt and hope: ""What shall we do now, Albertina?"""

"»Na –«, sagte Fridolin mit einem leisen, wie schuldbewußten Lächeln.","""Well -"" said Fridolin with a faint, as if guilty smile.","‘Quite so,’ said Fridolin with a quiet, slightly guilty smile.","""Well""—said Fridolin, smiling slightly, as if he had a guilty conscience."
"Es war indes noch etwas wärmer geworden. Der laue Wind brachte in die enge Gasse einen Duft von feuchten Wiesen und fernem Bergfrühling. Wohin jetzt? dachte Fridolin, als wäre es nicht das Selbstverständliche, endlich nach Hause zu gehen und sich schlafen zu legen. Aber dazu konnte er sich nicht entschließen. Wie heimatlos, wie hinausgestoßen erschien er sich seit der widerwärtigen Begegnung mit den Alemannen... Oder seit Mariannens Geständnis? – Nein, länger schon – seit dem Abendgespräch mit Albertine rückte er immer weiter fort aus dem gewohnten Bezirk seines Daseins in irgendeine andere, ferne, fremde Welt.","However, it had gotten a little warmer. The mild wind brought a scent of damp meadows and distant mountain spring into the narrow alley. where to now thought Fridolin, as if finally going home and going to sleep wasn't something that should be taken for granted. But he couldn't make up his mind to do that. How homeless, how expelled did he feel since his repulsive encounter with the Alemanni... Or since Mariana's confession? - No, longer - since the evening conversation with Albertine he has moved further and further away from the usual sphere of his existence into some other, distant, foreign world.","In the interim it had become even warmer. A gentle breeze brought the scent of watery meadows and spring in the distant mountains down into the narrow street. Where to now? thought Fridolin, as though it were not at all self-evident that he should at last go home and sleep. Somehow he could not make up his mind to do so. Strange how homeless, how rejected he felt since that disagreeable encounter with the Alemannic students… Or was it since Marianne’s confession? No, earlier still – indeed, ever since his evening conversation with Albertine he had been moving away from the habitual sphere of his existence, into some other remote and unfamiliar world.","MEANWHILE it had become even milder outside. A fragrance from dewy meadows and distant mountains drifted with the gentle breezes into the narrow street. Where shall I go now? Fridolin asked himself, as though it weren't the obvious thing to go home to bed. But he couldn't persuade himself to do so. He felt homeless, an outcast, since his annoying meeting with the students ... or was it since Marianne's confession? No, it was longer than that—ever since this evening's conversation with Albertina he was moving farther and farther away from his everyday existence into some strange and distant world."
"»Sie bleiben wohl einige Tage auf dem Land«, begann er gezwungen. »Ich hoffe, Sie geben mir Nachricht... Herr Doktor Roediger sagt mir übrigens, daß die Hochzeit bald stattfinden werde. Erlauben Sie mir schon heute Ihnen meinen Glückwunsch auszusprechen.«","""You'll be staying in the country for a few days,"" he began forcedly. 'I hope you'll let me know...

"Er stand immer noch am Fenster, unbeweglich. Albertine erhob sich, trat auf ihn zu, ihr Auge war feucht und dunkel, leicht gerunzelt die Stirn. »Wir wollen einander solche Dinge künftighin immer gleich erzählen«, sagte sie.","He was still standing by the window, motionless. Albertine got up and walked towards him, her eyes were moist and dark, her brow furrowed slightly. ""We want to tell each other such things straight away from now on,"" she said.","He was still standing at the window, motionless. Albertine got up and went over to him, her eyes dark and moist, her brow slightly creased. ‘In future we should always tell each other things like this at once,’ she said.","He was still standing at the window, motionless as Albertina arose and walked over to him. There were tears in her eyes and a slight frown on her face. ""In the future let's always tell each other such things at once,"" she said."
"Gerichtliche Obduktion, zuckte es durch Fridolins Hirn. Das könnte wohl noch der Fall sein. Wer weiß, ob ihr Selbstmord überhaupt ein freiwilliger war? Die zwei Herren fielen ihm wieder ein, die so plötzlich aus dem Hotel verschwunden waren, nachdem sie von dem Selbstmordversuch erfahren hatten. Die Angelegenheit könnte sich wohl noch zu einer Kriminalaffäre ersten Ranges entwickeln. Und ob er – Fridolin – nicht gar als Zeuge vorgeladen würde ja, ob er nicht eigentlich verpflichtet wäre, sich freiwillig bei Gericht zu melden?","Forensic autopsy, Fridolin's mind twitched. That could still be the case. Who knows if her suicide was voluntary at all? He remembered the two gentlemen who had disappeared so suddenly from the hotel after learning about the attempted suicide. The matter could well develop into a criminal affair of the first order. And wouldn't he - Fridolin - even be summoned as a witness, wouldn't he actually be obliged to report voluntarily to the court?","A legal inquest flashed through Fridolin’s mind. It might well come to that. Who knows whether her suicide was really deliberate? He again thought of the two gentlemen who had disappeared so suddenly from the hotel, after they had learned about the suicide attempt. The whole affair might still turn into a criminal case of the first order. And might not he, Fridolin, be summoned as a witness – indeed, wouldn’t he be obliged to report to the law-court of his own free will?","Post-mortem examination—flashed across Fridolin's mind. That might easily be the case. Who knows whether her suicide was in any sense voluntary? He thought again of the two men who had so suddenly disappeared from the hotel after learning of her attempt at suicide. The affair might still develop into a criminal case of great importance. And mightn't he—Fridolin—perhaps be summoned as a witness?—In fact, wasn't it really his duty to report to the police?"
