"Aber was lang war, das waren die Nachmittage in solchen Krankheiten. Am Morgen nach der schlechten Nacht kam man immer in Schlaf, und wenn man erwachte und meinte, nun wäre es wieder früh, so war es Nachmittag und blieb Nachmittag und hörte nicht auf Nachtmittag zu sein. Da lag man so in dem aufgeräumten Bett und wuchs vielleicht ein wenig in den Gelenken und war viel zu müde, um sich irgend etwas vorzustellen. Der Geschmack vom Apfelmus hielt lange vor, und das war schon alles mögliche, wenn man ihn irgendwie auslegte, unwillkürlich, und die reinliche Säure an Stelle von Gedanken in sich herumgehen ließ. Später, wenn die Kräfte wiederkamen, wurden die Kissen hinter einem aufgebaut, und man konnte aufsitzen und mit Soldaten spielen; aber sie fielen so leicht um auf dem schiefen Bett-Tisch und dann immer gleich die ganze Reihe; und man war doch noch nicht so ganz im Leben drin, um immer wieder von vorn anzufangen. Plötzlich war es zuviel, und man bat, alles recht rasch fortzunehmen, und es tat wohl, wieder nur die zwei Hände zu sehen, ein bißchen weiter hin auf der leeren Decke.","But what was long were the afternoons in such illnesses. You always fell asleep the morning after a bad night, and when you woke up and thought it was early again, it was afternoon and stayed afternoon and didn't stop being mid-afternoon. There you lay in the tidy bed and maybe your joints grew a little and you were much too tired to imagine anything. The taste of applesauce lasted a long time, and that was all sorts of things if you interpreted it somehow, involuntarily, and let the pure acidity go around instead of thoughts. Later, when you got your strength back, the cushions were set up behind you and you could sit up and play with soldiers; but they fell over so easily on the crooked bed-table and then always the whole row at once; and you weren't quite there in life to start all over again. Suddenly it was too much, and one asked to take everything away very quickly, and it was good to see only the two hands again, a little farther on the empty blanket.","But it was the afternoons that were endless during such illnesses. In the morning after a bad night you always fell asleep, and when you woke up and thought that now it was morning again, it was really afternoon and remained afternoon and never stopped being afternoon. So you lay there in the freshly made bed and you grew a little in your joints perhaps and were much too tired to imagine anything at all. The taste of applesauce lasted for a long time and it was even a great achievement to somehow interpret it, involuntarily, and let the clean tartness circulate through you instead of thoughts. Later, as your strength returned, the pillows were propped up behind you, and you could sit there and play with soldiers; but they fell over so easily on the slanting bed-tray and always the whole row at once; and you were not yet so completely back inside life that you could always begin all over again. Suddenly it was too much, and you begged them to take everything away, quickly, and it felt good to see just your two hands again, a little further off on the empty blanket.","But it was the afternoons that were long during such illnesses. In the morning after a bad night, you always fell asleep, and when you woke and supposed it was still early in the day, it was in fact afternoon, and continued to be afternoon, and did not cease to be afternoon. There you lay in your freshly made bed, perhaps growing a little at the joints, far too tired to conceive of anything at all. The taste of stewed apple stayed in your mouth, and that was all you were capable of: involuntarily to interpret that flavour, and savour the pure acidity in place of thoughts. Later, when your strength returned, the pillows were propped up behind you and you could sit up and play with soldiers; but they fell over so easily on the tilted bed-tray, and always the whole row of them at once; and you were not yet so fully back in life that you could start all over again time after time. Suddenly it was all too much, and you asked to have everything taken away quickly, and it was good to see only your two hands again, a little further off on the cleared counterpane.","When I was ill like that, it was the afternoons that dragged on. In the morning after a bad night it was always possible to find sleep, and when you woke and thought it was the early morning again, it was in fact afternoon and remained afternoon and would not stop being afternoon. Then you lay in the bed that had been made up again and perhaps grew a little in your joints and were much too tired to imagine anything at all. The taste of apple compote lingered for ages and it was already something if you could analyse it somehow, involuntarily, let the clean tartness swirl around you instead of thoughts. Later, when your strength returned, they built up the pillows behind your head and you could sit up and play with toy soldiers; but the figures fell over so easily on the wobbly bed-tray, and when one went, the whole row went; and you weren’t quite sufficiently back in your life to be able to start again from the beginning every time. Suddenly it would get too much and you would ask them to clear everything away quickly, and it felt good to see only your two hands again, a little way away on the empty blanket."

"Ich wußte keine Ausrede, die ich ihr hätte wünschen können, aber ich zweifelte nicht, daß sie widerstehen würde. Schon breitete sich eine trockene Gekränktheit","I didn't know of any excuse to wish her, but I had no doubt that she would resist. A dry hurt was already spreading","I didn’t know of any excuse that I could have lent her in my mind, but I didn’t doubt that she would be able to resist them. Already an expression of mortification and dryness was spreading over the faces of the persuaders, exhausted by their prolonged smiling; already the good Countess, to preserve her authority, had taken a step backward, with a look of pity and dignity—and then, when there was no longer any need at all, she gave in.","No excuse that I might have wished her to offer occurred to me, but I had no doubt that she would resist them.

"Ich lerne sehen. Ich weiß nicht, woran es liegt, es geht alles tiefer in mich ein und bleibt nicht an der Stelle stehen, wo es sonst immer zu Ende war. Ich habe ein Inneres, von dem ich nicht wußte.

I don’t know why it is, but everything enters me more deeply and doesn’t stop where it once used to. I have an interior that I never knew of. Everything passes into it now. I don’t know what happens there.","[4] I am learning to see. Why, I cannot say, but all things enter more deeply into me; nor do the impressions remain at the level where they used to cease.

"Zwar hat er noch einen Rest von Stimme in sich und mahnt; aber das ist nicht anders als ein Geräusch in einer Lampe oder im Ofen oder wenn es in eigentümlichen Abständen in einer Grotte tropft. Und die Welt ist so eingerichtet, daß es Menschen giebt, die ihr ganzes Leben lang in der Pause vorbeikommen, wenn er, lautloser als alles was sich bewegt, weiter rückt wie ein Zeiger, wie eines Zeigers Schatten, wie die Zeit.","True, he still has a remnant of his voice and warns; but this is not unlike a noise in a lamp, or in a stove, or dripping at odd intervals in a grotto. And the world is arranged in such a way that there are people who come all their lives to pause when it, more silent than anything that moves, advances like a pointer, like a pointer's shadow, like time.","True, he still has a shred of a voice that calls attention to his existence; but it isn’t any different from a noise in a lamp or a stove or the sound water makes when it drips at irregular intervals in a cave.

And the world is so ordered that there are people who are forever passing by, their whole lives long, in that interval when he moves on, making less of a sound than anything else that moves, like the hand of a clock, like the shadow of the hand of a clock, like time itself.","It’s true, he does have the remnants of a voice and calls out with it; but that’s no different from a noise from inside a lamp or the stove, or when drips fall at odd intervals in an underground cave.

"Wie klein ich damals noch gewesen sein muß, sehe ich daran, daß ich auf dem Sessel kniete, um bequem auf den Tisch hinaufzureichen, auf dem ich zeichnete. Es war am Abend, im Winter, wenn ich nicht irre, in der Stadtwohnung. Der Tisch stand in meinem Zimmer, zwischen den Fenstern, und es war keine Lampe im Zimmer, als die, die auf meine Blätter schien und auf Mademoiselles Buch; denn Mademoiselle saß neben mir, etwas zurückgerückt, und las. Sie war weit weg, wenn sie las, ich weiß nicht, ob sie im Buche war; sie konnte lesen, stundenlang, sie blätterte selten um, und ich hatte den Eindruck, als würden die Seiten immer voller unter ihr, als schaute sie Worte hinzu, bestimmte Worte, die sie nötig hatte und die nicht da waren. Das kam mir so vor, während ich zeichnete. Ich zeichnete langsam, ohne sehr entschiedene Absicht, und sah alles, wenn ich nicht weiter wußte, mit ein wenig nach rechts geneigtem Kopfe an; so fiel mir immer am raschesten ein, was noch fehlte. Es waren Offiziere zu Pferd, die in die Schlacht ritten, oder sie waren mitten drin, und das war viel einfacher, weil dann fast nur der Rauch zu machen war, der alles einhüllte. Maman freilich behauptet nun immer, daß es Inseln gewesen waren, was ich malte; Inseln mit großen Bäumen und einem Schloß und einer Treppe und Blumen am Rand, die sich spiegeln sollten im Wasser. Aber ich glaube, das erfindet sie, oder es muß später gewesen sein.","I can see how small I must have been back then by the fact that I was kneeling in the chair so that I could reach comfortably up to the table on which I was drawing. It was in the evening, in winter, if I'm not mistaken, in the city apartment. The table was in my room, between the windows, and there was no lamp in the room but the one that shone on my papers and on Mademoiselle's book; for Mademoiselle sat next to me, a little set back, and read. She was far away when she read, I don't know if she was in the book; she could read for hours, she rarely turned the pages, and I had the impression that the pages were getting fuller and fuller beneath her, as if she was looking at words, specific words that she needed and that weren't there. That's what happened to me while I was drawing. I drew slowly, without very definite intention, and looked at everything, when I was at a loss, with my head tilted a little to the right; That's always the quickest way for me to think of what was still missing. It was officers on horseback who rode into battle, or they were in the middle of it, and that was much easier because then almost all you could do was make the smoke that enshrouded everything. Maman, of course, always maintains that what I painted was islands; Islands with big trees and a castle and a staircase and flowers at the edge that should be reflected in the water. But I think she made that up, or it must have been later.","How small I must have been at that time, I see from the fact that I was kneeling on the armchair so I could comfortably reach up to the table I was drawing on. It was a winter evening, in our apartment in town, if I’m not mistaken. The table stood in my room, between the windows, and there was no lamp in the room except for the one that shone on my pages and on Mademoiselle’s book; for Mademoiselle was sitting beside me, her chair pushed back a little, reading. She was far away when she read, and I don’t know whether she was in her book ; she could read for hours, she seldom turned a page, and I had the impression that the pages kept growing fuller beneath her gaze, as if she looked words onto them, certain words that she needed and that weren’t there. That’s how it seemed to me as I went on drawing. I drew slowly, without any very definite intention, and when I got stuck, I would look at my drawing with my head bent a little to the right; in that position I could always figure out soonest what was missing. They were officers on horseback, who were riding into battle, or they were already in the midst of it—which was much easier, since then almost all you needed to draw was the smoke that covered everything. Maman, it’s true, claimed that I only painted islands—islands with large trees and a castle and a staircase and flowers along the edge that were supposed to be reflected in the water. But I think she was making that up, or it must have been at a later time.","How small I must still have been at the time I can see from the fact that I was kneeling on the armchair to be within easy reach of the table I was drawing on. It was evening, in winter, if I am not mistaken, in our town flat.

She was far away when she was reading; I do not know if she was in her book – she could read for hours on end, seldom turning a page, and I had the impression that the pages kept steadily filling beneath her, as if by looking she were adding words, particular words that she needed and which were not there. That is how it seemed to me while I went on drawing. I drew slowly, without any very definite intention, and whenever I did not know how to go on, I would consider the whole thing with my head inclined a little to the right; that way, I always realized fastest what was still missing. The drawing was of officers on horseback, riding into battle, or already in the thick of it, which was much simpler because then almost all you had to draw was the smoke that enveloped everything. It's true that Maman always maintained that what I drew were islands – islands with large trees and a castle and a flight of steps and flowers along the edge that were meant to be reflected in the water. But I think she is making that up, or else it was later.","I can tell how small I must have been at the time because to be comfortable I had to kneel on the chair to reach the table I was drawing at.

"Eine Weile später schien es mir, als trete man bei meinem Nachbar ein. Unsere Türen waren die letzten im Gang, die seine quer und dicht neben der meinen. Ich wußte indessen, daß er zuweilen Freunde bei sich sah, und, wie gesagt, ich interessierte mich durchaus nicht für seine Verhältnisse.","A while later it seemed to me that one was entering my neighbor's house. Our doors were the last in the corridor, his across and close to mine. I knew, however, that he sometimes saw friends with him, and, as I said, I was not at all interested in his circumstances.","After a while it seemed to me that someone was entering my neighbor’s room. Our doors were the last ones in the hallway; his was at an angle to mine and right next to it. But I knew that he occasionally had friends over and, as I have said, I wasn’t at all interested in his affairs.","After a while I had the impression that someone entered my neighbour's room. Our doors were the last on the passage; his was right next to mine, at an angle. I did know that he occasionally had friends call on him, but, as I have said, I took no interest whatsoever in his affairs; it might be that his door was opened several more times, that people were coming and going out there, but it was really no business of mine.","A while later it seemed to me as if someone were entering my neighbour’s room. Our doors were the last ones on the corridor, his right next to mine and at an angle to it.

"In den Sanatorien, wo ja so gern und mit so viel Dankbarkeit gegen Ärzte und Schwestern gestorben wird, stirbt man einen von den an der Anstalt angestellten Toden; das wird gerne gesehen.","In the sanatoriums, where people die so gladly and with so much gratitude to doctors and nurses, one dies one of the deaths employed by the institution; that's nice to see.","In the sanatoriums, where people die so willingly and with so much gratitude to the doctors and nurses, it is one of those deaths which are attached to the institution; that is looked on favorably.","In sanatoriums, where people die so readily and with so much gratitude towards their doctors and nurses, you die one of the deaths available at the institution, and are approved of accordingly.","In sanatoria, where dying happens so readily and with so much gratitude towards doctors and nurses, you die one of the deaths that the institution has engaged for this purpose; that’s looked-upon favourably."
"Sie wollen es nicht glauben. Jetzt, da so vieles anders wird, wollen sie sich verändern. Sie sind ganz nahe daran, sich aufzugeben und so von sich zu denken, wie Männer etwa von ihnen reden könnten, wenn sie nicht da sind. Das scheint ihnen ihr Fortschritt. Sie sind fast schon überzeugt, daß man einen Genuß sucht und wieder einen und einen noch stärkeren Genuß: daß darin das Leben besteht, wenn man es nicht auf eine alberne Art verlieren will. Sie haben schon angefangen, sich umzusehen, zu suchen; sie, deren Stärke immer darin bestanden hat, gefunden zu werden.","You don't want to believe it. Now that so much is changing, they want to change. They are very close to giving up and thinking of themselves as men might speak of them when they are not around. That seems to them their progress. They are almost convinced that one seeks one pleasure, and another, and an even greater pleasure: that this is life, if one does not want to lose it in a silly way. You've already started to look around, to search; she whose strength has always been in being found.","They don’t want to believe it. Now that so much is changing, they too want to change. They are on the verge of abandoning themselves and thinking about themselves as men might speak of them when they aren’t there. This seems to them like progress.

They have already begun to look around, to search; they, whose strength has always consisted in being found.","They refuse to believe it. Now that so many things are different, they too want to change. They are on the verge of giving themselves up, and of thinking about themselves as men might speak of them in their absence. This they take for progress they have made.

"Nun an diesem selben Abend war es ärger denn je. Es war noch nicht sehr spät, aber ich war aus Müdigkeit schon zu Bett gegangen; ich hielt es für wahrscheinlich, daß ich schlafen würde. Da fuhr ich auf, als hätte man mich berührt. Gleich darauf brach es los. Es sprang und rollte und rannte irgendwo an und schwankte und klappte. Das Stampfen war fürchterlich. Dazwischen klopfte man unten, einen Stock tiefer, deutlich und böse gegen die Decke. Auch der neue Mieter war natürlich gestört. Jetzt: das mußte seine Türe sein. Ich war so wach, daß ich seine Türe zu hören meinte, obwohl er erstaunlich vorsichtig damit umging. Es kam mir vor, als nähere er sich. Sicher wollte er wissen, in welchem Zimmer es sei. Was mich befremdete, war seine wirklich übertriebene Rücksicht. Er hatte doch eben bemerken können, daß es auf Ruhe nicht ankam in diesem Hause. Warum in aller Welt unterdrückte er seinen Schritt? Eine Weile glaubte ich ihn an meiner Tür; und dann vernahm ich, darüber war kein Zweifel, daß er nebenan eintrat. Er trat ohne weiteres nebenan ein.","Well that same evening it was worse than ever. It wasn't very late, but I had already gone to bed from tiredness; I thought it likely that I would sleep. I jumped as if someone had touched me. Immediately after that it broke. It jumped and rolled and ran into something and swayed and flapped. The pounding was terrible. In between there were knocks downstairs, one floor down, clearly and viciously on the ceiling. Of course, the new tenant was also disturbed. Now: that must be his door. I was so awake I thought I heard his door open, although he was surprisingly careful with it. It seemed to me that he was approaching. He must have wanted to know which room it was in. What surprised me was his really exaggerated consideration. He had just been able to notice that quiet wasn't important in this house. Why on earth was he stifling his step? For a while I felt him at my door; and then I heard, there was no doubt about it, that he was coming in next door. He walked in next door without further ado.","Well, on this same evening it was worse than ever. It was not yet very late, but I already felt so tired that I had gone to bed ; I thought I would probably be able to sleep. Suddenly I leaped up as if someone had touched me. Right afterward, it began. It jumped and rolled and slammed against something and rocked and clattered. The stamping was horrible. As this was going on, someone downstairs began banging, distinctly and angrily, on the ceiling. The new tenant was naturally upset. Now: that had to be his door. I was so wide awake that I thought I heard his door, though he was astonishingly careful in opening it. It seemed to me that he was approaching. He would certainly try to find out what room the noise was coming from. But I thought it was strange that he was being so exaggeratedly considerate. He must have noticed, after all, that silence didn’t exactly have first priority in this house. Why in the world was he softening his footsteps? For a moment I thought he was standing at my door; and then I heard him—there was no doubt about it—walking into the next room. He walked in without knocking.","That evening, though, it was worse than ever. It was not yet particularly late, but I was tired and had already gone to bed; I thought I would probably get some sleep. Suddenly I started as if someone had touched me. Immediately after, it began. It rebounded and rolled and knocked against something and teetered and came to a clattering stop. The stamping was fearful. While this was going on, someone on the floor below was banging distinctly and angrily on the ceiling. The new lodger was being disturbed as well, of course. Now: that had to be his door. I was so wide awake that I thought I heard his door despite the extraordinary care he took when opening it. I imagined he was coming closer. Doubtless he wanted to know which room the noise was coming from. What irritated me was his truly overdone show of consideration. After all, he had just been able to see just how little store was set by peace and quiet in that establishment. Why on earth was he treading so softly? For a moment I thought he was at my door; and then I heard him, beyond the shadow of a doubt, entering the next room. Without any ado, he walked right in.","Well, on that particular evening it was worse than ever. It wasn’t very late but I’d already gone to bed because I was so tired ; I thought I’d probably get some sleep. I sat up with a start as if someone had touched me, whereupon all hell broke loose. There was jumping and rolling and bumping into things and rocking and flapping. The stamping was horrendous. At intervals from below, one storey down, there were firm and angry knocks on the ceiling. The new tenant was disturbed, too, of course. Now: that must be his door. I was so wide awake that I thought I could hear his door even though he went about opening it extraordinarily carefully. It felt as if he were getting closer. I’m sure he wanted to know which room the noise was coming from. What disconcerted me was the quite exaggerated consideration he was showing. He had been able to tell just now that in this house they didn’t set much store by quiet. Why on earth was he muffling his footsteps? For a while I thought he was outside my door; and then I could tell without any doubt whatsoever that he was entering the room next door. Just like that—he walked straight into the room next door."
"Ich versuche es, Dir zu schreiben, obwohl es eigentlich nichts giebt nach einem notwendigen Abschied.

Dein Theater entstand. Du konntest nicht warten, daß dieses fast raumlose von den Jahrhunderten zu Tropfen zusammengepreßte Leben von den anderen Künsten gefunden und allmählich versichtbart werde für einzelne, die sich nach und nach zusammenfinden zur Einsicht und die endlich verlangen, gemeinsam die erlauchten Gerüchte bestätigt zu sehen im Gleichnis der vor ihnen aufgeschlagenen Szene. Dies konntest du nicht abwarten, du warst da, du mußtest das kaum Meßbare: ein Gefühl, das um einen halben Grad stieg, den Ausschlagswinkel eines von fast nichts beschwerten Willens, den du ablasest von ganz nah, die leichte Trübung in einem Tropfen Sehnsucht und dieses Nichts von Farbenwechsel in einem Atom von Zutrauen: dieses mußtest du feststellen und aufbehalten; denn in solchen Vorgängen war jetzt das Leben, unser Leben, das in uns hineingeglitten war, das sich nach innen zurückgezogen hatte, so tief, daß es kaum noch Vermutungen darüber gab.","transitions. And there, because showing things was in your blood and not creating or saying, there you made the tremendous decision to enlarge this tiny thing, which you yourself first only saw through glasses, all by yourself so that it was in front of thousands. huge, in front of everyone. Your theater was born. You could not wait for this almost spaceless life, compressed into drops by the centuries, to be found by the other arts and gradually made visible to individuals who gradually come together to gain insight and who finally long to see the illustrious rumors confirmed in the parable the scene before them. You couldn't wait for this, you were there, you had to do the barely measurable: a feeling that rose by half a degree, the amplitude of a will weighed down by almost nothing, which you read from very close up, the slight cloudiness in a drop of longing and this nothingness of changing colors in an atom of trust: you had to ascertain and retain this; for in such events life, our life, which had slipped into us, which had withdrawn inward, was so deep that there was hardly any suspicion about it.","In there, where, mistrustful, you wouldn’t take anyone with you, in there you sat and discerned transitions. And there, since your blood drove you not to form or to speak, but to reveal, there you made the enormous decision to so magnify these tiny events, which you yourself first perceived only in test tubes, that they would be seen by thousands of people, immense before them all. Your theater came into being. You couldn’t wait until this life almost without spatial reality, this life which had been condensed by the weight of the centuries into a few small drops, could be discovered by the other arts: until it could gradually be made visible to a few connoisseurs who, little by little, acquire insight and finally demand to see these august rumors confirmed in the parable of the scene opened in front of them. You couldn’t wait for that; you were there, and everything that is barely measurable—an emotion that rises by half a degree, the angle of deflection, read off from up close, of a will burdened by an almost infinitesimal weight, the slight cloudiness in a drop of longing, and that barely perceptible color-change in an atom of confidence—all this you had to determine and record. For it is in such reactions that life existed, our life, which had slipped into us, had drawn back inside us so deeply that it was hardly possible even to make conjectures about it any more.","But on the far side you lingered, bowed over, where the events of our lives boil and precipitate and change colour, deep inside, deeper within than anyone had ever been; a door had opened for you, and now you were in amid the retorts, in the glare of the flames, in where you never took anyone with you, mistrustful man – there you sat, determining the points of change. And there, since to reveal was in your blood rather than to fashion or express, there you made the mighty decision to focus solely on the tiny things that you yourself had at first perceived only through the lens, and to magnify them so that they would be plainly visible, in all their enormity, to thousands. So your theatre came into being. You could not wait for this life virtually without spatial substance, condensed by the centuries into drops, to be discovered by the other arts and gradually rendered visible for those few who, little by little, would come together in their insight and at length demand to see these sublime whisperings confirmed in the parable of the scene unfolding before them. You could not wait for that. There you were, and you had to determine and note down things that could scarcely be measured: an increase of half a degree in a feeling; the angle, which you read at close quarters, at which a will almost unburdened reacts; the slight cloudiness in a drop of longing; and that infinitesimal change of colour in an atom of trust. For life was now to be found in such processes, our life that had slipped into us and had withdrawn so deep inside that it was hardly possible to conjecture about it any more.","* You never took anyone along there, mistrustful one, but sat and determined moments of transition. And there, because revealing things was in your very blood—not shaping or telling—there you took the prodigious decision to magnify a tiny thing that at first even you could only see through lenses,* magnify it alone in such a way that it would be revealed to thousands, gigantically, to everyone. Thus your theatre came into existence. You could not wait for this life—which, concentrated into droplets by the centuries, occupies almost no space—to be found by the other arts and to be made visible gradually to individuals who, little by little, come together in insight and at last demand to see the illustrious rumours confirmed in the parable that is the scene unfolded before them. You couldn’t wait for this, you were there, you had to uncover what was hardly measurable: a feeling that rose by half a degree, the tiny fluctuation in amplitude, measured from close up, of a will hardly counterweighted* by anything at all, the slight cloudiness of a droplet of longing, and this phantom of a colour change in an atom of trust—all this had to be found and recorded, for in such events was now located life, our life, which had slipped inside us, which had retreated into our interior and lay so deep that it hardly even gave rise to conjecture any more."
"Und ich war es in der Tat. Ich war beschäftigt, ihn mir vorzustellen, ich unternahm die Arbeit, ihn einzubilden, und der Schweiß trat mir aus vor Anstrengung. Denn ich mußte ihn machen wie man einen Toten macht, für den keine Beweise mehr da sind, keine Bestandteile; der ganz und gar innen zu leisten ist. Ich weiß jetzt, daß es mir ein wenig half, an die vielen abgenommenen Christusse aus streifigem Elfenbein zu denken, die bei allen Althändlern herumliegen. Der Gedanke an irgendeine Pietà trat vor und ab--: dies alles wahrscheinlich nur, um eine gewisse Neigung hervorzurufen, in der sein langes Gesicht sich hielt, und den trostlosen Bartnachwuchs im Wangenschatten und die endgültig schmerzvolle Blindheit seines verschlossenen Ausdrucks, der schräg aufwärts gehalten war. Aber es war außerdem so vieles, was zu ihm gehörte; denn dies begriff ich schon damals, daß nichts an ihm nebensächlich sei: nicht die Art, wie der Rock oder der Mantel, hinten abstehend, überall den Kragen sehen ließ, diesen niedrigen Kragen, der in einem großen Bogen um den gestreckten, nischigen Hals stand, ohne ihn zu berühren; nicht die grünlich schwarze Krawatte, die weit um das Ganze herumgeschnallt war; und ganz besonders nicht der Hut, ein alter, hochgewölbter, steifer Filzhut, den er trug wie alle Blinden ihre Hüte tragen: ohne Bezug zu den Zeilen des Gesichts, ohne die Möglichkeit, aus diesem Hinzukommenden und sich selbst eine neue äußere Einheit zu bilden; nicht anders als irgendeinen verabredeten fremden Gegenstand. In meiner Feigheit, nicht hinzusehen, brachte ich es so weit, daß das Bild dieses Mannes sich schließlich oft auch ohne Anlaß stark und schmerzhaft in mir zusammenzog zu so hartem Elend, daß ich mich, davon bedrängt, entschloß, die zunehmende Fertigkeit meiner Einbildung durch die auswärtige Tatsache einzuschüchtern und aufzuheben. Es war gegen Abend. Ich nahm mir vor, sofort aufmerksam an ihm vorbeizugehen.","And indeed I was. I was busy imagining him, I was doing the work of imagining him, and I was sweating from the exertion. Because I had to make him like one makes a dead man for which there is no longer any evidence, no parts; which has to be done entirely inside. I know now that it helped me a little to think of all the stripped ivory Christs that were taken off and lying around at all the antique dealers. The thought of some Pietà stepped back and forth--: all this probably only to evoke a certain inclination in which his long face held itself, and the desolate growth of beard in the shadow of the cheeks and the finally painful blindness of his withdrawn expression, which was held slanted upwards was. But there was also so much that belonged to him; for I understood even then that nothing about him was unimportant: not the way the coat or the coat, sticking out at the back, showed the collar everywhere, this low collar that stood in a large arc around the stretched, niche neck , without touching him; not the greenish black tie buckled wide around the whole; and especially not the hat, an old, high-domed, stiff felt hat, which he wore as all blind men wear their hats: unrelated to the lines of the face, without the possibility of forming a new external unity out of this addition and itself; no different from any agreed foreign object. In my cowardice of not looking, I got so far that the image of this man finally, often without any reason, tightened and painfully contracted inside me to such hard misery that I, pressed by it, decided to use the increasing skill of my imagination to intimidate and annul the foreign fact. It was towards evening. I made a mental note to walk past him immediately.","And in fact I was. I was busy picturing him to myself; I had undertaken the task of imagining him, and was sweating from the effort. For I had to make him as you make a dead man, who has lost all the proofs and all the constituent parts of his existence, who has to be achieved entirely within you. I know now that it helped me a little to think of those many demounted Christs made of striated ivory that lie around in every antique shop. The thought of some Pietà came and went—: all this probably just to evoke a particular angle at which his long face was held, and the desolate stubble in the shadows of his cheeks, and the definitively painful blindness of his sealed-up expression, which was turned obliquely upward. But there was so much in addition that belonged to him; for even then I understood that nothing about him was insignificant: not the way that his jacket or coat, gaping at the back, let his collar be seen all the way around—that low collar, which curved in a wide arc around the stretched and pitted neck, without touching it; not the greenish black tie loosely fastened around him; and especially not the hat, an old, high-crowned, stiff felt hat, which he wore the way all blind men wear their hats: without any relation to the lines of the face, without the possibility of adding this feature to themselves and forming a new external unity: but merely as an arbitrary, extraneous object. In my cowardly refusal to look at him, I went so far that finally the image of this man, often for no reason at all, intensely and painfully contracted inside me to such a harsh wretchedness that, no longer able to bear it, I decided to intimidate and neutralize the increasingly precise picture in my imagination by confronting it with the external reality. It was toward evening. I told myself to walk by and look at him closely.","And so I was. I was preoccupied with picturing his life; I had embarked on the task of imagining him, and the effort had brought out a sweat on me. For I had to make him up as you would make up a dead man for whom no evidence and no remains exist, one who has to be constituted entirely within yourself. I now know that it helped me a little to think of all those Christs of striated ivory, unmounted from their crosses, that lie around in every antique shop. The thought of some pietà occurred, and passed again – all no doubt merely to call to my mind the particular angle at which his long face was bowed, and the desolate aftergrowth of stubble in the hollows of his cheeks, and the painful finality of the blindness in his closed-up expression, turned obliquely upwards. But there was so much besides that was very much his; for even then I grasped that nothing about him was unimportant: not the way that his jacket or coat, sitting too loosely at the back, exposed the whole of his collar, that low collar that enclosed in a wide curve his stretched-out, hollowed neck without ever touching it; not the greenish-black cravat fastened loosely about all of these; and most especially not his hat, an old, high-crowned, stiff felt hat which he wore as all blind men wear their hats, with no regard to the lines of their faces, and without the possibility of combining the accessory with their own selves to form a new unity for the outer world, but merely as some agreed extraneous item. In my cowardly refusal to look at him, I finally arrived at a point where the image of this man, often without any reason, would so powerfully and painfully distil into so harsh a misery within me that, upset by the experience, I decided to defy the growing resourcefulness of my imagination by confronting it with the external reality, and so setting it at nought. Evening was falling. I decided to walk past him attentively right away.","And in truth I was. I was preoccupied in picturing him; I undertook the task of imagining him and the effort brought me out in a sweat. For I had to construct him the way one constructs a dead person for whom there is no evidence any more, no components; someone who is to be made in an exclusively inward fashion. I now know that it helped a little to think about all those deposed Christs made of striated ivory that every antique dealer’s has lying around. The thought of some Pietà* came into my mind and went again:— this was probably all to conjure up a particular angle at which his long face was held and the dismal stubble of beard in the shadow of his cheeks and the final painful blindness of his impenetrable expression directed diagonally upwards. But there was so much else besides that was part of him; for I understood even then that nothing about him was incidental: not the way his jacket or coat stuck out at the back and showed his collar all round, the low collar that stood in a great arc around his elongated, pocked neck without touching it; not the greenish black tie that was fastened loosely round all that; and especially not the hat, an old, high-domed, stiff felt hat that he wore the way all blind people wear their hats: without any connection to the lines of the face, without the possibility of combining this auxiliary feature and their own selves to form a new unity; nothing except an arbitrary, accepted, alien object. In my cowardly determination not to look I reached the point where the image of this man, unprompted, finally condensed strongly and painfully within me into harsh misery, where I felt beleaguered by it and determined to use external facts to intimidate and suppress the growing proficiency of my imagination. It was getting on for evening. I resolved to walk past him at once, paying attention."
"Er winkte den andern Kellnern, drehte das lachende Gesicht ein paarmal schnell von rechts nach links, um alle herbeizurufen und selbst nichts zu versäumen. Nun standen alle und blickten hinuntersehend oder -suchend, lächelnd oder ärgerlich, daß sie noch nicht entdeckt hatten, was Lächerliches es gäbe.","He waved to the other waiters, turning his smiling face quickly from right to left a couple of times to call everyone and not miss anything himself. Now everyone stood and looked down, looking or searching, smiling or angry that they hadn't discovered what was ridiculous.","He gestured to the other waiters, turned his laughing face quickly from right to left several times, to call everyone over without missing anything himself. Now they all stood there, seeing or trying to see what was happening down the street, smiling or annoyed that they hadn’t yet found out what was so funny.","He beckoned the other waiters over, turning his laughing face rapidly from right to left a couple of times, so that while he called them all across he missed nothing himself. There they now all stood, looking down the street, or trying to see, smiling or vexed, whatever the absurdity was that they had not yet made out.","He waved the other waiters across, turned his laughing face a few times to left and right to gather them all round and so as not to miss anything. Now they were all standing and looking—or searching—down the street, smiling or irritated because they had not yet worked out what there was to laugh at."
"Der junge lothringische Fürst, der tags vorher, gleich nach der merkwürdig hastigen Schlacht in seiner elenden Stadt Nancy eingeritten war, hatte ganz früh seine Umgebung geweckt und nach dem Herzog gefragt. Bote um Bote wurde ausgesandt, und er selbst erschien von Zeit zu Zeit am Fenster, unruhig und besorgt.","The young prince of Lorraine, who had ridden into his wretched town of Nancy the day before, immediately after the remarkably hasty battle, had woken those around him very early and asked for the duke. Messenger after messenger was sent out, and he himself appeared at the window from time to time, restless and worried.","The young Duke of Lorraine, who the day before had ridden into his wretched city of Nancy after the remarkably short battle, had awakened his entourage very early in the morning and asked for the Duke of Burgundy. Messenger after messenger was dispatched, and he himself appeared at the window from time to time, restless and worried.","The young Duke of Lorraine, who the day before had ridden into his wretched town of Nancy after that remarkably precipitate battle, had wakened his entourage at a very early hour and asked after the Duke of Burgundy. One messenger after another was dispatched, and he himself appeared at the window from time to time, restless and anxious.","* The young prince from Lorraine, who the day before, straight after the strangely short battle, had ridden into the wretched city of Nancy, had woken his entourage very early and asked after the Duke. Envoy after envoy was sent out and he himself appeared from time to time at the window, restless and concerned."
"Aber auch abgesehen davon, ist diese Begebenheit durchaus nicht veraltet. Es wäre jetzt ein Erzähler denkbar, der viel Sorgfalt an die letzten Augenblicke wendete; er hätte nicht unrecht. Es geht eine Menge in ihnen vor: Wie er aus dem innersten Schlaf ans Fenster springt und über das Fenster hinaus in den Hof zwischen die Wachen. Er kann allein nicht auf; sie müssen ihm helfen. Wahrscheinlich ist der Fuß gebrochen. An zwei von den Männern gelehnt, fühlt er, daß sie an ihn glauben. Er sieht sich um: auch die andern glauben an ihn. Sie dauern ihn fast, diese riesigen Strelitzen, es muß weit gekommen sein: sie haben Iwan Grosnij gekannt in all seiner Wirklichkeit, und glauben an ihn. Er hätte Lust, sie aufzuklären, aber den Mund öffnen, hieße einfach schreien. Der Schmerz im Fuß ist rasend, und er hält so wenig von sich in diesem Moment, daß er nichts weiß als den Schmerz. Und dann ist keine Zeit. Sie drängen heran, er sieht den Schuiskij und hinter ihm alle. Gleich wird es vorüber sein. Aber da schließen sich seine Wachen. Sie geben ihn nicht auf. Und ein Wunder geschieht. Der Glauben dieser alten Männer pflanzt sich fort, auf einmal will niemand mehr vor. Schuiskij, dicht vor ihm, ruft verzweifelt nach einem Fenster hinauf. Er sieht sich nicht um. Er weiß, wer dort steht; er begreift, daß es still wird, ganz ohne Übergang still.","But even apart from that, this incident is by no means outdated. A narrator might now be conceivable who paid much attention to the final moments; he wouldn't be wrong. A lot is going on in them: How he jumps out of his innermost sleep to the window and out through the window into the yard between the guards. He can't get up alone; you have to help him. The foot is probably broken. Leaning against two of the men, he feels that they believe in him. He looks around: the others also believe in him. They almost pity him, these gigantic stragglers, it must have come a long way: they knew Ivan Grozny in all his reality and believe in him. He'd like to enlighten her, but opening his mouth is just screaming. The pain in his foot is raging and he thinks so little of himself at that moment that he knows nothing but the pain. And then there is no time. They crowd in, he sees Shuisky and everyone behind him. It will be over soon. But then his guards close. You don't give up on him. And a miracle happens. The faith of these old men is propagated, suddenly no one wants to advance. Shuisky, close in front of him, desperately calls up to a window. He doesn't look around. He knows who is standing there; he understands that it's getting quiet, quiet without any transition.","But even aside from that, this incident is not in the least out of date. It is possible even now to imagine a storyteller who would devote a great deal of attention to these last moments; and he wouldn’t be wrong in doing so. They are crowded with action: how, shaken from the depths of sleep, he leaps to the window and out over the window, down into the courtyard among the guards. He can’t get up by himself; they have to help him. Probably he has broken his foot. Leaning on two of the men, he senses that they believe in him. He looks around: the others believe in him too. He almost feels pity for them, these gigantic streltsy; what a sorry state of affairs: they have known Ivan Grozny in all his reality, and still they believe in him. He would like to enlighten them; but opening his mouth would mean screaming. The pain in his foot is agonizing, and he thinks so little of himself at this moment that he isn’t aware of anything but the pain. And then there is no time. They are crowding in; he sees Shuisky, and behind him all the others. Soon it will be over. But now his guards close around him. They aren’t giving him up. And a miracle happens. The faith of these old men spreads; all at once no one is willing to step forward. Shuisky, right in front of him, calls up in desperation to an upper window. He doesn’t look around. He knows who is standing there; he realizes that everything has become silent, without any transition: absolute silence.","But leaving that aside, this incident is in no way out of date. We could imagine a writer of our own time who would labour meticulously over those last moments; nor would he be wrong to do so. A great deal happens in them: waking from a deep sleep, he leaps to the window, and out of the window into the courtyard, landing among the sentries. He cannot get to his feet unaided; they have to help him. Quite likely he has broken his foot. Leaning on two of the men, he senses that they believe in him. He looks around: the others believe in him too. He almost feels sorry for them , these gigantic streltsy – it must be quite a change: they knew Ivan Grozny, in all his reality, and they believe in him. He wouldn't mind enlightening them, but if he opened his mouth he'd simply scream. The pain in his foot is excruciating, and right now he thinks so little of himself that all he is aware of is the pain. And then there is no time. They come crowding round, he sees Shuisky, and behind him all the others. Presently it will be over. But his bodyguards close round him. They are not going to abandon him. And a miracle happens. The faith of these old men spreads; suddenly, no one will advance. Shuisky, right before him, calls up in desperation to an upper window. The impostor does not look round. He knows who is standing there; he realizes that silence has fallen, a sudden and total silence.","But even setting that aside, this episode is by no means dated. One could conceive of a modern story-teller, one who took great care with last moments; he would not be wrong to do so. A good deal happens during them: how he leaped over to the window just as he was waking from the deepest sleep and out of the window into the courtyard between the guards. He can’t get up on his own; they have to help him. His foot is probably broken. Supported by two of the men, he feels that they believe in him. He looks round: the others believe in him, too. They almost pity him, these enormous streltsy,* things must have changed a good deal: they knew Ivan Grosnii in all his substantive reality, and they believe in him. He might have wished to disabuse them, but if he’d opened his mouth he would simply have screamed. The pain in his foot is excruciating, and at this moment he thinks so little of himself that all he knows is pain. And then there is no time. They crowd forwards, he sees Shuisky* and behind him all the rest. It will soon be over. But then his guards close ranks. They won’t hand him over. And a miracle occurs. The faith of these old men spreads amongst the others, suddenly no one wants to step forward. Shuisky, standing right in front of him, calls in desperation up to a window. He doesn’t look round. He knows who is standing there; he knows that silence will fall, silence abruptly and without transition."
"Er lag und hatte die Augen geschlossen. Und es gab Zeiten, weniger bewegte Tage sozusagen, wo es ganz erträglich war. Und dann hatte er sich das ausgedacht mit den Gedichten. Man sollte nicht glauben, wie das half. Wenn man so ein Gedicht langsam hersagte, mit gleichmäßiger Betonung der Endreime, dann war gewissermaßen etwas Stabiles da, worauf man sehen konnte, innerlich versteht sich. Ein Glück, daß er alle diese Gedichte wußte. Aber er hatte sich immer ganz besonders für Literatur interessiert. Er beklagte sich nicht über seinen Zustand, versicherte mir der Student, der ihn lange kannte.","He was lying with his eyes closed. And there were times, less turbulent days, so to speak, when it was quite bearable. And then he came up with the poems. You wouldn't believe how that helped. If you said a poem like that slowly, with an even emphasis on the end rhymes, then there was something stable that you could look at, internally, of course. Lucky that he knew all these poems. But he had always been particularly interested in literature. He did not complain about his condition, the student who had known him for a long time assured me.","He lay there and kept his eyes closed. And there were times, during the less shaken days, so to speak, when it was quite bearable. And then he had devised this routine with the poems. It was unbelievable how much that helped. When you recited a poem slowly, with a regular emphasis on the rhyme words, then something more or less stable existed, which you could keep a steady gaze on, inwardly of course. It was lucky that he knew all these poems by heart. But he had always been particularly interested in literature. He didn’t complain about his situation, said the student, who had known him for many years.","He lay with his eyes closed.

"Möglicherweise hatte er Erinnerungen; jetzt aber kam nie mehr etwas zu seiner Seele hinzu als täglich das amorphe Gefühl des Steinrands hinter ihm, an dem seine Hand sich abnutzte. Ich war stehngeblieben, und während ich das alles fast gleichzeitig sah, fühlte ich, daß er einen anderen Hut hatte und eine ohne Zweifel sonntägliche Halsbinde; sie war schräg in gelben und violetten Vierecken gemustert, und was den Hut angeht, so war es ein billiger neuer Strohhut mit einem grünen Band. Es liegt natürlich nichts an diesen Farben, und es ist kleinlich, daß ich sie behalten habe. Ich will nur sagen, daß sie an ihm waren wie das Weicheste auf eines Vogels Unterseite. Er selbst hatte keine Lust daran, und wer von allen (ich sah mich um) durfte meinen, dieser Staat wäre um seinetwillen?","Maybe he had memories; but now nothing ever came more to his soul than the daily amorphous feeling of the stone rim behind him, on which his hand was wearing. I had stopped, and while I saw it all almost simultaneously, I felt that he had a different hat and a cravat no doubt Sunday; it was diagonally patterned in yellow and purple squares, and as for the hat, it was a cheap new straw hat with a green band. It's nothing to do with these colors, of course, and it's petty that I kept them. I'm just saying they were on him like the softest thing on a bird's underside. He himself had no desire to do so, and who of all (I looked around) could think that this state was for his sake?","He may possibly have had memories; but now no experience was ever added to his soul except the amorphous feeling of the stone ledge behind him, on which his hand was being gradually worn away.

The colors are meaningless, of course, and it’s petty of me to remember them. I just want to say that on him they were like the softest down on a bird’s breast.

"Alle meine Verse aber sind anders entstanden, also sind es keine.--Und als ich mein Drama schrieb, wie irrte ich da. War ich ein Nachahmer und Narr, daß ich eines Dritten bedurfte, um von dem Schicksal zweier Menschen zu erzählen, die es einander schwer machten? Wie leicht ich in die Falle fiel. Und ich hätte doch wissen müssen, daß dieser Dritte, der durch alle Leben und Literaturen geht, dieses Gespenst eines Dritten, der nie gewesen ist, keine Bedeutung hat, daß man ihn leugnen muß. Er gehört zu den Vorwänden der Natur, welche immer bemüht ist, von ihren tiefsten Geheimnissen die Aufmerksamkeit der Menschen abzulenken. Er ist der Wandschirm, hinter dem ein Drama sich abspielt. Er ist der Lärm am Eingang zu der stimmlosen Stille eines wirklichen Konfliktes. Man möchte meinen, es wäre allen bisher zu schwer gewesen, von den Zweien zu reden, um die es sich handelt; der Dritte, gerade weil er so unwirklich ist, ist das Leichte der Aufgabe, ihn konnten sie alle. Gleich am Anfang ihrer Dramen merkt man die Ungeduld, zu dem Dritten zu kommen, sie könnten ihn kaum erwarten. Sowie er da ist, ist alles gut. Aber wie langweilig, wenn er sich verspätet, es kann rein nichts geschehen ohne ihn, alles steht, stockt, wartet. Ja und wie, wenn es bei diesem Stauen und Anstehn bliebe? Wie, Herr Dramatiker, und du, Publikum, welches das Leben kennt, wie, wenn er verschollen wäre, dieser beliebte Lebemann oder dieser anmaßende junge Mensch, der in allen Ehen schließt wie ein Nachschlüssel? Wie, wenn ihn, zum Beispiel, der Teufel geholt hätte? Nehmen wirs an.","But all my verses came about differently, so there are none.--And when I wrote my drama, how wrong I was. Was I an imitator and a fool that I needed a third person to tell of the fate of two people who made things difficult for each other? How easily I fell into the trap. And I should have known that this third party that runs through all lives and literatures, this specter of a third party that never existed, has no meaning and that one has to deny it. It is one of the pretexts of nature, which always tries to distract people's attention from its deepest secrets. He is the screen behind which a drama is unfolding. He is the noise at the entrance to the voiceless silence of real conflict. One would think that it would have been too difficult for everyone to speak of the two in question; the third, precisely because it is so unreal, is the easy part of the task, they could all do it. Right at the beginning of their dramas one notices the impatience to get to the third one, they could hardly wait for him. As long as he is there, everything is fine. But how boring when he's late, absolutely nothing can happen without him, everything stands still, stands still, waits. Yes, and what if it stayed with this queuing and queuing? How, Herr dramatist, and you, the public who know life, what if he had disappeared, this popular bon vivant or this arrogant young man who makes marriages like a duplicate key? What if, for example, the devil had taken him? Let's assume.","But all my poems had a different origin; so they are not poems.—And when I wrote my play, how far I wandered from the point. Was I an imitator or a fool, that I needed a third person in order to present the fate of two people who were making life difficult for each other? How easily I fell into the trap. And yet I should have known that this third person who passes through all lives and literatures, this ghost of a third person who has never existed, has no meaning and must be disavowed. He is one of the pretences of Nature, which is always careful to divert men’s attention from her deepest mysteries. He is the partition behind which the play is performed. He is the noise at the entryway to the voiceless silence of a true conflict. It could be said that every playwright up to now has found it too difficult to speak of the two whom the drama is really about. The third person, just because he is so unreal, is the easiest part of the problem; they have all been able to manage him; from the very first scene you can feel their impatience to have him enter; they can hardly wait. The moment he appears, everything is all right. But how tedious when he’s late. Absolutely nothing can happen without him; everything slows down, stops, waits. Yes, and what if this delay were to continue? What, my dear playwright, and you, dear audience who know life so well, what if he were declared missing—that popular man-about-town or that arrogant youth, who fits into every marriage like a skeleton-key? What if, for example, the devil had taken him? Let’s suppose this.","All of my poems, however, originated in a different manner, and so they are not poems. – And when I wrote my play, what a mistake I made. Was I an imitator, and a fool, that I needed a third person to describe the fate of two people who were making things difficult for each other? How easily I fell into the trap. And I ought to have known that that third person who is present in every life and every literature, that ghost of a third who has never existed, is quite without meaning, and must be disavowed. He is one of the pretexts of Nature, who is always trying to distract humankind's prying attentions from her inmost secrets. He is the screen behind which a drama occurs. He is the noise that precedes the voiceless silence of true conflict. One has the impression that every dramatist to date has found it too difficult to speak of those two who are in fact the crux; the third, precisely because he is so unreal, is the unproblematic part of the task, and they have all been able to deal with him. From the very start of their plays, one senses their impatience to bring on this third person. They can hardly wait. Once he makes his appearance, all is well. But how tedious it is if he is late: nothing whatsoever can happen without him, everything comes to a standstill, drags, hangs fire. And what if this dammed-up stasis were all that there was to the play? How would it be, my dear dramatist, and you, the audience, who know what life is, if he had gone missing, that popular man of the world or that toffee-nosed young man who fits every marriage like a skeleton key? What if, say, the devil had spirited him away? Let's say that is what happens.","However, all my poetry arose quite differently, so it really isn’t poetry at all.—And when I wrote my play, how wrong I went. Was I such an emulator and fool that I needed a third party* to tell us about the fate of two people who were making life difficult for each other? How easily I fell into that trap. And I surely ought to have known that this third party, who appears in all lives and literatures, this ghost of a third person, has no meaning at all, that he ought to be disavowed. He is one of Nature’s pretexts, for she is always at pains to distract humanity from her deepest secrets. He is the screen behind which a drama unfolds. He is the noise at the entrance to the voiceless quiet of a genuine conflict. I’m tempted to think that everyone has hitherto found it too difficult to speak about the two people at the heart of it; the third one, precisely because he is so unreal, is the easiest part of the task, anyone could write him. Right from the beginning of these dramas you notice their impatience to get to the third party, they can hardly wait for him to appear. Once he’s there, everything is fine. But how boring it is if he’s late, absolutely nothing can happen without him, everything comes to a standstill, pauses, waits. Yes, and what if they didn’t get past this pile-up, this logjam? What if, Mr Playwright, and you, the Public, who know about life, what if he were lost without trace, this well-liked man-about-town or this bumptious young person who fits into every marriage like a master-key? What if, for instance, he has been whisked off by the Devil? Let’s assume he has."
"Sie hielt darauf, es recht scherzend zu sagen; aber das Entsetzen schüttelte sie bei dem Gedanken an alle die schlecht befestigten Nadeln, die jeden Augenblick irgendwo hineinfallen konnten.",She kept saying it jokingly; but she shook with horror at the thought of all the badly fastened needles that might at any moment fall somewhere.,"But to me, she would sometimes turn, suddenly, (for I was already a little bit grown up) and, with a smile that was a great effort for her, she would say: “What a lot of needles there are, Malte; they are lying around everywhere, and when you think how easily they could fall …” She meant to say this in a playful tone of voice; but horror shook her at the thought of all the poorly fastened needles, which could fall down anywhere, at any moment.","To me, however, she might turn abruptly (for I was fairly grown up by then) and say with a smile that cost her a distinct effort: ‘What a lot of needles there are, Malte, lying around everywhere, and if you think how easily they fall out…’ She meant to say it in a jocular tone; but a tremor of horror went through her at the thought of all those poorly secured needles which might fall into something at any moment.","She took pains to say it jestingly, but she trembled with horror at the thought of all the badly fastened needles that might drop into something at any moment."
"Und mit dem, was kommt, hebt sich ein ganzes Gewirr irrer Erinnerungen, das daranhängt wie nasser Tang an einer versunkenen Sache. Leben, von denen man nie erfahren hätte, tauchen empor und mischen sich unter das, was wirklich gewesen ist, und verdrängen Vergangenes, das man zu kennen glaubte: denn in dem, was aufsteigt, ist eine ausgeruhte, neue Kraft, das aber, was immer da war, ist müde von zu oftem Erinnern.","And with what comes, a whole tangle of insane memories rises, clinging to it like wet seaweed to a sunken thing. Lives of which one would never have heard emerge and mingle with what really happened, and repress the past that one thought one knew: because in what rises there is a rested, new force, but what was always there is tired of remembering too much.","And with what comes, a whole tangle of confused memories arises, hanging from it like wet seaweed on a sunken boat. Lives that you would never have known about bob to the surface and mingle with what really happened, and drive out a past that you thought you knew: for in what rises there is a new, rested strength, while what was always there is tired out from too much remembrance.","And with whatever it is that comes back, there rises a whole tangle of muddled memories, clinging to it like wet seaweed on some sunken thing. Lives of which one knew nothing come to the surface and commingle with what has really been, displacing the past one thought familiar: for there is a fresh and rested strength in whatever it is that rises to the surface, while the things that have always been there are tired from too frequent remembering.","And alongside what comes up, a whole tangle of their memories emerges, clinging to it like wet seaweed to a sunken thing. Lives of which we would forever have been ignorant rise to the surface and are mixed in with what has been real, and they displace things from the past that we thought we knew about, for in what rises up like this there is a fresh new power, while what has always been there is weary from having been recalled too often."

Du kannst mir helfen."" Abelone wußte es noch wie gestern.","It was therefore something quite extraordinary that once after breakfast he waved to Abelone: ""We have the same habits, it seems, I also write very early.

Abelone still knew it like yesterday.","It was therefore something quite extraordinary when one day after breakfast he gestured for Abelone to approach him. “We have the same habits, it seems; I too write very early in the morning. You can help me.” Abelone still remembered it as if it were yesterday.",So it was quite extraordinary when one day after breakfast he beckoned Abelone over to him: ‘It seems we have the same habits. I write at the crack of dawn as well. You can help me.’ Abelone remembered it as if it were yesterday.,"It was an extraordinary event, therefore, when once, after breakfast, he called Abelone over to him: ‘We have the same habits, it seems, I also like to write early in the morning.

"Mein Gott, mein Gott, wenn mir noch solche Nächte bevorstehen, laß mir doch wenigstens einen von den Gedanken, die ich zuweilen denken konnte. Es ist nicht so unvernünftig, was ich da verlange; denn ich weiß, daß sie gerade aus der Furcht gekommen sind, weil meine Furcht so groß war. Da ich ein Knabe war, schlugen sie mich ins Gesicht und sagten mir, daß ich feige sei. Das war, weil ich mich noch schlecht fürchtete. Aber seitdem habe ich mich fürchten gelernt mit der wirklichen Furcht, die nur zunimmt, wenn die Kraft zunimmt, die sie erzeugt. Wir haben keine Vorstellung von dieser Kraft, außer in unserer Furcht. Denn so ganz unbegreiflich ist sie, so völlig gegen uns, daß unser Gehirn sich zersetzt an der Stelle, wo wir uns anstrengen, sie zu denken. Und dennoch, seit einer Weile glaube ich, daß es unsere Kraft ist, alle unsere Kraft, die noch zu stark ist für uns. Es ist wahr, wir kennen sie nicht, aber ist es nicht gerade unser Eigenstes, wovon wir am wenigsten wissen? Manchmal denke ich mir, wie der Himmel entstanden ist und der Tod: dadurch, daß wir unser Kostbarstes von uns fortgerückt haben, weil noch so viel anderes zu tun war vorher und weil es bei uns Beschäftigten nicht in Sicherheit war. Nun sind Zeiten darüber vergangen, und wir haben uns an Geringeres gewöhnt. Wir erkennen unser Eigentum nicht mehr und entsetzen uns vor seiner äußersten Großheit. Kann das nicht sein?","My God, my God, if there are still nights like this ahead of me, at least let me have one of the thoughts I was able to think from time to time. It's not unreasonable what I'm asking; for I know that they came straight out of fear, because my fear was so great. Since I was a boy, they slapped my face and told me I was a coward. That was because I was still badly afraid. But since then I've learned to fear with the real fear that only increases as the force that generates it increases. We have no idea of this power except in our fear. Because it is so completely incomprehensible, so completely against us, that our brain decomposes at the point where we make an effort to think it. And yet, for a while I've felt that it's our power, all our power, that's still too strong for us. It's true we don't know them, but isn't it our very own that we know least about? Sometimes I think to myself how heaven and death came into being: because we moved our most precious things away from us, because there was so much else to do beforehand and because it wasn't safe for us employees. Now times have passed and we have grown accustomed to lesser things. We no longer recognize our property and are horrified at its utter greatness. Can't that be?","My God, my God, if such nights still lie in wait for me, allow me at least one of those thoughts that I have occasionally been able to think. What I am asking is not so unreasonable; for I know that they were born of fear itself, because my fear was so vast. When I was a boy, they hit me in the face and told me I was a coward. That was because I still didn’t know how to be completely afraid. But since then I have learned to be afraid with real fear, which only increases when the energy that engenders it increases. We have no conception of this energy, except in our fear. For it is so utterly inconceivable, so entirely opposed to us, that our brain disintegrates at the point where we force ourselves to think about it. And yet for some time now I have believed that it is our energy, all our energy, which is still too strong for us. It is true that we don’t know it, but aren’t we most ignorant about what is most our own? Sometimes I think about how the sky came to be, and death: because we moved outside ourselves what is most precious to us, since there was still so much else to do first and it wasn’t safe with us in all our busyness. Now much time has passed over this, and we have grown accustomed to smaller things. We no longer recognize what belongs to us and are terrified by its extreme vastness. May this not be so?","My God, my God, if any more such nights still lie before me, at least leave me one of those thoughts I have occasionally been able to think. What I am asking is not so unreasonable; I know, after all, that they were born of very fear, because my fear was so great. When I was a boy, they hit me in the face and told me I was a coward. That was because my fear was still of an unworthy kind. Since then, however, I have learned to be afraid with a genuine fear, which grows only as the force that engenders it grows. Of that force we have no conception, except in our fear. For it is so utterly inconceivable, so entirely opposed to us, that our brain fails us precisely when we strain to think upon it. Nonetheless, for some time now I have believed that that force is ours, it is all our own, and still it is too powerful for us. It is true that we do not know it; but do we not know the least about what is most our own? At times I reflect on how heaven came into being, and death: we put away what was most precious to us, because there was so much that had to be dealt with first, and because it was not safe with us, in our busy lives.

When I was a boy they would slap my face * and say that I was a coward. That was because I was still bad at being afraid. But since them I have learned to be afraid with real fear, which only increases when the power of what has created it increases. We have no conception of this power except via our fear.

Yet nonetheless, I have believed for a while that it is our power, all of our power, which is still too strong for us. It is true that we don’t know it, but is it not precisely what is most properly our own that we know least about? Sometimes I think about how heaven came about, and death: it was as we put ourselves far away from what was most precious to us because there was so much else to do before, and because it was not safe with us when we had so much to do.

"Weltvollendender: wie, was als Regen fällt über die Erde und an die Gewässer, nachlässig niederfällt, zufällig fallend,--unsichtbarer und froh von Gesetz wieder aufstehend aus allem und steigt und schwebt und die Himmel bildet: so erhob sich aus dir der Aufstieg unserer Niederschläge und umwölbte die Welt mit Musik.","Perfecting the world: like what falls as rain over the earth and on the waters, falls carelessly, falling accidentally,--more invisible and glad of the law rising again from everything and rising and floating and forming the heavens: thus rose the ascent of ours from you precipitation and encircled the world with music.","World-consummator: as that which comes down as rain over the earth and upon the waters, falling carelessly, at random,—inevitably rises again, invisible and joyous, out of all things, and ascends and floats and forms the heavens: so our precipitations rose out of you, and vaulted the world with music.","Consummator of the world: just as that which falls as rain upon the earth and the waters, carelessly, as chance would have it, rises once again from all things, even less visible than before, joyous by the law within, and ascends and is suspended and forms the heavens, so too from out of you there came the new arising of all that had fallen in us, and it domed the world with music.","You who have brought the world to perfection: what falls carelessly as rain* over the earth and onto the waters, falling fortuitously—how it arises out of everything again, according to law, more invisible and happy, and rises and floats and forms the heavens: so what has fallen in us has ascended from within you and vaulted the world with music."
"Das Volk, das sich ihn erwünschte, ohne sich einen vorzustellen, machte ihn nur noch freier und unbegrenzter in seinen Möglichkeiten. Aber die Erklärung der Mutter hatte, selbst als bewußter Betrug, noch die Macht, ihn zu verringern; sie hob ihn aus der Fülle seiner Erfindung; sie beschränkte ihn auf ein müdes Nachahmen; sie setzte ihn auf den Einzelnen herab, der er nicht war: sie machte ihn zum Betrüger. Und nun kam, leiser auflösend, diese Marina Mniczek hinzu, die ihn auf ihre Art leugnete, indem sie, wie sich später erwies, nicht an ihn glaubte, sondern an jeden. Ich kann natürlich nicht dafür einstehen, wie weit das alles in jener Geschichte berücksichtigt war. Dies, scheint mir, wäre zu erzählen gewesen.","The people who wanted him without imagining one only made him freer and more unlimited in his possibilities. But the mother's explanation, even as a deliberate fraud, still had the power to lessen it; she lifted him out of the fullness of his invention; she confined him to a weary imitation; she reduced him to the individual he was not: she made him an imposter. And now, more quietly dissolving, came this Marina Mniczek, who in her own way denied him by not believing in him, as it later turned out, but in everyone. Of course, I can't vouch for the extent to which all of that was taken into account in that story. This, it seems to me, should have been told.","The fact that the nation desired him, without imagining anyone in particular, only made him even freer and more unlimited in his possibilities.

Of course I cannot vouch for how much of all this was dealt with in that story. These things, it seems to me, should have been included.","The people that wished him for themselves, without imagining any particular individual, only added to the freedom and boundlessness of the possibilities open to him.

"Der König, so wie er sie hatte sich gebärden sehn, erfand selbst den Freibrief für sie. Er redete sie seine lieben Brüder an; nie war ihm jemand so nahegegangen. Es wurde ihnen wörtlich bewilligt, in ihrer Bedeutung unter den Zeitlichen herumzugehen; denn der König wünschte nichts mehr, als daß sie viele anstecken sollten und hineinreißen in ihre starke Aktion, in der Ordnung war. Was ihn selbst betrifft, so sehnte er sich, von ihnen zu lernen. Trug er nicht, ganz wie sie, die Zeichen und Kleider eines Sinnes an sich?

As for himself, he longed to learn from them. Did he not, like them, bear the signs and clothes of a mind? Watching them, he could believe that this had to be learned: to come and go, to testify and turn away, so that there was no doubt. Tremendous hopes overwhelmed his heart.

Others cried; but he was inwardly filled with shining tears and only pressed his cold hands together so that he could endure it. Occasionally at critical moments, when an actor who had finished speaking suddenly stepped out of his wide gaze, the King lifted his face and was afraid: how long now had He been present: Monseigneur Saint Michael, up there, advanced to the edge of the scaffolding, in his mirror-bright silver armor?","Once he had seen their manner of conducting themselves, the King devised their charter himself.

Immense hopes flooded his heart. Every day he sat in the best seat, his seat, in that restlessly lighted, strangely indefinite hall of the Hospital of the Trinity, sometimes leaping to his feet in excitement and then controlling himself, like a schoolboy. Others wept; but he was filled up with gleaming tears within, and could only press his cold hands together in order to endure it. Occasionally at critical moments, when an actor who had said his piece suddenly walked out of his wide-eyed gaze, the King would uplift his face and would be startled – how long had He already been there, Monseigneur Saint Michel up there near the edge of the platform, in His silver armour that gave back bright reflections?","The King, having seen how they comported themselves, drafted their licence himself. He addressed them as his dear brothers; never had anyone affected him so deeply. They received permission, in so many words, to go about amongst the worldly in character; for the King desired nothing more than for them to infect many others and draw them into their powerful initiative, where order lay. As far as he was himself concerned, he longed to learn from them. Did he not wear, just as they did, the tokens and costume intended to convey a meaning? When he watched them, he could see how it should be possible to learn these things, to come and to go, to speak out and to turn aside so that there was no doubt as to what was meant. His heart was suffused with tremendous hope. He sat every day in the best seat in that fitfully lit and strangely nondescript hall in the Hospital of the Trinity, and jumped up with excitement and took hold of himself again like a schoolboy. Others wept; but inside he was full of shining tears and merely clasped his cold hands together to help him bear what he was seeing. Sometimes, at critical moments, when an actor who had finished his part suddenly stepped outside his wide gaze, he lifted up his head in alarm: how long had He been there for?"
"Die Schulins waren in dieser Beziehung ein bißchen eigen seit dem Brande. In den engen, überheizten Stuben kam jeden Augenblick ein Geruch auf, und dann untersuchte man ihn, und jeder gab seine Meinung ab. Zoë machte sich am Ofen zu tun, sachlich und gewissenhaft, der Graf ging umher und stand ein wenig in jeder Ecke und wartete; ""hier ist es nicht"", sagte er dann. Die Gräfin war aufgestanden und wußte nicht, wo sie suchen sollte. Mein Vater drehte sich langsam um sich selbst, als hätte er den Geruch hinter sich. Die Marchesin, die sofort angenommen hatte, daß es ein garstiger Geruch sei, hielt ihr Taschentuch vor und sah von einem zum andern, ob es vorüber wäre. ""Hier, hier"", rief Wjera von Zeit zu Zeit, als hätte sie ihn. Und um jedes Wort herum war es merkwürdig still.

The Countess had got up and didn't know where to look. My father slowly turned around as if the scent was behind him. The Marchesa, who immediately assumed it was a nasty smell, held out her handkerchief and looked from one to the other to see if it was over.

As for me, I had been busy sniffing along.","The Schulins, in this respect, had grown a little peculiar since the fire.

My father slowly turned around in a circle, as if he had the smell behind him. The Marchesa, who had immediately assumed that it was an offensive smell, held her handkerchief over her mouth and looked from one person to the next to see if it had gone. “Here, here,” Viera called from time to time, as if she had found it.

"Da mußte ich nun zugeben, daß ich keinen Augenblick bei der Sache gewesen sei. ""Ich las nur, damit du mich unterbrichst"", gestand ich und wurde heiß und blätterte zurück nach dem Titel des Buches. Nun wußte ich erst, was es war. ""Warum denn nicht die Antworten?"" fragte ich neugierig.","Now I had to admit that I hadn't paid much attention to it for a moment.

I asked curiously.","I had to admit that I hadn’t been paying the slightest bit of attention to the meaning. “I was just reading so that you’d interrupt me,” I confessed, and grew hot and turned back to the title page.

"Was mich angeht, so dachte ich nicht an Furcht. Ich dachte überhaupt nicht; ich ging. Die hohen Türen gaben so spielend nach vor mir und über mir, die Zimmer, durch die ich kam, hielten sich ruhig.

"Wenn man dann das alles bedacht hatte, immer wieder bis ans Ende, kurz wie es war, so begehrte das Volk einen zu sehen, und es sah einen: ratlos. Aber das Volk freute sich des Anblicks; es begriff, daß dies der König sei: dieser Stille, dieser Geduldige, der nur da war, um es zuzulassen, daß Gott über ihn weg handelte in seiner späten Ungeduld. In diesen aufgeklärten Augenblicken auf dem Balkon seines Hôtels von Saint-Pol ahnte der König vielleicht seinen heimlichen Fortschritt; der Tag von Roosbecke fiel ihm ein, als sein Oheim von Berry ihn an der Hand genommen hatte, um ihn hinzuführen vor seinen ersten fertigen Sieg; da überschaute er in dem merkwürdig langhellen Novembertag die Massen der Genter, so wie sie sich erwürgt hatten mit ihrer eigenen Enge, da man gegen sie angeritten war von allen Seiten. Ineinandergewunden wie ein unge heueres Gehirn, lagen sie da in den Haufen, zu denen sie sich selber zusammengebunden hatten, um dicht zu sein. Die Luft ging einem weg, wenn man da und dort ihre erstickten Gesichter sah; man konnte es nicht lassen, sich vorzustellen, daß sie weit über diesen vor Gedränge noch stehenden Leichen verdrängt worden sei durch den plötzlichen Austritt so vieler verzweifelter Seelen.","When you had thought of all this, again and again to the end, in short, the people wanted to see you, and they saw you: at a loss.

In those enlightened moments on the balcony of his Hôtel de Saint-Pol, the King perhaps suspected his secret progress; he remembered the day of Roosbecke when his uncle von Berry had taken him by the hand to lead him towards his first finished victory; there, on the strangely long November day, he surveyed the masses of the people of Ghent, just as they had strangled themselves with their own narrowness, since they had been ridden against from all sides. Twisted together like a monstrous brain, they lay there in the heaps they had tied themselves together to be tight.

"In demselben Augenblick wandten sich meine Blicke unwillkürlich nach der gewissen Türe, und wirklich: Christine Brahe trat ein. Mein Nachbar, der Major, machte eine heftige, kurze Bewegung, die sich in meinen Körper fortpflanzte, aber er hatte offenbar keine Kraft mehr, sich zu erheben.

"Aber dann waren viele da, die ich nie gesehen hatte; wenige Frauen, aber es waren Kinder da.

"Aber auf einmal (war es die Hitze in den Zimmern oder das viele nahe Licht) überfiel mich zum erstenmal in meinem Leben etwas wie Gespensterfurcht.

"Maman hatte Ingeborgs kleinen Sekretär hinauf in ihr Zimmer stellen lassen, davor fand ich sie oft, denn ich durfte ohne weiteres bei ihr eintreten. Mein Schritt verging völlig in dem Teppich, aber sie fühlte mich und hielt mir eine ihrer Hände über die andere Schulter hin. Diese Hand war ganz ohne Gewicht, und sie küßte sich fast wie das elfenbeinerne Kruzifix, das man mir abends vor dem Einschlafen reichte. An diesem niederen Schreibschrank, der mit einer Platte sich vor ihr aufschlug, saß sie wie an einem Instrument. ""Es ist so viel Sonne drin"", sagte sie, und wirklich, das Innere war merkwürdig hell, von altem, gelbem Lack, auf dem Blumen gemalt waren, immer eine rote und eine blaue. Und wo drei nebeneinanderstanden, gab es eine violette zwischen ihnen, die die beiden anderen trennte. Diese Farben und das Grün des schmalen, waagerechten Rankenwerks waren ebenso verdunkelt in sich, wie der Grund strahlend war, ohne eigentlich klar zu sein. Das ergab ein seltsam gedämpftes Verhältnis von Tönen, die in innerlichen gegenseitigen Beziehungen standen, ohne sich über sie auszusprechen.","Maman had Ingeborg's little desk put upstairs in her room, I often found her in front of it, because I was allowed to go in to her room without further ado. My crotch completely buried itself in the carpet, but she felt me and held out one of her hands over the other shoulder. That hand was completely weightless, and it kissed almost like the ivory crucifix that was handed to me at night before I went to sleep. She sat at this low writing cupboard, which opened up in front of her with a plate, as if at an instrument. ""There's so much sun in there,"" she said, and really, the interior was oddly light, with old yellow paintwork painted with flowers, one red and one blue. And where three stood side by side, there was a purple one between them, separating the other two. These colors and the green of the narrow, horizontal tendrils were just as darkened as the background was radiant, without actually being clear. This resulted in a strangely muted relationship of tones that were internally related to each other without expressing themselves about them.","Maman had had Ingeborg’s little secretary-desk brought up and put into her own room.

This hand was entirely weightless, and kissing it was almost like kissing the ivory crucifix that was held out to me before I went to sleep. At this low desk, with its drop-leaf open in front of her, she would sit as if at a harpsichord. “There is so much sunlight in it,” she said, and indeed the interior was remarkably bright, with its old yellow lacquer, on which flowers were painted, always a red one with a blue one beside it. And where there were three together, a violet flower appeared in the middle, separating the other two. These colors, and the green of the narrow horizontal border of arabesques, were as dim as the background was luminous (though it wasn’t really distinct). This resulted in a strangely muted harmony of tones, which stood in intimate relation to one another, without stating it explicitly.","Maman had had Ingeborg's little secretaire brought upstairs and placed in her room, and I often found her sitting at it, for I had her permission to enter without knocking.

And wherever there were three, a violet-coloured flower appeared between them, keeping the other two apart. These colours, and the green of the slender tendrils that ran in crosswise arabesques, had darkened quite as much as the ground, while not properly lucent, had remained radiant. The result was a curiously muted interplay of hues that stood in intimate relation without actually speaking to each other.","Maman had had Ingeborg’s little secretaire brought up into her room and I often found her sitting at it, since I was allowed to go in without knocking.

"Einer nach dem anderen blickte sich um; jeder meinte den Römer hinter sich zu finden. Aber sie sahen nur den Narren, der herbeigelaufen kam, böse und blutig. Er hielt einen Mantel von sich ab und schüttelte ihn, als sollte etwas herausfallen; aber der Mantel war leer. So ging man daran, nach Kennzeichen zu suchen, und es fanden sich einige. Man hatte ein Feuer gemacht und wusch den Körper mit warmem Wasser und Wein. Die Narbe am Halse kam zum Vorschein und die Stellen der beiden großen Abszesse. Der Arzt zweifelte nicht mehr.

"Aber wahrscheinlich wuchs es zu einem Äußersten an und brach dann mit einem Schlage ab.

"Aber es begann damit, daß ich lachte. Ja ich lachte laut und ich konnte mich nicht beruhigen. Eines Abends fehlte nämlich Mathilde Brahe. Der alte, fast ganz erblindete Bediente hielt, als er zu ihrem Platze kam, dennoch die Schüssel anbietend hin. Eine Weile verharrte er so; dann ging er befriedigt und würdig und als ob alles in Ordnung wäre weiter. Ich hatte diese Szene beobachtet, und sie kam mir, im Augenblick da ich sie sah, durchaus nicht komisch vor. Aber eine Weile später, als ich eben einen Bissen in den Mund steckte, stieg mir das Gelächter mit solcher Schnelligkeit in den Kopf, daß ich mich verschluckte und großen Lärm verursachte. Und trotzdem diese Situation mir selber lästig war, trotzdem ich mich auf alle mögliche Weise anstrengte, ernst zu sein, kam das Lachen stoßweise immer wieder und behielt völlig die Herrschaft über mich.","But it started with me laughing. Yes I laughed out loud and I couldn't calm down. One evening Mathilde Brahe was missing. The old, almost completely blind servant, when he came to her place, held out the bowl anyway. For a while he remained like that; then he went on satisfied and dignified and as if all was well. I had observed this scene and it did not seem at all funny to me the moment I saw it. But a while later, just as I was putting a bite in my mouth, the laughter rose to my head with such rapidity that I choked and made a great deal of noise. And even though this situation bothered me, despite trying in every possible way to be serious, the laughter kept coming in fits and starts and completely controlled me.","But it began with my laughing. I laughed out loud and couldn’t stop. What had happened was that one evening Mathilde Brahe hadn’t appeared for dinner. The old, almost totally blind butler nevertheless held out the serving-dish when he came to her seat. He remained in that attitude for a few moments; then, content and dignified, and as if everything were in order, he moved on. I had watched this scene, and for the moment, as I looked, it didn’t seem at all funny. But a few moments later, just as I was about to swallow a mouthful of food, a fit of laughter rose to my head so quickly that I choked and caused a great commotion. And even though I myself found this situation painful, even though I tried with all my might to be serious, the laughter kept bubbling up in little fits and in the end completely took control of me.","But it all began with my laughing. To be exact, I laughed out loud and could not stop. That evening, Mathilde Brahe did not appear for dinner.

I observed the scene, and at that moment, as I watched, it did not strike me as funny. But a little later, as I had just taken a mouthful of food, the laughter rose so fast within me, to my head, that I swallowed the wrong way and caused a commotion. And although I found the situation embarrassing, although I did everything I could to remain serious, the convulsive laughter kept on returning and had me totally in its power.","But it began with me laughing.

"Zwölf Jahre oder höchstens dreizehn muß ich damals gewesen sein. Mein Vater hatte mich nach Urnekloster mitgenommen. Ich weiß nicht, was ihn veranlaßte, seinen Schwiegervater aufzusuchen. Die beiden Männer hatten sich jahrelang, seit dem Tode meiner Mutter, nicht gesehen, und mein Vater selbst war noch nie in dem alten Schlosse gewesen, in welches der Graf Brahe sich erst spät zurückgezogen hatte. Ich habe das merkwürdige Haus später nie wiedergesehen, das, als mein Großvater starb, in fremde Hände kam. So wie ich es in meiner kindlich gearbeiteten Erinnerung wiederfinde, ist es kein Gebäude; es ist ganz aufgeteilt in mir; da ein Raum, dort ein Raum und hier ein Stück Gang, das diese beiden Räume nicht verbindet, sondern für sich, als Fragment, aufbewahrt ist. In dieser Weise ist alles in mir verstreut,--die Zimmer, die Treppen, die mit so großer Umständlichkeit sich niederließen, und andere enge, rundgebaute Stiegen, in deren Dunkel man ging wie das Blut in den Adern; die Turmzimmer, die hoch aufgehängten Balkone, die unerwarteten Altane, auf die man von einer kleinen Tür hinausgedrängt wurde:--alles das ist noch in mir und wird nie aufhören, in mir zu sein. Es ist, als wäre das Bild dieses Hauses aus unendlicher Höhe in mich hineingestürzt und auf meinem Grunde zerschlagen.","I must have been twelve or at most thirteen then. My father had taken me to Urnekloster. I don't know what prompted him to visit his father-in-law. The two men had not seen each other for years since my mother's death, and my father himself had never been to the old castle, to which Count Brahe had retired late. I never saw the strange house again, which fell into the hands of strangers when my grandfather died. As I find it again in my childishly worked memory, it is not a building; it is all divided within me; here a room, there a room and here a piece of corridor that does not connect these two rooms but is preserved as a fragment. In this way everything in me is scattered—the rooms, the stairways that descended with such great circumstance, and other narrow, round stairways, in the darkness of which one walked like the blood in the veins; the tower rooms, the high balconies, the unexpected balconies onto which one was pushed out by a small door:--all this is still in me and will never cease to be in me. It is as if the image of this house had fallen into me from an infinite height and shattered on my ground.","I must have been twelve then, or at most thirteen. My father had taken me with him to Urnekloster. I don’t know what the occasion was for this visit to his father-in-law; the two men hadn’t seen each other for years, not since my mother’s death, and my father had never been inside the ancient manor-house that Count Brahe had retired to in his old age. I never again saw that remarkable house, which passed into strangers’ hands after my grandfather’s death. As I find it in the memories of my childhood, it isn’t a complete building; it has been broken into pieces inside me; a room here, a room there, and then a piece of a hallway that doesn’t connect these two rooms, but is preserved as a fragment, by itself. In this way, it is all dispersed inside me—the rooms, the staircases that descended so gracefully and ceremoniously, and other narrow, spiral stairs, where you moved through the darkness as blood moves in the veins; the tower rooms, the high, suspended balconies, the unexpected galleries you were thrust onto by a little door—all this is still inside me and will never cease to be there. It is as if the image of this house had fallen into me from an infinite height and shattered upon my ground.","[15] Twelve years old I must have been at the time, or at most thirteen. My father had taken me with him to Urnekloster. I do not know what prompted him to visit his father-in-law.

In later times, I never saw that remarkable house again, for it passed into the possession of strangers after my grandfather's death. In the memories I have of it, shaped as they were by a child's understanding, it is not a building; to my mind, it consists of discrete parts: here a room, there a room, and here a stretch of passageway that does not connect these two rooms but is preserved in isolation, as a fragment. In this way, it is all dispersed within me: the rooms, the staircases that descended with such elaborate ceremony, and other tight, spiral stairs where one passed through the dark as the blood passes through the veins; the rooms in the towers, the balconies hung on high, the unexpected galleries on to which one was thrust by a little door – all of these things are still within me, and will never cease to be in me. It is as though the image of this house had fallen into me from a measureless height and shattered on the bottom-most part of myself.","[15] I must at that time have been twelve years old, or at most thirteen. * My father had taken me with him to Urnekloster. * I don’t know what had prompted him to go to see his father-in-law.

After that visit I didn’t see the remarkable house again, since it passed out of the family when my grandfather died. The way I retrieve it from memories wrought by my child-self, it isn’t a whole building; it has been completely broken up within me—a space here, a space there, over here a piece of corridor, not one that links those two spaces, but retained as a piece on its own, a fragment. Everything is dispersed within me like this—the rooms, the grand flights of stairs that descended with such great intricacy, and other staircases, narrow, round, in whose dark shafts you circulated like the blood in your veins; the turret rooms, the balconies perched high up, the unexpected terraces out onto which you were propelled through small doors: this all still exists within me, and will never cease to exist within me. It is as if the image of this house had collapsed into me, plunging down from an infinite height and shattering on my ground."

"Äther aus einer Türspalte. Ich begann auf und ab zu gehen. Es kam mir in den Sinn, daß man mich hierher gewiesen hatte, unter diese Leute, in diese überfüllte, allgemeine Sprechstunde. Es war sozusagen die erste öffentliche Bestätigung, daß ich zu den Fortgeworfenen gehörte; hatte der Arzt es mir angesehen? Aber ich hatte meinen Besuch in einem leidlich guten Anzuge gemacht, ich hatte meine Karte hineingeschickt. Trotzdem, er mußte es irgendwie erfahren haben, vielleicht hatte ich mich selbst verraten. Nun, da es einmal Tatsache war, fand ich es auch gar nicht so arg; die Leute saßen still und achteten nicht auf mich. Einige hatten Schmerzen und schwenkten ein wenig das eine Bein, um sie leichter auszuhalten. Verschiedene Männer hatten den Kopf in die flachen Hände gelegt, andere schliefen tief mit schweren, verschütteten Gesichtern. Ein dicker Mann mit rotem, angeschwollenem Halse saß vorübergebeugt da, stierte auf den Fußboden und spie von Zeit zu Zeit klatschend auf einen Fleck, der ihm dazu passend schien. Ein Kind schluchzte in einer Ecke; die langen magern Beine hatte es zu sich auf die Bank gezogen, und nun hielt es sie umfaßt und an sich gepreßt, als müßte es von ihnen Abschied nehmen.","Ether from a door crack. I started pacing. It occurred to me that I had been directed here, among these people, to this crowded general surgery. It was, so to speak, the first public confirmation that I was one of those thrown out; did the doctor look at it? But I had made my visit in a tolerably good suit, I had sent in my card. Still, he must have found out somehow, maybe I had betrayed myself. Well, once it was a fact, I didn't think it was so bad; people sat still and ignored me. Some were in pain and waved one leg a little to make it easier to bear. Several men had laid their heads in their hands, others were fast asleep with heavy, smothered faces. A fat man with a red, swollen neck sat bent over, staring at the floor, and from time to time spitting and smacking on whatever spot seemed appropriate to him. A child was sobbing in a corner; she had pulled her long, thin legs towards her on the bench, and now she was holding them tightly and hugging her as if she had to say goodbye to them.","At a certain spot the strong, heightening coolness of ether blew in through a crack in a door. I began to pace back and forth. It occurred to me that I had been directed here, among these people, to this overcrowded, public waiting-room. It was, so to speak, the first official confirmation that I belonged to the category of outcast. Had the doctor known by my appearance? Yet I had gone to his office in a fairly decent suit; I had even sent in my card. In spite of that, he must have somehow discovered it; perhaps I had given myself away. However, now that it was a fact, I didn’t find it so terrible after all. The people were sitting still and paid no attention to me. Some of them were in pain, and moved one leg a bit, to endure it more easily. Several men had leaned their heads against their palms; others were fast asleep, with heavy, fatigue-crushed faces. A fat man with a red, swollen neck sat bent over, staring at the floor. From time to time he spat loudly at a point that he seemed to find suitable for this purpose. A child was sobbing in a corner; it had pulled its long skinny legs in, onto the bench, and was now holding them tightly to its body in an embrace, as if it would soon have to take leave of them forever.","In one place the strong, bracing coolness of ether blew in through a door left ajar.

But I had gone to see him wearing a passable suit, and had sent in my card. Even so, he must have worked it out somehow or other; perhaps I gave myself away. At all events, now that that was how it was, I did not find it so very dreadful; the people were sitting there placidly and took no notice of me. Some of them were in pain, and to make it more bearable were lolling one leg a little. A number of the men had their heads in their hands, while others were fast asleep, their faces heavy, deeply submerged. One fat man with a red, swollen neck was sitting bent forward, staring at the floor, and from time to time he spat out smack at a spot he appeared to find suitable for the purpose.

"Da kamen erst Kanten italienischer Arbeit, zähe Stücke mit ausgezogenen Fäden, in denen sich alles immerzu wiederholte, deutlich wie in einem Bauerngarten. Dann war auf einmal eine ganze Reihe unserer Blicke vergittert mit venezianischer Nadelspitze, als ob wir Klöster wären oder Gefängnisse. Aber es wurde wieder frei, und man sah weit in Gärten hinein, die immer künstlicher wurden, bis es dicht und lau an den Augen war wie in einem Treibhaus: prunkvolle Pflanzen, die wir nicht kannten, schlugen riesige Blätter auf, Ranken griffen nacheinander, als ob ihnen schwindelte, und die großen offenen Blüten der Points d'Alençon trübten alles mit ihren Pollen. Plötzlich, ganz müde und wirr, trat man hinaus in die lange Bahn der Valenciennes, und es war Winter und früh am Tag und Reif. Und man drängte sich durch das verschneite Gebüsch der Binche und kam an Plätze, wo noch keiner gegangen war; die Zweige hingen so merkwürdig abwärts, es konnte wohl ein Grab darunter sein, aber das verbargen wir voreinander. Die Kälte drang immer dichter an uns heran, und schließlich sagte Maman, wenn die kleinen, ganz feinen Klöppelspitzen kamen: ""Öh, jetzt bekommen wir Eisblumen an den Augen"", und so war es auch, denn es war innen sehr warm in uns.","Then came the edges of Italian work, tough pieces with the threads pulled out, in which everything was repeated over and over, clearly as in a cottage garden. Then suddenly a whole row of our eyes was barred with Venetian needlepoint, as if we were monasteries or prisons. But it became free again, and one could see far into gardens, which became more and more artificial, until it was close and tepid to the eyes, as in a hothouse: magnificent plants that we did not know opened up huge leaves, tendrils reached out for each other, as if they were dizzy, and the large open blossoms of the Points d'Alençon clouded everything with their pollen. Suddenly, very tired and confused, you stepped out into the long path of the Valenciennes, and it was winter and early in the day and frost. And you pushed your way through the snowy bushes of the Binche and came to places where no one had gone before; the branches hung down so strangely, there could well be a grave underneath, but we hid that from each other. The cold got closer and closer to us, and finally, when the small, very fine bobbin lace came, Maman said: ""Oh, now we're getting ice flowers on our eyes"", and that's how it was, because we were very warm inside.","First came strips of Italian work, tough pieces with drawn threads, in which everything was repeated over and over, as clearly as in a peasant’s garden. Then, all at once, a whole series of our glances was latticed with Venetian needlepoint, as if we were cloisters or prisons. But the view was freed again, and we saw deep into gardens that became more and more artificial, until everything was as dense and warm to the eyes as in a greenhouse: luxuriant plants, which we didn’t recognize, spread out their enormous leaves, tendrils groped for one another as if they were dizzy, and the large open blossoms of the Points d’Alençon scattered their pollen over everything. Suddenly, tired and dazed, we stepped outside into the long track of the Valenciennes, and it was an early morning in winter, the ground was covered with frost. And we pushed through the snowy thicket of the Binche and came to places where no one had ever been; the branches hung downward so strangely, perhaps there was a grave beneath them, but we hid that from each other. The cold pressed more and more closely upon us, and at last, when the tiny pillow lace came, Maman said, “Oh, now we’ll get frostflowers on our eyes,” and it was true, for inside us it was very warm.","First came strips of Italian work, robust pieces with drawn threads, in which everything was repeated over and again, as obviously as in a peasant's garden.

But presently we could see freely again, far out into gardens that grew more and more artificial, till all was dense and warm to the eyes, as in a hothouse: luxuriant plants unfamiliar to us spread out their immense leaves, tendrils reached for each other as if they were dizzy, and the great open blossoms of points d'Alençon misted everything with their pollen.

And we squeezed through the snowy thicket of Binche30 and arrived at places where no one had been before; the branches hung down so strangely, there might well be a grave beneath them, but this thought we kept from each other. The cold affected us more and more closely, till at length, when we came to the tiny, exquisite pillow lace, Maman said: ‘Oh, now we shall get frost-flowers on our eyes’ – which indeed we did, for we were very warm inside.","First came edgings of Italian work, strong pieces with drawn threads in which all the patterns repeated themselves clearly, like in a country garden. Then all of sudden Venetian needle-lace set up a whole series of lattices in the way of our looking, as if we were convents or prisons.

Suddenly, tired out and woozy, we emerged into the long webs of Valenciennes * and it was winter and early in the day and there was hoarfrost. And we pushed through the snowy shrubbery of the Binche* and reached places where no one had ever been; the twigs hung down so oddly that there might well have been a grave beneath them, but we concealed the thought from each other. The cold pressed us ever more closely and finally, when the tiny extra-fine bobbin laces came Maman said, ‘Oh, now fern frost* is forming on our eyes,’ and so it was, because inside we were very warm."

"Vielleicht. Vielleicht ist das neu, daß wir das überstehen: das Jahr und die Liebe.

"Weiter, rue Saint-Jacques, ein großes Gebäude mit einer Kuppel. Der Plan gab an Val-de-grâce, Hôspital militaire. Das brauchte ich eigentlich nicht zu wissen, aber es schadet nicht.

"Gesprächsstoff war, wenn man genau sein will, überhaupt keiner da; es wurden Reste veräußert zu unglaublichen Preisen, es war eine Liquidation aller Bestände. Dr. Jespersen mußte sich bei uns darauf beschränken, eine Art von Privatmann zu sein; das gerade aber war er nie gewesen. Er war, soweit er denken konnte, im Seelenfach angestellt. Die Seele war eine öffentliche Institution für ihn, die er vertrat, und er brachte es zuwege, niemals außer Dienst zu sein, selbst nicht im Umgang mit seiner Frau, ""seiner bescheidenen, treuen, durch Kindergebären seligwerdenden Rebekka"", wie Lavater sich in einem anderen Fall ausdrückte.","If you want to be precise, there was no topic of conversation at all; leftovers were sold at unbelievable prices, it was a liquidation of all stocks. dr With us, Jespersen had to confine himself to being a kind of private man; but that was precisely what he had never been.

"""Aber es war doch eben ein Haus da"", sagte Maman und konnte sich gar nicht so rasch an Wjera Schulin gewöhnen, die warm und lachend herausgelaufen war.

"Möglichst kurz, s'il vous plaît. Denn viel Zeit hätten die Herren nicht. Mir war seltsam zumut. Die jungen Leute saßen und sahen mich an mit jener überlegenen, fachlichen Neugier, die sie gelernt hatten. Der Arzt, den ich kannte, strich seinen schwarzen Spitzbart und lächelte zerstreut. Ich dachte, daß ich in Weinen ausbrechen würde, aber ich hörte mich französisch sagen: ""Ich hatte bereits die Ehre, Ihnen, mein Herr, alle Auskünfte zu geben, die ich geben kann. Halten Sie es für nötig, daß diese Herren eingeweiht werden, so sind Sie nach unserer Unterredung gewiß imstande, dies mit einigen Worten zu tun, während es mir sehr schwer fällt."" Der Arzt erhob sich mit höflichem Lächeln, trat mit den Assistenten ans Fenster und sagte ein paar Worte, die er mit einer waagerechten, schwankenden Handbewegung begleitete. Nach drei Minuten kam einer von den jungen Leuten, kurzsichtig und fahrig, an den Tisch zurück und sagte, indem er versuchte, mich strenge anzusehen: ""Sie schlafen gut, mein Herr?"" ""Nein, schlecht."" Worauf er wieder zu der Gruppe zurück sprang. Dort verhandelte man noch eine Weile, dann wandte sich der Arzt an mich und teilte mir mit, daß man mich rufen lassen würde. Ich erinnerte ihn, daß ich auf ein Uhr bestellt worden sei. Er lächelte und machte ein paar schnelle, sprunghafte Bewegungen mit seinen kleinen weißen Händen, die bedeuten wollten, daß er ungemein beschäftigt sei. Ich kehrte also in meinen Gang zurück, in dem die Luft viel lastender geworden war, und fing wieder an, hin und her zu gehen, obwohl ich mich todmüde fühlte. Schließlich machte der feuchte, angehäufte Geruch mich schwindlig; ich blieb an der Eingangstür stehen und öffnete sie ein wenig. Ich sah, daß draußen noch Nachmittag und etwas Sonne war, und das tat mir unsagbar wohl.","As short as possible, s'il vous plaît. Because the gentlemen didn't have much time. I felt strange. The young people sat and looked at me with that superior, professional curiosity they had learned. The doctor I knew stroked his black goatee and smiled absently. I thought I was going to cry, but I heard myself saying in French: ""I have already had the honor of giving you, sir, all the information I can. Do you think it necessary for these gentlemen to be in the know , so after our conversation you are certainly able to do this in a few words, while I find it very difficult."" The doctor got up with a polite smile, went to the window with the assistants and said a few words, which he accompanied with a horizontal, swaying hand movement. After three minutes one of the young people, short-sighted and nervous, came back to the table and, trying to look at me sternly, said: ""Are you sleeping well, sir?"" ""No, bad."" Whereupon he jumped back to the group. There they negotiated for a while, then the doctor turned to me and said that I would be summoned. I reminded him that I had been summoned for one o'clock. He smiled and made a few quick, erratic motions with his little white hands that meant he was extremely busy. So I got back into my walk, where the air had become much heavier, and started pacing again, even though I felt dead tired. Eventually the damp, accumulated smell made me dizzy; I stopped at the front door and opened it a little. I saw that it was still afternoon and a bit of sun outside, and that did me inexpressibly good.","As briefly as possible, s’il vous plaît. For the gentlemen did not have much time. I felt very uncomfortable. The young men sat and looked at me with the condescending, professional curiosity that they had learned.

I thought I would burst into tears, but I heard myself say in French: “I have already had the honor, monsieur, of giving you all the information I can give. If you think it is necessary for these gentlemen to be initiated, you are certainly able, from our conversation, to do that in a few words, while I would find it very difficult.” The doctor stood up, with a polite smile, walked to the window, followed by his assistants, and said several words, which he accompanied with a vague, horizontal movement of his hand. Three minutes later, one of the young men, nearsighted and perfunctory, came back to the table and said, trying to look at me severely: “Do you sleep well, monsieur?” “No, badly.” At this, he hurried back to the group at the window. They deliberated for a few more moments, then the doctor turned to me and informed me that I would be called in again. I reminded him that my appointment had been for one o’clock. He smiled and made a few quick, jerky motions with his small white hands, which were meant to indicate that he was extremely busy. So I returned to my corridor, where the air had become much more oppressive, and began to pace back and forth again, though I felt dead-tired. After a while, the stale, musty odor set my head spinning; I stopped at the entrance door and opened it slightly. I saw that it was still afternoon outside, and rather sunny, and this made me feel much better.","As briefly as possible, s'il vous plaît; these gentlemen did not have much time.

If you consider it necessary that these gentlemen be privy to the matter, you will doubtless be in a position, from our conversation, to describe it in a few words, whereas I find it difficult to do so.’ The doctor rose with a courteous smile, crossed to the window with his assistants, and said a few words, waving his hand levelly to and fro for emphasis. Three minutes later, one of the young men, a short-sighted, nervous fellow, came back to the table and, attempting a severe look, said: ‘Do you sleep well, sir?’ ‘ No, badly.’ Whereupon he leaped back to rejoin the others. When the group had deliberated together for a time, the doctor turned to me and informed me that I would be called. I reminded him that my appointment had been for one o'clock. He smiled and rapidly flapped his small white hands a couple of times, to indicate that he was exceptionally busy. So I returned to my passageway, where the air was now far more oppressive, and began to pace to and fro again, although I felt dead tired. At length I grew giddy from the stale, humid odours; I went to stand by the front door and opened it a little. I could see that it was still afternoon and there was sunshine outside, and this made me feel inexpressibly better.","As briefly as possible, s’il vous plaît, because the gentlemen didn’t have much time.

After three minutes one of the young persons came back to the table, peering short-sightedly and looking agitated; trying to look sternly at me, he said, ‘Do you sleep well, sir?’ ‘ No, badly.’ Whereupon he quickly returned to the group. There they parleyed for a while and then the doctor turned to me and informed me that they would have me called. I reminded him that I’d been told to arrive for one o’clock. He smiled and made a few rapid, jerky movements with his small white hands, as if to say that he was uncommonly busy. I went back to my corridor, therefore, in which the air had become a good deal more oppressive, and began to walk up and down once more, even though I felt utterly worn out. At length the damp, stale odours made me feel dizzy; I stood by the entrance and opened the door a little. I could see that outside it was still afternoon and that there was a little sunshine, and that made me feel immeasurably better."

"Nie war er der Antike so gewiß. Fast möchte er der Generationen lächeln, die sie beweint haben wie ein verlorenes Schauspiel, in dem sie gerne aufgetreten wären. Nun begreift er momentan die dynamische Bedeutung jener frühen Welteinheit, die etwas wie ein neues, gleichzeitiges Aufnehmen aller menschlichen Arbeit war. Es beirrt ihn nicht, daß jene konsequente Kultur mit ihren gewissermaßen vollzähligen Versichtbarungen für viele spätere Blicke ein Ganzes zu bilden schien und ein im Ganzen Vergangenes. Zwar ward dort wirklich des Lebens himmlische Hälfte an die halbrunde Schale des Daseins gepaßt, wie zwei volle Hemisphären zu einer heilen, goldenen Kugel zusammengehen. Doch dies war kaum geschehen, so empfanden die in ihr eingeschlossenen Geister diese restlose Verwirklichung nur noch als Gleichnis; das massive Gestirn verlor an Gewicht und stieg auf in den Raum, und in seiner goldenen Rundung spiegelte sich zurückhaltend die Traurigkeit dessen, was noch nicht zu bewältigen war.","He was never so certain of antiquity. He almost wants to smile at the generations who have mourned them like a lost play in which they would have liked to appear. Now he is grasping momentarily the dynamic significance of that early world unity which was something of a new, simultaneous embracing of all human labour. It doesn't bother him that that consistent culture, with its, so to speak, complete invisibility, seemed to form a whole and a whole in the past for many later views. It is true that the heavenly half of life was really fitted there to the semicircular shell of existence, just as two full hemispheres come together to form a whole, golden sphere. But this had hardly happened when the spirits locked in her felt this complete realization only as a parable; the massive star lost weight and rose into space, and in its golden roundness the sadness of what was yet to be mastered was reflected cautiously.","Never has he been so certain of antiquity. He could almost smile at the generations that have mourned it as if it were a lost play that they would have liked to act in. Now he instantaneously grasps the dynamic significance of that early world-unity, which was something like a new and simultaneous gathering-up of all human work. It doesn’t trouble him that that consistent civilization, with its almost totally visualized ideals, seemed to many later onlookers to form a whole and to be wholly past. There, it is true, the celestial half of life really was fitted against the semicircular bowl of earthly existence, the way two full hemispheres connect to form a complete golden ball. Yet hardly had this occurred when the spirits confined inside it felt that this absolute realization was just a parable; the massive star lost weight and rose into space, and its golden sphere hesitantly reflected the sadness of everything that still couldn’t be mastered.","Never before has he felt so sure of ancient times. He could almost smile at those generations that wept for antiquity as for a lost play they would have liked to have parts in. Now he readily grasps the dynamic significance of that early unity that was in the world, that new and simultaneous gathering-in of all that humankind laboured at, as it were. It does not trouble him that that civilization, which was all of a piece and had an almost total capacity to make manifest, has appeared to many in later ages to form a whole and to be wholly past. It is true that there the celestial half of life really was fitted to the semicircular bowl of earthly existence, as two full hemispheres fit together to make one perfect golden orb. But scarcely had this occurred than the spirits confined within it felt that this absolute reality was no more than a likeness; the massive heavenly body grew weightless and rose into space, and its golden sphere hesitantly reflected the sadness of all that could not yet be subdued.","Never has he been so sure of antiquity. He almost smiles at the generations that have mourned it like a lost play in which they would like to have acted. Now in an instant he seizes the dynamic significance of the world’s unity in early times, when it was something like a new, simultaneous absorption of all the labours of humanity. He is not deterred by the consistency of that civilization, where almost every last thing could be made visible, such that it seemed to many looking back later to form a whole, and one wholly in the past. It is true that there earth’s celestial part was genuinely matched to the semicircular bowl of existence, as two hemispheres fit together to make one full golden orb, but hardly had that occurred than the spirits enclosed within it saw such perfect realization as merely metaphorical; that solid celestial body began to lose mass and rose up into space, and its golden curvature mirrored unobtrusively the sadness of what could not yet be mastered."
"Sie saßen stundenlang da und ließen sich gehen, bis es ihnen einfiel, daß sie noch lebten; dann warfen sie sich blindlings irgendwohin und begriffen nicht, was sie dort sollten, und man hörte sie weiterhin niederfallen und drüben und anderswo. Und endlich krochen sie überall und bestarben langsam das ganze Zimmer.","They sat and let themselves go for hours, until it occurred to them that they were alive; then they threw themselves blindly somewhere, not understanding what they were doing there, and they continued to be heard falling, and over there and elsewhere. And finally they crawled everywhere and slowly died the whole room.","They stayed motionless for hours and let themselves be, until it occurred to them that they were still alive; then they flung themselves blindly in every direction and didn’t know what to do when they got there, and I could hear them falling down again in this, that, or the other place. And finally they crawled around everywhere and slowly covered the whole room with their death.","For hours on end they sat there, dead to the world, till they realized they were still alive; then they would fling off blindly in any direction at all, with no notion what they were doing there, and you would hear them falling again, over there, then somewhere else. And at length they would be crawling around all over, their death steadily infecting the whole room.","They would sit there for hours not moving until they suddenly realized that they were still alive; then they flung themselves blindly in whatever direction first occurred to them, without knowing what they were supposed to be doing there, and you could hear them as they kept falling to the ground here, there and everywhere. And they ended up crawling all over the place, slowly tainting the room with their death."
"Hätten wir ein Theater, stündest du dann, du Tragische immer wieder so schmal, so bar, so ohne Gestaltvorwand vor denen, die an deinem ausgestellten Schmerz ihre eilige Neugier vergnügen?

"In den nächsten Tagen wurde Abelone regelmäßig gerufen, und das Diktieren ging nach diesem Zwischenfall viel ruhiger weiter. Der Graf stellte nach allerhand Papieren seine frühesten Erinnerungen an den Bernstorffschen Kreis zusammen, in dem sein Vater eine gewisse Rolle spielte. Abelone war jetzt so gut auf die Besonderheiten ihrer Arbeit eingestellt, daß, wer die beiden sah, ihre zweckdienliche Gemeinsamkeit leicht für ein wirkliches Vertrautsein nehmen konnte.","Over the next few days, Abelone was called regularly, and dictation continued much calmer after this incident.

There it rises, there it surpasses you, comes higher than your breath, on which you flee as to your last place.","And inside you there is hardly any room; and it almost calms you to think that nothing very large can enter this narrowness; that even the tremendous must become an inner thing and shrink to fit its surroundings.

There it rises, transcends you, reaches higher than your breath to whose heights you were fleeing as if to your very last refuge."
"Ich blickte unwillkürlich wieder hin in das schöne, gleichmäßige Gesicht. Und da wußte ich, daß er Sicherheit wollte. Die hatte er im Grunde immer gewünscht.","Involuntarily I looked back at the beautiful, even face. And that's when I knew he wanted security.

Nur ein Schritt, und mein tiefes Elend würde Seligkeit sein. Aber ich kann diesen Schritt nicht tun, ich bin gefallen und kann mich nicht mehr aufheben, weil ich zerbrochen bin. Ich habe ja immer noch geglaubt, es könnte eine Hülfe kommen. Da liegt es vor mir in meiner eigenen Schrift, was ich gebetet habe, Abend für Abend. Ich habe es mir aus den Büchern, in denen ich es fand, abgeschrieben, damit es mir ganz nahe wäre und aus meiner Hand entsprungen wie Eigenes.

"Manchmal sprang er auf und redete in die Kerzen hinein, daß sie flackerten. Oder ganze Sätze mußten wieder durchgestrichen werden, und dann ging er heftig hin und her und wehte mit seinem nilgrünen, seidenen Schlafrock. Während alledem war noch eine Person zugegen, Sten, des Grafen alter, jütländischer Kammerdiener, dessen Aufgabe es war, wenn der Großvater aufsprang, die Hände schnell über die einzelnen losen Blätter zu legen, die, mit Notizen bedeckt, auf dem Tische herumlagen. Seine Gnaden hatten die Vorstellung, daß das heutige Papier nichts tauge, daß es viel zu leicht sei und davonfliege bei der geringsten Gelegenheit. Und Sten, von dem man nur die lange obere Hälfte sah, teilte diesen Verdacht und saß gleichsam auf seinen Händen, lichtblind und ernst wie ein Nachtvogel.","Sometimes he jumped up and talked into the candles so that they flickered.

His Grace had the notion that today's paper was worthless, that it was far too light and would fly away at the slightest opportunity. And Sten, of whom only the long upper half was visible, shared this suspicion and sat as it were on his hands, light-blind and solemn as a night bird.","Sometimes he would jump up and speak into the candles so passionately that they flickered.

"Es ist keine andere Klage je von Frauen geklagt worden: die beiden ersten Briefe Heloïsens enthalten nur sie, und fünfhundert Jahre später erhebt sie sich aus den Briefen der Portugiesin; man erkennt sie wieder wie einen Vogelruf.

"Einigen wir uns darüber: der Deckel einer Büchse, einer gesunden Büchse, deren Rand nicht anders gebogen ist, als sein eigener, so ein Deckel müßte kein anderes Verlangen kennen, als sich auf seiner Büchse zu befinden; dies müßte das äußerste sein, was er sich vorzustellen vermag; eine nicht zu übertreffende Befriedigung, die Erfüllung aller seiner Wünsche. Es ist ja auch etwas geradezu Ideales, geduldig und sanft eingedreht auf der kleinen Gegenwulst gleichmäßig aufzuruhen und die eingreifende Kante in sich zu fühlen, elastisch und gerade so scharf, wie man selber am Rande ist, wenn man einzeln daliegt. Ach, aber wie wenige Deckel giebt es, die das noch zu schätzen wissen. Hier zeigt es sich so recht, wie verwirrend der Umgang mit den Menschen auf die Dinge gewirkt hat. Die Menschen nämlich, wenn es angeht, sie ganz vorübergehend mit solchen Deckeln zu vergleichen, sitzen höchst ungern und schlecht auf ihren Beschäftigungen. Teils weil sie nicht auf die richtigen gekommen sind in der Eile, teils weil man sie schief und zornig aufgesetzt hat, teils weil die Ränder, die aufeinander gehören, verbogen sind, jeder auf eine andere Art. Sagen wir es nur ganz aufrichtig: sie denken im Grunde nur daran, sobald es sich irgend tun läßt, hinunterzuspringen, zu rollen und zu blechern. Wo kämen sonst alle diese sogenannten Zerstreuungen her und der Lärm, den sie verursachen?","Let us agree on this: the lid of a can, a healthy can, whose rim is not curved differently from its own, such a lid should know no other desire than to be on its can; this must be the furthest he can imagine; an unsurpassable satisfaction, the fulfillment of all his desires. It is also something downright ideal to rest patiently and gently on the small counterbulge and to feel the encroaching edge in you, elastic and just as sharp as you are on the edge when you are lying there alone. Ah, but how few lids there are who still appreciate that. Here it really shows how confusing dealing with people has had an effect on things. For people, when it is possible to briefly compare them with such covers, sit extremely reluctantly and badly on their occupations. Partly because they didn't come up with the right ones in the hurry, partly because they were put on crookedly and angrily, partly because the edges that belong together are bent, each in a different way. Let's just be honest: they think basically just about jumping down, rolling and tinny as soon as it can be done. Otherwise, where would all these so-called distractions come from and the noise they make?","Let us agree on one point: the lid of a can—or let us say, of a can that is in good condition, whose edge curves in the same way as its own—a lid like this should have no other wish than to find itself on top of its can; this would be the utmost that it could imagine for itself; an unsurpassable satisfaction, the fulfillment of all its desires. Indeed, there is something almost ideal about being patiently and gently turned and coming to rest evenly on the small projecting rim, and feeling its interlocking edge inside you, elastic and just as sharp as your own edge is when you are lying alone. Ah, but there are hardly any lids now that can still appreciate this. Here it is very evident how much confusion has been caused among Things by their association with humans. For humans—if it is permissible to compare them, just in passing, with tin lids—humans sit upon their occupations ungracefully and with extreme unwillingness. Some because in their haste they haven’t found the right one; some because they have been put on in anger, crooked; some because the corresponding rims have been dented, each in a different way. Let us admit in all sincerity that basically they have just one thought: as soon as they get a chance, to jump down and roll around and clatter. Otherwise, where do all these so-called amusements come from, and the noise they make?","Let us agree on one thing: the lid of a tin – of a sound tin, the rim of which has the same curvature as its own – this lid ought to have no other desire than to be on its tin; that ought to be the uttermost it could want, the ultimate satisfaction, the fulfilment of its every wish. There is something veritably ideal in being turned patiently and gently and resting evenly on the contraposed edge, feeling the grip of the rim, elastic and as sharp as your own rim is when you lie there alone. Ah, but how few lids there are that can still appreciate this. This nicely illustrates the confusion that contact with humankind has occasioned among things. Humankind, if we may very briefly compare them with these lids, fit on to their occupations most reluctantly, and with a bad grace. Partly because in their haste they have not hit upon the right one, partly because they have been put on crooked and in anger, partly because the corresponding rims are curved in different ways. Let's be honest about it: all they essentially think about is to jump down the moment they get the chance, roll and clatter about. Why else would we have all these so-called amusements, and the racket they make?","Let’s agree on this: the lid of a tin, of a sound tin, whose edge is curved no differently from its own, a lid like this could have no other desire than to be sitting on its tin; this must be the limit of what it could imagine; a satisfaction that couldn’t be surpassed, the fulfilment of all its wishes. It almost represents something approaching an ideal, having been twisted patiently and softly into place, to be resting evenly on the little matching protrusion and feeling the interlocking rim within you, elastic and just as sharp as your own edge is when you lie there on your own. But oh, how few lids there are that can still appreciate this! Here it becomes apparent what a confusing effect an association with people has had on things. For human beings—if it’s possible to compare them momentarily with lids of this kind—fit their occupations most poorly and reluctantly. Partly because in their haste they haven’t found the right ones, partly because they’ve been positioned in them badly and angrily, partly because the edges that ought to match are twisted out of true, each in a different way. Let’s be honest about this: at root they’re only thinking about jumping down just as soon they have the chance, of rolling around and making tinny noises. Where else do all these so-called distractions come from, and the noise they cause?"

"Aber die Hand, die ihn tut, ist geübt und fest. Es ist gleich vorbei. Und kaum ist es überstanden, so denkt man nicht mehr an sich; es gilt, den Geburtstag zu retten, die anderen zu beobachten, ihren Fehlern zuvorzukommen, sie in ihrer Einbildung zu bestärken, daß sie alles trefflich bewältigen.

"Später versicherte Nikolaj Kusmitsch immer, daß er an jenem Sonntag Abend, obwohl er sich begreiflicherweise in recht gedrückter Stimmung befand, nichts getrunken habe. Er war also völlig nüchtern, als das Folgende passierte, soweit man überhaupt sagen kann, was da geschah. Vielleicht, daß er ein bißchen in seiner Ecke eingeschlummert war, das ließe sich immerhin denken. Dieser kleine Schlaf verschaffte ihm zunächst lauter Erleichterung. Ich habe mich mit den Zahlen eingelassen, redete er sich zu. Nun, ich verstehe nichts von Zahlen. Aber es ist klar, daß man ihnen keine zu große Bedeutung einräumen darf; sie sind doch sozusagen nur eine Einrichtung von Staats wegen, um der Ordnung willen. Niemand hatte doch je anderswo als auf dem Papier eine gesehen. Es war ausgeschlossen, daß einem zum Beispiel in einer Gesellschaft eine Sieben oder eine Fünfundzwanzig begegnete. Da gab es die einfach nicht. Und dann war da diese kleine Verwechslung vorgefallen, aus purer Zerstreutheit: Zeit und Geld, als ob sich das nicht auseinanderhalten ließe. Nikolaj Kusmitsch lachte beinah. Es war doch gut, wenn man sich so auf die Schliche kam, und rechtzeitig, das war das Wichtige, rechtzeitig. Nun sollte es anders werden. Die Zeit, ja, das war eine peinliche Sache. Aber betraf es etwa ihn allein, ging sie nicht auch den andern so, wie er es herausgefunden hatte, in Sekunden, auch wenn sie es nicht wußten?","Later, Nikolai Kuzmich would always assure us that he hadn't drunk anything that Sunday evening, although he was understandably in a rather depressed mood. So he was totally sober when what happened next happened, as far as anyone can tell what happened. Maybe he fell asleep in his corner, that's at least conceivable. At first, this little sleep gave him a great deal of relief. I got involved with the numbers, he told himself. Well, I don't understand numbers. But it is clear that they must not be given too much importance; they are, so to speak, only an institution by the state, for the sake of order. No one had ever seen one anywhere but on paper. It was out of the question, for example, to meet a seven or a twenty-five in a party. It just didn't exist there. And then there was this little mix-up, out of sheer distraction: time and money, as if the two couldn't be told apart. Nikolai Kuzmich almost laughed. It was good when you found out like that, and in time, that was the important thing, in time. Now it should be different. The time, yes, that was an embarrassing thing. But if it concerned him alone, didn't it affect the others as well, as he had found out, in seconds, even if they didn't know it?","Later, Nikolai Kuzmitch always used to give his word of honor that, although he was understandably in a very depressed mood that Sunday evening, he hadn’t had a thing to drink. He was therefore perfectly sober when the following incident occurred, as far as one can tell what actually happened. Perhaps he had dozed off for a few minutes in the corner of the sofa; he might easily have done that. At first this little nap gave him the greatest relief. I have been meddling with numbers, he said to himself. All right, I don’t understand the first thing about numbers. But it’s obvious that they shouldn’t be granted too much importance; they are, after all, just a kind of arrangement created by the government for the sake of public order. No one had ever seen them anywhere but on paper. It was impossible, for instance, to meet a Seven or a Twenty-five at a party. There simply weren’t any there. And so this slight confusion had taken place, out of pure absent-mindedness: time and money, as if there were no difference between the two. Nikolai Kuzmitch almost laughed. It was really wonderful to have found the mistake, and in good time, that was the important thing, in good time. Now it would be different. Time was certainly a great embarrassment. But was he the only one this had happened to? Didn’t time pass for other people, just as he had discovered, in seconds, even if they weren’t aware of it?","Later, Nikolai Kuzmich would always insist that on that Sunday evening, though he was understandably quite dejected, he hadn't had a drop to drink.

At first, this little snooze brought him a great sense of relief. I have been messing about with numbers, he admonished himself. Now, I don't know a thing about numbers. But it is obvious that one shouldn't attach too much importance to them; after all, they are only an arrangement made by the state in the interests of public order. No one has ever seen them anywhere but on paper. You couldn't possibly meet a seven, say, or a twenty-five, at a social gathering. They simply weren't there. And then there was this little confusion, occasioned by mere inadvertence, between time and money – as if the two could not be distinguished from each other! Nikolai Kuzmich very nearly laughed. It was definitely a good thing to have figured out what he himself was up to, and in good time, that was the important thing, in good time. Now things would be different. Time, there was no denying, was a delicate matter. But was he the only one affected? Did it not pass for others too, as he had worked out, in seconds, even if they were unaware of it?","Later Nikolai Kusmitch would always maintain that on that Sun-day evening, even though he was understandably in a pretty gloomy mood, he had not had anything to drink.

Perhaps he had dozed off a little in the corner, that’s certainly conceivable. That little nap afforded him pure relief at first. I’ve been getting mixed up in numbers, he said to himself.

It was good to get wise to oneself like that, and just in time, that was the most important thing, just in time. Now it would be different. Time—yes, that was embarrassing. But was it only him?

"Was so ein kleiner Mond alles vermag. Da sind Tage, wo alles um einen licht ist, leicht, kaum angegeben in der hellen Luft und doch deutlich.

There's no telling what a light-green carriage on the Pont-Neuf might be, or some red that can't be kept, or even just a poster on the fire wall of a group of pearl-grey houses. Everything is simplified, reduced to a few correct, clear plans, like the face in a Manetian portrait.","How much a small moon can do. There are days when everything around you is luminous, scarcely intimated in the bright air, and yet quite distinct. The foreground takes on the colors of distance, is remote and merely shown from far away, not given to you. And everything related to expanse—the river, the bridges, the long streets, and the extravagant squares—has taken that expanse behind it, is painted on it as if on silk. It is impossible to say what a bright-green carriage on the Pont-Neuf can then become, or a red so vivid that it can’t be held back, or even a simple poster on the division wall of a pearl-gray group of houses. Everything is simplified, brought onto a few correct, clear planes, like the face in a Manet portrait.","[12] What such a small moon can achieve. There are days when everything about one is luminous, light, scarcely defined in the bright air, and nonetheless distinct. Even the nearest of things have the shades of distance upon them; they are remote, merely sketched in rather than bodied forth; and all things that do indeed partake of distance – the river, the bridges, the long streets and the prodigal squares – have absorbed the distance within themselves and are painted on to it as upon silk. Who can say what a light green vehicle on the Pont Neuf might be at such times, or some red bursting forth, or even a mere poster on the fire wall of a pearly-grey group of buildings. Everything is simplified, rendered into a few exact, bright planes like the face in a portrait by Manet.","[12] Look what a little moon like that can achieve! * There are days when everything about one is light, luminous, scarcely identifiable in the bright air but distinct nonetheless. Even the nearest things have tones of distance about them, are abstracted and only shown to us, not handed over; anything with a connection to distance—the river, the bridges, the long streets, and the squares that squander themselves—has taken that distance and set it behind itself, is painted on it as if on silk. One can’t express then what a light-green carriage on the Pont Neuf* might be, or a red of some kind that can’t be held back, or even merely a poster on the fire-wall of a pearl-grey block of houses. Everything is simplified, reduced to a few bright, correctly judged planes like the face in a portrait by Manet. *"

"Mehrere Jahre später erst hörte ich wieder von dem Grafen Christian reden. Es war auf Urnekloster, und Mathilde Brahe war es, die mit Vorliebe von ihm sprach. Ich bin indessen sicher, daß sie die einzelnen Episoden ziemlich eigenmächtig ausgestaltete, denn das Leben meines Onkels, von dem immer nur Gerüchte in die Öffentlichkeit und selbst in die Familie drangen, Gerüchte, die er nie widerlegte, war geradezu grenzenlos auslegbar. Urnekloster ist jetzt in seinem Besitz. Aber niemand weiß, ob er es bewohnt. Vielleicht reist er immer noch, wie es seine Gewohnheit war; vielleicht ist die Nachricht seines Todes aus irgendeinem äußersten Erdteil unterwegs, von der Hand des fremden Dieners geschrieben in schlechtem Englisch oder in irgendeiner unbekannten Sprache.","Only several years later did I hear about Count Christian again. It was in Urnekloster, and it was Mathilde Brahe who liked to talk about him.

Urnekloster is now in his possession. But no one knows if he lives there. Perhaps he still travels, as was his habit; perhaps the news of his death is on its way from some farthest continent, written by the foreign servant's hand in bad English, or in some unknown language.","Not until several years later did I hear further mention of Count Christian. That was at Urnekloster; and it was Mathilde Brahe who liked to talk about him. I am sure, though, that she elaborated upon the various episodes of his career in a rather arbitrary way; for my uncle’s life, which the public and even our family knew about only through rumors that he never took the trouble to contradict, offered infinite possibilities for embellishment. Urnekloster belongs to him now. But no one knows whether he is actually living there. Perhaps he is still traveling, as he used to; perhaps the news of his death is on its way from some remote continent, written by his foreign servant in bad English or in some unknown language.","[34] It was several years before I again heard any mention of Count Christian.

If I come to think about it, I am sure that she took some liberty in elaborating the individual episodes, for the life of my uncle, of which only rumours were known to the public or indeed to the family, rumours that he never denied, afforded infinite possibilities for embellishment. Urnekloster is now in his possession. But no one knows whether he lives there. Perhaps he is still on his travels, according to his custom; perhaps news of his death is on its way from some remote part of the world, written by the foreign servant in poor English or some unfamiliar language.","[34] It wasn’t until several years later that Count Christian became the subject of conversation again. It was at Urnekloster, and Mathilde Brahe was the one speaking fondly of him. I’m certain meanwhile that she was taking the liberty of embellishing the individual episodes somewhat, since the life of my uncle—about which only rumours reached the public, and indeed the family itself, rumours that he never denied—was susceptible of almost limitless elaboration. Urnekloster is now in his possession. But no one knows whether he is living there or not. Perhaps he is still travelling, as used to be his custom; perhaps the news of his death is on its way to us from some far-flung corner of the world, written in the hand of the strange servant in bad English or some unknown tongue."

That was always in one of those incidental rooms that left me in the lurch as soon as I felt bad, as if they feared being interrogated and implicated in my foul affairs. I sat there, and I probably looked so awful that nothing had the nerve to declare its solidarity with me. Not even the lamp wanted to know me, even though I had just done it the favour of lighting it. It burned away to itself, as if in an empty room."

The dark passion of despair had him in its grip, and for weeks he had been living in a tent deep in the forest of Argilly, declaring that his one relief was to hear the stags belling in the night.","However, it was in the nature of the events of that period that they could not be retold so as to spare the reader. When something occurred, it occurred with its full weight, and when it was recounted it was all of a piece. What could mitigate the fact that his brother had been murdered,* or that yesterday Valentina Visconti,* whom he had always called his dear sister, had knelt before him and lifted her widow’s weeds to reveal the lament and accusation that disfigured her face? And today a tenacious, eloquent lawyer* stood there proving how the princely murderer was in the right and talked for so long that the crime became not dark but translucent, as if to send light up to the heavens. And being just meant letting everyone be in the right, for Valentina d’Orléans died of grief even though she had been promised revenge. And what use was it to forgive the Burgundian Duke and keep on forgiving him; he had been enveloped by the dark rutting heat of despair so that for weeks he had been living in a tent in the deep valley of Argilly and said that he could only find relief in the sound of the stags belling at night."
"Dann war der Ausdruck dieser Hände so unerbittlich und streng, daß ich alle Hoffnung in seinen Willen setzte, der groß sein mußte. Aber was war da ein Wille. Der Augenblick mußte kommen, da seine Kraft zu Ende war, er konnte nicht weit sein. Und ich, der ich hinter ihm herging mit stark schlagendem Herzen, ich legte mein bißchen Kraft zusammen wie Geld, und indem ich auf seine Hände sah, bat ich ihn, er möchte nehmen, wenn er es brauchte.","Then the expression of those hands was so relentless and stern that I put all hope in his will, which must be great. But what was a will? The moment had to come when his strength was at an end, it couldn't be far off. And I, walking behind him with my heart beating hard, I put my little strength together like money, and looking at his hands I begged him to take it if he needed it.","The expression of his hands became so severe and relentless then that I placed all my hope in his willpower, which was bound to be strong. But what could mere willpower do? The moment had to come when his strength would be exhausted; it couldn’t be long now. And I, who followed him with my heart pounding, I gathered my little strength together like money and, gazing at his hands, I begged him to take it if it could be of any use.","At those times, the expression of his hands was so severe and relentless that I placed all my hope in his will, which must be a mighty one. But what could the mere will do? The moment must inevitably come when his strength would be exhausted; it could not be long now. And I, following him with my heart pounding, I gathered what little strength I had, like cash, and, looking at his hands, begged him to take it if he had any need for it.","Then the way those hands looked was so grim and tight that I put all my hopes in his will, which must have been massive. But what could a will do in that case? The moment would have to come when his strength was at an end, and it couldn’t be far off. And I, walking behind him, my heart beating heavily, I pooled together all my slight reserve of strength, as one pools money and, looking at his hands, offered it to him so that he should take it if he needed it."

Es wundert mich manchmal, wie bereit ich alles Erwartete aufgebe für das Wirkliche, selbst wenn es arg ist.","Just don't think that I'm suffering from disappointments here, on the contrary. It sometimes amazes me how willingly I give up everything I expect for the real, even if it's bad.","But don’t think I am suffering from disenchantment here—on the contrary.

"Es giebt ein Wesen, das vollkommen unschädlich ist, wenn es dir in die Augen kommt, du merkst es kaum und hast es gleich wieder vergessen. Sobald es dir aber unsichtbar auf irgendeine Weise ins Gehör gerät, so entwickelt es sich dort, es kriecht gleichsam aus, und man hat Fälle gesehen, wo es bis ins Gehirn vordrang und in diesem Organ verheerend gedieh, ähnlich den Pneumokokken des Hundes, die durch die Nase eindringen.","There is a being that is completely harmless when you see it, you hardly notice it and then forget it again.

"Das kommt, glaube ich, weil sie müde sind. Sie haben Jahrhunderte lang die ganze Liebe geleistet, sie haben immer den vollen Dialog gespielt, beide Teile. Denn der Mann hat nur nachgesprochen und schlecht. Und hat ihnen das Erlernen schwer gemacht mit seiner Zerstreutheit, mit seiner Nachlässigkeit, mit seiner Eifersucht, die auch eine Art Nachlässigkeit war.","I think that's because they're tired. They've done all the love for centuries, they've always played the full dialogue, both parts. Because the man just repeated it and badly. And made learning difficult for them with his absent-mindedness, his carelessness, his jealousy, which was also a kind of carelessness.","That comes, I think, from their tiredness. Over the centuries they have taken upon themselves the entire task of love; they have always played the whole dialogue—both parts. For man has only repeated their words, and done it badly. And has made their learning difficult with his distractedness, his negligence, his jealousy, which was itself a kind of negligence.","It comes, I believe, of their weariness. For centuries they have performed all of love; they have always played the entire dialogue, both parts. For man merely repeated what they said, and did it badly.

"Mit jeder Zeile brach man die Welt an. Von den Büchern war sie heil und vielleicht wieder ganz dahinter. Wie aber sollte ich, der nicht lesen konnte, es mit allen aufnehmen? Da standen sie, selbst in diesem bescheidenen Bücherzimmer, in so aussichtsloser Überzahl und hielten zusammen. Ich stürzte mich trotzig und verzweifelt von Buch zu Buch und schlug mich durch die Seiten durch wie einer, der etwas Unverhältnismäßiges zu leisten hat. Damals las ich Schiller und Baggesen, Öhlenschläger und Schack-Staffeldt, was von Walter Scott da war und Calderon.

At that time I read Schiller and Baggesen, Oehlenschläger and Schack-Staffeldt, whatever I could find of Walter Scott and Calderón.

"Es war so gut wie nichts zu tun. Ich ging in der Stadt umher und konstatierte, daß sie sich verändert hatte. Es war mir angenehm, aus dem Hotel hinauszutreten, in dem ich abgestiegen war, und zu sehen, daß es nun eine Stadt für Erwachsene war, die sich für einen zusammennahm, fast wie für einen Fremden. Ein bißchen klein war alles geworden, und ich promenierte die Langelinie hinaus bis an den Leuchtturm und wieder zurück. Wenn ich in die Gegend der Amaliengade kam, so konnte es freilich geschehen, daß von irgendwo etwas ausging, was man jahrelang anerkannt hatte und was seine Macht noch einmal versuchte. Es gab da gewisse Eckfenster oder Torbogen oder Laternen, die viel von einem wußten und damit drohten. Ich sah ihnen ins Gesicht und ließ sie fühlen, daß ich im Hotel 'Phönix' wohnte und jeden Augenblick wieder reisen konnte. Aber mein Gewissen war nicht ruhig dabei. Der Verdacht stieg in mir auf, daß noch keiner dieser Einflüsse und Zusammenhänge wirklich bewältigt worden war. Man hatte sie eines Tages heimlich verlassen, unfertig wie sie waren.

Of course, when I came to the Amaliengade area, something might emanate from somewhere that had been recognized for years and that would try its power again.

I looked them in the face so that they knew I was staying at the Phoenix Hotel and might be leaving at any moment. But I did so with an uneasy conscience.

"Graf Brahe hielt es für eine besondere Artigkeit meinem Vater gegenüber, von dessen verstorbener Gemahlin, meiner Mutter, zu sprechen. Er nannte sie Gräfin Sibylle, und alle seine Sätze schlossen, als fragte er nach ihr. Ja es kam mir, ich weiß nicht weshalb, vor, als handle es sich um ein ganz junges Mädchen in Weiß, das jeden Augenblick bei uns eintreten könne. In demselben Tone hörte ich ihn auch von 'unserer kleinen Anna Sophie' reden. Und als ich eines Tages nach diesem Fräulein fragte, das dem Großvater besonders lieb zu sein schien, erfuhr ich, daß er des Großkanzlers Conrad Reventlow Tochter meinte, weiland Friedrichs des Vierten Gemahlin zur linken Hand, die seit nahezu anderthalb hundert Jahren zu Roskilde ruhte. Die Zeitfolgen spielten durchaus keine Rolle für ihn, der Tod war ein kleiner Zwischenfall, den er vollkommen ignorierte, Personen, die er einmal in seine Erinnerung aufgenommen hatte, existierten, und daran konnte ihr Absterben nicht das geringste ändern. Mehrere Jahre später, nach dem Tode des alten Herrn, erzählte man sich, wie er auch das Zukünftige mit demselben Eigensinn als gegenwärtig empfand. Er soll einmal einer gewissen jungen Frau von ihren Söhnen gesprochen haben, von den Reisen eines dieser Söhne insbesondere, während die junge Dame, eben im dritten Monate ihrer ersten Schwangerschaft, fast besinnungslos vor Entsetzen und Furcht neben dem unablässig redenden Alten saß.","Count Brahe considered it particularly civil to my father to speak of his deceased wife, my mother. He called her Countess Sibylle, and all his sentences ended as if he were asking about her. Yes, it seemed to me, I don't know why, that it was a very young girl in white who could come in at any moment. I heard him speak of ""our little Anna Sophie"" in the same tone. And when I asked one day about this young lady, who seemed to be particularly dear to the grandfather, I learned that he meant the daughter of the Grand Chancellor Conrad Reventlow, then the wife of Frederick the Fourth on the left hand, who had been at Roskilde for almost a hundred and a half years. The chronology didn't matter to him at all, death was a minor incident he completely ignored, people he had once absorbed in his memory existed and their dying couldn't change that in the least. Several years later, after the old gentleman's death, it was said how he felt the future to be present with the same stubbornness. He is said to have once spoken to a certain young woman about her sons, in particular about the travels of one of these sons, while the young lady, just three months pregnant with her first child, was sitting next to the incessantly talking old man, almost unconscious with horror and fear.","Count Brahe believed he was doing my father a particular courtesy by speaking to him of his deceased wife, my mother. He called her Countess Sybille, and all his sentences ended as if he were inquiring about her health. Indeed, it appeared to me, I don’t know why, as if he were talking about a very young girl in white, who might enter the room at any moment. I heard him speak in the same tone about “our little Anna Sophie.” And one day, when I asked who this young lady was, whom Grandfather seemed so particularly fond of, I was told that he was referring to the daughter of High Chancellor Conrad Reventlow: the second, morganatic wife of Frederick IV, who had been reposing in one of the tombs at Roskilde for nearly a century and a half. The passing of time had absolutely no meaning for him; death was a minor incident which he completely ignored; people whom he had once installed in his memory continued to exist, and the fact that they had died did not alter that in the least. Several years later, after the old gentleman’s death, I heard stories about how, with the same obstinacy, he experienced future events as present. It was said that on one occasion he had spoken to a recently married young woman about her sons, in particular about the travels of one of them, while the young woman, who was in the third month of her first pregnancy, sat almost fainting from bewilderment and horror as the old man talked on and on.","Count Brahe intended a particular courtesy towards my father in talking of his late wife, my mother. He called her Countess Sibylle, and whenever he finished a sentence it was as if he were enquiring after her. Indeed, for some unaccountable reason I felt he was referring to some very young girl dressed in white who might enter the room at any moment. I heard him speak in the same tone of ‘our little Anna Sophie’. And one day, when I asked about this young lady of whom Grandfather seemed so especially fond, I found that he was talking of the daughter of High Chancellor Conrad Reventlow, the second, morganatic wife of Frederick IV, who had been reposing at Roskilde for almost a hundred and fifty years.4 The passage of time was wholly immaterial to him, death was a minor incident which he completely ignored, and people whom he had once lodged in his memory continued to exist, regardless of whether they had passed away. Some years later, after the old gentleman had died, he was described as having perceived the future as present too, with the selfsame wilfulness. On one occasion, he reportedly spoke to one young woman of her sons, and in particular the travels of one of these sons, while all the time the young woman, then in the third month of her first pregnancy, sat there almost fainting with fright and dismay as the old man talked relentlessly on.","Count Brahe considered it a particular courtesy towards my father to speak about his late wife, my mother.

I heard him talk in the same tone of voice about ‘our little Anna Sophie’. * And when one day I asked about this young woman of whom my grandfather seemed so fond, I learned that he meant the daughter of Lord High Chancellor Conrad Reventlow,* quondam morganatic spouse of Frederick IV, who had been resting in Roskilde* for nigh-on a century and a half. The passage of time had absolutely no significance for him, death was a minor incident that he disregarded entirely, people he had once absorbed into his memory continued to exist and their deaths made not the slightest difference. Several years later, after the old man’s own death, people talked of how he showed the same obstinacy in experiencing the future as the present. Once he is said to have spoken to a certain young woman about her sons, and in particular about the travels of one of these sons, while the young lady, who was at the time only in the third month of her first pregnancy, sat beside the ceaselessly talking old gentleman almost beside herself with consternation and fear."
"In diesen Jahren gingen in ihm die großen Veränderungen vor. Er vergaß Gott beinah über der harten Arbeit, sich ihm zu nähern, und alles, was er mit der Zeit vielleicht bei ihm zu erreichen hoffte, war ""sa patience de supporter une âme"". Die Zufälle des Schicksals, auf die die Menschen halten, waren schon längst von ihm abgefallen, aber nun verlor, selbst was an Lust und Schmerz notwendig war, den gewürzhaften Beigeschmack und wurde rein und nahrhaft für ihn. Aus den Wurzeln seines Seins entwickelte sich die feste, überwinternde Pflanze einer fruchtbaren Freudigkeit. Er ging ganz darin auf, zu bewältigen, was sein Binnenleben ausmachte, er wollte nichts überspringen, denn er zweifelte nicht, daß in alledem seine Liebe war und zunahm. Ja, seine innere Fassung ging so weit, daß er beschloß, das Wichtigste von dem, was er früher nicht hatte leisten können, was einfach nur durchwartet worden war, nachzuholen. Er dachte vor allem an die Kindheit, sie kam ihm, je ruhiger er sich besann, desto ungetaner vor; alle ihre Erinnerungen hatten das Vage von Ahnungen an sich, und daß sie als vergangen galten, machte sie nahezu zukünftig. Dies alles noch einmal und nun wirklich auf sich zu nehmen, war der Grund, weshalb der Entfremdete heimkehrte. Wir wissen nicht, ob er blieb; wir wissen nur, daß er wiederkam.","Great changes took place in him during these years. He almost forgot God in the hard work of approaching him, and all he hoped to get from him in time was ""sa patience de supporter une âme"". The coincidences of fate that men hold on to had long since fallen away from him, but now even what was necessary of pleasure and pain lost the tang of spice and became pure and nourishing to him. From the roots of his being grew the firm, wintering plant of a fertile joy. He was completely absorbed in coping with what made up his inner life, he didn't want to skip anything, because he had no doubt that in all of this his love was and was growing. Yes, his inner composure was so high that he decided to catch up on the most important thing that he had previously been unable to do, which had simply been waited on. Above all he thought of his childhood; the calmer he thought about it, the more undone it seemed to him; all her memories had the vagueness of premonitions about them, and passing them off made them almost future. Taking it all on again and actually taking it upon himself was the reason why the estranged came home. We don't know if he stayed; we only know that he came back.","During those years the great transformations were taking place inside him.

Through the hard work of approaching God , he well nigh forgot Him, and all that he hoped to achieve from Him, in time, was ‘sa patience de supporter une âme’.76 The accidents of fate, which humankind sets such store by, had long since fallen away from him, but now even the essentials of pleasure and pain lost their spicy savour, and he found them pure and nourishing.

We do not know whether he stayed; we know only that he returned.","Major changes took place within him during those years.

"Ich war aber noch nicht nahe genug, da schob sich von der andern Seite eine Strömung zu ihr hin; unsere gästeglückliche Gräfin selbst, in ihrer warmen, begeisterten Zerstreutheit, stürzte sich mit einer Menge Beistand über sie, um sie auf der Stelle zum Singen abzuführen. Ich war sicher, daß das junge Mädchen sich damit entschuldigen würde, daß niemand in der Gesellschaft Interesse haben könne, dänisch singen zu hören. Dies tat sie auch, sowie sie zu Worte kam.

"Auf der Place St-Michel waren viele Fahrzeuge und hin und her eilende Leute, wir waren oft zwischen zwei Wagen und dann holte er Atem und ließ sich ein wenig gehen, wie um auszuruhen, und ein wenig hüpfte es und nickte ein wenig. Vielleicht war das die List, mit der die gefangene Krankheit ihn überwinden wollte. Der Wille war an zwei Stellen durchbrochen, und das Nachgeben hatte in den besessenen Muskeln einen leisen, lockenden Reiz zurückgelassen und den zwingenden Zweitakt. Aber der Stock war noch an seinem Platz, und die Hände sahen böse und zornig aus; so betraten wir die Brücke, und es ging. Es ging. Nun kam etwas Unsicheres in den Gang, nun lief er zwei Schritte, und nun stand er. Stand. Die linke Hand löste sich leise vom Stock ab und hob sich so langsam empor, daß ich sie vor der Luft zittern sah; er schob den Hut ein wenig zurück und strich sich über die Stirn. Er wandte ein wenig den Kopf, und sein Blick schwankte über Himmel, Häuser und Wasser hin, ohne zu fassen, und dann gab er nach. Der Stock war fort, er spannte die Arme aus, als ob er auffliegen wollte, und es brach aus ihm aus wie eine Naturkraft und bog ihn vor und riß ihn zurück und ließ ihn nicken und neigen und schleuderte Tanzkraft aus ihm heraus unter die Menge.

Standing. The left hand slipped quietly from the stick and rose so slowly that I saw it tremble with the air; he pushed his hat back a little and stroked his forehead.

His willpower had cracked in two places, and the damage had left in his possessed muscles a gentle, alluring stimulation and this compelling two-beat rhythm.

The stick went, he stretched his arms out as if about to take wing, and it broke out from within him like a force of nature and bent him forwards and ripped him backwards and made him nod and tilt and hurled a dancer’s energy out of him and into the crowd. For there were already lots of people gathered round him, and I couldn’t see him any more."
"Manchmal folge ich einer zwei Gassen weit. Sie gehen an den Häusern hin, fortwährend kommen Menschen, die sie verdecken, sie schwinden hinter ihnen weiter wie nichts.","Sometimes I follow one for two streets. They go to the houses, people keep coming to cover them up, they disappear behind them like nothing.",Sometimes I follow one of them for a couple of blocks. They walk along past the houses; people keep coming who hide them from view; they vanish behind them and are nothing.,"At times I follow one down a couple of streets. They walk on past the houses, people continually screen them from my view, and they disappear beyond them as if they were merely nothing.","Sometimes I follow one of them for a couple of streets.

"So unwahrscheinlich es ist, es war mir irgendwie gelungen, gegen Abend allein aus dem Haus zu kommen; ich lief, ich bog um eine Ecke, und in demselben Augenblick stieß ich gegen ihn. Ich begreife nicht, wie das, was jetzt geschah, sich in etwa fünf Sekunden abspielen konnte. So dicht man es auch erzählt, es dauert viel länger. Ich hatte mir weh getan im Anlauf an ihn; ich war klein, es schien mir schon viel, daß ich nicht weinte, auch erwartete ich unwillkürlich, getröstet zu sein. Da er das nicht tat, hielt ich ihn für verlegen; es fiel ihm, vermutete ich, der richtige Scherz nicht ein, in dem diese Sache aufzulösen war. Ich war schon vergnügt genug, ihm dabei zu helfen, aber dazu war es nötig, ihm ins Gesicht zu sehen. Ich habe gesagt, daß er groß war. Nun hatte er sich nicht, wie es doch natürlich gewesen wäre, über mich gebeugt, so daß er sich in einer Höhe befand, auf die ich nicht vorbereitet war. Immer noch war vor mir nichts als der Geruch und die eigentümliche Härte seines Anzugs, die ich gefühlt hatte. Plötzlich kam sein Gesicht. Wie es war? Ich weiß es nicht, ich will es nicht wissen. Es war das Gesicht eines Feindes. Und neben diesem Gesicht, dicht nebenan, in der Höhe der schrecklichen Augen, stand, wie ein zweiter Kopf, seine Faust. Ehe ich noch Zeit hatte, mein Gesicht wegzusenken, lief ich schon; ich wich links an ihm vorbei und lief geradeaus eine leere, furchtbare Gasse hinunter, die Gasse einer fremden Stadt, einer Stadt, in der nichts vergeben wird.","Unlikely as it is, I somehow managed to get out of the house by myself towards evening; I ran, I turned a corner, and at the same moment I bumped into him. I don't understand how what happened now could have happened in about five seconds. No matter how densely you tell it, it takes much longer. I'd hurt myself running into him; I was small, it seemed like a lot not to cry, and I instinctively expected to be comforted. Since he didn't, I thought he was embarrassed; I suspected he couldn't think of the right joke to resolve this matter. I was happy enough to help him, but it required looking him in the face. I said he was tall. Now he had not, as he naturally should have, bent over me, so that he was at a height for which I was not prepared. There was still nothing in front of me but the smell and the peculiar hardness of his suit that I had felt. Suddenly his face came. How it was? I don't know, I don't want to know. It was an enemy's face. And next to this face, close by, at the level of the terrible eyes, stood his fist like a second head. Before I had time to lower my face I was running; I slipped past him on the left and ran straight down an empty, awful lane, the lane of a strange town, a town where nothing is forgiven.","As unlikely as it may seem, I had somehow managed to get away from the house alone, toward evening. I was running; I turned the corner of a street, and at the same instant I ran into him. I don’t understand how what happened now could have taken place within about five seconds. It will take much longer than that to tell the story, however concise I may be. I had hurt myself in the collision; I was little, and I thought I already deserved a lot of credit for not crying; also, I was involuntarily expecting to be comforted. Since he wasn’t doing anything, I supposed that he was embarrassed; probably he couldn’t find the right sort of joking remark to relieve the situation. I didn’t mind helping him, but for that I would have to look him in the face. I said that he was tall. Now he hadn’t bent down to me, as would have been natural; so that he was standing at a height that I wasn’t prepared for. In front of me there was still nothing but the smell and the peculiar roughness of his suit, which I had felt. Suddenly his face appeared. What was it like? I don’t know, I don’t want to know. It was the face of an enemy. And beside this face, right beside it, on the level of his terrifying eyes, like a second head, was his fist. Even before I had time to lower my own face, I was already running; I dodged past him on the left and ran straight down an empty, horrible street, a street in an alien city, a city in which nothing was ever forgiven.","Unlikely though it may seem, as evening approached I had somehow contrived to get out of the house alone; I was running, turned a corner, and ran right into him there and then. I do not understand how what happened next could have occurred within about five seconds. It will take much longer to tell, no matter how concise I may be. In colliding with him I had hurt myself; I was small, and to me it seemed quite something that I wasn't crying, and moreover, without really thinking about it, I was waiting to be comforted. Since he did no such thing, I assumed he was embarrassed; presumably the right joke that would relieve the whole situation did not occur to him. I was perfectly happy to help him out, but to do so I needed to look him in the face. I have said he was tall. Now, he had not done the natural thing and bent down to me, which meant that he stood at a height for which I was unprepared. There was still nothing before me but the smell and the distinctive roughness of his suit, which I had felt. All of a sudden his face appeared. What was it like? I do not know, nor do I want to know. It was the face of an enemy. And beside that face, right beside it, on a level with those terrifying eyes, like a second head, was his fist. Even before I had time to lower my own gaze, I was running; I dodged past him to the left, and ran straight down a fearful, deserted back street, a street in an unfamiliar city, a city where there was no forgiveness.","Improbable as it may sound, I had somehow succeeded in getting out of the house on my own one evening; I ran, I turned a corner and just at that moment I ran into him. I don’t understand how what happened then could have taken place in five seconds or so. However dense the narrative, it takes much longer to tell. I’d hurt myself when I ran into him; I was small, it already seemed quite something that I wasn’t crying, and I was also instinctively expecting to be comforted. Because he didn’t do this, I thought he must be embarrassed; I was guessing that he couldn’t think of the right pleasantry that would resolve the matter. I was quite happy to help him out, but in order to do so I would have had to look him in the face. I’ve already said he was tall. But he hadn’t leaned down towards me as would have been perfectly natural, with the result that he was at a height that I wasn’t prepared for. There was still nothing ahead of me but the smell and the peculiar scratchiness of his suit, which I had touched. Suddenly his face appeared. What was it like? I don’t know, I don’t want to know. It was the face of an enemy. And next to this face, tight up against it, at the same height as his terrible eyes, like a second head, there was his fist. Before I even had time to lower my face I was running away; I slipped past him on the left and ran straight down an awful empty street, a street in a strange town, a town in which nothing is forgiven."
"Die Hunde, in denen die Erwartung den ganzen Tag angewachsen war, preschten durch die Büsche und trieben einen zusammen zu dem, den sie meinten. Und den Rest tat das Haus. Man mußte nur eintreten in seinen vollen Geruch, schon war das Meiste entschieden. Kleinigkeiten konnten sich noch ändern; im ganzen war man schon der, für den sie einen hier hielten; der, dem sie aus seiner kleinen Vergangenheit und ihren eigenen Wünschen längst ein Leben gemacht hatten; das gemeinsame Wesen, das Tag und Nacht unter der Suggestion ihrer Liebe stand, zwischen ihrer Hoffnung und ihrem Argwohn, vor ihrem Tadel oder Beifall.","The dogs, whose anticipation had been growing all day, rushed through the bushes and herded you to the one they meant.

And the house did the rest. He had only to enter into the fullness of its odour and almost everything was settled. The odd detail might yet be altered, but all in all he was already the one they took him for; the one for whom they had long since made up a life, out of his little past and their own wishful thinking; that creature known to them all who was under the influence of their love day and night, the object of their hope and their distrust, their disapproval or applause.","The dogs, whose expectations had been growing all day long, tore through the bushes and chivvied him into being the person they thought he was. And the house did the rest. He only had to step into its encompassing aroma and most things had been settled.

"Maman kam nie in der Nacht--, oder doch, einmal kam sie. Ich hatte geschrieen und geschrieen, und Mademoiselle war gekommen und Sieversen, die Haushälterin, und Georg, der Kutscher; aber das hatte nichts genutzt. Und da hatten sie endlich den Wagen nach den Eltern geschickt, die auf einem großen Balle waren, ich glaube beim Kronprinzen. Und auf einmal hörte ich ihn hereinfahren in den Hof, und ich wurde still, saß und sah nach der Tür. Und da rauschte es ein wenig in den anderen Zimmern, und Maman kam herein in der großen Hofrobe, die sie gar nicht in acht nahm, und lief beinah und ließ ihren weißen Pelz hinter sich fallen und nahm mich in die bloßen Arme. Und ich befühlte, erstaunt und entzückt wie nie, ihr Haar und ihr kleines, gepflegtes Gesicht und die kalten Steine an ihren Ohren und die Seide am Rand ihrer Schultern, die nach Blumen dufteten. Und wir blieben so und weinten zärtlich und küßten uns, bis wir fühlten, daß der Vater da war und daß wir uns trennen mußten. ""Er hat hohes Fieber"", hörte ich Maman schüchtern sagen, und der Vater griff nach meiner Hand und zählte den Puls. Er war in der Jägermeisteruniform mit dem schönen, breiten, gewässerten blauen Band des Elefanten. ""Was für ein Unsinn, uns zu rufen"", sagte er ins Zimmer hinein, ohne mich anzusehen. Sie hatten versprochen, zurückzukehren, wenn es nichts Ernstliches wäre. Und Ernstliches war es ja nichts. Auf meiner Decke aber fand ich Mamans Tanzkarte und weiße Kamelien, die ich noch nie gesehen hatte und die ich mir auf die Augen legte, als ich merkte, wie kühl sie waren.","Maman never came at night--or she did, once. I screamed and screamed, and Mademoiselle came, and Sieversen, the housekeeper, and Georg, the coachman; but that was of no use. And then they finally sent the carriage to the parents, who were at a big ball, I think at the Crown Prince's. And all of a sudden I heard him driving into the yard, and I became quiet, sat and looked at the door. And then there was a little rustling in the other rooms, and Maman came in in the big court robe, which she didn't pay any attention to, and almost ran and dropped her white fur behind her and took me in her bare arms. And I felt, amazed and delighted as never before, her hair and her small, well-groomed face and the cold stones on her ears and the silk on the edge of her shoulders, which smelled of flowers. And we stayed like that and cried tenderly and kissed until we felt that Father was there and that we had to part. ""He has a high fever,"" I heard Maman say shyly, and Father took my hand and counted my pulse. He was in the Jägermeister uniform with the beautiful, broad, watered-blue elephant band. ""What nonsense to call us,"" he said into the room without looking at me. They had promised to return if it was nothing serious. And it wasn't anything serious. But on my blanket I found Maman's dance card and white camellias, which I had never seen before, and which I put over my eyes when I realized how cool they were.","Maman never came at night—, or rather, she did come once. I had been screaming and screaming, and Mademoiselle had come, and Sieversen the housekeeper, and Georg the coachman; but it had done no good. And finally they had sent the carriage for my parents, who were at a great ball, at the Crown Prince ’s, I think. And all at once I heard it drive in to the courtyard and I stopped screaming, sat up and looked over to the door. And then there was a faint rustling in the adjoining rooms, and Maman came in, in her magnificent court gown—she was hardly aware she had it on—and almost ran in and let her white fur fall behind her and took me in her bare arms. And I, astonished and enchanted as I had never been before, touched her hair and her little smooth face and the cold jewels in her ears and the silk at the edge of her shoulders, which smelled of flowers. And we stayed like that and cried tenderly and kissed each other, until we felt that Father was there and that we had to separate. “He has a high fever,” I heard Maman say timidly, and Father reached for my hand and took my pulse. He was wearing the uniform of the Master of the Hunt, with its beautiful, broad, watered blue ribbon of the Order of the Elephant. “What nonsense to send for us,” he said, speaking into the room without looking at me. They had promised to go back if it was nothing serious. And certainly it was nothing serious. But on my blanket I found Maman’s dance-card, and white camellias, which I had never seen before and which I placed on my eyes when I felt how cool they were.","Maman never came to me at night – or rather, she did come once.

And all at once, I heard it drive into the courtyard, and I fell silent, sat up, and fixed my eyes on the door. And then there was a faint rustling sound in the adjacent rooms, and Maman came in, in her magnificent court gown, not paying heed to it at all, almost running, and letting her white fur fall behind her, and taking me in her bare arms. And I, with an astonishment and rapture I had never felt before, touched her hair and her small, immaculate face and the cold stones at her ears and the silk that fringed her bloom-fragrant shoulders. And thus we remained, weeping tenderly and kissing, until we sensed that Father was there and we had to separate. ‘ He has a high temperature,’ I heard Maman say timidly, and Father reached for my hand and took my pulse. He was wearing the uniform of the Master of the Hunt, and the beautiful, broad, watered blue ribbon of the Order of the Elephant. ‘What nonsense, sending for us,’ he observed to the room without looking at me. They had promised to go back if it was nothing serious. And it was not serious.

"über die vom langen Lächeln abgespannten Gesichter der Überredenden aus, schon trat die gute Gräfin, um sich nichts zu vergeben, mitleidig und würdig einen Schritt ab, da, als es durchaus nicht mehr nötig war, gab sie nach.

"Einmal, als es über dieser Erzählung fast dunkel geworden war, war ich nahe daran, Maman von der 'Hand' zu erzählen: in diesem Augenblick hätte ich es gekonnt. Ich atmete schon auf, um anzufangen, aber da fiel mir ein, wie gut ich den Diener begriffen hatte, daß er nicht hatte kommen können auf ihre Gesichter zu. Und ich fürchtete mich trotz der Dunkelheit vor Mamans Gesicht, wenn es sehen würde, was ich gesehen habe. Ich holte rasch noch einmal Atem, damit es den Anschein habe, als hätte ich nichts anderes gewollt. Ein paar Jahre hernach, nach der merkwürdigen Nacht in der Galerie auf Urnekloster, ging ich tagelang damit um, mich dem kleinen Erik anzuvertrauen. Aber er hatte sich nach unserem nächtlichen Gespräch wieder ganz vor mir zugeschlossen, er vermied mich; ich glaube, daß er mich verachtete. Und gerade deshalb wollte ich ihm von der 'Hand' erzählen. Ich bildete mir ein, ich würde in seiner Meinung gewinnen (und das wünschte ich dringend aus irgendeinem Grunde), wenn ich ihm begreiflich machen könnte, daß ich das wirklich erlebt hatte. Erik aber war so geschickt im Ausweichen, daß es nicht dazu kam. Und dann reisten wir ja auch gleich. So ist es, wunderlich genug, das erstemal, daß ich (und schließlich auch nur mir selber) eine Begebenheit erzähle, die nun weit zurückliegt in meiner Kindheit.","Once, when it had almost gotten dark over this story, I was on the point of telling Maman about the 'hand': at that moment I could have done it. I breathed a sigh of relief to begin, but then I remembered how well I had understood the servant not being able to come up to their faces. And I was afraid of Maman's face, despite the darkness, if it saw what I saw. I took a quick breath to make it seem as if I had wanted nothing else. A few years later, after the strange night in the gallery at Urnekloster, I went about confiding in little Erik for days. But after our nocturnal conversation he closed himself completely to me again, he avoided me; I think he despised me. And that's why I wanted to tell him about the 'hand'. I figured I'd win his opinion (and for some reason I desperately wanted it) if I could make him understand that I'd really experienced it. But Erik was so adept at avoiding it that it didn't come to that. And then we went straight away. So it is, strangely enough, the first time that I (and ultimately only myself) relate an event that happened far back in my childhood.","On one occasion, when it had grown almost dark during her recitation, I was about to tell Maman the story of “the hand”: at that moment I could have done it. I had taken a long breath before beginning; but then it occurred to me how well I had understood the servant’s hesitation at approaching their faces. And, in spite of the growing darkness, I was afraid of what Maman’s face would look like when it saw what I had seen. Quickly I took another breath, to make it look like that was all I had meant to do. A few years later, after the strange night in the gallery at Urnekloster, I went around for days intending to tell Erik my secret. But after our nocturnal conversation he had once more completely shut off from me; he avoided me; I think he even despised me. And just because of this I wanted to tell him about “the hand.” I imagined I would win his respect (which for some reason I urgently desired) if I could make him understand that I had really had that experience. But Erik was so skillful in eluding me that I never had the chance. And then we left shortly afterward. So, strangely enough, this is the first time I am telling (and after all only for myself) about an event that now lies far back in my childhood.","On one occasion, when it had grown almost dark as she told this story, I was on the brink of telling Maman about the ‘hand’: at that moment, I could have. I had already taken a deep breath to make a start, when I recollected how well I had understood the servant's inability to approach their faces. And, in spite of the dark, I was afraid of what Maman's face would be like, once it saw what I had seen. Hastily I drew another breath, to make it seem that that was all I had meant to do. A few years later, after that memorable evening in the dining hall at Urnekloster, I was on the point, for days on end, of confiding in little Erik. But following our nocturnal talk he had shut himself completely off from me once again: he was avoiding me; I believe he despised me. And for that very reason I wanted to tell him about the ‘hand’. I imagined I would rise in his esteem (which I desperately wanted, for some reason or other) if I could make him understand that it was something I had really experienced. Erik, however, was so good at eluding me that the moment never came. And then we made our departure, shortly after. This is therefore the first time, oddly enough, that I am telling (to myself alone, after all) of an occurrence that is now far back in my childhood.","Once, when it had almost grown dark during the telling of this tale, I was on the verge of telling Maman about ‘the hand’: at that moment I might have been able to do it. I was just taking a deep breath before starting when I remembered how well I had understood the servant who hadn’t been able to approach them because of their faces. And I was afraid of Maman’s face, despite the dark, and of it seeing what I had seen. I quickly drew breath again, to give the impression that that’s all I had wanted to do. A few years later, after the curious night in the gallery at Urnekloster, I spent a whole day considering confiding in little Erik about it. But after our nocturnal conversation he had shut me out completely once more, and he avoided me; I think he despised me. But that was exactly why I wanted to tell him about ‘the hand’. I told myself that I would rise in his estimation (and for some reason that was something I urgently wanted) if I could make him understand that this was something I had really experienced. But Erik was so skilful at evading me that it never happened. And then in any case we left almost at once. So, astonishingly enough, this is the first time that I have recounted an incident (and after all I am only recounting it to myself here) that dates back a long way into my childhood."
"Das war damals, als von Zeit zu Zeit Männer fremdlings, mit geschwärztem Gesicht, ihn in seinem Bette überfielen, um ihm das in die Schwären hineingefaulte Hemde abzureißen, das er schon längst für sich selber hielt. Es war verdunkelt im Zimmer, und sie zerrten unter seinen steifen Armen die mürben Fetzen weg, wie sie sie griffen. Dann leuchtete einer vor, und da erst entdeckten sie die jäsige Wunde auf seiner Brust, in die das eiserne Amulett eingesunken war, weil er es jede Nacht an sich preßte mit aller Kraft seiner Inbrunst; nun stand es tief in ihm, fürchterlich kostbar, in einem Perlensaum von Eiter wie ein wundertuender Rest in der Mulde eines Reliquärs.

Then one of them shone before them, and only then did they discover the seething wound on his chest, into which the iron amulet had sunk, because he clutched it to him every night with all the strength of his fervor; now it stood deep within him, terribly precious, in a fringe of beads of pus, like a wondrous residue in the hollow of a reliquary.

"Damals erlebte ich, was ich jetzt begreife: jene schwere, massive, verzweifelte Zeit. Die Zeit, in der der Kuß zweier, die sich versöhnten, nur das Zeichen für die Mörder war, die herumstanden. Sie tranken aus demselben Becher, sie bestiegen vor aller Augen das gleiche Reitpferd, und es wurde verbreitet, daß sie die Nacht in einem Bette schlafen würden: und über allen diesen Berührungen wurde ihr Widerwillen aneinander so dringend, daß, sooft einer die schlagenden Adern des andern sah, ein krankhafter Ekel ihn bäumte, wie beim Anblick einer Kröte.

"Aber ich fürchtete mich auch schon früher. Zum Beispiel, als mein Hund starb. Derselbe, der mich ein- für allemal beschuldigte. Er war sehr krank. Ich kniete bei ihm schon den ganzen Tag, da plötzlich bellte er auf, ruckweise und kurz, wie er zu tun pflegte, wenn ein Fremder ins Zimmer trat. Ein solches Bellen war für diesen Fall zwischen uns gleichsam verabredet worden, und ich sah unwillkürlich nach der Tür. Aber es war schon in ihm. Beunruhigt suchte ich seinen Blick, und auch er suchte den meinen; aber nicht um Abschied zu nehmen. Er sah mich hart und befremdet an. Er warf mir vor, daß ich es hereingelassen hatte. Er war überzeugt, ich hätte es hindern können. Nun zeigte es sich, daß er mich immer überschätzt hatte. Und es war keine Zeit mehr, ihn aufzuklären.

"änderte in der Tat nichts an seiner bescheidenen, regelmäßigen Lebensführung, und die Sonntage brachte er nun damit zu, seine Rechnung in Ordnung zu bringen. Aber schon nach ein paar Wochen fiel es ihm auf, daß er unglaublich viel ausgäbe. Ich werde mich einschränken, dachte er. Er stand früher auf, er wusch sich weniger ausführlich, er trank stehend seinen Tee, er lief ins Bureau und kam viel zu früh. Er ersparte überall ein bißchen Zeit.

But when Sunday came, there weren't any savings to show for his efforts; and he realized he had been cheated. I should never have got small change, he told himself.

But on Sunday none of what was saved was there. Then he realized that he was being cheated. I ought not to have made the exchange, he said to himself. How long a proper year would last.

Es gab da Zofen, die vor Neugierde nicht wußten, wo ihre Hände sich gerade aufhielten, junge Bediente, die alles anglotzten, und ältere Dienstleute, die herumgingen und sich zu erinnern suchten, was man ihnen von diesem verschlossenen Zimmer, in dem sie sich nun glücklich befanden, alles erzählt hatte.","The long old manor house was too small for this death, it seemed as if wings had to be added, for the chamberlain's body kept growing, and he wanted to be carried from one room to another all the time, and got into a terrible rage when the The day wasn't over and there wasn't a room he hadn't already lain in. Then they went up the stairs with the whole procession of servants, maids, and dogs, which he always had with him, and, with the steward in the lead, into his blessed mother's death room, all in the state in which she was twenty-three years ago had left, had been preserved and which no one else was ever allowed to enter. Now the whole pack broke in there. The curtains were drawn back, and the robust light of a summer afternoon examined all the shy, startled objects, turning awkwardly in the flung mirrors. And so did people. There were maids who, out of curiosity, didn't know where their hands were at the moment, young servants who gaped at everything, and older servants who walked around trying to remember what they were told about this locked room in which they were now happy, had told everything.","The long, ancient manor-house was too small for this death; it seemed as if new wings would have to be added on, for the Chamberlain’s body grew larger and larger, and he kept wanting to be carried from one room to another, bursting into a terrible rage if, before the day had ended, there were no more rooms that he hadn’t already been brought to. Then he had to go upstairs, with the whole retinue of servants, chambermaids, and dogs which he always had around him, and, ushered in by the chief steward, they entered the room where his dear mother had died. It had been kept exactly as she had left it twenty-three years before, and since then no one had ever been allowed to set foot in it. Now the whole pack burst in. The curtains were pulled back, and the robust light of a summer afternoon examined all the shy, terrified objects and turned around clumsily in the forced-open mirrors. And the people did the same. There were maids who, in their curiosity, didn’t know where their hands were loitering, young servants who gaped at everything, and older ones who walked around trying to remember all the stories they had been told about this locked room which they had now, incredibly, entered.","The rambling old manor house was too small for that death. It seemed as if additional wings would have to be built on, for the Chamberlain's body grew larger and larger, and he was forever demanding to be carried from one room to the next and falling into a fearful rage if the day was not yet done and no room remained in which he had not lain. At such times, he would be borne upstairs, accompanied by the entire retinue of servants, maids and dogs that were forever in attendance, and with the major-domo leading the way he would enter the room in which his sainted mother had passed away twenty-three years before, which had been kept precisely as she had left it and in which none but he was permitted to set foot. Now the whole mob burst in. The curtains were flung open, and the robust light of a summer afternoon strayed inquisitively among the wary, startled objects and turned awkwardly in the wide-eyed mirrors. And the people did the same. There were chambermaids so consumed by curiosity that they knew not what their hands were up to, young servants who gaped at everything, and elder staff who walked about trying to recall what they had been told concerning this locked room which they now had the good fortune to have entered.","The broad old manor house was too small for this death, it seemed, as if we ought to have extended it, added wings, for the Chamberlain’s body kept growing, and he perpetually wanted to be carried from one room into another and flew into furious rages if the day was not yet over but there were no rooms left in which he had not yet lain. Then a whole procession of servants, maids, and the dogs with which he always surrounded himself, would climb the stairs and, the steward leading the way, move into the room in which his late lamented mother had died, which had been maintained wholly unchanged from when she had left it twenty-three years before. Now the whole mob would burst in. The curtains were drawn back and the robust light of a summer afternoon interrogated all the shy, startled objects and twisted itself round clumsily in the mirrors that had been ripped open. And the people did the same thing. There were ladies’ maids who were so curious that they didn’t know what their hands were doing, young servants gawping at everything, and elderly retainers who went round trying to remember the stories they had been told about this locked room in which they were now fortunate enough to find themselves at last."
"Nein, er wird fortgehen. Zum Beispiel während sie alle beschäftigt sind, ihm den Geburtstagstisch zu bestellen mit den schlecht erratenen Gegenständen, die wieder einmal alles ausgleichen sollen. Fortgehen für immer. Viel später erst wird ihm klar werden, wie sehr er sich damals vornahm, niemals zu lieben, um keinen in die entsetzliche Lage zu bringen, geliebt zu sein. Jahre hernach fällt es ihm ein und, wie andere Vorsätze, so ist auch dieser unmöglich gewesen. Denn er hat geliebt und wieder geliebt in seiner Einsamkeit; jedesmal mit Verschwendung seiner ganzen Natur und unter unsäglicher Angst um die Freiheit des andern. Langsam hat er gelernt, den geliebten Gegenstand mit den Strahlen seines Gefühls zu durchscheinen, statt ihn darin zu verzehren. Und er war verwöhnt von dem Entzücken, durch die immer transparentere Gestalt der Geliebten die Weiten zu erkennen, die sie seinem unendlichen Besitzenwollen auftat.","No, he will go away.

"Und die Geburtstage natürlich, zu denen man Kinder eingeladen bekam, die man kaum kannte, verlegene Kinder, die einen verlegen machten, oder dreiste, die einem das Gesicht zerkratzten, und zerbrachen, was man gerade bekommen hatte, und die dann plötzlich fortfuhren, wenn alles aus Kästen und Laden herausgerissen war und zu Haufen lag.

"Die schmale, schwarze Halsbinde war in derselben losen unpersönlichen Weise um den Kragen geschnallt, und dem Rock sah man es an, daß er von anderen über diesen willenlosen Körper gezogen worden war. Die Hand hatte man auf diese Hose gelegt, dorthin wo sie lag, und sogar das Haar war wie von Leichenwäscherinnen gekämmt und war, wie das Haar ausgestopfter Tiere, steif geordnet.

"Es war ein unbekanntes deutsches Lied. Sie sang es merkwürdig einfach, wie etwas Notwendiges. Sie sang: ""Du, der ichs nicht sage, daß ich bei Nacht weinend liege, deren Wesen mich müde macht wie eine Wiege. Du, die mir nicht sagt, wenn sie wacht meinetwillen: wie, wenn wir diese Pracht ohne zu stillen in uns ertrügen?

(a brief pause, then hesitantly:) Look at lovers: whenever they start confessing what is deep in their heart, what liars they soon become.","It was an unknown German song. She sang it with remarkable simplicity, as if it were inevitable.

"Und da, über dem Ungetanen, ersteht ihm, fast zu schnell, die kleine, ins Unendliche hinaus gespannte Gestalt, die (nach Galiens Zeugnis) alle meinten, wenn sie sagten: die Dichterin. Denn wie hinter den Werken des Herakles Abbruch und Umbau der Welt verlangend aufstand, so drängten sich, gelebt zu werden, aus den Vorräten des Seins an die Taten ihres Herzens die Seligkeiten und Verzweiflungen heran, mit denen die Zeiten auskommen müssen.","And there, above the undone, there arises, almost too quickly, the small figure stretched out into infinity, which (according to Galien's testimony) everyone meant when they said: the poetess. For just as behind the works of Heracles there arose a demand for the world to be broken up and restructured, so the bliss and despair with which the times must make do, pushed to be lived from the stores of being to the deeds of their hearts.","And then, beyond the unfinished, there rises before him, almost too quickly, that small figure straining out into the infinite, whom (according to Galen’s testimony) they all had in mind when they said “the poetess.” For just as after the labors of Hercules, the destruction and rebuilding of the world stood up, demanding to be fulfilled: so, from the storehouse of being, all the ecstasies and despairs which the ages would have to manage with, crowded toward the deeds of her heart, so that they might be lived.","And, as he is contemplating what is unachieved, there arises before him, almost too quickly, that slight figure straining towards the infinite, whom everyone meant (according to Galen) when they said ‘the poetess’.69 For just as, after the labours of Hercules, all the destruction and reconstruction of the world cried out for fulfilment, so too, from the store of being, all the ecstasies and despairs which are the full, sole span of the ages crowded towards the deeds of her heart, to be lived.","And there, as he reflects on what has yet to be achieved, almost too quickly a small figure rises, reaching out intently into the infinite, the one everyone meant (according to Galen*) when they said simply ‘the poetess’.

"Oft, wenn Besuch dawar, hieß es, daß Schulins sich einschränkten. Das große, alte Schloß war abgebrannt vor ein paar Jahren, und nun wohnten sie in den beiden engen Seitenflügeln und schränkten sich ein. Aber das Gästehaben lag ihnen nun einmal im Blut. Das konnten sie nicht aufgeben. Kam jemand unerwartet zu uns, so kam er wahrscheinlich von Schulins; und sah jemand plötzlich nach der Uhr und mußte ganz erschrocken fort, so wurde er sicher auf Lystager erwartet.","Often, when there were visitors, it was said that the Schulins cut back. The big old castle burned down a few years ago, and now they lived in the two narrow side wings and restricted themselves. But having guests was in their blood. They couldn't give that up. If someone came to us unexpectedly, it was probably from Schulins; and someone suddenly looked at the clock and had to go away, quite frightened, so he was surely expected at Lystager.","Often, when visitors came, it was said that the Schulins were economizing. Their large, old manor-house had burned down a few years before, and they were now living in the two narrow wings and were economizing. But having guests was in their blood. They couldn’t give it up. If someone arrived at our house unexpectedly, he probably came from the Schulins’; and if someone suddenly looked at the clock and rushed off with a frightened look on his face, he was certainly expected at Lystager.","[42] It was often said, when visitors came, that the Schulins were tightening their belts. The big old manor house had burned down some years before, and they now lived in the two cramped wings, tightening their belts. But entertaining guests was in their blood. They could not give it up. Whenever someone arrived at our house unexpectedly, he had probably come from the Schulins'; and if someone suddenly glanced at the clock, and made a startled departure, it was doubtless because they were expecting him at Lystager.","[42] When we had visitors, the talk was often about how the Schulins* were economizing.

"Mich das jetzt überdenke, kann ich mich wundern, daß ich aus der Welt dieser Fieber doch immer wieder ganz zurückkam und mich hineinfand in das überaus gemeinsame Leben, wo jeder im Gefühl unterstützt sein wollte, bei Bekanntem zu sein, und wo man sich so vorsichtig im Verständlichen vertrug. Da wurde etwas erwartet, und es kam oder es kam nicht, ein Drittes war ausgeschlossen. Da gab es Dinge, die traurig waren, ein--für allemal, es gab angenehme Dinge und eine ganze Menge nebensächlicher. Wurde aber einem eine Freude bereitet, so war es eine Freude, und er hatte sich danach zu benehmen. Im Grunde war das alles sehr einfach, und wenn man es erst heraus hatte, so machte es sich wie von selbst. In diese verabredeten Grenzen ging denn auch alles hinein; die langen, gleichmäßigen Schulstunden, wenn draußen der Sommer war; die Spaziergänge, von denen man französisch erzählen mußte; die Besuche, für die man hereingerufen wurde und die einen drollig fanden, wenn man gerade traurig war, und sich an einem belustigten wie an dem betrübten Gesicht gewisser Vögel, die kein anderes haben.","When I think about it now, I can be surprised that I always came back from the world of these fevers and found my way into the extremely common life, where everyone wanted to be supported in the feeling of being with familiar people and where one was so careful understandable tolerated. Something was expected, and it either came or didn't come, a third party was out of the question. There were things that were sad, once and for all, there were pleasant things, and a whole lot of things that were beside the point. But if pleasure was given to one, it was pleasure, and he had to behave accordingly. Basically it was all very simple, and once you got the hang of it, it seemed to work itself out. Everything went within these agreed limits; the long, regular school hours when it was summer outside; the walks that you had to talk about in French; the visits for which one was called in and who found one amusing when one was sad, and amused one like the sad face of certain birds that have no other.","When I think about it now, I can’t help being astonished that I always managed to completely return from the world of these fevers and was able to adjust to that social existence where everyone wanted to be reassured that they were among familiar objects and people, where they all conspired to remain in the realm of the intelligible. If you looked forward to something, it either came or didn’t come, there was no third possibility. There were Things that were sad, once and for all, and there were pleasant Things, and a great number of incidental ones. And if a joy was arranged for you, it was in fact a joy, and you had to behave accordingly. All this was basically very simple, and once you got the knack of it, it took care of itself. For everything entered into these appointed boundaries: the long, monotonous school hours, when it was summer outside; the walks that afterward you had to describe in French; the visitors into whose presence you were summoned and who thought you were amusing, just when you were feeling sad, and laughed at you the way people laugh at the melancholy expression of certain birds, who don’t have any other face.","If I think about it now, I am amazed that I was always able to make a complete return from the world of those fevers, and to find my way back into that altogether shared existence in which everyone sought reassurance that he was among familiar things and where people were careful not to stray from the realm of the comprehensible. If they had an expectation, it was either fulfilled or it was not; there was no third option. There were things that were sad, and that was that; there were pleasant things; and there were a great many things of no consequence at all. But if a special treat was prepared for you, it was a special treat and you had to behave accordingly. Essentially it was all very straightforward, and, once you had the knack, things took care of themselves. Within the agreed boundaries, everything fitted in: those long, monotonous hours at school when it was summer outside; walks that you afterwards had to describe in French; visitors you were called in to meet, who declared you a droll child if you happened to be heavy-hearted and were as amused by you as they might be by the melancholy faces of certain birds that have no other faces to put on.","Now that I think about it again, I’m sometimes surprised at how I re-emerged from the world of those fevers completely on every occasion and acclimatized myself again to the highly communal life we led, where everyone wanted to feel reassured that they were in a familiar environment and where people were so careful to keep within the bounds of what was comprehensible in their dealings with each other. Something was expected, and it came or it didn’t come; there was no third option. There were things that were sad, and that was an end of it; there were enjoyable things and a whole lot that was incidental. But if something brought you pleasure, then pleasure was what it was and you had to behave accordingly. At root, everything was very simple, and once you had worked that out, things took care of themselves. So everything fitted into these agreed boundaries: the long, monotonous hours of lessons when it was summer outside; the walks that you had to talk about afterwards in French; the visitors that you were called in to meet, who found you funny just when you were sad, and who laughed at you in the way people laugh at the downcast faces of certain birds, which always look that way."

But here, my dears, here I am safe from you. One needs a special card to gain access to the reading room. I do have a card, and with it an advantage over you. I walk the streets somewhat warily, as may be imagined, but at length there I stand, at a glass door, open it as if I were at home, show my card at the next door (just as you show me your things, but with the difference that here they understand and know what I mean) – and then I am among these books, beyond your reach as though I were dead, and sit here reading a poet.","Not only at twilight; at midday, in the most densely packed streets, a little man or an old woman will suddenly be there, nodding, showing me something and disappearing again as if everything that was needed had now been done. It’s possible that one day it will occur to them to penetrate as far as my room , I’m sure they know where I live and they will see to it that the concierge doesn’t stop them. But here, my friends—here I am safe from you. You have to have a special pass to be allowed into this room. I have the advantage of this card, which you do not. As you can imagine, I walk through the streets a little timidly, but eventually I come to a glass door, open it as if I were at home, show my pass at the next door (exactly the way you show me your things, only the difference is that they understand me and comprehend what I want here—), and then here I am amongst the books, I’ve got away from you, as if I’d died, and I sit and read the works of a poet."
"überwände sich und äße den alten, süßlichen Bissen aus der verkümmerten Hand. Dem sind nun, wie immer, die Leute im Wege.

"Ich weiß noch genau, einmal, vorzeiten, zuhaus, fand ich ein Schmucketui; es war zwei Hände groß, fächerförmig mit einem eingepreßten Blumenrand im dunkelgrünen Saffian. Ich schlug es auf: es war leer. Das kann ich nun sagen nach so langer Zeit. Aber damals, da ich es geöffnet hatte, sah ich nur, woraus diese Leere bestand: aus Samt, aus einem kleinen Hügel lichten, nicht mehr frischen Samtes; aus der Schmuckrille, die, um eine Spur Wehmut heller, leer, darin verlief. Einen Augenblick war das auszuhalten. Aber vor denen, die als Geliebte zurückbleiben, ist es vielleicht immer so.","I still remember exactly, once, long ago, at home, I found a jewelry case; it was two hands tall, fan-shaped with an pressed border of flowers in dark green morocco.

It was bearable for a moment. But it may always be so in front of those who remain as lovers.","I still remember exactly how, one day long ago, at home, I found a jewel-case; it was two handsbreadths large, fan-shaped, with a border of flowers stamped into the dark-green morocco.

But at that time, when I had opened it, I saw only what its emptiness consisted of: velvet, a small mound of light-colored, no longer fresh velvet; and the jewel-groove which, empty and brighter by just a trace of melancholy, vanished into it. For a moment this was bearable. But to those who, as women who are loved, remain behind, it is perhaps always like this.","I well remember how, one day at home, a long time ago, I came across a jewellery case; it was two hand's-breadths deep, shaped like a fan, with a border of flowers impressed in the dark green morocco.

It was possible to bear it for just a moment. But when we are confronted with those that remain behind, loved, perhaps it is always thus.","* I can still remember exactly, once, long ago, at home, finding a jewellery case; it was two hands wide, fan-shaped with a border of flowers inlaid in dark green Morocco leather.

"Sie beschäftigte mich in mir und erfüllte mich mit einer Art endgültiger Frohheit, die ich für Kümmernis nahm, weil sie weit über mein Alter hinausging.

"Junge Mädchen allerdings findet man zuweilen davor. Denn es giebt eine Menge junger Mädchen in den Museen, die fortgegangen sind irgendwo aus den Häusern, die nichts mehr behalten. Sie finden sich vor diesen Teppichen und vergessen sich ein wenig. Sie haben immer gefühlt, daß es dies gegeben hat, solch ein leises Leben langsamer, nie ganz aufgeklärter Gebärden, und sie erinnern sich dunkel, daß sie sogar eine Zeitlang meinten, es würde ihr Leben sein. Aber dann ziehen sie rasch ein Heft hervor und beginnen zu zeichnen, gleichviel was, eine von den Blumen oder ein kleines, vergnügtes Tier. Darauf käme es nicht an, hat man ihnen vorgesagt, was es gerade wäre. Und darauf kommt es wirklich nicht an. Nur daß gezeichnet wird, das ist die Hauptsache; denn dazu sind sie fortgegangen eines Tages, ziemlich gewaltsam.","Young girls, however, can sometimes be found in front of them. Because there are a lot of young girls in the museums who have left somewhere from the houses who don't keep anything anymore. You find yourself in front of these carpets and forget yourself a little.

But then they quickly pull out a notebook and start drawing, it doesn't matter what, one of the flowers or a small, happy animal. It wouldn't matter if they were told what it was going to be. And it really doesn't matter. The main thing is that you draw; because that's why they went away one day, quite violently.","But occasionally you do find young girls in front of them.

"Und über der angestrengten Beschäftigung mit dem, was sie sich vorgenommen haben, diese jungen Mädchen, kommen sie nicht mehr dazu, aufzusehen.

"schon Cavalier, wie er immer tat, unter dem Tisch hervor und lief ihr entgegen. Ich hab es gesehen, Malte, ich hab es gesehen. Er lief ihr entgegen, obwohl sie nicht kam; für ihn kam sie. Wir begriffen, daß er ihr entgegenlief. Zweimal sah er sich nach uns um, als ob er fragte. Dann raste er auf sie zu, wie immer, Malte, genau wie immer, und erreichte sie; denn er begann rund herum zu springen, Malte, um etwas, was nicht da war, und dann hinauf an ihr, um sie zu lecken, gerade hinauf. Wir hörten ihn winseln vor Freude, und wie er so in die Höhe schnellte, mehrmals rasch hintereinander, hätte man wirklich meinen können, er verdecke sie uns mit seinen Sprüngen. Aber da heulte es auf einmal, und er drehte sich von seinem eigenen Schwunge in der Luft um und stürzte zurück, merkwürdig ungeschickt, und lag ganz eigentümlich flach da und rührte sich nicht. Von der andern Seite trat der Diener aus dem Hause mit den Briefen. Er zögerte eine Weile; offenbar war es nicht ganz leicht, auf unsere Gesichter zuzugehen. Und dein Vater winkte ihm auch schon, zu bleiben. Dein Vater, Malte, liebte keine Tiere; aber nun ging er doch hin, langsam wie mir schien, und bückte sich über den Hund. Er sagte etwas zu dem Diener, irgend etwas Kurzes, Einsilbiges. Ich sah, wie der Diener hinzusprang, um Cavalier aufzuheben. Aber da nahm dein Vater selbst das Tier und ging damit, als wüßte er genau wohin, ins Haus hinein.","Cavalier, as he always did, came out from under the table and ran to meet her. I saw it, Malte, I saw it. He ran to meet her, although she did not come; for him she came. We understood that he was running towards her. He looked around at us twice as if asking. Then he rushed towards her, as always, Malte, just as always, and reached her; for he began jumping around, Malte, around something that wasn't there, and then up at her to lick her, straight up. We could hear him whimpering with delight and the way he jumped up like that, several times in rapid succession, you could really think he was covering us with his leaps. But then suddenly there was a howl, and he turned from his own momentum in the air and fell back, strangely clumsy, and lay there strangely flat and didn't move. From the other side the servant came out of the house with the letters. He hesitated for a while; Apparently it wasn't easy walking up to our faces. And your father motioned for him to stay. Your father, Malte, didn't love animals; but now he went there, slowly it seemed to me, and bent over the dog. He said something to the servant, something short and monosyllabic. I saw the servant jump to pick up Cavalier. But then your father took the animal himself and went into the house with it, as if he knew exactly where to go.","God help me, I was just about to say, ‘Where is …’—when Cavalier shot out from under the table, as he always did, and ran to meet her. I saw it, Malte; I saw it. He ran toward her, although she wasn’t coming; for him she was coming. We understood that he was running to meet her. Twice he looked around at us, as if he were asking a question. Then he rushed at her, as he always did, Malte, just as he always did, and he reached her; for he began to jump around and around, Malte, around something that wasn’t there, and then he jumped up at her , he jumped up again and again to lick her. We heard him whimpering with joy, and from the way he was leaping into the air, several times in quick succession, you might really have thought it was his body that was hiding her from us. But suddenly there was a howl, and whirling around in midair from his own momentum, he pitched back with incredible clumsiness, and lay stretched out before us, strange and flat on the ground, not moving a muscle. From the other wing of the house a servant came out with the letters. He hesitated for a moment; apparently it wasn’t very easy to walk toward our faces. Besides, your father had already motioned to him that he should stop. Your father, Malte, didn’t like animals; but now, in spite of that, he went up, slowly, it seemed to me, and bent down over the dog. He said something to the servant, something brief, monosyllabic. I saw the servant jump forward to pick Cavalier up. But your father himself took the animal in his arms and carried it, as if he knew exactly where to take it, into the house.”","when Cavalier shot out from under the table, as he always did, and ran towards her. He ran towards her, although she was not there; for him, she was there, coming. We grasped that he was running to meet her. Twice he looked round towards us, as if putting a question. Then he raced towards her, as he always did, Malte, just as he always did, and reached her – for he began to frisk right around, Malte, around something that wasn't there, and then jumped up at her to lick her, right up. We heard him whimpering for joy, and to see him jump right up like that, several times in rapid succession, you could really have thought he was concealing her from us by his jumping. But suddenly he howled out, and swung back in mid-air from his own momentum, and plunged to the ground with a remarkable clumsiness and lay there, curiously flat, not making a move. From the far side of the house, a servant emerged with the letters. He hesitated for a moment; evidently it was no entirely easy thing, to walk towards our faces. And besides, your father gestured to him to stay where he was. Your father, Malte, was not fond of animals; but now he walked over, slowly, or so it seemed to me, and bent down over the dog. He said something to the servant, something curt, monosyllabic. I saw the man hurry over to pick up Cavalier. But your father took the creature himself, and, as if he knew exactly where he was going, went into the house. [29]","At that point Cavalier,* as usual, shot out from under the table and ran towards her. I saw it, Malte, I saw it. He ran towards her even though she wasn’t coming; for him, she was coming.

Then he raced towards her, as he always did, Malte, just as he always did, and he reached her, because he began to leap up all around, Malte, around something that wasn’t there, and then he climbed up her, to lick her face, right up. We could hear him whimpering with joy, and the way he bounded up high, several times in a row, quickly, one might really have thought that he was obscuring her with his jumping. But then all of a sudden there was a howl and he twisted round in the air midway through one of his leaps and fell back, oddly clumsily, and just lay there, peculiarly flat, and wouldn’t move. From the other side a servant came out of the house with the letters. He hesitated for a moment; approaching us was evidently not so straightforward, the way we were looking. And your father gave him a sign that he should stay. Your father, dear Malte, was never fond of animals, but on this occasion he went over to the dog, slowly it seemed to me, and stooped over him. He said something to the servant, something brief, monosyllabic. I saw the servant start forward to pick Cavalier up. But your father took the animal himself and went into the house with him, as if he knew exactly where he was heading. [29]"
"Das Versprechen erfüllt sich noch immer, irgendwann ist dasselbe Buch unter meine Bücher geraten, unter die paar Bücher, von denen ich mich nicht trenne. Nun schlägt es sich auch mir an den Stellen auf, die ich gerade meine, und wenn ich sie lese, so bleibt es unentschieden, ob ich an Bettine denke oder an Abelone. Nein, Bettine ist wirklicher in mir geworden, Abelone, die ich gekannt habe, war wie eine Vorbereitung auf sie, und nun ist sie mir in Bettine aufgegangen wie in ihrem eigenen, unwillkürlichen Wesen. Denn diese wunderliche Bettine hat mit allen ihren Briefen Raum gegeben, geräumigste Gestalt. Sie hat von Anfang an sich im Ganzen so ausgebreitet, als wär sie nach ihrem Tod. Überall hat sie sich ganz weit ins Sein hineingelegt, zugehörig dazu, und was ihr geschah, das war ewig in der Natur; dort erkannte sie sich und löste sich beinah schmerzhaft heraus; erriet sich mühsam zurück wie aus Überlieferungen, beschwor sich wie einen Geist und hielt sich aus.","The promise is still fulfilled, at some point the same book ended up among my books, among the few books I don't part with.

No, Bettine has become more real in me, Abelone, whom I knew, was like a preparation for her, and now she has melted into Bettine as into her own, involuntary being. Because this strange Bettine has given space to all her letters, the most spacious figure. From the beginning it has spread throughout the whole as if it were after death. Everywhere she placed herself very far into being, belonging to it, and what happened to her was eternal in nature; there she recognized herself and detached herself almost painfully; laboriously guessed himself back as if from lore, summoned himself like a ghost and endured.","The promise is still being fulfilled; at some time or other that same book appeared among my books, among the few books that I always have with me. It opens now, for me too, at the passages I happen to be thinking of, and when I read them, I’m not sure whether I think of Bettina or Abelone. No, Bettina has become more real in me; Abelone, whom I knew in the flesh, was like a preparation for her, and now she has completely merged into Bettina as if into her own instinctive being. For this strange Bettina created space with all her letters, a world of vastly enlarged dimensions. From the beginning she spread herself out through everything, as if she had already passed beyond her death. Everywhere, she deeply entered into existence, became part of it, and whatever happened to her had from all eternity been contained in nature; in it she recognized herself, and she detached herself from it almost painfully, laboriously guessed herself back, as if out of the past, conjured herself like a ghost and endured it","[57] That promise is still being kept. At some time or other, that same book found its way among my books, those very few books I shall never part with. Now it opens at the passages I happen to have in mind for me too, and when I read them I cannot be certain whether it is Bettina I am thinking of or Abelone. No, Bettina has become more real within me; Abelone, whom I actually knew, was like a preparation for her, and now, for me, she has completely merged into Bettina, as if she had been transmuted into her own absolute self. For that strange creature, Bettina, brought space into being with all of her letters, a world of spacious dimensions. From the very start she was present in everything, as if she already had her death behind her. Everywhere she entered into the profound depths of being, herself a part of it, and whatever happened to her was an eternal part of Nature; there she recognized herself, and pulled back with something akin to pain; she pieced herself together again, laboriously, as if inferring herself from the tales people tell, and conjured herself up like a spirit, and endured herself.","[57] That promise is still being kept, and at some point that very book got amongst my own books, and is one of the few books from which I will not be parted. Now it also opens for me at the passages that I happen to want it to, and when I read them it is uncertain whether I’m thinking about Bettina or Abelone. No, Bettina has become more real within me; Abelone, whom I knew, was like a preparation for her, and now she has been absorbed for me into Bettina as if in her own instinctive being. For with all her letters the marvellous Bettina has granted space, the most spacious form. From the very beginning she diffused herself so widely that it was as if she were already beyond her own death. Everywhere she instilled herself into being so broadly, intrinsic to it, and what happened to her was an eternal component of her nature; there she realized herself* and liberated herself almost painfully from it; she re-divined herself laboriously as if from historical tradition, conjured herself like a spirit, and withstood herself."
"es sich nicht um den Bleistift handeln konnte, begriff ich wohl: ich fühlte, daß das ein Zeichen war, ein Zeichen für Eingeweihte, ein Zeichen, das die Fortgeworfenen kennen; ich ahnte, sie bedeutete mir, ich müßte irgendwohin kommen oder etwas tun.

And the strangest thing of all was that I could not shake off the feeling that there was some kind of agreement between us, that the signal was part of an assignation, and that essentially I ought to have been expecting the scene to occur.","I sensed that it meant I had to go somewhere or do something. And the oddest thing was that I couldn’t rid myself of the constant feeling that there actually was an agreement of some kind, an agreement of which the sign was a part, and that this scene was in fact something that I ought to have been expecting."

Und wenn sie den Doktor holten und er war da und redete mir zu, so bat ich ihn, er möchte nur machen, daß das Große wegginge, alles andere wäre nichts. Aber er war wie die andern.

"Ein paar Stunden täglich brachte ich in Dronningens Tværgade zu, in den engen Zimmern, die beleidigt aussahen wie alle Mietswohnungen, in denen jemand gestorben ist. Ich ging zwischen dem Schreibtisch und dem großen weißen Kachelofen hin und her und verbrannte die Papiere des Jägermeisters. Ich hatte begonnen, die Briefschaften, so wie sie zusammengebunden waren, ins Feuer zu werfen, aber die kleinen Pakete waren zu fest verschnürt und verkohlten nur an den Rändern. Es kostete mich Überwindung, sie zu lockern. Die meisten hatten einen starken, überzeugenden Duft, der auf mich eindrang, als wollte er auch in mir Erinnerungen aufregen. Ich hatte keine. Dann konnte es geschehen, daß Photographien herausglitten, die schwerer waren als das andere; diese Photographien verbrannten unglaublich langsam. Ich weiß nicht, wie es kam, plötzlich bildete ich mir ein, es könnte Ingeborgs Bild darunter sein. Aber sooft ich hinsah, waren es reife, großartige, deutlich schöne Frauen, die mich auf andere Gedanken brachten. Es erwies sich nämlich, daß ich doch nicht ganz ohne Erinnerungen war. Genau solche Augen waren es, in denen ich mich manchmal fand, wenn ich, zur Zeit da ich heranwuchs, mit meinem Vater über die Straße ging. Dann konnten sie von einem Wageninnern aus mich mit einem Blick umgeben, aus dem kaum hinauszukommen war. Nun wußte ich, daß sie mich damals mit ihm verglichen und daß der Vergleich nicht zu meinen Gunsten ausfiel. Gewiß nicht, Vergleiche hatte der Jägermeister nicht zu fürchten.","I spent a few hours a day in Dronningens Tværgade, in the cramped rooms that looked insulted like all rented apartments where someone has died. I walked back and forth between the desk and the big white tiled stove and burned the Jägermeister's papers. I had started throwing the stationery into the fire as it was tied, but the little packages were tied too tightly and only charred around the edges. It took me an effort to loosen them. Most had a strong, persuasive scent that invaded me as if trying to stir memories in me too. I had none. Then it could happen that photographs that were heavier than the other slipped out; these photographs burned incredibly slowly. I don't know how it happened, suddenly I imagined that it could be Ingeborg's picture underneath. But every time I looked, they were mature, gorgeous, distinctly beautiful women who took my mind off things. It turned out that I wasn't entirely without memories after all. It was just such eyes that I sometimes found myself in when, as I was growing up, I was walking across the street with my father. Then, from inside the car, they could give me a look that was almost impossible to get out of. Now I knew that she compared me to him at the time and that the comparison was not in my favour. Certainly not, the Jägermeister had nothing to fear from being compared.","Every day I spent a few hours in the Dronningens Tvaergade, in those small rooms, which had the insulted look of all apartments in which someone has died. I walked back and forth between the desk and the large white porcelain stove, burning the Master of the Hunt’s papers. I had begun by throwing the letters into the fire in bundles, just as I had found them; but they were tied together too firmly, and only charred at the edges. I had to exercise a good deal of self-control before I could loosen them. Most of them had a strong, convincing fragrance, which penetrated me as if it wanted to stir up memories in me as well. I didn’t have any. Then some photographs, heavier than the rest, happened to slip out; these photographs took an unbelievably long time to burn. I don’t know why, but suddenly I imagined that Ingeborg’s picture might be among them. Each time I looked, though, I saw mature, splendid, obviously beautiful women, who suggested a different train of thought to me. For it turned out that I wasn’t entirely without memories after all. In exactly such eyes as these I had sometimes seen myself when, as a growing boy, I used to walk down the avenues with my father. Then, from inside a passing carriage, they might surround me with a look that I could hardly find my way out of. I knew now that in those days they had been comparing me with him and that the comparison hadn’t turned out in my favor. Certainly not; the Master of the Hunt had no need to be afraid of comparisons.","Every day I spent a few hours in Dronningens Tværgade, in those small rooms that wore the affronted look of all rented apartments where someone has died.

It cost me an effort to untie them. Most of them had a strong, penetrating scent that assailed me as if to stir up memories in me too. I had none. At times photographs slipped out, heavier than the rest; these photographs burned incredibly slowly. I do not know why, but presently I got it into my head that a picture of Ingeborg might be among them. But every woman I looked at was mature and superb, of manifest beauty, and put quite different thoughts into my head. It turned out that I was not altogether without memories after all. It was eyes exactly like these that sometimes gave me a sense of myself when, as a growing boy, I walked along the street with my father. Gazing at me from within a passing carriage, they could enfold me in a look from which there was hardly any escaping. Now I realized that in those days they had been comparing me with him, and that I had been found lacking. But that was to be expected: the Master of the Hunt had no need to fear comparisons.","I spent a few hours every day in Dronningens Tvaergade,* in the narrow rooms that gave the air of being offended, like all rented apartments in which someone has died.

I had begun to throw all the correspondence into the fire just as it was, in bundles, but the little packets were tied too tightly and merely got charred at the edges. It cost me some effort to loosen them. Most of them had a strong, emphatic smell that infiltrated me as if it wanted to stir up memories within me. I had none. Then photographs would sometimes slip out, because they were heavier than the other papers; these photographs burned incredibly slowly. I don’t know how it happened but I had the sudden impression that there might be a picture of Ingeborg amongst them. But every time I looked I saw magnificent mature, markedly beautiful women, who took my thoughts in other directions. So it turned out that I was not wholly without memories after all. It was eyes just like that in which I sometimes discovered myself when I crossed the road with my father while I was growing up. * From the inside of a carriage they could encompass me with a single glance from which it was hardly possible to escape.

Und die Glocke sagte es, die einen furchtbaren Rivalen bekommen hatte, der die ganze Nacht dröhnte und gegen den sie, selbst wenn sie aus allem Metall zu läuten begann, nichts vermochte.

And the church-bell said it, having found a terrible rival which boomed out all night long and against which, even when it rang with all its metal, it could do nothing. Indeed, they all said it; and one of the young men dreamed that he had gone to the manor-house and killed the master with his pitchfork; and they were so exasperated, so overstrained, that they all listened as he told his dream and, quite unconsciously, looked at him to see if he were really brave enough to do that. This is how people felt and talked in the whole district where, just a few weeks before, the Chamberlain had been loved and pitied. But though there was all this talk, nothing changed. Christoph Detlev’s death, which had moved in at Ulsgaard, refused to let itself be hurried.","And when the sound of that roar was heard in the village through the wide-open, silver Danish summer night, the people got up as they might in a thunderstorm, dressed and sat wordless around the lamp until it had passed. And women who were shortly to give birth were removed to the furthermost rooms, to beds in alcoves far from hearing; yet still they heard it, heard it as though the roaring were within their own bodies, and they begged to be allowed to get up as well, and came white and great with child to sit with the others with their smudged-out faces. And the cows that were calving at the time were helpless, and their young stillborn, and one calf had to be plucked forth dead, together with all the mother's entrails, when it absolutely would not come. And all the labourers did their work poorly, clean forgetting to bring in the hay because all day long they went in fear of the night, for the rising in terror and the long hours of waking had left them so exhausted that their thoughts were quite scattered. And on Sunday, when they went to the peaceful white church, they prayed for an end to lords of the Ulsgaard manor: for this one was a terrible master. And the minister voiced aloud from the pulpit what was in the thoughts and prayers of them all, for he too no longer enjoyed a night's rest, and had ceased to understand God. And the bell said it too, having found a fearsome rival who roared all night, a rival against whom it was powerless, even when the full weight of its metal was in its pealing. In fact, everyone said it; and one of the youngsters had dreamed he went to the manor and killed their lord and master with a pitchfork; and the others were so tense, worn out and agitated that they all listened attentively as he recounted his dream, speculating unconsciously whether he might in fact be up to doing the deed. And this was how people felt and spoke in the entire district, where only weeks before the Chamberlain had been held in such affection and compassion. But despite the talk, nothing changed. Christoph Detlev's death was installed at Ulsgaard and would not be hurried.","And when in the village, across the vast, silver, Danish summer night, they heard him roaring, they rose from their beds as they do during a storm, got dressed, and stayed sitting round the lamp until it was over. And the women who were close to giving birth were moved into the remotest rooms and the bed stalls* with the thickest walls. But they could hear it, they could hear it as if it were within their own bodies, and they begged to be allowed to get up as well, and came and sat, pale and spreading, beside the others with their blurred faces. And the cows that were calving at this time were helpless and unresponsive, and one had its progeny ripped from its body together with all its entrails because the calf refused to come. And everyone did their day’s work badly, and they forgot to bring in the hay because during the day they were afraid of the night, and because they were so exhausted from being awake so long, and from getting up in terror, that they couldn’t concentrate on anything at all. And when they went to the white, tranquil church on Sunday, they prayed that there would no longer be a lord of the manor at Ulsgaard: for theirs was a terrible lord. And what they were all thinking and praying for, the pastor declared out loud from up in the pulpit, for he too had had no sleep at night and could not comprehend God. And the bell said it too, for it had gained an awful rival that boomed all night long and on which, even were the bell to start ringing with every molecule of its metal, it could have no effect. Yes, everyone said so, and there was one of the younger ones who had dreamed he had entered the castle and slain the master with a pitchfork, and people were so outraged, so at their wits’ end, so overwrought, that they all listened when he recounted his dream and when they looked at him after that they wondered quite unconsciously whether he might be up to such a deed. That’s how people felt and talked across the whole region where until only a few weeks ago the Chamberlain was treated with love and compassion. But despite people talking that way, nothing changed. Christoph Detlev’s death, now that it was lodged at Ulsgaard, would not be displaced."

"Ich hörte ihn die ganze Nacht in seinem Zimmer auf und ab gehen; denn auch ich konnte nicht schlafen. Aber plötzlich gegen Morgen erwachte ich doch aus irgend etwas Schlafähnlichem und sah mit einem Entsetzen, daß mich bis ins Herz hinein lähmte, etwas Weißes, das an meinem Bette saß. Meine Verzweiflung gab mir schließlich die Kraft, den Kopf unter die Decke zu stecken, und dort begann ich aus Angst und Hülflosigkeit zu weinen. Plötzlich wurde es kühl und hell über meinen weinenden Augen; ich drückte sie, um nichts sehen zu müssen, über den Tränen zu. Aber die Stimme, die nun von ganz nahe auf mich einsprach, kam lau und süßlich an mein Gesicht, und ich erkannte sie: es war Fräulein Mathildes Stimme. Ich beruhigte mich sofort und ließ mich trotzdem, auch als ich schon ganz ruhig war, immer noch weiter trösten; ich fühlte zwar, daß diese Güte zu weichlich sei, aber ich genoß","I heard him pacing his room all night; because I couldn't sleep either. But suddenly towards morning I awoke from something like sleep and saw, with a horror that paralyzed my heart, something white sitting by my bed. My desperation finally gave me the strength to put my head under the covers and there I began to cry out of fear and helplessness. Suddenly it grew cool and light over my weeping eyes; so as not to have to see anything, I squeezed them shut over the tears. But the voice that spoke to me from very close by came lukewarm and sweet to my face, and I recognized it: it was Fraulein Mathilde's voice. I calmed down immediately and still allowed myself to be comforted even after I was quite calm; I felt that this kindness was too soft, but I enjoyed it","All night long I heard him pacing back and forth in his bedroom; for I couldn’t sleep either. But suddenly, toward morning, I woke out of a sleep-like drowsiness and saw, with a horror that made my bones freeze, something white sitting on my bed. Despair finally gave me enough strength to bury my head under the covers, and there, from fear and helplessness, I began to cry. Suddenly I felt something cool and bright above my tear-filled eyes; I kept them closed so I wouldn’t have to see what it was. But the voice which was now speaking to me from quite nearby touched my face with its warm, sweetish breath, and I recognized it: it was the voice of Miss Mathilde. I immediately grew calm, and even when I was quite composed I continued to let myself be comforted.","I heard him pacing to and fro in his room all night long; for I could not sleep either. But suddenly, as morning approached, I awoke from a drowsiness close to sleep and, with a horror that numbed me to the very heart, saw something white sitting on my bed. In my desperation I finally mustered the strength to hide my head under the covers, and there, for fear and helplessness, I began to cry. Suddenly there was a coolness and brightness above my crying eyes; I scrunched them tight shut over my tears, so that I would not have to see anything. But the voice that now spoke to me from very near brushed my face with a mild sweetness, and I recognized it as that of Miss Mathilde. Right away I felt soothed, though I allowed her to go on comforting me even after I had become quite calm; I did feel that this kindness was too effeminate, true, but I enjoyed it nonetheless and thought that I had somehow deserved it.","I could hear him pacing up and down in his room all night long, for I could not sleep either.

Suddenly my weeping eyes became cool and clear; I pressed them shut over my tears so as not to have to see anything. But the voice that now began to address me from somewhere very close by came to my face on tepid, sickly-sweet breath, and I recognized it: it was Miss Mathilde’s voice. I calmed down at once, and even when I was already perfectly calm I allowed her to go on comforting me; I could feel that this goodness was too limp, but I enjoyed it nonetheless and felt I had somehow earned it."

"Nun muß man wissen: es ging auf den Frühling zu. Der Tagwind hatte sich gelegt, die Gassen waren lang und befriedigt; an ihrem Ausgang schimmerten Häuser, neu wie frische Bruchstellen eines weißen Metalls. Aber es war ein Metall, das einen überraschte durch seine Leichtigkeit. In den breiten, fortlaufenden Straßen zogen viele Leute durcheinander, fast ohne die Wagen zu fürchten, die selten waren.

"Es ist zu bemerken, daß diese verteufelten kleinen Wagen ungemein anregende Milchglasfenster haben, hinter denen man sich die herrlichsten Agonien vor stellen kann; dafür genügt die Phantasie einer Concierge.

"Übrigens war mein Leseschlaf eines Tages so plötzlich zu Ende, wie er begonnen hatte; und da erzürnten wir einander gründlich.

"Außer einer Bautta, deren ich mich entsinne, gab es Dominos in verschiedenen Farben, es gab Frauenröcke, die hell läuteten von den Münzen, mit denen sie benäht waren; es gab Pierrots, die mir albern vorkamen, und faltige, türkische Hosen und persische Mützen, aus denen kleine Kampfersäckchen herausglitten, und Kronreifen mit dummen, ausdruckslosen Steinen. Dies alles verachtete ich ein wenig; es war von so dürftiger Unwirklichkeit und hing so abgebalgt und armsälig da und schlappte willenlos zusammen, wenn man es herauszerrte ans Licht. Was mich aber in eine Art von Rausch versetzte, das waren die geräumigen Mäntel, die Tücher, die Schals, die Schleier, alle diese nachgiebigen, großen, unverwendeten Stoffe, die weich und schmeichelnd waren oder so gleitend, daß man sie kaum zu fassen bekam, oder so leicht, daß sie wie ein Wind an einem vorbeiflogen, oder einfach schwer mit ihrer ganzen Last. In ihnen erst sah ich wirklich freie und unendlich bewegliche Möglichkeiten: eine Sklavin zu sein, die verkauft wird, oder Jeanne d'Arc zu sein oder ein alter König oder ein Zauberer; das alles hatte man jetzt in der Hand, besonders da auch Masken da waren, große drohende oder erstaunte Gesichter mit echten Bärten und vollen oder hochgezogenen Augenbrauen. Ich hatte nie Masken gesehen vorher, aber ich sah sofort ein, daß es Masken geben müsse. Ich mußte lachen, als mir einfiel, daß wir einen Hund hatten, der sich ausnahm, als trüge er eine. Ich stellte mir seine herzlichen Augen vor, die immer wie von hinten hineinsahen in das behaarte Gesicht. Ich lachte noch, während ich mich verkleidete, und ich vergaß darüber völlig, was ich eigentlich vorstellen wollte. Nun, es war neu und spannend, das erst nachträglich vor dem Spiegel zu entscheiden. Das Gesicht, das ich vorband, roch eigentümlich hohl, es legte sich fest über meines, aber ich konnte bequem durchsehen, und ich wählte erst, als die Maske schon saß, allerhand Tücher, die ich in der Art eines Turbans um den Kopf wand, so daß der Rand der Maske, der unten in einen riesigen gelben Mantel hineinreichte, auch oben und seitlich fast ganz verdeckt war. Schließlich, als ich nicht mehr konnte, hielt ich mich für hinreichend vermummt. Ich ergriff noch einen großen Stab, den ich, soweit der Arm reichte, neben mir hergehen ließ, und schleppte so, nicht ohne Mühe, aber, wie mir vorkam, voller Würde, in das Fremdenzimmer hinein auf den Spiegel zu.","Besides a bautta that I remember, there were dominoes of different colors, there were women's skirts that rang brightly from the coins with which they were sewn; there were pierrots, which struck me as silly, and rumpled Turkish trousers and Persian caps with little bags of camphor slipping out of them, and crown rings with stupid, expressionless stones. I despised all this a little; it was of such a meager unreality and hung there so battered and miserable and collapsed listlessly when you dragged it out into the light. But what got me in a kind of intoxication were the roomy coats, the shawls, the shawls, the veils, all those yielding, big, unused fabrics that were soft and flattering or so slippery you could hardly get hold of them , or so light they flew past you like the wind, or just heavy with all their burden. Only in them did I see truly free and infinitely flexible possibilities: to be a slave to be sold, or to be Joan of Arc, or an old king, or a magician; all of this was now in hand, especially since there were also masks, big menacing or astonished faces with real beards and full or raised eyebrows. I had never seen masks before, but I saw immediately that masks had to exist. I laughed when I remembered we had a dog who acted like he was carrying one. I imagined his warm eyes, which always looked like from behind into the hairy face. I was still laughing while disguising myself and I completely forgot what I was trying to present. Well, it was new and exciting to decide that after the fact in front of the mirror. The face I tied up smelled strangely hollow, it clung tightly to mine, but I could see through it easily, and only when the mask was already in place did I choose all kinds of cloths, which I wound around my head like a turban. so that the edge of the mask, which reached down into a huge yellow cloak, was also almost entirely covered at the top and sides. Eventually, when I couldn't take it anymore, I thought I was adequately disguised. I grabbed a large staff, which I let go beside me as far as my arm would reach, and dragged it, not without effort, but with dignity, I thought, into the guest room toward the mirror.","In addition to a bautta that I remember, there were dominos in various colors, women’s skirts which tinkled brightly with the coins that were sewn into them; there were Pierrot costumes, which I thought looked ridiculous, and pleated Turkish pants, and Persian fezzes, from which little sacks of camphor slipped out, and coronets with stupid, expressionless stones. All these I rather despised; they were so shabbily unreal, and hung there so stripped and wretched, and collapsed so helplessly when they were dragged out into the light. But what transported me into a kind of intoxication were the spacious cloaks, the scarves, the shawls, the veils, all those yielding, wide, unused fabrics that were so soft and caressing, or so smooth that I could hardly keep hold of them, or so light that they flew by me like a wind, or simply heavy with all their own weight. It was in them that I first saw possibilities that were free and infinitely varied : I could be a slave-girl who was about to be sold, or Joan of Arc or an old king or a wizard; all this was possible now, especially since there were also masks, enormous menacing or astonished faces with real beards and thick or upraised eyebrows. I had never seen any masks before, but I immediately understood that masks ought to exist. I had to laugh when it occurred to me that we had a dog who looked as if he wore one. I remembered his affectionate eyes, which always seemed to be looking out from behind two holes in his hairy face. I was still laughing as I put on the clothes, and in the process I completely forgot what I had intended to dress up as. All right, it was new and exciting not to decide until I was in front of the mirror. The face I tied on had a peculiarly hollow smell; it fitted closely over my own face, but I was able to see through it comfortably, and only after the mask was on did I choose all kinds of materials, which I wound around my head like a turban, in such a way that the edge of the mask, which extended downward into a gigantic yellow cloak, was almost completely hidden on top also and on the sides. Finally, when there was nothing more to add, I considered myself adequately disguised. To complete the costume, I picked up a large staff and walked it along beside me at arm’s length, and in this way, not without difficulty but, as it seemed to me, full of dignity, I trailed into the guest-room toward the mirror.","Apart from a bautta22 I remember, there were dominoes of various colours, there were ladies' skirts that tinkled lightly with the coins sewn on to them, there were Pierrots I found silly, and there were pleated Turkish trousers, and Persian caps from which little sachets of camphor slipped out, and diadems with stupid, expressionless stones. All of these I rather despised; they were of so paltry an unreality, hanging there stripped of life and wretched, and collapsing, bereft of will, whenever they were dragged out into the light. But what transported me into raptures were the sweeping cloaks, the wraps, the shawls, the veils, all those yielding, magnificent, unused materials that were soft and caressing, or so sheer that I could hardly keep hold of them, or so light that they flew by me like a wind, or simply heavy with all their own weight. It was in them that I saw, for the first time, truly free and infinitely variable possibilities: to be a slave girl and sold off, or to be Joan of Arc, or an old king, or a sorcerer; all of these I now had in my hand, the more so since there were masks as well, large threatening ones or astonished faces with real beards and thick or arched eyebrows. I had never set eyes on masks before, but I understood why there had to be masks right away. I could not help laughing when it occurred to me that we had a dog that behaved as if it were wearing one. I pictured its affectionate eyes that always seemed to be gazing from behind into a hairy face. I was still laughing as I put on the clothes, and quite forgot what I had meant to dress up as. Still, it was novel and exciting to decide only with hindsight, when I was standing in front of the mirror. The face I had tied on had a curiously hollow smell; it was a tight fit over my own face, but I could see through it comfortably; and only when the mask was properly on did I pick out a variety of scarves, which I bound about my head like a turban, so that the edge of the mask, which extended below into an immense yellow cloak, was almost entirely covered at the top and sides as well. At length, when there was no way to add anything else, I decided that I was sufficiently disguised. For good measure I picked up a big staff, which I took along with me at arm's length; and thus, not without difficulty but (I imagined) full of dignity, I trailed into the guest room and up to the mirror.","Turkish trousers and Persian fezzes out of which fell little bags of camphor, and circlets with stupid, expressionless gems in them. I despised all this a little; it was so shallow and unreal, just hanging there, flayed and wretched, drooping limply when I tugged it out into the light. But what sent me into a kind of rapture were the ample cloaks, the wraps, the veils, all the rich, yielding, unused fabrics, that were soft and flattering or slipped so smoothly that you could hardly keep hold of them, or so light that they flew past you like a breeze,* or simply weighty with their sheer heft. It was in these that I first detected truly free and infinitely flexible possibilities: to be a slave and sold, or Joan of Arc, or an old king or a sorcerer; this was all in the palm of my hand, particularly since there were also masks there, large, threatening masks, or astonished faces with genuine beards and bushy or arched eyebrows. I had never seen masks before, but I recognized at once that there had to be masks. I couldn’t help laughing when I remembered that we had a dog who behaved as if he were wearing one. I pictured his affectionate eyes, which always seemed to be looking from behind into his hairy face. I went on laughing as I dressed up, which made me completely forget what figure I was actually going to be. Now it was new and exciting not to be deciding what I was until after I was dressed, in front of the mirror. The face-mask that I tied on had a peculiar hollow smell, it fitted me tightly but I could see out easily, and it wasn’t until the mask was in place that I chose fabrics of various kinds that I wound round my head in the form of a turban, so that the edge of the mask, which reached down into an enormous yellow cloak, was also almost completely covered at the top and at the sides. And at last, when there was nothing more I could add, I decided I was adequately disguised. To finish, I took hold of a large staff, which I walked along beside me, at arm’s length, and not without difficulty, but with great dignity, as it seemed to me, I traipsed into the guest room and towards the mirror."

"Eingestellt auf die Helligkeit da oben und noch ganz begeistert für die Farben auf dem weißen Papier, vermochten meine Augen nicht das geringste unter dem Tisch zu erkennen, wo mir das Schwarze so zugeschlossen schien, daß ich bange war, daran zu stoßen. Ich verließ mich also auf mein Gefühl und kämmte, knieend und auf die linke gestützt, mit der andern Hand in dem kühlen, langhaarigen Teppich herum, der sich recht vertraulich anfühlte; nur daß kein Bleistift zu spüren war. Ich bildete mir ein, eine Menge Zeit zu verlieren, und wollte eben schon Mademoiselle anrufen und sie bitten, mir die Lampe zu halten, als ich merkte, daß für meine unwillkürlich angestrengten Augen das Dunkel nach und nach durchsichtiger wurde. Ich konnte schon hinten die Wand unterscheiden, die mit einer hellen Leiste abschloß; ich orientierte mich über die Beine des Tisches; ich erkannte vor allem meine eigene, ausgespreizte Hand, die sich ganz allein, ein bißchen wie ein Wassertier, da unten bewegte und den Grund untersuchte. Ich sah ihr, weiß ich noch, fast neugierig zu; es kam mir vor, als könnte sie Dinge, die ich sie nicht gelehrt hatte, wie sie da unten so eigenmächtig herumtastete mit Bewegungen, die ich nie an ihr beobachtet hatte. Ich verfolgte sie, wie sie vordrang, es interessierte mich, ich war auf allerhand vorbereitet. Aber wie hätte ich darauf gefaßt sein sollen, daß ihr mit einem Male aus der Wand eine andere Hand entgegenkam, eine größere, ungewöhnlich magere Hand, wie ich noch nie eine gesehen hatte.

So I trusted my intuition and, kneeling and leaning on my left hand, combed with the other hand the cool, long-haired carpet, which felt quite intimate; only that there was no trace of a pencil. I thought I was losing a lot of time and was about to call Mademoiselle and ask her to hold the lamp for me when I noticed that the darkness was gradually becoming more transparent to my involuntarily strained eyes. I could already make out the wall at the back, which ended with a light-colored ledge; I used the legs of the table for orientation; Above all, I recognized my own outstretched hand, which was moving all alone, a little like an aquatic animal, down there, examining the bottom. I watched her, I remember, almost curiously; it seemed to me that she could do things I hadn't taught her, the way she felt about down there on her own with movements I had never seen her do.

I imagined I must be losing a good deal of time and was about to call Mademoiselle and ask her to bring over the lamp for me, when I noticed that to my involuntarily adapted eyes the darkness was gradually growing more transparent. I could already distinguish the wall in back, which ended in a light-colored molding; I saw where I was in relation to the table legs; above all I recognized my own outspread hand moving down there all alone, like some strange crab, exploring the ground. I watched it, I remember, almost with curiosity; it seemed to know things I had never taught it, as it groped down there so completely on its own, with movements I had never noticed in it before. I followed it as it crept forward; it interested me; I was ready for all kinds of adventures. But how could I have been prepared to see, all at once, out of the wall, another hand coming to meet it—a larger, extraordinarily thin hand, such as I had never seen before. It came groping in a similar fashion from the other side, and the two outspread hands blindly moved toward each other.","My eyes, accustomed to the brightness above and still wholly entranced by the colours on the white paper, were unable to make out anything at all below the table, where the blackness seemed so dense that I was afraid of knocking against it; so I fell back on my sense of touch and, kneeling and supporting myself on my left hand, combed through the cool, longhaired, familiar-feeling fell with my other hand. But there was no sign of the crayon. I felt I was wasting a good deal of time, and was about to call Mademoiselle and ask her to hold the lamp for me when I realized that, as my eyes strained involuntarily, the dark was gradually growing more penetrable. Already I could distinguish the wall at the back, at the foot of which a light-coloured skirting-board ran; I took my bearings from the table legs, and in particular made out my own outspread hand, moving all alone down below, a little like some aquatic animal exploring the seabed. I still recall that I watched it almost with curiosity; as it groped about down there with a mind of its own, moving in ways I had never seen it move, it seemed able to do things I had not taught it. I observed it as it pushed onwards; I was interested, and prepared for anything.

"Denn über ihn, der sich für immer hatte verhalten wollen, kam noch einmal das anwachsende Nichtanderskönnen seines Herzens. Und diesmal hoffte er auf Erhörung. Sein ganzes, im langen Alleinsein ahnend und unbeirrbar gewordenes Wesen versprach ihm, daß jener, den er jetzt meinte, zu lieben verstünde mit durchdringender, strahlender Liebe.

"Wie alle Geräusche, die sich wiederholt durchsetzen, hatte auch dieses sich innerlich organisiert; es wandelte sich ab, es war niemals genau dasselbe.

"Wer konnte stark sein und sich des Mordes enthalten? Wer in dieser Zeit wußte nicht, daß das Äußerste unvermeidlich war? Da und dort über einen, dessen Blick untertags dem kostenden Blick seines Mörders begegnet war, kam ein seltsames Vorgefühl. Er zog sich zurück, er schloß sich ein, er schrieb das Ende seines Willens und verordnete zum Schluß die Trage aus Weidengeflecht, die Cölestinerkutte und Aschenstreu. Fremde Minstrel erschienen vor seinem Schloß, und er beschenkte sie fürstlich für ihre Stimme, die mit seinen vagen Ahnungen einig war. Im Aufblick der Hunde war Zweifel, und sie wurden weniger sicher in ihrer Aufwartung. Aus der Devise, die das ganze Leben lang gegolten hatte, trat leise ein neuer, offener Nebensinn. Manche lange Gewohnheit kam einem veraltet vor, aber es war, als bildete sich kein Ersatz mehr fur sie. Stellten sich Pläne ein, so ging man im großen mit ihnen um, ohne wirklich an sie zu glauben; dagegen griffen gewisse Erinnerungen zu einer unerwarteten Endgültigkeit. Abends, am Feuerplatz, meinte man sich ihnen zu","Who could be strong and abstain from murder? Who in that time did not know that the worst was inevitable? Here and there over one whose gaze during the day had met the savoring gaze of his murderer came a strange anticipation. He withdrew, he shut himself up, he wrote the end of his will and finally ordered the wicker stretcher, the Celestine habit and litter of ashes. Strange minstrels appeared before his castle, and he gifted them handsomely for their voice, which was at one with his vague intuitions. There was doubt in the dogs' looks, and they grew less sure of their respect. From the motto that had been valid all my life, a new, open secondary meaning quietly emerged. Many a long habit seemed obsolete, but it was as if there was no substitute for it. If plans came up, they were generally dealt with without really believing in them; on the other hand, certain memories took on an unexpected finality. In the evening, at the fire place, people thought they would join","Who in that age could be strong enough to refrain from murder? Who didn’t know that the worst was inevitable?

He would withdraw and shut himself in, would write his will, and at the end would order the litter of willow twigs, the Celestine cowl, and the strewing of ashes. Foreign minstrels appeared in front of his castle, and he gave them princely rewards for their song, which seemed to confirm his vague presentiments. The eyes of the dogs, as they looked up at him, were filled with doubt, and they grew less and less sure of his commands. From the motto that had served him all his life, a secondary meaning quietly emerged. Many long-established customs appeared antiquated, but there didn’t seem to be any substitutes to take their place.

Evenings, by the fire, you meant to abandon yourself to them.","Who could be strong and refrain from murder? Who in those times was unaware that the worst was inevitable? Every so often a strange presentiment would beset a man whose gaze had encountered, that very same day, the savouring scrutiny of his killer. He would withdraw, lock the door behind him, and write his will, concluding with orders for the litter of osier twigs, the Celestine cowl and the strewing of ashes. Foreign minstrels would appear before his castle, and he gave them princely rewards for their song, which dovetailed with his vague premonitions. When his dogs gazed up at him, there was doubt in their eyes, and they grew less assured in responding to his commands. His motto, which had served for a lifetime, subtly acquired a new and palpable secondary meaning. This or that custom, long established, now seemed antiquated, though there appeared to be no alternatives to them. If projects came up, they were largely pursued without any real conviction; certain memories, on the other hand, took on an unexpected quality of finality. In the evenings, by the fire, he felt he might surrender entirely to them.","Who could be strong and yet refrain from murder?

He withdrew, he shut himself away, he wrote the last clauses of his will and at the end ordered the litter of woven willow, the cowl of the Celestines* and the strewing of ashes. Foreign minstrels appeared at his castle and he bestowed princely rewards upon them for their singing, which closely matched his own vague apprehensions. When the dogs looked up there was doubt in their eyes, and they were less certain in their attendance. From the family motto that had served him his whole life long, there now emerged quietly and palpably a new secondary significance. Many an old custom appeared out-of-date, but it was as if no substitute now came to replace them. When plans were made, he went along with them by and large, without really believing in them; in contrast, certain memories took on an unexpected air of finality."

"Er weiß, daß diese Bewegung ihn erfüllt, weil unter den jungen Mädchen aus der Nachbarschaft die eine ist, die ihn angeht. Er hat Wünsche (nicht für sich, nein, aber für sie); für sie versteht er in einer nächtlichen Stunde, die vorübergeht, den Anspruch der Liebe. Er verspricht sich, ihr nichts davon zu sagen. Es scheint ihm das Äußerste, allein zu sein und wach und um ihretwillen zu denken, wie sehr im Recht jene Liebende war: wenn sie wußte, daß mit der Vereinigung nichts gemeint sein kann, als ein Zuwachs an Einsamkeit; wenn sie den zeitlichen Zweck des Geschlechtes durchbrach mit seiner unendlichen Absicht. Wenn sie im Dunkel der Umarmungen nicht nach Stillung grub, sondern nach Sehnsucht. Wenn sie es verachtete, daß von Zweien einer der Liebende sei und einer Geliebter, und die schwachen Geliebten, die sie sich zum Lager trug, an sich zu Liebenden glühte, die sie verließen. An solchen hohen Abschieden wurde ihr Herz zur Natur. Über dem Schicksal sang sie den firnen Lieblinginnen ihr Brautlied; erhöhte ihnen die Hochzeit; übertrieb ihnen den nahen Gemahl, damit sie sich zusammennähmen für ihn wie für einen Gott und auch noch seine Herrlichkeit","He knows that this movement fills him because among the young girls in the neighborhood there is one who concerns him. He has desires (not for himself, no, but for her); for her he understands in a passing nocturnal hour the demands of love. He promises not to tell her anything about it.

When in the darkness of the embraces she didn't dig for stillness, but for longing. When she despised the fact that of two there should be one lover and one lover, and the weak loved ones whom she carried to bed glowed with themselves as lovers who left her. At such high farewells her heart became nature.

When in the darkness of embracing she delved not for fulfillment but for greater longing. When she despised the thought that of two people one had to be the lover and one the beloved, and the frail beloved women whom she led to her couch were kindled into women in love, who left her.

"er, gegen seinen starken Willen, mehrmals den Gedanken formte, er könnte sich selbst damit tödlich sein und hinschwinden wie das Wachs am Feuer. Sein verminderter Körper wurde nur noch trockener vom Grausen und dauerhafter. Aber nun wagte man sich an den Körper seines Reichs; von Granada aus waren die Juden angestiftet worden, alle Christlichen zu vertilgen, und diesmal hatten sie sich furchtbarere Vollzieher erkauft. Niemand zweifelte, gleich auf die ersten Gerüchte hin, an dem Anschlag der Leprosen; schon hatten einzelne gesehen, wie sie Bündel ihrer schrecklichen Zersetzung in die Brunnen warfen. Es war nicht Leichtgläubigkeit, daß man dies sofort für möglich hielt; der Glaube, im Gegenteil, war so schwer geworden, daß er den Zitternden entsank und bis auf den Grund der Brunnen fiel. Und wieder hatte der eifrige Greis Gift abzuhalten vom Blute. Zur Zeit seiner abergläubischen Anwandlungen hatte er sich und seiner Umgebung das Angelus verschrieben gegen die Dämonen der Dämmerung; und nun läutete man auf der ganzen erregten Welt jeden Abend dieses kalmierende Gebet. Sonst aber glichen alle Bullen und Briefe, die von ihm ausgingen, mehr einem Gewürzwein als einer Tisane. Das Kaisertum hatte sich nicht in seine Behandlung gestellt, aber er ermüdete nicht, es mit Beweisen seines Krankseins zu","he, against his strong will, formed the thought several times that he might thereby kill himself and vanish like wax on a fire.

But now one dared to attack the body of his empire; from Granada the Jews had been instigated to exterminate all Christians, and this time they had bought themselves more terrible executors. No one doubted the lepers' attack, right from the first rumours; already some had seen them throw bundles of their terrible decomposition into the wells. It wasn't credulity that immediately suggested this; faith, on the contrary, had become so heavy that it sank from the trembling and fell to the bottom of the well. And again the eager old man had to keep poison from the blood. At the time of his superstitious impulses he had prescribed the Angelus for himself and those around him against the demons of the twilight; and now this calming prayer was rung every evening all over the excited world.

"Ich rannte davon, aber nun war er es, der rannte.

"Ältere Ruhe zu und bereute in Briefen sein Unrecht. Aber über alledem kam der Befreite nicht mehr zur Fassung. Das Jahrhundert zeigt ihn im Pilgerkleid von Kirche zu Kirche ziehen, immer wunderlichere Gelübde erfindend. Mit Amuletten behangen, flüstert er den Mönchen von Saint-Denis seine Befürchtungen zu, und in ihren Registern stand lange die hundertpfündige Wachskerze verzeichnet, die er für gut hielt, dem heiligen Ludwig zu weihen. Zu seinem eigenen Leben kam es nicht; bis an sein Ende fühlte er seines Bruders Neid und Zorn in verzerrter Konstellation über seinem Herzen. Und jener Graf von Foix, Gaston Phöbus, der in aller Bewunderung war, hatte er nicht seinen Vetter Ernault, des englischen Königs Hauptmann zu Lourdes, offen getötet? Und was war dieser deutliche Mord gegen den grauenvollen Zufall, daß er das kleine scharfe Nagelmesser nicht fortgelegt hatte, als er mit seiner berühmt schönen Hand in zuckendem Vorwurf den bloßen Hals seines liegenden Sohnes streifte?

His own life did not come about; to his end he felt his brother's envy and anger in a distorted constellation over his heart. And that Count of Foix, Gaston Phoebus, who was in the midst of all admiration, had he not openly killed his cousin Ernault, the English king's captain at Lourdes? And what was this clear murder compared to the horrible coincidence that he had not put down the little sharp nail-knife when, in twitching reproach, he grazed the bare neck of his lying son with his famously beautiful hand? The room was dark, you had to have a lamp to see the blood that had come so far and was now leaving a precious generation forever, as it oozed secretly from the tiny wound of this exhausted boy.","True, the king did intercede on behalf of the imprisoned brother and had his freedom and possessions restored to him; and the elder brother, taken up with adventures in other, distant lands, granted him peace and in his letters repented of his injustice.

And that Count of Foix, Gaston Phoebus, admired by all—hadn’t he openly killed his cousin Ernault, the English king’s captain, at Lourdes? But what was this obvious murder in comparison with the horrible accident that happened because he had forgotten to put down his sharp little pen-knife when, in quivering reproach, he reached out his famously beautiful hand to seize the naked throat of his son lying on the bed? The room was dark; lights had to be brought in to see the blood that had come from so far away and was now leaving a noble family forever, as it secretly issued from the tiny wound of this exhausted boy.","The King interceded on the ill-used brother's behalf, certainly, ensuring that his liberty and possessions were restored to him; and the elder brother, busy with other matters in faraway places, left him alone and in letters rued the injustice he had done; but the brother who had regained his freedom never recovered his peace of mind after all he had been through. The century shows him in pilgrim's apparel, going from church to church, devising vows that grew more and more peculiar. Hung about with amulets, he whispered his fears to the monks of Saint-Denis, and for a long time their inventories mentioned the hundred-pound wax candle which he thought good to dedicate to Saint Louis. He never had a life of his own; till the very end he sensed the woeful stars of his brother's envy and wrath governing over his heart.58 And that Count de Foix, Gaston Phoebus, admired of all, had he not openly killed his cousin Ernault, the English King's captain, at Lourdes? Yet what was this manifest murder compared to the horrible accident that occurred when, omitting to put down a sharp little knife that he held in his famously beautiful hand, he reached out in fitful accusation and grazed the bare throat of his son as he lay before him? The room was dark, and lights had to be brought, that the blood might be seen that had such remote origins and now was departing for ever from an exalted family, issuing secretly from the tiny wound in this exhausted boy.59","The time when one brother attacked the other brother* and kept him prisoner because he had inherited the larger share; the King intervened on behalf of the one mistreated, it is true, and offered him freedom and property; and the elder brother, engaged with the fates of others far away left him in peace and repented of his wrongdoing by letter. But after everything that had been done to him, the brother who had been freed never recovered his equanimity. The century saw him wander from church to church in a pilgrim’s habit, devising ever more fantastical pledges. Hung about with amulets, he whispered his fears to the monks of Saint-Denis and in their annals is recorded the hundred-pound wax candle that he saw fit to dedicate to Saint Louis. He never achieved a life of his own; until his end he felt his brother’s envy and anger hanging over his heart like a baleful constellation. And that Count of Foix, Gaston Phoebus, who would have been admired by all had he not openly killed his cousin Ernault,* the English King’s captain at Lourdes? And what was this manifest murder in comparison with the terrible chance that meant he had not put away the sharp little knife that he used to cut his nails when, in a convulsion of rebuke, he brushed with his famously beautiful hand against the bare neck of his son who was lying on the bed? The room was dark, a light had to be brought in order to see the blood, that went back so far and now left a noble line forever as it seeped secretly from the tiny wound on that exhausted boy."

"der letzte Schrank, den ich bisher meinte nicht öffnen zu können, eines Tages nachgab, um mir, statt bestimmter Trachten, allerhand vages Maskenzeug auszuliefern, dessen phantastisches Ungefähr mir das Blut in die Wangen trieb. Es läßt sich nicht aufzählen, was da alles war.","the last cupboard, which I thought I couldn't open until now, gave way one day so that, instead of specific costumes, I was given all sorts of vague masks, the fantastic approximation of which made my cheeks bleed. It is impossible to enumerate everything that was there.","My undoing came when the last wardrobe, which I hadn’t been able to open before, yielded one day, furnishing me with, not specific costumes, but all kinds of random paraphernalia for masquerades, whose fantastic possibilities made my head spin. There is no way to describe everything I found there.","All that remained to complete my undoing was that one day the final wardrobe, which I had so far thought I could not open, yielded and offered me up, not particular costumes, but all manner of odd stuff for masquerades, the fantastic possibilities of which had the blood rushing to my cheeks. It is impossible to tell of all the things that were there.","I was unable to open, yielded one day, to provide me not with particular costumes but all sorts of vaguely carnivalesque stuff for dressing up, whose scope for fantastic imaginings made my cheeks flush. I couldn’t possibly tell you everything that was in there, but apart from a bautta that I remember, there were dominos* of various colours, there were women’s skirts, tinkling brightly with the coins sewn into them; there were Pierrot costumes, which I thought were silly, and baggy"
"Wenn ich nach Hause denke, wo nun niemand mehr ist, dann glaube ich, das muß früher anders gewesen sein. Früher wußte man (oder vielleicht man ahnte es), daß man den Tod in sich hatte wie die Frucht den Kern. Die Kinder hatten einen kleinen in sich und die Erwachsenen einen großen. Die Frauen hatten ihn im Schooß und die Männer in der Brust. Den hatte man, und das gab einem eine eigentümliche Würde und einen stillen Stolz.","When I think back home, where there is no one anymore, I think it must have been different in the past. In the past one knew (or perhaps one suspected) that one had death in oneself like the fruit has the pit. The children had a little one in them and the adults a big one. The women had it in their laps and the men in their chests. You had it, and that gave you a peculiar dignity and a quiet pride.","When I think back to my home, where there is no one left now, it always seems to me that things must have been different back then. Then, you knew (or perhaps you sensed it) that you had your death inside you as a fruit has its core. The children had a small one in them and the grownups a large one. The women had it in their womb and the men in their chest. You had it, and that gave you a strange dignity and a quiet pride.","If I think of home, where there is no one any more, I have a feeling that at one time it must have been different. In the old days, people knew (or perhaps had an intuition) that they bore their death within them like the stone within a fruit. Children had a small one within and adults a large one. Women bore theirs in the womb and men theirs in their breast. It was something people quite simply had, and the possession conferred a peculiar dignity, and a tranquil pride.","When I think about home, where there is no one left any more, then I think it must previously have been different. Previously you knew (or perhaps sensed) that you had your death within you, as the fruit contains its kernel. Children had a small one inside, and adults a large one. Women had it in their womb, and men in their chest. You had it, and it gave you a peculiar kind of dignity and a quiet pride."
"Er lachte und hob mir den Kopf, bis wir einander in die Augen sahen: 'Du hast ausgezeichnete Zähne', sagte er, 'Zähne, die etwas unternehmen...'--Ich aber merkte mir seine Augen. Ich bin später da und dort herumgekommen. Ich habe allerhand Augen gesehen, kannst du mir glauben: solche nicht wieder. Für diese Augen hätte nichts da sein müssen, die hattens in sich.","He laughed and lifted my head until we were looking into each other's eyes: 'You have excellent teeth,' he said, 'teeth that do something...'--But I remembered his eyes. I later got around here and there. I've seen all sorts of eyes, believe me: not like that again. Nothing should have been there for these eyes, they had it all.","He laughed and tilted my chin until we were looking into each other’s eyes. ‘You have excellent teeth,’ he said, ‘teeth that are willing to attempt something …’ But I was looking at his eyes. I have traveled around quite a bit since then. I have seen all sorts of eyes; but believe me, I never again saw any like his. For those eyes a thing didn’t need to be present; they contained it inside them.","“You have excellent teeth,” he said, “teeth that show enterprise…” – For my part, I noticed his eyes. In later life I got around, and I have seen all sorts of eyes, believe me, but never again eyes like his. For those eyes, things did not need to exist; they already contained everything within themselves.","He laughed and lifted my head up until we were eye-to-eye: “You have excellent teeth,” he said, “teeth with determination …”— But I took note of his eyes. I’ve been around a bit since then. I’ve seen all sorts of eyes, take my word for it, but never again eyes like his. What those eyes could see didn’t need to be there, it was already within them."
"Frau Margarete Brigge war immer schon, soweit ich denken kann, eine hochgewachsene, unzugängliche Greisin. Ich kann mir nicht anders vorstellen, als daß sie viel älter gewesen sei, als der Kammerherr. Sie lebte mitten unter uns ihr Leben, ohne auf jemanden Rücksicht zu nehmen. Sie war auf keinen von uns angewiesen und hatte immer eine Art Gesellschafterin, eine alternde Komtesse Oxe, um sich, die sie sich durch ihrgendeine Wohltat unbegrenzt verpflichtet hatte. Dies mußte eine einzelne Ausnahme gewesen sein, denn wohltun war sonst nicht ihre Art. Sie liebte keine Kinder, und Tiere durften nicht in ihre Nähe. Ich weiß nicht, ob sie sonst etwas liebte. Es wurde erzählt, daß sie als ganz junges Mädchen dem schönen Felix Lichnowski verlobt gewesen sei, der dann in Frankfurt so grausam ums Leben kam. Und in der Tat war nach ihrem Tode ein Bildnis des Fürsten da, das, wenn ich nicht irre, an die Familie zurückgegeben worden ist. Vielleicht, denke ich mir jetzt, versäumte sie über diesem eingezogenen ländlichen Leben, das das Leben auf Ulsgaard von Jahr zu Jahr mehr geworden war, ein anderes, glänzendes: ihr natürliches. Es ist schwer zu sagen, ob sie es betrauerte. Vielleicht verachtete sie es dafür, daß es nicht gekommen war, daß es die Gelegenheit verfehlt hatte, mit Geschick und Talent gelebt worden zu sein. Sie hatte alles dies so weit in sich hineingenommen und hatte darüber Schalen angesetzt, viele, spröde, ein wenig metallisch glänzende Schalen, deren jeweilig oberste sich neu und kühl ausnahm. Bisweilen freilich verriet sie sich doch durch eine naive Ungeduld, nicht genügend beachtet zu sein; zu meiner Zeit konnte sie sich dann bei Tische plötzlich verschlucken auf irgendeine deutliche und komplizierte Art, die ihr die Teilnahme aller sicherte und sie, für einen Augenblick wenigstens, so sensationell und spannend erscheinen ließ, wie sie es im Großen hätte sein mögen. Indessen vermute ich, daß mein Vater der einzige war, der diese viel zu häufigen Zufälle ernst nahm. Er sah ihr, höflich vorübergeneigt, zu, man konnte merken, wie er ihr in Gedanken seine eigene, ordentliche Luftröhre gleichsam anbot und ganz zur Verfügung stellte. Der Kammerherr hatte natürlich gleichfalls zu essen aufgehört; er nahm einen kleinen Schluck Wein und enthielt sich jeder Meinung.","Frau Margarete Brigge was always, as far as I can remember, a tall, inaccessible old woman. I can't imagine that she was much older than the Chamberlain. She lived her life in the midst of us, paying no attention to anyone. She was not dependent on any of us and always had a kind of companion around her, an aging Countess Oxe, to whom she had bound herself indefinitely through her kindness. This must have been an exception, because doing good was not her style. She did not love children, and animals were not allowed near her. I don't know if she loved anything else. It was said that as a very young girl she was engaged to the beautiful Felix Lichnowski, who died so cruelly in Frankfurt. And indeed, after her death there was a portrait of the prince which, if I am not mistaken, was returned to the family. Perhaps, I think to myself now, in this withdrawn rural life, which life on Ulsgaard had grown from year to year, she was missing out on another, brilliant one: her natural life. It's hard to say if she mourned it. Perhaps she despised it for not having come, for missing the opportunity to have been lived with skill and talent. She had taken all of this into herself and had placed shells over it, many brittle shells with a slightly metallic sheen, the top one of which looked new and cool. At times, of course, through a naive impatience she betrayed that she had not been sufficiently noticed; in my day she could suddenly choke at the table in some distinct and complicated way that secured her the sympathy of all and made her appear, for a moment at least, as sensational and exciting as she might have been on a grand scale. However, I suspect that my father was the only one who took these all-too-common coincidences seriously. Leaning politely over, he watched her, you could tell how in his mind he was offering her his own neat windpipe and making it entirely available to her. The Chamberlain, of course, had also stopped eating; he took a small sip of wine and refrained from any opinion.","Mrs. Margarete Brigge had always been, as far back as I can remember, a tall, unapproachable old woman. I can’t picture her except as much older than the Chamberlain. She lived her life in our midst, without caring for anyone. She wasn’t dependent on any of us, and always had with her a kind of lady-companion, the aging Countess Oxe, whom through some favor or other she had placed under a boundless obligation. This must have been an extraordinary exception in her life; she wasn’t known for her favors. She didn’t like children, and animals weren’t allowed near her. I don’t know whether there was anything she did like. It was said that as a very young girl she had been engaged to the handsome Felix Lichnowsky, who came to so cruel an end at Frankfurt. And indeed, after her death, among her belongings a portrait of the prince was found, which, if I am not mistaken, was returned to his family. I now think that perhaps, through this retired country existence, which living at Ulsgaard more and more became over the years, she had missed another, brilliant life, the one that nature had intended her for. It’s hard to say whether she regretted this. Perhaps she despised it for not coming, for missing the opportunity of being lived with skill and talent. She had taken all this so deeply inside herself and had covered it with shells, many hard, brilliant, slightly metallic shells, and the layer that was for the moment on top always looked cool and new. Now and then, though, by her naive impatience she betrayed a feeling that people weren’t paying enough attention to her. I can remember her at table suddenly choking, in some obvious and complicated way that assured her of everyone’s concern and made her appear, for a few moments at least, as sensational and fascinating as she would have liked to be in general. But I suspect that my father was the only one who took these much-too-frequent accidents seriously. He would watch her, politely bending forward, and you could see how, in thought, he was offering her his own, normally-functioning windpipe, placing it completely at her disposal. Of course the Chamberlain too had stopped eating; he took a little sip of wine and refrained from making a comment.","Mistress Margarete Brigge had always been, as far back as I can remember, a tall, unapproachable old lady. I can only imagine that she must have been much older than the Chamberlain. In our very midst she lived her own life, without any consideration for anyone. She depended on none of us, and always had with her a sort of lady companion, the ageing Countess Oxe, whom she had placed under a limitless obligation by some favour or other. This must have been an exception, since good deeds were not normally in character. She was not fond of children, and did not suffer animals to come near her. I do not know whether she had an affection for anything else. The story went that as a very young girl she had been engaged to Prince Felix Lichnowski, that handsome man who so cruelly lost his life in Frankfurt.26 And after her death a portrait of the Prince was indeed found among her belongings, and returned to his family, if I am not mistaken. I now think that perhaps, in leading that retired country existence which life at Ulsgaard increasingly became as the years went by, she failed to live another life, a radiant life that was by nature hers. It is hard to say whether she lamented it. She may have despised it for not coming her way, for missing the opportunity of being lived with such talent and panache. She had buried all of this deep within her, and had covered it with carapaces, a large number of brittle carapaces with a faintly metallic sheen, the uppermost of which would always seem new and cool. At times, it is true, she did give herself away, by a naïve impatience at not being paid sufficient attention; in my day, she would suddenly choke at table in some patent and complicated way that guaranteed her the sympathy of all present and, at least for a moment, made her appear as sensational and fascinating as she would have liked to appear on a larger stage. Looking back, I suspect that my father was the only one who took these much-too-frequent accidents seriously. He would watch her, courteously inclining his head, and you could tell that he was mentally offering her his own fully operative windpipe, as it were, and placing it entirely at her disposal. The Chamberlain had of course likewise stopped eating; he took a sip of wine and voiced no opinion whatsoever.","Mistress Margarete Brigge had always been, as far as I remember, a tall, unapproachable old woman. I can only imagine her as having been much older than the Chamberlain. She lived her life amongst us without consideration for anyone else. She was not reliant upon any of us and was always accompanied by a kind of companion, the ageing Countess Oxe,* who had been rendered infinitely beholden to her by some benefaction or other. This must have been uniquely exceptional, since doing good was not Margarete Brigge’s style. She didn’t like children, and animals were not permitted anywhere near her. I don’t know whether she felt any other forms of affection. There was a story that as quite a young girl she had been betrothed to handsome Prince Lichnowsky,* who met his end in Frankfurt in such a terrible manner. And indeed, after her death, a portrait of the Prince was found amongst her possessions, and, if I’m not mistaken, returned to his family. I now wonder whether perhaps leading this detached rural life—which is what life in Ulsgaard had become in the course of the years—meant that she had missed out on another, brilliant life, one more truly her own. It’s hard to say whether she mourned its loss. Perhaps she despised it because it had not come about, because it had missed its opportunity to be lived with skill and flair. She had absorbed all this deeply within herself and allowed skins to form over it, many brittle skins that had a slightly metallic gleam, and whose outer layer appeared cool and new. Admittedly, from time to time her naive impatience betrayed how she felt she was afforded insufficient consideration; during my time this meant she sometimes choked whilst at table, in a conspicuous and complicated manner designed to ensure the concern of everyone present, and which, for a moment at least, made her seem as sensational and enthralling as she might otherwise have been in the grander scheme of things. I now suspect that my father was the only one to take these far-too-frequent incidents at all seriously. He watched her, leaning forward politely, and you could see how it was as if, in his mind, he was offering to place at her disposal his own fully functioning tracheal airways. The Chamberlain had stopped eating at once, of course; he took a sip of wine and kept his own counsel."
"Mein Vater, gleichsam um mein Benehmen zu verdecken, fragte mit seiner breiten gedämpften Stimme: ""Ist Mathilde krank?"" Der Großvater lächelte in seiner Art und antwortete dann mit einem Satze, auf den ich, mit mir selber beschäftigt, nicht achtgab und der etwa lautete: Nein, sie wünscht nur, Christinen nicht zu begegnen. Ich sah es also auch nicht als Wirkung dieser Worte an, daß mein Nachbar, der braune Major, sich erhob und, mit einer undeutlich gemurmelten Entschuldigung und einer Verbeugung gegen den Grafen hin, den Saal verließ. Es fiel mir nur auf, daß er sich hinter dem Rücken des Hausherrn in der Tür nochmals umdrehte und dem kleinen Erik und zu meinem größten Erstaunen plötzlich auch mir winkende und nickende Zeichen machte, als forderte er uns auf, ihm zu folgen. Ich war so überrascht, daß mein Lachen aufhörte, mich zu bedrängen. Im übrigen schenkte ich dem Major weiter keine Aufmerksamkeit; er war mir unangenehm, und ich bemerkte auch, daß der kleine Erik ihn nicht beachtete.","My father, as if to cover up my behavior, asked in his broad, muffled voice: ""Is Mathilde ill?"" Grandfather smiled in his own way and then answered with a sentence which I paid no attention to, being busy with myself, and which went something like: No, she only wishes not to meet Christine. So I didn't see it as an effect of these words that my neighbor, the brown Major, got up and left the hall with an indistinctly mumbled apology and a bow to the Count. The only thing I noticed was that behind the back of the master of the house he turned around again in the doorway and, to my great astonishment, suddenly made waving and nodding signs to little Erik and to me as well, as if he were asking us to follow him. I was so surprised that my laughter stopped bothering me. For the rest, I paid no further attention to the Major; I didn't like him, and I also noticed that little Erik wasn't paying any attention to him.","My father, as if to divert attention from my bad manners, asked, in his broad, muffled voice: “Is Mathilde sick?” Grandfather smiled his peculiar smile and then answered with a sentence which, occupied as I was with myself, I paid no attention to, but which sounded something like: No, she merely does not wish to meet Christine. Nor did I realize, therefore, that it was these words which made my uncle, the brown-faced major, get up and, with a mumbled apology and a bow in the Count’s direction, leave the room. It only struck me that he turned around again at the door, behind my grandfather’s back, and began waving and nodding to Erik and suddenly (to my utter amazement) to me as well, as if he were urging us to follow him. I was so surprised that my laughter stopped. Beyond that, I paid no further attention to the major; I found him unpleasant, and I saw that Erik took no notice of him either.","My father, as if to cover for my conduct, enquired in his full but muted tones: ‘Is Mathilde unwell?’ Grandfather smiled in that way of his and replied with a comment – to which, being taken up with myself, I paid no attention – roughly to this effect: No, she simply does not wish to meet Christine. Nor did I grasp that it was in response to these words that my neighbour, the tanned major, rose and, with an indistinct murmur of excuses and a bow to the master of the house, left the room. I did notice, however, that he turned once more in the doorway, behind the Count's back, and beckoned and nodded to little Erik and suddenly, to my great astonishment, signalled to me as well, as if he wanted us to follow him. I was so surprised that my laughter ceased to trouble me. For the rest, I paid no further attention to the major; I found him unpleasant, and I noted that little Erik took no notice of him either.","My father, as if to cover up my behaviour, asked in his broad, subdued voice, ‘Is Mathilde ill?’ My grandfather smiled in his particular way and then answered in a phrase that I was too taken up with myself to pay attention to, but which was roughly: No, she just doesn’t want to meet Christine. So I didn’t see it as the consequence of these words that my neighbour at table, the brown Major, stood up, and with an indistinctly murmured apology and a bow in the direction of the master of the house, left the room. My attention was only caught by the fact that, behind the Count’s back, he turned round in the doorway and made nods and waves to little Erik and, to my great astonishment, to me suddenly as well, as if he were calling on us to follow him. I was so surprised that my laughter ceased to beleaguer me. For the rest, I paid no more attention to the Major; I didn’t like him and I noticed that little Erik didn’t take much notice of him either."

Denn wir waren einig darüber, daß wir Märchen nicht liebten. Wir hatten einen anderen Begriff vom Wunderbaren. Wir fanden, wenn alles mit natürlichen Dingen zuginge, so wäre das immer am wunderbarsten. Wir gaben nicht viel darauf, durch die Luft zu fliegen, die Feen enttäuschten uns, und von den Verwandlungen in etwas anderes erwarteten wir uns nur eine sehr oberflächliche Abwechslung. Aber wir lasen doch ein bißchen, um beschäftigt auszusehen; es war uns nicht angenehm, wenn irgend jemand eintrat, erst erklären zu müssen, was wir gerade taten; besonders Vater gegenüber waren wir von einer übertriebenen Deutlichkeit.","When Maman came for half an hour and read fairy tales (Sieversen was there for the right, long reading), it wasn't for the sake of the fairy tales. Because we agreed that we didn't love fairy tales. We had a different concept of the miraculous. We found that when everything was done with natural things, that was always the most wonderful. We didn't give much importance to flying through the air, the fairies disappointed us, and we only expected a very superficial change from the transformations into something else. But we read a little to look busy; we didn't like it when anyone came in, having to first explain what we were doing; we were exaggeratedly explicit, especially towards father.","When Maman sometimes came for a half hour and read me fairy tales (the real readings, the long ones, Sieversen did), it wasn’t for the sake of the stories. For we agreed that we didn’t like fairy tales. We had a different conception of the marvelous. We found that things which happened in a totally natural manner were always the most marvelous of all. We didn’t think much of flying through the air; fairies disappointed us; and when we read about magical transformations we didn’t expect anything but a very superficial change. But we did read a little, so that we would look occupied; it was unpleasant for us, when anyone came in, to have to explain what we were doing; especially toward Father, we were exaggeratedly explicit.","At times, when Maman came for half an hour to read me fairy tales (proper reading, for longer times, was Sieversen's task), it was not for the sake of the stories. We were in agreement that we did not care for fairy tales. Our idea of what was wondrous was a different one. We felt that the most wondrous thing of all was when things happened perfectly naturally. We were unimpressed by flying through the air; fairies disappointed us; and when things were transformed into something else, we had no expectation of anything but the most superficial of changes. But still we read a little, to appear occupied; we did not think it pleasant to have to explain what we were doing when someone came in, and towards Father in particular we made things exceedingly self-explanatory.","When Maman came for half an hour and read me fairy-tales (proper reading aloud, taking a long time, was Sieversen’s job), it wasn’t because of the fairy-tales themselves, for we were in agreement that we didn’t like fairy-tales. We had a different notion of the fantastic. We found that it was most fantastic when things just happened in the natural way. We didn’t set much store by flying through the air, we were disappointed by the fairies, and we anticipated only a superficial alteration when things were transformed into something else. But we read a little so as to look busy; when someone came in we didn’t much like having to explain what we were doing; we were exaggeratedly specific when explaining to Father."

"Ich will nichts erzählen von dir, Abelone. Nicht deshalb, weil wir einander täuschten: weil du Einen liebtest, auch damals, den du nie vergessen hast, Liebende, und ich: alle Frauen; sondern weil mit dem Sagen nur unrecht geschieht.","I don't want to talk about you, Abelone. Not because we deceived each other: because you loved one, even then, whom you never forgot, lover, and I: all women; but because saying only does wrong.","I won’t tell anything about you, Abelone. Not because we deceived each other—since even then you loved someone whom you have never forgotten, and I loved all women—but because only wrong is done in the saying.","I shall not tell anything about you, Abelone.

"Ganz erhalten ist in meinem Herzen, so scheint es mir, nur jener Saal, in dem wir uns zum Mittagessen zu versammeln pflegten, jeden Abend um sieben Uhr. Ich habe diesen Raum niemals bei Tage gesehen, ich erinnere mich nicht einmal, ob er Fenster hatte und wohin sie aussahen; jedes mal, so oft die Familie eintrat, brannten die Kerzen in den schweren Armleuchtern, und man vergaß in einigen Minuten die Tageszeit und alles, was man draußen gesehen hatte. Dieser hohe, wie ich vermute, gewölbte Raum war stärker als alles; er saugte mit seiner dunkelnden Höhe, mit seinen niemals ganz aufgeklärten Ecken alle Bilder aus einem heraus, ohne einem einen bestimmten Ersatz dafür zu geben. Man saß da wie aufgelöst; völlig ohne Willen, ohne Besinnung, ohne Lust, ohne Abwehr. Man war wie eine leere Stelle. Ich erinnere mich, daß dieser vernichtende Zustand mir zuerst fast Übelkeit verursachte, eine Art Seekrankheit, die ich nur dadurch überwand, daß ich mein Bein ausstreckte, bis ich mit dem Fuß das Knie meines Vaters berührte, der mir gegenübersaß. Erst später fiel es mir auf, daß er dieses merkwürdige Benehmen zu begreifen oder doch zu dulden schien, obwohl zwischen uns ein fast kühles Verhältnis bestand, aus dem ein solches Gebaren nicht erklärlich war. Es war indessen jene leise Berührung, welche mir die Kraft gab, die langen Mahlzeiten auszuhalten. Und nach einigen Wochen krampfhaften Ertragens hatte ich, mit der fast unbegrenzten Anpasssung des Kindes, mich so sehr an das Unheimliche jener Zusammenkünfte gewöhnt, daß es mich keine Anstrengung mehr kostete, zwei Stunden bei Tische zu sitzen; jetzt vergingen sie sogar verhältnismäßig schnell, weil ich mich damit beschäftigte, die Anwesenden zu beobachten.","It seems to me that only the room where we used to gather for lunch, every evening at seven o'clock, is intact in my heart. I've never seen this room by day, I don't even remember if it had windows or where they looked; every time the family entered, the candles burned in the heavy candelabra, and in a few minutes one forgot the time of day and everything one had seen outside. This high, I suppose, vaulted room was stronger than all; it sucked all the images out of you with its darkening heights, with its corners that were never completely cleared up, without giving you a specific substitute for them. One sat there as if dissolved; completely without will, without reflection, without desire, without defense. One was like an empty space. I remember that at first this devastating condition made me almost nauseous, a kind of seasickness which I only got over by stretching my leg out until my foot touched my father's knee, who was sitting across from me. Only later did it strike me that he seemed to understand or at least tolerate this strange behavior, although there was an almost cold relationship between us, from which such behavior could not be explained. However, it was that gentle touch that gave me the strength to endure the long meals. And after a few weeks of convulsive endurance I had, with the child's almost unlimited adaptation, become so accustomed to the uncanniness of those gatherings that it no longer cost me an effort to sit at table for two hours; now they even passed relatively quickly because I was busy observing those present.","The only area that has remained complete in my heart, I think, is the banquet-hall where we used to assemble for dinner every evening at seven o’clock. I never saw this room by day; I can’t even remember if it had windows or where they faced. Whenever the family entered, the candles would be burning in the heavy branched candlesticks, and in a few minutes you forgot the time of day and everything you had seen outside. This high and, I suspect, vaulted room was more powerful than everything else. With its darkening height and its never fully illuminated corners, it sucked all images out of you, without giving you anything definite in return. You sat there as if you had disintegrated—totally without will, without consciousness, without pleasure, without defense. You were like an empty space. I remember that at first this state of annihilation almost made me feel nauseated; it brought on a kind of seasickness, which I only overcame by stretching out my leg until my foot touched the knee of my father, who was sitting opposite me. It didn’t strike me until later that he seemed to understand this strange gesture, or anyway seemed to tolerate it, although between us there was an almost cool relationship, which wouldn’t have accounted for such behavior. Nevertheless, it was that slight contact which gave me the strength to sit through the long meal. And after a few weeks of tensed endurance, I had, with a child’s almost limitless adaptability, gotten so very used to the eeriness of those gatherings that it no longer cost me any effort to sit at table for two hours; now the time even passed more or less quickly, because I was busy observing the dinner-guests.","All that has been preserved in my heart in its entirety, it seems to me, is the dining hall where we met for dinner every evening at seven. I never saw that room by day, and do not even recall whether it had any windows or what they looked out on; every time the family entered, the candles would be burning in the heavy chandeliers and within minutes one no longer knew what time of day it was and forgot everything one had seen outside. That lofty room, which I take to have been vaulted, was altogether overwhelming; with its darkness deepening on high, and its corners never fully lit, it drained one of images without giving any particular recompense in return. One sat there feeling void, utterly bereft of will, thought, desire or resistance. One was like an empty space. I remember that at first this annihilating state almost made me nauseous, bringing on a sort of seasickness which I could only dispel by stretching out a leg till I touched the knee of my father, who was sitting opposite me, with my foot. Only later did it strike me that he seemed to understand, or at least put up with, this odd behaviour, despite the fact that our relationship was almost cool and a gesture of this kind normally had no place in it. At all events, it was that light touch that gave me the strength to get through those long meals. And after a few weeks of tense endurance, I had grown so used to the unsettling atmosphere of those gatherings, with the well-nigh endless adaptability of a child, that it no longer cost me any effort to sit at table for two hours; now, indeed, the time passed relatively quickly, because I kept myself occupied observing the others present.","The only part retained intact in my heart, it seems to me, is the room in which we used to gather for dinner every evening at seven. I have never seen this room during daylight hours; I can’t even remember whether it had windows or what they looked onto. Every time the family entered the room, the candles were already burning in the heavy candelabra, and within a few minutes you’d forgotten what time of day it was and everything you’d seen outside. This high room, vaulted I imagine, overwhelmed everything; with its highest points lost in deepening darkness and its furthest corners never completely illuminated, it sucked every last image out of you without leaving anything specific in exchange. You sat there as if liquefied, wholly without will-power, without the capacity to reflect, without desire, without resistance. You were like blank space. I remember that at first this devastating condition almost brought on a feeling of nausea, a kind of seasickness, which I could only overcome by stretching out my leg until my foot touched my father’s knee opposite. It only occurred to me later that he seemed to understand, or at least to tolerate this peculiar behaviour, even though our relationship was almost what you might call cool, not one likely to accommodate conduct of this kind. But it was that gentle touch of the foot on his knee that gave me the strength to get through the long dinners. And after a few weeks of tense endurance, the child’s almost limitless ability to adapt to circumstances meant that I’d become so accustomed to the uncanny atmosphere on those occasions that I no longer had to make any effort at all to sit at table for two hours; the time even passed relatively quickly because I spent it observing the people present."

"Selbst in der Zeit, da die Armut ihn täglich mit neuen Härten erschreckte, da sein Kopf das Lieblingsding des Elends war und ganz abgegriffen, da sich überall an seinem Leibe Geschwüre aufschlugen wie Notaugen gegen die Schwärze der Heimsuchung, da ihm graute vor dem Unrat, auf dem man ihn verlassen hatte, weil er seinesgleichen war: selbst da noch, wenn er sich besann, war es sein größestes Entsetzen, erwidert worden zu sein. Was waren alle Finsternisse seither gegen die dichte Traurigkeit jener Umarmungen, in denen sich alles verlor. Wachte man nicht auf mit dem Gefühl, ohne Zukunft zu sein? Ging man nicht sinnlos umher ohne Anrecht auf alle Gefahr? Hatte man nicht hundertmal versprechen müssen, nicht zu sterben? Vielleicht war es der Eigensinn dieser argen Erinnerung, die sich von Wiederkunft zu Wiederkunft eine Stelle erhalten wollte, was sein Leben unter den Abfällen währen ließ.","Even at a time when poverty terrified him daily with new hardships, when his head was the favorite thing of misery and was worn out, when boils opened all over his body like emergency eyes against the blackness of the affliction, when he dreaded the filth, on which he had been left because he was his equal: even then, when he thought about it, his greatest horror was that he had been returned. What has all the darkness been since then compared to the dense sadness of those embraces in which everything was lost. Didn't you wake up with the feeling of being without a future? Didn't one go about senselessly without a right to all danger? Hadn't one had to promise a hundred times not to die? Perhaps it was the attachment of this evil memory, wanting to keep a place from second coming to second coming, that made him live among the refuse.","Even during the time when poverty terrified him every day with new hardships, when his head was the favorite toy of misery, and utterly worn ragged by it, when ulcers broke out all over his body like emergency eyes against the blackness of tribulation, when he shuddered at the filth to which he had been abandoned because he was just as foul himself: even then, when he thought about it, his greatest terror was that someone would respond to him. What were all the darknesses of that time, compared to the thick sorrow of those embraces in which everything was lost? Didn’t you wake up feeling that you had no future? Didn’t you walk around drained of all meaning, without the right to even the slightest danger? Didn’t you have to promise, a hundred times, not to die? Perhaps it was the stubbornness of this most painful memory, which wanted to reserve a place in him to return to again and again, that allowed him, amid the dunghills, to continue living.","Even during the time when poverty was alarming him with new hardships daily, when his head was the favourite plaything of misery and quite worn out, when ulcers were opening all over his body like emergency eyes against the blackness of tribulation, when he was horrified by the filth in which he had been abandoned as a thing just as filthy – even then, if he thought about it, his greatest horror was that his love might have been returned. What were all the dark hours he had been through since, compared to the deep sadness of those embraces in which all was lost? Did he not wake with a sense that he had no future? Did he not go about meaninglessly, with no right to the slightest of dangers? Had he not had to promise a hundred times not to die? Perhaps it was the obduracy of that bitter memory, which returned to him again and again and insisted on its place, that kept him alive amid the refuse.","Even at the time when poverty terrified him daily with new hardships, when his head was the preferred plaything of misery and quite worn out, when his body was covered with sores that broke out like emergency eyes to guard against the blackness of affliction, when he was revolted by the filth to which he had been abandoned because he was of a kind with it: even then, when he thought about it, his greatest horror was to be answered.

Did he not walk around mindlessly with no right to be exposed to any danger? Had he not had to promise a hundred times that he would not die? Perhaps it was the obstinate aim of this terrible memory, as it recurred and recurred, to help retain a place that would permit his life amongst the filth to endure."
"Und jetzt auch noch diese Krankheit, die mich immer schon so eigentümlich berührt hat. Ich bin sicher, daß man sie unterschätzt. Genau wie man die Bedeutung anderer Krankheiten übertreibt.

"Ich wußte damals nichts von ihrer Geschichte. Ich wußte nicht, daß sie vor langer, langer Zeit in ihrem zweiten Kindbett gestorben war, einen Knaben gebährend, der zu einem bangen und grausamen Schicksal heranwuchs,--ich wußte nicht, daß sie eine Gestorbene war. Aber mein Vater wußte es. Hatte er, der leidenschaftlich war und auf Konsequenz und Klarheit angelegt, sich zwingen wollen, in Fassung und ohne zu fragen, dieses Abenteuer auszuhalten?

"österreichischen Spiritisten unterhielt, der sich Baron Nolde nannte und dem sie vollkommen ergeben war, so daß sie nicht das geringste unternahm, ohne vorher seine Zustimmung oder vielmehr etwas wie seinen Segen einzuholen. Sie war zu jener Zeit außerordentlich stark, von einer weichen, trägen Fülle, die gleichsam achtlos in ihre losen, hellen Kleider hineingegossen war; ihre Bewegungen waren müde und unbestimmt, und ihre Augen flossen beständig über.

"Der Arzt hat mich nicht verstanden. Nichts. Es war ja auch schwer zu erzählen. Man wollte einen Versuch machen mit dem Elektrisieren. Gut. Ich bekam einen Zettel: ich sollte um ein Uhr in der Salpêtrère sein. Ich war dort. Ich mußte lange an verschiedenen Baracken vorüber, durch mehrere Höfe gehen, in denen da und dort Leute mit weißen Hauben wie Sträflinge unter den leeren Bäumen standen. Endlich kam ich in einen langen, dunklen, gangartigen Raum, der auf der einen Seite vier Fenster aus mattem, grünlichem Glase hatte, eines vom anderen durch eine breite, schwarze Zwischenwand getrennt. Davor lief eine Holzbank hin, an allem vorbei, und auf dieser Bank saßen sie, die mich kannten, und warteten. Ja, sie waren alle da. Als ich mich an die Dämmerung des Raumes gewöhnt hatte, merkte ich, daß unter denen, welche Schulter an Schulter in endloser Reihe dasaßen, auch einige andere Leute sein konnten, kleine Leute, Handwerker, Bedienernnen und Lastkutscher. Unten an der Schmalseite des Ganges auf besonderen Stühlen hatten sich zwei dicke Frauen ausgebreitet, die sich unterhielten, vermutlich Conciergen.

In front of it ran a wooden bench, past everything, and on this bench those who knew me sat and waited. Yes, they were all there. As I got used to the twilight of the room, I noticed that among those who sat shoulder to shoulder in an endless line, there could also be a few other people, little people, artisans, waitresses, and cart drivers.

Finally I entered a long, dark, corridor-like room, which had four windows on one side, made of a dull, greenish glass and separated from one another by an expanse of black wall. There was a wooden bench in front, along the whole length of the wall, and on this bench they were sitting and waiting. Yes, they were all there, and they knew me. When I had gotten used to the dim lighting, I noticed that among these people sitting shoulder to shoulder on an endless line, there were also a few others, insignificant people, artisans, housemaids, teamsters.

Und in dir ist beinah kein Raum; und fast stillt es dich, daß in dieser Engheit in dir unmöglich sehr Großes sich aufhalten kann; daß","Beware of the light that makes space more hollow; don't look around, lest a shadow stand up behind you, like your master.

It would have been better, perhaps, if you had stayed in the darkness, and your heart, without any limits, had tried to be the heavy heart of everything indistinguishable. Now you have pulled yourself together; you see yourself end in your own hands; from time to time, with an imprecise movement, you re-draw the outline of your face.

Now you have gathered yourself up; you see your own end before you, in your own hands; every now and then, with an imprecise movement, you trace the contours of your face. And within you there is scarcely any room; and it almost calms you, to think that it is impossible for anything of any great size to abide in those cramped confines, that even something quite monstrous must needs become an inner thing and accept the limits imposed by circumstance.","Be on your guard against the light, which makes space more hollow; do not look round in case there is perhaps a shadow standing up behind you as you sit up, like your master.

"Zoë setzte sich zu mir und stellte mir Fragen. Sie hatte ein gutgeordnetes Gesicht, in dem sich das Einsehen von Zeit zu Zeit erneute, als sähe sie beständig etwas ein. Mein Vater saß etwas nach rechts geneigt und hörte der Marchesin zu, die lachte. Graf Schulin stand zwischen Maman und seiner Frau und erzählte etwas. Aber die Gräfin unterbrach ihn, sah ich, mitten im Satze.","Zoë sat down with me and asked me questions. She had a well-ordered face, in which insight was repeated from time to time, as if she were constantly seeing something. My father sat slightly to the right and listened to the Marchesa who laughed. Count Schulin stood between Maman and his wife and said something. But the countess interrupted him, I saw, in the middle of a sentence.","Zoë sat down next to me and began to ask questions.

"Mamans Tod verzieh sie uns niemals ganz. Sie alterte übrigens rasch während des folgenden Winters. Im Gehen war sie immer noch hoch, aber im Sessel sank sie zusammen, und ihr Gehör wurde schwieriger. Man konnte sitzen und sie groß ansehen, stundenlang, sie fühlte es nicht. Sie war irgendwo drinnen; sie kam nur noch selten und nur für Augenblicke in ihre Sinne, die leer waren, die sie nicht mehr bewohnte. Dann sagte sie etwas zu der Komtesse, die ihr die Mantille richtete, und nahm mit den großen, frisch gewaschenen Händen ihr Kleid an sich, als wäre Wasser vergossen oder als wären wir nicht ganz reinlich.","She never quite forgave us for Maman's death. She, moreover, aged rapidly during the following winter. She was still tall when she walked, but she slumped in the chair and her hearing became more difficult. You could sit and stare at her for hours, she didn't feel it. She was inside somewhere; she only came into her senses seldom and only for moments, which were empty, which she no longer inhabited. Then she said something to the Countess, who adjusted her mantilla, and took her dress with her large, freshly washed hands, as if water had been spilled or as if we weren't quite clean.","Maman’s death was something she never quite forgave us for. Besides, she aged very quickly during the following winter. When she walked she was as tall as ever, but she drooped in her armchair, and grew more and more hard of hearing.

In any case, she herself aged swiftly during the winter that followed. She still bore herself tall when she walked, but in her armchair she slumped; and she grew ever harder of hearing. You could sit and stare straight at her for hours and she would be unaware of your scrutiny. She was somewhere within; she returned only at rare intervals, and for brief moments, to her vacated senses, which she no longer inhabited.

"Das sind die Geräusche. Aber es giebt hier etwas, was furchtbarer ist: die Stille. Ich glaube, bei großen Bränden tritt manchmal so ein Augenblick äußerster Spannung ein, die Wasserstrahlen fallen ab, die Feuerwehrleute klettern nicht mehr, niemand rührt sich. Lautlos schiebt sich ein schwarzes Gesimse voroben, und eine hohe Mauer, hinter welcher das Feuer auffährt, neigt sich, lautlos. Alles steht und wartet mit hochgeschobenen Schultern, die Gesichter über die Augen zusammengezogen, auf den schrecklichen Schlag. So ist hier die Stille.","Those are the sounds. But there is something here that is more terrible: the silence. I think that with big fires there is sometimes a moment of extreme tension, the jets of water fall off, the firefighters don't climb anymore, nobody moves. A black cornice pushes up silently, and a high wall, behind which the fire erupts, bends silently. Everyone stands and waits with hunched shoulders, faces narrowed over eyes, for the terrible blow. That's the silence here.","These are the noises. But there is something here that is more dreadful: the silence. I imagine that during great fires such a moment of extreme tension must sometimes occur: the jets of water fall back, the firemen stop climbing the ladders, no one moves.

Everyone stands and waits, with raised shoulders and faces contracted above their eyes, for the terrifying crash. The silence here is like that.","[3] Those are the sounds I hear. But there is something more fearful still: the silence. I have a notion that, at big fires, a moment of extreme suspense can sometimes occur, when the jets of water slacken off, the firemen no longer climb, no one moves a muscle. Without a sound, a high black wall of masonry cants over up above, the fire blazing behind it, and, without a sound, leans, about to topple. Everyone stands waiting, shoulders tensed, faces drawn in around their eyes, for the terrible crash. That is how the silence is here.","[3] Those are the noises. But there’s something more terrible here: silence.

Everyone stands and waits, their shoulders hunched, their faces creased in a frown over the eyes, for the awful crash. That’s what the silence here is like."
"Es gehörte unglaubliche Vorsicht dazu, mit diesem Blute zu leben. Der Herzog war damit eingeschlossen in sich selbst, und zuzeiten fürchtete ers, wenn es um ihn herumging, geduckt und dunkel. Es konnte ihm selber grauenhaft fremd sein, dieses behende, halbportugiesische Blut, das er kaum kannte. Oft ängstigte es ihn, daß es ihn im Schlafe anfallen könnte und zerreißen. Er tat, als bändigte ers, aber er stand immer in seiner Furcht. Er wagte nie eine Frau zu lieben, damit es nicht eifersüchtig würde, und so reißend war es, daß Wein nie über seine Lippen kam; statt zu trinken, sänftigte ers mit Rosenmus. Doch, einmal trank er, im Lager vor Lausanne, als Granson verloren war; da war er krank und abgeschieden und trank viel puren Wein. Aber damals schlief sein Blut. In seinen sinnlosen letzten Jahren verfiel es manchmal in diesen schweren, tierischen Schlaf. Dann zeigte es sich, wie sehr er in seiner Gewalt war; denn wenn es schlief, war er nichts. Dann durfte keiner von seiner Umgebung herein; er begriff nicht, was sie redeten. Den fremden Gesandten konnte er sich nicht zeigen, öd wie er war. Dann saß er und wartete, daß es aufwachte.","It took incredible caution to live with that blood. The duke was thus shut up in himself, and at times he feared what was going on around him, crouched and dark. It could be horribly alien to himself, this nimble, half-Portuguese blood, which he hardly knew. It often frightened him that it might attack and tear him to pieces in his sleep. He pretended to subdue, but he always stood in his fear. He never dared to love a woman lest she be jealous, and it was so ardent that wine never passed his lips; instead of drinking, he softened with rosemary. Yes, he drank once, in the camp near Lausanne, when Granson was lost; then he was ill and isolated and drank a great deal of pure wine. But then his blood was asleep. In its senseless last years it sometimes fell into this heavy, animal sleep. Then it showed how much he was in his power; for when it slept he was nothing. Then no one from his surroundings was allowed in; he didn't understand what they were talking about. He could not show himself to the foreign ambassadors as he was. Then he sat and waited for it to wake up.","It required unbelievable caution to live with this blood. The Duke was locked in with it, inside himself, and at times he was afraid of it, when it moved around in him, dark and cringing. Even to him it could seem terrifyingly foreign, this nimble, half-Portuguese blood, which he hardly knew. He was often frightened that it would attack him as he slept, and tear him to pieces. He pretended that it had been mastered, but he always stood in terror of it. He never dared to love a woman, for fear that it would be jealous, and so ravening was it that he never let wine pass his lips; instead of drinking, he appeased it with a jam made from rose-leaves. One time he did drink, in the camp at Lausanne, when Granson had been lost; he was sick then and alone and drank a great deal of undiluted wine. But that time his blood slept. During his frenzied last years it would sometimes fall into this heavy, bestial sleep. Then it became apparent how completely he was in its power; for when it slept, he was nothing. Then none of his entourage was allowed to enter; he didn’t understand what they were saying. Nor could he show himself to the foreign envoys, desolate as he was. Then he sat and waited for it to awaken.","To live with that blood called for an incredible caution. The Duke was sealed up with it within himself, and at times he was afraid of it, when it moved around in him, furtive and dark. Even to him it could seem terribly alien, that fleet, half- Portuguese blood that he scarcely had any knowledge of. Often he feared it might attack him as he slept and tear him apart. He behaved as though he had it in his control, but in reality he always lived in terror of it. He never dared love a woman lest it be jealous, and so raging was it that he never let wine pass his lips; rather than drink, he appeased it with compote sweetened with rose-water. On one occasion, however, he did drink, in the camp before Lausanne, when Granson was lost; he was sick, and had no one, and he downed a great deal of wine, without water. But his blood was sleeping, then. During his last years, when he was out of his senses, it would sometimes fall into this heavy, bestial sleep. At such times, it was apparent just how very much he was in its power; when it slept, he was nothing. No one was allowed to enter his presence at those times; he did not understand what they were saying. He could not allow foreign envoys to see him, desolate as he was. He would sit there waiting for his blood to awaken.","Unbelievable caution was needed to live with blood like that.
