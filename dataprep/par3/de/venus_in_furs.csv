"»Auch hier ›Venus im Pelz‹«, sprach er fein lächelnd, »ich glaube nicht, daß der alte Venetianer damit eine Absicht verbunden hat. Er hat einfach das Porträt irgendeiner vornehmen Messaline gemacht und die Artigkeit gehabt, ihr den Spiegel, in welchem sie ihre majestätischen Reize mit kaltem Behagen prüft, durch Amor halten zu lassen, dem die Arbeit sauer genug zu werden scheint. Das Bild ist eine gemalte Schmeichelei. Später hat irgendein ›Kenner‹ der Rokokozeit die Dame auf den Namen Venus getauft, und der Pelz der Despotin, in den sich Titians schönes Modell wohl mehr aus Furcht vor dem Schnupfen als Keuschheit gehüllt hat, ist zu einem Symbol der Tyrannei und Grausamkeit geworden, welche im Weibe und seiner Schönheit liegt.","""Here too 'Venus in Furs',"" he said, smiling delicately, ""I don't think the old Venetian had any intention in doing so. He simply made the portrait of some noble Messaline, and had the gall to have Cupid hold the mirror in which she examines her majestic charms with cold complacency, for whom the work seems to grow sour enough. The picture is painted flattery. Later, some 'connoisseur' of the Rococo period baptized the lady Venus, and the despot's fur, in which Titian's beautiful model wrapped herself more out of fear of catching a cold than out of chastity, has become a symbol of tyranny and cruelty. which lies in woman and her beauty.","""It, too, is a 'Venus in Furs,'"" he said with a slight smile. ""I don't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention. He simply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina, and was tactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her majestic allure with cold satisfaction. He looks as though his task were becoming burdensome enough. The picture is painted flattery. Later an 'expert' in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the name of Venus. The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model wrapped herself, probably more for fear of a cold than out of modesty, have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that constitute woman's essence and her beauty. ""But enough of that.","“This too is Venus in Furs,” he said with a fine smile. “I don’t think the old Venetian had any ulterior motive. He simply did a portrait of some aristocratic Messalina and was courteous enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she examines her majestic charms with cold satisfaction—though his task seems more like a chore to him. This is a work of painted flattery. Later on, some ‘connoisseur’ of the rococo dubbed the lady Venus, and the female despot’s fur, in which Titian’s beautiful model is wrapped probably more out of fear of sniffles than out of chastity, has become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty intrinsic to a woman and her beauty. “But enough."

Zu allen Zeiten hat nur ernste, tiefe Bildung den sittlichen Charakter geschaffen; so folgt der Mann, auch wenn er selbstsüchtig, wenn er böswillig ist, stets Prinzipien, das Weib aber folgt immer nur Regungen.
