Charlotte, at the other side of the table next to the Captain, found it hard, nearly impossible to conceal her inner agitation.","This meant that the Baroness, to the right of the Count, could have very little talk with him; and she had just as little with Eduard who, thirsty at the start and then excited , did not stint himself with the wine and was conversing very animatedly with Ottilie, whom he had placed by him, whilst Charlotte, sitting on the Captain’s left, found it hard, indeed almost impossible, to conceal the trouble she felt."

"Wenn Luciane, meine Tochter, die für die Welt geboren ist, sich dort für die Welt bildet, wenn sie Sprachen, Geschichtliches und was sonst von Kenntnissen ihr mitgeteilt wird, so wie ihre Noten und Variationen vom Blatte wegspielt; wenn bei einer lebhaften Natur und bei einem glücklichen Gedächtnis sie, man möchte wohl sagen, alles vergißt und im Augenblicke sich an alles erinnert; wenn sie durch Freiheit des Betragens, Anmut im Tanze, schickliche Bequemlichkeit des Gesprächs sich vor allen auszeichnet und durch ein angebornes herrschendes Wesen sich zur Königin des kleinen Kreises macht, wenn die Vorsteherin dieser Anstalt sie als kleine Gottheit ansieht, die nun erst unter ihren Händen recht gedeiht, die ihr Ehre machen, Zutrauen erwerben und einen Zufluß von andern jungen Personen verschaffen wird, wenn die ersten Seiten ihrer Briefe und Monatsberichte immer nur Hymnen sind über die Vortrefflichkeit eines solchen Kindes, die ich denn recht gut in meine Prose zu übersetzen weiß: so ist dagegen, was sie schließlich von Ottilien erwähnt, nur immer Entschuldigung auf Entschuldigung, daß ein übrigens so schön heranwachsendes Mädchen sich nicht entwickeln, keine Fähigkeiten und keine Fertigkeiten zeigen wolle.","When Luciane, my daughter, who was born for the world, educates herself there for the world, when she is told languages, history and whatever other knowledge she has, just as she plays her notes and variations from sight; if, with a lively nature and a happy memory, she forgets everything, one might say, and remembers everything in a moment; when she distinguishes herself above all through her freedom of conduct, grace in dance, and befitting ease of conversation, and through an innate dominating nature makes herself the queen of the small circle, when the governess of this institution regards her as a minor divinity who is only now under her hands really thrives, who will do her credit, gain trust and bring in other young people, if the first pages of her letters and monthly reports are always just hymns about the excellence of such a child, which I know how to translate quite well into my prose : on the other hand, what she finally mentions about Ottilien is just excuse after excuse that a girl who is growing up so beautifully, by the way, doesn't want to develop, doesn't want to show any abilities or skills.","My daughter Luciane was born to live in the world and there she is learning to live in the world. She takes in her languages and her history, and whatever else they teach her, as easily as her piano-playing. With her vivacious nature and lively memory she can, one might almost say, forget everything one minute and remember it again the next. She excels all the others in the freedom of her deportment, the gracefulness of her dancing, the becoming ease of her conversation, and through an innately commanding personality she has made herself queen of her little circle. The headmistress of the establishment regards her as a little goddess who is blossoming only now under her care and who will bring her credit and the confidence of others, which will produce an influx of more young ladies into her school. The opening pages of her letters and monthly reports are never anything but hymns to the excellence of such a child, which I of course know how to translate into my own prose. But when she finally comes to speak of Ottilie there is only excuse upon excuse that a girl otherwise evolving so well should have no wish to develop her talents or display any accomplishments.","Whereas my daughter Luciane, born to be in the world and in that school preparing herself for the world, performs in languages and history and whatever else her teachers put to her with as much facility as she does in her exercises in music; and, naturally lively and blessed with a good memory, can forget everything, as it seems, and instantly remember it when she pleases; and excels all others in freedom of bearing, grace in dancing, ease and civility of conversation and, being by nature inclined to lead, has made herself the queen of her small circle; and whereas the Principal of that establishment views her as a minor divinity who, in her care, is blossoming as she ought, so doing her credit, promoting the school, and bringing it a further influx of young ladies; and whereas the first pages of the Principal’s letters and monthly reports are nothing but hymns in praise of the virtues of this wonderful child, which I am well able to translate into my own prose—what she finally has to say about Ottilie is only apology upon apology that a girl becoming otherwise so very attractive will yet not develop, or show any abilities or accomplishments."
"Haben Sie wohl einen Begriff, mein Freund, daß man aus diesem in einen andern, in den vorigen Zustand zurückkehren könne?« »Warum nicht?« versetzte der Gehülfe; »jeder Zustand hat seine Beschwerlichkeit, der beschränkte sowohl als der losgebundene.","Have you any notion, my friend, that one can return from this state to another, to the previous state?' 'Why not?' replied the assistant; “every condition has its difficulty, the limited as well as the unbound.","Do you think, my friend, that we could go back from this state of things to another, earlier state?’ ‘Why not?’ the schoolmaster replied. ‘Every state of things has its difficulties, the restricted as much as the free.","Do you think it possible we might ever quit this state for another one, for the old one perhaps?’ ‘Why not?’ said the Assistant in reply. ‘There are difficulties in every condition, in restraint and in unrestraint."

"Du drangst auf eine Verbindung; ich willigte nicht gleich ein, denn da wir ungefähr von denselben Jahren sind, so bin ich als Frau wohl älter geworden, du nicht als Mann.","You pressed for a connection; I didn't agree right away, because since we're about the same age, I must have gotten older as a woman, you not as a man.","You urged marriage; I did not consent at once for, since we are about the same age, I have grown older as a woman, you have not grown older as a man.","You were eager for a closer union, I did not consent at once: our ages being roughly the same, I, as a woman, had doubtless grown older than you had as a man."
"Ottiliens liebster Weg, teils allein, teils mit dem Kinde, ging herunter nach den Platanen auf einem bequemen Fußsteig, der sodann zu dem Punkte leitete, wo einer der Kähne angewunden war, mit denen man überzufahren pflegte.","Ottilie's favorite way, partly alone, partly with the child, was down to the plane trees on an easy footpath, which then led to the point where one of the boats, which people used to sail over, was tied up.","Ottilie’s favourite walk, sometimes alone, sometimes with the child, led down to the plane-trees by a comfortable foot-path and then to the place where one of the boats used for crossing the lake was moored.","Ottilie’s favourite walk, sometimes alone, sometimes with the baby, was down to the plane trees on an easy path which then led further to where one of the boats was moored that were used for crossing over."
"Alte Gatten sollten sich nur schnell begraben lassen, damit doch wieder einmal jemand im Hause zum Lachen käme, da ihnen keine Noterben gegeben waren.","Old spouses should only be buried quickly so that someone in the house would laugh again, since they were not given any emergency heirs.","Certain elderly husbands ought to get themselves buried as soon as possible so that, since there were no legal heirs, someone could for once have a good laugh in the house again.","Childless old couples should be off to their graves as quickly as possible, so that there might be some laughter in the house again at long last."

"Er fing daher an, gegen das Ende des Akts mit Behaglichkeit sich an die Stelle des Geistlichen zu versetzen, in einer muntern Rede seine Patenpflichten und Hoffnungen zu äußern und um so mehr dabei zu verweilen, als er Charlottens Beifall in ihrer zufriedenen Miene zu erkennen glaubte.","Toward the end of the act, therefore, he began to put himself comfortably in the position of the priest, to express his godfather duties and hopes in a lively speech, and to dwell on it all the more as he thought he recognized Charlotte's applause in her contented expression .","Consequently, towards the conclusion of the proceedings he commenced complaisantly to substitute himself for the officiating clergyman and to expatiate in a hearty address on his duties as godfather and on the hopes he entertained for the child, upon which hopes and duties he dwelt all the longer in that he thought he saw in Charlotte’s contented expression a sign of her approval.","Accordingly, towards the end of the proceedings, he usurped the parson’s place and began with cheerful self-satisfaction to list the hopes and duties that were his as a sponsor, and dwelled on them at length, reading an encouragement to do so in Charlotte’s contented looks."

"Aber als Eduard des andern Morgens an dem Busen seiner Frau erwachte, schien ihm der Tag ahnungsvoll hereinzublicken, die Sonne schien ihm ein Verbrechen zu beleuchten; er schlich sich leise von ihrer Seite, und sie fand sich, seltsam genug, allein, als sie erwachte.","But when Eduard awoke the next morning at his wife's bosom, the day seemed to dawn on him full of foreboding, the sun seemed to illuminate a crime; he slipped quietly from her side, and she found herself, strangely enough, alone when she awoke.","But when Eduard awoke beside his wife next morning the day seemed to be looking in upon him with ominous foreboding, the sun seemed to be lighting up a crime; he stole softly away from his wife and when she awoke she found herself, strangely enough, alone.

"Bei ihrer ruhigen, vorurteilsfreien Denkweise ließ sie auch ein solches Verhältnis, wie so viele andre, vor sich liegen; die Teilnahme des verständigen Mannes an Ottilien hielt sie wert; denn sie hatte in ihrem Leben genugsam einsehen gelernt, wie hoch jede wahre Neigung zu schätzen sei in einer Welt, wo Gleichgültigkeit und Abneigung eigentlich recht zu Hause sind.","With her calm, unprejudiced way of thinking, she, like so many others, let such a relationship lie before her; she valued the understanding man's interest in Ottilie; for in her life she had learned enough to see how highly every true affection was to be valued in a world where indifference and aversion are really at home.","and she resolved to let that situation, as she had so many others, evolve how it would.

"Sie war geistreich genug, um schnell einzusehen, daß jene recht hatten; aber das Getane widersprach, es war nun einmal so gemacht; sie hatte es recht, sie hatte es wünschenswert gefunden, selbst das Getadelte war ihr in jedem einzelnen Teile lieb; sie widerstrebte der Überzeugung, sie verteidigte ihre kleine Schöpfung, sie schalt auf die Männer, die gleich ins Weite und Große gingen, aus einem Scherz, aus einer Unterhaltung gleich ein Werk machen wollten, nicht an die Kosten denken, die ein erweiterter Plan durchaus nach sich zieht.","She was witty enough to quickly see that they were right; but what was done contradicted it, that's the way it was done; she was right, she had found it desirable, she even liked every part of what was criticized; she resisted persuasion, she defended her little creation, she scolded the men who immediately went far and wide, who wanted to make a work out of a joke, out of a conversation, didn't think about the costs, which an extended plan certainly involves pulls.","She could see at once the Captain was right, but what she had done contradicted him. It existed, and she had found it right and good. Even what was criticized was dear to her in every part and particular. She resisted conviction, she defended her little creation, she chided the men with flying off into the vast and grandiose, with wanting to turn a pastime into a labour, with failing to think of what a more ambitious plan would cost.","She was intelligent enough to see that the men were right; but what was done, having turned out the way it had, contradicted them; she had thought it right and what was wanted, and even where it had now been criticized she was fond of it, in every part; she fought against being convinced, she defended her little creation, railed against men for immediately thinking on a grand scale, for making a great work out of what had been an amusement and an entertainment, and for not considering the costs which an enlarged plan would be bound to entail."

"Nach meinen eigenen Besitzungen sehne ich mich nicht zurück, teils aus politischen Ursachen, vorzüglich aber, weil mein Sohn, für den ich alles eigentlich getan und eingerichtet, dem ich es zu übergeben, mit dem ich es noch zu genießen hoffte, an allem keinen Teil nimmt, sondern nach Indien gegangen ist, um sein Leben dort, wie mancher andere, höher zu nutzen oder gar zu vergeuden.","I do not long for my own possessions, partly for political reasons, but mainly because my son, for whom I have actually done and arranged everything, to whom I hand it over and with whom I hoped to still enjoy it, has no part in anything but went to India to make better use of his life there, like many others, or even to squander it.","I have no desire to return to my own estate, partly on political grounds but chiefly because my son, for whose sake I really built it up, to whom I hoped to bequeath it, and with whom I hoped to enjoy it during my lifetime, has no interest in any of it, but has taken himself off to India, where, like many another, he proposes to devote his life to higher ends, or even to throw it away altogether.","I have no longing to return to my own estates, partly for political reasons but principally because my son, for whom, in the end, all the work I did was done, to whom I hoped to bequeath it all, with whom I hoped for a time still to enjoy it, takes no part in any of it but has gone to India like many another to lead a more useful life there or, for all I know, to waste himself completely."

"Wir andern sollen daher unsre Zöglinge nach außen bilden; es ist notwendig, es ist unerläßlich und möchte recht gut sein, wenn man dabei nicht das Maß überschritte; denn indem man die Kinder für einen weiteren Kreis zu bilden gedenkt, treibt man sie leicht ins Grenzenlose, ohne im Auge zu behalten, was denn eigentlich die innere Natur fordert.","The rest of us should therefore educate our pupils outwardly; it is necessary, it is indispensable, and might be quite good if one does not overdo it; for when one intends to educate the children for a wider circle, one easily pushes them into the limitless, without keeping in mind what the inner nature really demands.","We others, therefore, have to cultivate our pupils in an outward-looking direction; that is unavoidable and necessary, and it can turn out very well provided one does not go too far in the process: for in seeking to educate children for a wider circle of life one can easily push them out into boundless spheres without keeping in view the real requirements of their inner nature.","There as teachers we must shape our pupils for an outward life. It is necessary, it is indispensable, and may well be a good thing, always providing we do not go too far. For as we endeavour to shape a child for the wider world it is easy to push him to where there are no boundaries at all and to lose sight of what his inner self actually requires."

"Denn auf den bisherigen Wege wäre man leicht ins Grenzenlose geraten und hätte den schönen Zustand reichlicher Glücksgüter, ohne sich zeitig genug zu besinnen, durch ein vordringliches Leben und Treiben, wo nicht zerstört, doch erschüttert.","Because on the previous path one would easily have gotten into the limitless and would have shaken the beautiful state of plentiful fortune without thinking about it early enough through an urgent life and activity, if not destroyed.","She resolutely reduced the household expenses, and when she looked into them properly she came to consider the emotional events which had taken place a blessing in disguise, because if they had gone on as they had been going on they could easily have got themselves involved in limitless expense and before they knew it their impetuous way of living and working would have, if not destroyed, at any rate seriously undermined their fortune and the comfortable circumstances that went with it.","For as things were going they might easily have got beyond all limits; and their agreeably fortunate and comfortable situation, had they not come to their senses in time, might, by living life at too rapid a rate, have been if not destroyed at least severely shaken."

"Entschließe dich also, mein Freund, für mich, für dich zu handeln, für mich, für dich diese Zustände zu entwirren, aufzulösen, zu verknüpfen!","Decide therefore, my friend, to act for me, for you, for me, for you, to unravel, dissolve, and connect these states!","So resolve, my friend, to act on my behalf and your own, and for my sake and your own to disentangle this situation.","Therefore, my friend, decide to act on my behalf and on your own, decide for my side and for yours to unravel, dissolve, and fasten anew these relations."

Although she is far younger than I, yet the presence of your more elderly friend charmed you so thoroughly you overlooked the beauty that was yet in bud.","She is pretty, her eyes especially are beautiful; but I am not aware that she made the least impression on me.’ ‘That is to your credit,’ said Charlotte, ‘for of course I was there too; and although she is a good deal younger than I am you were so taken with the charms of your older friend that you overlooked the beauty coming into being and promising so much."
"Dort fand er gute Leute, ein junges Ehepaar.","There he found good people, a young married couple.","He lifted up the dear burden again, he soon saw a solitary house, and when he reached it he found good people there, a young married couple to whom he quickly told his tale of misfortune and who brought him everything he asked for: a fire was soon blazing, woollen blankets were spread over a bed, pelts and furs and other warming garments were quickly fetched forth.","There he found good people, a young married couple."

"Auf die Frage hingegen, wo er sich denn jetzt gewöhnlich aufhalte, wohin er am liebsten zurückkehre, ließ er sich ganz unbewunden, doch den Frauen unerwartet, also vernehmen: »ich habe mir nun angewöhnt, überall zu Hause zu sein, und finde zuletzt nichts bequemer, als daß andre für mich bauen, pflanzen und sich häuslich bemühen.","On the other hand, when asked where he usually stays now, where he would most like to return to, he let himself be heard quite impassively, but unexpectedly from the women, i.e.: “I have now got used to being at home everywhere and in the end I can’t find anything more convenient than others building, planting and doing domestic work for me.","But to the question where he usually stayed now, where he most liked to return to, he replied without hesitation, yet to the surprise of the ladies: ‘I have got myself used to being at home everywhere, and by now nothing contents me more than that others should build and plant and make domestic arrangements on my behalf.","When asked, however, where he usually resided and where he was happiest to return to he replied quite straightforwardly but, for the women, surprisingly: ‘I have accustomed myself to being at home everywhere and have come to feel it the best possible arrangement that others should build, plant, and exert themselves domestically on my behalf."
"»Großer Gott!« ruft er aus, »wenn ich Ursache hätte, an meiner Frau, an meinem Freunde zu zweifeln, so würde diese Gestalt fürchterlich gegen sie zeugen.","'Good God!' he exclaims, 'if I had reason to doubt my wife or my friend, this figure would bear terrible witness against them.","‘Great God!’ he exclaimed, ‘if I had reason to doubt my wife and my friend this little form would be a terrible witness against them.","‘ Dear God,’ he cried, ‘if I had any reason to be suspicious of my wife and my friend this living shape would tell against them terribly."
"Das Bild eines Menschen ist doch wohl unabhängig; überall, wo es steht, steht es für sich, und wir werden von ihm nicht verlangen, daß es die eigentliche Grabstätte bezeichne.","The image of a person is certainly independent; wherever it stands it stands for itself, and we shall not ask it to designate the actual burial place.","A portrait is an independent thing; wherever it stands, it stands in its own right, and we shall not require that it should mark the actual grave.","The likeness of a person is surely an independent thing; wherever it stands, it stands for itself and we shall not require it to designate the actual place of burial."
"Der erfahrne, kunstreiche, kluge Mann bittet sie nur, das Kind nicht zu sehen; er entfernt sich, sie mit neuen Anstalten zu täuschen.","The experienced, artful, clever man only asks her not to see the child; he withdraws to deceive her with new arrangements.","An experienced and prudent man, he asks her only not to go and see the child; he departs, to deceive her that there is more to be done.","Experienced, skilled, and wise, he begged her not to look at the child; he withdrew, pretending there was more he might try."

"Der Gehülfe bezeichnete hierauf mit sehr viel Einsicht und ruhigem Ausdruck, wie er Ottilien in Absicht eines freieren Betragens, einer bequemeren Mitteilung, eines höheren Blicks in die weltlichen Dinge, der sich mehr in ihren Handlungen als in ihren Worten betätige, sehr zu ihrem Vorteil verändert finde, daß er aber doch glaube, es könne ihr sehr zum Nutzen gereichen, wenn sie auf einige Zeit in die Pension zurückkehre, um das in einer gewissen Folge gründlich und für immer sich zuzueignen, was die Welt nur stückweise und eher zur Verwirrung als zur Befriedigung, ja manchmal nur allzuspät überliefere.","The assistant then described with a great deal of insight and calm expression how he was changing Ottilie to her advantage with the aim of freer conduct, more comfortable communication, a higher view of worldly things, which was more active in her actions than in her words I think, however, that he believes that it will be of great use to her if she retires for a time, in order, in a certain sequence, to thoroughly and forever master what the world has done only piecemeal, and more to the confusion than to Satisfaction, yes, sometimes only too late.","The schoolmaster thereupon told, with a great deal of discernment and in a quiet tone, how he had found Ottilie changed very much to her advantage in respect of a more relaxed manner, an easier conversation and a greater insight into worldly affairs, which manifested themselves more in her actions than her words, but that he believed it would be very advantageous to her to return to the school for a time, so as to acquire permanently and thoroughly, in proper regular sequence, that which the world taught only partially, to the confusion rather than the satisfaction of the pupil, and indeed sometimes taught only when it was too late.","The Assistant’s reply was calmly delivered and full of insight. He found her, he said, much changed for the better, her manner less constrained, more at ease in her conversation, and with a more developed view of the world that expressed itself in her actions at least as much as in her words; but still he believed she might benefit very greatly by returning to the school for a while, so as to assimilate in proper order thoroughly and for ever the things which the world imparts only brokenly and more confusingly than satisfyingly, and often, indeed, too late."

"Es ließ sich fast ohne Verlust durch Zession der Gerechtsame tun; man hatte freiere Hand; man leistete, da alles im Gange, Arbeiter genug vorhanden waren, mehr auf einmal und gelangte gewiß und bald zum Zweck.","It could be done by assignment of the righteous with almost no loss; one had a freer hand; Since everything was going well and there were enough workers, more work was done at once and the purpose was soon and certainly achieved.","This could be done almost without loss by ceding the title: they now had a freer hand, now everything was in motion and there were enough labourers available they could do more at once, and could proceed with certainty and speed.","By ceding the franchise this could be done almost without loss; their hands would be untied, and since everything was now under way and there were enough workmen, they would get more done at one time and so bring matters to a successful conclusion quickly."
"Allein indem wir hier gleichsam einen Schatz vergraben, so denken wir zugleich, bei dem gründlichsten aller Geschäfte, an die Vergänglichkeit der menschlichen Dinge; wir denken uns eine Möglichkeit, daß dieser festversiegelte Deckel wieder aufgehoben werden könne, welches nicht anders geschehen dürfte, als wenn das alles wieder zerstört wäre, was wir noch nicht einmal aufgeführt haben.","However, while we are burying a treasure here, as it were, we think at the same time, in the most fundamental of all business, of the transience of human things; we think of a possibility that this tightly sealed cover could be lifted again, which should not happen otherwise than if everything were destroyed again, which we have not even listed.","But while we here as it were bury a treasure and are occupied with the most fundamental of all tasks, we think at the same time of the transitoriness of human things: we think of the possibility that this firm-sealed lid may one day be opened again, which could not happen unless that which has not yet even been built were all to be destroyed again.","However, whilst here, as it were, burying a treasure we are mindful also, in this most fundamental of all matters, of the fleetingness of human things.

"Ottilie wollte sich der beiden noch als des schönsten Hofpaares erinnern; und wenn Eduard ihr ein solches Gedächtnis aus ganz früher Jugend absprach, so behauptete sie doch, besonders einen Fall noch vollkommen gegenwärtig zu haben, wie sie sich einmal bei seinem Hereintreten in Charlottens Schoß versteckt, nicht aus Furcht, sondern aus kindischer Überraschung.","Ottilie wanted to remember them both as the most beautiful court couple; and if Eduard denied that she had such a memory from a very young age, she still claimed to have one case in particular that was still fresh in her mind, such as when she came into Charlotte hiding in her lap, not out of fear but out of childish surprise.","Ottilie claimed to remember them as being the handsomest couple at court, and when Eduard denied she could remember anything so early she asserted she could still perfectly well recall how once, when Eduard had come into the room, she had hidden her face in Charlotte’s lap, not because she was afraid but out of childish confusion.","Ottilie claimed to be able to remember them as the handsomest pair at Court; and when Eduard refused to believe that she could remember anything so early in her childhood, she insisted that one occasion in particular was still perfectly fresh in her mind: how once when he came in she had hidden her face in Charlotte’s skirts, and not out of fear but out of a childish astonishment."

Sie suchte zu erforschen, ob einer vor dem andern hiezu den Anlaß gäbe; aber sie konnte keinen Unterschied bemerken.","They did not hurry away from the table, especially in the evenings. Charlotte noticed that and didn't leave either of them unobserved. She tried to find out whether one of them gave the reason for this before the other; but she could not tell the difference.","They did not hurry so quickly away from the table, especially in the evenings. Charlotte noticed all this and kept both men under observation. She wanted to know which one was the instigator of this change of behaviour, but could see no distinction between them.","And especially in the evenings they were not in such a hurry to leave the table. Charlotte noticed as much, and observed them both. She wished to establish whether one was more decisive in this than the other; but she could not discern any difference."

"Schon bei den Anstalten zur Verheiratung ihrer Tochter war Charlotten die Abwesenheit ihres Gemahls höchst fühlbar gewesen; nun sollte der Vater auch bei der Geburt des Sohnes nicht gegenwärtig sein; er sollte den Namen nicht bestimmen, bei dem man ihn künftig rufen würde. Der erste von allen Freunden, die sich beglückwünschend sehen ließen, war Mittler, der seine Kundschafter ausgestellt hatte, um von diesem Ereignis sogleich Nachricht zu erhalten.","Charlotte had been acutely aware of her husband's absence when she was preparing her daughter's marriage; now the father should not be present even at the birth of the son; he should not determine the name by which he would be called in the future.

"Es ist mit den Geschäften wie mit dem Tanze: Personen, die gleichen Schritt halten, müssen sich unentbehrlich werden, ein wechselseitiges Wohlwollen muß notwendig daraus entspringen, und daß Charlotte dem Hauptmann, seitdem sie ihn näher kennengelernt, wirklich wohlwollte, davon war ein sicherer Beweis, daß sie ihn einen schönen Ruheplatz, den sie bei ihren ersten Anlagen besonders ausgesucht und verziert hatte, der aber seinem Plane entgegenstand, ganz gelassen zerstören ließ, ohne auch nur die mindeste unangenehme Empfindung dabei zu haben.","It is the same with business as with dancing: people who keep the same pace must become indispensable to one another, a mutual goodwill must necessarily result from this, and that Charlotte really did care for the captain since she got to know him better was a sure proof of that that she quite calmly let him destroy a beautiful resting place, which she had specially chosen and decorated in her first investments, but which ran counter to his plan, without having the slightest unpleasant feeling about it.","Working together is like dancing together: if you keep in step you become indispensable to one another.

That Charlotte was indeed well disposed towards the Captain since getting to know him more closely was proved for certain when in all serenity and with no disagreeable feelings whatsoever she allowed him to destroy a very pretty resting place which in her first endeavours she had picked out and beautified particularly but which stood now in the way of his plan."

"Die neuen, modischen Gewänder erhöhten ihre Gestalt; denn indem das Angenehme einer Person sich auch über ihre Hülle verbreitet, so glaubt man sie immer wieder von neuem und anmutiger zu sehen, wenn sie ihre Eigenschaften einer neuen Umgebung mitteilt.","The new, fashionable robes heightened their figure; for as the pleasantness of a person spreads through his shell, one seems to see him again and again anew and more gracefully as he communicates his qualities to a new environment.","The more fashionable dresses improved her figure.

"Ottilie hingegen, die in halbbewußter Jugend mehr ahnete als sah und ihren Blick wegwenden durfte, ja mußte von dem, was sie nicht sehen mochte und sollte, Ottilie ward durch diese traulichen Reden in den schrecklichsten Zustand versetzt; denn es zerriß mit Gewalt vor ihr der anmutige Schleier, und es schien ihr, als wenn alles, was bisher für Haus und Hof, für Garten, Park und die ganze Umgebung geschehen war, ganz eigentlich umsonst sei, weil der, dem es alles gehörte, es nicht genösse, weil auch der, wie der gegenwärtige Gast, zum Herumschweifen in der Welt, und zwar zu dem gefährlichsten, durch die Liebsten und Nächsten gedrängt worden.","Ottilie, on the other hand, who in half-conscious youth suspected more than she saw and was allowed to avert her gaze, indeed had to look away from what she did not want and should not see, Ottilie was thrown into the most terrible state by these intimate speeches; for the graceful veil tore in front of her violently, and it seemed to her as if everything that had been done for house and yard, for garden, park and the whole area was actually in vain, because the one to whom it all belonged , did not enjoy it, because he, like the present guest, had been urged by his loved ones and neighbors to roam about the world, and indeed to the most dangerous.","Ottilie, on the other hand – who in her half-aware youthfulness was given more to intuition than observation, and might, indeed must turn her eyes away from what she did not want and ought not to see – Ottilie was thrown into a terrible state by these confidences: they tore the veil from her eyes and it seemed to her now that all that had been done for the home and the household, for the garden and the park, and for all the domain around, had been done utterly in vain, because he to whom it all belonged could not enjoy it, because he too, like this present guest, had been driven by his nearest and dearest out to roam the world and, yes, out to face the greatest of the world’s dangers.","Ottilie on the other hand, who in her half-conscious youthfulness sensed more things than she saw, and might, indeed had to, avert her eyes from what she did not wish to and was not supposed to see, Ottilie was thrown by these confidences into the cruellest state: the agreeable veil before her eyes was torn asunder and it seemed to her as if everything done till then for the house, the garden, the park, and the whole environment was in fact for nothing, because the man to whom it all belonged had no joy of it since he, like their present visitor, was wandering the world, and in the most dangerous fashion, having been driven to do so by those who were closest in his love."

Wenn gewöhnliche Menschen, durch gemeine Verlegenheiten des Tags zu einem leidenschaftlich ängstlichen Betragen aufgeregt, uns ein mitleidiges Lächeln abnötigen, so betrachten wir dagegen mit Ehrfurcht ein Gemüt, in welchem die Saat eines großen Schicksals ausgesäet worden, das die Entwicklung dieser Empfängnis abwarten muß und weder das Gute noch das Böse, weder das Glückliche noch das Unglückliche, was daraus entspringen soll, beschleunigen darf und kann.","Charlotte, who liked to see Ottilie occupying herself and distracting herself in some way, let them both do as they pleased and went to indulge her own thoughts, to work through her reflections and worries that she could not tell anyone. If ordinary people, aroused to a passionately anxious demeanor by common embarrassments of the day, demand a compassionate smile from us, we contemplate with reverence a mind in which the seeds of a great destiny have been sown, which must await the development of this conception and neither the good or the bad, neither the happy nor the unhappy, may and can hasten what is to result from it.","She seemed all at once to have command of everything she had learned in her school lessons. She hardly noticed how easy it was. Charlotte, who was always happy to see Ottilie in any way occupied and distracted, left the couple to themselves and went away to ponder her own thoughts and to work out for herself the cares and worries she could share with no other. When ordinary people get passionately worked up over the common difficulties of everyday we can only give them a pitying smile, but we regard with reverence a soul in which the seed of a great destiny has been sown, which must await the unfolding of this conception, and which cannot and must not seek to accelerate either the good or the evil, the happiness or the unhappiness, which is to arise from it.","Charlotte, who was always glad to see Ottilie in any way occupied and distracted, left the pair to it, and went off to follow her own thoughts and work through for herself all the reflections and concerns which she could not communicate to anyone else. When ordinary people are agitated and made anxious by everyday inconveniences they may extract a smile of sympathy from us; but we look with reverence at a personality in which the seed of a large fate has been sown and which must wait upon the future growth of this conception and is not permitted and is not able to hasten the good or the ill, the happiness or the unhappiness, destined to come forth from it."
"Und wie die Knaben Krieg zu spielen, sich in Parteien zu sondern, einander Schlachten zu liefern pflegen, so stellte sich das trotzig mutige Mädchen einst an die Spitze des einen Heers und focht gegen das andre mit solcher Gewalt und Erbitterung, daß dieses schimpflich wäre in die Flucht geschlagen worden, wenn ihr einzelner Widersacher sich nicht sehr brav gehalten und seine Gegnerin doch noch zuletzt entwaffnet und gefangengenommen hätte.","And just as boys are wont to play war, to separate into factions, to fight one another, so the defiantly courageous girl once placed herself at the head of one army and fought against the other with such violence and bitterness that the latter would be disgraceful escaped if their single adversary had not behaved very well and had finally disarmed and captured his opponent.","And as boys are accustomed to play war-games, dividing up into sides and doing battle against one another, the bold defiant girl on one occasion placed herself at the head of one of the armies and fought the other with such violence and animosity it would have been beaten shamefully from the field if the only boy who ventured to oppose her had not borne himself very manfully and at length disarmed and captured his fair opponent.","And as boys play at war and divide into sides and fight battles, so the proud and spirited girl once set herself at the head of one of the armies and fought with such fierceness and force that the other would have been shamefully routed if her sole real opponent had not stood his ground and in the end disarmed her and taken her prisoner."
"Nanny sah ihre Gebieterin deutlich unter sich, deutlicher, vollständiger, schöner als alle, die dem Zuge folgten.","Nanny saw her mistress clearly below her, clearer, more complete, more beautiful than anyone following the procession.","Nanni saw clearly her mistress below her, more clearly, more completely, more beautifully than any who were following.","Nanni saw her mistress clearly below her, more clearly, more perfectly, in a greater beauty than any who were following in the procession."
"Charlotte verwies ihm sein Begehren ganz trocken: sie verstehe nicht, was er damit sagen wolle; denn er habe ja alles, was sich auf den Herrn beziehe, selbst im Beschluß.",Charlotte dryly dismissed his request: she didn't understand what he meant by that; for he himself has everything that relates to the Lord in the decree.,"Charlotte refused him quite brusquely: she could not see what he was talking about, did he himself not have command of everything that concerned his master?","Charlotte rebuked him for asking: she did not understand what he meant, surely all his master’s things were in his, the valet’s, keeping."
"In kurzer Zeit waren die beiden Abenteurer nicht nur angezogen, sondern geputzt.","In a short time, the two adventurers were not only dressed, but cleaned.",In a short time the two adventurers were not merely dressed but adorned.,Before long the two adventurers were not only dressed but they stood in finery.
"Der fortdauernd schöne, mehr schlaf- als todähnliche Zustand Ottiliens zog mehrere Menschen herbei.","Ottilie's enduringly beautiful state, more like sleep than death, attracted several people.","Ottilie’s continuing beauty, and the state resembling rather sleep than death in which she lay, attracted people to the chapel.","The continuing beauty of Ottilie’s state, more like sleep than death, attracted numbers of people."
"»Wie die Sache steht«, erwiderte Eduard, »werden wir uns auch nach mehreren Tagen immer übereilen.","""As things stand,"" Eduard replied, ""we'll always rush things, even after several days.","‘As matters stand,’ Eduard answered, ‘we should still be precipitate if we decided after a few weeks more.","‘Things being as they are,’ Eduard replied, ‘we shall still be acting precipitately even if we leave it for several days."
"Dieser kam, erstaunt über die Erscheinung seines alten Gönners, berichtete ihm die gegenwärtige Lage und übernahm es, Charlotten auf seinen Anblick vorzubereiten.","The latter came, astonished at the appearance of his old patron, reported to him the present situation, and undertook to prepare Charlotte for seeing him.","The doctor did so, astonished at the sudden appearance of his former benefactor, and told him what the situation was and undertook to prepare Charlotte for his arrival.","The Surgeon came, and was astonished to see his old protector there; he told him how things stood, and undertook to prepare Charlotte for his appearance."
"Einst gab ihm jedoch Charlotte hierzu Gelegenheit, indem sie in Beisein Ottiliens zu ihm sagte:» nun, Sie haben alles, was in meinem Kreise heranwächst, so ziemlich geprüft; wie finden Sie denn Ottilien?","However, Charlotte once gave him the opportunity to do this by saying to him in Ottilie's presence: ""Well, you've pretty much tested everything that's growing up in my circle; what do you think of Ottilie?","But one day Charlotte gave him an opportunity by saying in Ottilie’s presence: ‘Well, now you have examined pretty well everything going on in my circle, what do you think of Ottilie?","But then on one occasion Charlotte gave him the opportunity when, though Ottilie was with them, she said: ‘Well, now you have been the examiner of most things that are growing up around me, how do you find Ottilie?"
Eine bedeutende Musik spannte die Erwartung.,Significant music strained the expectation.,Solemn music heightened the sense of expectancy.,"There was music first, of a kind to raise expectations."
"»Sehen Sie«, wandte er sich zu Ottilien, die er einige Schritte vorführte, indem er hinabwies »diese Bäume habe ich selbst gepflanzt«.","""You see,"" he turned to Ottilie, whom he led a few steps by pointing down, ""I planted these trees myself.""",Look’ – turning to Ottilie and leading her a few steps forward and pointing down – ‘I planted those trees myself.’,"Look—’ he turned to Ottilie, led her a few steps forward and pointed down—‘I planted those trees myself.’"
"Ja, wie er sie auf dem Papier sah, fing er bitterlich an zu weinen.","Yes, as he saw her on paper, he began to cry bitterly.","This last phrase came from his pen not his heart, and when he saw it on the page he began to weep bitterly.","Indeed, seeing the words on the page he began to weep bitterly."
"Hatte bei jener Äußerung Charlottens sich Ottilie die Männer, besonders Eduarden, wieder herandenken können, so war es ihr um desto auffallender, als Charlotte von einer bevorstehenden Heirat des Hauptmanns wie von einer ganz bekannten und gewissen Sache sprach, wodurch denn alles ein andres Ansehn gewann, als sie nach Eduards frühern Versicherungen sich vorstellen mochte.","If Ottilie was able to think of the men, especially Eduarden, at Charlotte's statement, it was all the more striking to her when Charlotte spoke of the captain's imminent marriage as if it were a very well-known and certain matter, which made everything look different than she could imagine, according to Eduard's earlier assurances.","If this remark of Charlotte’s had given Ottilie occasion for thinking about the men again and particularly about Eduard, another remark did so all the more strikingly: Charlotte said the Captain would be getting married soon, and spoke of this eventuality as of something altogether certain and well-known, and this gave everything a very different complexion from what Ottilie had been led to imagine by Eduard’s earlier assurances.","When Charlotte made her remarks the men, and especially Eduard, were able to approach again in Ottilie’s thoughts, and so it was all the more remarkable to her when Charlotte spoke of a marriage the Captain was about to enter into as of something well known and definite, for this made everything look very different from how she had envisaged it on the basis of Eduard’s earlier assurances. These things caused Ottilie to pay ever-more attention to Charlotte’s"
Beide haben viel Gutes.,Both have a lot of good things.,Both have much to recommend them.,There is much good in each.
"Mir sind leider Fälle genug bekannt, wo eine innige, unauflöslich scheinende Verbindung zweier Wesen durch gelegentlich Zugesellung eines dritten aufgehoben und eins der erst so schön verbundenen ins lose Weite hinausgetrieben ward«.","Unfortunately, I know enough cases where an intimate, apparently indissoluble connection between two beings was broken by the occasional association of a third and one of the first so beautifully connected was driven out into the loose expanse.","I know, alas, of all too many cases in which an intimate and apparently indissoluble union between two beings has been broken up by a chance association with a third and one of the couple at first so fairly united driven out into the unknown.’","Alas, I know of enough cases in which a close and, as it seemed, indissoluble relationship was annulled by the casual arrival of a third party, and one of the pair, previously joined so beautifully, driven out into empty space.’"
"Wenigstens, mein Lieber«, fuhr sie fort, »sollst du gewahr werden, daß deine Wünsche, die freundliche Lebhaftigkeit, womit du sie ausdrückst, mich nicht ungerührt, mich nicht unbewegt lassen.","At least, my dear,"" she went on, ""you should realize that your wishes, the friendly vivacity with which you express them, do not leave me unmoved, not unmoved.","‘In any event, my dear, you shall know that your wishes and the spirited way you urge them do not leave me entirely unmoved or untouched.","‘In any event,’ she continued, ‘I am not averse to your knowing that your wishes and your lively and considerate way of expressing them have not left me untouched and unmoved."

"Noch eins fügte sie hinzu es war das Porträt ihres Vaters und verschloß das Ganze, worauf sie den zarten Schlüssel an dem goldnen Kettchen wieder um den Hals an ihre Brust hing.","She added one more thing, it was her father's portrait, and locked the whole thing, whereupon she again hung the delicate key on the golden chain around her neck on her breast.","She added one more object – it was her father’s portrait – and closed it all up, after which she hung the little key on the gold chain back around her neck.","Now she added one more thing—it was the portrait of her father—and locked the whole box, hanging the tiny key on its golden chain around her neck again, in her bosom."
"Sie gelangten auf ihrem Wege nach dem Gute zu einer kleinen Stadt, in der Eduard ein Haus besaß, wo er verweilen und die Rückkunft des Majors abwarten wollte.","On their way to the estate they came to a small town where Edward had a house, where he intended to stay and await the return of the major.",On their way to the estate they came to a little town in which Eduard owned a house; here he intended to stay and await the Major’s return.,"On their way towards the estate they arrived in a small town where Eduard owned a house, and there he would stay and wait for the Major to return."

"»Freilich«, rief Eduard; »es kehrte zu seinem A zurück, zu seinem A und O!« rief er, indem er aufsprang und Charlotten fest an seine Brust drückte.","""Certainly,"" cried Eduard; ""It went back to its A, to its A and O!"" he cried, jumping up and hugging Charlotte tightly to his chest.","cried Eduard: ‘It would return to its A, to its A and O, its alpha and omega!’ he cried, leaping up and pressing Charlotte hard against his breast.","Eduard cried. ‘He would go back to his A, to his Alpha and Omega!’ And he leapt to his feet and took Charlotte in his arms."

"Sie wußte nun, welchen Weg er genommen hatte, sie erfuhr, daß er großen Gefahren entronnen war; allein sie überzeugte sich sogleich, daß er größere aufsuchen würde, und sie konnte sich daraus nur allzusehr deuten, daß er in jedem Sinne schwerlich vom Äußersten würde zurückzuhalten sein.","She now knew which way he had taken, she learned that he had escaped great dangers; but she was immediately convinced that he would seek out larger ones, and from this she could see only too well that in every sense he would hardly be able to be restrained from the extreme.","She now knew what path he had chosen.

"Bisher war alles nach seinem Sinne gegangen, auch zum Besitz Charlottens war er gelangt, den er sich durch eine hartnäckige, ja romanenhafte Treue doch zuletzt erworben hatte; und nun fühlte er sich zum erstenmal widersprochen, zum erstenmal gehindert, eben da er seinen Jugendfreund an sich heranziehen, da er sein ganzes Dasein gleichsam abschließen wollte.","So far everything had gone his way, he had even acquired Charlotte's possessions, which he had finally acquired through a stubborn, even romance-like loyalty; and now for the first time he felt contradicted, for the first time hindered, just because he wanted to draw the friend of his youth closer to him, because he wanted to end his whole existence as it were.","After her death, which was not long delayed, he was his own master. He could travel wherever he liked, he could do whatever he liked. His desires were moderate, but he had an appetite for many and various things. He was candid, amiable, stout-hearted, he was even valiant if he had to be. What was there in all the world that could stand in his way! To that present moment he had had everything he wanted. He had even got Charlotte, he had at long last won her through an obstinate constancy which bordered on the fabulous. But now, just as he was also going to get the friend of his youth and thus so to speak round off his whole existence, he felt himself for the first time contradicted and crossed.","Every outcome had been as he had wished, even Charlotte he had got possession of, by his stubborn, indeed legendary fidelity finally winning her; and now for the first time he felt himself opposed, for the first time thwarted, and just when by having the friend of his youth to join him he might, so to speak, have rounded off his whole existence."

"»Lassen Sie mich gestehen«, sagte Charlotte, »wenn Sie diese Ihre wunderlichen Wesen verwandt nennen, so kommen sie mir nicht sowohl als Blutsverwandte, vielmehr als Geistes- und Seelenverwandte vor.

It is in this very way that truly meaningful friendships can develop among people; for opposite qualities make a more intimate union possible.","‘Let me confess,’ said Charlotte, ‘that when you call all these curious entities of yours affined, they appear to me to possess not so much an affinity of blood as an affinity of mind and soul. It is in just this way that truly meaningful friendships can arise among human beings: for antithetical qualities make possible a closer and more intimate union.","‘I must confess’, said Charlotte, ‘that when you speak of these wondrous entities as related they seem to me not so much blood relations as related in spirit and in the soul. In precisely this way true and important friendships may come about between people: opposing qualities make an intenser union possible."
