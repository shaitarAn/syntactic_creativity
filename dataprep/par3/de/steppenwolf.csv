"Die Täuschung beruht auf einer einfachen Übertragung. Als Körper ist jeder Mensch eins, als Seele nie. Auch in der Dichtung, selbst in der raffiniertesten, wird herkömmlicherweise stets mit scheinbar ganzen, scheinbar einheitlichen Personen operiert. An der bisherigen Dichtung schätzen die Fachleute, die Kenner am höchsten das Drama, und mit Recht, denn es bietet (oder böte) die größte Möglichkeit zur Darstellung des Ichs als einer Vielheit – wenn dem nicht der grobe Augenschein widerspräche, der uns jede einzelne Person eines Dramas, da sie in einem unweigerlich einmaligen, einheitlichen, abgeschlossenen Körper steckt, als Einheit vortäuscht. Am höchsten schätzt denn auch die naive Ästhetik das sogenannte Charakterdrama, in dem jede Figur recht kenntlich und abgesondert als Einheit auftritt. Nur von ferne erst und allmählich dämmert die Ahnung in einzelnen, daß das vielleicht alles eine billige Oberflächenästhetik ist, daß wir irren, wenn wir auf unsre großen Dramatiker die herrlichen, uns aber nicht eingeborenen, sondern bloß aufgeschwatzten Schönheitsbegriffe der Antike anwenden, welche, überall vom sichtbaren Leibe ausgehend, recht eigentlich die Fiktion vom Ich, von der Person, erfunden hat. In den Dichtungen des alten Indien ist dieser Begriff ganz unbekannt, die Helden der indischen Epen sind nicht Personen, sondern Personenknäuel, Inkarnationsreihen. Und in unsrer modernen Welt gibt es Dichtungen, in denen hinter dem Schleier des Personen- und Charakterspiels, dem Autor wohl kaum ganz bewußt, eine Seelenvielfalt darzustellen versucht wird. Wer dies erkennen will, der muß sich entschließen, einmal die Figuren einer solchen Dichtung nicht als Einzelwesen anzusehen, sondern als Teile, als Seiten, als verschiedene Aspekte einer höhern Einheit (meinetwegen der Dichterseele). Wer etwa den Faust auf diese Art betrachtet, für den wird aus Faust, Mephisto, Wagner und allen andern eine Einheit, eine Überperson, und erst in dieser höhern Einheit, nicht in den Einzelfiguren, ist etwas vom wahren Wesen der Seele angedeutet. Wenn Faust den unter den Schullehrern berühmten, vom Philister mit Schauer bewunderten Spruch sagt: »Zwei Seelen wohnen, ach, in meiner Brust!«, dann vergißt er den Mephisto und eine ganze Menge andrer Seelen, die er ebenfalls in seiner Brust hat. Auch unser Steppenwolf glaubt ja, zwei Seelen (Wolf und Mensch) in seiner Brust zu tragen und findet seine Brust dadurch schon arg beengt. Die Brust, der Leib, ist eben immer eines, der darin wohnenden Seelen aber sind nicht zwei, oder fünf, sondern unzählige; der Mensch ist eine aus hundert Schalen bestehende Zwiebel, ein aus vielen Fäden bestehendes Gewebe. Erkannt und genau gewußt haben dies die alten Asiaten, und im buddhistischen Yoga ist eine genaue Technik dafür erfunden, den Wahn der Persönlichkeit zu entlarven. Lustig und vielfältig ist das Spiel der Menschheit: der Wahn, zu dessen Entlarvung Indien tausend Jahre lang sich so sehr angestrengt hat, ist derselbe, zu dessen Stützung und Stärkung der Okzident sich ebenso viele Mühe gegeben hat.","The deception is based on a simple transference. Every human being is one as a body, never as a soul. Even in poetry, even the most refined, it is traditional to work with seemingly whole, seemingly unified people. Experts and connoisseurs appreciate the drama most of all in previous poetry, and rightly so, because it offers (or would offer) the greatest possibility of representing the ego as a multitude – if this were not contradicted by the rough appearance of each individual person of a drama, since it is in an inevitably unique, unified, self-contained body, feigning unity. The naïve aesthetic values the so-called character drama, in which each character is clearly recognizable and separate as a unit. Only from afar and gradually does the intuition dawn in individuals that perhaps all this is cheap superficial aesthetics, that we are mistaken when we apply to our great dramatists the wonderful concepts of beauty of antiquity that are not innate to us, but merely talked into them, which, everywhere starting from the visible body, actually invented the fiction of the ego, of the person. This concept is completely unknown in the poetry of ancient India; the heroes of Indian epics are not persons, but knots of persons, series of incarnations. And in our modern world there are works in which, behind the veil of play of persons and characters, an attempt is made to portray a multiplicity of souls, of which the author is hardly aware. Whoever wants to recognize this must decide not to regard the characters of such a poem as individual beings, but as parts, as sides, as different aspects of a higher unity (the poet's soul, for that matter). Anyone who looks at Faust in this way will see Faust, Mephisto, Wagner and all the others as a unit, a superperson, and it is only in this higher unit, not in the individual figures, that something of the true essence of the soul is indicated. When Faust says the famous saying among schoolteachers, which the Philistine admires with shudders: ""Two souls live, alas, in my breast!"" he forgets Mephisto and a whole host of other souls that he also has in his breast. Our steppe wolf also believes that he carries two souls (wolf and human) in his chest and finds his chest very cramped as a result. The breast, the body, is always one, but the souls residing in it are not two or five, but innumerable; man is an onion of a hundred skins, a web of many threads. The ancient Asians recognized and knew this very well, and in Buddhist yoga a precise technique was invented for unmasking the delusion of the personality. Merry and varied is the game of mankind: the madness that India has spent a thousand years striving so hard to expose is the same that the Occident has strove just as hard to sustain and strengthen.","The delusion rests simply upon a false analogy. As a body everyone is single, as a soul never. In literature, too, even in its ultimate achievement, we find this customary concern with apparently whole and single personalities. Of all literature up to our days the drama has been the most highly prized by writers and critics, and rightly, since it offers (or might offer) the greatest possibilities of representing the ego as a manifold entity, but for the optical illusion which makes us believe that the characters of the play are one-fold entities by lodging each one in an undeniable body, singly, separately and once and for all. An artless esthetic criticism, then, keeps its highest praise for this so-called character-drama in which each character makes his appearance unmistakably as a separate and single entity. Only from afar and by degrees the suspicion dawns here and there that all this is perhaps a cheap and superficial esthetic philosophy, and that we make a mistake in attributing to our great dramatists those magnificent conceptions of beauty that come to us from antiquity. These conceptions are not native to us, but are merely picked up at second hand, and it is in them, with their common source in the visible body, that the origin of the fiction of an ego, an individual, is really to be found. There is no trace of such a notion in the poems of ancient India. The heroes of the epics of India are not individuals, but whole reels of individualities in a series of incarnations. And in modern times there are poems, in which, behind the veil of a concern with individuality and character that is scarcely, indeed, in the author's mind, the motive is to present a manifold activity of soul. Whoever wishes to recognize this must resolve once and for all not to regard the characters of such a poem as separate beings, but as the various facets and aspects of a higher unity, in my opinion, of the poet's soul. If ""Faust"" is treated in this way, Faust, Mephistopheles, Wagner and the rest form a unity and a supreme individuality; and it is in this higher unity alone, not in the several characters, that something of the true nature of the soul is revealed. When Faust, in a line immortalized among schoolmasters and greeted with a shudder of astonishment by the Philistine, says: ""Two souls, alas, do dwell within my breast!"" he has forgotten Mephisto and a whole crowd of other souls that he has in his breast likewise. The Steppenwolf, too, believes that he bears two souls (wolf and man) in his breast and even so finds his breast disagreeably cramped because of them. The breast and the body are indeed one, but the souls that dwell in it are not two, nor five, but countless in number. Man is an onion made up of a hundred integuments, a texture made up of many threads. The ancient Asiatics knew this well enough, and in the Buddhist Yoga an exact technique was devised for unmasking the illusion of the personality. The human merry-go-round sees many changes: the illusion that cost India the efforts of thousands of years to unmask is the same illusion that the West has labored just as hard to maintain and strengthen.","The delusion is based on a straightforward instance of transference. As a body every human being is a single entity, as a soul never. Traditionally literature too, even at its most sophisticated, operates with ostensibly whole, ostensibly unified characters. In literature as we know it so far, the genre most highly regarded by experts and connoisseurs is drama. Rightly so, for drama offers the greatest opportunity to represent the self as multiple, or might do so , if only outward appearances didn’t contradict this impression, each individual character being deceptively portrayed as a unity because he or she is inevitably encased in a unique, unified and self-contained body. This of course also explains why aesthetically naive judges value the so-called character play most highly, in which every figure appearing on stage is a quite discrete and recognizable entity. Only remotely and gradually is it beginning to dawn on some individuals that this aesthetic approach may be shoddy and superficial, that it is a mistake to apply ancient Greek concepts of beauty to our own great dramatists. Splendid though these are, they are not native to us. We have been talked into adopting them from Greek thinkers who, taking the visible body as their starting point, were the real originators of the fiction of the individual self or character. This concept is totally unknown in the literary works of ancient India. The heroes of the Indian epics are not single characters but tangled knots of character, serial incarnations. In our modern world too, some works of literature exist in which, though the author is probably scarcely conscious of the fact, an attempt is being made to portray a multiplicity of souls behind the veil of individual character depiction. Anyone wishing to appreciate this must for once resolve to view the characters in such a work not as individual entities but as parts, as facets, as different aspects of a higher unity, if you like, of the mind of the author. Anyone considering Goethe’s Faust in this way, for example, will make of Faust, Mephistopheles, Wagner and all the other figures a unity, a super-character. And only from this higher unity, not the individual characters, can one glean some hint of the work’s true soul. When Faust makes the pronouncement – on the tongue of every schoolteacher and apt to make philistines shudder with admiration – ‘Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast!’ he is forgetting Mephisto and a whole host of other souls that are just as much part of him. Our Steppenwolf also thinks he is bearing the burden of two souls (wolf and human being) within his breast, and that his breast is painfully constricted as a result. The fact is that the breast, the body, is always one, yet the souls that it houses are neither two nor five but countless in number. A human being is an onion consisting of a hundred skins, a fabric composed of many threads. The Asians of old had exact knowledge of this; Buddhist Yoga invented a precise technique for exposing the personality as a delusion. But then humankind moves in all sorts of comic ways: the delusion that for a thousand years India made such great efforts to expose is the self-same delusion that the West has been at equally great pains to bolster and reinforce."

"Damals hatte ich dem schönen Mädchen, das allein und träumerisch bergaufwärts gegangen kam und mich noch nicht sah, voll banger Erwartung entgegengesehen, hatte ihr Haar gesehen, das in dicken Zöpfen aufgebunden war und doch noch zu beiden Seiten der Wangen offne Strähnen hatte, die im Winde spielten und flossen. Ich hatte gesehen, zum erstenmal in meinem Leben, wie schön dies Mädchen war, wie schön und traumhaft dies Spiel des Windes in ihrem zarten Haar, wie schön und sehnsuchtweckend der Fall ihres dünnen blauen Kleides über die jungen Glieder hinab, und ebenso, wie mich mit dem bitter-würzigen Geschmack der zerkauten Knospe die ganze bange süße Lust und Angst des Frühlings durchtränkte, so erfüllte mich beim Anblick des Mädchens die ganze tödliche Ahnung der Liebe, die Ahnung vom Weibe, das erschütternde Vorgefühl ungeheurer Möglichkeiten und Versprechungen, namenloser Wonnen, unausdenklicher Verwirrungen, Ängste und Leiden, innigster Erlösung und tiefster Schuld. O wie brannte der bittre Frühlingsgeschmack auf meiner Zunge! O wie strömte der spielende Wind durch das lose Haar neben ihren roten Wangen! Dann war sie mir nahe gekommen, hatte aufgeblickt und mich erkannt, war einen Augenblick schwach errötet und hatte beiseite geblickt; dann grüßte ich sie, mit gezogenem Konfirmandenhut, und Rosa, alsbald gefaßt, grüßte lächelnd und ein wenig damenhaft zurück, erhobenen Gesichts, und ging langsam, sicher und überlegen weiter, umsponnen von tausend Liebeswünschen, Forderungen und Huldigungen, die ich ihr nachsandte.","At that time I had looked forward to the beautiful girl, who was alone and dreamily walking up the hill and did not see me yet, I had seen her hair, which was tied up in thick braids and still had loose strands on both sides of her cheeks, which in the Winds played and flowed. For the first time in my life I had seen how beautiful this girl was, how beautiful and dreamlike the play of the wind in her delicate hair, how beautiful and yearning the fall of her thin blue dress over her young limbs, and just like me with the bitter-spicy taste of the chewed bud soaked all the anxious sweet joy and fear of spring, so at the sight of the girl I was filled with the whole deadly foreboding of love, the foreboding of woman, the shattering foreboding of immense possibilities and promises, nameless bliss, unthinkable confusion, fear and suffering, deepest salvation and deepest guilt. O how the bitter taste of spring burned on my tongue! Oh, how the playing wind streamed through the loose hair next to her red cheeks! Then she came close to me, looked up and recognized me, blushed faintly for a moment and looked away; then I greeted her, with my confirmation hat raised, and Rosa, immediately composed, greeted her with a smile and a little ladylike, raised her face, and walked on slowly, confidently and deliberately, surrounded by a thousand love wishes, demands and homage, which I sent after her.","She came, that day, alone and dreamingly up the hill towards me. She had not seen me and the sight of her approaching filled me with apprehension and suspense. I saw her hair, tied in two thick plaits, with loose strands on either side, her cheeks blown by the wind. I saw for the first time in my life how beautiful she was, and how beautiful and dreamlike the play of the wind in her delicate hair, how beautiful and provocative the fall of her thin blue dress over her young limbs; and just as the bitter spice of the chewed bud coursed through me with the whole dread pleasure and pain of spring, so the sight of the girl filled me with the whole deadly foreboding of love, the foreboding of woman. In that moment was contained the shock and the forewarning of enormous possibilities and promises, nameless delight, unthinkable bewilderments, anguish, suffering, release to the innermost and deepest guilt. Oh, how sharp was the bitter taste of spring on my tongue! And how the wind streamed playfully through the loose hair beside her rosy cheeks! She was close now. She looked up and recognized me. For a moment she blushed a little and looked aside; but when I took off my school cap, she was self-possessed at once and, raising her head, returned my greeting with a smile that was quite grown-up. Then, entirely mistress of the situation, she went slowly on, in a halo of the thousand wishes, hopes and adorations that I sent after her.","At the time, I had been full of anxious anticipation as I watched the beautiful young girl, who had not yet spotted me, coming up the hill towards me, alone and deep in reverie. Although she wore her hair tied up in thick plaits, I had still glimpsed some loose strands of it blowing and waving in the breeze on either side of her cheeks. For the first time in my life, I had seen the beauty of the girl, the beautiful and dreamlike effect of the wind playing in her delicate hair, the beautiful and arousing cut of her thin blue dress as it hung down over her young limbs. And just as the spicy, bitter taste of the bud I was chewing on had imbued me with all the alarmingly sweet joy and anxiety of spring, the sight of the girl now filled me with a deadly premonition of sexual passion, a foretaste of femininity, a deeply shocking presentiment of all the enormous opportunities it promised, all the nameless delights, the unimaginable entanglements, anxieties and sorrows, the heights of fulfilment and the depths of guilt. Oh, how I could feel the bitter taste of spring burning on my tongue! Oh, how the wind was playing in the loose hair dangling by her red cheeks! Then, arriving close by, she had looked up and recognized me. Blushing slightly for a moment, she had looked away. Then I greeted her, raising the new hat I’d worn at that day’s confirmation service. Her composure soon regained, she lifted her head in a faintly ladylike fashion and greeted me back with a smile before slowly walking on with an air of confidence and superiority. A host of amorous wishes, demands and tributes that I sent after her surrounded her like a nimbus."
"Nie vergesse ich unsre erste persönlichere Begegnung. Wir kannten einander nur so, wie eben Zimmernachbarn in einem Mietshaus sich kennen. Da kam ich eines Abends aus dem Geschäft nach Hause und fand zu meinem Erstaunen Herrn Haller beim Absatz der Treppe zwischen dem ersten und zweiten Stockwerk sitzen. Er hatte sich auf die oberste Treppenstufe gesetzt und rückte beiseite, um mich vorbei zu lassen. Ich fragte ihn, ob er nicht wohl sei, und bot mich an, ihn vollends nach oben zu begleiten.",I will never forget our first personal encounter. We only knew each other the way roommates in an apartment building know each other. One evening I came home from the shop and to my astonishment found Mr. Haller sitting on the landing between the first and second floors. He sat on the top step and moved aside to let me pass. I asked him if he was not well and offered to accompany him upstairs all the way.,I have never forgotten our first encounter. We knew each other then only as fellow lodgers whose rooms were adjoining ones. Then one evening I came home from business and to my astonishment found Haller seated on the landing between the first and second floors. He was sitting on the top step and he moved to one side to let me pass. I asked him if he was all right and offered to take him up to the top.,"I shall never forget our first encounter of a more personal kind. We knew each other only in the way next-door neighbours tend to in rented accommodation. Then one evening, coming home from work, I was astonished to find Herr Haller sitting on the stairs close to the landing between the first and second floors. He had sat down on the top step, and moved to one side to let me pass. Asking whether he was unwell, I offered to accompany him right to the top."
"O, ich begriff alles, begriff Pablo, begriff Mozart, hörte irgendwo hinter mir sein furchtbares Lachen, wußte alle hunderttausend Figuren des Lebensspiels in meiner Tasche, ahnte erschüttert den Sinn, war gewillt, das Spiel nochmals zu beginnen, seine Qualen nochmals zu kosten, vor seinem Unsinn nochmals zu schaudern, die Hölle meines Innern nochmals und noch oft zu durchwandern.","Oh, I understood everything, understood Pablo, understood Mozart, heard his terrible laughter somewhere behind me, knew all the hundred thousand pieces of the game of life in my pocket, shaken guessed the meaning, was willing to start the game again, to taste his torments again, to shudder again before his nonsense, to wander through the hell of my inner being again and again and again.","I understood it all. I understood Pablo. I understood Mozart, and somewhere behind me I heard his ghastly laughter. I knew that all the hundred thousand pieces of life's game were in my pocket. A glimpse of its meaning had stirred my reason and I was determined to begin the game afresh. I would sample its tortures once more and shudder again at its senselessness. I would traverse not once more, but often, the hell of my inner being.","Oh, now I understood everything, understood Pablo, understood Mozart, whose terrible laughter I could hear somewhere or other behind me. I knew that the pieces of life’s game were there in my pocket, all hundred thousand of them. Though shocked to the core, I had a sense of what the game meant, and I was willing to start playing it again, to sample its torments once more, once more to shudder at the nonsense it entailed, again to journey through my personal hell, a journey I would often have to repeat."
"»Danke«, sagte ich, »ich kann unmöglich nach Hause gehen, ich kann nicht, ich kann nicht, ich will hierbleiben, bei Ihnen, wenn Sie es erlauben.

"Wäre jetzt der Hausherr eingetreten, so wäre es mir vielleicht geglückt, unter annehmbaren Vorwänden meinen Rückzug auszuführen. Es kam jedoch seine Frau herein, und ich ergab mich ins Geschick, obwohl ich Unheil ahnte. Wir begrüßten uns, und dem ersten Mißklang folgten lauter neue. Die Frau beglückwünschte mich zu meinem guten Aussehen, während mir nur allzu bewußt war, wie sehr ich in den Jahren seit unsrer letzten Begegnung gealtert war; schon bei ihrem Händedruck hatte der Schmerz in den Gichtfingern mich fatal daran erinnert. Ja, und dann fragte sie, wie es denn meiner lieben Frau gehe, und ich mußte ihr sagen, daß meine Frau mich verlassen habe und unsre Ehe geschieden sei. Wir waren froh, als der Professor eintrat. Auch er begrüßte mich herzlich, und die Schiefheit und Komik der Situation fand alsbald den denkbar hübschesten Ausdruck. Er hielt eine Zeitung in Händen, das Blatt, auf das er abonniert war, eine Zeitung der Militaristen- und Kriegshetzepartei, und nachdem er mir die Hand gegeben hatte, deutete er auf das Blatt und erzählte, darin stehe etwas über einen Namensvetter von mir, einen Publizisten Haller, der ein übler Kerl und vaterlandsloser Geselle sein müsse, er habe sich über den Kaiser lustig gemacht und sich zu der Ansicht bekannt, daß sein Vaterland am Entstehen des Krieges um nichts minder schuldig sei als die feindlichen Länder. Was das für ein Kerl sein müsse! Na, hier kriege der Bursche es gesagt, die Redaktion habe diesen Schädling recht schneidig erledigt und an den Pranger gestellt. Wir gingen jedoch zu anderem über, als er sah, daß dies Thema mich nicht interessiere, und die beiden dachten wirklich nicht von ferne an die Möglichkeit, daß jenes Scheusal vor ihnen sitzen könne, und doch war es so, das Scheusal war ich selbst. Na, wozu Lärm machen und die Leute beunruhigen! Ich lachte in mich hinein, gab aber jetzt die Hoffnung verloren, an diesem Abend noch etwas Angenehmes zu erleben. Ich habe den Augenblick deutlich in Erinnerung. In diesem Augenblick nämlich, während der Professor vom Vaterlandsverräter Haller sprach, verdichtete sich in mir das schlimme Gefühl von Depression und Verzweiflung, das sich seit der Begräbnisszene in mir angehäuft und immer verstärkt hatte, zu einem wüsten Druck, zu einer körperlich (im Unterleib) fühlbaren Not, einem würgend angstvollen Schicksalsgefühl. Es lag etwas gegen mich auf der Lauer, fühlte ich, es beschlich mich von hinten eine Gefahr. Zum Glück kam jetzt die Meldung, daß das Essen bereitstehe. Wir gingen ins Speisezimmer, und während ich mich bemühte, immer wieder irgend etwas Harmloses zu sagen oder zu fragen, aß ich mehr, als ich gewohnt war, und fühlte mich von Augenblick zu Augenblick jämmerlicher. Mein Gott, dachte ich beständig, warum strengen wir uns denn so an? Deutlich fühlte ich, daß auch meine Gastgeber sich gar nicht wohl fühlten und daß ihre Munterkeit ihnen Mühe mache, sei es nun, daß ich so lähmend wirkte, sei es, daß sonst eine Verstimmung im Hause war. Sie fragten mich nach lauter Dingen, auf welche eine aufrichtige Antwort nicht zu geben war, bald hatte ich mich richtig festgelogen und kämpfte mit dem Ekel bei jedem Wort. Schließlich begann ich, um abzulenken, von dem Begräbnis zu erzählen, dessen Zuschauer ich heut gewesen war. Aber ich traf den Ton nicht, meine Anläufe zum Humor wirkten verstimmend, wir kamen mehr und mehr auseinander, in mir lachte der Steppenwolf mit grinsendem Gebiß, und beim Nachtisch waren wir alle drei recht schweigsam.","If the master of the house had come in now, I might have succeeded in carrying out my retreat under acceptable pretexts. His wife came in, however, and I resigned myself to fate, although I suspected evil. We greeted each other, and the first discord was followed by new ones. The woman complimented me on my good looks, while I was only too aware of how much I had aged in the years since we last met; Even when she shook her hand, the pain in my gouty fingers had fatally reminded me of that. Yes, and then she asked how my dear wife was, and I had to tell her that my wife had left me and that our marriage was divorced. We were glad when the professor entered. He, too, greeted me warmly, and the oddness and comedy of the situation soon found the prettiest imaginable expression. He was holding a newspaper, the paper to which he subscribed, a newspaper of the Militarist and Warmongering Party, and after shaking my hand, he pointed to the paper and said it said something about a namesake of mine, a publicist Haller, who must be a bad fellow and a fellow without a country, that he had made fun of the Kaiser and professed the opinion that his fatherland was no less to blame for the outbreak of the war than the enemy countries. What a fellow that must be! Well, here the fellow was told that the editors had dealt with this vermin very dashingly and put it in the pillory. However, we moved on to something else when he saw that I was not interested in the subject, and the two of them really did not remotely consider the possibility that that monster might be sitting in front of them, and yet it was so, the monster was myself. Why make noise and worry people! I laughed to myself, but now gave up hope of experiencing anything pleasant that evening. I remember the moment clearly. At that moment, while the professor was talking about Haller, the traitor to the fatherland, the bad feeling of depression and despair that had been building up in me since the funeral scene and had been getting worse, intensified into a wild pressure, into a physical (in my abdomen) palpable need, a choking, anxious feeling of fate. Something was lying in wait for me, I felt, a danger crept up on me from behind. Luckily the news came that the food was ready. We went into the dining room, and while I was struggling to keep saying or asking something harmless, I ate more than I was used to and felt more miserable from moment to moment. My God, I kept thinking, why are we trying so hard? I felt very clearly that my hosts weren't feeling well either, and that their cheerfulness was giving them trouble, whether it was because I seemed so paralyzing or because there was some other upset in the house. They asked me all sorts of things that couldn't be answered honestly. Soon I had lied to myself and fought with the disgust at every word. Finally, to distract myself, I began to talk about the funeral I had witnessed today. But I didn't hit the right note, my attempts at humor had an upsetting effect, we grew more and more apart, the Steppenwolf in me laughed with grinning teeth, and at dessert the three of us were quite silent.","If only the master of the house had come in now, I might have had the luck to find some favorable opportunity for finding my way out. As it was, his wife came in, and I surrendered to fate though I scented danger. We shook hands and to the first discord there succeeded nothing but new ones. The lady complimented me on my looks, though I knew only too well how sadly the years had aged me since our last meeting. The clasp of her hand on my gouty fingers had reminded me of it already. Then she went on to ask after my dear wife, and I had to say that my wife had left me and that we were divorced. We were glad enough when the professor came in. He too gave me a hearty welcome and the awkward comedy came to a beautiful climax. He was holding a newspaper to which he subscribed, an organ of the militarist and jingoist party, and after shaking hands he pointed to it and commented on a paragraph about a namesake of mine—a publicist called Haller, a bad fellow and a rotten patriot—who had been making fun of the Kaiser and expressing the view that his own country was no less responsible for the outbreak of war than the enemy nations. There was a man for you! The editor had given him his deserts and put him in the pillory. However, when the professor saw that I was not interested, we passed to other topics, and the possibility that this horrid fellow might be sitting in front of them did not even remotely occur to either of them. Yet so it was, I myself was that horrid fellow. Well, why make a fuss and upset people? I laughed to myself, but gave up all hope now of a pleasant evening. I have a clear recollection of the moment when the professor spoke of Haller as a traitor to his country. It was then that the horrid feeling of depression and despair which had been mounting in me and growing stronger and stronger ever since the burial scene condensed to a dreary dejection. It rose to the pitch of a bodily anguish, arousing within me a dread and suffocating foreboding. I had the feeling that something lay in wait for me, that a danger stalked me from behind. Fortunately the announcement that dinner was on the table supervened. We went into the dining room, and while I racked my brains again and again for something harmless to say, I ate more than I was accustomed to do and felt myself growing more wretched with every moment. Good heavens, I thought all the while, why do we put ourselves to such exertions? I felt distinctly that my hosts were not at their ease either and that their liveliness was forced, whether it was that I had a paralyzing effect on them or because of some other and domestic embarrassment. There was not a question they put to me that I could answer frankly, and I was soon fairly entangled in my lies and wrestling with my nausea at every word. At last, for the sake of changing the subject, I began to tell them of the funeral which I had witnessed earlier in the day. But I could not hit the right note. My efforts at humor fell entirely flat and we were more than ever at odds. Within me the Steppenwolf bared his teeth in a grin. By the time we had reached dessert, silence had descended on all three of us.","If the man of the house had entered at this moment I might have managed, after making some acceptable excuses, to beat a retreat. However, it was his wife who came in and I surrendered to my fate even though I sensed that nothing good would come of it. As we exchanged greetings, the first dissonant note was followed by a whole series of others. The professor’s wife congratulated me on how well I was looking, whereas I was only too aware of the extent to which I had aged in the years since our last meeting. The pain in my gout-ridden fingers as we shook hands had been an embarrassing enough reminder of the fact. Yes, and when she then asked how my dear wife was I had no alternative but to tell her that my wife had left me and that we were now divorced. We were pleased to see the professor come in. He too greeted me warmly, only for the whole awkwardness and comedy of the situation to emerge at once and in the most striking form imaginable. He was carrying a copy of the newspaper he subscribed to, a publication of the militarist and warmongering party, and, after shaking my hand, he pointed to it, saying there was something in it about a namesake of mine, a journalist called Haller who must be a dastardly figure, one of those chaps without any allegiance to the Fatherland. Haller had, he said, made fun of the Kaiser and publicly declared that his Fatherland was no less responsible for starting the war than the enemy countries. What a nasty piece of work he must be! Well, he said, now the fellow was getting his comeuppance. The paper’s editor had well and truly pilloried the pest, made short work of him. However, when he saw that I was not interested in the subject we went on to talk of other matters. It didn’t remotely occur to either of them that the monster in question might be sitting there in front of them, yet this was indeed the case: I myself was that monster. Ah well, why upset people by making a song and dance about it? I was laughing inwardly, but by now I had abandoned all hope of still having a pleasant evening. I can remember clearly the moment when I did so. You see, precisely when the professor was talking about that traitor to the Fatherland Haller the awful feeling of depression and despair that had been building up in me ever since the scene at the funeral, getting stronger and stronger, reached maximum intensity. Its pressure was terrible; I experienced it physically as an acute abdominal pain, a harrowing, fearful sense that my fate was sealed. I felt something was lying in wait for me, some threat stealing up on me from behind. Fortunately we were now informed that dinner was served. We went into the dining room where, constantly making an effort to say or ask something quite harmless, I ate more than I was accustomed to. Feeling more wretched by the moment, I kept wondering why on earth we make such efforts. It was clear to me that my hosts too were feeling anything but comfortable, that their cheerfulness was forced, whether because they were inhibited by me, or else were out of sorts for some domestic reason. They only asked me questions it was impossible to give an honest answer to and, as a result, I had soon lied myself into such a corner that every word I uttered almost made me sick. Eventually, in an effort to distract them, I started to tell them about the funeral I had witnessed that day, but I struck the wrong note. My attempts at humour did nothing to improve the general mood, and we were increasingly at odds with one another. Inside me, Steppenwolf was laughing and baring his teeth and, by the time dessert was served, we had all three fallen quite silent."

"»Sie langweilen mich. Haben Sie die Güte, Ihre Arbeit zu Ende zu führen. Wenn der Begriff der Pflicht Ihnen unbekannt ist . . .« Er schwieg und verzog die Lippen, als wolle er ausspucken. Es kam aber nur ein wenig Blut, das an seinem Kinn kleben blieb. »Warten Sie!« sagte Gustav höflich. »Den Begriff der Pflicht allerdings kenne ich nicht, nicht mehr. Früher hatte ich amtlich viel mit ihm zu tun, ich war Professor der Theologie. Außerdem war ich Soldat und habe den Krieg mitgemacht. Das, was mir Pflicht schien und was mir von Autoritäten und Vorgesetzten jeweils befohlen worden ist, war alles gar nicht gut, ich hätte stets lieber das Gegenteil getan. Aber wenn ich auch den Begriff der Pflicht nicht mehr kenne, so kenne ich doch den der Schuld – vielleicht sind sie beide dasselbe. Indem eine Mutter mich geboren hat, bin ich schuldig, bin ich verurteilt zu leben, bin verpflichtet, einem Staat anzugehören, Soldat zu sein, zu töten, Steuern für Rüstungen zu bezahlen. Und jetzt, in diesem Augenblick, hat die Lebensschuld mich wieder, wie einst im Kriege, dazu geführt, töten zu müssen. Und diesmal töte ich nicht mit Widerwillen, ich habe mich in die Schuld ergeben, ich habe nichts dagegen, daß diese dumme, verstopfte Welt in Scherben geht, ich helfe gerne mit und gehe selber gerne mit zugrunde.«","“You bore me. Have the goodness to finish your work. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of duty . . .' He said nothing and curled his lips as if about to spit. Only a little blood came out and it stuck to his chin. ""Wait!"" said Gustav politely. “I don't know the concept of duty, though, not anymore. I used to have a lot to do with him officially, I was a professor of theology. I was also a soldier and took part in the war. What seemed mandatory to me and what I was ordered to do by authorities and superiors was not good at all, I would have always preferred to have done the opposite. But even if I no longer know the concept of duty, I do know that of guilt - perhaps they are both the same. Because a mother gave birth to me, I am guilty, condemned to live, bound to belong to a state, to be a soldier, to kill, to pay armament taxes. And now, at this moment, the guilt of life has led me again, as once in the war, to having to kill. And this time I'm not killing with disgust, I've owed myself a debt, I don't mind this stupid, congested world falling to bits, I'm happy to help and I'm happy to perish myself.""","""You bore me. Be so kind as to do your work. Since the conception of duty is unknown to you—"" He was silent and made a movement of his lips as though to spit. Only a little blood came, however, and clung to his chin. ""One moment!"" said Gustav politely. ""The conception of duty is certainly unknown to me—now. Formerly I had a great deal of official concern with it. I was a professor of theology. Besides that, I was a soldier and went through the war. What seemed to me to be duty and what the authorities and my superior officers from time to time enjoined upon me was not by any means good. I would rather have done the opposite. But granting that the conception of duty is no longer known to me, I still know the conception of guilt—perhaps they are the same thing. In so far as a mother bore me, I am guilty. I am condemned to live. I am obliged to belong to a state, to serve as a soldier, to kill and to pay taxes for armaments. And now at this moment the guilt of life has brought me once more to the necessity of killing the people as it did in the war. And this time I have no repugnance. I am resigned to the guilt. I have no objection to this stupid congested world going to bits. I am glad to help and glad to perish with it.""","‘You are starting to bore me. Be so kind as to finish your task. If duty means nothing to you …’ He fell silent, tightening his lips as if intending to spit, but all that emerged from his mouth was a trickle of blood that stuck on his chin. ‘Wait,’ Gustav said politely. ‘It is true the concept of duty means nothing to me, not now at any rate, but it once concerned me a great deal in my official capacity as a professor of theology. What’s more, I was a soldier, serving in the war. Yet what I considered my duty, and all the things I was ordered to do, whether by figures in authority or my superior officers, was anything but good. In every case I would have preferred to do the opposite. However, even if duty has no meaning for me now, I do recognize the concept of guilt. Perhaps they amount to the same thing. By being born of a mother I am guilty, condemned to live, obliged to belong to a state, to serve it as a soldier, to kill, to pay taxes in support of armaments. And now, at this moment in time, the guilt that attaches to living has again led me, as it once did in the war, to the point where I have to kill. But this time I don’t find killing repugnant. I have totally accepted the burden of guilt because I have no objection to this stupid, congested world being blown to smithereens. I’m happy to lend a hand, and to perish myself in the process.’"
"Ein Erlebnis, das mir in fünfzig Jahren unbekannt geblieben war, obwohl jeder Backfisch und Student es kennt, wurde mir in dieser Ballnacht zuteil: das Erlebnis des Festes, der Rausch der Festgemeinschaft, das Geheimnis vom Untergang der Person in der Menge, von der Unio mystica der Freude. Oft hatte ich davon sprechen hören, jeder Dienstmagd war es bekannt, und oft hatte ich das Leuchten im Auge der Erzählenden gesehen und hatte immer halb überlegen, halb neidisch dazu gelächelt. Jenes Strahlen in den trunkenen Augen eines Entrückten, eines von sich selbst Erlösten, jenes Lächeln und halb irre Versunkensein dessen, der im Rausch der Gemeinschaft aufgeht, hatte ich hundertmal im Leben an edlen und an gemeinen Beispielen gesehen, an besoffenen Rekruten und Matrosen ebenso wie an großen Künstlern, etwa im Enthusiasmus festlicher Aufführungen, und nicht minder an jungen Soldaten, die in den Krieg zogen, und noch in jüngster Zeit hatte ich dies Strahlen und Lächeln des glücklich Entrückten bewundert, geliebt, bespöttelt und beneidet an meinem Freunde Pablo, wenn er selig im Rausch des Musizierens im Orchester über seinem Saxophon hing oder dem Dirigenten, dem Trommler, dem Mann mit dem Banjo zuschaute, entzückt, ekstatisch. Solch ein Lächeln, solch ein kindhaftes Strahlen, hatte ich zuweilen gedacht, sei nur ganz jungen Menschen möglich oder solchen Völkern, die sich keine starke Individuation und Differenzierung der einzelnen gestatteten. Aber heute, in dieser gesegneten Nacht, strahlte ich selbst, der Steppenwolf Harry, dies Lächeln, schwamm ich selbst in diesem tiefen, kindhaften, märchenhaften Glück, atmete ich selbst diesen süßen Traum und Rausch aus Gemeinschaft, Musik, Rhythmus, Wein und Geschlechtslust, dessen Lobpreis im Ballbericht irgendeines Studenten ich einst so oft mit Spott und armer Überlegenheit mit angehört hatte. Ich war nicht mehr ich, meine Persönlichkeit war aufgelöst im Festrausch wie Salz im Wasser. Ich tanzte mit dieser oder jener Frau, aber nicht nur sie war es, die ich im Arm hatte, deren Haar mich streifte, deren Duft ich einsog, sondern alle, alle die andern Frauen mit, die im selben Saal, im selben Tanz, in derselben Musik wie ich schwammen und deren strahlende Gesichter wie große phantastische Blumen mir vorüberschwebten, alle gehörten mir, allen gehörte ich, alle hatten wir aneinander teil. Und auch die Männer gehörten dazu, auch in ihnen war ich, auch sie waren mir nicht fremd, ihr Lächeln das meine, ihr Werben das meine, meines das ihre.","An experience that had remained unknown to me in fifty years, although every chick and student knows it, was granted to me on this night of the ball: the experience of the festival, the intoxication of the festival community, the secret of the person sinking in the crowd, of the union mystica of joy. I had often heard it spoken of, every maid knew it, and I had often seen the light in the eyes of the storytellers and had always smiled half in contemplation, half enviously. A hundred times in my life I had seen noble and mean examples, in drunken recruits and sailors alike, that radiance in the drunken eyes of someone who had been redeemed by himself, that smile and half-mad absorption of someone who succumbed to the intoxication of the community in great artists, for example in the enthusiasm of festive performances, and no less in young soldiers who went to war, and recently I had admired, loved, ridiculed and envied this radiance and smile of the happily enraptured one in my friend Pablo, when he happily hung over his saxophone in the intoxication of making music in the orchestra or watched the conductor, the drummer, the man with the banjo, delighted, ecstatic. I had sometimes thought that such a smile, such a childlike radiance, was only possible for very young people or peoples who did not allow themselves strong individualization and differentiation. But today, on this blessed night, I myself, Steppenwolf Harry, shone this smile, I myself swam in this deep, childlike, fairytale happiness, I myself breathed this sweet dream and intoxication of community, music, rhythm, wine and sexual lust, whose praise in some student's ball report I had once heard so often with derision and poor superiority. I wasn't myself anymore, my personality was dissolved in the festive frenzy like salt in water. I danced with this or that woman, but it wasn't just her that I held in my arms, whose hair brushed against me, whose scent I inhaled, but all, all the other women who were in the same hall, in the same dance, in to the same music as I was swimming and whose radiant faces floated past me like great fantastic flowers, all belonged to me, I belonged to all, we all shared in one another. And the men were part of it too, I was in them too, they weren't strangers to me either, their smiles were mine, their courtship was mine, mine was theirs.","An experience fell to my lot this night of the Ball that I had never known in all my fifty years, though it is known to every flapper and student—the intoxication of a general festivity, the mysterious merging of the personality in the mass, the mystic union of joy. I had often heard it spoken of. It was known, I knew, to every servant girl. I had often observed the sparkle in the eye of those who told me of it and I had always treated it with a half-superior, half-envious smile. A hundred times in my life I had seen examples of those whom rapture had intoxicated and released from the self, of that smile, that half-crazed absorption, of those whose heads have been turned by a common enthusiasm. I had seen it in drunken recruits and sailors, and also in great artists in the enthusiasm, perhaps, of a musical festival; and not less in young soldiers going to war. Even in recent days I had marveled at and loved and mocked and envied this gleam and this smile in my friend, Pablo, when he hung over his saxophone in the blissful intoxication of playing in the orchestra, or when, enraptured and ecstatic, he looked over to the conductor, the drum, or the man with the banjo. It had sometimes occurred to me that such a smile, such a childlike radiance could be possible only to quite young persons or among those peoples whose customs permitted no marked differences between one individual and another. But today, on this blessed night, I myself, the Steppenwolf, was radiant with this smile. I myself swam in this deep and childlike happiness of a fairy tale. I myself breathed the sweet intoxication of a common dream and of music and rhythm and wine and women—I, who had in other days so often listened with amusement, or dismal superiority, to its panegyric in the ballroom chatter of some student. I was myself no longer. My personality was dissolved in the intoxication of the festivity like salt in water. I danced with this woman or that, but it was not only the one I had in my arms and whose hair brushed my face that belonged to me. All the other women who were dancing in the same room and the same dance and to the same music, and whose radiant faces floated past me like fantastic flowers, belonged to me, and I to them. All of us had a part in one another. And the men too. I was with them also. They, too, were no strangers to me. Their smile was mine, and mine their wooing and theirs mine.","That night of the ball I experienced a sensation which, though familiar to any teenage girl or student, I had not known the like of in all my fifty years. I mean the thrill of a party, the exhilaration that comes from celebrating with others, the mystery of losing one’s identity in the crowd, the unio mystica of joy. I had often heard people talk about it, there wasn’t a servant girl who hadn’t experienced it, and I had frequently seen the gleam in the eyes of those describing it. My response had always been a half supercilious, half envious smile. In the course of my life I must have witnessed that gleam a hundred times: in the eyes of people deep in drunken reverie or freed from all self-restraint; in the semi-deranged smile of someone utterly carried away, absorbed in the euphoric mood of a crowd. I had seen both noble and ignoble instances of it: on the faces of drunken recruits and naval ratings, for example, just as much as those of great artists, say, enthusiastically taking part in performances at a festival, and not less on those of young soldiers going to war. Even very recently I had admired, adored, mocked and envied such a gleam in the eyes and faraway smile on the face of my friend Pablo when, blissfully carried away by the excitement of playing in the band, he was bending over his saxophone or watching the conductor, the drummer or the banjo player with rapt and ecstatic attention. There were times when I had thought it possible only for really young people or nations which didn’t permit individuals to stand out strongly from the tribe to produce smiles like this, childlike, beaming faces of this sort. Yet on this blissful night, here was I myself, I , Harry alias Steppenwolf, with just such a smile on my beaming face. I myself was afloat in this deep, childlike, fairy-tale pool of happiness, breathing this sweet, dreamlike, intoxicating atmosphere composed of communal revelry, music, rhythm, wine and sexual desire. To think that in the past I had so often listened with a disdainful and woefully superior attitude when some student or other, reporting on a ball, was singing the praises of all these things! I was no longer myself. In the heady atmosphere of the festivities my personality had dissolved like salt in water. I was dancing with this or that particular woman, but she was not the only one in my arms, not the only one whose hair brushed against me or whose perfume I inhaled. No, they were all mine, all the other women in the same room, afloat in the same dance as me and the same music, their beaming faces sailing by me like fantastically large flowers. And I was all theirs, we were all part of one another. The men too had a part in everything. They were no strangers to me, I felt part of them as well. Their smiles were mine, the amorous advances they made were mine, and mine theirs."
"Daß der »Mensch« nicht schon Erschaffenes sei, sondern eine Forderung des Geistes, eine ferne, ebenso ersehnte wie gefürchtete Möglichkeit, und daß der Weg dahin immer nur ein kleines Stückchen weit und unter furchtbaren Qualen und Ekstasen zurückgelegt wird, eben von jenen seltenen Einzelnen, denen heute das Schafott, morgen das Ehrendenkmal bereitet wird – dies Ahnen lebt auch im Steppenwolf. Was er aber, im Gegensatz zu seinem »Wolf«, in sich »Mensch« nennt, das ist zum großen Teil nichts andres als eben jener mediokre »Mensch« der Bürgerkonvention. Den Weg zum wahren Menschen, den Weg zu den Unsterblichen kann Harry zwar recht wohl ahnen, geht ihn auch hie und da ein winziges, zögerndes Stückchen weit und bezahlt das mit schweren Leiden, mit schmerzlicher Vereinsamung. Aber jene höchste Forderung, jene echte, vom Geist gesuchte Menschwerdung zu bejahen und anzustreben, den einzigen schmalen Weg zur Unsterblichkeit zu gehen, davor scheut er sich doch in tiefster Seele. Er fühlt recht wohl: das führt zu noch größeren Leiden, zur Ächtung, zum letzten Verzicht, vielleicht zum Schafott – und wenn auch am Ende dieses Weges Unsterblichkeit lockt, so ist er doch nicht gewillt, all diese Leiden zu leiden, alle diese Tode zu sterben. Obwohl ihm vom Ziel der Menschwerdung mehr bewußt ist als den Bürgern, macht er doch die Augen zu und will nicht wissen, daß das verzweifelte Hängen am Ich, das verzweifelte Nichtsterbenwollen der sicherste Weg zum ewigen Tode ist, während Sterbenkönnen, Hüllenabstreifen, ewige Hingabe des Ichs an die Wandlung zur Unsterblichkeit führt. Wenn er seine Lieblinge unter den Unsterblichen anbetet, etwa Mozart, so sieht er ihn letzten Endes doch immer noch mit Bürgeraugen an und ist geneigt, Mozarts Vollendung recht wie ein Schullehrer bloß aus seiner hohen Spezialistenbegabung zu erklären, statt aus der Größe seiner Hingabe und Leidensbereitschaft, seiner Gleichgültigkeit gegen die Ideale der Bürger und dem Erdulden jener äußersten Vereinsamung, die um den Leidenden, den Menschwerdenden alle Bürgeratmosphäre zu eisigem Weltäther verdünnt, jener Vereinsamung im Garten Gethsemane.","That ""man"" is not already created, but a requirement of the spirit, a distant possibility that is as longed for as it is feared, and that the path to it is always covered only a small distance and with terrible torments and ecstasies, precisely by those rare individuals , for whom the scaffold is prepared today, the monument of honor tomorrow – these ancestors also live in Steppenwolf. But what he calls ""man"" in contrast to his ""wolf"" is for the most part nothing other than that mediocre ""man"" of the Citizens' Convention. Harry can sense the path to true man, the path to the immortals, but hesitantly walks it a tiny, hesitant bit here and there and pays for it with severe suffering and painful loneliness. But that highest demand, to affirm that genuine incarnation sought by the spirit and to strive to walk the only narrow path to immortality, he shies away from deep down in his soul. He feels quite well: this leads to even greater suffering, to ostracism, to the last renunciation, perhaps to the scaffold - and even if immortality lures at the end of this path, he is not willing to suffer all this suffering, all this death to die. Although he is more aware of the goal of incarnation than the citizens, he still closes his eyes and does not want to know that desperate clinging to the ego, the desperate not wanting to die is the surest way to eternal death, while being able to die, stripping off the covering, eternal devotion of the ego leads to the transformation to immortality. When he worships his favorite immortals, such as Mozart, he still looks at him with the eyes of a bourgeois and is inclined, like a school teacher, to explain Mozart's perfection solely from his high specialist talent, instead of from the greatness of his devotion and willingness to suffer , his indifference to the ideals of the bourgeoisie and the enduring of that extreme loneliness that dilutes all bourgeois atmosphere to icy cosmic ether around those who are suffering, those who are becoming human, that loneliness in the Garden of Gethsemane.","That man is not yet a finished creation but rather a challenge of the spirit; a distant possibility dreaded as much as it is desired; that the way towards it has only been covered for a very short distance and with terrible agonies and ecstasies even by those few for whom it is the scaffold today and the monument tomorrow—all this the Steppenwolf, too, suspected. What, however, he calls the ""man"" in himself, as opposed to the wolf, is to a great extent nothing else than this very same average man of the bourgeois convention. As for the way to true manhood, the way to the immortals, he has, it is true, an inkling of it and starts upon it now and then for a few hesitating steps and pays for them with much suffering and many pangs of loneliness. But as for striving with assurance, in response to that supreme demand, towards the genuine manhood of the spirit, and going the one narrow way to immortality, he is deeply afraid of it. He knows too well that it leads to still greater sufferings, to proscription, to the last renunciation, perhaps to the scaffold, and even though the enticement of immortality lies at the journey's end, he is still unwilling to suffer all these sufferings and to die all these deaths. Though the goal of manhood is better known to him than to the bourgeois, still he shuts his eyes. He is resolved to forget that the desperate clinging to the self and the desperate clinging to life are the surest way to eternal death, while the power to die, to strip one's self naked, and the eternal surrender of the self bring immortality with them. When he worships his favorites among the immortals, Mozart, perchance, he always looks at him in the long run through bourgeois eyes. His tendency is to explain Mozart's perfected being, just as a schoolmaster would, as a supreme and special gift rather than as the outcome of his immense powers of surrender and suffering, of his indifference to the ideals of the bourgeois, and of his patience under that last extremity of loneliness which rarefies the atmosphere of the bourgeois world to an ice-cold ether, around those who suffer to become men, that loneliness of the Garden of Gethsemane.","‘Human beings’ are not already created entities but ideal figures that spirit demands we should strive to become, remote possibilities that are both longed for and feared. The road leading to them can only ever be covered in very short stages, accompanied by terrible experiences of torment and ecstasy. And those advancing along it are precisely the rare individuals for whom the scaffold is made ready today, the monument in their honour tomorrow. All these truths Steppenwolf is dimly aware of. However, what he calls ‘human being’ in himself, as opposed to ‘wolf’, is for the most part nothing more than that mediocre ‘human being’ of respectable bourgeois convention. Harry does instinctively sense which road to take to become a true human being, the road that leads to the Immortals; indeed now and then he hesitantly advances a tiny bit of the way along it, paying the price in terms of intense suffering and painful isolation. Yet in the depths of his being he is afraid to face the highest of all challenges posed by spirit: that of striving to become fully human, and venturing along the sole narrow road leading to immortality. He senses only too clearly that this route leads to even greater suffering, to the life of an outcast, to the ultimate sacrifice, perhaps to the scaffold. And for this reason, even though the prize that beckons at the end of the road is immortality, he is unwilling to suffer all these ills, to die all these deaths. Though he is much more aware than the average bourgeois of what becoming truly human entails, he still closes his eyes to the truth, refusing to acknowledge that clinging desperately to the notion of self, desperately wanting not to die, is the surest route to eternal death. On the other hand, the ability to die, to slough off one’s skin like a snake, to commit oneself to incessant self-transformation is what leads the way to immortality. If Harry worships his favourites among the Immortals, for example Mozart, it is because he is still seeing him through bourgeois eyes, tending to explain the composer’s consummate art, just as a schoolmaster would, in terms of highly specialized talent. He thus ignores Mozart’s commitment, his willingness to suffer, his indifference to all bourgeois ideals, and his ability to endure the kind of extreme isolation that transforms the bourgeois atmosphere surrounding those suffering in the process of becoming fully human into the much thinner, ice-cold air of the cosmos. This is the isolation of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane."

"»Sie haben, Herr von Goethe, gleich allen großen Geistern die Fragwürdigkeit, die Hoffnungslosigkeit des Menschenlebens deutlich erkannt und gefühlt: die Herrlichkeit des Augenblicks und sein elendes Verwelken, die Unmöglichkeit, eine schöne Höhe des Gefühls anders zu bezahlen als durch die Kerkerhaft des Alltags, die brennende Sehnsucht nach dem Reich des Geistes, die mit der ebenso brennenden und ebenso heiligen Liebe zur verlornen Unschuld der Natur in ewigem tödlichem Kampfe liegt, dies ganze furchtbare Schweben im Leeren und Ungewissen, dies Verurteiltsein zum Vergänglichen, niemals Vollgültigen, ewig Versuchhaften und Dilettantischen – kurz, die ganze Aussichtslosigkeit, Verstiegenheit und brennende Verzweiflung des Menschseins. Dies alles haben Sie gekannt, sich je und je auch dazu bekannt, und dennoch haben Sie mit Ihrem ganzen Leben das Gegenteil gepredigt, haben Glauben und Optimismus geäußert, haben sich und andern eine Dauer und einen Sinn unsrer geistigen Anstrengungen vorgespielt. Sie haben die Bekenner der Tiefe, die Stimmen der verzweifelten Wahrheit abgelehnt und unterdrückt, in sich selbst ebenso wie in Kleist und Beethoven. Sie haben jahrzehntelang so getan, als sei das Anhäufen von Wissen, von Sammlungen, das Schreiben und Sammeln von Briefen, als sei Ihre ganze Weimarer Altersexistenz in der Tat ein Weg, um den Augenblick zu verewigen, den Sie doch nur mumifizieren konnten, um die Natur zu vergeistigen, die Sie doch nur zur Maske stilisieren konnten. Das ist die Unaufrichtigkeit, die wir Ihnen vorwerfen.«","""You, Herr von Goethe, like all great minds, clearly recognized and felt the dubiousness and hopelessness of human life: the glory of the moment and its miserable withering, the impossibility of paying for a beautiful height of feeling in any other way than by being in prison in everyday life , the burning longing for the realm of the spirit, which lies in eternal deadly struggle with the equally burning and just as holy love for the lost innocence of nature, this whole terrible hovering in the void and uncertain, this condemnation to the transient, never complete, eternally experimental and Dilettantish - in short, all the hopelessness, extravagance and burning despair of being human. You have known all this, you have always confessed to it, and yet with your whole life you have preached the opposite, you have expressed faith and optimism, you have pretended to yourself and others that our spiritual efforts would endure and make sense. They have rejected and suppressed the confessors of depth, the voices of desperate truth, in themselves as well as in Kleist and Beethoven. For decades you have acted as if accumulating knowledge, collecting, writing and collecting letters, as if your whole life in Weimar in old age was in fact a way to immortalize the moment that you could only mummify, to To spiritualize nature, which you could only stylize into a mask. That is the insincerity we accuse you of.”","""Like all great spirits, Herr von Goethe, you have clearly recognised and felt the riddle and the hopelessness of human life, with its moments of transcendence that sink again to wretchedness, and the impossibility of rising to one fair peak of feeling except at the cost of many days' enslavement to the daily round; and, then, the ardent longing for the realm of the spirit in eternal and deadly war with the equally ardent and holy love of the lost innocence of nature, the whole frightful suspense in vacancy and uncertainty, this condemnation to the transient that can never be valid, that is ever experimental and dilettantish; in short, the utter lack of purpose to which the human state is condemned—to its consuming despair. You have known all this, yes, and said as much over and over again; yet you gave up your whole life to preaching its opposite, giving utterance to faith and optimism and spreading before yourself and others the illusion that our spiritual strivings mean something and endure. You have lent a deaf ear to those that plumbed the depths and suppressed the voices that told the truth of despair, and not in yourself only, but also in Kleist and Beethoven. Year after year you lived on at Weimar accumulating knowledge and collecting objects, writing letters and gathering them in, as though in your old age you had found the real way to discover the eternal in the momentary, though you could only mummify it, and to spiritualise nature though you could only hide it with a pretty mask. This is why we reproach you with insincerity.""","‘Just how problematic and desperate a thing human life is, you, Herr von Goethe, like all great minds, clearly recognized and felt: how the splendour of the moment fades miserably; how it is only possible to experience the heights of emotion at the expense of an everyday life lived in a prison house; how this prison-house routine is the mortal enemy of our equally ardent and equally sacred passion for the lost innocence of nature; all the terrible sense of being left hanging in a void, uncertain about everything and condemned to experience things fleetingly, never to the full but always in an experimental, dilettantish fashion; in short, human existence in all its hopelessness, absurdity and heartfelt despair. You recognized all this, from time to time you even confessed to believing that it was so. Yet you spent your whole life preaching the opposite, expressing faith and optimism, and deluding yourself and others into believing that our intellectual and spiritual endeavours are meaningful and of lasting value. You dismissed those who believed in penetrating to the depths, suppressed those voices speaking the desperate truth, your own voice as well as those of Kleist and Beethoven.7 For decades you acted as if accumulating knowledge and collections of things, writing and hoarding letters, as if the whole life you led in Weimar in your old age really was a way of preserving momentary experiences for all eternity and lending spiritual meaning to things natural. Yet you only succeeded in mummifying the moment and turning nature into a stylized masquerade. That is what we mean when accusing you of dishonesty.’"
"Auf der Treppe, oberhalb der Araukarie, traf ich mit der »Tante« zusammen, meiner Vermieterin, die ich selten zu Gesicht bekam, deren freundliches Wesen mir aber sehr gefiel. Die Begegnung war mir nicht angenehm, ich war immerhin etwas verwahrlost und übernächtig, nicht gekämmt und nicht rasiert. Ich grüßte und wollte vorübergehen. Sonst respektierte sie mein Verlangen nach Alleinbleiben und Nichtbeachtetwerden stets, heut aber schien in der Tat zwischen mir und der Umwelt ein Schleier zerrissen, eine Schranke gefallen zu sein – sie lachte und blieb stehen.","On the stairs, above the araucaria, I met my ""aunt,"" my landlady, whom I rarely saw, but whose friendly manner I liked very much. The encounter was not pleasant for me, I was at least a bit unkempt and sleepy, not combed and not shaved. I said hello and wanted to pass. Otherwise she always respected my desire to remain alone and not to be noticed, but today it seemed that a veil had been torn between me and the world around me, a barrier had fallen - she laughed and stopped.","On the stairs above the araucaria I met the ""aunt,"" my landlady. I saw her seldom but her kindly nature always delighted me. The meeting was not very propitious, for I was still unkempt and uncombed after my night out, and I had not shaved. I greeted her and would have passed on. As a rule, she always respected my desire to live alone and unobserved. Today, however, as it turned out, a veil between me and the outer world seemed to be torn aside, a barrier fallen. She laughed and stopped.","On the staircase, above the araucaria plant, I bumped into the ‘aunt’, my landlady. Although I seldom set eyes on her, I was very fond of the kind soul. I was not best pleased to encounter her now, though. After all, I was bleary-eyed and a bit dishevelled; my hair was unkempt and I hadn’t shaved. I wished her good morning and was on the point of going by. As a rule, she always respected my desire to remain alone and unnoticed, but today it really did seem that between me and the people around me a veil had been torn apart, or a barrier had fallen, for she stopped and laughed."
"»Ich weiß es«, sagte sie nachher, als ich davon sprach, »ich weiß es wohl. Ich werde dich zwar doch noch in mich verliebt machen, aber das hat keine Eile. Vorerst sind wir Kameraden, wir sind Leute, welche Freunde zu werden hoffen, weil wir einander erkannt haben. Jetzt wollen wir beide voneinander lernen und miteinander spielen. Ich zeige dir mein kleines Theater, ich lehre dich tanzen und ein bißchen vergnügt und dumm sein, und du zeigst mir deine Gedanken und etwas von deinem Wissen.«","""I know it,"" she said afterwards when I spoke of it, ""I know it well.

Now we both want to learn from each other and play together.

""I know that well enough. All the same, I shall make you fall in love with me, but there's no use hurrying. First of all we're comrades, two people who hope to be friends, because we have recognised each other. For the present we'll each learn from the other and amuse ourselves together. I show you my little stage, and teach you to dance and to have a little pleasure and be silly; and you show me your thoughts and something of all you know."" ""There's little there to show you, Hermine, I'm afraid.","‘I know,’ she said afterwards when I spoke of this. ‘You don’t need to tell me. I do mean to make you fall in love with me one day, but there is no rush. For the time being we will remain companions. We are two people hoping to become close friends because we have recognized each other for what we are. Let’s now learn from one another, play with one another. I’ll show you my little theatre, I’ll teach you to dance, to experience a bit of happiness and foolishness, and you’ll reveal your ideas to me and some of your knowledge.’"

"Ein Wort Hallers hat mir den Schlüssel zu diesem Verständnis gegeben. Er sagte einmal zu mir, nachdem wir über sogenannte Grausamkeiten im Mittelalter gesprochen hatten: »Diese Grausamkeiten sind in Wirklichkeit keine. Ein Mensch des Mittelalters würde den ganzen Stil unseres heutigen Lebens noch ganz anders als grausam, entsetzlich und barbarisch verabscheuen! Jede Zeit, jede Kultur, jede Sitte und Tradition hat ihren Stil, hat ihre ihr zukommenden Zartheiten und Härten, Schönheiten und Grausamkeiten, hält gewisse Leiden für selbstverständlich, nimmt gewisse Übel geduldig hin. Zum wirklichen Leiden, zur Hölle wird das menschliche Leben nur da, wo zwei Zeiten, zwei Kulturen und Religionen einander überschneiden. Ein Mensch der Antike, der im Mittelalter hätte leben müssen, wäre daran jämmerlich erstickt, ebenso wie ein Wilder inmitten unsrer Zivilisation ersticken müßte. Es gibt nun Zeiten, wo eine ganze Generation so zwischen zwei Zeiten, zwischen zwei Lebensstile hineingerät, daß ihr jede Selbstverständlichkeit, jede Sitte, jede Geborgenheit und Unschuld verlorengeht. Natürlich spürt das nicht ein jeder gleich stark. Eine Natur wie Nietzsche hat das heutige Elend um mehr als eine Generation voraus erleiden müssen – was er einsam und unverstanden auszukosten hatte, das erleiden heute Tausende.«","A word from Haller gave me the key to this understanding. He once said to me after we had talked about so-called atrocities in the Middle Ages: 'These atrocities really aren't. A man of the Middle Ages would detest the whole style of our life today in a very different way than being cruel, horrible and barbaric! Every time, every culture, every custom and tradition has its style, has its due softness and hardship, beauty and cruelty, takes certain sufferings for granted, patiently accepts certain evils. Human life only becomes real suffering, hell, where two times, two cultures and religions overlap. A man of antiquity who should have lived in the Middle Ages would have suffocated miserably, just as a savage would have suffocated in the midst of our civilization. There are times when a whole generation gets so caught up between two times, between two ways of life, that it loses everything it takes for granted, every custom, every sense of security and innocence. Of course, not everyone feels this to the same extent. A nature like Nietzsche had to endure today’s misery more than a generation ahead – what he had to savor lonely and misunderstood, thousands suffer today.«","A remark of Haller's gave me the key to this interpretation. He said to me once when we were talking of the so-called horrors of the Middle Ages: ""These horrors were really nonexistent. A man of the Middle Ages would detest the whole mode of our present-day life as something far more than horrible, far more than barbarous. Every age, every culture, every custom and tradition has its own character, its own weakness and its own strength, its beauties and ugliness; accepts certain sufferings as matters of course, puts up patiently with certain evils. Human life is reduced to real suffering, to hell, only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap. A man of the Classical Age who had to live in medieval times would suffocate miserably just as a savage does in the midst of our civilisation. Now there are times when a whole generation is caught in this way between two ages, two modes of life, with the consequence that it loses all power to understand itself and has no standard, no security, no simple acquiescence. Naturally, every one does not feel this equally strongly. A nature such as Nietzsche's had to suffer our present ills more than a generation in advance. What he had to go through alone and misunderstood, thousands suffer today.""","The key to my understanding was provided by some remarks of Haller. Once, when we had been discussing so-called acts of cruelty in the Middle Ages, he said to me: ‘What we think of as acts of cruelty are in reality nothing of the kind. Someone from the Middle Ages would still find the whole style of our present-day life abhorrent, but cruel, horrifying and barbaric in a quite different way. Every age, every culture, every ethos and tradition has a style of its own, has the varieties of gentleness and harshness, of beauty and cruelty that are appropriate to it. Each age will take certain kinds of suffering for granted, will patiently accept certain wrongs. Human life becomes a real hell of suffering only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap. Required to live in the Middle Ages, someone from the Graeco-Roman period would have died a wretched death by suffocation, just as a savage inevitably would in the midst our civilization. Now, there are times when a whole generation gets caught to such an extent between two eras, two styles of life, that nothing comes naturally to it since it has lost all sense of morality, security and innocence. A man of Nietzsche’s mettle had to endure our present misery more than a generation in advance. Today, thousands are enduring what he had to suffer alone and without being understood.’"

"»Ach was, das ist Geschmacksache, wir werden uns das dann draußen überlegen. Aber nein, warte mal, ich bin mehr dafür, daß wir die andere Partei wählen, wenn es auch im Grunde natürlich ganz egal ist. Ich bin Theolog, und mein Vorfahr Luther hat seinerzeit den Fürsten und Reichen gegen die Bauern geholfen, das wollen wir jetzt ein bißchen korrigieren. Schlechter Wagen, hoffentlich hält er’s noch ein paar Kilometer aus!«","""Oh, that's a matter of taste, we'll think about it outside then. But no, wait a minute, I'm more in favor of us voting the other party, although of course it doesn't really matter at all. I'm a theologian, and my ancestor Luther helped the princes and rich against the peasants, we want to correct that a bit now. Bad car, hopefully it can last a few more kilometers!«","""Oh, Lord, that's a matter of taste, so we can leave it out of account—though now you mention it , I rather think we might take the other side, since at bottom it's all the same, of course. I'm a theologian and my predecessor, Luther, took the side of the princes and plutocrats against the peasants. So now we'll establish the balance a little. This rotten car, I hope it'll hold out another mile or two.""","‘Don’t ask me, it’s just a matter of taste. We can worry about that once we’re out of town. But no, hang on. If anything, I think we should opt for the other side, even though it basically makes no difference, of course.

"Mit dem Blick noch bei der Orchidee, verstummte sie, ihr Gesicht entspannte sich, wie eine aufgehende Blumenknospe entrollte es sich aus Druck und Spannung, und plötzlich stand ein entzückendes Lächeln auf ihren Lippen, während die Augen noch einen Augenblick starr und gebannt blieben. Und jetzt schüttelte sie den Kopf mit der kleinen Bubenlocke, trank einen Schluck Wasser, sah plötzlich wieder, daß wir beim Essen waren und fiel mit freudigem Appetit über die Speisen her.","Still staring at the orchid, she fell silent, her face relaxed, uncurling from pressure and tension like an opening flower bud, and suddenly a delightful smile graced her lips, while her eyes remained fixed and fixed for a moment. And now she shook her head with the little curly hair, drank a sip of water, suddenly saw again that we were eating and tacked on the food with a joyful appetite.","When she came to the end her eyes were still on the orchid, and her face relaxed, losing its strain like a flower bud unfolding its petals. In an instant there was an enchanting smile on her lips while her eyes for a moment were still fixed and spellbound. Then she gave a shake of her head with its little boyish lock, took a sip of water, and realizing of a sudden that we were at a meal fell to eating again with appetite and enjoyment.","Still gazing at the orchid, she fell silent. Her face relaxed and, like the bud of a flower unfolding its petals, all pressure and tension went from it. Suddenly there was a delightful smile on her lips, whereas her eyes, as if spellbound, remained frozen for a moment. And now she shook her head with its little boyish curl and, taking a sip of water, suddenly became aware again of being in the middle of a meal and tucked into the food with a gleeful appetite."
"Wen Maria eigentlich liebe, darüber dachte ich oftmals nach. Am meisten, glaube ich, liebte sie den Jüngling Pablo vom Saxophon, mit den verlorenen schwarzen Augen und den langen, bleichen, edlen und melancholischen Händen. Ich hätte diesen Pablo in der Liebe für etwas schläfrig, verwöhnt und passiv gehalten, aber Maria versicherte mir, daß er zwar nur langsam in Glut zu bringen, dann aber gespannter, härter, männlicher und fordernder sei als irgendein Boxer oder Herrenreiter. Und so erfuhr und wußte ich Geheimes über diesen und jenen, vom Jazzmusiker, vom Schauspieler, von manchen Frauen, von Mädchen und Männern unsres Milieus, wußte allerlei Geheimnisse, sah unter der Oberfläche Verbindungen und Feindschaften, wurde langsam (ich, der ich in dieser Welt ein völlig beziehungsloser Fremdkörper gewesen war) vertraut und einbezogen. Auch über Hermine erfuhr ich viel. Besonders aber kam ich nun häufig mit Herrn Pablo zusammen, den Maria sehr liebte. Zuweilen brauchte sie auch von seinen geheimen Mitteln, auch mir verschaffte sie je und je diese Genüsse, und immer stand Pablo mir mit besonderem Eifer zu Diensten. Einmal sagte er es mir ohne Umschweife: »Sie sind so viel unglücklich, das ist nicht gut, man soll nicht so sein. Tut mir leid. Nehmen Sie leichte Opiumpfeife.« Mein Urteil über diesen frohen, klugen, kindlichen und dabei unergründlichen Menschen änderte sich beständig, wir wurden Freunde, nicht selten nahm ich etwas von seinen Mitteln an. Etwas belustigt sah er meiner Verliebtheit in Maria zu. Einmal veranstaltete er ein »Fest« auf seinem Zimmer, der Mansarde eines Vorstadthotels. Es gab dort nur einen Stuhl, Maria und ich mußten auf dem Bett sitzen. Er gab uns zu trinken, einen aus drei Fläschchen zusammengegossenen, geheimnisvollen, wunderbaren Likör. Und dann, als ich sehr guter Laune geworden war, schlug er uns leuchtenden Auges vor, eine Liebesorgie zu dreien zu feiern. Ich lehnte brüsk ab, mir war dergleichen nicht möglich, doch schielte ich immerhin einen Augenblick zu Maria hinüber, wie sie sich dazu verhalte, und obwohl sie meiner Ablehnung sofort zustimmte, sah ich doch das Glimmen in ihren Augen und spürte ihr Bedauern über den Verzicht. Pablo war enttäuscht über meine Ablehnung, aber nicht verletzt. »Schade«, sagte er, »Harry bedenkt zuviel moralisch. Nichts zu machen. Wäre doch so schön gewesen, so sehr schön! Aber ich weiß Ersatz.« Wir bekamen jeder einige Züge Opium zu rauchen, und regungslos sitzend, bei offenen Augen, erlebten wir alle drei die von ihm suggerierte Szene, wobei Maria vor Entzücken zitterte. Als ich mich nachher ein wenig unwohl fühlte, legte mich Pablo aufs Bett, gab mir einige Tropfen Medizin, und als ich für einige Minuten die Augen schloß, spürte ich auf jedem Augenlid einen ganz flüchtigen, gehauchten Kuß. Ich nahm ihn hin, als sei ich der Meinung, er komme von Maria. Aber ich wußte wohl, daß er von ihm war.","I often thought about whom Maria actually loves. I think she loved most of all the youth Pablo on the saxophone, with the lost black eyes and the long, pale, noble and melancholy hands. I would have thought this Pablo a little sleepy, spoiled and passive in love, but Maria assured me that although he was slow to get hot, he was more tense, harder, more manly and more demanding than any boxer or gentleman's rider. And so I learned and knew secrets about this and that, from jazz musicians, from actors, from some women, from girls and men in our milieu, knew all sorts of secrets, saw connections and hostilities under the surface, slowly (I, who I am in this world had been a completely unrelated foreign body) familiar and involved. I also learned a lot about Hermione. In particular, I now frequently met Mr. Pablo, whom Maria loved very much. From time to time she also used some of his secret remedies, she always procured these pleasures for me too, and Pablo was always at my service with particular zeal. Once he said it to me straight out: 'You are so unhappy, it's not good, you shouldn't be like that. Sorry. Take a light opium pipe.' My opinion of this happy, clever, childlike and at the same time unfathomable man was constantly changing, we became friends, and I often took some of his means. He watched my infatuation with Maria with some amusement. Once he threw a ""party"" in his room, the garret of a suburban hotel. There was only one chair, Maria and I had to sit on the bed. He gave us something to drink, a mysterious, wonderful liqueur poured together from three little bottles. And then, when I was in a very good mood, he suggested with shining eyes that we celebrate a love orgy for three. I brusquely declined, I couldn't do that, but I glanced at Maria for a moment to see how she felt about it, and although she immediately agreed to my refusal, I saw the gleam in her eyes and sensed her regret at having to give up . Pablo was disappointed by my refusal, but not hurt. 'Pity,' he said, 'Harry thinks too much morally. Nothing to do. It would have been so nice, so very nice! But I know substitutes.' We were each given a few puffs of opium, and sitting motionless, eyes open, all three of us experienced the scene he had suggested, with Maria trembling with delight. Afterwards, when I felt a little uncomfortable, Pablo laid me on the bed, gave me a few drops of medicine, and when I closed my eyes for a few minutes, I felt a very light, breathy kiss on each eyelid. I accepted it as if I thought it came from Maria. But I knew well that it was from him.","I often wondered who it was whom Maria really loved. I think she loved the young Pablo of the saxophone, with his melancholy black eyes and his long, white, distinguished, melancholy hands. I should have thought Pablo a somewhat sleepy lover, spoiled and passive, but Maria assured me that though it took a long time to wake him up he was then more strenuous and forward and virile than prize fighter or riding master. In this way I got to know many secrets about this person and that, jazz musicians, actors and many of the women and girls and men of our circle. I saw beneath the surface of the various alliances and enmities and by degrees (though I had been such an entire stranger to this world) I was drawn in and treated with confidence. I learned a good deal about Hermine, too. It was of Herr Pablo, however, of whom Maria was fond, that I saw the most. At times she, too, availed herself of his secret drugs and was forever procuring these delights for me also; and Pablo was always most markedly on the alert to be of service to me. Once he said to me without more ado: ""You are so very unhappy. That is bad. One shouldn't be like that. It makes me sorry. Try a mild pipe of opium. "" My opinion of this jolly, intelligent, childlike and, at the same time, unfathomable person gradually changed. We became friends, and I often took some of his specifics. He looked on at my affair with Maria with some amusement. Once he entertained us in his room on the top floor of an hotel in the suburbs. There was only one chair, so Maria and I had to sit on the bed. He gave us a drink from three little bottles, a mysterious and wonderful draught. And then when I had got into a very good humor, he proposed, with beaming eyes, to celebrate a love orgy for three. I declined abruptly. Such a thing was inconceivable to me. Nevertheless I stole a glance at Maria to see how she took it, and though she at once backed up my refusal I saw the gleam in her eyes and observed that the renunciation cost her some regret. Pablo was disappointed by my refusal but not hurt. "" Pity,"" he said. ""Harry is too morally minded. Nothing to be done. All the same it would have been so beautiful, so very beautiful! But I've got another idea."" He gave us each a little opium to smoke, and sitting motionless with open eyes we all three lived through the scenes that he suggested to us while Maria trembled with delight. As I felt a little unwell after this, Pablo laid me on the bed and gave me some drops, and while I lay with closed eyes I felt the fleeting breath of a kiss on each eyelid. I took the kiss as though I believed it came from Maria, but I knew very well it came from him.","I often wondered who it was Maria really loved. I think of all people she loved youthful Pablo the most, he of the saxophone, the dreamy black eyes and the long, pale, noble and melancholy hands. I would have judged Pablo to be a rather languid, spoiled and passive lover but Maria assured me that, though it took a long time, once aroused, he was rougher, more muscular, masculine and demanding than any boxer or horseman. In this way I got to know intimate details of this or that person: the jazz musician, the actor, women, girls, men from our milieu. I knew all sorts of secrets, had insight into alliances and enmities that lay beneath the surface, was slowly initiated into and became familiar with this world in which I had been a completely alien presence with no links whatsoever to anyone. About Hermione too I learned a great deal, but above all I was now in frequent contact with Herr Pablo, whom Maria loved very much. She also used his secret substances from time to time, occasionally procuring these delights for me too, and Pablo was always ready, indeed especially keen, to oblige me. Once he told me in no uncertain terms: ‘You are unhappy so much of the time. Nobody should be like that, it’s not good. I’m sorry for you. Try smoking a little opium.’ My opinion of this cheerful, clever, childlike and yet unfathomable human being was constantly changing. We became friends, and not infrequently I accepted some of the drugs he had on offer. It was with a degree of amusement that he observed my infatuation with Maria. Once he organized a ‘party’ in his room up in the attic of a hotel in the suburbs. Since there was only one chair, Maria and I had to sit on the bed. To drink, he served us a mysterious, wonderful liqueur he had mixed from the contents of three small bottles. And, once I was feeling in a really good mood, he suggested, his eyes sparkling, that the three of us should have an orgy. Abruptly refusing, since for me that sort of thing was out of the question, I nevertheless cast a brief sidelong glance at Maria, wondering what her attitude might be. She did, like me, immediately say no, but I could sense from the glint in her eyes that this was an opportunity she was sorry to miss. Pablo was disappointed by my refusal, but he didn’t take offence. ‘Pity,’ he said. ‘Harry has too many moral scruples. It can’t be helped, yet it would have been so beautiful, so very beautiful. However, I know something we can do instead.’ Each of us now got to take a few pulls on a pipe Pablo had filled with opium. Sitting motionless, our eyes open, all three of us underwent the experience he had suggested, Maria trembling with delight. Afterwards, when I felt slightly unwell, Pablo laid me on the bed and gave me a few drops of medicine. And as I closed my eyes for a few minutes, I felt the briefest and faintest touch of lips on each eyelid. As if believing that the kisses came from Maria, I let it happen, but I knew full well they came from him."
"Der Morgen gähnte schon durch die Scheiben, der bleierne, verdammte Morgen eines Winterregentages, als ich endlich zu Bett kam. Ins Bett nahm ich meinen Entschluß mit. Ganz zu äußerst aber, an der letzten Grenze des Bewußtseins im Augenblick des Einschlafens, blitzte sekundenschnell jene merkwürdige Stelle des Steppenwolfbüchleins vor mir auf, wo von den »Unsterblichen« die Rede war, und damit verband sich die aufzuckende Erinnerung daran, daß ich manche Male und erst noch ganz vor kurzem mich den Unsterblichen nah genug gefühlt hatte, um in einem Takt alter Musik die ganze kühle, helle, hart lächelnde Weisheit der Unsterblichen mitzukosten. Das tauchte auf, glänzte, erlosch, und schwer wie ein Berg legte sich der Schlaf auf meine Stirn.","The morning was already yawning through the windows, the leaden, damn morning of a winter rainy day, when I finally got to bed. I took my decision with me to bed. But in a very extreme way, at the ultimate limit of consciousness at the moment of falling asleep, that strange passage in the Steppenwolf booklet flashed before me in a matter of seconds, where there was talk of the ""immortals,"" and this was linked to the flashing memory that I had sometimes and only very recently had felt close enough to the immortals to taste all the cool, bright, hard-smiling wisdom of the immortals in a bar of ancient music. It appeared, shone, went out, and sleep settled on my forehead, heavy as a mountain.","Daylight was dawning through the window panes, the leaden, infernal daylight of a rainy winter's day, when at last I got to bed. I took my resolution to bed with me.

With it came the enchanting recollection that several times, the last quite recently, I had felt near enough to the immortals to share in one measure of old music their cool, bright, austere and yet smiling wisdom. The memory of it soared, shone out, then died away; and heavy as a mountain, sleep descended on my brain.","When I finally got to bed, morning was already gaping in through the window panes, the leaden morning, curse it, of a rainy winter’s day.

"Während er dies sagte, lächelte er ganz durchtrieben, geradezu schlingelhaft. Seine Gestalt war größer geworden, die steife Haltung und die krampfhafte Würde im Gesicht war verschwunden.

"Eines solchen Ausspruches, welcher aber nicht einmal ein Ausspruch war, sondern lediglich in einem Blick bestand, erinnere ich mich aus der letzten Zeit seines Hierseins. Da hatte ein berühmter Geschichtsphilosoph und Kulturkritiker, ein Mann von europäischem Namen, einen Vortrag in der Aula angekündigt, und es war mir gelungen, den Steppenwolf, der erst gar keine Lust dazu hatte, zum Besuch des Vortrags zu überreden. Wir gingen zusammen hin und saßen im Hörsaal nebeneinander. Als der Redner seine Kanzel bestieg und seine Ansprache begann, enttäuschte er manche Zuhörer, welche eine Art von Propheten in ihm vermutet hatten, durch die etwas geschniegelte und eitle Art seines Auftretens. Als er nun zu reden begann und zum Beginn den Zuhörern einige Schmeicheleien sagte und für ihr zahlreiches Erscheinen dankte, da warf mir der Steppenwolf einen ganz kurzen Blick zu, einen Blick der Kritik über diese Worte und über die ganze Person des Redners, o, einen unvergeßlichen und furchtbaren Blick, über dessen Bedeutung man ein ganzes Buch schreiben könnte! Der Blick kritisierte nicht bloß jenen Redner und machte den berühmten Mann durch seine zwingende, obwohl sanfte Ironie zunichte, das war das Wenigste daran. Der Blick war viel eher traurig als ironisch, er war sogar abgründig und hoffnungslos traurig; eine stille, gewissermaßen sichere, gewissermaßen schon Gewohnheit und Form gewordene Verzweiflung war der Inhalt dieses Blickes. Er durchleuchtete mit seiner verzweifelten Helligkeit nicht bloß die Person des eitlen Redners, ironisierte und erledigte die Situation des Augenblicks, die Erwartung und Stimmung des Publikums, den etwas anmaßenden Titel der angekündigten Ansprache – nein, der Blick des Steppenwolfes durchdrang unsre ganze Zeit, das ganze betriebsame Getue, die ganze Streberei, die ganze Eitelkeit, das ganze oberflächliche Spiel einer eingebildeten, seichten Geistigkeit – ach, und leider ging der Blick noch tiefer, ging noch viel weiter als bloß auf Mängel und Hoffnungslosigkeiten unsrer Zeit, unsrer Geistigkeit, unsrer Kultur. Er ging bis ins Herz alles Menschentums, er sprach beredt in einer einzigen Sekunde den ganzen Zweifel eines Denkers, eines vielleicht Wissenden aus an der Würde, am Sinn des Menschenlebens überhaupt. Dieser Blick sagte: »Schau, solche Affen sind wir! Schau, so ist der Mensch!« und alle Berühmtheit, alle Gescheitheit, alle Errungenschaften des Geistes, alle Anläufe zu Erhabenheit, Größe und Dauer im Menschlichen fielen zusammen und waren ein Affenspiel!","I remember such a statement from the last time he was here, which wasn't even a statement, but merely consisted of a look. A famous philosopher of history and culture critic, a man of European renown, had announced a lecture in the auditorium, and I had succeeded in persuading Steppenwolf, who had no desire at all, to attend the lecture. We went together and sat next to each other in the lecture hall. As the speaker mounted his pulpit and began his discourse, he disappointed some listeners, who had suspected him of some sort of prophet, by the somewhat slick and vain manner of his manner. When he began to speak and at the beginning he flattered the listeners and thanked them for coming, Steppenwolf gave me a very brief look, a critical look at these words and at the whole person of the speaker, oh, one unforgettable and horrible sight, about the meaning of which one could write a whole book! The look didn't just criticize that speaker and annihilate the famous man with its compelling though gentle irony, that was the least of it. The look was sad rather than ironic, even abysmal and hopelessly sad; a quiet, to a certain extent secure, to a certain extent already habitual and formal despair was the content of this look. With his desperate brightness he not only shone through the person of the vain speaker, ironized and dealt with the situation of the moment, the expectations and mood of the audience, the somewhat presumptuous title of the announced speech - no, the Steppenwolf's gaze penetrated our entire time, the whole busy fuss, all the striving, all the vanity, all the superficial play of an imaginary, shallow spirituality - oh, and unfortunately the view went even deeper, went much further than just the shortcomings and hopelessness of our time, our spirituality, our culture. He went to the heart of all humanity, he eloquently expressed in a single second all the doubts of a thinker, of someone who might know, about the dignity, about the meaning of human life in general. That look said, ""Look, we're such monkeys! Look, such is man!' and all fame, all cleverness, all achievements of the spirit, all attempts at sublimity, greatness and permanence in the human fell together and were a monkey game!","I remember an instance of this in the last days he was here, if I can call a mere fleeting glance he gave me an example of what I mean. It was when a celebrated historian, philosopher, and critic, a man of European fame, had announced a lecture in the school auditorium. I had succeeded in persuading the Steppenwolf to attend it, though at first he had little desire to do so. We went together and sat next to each other in the lecture hall. When the lecturer ascended the platform and began his address, many of his hearers, who had expected a sort of prophet, were disappointed by his rather dapper appearance and conceited air. And when he proceeded, by way of introduction, to say a few flattering things to the audience, thanking them for their attendance in such numbers, the Steppenwolf threw me a quick look, a look which criticized both the words and the speaker of them—an unforgettable and frightful look which spoke volumes! It was a look that did not simply criticize the lecturer, annihilating the famous man with its delicate but crushing irony. That was the least of it. It was more sad than ironical; it was indeed utterly and hopelessly sad; it conveyed a quiet despair, born partly of conviction, partly of a mode of thought which had become habitual with him. This despair of his not only unmasked the conceited lecturer and dismissed with its irony the matter at hand, the expectant attitude of the public, the somewhat presumptuous title under which the lecture was announced—no, the Steppenwolf's look pierced our whole epoch, its whole overwrought activity, the whole surge and strife, the whole vanity, the whole superficial play of a shallow, opinionated intellectuality. And alas! the look went still deeper, went far below the faults, defects and hopelessness of our time, our intellect, our culture alone. It went right to the heart of all humanity , it bespoke eloquently in a single second the whole despair of a thinker, of one who knew the full worth and meaning of man's life. It said: ""See what monkeys we are! Look, such is man!"" and at once all renown, all intelligence, all the attainments of the spirit, all progress towards the sublime, the great and the enduring in man fell away and became a monkey's trick!","I recall one such utterance from the last days of his stay with us, even though it wasn’t even an utterance as such, but merely a look. A famous philosopher of history and cultural critic, a man with a big name throughout Europe, had announced a lecture in the great hall of the university, and I had managed to persuade Steppenwolf to go to it, though at first he had no desire to do so. We attended it together, sitting next to each other in the lecture theatre. When the speaker mounted the podium and began his address, many in the audience, supposing him to be some sort of prophet, were disappointed by the rather polished and vain appearance he presented. And when, by way of introduction, he then made flattering remarks about the audience, thanking them for coming in such numbers, Steppenwolf cast a fleeting glance at me, a look critical of these remarks and of the speaker’s whole person. And what a look it was! So unforgettable and terrible, you could write a whole book about its significance. His look wasn’t just criticizing that particular speaker, reducing the famous man to ruins with its compelling though gentle irony. That was the least of it. It was a look of sadness much more than irony. What is more, it was immeasurably and desperately sad, its content a quiet despair which, to a certain extent, it had become habitual for him to express in this form. Such was the clarity of this despairing look that it was able at one and the same time to show up the speaker in all his vanity, to cast the present situation in an ironic light, to dash the expectations and mood of the audience and pour scorn on the rather pretentious title of the advertised lecture. But that was by no means all it did. No, Steppenwolf’s look penetrated our whole age. It saw through all its hustle and bustle, all its pushy ambition, all its conceitedness, the whole superficial comedy of its shallow, self-important intellectualism. And sad to say, his look penetrated deeper still, well beyond the mere deficiencies and hopeless inadequacies of our age, our intellectualism and our culture. It went right to the heart of all things human. In a single second it eloquently expressed all the scepticism of a thinker – and perhaps of one in the know – as to the dignity and meaning of human life as such. His look seemed to say: ‘Don’t you see what apes we are? That’s what human beings are like, just take a look!’ and all celebrity, all cleverness, all intellectual achievements, all humanity’s attempts to create something sublime, great and enduring were reduced to a fairground farce."

"Ich hielt meinen Becher fest, den die Wirtin mir wieder füllen wollte, und stand auf. Ich brauchte keinen Wein mehr. Die goldne Spur war aufgeblitzt, ich war ans Ewige erinnert, an Mozart, an die Sterne. Ich konnte wieder für eine Stunde atmen, konnte leben, durfte dasein, brauchte nicht Qualen zu leiden, mich nicht zu fürchten, mich nicht zu schämen.","I held onto my mug, which the landlady wanted to refill for me, and got up. I didn't need any more wine. The golden trail had flashed, I was reminded of eternity, of Mozart, of the stars. I could breathe again for an hour, could live, was allowed to exist, didn't have to suffer torments, didn't have to be afraid, didn't have to be ashamed.","I held my hand over my glass when the landlady wanted to fill it once more, and got up. I needed no more wine. The golden trail was blazed and I was reminded of the eternal, and of Mozart, and the stars. For an hour I could breathe once more and live and face existence, without the need to suffer torment, fear, or shame.","Holding on tight to the glass the landlady was about to refill for me, I stood up. I didn’t need any more wine. The golden trace had suddenly lit up, reminding me of things eternal, of Mozart, of the stars. For an hour I was able to breathe again, to live, allowed to exist without suffering agonies, being afraid or feeling ashamed."
"Eine große Pinie stand am Weg, und oben in der Pinie sahen wir aus Brettern etwas wie eine Hütte gebaut, einen Auslug und Hochstand. Hell lachte Gustav mich an, aus den blauen Augen listig zwinkernd, und eilig stiegen wir beide aus unsrem Wagen und kletterten am Stamm empor, verbargen uns tief atmend im Auslug, der uns sehr gefiel. Wir fanden dort Flinten, Pistolen, Kisten mit Patronen. Und kaum hatten wir uns ein wenig gekühlt und im Jagdstand eingerichtet, da klang schon von der nächsten Kurve her heiser und herrschgierig die Hupe eines großen Luxuswagens, der fuhr schnurrend mit hoher Geschwindigkeit auf der blanken Bergstraße daher. Wir hatten schon die Flinten in der Hand. Es war wunderbar spannend.","A large pine tree stood by the way, and up in the pine tree we saw something like a hut built out of boards, a lookout and a shelter. Gustav laughed brightly at me, his blue eyes twinkling slyly, and we both hurriedly got out of our car and climbed up the trunk, breathing deeply and hiding in the view, which we liked very much. We found shotguns, pistols, boxes of cartridges there. And as soon as we had cooled down a bit and settled into the hunting booth, the horn of a large luxury car rang hoarsely and imperiously from the next corner, purring along the bare mountain road at high speed. We already had the guns in our hands. It was wonderfully exciting.","A tall pine grew by the roadside, and among the tall branches we saw something like a little hut made of boards to serve as an outlook and point of vantage. Gustav smiled with a knowing twinkle in his blue eyes. We hurried out of the car, climbed up the trunk and, breathing hard, concealed ourselves in the outlook post, which pleased us much. We found rifles and revolvers there and boxes of ammunition. We had scarcely cooled down when we heard the hoarse imperious horn of a big luxury car from the next bend of the road. It came purring at top speed up the smooth road. Our rifles were ready in our hands. The excitement was intense.","Just you watch.’ There was a large pine tree by the roadside, and high up in it we could see something like a hut made of planks, a raised stand with a lookout. Smiling brightly, Gustav gave me a sly wink with those blue eyes of his and we both hurriedly got out of our truck. Clambering up the trunk of the pine, we hid ourselves, gasping for breath, in the lookout. It was an ideal spot. We found shotguns, pistols and boxes of cartridges there. And we scarcely had time to cool off and settle down in this shooting box before we heard the hoarse, domineering sound of a car’s horn as it approached the nearest bend. It was a huge limousine, its engine humming as it drove at high speed along the smooth mountain road. We already had hold of the shotguns. The excitement was wonderful."
"Merkwürdig war der Blick, mit dem Hermine mich nun ansah, ein Blick voll Belustigung, voll Spott und Schelmerei und verständnisvoller Kameradschaft und zugleich so voll Schwere, Wissen und abgründigem Ernst!","Strange was the look Hermione gave me now, a look full of amusement, full of mockery and mischievousness and understanding camaraderie and at the same time so full of heaviness, knowledge and abysmal seriousness!","Remarkable the look that Hermine now gave me, a look full of amusement, full of irony and roguishness and fellow feeling, and at the same time so grave, so wise, so unfathomably serious.","The look Hermione now gave me was remarkable, full of amusement, full of mockery, mischievousness and comradely solidarity, yet at the same time so weighty, knowledgeable and immeasurably serious!"
"Wunderlich, was der Mensch alles schlucken kann! Wohl zehn Minuten las ich in einer Zeitung, ließ durch das Auge den Geist eines verantwortungslosen Menschen in mich hinein, der die Worte anderer im Munde breit kaut und sie eingespeichelt, aber unverdaut wieder von sich gibt. Das nahm ich zu mir, eine ganze Spalte lang. Und alsdann fraß ich ein gutes Stück von der Leber, die man aus dem Leib eines totgeschlagenen Kalbes geschnitten hatte. Wunderlich! Das Beste war der Elsässer. Ich habe die wilden heftigen Weine nicht gern, wenigstens nicht für den Alltag, die mit starken Reizen um sich werfen und berühmte Spezialgeschmäcke haben. Ich liebe am meisten ganz reine, leichte, bescheidene Landweine ohne besondere Namen, man kann viel davon vertragen, und sie schmecken so gut und freundlich nach Land und Erde und Himmel und Gehölz. Ein Becher Elsässer und ein Stück gutes Brot, das ist die beste aller Mahlzeiten. Nun aber hatte ich schon eine Portion Leber in mir, aparter Genuß für mich, der selten Fleisch ißt, und hatte den zweiten Becher vor mir stehen. Auch das war wunderlich, daß da irgendwo in grünen Tälern von gesunden braven Menschen Reben gebaut wurden und Wein gekeltert wurde, damit hier und dort in der Welt, weit von ihnen entfernt, einige enttäuschte, still schöppelnde Bürger und ratlose Steppenwölfe sich ein wenig Mut und Laune aus ihren Bechern saugen konnten.","It's amazing what a person can swallow! I read a newspaper for about ten minutes, letting the spirit of an irresponsible person enter me through my eye, who chews the words of others in his mouth and then salivates them, but lets them out again undigested. I took that for a whole column. And then I ate a good piece of the liver that had been cut from the body of a dead calf. Whimsical! The Alsatian was the best. I don't like wild, violent wines, at least not for everyday use, which throw strong charms around and have famous special flavors. Most of all I love very pure, light, modest country wines without any special names, you can tolerate a lot of them, and they taste so good and friendly of country and earth and sky and wood. A mug of Alsatian and a piece of good bread, this is the best of all meals. But now I already had a portion of liver in me, a special treat for me who rarely eats meat, and I had the second cup in front of me. It was also strange that somewhere in green valleys healthy, good people were growing vines and wine was being pressed, so that here and there in the world, far away from them, a few disappointed, quietly digging citizens and helpless steppe wolves could build up a little courage and could suck mood from their cups.","It is remarkable, all that men can swallow. For a good ten minutes I read a newspaper. I allowed the spirit of an irresponsible man who chews and munches another's words in his mouth, and gives them out again undigested, to enter into me through my eyes. I absorbed a whole column of it. And then I devoured a large piece cut from the liver of a slaughtered calf. Odd indeed! The best was the Elsasser. I am not fond, for everyday at least, of racy, heady wines that diffuse a potent charm and have their own particular flavor. What I like the best is a clean, light, modest country vintage of no special name. One can carry plenty of it and it has the good and homely flavor of the land, and of earth and sky and woods. A pint of Elsasser and a piece of good bread is the best of all meals. By this time, however, I had already eaten my portion of liver, an unusual indulgence for me, as I seldom eat meat, and the second pint had been set before me. And this too was odd: that somewhere in a green valley vines were tended by good, strong fellows and the wine pressed so that here and there in the world, far away, a few disappointed, quietly drinking townsfolk and dispirited Steppenwolves could sip a little heart and courage from their glasses.","Strange, all the things human beings are able to swallow. I must have spent ten minutes reading a newspaper, allowing the spirit of some irresponsible individual – one of those who chews up the words of others in his mouth and spits them out again undigested – to enter me through my eyes. I ingested a whole column of the stuff. And then I wolfed down a fair portion of the liver cut from the body of a slaughtered calf. Strange! The best thing was the Alsace wine. I am not partial to those heady, powerful vintages that flaunt their charms and are famous for their special flavours, at least not for everyday drinking. Most of all I like perfectly clean, light, modest local wines without particular names. You can drink a lot of them, and they have a good, friendly taste of the countryside, of earth and sky and woodland. A glass of Alsace and a piece of good bread, that’s the best of all meals. But now I already had a portion of liver inside me – an outlandish indulgence since I seldom eat meat – and a second glass of wine in front of me. Strange, too, to think that decent, healthy people in some green valley or other should take the trouble to grow vines and press grapes. Why? So that in some other place far away a few disappointed citizens and helpless lone wolves might sit in silence, soaking up a little courage or good humour from their wine glasses."

"Es empfing mich ein dämmriger, stiller Raum, darin saß, ohne Stuhl nach morgenländischer Art, ein Mann auf dem Boden, der hatte vor sich etwas wie ein großes Schachbrett stehen. Im ersten Augenblick schien es mir Freund Pablo zu sein, wenigstens trug der Mann eine ähnliche buntseidene Jacke und hatte dieselben dunkel strahlenden Augen.","I was greeted by a dim, quiet room in which a man was sitting on the floor, without a chair, in the oriental manner, with something like a large chessboard in front of him.

"Giottosche Engelscharen aus einem kleinen blauen Kirchengewölbe in Padua, und neben ihnen gingen Hamlet und die bekränzte Ophelia, schöne Gleichnisse aller Trauer und alles Mißverständnisses in der Welt, da stand im brennenden Ballon der Luftschiffer Gianozzo und stieß ins Horn, trug Attila Schmelzle seinen neuen Hut in der Hand, stieß der Borobudur sein Skulpturengebirg in die Lüfte. Und mochten alle diese schönen Gestalten auch in tausend andern Herzen leben, es waren noch zehntausend andere, unbekannte Bilder und Klänge da, deren Heimat und sehendes Auge und hörendes Ohr einzig in mir innen lebte. Die alte Hospitalmauer mit dem alten, verwitterten, fleckigen Graugrün, in deren Rissen und Verwitterungen tausend Fresken zu ahnen waren – wer gab ihr Antwort, wer ließ sie in seine Seele ein, wer liebte sie, wer empfand den Zauber ihrer zart hinsterbenden Farben? Die alten Bücher der Mönche, mit den sanft leuchtenden Miniaturen, und die von ihrem Volk vergessenen Bücher der deutschen Dichter vor zweihundert und vor hundert Jahren, alle die abgegriffenen und stockfleckigen Bände, und die Drucke und Handschriften der alten Musiker, die festen, gelblichen Notenblätter mit ihren erstarrten Tonträumen – wer hörte ihre geistvollen, ihre schelmischen und sehnsüchtigen Stimmen, wer trug ein Herz voll von ihrem Geist und ihrem Zauber durch eine andere, ihnen entfremdete Zeit? Wer gedachte noch jener kleinen, zähen Zypresse hoch am Berge über Gubbio, die von einem Steinsturz geknickt und gespalten war und doch das Leben festgehalten und einen neuen, spärlichen Notwipfel getrieben hatte? Wer ward der fleißigen Hausmutter im ersten Stock und ihrer blanken Araukarie gerecht? Wer las nachts überm Rhein die Wolkenschriften der ziehenden Nebel? Es war der Steppenwolf. Und wer suchte über den Trümmern seines Lebens den zerflatternden Sinn, litt das scheinbar Unsinnige, lebte das scheinbar Verrückte, hoffte heimlich im letzten irren Chaos noch Offenbarung und Gottesnähe?","Hosts of Giotto angels from a small blue church vault in Padua, and beside them walked Hamlet and the wreathed Ophelia, beautiful parables of all the sadness and misunderstandings in the world, there stood the aeronaut Gianozzo in the burning balloon and blew the horn, Attila Schmelzle wore his new hat in hand, the Borobudur thrust his mountain of sculptures into the air. And even if all these beautiful figures live in thousands of other hearts, there were still ten thousand other, unknown images and sounds, whose homeland and seeing eye and hearing ear lived solely within me. The old hospital wall with the old, weathered, mottled gray-green, in whose cracks and weathering a thousand frescoes could be sensed - who answered her, who let her into his soul, who loved her, who felt the magic of her delicately dying colors? The old books of the monks, with the softly glowing miniatures, and the books of the German poets that their people had forgotten two hundred and a hundred years ago, all the worn and foxed volumes, and the prints and manuscripts of the old musicians, the firm, yellowish sheets of music with their frozen tonal dreams – who heard their witty, mischievous and longing voices, who carried a heart full of their spirit and magic through another time alien to them? Who still remembered that small, tough cypress high on the mountain above Gubbio, which had been broken and split by a falling rock and yet had held on to life and put up a new, sparse emergency crown? Who did justice to the industrious housemother on the first floor and her shiny araucaria? Who read the cloud writings of the moving fog at night over the Rhine? It was Steppenwolf. And who sought the shattering sense over the ruins of his life, suffered what seemed absurd, lived what seemed crazy, secretly hoped for revelation and nearness to God in the last mad chaos?","Giotto's flock of angels from the blue vaulting of a little church in Padua, and near them walked Hamlet and the garlanded Ophelia, fair similitudes of all sadness and misunderstanding in the world, and there stood Gianozzo, the aeronaut, in his burning balloon and blew a blast on his horn, Attila carrying his new headgear in his hand, and the Borobudur reared its soaring sculpture in the air.

The old books of the monks, softly illumined with their miniatures, and the books of the German poets of two hundred and a hundred years ago whom their own folk have forgotten, all the thumbed and damp-stained volumes, and the works in print and manuscripts of the old composers, the stout and yellowing music sheets dreaming their music through a winter sleep—who heard their spirited, their roguish and yearning tones, who carried through a world estranged from them a heart full of their spirit and their charm? Who still remembered that slender cypress on a hill over Gubbio, that though split and riven by a fall of stone yet held fast to life and put forth with its last resources a new sparse tuft at top?

"»Einverstanden«, sagte ich kühl. »Dennoch geht es nicht an, Mozart und den neuesten Foxtrott auf eine Stufe zu stellen. Und es ist nicht einerlei, ob Sie den Leuten göttliche und ewige Musik vorspielen oder billige Eintagsmusik.« Als Pablo die Erregtheit in meiner Stimme wahrnahm, machte er alsbald sein liebstes Gesicht, strich mir kosend über den Arm und gab seiner Stimme eine unglaubliche Sanftheit.","""Agreed,"" I said coolly. “Nevertheless, it is not right to put Mozart and the latest foxtrot on the same level.

And it does make a difference whether the music you play to people is divine and ageless or the cheap variety that only lasts a day.’ Noticing from the sound of my voice how worked up I was, Pablo immediately put on his kindest expression, tenderly stroked my arm and adopted an incredibly gentle tone of voice."
"Entsetzt floh ich durch die Tür hinaus. Dieses magische Theater, sah ich, war kein reines Paradies, alle Höllen lagen unter seiner hübschen Oberfläche.

"Gegen Mittag erwacht, fand ich in mir alsbald die geklärte Situation wieder, das kleine Büchlein lag auf dem Nachttisch und mein Gedicht, und freundlich kühl blickte aus dem Wirrsal meines jüngsten Lebens mein Entschluß mich an, über Nacht im Schlafe rund und fest geworden. Eile tat nicht not, mein Todesentschluß war nicht die Laune einer Stunde, er war eine reife, haltbare Frucht, langsam gewachsen und schwer geworden, vom Wind des Schicksals leis geschaukelt, dessen nächster Stoß sie zum Fallen bringen mußte.","When I woke up around noon, I soon found the cleared situation in myself again, the little book lay on the bedside table and my poem, and my decision looked at me cool and friendly out of the confusion of my youngest life, having become round and firm overnight in my sleep.

There lay the little book on my night stand, and my poem. My resolution, too, was there. After the nights sleep it had taken shape and looked at me out of the confusion of my youth with a calm and friendly greeting. Haste makes no speed. My resolve to die was not the whim of an hour. It was the ripe, sound fruit that had grown slowly to full size, lightly rocked by the winds of fate whose next breath would bring it to the ground.","Waking towards midday, I was soon able to view my situation clearly again. The little booklet was there on my bedside table together with the poem, and my decision still stood. Overnight, as I slept, it had become firm and rounded, and now, emerging from the chaos that had been my life in recent times, it was taking a cool but kind look at me. There was no need to rush things. My decision to die was no passing whim, but a fruit that had ripened and would keep. It had grown slowly and was heavy now, gently rocked by the wind of fate and bound to fall when the next gust came along."
"Und eines Abends überraschte er mich noch mehr. Er erschien in meiner Wohnung, erzählte mir, daß er zwanzig Franken brauche und daß er mich um dies Geld bitte. Er biete mir dafür an, diese Nacht statt seiner über Maria zu verfügen.","And one night he surprised me even more. He appeared at my apartment, told me that he needed twenty francs and that he was asking me for this money. In return, he offers me to dispose of Maria tonight instead of him.",And one evening he surprised me still more. Coming to me in my room he told me that he needed twenty francs and would I oblige him? In return he offered that I instead of him should have Maria for the night.,"And one evening he had an even greater surprise in store for me. Appearing in my flat, he told me he needed twenty francs. Could I let him have them? If so, he offered, I could take his place that night with Maria."
»Maria? Wer ist das?«,"""Maria? Who is this?""","""Maria? Who is she?""",‘Maria? Who is that?’
"»O ja. Zum Frommsein braucht man Zeit, man braucht sogar noch mehr: Unabhängigkeit von der Zeit! Du kannst nicht ernstlich fromm sein und zugleich in der Wirklichkeit leben und sie auch noch ernst nehmen: die Zeit, das Geld, die Odeon-Bar und all das.«","""O yes. To be pious one needs time, one needs even more: Independence from time! You can't be seriously pious and at the same time live in reality and also take it seriously: the time, the money, the Odeon bar and all that.'","""Oh, yes. To be religious you must have time and, even more, independence of time. You can't be religious in earnest and at the same time live in actual things and still take them seriously, time and money and the Odéon Bar and all that.""","‘Yes, of course. To be religious you need time. You even need something more. You need to be independent of time. You can’t be seriously religious while living in the real world and, what’s more, taking the things of the real world seriously – time, money, the Odeon Bar and all that.’"
»Aber sie werden mit Polizei und Soldaten kommen und uns totmachen.«,"""But they will come with police and soldiers and kill us.""","""But the police and the soldiers will come and kill us.""",‘But they’ll come after us with policemen and troops and kill us.’
"»Nun, Hermine, und was denkst du über jenes Buch, in dem ich beschrieben stehe?«","""Well, Hermione, what do you think of that book in which I am described?""","""Well, Hermine, and what do you think about this book with a description of me in it?""","‘So, Hermione, and what do you think about that book with the description of me in it?’"
"Er zog wieder den kleinen Taschenspiegel hervor und hielt ihn mir vors Gesicht. Wieder blickte mir der wirre, wolkige, von der ringenden Wolfsgestalt durchflossene Harry entgegen, ein mir wohlbekanntes und wahrlich nicht sympathisches Bild, dessen Vernichtung mir keine Sorge bereiten konnte.","He pulled out the small pocket mirror again and held it in front of my face. Again the confused, cloudy Harry, with the struggling wolf form flowing through him, looked at me, a well-known and truly not sympathetic image, the destruction of which could not cause me any concern.","He took out the pocket mirror again and held it in front of my face. Again I was confronted by the same indistinct and cloudy reflection, with the wolf's shape encircling it and coursing through it. I knew it too well and disliked it too sincerely for its destruction to cause me any sorrow.","Taking out his little pocket mirror again, he held it in front of my face. Once more I could see the blurred, confused image of Harry, fused with the wrestling figure of the wolf. To tell the truth, this familiar image was not at all congenial to me, so putting an end to it was unlikely to worry me at all."
"Auch mit ihr tanzte ich nun leichter, freier und fröhlicher, wenn auch nicht so unbeschwert und selbstvergessen wie mit jener andern. Hermine ließ mich führen und paßte sich zart und leicht wie ein Blumenblatt an, und auch bei ihr fand und fühlte ich jetzt alle jene bald entgegenkommenden, bald wegfliehenden Schönheiten, auch sie duftete nach Weib und Liebe, auch ihr Tanz sang zart und innig das holde lockende Lied des Geschlechts – und doch konnte ich auf dies alles nicht ganz frei und heiter antworten, konnte mich nicht völlig vergessen und hingeben. Hermine stand mir allzu nah, sie war mein Kamerad, meine Schwester, war meinesgleichen, sie glich mir selbst und glich meinem Jugendfreund Hermann, dem Schwärmer, dem Dichter, dem glühenden Genossen meiner geistigen Übungen und Ausschweifungen.","With her, too, I now danced more easily, more freely and happier, although not as light-heartedly and self-forgotten as with the other one. Hermione let me lead her and adjusted herself gently and easily like a flower leaf, and with her too I now found and felt all those beauties that were now approaching, now fleeing away, she too smelled of woman and love, her dance too sang tenderly and heartily the sweet alluring song of sex - and yet I could not answer all this quite freely and cheerfully, could not completely forget and surrender myself. Hermine was too close to me, she was my comrade, my sister, my equal, she resembled me and my youthful friend Hermann, the enthusiast, the poet, the ardent comrade of my intellectual exercises and excesses.","With her, too, I danced more easily now, in a freer and more sprightly fashion, even though not so buoyantly and more self-consciously than with the other. Hermine had me lead, adapting herself as softly and lightly as the leaf of a flower, and with her, too, I now experienced all these delights that now advanced and now took wing. She, too, now exhaled the perfume of woman and love, and her dancing, too, sang with intimate tenderness the lovely and enchanting song of sex. And yet I could not respond to all this with warmth and freedom. I could not entirely forget myself in abandon. Hermine stood in too close a relation to me. She was my comrade and sister—my double, almost, in her resemblance not to me only, but to Herman, my boyhood friend, the enthusiast, the poet, who had shared with ardor all my intellectual pursuits and extravagances.","Now, when dancing with her too, I was lighter, freer on my feet and more cheerful, though not as carefree and unselfconscious as with the other girl. Hermione got me to lead and, as light and gentle as a petal, adjusted her movements to suit mine. With her too I now discovered and experienced all those beautiful sensations, as her body from time to time closed on me, from time to time retreated. She too had the scent of woman and love about her; her dance too was a gentle, intimate song, the sweetly alluring song of sex, yet I was unable to respond to all this freely and serenely, could not totally forget myself and surrender. I was far too close to Hermione. She was a companion to me, a sister, a kindred spirit. She was like me and like my boyhood friend Hermann, the dreamer and poet who had so enthusiastically shared in my intellectual and spiritual pursuits and escapades."
Dann fragte er zu meiner Verwunderung: »Die Zauberflöte von Mozart muß Ihnen dann wohl recht sehr zuwider sein?«,"Then, to my astonishment, he asked: ""Then you must be very disgusted with Mozart's Magic Flute?""","Then to my surprise, he asked, ""You must have a strong objection, then, to the Magic Flute of Mozart?""","Then, to my amazement, he said: ‘In that case you must, I suppose, find Mozart’s Magic Flute utterly abhorrent.’"
"»Nein, das sind andere Sachen, die sie nicht verstehen würde. Maria ist wunderbar, du hast Glück gehabt, aber zwischen dir und mir gibt es Dinge, von denen sie keine Ahnung hat. Ich habe ihr viel über dich gesagt, natürlich, viel mehr, als dir damals lieb gewesen wäre – ich mußte sie doch für dich verführen! Aber verstehen, Freund, so wie ich dich verstehe, wird Maria dich nie und keine andere. Ich habe auch von ihr noch einiges zugelernt – ich weiß über dich, soweit Maria dich kennt, Bescheid. Ich kenne dich beinah so gut, wie wenn wir oft miteinander geschlafen hätten.«","“No, those are other things she wouldn't understand. Maria is wonderful, you're lucky, but there are things between you and me that she has no idea. I told her a lot about you, of course, much more than you would have liked at the time - I had to seduce her for you! But, friend, as I understand you, Maria will never understand you and no one else. I also learned a few things from her - I know a lot about you, as far as Maria knows you. I know you almost as well as if we had slept together often.""","""No, that's another matter. Those are things she would not understand. Maria is wonderful. You are fortunate. But between you and me there are things she has not a notion of. Naturally I told her a lot about you, much more than you would have liked at the time. I had to win her for you, you see. But neither Maria nor anyone else will ever understand you as I understand you. I've learned something about you from her besides, for she's told me all about you as far as she knows you at all. I know you nearly as well as if we had often slept together.""","‘No, that’s a different matter. Those are things she wouldn’t understand. Luckily for you, Maria is wonderful, but there are things private to the two of us of which she has no idea. Of course I told her a lot about you, a lot more than you would have wished at the time. After all, I had to seduce her for you. But as for understanding you, my friend, in the way I understand you, that’s something Maria will never be capable of, or any other woman either. I’ve also found out quite a few new things about you from her, so I am well informed, at least as far as her knowledge of you goes. I know you almost as well as if we had often slept with one another.’"
"Nie habe ich das charakteristische Gefühl jener Tage, jene wunderlich bittersüße Doppelstimmung heftiger empfunden als in jener Nacht vor dem Ball. Es war Glück, was ich empfand: die Schönheit und Hingabe Marias, das Genießen, Betasten, Einatmen von hundert feinen holden Sinnlichkeiten, die ich erst so spät, als alternder Mensch, hatte kennenlernen, das Plätschern in einer sanften, wiegenden Welle von Genuß. Und doch war das nur die Schale: innen war alles voll Bedeutung, Spannung, Schicksal, und während ich liebevoll und zärtlich mit den süßen, rührenden Kleinigkeiten der Liebe beschäftigt war, scheinbar in lauter lauem Glücke schwamm, spürte ich im Herzen, wie mein Schicksal Hals über Kopf nach vorwärts strebte, jagend und schlagend wie ein scheues Roß, dem Abgrund entgegen, dem Sturz entgegen, voll Angst, voll Sehnsucht, voll Hingabe an den Tod. So wie ich noch vor kurzem mich mit Scheu und Furcht gegen den angenehmen Leichtsinn der nur sinnlichen Liebe gewehrt, wie ich vor Marias lachender, sich zu verschenken bereiter Schönheit Angst gespürt hatte, so spürte ich jetzt Angst vor dem Tode – aber eine Angst, welche schon wußte, daß sie bald zu Hingabe und Erlösung werden würde.","I have never felt the characteristic feeling of those days, that wondrous, bittersweet double mood, more violently than on the night before the ball I only got to know it so late, as an aging person, the rippling in a gentle, swaying wave of pleasure. And yet that was only the shell: inside everything was full of meaning, tension, destiny, and while I was lovingly and tenderly busy with the sweet, touching little things of love, apparently swimming in sheer lukewarm happiness, I felt in my heart how my destiny Head over heels striving forward, chasing and hitting like a shy horse towards the abyss, towards the fall, full of fear, full of longing, full of devotion to death. Just as I had recently defended myself with shyness and fear against the pleasant carelessness of purely sensual love, just as I had felt fear of Maria's laughing beauty ready to give herself away, so I now felt fear of death - but a fear, what kind already knew that it would soon become devotion and redemption.","Never did I experience the feeling peculiar to those days, that strange, bitter-sweet alternation of mood, more powerfully than on that night before the Ball. It was happiness that I experienced. There was the loveliness of Maria and her surrender. There was the sweet and subtle sensuous joy of inhaling and tasting a hundred pleasures of the senses that I had only begun to know as an elderly man. I was bathed in sweet joy like a rippling pool. And yet that was only the shell. Within all was significant and tense with fate, and while, love-lost and tender, I was busied with the little sweet appealing things of love and sank apparently without a care in the caress of happiness, I was conscious all the while in my heart how my fate raced on at breakneck speed, racing and chasing like a frightened horse, straight for the precipitous abyss, spurred on by dread and longing to the consummation of death. Just as a short while before I had started aside in fear from the easy thoughtless pleasure of merely sensual love and felt a dread of Maria's beauty that laughingly offered itself, so now I felt a dread of death, a dread, however, that was already conscious of its approaching change into surrender and release.","I never experienced the characteristic feeling of those days, their strangely bitter-sweet alternating mood, more powerfully than in the night before the ball. Happiness was what I experienced as a result of Maria’s beauty and her winning ways; the opportunity to relish, feel and breathe countless sensual delights that I, as someone getting on in years, had never known until now; a chance to splash around like a child, rocked by gentle waves of pleasure. And yet this was only on the surface. Inside me, everything was laden with meaning, tension and destiny. While amorously and tenderly engaged in the touching sweet nothings of lovemaking, seemingly afloat in a warm bath of pure happiness, in my heart I could feel my destiny propelling me forwards at a headlong pace, whisking me along at a gallop like a frightened steed towards the abyss into which I would plunge, filled with fear and longing, in total surrender to death. In much the same way that only a little while ago I had still been shyly and timidly resisting the agreeable frivolity of exclusively sensual lovemaking and feeling afraid of Maria’s radiant beauty, all the benefits of which she was willing to lavish upon me, so now I was feeling afraid of death. However, I knew that this fear I was experiencing would soon turn to willing and liberating surrender."
"Als ich den nassen Mantel auszog, fiel das kleine Buch mir wieder in die Hände. Ich zog es heraus, es war ein dünnes, schlecht auf schlechtem Papier gedrucktes Jahrmarktsbüchlein, so wie jene Hefte »Der Mensch im Januar geboren« oder »Wie werde ich in acht Tagen um zwanzig Jahre jünger?«","As I took off my wet coat, the little book fell into my hands again. I pulled it out, it was a thin fairground booklet, badly printed on bad paper, like those booklets Man Born in January or How Can I Be Twenty Years Younger in Eight Days?","As I threw off my wet coat I came upon the little book, and took it out. It was one of those little books wretchedly printed on wretched paper that are sold at fairs, ""Were you born in January?"" or ""How to be twenty years younger in a week.""","When taking off my wet overcoat, I happened on the little book again. Removing it from my pocket, I saw it was one of those thin pamphlets, poorly printed on poor paper, which you see on sale at fairs. ‘Tips for those born in January’ or ‘How to make yourself twenty years younger in a week’, that kind of thing."
"Mit diesen gewohnten Gedanken lief ich auf der nassen Straße weiter, durch eins der stillsten und ältesten Quartiere der Stadt. Da stand gegenüber, jenseits der Gasse, in der Finsternis eine alte graue Steinmauer, die ich immer gerne sah, sie stand immer so alt und unbekümmert da, zwischen einer kleinen Kirche und einem alten Hospital, auf ihrer rauhen Fläche ließ ich bei Tage oft meine Augen ausruhen, es gab wenige so stille, gute, schweigende Flächen in der innern Stadt, wo ja sonst auf jedem halben Quadratmeter ein Geschäft, ein Advokat, ein Erfinder, ein Arzt, ein Barbier oder Hühneraugenheilkünstler einem seinen Namen entgegenschrie. Auch jetzt wieder sah ich die alte Mauer still in ihrem Frieden liegen, und doch war etwas an ihr verändert, ich sah ein kleines hübsches Portal mit einem Spitzbogen in der Mitte der Mauer und wurde irr, denn ich wußte wahrhaftig nicht mehr, ob dies Portal immer dagewesen oder neu hinzugekommen war. Alt sah es ohne Zweifel aus, uralt; vermutlich hatte die kleine geschlossene Pforte mit ihrer dunklen Holztür schon vor Jahrhunderten in irgendeinen verschlafenen Klosterhof geführt und tat es heute noch, wenn auch das Kloster nicht mehr stand, und wahrscheinlich hatte ich das Tor hundertmal gesehen und bloß nie beachtet, vielleicht war es frisch bemalt und fiel mir darum auf. Immerhin blieb ich stehen und blickte aufmerksam hinüber, ohne doch hinüber zu gehen, die Straße dazwischen war gar so bodenlos erweicht und naß; ich blieb auf dem Trottoir und schaute bloß hinüber, es war alles schon sehr nächtig, und mir schien, um die Pforte sei ein Kranz oder sonst etwas Buntes geflochten. Und jetzt, wo ich mir Mühe gab, genauer zu sehen, sah ich über dem Portal ein helles Schild, auf dem stand, so schien mir, irgend etwas geschrieben. Ich strengte die Augen an, und schließlich ging ich trotz Schmutz und Pfützen hinüber. Da sah ich über dem Portal auf dem alten Graugrün der Mauer einen Fleck matt beschienen, und über den Fleck liefen bewegliche bunte Buchstaben und verschwanden alsbald wieder, kamen wieder und verflogen. Nun haben sie, dachte ich, richtig auch diese alte gute Mauer zu einer Lichtreklame mißbraucht! Indessen entzifferte ich einige der flüchtig erscheinenden Worte, sie waren schwer zu lesen und mußten halb erraten werden, die Buchstaben kamen mit ungleichen Zwischenräumen, so blaß und hinfällig, und erloschen so rasch. Der Mann, der damit sein Geschäft machen wollte, war nicht tüchtig, er war ein Steppenwolf, armer Kerl; warum ließ er seine Buchstaben hier auf dieser Mauer im finstersten Gäßchen der Altstadt spielen, zu dieser Tageszeit, bei Regenwetter, wo niemand hier unterwegs war, und warum waren sie so flüchtig, so hingeweht, so launisch und unleserlich? Aber halt, jetzt gelang es mir, hintereinander konnte ich mehrere Worte erhaschen, die hießen:","With these usual thoughts I walked on down the wet street through one of the quietest and oldest quarters in the city. There stood across the street, in the darkness, an old gray stone wall that I always liked to see, it always stood there so old and carefree, between a small church and an old hospital, I often left mine on its rough surface during the day Rest your eyes, there were few such quiet, good, silent areas in the inner city, where otherwise in every half square meter a shop, a lawyer, an inventor, a doctor, a barber or a corn healer shouted his name at you. Now again I saw the old wall lying still in its peace, and yet something about it had changed. I saw a pretty little portal with a pointed arch in the middle of the wall and got confused, because I really no longer knew whether this portal always existed or was newly added. It looked old, no doubt, ancient; centuries ago the small closed gate with its dark wooden door had probably led into some sleepy monastery courtyard and still did, even though the monastery no longer stood, and I had probably seen the gate a hundred times and just never noticed it, maybe it was freshly painted and that's why I noticed it. Nevertheless, I stopped and looked across attentively without going across, the street in between was so soft and wet; I stayed on the pavement and just looked across, it was all very dark by now, and it seemed to me that a wreath or something else colorful was woven around the gate. And now that I was trying to get a better look, I saw a bright sign above the portal, on which it seemed to me something was written. I strained my eyes and finally walked over despite the dirt and puddles. Then I saw a spot above the portal on the old gray-green of the wall with a dull light, and moving colorful letters ran across the spot and soon disappeared again, came back and vanished. Well, I thought, they've really misused this good old wall for an illuminated sign! Meanwhile I deciphered some of the fleeting words, they were hard to read and had to be half guessed, the letters came at unequal intervals, so faint and frail, and faded so quickly. The man who wanted to do his business with it was not competent, he was a Steppenwolf, poor fellow; why did he let his letters play here on this wall in the darkest little alley of the old town, at this time of day, in rainy weather, when no one was out and about, and why were they so fleeting, so blown, so moody and illegible? But wait, now I succeeded, I caught several words in a row that said:","With these familiar thoughts I went along the wet street through one of the quietest and oldest quarters of the town. On the opposite side there stood in the darkness an old stone wall which I always noticed with pleasure. Old and serene, it stood between a little church and an old hospital and often during the day I let my eyes rest on its rough surface. There were few such quiet and peaceful spaces in the center of the town where from every square foot some lawyer, or quack, or doctor, or barber, or chiropodist shouted his name at you. This time, too, the wall was peaceful and serene and yet something was altered in it. I was amazed to see a small and pretty doorway with a Gothic arch in the middle of the wall, for I could not make up my mind whether this doorway had always been there or whether it had just been made. It looked old without a doubt, very old; apparently this closed portal with its door of blackened wood had opened hundreds of years ago onto a sleepy convent yard, and did so still, even though the convent was no longer there. Probably I had seen it a hundred times and simply not noticed it. Perhaps it had been painted afresh and caught my eye for that reason. I paused to examine it from where I stood without crossing over, as the street between was so deep in mud and water. From the sidewalk where I stood and looked across, it seemed to me in the dim light that a garland, or something gaily colored, was festooned round the doorway, and now that I looked more closely I saw over the portal a bright shield, on which, it seemed to me, there was something written. I strained my eyes and at last, in spite of the mud and puddles, went across, and there over the door I saw a stain showing up faintly on the grey-green of the wall, and over the stain bright letters dancing and then disappearing, returning and vanishing once more. So that's it, thought I. They've disfigured this good old wall with an electric sign. Meanwhile I deciphered one or two of the letters as they appeared again for an instant; but they were hard to read even by guess work, for they came with very irregular spaces between them and very faintly, and then abruptly vanished. Whoever hoped for any result from a display like that was not very smart. He was a Steppenwolf, poor fellow. Why have his letters playing on this old wall in the darkest alley of the Old Town on a wet night with not a soul passing by, and why were they so fleeting, so fitful and illegible? But wait, at last I succeeded in catching several words on end. They were:","Thinking these habitual thoughts, I carried on walking along the wet street, through one of the quietest and oldest districts of the city. Opposite me in the darkness, beyond the street itself, stood an old grey stone wall. It was always a pleasure to see it standing there so old and serene between a little church and an old infirmary. In daylight I would often look lingeringly at its rough surface since there were few such quiet, kind, silent surfaces in the inner city. Otherwise, every one and a half square foot of ground there was occupied by a shop, a lawyer, an inventor, a doctor, a barber, or a specialist in treating corns, all of them blaring out their names at you. This time too, the old wall looked quiet and peaceful, yet something about it was different. In the middle of it I noticed an attractive little portal with a Gothic arch and, scarcely able to believe my eyes, couldn’t decide whether it had always been there or was a recent alteration. It certainly looked old, age-old. Presumably centuries ago this little closed gateway with its dark wooden door had been the entrance to some sleepy monastery courtyard, and it still was, even though no monastery now stood there. I had probably seen the gateway a hundred times, simply failing to take notice of it. Perhaps it caught my eye now because it was freshly painted. Whatever the case, I remained standing there, peering across at it. I didn’t venture over the road – it was so deep in mud and rainwater – but stayed on the pavement, just gazing across. Everything was already shrouded in night, but it seemed to me that there was a garland or some other colourful thing draped around the gateway. And, striving to look more intently, I now saw above the portal a bright sign on which, so it seemed, something or other was written. Despite the mud and the puddles, having looked as hard as I could, I eventually walked across. Above the portal, on the greyish-green of the old wall, I could now see a dimly lit patch, and across this patch brightly coloured mobile letters were darting, only to quickly disappear, return again, and once more vanish. Now, I thought, they’ve even gone and abused this dear old wall by turning it into a neon advertising sign! Meanwhile I was trying to decipher some of the words that fleetingly appeared. They were difficult to read, had to be half guessed at because the letters came at unequal intervals and were so pale and feeble, fading rapidly from view. Whoever thought this was a good way to advertise his business was clearly incompetent. He was a Steppenwolf, poor chap. Why was he getting his neon letters to dart about here on this wall in the darkest alleyway of the Old Town, at this time of night, when it was raining and nobody was about? And why were they so fleeting, so random, so fitful and illegible? But wait, now I was getting somewhere, I was able to catch several words in sequence. They read:"
"Er hob die Hände, als dirigierte er, und ein Mond oder sonst ein bleiches Gestirn ging irgendwo auf, über die Brüstung blickte ich in unmeßbare Raumtiefen, Nebel und Wolken zogen darin, Gebirge dämmerten und Meergestade, unter uns dehnte sich weltenweit eine wüstenähnliche Ebene. In dieser Ebene sahen wir einen ehrwürdig aussehenden alten Herrn mit langem Barte, der mit wehmütigem Gesicht einen gewaltigen Zug von einigen zehntausend schwarzgekleideten Männern anführte. Er sah betrübt und hoffnungslos aus, und Mozart sagte:","He raised his hands as if he were conducting, and a moon or some other pale star rose somewhere, I looked over the parapet into immeasurable spatial depths, fog and clouds drifted through it, mountains and sea shores dawned, beneath us a desert-like plain stretched out across the world. In this plain we saw a venerable-looking old gentleman with a long beard, who, with a wistful face, led a vast procession of some tens of thousands of men dressed in black. He looked sad and hopeless, and Mozart said:","He raised his hands as though he were conducting, and a moon, or some pale constellation, rose somewhere. I looked over the edge of the box into immeasurable depths of space. Mist and clouds floated there. Mountains and seashores glimmered, and beneath us extended world-wide a desert plain. On this plain we saw an old gentleman of a worthy aspect, with a long beard, who drearily led a large following of some ten thousand men in black. He had a melancholy and hopeless air; and Mozart said:","He raised his hands as if conducting an orchestra and somewhere or other I saw a moon or some equally pale heavenly body rising. I was gazing out over the edge of the box into immeasurable depths of space. Mists and clouds were swirling in it; mountain ranges and coastlines came dimly into view; and beneath us stretched a desert-like plain as wide as the earth. On this plain we could see a venerable-looking old gentleman with a long beard who was walking mournful-faced at the head of an enormously long procession of tens of thousands of men dressed in black. He looked dejected and desperate, and Mozart said:"
"»Ach ja«, sagte er und lächelte stärker, »Sie haben recht. Aber warten Sie noch einen Augenblick, ich muß Ihnen doch zeigen, warum ich hier ein wenig sitzenbleiben mußte.«","'Oh yes,' he said and smiled more, 'you're right. But wait a minute, I've got to show you why I had to sit here for a while.""","""Ah, yes,"" he said, and smiled the more. ""You're quite right. But wait a moment, for I really must tell you what it was made me sit here for a bit.""","‘Oh, quite so,’ he said, smiling more intensely, ‘you are right. But wait a moment longer. You see, I must show you why I felt the need to stay sitting here for a while.’"
"Eines Tages, nachdem ich wieder einmal vergeblich Straßen und Plätze nach dem Mann mit der Plakatstange abgesucht hatte und mehrmals lauernd an der Mauer mit dem unsichtbaren Tor vorbeigestreift war, begegnete ich in der Martinsvorstadt einem Leichenzug. Indem ich die Gesichter der Leidtragenden betrachtete, die hinter dem Sargwagen hertrotteten, war mein Gedanke: Wo in dieser Stadt, wo in dieser Welt lebt der Mensch, dessen Tod mir einen Verlust bedeuten würde? Und wo der Mensch, dem mein Tod etwas bedeuten könnte? Da war zwar Erika, meine Geliebte, nun ja; aber wir lebten seit langem in sehr loser Verbindung, sahen uns selten, ohne Streit zu bekommen, und zur Zeit wußte ich nicht einmal ihren Aufenthaltsort. Sie kam zuweilen zu mir, oder ich reiste zu ihr, und da wir beide einsame und schwierige Menschen sind, irgendwo in der Seele und in der Seelenkrankheit einander verwandt, blieb trotz allem eine Bindung zwischen uns bestehen. Aber würde sie nicht vielleicht aufatmen und sich sehr erleichtert fühlen, wenn sie meinen Tod erführe? Ich wußte es nicht, wußte auch nichts über die Zuverlässigkeit meiner eigenen Gefühle. Man muß im Normalen und Möglichen leben, um über solche Dinge etwas wissen zu können.","One day, after I had once again searched the streets and squares in vain for the man with the poster pole and had stalked past the wall with the invisible gate several times, I encountered a funeral procession in the Martinsvorstadt. As I looked at the faces of the mourners trudging behind the coffin, my thought was: where in this city, where in this world lives the man whose death would mean a loss to me? And where is the person to whom my death could mean something? There was Erika, my beloved, well; but for a long time we had lived in very loose connection, seldom saw each other without getting into a fight, and at the time I did not even know her whereabouts. She came to see me sometimes, or I traveled to her, and since we are both lonely and difficult people, related somewhere in soul and in mental illness, a bond remained between us in spite of everything. But wouldn't she perhaps breathe a sigh of relief and feel very relieved when she found out about my death? I didn't know, nor did I know anything about the reliability of my own feelings. One has to live within the normal and possible to know anything about such things.","One day after I had made one more vain search through streets and squares for the man with the signboard and prowled several times past the wall of the invisible door with watchful eye, I met a funeral procession in St. Martin's. While I was contemplating the faces of the mourners who followed the hearse with halting step, I thought to myself, ""Where in this town or in the whole world is the man whose death would be a loss to me? And where is the man to whom my death would mean anything? "" There was Erica, it is true, but for a long while we had lived apart. We rarely saw one another without quarreling and at the moment I did not even know her address. She came to see me now and then, or I made the journey to her, and since both of us were lonely, difficult people related somehow to one another in soul, and sickness of soul, there was a link between us that held in spite of all. But would she not perhaps breathe more freely if she heard of my death? I did not know. I did not know either how far my own feeling for her was to be relied upon. To know anything of such matters one needs to live in a world of practical possibilities.","One day, after yet again searching the streets and squares in a vain attempt to find the man with the placard on a pole and roaming several times on the lookout past the wall with the invisible portal, I encountered a funeral procession in the suburb of St Martin. Contemplating the faces of the mourners who were trudging along behind the hearse, the thought went through my head: Where is there anyone in this city, in this world, whose death would be a loss to me? And where is there anyone to whom my death might matter? True, there was Erika, the woman I loved. Well yes, but we had been in a very unsteady relationship for ages, rarely seeing one another without falling out, and at that moment I didn’t even know where she was staying. From time to time she would come to me or I would travel to see her and since we are both solitary and difficult people, to some degree like each other in mentality and mental sickness, some sort of bond continued to exist between us despite everything. But might she not breathe a sigh of relief if she heard of my death? I didn’t know, nor could I guarantee my own feelings with any certainty. To have any knowledge of such matters you have to live a normal, practical life."

That’s something he can’t put up with. It makes him curse and swear, then he rushes off! If he had enough sense, he would simply laugh at the artist and the professor. If he were mad, he would chuck their picture of Goethe straight back in their faces.

"Über dem Streit zwischen den beiden Harrys wurde der Professor beinah vergessen; plötzlich war er mir wieder lästig, und ich eilte, ihn loszuwerden. Lange sah ich ihm nach, wie er unter der kahlen Allee davonging, mit dem gutmütigen und etwas komischen Gang eines Idealisten, eines Gläubigen. Heftig tobte die Schlacht in meinem Innern, und während ich mechanisch die steifen Finger krümmte und wieder streckte, im Kampf mit der heimlich wühlenden Gicht, mußte ich mir gestehen, daß ich mich da hatte übertölpeln lassen, daß ich mir nun eine Einladung auf halb acht Uhr zum Abendessen auf den Hals geladen hatte samt Verpflichtung zu Höflichkeiten, wissenschaftlichem Geschwatze und Betrachtung fremden Familienglücks. Zornig ging ich nach Hause, mischte Kognak und Wasser, schluckte dazu meine Gichtpillen hinunter, legte mich auf den Diwan und versuchte zu lesen. Als es mir endlich gelungen war, eine Weile in »Sophiens Reise von Memel nach Sachsen« zu lesen, einem entzückenden Schmöker aus dem achtzehnten Jahrhundert, fiel mir plötzlich die Einladung wieder ein und daß ich nicht rasiert war und daß ich mich anziehen müsse. Weiß Gott, warum ich mir das angetan hatte! Also, Harry, steh auf, lege dein Buch weg, seife dich ein, kratze dir das Kinn blutig, zieh dich an und habe ein Wohlgefallen an den Menschen! Und während ich mich einseifte, dachte ich an das dreckige Lehmloch im Friedhof, in das man heut den Unbekannten hinuntergeseilt hatte, und an die verkniffenen Gesichter der gelangweilten Mitchristen und konnte nicht einmal darüber lachen. Dort endete, so schien mir, an jenem dreckigen Lehmloch, bei den dummen verlegenen Worten des Predigers, bei den dummen verlegenen Mienen der Trauerversammlung, bei dem trostlosen Anblick all der Kreuze und Tafeln aus Blech und Marmor, bei all den falschen Drahtund Glasblumen, dort endete nicht nur der Unbekannte, dort würde nicht nur morgen oder übermorgen auch ich enden, verscharrt, unter Verlegenheit und Verlogenheit der Teilnehmer in den Dreck gescharrt, nein, so endete alles, unser ganzes Streben, unsre ganze Kultur, unser ganzer Glaube, unsre ganze Lebensfreude und Lebenslust, die so sehr krank war und bald auch dort eingescharrt werden würde. Ein Friedhof war unsre Kulturwelt, hier waren Jesus Christus und Sokrates, hier waren Mozart und Haydn, waren Dante und Goethe bloß noch erblindete Namen auf rostenden Blechtafeln, umstanden von verlegenen und verlogenen Trauernden, die viel dafür gegeben hätten, wenn sie an die Blechtafeln noch hätten glauben können, die ihnen einst heilig gewesen waren, die viel dafür gegeben hätten, auch nur wenigstens ein redliches, ernstes Wort der Trauer und Verzweiflung über diese untergegangene Welt sagen zu können, und denen statt allem nichts blieb als das verlegne grinsende Herumstehen an einem Grab. Wütend kratzte ich mir am Kinn die ewige Stelle wieder auf und ätzte eine Weile an der Wunde, mußte aber dennoch den eben angelegten frischen Kragen nochmals wechseln und wußte durchaus nicht, warum ich das alles tue, denn ich fühlte nicht die mindeste Lust, zu jener Einladung zu gehen. Aber ein Stück von Harry spielte wieder Theater, nannte den Professor einen sympathischen Kerl, sehnte sich nach ein wenig Menschengeruch, Schwatz und Geselligkeit, erinnerte sich an des Professors hübsche Frau, fand den Gedanken an einen Abend bei freundlichen Gastgebern im Grunde doch recht ermunternd und half mir ein englisches Pflaster aufs Kinn kleben, half mir mich anziehen und eine anständige Krawatte umbinden und brachte mich sanft davon ab, meinem eigentlichen Wunsch zu folgen und zu Hause zu bleiben. Zugleich dachte ich: so wie ich jetzt mich anziehe und ausgehe, den Professor besuche und mehr oder weniger erlogene Artigkeiten mit ihm austausche, alles ohne es eigentlich zu wollen, so tun und leben und handeln die meisten Menschen Tag für Tag, Stunde um Stunde zwanghaft und ohne es eigentlich zu wollen, machen Besuche, führen Unterhaltungen, sitzen Amts- und Bürostunden ab, alles zwanghaft, mechanisch, ungewollt, alles könnte ebensogut von Maschinen gemacht werden oder unterbleiben; und diese ewig fortlaufende Mechanik ist es, die sie hindert, gleich mir, Kritik am eigenen Leben zu üben, seine Dummheit und Seichtheit, seine scheußlich grinsende Fragwürdigkeit, seine hoffnungslose Trauer und Öde zu erkennen und zu fühlen. O, und sie haben recht, unendlich recht, die Menschen, daß sie so leben, daß sie ihre Spielchen spielen und ihren Wichtigkeiten nachlaufen, statt sich gegen die betrübende Mechanik zu wehren und verzweifelt ins Leere zu starren, wie ich entgleister Mensch es tue. Wenn ich in diesen Blättern zuweilen die Menschen verachte und auch verspotte, so glaube doch darum niemand, daß ich ihnen die Schuld zuwälzen, daß ich sie anklagen, daß ich andre für mein persönliches Elend verantwortlich machen möchte! Ich aber, der ich nun einmal so weit gegangen bin und am Rande des Lebens stehe, wo es ins bodenlose Dunkel fällt, ich tue unrecht und lüge, wenn ich mir und andern vorzutäuschen versuche, als laufe auch für mich jene Mechanik noch, als sei auch ich noch zu jener holden kindlichen Welt des ewigen Spiels gehörig!","Over the argument between the two Harrys, the professor was all but forgotten; suddenly he was a nuisance to me again and I rushed to get rid of him. I watched him for a long time as he walked away under the bare avenue with the good-natured and somewhat comical gait of an idealist, a believer. The battle raged violently inside me, and while I mechanically flexed and stretched my stiff fingers in the struggle with the secretly burrowing gout, I had to admit to myself that I had let myself be duped, that I was now invited to half past seven p.m. for supper, along with obligations of pleasantries, scientific gossip, and contemplation of the happiness of other people's families. I went home angrily, mixed cognac and water, swallowed my gout pills, lay down on the divan and tried to read. When I finally managed to read for a while Sophie's Journey from Memel to Saxony, a delightful eighteenth-century book, I suddenly remembered the invitation and that I wasn't shaved and that I had to get dressed. God knows why I did this to myself! So, Harry, get up, put down your book, lather up, scratch your chin until it bleeds, get dressed and have a good time with people! And while I lathered myself, I thought of the dirty mud hole in the cemetery into which the stranger had been roped down today and of the pinched faces of the bored fellow Christians, and I couldn't even laugh about it. There it ended, it seemed to me, at that filthy mud hole, at the stupid, embarrassed words of the preacher, at the stupid, embarrassed faces of the mourners, at the desolate sight of all the crosses and plaques of tin and marble, with all the fake wire and glass flowers, there not only did the stranger end, not only would I end up there tomorrow or the day after, buried, buried in the dirt to the embarrassment and mendacity of the participants, no, that’s how everything ended, our whole striving, our whole culture, our whole faith, our whole Joie de vivre and lust for life, which was so very ill and would soon be buried there too. Our cultural world was a cemetery, here were Jesus Christ and Socrates, here were Mozart and Haydn, Dante and Goethe were just blind names on rusting tin plaques, surrounded by embarrassed and lying mourners who would have given a lot to have them still on the tin plaques could have believed, who had once been sacred to them, who would have given a lot to be able to say at least one honest, serious word of sadness and despair about this vanished world, and who instead of everything had nothing left but the embarrassed grinning standing around at you Dig. Angered, I scratched the permanent spot on my chin again and etched the wound for a while, but still had to change the fresh collar I had just put on and didn't know at all why I was doing all this, because I didn't feel the slightest desire to go back to that one invitation to go. But a play by Harry acted again, called the professor a sympathetic fellow, longed for a little human scent, chatter and sociability, remembered the professor's pretty wife, actually found the idea of an evening with friendly hosts quite encouraging and helped put an English plaster on my chin, helped me get dressed and put on a decent tie, and gently dissuaded me from following my real desire to stay at home. At the same time I thought: the way I dress and go out, visit the professor and exchange more or less bogus niceties with him, all without really wanting to, is how most people do and live and act day after day, hour after hour, obsessively and without actually wanting to, they make visits, have conversations, serve official and office hours, everything is compulsive, mechanical, unwanted, everything could just as well be done by machines or not at all; and it is this eternally ongoing mechanism that prevents them, like me, from criticizing their own life, from recognizing and feeling its stupidity and shallowness, its hideously grinning dubiousness, its hopeless sadness and emptiness. Oh, and they are right, infinitely right, the people, that they live by playing their little games and chasing after their important things instead of resisting the sad mechanics and staring despairingly into space, as I do, derailed human being. If I sometimes despise and mock people in these papers, no one believes that I am shifting the blame to them, that I am accusing them, that I want to make others responsible for my personal misery! But I, who have gone so far and am standing on the edge of life, where it falls into the bottomless darkness, I do wrong and lie when I try to pretend to myself and others that those mechanics still work for me as well I too still belong to that lovely childish world of eternal play!","While my two selves were thus locked in conflict, the professor was almost forgotten; and when the oppressiveness of his presence came suddenly back to me, I made haste to be relieved of it. I looked after him for a long while as he disappeared into the distance along the leafless avenue with the good-natured and slightly comic gait of an ingenuous idealist. Within me, the battle raged furiously. Mechanically I bent and unbent my stiffened fingers as though to fight the ravages of a secret poison, and at the same time had to realize that I had been nicely framed. Round my neck was the invitation for 8:30, with all its obligations of politeness, of talking shop and of contemplating another's domestic bliss. And so home—in wrath. Once there, I poured myself out some brandy and water, swallowed some of my gout pills with it, and, lying on the sofa, tried to read. No sooner had I succeeded in losing myself for a moment in Sophia's Journey from Memel to Saxony, a delightful old book of the eighteenth century, than the invitation came over me of a sudden and reminded me that I was neither shaved nor dressed. Why, in heaven's name, had I brought all this on myself? Well, get up , so I told myself, lather yourself, scrape your chin till it bleeds, dress and show an amiable disposition towards your fellow-men. And while I lathered my face, I thought of that sordid hole in the clay of the cemetery into which some unknown person had been lowered that day. I thought of the pinched faces of the bored fellow-Christians and I could not even laugh. There in that sordid hole in the clay, I thought, to the accompaniment of stupid and insincere ministrations and the no less stupid and insincere demeanor of the group of mourners, in the discomforting sight of all the metal crosses and marble slabs and artificial flowers of wire and glass, ended not only that unknown man, and, tomorrow or the day after, myself as well, buried in the soil with a hypocritical show of sorrow— no, there and so ended everything; all our striving, all our culture, all our beliefs, all our joy and pleasure in life—already sick and soon to be buried there too. Our whole civilization was a cemetery where Jesus Christ and Socrates, Mozart and Haydn, Dante and Goethe were but the indecipherable names on moldering stones; and the mourners who stood round affecting a pretence of sorrow would give much to believe in these inscriptions which once were holy, or at least to utter one heart-felt word of grief and despair about this world that is no more. And nothing was left them but the embarrassed grimaces of a company round a grave. As I raged on like this I cut my chin in the usual place and had to apply a caustic to the wound; and even so there was my clean collar , scarce put on, to change again, and all this for an invitation that did not give me the slightest pleasure. And yet a part of me began play-acting again, calling the professor a sympathetic fellow, yearning after a little talk and intercourse with my fellow men, reminding me of the professor's pretty wife, prompting me to believe that an evening spent with my pleasant host and hostess would be in reality positively cheering, helping me to clap some court plaster to my chin, to put on my clothes and tie my tie well, and gently putting me, in fact, far from my genuine desire of staying at home. Whereupon it occurred to me—so it is with every one. Just as I dress and go out to visit the professor and exchange a few more or less insincere compliments with him, without really wanting to at all, so it is with the majority of men day by day and hour by hour in their daily lives and affairs. Without really wanting to at all, they pay calls and carry on conversations, sit out their hours at desks and on office chairs; and it is all compulsory, mechanical and against the grain, and it could all be done or left undone just as well by machines; and indeed it is this never-ceasing machinery that prevents their being, like me, the critics of their own lives and recognizing the stupidity and shallowness, the hopeless tragedy and waste of the lives they lead, and the awful ambiguity grinning over it all. And they are right, right a thousand times to live as they do, playing their games and pursuing their business, instead of resisting the dreary machine and staring into the void as I do, who have left the track. Let no one think that I blame other men, though now and then in these pages I scorn and even deride them, or that I accuse them of the responsibility of my personal misery. But now that I have come so far, and standing as I do on the extreme verge of life where the ground falls away before me into bottomless darkness, I should do wrong and I should lie if I pretended to myself or to others that that machine still revolved for me and that I was still obedient to the eternal child's play of that charming world.","As a result of the dispute between the two Harrys the professor almost got forgotten. Suddenly finding him tiresome again, I rid myself of him as fast as I could. For a long time I watched him go off along the avenue of leafless trees. He had the good-natured, slightly comical walk of an idealist, a man who believed in something. The battle inside me was still raging. Mechanically bending my stiff fingers and stretching them out again in an effort to combat the pangs of gout that were secretly torturing me, I had to admit that I had just allowed myself to be duped. I had now landed myself with an invitation to dinner at half past seven with all that entailed in the way of responsibility to be polite, to indulge in academic chit-chat and to observe the happy family life of others. Making my way angrily back home, I mixed myself a brandy and water, washed down my gout pills with it, lay down on the sofa and tried to read. When I had finally managed a few pages of Sophia’s Journey from Memel to Saxony,2 an enchanting eighteenth-century romance, I suddenly remembered the invitation, and realized that I needed to shave and get dressed. God knows why I had lumbered myself with this! Now then, Harry, on your feet, put the book away, lather your chin and scrape it till it bleeds, dress up and take pleasure in the company of human beings! And while brushing my chin with shaving soap my thoughts turned to that muddy hole in the cemetery into which earlier today they had lowered the stranger’s coffin. Thinking of the pinched faces of the bored brothers and sisters in Christ, I was unable even to raise a laugh. It seemed to me that what I had witnessed there by that muddy hole in the ground, surrounded by the stupid, awkward words of the clergyman, the stupid, awkward expressions on the faces of the assembled mourners, all the dreary crosses and plaques in metal and marble, all the artificial flowers made of wire and glass, was more than just the demise of that stranger. Not only would I myself perish too, tomorrow or the next day; end up being interred in the mud, surrounded by awkward and insincere onlookers, no – that was how everything would end up, all our aspirations, our whole civilization, all we believed in, all the joy and delight we took in life. It would soon be laid to rest there too, so terminally sick had it become. Our whole cultural world was a cemetery in which Jesus Christ and Socrates, Mozart and Haydn, Dante and Goethe were now nothing more than faded names on rusting metal plaques, surrounded by awkward and insincere mourners, who would have given a great deal to have their faith in these once sacred plaques restored to them. They would also have given a lot to be able to utter just one single sincere, serious word of mourning and despair over the demise of this world, instead of which they had no alternative but to stand with awkward grins on their faces around its grave. In my fury I managed to cut my chin with the razor in the same old place again. I spent some time cauterizing the wound, but I still had to replace the clean collar I had just put on. I had absolutely no idea why I was doing all this since I hadn’t the least desire to go to the professor’s. However, one part of Harry was putting on an act again, calling the professor a likeable chap, yearning for a whiff of humanity, a chance to chat, and good company. Recalling that the professor had a pretty wife, this part of Harry was, in spite of everything, basically cheered up by the thought of spending the evening with such friendly hosts. He helped me stick a plaster on my chin and put on a decent tie, thus gently persuading me to abandon my real wish, which was to stay at home. At the same time I was thinking to myself: just as I am now getting dressed, going out to visit the professor and exchange polite remarks with him – all the opposite of what I really want to do – so most human beings spend their lives acting compulsorily, day after day, hour after hour. Without really wanting to, they pay visits, hold conversations, work fixed office hours – all of it compulsorily, mechanically, against their will. It could all be done just as well by machines, or not done at all. And it is this perpetual mechanical motion that prevents them from criticizing their own lives in the way I do, from realizing and feeling just how stupid and shallow, how horribly, grotesquely questionable, how hopelessly sad and barren their existence is. And oh, how right they are, these people, a thousand times right to live the way they do, playing their little games and pursuing what seems important to them instead of resisting this depressing machinery and staring despairingly into the void as individuals who have gone off the rails do, like me. If from time to time I seem to despise and even pour scorn on such people in these pages, let no one think that I wish to accuse others of being responsible for my personal misery or put all the blame on them. However, once you have got to the point where you are standing on the very edge of life like me, gazing down into a dark abyss, it is wrong and dishonest to attempt to deceive yourself and others into believing that life’s machinery is still running smoothly, that you can still be a party to that blissful, childlike world of endless game-playing."

They are an attempt to present the sickness itself in its actual manifestation. They mean, literally, a journey through hell, a sometimes fearful, sometimes courageous journey through the chaos of a world whose souls dwell in darkness, a journey undertaken with the determination to go through hell from one end to the other, to give battle to chaos, and to suffer torture to the full.","It makes no difference how much or how little they are based on real life, these notebooks are an attempt to overcome the great sickness of our times, not by evading or glossing over the issue, but by seeking to make the sickness itself the object portrayed.

But the journey is undertaken with a strong determination to traverse this hell, to face up to the chaos and to endure the bad times to the limit."
"Aus einem Tanzlokal, an dem ich vorüberkam, scholl mir, heiß und roh wie der Dampf von rohem Fleisch, eine heftige Jazzmusik entgegen. Ich blieb einen Augenblick stehen; immer hatte diese Art von Musik, sosehr ich sie verabscheute, einen heimlichen Reiz für mich. Jazz war mir zuwider, aber sie war mir zehnmal lieber als alle akademische Musik von heute, sie traf mit ihrer frohen rohen Wildheit auch bei mir tief in die Triebwelt und atmete eine naive redliche Sinnlichkeit.","From a dance hall I passed, fierce jazz music, hot and raw as the steam of raw meat, erupted at me. I stopped for a moment; this kind of music, no matter how much I hated it, always had a secret attraction for me. I hated jazz, but I preferred it ten times over to all academic music of today. With its happy, raw wildness it struck deep into my instinctual world and exuded a naïve, honest sensuality.","From a dance hall there met me as I passed by the strains of lively jazz music, hot and raw as the steam of raw flesh. I stopped a moment. This kind of music, much as I detested it, had always had a secret charm for me. It was repugnant to me, and yet ten times preferable to all the academic music of the day. For me too, its raw and savage gaiety reached an underworld of instinct and breathed a simple honest sensuality.","As I walked by a dance hall a loud blast of jazz music hit me, hot and raw like the vapour raw meat exudes. For a moment I stopped. Much as I abhorred it, this kind of music had always held a secret attraction for me. I found jazz repellent, but it was ten times better than contemporary academic music. Naively and genuinely sensual, its breezy, raw savagery could even affect the likes of me at a deep instinctual level."
"»Immer so wie heute? Immer nur eine Welt für Politiker, Schieber, Kellner und Lebemänner, und keine Luft für Menschen?« »Nun ja, ich weiß es nicht, niemand weiß das. Es ist auch einerlei. Aber ich denke jetzt an deinen Liebling, mein Freund, von dem du mir zuweilen erzählt und auch Briefe vorgelesen hast, an Mozart. Wie war es denn mit dem? Wer hat zu seinen Zeiten die Welt regiert, den Rahm abgeschöpft, den Ton angegeben und etwas gegolten: Mozart oder die Geschäftemacher, Mozart oder die flachen Dutzendmenschen? Und wie ist er gestorben und begraben worden? Und so, meine ich, ist es vielleicht immer gewesen und wird immer sein, und das, was sie in den Schulen ›Weltgeschichte‹ heißen und was man da auswendig lernen muß für die Bildung, mit allen den Helden, Genies, großen Taten und Gefühlen – das ist bloß ein Schwindel, von den Schullehrern erfunden, für Bildungszwecke und damit die Kinder während der vorgeschriebenen Jahre doch mit etwas beschäftigt sind. Immer ist es so gewesen und wird immer so sein, daß die Zeit und die Welt, das Geld und die Macht den Kleinen und Flachen gehört, und den andern, den eigentlichen Menschen, gehört nichts. Nichts als der Tod.«","“Always like today? Always a world for politicians, racketeers, waiters and bon vivants, and no air for people?' 'Well, I don't know, nobody knows. It doesn't matter either. But now I'm thinking of your darling, my friend, about whom you sometimes told me and also read letters, of Mozart. How was that? Who ruled the world in his time, skimmed off the cream, set the tone and counted: Mozart or the profiteers, Mozart or the shallow dozen people? And how did he die and how was he buried? And so, I think, it has perhaps always been and always will be, and what they call 'world history' in schools and what one has to learn by heart for education, with all the heroes, geniuses, great deeds and feelings - this is just a hoax invented by the school teachers for educational purposes and to keep the children busy during the prescribed years after all. It has always been and will always be the case that time and the world, money and power belong to the small and shallow, and the others, the real people, own nothing. Nothing but death.«","""Always as it is today? Always a world only for politicians, profiteers, waiters and pleasure-seekers, and not a breath of air for men?"" ""Well, I don't know. Nobody knows. Anyway, it is all the same. But I am thinking now of your favorite of whom you have talked to me sometimes, and read me, too, some of his letters, of Mozart. How was it with him in his day? Who controlled things in his times and ruled the roost and gave the tone and counted for something? Was it Mozart or the business people, Mozart or the average man? And in what fashion did he come to die and be buried? And perhaps, I mean, it has always been the same and always will be, and what is called history at school, and all we learn by heart there about heroes and geniuses and great deeds and fine emotions, is all nothing but a swindle invented by the schoolmasters for educational reasons to keep children occupied for a given number of years. It has always been so and always will be. Time and the world, money and power belong to the small people and the shallow people. To the rest, to the real men belongs nothing. Nothing but death.""","‘Always like today? Always a world fit for politicians, conmen, waiters and playboys, a world where there is no air fit for human beings to breathe?’ ‘Who knows? I don’t, nobody does. It makes no difference anyway. But now I’m wondering what it must have been like for your great favourite Mozart, whom you’ve told me about from time to time, even reading to me from his letters. How was it for him? Who was ruling the world in his day, creaming off the best, setting the tone, and considered important? Was it Mozart or the profit-seekers, Mozart or shallow, run-of-the-mill types? And how did he die? How did they bury him? And I think it has perhaps always been like that and always will be. And the subject they call “World History” in schools and the things you have to learn off by heart in them in order to be educated – all those heroes, geniuses, great deeds and sentiments – is just a confidence trick devised by the schoolteachers for the purposes of education and to give the children something to keep them occupied during the prescribed years of schooling. It has always been the case and always will be that time and the world, wealth and power belong to those who are petty and shallow, whereas the rest, the real human beings, have nothing. Nothing other than death.’"
"Goethe aber sagte sehr freundlich: »Daß ich zweiundachtzig Jahre alt geworden bin, mag immerhin unverzeihlich sein. Mein Vergnügen daran war indessen geringer, als Sie denken mögen. Sie haben recht: ein großes Verlangen nach Dauer hat mich stets erfüllt, ich habe stets den Tod gefürchtet und bekämpft. Ich glaube, der Kampf gegen den Tod, das unbedingte und eigensinnige Lebenwollen ist der Antrieb, aus welchem alle hervorragenden Menschen gehandelt und gelebt haben. Daß man am Ende dennoch sterben muß, dies hingegen, mein junger Freund, habe ich mit zweiundachtzig Jahren ebenso bündig bewiesen, wie wenn ich als Schulknabe gestorben wäre. Wenn es zu meiner Rechtfertigung dienen kann, möchte ich dies noch sagen: in meiner Natur ist viel Kindliches gewesen, viel Neugierde und Spieltrieb, viel Lust zum Zeitvergeuden. Nun, und da habe ich eben etwas lange gebraucht, bis ich einsah, es müsse des Spielens einmal genug sein.«","But Goethe said very kindly: ""The fact that I lived to be eighty-two may still be unforgivable. My enjoyment of it, however, was less than you may think. You are right: I have always had a great longing for permanence, I have always feared and fought death. I believe that the fight against death, the unconditional and obstinate will to live is what drives all outstanding people to act and live. However, my young friend, at the age of eighty-two I proved just as succinctly that in the end one has to die, just as if I had died as a schoolboy. If it can serve to justify myself, I would like to say this: there was a lot of childishness in my nature, a lot of curiosity and an instinct to play, a lot of pleasure in wasting time. Well, and it just took me a long time to realize that playing once had to be enough.«","Goethe, however, said very amiably: ""It may be unforgivable that I lived to be eighty-two. My satisfaction on that account was, however, less than you may think. You are right that a great longing for survival possessed me continually. I was in continual fear of death and continually struggling with it. I believe that the struggle against death, the unconditional and self-willed determination to live, is the motive power behind the lives and activities of all outstanding men. My eighty-two years showed just as conclusively that we must all die in the end as if I had died as a schoolboy. If it helps to justify me I should like to say this too: my nature had much of the child in it, its curiosity and love for idleness and play. Well, and so it went on and on, till I saw that sooner or later there must be enough of play.""","However, Goethe replied amiably: ‘It may well be unforgivable of me to have lived to the age of eighty-two, but I derived less pleasure from doing so than you may think. You are correct in saying that I was always filled with a great desire for lasting significance, and I did constantly fear and battle against death. It is my belief that the struggle against death, the stubborn, unconditional desire for life is what has driven all outstanding human beings to act and live their lives as they did. On the other hand, my young friend, the fact that one must nevertheless ultimately die is something that I proved at the age of eighty-two just as conclusively as if I had died as a schoolboy. And by way of self-justification, if it helps, I’d like to add that there was a great deal in my make-up that was childlike, a lot of curiosity and playfulness, much delight taken in wasting time. There, and the fact is it took me a fair amount of time to realize that one day the playing had to stop.’"

Admittedly, I was very unhappy at the time. But it was a stupid misfortune, a sterile one.""","""No, Hermine, it is something else. That time, I grant you, I was very unhappy.

"»Der Figuren, in welche Sie Ihre sogenannte Persönlichkeit haben zerfallen sehen. Ohne Figuren kann ich ja nicht spielen.« Er hielt mir einen Spiegel vor, wieder sah ich darin die Einheit meiner Person in viele Ichs zerfallen, ihre Zahl schien noch gewachsen zu sein. Die Figuren waren aber jetzt sehr klein, so groß etwa wie handliche Schachfiguren, und der Spieler nahm mit stillen, sichern Fingergriffen einige Dutzend davon und stellte sie neben dem Schachbrett an den Boden. Eintönig sprach er dazu, wie ein Mann, der eine oft gehaltene Rede oder Lektion wiederholt:","'The figures into which you have seen your so-called personality disintegrate. After all, I can't play without characters.« He held up a mirror in front of me. Again I saw the unity of my person disintegrate into many egos, their number seemed to have increased. But the pieces were now very small, about the size of handy chess pieces, and the player took a few dozen of them with quiet sure finger grips and placed them on the floor by the chessboard. He spoke monotonously, like a man repeating a speech or lesson often given:","""Of the pieces into which you saw your so-called personality broken up. I can't play without pieces."" He held a glass up to me and again I saw the unity of my personality broken up into many selves whose number seemed even to have increased. The pieces were now, however, very small, about the size of chessmen. The player took a dozen or so of them in his sure and quiet fingers and placed them on the ground near the board. As he did so he began to speak in the monotonous way of one who goes through a recitation or reading that he has often gone through before.","‘The pieces you saw your so-called personality disintegrate into. I can’t play without pieces, you know.’ He held a mirror up in front of me and in it I again saw my unified self disintegrate into many separate figures. There seemed to be an even larger number of them now, but they were very small, roughly as big as handy-sized chessmen. Picking up a few dozen of them with his calm, steady fingers, the chess player placed them on the floor next to his board. As he did so, he said in a monotonous voice, like someone repeating a speech or a lesson he has frequently given before:"
"Er lachte mich herzlich an und blieb diesmal die Antwort nicht schuldig, sondern sagte gleichmütig: »Sehen Sie, es hat nach meiner Meinung gar keinen Wert, über Musik zu sprechen. Ich spreche niemals über Musik. Was hätte ich Ihnen denn auch antworten sollen auf Ihre sehr klugen und richtigen Worte? Sie hatten ja so sehr recht mit allem, was Sie sagten. Aber sehen Sie, ich bin Musikant, nicht Gelehrter, und ich glaube nicht, daß in der Musik das Rechthaben den geringsten Wert hat. Es kommt ja in der Musik nicht darauf an, daß man recht hat, daß man Geschmack und Bildung hat und all das.«","He laughed heartily at me and this time didn't shy away from answering, but said evenly: 'You see, in my opinion there's no point in talking about music. I never talk about music. How should I have answered your very clever and correct words? You were so right in everything you said. But you see, I'm a musician, not a scholar, and I don't think that being right is of the least value in music. In music it is not important that you are right, that you have taste and education and all that.«","He gave me a most amiable smile and this time a reply was accorded me. ""Well,"" he said with equanimity, ""you see, in my opinion there is no point at all in talking about music. I never talk about music. What reply, then, was I to make to your very able and just remarks? You were perfectly right in all you said. But, you see, I am a musician, not a professor, and I don't believe that, as regards music, there is the least point in being right. Music does not depend on being right, on having good taste and education and all that.""","Laughing at me heartily, he didn’t fail to answer this time but calmly said: ‘You see, in my opinion, talking about music is of no value. I never talk about music. I ask you, what should I have replied to your astute and accurate remarks? Everything you said was so right, you see. But listen, I’m a musician, not a scholar, and I don’t believe that being right is of the slightest value where music is concerned. With music, it’s not a matter of being right, or of taste and education and all that.’"
"»Das mit dem Foxtrott, ich mußte die ganze Zeit daran denken. Also sag: hast du ein Zimmer, in dem wir zwei hie und da eine Stunde tanzen könnten?

Dann kannst du zu Hause tanzen lernen.«","'That foxtrot thing, I kept thinking about it. So tell me: do you have a room where the two of us could dance for an hour every now and then?

Well, that's fine, you can learn to dance at home.""","‘What I was saying about the foxtrot. I couldn’t get it out of my head the whole time. Tell me, have you got a room that the two of us can dance in for an hour or so every now and then? It needn’t be very big, that doesn’t matter, but there mustn’t be anyone living below you who is just the sort to come up and make a scene if the ceiling starts to shake a bit above. Yes? That’s fine then, very good. In that case you can learn to dance at home.’"
"Im großen Wandspiegel stand Harry mir gegenüber. Er sah nicht gut aus, er sah nicht viel anders aus, als er in jener Nacht nach dem Professorenbesuch und dem Ball im Schwarzen Adler ausgesehen hatte. Aber das lag weit zurück, Jahre, Jahrhunderte; Harry war älter geworden, er hatte tanzen gelernt, hatte magische Theater besucht, er hatte Mozart lachen gehört, er hatte vor Tänzen, vor Frauen, vor Messern keine Angst mehr. Auch der mäßig Begabte, wenn er ein paar Jahrhunderte durchrannt hat, wird reif. Lange sah ich Harry im Spiegel an: noch kannte ich ihn wohl, noch immer glich er ein ganz klein wenig dem Harry von fünfzehn Jahren, der an einem Märzsonntag in den Felsen der Rosa begegnet war und seinen Konfirmandenhut vor ihr gezogen hatte. Und doch war er seither einige hundert Jährchen älter geworden, hatte Musik und Philosophie getrieben und sattgekriegt, hatte im »Stahlhelm« Elsässer gesoffen und mit biederen Gelehrten über Krishna disputiert, hatte Erika und Maria geliebt, war Herminens Freund geworden, hatte Automobile abgeschossen und mit der glatten Chinesin geschlafen, hatte Goethe und Mozart angetroffen und verschiedene Löcher in das Netz der Zeit und der Scheinwirklichkeit gerissen, in dem er noch gefangen war. Hatte er auch seine hübschen Schachfiguren wieder verloren, so hatte er doch ein braves Messer in der Tasche. Vorwärts, alter Harry, alter müder Kerl!","Harry faced me in the large wall mirror. He didn't look well, he didn't look much different than he had looked that night after the professor's visit and the ball at the Schwarzer Adler. But that was a long time ago, years, centuries; Harry had grown older, he had learned to dance, had attended magical theatres, he had heard Mozart laugh, he was no longer afraid of dances, of women, of knives. Even the moderately talented, when he has run through a few centuries, becomes mature. I looked at Harry in the mirror for a long time: I still knew him well, he still looked a little like Harry of fifteen, who had met Rosa on a March Sunday in the rocks and had doffed his confirmation hat to her. And yet since then he had grown a few hundred years older, had played music and philosophy and had had enough, had drunk Alsatian in the ""Stahlhelm"" and argued about Krishna with honest scholars, had loved Erika and Maria, had become Hermione's friend, had shot down automobiles and with slept with the smooth Chinese woman, had met Goethe and Mozart and had torn various holes in the web of time and the illusionary reality in which he was still caught. Even if he had lost his pretty chess pieces again, he still had a good knife in his pocket. Onward old Harry, tired old fellow!","In the great mirror, Harry stood opposite me. He did not appear to be very flourishing. His appearance was much the same as on that night when he visited the professor and sat through the dance at the Black Eagle. But that was far behind, years, centuries behind. He had grown older. He had learned to dance. He had visited the magic theater. He had heard Mozart laugh. Dancing and women and knives had no more terrors for him. Even those who have average gifts, given a few hundred years, come to maturity. I looked for a long time at Harry in the looking glass. I still knew him well enough, and he still bore a faint resemblance to the boy of fifteen who one Sunday in March had met Rosa on the cliffs and taken off his school cap to her. And yet he had grown a few centuries older since then. He had pursued philosophy and music and had his fill of war and his Elsasser at the Steel Helmet and discussed Krishna with men of honest learning. He had loved Erica and Maria, and had been Hermine's friend, and shot down motorcars, and slept with the sleek Chinese, and encountered Mozart and Goethe, and made sundry holes in the web of time and rents in reality's disguise, though it held him a prisoner still. And suppose he had lost his pretty chessman again, still he had a fine blade in his pocket. On then, old Harry, old weary loon.","Harry was facing me in the large mirror on the wall. He did not look well. He looked much the same as on that night after his visit to the professor’s and the dance in the Black Eagle. But that was in the distant past, years, centuries ago. Harry was older now, he had learned to dance, visited the Magic Theatre, heard Mozart laugh. He was no longer frightened of dances, women or knives. Even a moderately talented person matures if he has raced his way through a few centuries. I took a long look at Harry in the mirror. I could still recognize him all right. He still looked a tiny bit like the fifteen-year-old Harry who had encountered Rosa one Sunday in March up in the rocks and, fresh from his confirmation, had raised his hat to her. Yet since then he had grown a good few hundred years older, had studied music and philosophy to the point were he was fed up with both, had drunk his fill of Alsace wine in the Steel Helmet, had taken part in debates on the God Krishna with reputable scholars, had loved Erika and Maria, made friends with Hermione, shot down passing cars and slept with that sleek Chinese woman in Marseille. In meetings with Goethe and Mozart he had also managed to tear various holes in the mesh of time and pseudo-reality in which he remained trapped. And even though he had lost his precious chessmen, he still had a trusty knife in his pocket. Onwards, Harry, old man, weary old chap!"
"Meine Verteidigung klang mir selbst, der ich eben noch treuherzig an sie geglaubt hatte, unversehens recht töricht. Als einst Hermine – so erinnerte ich mich plötzlich – über Zeit und Ewigkeit gesprochen hatte, da war ich sofort bereit gewesen, ihre Gedanken für ein Spiegelbild meiner eigenen Gedanken anzusehen. Daß aber der Gedanke, sich von mir töten zu lassen, Herminens eigenster Einfall und Wunsch und von mir nicht im mindesten beeinflußt sei, hatte ich als selbstverständlich angenommen. Aber warum hatte ich damals diesen so schrecklichen und so befremdlichen Gedanken nicht bloß angenommen und geglaubt, sondern sogar im voraus erraten? Vielleicht doch, weil es mein eigener war? Und warum hatte ich Hermine gerade in dem Augenblick umgebracht, wo ich sie nackt in den Armen eines andern fand? Allwissend und voll Spott klang Mozarts lautloses Lachen.","My defense suddenly sounded very foolish to me, who had just honestly believed in it. Once, I suddenly remembered, when Hermione had talked about time and eternity, I had been instantly willing to see her thoughts as a reflection of my own thoughts. But I had taken it for granted that the idea of letting me kill her was Hermione's own idea and wish and not in the least influenced by me. But why had I not only accepted and believed this so terrible and so strange thought at the time, but even guessed it in advance? Maybe because it was my own? And why did I kill Hermione the moment I found her naked in someone else's arms? Mozart's silent laughter sounded omniscient and full of mockery.","My self-extenuation sounded unexpectedly and thoroughly foolish even to me who had believed in it with all my heart. When Hermine had once, so it suddenly occurred to me, spoken about time and eternity, I had been ready forthwith to take her thoughts as a reflection of my own. That the thought, however, of dying by my hand had been her own inspiration and wish and not in the least influenced by me I had taken as a matter of course. But why on that occasion had I not only accepted that horrible and unnatural thought, but even guessed it in advance. Perhaps because it had been my own. And why had I murdered Hermine just at the very moment when I saw her lying naked in another's arms? All-knowing and all-mocking rang Mozart's soundless laughter.","Suddenly my defence sounded really foolish to me, even though I had still sincerely believed what I was saying only a moment ago. Now, all at once, I recalled that occasion when Hermione had been speaking of time and eternity. Then, I had immediately been willing to regard her thoughts as a reflection of my own. Yet I had taken for granted that getting me to kill her was entirely her own idea and wish, uninfluenced by me in the least. But if so, why had I not only accepted and believed a notion as horrific and strange as that at the time, but even guessed it in advance? Perhaps because it was my own idea after all? And why, of all times, had I killed Hermione when I found her naked in the arms of someone else? Mozart’s silent laughter seemed all-knowing and full of scorn."
"»Bist du das?« fragte Hermine und zeigte auf meinen Namen. »Nun, da hast du dir ordentlich Feinde gemacht, Harry. Ärgert es dich?«","""Is that you?"" Hermione asked, pointing to my name. 'Well, you've made quite a few enemies there, Harry. Does it annoy you?'","""Is that you?"" asked Hermine, pointing to my name. "" Well, you've made yourself some enemies and no mistake. Does it annoy you?""","‘Is this you?’ Hermione asked, pointing to my name. ‘If so, Harry, it seems you haven’t half made some enemies. Does it bother you?’"
"»Es geht dir jetzt eigentlich recht gut«, sagte sie, »das Tanzen bekommt dir.

"Ich streckte die Hand aus und wollte das kleine Bein an mich nehmen, das mich ganz verliebt machte, aber sowie ich mit zwei Fingern zugreifen wollte, schien das Spielzeug sich mit einem winzigen Zuck zu bewegen, und es kam mir plötzlich der Verdacht, dies könne der Skorpion sein. Goethe schien das zu begreifen, schien sogar gerade dies gewollt und bezweckt zu haben, diese tiefe Verlegenheit, diesen zuckenden Zwiespalt von Begehren und Angst. Er hielt mir das reizende Skorpiönchen ganz nahe vors Gesicht, sah mich danach verlangen, sah mich davor zurückschaudern, und dies schien ihm ein großes Vergnügen zu machen. Während er mich mit dem holden gefährlichen Ding neckte, war er wieder ganz alt geworden, uralt, tausend Jahre alt, mit schneeweißem Haar, und sein welkes Greisengesicht lachte still und lautlos, lachte heftig in sich hinein mit einem abgründigen Greisenhumor.","I reached out and tried to grab the little leg, which made me fall in love, but as soon as I tried to grab it with two fingers, the toy seemed to move with a tiny twitch, and I suddenly suspected that it could be the scorpion. Goethe seemed to understand this, even seemed to have wanted and aimed for this, this deep embarrassment, this twitching dichotomy of desire and fear. He held the lovely little scorpion very close to my face, saw me longing for it, saw me shrink from it, and this seemed to give him great pleasure. While he was teasing me with the sweet, dangerous thing, he had grown very old again, very old, a thousand years old, with snow-white hair, and his withered old face laughed quietly and silently, laughing heartily to itself with an abysmal old-age humor.","I stretched out my hand, for I had quite fallen in love with the little leg and I wanted to have it, but just as I was going to take hold of it with my finger and thumb, the little toy seemed to move with a tiny start and it occurred to me suddenly that this might be the scorpion. Goethe seemed to read my thought, and even to have wanted to cause this deep timidity, this hectic struggle between desire and dread. He held the provoking little scorpion close to my face and watched me start forward with desire, then start back with dread; and this seemed to divert him exceedingly. While he was teasing me with the charming, dangerous thing, he became quite old once more, very, very old, a thousand years old, with hair as white as snow, and his withered graybeard's face laughed a still and soundless laughter that shook him to the depths with abysmal old-man's humor.","Utterly enamoured, I held out my hand, intending to take hold of the little leg, but just as I was about to seize it with two fingers, the toy limb seemed to make a tiny jerking movement and at once I suspected that it might be the scorpion. Goethe appeared to understand my reaction, seemed indeed deliberately to have placed me in a deep quandary, making me wince, as desire fought inside me against fear. Dangling the charming little scorpion really close to my face, he saw me both yearn for and shrink back from it, and this seemed to give him the greatest of pleasure. While taunting me with this charming, dangerous object he had aged again. He was really ancient now, a thousand years old, his hair white as snow, his withered old man’s face silently laughing. Without making a sound, he was chortling away to himself with the dark, inscrutable kind of humour typical of the very old."
"Ganz kalt sah sie mich an, voller Verachtung, und wieder sprach aus ihrem Gesicht etwas, was mich an frühe Jugendzeiten erinnerte.","She looked at me very coldly, full of contempt, and again something spoke out of her face that reminded me of my early youth.","She looked at me quite coldly, with real contempt, and again something in her face reminded me of my youth.","She gave me a really icy look, full of disdain.

"Meinetwegen, mochte es wunderlich sein! Es war gut, es half, die Laune kam. Über den Wortbrei des Zeitungsartikels stieg mir nachträglich ein erleichterndes Gelächter auf, und urplötzlich fiel mir die vergessene Melodie jenes Bläserpiano wieder ein, wie eine kleine spiegelnde Seifenblase stieg sie in mir hoch, glänzte, spiegelte bunt und klein die ganze Welt und ging sanft wieder auseinander. Wenn es möglich gewesen war, daß diese himmlische kleine Melodie heimlich in meiner Seele wurzelte und eines Tages in mir ihre holde Blume wieder mit allen lieben Farben emportrieb, konnte ich da ganz verloren sein? War ich auch ein verirrtes Tier, das seine Umwelt nicht begriff, so war doch ein Sinn in meinem törichten Leben, etwas in mir gab Antwort, war Empfänger für Anrufe aus fernen hohen Welten, in meinem Gehirn waren tausend Bilder gestapelt:","For my part, it might be strange! It was good, it helped, the mood came. A relieving laugh rose to me at the mush of words in the newspaper article, and all of a sudden I remembered the forgotten melody of that wind piano, it rose up in me like a small, reflecting soap bubble, shone, reflected the whole world colorfully and small, and gently parted again . If it had been possible for this heavenly little melody to take root secretly in my soul and one day to raise its lovely flower in me with all its lovely colors, could I be completely lost? Even if I was a lost animal that didn't understand its surroundings, there was still a meaning in my foolish life, something in me gave an answer, was the recipient of calls from distant, high worlds, a thousand images were stacked in my brain:","I didn't really care whether all this was odd or not. It was good, it helped, it raised my spirits. As I thought again of that newspaper article and its jumble of words, a refreshing laughter rose in me, and suddenly the forgotten melody of those notes of the piano came back to me again. It soared aloft like a soap bubble, reflecting the whole world in miniature on its rainbow surface, and then softly burst. Could I be altogether lost when that heavenly little melody had been secretly rooted within me and now put forth its lovely bloom with all its tender hues? I might be a beast astray, with no sense of its environment, yet there was some meaning in my foolish life, something in me gave an answer and was the receiver of those distant calls from worlds far above. In my brain were stored a thousand pictures:","What did I care whether it was strange! It did me good. It helped to improve my mood. Relieved, I was able to raise a belated laugh at the soggy mess of words in the newspaper article, and suddenly the forgotten melody of that quiet passage in the woodwind came back to me. Like a little radiant soap bubble it rose up inside me, reflecting the whole world in colourful miniature, before gently dispersing again. If it had been possible for this heavenly little melody secretly to put down roots in my soul and one day to blossom forth in me again in all its lovely colours, could I be totally lost? Even if I was a stray animal, unable to understand its environment, my foolish life did have some meaning. There was something in me that responded to things, was receptive to calls from distant worlds above. My brain was a storehouse of a thousand images."
"»Ein kleiner Junge bist du. Und ebenso, wie du zu bequem warst, um tanzen zu lernen, bis es beinah zu spät war, so warst du auch zu bequem, um lieben zu lernen. Ideal und tragisch lieben, o Freund, das kannst du gewiß vortrefflich, ich zweifle nicht daran, alle Achtung davor! Du wirst nun lernen, auch ein wenig gewöhnlich und menschlich zu lieben.

For an hour you've been hearing me call you you and you're still calling me you. Always Latin and Greek, always as complicated as possible!

For an hour now you’ve been listening to me using the familiar form “du”, yet you are still addressing me formally as “Sie”.

There, you’ve learned something new. And secondly: for half an hour now I’ve known that you’re called Harry. Because I asked you your name, that’s why. But you’ve no desire to know what I’m called.’"
"Auch war ich nicht ganz sicher, ob man mich nicht aus Versehen, statt bei Goethe, bei Matthisson angemeldet habe, den ich aber im Traum mit Bürger verwechselte, denn ich schrieb ihm die Gedichte an Molly zu. Übrigens wäre mir ein Zusammentreffen mit Molly höchst erwünscht gewesen, ich dachte sie mir wundervoll, weich, musikalisch, abendlich. Wäre ich nur nicht im Auftrag jener verwünschten Redaktion dagesessen! Mein Unmut hierüber stieg mehr und mehr und übertrug sich allmählich auch auf Goethe, gegen den ich nun mit einemmal alle möglichen Bedenken und Vorwürfe hatte. Das konnte eine schöne Audienz geben! Der Skorpion aber, wenn auch gefährlich und vielleicht in meiner nächsten Nähe versteckt, war doch vielleicht nicht so schlimm; er konnte, so schien mir, vielleicht auch Freundliches bedeuten, es schien mir sehr möglich, daß er irgend etwas mit Molly zu tun habe, eine Art Bote von ihr sei oder ihr Wappentier, ein schönes, gefährliches Wappentier der Weiblichkeit und der Sünde. Konnte das Tier nicht vielleicht Vulpius heißen? Aber da riß ein Diener die Tür auf, ich erhob mich und ging hinein.","I wasn't quite sure whether I had accidentally registered with Matthisson instead of with Goethe, whom I mistook for Bürger in my dream, because I attributed the poems to Molly to him. Incidentally, I would have greatly wished to meet Molly, I thought she was wonderful, soft, musical, evening. If only I hadn't been sitting there on behalf of that accursed editor! My dissatisfaction with this increased more and more and gradually spread to Goethe, against whom I suddenly had all sorts of misgivings and reproaches. That could give a nice audience! But the scorpion, though dangerous and perhaps hidden in my immediate vicinity, was perhaps not so bad; it could, it seemed to me, perhaps also mean something friendly, it seemed to me very possible that it had something to do with Molly, was a kind of messenger from her or her heraldic animal, a beautiful, dangerous heraldic animal of womanhood and sin. Couldn't the animal be called Vulpius? But then a servant threw open the door, I got up and went in.","Also I was not very sure whether I had been announced by a mistake to Matthisson instead of to Goethe, and him again I mixed up in my dream with Bürger, for I took him for the author of the poem to Molly. Moreover I would have liked extremely to meet Molly. I imagined her wonderful, tender, musical. If only I were not here at the orders of that cursed newspaper office. My ill-humor over this increased until by degrees it extended even to Goethe, whom I suddenly treated to all manner of reflections and reproaches. It was going to be a lively interview. The scorpion, however, dangerous though he was and hidden no doubt somewhere within an inch of me, was all the same not so bad perhaps. Possibly he might even betoken something friendly. It seemed to me extremely likely that he had something to do with Molly. He might be a kind of messenger from her—or an heraldic beast, dangerously and beautifully emblematic of woman and sin. Might not his name perhaps be Vulpius? But at that moment a flunkey threw open the door. I rose and went in.","I was not sure either whether I’d been granted an audience with Matthison3 rather than Goethe, but in my dream I must also have confused Matthison with Bürger,4 since I ascribed the Molly poems to him. I would, by the way, have been delighted to meet Molly, whom I imagined to be a wonderful woman: soft, musical, nocturnal. If only I hadn’t been sent there by the editor of that damned magazine! I was getting more and more annoyed at this, and bit by bit my annoyance shifted to Goethe too. Suddenly I found all manner of things to question and criticize him for. A fine audience this might turn out to be! But as for the scorpion, it was perhaps not so bad, even if it were a possible threat lurking somewhere quite close to me. You could, it seemed to me, put a more friendly interpretation on it. Perhaps, I thought, it had something or other to do with Molly. It might be some sort of harbinger of her, or the creature on her crest: a beautiful, dangerous heraldic creature representing femininity and sin. Might not this creature’s name perhaps be Vulpius?5 However, at this point, a servant threw open the door and, rising from my seat, I went in."
"Mit Hermine sprach ich oft lange und sachlich über Maria, über ihre Hände, Schultern, Hüften, über ihre Art zu lachen, zu küssen, zu tanzen.","I often had long, matter-of-fact conversations with Hermione about Maria, about her hands, shoulders, hips, the way she laughed, kissed, and danced.","I often talked at length and in detail about Maria with Hermine, about her hands and shoulders and hips and her way of laughing and kissing and dancing.","Often I would talk to Hermione at length and in a matter-of-fact way about Maria, about her hands, her shoulders, her hips, about the way she laughed, kissed and danced."

Ugh, all that blood! We were ashamed. But even generals are said to have felt that way at times during the war.","""You're not asked to,"" my friend growled. But he did not feel very comfortable either. We had no sooner caught sight of a man whose behavior was harmless and peaceable and childlike and who was still in a state of innocence than all our praise-worthy and most necessary activities became stupid and repulsive. Pah—all that blood! We were ashamed of ourselves. But in the war there must have been generals even who felt the same.","‘Nobody is asking you to,’ my friend muttered. But deep down he too had begun to feel uncomfortable with what we were doing. Scarcely had we set eyes on a human being who was still behaving in a harmless, peaceful, childlike manner, still living in a state of innocence, when all our praiseworthy, necessary activity suddenly struck us as stupid and disgusting. Ugh, all that blood! We were ashamed of ourselves. But then even generals, so they say, occasionally felt ashamed during the war."

"Es ist eine schöne Sache um die Zufriedenheit, um die Schmerzlosigkeit, um diese erträglichen geduckten Tage, wo weder Schmerz noch Lust zu schreien wagt, wo alles nur flüstert und auf Zehen schleicht. Nur steht es mit mir leider so, daß ich gerade diese Zufriedenheit gar nicht gut vertrage, daß sie mir nach kurzer Dauer unausstehlich verhaßt und ekelhaft wird und ich mich verzweiflungsvoll in andre Temperaturen flüchten muß, womöglich auf dem Wege der Lustgefühle, nötigenfalls aber auch auf dem Wege der Schmerzen. Wenn ich eine Weile ohne Lust und ohne Schmerz war und die laue fade Erträglichkeit sogenannter guter Tage geatmet habe, dann wird mir in meiner kindischen Seele so windig weh und elend, daß ich die verrostete Dankbarkeitsleier dem schläfrigen Zufriedenheitsgott ins zufriedene Gesicht schmeiße und lieber einen recht teuflischen Schmerz in mir brennen fühle als diese bekömmliche Zimmertemperatur. Es brennt alsdann in mir eine wilde Begierde nach starken Gefühlen, nach Sensationen, eine Wut auf dies abgetönte, flache, normierte und sterilisierte Leben und eine rasende Lust, irgend etwas kaputtzuschlagen, etwa ein Warenhaus oder eine Kathedrale oder mich selbst, verwegene Dummheiten zu begehen, ein paar verehrten Götzen die Perücken abzureißen, ein paar rebellische Schulbuben mit der ersehnten Fahrkarte nach Hamburg auszurüsten, ein kleines Mädchen zu verführen oder einigen Vertretern der bürgerlichen Weltordnung das Gesicht ins Genick zu drehen. Denn dies haßte, verabscheute und verfluchte ich von allem doch am innigsten: diese Zufriedenheit, diese Gesundheit, Behaglichkeit, diesen gepflegten Optimismus des Bürgers, diese fette gedeihliche Zucht des Mittelmäßigen, Normalen, Durchschnittlichen.","There is a beautiful thing about contentment, about painlessness, about those tolerable crouched days where neither pain nor pleasure dares scream, where everything whispers and tiptoes. Unfortunately, the situation with me is that I just don't tolerate this contentment very well, that after a short time it becomes unbearably hated and disgusting to me, and in desperation I have to flee to other temperatures, possibly on the path of feelings of pleasure, but if necessary also up the path of pain. When I've been without pleasure and pain for a while and have breathed the tepid insipid tolerability of so-called good days, my childish soul feels so nauseous and miserable that I throw the rusty lyre of gratitude in the sleepy God of Contentment's contented face and would rather have one right feel devilish pain burning inside me than this wholesome room temperature. Then a wild desire burns in me for strong feelings, for sensations, an anger at this toned-down, flat, standardized and sterilized life and a raging desire to smash something, maybe a department store or a cathedral or myself to commit daring stupid things ripping off the wigs of a few revered idols, arming a few rebellious schoolboys with the long-awaited ticket to Hamburg, seducing a little girl or turning the faces of some representatives of the bourgeois world order in the neck. For this is what I hated, abhorred and cursed most of all: this contentment, this health, comfort, this cultivated optimism of the bourgeoisie, this fat, profitable breeding of the mediocre, the normal, the average.","There is much to be said for contentment and painlessness, for these bearable and submissive days, on which neither pain nor pleasure is audible, but pass by whispering and on tip-toe. But the worst of it is that it is just this contentment that I cannot endure. After a short time it fills me with irrepressible hatred and nausea. In desperation I have to escape and throw myself on the road to pleasure, or, if that cannot be, on the road to pain. When I have neither pleasure nor pain and have been breathing for a while the lukewarm insipid air of these so-called good and tolerable days, I feel so bad in my childish soul that I smash my moldering lyre of thanksgiving in the face of the slumbering god of contentment and would rather feel the very devil burn in me than this warmth of a well-heated room. A wild longing for strong emotions and sensations seethes in me, a rage against this toneless, flat, normal and sterile life. I have a mad impulse to smash something, a warehouse, perhaps, or a cathedral, or myself, to commit outrages, to pull off the wigs of a few revered idols, to provide a few rebellious schoolboys with the longed-for ticket to Hamburg, or to stand one or two representatives of the established order on their heads. For what I always hated and detested and cursed above all things was this contentment, this healthiness and comfort, this carefully preserved optimism of the middle classes, this fat and prosperous brood of mediocrity.","It’s a fine thing, this contentment, this painlessness, these tolerable days when you keep your head down, when neither pain nor desire dare to raise their voices, when you do everything at a whisper, stealing around on the tips of your toes. But my problem, sad to say, is that precisely this kind of contentment doesn’t agree with me. After a short spell, finding it insufferably detestable and sickening, I have to seek refuge in other climes, possibly by resorting to sensual pleasures, but if necessary even opting for the path of pain. For a short time I can stand to inhale the lukewarm, insipid air of the so-called good days, free of desire and pain. But, childish soul that I am, I then get so madly sore at heart and miserable that I fling my rusty thanksgiving lyre in the smug face of the drowsy god of contentment and opt for a true, devilish pain burning inside me rather than this room temperature so easy on the stomach. At such times a savage desire for strong emotions and sensations burns inside me: a rage against this soft-tinted, shallow, standardized and sterilized life, and a mad craving to smash something up, a department store, say, or a cathedral, or myself. I long to do daringly stupid things: tear the wigs from the heads of a few revered idols, stand the fares of some rebellious schoolboys desperate to visit Hamburg, seduce a little girl, or twist the neck of the odd representative of the bourgeois powers that be. For of all things, what I hated, abhorred and cursed most intensely was just this contentment, this well-being, the well-groomed optimism of the bourgeois, this lush, fertile breeding ground of all that is mediocre, normal, average."

At our next meeting we'll drink to brotherhood, dear fellow. I never liked you better than I do today. And if you still think it worth your while we can philosophize together and argue and talk about music and Mozart and Gluck and Plato and Goethe to your heart's content. You will understand now why it was so impossible before. I wish you good riddance of the Steppenwolf for today at any rate. For naturally, your suicide is not a final one. We are in a magic theater; a world of pictures, not realities. See that you pick out beautiful and cheerful ones and show that you really are not in love with your highly questionable personality any longer. Should you still, however, have a hankering after it , you need only have another look in the mirror that I will now show you. But you know the old proverb: 'A mirror in the hand is worth two on the wall.' Ha! ha!"" (Again that laugh, beautiful and frightful!) ""And now there only remains one little ceremony and quite a jolly one. You have now to cast aside the spectacles of your personality. So come here and look in a proper looking glass. It will give you some fun.""","‘What a good laugh that was, Harry!’ Pablo exclaimed. ‘Well done! One of these days you’ll be able to laugh like the Immortals. At last you’ve managed to kill off Steppenwolf, which it’s impossible to do with a razor. Just make sure he stays dead. In a short while you will be able to leave stupid reality behind you. You are more likeable today than you’ve ever been, my dear chap. We must drink to our close friendship the next time we get the opportunity. Then we can say ‘du’ to one another and, if it still matters to you, we can talk philosophy and argue with one another, discussing music, Mozart and Gluck, Plato and Goethe to your heart’s content. You will understand now why such things were impossible before. – I hope you have succeeded in ridding yourself of Steppenwolf for the day, because of course your suicide is not final. We are not dealing with reality here, but mere images. By choosing beautiful and cheerful images you can demonstrate that you aren’t in fact still in love with your questionable personality. Should you nonetheless feel the urge to have it restored, you need only look into the mirror I am now about to show you. However, I take it you are familiar with the old wise saying “A mirror in the hand is better than two on the wall”. Ha! Ha!’ (Again that fine, terrible laughter of his rang out.) ‘So there, and now we just need to perform one little amusing ritual. Now that you have cast off the spectacles of your personality, come and take a look in a proper mirror. You’ll find it fun.’"
"Sie besorgte mir nochmals ein Brötchen, tat etwas Salz daran, strich ein wenig Senf darauf, schnitt ein Stückchen für sich selber ab und hieß mich essen. Ich aß. Ich hätte alles getan, was sie mich geheißen hätte, alles außer Tanzen. Es tat ungeheuer wohl, jemand zu gehorchen, neben jemand zu sitzen, der einen ausfragte, einem befahl, einen ausschalt. Hätte der Professor oder seine Frau das vor ein paar Stunden getan, es wäre mir viel erspart geblieben. Aber nein, es war gut so, es wäre mir viel entgangen!","She got me another roll, put a little salt on it, spread a little mustard on it, cut off a piece for herself and made me eat it. I ate.

If the professor or his wife had done that a few hours ago, I would have been saved a lot. But no, it was a good thing, I would have missed a lot!","She got another roll for me, put a little salt and mustard on it, cut a piece for herself and told me to eat it.

"Mit gespielter Munterkeit trabte ich über den feucht beschlagenen Asphalt der Gassen, tränend und umflort blickten die Laternenlichter durch die kühlfeuchte Trübe und sogen träge Spiegellichter aus dem nassen Boden. Meine vergessenen Jünglingsjahre fielen mir ein – wie habe ich damals solche finstre und trübe Abende im Spätherbst und Winter geliebt, wie gierig und berauscht sog ich damals die Stimmungen der Einsamkeit und Melancholie, wenn ich halbe Nächte, in den Mantel gehüllt, bei Regen und Sturm durch die feindliche, entblätterte Natur lief, einsam auch damals schon, aber voll tiefen Genießens und voll von Versen, die ich nachher bei Kerzenlicht in meiner Kammer, auf dem Bettrand sitzend, aufschrieb! Nun, dies war vorüber, dieser Becher war ausgetrunken und wurde mir nicht mehr gefüllt. War es schade darum? Es war nicht schade darum. Es war um nichts schade, was vorüber war. Schade war es um das Jetzt und Heute, um all diese ungezählten Stunden und Tage, die ich verlor, die ich nur erlitt, die weder Geschenke noch Erschütterungen brachten. Aber Gott sei gelobt, es gab auch Ausnahmen, es gab zuweilen, selten, auch andre Stunden, die brachten Erschütterungen, brachten Geschenke, rissen Wände ein und brachten mich Verirrten wieder zurück ans lebendige Herz der Welt. Traurig und doch zu innerst angeregt suchte ich mich des letzten Erlebnisses dieser Art zu erinnern. Es war bei einem Konzert gewesen, eine herrliche alte Musik wurde gespielt, da war zwischen zwei Takten eines von Holzbläsern gespielten Piano mir plötzlich wieder die Tür zum Jenseits aufgegangen, ich hatte Himmel durchflogen und Gott an der Arbeit gesehen, hatte selige Schmerzen gelitten und mich gegen nichts mehr in der Welt gewehrt, mich vor nichts mehr in der Welt gefürchtet, hatte alles bejaht, hatte an alles mein Herz hingegeben. Es hatte nicht lange gedauert, vielleicht eine Viertelstunde, aber es war im Traum jener Nacht wiedergekehrt und hatte seither, durch alle die öden Tage, hin und wieder heimlich aufgeglänzt, ich sah es zuweilen für Minuten deutlich wie eine goldene göttliche Spur durch mein Leben gehen, fast immer tief im Kot und Staub verschüttet, dann wieder in goldnen Funken vorleuchtend, nie mehr verlierbar scheinend und dennoch bald wieder tief verloren. Einmal geschah es nachts, daß ich im Wachliegen plötzlich Verse sagte, Verse viel zu schön und viel zu wunderlich, als daß ich daran hätte denken dürfen, sie aufzuschreiben, die ich am Morgen nicht mehr wußte und die doch in mir verborgen lagen wie die schwere Nuß in einer alten brüchigen Schale. Ein andermal kam es beim Lesen eines Dichters, beim Nachdenken eines Gedankens von Descartes, von Pascal, ein andres Mal leuchtete es wieder auf und führte mit goldner Spur weiter in die Himmel, wenn ich bei meiner Geliebten war. Ach, es ist schwer, diese Gottesspur zu finden inmitten dieses Lebens, das wir führen, inmitten dieser so sehr zufriedenen, so sehr bürgerlichen, so sehr geistlosen Zeit, im Anblick dieser Architekturen, dieser Geschäfte, dieser Politik, dieser Menschen! Wie sollte ich nicht ein Steppenwolf und ruppiger Eremit sein inmitten einer Welt, von deren Zielen ich keines teile, von deren Freuden keine zu mir spricht! Ich kann weder in einem Theater noch in einem Kino lange aushalten, kann kaum eine Zeitung lesen, selten ein modernes Buch, ich kann nicht verstehen, welche Lust und Freude es ist, die die Menschen in den überfüllten Eisenbahnen und Hotels, in den überfüllten Cafés bei schwüler aufdringlicher Musik, in den Bars und Varietés der eleganten Luxusstädte suchen, in den Weltausstellungen, auf den Korsos, in den Vorträgen für Bildungsdurstige, auf den großen Sportplätzen – ich kann all diese Freuden, die mir ja erreichbar wären und um die tausend andre sich mühen und drängen, nicht verstehen, nicht teilen. Und was hingegen mir in meinen seltnen Freudenstunden geschieht, was für mich Wonne, Erlebnis, Ekstase und Erhebung ist, das kennt und sucht und liebt die Welt höchstens in Dichtungen, im Leben findet sie es verrückt. Und in der Tat, wenn die Welt recht hat, wenn diese Musik in den Cafés, diese Massenvergnügungen, diese amerikanischen, mit so wenigem zufriedenen Menschen recht haben, dann habe ich unrecht, dann bin ich verrückt, dann bin ich wirklich der Steppenwolf, den ich mich oft nannte, das in eine ihm fremde und unverständliche Welt verirrte Tier, das seine Heimat, Luft und Nahrung nicht mehr findet.","With feigned cheerfulness I trotted across the damp, misted asphalt of the streets, weeping and covered with flowers, the lantern lights looked through the cool, damp cloudiness and lazily sucked mirror lights out of the wet ground. My forgotten youth came back to me – how I loved those dark and gloomy evenings in late autumn and winter back then, how greedy and intoxicated I sucked in the moods of loneliness and melancholy when I spent half the night wrapped in my cloak, in the rain and storm ran through the hostile, bare nature, lonely even then, but full of deep enjoyment and full of verses, which I later wrote down by candlelight in my room, sitting on the edge of the bed! Well, that was over, that cup had been emptied and was not refilled for me. Was it a pity? It wasn't a pity. It wasn't a pity what was over. It was a pity about the now and today, about all these countless hours and days that I lost, that I only suffered, that brought neither gifts nor shocks. But praise God, there were also exceptions, there were sometimes, seldom, other hours that brought shocks, brought gifts, tore down walls and brought me, who had lost my way, back to the living heart of the world. Sad and yet deeply excited, I tried to remember the last experience of this kind. It had been at a concert, wonderful old music was being played, when, between two bars of a piano played by woodwind, the door to the afterlife suddenly opened again for me, I had flown through heaven and seen God at work, I had suffered blissful pain and myself no longer defended against anything in the world, no longer afraid of anything in the world, had accepted everything, had given my heart to everything. It hadn't lasted long, maybe a quarter of an hour, but it had returned in the dream of that night and since then, through all the dreary days, it had secretly shone every now and then, sometimes for minutes I saw it clearly running through my life like a golden divine trail , almost always buried deep in dirt and dust, then shining again in golden sparks, never seeming to lose again and yet soon lost deep again. One night it happened that while lying awake I suddenly uttered verses, verses far too beautiful and far too strange for me to think of writing down, which I no longer remembered in the morning and yet which lay hidden within me like the heavy one Nut in an old brittle shell. Another time it came while reading a poet, while contemplating a thought by Descartes, by Pascal, another time it lit up again and led on to heaven with a golden trail when I was with my beloved. Ah, it is difficult to find this trace of God in the midst of this life that we lead, in the midst of this very content, so very bourgeois, so very spiritless time, looking at this architecture, this business, this politics, these people! How should I not be a steppenwolf and a rough hermit in the midst of a world whose goals I share none of whose joys none speaks to me! I can't last long in a theater or in a cinema, I can hardly read a newspaper, seldom a modern book, I can't understand what pleasure and joy it is that people in the overcrowded trains and hotels, in the overcrowded cafes with sultry, obtrusive music, in the bars and variety theaters of the elegant luxury cities, at the world exhibitions, at the parades, in the lectures for those thirsty for education, on the big sports fields - I can do all these joys that are within my reach and about a thousand others striving and pushing, not understanding, not sharing. And what happens to me in my rare hours of joy, what for me is bliss, experience, ecstasy and exaltation, that the world knows and seeks and loves at most in poetry, in life it finds it crazy. And indeed, if the world is right, if this music in the cafes, this mass entertainment, these American people content with so little are right, then I'm wrong, then I'm crazy, then I really am the Steppenwolf, the I often called myself, the animal that got lost in a world that was strange and incomprehensible to it and that can no longer find its home, air and food.","Affecting lightheartedness, I trod the moist pavements of the narrow streets. As though in tears and veiled, the lamps glimmered through the chill gloom and sucked their reflections slowly from the wet ground. The forgotten years of my youth came back to me. How I used to love the dark, sad evenings of late autumn and winter, how eagerly I imbibed their moods of loneliness and melancholy when wrapped in my cloak I strode for half the night through rain and storm, through the leafless winter landscape, lonely enough then too, but full of deep joy, and full of poetry which later I wrote down by candlelight sitting on the edge of my bed! All that was past now. The cup was emptied and would never be filled again. Was that a matter for regret? No, I did not regret the past. My regret was for the present day, for all the countless hours and days that I lost in mere passivity and that brought me nothing, not even the shocks of awakening. But, thank God, there were exceptions. There were now and then, though rarely, the hours that brought the welcome shock, pulled down the walls and brought me back again from my wanderings to the living heart of the world. Sadly and yet deeply moved, I set myself to recall the last of these experiences. It was at a concert of lovely old music. After two or three notes of the piano the door was opened of a sudden to the other world. I sped through heaven and saw God at work. I suffered holy pains. I dropped all my defences and was afraid of nothing in the world. I accepted all things and to all things I gave up my heart. It did not last very long, a quarter of an hour perhaps; but it returned to me in a dream at night, and since, through all the barren days, I caught a glimpse of it now and then. Sometimes for a minute or two I saw it clearly, threading my life like a divine and golden track. But nearly always it was blurred in dirt and dust. Then again it gleamed out in golden sparks as though never to be lost again and yet was soon quite lost once more. Once it happened, as I lay awake at night, that I suddenly spoke in verses, in verses so beautiful and strange that I did not venture to think of writing them down, and then in the morning they vanished; and yet they lay hidden within me like the hard kernel within an old brittle husk. Once it came to me while reading a poet, while pondering a thought of Descartes, of Pascal; again it shone out and drove its gold track far into the sky while I was in the presence of my beloved. Ah, but it is hard to find this track of the divine in the midst of this life we lead, in this besotted humdrum age of spiritual blindness, with its architecture, its business, its politics, its men! How could I fail to be a lone wolf, and an uncouth hermit, as I did not share one of its aims nor understand one of its pleasures? I cannot remain for long in either theater or picture-house. I can scarcely read a paper, seldom a modern book. I cannot understand what pleasures and joys they are that drive people to the overcrowded railways and hotels, into the packed cafés with the suffocating and oppressive music, to the Bars and variety entertainments, to World Exhibitions, to the Corsos. I cannot understand nor share these joys, though they are within my reach, for which thousands of others strive. On the other hand, what happens to me in my rare hours of joy, what for me is bliss and life and ecstasy and exaltation, the world in general seeks at most in imagination; in life it finds it absurd. And in fact, if the world is right, if this music of the cafés, these mass enjoyments and these Americanised men who are pleased with so little are right, then I am wrong, I am crazy. I am in truth the Steppenwolf that I often call myself; that beast astray who finds neither home nor joy nor nourishment in a world that is strange and incomprehensible to him.","By now, putting on a brave face, I was crossing the damp asphalt of the roads at a trot. The street lamps, as if shedding tears of grief, shone through the cool, damp gloom, sucking inert reflections of themselves from the wet ground. The forgotten years of my youth came to mind. How I used to love dark and gloomy evenings like this in late autumn and winter! Then, I would eagerly and enthusiastically soak up their atmosphere of loneliness and melancholy as, wrapped in my overcoat , I spent half the night walking in rain and strong wind through hostile, leafless nature. I already felt lonely even then, but I deeply enjoyed my isolation and my head was full of verses which I wrote up afterwards by candlelight in my room, sitting on the edge of the bed. Well, that was over and done with now; I had drunk that cup dry, and it had not been replenished. Was it a matter for regret? No, it wasn’t. Nothing that was over and done with was a matter for regret. What I did regret was the here and now, all the countless hours and days lost to me because I just endured them and they brought neither rewards nor profound shocks to my system. Yet, praise be to God, there were also exceptions. There were occasional, rare hours that were different, that did bring shocks and rewards, tearing down walls and taking me – lost soul – back again to the living heart of the world. Feeling sad, yet deeply moved, I tried to recall my last such experience. It had been during a concert in which a magnificent piece of early music was being played. Suddenly, between two bars of a passage played piano by the woodwind, the door to eternity had opened up for me again. I had flown through heavens, seen God at work. I had suffered blissful pains, no longer resisting or fearing anything the world had to offer. I had affirmed everything, surrendered my heart to everything. The experience had not lasted long, perhaps a quarter of an hour, but it recurred in the dream I had that night and ever since, through all the dismal days, its secret gleam had now and again resurfaced. Occasionally I saw it clearly for minutes, passing through my life like a golden trace of the divine, but it was almost always deeply buried under layers of filth and dust. Then it would shine forth afresh in a shower of golden sparks, apparently never to be lost again. Yet it was soon lost once more, totally. Once, lying awake at night, I found myself speaking lines of poetry, lines far too beautiful and strange for me to consider writing them down. In the morning I no longer knew them, yet they lay hidden inside me like the heavy nut inside an old, brittle shell. On another occasion it came back when reading a great writer, when thinking through an idea of Descartes or Pascal in my head. And once it shone forth again, its golden trace guiding me onwards up to the heavens, when I was with the woman I loved. Sadly, this trace of the divine is difficult to pick up in the midst of the life we now lead, this so extremely contented, so extremely bourgeois, so extremely shallow life, and faced with the kind of architecture, business, politics, human beings that are all around us. How can I help being a lone wolf and disgruntled hermit, surrounded by a world, none of whose aims I share, none of whose joys appeal to me? I can’t bear to sit in a theatre or cinema for long, I can scarcely read a newspaper, hardly ever a modern book. I can’t understand the pleasures or joys people now seek in crowded trains and hotels, in crowded cafés with their obtrusive hot-house music; in the bars and variety theatres of expensive, fashionable cities; at the world’s fairs, at street carnivals, in the public lectures for those desperate to improve their education, or at large sporting venues. I am unable to understand or share any of these joys which thousands of other people jostle one another to experience, though they would of course be within my reach. On the other hand, what I experience in my own rare hours of joy, what invigorates, delights, uplifts me, and sends me into ecstasies, the world at large knows, looks for and loves if at all only in works of literary fiction. In real life they find it mad. And in fact, if the world at large is right, if the music in the cafés, these mass entertainments, these American-style people who are content with so little are all right, then I am wrong, I am mad. I am indeed the Steppenwolf that I often call myself, a beast that has strayed into an alien and incomprehensible world and is no longer able to find its home, the air it is used to breathing or the food it likes to eat."
"Daß Menschen von solchen Möglichkeiten sich mit Steppenwölfen und »zwei Seelen, ach!« behelfen, ist ebenso verwunderlich und betrübend, wie daß sie so oft jene feige Liebe zum Bürgerlichen haben. Ein Mensch, der fähig ist, Buddha zu begreifen, ein Mensch, der eine Ahnung hat von den Himmeln und Abgründen des Menschentums, sollte nicht in einer Welt leben, in welcher common sense, Demokratie und bürgerliche Bildung herrschen. Nur aus Feigheit lebt er in ihr, und wenn seine Dimensionen ihn bedrängen, wenn die enge Bürgerstube ihm zu eng wird, dann schiebt er es dem »Wolf« in die Schuhe und will nicht wissen, daß der Wolf zuzeiten sein bestes Teil ist. Er nennt alles Wilde in sich Wolf und empfindet es als böse, als gefährlich, als Bürgerschreck – aber er, der doch ein Künstler zu sein und zarte Sinne zu haben glaubt, vermag nicht zu sehen, daß außer dem Wolf, hinter dem Wolf, noch viel andres in ihm lebt, daß nicht alles Wolf ist, was beißt, daß da auch noch Fuchs, Drache, Tiger, Affe und Paradiesvogel wohnen. Und daß diese ganze Welt, dieser ganze Paradiesgarten von holden und schrecklichen, großen und kleinen, starken und zarten Gestaltungen erdrückt und gefangengehalten wird von dem Wolfmärchen, ebenso wie der wahre Mensch in ihm vom Scheinmenschen, vom Bürger, erdrückt und gefangengehalten wird.","It is just as astonishing and depressing that people with such possibilities make do with Steppenwolves and ""Two souls, oh!"" as that they so often have that cowardly love for the bourgeois. A person who is able to comprehend Buddha, a person who has an inkling of the heavens and abysses of humanity, should not live in a world where common sense, democracy and civic education reign. He lives in it only out of cowardice, and when his dimensions oppress him, when the cramped common room becomes too cramped for him, then he blames the ""wolf"" and doesn't want to know that the wolf is sometimes his best part. He calls everything wild in himself a wolf and feels it to be evil, dangerous, a terror for the citizens – but he, who believes he is an artist and has delicate senses, is unable to see that outside the wolf, behind the wolf, still much else lives in it, so that not everything that bites is a wolf, that foxes, dragons, tigers, monkeys and birds of paradise also live there. And that this whole world, this whole paradise garden of lovely and terrible, large and small, strong and delicate forms is crushed and held prisoner by the wolf fairy tale, just as the true human being in it is crushed and held prisoner by the make-believe, the burgher.","It is as much a matter for surprise and sorrow that men of such possibilities should fall back on Steppenwolves and ""Two souls, alas!"" as that they reveal so often that pitiful love for the bourgeoisie. A man who can understand Buddha and has an intuition of the heaven and hell of humanity ought not to live in a world ruled by ""common sense"" and democracy and bourgeois standards. It is only from cowardice that he lives in it; and when its dimensions are too cramping for him and the bourgeois parlor too confining, he lays it at the wolf's door, and refuses to see that the wolf is as often as not the best part of him. All that is wild in himself he calls wolf and considers it wicked and dangerous and the bugbear of all decent life. He cannot see, even though he thinks himself an artist and possessed of delicate perceptions, that a great deal else exists in him besides and behind the wolf. He cannot see that not all that bites is wolf and that fox, dragon, tiger, ape and bird of paradise are there also. And he cannot see that this whole world, this Eden and its manifestations of beauty and terror, of greatness and meanness, of strength and tenderness is crushed and imprisoned by the wolf legend just as the real man in him is crushed and imprisoned by that sham existence, the bourgeois.","The fact that individuals of such potential can fall back on Steppenwolf imagery and clichés like ‘two souls, alas’ is just as surprising and depressing as the cowardly affection they often have for things bourgeois. Any human being capable of understanding Buddha, who has some idea of the heights and depths of human experience, ought not to be living in a world where ‘common sense’, democracy and middle-class culture prevail. It is only cowardice that makes him live there, and whenever he finds his confines oppressive, whenever his poky little middle-class room becomes too cramped for him , it is the ‘wolf’ he blames, refusing to acknowledge that at times the wolf is the best part of him. ‘Wolf’ is the name he gives to all the wild elements in himself. He feels them to be wicked, dangerous, apt to frighten the life out of respectable citizens, yet – despite thinking himself a highly sensitive artist – he cannot see that apart from the wolf, behind the wolf, there are a lot more creatures living inside him. Nor is every creature with sharp teeth a wolf. Harry is home to the fox, the dragon, the tiger, the ape, and the bird of paradise too. He can’t understand that by sticking to his fairy-tale of the wolf he has turned his whole world, this Eden full of creatures lovely and terrifying, great and small, strong and gentle, into an oppressive prison house. In much the same way, the pseudo ‘human being’ of bourgeois convention is suppressing and shackling the true human being within him."
"»O, das hast alles du selber gemacht. Begreifst du das nicht, du gelehrter Herr: daß ich dir darum gefalle und für dich wichtig bin, weil ich wie eine Art Spiegel für dich bin, weil in mir innen etwas ist, was dir Antwort gibt und dich versteht? Eigentlich sollten alle Menschen füreinander solche Spiegel sein und einander so antworten und entsprechen, aber solche Käuze wie du sind eben wunderlich und verlaufen sich leicht in eine Verzauberung, daß sie in den Augen andrer Menschen nichts mehr sehen und lesen können, daß es sie nichts mehr angeht. Und wenn dann so ein Kauz plötzlich doch wieder ein Gesicht findet, das ihn wirklich anschaut, in dem er etwas wie Antwort und Verwandtschaft spürt, ja, dann hat er natürlich eine Freude.« »Du weißt alles, Hermine«, rief ich erstaunt. »Es ist genau so, wie du sagst. Und doch bist du so ganz und gar anders als ich! Du bist ja mein Gegenteil; du hast alles, was mir fehlt.«","'Oh, you did it all yourself. Don't you understand that, you learned gentleman: that I please you and that I am important to you because I am like a kind of mirror for you, because there is something inside me that gives you answers and understands you? Actually, all people should be such mirrors for each other and respond and correspond to each other in this way, but such oafs as you are just strange and easily become enchanted that they can no longer see or read anything in the eyes of other people, that it is no longer possible for them concerns. And when that oddball suddenly finds a face that really looks at him, in which he feels something like an answer and kinship, yes, then of course he's happy."" ""You know everything, Hermione,"" I exclaimed, amazed. “It is exactly as you say. And yet you are so completely different from me! You are my opposite; you have everything I lack.”","""Oh, you did all that yourself. Doesn't your learning reveal to you that the reason why I please you and mean so much to you is because I am a kind of looking glass for you, because there's something in me that answers you and understands you? Really, we ought all to be such looking glasses to each other and answer and correspond to each other, but such owls as you are a bit peculiar. On the slightest provocation they give themselves over to the strangest notions that they can see nothing and read nothing any longer in the eyes of other men and then nothing seems right to them. And then when an owl like that after all finds a face that looks back into his and gives him a glimpse of understanding—well, then he's pleased, naturally."" ""There's nothing you don't know, Hermine,"" I cried in amazement. ""It's exactly as you say. And yet you're so entirely different from me. Why, you're my opposite. You have all that I lack.""","‘Oh, you managed all that on your own. Can’t you get it into your head, my learned friend, that you’ve taken a liking to me and feel that I matter because I’m like a kind of mirror for you, because something in me responds to you and understands you? Actually, all human beings ought to be such mirrors for one another, responding and corresponding to each other in this way, but the thing is that cranks like you are oddities. You easily get led astray, bewitched into thinking that you can no longer see or read anything in the eyes of other people, that there is nothing there that concerns you any more. And when a crank of your sort suddenly discovers a face again that really looks at him, in which he senses something akin to a response and an affinity, it naturally fills him with joy.’ ‘You know all there is to know, Hermione,’ I cried in amazement. ‘It’s exactly as you say. And yet you’re so utterly different from me! You’re my opposite, after all, you have everything that I lack.’"
"Wer die anderen Tage geschmeckt hat, die bösen, die mit den Gichtanfällen oder die mit jenem schlimmen, hinter den Augäpfeln festgewurzelten, teuflisch jede Tätigkeit von Auge und Ohr aus einer Freude zur Qual verhexenden Kopfweh, oder jene Tage des Seelensterbens, jene argen Tage der inneren Leere und Verzweiflung, an denen uns, inmitten der zerstörten und von Aktiengesellschaften ausgesogenen Erde, die Menschenwelt und sogenannte Kultur in ihrem verlogenen und gemeinen blechernen Jahrmarktsglanz auf Schritt und Tritt wie ein Brechmittel entgegengrinst, konzentriert und zum Gipfel der Unleidlichkeit getrieben im eigenen kranken Ich – wer jene Höllentage geschmeckt hat, der ist mit solchen Normal- und Halbundhalbtagen gleich dem heutigen sehr zufrieden, dankbar sitzt er am warmen Ofen, dankbar stellt er beim Lesen des Morgenblattes fest, daß auch heute wieder kein Krieg ausgebrochen, keine neue Diktatur errichtet, keine besonders krasse Schweinerei in Politik und Wirtschaft aufgedeckt worden ist, dankbar stimmt er die Saiten seiner verrosteten Leier zu einem gemäßigten, einem leidlich frohen, einem nahezu vergnügten Dankpsalm, mit dem er seinen stillen, sanften, etwas mit Brom betäubten Zufriedenheitshalbundhalbgott langweilt, und in der laudicken Luft dieser zufriedenen Langeweile, dieser sehr dankenswerten Schmerzlosigkeit sehen die beiden, der öde nickende Halbundhalbgott und der leicht angegraute, den gedämpften Psalm singende Halbundhalbmensch, einander wie Zwillinge ähnlich.","Who has tasted the other days, the bad ones, the ones with the gout attacks or those bad ones, rooted behind the eyeballs, devilishly bewitching every activity of eye and ear from a joy to torment headache, or those days of soul dying, those bad days of inner emptiness and despair, where, in the midst of the destroyed earth sucked dry by stock corporations, the human world and so-called culture in their lying and mean tinny fairground shine grins at us at every turn like an emetic, concentrated and driven to the peak of insufferability in one's own sick ego – anyone who has tasted those hell days is very satisfied with such normal and half and a half days like today, gratefully he sits by the warm stove, gratefully he notices while reading the morning paper that no war has broken out today, no new dictatorship established, no particularly crass mess in politics and economy uncovered thankfully he tunes the strings of his rusty lyre to a moderate, tolerably happy, almost cheerful thanksgiving psalm, with which he bores his quiet, gentle, somewhat brominated half-god of contentment, and in the lukewarm air of this contented boredom, this very thankfully painless, the dull, nodding half-and-half god and the slightly graying half-and-half human singing the muted psalm look like twins.","He who has known the other days, the angry ones of gout attacks, or those with that wicked headache rooted behind the eyeballs that casts a spell on every nerve of eye and ear with a fiendish delight in torture, or soul-destroying, evil days of inward vacancy and despair, when, on this distracted earth, sucked dry by the vampires of finance, the world of men and of so-called culture grins back at us with the lying, vulgar, brazen glamor of a Fair and dogs us with the persistence of an emetic, and when all is concentrated and focused to the last pitch of the intolerable upon your own sick self—he who has known these days of hell may be content indeed with normal half-and-half days like today. Thankfully you sit by the warm stove, thankfully you assure yourself as you read your morning paper that another day has come and no war broken out, no new dictatorship has been set up, no particularly disgusting scandal been unveiled in the worlds of politics or finance. Thankfully you tune the strings of your moldering lyre to a moderated, to a passably joyful, nay, to an even delighted psalm of thanksgiving and with it bore your quiet, flabby and slightly stupefied half-and-half god of contentment; and in the thick warm air of a contented boredom and very welcome painlessness the nodding mandarin of a half-and-half god and the nodding middle-aged gentleman who sings his muffled psalm look as like each other as two peas.","Anyone who has experienced those other days, the nasty ones when you get attacks of gout or the sort of severe headaches, firmly lodged behind your eyeballs, which cast a diabolical spell on every activity of the eyes and ears, transforming all joy into agony; or the soulless days, bitter days when you feel empty inside and at the end of your tether, when, wherever you set foot on this devastated earth, sucked dry by joint-stock companies, the leering face of humanity and so-called culture will confront you in all its fake and vulgar, tinny fairground glitter, acting like an emetic, concentrated within your own sick self to the point where it becomes insufferable. Anyone who has tasted those hellish days will be more than content with normal half-and-half days such as today. All such people will sit thankfully by the warm stove and be grateful, on reading the morning paper, to find that today again no war has broken out, no new dictatorship has been set up, no particularly crass foul play has been discovered in politics or industry. Then, tuning the strings of their rusty lyre, they will intone a moderate, reasonably cheerful, almost happy psalm of thanksgiving to their silent, gentle, half-and-half god of contentment who, somewhat sedated with bromide, will find it boring. And in the thick, lukewarm air of this contented boredom, this highly commendable painlessness, both of them – the bored, dozing half-and-half god and the slightly greying half-and-half human being singing the muted psalm – will look just as alike as twins."

"Aus Andeutungen der Mädchen schloß ich, daß für den Ball morgen, oder im Anschluß an ihn, ganz besondere Genüsse und Ausschweifungen geplant waren. Vielleicht war dies der Schluß, vielleicht hatte Maria recht mit ihrer Ahnung, und wir lagen heut zum letztenmal beisammen, vielleicht begann morgen der neue Schicksalsgang? Ich war voll brennender Sehnsucht, voll erstickender Angst, und ich klammerte mich wild an Maria, lief noch einmal flackernd und gierig durch alle Pfade und Dickichte ihres Gartens, verbiß mich noch einmal in die süße Frucht des Paradiesbaumes.","From hints given by the girls I concluded that very special pleasures and debauchery were planned for the ball tomorrow or after it. Perhaps this was the end, perhaps Maria was right in her hunch, and today we lay together for the last time, perhaps the new course of fate began tomorrow? I was full of burning longing, full of suffocating fear, and I clung wildly to Maria, ran flickering and greedily through all the paths and thickets of her garden once more, biting down on the sweet fruit of the tree of paradise.","From what the girls told me I gathered that for the Ball next day, or in connection with it, quite unusual delights and extravagances were on foot. Perhaps it was the climax, and perhaps Maria's suspicion was correct. Perhaps this was our last night together and perhaps the morning would bring a new unwinding of fate. I was aflame with longing and breathless with dread; I clung wildly to Maria; and there flared within me a last burst of wild desire... • • • • • • •","From things the girls had hinted at, I gathered that quite special delights and sensual excesses were being planned for the next day’s ball, or immediately after it.

Full of ardent yearning, full of suffocating dread, I clung desperately to Maria, fitfully and hungrily exploring once again every path and all the undergrowth in her garden, once again sinking my teeth into the sweet fruit of the tree of paradise."

"Sie sprach so voll schweren Ernstes, so unter hohem Druck der Seele, daß ich nicht ganz mitkam und sie zu beruhigen und abzulenken suchte. Sie schüttelte das nur mit einem Zucken der Augenbrauen von sich, sah mich zwingend an und fuhr fort, mit ganz kalter Stimme: »Du mußt dein Wort halten, Kleiner, das sage ich dir, oder du sollst es bereuen. Du wirst viele Befehle von mir erhalten und wirst ihnen folgen, hübsche Befehle, angenehme Befehle, es wird dir eine Lust sein, ihnen zu gehorchen. Und zuletzt wirst du auch meinen letzten Befehl erfüllen, Harry.«","She spoke with such great seriousness, under such mental pressure, that I couldn't quite follow and tried to calm her down and distract her. She shook that off with a twitch of her eyebrows, gave me a forced look and continued in a very cold voice: “You have to keep your word, kid, I tell you, or you will regret it. You will receive many commands from me and you will follow them, nice commands, pleasant commands, it will be a pleasure for you to obey them. And finally you will fulfill my last command, Harry.”","She spoke so seriously from a deep impulse of her very soul that I scarcely liked to encourage her. I tried to calm her down. She shook her head with a frown and with a compelling look went on: ""I tell you, you must keep your word, my boy. If you don't you'll regret it. You will have many commands from me and you will carry them out. Nice ones and agreeable ones that it will be a pleasure to you to obey. And at the last you will fulfill my last command as well, Harry.""","She uttered these words in such deadly earnest, they poured forth from the depths of her soul with such force that I couldn’t fully grasp their meaning. I tried to calm her down, to take her mind off the subject, but she merely shook off my attempt with a twitch of her eyebrows, gave me a forceful look and continued in a tone of voice devoid of all warmth: ‘You’d better keep your word, my lad, I’m telling you, otherwise you’ll be sorry. You’ll receive lots of orders from me, and you’ll obey them – orders that are so appealing, so agreeable that you’ll be only too delighted to obey them.

"Aber es wird nun Zeit, daß ich meine Gedanken hintanstelle und von Wirklichkeiten spreche. Das erste also, was ich über Herrn Haller in Erfahrung brachte, teils durch meine Spionage, teils durch Bemerkungen meiner Tante, bezog sich auf die Art seiner Lebensführung. Daß er ein Gedanken- und Büchermensch war und keinen praktischen Beruf ausübte, war bald zu sehen. Er lag immer sehr lange im Bett, oft stand er erst kurz vor Mittag auf und ging im Schlafrock die paar Schritte von der Schlafkammer zu seinem Wohnzimmer hinüber. Dies Wohnzimmer, eine große und freundliche Mansarde mit zwei Fenstern, sah schon nach wenigen Tagen anders aus als zur Zeit, da es von andern Mietern bewohnt gewesen war. Es füllte sich, und mit der Zeit wurde es immer voller. An den Wänden wurden Bilder aufgehängt, Zeichnungen angeheftet, zuweilen aus Zeitschriften ausgeschnittene Bilder, die häufig wechselten. Eine südliche Landschaft, Photographien aus einem deutschen Landstädtchen, offenbar der Heimat Hallers, hingen da, farbige, leuchtende Aquarelle dazwischen, von denen wir erst spät erfuhren, daß er selbst sie gemalt hatte. Dann die Photographie einer hübschen jungen Frau oder eines jungen Mädchens. Eine Zeitlang hing ein siamesischer Buddha an der Wand, er wurde abgelöst durch eine Reproduktion der »Nacht« von Michelangelo, dann von einem Bildnis des Mahatma Gandhi. Bücher füllten nicht nur den großen Bücherschrank, sondern lagen auch überall auf den Tischen, auf dem hübschen alten Sekretär, auf dem Diwan, auf den Stühlen, auf dem Boden herum, Bücher mit eingelegten Papierzeichen, die beständig wechselten. Die Bücher nahmen beständig zu, denn er brachte nicht nur ganze Packen von den Bibliotheken mit, sondern bekam auch sehr häufig Pakete mit der Post. Der Mann, der diese Stube bewohnte, konnte ein Gelehrter sein. Dazu paßte auch der Zigarrenrauch, der alles einhüllte, und die überall herumliegenden Zigarrenreste und Aschenschalen. Ein großer Teil der Bücher jedoch war nicht gelehrten Inhalts, die große Mehrzahl waren Werke der Dichter aus allen Zeiten und Völkern. Eine Zeitlang lagen auf dem Diwan, wo er oft ganze Tage liegend zubrachte, alle sechs dicken Bände eines Werkes herum mit dem Titel »Sophiens Reise von Memel nach Sachsen«, vom Ende des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts. Eine Gesamtausgabe von Goethe und eine von Jean Paul schienen viel benützt zu werden, ebenso Novalis, aber auch Lessing, Jacobi und Lichtenberg. Einige Dostojewskibände staken voll von beschriebenen Zetteln. Auf dem größern Tisch zwischen den vielen Büchern und Schriften stand häufig ein Blumenstrauß, dort trieb sich auch ein Aquarellierkasten herum, der aber stets voller Staub war, daneben die Aschenschalen und, um auch dies nicht zu verschweigen, allerlei Flaschen mit Getränken. Eine strohumflochtene Flasche war meist mit italienischem Rotwein gefüllt, den er in der Nähe in einem kleinen Laden holte, manchmal war auch eine Flasche Burgunder zu sehen sowie Malaga, und eine dicke Flasche mit Kirschgeist sah ich innerhalb recht kurzer Zeit nahezu leer werden, dann aber in eine Stubenecke verschwinden und, ohne daß der Rest sich weiter verminderte, verstauben. Ich will mich über die von mir getriebene Spionage nicht rechtfertigen und gestehe auch offen, daß in der ersten Zeit alle diese Anzeichen eines zwar von geistigen Interessen erfüllten, aber doch recht verbummelten und zuchtlosen Lebens bei mir Abscheu und Mißtrauen hervorriefen. Ich bin nicht nur ein bürgerlicher, regelmäßig lebender Mensch, an Arbeit und genaue Zeiteinteilung gewohnt, ich bin auch Abstinent und Nichtraucher, und jene Flaschen in Hallers Zimmer gefielen mir noch weniger als die übrige malerische Unordnung.","But it is now time that I put my thoughts aside and speak of realities. So the first thing I found out about Herr Haller, partly through my espionage and partly through remarks by my aunt, related to the way he lived. It was soon apparent that he was a man of thought and books and had no practical occupation. He always lay in bed for a very long time, often getting up just before noon and walking the few steps from the bedroom to his living room in his dressing gown. This living room, a large and friendly mansard with two windows, looked different after just a few days than when it had been occupied by other tenants. It filled up, and as time went on it got fuller and fuller. Pictures were hung on the walls, drawings pinned, sometimes pictures cut out of magazines, which changed frequently. A southern landscape, photographs from a small German country town, apparently Haller's homeland, hung there, interspersed with colored, luminous watercolors that we only found out late that he had painted them himself. Then the photograph of a pretty young woman or girl. For a time a Siamese Buddha hung on the wall, this was replaced by a reproduction of Michelangelo's 'Night', then by an effigy of Mahatma Gandhi. Books not only filled the large bookcase, but also lay everywhere on the tables, on the pretty old secretary, on the divan, on the chairs, on the floor, books with paper symbols inserted, which were constantly changing. The books kept increasing, for not only did he bring whole bundles from the libraries, but he also very often received packages in the mail. The man who lived in this room could be a scholar. The cigar smoke, which enveloped everything, and the cigar remains and ashtrays lying everywhere fit in with this. A large proportion of the books, however, were not of scholarly content, the great majority being the works of poets from all ages and peoples. For a while all six thick volumes of a work from the end of the eighteenth century entitled Sophie's Journey from Memel to Saxony lay around on the divan, where he often spent whole days lying there. A complete edition by Goethe and one by Jean Paul seemed to be used a great deal, as did Novalis, but also Lessing, Jacobi and Lichtenberg. A few volumes of Dostoyevsky were full of slips of paper written on them. On the larger table between the many books and writings there was often a bouquet of flowers, there was also a watercolor box hanging around there, but it was always full of dust, next to it the ashtrays and, not to mention this, all kinds of bottles with drinks. A straw-braided bottle was usually filled with Italian red wine, which he fetched from a small shop nearby, sometimes a bottle of Burgundy could also be seen, as well as Malaga, and I saw a thick bottle of cherry brandy become almost empty within a very short time, but then disappear into a corner of the room and, without the rest diminishing any further, gather dust. I don't want to justify my espionage, and I also openly admit that at first all these signs of a life filled with intellectual interests, but still quite lazy and lacking in discipline, aroused disgust and distrust in me. Not only am I a middle-class, regularly living person, used to work and a precise schedule, I'm also a teetotaler and non-smoker, and I liked those bottles in Haller's room even less than the rest of the pictorial disorder.","It is now time, however, to put my own thoughts aside and to get to facts. What I first discovered about Haller, partly through my espionage, partly from my aunt's remarks, concerned his way of living. It was soon obvious that his days were spent with his thoughts and his books, and that he pursued no practical calling. He lay always very late in bed. Often he was not up much before noon and went across from his bedroom, to his sitting room in his dressing gown. This sitting room, a large and comfortable attic room with two windows, after a few days was not at all the same as when occupied by other tenants. It filled up more and more as time went on. Pictures were hung on the walls, drawings tacked up—sometimes illustrations cut out from magazines and often changed. A southern landscape, photographs of a little German country town, apparently Haller's home, hung there, and between them were some brightly painted water colors, which, as we discovered later, he had painted himself. Then there were photographs of a pretty young woman, or—rather—girl. For a long while a Siamese Buddha hung on the wall, to be replaced first by Michelangelo's ""Night,"" then by a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Books filled the large bookcase and lay everywhere else as well, on the table, on the pretty old bureau, on the sofa, on the chairs and all about on the floor, books with notes slipped into them which were continually changing. The books constantly increased, for besides bringing whole armfuls back with him from the libraries he was always getting parcels of them by post. The occupant of this room might well be a learned man; and to this the all-pervading smell of cigar smoke might testify as well as the stumps and ash of cigars all about the room. Many of the books, however, were not of a scholarly nature. The majority were works of the poets of all times and peoples. For a long while there lay about on the sofa where he often spent whole days all six volumes of a work with the title Sophia's Journey from Memet to Saxony—a work of the latter part of the eighteenth century. A complete edition of Goethe and one of Jean Paul showed signs of wear, also Novalis, while Lessing, Jacobi and Lichtenberg were in the same condition. A few volumes of Dostoievski bristled with penciled slips. On the big table among the books and papers there was often a vase of flowers. There, too, a paint box, generally full of dust, reposed among flakes of cigar ash and (to leave nothing out) sundry bottles of wine. There was a straw-covered bottle usually containing Italian red wine, which he procured from a little shop in the neighborhood; often, too, a bottle of Burgundy as well as Malaga; and a squat bottle of Cherry brandy was, as I saw, nearly emptied in a very brief space—after which it disappeared in a corner of the room, there to collect the dust without further diminution of its contents. I will not pretend to justify this espionage I carried on, and I will say openly that all these signs of a life full of intellectual curiosity, but thoroughly slovenly and disorderly all the same, inspired me at first with aversion and mistrust. I am not only a middle-class man, living a regular life, fond of work and punctuality; I am also an abstainer and nonsmoker, and these bottles in Haller's room pleased me even less than the rest of his artistic disorder.","But the time has now come to put my own thoughts to one side and speak of actual facts. Well, the first thing I learned about Herr Haller, partly through my snooping, partly from observations made by my aunt, had to do with the way he led his life. It soon became apparent that he was not pursuing any practical profession but was a man of ideas and books. He always stayed in bed very late, often only getting up shortly before midday, when he would walk in his dressing gown the few steps from the bedroom across to his living room. A big, homely attic space with two windows, within a few days this living room already looked different from how it had when occupied by other tenants. It was filling up, and as time went by it got more and more packed with things. Pictures were hung, drawings stuck on the walls, sometimes illustrations cut from magazines, which were frequently replaced by others. There was a southern landscape hanging there, photographs of a small German country town, evidently Haller’s home, and between them bright watercolours which, as we only discovered later, he had painted himself. Then came the photograph of a pretty young woman, or young girl. For a while there was a Siamese Buddha hanging on the wall, but a reproduction of Michelangelo’s Night took its place, and it in turn gave way to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. There were books everywhere, not just filling the large bookcase, but lying around on the tables, on the fine old writing desk, on the divan, on the chairs, and on the floor. Slips of paper that constantly changed were inserted in them, marking the pages. And the number of books constantly grew because he brought whole bundles back from the libraries as well as very often receiving parcels of them in the post. The man occupying this room was quite possibly a learned scholar. The cigar smoke that enveloped everything fitted this picture, as did the ashtrays and cigar stubs that lay around everywhere. Yet a large proportion of the books was not academic in content, but literary. Works by great writers of all periods and nationalities made up the vast majority. On the divan, where he frequently spent whole days reclining, all six fat volumes of a late eighteenth-century work entitled Sophia’s Journey from Memel to Saxony could be seen lying around for a time.1 A complete edition of Goethe and one of Jean Paul2 seemed to be much in use, as did the works of Novalis,3 but there were also editions of Lessing, Jacobi and Lichtenberg.4 Some volumes of Dostoevsky were full of slips of paper with notes on them. Among the many books and papers on the fairly large table there was often a bunch of flowers. A set of watercolour paints lay around on it too, but it was always full of dust. Next to it were the ashtrays and – I see no reason why I should hide the fact – an array of bottles containing drink. One bottle woven in straw was usually filled with an Italian red wine he fetched from a small shop near by. Occasionally you would spot a bottle of burgundy or Malaga, and once I saw a squat bottle of kirsch being virtually emptied in next to no time, only to disappear in some corner of the room where it gathered dust without its remaining contents being reduced. Without wishing to justify my snooping, I openly confess that in the early days all these signs of a life being wantonly frittered away, however much it was occupied with intellectual pursuits, aroused loathing and suspicion in me. It’s not just that I lead the orderly life of a solid citizen, keeping precisely to a timetable. I’m also teetotal and a non-smoker, and the sight of those bottles in Haller’s room was even less to my liking than the rest of his bohemian clutter."

"In der Tat spuckte, zu meinem unbeschreiblichen Erstaunen und Entsetzen, der teuflische Blechtrichter nun alsbald jene Mischung von Bronchialschleim und zerkautem Gummi aus, welchen die Besitzer von Grammophonen und Abonnenten des Radios übereingekommen sind, Musik zu nennen – und hinter dem trüben Geschleime und Gekrächze war wahrhaftig, wie hinter dicker Schmutzkruste ein altes köstliches Bild, die edle Struktur dieser göttlichen Musik zu erkennen, der königliche Aufbau, der kühle weite Atem, der satte breite Streicherklang. »Mein Gott«, rief ich entsetzt, »was tun Sie, Mozart? Ist es Ihr Ernst, daß Sie sich und mir diese Schweinerei antun? Daß Sie diesen scheußlichen Apparat auf uns loslassen, den Triumph unsrer Zeit, ihre letzte siegreiche Waffe im Vernichtungskampf gegen die Kunst? Muß das sein, Mozart?«","Indeed, to my indescribable amazement and horror, the diabolical tin funnel soon spat out that mixture of bronchial mucus and chewed gum which gramophone owners and radio subscribers have agreed to call music—and behind which was murky mucus and croaking truly, like recognizing an old, delicious picture behind a thick crust of dirt, the noble structure of this divine music, the royal structure, the cool, wide breath, the full, broad sound of the strings. ""My God,"" I cried in horror, ""what are you doing, Mozart? Are you serious about doing this mess to yourself and me? That you unleash this dreadful contraption on us, the triumph of our time, your last victorious weapon in the battle of annihilation against art? Is that necessary, Mozart?”","And in fact, to my indescribable astonishment and horror, the devilish tin trumpet spat out, without more ado, a mixture of bronchial slime and chewed rubber; that noise that owners of gramophones and radios have agreed to call music. And behind the slime and the croaking there was, sure enough, like an old master beneath a layer of dirt, the noble outline of that divine music. I could distinguish the majestic structure and the deep wide breath and the full broad bowing of the strings. ""My God,"" I cried in horror, ""what are you doing, Mozart? Do you really mean to inflict this mess on me and yourself, this triumph of our day, the last victorious weapon in the war of extermination against art? Must this be, Mozart?""","And in fact, to my indescribable astonishment and horror, what the satanic metal horn of a loudspeaker now immediately spewed out was just that mixture of bronchial slime and chewed-up rubber which owners of gramophones and wireless subscribers have agreed to call music. Yet, just as a thick crust of dirt can conceal an exquisite old-master painting, behind all the murky slime and crackling noise you could indeed recognize the noble structure of this divine music, its princely composition, the cool, ample air it breathed, the full, rich sonority produced by the strings. ‘My God,’ I cried in disgust. ‘What do you think you are doing, Mozart? Do you seriously want to subject yourself and me to such filth, to let this abominable gadget loose on the two of us, this triumphal invention of our times, the latest successful weapon in their campaign to destroy art? Is this really necessary?’"

"Vieles erlebte ich in Pablos kleinem Theater, und kein Tausendstel davon ist mit Worten zu sagen. Alle Mädchen, die ich je geliebt, waren nun mein, jede gab mir, was nur sie allein zu geben hatte, jeder gab ich, was nur sie von mir zu nehmen wußte. Viel Liebe, viel Glück, viel Wollust, viel Verwirrung auch und Leid bekam ich zu kosten, alle versäumte Liebe meines Lebens blühte in dieser Traumstunde zauberhaft in meinem Garten, keusche zarte Blumen, grelle lodernde Blumen, dunkle schnellwelkende Blumen, flackernde Wollust, innige Träumerei, glühende Schwermut, angstvolles Sterben, strahlende Neugeburt. Ich fand Frauen, die nur eilig und im Sturm zu gewinnen waren, und andre, um welche lang und sorgfältig zu werben ein Glück war; jeder dämmernde Winkel meines Lebens tauchte wieder auf, in welchem einst, sei es nur eine Minute lang, die Stimme des Geschlechts mir gerufen, ein Frauenblick mich entzündet, ein Schimmer weißer Mädchenhaut mich gelockt hatte, und alles Versäumte ward eingeholt. Jede wurde mein, jede auf ihre Art. Die Frau mit den merkwürdigen tiefbraunen Augen unter flachshellem Haar war da, neben der ich einst eine Viertelstunde am Fenster im Gang eines Schnellzugs gestanden, und die später mehrmals in meinen Träumen erschienen war, – sie sprach kein Wort, aber sie lehrte mich ungeahnte, erschreckende, tödliche Liebeskünste. Und die glatte, stille, glasig lächelnde Chinesin vom Hafen in Marseille, mit dem glatten tiefschwarzen Haar und den schwimmenden Augen, auch sie wußte Unerhörtes. Jede hatte ihr Geheimnis, duftete nach ihrem Erdreich, küßte, lachte auf ihre Weise, war auf ihre besondere Art schamhaft, auf ihre besondere Art schamlos. Sie kamen und gingen, der Strom führte sie mir zu, spülte mich zu ihnen hin, von ihnen weg, es war ein spielendes, kindliches Schwimmen im Strom des Geschlechts, voll Reiz, voll Gefahr, voll Überraschung. Und ich staunte darüber, wie reich mein Leben, mein scheinbar so armes und liebloses Steppenwolfleben, an Verliebtheiten, an Gelegenheiten, an Lockungen gewesen war. Ich hatte sie fast alle versäumt und geflohen, war über sie hinweggestolpert, hatte sie schleunigst vergessen – aber hier waren sie alle aufbewahrt, lückenlos, Hunderte. Und jetzt sah ich sie, gab mich ihnen hin, stand ihnen offen, sank in ihre rosig dämmernde Unterwelt hinab. Auch jene Verführung kehrte wieder, die mir Pablo einst angeboten hatte, und andre, frühere, die ich zu ihrer Zeit nicht einmal ganz begriffen hatte, phantastische Spiele zu dreien und vieren, lächelnd nahmen sie mich in ihren Reigen mit. Viele Dinge geschahen, viele Spiele wurden gespielt, nicht mit Worten zu sagen.","I experienced a lot in Pablo's little theater, and not a thousandth of it can be expressed in words. All the girls I had ever loved were mine now, each one gave me what only she alone could give, each one I gave what only she knew how to take from me. I got to taste a lot of love, a lot of happiness, a lot of lust, a lot of confusion and sorrow too, all the missed love of my life blossomed magically in this dream hour in my garden, chaste, delicate flowers, bright blazing flowers, dark fast-fading flowers, flickering lust, deep dreams , glowing melancholy, anguished death, radiant rebirth. I found women who could only be won in haste and by storm, and others whom it was fortunate to woo long and carefully; every twilight corner of my life reappeared, in which once, if only for a minute, the voice of sex had called to me, a woman's look had kindled me, a gleam of white girlish skin had enticed me, and everything I had missed was caught up. Each one became mine, each in its own way. The woman with the strange deep brown eyes under flat, light hair was there, with whom I once stood for fifteen minutes at the window in the aisle of an express train, and who later appeared several times in my dreams - she didn't speak Word, but she taught me unsuspected, terrifying, deadly love arts. And the smooth, quiet, glassy-smiling Chinese woman from the port of Marseille, with the straight, jet-black hair and the swimming eyes, she too knew something outrageous. Each had her secret, smelled of her soil, kissed, laughed in her own way, was bashful in her own way, shameless in her own way. They came and went, the current brought them to me, swept me towards them, away from them, it was a playful, childlike swimming in the stream of sex, full of charm, full of danger, full of surprise. And I was amazed at how rich my life, my apparently so poor and loveless Steppenwolf life, had been in love, in opportunities, in temptations. I'd missed almost all of them and fled, stumbled over them, forgotten them in a hurry—but they were all kept here, without gaps, hundreds. And now I saw them, gave myself to them, stood open to them, sank down into their rosy twilight underworld. That seduction returned, too, which Pablo had once offered me, and other, earlier ones, which I hadn't even fully understood at the time, fantastic games of threes and fours, smiling and taking me with them in their dance. Many things happened, many games were played, beyond words.","I lived through much in Pablo's little theater and not a thousandth part can be told in words. All the girls I had ever loved were mine. Each gave me what she alone had to give and to each I gave what she alone knew how to take. Much love, much happiness, much indulgence, and much bewilderment, too, and suffering fell to my share. All the love that I had missed in my life bloomed magically in my garden during this hour of dreams. There were chaste and tender blooms, garish ones that blazed, dark ones swiftly fading. There were flaring lust, inward reverie, glowing melancholy, anguished dying, radiant birth. I found women who were only to be taken by storm and those whom it was a joy to woo and win by degrees. Every twilit corner of my life where, if but for a moment, the voice of sex had called me, a woman's glance kindled me or the gleam of a girl's white skin allured me, emerged again and all that had been missed was made good. All were mine, each in her own way. The woman with the remarkable dark brown eyes beneath flaxen hair was there. I had stood beside her for a quarter of an hour in the corridor of an express and afterwards she often appeared in my dreams. She did not speak a word, but what she taught me of the art of love was unimaginable, frightful, deathly. And the sleek, still Chinese, from the harbor of Marseilles, with her glassy smile, her smooth dead-black hair and swimming eyes—she too knew undreamed-of things. Each had her secret and the bouquet of her soil. Each kissed and laughed in a fashion of her own, and in her own peculiar way was shameful and in her own peculiar way shameless. They came and went. The stream carried them towards me and washed me up to them and away. I was a child in the stream of sex, at play in the midst of all its charm, its danger and surprise. And it astonished me to find how rich my life—the seemingly so poor and loveless life of the Steppenwolf—had been in the opportunities and allurements of love. I had missed them. I had fled before them. I had stumbled on over them. I had made haste to forget them. But here they all were stored up in their hundreds, and not one missing. And now that I saw them I gave myself up to them without defence and sank down into the rosy twilight of their underworld. Even that seduction to which Pablo had once invited me came again, and other, earlier ones which I had not fully grasped at the time, fantastic games for three or four, caught me up in their dance with a smile. Many things happened and many games, best unmentioned, were played.","I experienced a great deal in Pablo’s little theatre, a thousand things more than can be put into words. All the girls I had ever loved were now mine. Each gave me what was hers alone to give and I gave to each of them what only she knew how to take from me. I got to sample much love, much happiness, much lust, and a great deal of confusion and sorrow too. In the space of this one dreamlike hour, all the love I had missed out on during my life returned magically to fill my garden with a variety of blooms: flowers that were chaste and delicate, garish flowers blazing with colour, dark flowers that swiftly faded. I ran the gamut of flickering desire, intense reverie, feverish melancholy, the anguish of death and the joyful radiance of rebirth. I found women who could only be won in haste, taken by storm; others it was a joy to woo at length and with utmost solicitude. Light was cast on every dim corner of my life in which I had once, if only for a minute, heard the voice of sex calling me, a look from a woman had aroused me, or I had been attracted by the glimpse of a girl’s shimmering white skin. And now every previously missed opportunity was made up for, every woman becoming mine, each in her own way. There was the woman with the remarkably deep brown eyes under her flaxen hair that I had once stood next to for a quarter of an hour by the window in the corridor of an express train and who had later appeared to me several times in dreams. She didn’t utter a word, but she taught me some things about lovemaking I never imagined existed, frightening, deadly arts. And then there was that sleek, calm Chinese woman from the dockside in Marseille with her glassy smile, smooth jet-black hair and swimming eyes. She too knew some outrageous things. Each of them had her secrets, each the perfume of her homeland. All of them kissed and laughed differently; all were bashful – and shameless too – in their own distinctive ways. The women came and went with the current. Either it bore them to me or I was washed towards them, then away again. To float like this on a wave of sexuality was like a childhood game, full of charm, full of danger, full of surprise. And I was amazed to discover how rich my ostensibly barren and loveless Steppenwolf existence had been in episodes of infatuation, sexual opportunities and temptations. I had let almost all of them slip by or had run away from them. Stumbling upon them, I had forgotten them as fast as I could, but here they were all stored up in their hundreds, every single one of them. Now I could see them, surrender to them, open myself to them and descend into the rosy half-light of their underworld. Even the orgy Pablo had once tempted me to indulge in recurred, along with other, earlier proposals I hadn’t even understood at the time, to join in fantastic threesomes and foursomes. Now I was welcomed into such revels with a smile. Lots of things took place, lots of games were played, all of them unmentionable."
"Und dies alles ist dem Steppenwolf, auch wenn er niemals diesen Abriß seiner innern Biographie zu Gesicht bekommt, sehr wohl bekannt. Er ahnt seine Stellung im Weltgebäude, er ahnt und kennt die Unsterblichen, er ahnt und fürchtet die Möglichkeit einer Selbstbegegnung, er weiß vom Vorhandensein jenes Spiegels, in den zu blicken er so bitter nötig hätte, in den zu blicken er sich so tödlich fürchtet.","And all this is very well known to the Steppenwolf, even if he never gets to see this outline of his inner biography. He senses his position in the world structure, he senses and knows the immortals, he senses and fears the possibility of a self-encounter, he knows of the existence of that mirror into which he sorely needs to look, into which he is so mortally afraid to look.","And all this is very well known to the Steppenwolf, even though his eye may never fall on this fragment of his inner biography. He has a suspicion of his allotted place in the world, a suspicion of the Immortals, a suspicion that he may meet himself face to face; and he is aware of the existence of that mirror in which he has such bitter need to look and from which he shrinks in such deathly fear. • • • • • • •","And even if he never gets to read this sketch of his inner biography Steppenwolf is well aware of all these things. He senses what his place is in the structure of the universe; deep down he is no stranger to the Immortals; he is dimly aware of – and fears – the possibility of a confrontation with his own self. And though he knows the mirror he so desperately needs to look into exists, the thought of looking into it fills him with mortal dread."

Endlos lief die Reihe der Inschriften. Eine hieß:,The series of inscriptions ran endlessly. One was called:,The series of inscriptions was endless. One was,The series of inscriptions was endless. One of them read:
"Erst als wir alle drei die Treppe zum Dachboden hinaufstiegen, konnte ich den Mann genauer ansehen. Er war nicht sehr groß, hatte aber den Gang und die Kopfhaltung von großgewachsenen Menschen, er trug einen modernen bequemen Wintermantel und war im übrigen anständig, aber unsorgfältig gekleidet, glatt rasiert und mit ganz kurzem Kopfhaar, das hier und dort ein wenig grau flimmerte. Sein Gang gefiel mir anfangs gar nicht, er hatte etwas Mühsames und Unentschlossenes, das nicht zu dem scharfen, heftigen Profil und auch nicht zum Ton und Temperament seiner Rede paßte. Erst später merkte und erfuhr ich, daß er krank war und daß das Gehen ihm Mühe machte. Mit einem eigentümlichen Lächeln, das mir damals ebenfalls unangenehm war, betrachtete er die Treppe, die Wände und Fenster und die alten hohen Schränke im Treppenhaus, dies alles schien ihm zu gefallen und schien ihm doch zugleich irgendwie lächerlich. Überhaupt machte der ganze Mann den Eindruck, als komme er aus einer fremden Welt, etwa aus überseeischen Ländern, zu uns und finde hier alles zwar hübsch, aber ein wenig komisch. Er war, wie ich nicht anders sagen kann, höflich, ja freundlich, er war auch mit dem Haus, dem Zimmer, dem Preis für Miete und Frühstück und allem sofort und ohne Einwände einverstanden, und dennoch war um den ganzen Mann herum eine fremde und, wie mir scheinen wollte, ungute oder feindliche Atmosphäre. Er mietete das Zimmer, mietete noch die Schlafkammer zu, ließ sich über Heizung, Wasser, Bedienung und Hausordnung unterrichten, hörte alles aufmerksam und freundlich an, war mit allem einverstanden, bot auch sogleich eine Vorauszahlung auf die Miete an, und doch schien er bei alledem nicht recht dabei zu sein, schien sich selber in seinem Tun komisch zu finden und nicht ernst zu nehmen, so, als sei es ihm seltsam und neu, ein Zimmer zu mieten und mit Leuten Deutsch zu sprechen, während er eigentlich und im Innern mit ganz anderen Sachen beschäftigt wäre. So etwa war mein Eindruck, und er wäre kein guter gewesen, wenn er nicht durch allerlei kleine Züge durchkreuzt und korrigiert worden wäre. Vor allem war es das Gesicht des Mannes, das mir von Anfang an gefiel; trotz jenes Ausdruckes von Fremdheit gefiel es mir, es war ein vielleicht etwas eigenartiges und auch trauriges Gesicht, aber ein waches, sehr gedankenvolles, durchgearbeitetes und vergeistigtes. Und dann kam, um mich versöhnlicher zu stimmen, dazu, daß seine Art von Höflichkeit und Freundlichkeit, obwohl sie ihm etwas Mühe zu machen schien, doch ganz ohne Hochmut war – im Gegenteil, es war darin etwas beinah Rührendes, etwas wie Flehendes, wofür ich erst später die Erklärung fand, das mich aber sofort ein wenig für ihn einnahm.","It wasn't until the three of us climbed the stairs to the attic that I got a closer look at the man. He wasn't very tall, but he walked and held his head like tall people, he wore a modern, comfortable winter coat and was otherwise decent but carelessly dressed, clean-shaven and with very short hair that shimmered a little gray here and there. At first I didn't like the way he walked, there was something laborious and indecisive about him that didn't go with the sharp, violent profile, nor with the tone and temperament of his speech. It was only later that I noticed and learned that he was ill and that it was difficult for him to walk. With a peculiar smile, which I also found uncomfortable at the time, he looked at the stairs, the walls and windows and the tall, old cupboards in the stairwell; he seemed to like all of this, but at the same time it seemed somehow ridiculous to him. In general, the whole man gave the impression that he came to us from a foreign world, perhaps from overseas countries, and that although he found everything here pretty, it was a little funny. He was, as I can't put it any other way, polite, even friendly, he agreed immediately and without objection to the house, the room, the price for rent and breakfast and everything else, and yet all around the man there was a strange and , as it seemed to me, uneasy or hostile atmosphere. He rented the room, rented the bedroom as well, had himself informed about the heating, water, service and house rules, listened to everything attentively and in a friendly manner, agreed with everything, immediately offered to pay the rent in advance, and yet he seemed to agree Not really being involved with all of this, seemed to find himself funny in what he was doing and not to take it seriously, as if it were strange and new to him to rent a room and speak German to people when he was actually and internally with would be busy with other things. That was my impression, and it wouldn't have been a good one if it hadn't been thwarted and corrected by all sorts of small moves. Above all, it was the man's face that I liked from the start; I liked it in spite of that expression of strangeness, it was perhaps a somewhat strange and also sad face, but an alert, very thoughtful, worked through and spiritualized one. And then, to make me more forgiving, his kind of politeness and friendliness, although it seemed to bother him a little, was entirely without arrogance - on the contrary, there was something almost touching about it, something like begging, for what I didn't find the explanation until later, but that immediately won me a little over for him.","I did not get a good look at him until we were all three on our way up to the top floor. Though not very big, he had the bearing of a big man. He wore a fashionable and comfortable winter overcoat and he was well, though carelessly, dressed, clean-shaven, and his cropped head showed here and there a streak of grey. He carried himself in a way I did not at all like at first. There was something weary and undecided about it that did not go with his keen and striking profile nor with the tone of his voice. Later, I found out that his health was poor and that walking tired him. With a peculiar smile—at that time equally unpleasant to me—he contemplated the stairs, the walls, and windows, and the tall old cupboards on the staircase. All this seemed to please and at the same time to amuse him. Altogether he gave the impression of having come out of an alien world, from another continent perhaps. He found it all very charming and a little odd. I cannot deny that he was polite, even friendly. He agreed at once and without objection to the terms for lodging and breakfast and so forth, and yet about the whole man there was a foreign and, as I chose to think, disagreeable or hostile atmosphere. He took the room and the bedroom too, listened attentively and amiably to all he was told about the heating, the water, the service and the rules of the household, agreed to everything, offered at once to pay a sum in advance—and yet he seemed at the same time to be outside it all, to find it comic to be doing as he did and not to take it seriously. It was as though it were a very odd and new experience for him, occupied as he was with quite other concerns, to be renting a room and talking to people in German. Such more or less was my impression, and it would certainly not have been a good one if it had not been revised and corrected by many small instances. Above all, his face pleased me from the first, in spite of the foreign air it had. It was a rather original face and perhaps a sad one, but alert, thoughtful, strongly marked and highly intellectual. And then, to reconcile me further, there was his polite and friendly manner, which though it seemed to cost him some pains, was all the same quite without pretension; on the contrary, there was something almost touching, imploring in it. The explanation of it I found later, but it disposed me at once in his favor.","Only when all three of us were climbing the stairs to the attic was I able to get a closer look at the man. Though not very big, he walked and held his head as men of some stature do. He was wearing a comfortable modern winter coat and was otherwise respectably if untidily dressed. He was clean-shaven and had extremely short hair with a slight glint of grey in it here and there. Initially I didn’t like his walk one bit. There was something laborious and hesitant about it that clashed with the sharpness and severity of his profile as well as with the tone and vivacity of his speech. Only later did it come to my attention that he was ill, and that he had difficulty walking. He cast his eyes over the stairs, the walls, the windows and the old tall cupboards in the staircase with a peculiar smile on his face that I found equally unpleasant at the time. He appeared to like everything, yet at the same time find it somehow laughable. In general everything about the man suggested that he was a visitor from an alien world, from some lands overseas, say; and though he found everything here attractive, it all struck him as a bit comical too. He was, I have to say, polite, indeed friendly. He was also immediately happy with everything, hadn’t a single objection to the building, the room, the rent, the price of breakfast or anything. And yet the whole man had an air about him that was alien and, so it seemed to me, hostile or ill disposed. He rented the room, taking the little bedroom in addition. He asked about heating, water, cleaning and the house regulations; he listened to everything in a friendly and attentive manner; he agreed to everything, immediately offering to pay an advance on the rent too. And yet he appeared to be remote from these proceedings; he himself seemed to find what he was doing comical and not to take it seriously. It was as if renting a room and speaking German to people were strange and novel activities for him, while in actual fact, deep inside, he was occupied with totally different matters. This, roughly, was my impression, and it would have been an unfavourable one, if a whole variety of little things hadn’t contrived to make me modify it. It was above all the man’s face that I found likeable from the start. I liked it in spite of its alien expression. It may have been a rather peculiar face, and a sad one too, but it was alert, very thoughtful and marked by experience, both intellectual and spiritual. And what, in addition, reconciled me to him even more was the fact that his politeness and friendliness, though they seemed not to come easily to him, were devoid of arrogance. On the contrary: there was an almost touching, imploring quality about them, for which I discovered the explanation only later, but which immediately went some way towards winning me over."
"Aus einer Wandnische nahm er drei Gläschen und eine kleine drollige Flasche, nahm eine kleine exotische Schachtel aus farbigen Hölzern, schenkte aus der Flasche die drei Gläschen voll, nahm aus der Schachtel drei dünne, lange, gelbe Zigaretten, zog aus der seidenen Jacke ein Feuerzeug und bot uns Feuer an. Jeder von uns rauchte nun, in seinem Sessel zurückgelehnt, langsam seine Zigarette, deren Rauch dick wie Weihrauch war, und trank in kleinen langsamen Schlucken die herbsüße, wunderlich unbekannt und fremd schmeckende Flüssigkeit, die in der Tat unendlich belebend und beglückend wirkte, als werde man mit Gas gefüllt und verliere seine Schwere. So saßen wir, rauchten in kleinen Zügen, ruhten, nippten an den Gläsern, fühlten uns leicht und froh werden. Dazu sprach Pablo gedämpft mit seiner warmen Stimme:","From a niche in the wall he took three glasses and a small funny bottle, took a small exotic box made of colored wood, filled the three glasses out of the bottle, took three thin, long, yellow cigarettes from the box, pulled a lighter out of his silk jacket and offered us fire. Each of us, leaning back in his armchair, slowly smoked his cigarette, the smoke thick as incense, and drank in slow, small sips the bittersweet, strangely unknown and strange-tasting liquid, which in fact had an infinitely invigorating and blissful effect, as if it were becoming get filled with gas and lose its heaviness. So we sat, smoked in small puffs, rested, sipped our glasses, felt light and happy. To this Pablo spoke softly in his warm voice:","From a recess in the wall he took three glasses and a quaint little bottle, also a small oriental box inlaid with differently colored woods. He filled the three glasses from the bottle and taking three long thin yellow cigarettes from the box and a box of matches from the pocket of his silk jacket he gave us a light. And now we all slowly smoked the cigarettes whose smoke was as thick as incense, leaning back in our chairs and slowly sipping the aromatic liquid whose strange taste was so utterly unfamiliar. Its effect was immeasurably enlivening and delightful—as though one were filled with gas and had no longer any gravity. Thus we sat peacefully exhaling small puffs and taking little sips at our glasses, while every moment we felt ourselves growing lighter and more serene. From far away came Pablo's warm voice.","From a niche in the wall he took down three small glasses and a quaint little bottle, also a tiny, exotic-looking box made of variegated wood. He poured three full glasses from the bottle, then took three long, thin, yellow cigarettes from the box and, producing a lighter from his silk jacket, offered it to us in turn. Now, leaning back in our armchairs, we all slowly smoked the cigarettes, which gave off fumes as dense as incense, and, sip by tiny sip, slowly drank the unfamiliar, bitter-sweet liquid with its curiously alien taste. The drink really did have the effect of putting new life into us and making us feel extremely happy. It was as if we were being filled with gas and becoming weightless. There we sat, taking short puffs on our cigarettes, relaxing, sipping from our glasses, able to feel ourselves becoming lighter and merrier. And as we did so, the muffled sound of Pablo’s warm voice could be heard, saying:"
"»Nicht für jedermann«, sagte er gleichgültig, mit schläfriger Stimme, und lief. Er hatte genug, er wollte heim.","""Not for everyone,"" he said indifferently, in a sleepy voice, and ran. He had enough, he wanted to go home.","""Not for everybody,"" he said dully with a sleepy voice. He had had enough. He was for home, and on he went.","‘Not for everybody,’ he said in a sleepy voice, as if he didn’t care, and went on walking. He had had enough, he couldn’t wait to get home."
"Und wunderlich! – beständig blieb die schöne Blume dennoch das Geschenk, das mir Hermine gemacht hatte! Beständig stand jene hinter ihr, war maskenhaft von ihr umschlossen! Und zwischenein plötzlich dachte ich an Erika, an meine ferne böse Geliebte, an meine arme Freundin. Sie war kaum weniger hübsch als Maria, wenn auch nicht so blühend und erlöst, und an kleinen genialen Liebeskünsten ärmer, und sie stand eine Weile als Bild vor mir, deutlich und schmerzlich, geliebt und tief in mein Schicksal verwoben, und sank wieder dahin, in Schlaf, in Vergessenheit, in halb betrauerte Ferne.","And whimsical! - the beautiful flower remained the gift that Hermione had given me! She was constantly standing behind her, surrounded by her like a mask! And now and then I suddenly thought of Erika, of my evil lover from far away, of my poor friend. She was scarcely less pretty than Maria, though not as blooming and redeemed, and poorer in little ingenious love arts, and she stood before me as an image for a while, clear and painful, loved and deeply woven into my destiny, and sank down again, in sleep, in oblivion, in a half-mourned distance.","And this beautiful flower, strange to say, continued to be nonetheless the gift that Hermine had made me. Hermine continued to stand in front of her and to hide her with a mask. Then suddenly the thought of Erica intervened—my distant, angry love, my poor friend. She was hardly less pretty than Maria, even though not so blooming; and she was more constrained, and not so richly endowed in the little arts of making love. She stood a moment before my eyes, clearly and painfully, loved and deeply woven into my destiny; then fell away again in a deep oblivion, at a half regretted distance.","And, strange to say, this beautiful flower nevertheless constantly remained the present bestowed on me by Hermione. The latter constantly interposed herself between me and Maria, masking her fully. And at one juncture I suddenly thought of Erika, my poor girlfriend, the woman I loved who was somewhere far away, and cross with me. She was scarcely less good-looking than Maria, though not in such full bloom, not as liberated, less gifted in those ingenious little touches Maria brought to the art of lovemaking. For a while I could picture her clearly and painfully, the object of my love, her fate deeply bound up with mine. Then her image faded away again into my sleep and was forgotten, far off, an absence only half lamented."
"Wir trafen uns am nächsten Nachmittag in einem Café. Hermine saß schon dort, als ich kam, trank Tee und zeigte mir lächelnd eine Zeitung, in der sie meinen Namen entdeckt hatte. Es war eines der reaktionären Hetzblätter meiner Heimat, in welchen immer von Zeit zu Zeit heftige Schmähartikel gegen mich die Runde machten. Ich war während des Krieges Kriegsgegner gewesen, ich hatte nach dem Kriege gelegentlich zu Ruhe, Geduld, Menschlichkeit und Selbstkritik gemahnt und mich gegen die täglich schärfer, törichter und wilder werdende nationalistische Hetzerei gewehrt. Da stand nun wieder solch ein Angriff, schlecht geschrieben, halb vom Redakteur selbst verfaßt, halb aus den vielen ähnlichen Aufsätzen der ihm nahestehenden Presse zusammengestohlen. Niemand schreibt bekanntlich so schlecht wie die Verteidiger alternder Ideologien, niemand treibt sein Handwerk mit weniger Sauberkeit und Mühewaltung. Den Aufsatz hatte Hermine gelesen und hatte daraus erfahren, daß Harry Haller ein Schädling und vaterlandsloser Geselle sei und daß es natürlich mit dem Vaterland nicht anders als übel stehen könne, solange solche Menschen und solche Gedanken geduldet würden und die Jugend zu sentimentalen Menschheitsgedanken statt zur kriegerischen Rache am Erbfeind erzogen werde.","We met in a cafe the next afternoon. Hermione was already sitting there when I arrived, drinking tea and smilingly showing me a newspaper in which she had discovered my name. It was one of the reactionary inflammatory newspapers in my homeland, in which violent articles against me made the rounds from time to time. During the war I had been an opponent of the war, after the war I had occasionally urged calm, patience, humanity and self-criticism and defended myself against the nationalist agitation that was becoming sharper, more foolish and wilder every day. Here was another attack, badly written, half written by the editor himself, half stolen from the many similar articles in the press close to him. It is a well-known fact that no one writes as badly as the defenders of aging ideologies, no one pursues their craft with less cleanliness and effort. Hermione had read the essay and had learned from it that Harry Haller was a wreck and a fellow without a country and that things could of course not be anything but bad for the fatherland as long as such people and such thoughts were tolerated and as long as young people tended towards sentimental ideas about humanity instead of warlike ones revenge on the hereditary enemy.","We met at a café on the following afternoon. Hermine was there before me, drinking tea, and she pointed with a smile to my name which she had found in a newspaper. It was one of the reactionary jingo papers of my own district in which from time to time violently abusive references to me were circulated. During the war I had been opposed to it and, after, I had from time to time counseled quiet and patience and humanity and a criticism that began at home; and I had resisted the nationalist jingoism that became every day more pronounced, more insane and unrestrained. Here, then, was another attack of this kind, badly written, in part the work of the editor himself and in part stolen from articles of a similar kind in papers of similar tendencies to his own. It is common knowledge that no one writes worse than these defenders of decrepit ideas. No one plies his trade with less of decency and conscientious care. Hermine had read the article, and it had informed her that Harry Haller was a noxious insect and a man who disowned his native land, and that it stood to reason that no good could come to the country so long as such persons and such ideas were tolerated and the minds of the young turned to sentimental ideas of humanity instead of to revenge by arms upon the hereditary foe.","We met in a café the next afternoon. When I arrived, Hermione, already sitting there drinking tea, smiled and showed me a newspaper in which she had discovered my name. It was one of those reactionary, mud-slinging rags from my home country that from time to time would publish defamatory articles against me. I had been an opponent of the war as it was taking place, and when it was over I had occasionally urged calm and patience, the need to behave humanely and self-critically, while combating the nationalistic hate campaign that was becoming more shrill, mindless and unrestrained by the day. Now here was yet another attack of that sort, badly written, partly the work of the editor himself, partly cobbled together by lifting passages from the many similar pieces that papers sympathetic to the same line had already published. It is well known that nobody writes as badly as those seeking to defend ideologies that have outlived their time. None ply their trade with less effort or attention to detail. Having read the piece, Hermione had learned that Harry Haller was a harmful pest, a wretch without any allegiance to the Fatherland. And it went without saying that the Fatherland was bound to be in a sorry state as long as people like him, with ideas like his, were tolerated, and the nation’s youth was being taught to embrace sentimental humanistic ideas instead of being trained to take warlike revenge on the hereditary foe.9"

"Da ich schwieg, fuhr er fort: »Glauben Sie bitte nicht, daß ich ironisch spreche! Lieber Herr, nichts liegt mir ferner, als diese Bürgerlichkeit und Ordnung etwa verlachen zu wollen. Es ist ja richtig, ich selbst lebe in einer andern Welt, nicht in dieser, und vielleicht wäre ich nicht imstande, es auch nur einen Tag lang in einer Wohnung mit solchen Araukarien auszuhalten. Aber wenn ich auch ein alter und etwas ruppiger Steppenwolf bin, so bin doch auch ich der Sohn einer Mutter, und auch meine Mutter war eine Bürgersfrau und zog Blumen und wachte über Stube und Treppe, Möbel und Gardinen und bemühte sich, ihrer Wohnung und ihrem Leben so viel Sauberkeit, Reinheit und Ordentlichkeit zu geben, als nur immer gehen wollte.

Dear sir, nothing is farther from my mind than wanting to laugh at this bourgeois manner and order.

But even if I am an old and somewhat rough Steppenwolf, I am also the son of a mother, and my mother was also a middle-class woman and grew flowers and watched over the room and stairs, furniture and curtains and took care of her apartment and hers To give life as much cleanliness, purity and neatness as only ever wanted to leave. The whiff of turpentine reminds me of that, of that the araucaria, and there I sit here and there, look at this quiet little garden of order and am glad that it still exists.«","""Do not, please, think for a moment,"" he went on when I said nothing in reply, ""that I speak with irony. My dear sir, I would not for the world laugh at the bourgeois life. It is true that I live myself in another world, and perhaps I could not endure to live a single day in a house with araucarias. But though I am a shabby old Steppenwolf, still I'm the son of a mother, and my mother too was a middle-class man's wife and raised plants and took care to have her house and home as clean and neat and tidy as ever she could make it. All that is brought back to me by this breath of turpentine and by the araucaria, and so I sit down here every now and again; and I look into this quiet little garden of order and rejoice that such things still are.""","Since I remained silent, he went on: ‘Please don’t think I’m being ironic. The last thing I would want to do is pour scorn on this orderly bourgeois way of life. It’s true, of course, that I myself live in a different world, not this one, and it may well be that I couldn’t survive for even one day in a flat like that with its araucaria plants. Yet even though I’m an old Steppenwolf, inclined to snap at people, I am the son of a mother, and my mother too was a respectable housewife who grew plants and saw to it that the living room, the stairs, the furniture and the curtains were presentable. She always did her utmost to make her home and life as neat, clean and tidy as was humanly possible. That’s what this whiff of turpentine, that’s what the araucaria reminds me of, and that’s the reason why every now and then I’m to be found sitting here, gazing into this little garden of order and rejoicing at the fact that such things still exist.’"

"Ein neuer Tanz, ein Foxtrott, eroberte sich in jenem Winter die Welt, mit dem Titel »Yearning«. Dieser Yearning wurde einmal ums andre gespielt und immer neu begehrt, alle waren wir von ihm durchtränkt und berauscht, alle summten wir seine Melodie mit. Ich tanzte ununterbrochen, mit jeder Frau, die mir eben in den Weg lief, mit ganz jungen Mädchen, mit blühenden jungen Frauen, mit sommerlich vollreifen, mit wehmütig verblühenden: von allen entzückt, lachend, glücklich, strahlend. Und als Pablo mich so strahlen sah, mich, den er immer als einen sehr beklagenswerten armen Teufel angesehen hatte, da blitzten seine Augen mich glückselig an, er stand begeistert von seinem Orchesterstuhl auf, stieß heftig in sein Horn, stieg auf den Stuhl, stand oben und blies mit vollen Backen und wiegte sich und sein Instrument dazu wild und selig im Takt des Yearning, und ich und meine Tänzerin warfen ihm Kußhände zu und sangen laut mit. Ach, dachte ich zwischenein, mag mit mir geschehen, was da wolle, einmal bin doch auch ich glücklich gewesen, strahlend, meiner selbst entbunden, ein Bruder Pablos, ein Kind.","A new dance, a foxtrot, conquered the world that winter, entitled »Yearning«. This Yearning was played over and over again and always wanted anew, we were all soaked and intoxicated by it, we all hummed along to its melody. I danced non-stop, with every woman who crossed my path, with very young girls, with blooming young women, with summery mature women, with melancholy withering ones: delighted, laughing, happy, radiant by everyone. And when Pablo saw me so radiant, me whom he had always regarded as a very pitiable poor devil, his eyes flashed happily at me, he got up enthusiastically from his orchestra chair, blew his horn hard, climbed onto the chair, stood up and blew with full cheeks and swayed himself and his instrument wildly and blissfully to the beat of the Yearning, and I and my dancer blew kisses to him and sang along loudly. Ah, I thought in between, no matter what happens to me, I too was happy once, beaming, freed from myself, a brother of Pablo, a child.","A new dance, a fox trot, with the title ""Yearning,"" had swept the world that winter. Once we had beard it we could not have enough of it. We were all soaked in it and intoxicated with it and everyone hummed the melody whenever it was played. I danced without stop and with anyone who came in my way, with quite young girls, with women in their earlier or their later prime, and with those who had sadly passed them both; and with them all I was enraptured—laughing, happy, radiant. And when Pablo saw me so radiant, me whom he had always looked on as a very lamentable poor devil, his eyes beamed blissfully upon me and he was so inspired that he got up from his chair and blowing lustily in his horn climbed up on it. From this elevation he blew with all his might, while at the same time his whole body, and his instrument with it, swayed to the tune of ""Yearning. "" I and my partner kissed our hands to him and sang loudly in response. Ah, thought I, meanwhile, let come to me what may, for once at least, I, too, have been happy, radiant, released from myself, a brother of Pablo's, a child.","That winter a new dance tune, a foxtrot entitled ‘Yearning’ was taking the world by storm. There were constant requests for it at the ball and it was played time and again. It was in all our heads, we were carried away by it, all of us humming along to its tune. I kept on dancing without a break, with every woman who happened to come my way, with very young girls, women in the full flush of youth, women in the summer of their lives, women beginning wistfully to fade. Delighted by them all, I was beaming, laughing, happy. When he saw me in such a radiant mood, Pablo, who had always considered me a poor devil who was greatly to be pitied, gave me a joyful look, his eyes flashing. Then, rising enthusiastically from his seat in the band and playing a powerful flourish on his horn, he climbed on his chair and, standing up there, puffed out his cheeks, blowing for all he was worth and blissfully rocking himself and his instrument in time to ‘Yearning’. My partner and I blew kisses to him, singing along loudly to the dance tune. Ah well, I was thinking to myself meanwhile, whatever might happen to me, for once in my life I too have been happy, beaming, liberated from my self, a brother of Pablo, a child."

"Und nun befahl der Wolf, und der Mensch mußte gehorchen. Auf Befehl sank der Mensch in die Knie nieder, spielte den Wolf, ließ die Zunge heraushängen, riß sich mit den plombierten Zähnen die Kleider vom Leibe. Er ging, je nachdem der Menschenbändiger befahl, auf zweien oder auf vieren, machte das Männchen, stellte sich tot, ließ den Wolf auf sich reiten, trug ihm die Peitsche nach. Hündisch und begabt ging er auf jede Demütigung und Perversion phantasievoll ein. Ein schönes Mädchen kam auf die Bühne, näherte sich dem dressierten Mann, streichelte ihm das Kinn, rieb ihre Wange an seiner, aber er blieb auf allen vieren, blieb Vieh, schüttelte den Kopf und fing an, der Schönen die Zähne zu zeigen, zuletzt so drohend und wölfisch, daß sie entfloh. Schokolade wurde ihm vorgesetzt, die er verächtlich beschnoberte und wegstieß. Und zuletzt wurde das weiße Lamm und das fette gescheckte Kaninchen wieder hereingebracht, und der gelehrige Mensch gab sein Letztes her und spielte den Wolf, daß es eine Lust war. Mit Fingern und Zähnen packte er die schreienden Tierchen, riß ihnen Fetzen von Fell und Fleisch heraus, kaute grinsend ihr lebendiges Fleisch und soff hingegeben, trunken mit wollust-geschlossenen Augen, ihr warmes Blut.","And now the wolf commanded, and man had to obey. On command, the man dropped to his knees, played the wolf, let his tongue loll out, tore his clothes off with his sealed teeth. Depending on the man tamer's command, he went in twos or fours, made the male, pretended to be dead, let the wolf ride on him, carried the whip after him. Doglike and talented, he responded imaginatively to every humiliation and perversion. A beautiful girl came on the stage, approached the trained man, stroked his chin, rubbed her cheek against his, but he remained on all fours, remained cattle, shook his head and began to show the beauty his teeth, last so menacing and wolfish that she fled. Chocolate was placed in front of him, which he sniffed contemptuously and pushed away. And at last the white lamb and the fat spotted rabbit were brought in again, and the docile man gave his last and played the wolf so that it was a pleasure. With fingers and teeth he grabbed the screaming little animals, tore rags of fur and flesh out of them, chewed their living flesh with a grin and drank their warm blood in a drunken state with their eyes closed with voluptuousness.","And now the wolf commanded and the man obeyed. At the word of command the man sank on his knees, let his tongue loll out and tore his clothes off with his filed teeth. He went on two feet or all-fours just as the wolf ordered him, played the human being, lay for dead, let the wolf ride on his back and carried the whip after him. With the aptness of a dog he submitted gladly to every humiliation and perversion of his nature. A lovely girl came on to the stage and went up to the tamed man. She stroked his chin and rubbed her cheek against his; but he remained on all-fours, remained a beast. He shook his head and began to show his teeth at the charming creature—so menacingly and wolfishly at last, that she ran away. Chocolate was put before him, but with a contemptuous sniff he thrust it from him with his snout. Finally the white lamb and the fat mottled rabbit were brought on again and the docile man gave his last turn and played the wolf most amusingly. He seized the shrieking creatures in his fingers and teeth, tore them limb from limb, grinningly chewed the living flesh and rapturously drank their warm blood while his eyes closed in a dreamy delight.","Now it was the wolf’s turn to command, and the human being had to obey. When ordered to, the tamer sank to his knees and played the part of the wolf, letting his tongue hang out and using his teeth, which were full of fillings, to tear the clothes from his body. Depending on what the ‘human-tamer’ commanded, he walked upright or crawled on all fours, sat up and begged, played dead, let the wolf ride on him, fetched him his whip. He proved a very gifted dog, highly imaginative in his willingness to submit to every humiliation and perversion. A beautiful girl came on to the stage and, going up to the tamed man, stroked his chin and rubbed her cheek against his. He, however, stayed on all fours, still an animal. Shaking his head, he began baring his teeth at the good-looking girl, eventually causing her to take flight, so menacing and wolf-like was his behaviour. When offered some chocolate he sniffed at it contemptuously and pushed it away. Finally, the white lamb and the plump, spotted rabbit were brought on again and the man showed what a willing pupil he was by playing the wolf to the hilt. His performance was breathtaking. Seizing on the screaming little creatures with his fingers and teeth, he tore scraps of skin and flesh from them, grinning as he ate them alive, and closing his eyes in drunken ecstasy as, beside himself, he quaffed their warm blood."

"Es war der erste Maskenball, den ich mitmachen sollte. In frühern Zeiten hatte ich zwar solche Feste je und je besucht, sie zuweilen auch hübsch gefunden, aber ich hatte nicht getanzt und war nur Zuschauer gewesen, und die Begeisterung, mit der ich andre davon hatte erzählen, sich darauf hatte freuen hören, war mir immer komisch erschienen. Heute nun war auch für mich der Ball ein Ereignis, auf das ich mich mit Spannung und nicht ohne Ängstlichkeit freute. Da ich keine Dame hinzuführen hatte, beschloß ich, erst spät hinzugehen, dies hatte mir auch Hermine empfohlen.","It was the first masked ball I was supposed to attend. In earlier times I had always attended such festivals and sometimes found them pretty, but I had not danced and had only been a spectator, and the enthusiasm with which I had heard others talk about it and had looked forward to it was mine always seemed funny. Today the ball was also an event for me that I was looking forward to with excitement and not without anxiety. Since I didn't have a lady to take, I decided to go late, as Hermione had recommended.","It was the first masked ball I was to participate in. In earlier days, it is true, I had now and again attended such festivities and even sometimes found them very entertaining, but I had never danced. I had been a spectator merely. As for the enthusiasm with which others had talked and rejoiced over them in my hearing, it had always struck me as comic. And now the day had come for me too to find the occasion one of almost painful suspense. As I had no partner to take, I decided not to go till late. This, too, Hermine had counseled me.","This was to be the first masked ball I had participated in, for although I had now and again attended such festivities in earlier years, sometimes even finding them fun, I had not joined in the dancing but merely been an onlooker. And it had always struck me as strange that other people should talk about them and look forward to them so enthusiastically. Today’s ball was now a special event for me too and I was looking forward to it, if somewhat nervously, with eager anticipation. I decided, since I had no partner to take with me, to leave it late before going, which is what Hermione had also recommended."
"»Da haben Sie recht«, gab ich zu. »Es ist leider eine Gewohnheit, ein Laster von mir, mich immer für den möglichst krassen Ausdruck zu entscheiden, was übrigens Goethe in seinen guten Stunden auch getan hat. Dieser süße spießige Salongoethe freilich hätte nie einen krassen, einen echten, unmittelbaren Ausdruck gebraucht. Ich bitte Sie und Ihre Frau sehr um Entschuldigung – sagen Sie ihr bitte, daß ich schizophren bin. Und zugleich bitte ich um Erlaubnis, mich empfehlen zu dürfen.« Der betretene Herr erhob zwar noch einige Einwände, kam auch wieder darauf zu sprechen, wie schön und anregend unsre einstigen Unterredungen gewesen seien, ja, daß meine Vermutungen über Mithras und Krischna ihm damals tiefen Eindruck gemacht hätten und daß er gehofft habe, auch heute wieder . . . und so weiter. Ich dankte ihm und sagte, daß dies sehr freundliche Worte seien, daß aber leider mein Interesse für Krischna ebenso wie meine Lust zu wissenschaftlichen Gesprächen ganz und gar geschwunden sei, daß ich ihn heute mehrmals angelogen habe, so sei ich zum Beispiel nicht seit einigen Tagen hier in der Stadt, sondern seit vielen Monaten, lebe aber für mich allein und sei nicht mehr für den Verkehr in besseren Häusern geeignet, denn erstens sei ich stets sehr schlechter Laune und mit Gicht behaftet und zweitens meistens betrunken. Ferner, um reinen Tisch zu schaffen und wenigstens nicht als Lügner wegzugehen, müsse ich dem verehrten Herrn erklären, daß er mich heute recht sehr beleidigt habe. Er habe sich jene dumme, stiernackige, eines beschäftigungslosen Offiziers, nicht aber eines Gelehrten würdige Stellung eines reaktionären Blattes zu Hallers Meinungen zu eigen gemacht. Dieser »Bursche« und vaterlandslose Geselle Haller aber sei ich selber, und es stünde besser um unser Land und um die Welt, wenn wenigstens die paar denkfähigen Menschen sich zu Vernunft und Friedensliebe bekennten, statt blind und besessen auf einen neuen Krieg loszusteuern. So, und damit Gott befohlen.","""You're right,"" I admitted. »Unfortunately it is a habit, a vice of mine, to always opt for the most crass expression possible, which, by the way, Goethe also did in his good hours. Of course, this sweet, conservative Salongoethe would never have needed a crass, genuine, direct expression. My apologies to you and your wife - please tell her I'm schizophrenic. And at the same time I ask permission to commend myself.” The embarrassed gentleman raised a few more objections, but also came back to talking about how beautiful and stimulating our earlier conversations had been, yes, that my suspicions about Mithras and Krishna he had at that time had made a deep impression and that he had hoped to . . . and so forth. I thanked him and said that these were very kind words, but that unfortunately my interest in Krishna as well as my desire for scientific discussions had completely disappeared, that I had lied to him several times today, for example I hadn't been there for a few days here in the city, but for many months, but I live on my own and am no longer suitable for the traffic in better houses, because firstly I am always in a very bad mood and gouty and secondly I am mostly drunk. Furthermore, in order to clear the slate and at least not go away as a liar, I must explain to the honorable gentleman that he had insulted me quite a lot today. He had adopted that stupid, bull-necked position of a reactionary newspaper on Haller's opinions, worthy of an unemployed officer but not of a scholar. But this ""lad"" and homeless journeyman Haller is myself, and things would be better for our country and the world if at least the few thoughtful people professed reason and a love of peace, instead of blindly and obsessingly setting off for a new war. So, and with it God commanded.","""There you are right,"" I admitted. "" Unfortunately it is a habit, a vice of mine, always to speak my mind as much as possible, as indeed Goethe did, too, in his better moments. In this chaste drawing room Goethe would certainly never have allowed himself to use an outrageous, a genuine and unqualified expression. I sincerely beg your wife's pardon and your own. Tell her, please, that I am a schizomaniac. And now, if you will allow me, I will take my leave."" To this he made objections in spite of his perplexity. He even went back to the subject of our former discussions and said once more how interesting and stimulating they had been and how deep an impression my theories about Mithras and Krishna had made on him at the time. He had hoped that the present occasion would have been an opportunity to renew these discussions. I thanked him for speaking as he did. Unfortunately, my interest in Krishna had vanished and also my pleasure in learned discussions. Further, I had told him several lies that day. For example, I had been many months in the town, and not a few days, as I had said. I lived, however, quite by myself, and was no longer fit for decent society; for in the first place, I was nearly always in a bad temper and afflicted with the gout, and in the second place, usually drunk. Lastly, to make a clean slate, and not to go away, at least, as a liar, it was my duty to inform him that he had grievously insulted me that evening. He had endorsed the attitude taken up by a reactionary paper towards Haller's opinions; a stupid bull-necked paper, fit for an officer on half-pay, not for a man of learning. This bad fellow and rotten patriot, Haller, however, and myself were one and the same person, and it would be better for our country and the world in general, if at least the few people who were capable of thought stood for reason and the love of peace instead of heading wildly with a blind obsession for a new war. And so I would bid him good-bye.","‘You are right,’ I conceded. ‘ Unfortunately it’s a bad habit of mine, one of my vices. I’m always opting for the crassest form of words possible, something Goethe, by the way, also did in his better moments. Of course this sugar-sweet, petit bourgeois, front-parlour Goethe would never have used a crass, genuine, direct expression of any kind. I beg your and your wife’s forgiveness. Please tell her that I am a schizophrenic. And with that, if I may, I’ll take my leave.’ The embarrassed professor raised a few more objections, then again mentioned how agreeable and stimulating our former discussions had been. Indeed he had been profoundly impressed at the time by my theories about Mithras and Krishna and had , he said, been hoping that today too … and so on. Thanking him, I said it was very kind of him to say all this, but that unfortunately my interest in Krishna as well as my desire to take part in academic discussions had completely worn off. I had, I said, lied to him on several occasions today. It was not true, for example, that I had been in town for just a few days. I had been here for many months but, now living my own life apart , I was not the ideal person to invite to a better class of home. For one thing, I was constantly in a bad mood and plagued with gout; and secondly I was drunk most of the time. What’s more, just to get things straight and in order not to go away a liar, I needed to make it clear to the honourable gentleman that he had today insulted me most grievously. How? By siding with the verdict of a reactionary rag on the views expressed by Haller – a stupid, bull-necked verdict worthy of an unemployed army officer, not an academic scholar. However, this Haller ‘fellow’, this chap lacking any allegiance to the Fatherland, was none other than me; and our country and the whole world would be a lot better off if at least the few people capable of thinking would stand up for reason and love of peace instead of blindly and fanatically heading towards a new war. Now he knew, and with that I wished him goodbye."
"Es ist hier nicht die Rede vom Menschen, den die Schule, die Nationalökonomie, die Statistik kennt, nicht vom Menschen, wie er zu Millionen auf den Straßen herumläuft und von dem nichts andres zu halten ist als vom Sand am Meer oder von den Spritzern einer Brandung: es kommt auf ein paar Millionen mehr oder weniger nicht an, sie sind Material, sonst nichts. Nein, wir sprechen hier vom Menschen im hohen Sinn, vom Ziel des langen Weges der Menschwerdung, vom königlichen Menschen, von den Unsterblichen.

No, we are speaking here of man in the high sense, of the goal of the long road to becoming man, of royal man, of the immortals. Genius is not as rare as it often seems to us, nor is it as common as literary and world histories, let alone the newspapers, think. Steppenwolf Harry, it seems to us, would be genius enough to take the risk of incarnation instead of whining away at every difficulty to his stupid Steppenwolf.","We are not dealing here with man as he is known to economics and statistics, as he is seen thronging the streets by the million, and of whom no more account can be made than of the sand of the sea or the spray of its waves.

No, we are speaking of man in the highest sense, of the end of the long road to true manhood, of kingly men, of the immortals. Genius is not so rare as we sometimes think; nor, certainly, so frequent as may appear from history books or, indeed, from the newspapers. Harry has, we should say, genius enough to attempt the quest of true manhood instead of discoursing pitifully about his stupid Steppenwolf at every difficulty encountered.","We are not now talking about human beings as educationalists, economists and statisticians understand them. We are not concerned with the millions of them that roam our streets. They are just like so many grains of sand or the spray from waves breaking on the shore. Whether there are a few million more of them, or fewer, is unimportant. They are mere material, nothing more. No, we are talking about human beings in the ideal sense of the term, about the goal reached at the end of a long process of becoming fully human, about sovereign human beings, about the Immortals. Genius is not as rare a phenomenon as often seems to us the case, although it is of course not as common as histories of literature or the world, not to mention newspapers, would have us believe. Harry the Steppenwolf would, it seems to us, be blessed with sufficient genius to venture along the road to becoming fully human instead of pitying himself whenever he encounters the slightest difficulty and, as an excuse, falling back on the stupid notion of himself as Steppenwolf."
"Dieses Buch enthält die uns gebliebenen Aufzeichnungen jenes Mannes, welchen wir mit einem Ausdruck, den er selbst mehrmals gebrauchte, den »Steppenwolf« nannten. Ob sein Manuskript eines einführenden Vorwortes bedürfe, sei dahingestellt; mir jedenfalls ist es ein Bedürfnis, den Blättern des Steppenwolfes einige beizufügen, auf denen ich versuche, meine Erinnerung an ihn aufzuzeichnen. Es ist nur wenig, was ich über ihn weiß, und namentlich ist seine ganze Vergangenheit und Herkunft mir unbekannt geblieben. Doch habe ich von seiner Persönlichkeit einen starken und, wie ich trotz allem sagen muß, sympathischen Eindruck behalten.","This book contains the surviving notes of that man whom we called ""Steppenwolf,"" using an expression that he himself used several times. Whether his manuscript requires an introductory foreword is an open question; In any case, I feel the need to enclose some of the Steppenwolf leaves on which I am trying to record my memories of him. I know very little about him, and in particular his entire past and origins remain unknown to me. But I have retained a strong and, in spite of everything, sympathetic impression of his personality.","THIS BOOK CONTAINS THE RECORDS LEFT US by a man whom, according to the expression he often used himself, we called the Steppenwolf. Whether this manuscript needs any introductory remarks may be open to question. I, however, feel the need of adding a few pages to those of the Steppenwolf in which I try to record my recollections of him. What I know of him is little enough. Indeed, of his past life and origins I know nothing at all. Yet the impression left by his personality has remained, in spite of all, a deep and sympathetic one.","This volume contains the surviving notebooks of the man we used to call ‘Steppenwolf’ – an expression he himself employed on several occasions. Whether his manuscript is in need of a preface to introduce it is a moot point, but I at any rate feel the need to add to Steppenwolf’s pages a few of my own in which I shall try to record my memories of him. Since I am wholly ignorant of his background and past life my actual knowledge of the man is scanty. I have, however, retained a strong and I must say, despite everything, congenial impression of his personality."
"Da hatte ich nun zwei Bildnisse von mir in Händen, das eine ein Selbstbildnis in Knittelversen, traurig und angstvoll wie ich selbst, das andre kühl und mit dem Anschein hoher Objektivität gezeichnet, von einem Außenstehenden, von außen und von oben gesehen, geschrieben von einem, der mehr und doch auch weniger wußte als ich selbst. Und diese beiden Bildnisse zusammen, mein schwermütig stammelndes Gedicht und die kluge Studie von unbekannter Hand, taten mir beide weh, hatten beide recht, zeichneten beide ungeschminkt meine trostlose Existenz, zeigten beide deutlich die Unerträglichkeit und Unhaltbarkeit meines Zustandes. Dieser Steppenwolf mußte sterben, er mußte mit eigener Hand seinem verhaßten Dasein ein Ende machen – oder er mußte, geschmolzen im Todesfeuer einer erneuten Selbstschau, sich wandeln, seine Maske abreißen und eine neue Ichwerdung begehen. Ach, dieser Vorgang war mir nicht neu und unbekannt, ich kannte ihn, ich hatte ihn mehrmals schon erlebt, jedesmal in Zeiten der äußersten Verzweiflung. Jedesmal war bei diesem schwer aufwühlenden Erlebnis mein jeweiliges Ich in Scherben zerbrochen, jedesmal hatten Mächte der Tiefe es aufgerüttelt und zerstört, jedesmal war dabei ein gehegtes und besonders geliebtes Stück meines Lebens mir untreu geworden und verlorengegangen. Das eine Mal hatte ich meinen bürgerlichen Ruf samt meinem Vermögen verloren und hatte lernen müssen, auf die Achtung derer zu verzichten, die bisher vor mir den Hut gezogen hatten. Das andre Mal war über Nacht mein Familienleben zusammengebrochen; meine geisteskrank gewordene Frau hatte mich aus Haus und Behagen vertrieben, Liebe und Vertrauen hatte sich plötzlich in Haß und tödlichen Kampf verwandelt, mitleidig und verächtlich blickten die Nachbarn mir nach. Damals hatte meine Vereinsamung ihren Anfang genommen. Und wieder um Jahre, um schwere bittere Jahre später, nachdem ich mir in strenger Einsamkeit und mühsamer Selbstzucht ein neues, asketisch-geistiges Leben und Ideal gebaut und wieder eine gewisse Stille und Höhe des Lebens erreicht hatte, hingegeben an abstrakte Denkübung und an streng geregelte Meditation, da war auch diese Lebensgestaltung wieder zusammengebrochen und hatte ihren edlen hohen Sinn mit einemmal verloren; auf wilden anstrengenden Reisen riß es mich aufs neue durch die Welt, neue Leiden türmten sich und neue Schuld. Und jedesmal war dem Abreißen einer Maske, dem Zusammenbruch eines Ideals diese grausige Leere und Stille vorangegangen, diese tödliche Einschnürung, Vereinsamung und Beziehungslosigkeit, diese leere öde Hölle der Lieblosigkeit und Verzweiflung, wie ich sie auch jetzt wieder zu durchwandern hatte.","There I now had in my hands two portraits of myself, one a self-portrait in dog verse, sad and anxious like myself, the other drawn coolly and with the appearance of high objectivity, by an outsider, seen from without and from above, written by one , who knew more and yet also less than I myself. And these two portraits together, my melancholy stammering poem and the clever study by an unknown hand, both hurt me, both were right, both unvarnished portrayed my dreary existence, both clearly showed the intolerability and intolerability of my condition. This Steppenwolf had to die, he had to put an end to his hated existence with his own hand - or, melted in the death fire of a new self-reflection, he had to change, tear off his mask and commit to a new self-incarnation. Ah, this event was not new and unknown to me, I knew it, I had experienced it several times, always in times of extreme despair. Each time my own self shattered into fragments during this very turbulent experience, each time powers from the deep had shaken it up and destroyed it, each time a cherished and especially loved part of my life had become unfaithful to me and been lost. Once I had lost my civic reputation along with my fortune and had had to learn to renounce the respect of those who had previously taken their hats off to me. The other time my family life collapsed overnight; my wife, who had become mentally ill, had driven me out of my home and comfort, love and trust had suddenly turned into hate and a deadly struggle, the neighbors looked after me with pity and contempt. It was then that my loneliness had begun. And again years later, hard, bitter years later, after I had built a new, ascetic-spiritual life and ideal in strict solitude and arduous self-discipline and had again reached a certain stillness and height of life, devoted to abstract and strictly regulated thought exercises Meditation, this way of life collapsed again and suddenly lost its noble, high meaning; on wild, strenuous journeys I was torn through the world anew, new suffering piled up and new guilt. And each time, the tearing off of a mask, the collapse of an ideal, was preceded by this horrible emptiness and stillness, this deadly constriction, loneliness and lack of connection, this empty, barren hell of lovelessness and despair, which I had to traverse again now.","So now I had two portraits of myself before me, one a self-portrait in doggerel verse, as sad and sorry as myself; the other painted with the air of a lofty impartiality by one who stood outside and who knew more and yet less of me than I did myself. And both these pictures of myself, my dispirited and halting poem and the clever study by an unknown hand, equally afflicted me. Both were right. Both gave the unvarnished truth about my shiftless existence. Both showed clearly how unbearable and untenable my situation was. Death was decreed for this Steppenwolf. He must with his own hand make an end of his detested existence—unless, molten in the fire of a renewed self-knowledge, he underwent a change and passed over to a self, new and undisguised. Alas! this transition was not unknown to me. I had already experienced it several times, and always in periods of utmost despair. On each occasion of this terribly uprooting experience, my self, as it then was, was shattered to fragments. Each time deep-seated powers had shaken and destroyed it; each time there had followed the loss of a cherished and particularly beloved part of my life that was true to me no more. Once, I had lost my profession and livelihood. I had had to forfeit the esteem of those who before had touched their caps to me. Next, my family life fell in ruins over night, when my wife, whose mind was disordered, drove me from house and home. Love and confidence had changed of a sudden to hate and deadly enmity and the neighbors saw me go with pitying scorn. It was then that my solitude had its beginning. Years of hardship and bitterness went by. I had built up the ideal of a new life, inspired by the asceticism of the intellect. I had attained a certain serenity and elevation of life once more, submitting myself to the practice of abstract thought and to a rule of austere meditation. But this mold, too, was broken and lost at one blow all its exalted and noble intent. A whirl of travel drove me afresh over the earth; fresh sufferings were heaped up, and fresh guilt. And every occasion when a mask was torn off, an ideal broken, was preceded by this hateful vacancy and stillness, this deathly constriction and loneliness and unrelatedness, this waste and empty hell of lovelessness and despair, such as I had now to pass through once more.","Now I had two portraits of myself to hand, one a self-portrait in crude rhyming doggerel, sad and anxious just like me, the other cool and, it would seem, highly objective, the work of someone uninvolved, picturing me from the outside and from above. Whoever wrote it knew more than I myself did, yet in some senses also less. And both these portraits together, my melancholy, halting words in the poem and the clever study by some unknown hand, caused me pain. Both of them were right, both painted an unvarnished picture of my desperate existence, both clearly revealed just how intolerable and unsustainable a state I was in. This Steppenwolf had to die, he had to put an end to his detestable existence by his own hand. Either that, or he must undergo the deadly flames of further self-scrutiny till melting point, then transform himself, tear off his mask and enter upon a new stage of self-development. Alas, I was no stranger to this process. I knew it of old; I had already experienced it several times, always in periods of extreme despair. In the course of this deeply disturbing experience my then self had on each occasion been shattered in fragments; each time profound forces had shaken and destroyed it; each time I had been deserted by and lost a cherished and particularly dear part of myself. In one such instance, as well as my worldly wealth, I had lost my reputation as a respectable citizen, and had to learn to live without the esteem of those who previously had raised their hats to me. A second time my family life had collapsed overnight. My wife, falling mentally ill, had driven me out of house and comfortable home; love and trust had suddenly turned into hatred and mortal combat; the neighbours watched me go with a mixture of sympathy and disdain. That had been the beginning of my progressive isolation. And once more, after a period of years, cruelly hard years when I had been able, in strict isolation and by means of harsh self-discipline, to construct a new life based on ascetic and spiritual ideals and to regain a certain degree of calm and sovereign control, this rebuilt existence, dedicated to exercises in abstract thought and strictly regulated meditation, had also collapsed, having all at once lost its noble and lofty purpose. Something launched me on mad, strenuous journeys around the world again, leading to new suffering and new guilt in abundance. And each time, before tearing off one of my masks and witnessing the collapse of one of my ideals, I had experienced the same dreadful emptiness and silence, the same sense of being caught in a mesh, isolated, without human contact, the same empty and barren hell, bereft of love and hope, that I was now obliged to go through once again."
"Wir saßen und plauderten und tranken Champagner. Wir schlenderten beobachtend durch die Säle, abenteuernde Entdecker, suchten uns Paare aus, deren Liebesspiel wir belauschten. Sie zeigte mir Frauen, mit denen zu tanzen sie mich aufforderte, und gab mir Ratschläge über die Verführungskünste, welche bei dieser und bei jener anzuwenden seien. Wir traten als Nebenbuhler auf, strichen beide eine Weile derselben Frau nach, tanzten abwechselnd beide mit ihr, suchten beide sie zu gewinnen. Und doch war dies alles nur Maskenspiel, war nur ein Spiel zwischen uns beiden, flocht uns beide enger zusammen, entzündete uns beide füreinander. Alles war Märchen, alles war um eine Dimension reicher, um eine Bedeutung tiefer, war Spiel und Symbol. Wir sahen eine sehr schöne junge Frau, die etwas leidend und unzufrieden aussah, Hermann tanzte mit ihr, brachte sie zum Blühen, verschwand mit ihr in eine Sektlaube und erzählte mir nachher, sie habe diese Frau nicht als Mann erobert, sondern als Frau, mit dem Zauber von Lesbos. Mir aber ward allmählich dies ganze tönende Haus voll tanzbrausender Säle, dieses berauschte Volk von Masken zu einem tollen Traumparadies, Blüte um Blüte warb mit ihrem Duft, Frucht um Frucht umspielte ich suchend mit probenden Fingern, Schlangen blickten mich aus grünem Laubschatten verführend an, Lotosblüte geisterte über schwarzem Sumpf, Zaubervögel lockten im Gezweige, und alles führte mich doch zu einem ersehnten Ziel, alles lud mich neu mit Sehnsucht nach der Einzigen. Einmal tanzte ich mit einem unbekannten Mädchen, glühend, werbend, riß sie mit in Taumel und Rausch, und während wir im Unwirklichen schwebten, sagte sie, plötzlich auflachend: »Man kennt dich nicht wieder. Heut abend warst du so dumm und fad.« Und ich erkannte die, die vor Stunden »alter Brummbär« zu mir gesagt hatte. Nun glaubte sie mich zu haben, aber im nächsten Tanz war es schon eine andere, an der ich glühte. Ich tanzte zwei Stunden oder länger immerzu, jeden Tanz, auch Tänze, die ich nie gelernt hatte. Immer wieder tauchte in meiner Nähe Hermann auf, der lächelnde Jüngling, nickte mir zu, verschwand im Gewühl.","We sat and chatted and drank champagne. We strolled through the halls, adventurous explorers, looking for couples whose lovemaking we overheard. She showed me women with whom she asked me to dance, and gave me advice on the arts of seduction to be used with this and that. We acted as rivals, we both chased after the same woman for a while, we both took turns dancing with her, both tried to win her over. And yet it was all just a masquerade, just a game between the two of us, tying us both closer together, making us both on fire for each other. Everything was a fairy tale, everything was one dimension richer, one meaning deeper, it was play and symbol. We saw a very beautiful young woman who looked a bit suffering and dissatisfied. Hermann danced with her, made her bloom, disappeared with her into a champagne arbor and later told me that she hadn't conquered this woman as a man, but as a woman the magic of Lesvos. But gradually this whole resounding house full of dancing halls became for me, this intoxicated people of masks into a crazy dream paradise, blossom after blossom wooed with their fragrance, fruit after fruit I played around with testing fingers, snakes looked at me seductively from the green shade of leaves, lotus blossoms haunted the black swamp, magic birds lured in the branches, and everything led me to a longed-for goal, everything recharged me with longing for the only one. Once I danced with an unknown girl, glowing, wooing, I swept her into a frenzy and intoxication, and while we were floating in the unreal she said, suddenly laughing: ""One doesn't recognize you again. You were so dumb and dull tonight.' And I recognized the one who had said 'old grumpy' to me hours ago. Now she thought she had me, but in the next dance it was another dance that made me glow. I danced non-stop for two hours or more, any dance, including dances I had never learned. Hermann, the smiling young man, kept appearing near me, nodded at me, and disappeared into the crowd.","We sat and talked and drank champagne. We strolled through the rooms and looked about us. We went on voyages of exploration to discover couples whose love-making it amused us to spy upon. She pointed out women whom she recommended me to dance with, and gave me advice as to the methods of attack to be employed with each. We took the floor as rivals and paid court for a while to the same girl, danced with her by turns and both tried to win her heart. And yet it was all only a carnival, only a game between the two of us that caught us more closely together in our own passion. It was all a fairy tale. Everything had a new dimension, a deeper meaning. Everything was fanciful and symbolic. There was one girl of great beauty but looking tragic and unhappy. Herman danced with her and drew her out. They disappeared to drink champagne together, and she told me afterwards that she had made a conquest of her not as a man but as a woman, with the spell of Lesbos. For my part, the whole building reverberated everywhere with the sound of dancing, and the whole intoxicated crowd of masks, became by degrees a wild dream of paradise. Flower upon flower wooed me with its scent. I toyed with fruit after fruit. Serpents looked at me from green and leafy shadows with mesmeric eyes. Lotus blossoms luxuriated over black bogs. Enchanted birds sang allurement from the trees. Yet all was a progress to one longed-for goal, the summons of a new yearning for one and one only. Once I was dancing with a girl I did not know. I had swept her with the ardor of a lover into the giddy swirl of dancers and while we hung in this unreal world, she suddenly remarked with a laugh: ""One wouldn't know you. You were so dull and flat before."" Then I recognized the girl who had called me ""Old Growler"" a few hours before. She thought she had got me now, but with the next dance it was another for whom my ardor glowed. I danced without ceasing for two hours or more—every dance and some, even, that I had never danced before. Every now and then Herman was near me, and gave me a nod and a smile as he disappeared in the throng.","We sat chatting and drinking champagne. We sauntered through the ballrooms, observing the goings-on like adventurous explorers, eavesdropping on the lovemaking of couples we had singled out. Pointing out women she wanted me to dance with, Hermione gave me tips as to how I might best win over this one or that. We acted as rivals, both on the trail of the same woman for a while, both dancing with her in turn, both attempting to win her. Yet all this was just a masquerade, a game between the two of us, binding us more closely together, kindling the fire of our passion for one another. It was all a fairy-tale experience, made richer by an additional dimension, deeper by an additional layer of meaning. Everything was make-believe, symbolic. We saw a very beautiful young woman who looked slightly ailing and out of sorts. ‘ Hermann’ danced with her, restoring some colour to her cheeks, after which the two of them disappeared into an alcove where sparkling wine was on offer. She told me afterwards that she had conquered her as a woman by the magic charms of Lesbos, not as a man. For me, on the other hand, the whole building, ringing with music and full of rooms echoing to the sound of dancing by intoxicated crowds of masked revellers, was gradually turning into a wonderland, the paradise of my dreams. Blossom upon blossom lured me with its fragrance, my fingers reached out tentatively to fondle fruit upon fruit, serpents eyed me seductively from the shade of green foliage, lotus blossom drifted eerily across a black swamp, magic birds were singing their enticing songs in the branches of the trees. Yet all of this was leading the way to one destination, making my heart heavy with fresh yearning for the one and only woman I desired. At one point I was dancing passionately with a girl I didn’t know, making a play for her, sweeping her along in a heady whirl when all at once, as we were floating on a cloud of unreality, she burst out laughing and said: ‘You’ve changed out of all recognition! Earlier tonight you were such a stupid bore.’ Then I recognized her as the one who, hours ago, had called me a ‘sulky old so-and-so’. Now she thought I was hers, but come the next dance it was another I was holding passionately close. I danced for two hours or more without letting up, each and every dance, even those I hadn’t learned. Again and again Hermann, the smiling youth, would pop up near to me and give me a nod before disappearing from view in the milling crowd."

"Das alte Stadtviertel nahm mich auf, erloschen und unwirklich stand im Grau die kleine Kirche. Plötzlich fiel mir das Erlebnis vom Abend wieder ein, mit der rätselhaften Spitzbogentür, mit der rätselhaften Tafel darüber, mit den spöttisch tanzenden Lichtbuchstaben. Wie hatten ihre Inschriften gelautet? »Eintritt nicht für jedermann.« Und: »Nur für Verrückte.« Prüfend blickte ich zu der alten Mauer hinüber, heimlich wünschend, der Zauber möge wieder beginnen, die Inschrift mich Verrückten einladen, das kleine Tor mich einlassen. Dort vielleicht war das, was ich begehrte, dort vielleicht würde meine Musik gespielt?","The old part of town took me in, the little church stood out in the gray, dead and unreal. Suddenly the experience of the evening came back to me, with the enigmatic pointed arch door, with the enigmatic panel above it, with the mockingly dancing light letters. What had their inscriptions read? ""Admission not for everyone."" And: ""Only for madmen."" I scrutinized the old wall, secretly wishing the magic could begin again, the inscription invite me madman, the little gate let me in. Maybe that's where what I desired was, maybe that's where my music would be played?","I was now in the old quarter of the town. The little church stood up dim and grey and unreal. At once the experience of the evening came back to me, the mysterious Gothic doorway, the mysterious tablet above it and the illuminated letters dancing in mockery. How did the writing run? ""Entrance not for Everybody."" And: ""For madmen only. "" I scrutinised the old wall opposite in the secret hope that the magic night might begin again; the writing invite me, the madman; the little doorway give me admittance. There perhaps lay my desire, and there perhaps would my music be played.","By now I was back in the fold of the city’s old quarter. Its lights extinguished, the little church stood there in the greyness, looking unreal. Suddenly I recalled what I had experienced earlier that evening: the mysterious Gothic doorway and the mysterious sign above it, mocking me with its flickering neon letters. What message had they spelled out? ‘Admission not for everybody.’ And: ‘For mad people only.’ I stared intently across at the old wall, secretly wishing that the magic might start afresh, the written invitation might be meant for the madman that was me, and I might be allowed through the little portal. Perhaps I would find what I was yearning for there; there, perhaps, they were playing my music."
"Bei unsrem Steppenwolfe nun war es so, daß er in seinem Gefühl zwar bald als Wolf, bald als Mensch lebte, wie es bei allen Mischwesen der Fall ist, daß aber, wenn er Wolf war, der Mensch in ihm stets zuschauend, urteilend und richtend auf der Lauer lag – und in den Zeiten, wo er Mensch war, tat der Wolf ebenso. Zum Beispiel, wenn Harry als Mensch einen schönen Gedanken hatte, eine feine, edle Empfindung fühlte oder eine sogenannte gute Tat verrichtete, dann bleckte der Wolf in ihm die Zähne und lachte und zeigte ihm mit blutigem Hohn, wie lächerlich dieses ganze edle Theater einem Steppentier zu Gesicht stehe, einem Wolf, der ja in seinem Herzen ganz genau darüber Bescheid wußte, was ihm behage, nämlich einsam durch Steppen zu traben, zuzeiten Blut zu saufen oder eine Wölfin zu jagen – und, vom Wolf aus gesehen, wurde dann jede menschliche Handlung schauerlich komisch und verlegen, dumm und eitel. Aber ganz ebenso war es, wenn Harry sich als Wolf fühlte und benahm, wenn er andern die Zähne zeigte, wenn er Haß und Todfeindschaft gegen alle Menschen und ihre verlogenen und entarteten Manieren und Sitten fühlte. Dann nämlich lag das Menschenteil in ihm auf der Lauer, beobachtete den Wolf, nannte ihn Vieh und Bestie und verdarb und vergällte ihm alle Freude an seinem einfachen, gesunden und wilden Wolfswesen.","With our Steppenwolf it was the case that in his feelings he lived sometimes as a wolf, sometimes as a man, as is the case with all mixed creatures, but that when he was a wolf, the man in him was always watching, judging and judging lying in wait - and in the times when he was man, so did the wolf. For example, when Harry as a human had a beautiful thought, felt a fine, noble sensation, or performed a so-called good deed, the wolf in him bared his teeth and laughed and showed him with bloody scorn how ridiculous all this noble theater was for a steppe animal stand face to face with a wolf who, in his heart, knew exactly what he liked, namely trotting alone through steppes, drinking blood from time to time or chasing a she-wolf - and from the wolf's point of view, every one became human Action terribly funny and embarrassed, stupid and vain. But it was just the same when Harry felt and behaved like a wolf, when he bared his teeth at others, when he felt hatred and mortal hostility towards all people and their lying and degenerate manners and customs. Then the human part in him lay in wait, watched the wolf, called him cattle and beast and spoiled and galled all his joy in his simple, healthy and wild wolf nature.","Now with our Steppenwolf it was so that in his conscious life he lived now as a wolf, now as a man, as indeed the case is with all mixed beings. But, when he was a wolf, the man in him lay in ambush, ever on the watch to interfere and condemn, while at those times that he was a man the wolf did just the same. For example, if Harry, as man, had a beautiful thought, felt a fine and noble emotion, or performed a so-called good act, then the wolf bared his teeth at him and laughed and showed him with bitter scorn how laughable this whole pantomime was in the eyes of a beast, of a wolf who knew well enough in his heart what suited him, namely, to trot alone over the Steppes and now and then to gorge himself with blood or to pursue a female wolf. Then, wolfishly seen, all human activities became horribly absurd and misplaced, stupid and vain. But it was exactly the same when Harry felt and behaved as a wolf and showed others his teeth and felt hatred and enmity against all human beings and their lying and degenerate manners and customs. For then the human part of him lay in ambush and watched the wolf, called him brute and beast, and spoiled and embittered for him all pleasure in his simple and healthy and wild wolf's being.","In Steppenwolf’s case, the fact is that, like all hybrid creatures, he lived with the feeling of being sometimes a wolf, sometimes a human being. However, as a wolf he was forever conscious of his human side lying in wait, observing, judging and condemning him; just as the wolf did when he was a human being. For example, whenever Harry in his capacity as human being had some lovely idea, experienced some fine and noble sentiment, or did a so-called good deed, the wolf in him would bare its teeth and laugh him utterly to scorn, indicating how ludicrously out of character all this fine play-acting was in a wild animal of the steppes, a wolf who at heart knew perfectly well that his real pleasure lay in stalking alone across the plains, occasionally quaffing blood or pursuing a she-wolf. Seen thus from the wolf’s point of view, every human action became frighteningly comic and self-conscious, vain and inane. But it was exactly the same when Harry felt and behaved like a wolf, when he showed other people his teeth or became murderously hostile to humankind as a whole, hating all its hypocritical and degenerate manners and customs. For then it was the human side of him that lay in wait, observing the wolf, calling him a brute and a beast, spoiling and souring all the pleasure he was taking in the straight-forward life of a healthy untamed wolf."
"Lachend gab Gustav Antwort: »Junge, du redest wunderbar klug, es ist eine Freude und bringt Gewinn, diesem Weisheitsborn zu lauschen. Und vielleicht hast du sogar ein bißchen recht.

Es gibt nicht bloß die, die im Augenblick gerade gespielt wird, sondern auch unsterbliche, die weiterlebt, auch wenn sie nicht gerade gespielt wird. Es kann jemand allein in seinem Bett liegen und in seinen Gedanken eine Melodie aus der Zauberflöte oder aus der Matthäuspassion erwecken, dann findet Musik statt, ohne daß ein einziger Mensch in eine Flöte bläst oder eine Geige streicht.«","'Very good, Mr Pablo. But there is not only sensual music, there is also spiritual music. There is not only the one that is being played at the moment, but also immortal ones that live on even when not being played. Someone can lie alone in his bed and wake up a melody from the Magic Flute or from the St. Matthew Passion in his thoughts, then music will take place without a single person blowing a flute or bowing a violin.«","""Very good, Herr Pablo. But there is not only sensual music. There is spiritual also. Besides the music that is actually played at the moment, there is the immortal music that lives on even when it is not actually being played. It can happen to a man to lie alone in bed and to call to mind a melody from the Magic Flute or the Matthew Passion, and then there is music without anybody blowing into a flute or passing a bow across a fiddle.""","‘All very well, Herr Pablo, but music aimed at the senses isn’t the only kind. There’s music of the spirit and mind too. Nor is there only the music that people just happen to be playing at a given moment. There’s also immortal music, music that lives on even though it’s not currently being played. It’s possible for people lying alone in bed to bring back to life a tune from the Magic Flute or the Matthew Passion in their heads. Then you have music taking place without a soul blowing on a flute or bowing a violin.’"
"»Hermine«, rief ich zärtlich, »Schwester, wie gute Augen du hast! Und doch hast du mich den Foxtrott gelehrt! Aber wie meinst du das: daß Menschen wie wir, Menschen mit einer Dimension zuviel, hier nicht leben können? An was liegt das? Ist das nur in unsrer heutigen Zeit so? Oder war das immer?«","""Hermione,"" I called tenderly, ""sister, how good your eyes are! And yet you taught me the foxtrot! But what do you mean by that: that people like us, people with one dimension too many, can't live here? What is it? Is that only the case today? Or was it always?”","""Hermine,"" I cried tenderly, ""sister, how clearly you see! And yet you taught me the fox trot! But how do you mean that people like us with a dimension too many cannot live here? What brings it about? Is it only so in our days, or was it so always?""","‘Hermione!’ I exclaimed lovingly. ‘ How well you see things, dear sister! And yet you taught me the foxtrot!

Is it only true of the present day, or was it always the case?’"
"»Ist heute keine Abendunterhaltung?« fragte ich und versuchte ihm zuzublinzeln, so wie Mitwisser von Geheimnissen es untereinander tun. Aber es war allzu lange her, seit solche mimische Übungen mir geläufig waren, hatte ich bei meiner Lebensweise doch beinahe das Sprechen verlernt; ich fühlte selbst, daß ich nur eine dumme Grimasse schneide.","""Isn't there any evening entertainment tonight?"" I asked, trying to wink at him the way people who share secrets do to each other. But it was all too long since I was familiar with such mimic exercises, given my way of life I had almost forgotten how to speak; I felt myself that I was only making a stupid grimace.","""Is there no show tonight?"" I asked with an attempt at a wink such as two conspirators give each other. But it was long ago that such pantomime was familiar to me. Indeed, living as I did, I had almost lost the habit of speech, and I felt myself that I only made a silly grimace.","‘Is there no show tonight?’ I asked, attempting to give him a wink, as people who are in on some secret do. However, the time when such knowing facial expressions came naturally to me was all too long past. After all, I had almost forgotten how to speak, so secluded a life did I lead. I myself sensed that I only managed a stupid grimace."
"stand da geschrieben. Schnell aufzuckend leuchtete ein Erinnerungsbild in mir, eine Sekunde lang: Hermine, am Tisch eines Restaurants, plötzlich von Wein und Speisen weg in ein abgründiges Gespräch verloren, furchtbaren Ernst im Blick, wie sie mir sagte, daß sie mich nur darum in sich verliebt machen werde, um von meiner Hand getötet zu werden. Eine schwere Woge von Angst und Dunkelheit flutete über mein Herz, plötzlich stand wieder alles vor mir, plötzlich spürte ich im Innersten wieder Not und Schicksal. Verzweifelnd griff ich in meine Tasche, um die Figuren hervorzulangen, um ein wenig Magie zu treiben und die Ordnung meines Schachbretts umzustellen. Es waren keine Figuren mehr da. Statt der Figuren zog ich ein Messer aus der Tasche. Zu Tode erschrocken lief ich durch den Korridor, an den Türen vorbei, stand plötzlich dem riesigen Spiegel gegenüber, blickte hinein. Im Spiegel stand, hoch wie ich, ein riesiger schöner Wolf, stand still, blitzte scheu aus unruhigen Augen. Flackernd blinzelte er mich an, lachte ein wenig, daß die Lefzen sich einen Augenblick trennten und die rote Zunge zu sehen war. Wo war Pablo? Wo war Hermine? Wo war der kluge Kerl, der so hübsch vom Aufbau der Persönlichkeit geschwatzt hatte?","was written there. A quick flash of memory lit up in me, for a second: Hermione, at a restaurant table, suddenly lost from wine and food in an abysmal conversation, terribly serious in her eyes, telling me that's the only reason they make me fall in love with her to be slain by my hand. A heavy wave of fear and darkness swept over my heart, suddenly everything was before me again, suddenly I felt misery and destiny again in my innermost being. Desperately, I reached into my pocket to get out the pieces, to do some magic and rearrange my chessboard. There were no more figures. Instead of the figures, I pulled a knife out of my pocket. Scared to death, I ran through the corridor, past the doors, suddenly faced the huge mirror, looked into it. In the mirror stood a huge, beautiful wolf, tall as I was, standing still, shyly flashing restless eyes. He flickered his eyes at me, laughed a little so that his lips parted for a moment and his red tongue showed. Where was Pablo? Where was Hermione? Where was the smart fellow who had babbled so nicely on personality building?","was what it said. Swiftly a picture was flashed upon my memory with a jerk and remained there one instant. Hermine at the table of a restaurant, turning all at once from the wine and food, lost in an abyss of speech, with a terrifying earnestness in her face as she said that she would have one aim only in making me her lover, and it was that she should die by my hand. A heavy wave of anguish and darkness flooded my heart. Suddenly everything confronted me once more. Suddenly once more the sense of the last call of fate gripped my heart. Desperately I felt in my pocket for the little figures so that I might practise a little magic and rearrange the layout of the board. The figures were no longer there. Instead of them I pulled out a knife. In mortal dread I ran along the corridor, past every door. I stood opposite the gigantic mirror. I looked into it. In the mirror there stood a beautiful wolf as tall as myself. He stood still, glancing shyly from unquiet eyes. As he leered at me, his eyes blazed and he grinned a little so that his chops parted and showed his red tongue. Where was Pablo? Where was Hermine? Where was that clever fellow who had discoursed so pleasantly about the building up of the personality?","I had a rapid flash of memory, lasting no more than a second. It was of Hermione at a restaurant table. Looking frighteningly serious, the food and wine forgotten, she was absorbed in profound conversation, telling me that she would make me fall in love with her only so that she could die by my hand. I felt a heavy wave of fear and gloom surge across my heart. Everything was suddenly confronting me again. Suddenly, deep down inside me, I could again sense fate pressing in on me. In my despair I felt for the figures in my pocket, meaning to take them out and work a little magic by rearranging them on my chessboard. But the figures had gone. Instead, what I took from my pocket was a knife. Frightened to death, I ran along the corridor, past all the doors, and suddenly found myself in front of the gigantic mirror. Looking into it, I saw a huge, handsome wolf, as tall as me. It was standing there motionless, its nervous, restless eyes flashing. Then, one eye glinting, it winked at me and laughed a little, its lips parting for an instant to reveal a red tongue. Where was Pablo? Where was Hermione? What had become of that clever chap with all his fine talk of reconstructing one’s personality?"

"Einmal traf ich ihn auf der Straße, am Kai, und er schloß sich mir ohne weiteres an.

This time I finally managed to get him to speak.",One day I met him in the street near the quay and he turned at once to accompany me.

"»Na, sehen wir erst mal nach dem alten Herrn«, sagte Gustav und wandte sich dem Passagier zu, der noch immer hinter dem toten Chauffeur im Sitze hing. Es war ein Herr mit kurzen grauen Haaren, er hatte die klugen hellgrauen Augen offen, schien aber tüchtig verletzt zu sein, wenigstens floß ihm Blut aus dem Munde, und den Hals hielt er unheimlich schief und steif. »Erlauben Sie, alter Herr, mein Name ist Gustav. Wir haben uns gestattet, Ihren Chauffeur zu erschießen. Dürfen wir fragen, mit wem wir die Ehre haben?«","""Well, let's see the old gentleman first,"" said Gustav and turned to the passenger, who was still hanging in the seat behind the dead driver. It was a gentleman with short gray hair, his clever, light gray eyes were open, but he seemed badly injured, at least blood was flowing from his mouth, and he was holding his neck terribly crooked and stiff. “Allow me, old gentleman, my name is Gustav. We took the liberty of shooting your chauffeur. May we ask with whom we have the honor?'","""Well, first let us look after the old boy,"" said Gustav and turned to the occupant of the car who still clung to his seat behind the chauffeur. He was a gentleman with short grey hair. His intelligent, clear gray eyes were open, but he seemed to be seriously hurt; at least, blood flowed from his mouth and he held his neck askew and rigid. ""Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Gustav. We have taken the liberty of shooting your chauffeur. May we inquire whom we have the honor to address?""","‘Come on, we might as well check on the old gentleman first,’ Gustav said, turning towards the passenger who was still stuck there in his seat behind the dead chauffeur. He had short grey hair and intelligent, light-grey eyes that were open, even though, to judge from the blood flowing from his mouth and the worryingly stiff and crooked look of his neck, he seemed to be very badly injured. ‘Allow me to introduce myself, Sir, my name is Gustav,’ said my companion, addressing the old gentleman. ‘We’ve taken the liberty of shooting your chauffeur. May I ask with whom we have the pleasure of speaking?’"
"»Herr Pablo«, sagte ich zu ihm, der mit einem dünnen schwarz und silbernen Stöckchen spielte, »Sie sind ein Freund von Hermine, dies ist der Grund, weshalb ich mich für Sie interessiere. Aber Sie machen mir, das muß ich sagen, die Unterhaltung nicht eben leicht. Ich habe mehrmals den Versuch gemacht, mit Ihnen über Musik zu sprechen – es hätte mich interessiert, Ihre Meinung, Ihren Widerspruch, Ihr Urteil zu hören; aber Sie haben es verschmäht, mir auch nur die geringste Antwort zu geben.«","""Mr. Pablo,"" I said to him, who was playing with a thin black and silver baton, ""you are a friend of Hermione's, that is why I am interested in you. But I have to say you don't make conversation easy for me. I've tried several times to talk to you about music - I would have been interested to hear your opinion, your objection, your judgement; but you have scorned to give me even the slightest answer.”","""Herr Pablo,"" I said to him as he played with his slender ebony and silver walking stick, ""you are a friend of Hermine's and that is why I take an interest in you. But I can't say you make it easy to get on with you. Several times I have attempted to talk about music with you. It would have interested me to know your thoughts and opinions, whether they contradicted mine or not, but you have disdained to make me even the barest reply.""","‘Herr Pablo,’ I said to him, as he toyed with a slender little ebony-and-silver cane, ‘you are a friend of Hermione, which is why I am interested in you. But I have to say that you don’t exactly make it easy for me to hold a conversation with you. I have tried several times to talk about music with you because it would have interested me to hear your opinion, your judgement or whatever counter-arguments you may have, but you never deigned to reply to me, even in the slightest way.’"

"Wo waren wir? Schlief ich? War ich zu Hause? Saß ich in einem Auto und fuhr? Nein, ich saß im blau erleuchteten runden Raum, in einer verdünnten Luft, in einer Schicht von sehr undicht gewordener Wirklichkeit. Warum war denn Hermine so bleich? Warum sprach Pablo so viel? War nicht vielleicht ich es, der ihn sprechen machte, der aus ihm sprach? Blickte nicht auch aus seinen schwarzen Augen nur meine eigene Seele mich an, der verlorne bange Vogel, ebenso wie aus den grauen Augen Herminens?","Where were we? did i sleep I was at home? Did I sit in a car and drive? No, I sat in the blue-lit round room, in a rarefied air, in a layer of reality that had become very leaky. Why was Hermione so pale? Why did Pablo talk so much? Wasn't it perhaps I who made him speak, who spoke out of him? Didn't my own soul only look at me, the lost, anxious bird, out of its black eyes, just as it did out of Hermione's gray eyes?","Where were we? Was I asleep? Was I at home? Was I driving in a car? No, I was sitting in a blue light in a round room and a rare atmosphere, in a stratum of reality that had become rarefied in the extreme. Why then was Hermine so white? Why was Pablo talking so much? Was it not perhaps I who made him talk, spoke, indeed, with his voice? Was it not, too, my own soul that contemplated me out of his black eyes like a lost and frightened bird, just as it had out of Hermine's gray ones?","Where were we? Was I sleeping? Was I at home? Was I sitting in a car, going somewhere? No, I was sitting in the blue light of a round room, where the air was thin and reality too, having lost much of its density, was just a thin veneer. Why was Hermione so pale? Why was Pablo doing so much talking? Could it be that I was making him talk? Was it my own voice emerging from him? Was it not my own soul, that frightened, lost bird, I could see mirrored in his dark eyes, just as I had in the grey eyes of Hermione?"
"Zurück führt überhaupt kein Weg, nicht zum Wolf, noch zum Kind. Am Anfang der Dinge ist nicht Unschuld und Einfalt; alles Erschaffene, auch das scheinbar Einfachste, ist schon schuldig, ist schon vielspältig, ist in den schmutzigen Strom des Werdens geworfen und kann nie mehr, nie mehr stromaufwärts schwimmen. Der Weg in die Unschuld, ins Unerschaffene, zu Gott führt nicht zurück, sondern vorwärts, nicht zum Wolf oder Kind, sondern immer weiter in die Schuld, immer tiefer in die Menschwerdung hinein. Auch mit dem Selbstmord wird dir, armer Steppenwolf, nicht ernstlich gedient sein, du wirst schon den längeren, den mühevolleren und schwereren Weg der Menschwerdung gehen, du wirst deine Zweiheit noch oft vervielfachen, deine Kompliziertheit noch viel weiter komplizieren müssen. Statt deine Welt zu verengen, deine Seele zu vereinfachen, wirst du immer mehr Welt, wirst schließlich die ganze Welt in deine schmerzlich erweiterte Seele aufnehmen müssen, um vielleicht einmal zum Ende, zur Ruhe zu kommen. Diesen Weg ist Buddha, ist jeder große Mensch gegangen, der eine wissend, der andre unbewußt, soweit ihm eben das Wagnis glückte. Jede Geburt bedeutet Trennung vom All, bedeutet Umgrenzung, Absonderung von Gott, leidvolle Neuwerdung. Rückkehr ins All, Aufhebung der leidvollen Individuation, Gottwerden bedeutet: seine Seele so erweitert haben, daß sie das All wieder zu umfassen vermag.","There is no way back at all, neither to the wolf nor to the child. At the beginning of things there is not innocence and simplicity; everything created, even the seemingly simplest, is already guilty, is already multifaceted, has been thrown into the dirty stream of becoming and can never, never swim upstream again. The path to innocence, to the uncreated, to God does not lead back, but forwards, not to the wolf or child, but ever further into guilt, ever deeper into the incarnation. Even suicide will not do you any serious good, poor Steppenwolf, you will have to take the longer, more laborious and difficult path to becoming a human being, you will often have to multiply your duality, complicate your complexity even further. Instead of narrowing your world, simplifying your soul, you will become more and more world, you will eventually have to absorb the whole world into your painfully expanded soul in order to perhaps come to an end, to come to rest. Buddha, and every great human being, has walked this path, some knowingly, others unconsciously, as far as the venture was successful. Every birth means separation from the universe, means demarcation, separation from God, painful regeneration. Return to space, abolition of the painful individuation, becoming God means: having expanded one's soul in such a way that it is again able to encompass the universe.","There is, in fact, no way back either to the wolf or to the child. From the very start there is no innocence and no singleness. Every created thing, even the simplest, is already guilty, already multiple. It has been thrown into the muddy stream of being and may never more swim back again to its source. The way to innocence, to the uncreated and to God leads on, not back, not back to the wolf or to the child, but ever further into sin, ever deeper into human life. Nor will suicide really solve your problem, unhappy Steppenwolf. You will, instead, embark on the longer and wearier and harder road of life. You will have to multiply many times your two-fold being and complicate your complexities still further. Instead of narrowing your world and simplifying your soul, you will have to absorb more and more of the world and at last take all of it up in your painfully expanded soul, if you are ever to find peace. This is the road that Buddha and every great man has gone, whether consciously or not, insofar as fortune favored his quest. All births mean separation from the All, the confinement within limitation, the separation from God, the pangs of being born ever anew. The return into the All, the dissolution of painful individuation, the reunion with God means the expansion of the soul until it is able once more to embrace the All.","There is no way back at all, either to the wolf or the child. Things do not begin in innocence and simplicity; all created beings, even the ostensibly simplest, are already guilty, already full of contradictions. Cast into the muddy stream of becoming they can never, never hope to swim back up against the current. The road to innocence, to the state before creation, to God, doesn’t run backwards, either to the wolf or the child, but forwards, further and further into guilt, deeper and deeper into the experience of becoming fully human. Nor is suicide, poor Steppenwolf, a serious solution to your problem. You will just have to go down the longer, more onerous, more difficult road to becoming truly human. You will frequently have to multiply your two selves, make your already complex nature a great deal more complicated. Instead of making your world more confined and your soul simpler you are going to have to include more and more world, ultimately the entire world in your soul as it painfully expands, until one day, perhaps, you reach the end and find rest. This, in so far as they succeeded in the venture, is the path taken by Buddha, by all great human beings, some knowingly, others unconsciously. Every birth entails separation from the cosmos, enclosure within limits, isolation from God, painful self-renewal. Returning to the cosmos, overcoming the painful experience of individuation, achieving God-like status: all these entail an expansion of the soul to the point where it is once again able to contain the whole cosmos within itself."

"Nach dem Konzert sah ich ihn auf der Straße wieder und ging hinter ihm her; in seinen Mantel verkrochen schritt er unlustig und müde in der Richtung nach unsrem Viertel davon, vor einem kleinen altmodischen Wirtshaus aber blieb er stehen, sah unschlüssig auf die Uhr und ging dann hinein. Ich folgte einem augenblicklichen Gelüste und ging ihm nach. Da saß er an einem kleinbürgerlichen Wirtstisch, Wirtin und Kellnerin begrüßten ihn als bekannten Gast, und ich grüßte und setzte mich zu ihm. Eine Stunde saßen wir dort, und während ich zwei Gläser Mineralwasser trank, ließ er sich einen halben und dann noch einen viertel Liter Rotwein geben. Ich sagte, daß ich im Konzert gewesen sei, aber er ging nicht darauf ein. Er las die Etikette meiner Wasserflasche und fragte, ob ich keinen Wein trinken wolle, zu dem er mich einlade. Als er hörte, daß ich nie Wein trinke, machte er wieder sein hilfloses Gesicht und sagte: »Ja, da haben Sie recht. Ich habe auch jahrelang enthaltsam gelebt und auch lange Zeiten gefastet, aber zur Zeit stehe ich wieder im Zeichen des Wassermanns, einem dunklen und feuchten Zeichen.«","After the concert I saw him again in the street and followed him; Creeping into his coat, he strode away wearily and wearily in the direction of our quarter, but he stopped in front of a small, old-fashioned inn, looked hesitantly at his watch, and then went inside. I followed a momentary craving and went after it. There he was sitting at a lower-class innkeeper's table, the landlady and waitress greeted him as a familiar guest, and I said hello and sat down next to him. We sat there for an hour, and while I drank two glasses of mineral water, he asked for half a liter and then another quarter liter of red wine. I said I had been to the concert but he didn't comment. He read the label on my water bottle and asked if I didn't want to drink some wine, which he invited me to. When he heard that I never drink wine, he made his helpless face again and said: 'Yes, you are right. I have also been celibate for years and fasted for long periods, but at the moment I am back in Aquarius, a dark and wet sign.”","I saw him again after the concert in the street and walked along behind him. Wrapped in his cloak he went his way joylessly and wearily in the direction of our quarter, but stopped in front of a small old-fashioned inn, and after looking irresolutely at the time, went in. I obeyed a momentary impulse and followed him; and there he sat at a table in the backroom of the bar, greeted by hostess and waitress as a well-known guest. Greeting him, too, I took my seat beside him. We sat there for an hour, and while I drank two glasses of mineral water, he accounted for a pint of red wine and then called for another half. I remarked that I had been to the concert, but he did not follow up this topic. He read the label on my bottle and asked whether I would not drink some wine. When I declined his offer and said that I never drank it, the old helpless expression came over his face. ""You're quite right there,"" he said. ""I have practised abstinence myself for years, and had my time of fasting, too, but now I find myself once more beneath the sign of Aquarius, a dark and humid constellation.""","After the concert I spotted him again in the street and followed in his footsteps. Hunched up in his coat, he was making his way tiredly and listlessly back towards our district of town.

There he was, sitting at the bar of this petit bourgeois establishment, being greeted by landlady and waitress as a familiar customer. I said hello to him too, joining him at the bar. We sat there for an hour, during which I drank two glasses of mineral water while he ordered half a litre of red wine, followed by another quarter. I told him I had been at the concert, but he didn’t pursue the topic. Reading the label on my water bottle, he asked whether I wouldn’t care for some wine too. It was on him, he said. When he heard that I never drink wine, his face again assumed a vacant expression and he said: ‘I suppose you are right not to. For years I too lived abstemiously, even fasting for long periods, but at the moment I’m again under the sign of Aquarius, a dark and damp sign of the zodiac.’"

Bei diesen Menschen lebte eben der Mensch und der Fuchs, der Mensch und der Fisch nebeneinander her, und keiner tat dem andern weh, einer half sogar dem andern, und in manchem Manne, der es weit gebracht hat und beneidet wird, war es mehr der Fuchs oder Affe als der Mensch, der sein Glück gemacht hat. Dies ist ja jedermann bekannt. Bei Harry hingegen war es anders, in ihm liefen Mensch und Wolf nicht nebeneinander her, und noch viel weniger halfen sie einander, sondern sie lagen in ständiger Todfeindschaft gegeneinander, und einer lebte dem andern lediglich zu Leide, und wenn Zwei in Einem Blut und Einer Seele miteinander todfeind sind, dann ist das ein übles Leben. Nun, jeder hat sein Los, und leicht ist keines.","So the Steppenwolf had two natures, one human and one wolfish, this was his fate, and it may well be that this fate was not so special and rare. Many people are said to have been seen who had a great deal of dog or fox, fish or snake in them without having any particular difficulties. With these people, man and fox, man and fish lived side by side, and neither hurt the other, one even helped the other, and in many a man who has come a long way and is envied, it was more the Fox or monkey as the man who made his fortune. Everyone knows this. With Harry, on the other hand, it was different, in him man and wolf did not run side by side, and even less did they help each other, but they were in constant mortal enmity against each other, and one only lived to the suffering of the other, and if two in one blood and one souls are mortal enemies with each other, then that is a bad life. Well, everyone has their lot, and none is easy.","And so the Steppenwolf had two natures, a human and a wolfish one. This was his fate, and it may well be that it was not a very exceptional one. There must have been many men who have had a good deal of the dog or the fox, of the fish or the serpent in them without experiencing any extraordinary difficulties on that account. In such cases, the man and the fish lived on together and neither did the other any harm. The one even helped the other. Many a man indeed has carried this condition to such enviable lengths that he has owed his happiness more to the fox or the ape in him than to the man. So much for common knowledge. In the case of Harry, however, it was just the opposite. In him the man and the wolf did not go the same way together, but were in continual and deadly enmity. One existed simply and solely to harm the other, and when there are two in one blood and in one soul who are at deadly enmity, then life fares ill. Well, to each his lot, and none is light.","Steppenwolf’s nature was thus twofold, partly human, partly wolfish. This was his fate, and it may well be that such a fate was nothing special or unusual. There have been quite a number of reported sightings of human beings with a great deal of the dog or fox, the fish or snake in their make-up, yet they had no special difficulties on that account. In their cases, the human being and the fox, or the human being and the fish simply coexisted without either of them harming the other. The one was even of help to the other, as can be seen from many an instance of men who are envied because of their great success in life. They owe their good fortune more to the fox or the monkey in them than to the human being. This is of course common knowledge. Harry’s case, on the other hand, was different. In him the human being and the wolf went their own separate ways. Far from helping one another, they were like mortal enemies in constant conflict, each causing the other nothing but grief. When two mortal enemies are locked in one mind and body, life is a miserable business. Well, to each his lot. None of us has it easy."
"Vom Tanzen hatte ich so viel gelernt, daß es mir nun möglich schien, den Ball mitzumachen, von dem mit jedem Tage mehr die Rede war. Hermine hatte ein Geheimnis, sie blieb fest dabei, mir nicht zu verraten, in welcher Maskentracht sie erscheinen werde. Ich werde sie schon erkennen, meinte sie, und sollte ich es daran fehlen lassen, so werde sie mir helfen, aber vorher dürfe ich nichts wissen. So war sie auch gar nicht neugierig auf meine Maskenpläne, und ich beschloß, mich gar nicht zu kostümieren. Maria, als ich sie zum Ball einladen wollte, erklärte mir, daß sie für dies Fest schon einen Kavalier habe, besaß auch wirklich schon eine Eintrittskarte, und ich sah etwas enttäuscht, daß ich das Fest nun allein werde besuchen müssen. Es war der vornehmste Kostümball der Stadt, der alljährlich in den Globussälen von der Künstlerschaft veranstaltet wurde.","I had learned so much from dancing that it now seemed possible for me to go to the ball, which was being talked about more and more every day. Hermione had a secret, she was adamant not to tell me what masquerade she was going to appear in. I'll recognize her, she said, and if I fail to do so, she'll help me, but I mustn't know anything before then. So she wasn't at all curious about my make-up plans, and I decided not to dress up at all. Maria, when I wanted to invite her to the ball, explained to me that she already had a gentleman for the party, actually had a ticket, and I was a little disappointed that I would now have to go to the party alone. It was the city's finest costume ball, which was organized annually by artists in the Globus Halls.","I was now so proficient in dancing that I felt quite equal to playing my part at the Ball of which everybody was talking. Hermine had a secret. She took the greatest care not to let out what her costume was to be. I would recognize her soon enough, she said, and should I fail to do so, she would help me; but beforehand I was to know nothing. She was not in the least inquisitive to know my plans for a fancy dress and I decided that I should not wear a costume at all. Maria, when I asked her to go with me as my partner, explained that she had a cavalier already and a ticket too, in fact; and I saw with some disappointment that I should have to attend the festivity alone. It was the principal Fancy Dress Ball of the town, organized yearly by the Society of Artists in the Globe Rooms.","By now I had learned enough in my dancing lessons to feel that it would be feasible for me to attend the ball, which was being talked about more and more with every day that went by. Hermione’s costume remained a secret. She was absolutely determined not to tell me what she would be going as. I was not to worry, she said. I would recognize her, and failing that she would help me out, but I was not allowed to know anything in advance. Nor, for this reason, was she the least bit curious about what I was planning to wear, so I decided not to dress up at all. Maria, when I wanted to invite her to the ball, explained that she already had a partner for the occasion. And since she did indeed have a ticket already, I realized to my disappointment that I would have to attend the ball on my own. The most exclusive of all the city’s masked balls, it was put on annually in the Globe Rooms by the Society of Artists."
"»Du, vergiß nicht, was du zu mir gesagt hast! Du hast gesagt, ich solle dir befehlen, und es würde dir eine Freude sein, allen meinen Befehlen zu gehorchen. Vergiß das nicht! Du mußt wissen, kleiner Harry: so, wie es dir mit mir geht, daß mein Gesicht die Antwort gibt, daß etwas in mir dir entgegenkommt und dir Vertrauen macht – ebenso geht es mir auch mit dir. Als ich dich neulich im Schwarzen Adler hereinkommen sah, so müd und abwesend und schon beinah nicht mehr auf dieser Welt, da spürte ich gleich: der wird mir gehorchen, der sehnt sich danach, daß ich ihm befehle! Und das werde ich auch tun, darum habe ich dich angesprochen, und darum sind wir Freunde geworden.«","""You, don't forget what you said to me! You said I should command you and it would be your pleasure to obey all my commands. Do not forget that! You must know, little Harry: just as you feel about me, that my face gives the answer, that something in me comes towards you and makes you trust - I feel the same way about you. When I recently saw you come into the Schwarzer Adler, so tired and absent and already almost gone from this world, I felt immediately: he will obey me, he longs for me to command him! And that's what I'm going to do, that's why I approached you, and that's why we became friends.""","""Mind, don't forget what you said to me. You said that I was to command you and that it would be a joy to you to obey my commands. Don't forget that. You must know this, my little Harry—just as something in me corresponds to you and gives you confidence, so it is with me. The other day when I saw you come in to the Black Eagle, exhausted and beside yourself and scarcely in this world any longer, it came to me at once: This man will obey me. All he wants is that I should command him. And that's what I'm going to do. That's why I spoke to you and why we made friends.""","‘Mind you don’t forget what you told me, my dear. You told me to give you orders and that you’d be delighted to obey them all. Don’t forget! I must tell you, Harry my boy, that just as you feel that my face responds to you, that there is something in me that comes halfway to meet you and inspires you with confidence, I feel exactly the same thing with regard to you. When I saw you coming into the Black Eagle recently, so weary and absent-minded, almost having departed this world already, I immediately sensed: there’s someone who will obey me; he’s just longing for me to order him about. And I intend to do just that. That’s why I spoke to you, that’s why we’ve become friends.’"
"An jenem Abend saß ich zu Hause, wollte lesen und konnte nicht. Ich hatte Angst vor morgen; der Gedanke war mir entsetzlich, daß ich alter, scheuer und empfindlicher Sonderling nicht nur eines dieser öden modernen Tee- und Tanzlokale mit Jazzmusik besuchen, sondern mich dort unter den fremden Menschen als Tänzer zeigen sollte, ohne noch irgend etwas zu können. Und ich gestehe, daß ich über mich selber lachte und mich vor mir selber geschämt habe, als ich allein in meinem stillen Studierzimmer den Apparat aufzog und laufen ließ und leise, auf Socken, die Schritte meines Fox repetierte.","That evening I was sitting at home wanting to read and not being able to. I was afraid of tomorrow; I was horrified by the thought that I, an old, shy, and sensitive oddball, should not only visit one of those dreary modern tea and dance places with jazz music, but show myself there among the strangers as a dancer without being able to do anything else. And I confess that I laughed at myself and was ashamed of myself when, alone in my quiet study, I wound up the machine and let it run, and quietly, in my socks, repeated the steps of my fox.","That evening I sat in my room and tried to read; but I could not. I was in dread of the morrow. It was a most horrible thought that I, an elderly, shy, touchy crank, was to frequent one of those modern deserts of jazz music, a thé dansant, and a far more horrible thought that I was to figure there as a dancer, though I did not in the least know how to dance. And I own I laughed at myself and felt shame in my own eyes when alone in the quiet of my study I turned on the machine and softly in stockinged feet went through the steps of my dance.","I spent that evening sitting at home, wanting to read but unable to do so. I was afraid of the next day. It horrified me to think that I, an old, shy and sensitive misfit, should not only visit one of those dreary modern tea-dance places where they played jazz, but also, without yet being able to do a thing, put in an appearance on the dance floor among strangers. And I confess to laughing at myself and feeling ashamed at my own behaviour when, alone in the silence of my study, after winding up the gramophone and setting it in motion, I quietly rehearsed the steps of my foxtrot in my stockinged feet."
"Er hielt mir das Spieglein vor die Augen (ein Kindervers fiel mir ein: »Spiegelein, Spiegelein in der Hand«), und ich sah, etwas zerflossen und wolkig, ein unheimliches, in sich selbst bewegtes, in sich selbst heftig arbeitendes und gärendes Bild: mich selber, Harry Haller, und innen in diesem Harry den Steppenwolf, einen scheuen, schönen, aber verirrt und geängstigt blickenden Wolf, die Augen bald böse, bald traurig glimmend, und diese Wolfgestalt floß in unablässiger Bewegung durch Harry, so wie in einem Strome ein Nebenfluß von andrer Farbe wölkt und wühlt, kämpfend, leidvoll, einer im andern fressend, voll unerlöster Sehnsucht nach Gestaltung. Traurig, traurig blickte der fließende, halbgestaltete Wolf mich aus den schönen scheuen Augen an.","He held the mirror in front of my eyes (a children's rhyme came to mind: ""Mirror, mirror in my hand""), and I saw, somewhat blurred and cloudy, an uncanny image, moving within itself, laboring and fermenting violently within itself : myself, Harry Haller, and inside this Harry the Steppenwolf, a shy, beautiful wolf, but looking lost and frightened, eyes glowing now evil, now sad, and this wolf figure flowed through Harry in incessant movement, as in one A tributary stream of a different color clouds and churns, fighting, suffering, one devouring the other, full of unredeemed longing for form. Sadly, sadly, the flowing, half-formed wolf looked at me with beautiful, shy eyes.","He held the little glass before my eyes (a childish verse came to my mind: "" Little glass, little glass in the hand"") and I saw, though indistinctly and cloudily, the reflection of an uneasy self-tormented, inwardly laboring and seething being—myself, Harry Haller. And within him again I saw the Steppenwolf, a shy, beautiful, dazed wolf with frightened eyes that smoldered now with anger, now with sadness. This shape of a wolf coursed through the other in ceaseless movement, as a tributary pours its cloudy turmoil into a river. In bitter strife, each tried to devour the other so that his shape might prevail. How unutterably sad was the look this fluid inchoate figure of the wolf threw from his beautiful shy eyes.","As he held the little looking glass in front of my eyes I couldn’t help thinking ‘mirror, mirror in the hand’, a variation on the familiar line from my childhood. What I now saw was rather blurred and hazy, a disturbingly agitated image, full of inner turmoil and ferment. It was of me myself, Harry Haller, and inside Harry was Steppenwolf, a timid, handsome, apparently stray wolf, looking around nervously with a glint in its eyes that was now furious, now sad. Incessantly on the move, the image of the wolf was flowing through Harry just as a tributary of a different colour can be seen merging with a major river, churning and clouding its waters. The two were locked in painful combat, eating away at one another, each longing to assert a fully formed identity, but in vain. The fluid, half-formed wolf was gazing at me sadly, ever so sadly, with its handsome, timid eyes."
"Für diese Qual wurde jedoch der erregte Zuschauer im zweiten Teil der Vorführung, ebenso wie der Wolf selbst, entschädigt. Nach Abwickelung jenes raffinierten Dressurprogramms nämlich und nachdem der Bändiger über der Lamm- und Wolfgruppe sich triumphierend mit süßem Lächeln verbeugt hatte, wurden die Rollen vertauscht. Der harryähnliche Tierbändiger legte plötzlich seine Peitsche mit tiefem Bückling dem Wolfe zu Füßen und begann ebenso zu zittern, einzuschrumpfen und elend auszusehen wie vorher das Tier. Der Wolf aber leckte sich lachend das Maul, Krampf und Verlogenheit fielen von ihm ab, sein Blick leuchtete, sein ganzer Leib wurde straff und blühte in wiedererlangter Wildheit auf.","However, the excited spectator was compensated for this agony in the second part of the performance, as was the wolf himself. After that ingenious dressage program had been completed and the tamer had bowed triumphantly with a sweet smile to the lamb and wolf groups, the roles were reversed. The Harry-like beast tamer suddenly laid his whip, bowed low, at the wolf's feet and began to tremble, shrivel up and look miserable as the beast had before. But the wolf laughed and licked his mouth, spasm and mendacity fell from him, his eyes shone, his whole body became taut and bloomed in renewed wildness.","There was some compensation, however, both for the horrified spectator and for the wolf himself, in the second part of the program. For after this refined exhibition of animal taming and when the man with a winning smile had made his triumphant bow over the group of the wolf and the lamb, the roles were reversed. My engaging double suddenly with a low reverence laid his whip at the wolf's feet and became as agitated, as shrunken and wretched, as the wolf had been before. The wolf, however, licked his chops with a grin, his constraint and dissimulation erased. His eyes kindled. His whole body was taut and showed the joy he felt at recovering his wild nature.","In the second part of the performance, however, the enraged spectator, and the wolf itself as well, were compensated for this agony. You see, once that sophisticated demonstration of obedience had run its course, and after the tamer, smiling sweetly, had taken a triumphal bow over the group with the lamb and the wolf, the roles were reversed. All of a sudden, the Harry-like animal tamer, bowing low to the wolf, laid his whip at its feet and began to tremble and cower down, looking just as wretched as the animal had done before. The wolf, on the other hand, licked its lips and smiled, abandoning all its earlier forced and false airs. Its eyes beamed and every sinew in its body tightened as its savage self began to thrive again."

"Der Tag war vergangen, wie eben die Tage so vergehen, ich hatte ihn herumgebracht, hatte ihn sanft umgebracht, mit meiner primitiven und schüchternen Art von Lebenskunst; ich hatte einige Stunden gearbeitet, alte Bücher gewälzt, ich hatte zwei Stunden lang Schmerzen gehabt, wie ältere Leute sie eben haben, hatte ein Pulver genommen und mich gefreut, daß die Schmerzen sich überlisten ließen, hatte in einem heißen Bad gelegen und die liebe Wärme eingesogen, hatte dreimal die Post empfangen und all die entbehrlichen Briefe und Drucksachen durchgesehen, hatte meine Atemübungen gemacht, die Gedankenübungen aber heut aus Bequemlichkeit weggelassen, war eine Stunde spazieren gewesen und hatte schöne, zarte, kostbare Federwölkchenmuster in den Himmel gezeichnet gefunden. Das war sehr hübsch, ebenso wie das Lesen in den alten Büchern, wie das Liegen im warmen Bad, aber – alles in allem – war es nicht gerade ein entzückender, nicht eben ein strahlender, ein Glücks- und Freudentag gewesen, sondern eben einer von diesen Tagen, wie sie für mich nun seit langer Zeit die normalen und gewohnten sein sollten: maßvoll angenehme, durchaus erträgliche, leidliche, laue Tage eines älteren unzufriedenen Herrn, Tage ohne besondere Schmerzen, ohne besondere Sorgen, ohne eigentlichen Kummer, ohne Verzweiflung, Tage, an welchen selbst die Frage, ob es nicht an der Zeit sei, dem Beispiele Adalbert Stifters zu folgen und beim Rasieren zu verunglücken, ohne Aufregung oder Angstgefühle sachlich und ruhig erwogen wird.","The day had passed, just as days pass, I had brought him around, killed him gently, with my primitive and shy way of living; I had worked for a few hours, poring over old books, I had been in pain for two hours, as older people do, had taken a powder and was happy that the pain could be outwitted, had lain in a hot bath and felt the lovely warmth had received the post three times and looked through all the superfluous letters and printed matter, had done my breathing exercises, but omitted the mental exercises today for convenience, had gone for an hour's walk and had found beautiful, delicate, precious patterns of little feather clouds drawn in the sky. That was very nice, just like reading the old books, like lying in the warm bath, but – all in all – it wasn't exactly a delightful, not exactly a radiant, a happy and joyful day, but just one of these days, as they should have been the normal and familiar ones for a long time now: moderately pleasant, thoroughly tolerable, tolerable, mild days of an elderly, dissatisfied gentleman, days without particular pain, without particular worries, without real grief, without despair, days , at which even the question of whether it is not time to follow the example of Adalbert Stifter and have an accident while shaving is considered objectively and calmly, without excitement or feelings of anxiety.","THE DAY HAD GONE BY JUST AS DAYS GO BY. I had killed it in accordance with my primitive and retiring way of life. I had worked for an hour or two and perused the pages of old books. I had had pains for two hours, as elderly people do. I had taken a powder and been very glad when the pains consented to disappear. I had lain in a hot bath and absorbed its kindly warmth. Three times the mail had come with undesired letters and circulars to look through. I had done my breathing exercises, but found it convenient today to omit the thought exercises. I had been for an hour's walk and seen the loveliest feathery cloud patterns penciled against the sky. That was very delightful. So was the reading of the old books. So was the lying in the warm bath. But, taken all in all, it had not been exactly a day of rapture. No, it had not even been a day brightened with happiness and joy. Rather, it had been just one of those days which for a long while now had fallen to my lot; the moderately pleasant, the wholly bearable and tolerable, lukewarm days of a discontented middle-aged man; days without special pains, without special cares, without particular worry, without despair; days when I calmly wonder, objective and fearless, whether it isn't time to follow the example of Adalbert Stifter and have an accident while shaving.","The day had gone by as days tend to. I had whiled away the hours, gently killing time in the only way I know how to, unworldly and withdrawn as my life is. I’d spent a few hours working, poring over old books. For two hours I had been in pain, the way people getting on in years are. I had taken a powder and rejoiced at the outcome, for pain could be outwitted. I had lain in a hot bath, soaking up the welcome warmth. I had had three deliveries of post and flicked through all the letters and printed matter I could do without. I had done my breathing exercises but had skipped the mental ones, too idle for them today. I had been out walking for an hour and discovered fine, delicate, precious patterns traced in the sky by small wisps of cloud. This was very pleasing, just as reading the old books or lying in the warm bath had been. Yet, all in all, it had not exactly been a delightful or particularly glorious day, a day of happiness or joy. Instead, just one of those normal, routine days which for a long time now had been my lot: moderately pleasant, perfectly tolerable, reasonable, lukewarm days in the life of an elderly, discontented gentleman; days without exceptional pain, without exceptional worries, devoid of actual grief or despair. Days when, without getting upset or feeling anxious, it is even possible objectively and calmly to consider whether the time might not have come to follow the example of Adalbert Stifter by having an accident while shaving.1"
"Ich küßte sie auf Augen, Mund, Hals und Brüste. Eben noch hatte ich an Hermine gedacht, bitter und mit Vorwürfen. Nun hielt ich ihr Geschenk in Händen und war dankbar. Die Liebkosungen Marias taten der wunderbaren Musik nicht weh, die ich heut gehört hatte, sie waren ihr würdig und ihre Erfüllung. Langsam zog ich die Decke von der schönen Frau, bis ich mit meinen Küssen zu ihren Füßen gelangt war. Als ich mich zu ihr legte, lächelte ihr Blumengesicht mich allwissend und gütig an. In dieser Nacht, an Marias Seite, schlief ich nicht lange, aber tief und gut wie ein Kind. Und zwischen den Schlafzeiten trank ich ihre schöne heitere Jugend und erfuhr im leisen Plaudern eine Menge wissenswerter Dinge über ihr und Hermines Leben. Ich hatte über diese Art von Wesen und Leben sehr wenig gewußt, nur beim Theater hatte ich früher gelegentlich ähnliche Existenzen, Frauen wie Männer, angetroffen, halb Künstler, halb Lebewelt. Jetzt erst sah ich ein wenig in diese merkwürdigen, diese seltsam unschuldigen, seltsam verdorbenen Leben hinein. Diese Mädchen, von Hause meist arm, zu klug und zu hübsch, um ihr ganzes Leben einzig auf irgendeinen schlechtbezahlten und freudlosen Broterwerb zu stellen, lebten alle bald von Gelegenheitsarbeit, bald von ihrer Anmut und Liebenswürdigkeit. Sie saßen zuweilen ein paar Monate an einer Schreibmaschine, waren zeitweise die Geliebten wohlhabender Lebemänner, bekamen Taschengelder und Geschenke, lebten zu Zeiten in Pelz, Auto und Grand Hotel, zu andern Zeiten in Dachkammern und waren zur Ehe zwar unter Umständen durch ein hohes Angebot zu gewinnen, im ganzen aber keineswegs auf sie erpicht. Manche von ihnen waren in der Liebe ohne Begehrlichkeit und gaben ihre Gunst nur widerwillig und unter Feilschen um den höchsten Preis. Andre, und zu ihnen gehörte Maria, waren ungewöhnlich liebesbegabt und liebesbedürftig, die meisten auch in der Liebe mit beiden Geschlechtern erfahren; sie lebten einzig der Liebe wegen und hatten stets neben den offiziellen und zahlenden Freunden noch andre Liebesbeziehungen blühen. Emsig und geschäftig, sorgenvoll und leichtsinnig, klug und doch besinnungslos lebten diese Schmetterlinge ihr ebenso kindliches wie raffiniertes Leben, unabhängig, nicht für jeden käuflich, vom Glück und guten Wetter das Ihre erwartend, ins Leben verliebt und doch viel weniger an ihm hängend als die Bürger, stets bereit, einem Märchenprinzen in sein Schloß zu folgen, stets mit halbem Bewußtsein eines schweren und traurigen Endes gewiß.","I kissed her eyes, mouth, neck and breasts. I had just been thinking of Hermione, bitterly and with reproach. Now I held her gift in my hands and was grateful. Mary's caresses did not hurt the wonderful music I had heard today, they were worthy of her and her fulfillment. I slowly pulled the covers off the beautiful woman until my kisses reached her feet. As I lay down beside her, her flowery face smiled at me knowingly and kindly. That night, at Maria's side, I didn't sleep long, but I slept deeply and well, like a child. And between sleep times I drank her beautiful, cheerful youth and, in quiet chatter, learned a lot of interesting things about her and Hermione's life. I had known very little about this kind of being and life, only in the past I had occasionally encountered similar existences, women and men, half artist, half living world, in the theater. Only now did I see a little into these strange, strangely innocent, strangely depraved lives. These girls, mostly poor at home, too clever and too pretty to devote their whole lives to some badly paid and joyless bread and butter, all lived sometimes from casual work, sometimes from their grace and kindness. They sometimes sat at a typewriter for a few months, were at times the lovers of wealthy bon vivants, received pocket money and gifts, sometimes lived in furs, cars and grand hotels, at other times in attics, and were in some cases made to marry by a high offer win, but on the whole by no means eager for them. Some of them were in love without covetousness, and gave their favors only reluctantly and with haggling for the highest price. Others, and Maria was one of them, were unusually gifted and in need of love, most of them experienced in love with both sexes; they lived solely for the sake of love and always had other love affairs flourishing in addition to official and paying friends. Industrious and busy, worried and careless, clever and yet senseless, these butterflies lived their childish and refined life, independent, not for sale for everyone, expecting their luck and good weather, in love with life and yet much less attached to it than they Citizens, always ready to follow a fairytale prince to his castle, always half aware of a difficult and sad end.","I kissed her eyes, her mouth and neck and breasts. A moment ago I had thought of Hermine with bitterness and reproach. Now I held her gift in my hands and was thankful. Maria's caresses did not harm the wonderful music I had heard that evening. They were its worthy fulfillment. Slowly I drew the clothes from her lovely body till my kisses reached her feet. When I lay down beside her, her flower face smiled back at me omniscient and bountiful. During this night by Maria's side I did not sleep much, but my sleep was as deep and peaceful as a child's. And between sleeping I drank of her beautiful warm youth and heard, as we talked softly, a number of curious tales about her life and Hermine's. I had never known much of this side of life. Only in the theatrical world, occasionally, in earlier years had I come across similar existences—women as well as men who lived half for art and half for pleasure. Now, for the first time, I had a glimpse into this kind of life, remarkable alike for its singular innocence and singular corruption. These girls, mostly from poor homes, but too intelligent and too pretty to give their whole lives to some ill-paid and joyless way of gaining their living, all lived sometimes on casual work, sometimes on their charm and easy virtue. Now and then, for a month or two, they sat at a typewriter; at times were the mistresses of well-to-do men of the world, receiving pocket money and presents; lived at times in furs and motorcars, at other times in attics, and though a good offer might under some circumstances induce them to marry, they were not at all eager for it. Many of them had little inclination for love and gave themselves very unwillingly, and then only for money and at the highest price. Others, and Maria was one of them, were unusually gifted in love and unable to do without it. They lived solely for love and besides their official and lucrative friends had other love affairs as well. Assiduous and busy, care-ridden and light-hearted, intelligent and yet thoughtless, these butterflies lived a life at once childlike and raffiné; independent, not to be bought by every one, finding their account in good luck and fine weather, in love with life and yet clinging to it far less than the bourgeois, always ready to follow a fairy prince to his castle, always certain, though scarcely conscious of it, that a difficult and sad end was in store for them.","I kissed her eyes, her mouth, her neck and her breasts. Only a moment ago, I had been bitterly blaming Hermione in my thoughts. Now, holding her gift to me in my hands, I felt grateful. Maria’s caresses didn’t in the least jar with the glorious music I had heard that evening. They were worthy of it, indeed complemented it. Slowly I removed the blanket from her beautiful body until I reached her feet with my kisses. And when I lay down beside her she gave me a kind smile, an all-knowing smile that lit up her floral face. That night, lying beside Maria, I slept, though not for long, deeply and satisfyingly like a child. And between my bouts of sleep I drank my fill of her lovely serene youthfulness and, as we chatted softly, discovered a lot of things worth knowing about her life and Hermione ’s. I had scant knowledge of creatures and lives of this kind. Only occasionally, in the theatrical world, had I previously encountered similar existences, both women and men, half artists, half good-time girls or playboys. Not until now did I gain a little insight into these curious, strangely innocent yet strangely degenerate lives. All these young women, usually from poor backgrounds but too clever and too good-looking to spend their whole lives earning their living in one single, badly paid and joyless job or another, were dependent partly on casual work, partly on their charming looks for survival. From time to time they would spend a few months sitting at a typewriter; periodically they were the lovers of affluent playboys who rewarded them with pocket money and presents. At times they lived a life in furs, limousines and grand hotels; at others they just had a room in some attic. If offered a high enough sum, they could possibly be persuaded to marry, but generally speaking they were far from keen on the idea. Many of them were devoid of sexual desire, only reluctantly granting their favours, and then only for the highest price, arrived at after considerable haggling. Others, and Maria was one of them, were unusually gifted lovers with strong sexual needs. Most of these were also experienced in the arts of making love with both sexes. Living solely for sex, they constantly had other, thriving relationships on the go in addition to those with their official and paying partners. Restlessly busy, full of care yet careless, clever yet thoughtless, these butterflies lived their lives, which were as childlike as they were sophisticated, independently. They could not be bought by just anybody; they expected no more than their fair share of good fortune and good weather. In love with life, yet far less attached to it than conventional members of society, they were forever willing to follow some fairy-tale prince to his castle, forever half aware that they would surely come to a sad and difficult end."
"Dies Mittel also kam nicht in Betracht. Aber ich gab meinem Entschluß nun diese Form: sobald es mit mir wieder dahin kommen würde, daß ich zu jenem Opiat greifen mußte, sollte es mir erlaubt sein, statt dieser kurzen Erlösung die große zu schlürfen, den Tod, und zwar einen sichern, zuverlässigen Tod, mit der Kugel oder dem Rasiermesser. Damit war die Lage geklärt – bis zu meinem fünfzigsten Geburtstag zu warten, nach dem witzigen Rezept des Steppenwolfbüchleins, das schien mir doch allzulange, es waren noch zwei Jahre bis dahin. Sei es in einem Jahr oder in einem Monat, sei es morgen schon – die Pforte stand offen.","So this means was out of the question. But I gave my resolution this form: as soon as I had to reach for that opiate again, I should be allowed to slurp up the great one instead of this short release, death, and a safe, reliable one at that Death, with the bullet or the razor. That settled the situation – to wait until my fiftieth birthday, following the funny recipe in the Steppenwolf booklet, seemed too long to me, there were still two years to go. Be it in a year or in a month, be it tomorrow - the gate was open.","This expedient, then, was no good. But I put my resolution in this way: the next time I felt that I must have recourse to the opium, I might allow myself to use big means instead of small, that is, a death of absolute certainty with a bullet or a razor. Then I could be sure. As for waiting till my fiftieth birthday, as the little book wittily prescribed—this seemed to me much too long a delay. There were still two years till then. Whether it were a year hence or a month, were it even the following day, the door stood open.","This means was therefore out of the question. But I now formulated my decision as follows: as soon as my condition was again bad enough to make me reach for that opiate, I should be allowed, instead of slurping it in search of fleeting relief, to seek lasting salvation in death – and a certain and reliable death, what’s more, either by a bullet or the blade of a razor. This clarified the situation. To wait until my fiftieth birthday, the solution oddly suggested in the booklet about Steppenwolf, seemed to me far too long. After all, there were still two years to go till that date. Whether it was a matter of a year or a month, whether tomorrow even – the door was now open."

"»Die fehlerhafte und Unglück bringende Auffassung, als sei ein Mensch eine dauernde Einheit, ist Ihnen bekannt. Es ist Ihnen auch bekannt, daß der Mensch aus einer Menge von Seelen, aus sehr vielen Ichs besteht. Die scheinbare Einheit der Person in diese vielen Figuren auseinanderzuspalten gilt für verrückt, die Wissenschaft hat dafür den Namen Schizophrenie erfunden. Die Wissenschaft hat damit insofern recht, als natürlich keine Vielheit ohne Führung, ohne eine gewisse Ordnung und Gruppierung zu bändigen ist. Unrecht dagegen hat sie darin, daß sie glaubt, es sei nur eine einmalige, bindende, lebenslängliche Ordnung der vielen Unter-Ichs möglich. Dieser Irrtum der Wissenschaft hat manche unangenehme Folgen, sein Wert liegt lediglich darin, daß die staatlich angestellten Lehrer und Erzieher sich ihre Arbeit vereinfacht und das Denken und Experimentieren erspart sehen. Infolge jenes Irrtums gelten viele Menschen für »normal«, ja für sozial hochwertig, welche unheilbar verrückt sind, und umgekehrt werden manche für verrückt angesehen, welche Genies sind. Wir ergänzen daher die lückenhafte Seelenlehre der Wissenschaft durch den Begriff, den wir Aufbaukunst nennen. Wir zeigen demjenigen, der das Auseinanderfallen seines Ichs erlebt hat, daß er die Stücke jederzeit in beliebiger Ordnung neu zusammenstellen und daß er damit eine unendliche Mannigfaltigkeit des Lebensspieles erzielen kann. Wie der Dichter aus einer Handvoll Figuren ein Drama schafft, so bauen wir aus den Figuren unsres zerlegten Ichs immerzu neue Gruppen, mit neuen Spielen und Spannungen, mit ewig neuen Situationen.

Splitting the apparent unity of the person into these many figures is considered crazy, science has invented the name schizophrenia for it. Science is right insofar as naturally no multiplicity can be tamed without leadership, without a certain order and grouping. On the other hand, it is wrong in believing that only a one-off, binding, lifelong ordering of the many sub-egos is possible. This error of science has some unpleasant consequences, its value lies only in the fact that the teachers and educators employed by the state see their work simplified and spared the need to think and experiment. As a result of that error, many people are considered ""normal"", even socially good, who are terminally insane, and conversely some are considered insane who are geniuses. We therefore supplement the incomplete soul teachings of science with the concept that we call the art of construction. We show those who have experienced the disintegration of their ego that they can rearrange the pieces at any time in any order they like and that in this way they can achieve an infinite variety of life's games. Just as the poet creates a drama from a handful of characters, so we constantly build new groups from the characters of our fragmented ego, with new games and tensions, with ever new situations. Can you see it!""","""The mistaken and unhappy notion that a man is an enduring unity is known to you. It is also known to you that man consists of a multitude of souls, of numerous selves. The separation of the unity of the personality into these numerous pieces passes for madness. Science has invented the name schizomania for it. Science is in this so far right as no multiplicity may be dealt with unless there be a series, a certain order and grouping. It is wrong insofar as it holds that one only and binding and lifelong order is possible for the multiplicity of subordinate selves. This error of science has many unpleasant consequences, and the single advantage of simplifying the work of the state-appointed pastors and masters and saving them the labors of original thought. In consequence of this error many persons pass for normal, and indeed for highly valuable members of society, who are incurably mad; and many, on the other hand, are looked upon as mad who are geniuses. Hence it is that we supplement the imperfect psychology of science by the conception that we call the art of building up the soul. We demonstrate to anyone whose soul has fallen to pieces that he can rearrange these pieces of a previous self in what order he pleases, and so attain to an endless multiplicity of moves in the game of life. As the playwright shapes a drama from a handful of characters, so do we from the pieces of the disintegrated self build up ever new groups, with ever new interplay and suspense, and new situations that are eternally inexhaustible.

You are also aware that they are made up of a multiplicity of souls, of very many selves. To split up the ostensible unity of the person into all these different pieces is considered mad. Science has coined the term schizophrenia for it. Of course, in as much as it is impossible to bring any large number of things under control without leadership or a degree of combination and categorization, science is right to do so. On the other hand, scientists are wrong in believing that the only possible combination of our many sub-selves is a once-and-for-all thing, a binding arrangement valid for the whole of our lives. This error on the part of scientists has many unpleasant consequences. All that can be said in its favour is that it simplifies the task of those appointed by the state to teach and educate, sparing them the trouble of thinking and experimenting.

Conversely, there are quite a lot of people regarded as mad who are geniuses.

"Wer nun aber meint, den Steppenwolf zu kennen und sein klägliches, zerrissenes Leben sich vorstellen zu können, der ist dennoch im Irrtum, er weiß noch lange nicht alles. Er weiß nicht, daß es (wie keine Regel ohne Ausnahme und wie ein einziger Sünder unter Umständen Gott lieber ist als neunundneunzig Gerechte) – daß es bei Harry immerhin auch Ausnahmen und Glücksfälle gab, daß er zuweilen den Wolf, zuweilen den Menschen auch rein und ungestört in sich atmen, denken und fühlen konnte, ja, daß beide manchmal, in sehr seltenen Stunden, Frieden schlossen und einander zu Liebe lebten, so daß nicht bloß der eine schlief, während der andre wachte, sondern beide einander stärkten und jeder den andern verdoppelte. Auch im Leben dieses Mannes schien, wie überall in der Welt, zuweilen alles Gewohnte, Alltägliche, Erkannte und Regelmäßige bloß den Zweck zu haben, hie und da eine sekundenkurze Pause zu erleben, durchbrochen zu werden und dem Außerordentlichen, dem Wunder, der Gnade Platz zu machen. Ob nun diese kurzen, seltenen Glücksstunden das schlimme Los des Steppenwolfes ausglichen und milderten, so daß Glück und Leid sich schließlich die Waage hielten, oder ob vielleicht sogar das kurze, aber starke Glück jener wenigen Stunden alles Leid aufsog und ein Plus ergab, das ist nun wieder eine Frage, über welche müßige Leute nach Belieben brüten mögen. Auch der Wolf brütete oft darüber, und das waren seine müßigen und unnützen Tage.","But anyone who thinks they know Steppenwolf and can imagine his pitiful, torn life is still wrong, they still don't know everything. He doesn't know that (like no rule without exception and like a single sinner is sometimes dearer to God than ninety-nine righteous people) - that with Harry there were at least exceptions and strokes of luck, that he was sometimes the wolf, sometimes the human being pure and could breathe, think and feel undisturbed, yes, that both sometimes, in very rare hours, made peace and lived for the love of each other, so that not only one slept while the other watched, but both strengthened each other and each the other doubled. In the life of this man, as everywhere else in the world, everything that was familiar, everyday, recognized and regular seemed at times to have the sole purpose of experiencing a brief pause here and there, to be broken through and to make room for the extraordinary, for miracles, for grace close. Whether these short, rare hours of happiness compensated for and alleviated the bad fate of the Steppenwolf, so that happiness and suffering finally balanced each other out, or whether the short but strong happiness of those few hours absorbed all suffering and resulted in a plus, that is now again a question over which idle people may brood at will. The wolf often brooded over it too, and those were his idle and useless days.","Now, whoever thinks that he knows the Steppenwolf and that he can imagine to himself his lamentably divided life is nevertheless in error. He does not know all by a long way. He does not know that, as there is no rule without an exception and as one sinner may under certain circumstances be dearer to God than ninety and nine righteous persons, with Harry too there were now and then exceptions and strokes of good luck, and that he could breathe and think and feel sometimes as the wolf, sometimes as the man, clearly and without confusion of the two; and even on very rare occasions, they made peace and lived for one another in such fashion that not merely did one keep watch whilst the other slept but each strengthened and confirmed the other. In the life of this man, too, as well as in all things else in the world, daily use and the accepted and common knowledge seemed sometimes to have no other aim than to be arrested now and again for an instant, and broken through, in order to yield the place of honor to the exceptional and miraculous. Now whether these short and occasional hours of happiness balanced and alleviated the lot of the Steppenwolf in such a fashion that in the upshot happiness and suffering held the scales even, or whether perhaps the short but intense happiness of those few hours outweighed all suffering and left a balance over is again a question over which idle persons may meditate to their hearts' content. Even the wolf brooded often over this, and those were his idle and unprofitable days.","Any readers now thinking they know Steppenwolf and can imagine what his wretched life, lived at odds with himself, was like, are mistaken, however, because they don’t know the half of the story. Just as there are exceptions to every rule, and one lone sinner may under certain circumstances be more pleasing to God than ninety-nine righteous people, there were, though we haven’t mentioned them yet, exceptions and strokes of luck in Harry’s case too. At times he had no difficulty breathing, thinking and feeling purely as a wolf, at other times purely as a human being. On very rare occasions, the two even made peace with one another, lived for each other’s sake, so that it was no longer the case that one of them slept while the other was on watch. Rather, they reinforced one another, each acting as the other’s double. Moreover, as happens all over the world, there were also times in this man’s life when all things habitual, everyday, familiar and routine seemed only to exist in order to be put on hold for a matter of seconds, momentarily disrupted so as to make way for something extraordinary and miraculous, for grace. It is of course debatable whether these rare and brief periods of happiness made up for and alleviated Steppenwolf’s otherwise wretched lot so that his happiness and suffering eventually balanced one another out. Perhaps the fleeting but potent happiness of these rare moments even absorbed all his suffering, leaving a positive residue. This is one more question that those with time to spare might care to brood upon. The wolf frequently did brood upon it, and the days he spent doing so were wasted, pointless days."

"So war es einst gewesen, an einem Sonntag vor fünfunddreißig Jahren, und alles Damalige war in diesem Augenblick wiedergekehrt: Hügel und Stadt, Märzwind und Knospengeruch, Rosa und ihr braunes Haar, aufschwellende Sehnsucht und süße würgende Angst. Alles war wie damals, und mir schien, ich habe niemals mehr in meinem Leben so geliebt, wie ich damals Rosa liebte. Aber diesmal war es mir gegeben, sie anders zu empfangen als jenesmal. Ich sah ihr Erröten, als sie mich erkannte, sah ihr Bemühen, das Erröten zu verbergen, und wußte sofort, daß sie mich gern habe, daß ihr diese Begegnung dasselbe bedeute wie mir. Und statt wieder den Hut zu ziehen und feierlich mit gezogenem Hut zu stehen, bis sie vorüber wäre, tat ich diesmal trotz Angst und Beklemmung, was mein Blut mich tun hieß, und rief: »Rosa! Gott sei Dank, daß du gekommen bist, du schönes schönes Mädchen. Ich habe dich so lieb.« Das war vielleicht nicht das Geistreichste, was sich in diesem Augenblick sagen ließ, allein es bedurfte hier keines Geistes, es genügte vollkommen. Rosa machte kein Damengesicht und ging nicht weiter, Rosa blieb stehen, sah mich an und wurde noch röter als vorher und sagte: »Grüß Gott, Harry, hast du mich denn wirklich gern?« Dazu strahlten ihre braunen Augen aus dem kräftigen Gesicht, und ich spürte: mein ganzes vergangenes Leben und Lieben war falsch und verworren und voll dummen Unglücks gewesen von dem Augenblick an, wo ich Rosa an jenem Sonntag hatte davonlaufen lassen. Jetzt aber war der Fehler gutgemacht, und es wurde alles anders, wurde alles gut.","It had been like that, one Sunday thirty-five years ago, and everything of that time had returned in that moment: hill and city, March wind and the smell of buds, Rosa and her brown hair, swelling longing and sweet choking fear. Everything was as it was then, and it seemed to me that I had never in my life loved as I loved Rosa then. But this time it was given to me to receive her differently than that time. I saw her blush as she recognized me, saw her struggle to hide the blush, and knew immediately that she cared for me, that this meeting meant the same to her as it did to me. And instead of doffing my hat again and standing solemnly with my hat off until it was over, this time, in spite of fear and trepidation, I did what my blood bade me do and cried, ""Rosa! Pink!"" Thank God you came, you beautiful beautiful girl. I love you so much.” That was perhaps not the most witty thing that could be said at that moment, but no wit was needed here, it was perfectly sufficient. Rosa didn't make a lady's face and didn't go any further, Rosa stopped, looked at me and blushed even more than before and said: ""Hello, Harry, do you really like me?"" I felt: my whole past life and love had been wrong and confused and full of stupid unhappiness from the moment I let Rosa run away that Sunday. But now the mistake had been made up for, and everything was different, everything was fine.","So it had once been on a Sunday thirty-five years before, and all that had been then came back to me in this moment. Hill and town, March wind and buddy taste, Rosa and her brown hair, the welling-up of desire and the sweet suffocation of anguish. All was as it was then, and it seemed to me that I had never in my life loved as I loved Rosa that day. But this time it was given me to greet her otherwise than on that occasion. I saw her blush when she recognized me, and the pains she took to conceal it, and I knew at once that she had a liking for me and that this encounter meant the same for her as for me. And this time instead of standing ceremoniously cap in hand till she had gone by, I did, in spite of anguish bordering on obsession, what my blood bade me do. I cried: ""Rosa! Thank God, you've come, you beautiful, beautiful girl. I love you so dearly. "" It was not perhaps the most brilliant of all the things that might have been said at this moment, but there was no need for brilliance, and it was enough and more. Rosa did not put on her grown-up air, and she did not go on. She stopped and looked at me and, growing even redder than before, she said: ""Heaven be praised, Harry—do you really like me?"" Her brown eyes lit up her strong face, and they showed me that my past life and loves had all been false and perplexed and full of stupid unhappiness from that very moment on a Sunday afternoon when I had let Rosa pass me by. Now, however, the blunder was put right. Everything went differently and everything was good.","That is how it had been one Sunday thirty-five years ago, and it had all come back to me at this moment: hill and town, March wind and scent of buds, Rosa and her brown hair, tumescent desire and sweet, suffocating anxiety. It was all as before, and it seemed to me that in all my life I had never again loved anyone in the way that I loved Rosa. This time, however, I was given the opportunity to welcome her differently. I saw her blush on recognizing me, saw her effort to disguise the fact, and knew at once that she liked me, that this encounter meant as much to her as it did to me. And this time, despite feeling anxious and inhibited, instead of raising my hat and holding it ceremoniously above my head as I stood there waiting until she passed by, I did as my pulsating heart commanded and cried: ‘Rosa! Thank God you’ve come, you lovely lovely lass. I’m so very fond of you.’ It may not have been the cleverest way of putting it, but this was no time for being clever, and it was perfectly adequate. Rosa gave me no ladylike look, stopped rather than going on her way, looked at me, blushing even more than before, and said: ‘Hello, Harry. Are you really fond of me?’ As she spoke her brown eyes beamed at me from her vibrant face and I felt that my whole past life and loves had been wrong, confused and full of misfortune since the moment when I allowed Rosa to walk away from me on that Sunday. But now I had put right my mistake and everything was changing, taking a turn for the better."
"O wie lachte da der unheimliche Mann, wie lachte er kalt und geisterhaft, lautlos und doch alles durch sein Lachen zertrümmernd! Mit innigem Vergnügen sah er meinen Qualen zu, drehte an den verfluchten Schrauben, rückte am Blechtrichter. Lachend ließ er die entstellte, entseelte und vergiftete Musik weiter in den Raum sickern, lachend gab er mir Antwort.","Oh, how the uncanny man was laughing, how cold and ghostly he was laughing, soundlessly and yet shattering everything with his laughter! He watched my torments with great pleasure, turned the damn screws, pulled the tin funnel. Laughing, he let the distorted, soulless and poisoned music continue to seep into the room, laughingly he gave me an answer.","How the weird man laughed! And what a cold and eerie laugh! It was noiseless and yet everything was shattered by it. He marked my torment with deep satisfaction while he bent over the cursed screws and attended to the tin trumpet. Laughing still, he let the distorted, the murdered and murderous music ooze out and on; and laughing still, he replied:","Oh, how he laughed now, this uncanny man! His laughter was cold, ghostly, noiseless, yet it was devastating, destructive of everything. Taking intense pleasure in tormenting me, he went on adjusting the damned screws of his wireless set and repositioning the metal horn speaker, thus ensuring that the distorted, lifeless, adulterated music went on seeping into the room.

"Immer unwirklicher wurde die vorige Szene, immer unglaublicher, daß diese Augen noch vor Minuten so schwer und grauenvoll gestarrt hatten. Oh, darin war Hermine wie das Leben selbst: stets nur Augenblick, nie im voraus zu berechnen. Jetzt aß sie, und das Entenbein und der Salat, die Torte und der Likör wurden ernst genommen, wurden zum Gegenstand von Freude und Urteil, von Gespräch und Phantasie. War der Teller weggetragen, so begann ein neues Kapitel. Diese Frau, die mich so vollkommen durchschaut hatte, die mehr über das Leben zu wissen schien als alle Weisen, betrieb das Kindsein, das kleine Lebensspiel des Augenblicks mit einer Kunst, die mich ohne weiteres zu ihrem Schüler machte. Mochte das nun hohe Weisheit sein oder einfachste Naivität: wer so dem Augenblick zu leben verstand, wer so gegenwärtig lebte und so freundlichsorgsam jede kleine Blume am Weg, jeden kleinen spielerischen Augenblickswert zu schätzen wußte, dem konnte das Leben nichts anhaben. Und dieses frohe Kind mit seinem guten Appetit, mit seiner spielerischen Feinschmeckerei sollte zugleich eine Träumerin und Hysterikerin sein, die sich den Tod wünschte, oder eine wachsame Rechnerin, die mich bewußt und kühlen Herzens verliebt und zu ihrem Sklaven machen wollte? Das konnte nicht sein. Nein, sie war einfach so ganz dem Augenblick ergeben, daß sie, ebenso wie jedem lustigen Einfall, auch jedem flüchtigen dunklen Schauer aus fernen Seelentiefen her offenstand und ihn sich ausleben ließ.","The previous scene became more and more unreal, more and more unbelievable that just a few minutes ago those eyes had stared so heavily and terribly. Oh, in that Hermione was like life itself: always momentary, never predictable. Now she ate, and the duck leg and the salad, the cake and the liqueur were taken seriously, became objects of joy and judgment, of conversation and imagination. Once the plate was carried away, a new chapter began. This woman, who had seen through me so completely, who seemed to know more about life than all wise men, pursued childhood, the little life game of the moment, with an art that immediately made me her pupil. Whether it be high wisdom or the simplest naivety: whoever knew how to live in the moment, who lived so presently and so kindly and carefully appreciated every little flower on the way, every little playful momentary value, life could not harm him. And this happy child with her good appetite, with her playful connoisseurship, was she supposed to be both a dreamer and a hysteric who wished for death, or a watchful calculator who consciously and coolly fell in love with me and wanted to make me her slave? That couldn't be. No, she was simply so totally devoted to the moment that she was open to every fleeting dark shiver from the far depths of the soul, just as she was to every funny idea and let it live out.","The scene that had gone before became more and more unreal. I was less and less able to believe that these were the same eyes that a moment before had been fixed in a dread obsession. But in this Hermine was like life itself, one moment succeeding to the next and not one to be foreseen. Now she was eating, and the duck and the salad, the sweet and the liqueur were the important thing, and each time the plates were changed a new chapter began. Yet though she played at being a child she had seen through me completely, and though she made me her pupil there and then in the game of living for each fleeting moment, she seemed to know more of life than is known to the wisest of the wise. It might be the highest wisdom or the merest artlessness. It is certain in any case that life is quite disarmed by the gift to live so entirely in the present, to treasure with such eager care every flower by the wayside and the light that plays on every passing moment. Was I to believe that this happy child with her hearty appetite and the air of a gourmet was at the same time a victim of hysterical visions who wished to die? or a careful calculating woman who, unmoved herself, had the conscious intention of making me her lover and her slave? I could not believe it. No, her surrender to the moment was so simple and complete that the fleeting shadows and agitation to the very depths of the soul came to her no less than every pleasurable impulse and were lived as fully.","The scene just before this seemed more and more divorced from reality. It was increasingly difficult to believe that only minutes ago these eyes of hers had been staring at me so gravely and frighteningly. In this respect, alas, Hermione was like life itself, forever fickle as the moment, never predictable in advance. Now she was eating, and the duck leg and the salad, the gateau and the liqueur were taken seriously, objects to rejoice in and pass judgement on, to discuss and go into flights of fancy about. Each plate that was taken away marked the beginning of a new chapter. This woman, who had seen through me so comprehensively, who seemed to know more of life than any wise men, was so skilled in behaving as a child, so adept at playing whatever little game life momentarily offered, that I automatically became her pupil. Whether it was wisdom of the highest order or the simplest form of naivety, it did not matter. Anyone knowing how to live for the moment, to live in the present as she did, treasuring every little wayside flower with loving care and deriving value from every playful little instant, had nothing to fear from life. How was I supposed to believe that this cheerful child with her healthy appetite and her playful attitude to wining and dining was at one and the same time a dreamer, a hysterical woman wishing herself dead, or a vigilant, calculating woman who deliberately and cold-bloodedly intended to make me fall in love with her and become her slave? That couldn’t possibly be the case. No, she was simply such a total creature of the moment that she was exposed not just to any amusing idea that occurred to her, but equally to any fleeting dark tremor from remote depths of the soul. And she lived both to the full."
"Schaudernd starrte ich auf die steingewordene Stirn, auf die starre Locke, auf den bleichkühlen Schimmer der Ohrmuschel. Die Kälte, die von ihnen ausströmte, war tödlich und war dennoch schön: sie klang, sie schwang wunderbar, sie war Musik! Hatte ich nicht einst, in einer frühern Zeit, schon einmal diesen Schauder gefühlt, der zugleich etwas wie Glück war? Hatte ich nicht schon einmal diese Musik vernommen? Ja, bei Mozart, bei den Unsterblichen.","I stared with a shudder at the stony forehead, at the rigid curls, at the pale, cool shimmer of the pinna. The cold that emanated from them was deadly and yet beautiful: it sounded, it vibrated beautifully, it was music! Hadn't I once, in an earlier time, felt this shudder, which was at the same time something like happiness? Hadn't I heard this music before? Yes, with Mozart, with the immortals.","With a shudder I stared at the stony brow and the stark hair and the cool pale shimmer of the ear. The cold that streamed from them was deathly and yet it was beautiful, it rang, it vibrated. It was music! Hadn't I once felt this shudder before and found it at the same time a joy? Hadn't I once caught this music before? Yes, with Mozart and the immortals.","Shuddering, I stared at Hermione’s petrified forehead, at her stiff curl of hair, at her coolly shimmering, pale, shell-shaped ear. The chilling cold they exuded was lethal, but beautiful nevertheless. It had a wonderful ring to it, splendid vibrations. It was music! Had I not already shuddered with cold like this once before, much earlier, and at the same time experienced something akin to happiness? Had I not heard this music once before? Yes, in Mozart’s presence, in the presence of the Immortals."
"Und von dem toten Gesicht, den toten weißen Schultern, den toten weißen Armen hauchte, langsam schleichend, ein Schauder aus, eine winterliche Öde und Einsamkeit, eine langsam, langsam wachsende Kälte, in der mir Hände und Lippen zu erstarren begannen. Hatte ich die Sonne ausgelöscht? Hatte ich das Herz alles Lebens getötet? Brach die Todeskälte des Weltraums herein?","And from the dead face, the dead white shoulders, the dead white arms, a shudder slowly crept out, a wintry desolation and loneliness, a slowly, slowly growing cold, in which my hands and lips began to freeze. Did I put out the sun? Had I killed the heart of all life? Did the deadly cold of space come?","And from the dead face, from the dead white shoulders and the dead white arms, there exhaled and slowly crept a shudder, a desert wintriness and desolation, a slowly, slowly increasing chill in which my hands and lips grew numb. Had I quenched the sun? Had I stopped the heart of all life? Was it the coldness of death and space breaking in?","And the dead face, the dead white shoulders, the dead white arms exuded a breath of cold air that slowly crept up on me, making me shudder. In this atmosphere of wintry desolation and isolation, this slowly, very slowly increasing chill, my hands and lips started to freeze. Had I extinguished the sun? Had I killed the heart of all life? Was this the deathly cold of outer space I could feel invading?"

"»Es ist natürlich eine Einbildung von dir«, sagte sie, sich zurück ins Heitere wandelnd, »oder, wenn du willst, eine Poesie. Aber es hat etwas. Heute bist du kein Wolf, aber neulich, wie du da in den Saal hereinkamst, wie vom Mond gefallen, da warst du schon so ein Stück Bestie, gerade das hat mir gefallen.«","'It's your imagination, of course,' she said, shifting back to cheerfulness, 'or, if you like, poetry. But there is something. You're not a wolf today, but the other day, when you came into the hall like you fell from the moon, you were already such a bit of a beast, that's what I liked.""","""That is, of course, your own fanciful idea,"" she said, becoming serene once more, ""or a poetical one, if you like. But there's something in it. You're no wolf today, but the other day when you came in as if you had fallen from the moon there was really something of the beast about you. It is just what struck me at the time.""","‘Of course it’s something you’ve imagined,’ she said, reverting suddenly to her cheerful self. ‘Or, if you like, a poetic fancy. But there is something to it. You’re not a wolf today, but when you walked into that ballroom the other day, looking like a zombie, there was indeed something of the beast about you. That’s exactly what appealed to me.’"
"»Es ist so. Ich tat meine Pflicht. Es war mein Amt. Ebenso wie es das Amt des Henkers ist, die von mir Verurteilten zu töten. Sie selbst haben ja das gleiche Amt übernommen.

"Unvergeßlicher Augenblick, als ich sie wiedersah! Ich saß an einem kleinen Tisch des alten behaglichen Restaurants, den ich unnötigerweise vorher telephonisch bestellt hatte, studierte die Speisekarte und hatte im Wasserglas zwei schöne Orchideen stehen, die ich für meine Freundin gekauft hatte. Ich mußte eine ganze Weile auf sie warten, fühlte mich aber ihres Kommens sicher und war nicht mehr erregt. Und nun kam sie, blieb vor der Garderobe stehen und grüßte mich nur durch einen aufmerksamen, etwas prüfenden Blick aus ihren hellgrauen Augen. Mißtrauisch kontrollierte ich, wie sich der Kellner gegen sie benehme. Nein, Gott sei Dank, keine Vertraulichkeit, kein Mangel an Distanz, er war tadellos höflich. Und doch kannten sie sich, sie nannte ihn Emil.","Unforgettable moment when I saw her again! I sat at a small table in the cozy old restaurant, which I had unnecessarily ordered in advance by telephone, studied the menu and had two beautiful orchids in my water glass that I had bought for my girlfriend. I had to wait for her for quite a while, but I felt sure of her coming and was no longer excited. And now she came, stopped in front of the cloakroom and only greeted me with an attentive, somewhat searching look from her light gray eyes. I checked suspiciously how the waiter behaved towards her. No, thank God, no intimacy, no lack of distance, he was immaculately polite. And yet they knew each other, she called him Emil.","Unforgettable moment when I saw her once more! I sat in the old-fashioned and comfortable restaurant at a small table that I had quite unnecessarily engaged by telephone, and studied the menu. In a tumbler were two orchids I had bought for my new acquaintance. I had a good while to wait, but I was sure she would come and was no longer agitated. And then she came. She stopped for a moment at the cloakroom and greeted me only by an observant and rather quizzical glance from her clear gray eyes. Distrustful, I took care to see how the waiter behaved towards her. No, there was nothing confidential, no lack of distance. He was scrupulously respectful. And yet they knew each other. She called him Emil.","What an unforgettable moment when I saw her again! Sitting at a small table in the old, comfortably appointed restaurant, having needlessly booked in advance by phone, I was studying the menu. In the water jug in front of me were two beautiful orchids that I had bought for her. Though I had to wait quite a while for her I felt sure she would come and was no longer agitated. And now she did come, pausing at the coat stand and merely casting an attentive, somewhat quizzical look of her light-grey eyes at me by way of a greeting. Suspicious, I checked carefully on the waiter’s behaviour towards her. Not a trace of familiarity, thank goodness. No, maintaining just the right degree of aloofness, he was politeness itself. And yet they knew each other; she addressed him as Emil."
"So ist denn auch, um es kurz zu sagen, der »Steppenwolf« eine Fiktion. Wenn Harry sich selbst als Wolfsmenschen empfindet und aus zwei feindlichen und gegensätzlichen Wesen zu bestehen meint, so ist das lediglich eine vereinfachende Mythologie. Harry ist gar kein Wolfsmensch, und wenn wir seine, von ihm selbst erfundene und geglaubte Lüge scheinbar unbesehen mit übernahmen und ihn tatsächlich als Doppelwesen, als Steppenwolf zu betrachten und zu deuten suchten, so machten wir uns in der Hoffnung auf leichteres Verstandenwerden eine Täuschung zunutze, deren Richtigstellung jetzt versucht werden soll.","So, to put it briefly, »Steppenwolf« is a fiction. When Harry thinks of himself as a wolf-man, consisting of two hostile and opposite beings, that is just simplistic mythology. Harry is not a wolf man at all, and when we took over his lie, which he invented and believed himself, apparently without looking at it, and actually tried to regard and interpret him as a double being, as a Steppenwolf, we made use of a deception in the hope of being easier to understand , whose correction will now be attempted.","So too, to come to the point, is the Steppenwolf a fiction. When Harry feels himself to be a were-wolf, and chooses to consist of two hostile and opposed beings, he is merely availing himself of a mythological simplification. He is no were-wolf at all, and if we appeared to accept without scrutiny this lie which he invented for himself and believes in, and tried to regard him literally as a two-fold being and a Steppenwolf, and so designated him, it was merely in the hope of being more easily understood with the assistance of a delusion, which we must now endeavor to put in its true light.","Thus, to come straight to the point, ‘Steppenwolf’ is a fiction too. If Harry feels himself to be a hybrid of wolf and human being, thinks he consists of two hostile and conflicting entities, that is merely a simplification, a myth. Harry is nothing of the kind. If when attempting to consider and interpret him as an actual hybrid, as a Steppenwolf, we appeared to adopt the tale he himself tells and believes in, we were resorting to deceit in the hope of making ourselves more easily understood. What now follows is an attempt to put things straight."

Ein kahler Hof zwischen vier Mauern mit kleinen vergitterten Fenstern, ein sauber hergerichtetes Fallbeil, ein Dutzend Herren in Talaren und Gehröcken, und inmitten stand ich fröstelnd in einer grauen Frühmorgenluft, das Herz zusammengezogen von jammervoller Bangigkeit, aber bereit und einverstanden. Auf Befehl trat ich vor, auf Befehl kniete ich nieder. Der Staatsanwalt nahm seine Mütze ab und räusperte sich, auch alle andern Herren räusperten sich. Er hielt ein feierliches Papier vor sich entfaltet, daraus las er vor:","and I nodded my agreement to that.

I stepped forward on command, knelt on command. The prosecutor took off his cap and cleared his throat, and all the other gentlemen cleared their throats too. He held out a ceremonial paper before him, from which he read:","and I consented with a nod. I stood in a bare yard enclosed by four walls with barred windows, and shivered in the air of a gray dawn.

"Und im letzten Augenblick wandte sie sich nochmals zu mir um und sagte: »Ich will dir noch etwas sagen, wegen des Goethe.

Look, I feel the same way about the saints, just as you felt with Goethe, that you couldn't bear the picture of him.""","Then at the last moment she turned once more and said: ""I'll tell you something else—about Goethe. What you felt about him and finding the picture of him more than you could put up with, I often feel about the saints.""","And at the last moment, turning round to me again, she said: ‘To go back to that Goethe story of yours, there’s one more thing you ought to know. You see, what you felt, not being able to stand that picture of him, is exactly what I sometimes feel about the saints.’"

"Wir kehrten in jenes erste Zimmer zurück, um Kaffee und Schnaps zu trinken, vielleicht würde uns das ein wenig aufhelfen. Aber da fiel der Dichterfürst mir wieder ins Auge, obwohl er beiseite auf eine Kommode gestellt worden war. Ich kam nicht los von ihm, und, nicht ohne warnende Stimmen in mir zu vernehmen, nahm ich ihn wieder in die Hand und begann mich mit ihm auseinanderzusetzen. Ich war wie besessen von dem Gefühl, daß die Situation unerträglich sei, daß es mir jetzt gelingen müsse, meine Wirte entweder zu erwärmen, mitzureißen und auf meinen Ton zu stimmen oder aber vollends eine Explosion herbeizuführen.","We went back to that first room for coffee and liquor, maybe that would cheer us up a bit. But then the Prince of Poets caught my eye again, even though he had been set aside on a chest of drawers. I couldn't get rid of him and, not without hearing warning voices inside me, I picked him up again and began to confront him. I became obsessed with the feeling that the situation was unbearable, that I must now be able to either warm my hosts, rouse them and tune them to my tone, or create a complete explosion.","We went back to the room we had come from to invoke the aid of coffee and cognac. There, however, my eye fell once more on the magnate of poetry, although he had been put on a chest of drawers at one side of the room.

I was as though obsessed by the feeling that the situation was intolerable and that the time had come either to warm my hosts up, to carry them off their feet and put them in tune with myself, or else to bring about a final explosion.","We went back into the first room for coffee and schnapps, which, I thought, might buck us up a bit. But there, although he had been put to one side on a chest of drawers, the prince among writers caught my eye again.

"Haller sah mich an, und ich merkte, daß ich ihn aus einer Art von Traumzustand geweckt hatte. Langsam begann er zu lächeln, sein hübsches und jämmerliches Lächeln, mit dem er mir so oft das Herz schwer gemacht hat, dann lud er mich ein, mich neben ihn zu setzen. Ich dankte und sagte, ich sei nicht gewohnt, auf der Treppe vor anderer Leute Wohnungen zu sitzen.","Haller looked at me and I realized that I had awakened him from a kind of dream state.

Von allem, was mir an ihr gefiel und mich bezauberte, war dies das hübscheste und eigenartigste, daß sie ganz plötzlich vom tiefsten Ernst zur drolligsten Lustigkeit übergehen konnte und umgekehrt und sich dabei gar nicht änderte und verzerrte, es war wie bei einem begabten Kind. Jetzt war sie eine Weile lustig, neckte mich mit dem Foxtrott, stieß mich sogar mit den Füßen an, lobte das Essen mit Eifer, bemerkte, daß ich mir mit dem Anziehen Mühe gegeben habe, hatte aber noch eine Menge an meinem Äußeren auszusetzen.","She nodded radiantly, glad of my guess. The soup just came, we began to eat, and it was childishly enjoyed. Of all the things I liked and enchanted about her, this was the prettiest and strangest, that she could suddenly go from the deepest seriousness to the most comical merriment and vice versa and not change and distort at all, it was like a gifted child.

At that moment the waiter brought the food and we began to eat. She was as happy as a child. Of all the things that pleased and charmed me about her, the prettiest and most characteristic was her rapid changes from the deepest seriousness to the drollest merriment, and this without doing herself the least violence, with the facility of a gifted child. Now for a while she was merry and chaffed me about the fox trot, trod on my feet under the table, enthusiastically praised the meal, remarked on the care I had taken dressing, though she also had many criticisms to make on my appearance.","She nodded, beaming with joy at the fact that I had guessed correctly. The soup was just arriving and, as we started our meal, she began to take a childlike pleasure in everything. Of all the things that I liked and found fascinating about her, the most charming and idiosyncratic was her ability to switch from being deeply serious to extremely funny. Yet she remained entirely herself, just as gifted children do, showing no signs of strain. She was now funny for a while, teasing me about the foxtrot and even giving me the odd kick under the table. She was lavish in her praise of the food, remarked that I had gone to some trouble to look my best, but still found a great deal to criticize in my appearance."

"Es war Hermine, nur wenig umfrisiert und leicht geschminkt, apart und bleich blickte ihr kluges Gesicht aus dem modischen Stehkragen, wunderlich klein kamen ihre Hände aus den weiten schwarzen Frackärmeln und weißen Manschetten hervor, wunderlich zierlich, in schwarz-weißen seidenen Herrensocken, ihre Füße aus den langen schwarzen Hosen.","It was Hermione, only slightly changed hair and light make-up, distinctive and pale, her intelligent face looked out of the fashionable stand-up collar, her hands came out strangely small from the wide black dress coat sleeves and white cuffs, strangely delicate, in black and white silk men's socks, her feet from the long black trousers.","It was Hermine, barely disguised by the make-up of her hair and a little paint.

"Das Zeitgefühl war mir verlorengegangen, ich weiß nicht, wieviel Stunden oder Augenblicke dies Rauschglück dauerte. Auch bemerkte ich es nicht, daß das Fest, je glühender es wurde, sich auf desto engerem Raum zusammenzog. Die meisten waren schon fortgegangen, in den Korridoren war es still geworden, und viele der Lichter waren erloschen, das Treppenhaus lag ausgestorben, in den oberen Sälen war eine Musikkapelle um die andere verstummt und weggegangen; nur im Hauptsaal und in der Hölle unten tobte noch, beständig an Glut sich steigernd, der bunte Festrausch. Da ich mit Hermine, dem Jüngling, nicht tanzen durfte, hatten wir uns immer nur in Tanzpausen flüchtig wieder getroffen und begrüßt, und zuletzt war sie mir ganz und gar entschwunden, nicht dem Auge nur, sogar den Gedanken. Es gab keine Gedanken mehr. Aufgelöst schwamm ich im trunkenen Tanzgewühl, von Düften, Tönen, Seufzern, Worten berührt, von fremden Augen begrüßt, befeuert, von fremden Gesichtern, Lippen, Wangen, Armen, Brüsten, Knien umgeben, von der Musik wie eine Welle im Takt hin und wider geworfen. Nun sah ich plötzlich, einen Augenblick halb erwachend, unter den letzten, noch gebliebenen Gästen, die jetzt einen der kleinen Säle überfüllten, den letzten, in dem noch Musik erklang – nun sah ich plötzlich eine schwarze Pierrette mit weißgemaltem Gesicht, ein schönes frisches Mädchen, als einzige mit einer Gesichtsmaske bedeckt, eine entzückende Figur, die ich in dieser ganzen Nacht noch nie gesehen hatte. Während allen andern die späte Stunde anzusehen war, den roten erhitzten Gesichtern, den zerdrückten Kostümen, den verwelkten Kragen und Krausen, stand die schwarze Pierrette, frisch und neu mit dem weißen Gesicht hinter der Maske, in faltenlosem Kostüm, mit unberührter Krause, blanken Spitzenmanschetten und frischer Frisur. Es zog mich zu ihr, ich umfaßte sie, zog sie in den Tanz, duftend kitzelte ihre Krause mein Kinn, streifte ihr Haar meine Wange, zarter und inniger als jede andre Tänzerin dieser Nacht kam ihr straffer junger Leib meinen Bewegungen entgegen, wich ihnen aus, zwang und lockte sie spielend zu immer neuen Berührungen. Und plötzlich, während ich mich im Tanzen niederbeugte und ihren Mund mit meinem suchte, lächelte dieser Mund überlegen und altvertraut, ich erkannte das feste Kinn, erkannte glücklich die Schultern, die Ellbogen, die Hände. Es war Hermine, nicht mehr Hermann, umgekleidet, frisch, leicht parfümiert und gepudert. Glühend trafen unsre Lippen zusammen, einen Augenblick schmiegte ihr ganzer Leib, bis hinab zu den Knien, sich verlangend und hingegeben an mich an, dann entzog sie mir ihren Mund und tanzte zurückhaltend und fliehend. Als die Musik abbrach, blieben wir umschlungen stehen, alle die entzündeten Paare rings um uns klatschten, stampften, schrien, peitschten die erschöpfte Kapelle zur Wiederholung des Yearning auf. Und nun fühlten wir alle plötzlich den Morgen, sahen das fahle Licht hinter den Vorhängen, spürten das nahe Ende der Lust, ahnten die kommende Müdigkeit und stürzten uns blind, auflachend und verzweifelt nochmals in den Tanz, in die Musik, in die Lichtflut, schritten tobend im Takt, Paar an Paar gepreßt, fühlten noch einmal selig die große Woge über uns zusammenschlagen. In diesem Tanz ließ Hermine ihre Überlegenheit, ihren Spott, ihre Kühle fahren – sie wußte, daß sie nichts mehr zu tun brauche, um mich verliebt zu machen. Ich gehörte ihr. Und sie gab sich hin, im Tanz, im Blick, im Kuß, im Lächeln. Alle Frauen dieser fiebernden Nacht, alle, mit denen ich getanzt, alle, die ich entzündet, alle, die mich entzündet hatten, alle, um die ich geworben, alle, an die ich mich verlangend geschmiegt, alle, denen ich mit Liebessehnsucht nachgeblickt hatte, waren zusammengeschmolzen und eine einzige geworden, die in meinen Armen blühte.","I had lost my sense of time, I don't know how many hours or moments this intoxicated happiness lasted. I also didn't notice that the more glowing the festival became, the smaller the space. Most had already left, the corridors had grown quiet and many of the lights had gone out, the stairwell was dead, in the upper halls one band after the other had fallen silent and gone; only in the main hall and in hell below was the colorful festive frenzy still raging, constantly increasing in embers. Since I wasn't allowed to dance with Hermione, the young man, we only met and greeted each other briefly during breaks in the dance, and in the end she had disappeared from me completely, not only to the eye, even to the thought. There were no more thoughts. Dissolved, I swam in the drunken crowd of dances, touched by scents, sounds, sighs, words, greeted by strange eyes, fired up, surrounded by strange faces, lips, cheeks, arms, breasts, knees, back and forth by the music like a wave to the beat thrown. Suddenly, half awakening for a moment, I saw, among the last remaining guests who were now crowding one of the small halls, the last one in whom music was still playing - now I suddenly saw a black Pierrette with a face painted white, a beautiful fresh girl , the only one covered with a face mask, an adorable character I hadn't seen all night. While everyone else could see the late hour, the red flushed faces, the crushed costumes, the withered collars and frills, the black Pierrette stood, fresh and new with the white face behind the mask, in a wrinkle-free suit, with untouched frills, shiny lace cuffs and a fresh hairstyle. I was drawn to her, I embraced her, pulled her into the dance, her frills fragrantly tickled my chin, her hair brushed my cheek, her taut young body met my movements more tenderly and intimately than any other dancer that night, avoided them , forced and lured her playfully to ever new touches. And suddenly, as I bent down to dance and searched her mouth with mine, that mouth smiled superiorly and familiarly, I recognized the firm chin, happily recognized the shoulders, the elbows, the hands. It was Hermione, no longer Hermann, changed clothes, fresh, lightly perfumed and powdered. Our lips met glowingly, for a moment her whole body, down to her knees, snuggled up to me, longing and devoted, then she pulled her mouth away from me and danced reservedly and fleeing. When the music stopped, we stood in each other's arms, all the inflamed couples around us clapping, stomping, screaming, whipping the exhausted band up for a repeat of the yearning. And now we all suddenly felt the morning, saw the pale light behind the curtains, felt the near end of our desire, sensed the coming tiredness and blindly, laughing and desperate, threw ourselves again into the dance, into the music, into the flood of light, stepping raging to the beat, couples pressed against couples, once again blissfully felt the great wave crashing over us. In that dance, Hermione let go of her superiority, her mockery, her coolness - she knew she didn't have to do anything more to make me love me. i was hers And she gave herself, in the dance, in the look, in the kiss, in the smile. All the women of that feverish night, everyone I danced with, everyone I lit, everyone who had lit me, everyone I wooed, everyone I snuggled up to longingly, everyone I looked after with longing love , had melted together and become one, blooming in my arms.","I had lost the sense of time, and I don't know how many hours or moments the intoxication of happiness lasted. I did not observe either that the brighter the festal fire burned the narrower were the limits within which it was confined. Most people had already left. The corridors were silent and many of the lights out. The stairs were deserted and in the rooms above one orchestra after another had stopped playing and gone away. It was only in the principal room and in Hell below that the orgy still raged in a crescendo. Since I could not dance with Hermine as a boy, we had only had fleeting encounters in the pauses between the dances, and at last I lost sight of her entirely—and not only sight but thought. There were no thoughts left. I was lost in the maze and whirl of the dance. Scents and tones and sighs and words stirred me. I was greeted and kindled by strange eyes, encircled by strange faces, borne hither and thither in time to the music as though by a wave. And then of a sudden I saw, half coming to my senses for a moment, among the last who still kept it up in one of the smaller rooms, and filled it to overflowing—the only one in which the music still sounded—of a sudden I saw a black Pierrette with face painted white. She was fresh and charming, the only masked figure left and a bewitching apparition that I had never in the whole course of the night seen before. While in everyone else the late hour showed itself in flushed and heated faces, crushed dresses, limp collars and crumpled ruffs, the black Pierrette stood there fresh and neat with her white face beneath her mask. Her costume had not a crease and not a hair was out of place. Her ruff and pointed cuffs were untouched. I rushed towards her, put my arms around her, and drew her into the dance. Her perfumed ruff tickled my chin. Her hair brushed my cheek. The young vigor of her body answered my movements as no one else's had done that night, yielding to them with an inward tenderness and compelling them to new contacts by the play of her allurements. I bent down to kiss her mouth as we danced. Its smile was triumphant and long familiar. Of a sudden I recognized the firm chin, the shoulders, arms and hands. It was Hermine, Herman no longer. Hermine in a change of dress, fresh, perfumed, powdered. Our lips met passionately. For a moment her whole body to her knees clung in longing and surrender to mine. Then she drew her mouth away and, holding back, fled from me as we danced. When the music broke off we were still clasped where we stood. All the excited couples round us clapped, stamped, cried out and urged the exhausted orchestra to play ""Yearning"" over again. And now a feeling that it was morning fell upon us all. We saw the ashen light behind the curtains. It warned us of pleasure's approaching end and gave us symptoms of the weariness to come. Blindly, with bursts of laughter, we flung ourselves desperately into the dance once more, into the music and the light that began to flood the room. Our feet moved in time to the music as though we were possessed, every couple touching, and once more we felt the great wave of bliss break over us. Hermine abandoned her triumphant air, her mockery and coolness. She knew that there was no more to do to make me in love with her. I was hers, and her way of dancing, her looks and smiles and kisses all showed that she gave herself to me. All the women of this fevered night, all that I had danced with, all whom I had kindled or who had kindled me, all whom I had courted, all who had clung to me with longing, all whom I had followed with enraptured eyes were melted together and had become one, the one whom I held in my arms.","I had lost all sense of time. I don’t know how many hours or moments this euphoric happiness of mine lasted. It also escaped my notice that the festivities, the more feverish they became, were concentrated in an ever-more confined area of the building. Most of the guests had already left, the corridors were now silent, and many of the lights had gone out. The staircase to the first floor was deserted, in the upper rooms one band after another had ceased playing and departed. Only in the main dance hall and down in hell were the frantic drunken revels still going on, and their fever was rising steadily. Since I could not dance with Hermione in her young man’s clothes, we had only briefly encountered and greeted each other during breaks between dances and in the end she had vanished completely, not just from my sight, but also from my thoughts. I no longer had any thoughts. I was beside myself, floating along in the drunken throng of dancers; affected by scents, colours, sights and snatches of conversation; in receipt of welcoming and inspiriting looks from strangers, surrounded by strange faces, lips, cheeks, arms, breasts and knees; flung backwards and forwards like a wave to the rhythm of the music. Half emerging from my reverie for a moment, I suddenly spotted among the remaining guests, who were now crammed into one of the small rooms, the last one where music was being played, a dark-haired Pierrette, her face painted white. She was a beautiful, fresh-looking girl, the only one wearing a mask, a delightful creature that I had not once set eyes on during the whole night. Whereas you could tell just how late it was from the appearance of everyone else, their ruddy faces, their crumpled costumes, their limp collars and ruffs, the dark-haired Pierrette, her white face covered by a mask, was standing there looking as fresh as a daisy. There wasn’t a crease in her costume, her ruff was immaculate, her lace cuffs shone, and not a hair on her head was out of place. Irresistibly attracted to her, I took her in my arms and drew her on to the dance floor. Her sweet-smelling ruff tickling my chin , her hair brushing my cheek, with her taut young body she responded to my movements more delicately and intimately than any other partner I had danced with that night, now ducking away from me, now playfully luring me into continually renewed physical contact. And all of a sudden, when bending down and seeking her lips with mine as we danced, I saw those lips break into a superior smile, familiar to me of old. Now I recognized the firm chin, rejoiced to recognize the shoulders, the elbows, the hands. It wasn’t Hermann any more, but Hermione, in a change of clothes, refreshed by a hint of perfume and a touch of face powder. Our lips met in a passionate kiss, and in a momentary gesture of longing and surrender, she pressed her whole body up against me, as far down as her knees, before withdrawing her lips and retreating to dance at a greater distance. When the music stopped we stood there, still in an embrace, and all the flushed couples around us clapped, stamped their feet and shouted out, goading the exhausted band to play an encore of ‘Yearning’. And now, suddenly feeling the approach of dawn, seeing its pale light behind the curtains, and sensing that our enjoyment was coming to an end, soon to be replaced by tiredness, we all threw ourselves blindly into one last desperate dance, laughing out loud as we entered the swell of music and light. It was a romp. We strode along to the beat, couple upon couple tightly pressed together, all feeling the great wave of blissful happiness breaking over us again. During this dance Hermione abandoned her air of superiority and cool disdain, knowing that no further effort was required to make me fall in love with her. I was hers, and this showed in the way she danced, the look in her eyes, the smile on her face, and her kisses, all of which were unrestrained. All the women of that fervid night, all those who had aroused my passion, all those I had made a play for or lusted after from afar, had now merged into just one, and she was bursting into flower in my arms."

"»Die Frommen«, fuhr sie nachdenklich fort, »haben doch am meisten davon gewußt. Sie haben darum die Heiligen aufgestellt und das, was sie ›die Gemeinschaft der Heiligen‹ heißen. Die Heiligen, das sind die echten Menschen, die jüngeren Brüder des Heilands. Zu ihnen unterwegs sind wir unser Leben lang, mit jeder guten Tat, mit jedem tapferen Gedanken, mit jeder Liebe. Die Gemeinschaft der Heiligen, die wurde in früheren Zeiten von den Malern dargestellt in einem goldenen Himmel, strahlend, schön und friedevoll – sie ist nichts andres als das, was ich vorher die ›Ewigkeit‹ genannt habe. Es ist das Reich jenseits der Zeit und des Scheins. Dorthin gehören wir, dort ist unsre Heimat, dorthin strebt unser Herz, Steppenwolf, und darum sehnen wir uns nach dem Tod. Dort findest du deinen Goethe wieder und deinen Novalis und den Mozart, und ich meine Heiligen, den Christoffer, den Philipp von Neri und alle. Es gibt viele Heilige, die zuerst arge Sünder waren, auch die Sünde kann ein Weg zur Heiligkeit sein, die Sünde und das Laster. Du wirst lachen, aber ich denke mir oft, daß vielleicht auch mein Freund Pablo ein versteckter Heiliger sein könnte. Ach Harry, wir müssen durch so viel Dreck und Unsinn tappen, um nach Hause zu kommen! Und wir haben niemand, der uns führt, unser einziger Führer ist das Heimweh.« Ihre letzten Worte hatte sie wieder ganz leise gesprochen, und jetzt war es friedlich still in dem Zimmer, die Sonne war am Untergehen und machte die Goldschriften auf den vielen Bücherrücken meiner Bibliothek schimmern. Ich nahm Herminens Kopf in meine Hände, küßte sie auf die Stirn und lehnte ihn Wange an Wange zu mir, geschwisterlich, so blieben wir einen Augenblick. Am liebsten wäre ich so geblieben und heute nicht mehr ausgegangen. Aber für diese Nacht, die letzte vor dem großen Ball, hatte Maria sich mir versprochen.","'The pious,' she continued thoughtfully, 'knew most about it. That is why they set up the saints and what they call 'the communion of saints'. The saints are the real people, the younger brothers of the Savior. We are on our way to them all our lives, with every good deed, with every brave thought, with every love. The community of saints, which was depicted by painters in earlier times in a golden sky, radiant, beautiful and peaceful - it is nothing other than what I previously called 'eternity'. It is the realm beyond time and appearances. That's where we belong, that's where our home is, that's where our heart strives, Steppenwolf, and that's why we long for death. There you will find your Goethe again and your Novalis and Mozart, and I mean Saints, Christoffer, Philipp von Neri and all. There are many saints who were first bad sinners, sin can also be a way to holiness, sin and vice. You'll laugh, but I often think to myself that maybe my friend Pablo could also be a hidden saint. Oh Harry, we have to grope through so much dirt and nonsense to get home! And we have no one to guide us, our only guide is homesickness.” She had spoken her last words very softly again, and now it was peacefully quiet in the room, the sun was setting and made the gold writing on the many spines of books shimmer in my library. I took Hermione's head in my hands, kissed her forehead and leaned him cheek to cheek to me, brotherly, we stayed like that for a moment. I would have preferred to have stayed that way and not gone out today. But for that night, the last before the big ball, Maria had promised me.","""The pious,"" she went on meditatively, ""after all know most about this. That is why they set up the saints and what they call the communion of the saints. The saints, these are the true men, the younger brothers of the Savior. We are with them all our lives long in every good deed, in every brave thought, in every love. The communion of the saints, in earlier times it was set by painters in a golden heaven, shining, beautiful and full of peace, and it is nothing else but what I meant a moment ago when I called it eternity. It is the kingdom on the other side of time and appearances. It is there we belong. There is our home. It is that which our heart strives for. And for that reason, Steppenwolf, we long for death. There you will find your Goethe again and Novalis and Mozart, and I my saints, Christopher, Philip of Neri and all. There are many saints who at first were sinners. Even sin can be a way to saintliness, sin and vice. You will laugh at me, but I often think that even my friend Pablo might be a saint in hiding. Ah, Harry, we have to stumble, through so much dirt and humbug before we reach home. And we have no one to guide us. Our only guide is our homesickness."" With the last words her voice had sunk again and now there was a stillness of peace in the room. The sun was setting; it lit up the gilt lettering on the back of my books. I took Hermine's head in my hands and kissed her on the forehead and leaned my cheek to hers as though she were my sister, and so we stayed for a moment. And so I should have liked best to stay and to have gone out no more that day. But Maria had promised me this night, the last before the great Ball.","‘True believers,’ she continued, deep in thought, ‘of course knew more than anyone about this. That’s why they established the saints and what they call the communion of saints. The saints, they are the authentic human beings, the Saviour’s younger brethren. Our lives are one long journey towards them; our every good deed, every bold thought, every act of love is a stage along that road. In times gone by painters portrayed the communion of saints in the setting of a golden heaven where all was radiant, beautiful and full of peace, which is precisely what I earlier called “eternity”. It is the realm beyond time and appearances. That is where we belong, it is the home we are striving with all our heart to reach, Steppenwolf, and that’s why we long for death. It is where you will rediscover your Goethe, your Novalis and Mozart, and I my saints, St Christopher, St Philip Neri and all the rest. There are lots of saints who were bad sinners to begin with. Sin too can be a pathway to sanctity, sin and vice. Don’t laugh, but I often think even my friend Pablo might be a secret saint. Sadly, Harry, we have to grope our way through so much filth and rubbish in order to reach home! And we have no one to show us the way. Homesickness is our only guide.’ As she uttered these final words her voice had become quite quiet again, and now all was peacefully silent in my room. The gilt lettering on the spines of the many books that made up my library was gleaming in the rays of the setting sun. Taking Hermione’s head in my hands, I kissed her forehead, then rested her cheek against mine, as a brother might his sister’s. We remained like this for a moment. I would have much preferred to stay close to her in this way and not to venture out again that day, but Maria had promised to spend the night with me, the last one before the Grand Ball."

"Wunderlich – so sagenhaft und zugleich so tief vertraut, daß ich aufschauerte – kam mir hier der Duft meiner Jugend entgegengeweht, die Atmosphäre meiner Knaben- und Jünglingszeit, und in meinem Herzen floß das Blut von damals. Was ich eben noch getan und gedacht hatte und gewesen war, sank hinter mir hinab, und ich war wieder jung. Noch vor einer Stunde, noch vor Augenblicken hatte ich recht wohl zu wissen geglaubt, was Liebe, was Begehren, was Sehnsucht sei, aber das war die Liebe und Sehnsucht eines alten Mannes gewesen. Jetzt war ich wieder jung, und was ich in mir fühlte, dieses glühend fließende Feuer, diese gewaltig ziehende Sehnsucht, diese wie Tauwind im März auflösende Leidenschaft, war jung, neu und echt. O, wie brannten die vergessenen Feuer wieder auf, wie schwellend und dunkel klangen die Töne des Ehemals, wie blühte es flackernd im Blut, wie schrie es und sang in der Seele! Ich war ein Knabe, fünfzehn oder sechzehn Jahre alt, mein Kopf war voll von Latein und Griechisch und schönen Dichterversen, meine Gedanken voll von Streben und Ehrgeiz, meine Phantasien voll von Künstlertraum, aber viel tiefer, stärker und furchtbarer als all diese lodernden Feuer brannte und zuckte in mir das Feuer der Liebe, der Hunger des Geschlechts, die zehrende Vorahnung der Wolllust.","Strangely - so legendary and at the same time so deeply familiar that I shuddered - the scent of my youth wafted towards me, the atmosphere of my boyhood and youth, and the blood of those days flowed in my heart. What I had just done and thought and been sank behind me and I was young again. Just an hour ago, just moments ago, I had thought I knew what love, what desire, what longing was, but that was the love and longing of an old man. Now I was young again, and what I felt inside me, this glowing, flowing fire, this powerful longing, this passion that dissolved like a thaw in March, was young, new, and real. Oh, how the forgotten fires burned up again, how swelling and dark rang the tones of the past, how flickering it bloomed in the blood, how it screamed and sang in the soul! I was a boy, fifteen or sixteen years old, my head was full of Latin and Greek and beautiful poetic verses, my thoughts full of aspiration and ambition, my fantasies full of artistic dreams, but much deeper, stronger and more terrible than all those blazing fires were burning and twitched in me the fire of love, the hunger of sex, the consuming anticipation of lust.","The fragrance of spring-time met me. The very atmosphere of boyhood and youth, so deeply familiar and yet so legendary, was around me and in my veins flowed the blood of those days. All that I had done and thought and been since, fell away from me and I was young again. An hour, a few minutes before, I had prided myself on knowing what love was and desire and longing, but it had been the love and the longing of an old man. Now I was young again and this glowing current of fire that I felt in me, this mighty impulse, this unloosening passion like that wind in March that brings the thaw, was young and new and genuine. How the flame that I had forgotten leaped up again, how darkly stole on my ears the tones of long ago! My blood was on fire, and blossomed forth as my soul cried aloud and sang. I was a boy of fifteen or sixteen with my head full of Latin and Greek and poetry. I was all ardor and ambition and my fancy was laden with the artist's dreams. But far deeper and stronger and more awful than all there burned and leaped in me the flame of love, the hunger of sex, the fever and the foreboding of desire.","Here, strange to say, what greeted me was the sweet fragrance of my youth, the atmosphere of my boyhood and adolescence, and I felt the young blood of those days flowing through my veins. So unbelievable was it and yet at the same time deeply familiar, it sent shivers down my spine. All the things I had done, thought and been only a short time ago sank into oblivion, and I was young once more. Only an hour, only moments ago, I had thought I knew perfectly well what love, what desire, what longing was, but that had been the love and longing of an old man. Now I was young again, and all that I was feeling inside me, this red-hot lava, this powerful tug of yearning, this passion melting the ice like a warm March wind, was young, fresh and genuine. Oh, how the forgotten fires were suddenly rekindled; how the sounds of yesteryear came swelling darkly back! What fresh life was quivering in my pulse, what cries and songs were filling my soul! I was a boy of fifteen or sixteen, my head was full of Latin and Greek, and beautiful lines of poetry. Effort and ambition dominated my thinking, the dream of becoming an artist my imagination. But what was burning and flickering at a much deeper level than all these smouldering fires was the flame of love, sexual hunger, an all-consuming premonition of lust."
"Ich hatte nicht das Glück, Marias einziger oder bevorzugter Geliebter zu sein, ich war einer von mehreren. Oft hatte sie keine Zeit für mich, manchmal eine Stunde am Nachmittag, wenige Male eine Nacht. Sie wollte kein Geld von mir nehmen, dahinter steckte wohl Hermine. Aber Geschenke nahm sie gerne, und wenn ich ihr etwa ein neues kleines Portemonnaie aus rotlackiertem Leder schenkte, durften auch zwei, drei Goldstücke darin stecken. Übrigens mit dem roten Geldbeutelchen wurde ich von ihr sehr ausgelacht! Es war entzückend, aber es war ein Ladenhüter, verschollene Mode. In diesen Dingen, von welchen ich bisher weniger gewußt und verstanden hatte als von irgendeiner Eskimosprache, lernte ich von Maria viel. Ich lernte vor allem, daß diese kleinen Spielzeuge, Mode- und Luxussachen nicht bloß Tand und Kitsch sind und eine Erfindung geldgieriger Fabrikanten und Händler, sondern berechtigt, schön, mannigfaltig, eine kleine oder vielmehr große Welt von Dingen, welche alle den einzigen Zweck haben, der Liebe zu dienen, die Sinne zu verfeinern, die tote Umwelt zu beleben und zauberhaft mit neuen Liebesorganen zu begaben, vom Puder und Parfüm bis zum Tanzschuh, vom Fingerring bis zur Zigarettendose, von der Gürtelschnalle bis zur Handtasche. Diese Tasche war keine Tasche, der Geldbeutel kein Geldbeutel, Blumen keine Blumen, der Fächer kein Fächer, alles war plastisches Material der Liebe, der Magie, der Reizung, war Bote, Schleichhändler, Waffe, Schlachtruf.","I wasn't lucky enough to be Maria's only or preferred lover, I was one of several. Often she had no time for me, sometimes an hour in the afternoon, a few times a night. She didn't want to take any money from me, Hermione was probably behind it. But she was happy to accept presents, and if I gave her a new, small purse made of red lacquered leather, two or three pieces of gold could also be in it. By the way, she laughed at me a lot with the red purse! It was lovely, but it was a slow-moving, long-lost fashion. In these things, of which I had hitherto known and understood less than any Eskimo language, I learned a great deal from Maria. Above all, I learned that these little toys, fashion and luxury things are not just trinkets and kitsch and an invention of greedy manufacturers and dealers, but justified, beautiful, diverse, a small or rather large world of things, all of which have a single purpose , to serve love, to refine the senses, to revitalize the dead environment and magically endow it with new love organs, from powder and perfume to dancing shoes, from finger rings to cigarette cases, from belt buckles to handbags. This bag wasn't a bag, the purse wasn't a purse, flowers weren't flowers, the fan wasn't a fan, everything was plastic material of love, magic, excitement, it was a messenger, a smuggler, a weapon, a battle cry.","It was not my fortune to be Maria's only lover, nor even her favorite one. I was one of many. Often she had no time for me, often only an hour at midday, seldom a night. She took no money from me. Hermine saw to that. She was glad of presents, however, and when I gave her, perhaps, a new little purse of red lacquered leather there might be two or three gold pieces inside it. As a matter of fact, she laughed at me over the red purse. It was charming, but a bargain, and no longer in fashion. In these matters, about which up to that time I was as little learned as in any language of the Eskimos, I learned a great deal from Maria. Before all else I learned that these playthings were not mere idle trifles invented by manufacturers and dealers for the purposes of gain. They were, on the contrary, a little or, rather, a big world, authoritative and beautiful, many sided, containing a multiplicity of things all of which had the one and only aim of serving love, refining the senses, giving life to the dead world around us, endowing it in a magical way with new instruments of love, from powder and scent to the dancing show, from ring to cigarette case, from waist-buckle to handbag. This bag was no bag, this purse no purse, flowers no flowers, the fan no fan. All were the plastic material of love, of magic and delight. Each was a messenger, a smuggler, a weapon, a battle cry.","I was not fortunate enough to be Maria’s sole or preferred lover. I was one of several. Often she found no time for me, sometimes one hour in the afternoon, on very few occasions a whole night. She refused to take money from me, which was probably Hermione’s doing. However, she was happy to accept gifts and when, for instance, I gave her a dainty new purse made of shiny red leather she didn’t object to the two or three gold coins it contained. That little red purse, by the way, prompted her to laugh right in my face because, charming though it was, it was long since out of fashion and no longer selling well. From Maria I learned a great deal about matters such as this, about which previously I had known and understood less than I did any Eskimo language. Above all I learned that these little playthings, fashionable accessories and luxuries are not just tawdry kitsch, invented by money-grabbing manufacturers and dealers, but quite legitimate, beautiful and diverse objects. They constitute a small, or rather large, world of things, all of them designed with the sole aim of serving Eros, refining the senses, breathing fresh life into the dead world we inhabit and magically endowing it with new sexual organs, from powder and perfume to dance shoes, from rings to cigarette cases, from belt buckles to handbags. These handbags were not handbags, the purses not purses, flowers not flowers, fans not fans – no, all of them were the visual and tangible material of Eros, of magic, of stimulation. They functioned as messengers, touts, weapons, battle cries."
"Angstvoll lief ich auf und ab, spürte den Geschmack von Blut und den Geschmack von Schokolade im Munde, einen ebenso häßlich wie den andern, wünschte sehnsüchtig dieser trüben Welle zu entrinnen, rang inbrünstig in mir selbst um erträglichere, freundlichere Bilder. »O Freunde, nicht diese Töne!« sang es in mir, und mit Entsetzen erinnerte ich mich an jene scheußlichen Photographien von der Front, die man während des Krieges zuweilen zu Gesicht bekommen hatte, an jene Haufen ineinander verknäuelter Leichname, deren Gesichter durch Gasmasken in grinsende Teufelsfratzen verwandelt waren. Wie war ich damals noch dumm und kindlich gewesen, als ich mich, ein menschenfreundlich gesinnter Kriegsgegner, über diese Bilder entsetzt hatte! Heute wußte ich, daß kein Tierbändiger, kein Minister, kein General, kein Irrsinniger Gedanken und Bilder in seinem Gehirn auszubrüten fähig war, die nicht ebenso scheußlich, ebenso wild und böse, ebenso roh und dumm in mir selber wohnten.","I paced up and down in fear, feeling the taste of blood and the taste of chocolate in my mouth, each as ugly as the next, wishing longingly to escape from this gloomy wave, struggling fervently within myself for more tolerable, friendlier images. ""Oh friends, not these tones!"" I sang inside me, and I remembered with horror those horrid photographs from the front that one had sometimes seen during the war, those heaps of corpses knotted together, their faces through gas masks turned into grinning devil faces. How stupid and childish I was back then when I, a philanthropic opponent of the war, was horrified by these pictures! Today I knew that no animal tamer, no minister, no general, no madman was capable of hatching thoughts and images in his brain that did not live in me just as hideously, just as wildly and evilly, just as crudely and stupidly.","In fear I hurried this way and that. I had the taste of blood and chocolate in my mouth, the one as hateful as the other. I desired nothing but to be beyond this wave of disgust. I wrestled with myself for more bearable, friendlier pictures. "" O Friend, not these notes!"" sang in my head, and with horror I remembered those terrible photographs from the Front that one saw occasionally during the war—those heaps of bodies entangled with each other, whose faces were changed to grinning ghouls by their gas masks. How silly and childish of me, a humanely minded opponent of war though I was, to have been horrified by those pictures. Today I knew that no tamer of beasts, no general, no insane person could hatch a thought or a picture in his brain that I could not match myself with one every bit as frightful, every bit as savage and wicked, as crude and stupid.","I walked anxiously to and fro, my mouth tasting of blood and chocolate, the one just as nasty as the other. Longing to escape these troubled waters, I struggled inwardly with all my might to conjure up more tolerable, more congenial images. The line ‘O friends, not these tones!’14 resounded in my head, and I remembered with horror those appalling photographs taken at the front that one had occasionally glimpsed during the war, those piles of tangled corpses, their faces transformed into devilish gargoyles by their gasmasks. As a humanitarian opponent of war, I had been horrified by such images then. How stupid and naive I still was! Today I knew better. No animal-tamer, no government minister, no general, no madman was capable of hatching up ideas and images in his head that didn’t already exist within me, and mine were every bit as appalling, as savage and evil, as coarse and stupid as theirs."
"Sie gab mir die Hand, und erst jetzt fiel diese Hand mir auf, eine Hand, die ganz zu ihrer Stimme paßte, schön und voll, klug und gütig.

"Da riß es mich in eine laute und aufgeregte Welt. Auf den Straßen jagten Automobile, zum Teil gepanzerte, und machten Jagd auf die Fußgänger, überfuhren sie zu Brei, drückten sie an den Mauern der Häuser zuschanden. Ich begriff sofort: es war der Kampf zwischen Menschen und Maschinen, lang vorbereitet, lang erwartet, lang gefürchtet, nun endlich zum Ausbruch gekommen. Überall lagen Tote und Zerfetzte herum, überall auch zerschmissene, verbogene, halbverbrannte Automobile, über dem wüsten Durcheinander kreisten Flugzeuge, und auch auf sie wurde von vielen Dächern und Fenstern aus mit Büchsen und mit Maschinengewehren geschossen. Wilde, prachtvoll aufreizende Plakate an allen Wänden forderten in Riesenbuchstaben, die wie Fackeln brannten, die Nation auf, endlich sich einzusetzen für die Menschen gegen die Maschinen, endlich die fetten, schöngekleideten, duftenden Reichen, die mit Hilfe der Maschinen das Fett aus den andern preßten, samt ihren großen, hustenden, böse knurrenden, teuflisch schnurrenden Automobilen totzuschlagen, endlich die Fabriken anzuzünden und die geschändete Erde ein wenig auszuräumen und zu entvölkern, damit wieder Gras wachsen, wieder aus der verstaubten Zementwelt etwas wie Wald, Wiese, Heide, Bach und Moor werden könne. Andre Plakate hingegen, wunderbar gemalt, prachtvoll stilisiert, in zarteren, weniger kindlichen Farben, außerordentlich klug und geistvoll abgefaßt, warnten im Gegenteil alle Besitzenden und alle Besonnenen beweglich vor dem drohenden Chaos der Anarchie, schilderten wahrhaft ergreifend den Segen der Ordnung, der Arbeit, des Besitzes, der Kultur, des Rechtes und priesen die Maschinen als höchste und letzte Erfindung der Menschen, mit deren Hilfe sie zu Göttern werden würden. Nachdenklich und bewundernd las ich die Plakate, die roten und die grünen, fabelhaft wirkte auf mich ihre flammende Beredsamkeit, ihre zwingende Logik, recht hatten sie, und tief überzeugt stand ich bald vor dem einen, bald vor dem andern, immerhin merklich gestört durch die ziemlich saftige Schießerei ringsum. Nun, die Hauptsache war klar: es war Krieg, ein heftiger, rassiger und höchst sympathischer Krieg, worin es sich nicht um Kaiser, Republik, Landesgrenzen, um Fahnen und Farben und dergleichen mehr dekorative und theatralische Sachen handelte, um Lumpereien im Grunde, sondern wo ein jeder, dem die Luft zu eng wurde und dem das Leben nicht recht mehr mundete, seinem Verdruß schlagenden Ausdruck verlieh und die allgemeine Zerstörung der blechernen zivilisierten Welt anzubahnen strebte. Ich sah, wie allen die Zerstörungs- und Mordlust so hell und aufrichtig aus den Augen lachte, und in mir selbst blühten diese roten wilden Blumen hoch und feist und lachten nicht minder. Freudig schloß ich mich dem Kampfe an. Das Schönste von allem aber war, daß neben mir plötzlich mein Schulkamerad Gustav auftauchte, der seit Jahrzehnten mir Verschollene, einst der wildeste, kräftigste und lebensdurstigste von den Freunden meiner frühen Kindheit. Mir lachte das Herz, als ich seine hellblauen Augen mir wieder zuzwinkern sah. Er winkte mir, und ich folgte ihm sofort mit Freuden.","Then it tore me into a noisy and excited world. Automobiles, some of them armored, sped along the streets, chasing pedestrians, running them over to a pulp, crushing them against the walls of the houses. I understood at once: it was the battle between man and machine, long prepared, long awaited, long feared, which had finally broken out. Everywhere there were dead people and people in tatters, everywhere also smashed, bent, half-burned automobiles, airplanes circled above the desolate chaos, and they too were shot at with rifles and machine guns from many roofs and windows. Wild, magnificently provocative posters on all the walls, in giant letters that burned like torches, called on the nation to finally stand up for the people against the machines, finally the fat, beautifully dressed, fragrant rich who use machines to get the fat out of the others pressed to death, together with their big, coughing, evil growling, devilishly purring automobiles, finally set fire to the factories and cleared out and depopulated the desecrated earth a little, so that grass could grow again, something like forest, meadow, heath, brook out of the dusty cement world and could become Moor. Other posters, on the other hand, wonderfully painted, magnificently stylized, in softer, less childish colors, extraordinarily clever and ingeniously composed, on the contrary warned all property owners and all the prudent in a flexible manner against the threatening chaos of anarchy, really movingly described the blessings of order, of work, of property, culture, and law, and praised machines as the supreme and last invention of mankind, with the help of which they would become gods. I read the posters thoughtfully and admiringly, the red ones and the green ones, their flaming eloquence had a fabulous effect on me, their compelling logic, they were right, and I stood in front of one, now in front of the other, deeply convinced, but noticeably disturbed by them pretty juicy gunplay all around. Well, the main thing was clear: it was war, a fierce, racy and highly sympathetic war, in which it was not a matter of emperor, republic, national borders, flags and colors and similar decorative and theatrical things, basically of slobs, but where everyone who felt the air was getting too tight and for whom life no longer tasted right, gave striking expression to their annoyance and strove to pave the way for the general destruction of the tinny civilized world. I saw how the lust for destruction and murder laughed so brightly and sincerely out of everyone's eyes, and in me these red wild flowers bloomed tall and fat and laughed no less. I gladly joined the fight. The best thing of all, however, was that my schoolmate Gustav suddenly appeared next to me, the one who had been missing from me for decades, who was once the wildest, strongest, and most thirsty for life of the friends of my early childhood. My heart laughed when I saw his light blue eyes wink at me again. He beckoned to me, and I immediately followed him happily.","I was swept at once into a world of noise and excitement. Cars, some of them armored, were run through the streets chasing the pedestrians. They ran them down and either left them mangled on the ground or crushed them to death against the walls of the houses. I saw at once that it was the long-prepared, long-awaited and long-feared war between men and machines, now at last broken out. On all sides lay dead and decomposing bodies, and on all sides, too, smashed and distorted and half-burned cars. Airplanes circled above the frightful confusion and were being fired upon from many roofs and windows with rifles and machine guns. On every wall were wild and magnificently stirring placards, whose giant letters flamed like torches, summoning the nation to side with the men against the machines, to make an end at last of the fat and well-dressed and perfumed plutocrats who used machines to squeeze the fat from other men's bodies, of them and their huge fiendishly purring automobiles. Set factories afire at last! Make a little room on the crippled earth! Depopulate it so that the grass may grow again, and woods, meadows, heather, stream and moor return to this world of dust and concrete. Other placards, on the other hand, in wonderful colors and magnificently phrased, warned all those who had a stake in the country and some share of prudence (in more moderate and less childish terms which testified to the remarkable cleverness and intellect of those who bad composed them) against the rising tide of anarchy. They depicted in a truly impressive way the blessings of order and work and property and education and justice, and praised machinery as the last and most sublime invention of the human mind. With its aid, men would be equal to the gods. I studied these placards, both the red and the green, and reflected on them and marveled at them. The flaming eloquence affected me as powerfully as the compelling logic. They were right, and I stood as deeply convinced in front of one as in front of the other, a good deal disturbed all the time by the rather juicy firing that went on all round me. Well, the principal thing was clear. There was a war on, a violent, genuine and highly sympathetic war where there was no concern for Kaiser or republic, for frontiers, flags or colors and other equally decorative and theatrical matters, all nonsense at bottom; but a war in which every one who lacked air to breathe and no longer found life exactly pleasing gave emphatic expression to his displeasure and strove to prepare the way for a general destruction of this iron-cast civilization of ours. In every eye I saw the unconcealed spark of destruction and murder, and in mine too these wild red roses bloomed as rank and high, and sparkled as brightly. I joined the battle joyfully. The best of all, however, was that my schoolfriend, Gustav, turned up close beside me. I had lost sight of him for dozens of years, the wildest, strongest, most eager and venturesome of the friends of my childhood. I laughed in my heart as I saw him blink at me with his bright blue eyes. He beckoned and at once I followed him joyfully.","I was whisked away into a world of loud noise and turbulence. Cars, some of them armour-plated, were tearing along the streets, hunting down pedestrians, running them over and reducing them to pulp, squashing them to bits against the walls of the buildings. Immediately I understood that the war between human beings and machines, long prepared, long expected and long feared, had now finally broken out. Everywhere there were dead and mutilated bodies lying around; everywhere too there were the buckled and half-burned-out wrecks of cars that had skidded out of control. Aeroplanes were circling above this utterly chaotic scene, and people with rifles and machine guns were shooting at them too from many windows and rooftops. On all the walls there were garish, splendidly provocative posters. In gigantic letters, flaring up like torches, the nation was being called upon to finally take up arms on behalf of humanity against machines; to finally exterminate the fat, handsomely dressed, perfumed plutocrats who, with the help of machines, were living off the fat of others. Also to put an end to their huge, coughing, evilly snarling and devilishly humming motor cars; to finally set fire to the factories and go some way towards clearing out and depopulating the desecrated earth so that grass might grow again and the dust-filled concrete jungle might give way to things such as woods, meadows, heaths, streams and marshland. From other posters, in contrast, splendidly stylized and beautifully painted in gentler, less childish colours, came stirring warnings, composed with extraordinary subtlety and wit, about the chaos and anarchy that were threatening all prudent property owners. In truly gripping terms these posters pictured the blessings of law and order, hard work, property and culture, and they praised machines as human beings’ latest and greatest invention, with the aid of which they would be transformed into gods. As I read them, deep in thought, I could not help admiring the posters, the red ones as well as the green. Both their fiery eloquence and their compelling logic made an enormous impression on me. They were right, I thought, as I stood there profoundly convinced, now in front of one poster, now in front of another, albeit perceptibly disturbed by the fairly hefty shooting match going on all around me. Well, there was a war being fought, that was the main thing: a vehement, spirited war that was highly congenial because it wasn’t a matter of the Kaiser, the Republic or national frontiers, or of flags and battle colours and such things of a more decorative and theatrical kind – all essentially shabby issues. No, this was a war in which all those who felt stifled, all those for whom life had acquired a nasty taste, were giving full vent to their grievances and trying their hardest to set in train a process leading to the general destruction of the shoddy world of civilization. All their eyes were shining so brightly with a genuine, burning desire to destroy and kill that I felt the same passions burning just as fiercely in me, flourishing unchecked like tall, rank, blood-red flowers. I was more than happy to join in the fighting. However, the nicest thing of all was the sudden appearance at my side of my former classmate Gustav, whom I had completely lost touch with decades ago. Of all my early-childhood friends he had once been the wildest and strongest, the one with the greatest appetite for life. My heart leaped to see his bright blue eyes winking at me once again, and when he beckoned to me I was at once delighted to follow him."

"Über das Äußere des Steppenwolfes habe ich einige Angaben schon gemacht. Er machte durchaus und gleich beim ersten Anblick den Eindruck eines bedeutenden, eines seltenen und ungewöhnlich begabten Menschen, sein Gesicht war voll Geist, und das außerordentlich zarte und bewegliche Spiel seiner Züge spiegelte ein interessantes, höchst bewegtes, ungemein zartes und sensibles Seelenleben. Wenn man mit ihm sprach und er, was nicht immer der Fall war, die Grenzen des Konventionellen überschritt und aus seiner Fremdheit heraus persönliche, eigene Worte sagte, dann mußte unsereiner sich ihm ohne weiteres unterordnen, er hatte mehr gedacht als andre Menschen und hatte in geistigen Angelegenheiten jene beinah kühle Sachlichkeit, jenes sichere Gedachthaben und Wissen, wie es nur wahrhaft geistige Menschen haben, welchen jeder Ehrgeiz fehlt, welche niemals zu glänzen oder den andern zu überreden oder recht zu behalten wünschen.","I have already given some information about the Steppenwolf's appearance. Right from the first sight he made the impression of an important, rare and unusually gifted person. His face was full of spirit, and the extraordinarily delicate and agile play of his features reflected an interesting, extremely moving, extremely delicate and sensitive inner life. If you spoke to him and he, which was not always the case, overstepped the bounds of convention and, out of his strangeness, said his own personal words, then we had to subordinate ourselves to him without further ado, he had thought more than other people and had in spiritual affairs that almost cool objectivity, that secure thinking and knowledge that only truly spiritual people have, who lack any ambition, who never wish to shine or to persuade others or to be right.","I have already given some account of the Steppenwolf's outward appearance. He gave at the very first glance the impression of a significant, an uncommon, and unusually gifted man. His face was intellectual, and the abnormally delicate and mobile play of his features reflected a soul of extremely emotional and unusually delicate sensibility. When one spoke to him and he, as was not always the case, dropped conventionalities and said personal and individual things that came out of his own alien world, then a man like myself came under his spell on the spot. He had thought more than other men, and in matters of the intellect he had that calm objectivity, that certainty of thought and knowledge, such as only really intellectual men have, who have no axe to grind, who never wish to shine, or to talk others down, or to appear always in the right.","I have already given some indication of Steppenwolf’s outward appearance. Even at first sight he gave every impression of being an important, a rare and unusually gifted individual. His whole face had the look of an intellectual about it, and the extraordinarily gentle and nimble play of his features was visual evidence of an interesting, highly agile, uncommonly delicate and sensitive life of the mind. If, in conversation, he went beyond the conventional niceties – which wasn’t always the case – and uttered something personal and peculiar to him, arising from his alien nature, then the likes of you and me simply couldn’t help but defer to him. He had thought more than other people and when it came to intellectual matters he had that almost cool objectivity, that secure knowledge based on careful reflection, which only truly intelligent people possess, being quite without ambition and never seeking to shine, to talk others round to their point of view, or always to be proved right."
"Am Morgen mußte ich Maria, nachdem sie mein Frühstück geteilt hatte, aus dem Hause schmuggeln, und es gelang. Noch am selben Tage mietete ich für sie und mich in einem nahen Stadtteil ein Zimmerchen, das nur für unsre Zusammenkünfte bestimmt war.","In the morning I had to smuggle Maria out of the house after she had shared my breakfast, and I succeeded. On the same day I rented a small room for her and myself in a nearby part of the city, which was only intended for our meetings.","In the morning, after we had shared breakfast, I had to smuggle Maria from the house. Later in the same day I took a little room in a neighboring quarter which was designed solely for our meetings.","The next morning, after she had shared my breakfast, I had to smuggle Maria out of the building, which I succeeded in doing.

Tenderly and carefully he took us by the arm, Hermione on the right, me on the left, and led us up a flight of stairs into a small round room, which was lit up bluish from above and almost completely empty, there was nothing in it but a small round table and three armchairs in which we sat.","The dear fellow gave us each an arm with kind solicitude, Hermine his right, me his left, and conducted us upstairs to a small round room that was lit from the ceiling with a bluish light and nearly empty.

"Ich sah keinen Weg, dem Gefürchteten zu entrinnen. Würde im Kampf zwischen Verzweiflung und Feigheit heute auch vielleicht die Feigheit siegen, morgen und jeden Tag würde von neuem die Verzweiflung vor mir stehen, noch erhöht durch die Selbstverachtung. Ich würde so lange das Messer zur Hand nehmen und wieder wegwerfen, bis es endlich doch einmal getan war. Dann lieber heute noch! Vernünftig sprach ich mir selber zu, wie einem geängstigten Kind, aber das Kind hörte nicht, es lief davon, es wollte leben. Zuckend riß es mich weiter durch die Stadt, im weiten Bogen umkreiste ich meine Wohnung, stets die Heimkehr im Sinn, stets sie verzögernd. Da und dort blieb ich in einer Kneipe hängen, einen Becher lang, zwei Becher lang, dann jagte es mich weiter, im weiten Kreise um das Ziel, um das Rasiermesser, um den Tod herum. Todmüde saß ich zuweilen auf einer Bank, auf einem Brunnenrand, auf einem Prellstein, hörte mein Herz klopfen, wischte mir den Schweiß von der Stirn, lief wieder weiter, voll tödlicher Angst, voll flackernder Sehnsucht nach Leben.","I saw no way of escaping what was feared. If in the struggle between desperation and cowardice today cowardice might win, tomorrow and every day despair would stand before me anew, heightened by self-contempt. I would pick up the knife and throw it away again until it was finally done. Then better today! I spoke sensibly to myself, like a frightened child, but the child didn't listen, it ran away, it wanted to live. Twitching, it tore me further through the city, I circled my apartment in a wide arc, always thinking about returning home, always delaying it. Here and there I got stuck in a bar, one cup, two cups long, then it chased me on, in wide circles around the goal, around the razor, around death. Sometimes I sat dead tired on a bench, on the edge of a well, on a curb, heard my heart beating, wiped the sweat from my forehead, ran on again, full of deadly fear, full of flickering longing for life.","I saw no other way of escape from this dreadful specter. Suppose that today cowardice won a victory over despair, tomorrow and each succeeding day I would again face despair heightened by self-contempt. It was merely taking up and throwing down the knife till at last it was done. Better today then. I reasoned with myself as though with a frightened child. But the child would not listen. It ran away. It wanted to live. I renewed my fitful wanderings through the town, making many detours not to return to the house which I had always in my mind and always deferred. Here and there I came to a stop and lingered, drinking a glass or two, and then, as if pursued, ran around in a circle whose center had the razor as a goal, and meant death. Sometimes from utter weariness I sat on a bench, on a fountain's rim, or a curbstone and wiped the sweat from my forehead and listened to the beating of my heart. Then on again in mortal dread and an intense yearning for life.","I could see no way of escaping the thing I feared. Even if today, in the battle between despair and cowardice, cowardice were perhaps to win again, despair would confront me afresh tomorrow and every day, and it would be further increased by self-contempt. I would go on taking the razor in my hand and throwing it aside again until one day the deed was finally done. In that case, better to get it over with today. I was talking sensibly to myself as to a frightened child, but the child didn’t listen. Wishing to go on living, it ran off. Seized with panic, I was driven on through the town. I walked round and round my home in wide circles, constantly meaning to go back there, constantly putting it off. Now and then I ended up in a pub, long enough for one glass, long enough for two, before I felt compelled to walk on, again in a broad arc around my destination, around the razor, around death. Tired out, I sat from time to time on a bench, on the rim of a fountain, on a kerbstone, listening to my heart beating and wiping the sweat from my brow. Then I set off walking again, filled with mortal dread; filled too with a flickering desire for life."
"Der Mann, mein verfluchter Zerrspiegelzwilling, hatte seinen Wolf allerdings fabelhaft gezähmt. Der Wolf gehorchte aufmerksam jedem Befehl, reagierte hündisch auf jeden Zuruf und Peitschenknall, er fiel in die Knie, stellte sich tot, machte das Männchen, er trug einen Brotlaib, ein Ei, ein Stück Fleisch, ein Körbchen folgsam und artig in der Schnauze, ja er mußte dem Bändiger die Peitsche, die dieser hatte fallen lassen, aufheben und im Maule nachtragen, wozu er unerträglich kriecherisch mit dem Schwanze wedelte. Es wurde dem Wolf ein Kaninchen vorgeführt und dann ein weißes Lamm, und er bleckte zwar die Zähne und ließ den Speichel tropfen vor zitternder Begierde, berührte aber keines der Tiere, sondern sprang auf Befehl über sie, die bebend am Boden kauerten, in elegantem Schwung hinweg, ja, er legte sich zwischen Hase und Lamm nieder, umarmte beide mit den Vorderpfoten und bildete mit ihnen eine rührende Familiengruppe. Dazu fraß er aus des Menschen Hand eine Tafel Schokolade. Es war eine Qual mitanzusehen, bis zu welch phantastischem Grade dieser Wolf seine Natur hatte verleugnen lernen, und mir standen dabei die Haare zu Berg.","The man, my cursed distorting mirror twin, had tamed his wolf admirably. The wolf obeyed every command attentively, reacted like a dog to every shout and crack of a whip, he fell on his knees, played dead, made the male, he carried a loaf of bread, an egg, a piece of meat, a basket obediently and politely in his snout, yes, he had to pick up the whip that the tamer had dropped and carry it in his mouth, for which he wagged his tail in an unbearably sycophantic manner. A rabbit was brought before the wolf, and then a white lamb, and though he bared his teeth and salivated with trembling desire, he did not touch any of the animals, but, at command, sprang over them, which crouched trembling on the ground, with a graceful leap away, yes, he lay down between the hare and the lamb, embraced both with his front paws and formed a touching family group with them. To do this, he ate a bar of chocolate from the human hand. It was agony to see the fantastic degree to which this wolf had learned to deny his nature, and it made my hair stand on end.","At any rate, the man, my diabolically distorted double, had his wolf marvelously broken. The wolf was obediently attentive to every command and responded like a dog to every call and every crack of the whip. He went down on his knees, lay for dead, and, aping the lord of creation, carried a loaf, an egg, a piece of meat, a basket in his mouth with cheerful obedience; and he even had to pick up the whip that the tamer had let fall and carry it after him in his teeth while he wagged his tail with an unbearable submissiveness. A rabbit was put in front of him and then a white lamb. He bared his teeth, it is true, and the saliva dropped from his mouth while he trembled with desire, but he did not touch either of the animals; and at the word of command he jumped over them with a graceful leap, as they cowered trembling on the floor. More—he laid himself down between the rabbit and the lamb and embraced them with his foremost paws to form a touching family group, at the same time eating a stick of chocolate from the man's hand. It was an agony to witness the fantastic extent to which the wolf had learned to belie his nature; and I stood there with my hair on end.","I have to say that he had done a tremendous job, this damned distorted mirror image of me. The wolf alertly obeyed his every command, reacting slavishly to his every call or crack of the whip. It sank to its knees, played dead, sat up and begged. It obediently fetched a loaf of bread, an egg, a piece of meat, a basket, carrying them all in its mouth like a well-trained dog. It even had to pick up the whip dropped by the tamer and, holding it in its mouth, follow him while wagging its tail in so abject a fashion that it was unbearable to watch. A rabbit was presented to the wolf, then a white lamb, but although it bared its teeth and salivated over them, trembling with desire, it didn’t touch either of them. Instead, when ordered to, it leaped with one elegant bound over the two animals that cowered there shuddering with fright. Indeed, it lay down between the rabbit and the lamb, embracing each of them with its front paws and forming a moving family group. What is more, it ate a bar of chocolate from the man’s hand. The degree to which this wolf had learned to deny its natural instincts was just fantastic, and it was agonizing to witness. As I did so, my hair was standing on end."
"»Sehen Sie«, fing ich an, »es war eigentlich eine Kleinigkeit. Ich war eingeladen, bei einem Professor – ich selber bin aber keiner –, und eigentlich hätte ich gar nicht hingehen sollen, ich bin es nicht mehr gewohnt, so bei Leuten zu sitzen und zu schwatzen, ich habe es verlernt. Ich ging auch schon in das Haus hinein mit dem Gefühl, es werde nicht gutgehen – als ich meinen Hut aufhängte, kam mir schon der Gedanke, ich würde ihn vielleicht schon bald wieder brauchen. Ja, und bei diesem Professor also, da stand auf dem Tisch so ein Bild herum, ein dummes Bild, das mich ärgerte . . .«","'You see,' I began, 'it was actually a small thing. I was invited to see a professor - but I'm not one myself - and actually I shouldn't have gone at all, I'm not used to sitting with people and chatting, I've forgotten how. I also walked into the house with a feeling it wasn't going to be good - as I hung up my hat I thought I might need it again soon. Yes, and with this professor there was a picture lying around on the table, a stupid picture that annoyed me . . .«","""Well,"" I began, ""you see, it was really a small matter. I had an invitation to dinner with a professor—I'm not one myself, by the way—and really I ought not to have gone. I've lost the habit of being in company and making conversation. I've forgotten how it's done. As soon as I entered the house I had the feeling something would go wrong, and when I hung my hat on the peg I thought to myself that perhaps I should want it sooner than I expected. Well, at the professor's there was a picture that stood on the table, a stupid picture. It annoyed me—""","‘You see,’ I began, ‘it was actually something or nothing. I’d been invited to dinner at the home of a professor – though I’m not one myself – and I ought really not to have gone. I’m not used to that kind of thing any more, sitting and chatting with people. I’ve forgotten how. What’s more, even as I entered the place I sensed that things would turn out badly. When hanging up my hat, the thought already occurred to me that I might need to take it back again in no time at all. And you see, at this professor’s, there happened to be a picture on the table, a stupid picture that annoyed me –’ ‘What sort of picture?’"

"Ich machte ihr Platz, und sie ging; ihr Röckchen streifte meine Knie, im Gehen blickte sie in einen runden, winzig kleinen Taschenspiegel, zog die Augenbrauen hoch, wischte mit einem winzigen Puderquästchen über ihr Kinn und verschwand im Tanzsaal. Ich blickte um mich: fremde Gesichter, rauchende Männer, verschüttetes Bier auf dem Marmortisch, Geschrei und Gekreische überall, nebenan die Tanzmusik. Ich solle schlafen, hatte sie gesagt. Ach, gutes Kind, du hast eine Ahnung von meinem Schlaf, der scheuer ist als ein Wiesel! In diesem Jahrmarkt schlafen, am Tisch sitzend, zwischen den klappernden Bierkrügen. Ich nippte am Wein, zog eine Zigarre aus der Tasche, sah mich nach Streichhölzern um, aber eigentlich war mir nichts am Rauchen gelegen, ich legte die Zigarre vor mir auf den Tisch. »Mach die Augen zu«, hatte sie zu mir gesagt. Weiß Gott, woher das Mädchen diese Stimme hatte, diese etwas tiefe, gute Stimme, eine mütterliche Stimme. Es war gut, dieser Stimme zu gehorchen, ich hatte es erfahren. Gehorsam machte ich die Augen zu, lehnte den Kopf an die Wand, hörte hundert heftige Geräusche mich umtosen, lächelte über die Idee, an diesem Ort zu schlafen, beschloß, an die Saaltür zu gehen und einen Blick in den Tanzsaal zu erhaschen – ich mußte doch mein schönes Mädchen tanzen sehen –, bewegte unterm Stuhl die Füße, fühlte erst jetzt, wie unendlich müde ich vom stundenlangen Umherirren war, und blieb sitzen. Und da schlief ich schon, dem mütterlichen Befehl getreu, schlief gierig und dankbar und träumte, träumte klarer und hübscher, als ich seit langem geträumt hatte. Mir träumte:","I made room for her and she left; her skirt brushed my knees, as she walked she looked into a round, tiny little pocket mirror, raised her eyebrows, wiped her chin with a tiny powder puff and disappeared into the dance hall. I looked around: strange faces, men smoking, spilled beer on the marble table, shouting and screeching everywhere, next door the dance music. I should sleep, she had said. Ah, good child, you have an inkling of my sleep, which is shyer than a weasel! At this fair, you sleep sitting at the table between the rattling beer mugs. I sipped the wine, pulled a cigar out of my pocket, looked around for matches, but actually I didn't want to smoke, I put the cigar on the table in front of me. ""Close your eyes,"" she had said to me. God knows where the girl got that voice from, that kind of deep, good voice, a motherly voice. It was good to obey that voice, I had experienced it. I obediently closed my eyes, leaned my head against the wall, heard a hundred violent noises rushing around me, smiled at the idea of sleeping in this place, decided to go to the hall door and have a look at the dance hall - I had to but seeing my beautiful girl dancing -, moved my feet under the chair, only now felt how infinitely tired I was from hours of wandering around, and stayed seated. And then I was asleep, true to my mother's command, slept greedily and gratefully and dreamed, dreamed more clearly and prettily than I had dreamed for a long time. I dreamed:","I made room for her to pass. Her skirt brushed my knees and she looked, as she went, in a little pocket mirror, lifted her eyebrows, and powdered her chin; then she disappeared into the dance hall. I looked round me; strange faces, smoking men, spilled beer on marble-tops, clatter and clamor everywhere, the dance music in my ear. I was to sleep, she had said. Ah, my good child, you know a lot about my sleep that is shyer than a weasel! Sleep in this hurly-burly, sitting at a table, amidst the clatter of beer steins! I sipped the wine and, taking out a cigar, looked round for matches, but as I had after all no inclination to smoke, I put down the cigar on the table in front of me. "" Shut your eyes,"" she had said. God knows where the girl got her voice; it was so deep and good and maternal. It was good to obey such a voice, I had found that out already. Obediently I shut my eyes, leaned my head against the wall and heard the roar of a hundred mingled noises surge around me and smiled at the idea of sleep in such a place. I made up my mind to go to the door of the dance hall and from there catch a glimpse of my beautiful girl as she danced. I made a movement to go, then felt at last how unutterably tired out I was from my hours of wandering and remained seated; and, thereupon I fell asleep as I had been told. I slept greedily, thankfully, and dreamed more lightly and pleasantly than I had for a long while. I dreamed that I was waiting in an old-fashioned anteroom.","I made room for her to go. Her little dress brushed against my knees; then, as she walked away, I saw her glance at herself in a tiny round pocket mirror, raise her eyebrows and dab her chin with a miniature powder puff before disappearing into the ballroom. Looking around me, I saw strange faces, men smoking, spilled beer on the marble-topped table. All around I could hear shouting and shrieking, and from the next room the noise of dance music. She had told me to get some sleep. What an innocent child! Little did she know how shy a creature sleep was in my experience, even less likely to keep me company than a weasel. And she wanted me to sleep in this funfair of a place, sitting at a table with the clatter of beer mugs on all sides! I sipped at my wine, took a cigar out of my pocket and looked around for matches, but feeling no really strong desire to smoke , I put the cigar down in front of me on the table. ‘ Close your eyes,’ she had said. Heaven knows where the girl had got that voice of hers from, that slightly deep, kind voice, like a mother’s. It was good to obey that voice, as I had already discovered. Obediently closing my eyes, I leaned my head against the wall and, with hundreds of raucous sounds ringing in my ears, smiled at the thought of trying to sleep in this of all places. I decided to make my way to the ballroom door and steal a glance inside – after all, I couldn’t miss seeing my beautiful girl dance. But only now realizing, as I moved my legs under the table, just how immensely tired I felt after wandering the streets for hours, I remained seated. And before I knew it I was already asleep, following mother’s orders to the letter. I slept my fill, unable to get enough of it, and was thankful. And I dreamt, dreamt more clearly and beautifully than I had dreamt for ages. What I dreamt was this: –"
"Und so baute der kluge Aufbauer aus den Gestalten, deren jede ein Stück meiner selbst war, ein Spiel ums andre auf, alle einander von ferne ähnlich, alle erkennbar als derselben Welt angehörig, derselben Herkunft verpflichtet, dennoch jedes völlig neu.","And so, out of the figures, each of which was a piece of myself, the clever builder built one game after the other, all remotely similar, all recognizable as belonging to the same world, committed to the same origin, yet each completely new.","And in this fashion the clever architect built up one game after another out of the figures, each of which was a bit of myself, and every game had a distant resemblance to every other. Each belonged recognizably to the same world and acknowledged a common origin. Yet each was entirely new.","And thus this artist adept at reconstruction assembled one game after another from the figures that were all part of my self. They all bore a distant resemblance to one another, all recognizably belonged to the same world and shared the same origin, yet each game was totally new."
"»Das sollst du nicht«, sagte sie ganz mütterlich. »Dein Leben wird auch dadurch nicht flach und dumm, wenn du weißt, daß dein Kampf erfolglos sein wird. Es ist viel flacher, Harry, wenn du für etwas Gutes und Ideales kämpfst und nun meinst, du müssest es auch erreichen. Sind denn Ideale zum Erreichen da? Leben wir denn, wir Menschen, um den Tod abzuschaffen? Nein, wir leben, um ihn zu fürchten und dann wieder zu lieben, und gerade seinetwegen glüht das bißchen Leben manchmal eine Stunde lang so schön. Du bist ein Kind, Harry. Sei jetzt folgsam und komm mit mir, wir haben heut viel zu tun. Ich werde mich heut nicht mehr um den Krieg und die Zeitungen kümmern. Und du?«","""You shouldn't,"" she said in a very motherly manner. 'Your life won't become flat and stupid even if you know that your fight will be unsuccessful. It's a lot flatter, Harry, when you're fighting for something good and ideal and now you feel like you have to achieve it. Are there ideals to achieve? Do we live, we humans, to abolish death? No, we live to fear him and then to love him again, and it is precisely because of him that little bit of life sometimes glows so beautifully for an hour. you are a child Be obedient now and come with me, we have a lot to do today. I won't bother about the war and the newspapers anymore today. And you?""","""You shan't do that,"" she said in a voice that was quite maternal. ""Your life will not be flat and dull even though you know that your war will never be victorious. It is far flatter, Harry, to fight for something good and ideal and to know all the time that you are bound to attain it. Are ideals attainable? Do we live to abolish death? No—we live to fear it and then again to love it, and just for death's sake it is that our spark of life glows for an hour now and then so brightly. You're a child, Harry. Now, do as I tell you and come along. We've a lot to get done today. I am not going to bother myself any more today about the war or the papers either. What about you?""","‘That’s not what I mean you should do,’ she said, sounding just like a mother. ‘And anyway, knowing that the fight is bound to fail doesn’t make your life shallow and idiotic. Life is much shallower, Harry, if you are fighting for something good and ideal in the belief that you are bound to achieve it. Are ideals necessarily there to be achieved? Do we as human beings live only in order to abolish death? No, we live to fear death, then to love it again, and it’s precisely because of death that the brief candle of our lives burns so beautifully for a while. You are a child, Harry. Now do what you’re told to and come with me. We have a lot to do today. I’m not going to worry about the war and the press any more today. What about you?’"
"»Nichts«, sagte der im Spiegel, »ich warte nur. Ich warte auf den Tod.«","""Nothing,"" said the one in the mirror, ""I'm just waiting. I am waiting for death.«","""Nothing,"" said he in the mirror, ""I am only waiting. I am waiting for death.""","‘Nothing,’ said the figure in the mirror. ‘I’m just waiting. I’m waiting for death.’"

"»Ach, lieber Herr, mit den Stufen mögen Sie ja ganz recht haben. Ich habe gewiß nichts dagegen, daß Sie Mozart und Haydn und den Valencia auf jede Ihnen beliebende Stufe stellen! Mir ist das ganz einerlei, ich habe über die Stufen nicht zu entscheiden, ich werde nicht hierüber gefragt. Der Mozart wird vielleicht auch noch in hundert Jahren gespielt werden und der Valencia vielleicht schon in zwei Jahren nicht mehr – ich glaube, das können wir ruhig dem lieben Gott überlassen, er ist gerecht und hat unser aller Lebensdauer in der Hand, auch die jedes Walzers und jedes Foxtrott, er wird sicher das Richtige tun. Wir Musikanten aber, wir müssen das Unsere tun, das, was unsere Pflicht und Aufgabe ist: wir müssen das spielen, was gerade im Augenblick von den Leuten begehrt wird, und wir müssen es so gut und schön und eindringlich spielen wie nur möglich.«","'Oh, dear sir, you may be quite right about the steps. I certainly don't mind if you put Mozart and Haydn and the Valencia on whatever level you like! It doesn't matter to me, I don't have to decide on the steps, I'm not asked about them. The Mozart will perhaps still be played in a hundred years and the Valencia perhaps not in two years – I think we can leave that to God, he is just and has the lifespan of all of us in his hands, including that of every waltz and every foxtrot, he will surely do the right thing. We musicians, however, have to do our part, what is our duty and task: we have to play what people want at the moment, and we have to play it as well, beautifully and forcefully as possible.«","""Ah, my dear sir, you may be perfectly right with your levels. I have nothing to say to your putting Mozart and Haydn and Valencia on what levels you please. It is all one to me. It is not for me to decide about levels. I shall never be asked about them. Mozart, perhaps, will still be played in a hundred years and Valencia in two will be played no more—we can well leave that, I think, in God's hands. God is good and has the span of all our days in his hands and that of every waltz and fox trot too. He is sure to do what is right. We musicians, however, we must play our parts according to our duties and our gifts. We have to play what is actually in demand, and we have to play it as well and as beautifully and as expressively as ever we can.""","‘Ah, my dear man, what you say about different levels may well be right. I certainly don’t mind you situating Mozart and Haydn and “Valencia” on any level that suits you. It’s all the same to me. It’s not for me to decide on levels, that’s not something I’m asked to judge upon. People may still be playing Mozart in a hundred years’ time, whereas in two years from now they will perhaps already have stopped playing “Valencia”. I think that’s something we can safely leave to the dear Lord to decide. He has control of all our lifespans, even those of every waltz and foxtrot, and, since he is just, he will surely do what is right. But we musicians have to do our bit by carrying out the duty assigned to us. That means we must play whatever people desire at the moment and must play it as well, as beautifully and as forcefully as we possibly can.’"

"Betrachten wir von diesem Standpunkt aus den Steppenwolf, so wird uns klar, warum er so sehr unter seiner lächerlichen Zweiheit leidet. Er glaubt, wie Faust, daß zwei Seelen für eine einzige Brust schon zuviel seien und die Brust zerreißen müßten. Sie sind aber im Gegenteil viel zu wenig, und Harry vergewaltigt seine arme Seele furchtbar, wenn er sie in einem so primitiven Bilde zu begreifen sucht. Harry verfährt, obwohl er ein hochgebildeter Mensch ist, etwa wie ein Wilder, der nicht über zwei hinaus zählen kann. Er nennt ein Stück von sich Mensch, ein andres Wolf, und damit glaubt er schon am Ende zu sein und sich erschöpft zu haben. In den »Menschen« packt er alles Geistige, Sublimierte oder doch Kultivierte hinein, das er in sich vorfindet, und in den Wolf alles Triebhafte, Wilde und Chaotische. Aber so simpel wie in unsern Gedanken, so grob wie in unsrer armen Idiotensprache geht es im Leben nicht zu, und Harry belügt sich doppelt, wenn er diese negerhafte Wolfsmethode anwendet. Harry rechnet, so fürchten wir, ganze Provinzen seiner Seele schon zum »Menschen«, die noch lange nicht Mensch sind, und rechnet Teile seines Wesens zum Wolfe, die längst über den Wolf hinaus sind.","If we look at Steppenwolf from this point of view, we can see why he suffers so much from his ridiculous duality. Like Faust, he believes that two souls are already too many for a single breast and that the breast must be torn apart. On the contrary, they are far too few, and Harry violates his poor soul terribly when he tries to understand it in such a primitive picture. Harry, despite being a highly educated person, acts somewhat like a savage who cannot count past two. He calls a part of himself a man, another a wolf, and with that he thinks he's at the end of his rope and has exhausted himself. He packs everything spiritual, sublimated or at least cultivated that he finds within himself into ""human beings,"" and into the wolf everything instinctive, wild, and chaotic. But life isn't as simple as our thoughts, as crude as our poor idiot-speak, and Harry is doubly lying to himself when he uses that Negro wolf method. Harry, we fear, counts entire provinces of his soul as ""human"" that are far from being human, and counts parts of his being as wolf that are long past the wolf.","If we consider the Steppenwolf from this standpoint it will be clear to us why he suffered so much under his ludicrous dual personality. He believes, like Faust, that two souls are far too many for a single breast and must tear the breast asunder. They are on the contrary far too few, and Harry does shocking violence to his poor soul when he endeavors to apprehend it by means of so primitive an image. Although he is a most cultivated person, he proceeds like a savage that cannot count further than two. He calls himself part wolf, part man, and with that he thinks .he has come to an end and exhausted the matter. With the ""man"" he packs in everything spiritual and sublimated or even cultivated to be found in himself, and with the wolf all that is instinctive, savage and chaotic. But things are not so simple in life as in our thoughts, nor so rough and ready as in our poor idiotic language; and Harry lies about himself twice over when he employs this niggardly wolf-theory. He assigns, we fear, whole provinces of his soul to the ""man"" which are a long way from being human, and parts of his being to the wolf that long ago have left the wolf behind.","If we consider Steppenwolf from this point of view we can see clearly why he suffers so much from his ludicrous sense of himself as twofold. Like Faust he thinks that even two souls are too much for a single breast to contain and ought by rights to tear that breast asunder. Yet they are, on the contrary, far too few, and Harry is doing terrible violence to his poor psyche by seeking to comprehend it with the help of so primitive an image. Harry may be a highly educated human being, but he is acting like some savage, say, who is incapable of counting beyond two. Calling one bit of himself human being, another wolf, he thinks that is the end of the story and all his possibilities have been exhausted. Into the ‘human’ half he packs all intellectual or spiritual attributes, all things sublimated or cultivated that he finds in himself, and into the wolf everything instinctual, savage and chaotic. Yet in real life things are not as simplistic as in our thinking, not as crude as in the poor simpletons’ language we use, and Harry is doubly deluding himself when applying this primitive model of the wolf to his own case. We fear that whole areas of Harry’s psyche which he attributes to the ‘human being’ are by no stretch of the imagination human, while parts of his character that he assigns to the wolf have long since progressed beyond the merely wolf-like."

"Vielerlei Gefühle regte diese Inschrift in mir auf; allerlei Ängste und Zwänge aus meinem gewesenen Leben, aus der verlassenen Wirklichkeit her, zogen mir peinlich das Herz zusammen. Mit bebender Hand öffnete ich die Türe und kam in eine Jahrmarktbude, darin sah ich ein Eisengitter errichtet, das mich von der dürftigen Schaubühne trennte. Auf der Bühne aber sah ich einen Tierbändiger stehen, einen etwas marktschreierisch aussehenden und wichtigtuenden Herrn, der trotz großen Schnauzbarts, trotz muskelstrotzenden Oberarms und geckenhafter Zirkuskleidung mir selbst auf eine hämische, recht widerwärtige Weise ähnlich sah. Dieser starke Mann führte – jämmerlicher Anblick! – einen großen, schönen, aber furchtbar abgemagerten und sklavisch-scheu blickenden Wolf an der Leine wie einen Hund. Und es war nun ebenso ekelhaft wie spannend, ebenso scheußlich wie dennoch heimlich-lustvoll, diesen brutalen Bändiger das edle und doch so schmächlich gehorsame Raubtier in einer Reihe von Tricks und sensationellen Szenen vorführen zu sehen.","This inscription aroused many feelings in me; all sorts of fears and compulsions from my past life, from the abandoned reality, tightened my heart in an embarrassing way. With a trembling hand I opened the door and came into a fairground stall, in which I saw an iron gate erected, separating me from the meager stage. On the stage, however, I saw an animal tamer, a somewhat boastful-looking and self-important gentleman who, despite a large moustache, muscular upper arm and fop-like circus clothes, resembled me in a malicious, quite disgusting way. This strong man led - pitiful sight! – a large, beautiful, but terribly emaciated and slavishly shy-looking wolf on a leash like a dog. And it was now as disgusting as it was thrilling, as hideous as it was secretly lustful, to see this brutal tamer perform a series of tricks and sensational scenes on the noble yet so ignobly obedient predator.","Many different emotions surged up in me at the sight of this announcement. My heart was painfully contracted by all kinds of fears and repressions from my former life and the reality I had left behind. With trembling hand I opened the door and found myself in the booth of a fair with an iron rail separating me from a wretched stage. On the stage I saw an animal tamer—a cheap-jack gentleman with a pompous air—who in spite of a large moustache, exuberantly muscular biceps and his absurd circus getup had a malicious and decidedly unpleasant resemblance to myself. The strong man led on a leash like a dog—lamentable sight—a large, beautiful but terribly emaciated wolf, whose eyes were cowed and furtive; and it was as disgusting as it was intriguing, as horrible as it was all the same secretly entertaining, to see this brutal tamer of animals put the noble and yet so ignominiously obedient beast of prey through a series of tricks and sensational turns.","This inscription aroused a lot of different emotions in me. My heart ached as all kinds of anxieties and pressures from my past life, from the reality I had left behind, closed in on me again. With a trembling hand, I opened the door to find myself in a fairground booth. Once inside, I noticed that an iron grating had been installed between me and the makeshift stage. However, I could see an animal-tamer standing up there, a rather vociferous, self-important gentleman who, despite a large moustache, bulging muscles on his upper arms and a clown-like circus costume, resembled me in a manner that I found malicious and truly repulsive. This strongman was strutting around – what a sight for sore eyes! – with a wolf on a lead as if it were a dog: a huge, handsome, but terribly emaciated wolf with a timid, slavish look in its eyes. And to now watch the brutal tamer forcing this noble but so ignominiously compliant beast to perform a series of tricks and act out sensational scenes was an experience I found as disgusting as it was thrilling, as horrific as it was nonetheless secretly enjoyable."

That way we’ll have music as often as we want, and we can keep the gramophone into the bargain.’"

"Von einem kleinen Kraftwagen, der uns eben schnaubend entgegenkam, schoß er den Führer herunter, sprang flink wie ein Affe auf den Wagen, brachte ihn zum Stehen und ließ mich aufsteigen, dann fuhren wir schnell wie der Teufel zwischen Flintenkugeln und gestürzten Wagen hindurch, davon, zur Stadt und Vorstadt hinaus.","He shot the guide off a small motor car that was just snorting towards us, jumped on the car quick as a monkey, brought it to a stop and let me get on, then we drove fast as hell between shotgun bullets and overturned cars, away , out to the city and suburbs.","He shot the driver of a small car that came snorting towards us and leaping into it as nimbly as a monkey, brought it to a standstill for me to get in.

"Ohne anzuhalten, griff der Mann in seinen Kasten, mechanisch, zog ein kleines Büchlein heraus und hielt es mir hin. Ich nahm es schnell und steckte es ein. Während ich an meinem Mantel knöpfte und Geld hervorsuchen wollte, bog er seitwärts in einen Torweg, zog das Tor hinter sich zu und war verschwunden. Im Hof klangen seine schweren Schritte, auf Steinpflaster erst, dann auf einer hölzernen Treppe, dann hörte ich nichts mehr. Und plötzlich war auch ich sehr müde und hatte das Gefühl, es sei sehr spät und es sei gut, jetzt heimzukommen. Ich lief rascher und war bald durch die schlafende Vorstadtgasse in meine Gegend zwischen den Wallanlagen gelangt, wo in kleinen saubern Mietshäusern hinter etwas Rasen und Efeu die Beamten und kleinen Rentner wohnen. Am Efeu, am Rasen, an der kleinen Tanne vorbei erreichte ich die Haustür, fand das Schlüsselloch, fand den Drücker für das Licht, schlich an den Glastüren, an den polierten Schränken und Topfpflanzen vorüber und schloß meine Stube auf, meine kleine Scheinheimat, wo der Lehnstuhl und der Ofen, das Tintenfaß und die Malschachtel, der Novalis und der Dostojewski auf mich warteten, so, wie auf andere, auf richtige Menschen, wenn sie heimkommen, die Mutter oder Frau, die Kinder, die Mägde, die Hunde, die Katzen warten.","Without stopping, the man reached mechanically into his case, pulled out a small book, and held it out to me. I quickly took it and pocketed it. While I was buttoning my coat and trying to get out some money, he turned sideways into a doorway, closed the door behind him and was gone. His heavy footsteps sounded in the yard, first on the paving stones, then on a wooden staircase, and then I heard nothing more. And suddenly I was very tired too and felt like it was very late and it was good to come home now. I ran faster and had soon reached my area between the ramparts through the sleeping suburban streets, where the civil servants and little pensioners live in small, clean apartment buildings behind some lawn and ivy. Past the ivy, the lawn, past the small fir tree, I reached the front door, found the keyhole, found the handle for the light, crept past the glass doors, past the polished cupboards and potted plants and unlocked my room, my little fake home, where the armchair and the stove, the inkwell and the box of paints, Novalis and Dostoyevsky were waiting for me, just like for others, for real people when they come home, the mother or wife, the children, the maids, the dogs, they cats are waiting.","Without stopping, the man felt mechanically in his box, pulled out a little book and held it out to me. I took it quickly and put it in my pocket. While I felt for the buttons of my coat to get out some money, he turned in at a doorway, shut the door behind him and disappeared. His heavy steps rang on a flagged yard, then on wooden stairs; and then I heard no more. And suddenly I too felt very tired. It came over me that it must be very late—and high time to go home. I walked on faster and, following the road to the suburb, I was soon in my own neighborhood among the well-kept gardens, where in, clean little apartment houses behind lawn and ivy are the dwellings of officialdom and people of modest means. Passing the ivy and the grass and the little fir tree I reached the door of the house, found the keyhole and the switch, slipped past the glazed doors, and the polished cupboards and the potted plants and unlocked the door of my room, my little pretence of a home, where the armchair and the stove, the ink-pot and the paint-box, Novalis and Dostoievski, awaited me just as do the mother, or the wife, the children, maids, dogs and cats in the case of more sensible people.","Without stopping, the man reached mechanically into his tray and took out a little booklet, which he held out to me. I took it quickly and put it in my pocket. As I was fumbling with my coat buttons, wanting to fish out some money, he turned aside into a gateway, pulled the gate to behind him and was gone. I could hear the sound of his heavy footsteps in the courtyard, first on flagstones, then on wooden stairs. After that I heard nothing more. And all at once I too was very tired. I felt as if it were very late, high time to go home. Walking faster, I had soon made my way through the sleeping suburban street to my area between the old ramparts of the city where, behind bits of lawn, the civil servants and people with small private incomes live in neat little ivy-covered blocks of rented accommodation. Walking by the ivy, the lawn and the little fir tree I came to the front door, found the keyhole, found the light switch, and crept up past the glass doors, the polished cupboards and the pot plants before unlocking the door to the attic, my little pseudo-home. The armchair and the stove, the inkwell and the box of paints, Novalis and Dostoevsky were waiting for me, just as other, normal people expect their mother or wife, the children, the maids, the dogs and cats to be waiting for them when they get back home."
"»Ja«, sagte ich, »was wir tun, ist wahrscheinlich verrückt, und wahrscheinlich ist es dennoch gut und notwendig. Es ist nicht gut, wenn die Menschheit den Verstand überanstrengt und Dinge mit Hilfe der Vernunft zu ordnen sucht, die der Vernunft noch gar nicht zugänglich sind. Dann entstehen solche Ideale wie das des Amerikaners oder das der Bolschewiken, die beide außerordentlich vernünftig sind, und die doch das Leben, weil sie es gar so naiv vereinfachen, furchtbar vergewaltigen und berauben. Das Bild des Menschen, einst ein hohes Ideal, ist im Begriff, zu einem Klischee zu werden. Wir Verrückten werden es vielleicht wieder adeln.«","'Yes,' I said, 'what we're doing is probably crazy, and yet it's probably good and necessary. It is not good when mankind overstrains the mind and tries to put things in order with the help of reason, which are not yet accessible to reason. Then arise such ideals as that of the American or that of the Bolsheviks, both of whom are extraordinarily reasonable and yet, because they simplify life so naively, they terribly violate and rob life. The image of man, once a lofty ideal, is becoming a cliché. We madmen may ennoble it again.”","""Yes,"" said I, ""what we are doing is probably mad, and probably it is good and necessary all the same. It is not a good thing when man overstrains his reason and tries to reduce to rational order matters that are not susceptible of rational treatment. Then there arise ideals such as those of the Americans or of the Bolsheviks. Both are extraordinarily rational, and both lead to a frightful oppression and impoverishment of life, because they simplify it so crudely. The likeness of man, once a high ideal, is in process of becoming a machine-made article. It is for madmen like us, perhaps, to ennoble it again.""","‘Yes,’ I said, ‘what we are doing is probably mad, but it is probably good and necessary nonetheless. When human beings push common sense too far, attempting with the aid of reason to order things that are not accessible to reason, it is not good. It gives rise to ideals like those of the Americans or those of the Bolsheviks, both of which are extraordinarily rational but nevertheless violate and impoverish life terribly because they simplify it in a way that is so utterly naive. The image of humankind, once a lofty ideal, is currently turning into a cliché. Perhaps mad people like us will be the ones to restore its nobility.’"

"Sie schüttelte sich wie unter einem leichten Frostschauer und schien aus ihrer Versunkenheit langsam zu erwachen. Ihre Augen ließen mich nicht los. Sie wurde plötzlich noch finsterer. »Es wäre klug von mir, dir das nicht zu sagen. Ich will aber nicht klug sein, Harry, diesmal nicht. Ich will etwas ganz anderes. Paß auf, hör zu! Du wirst es hören, wirst es wieder vergessen, wirst darüber lachen, wirst darüber weinen. Paß auf, Kleiner! Ich will mit dir um Leben und Tod spielen, Brüderchen, und ich will dir meine Karten, noch eh wir anfangen zu spielen, offen zeigen.« Wie schön war ihr Gesicht, wie überirdisch, als sie das sagte! In den Augen kühl und hell schwamm wissende Trauer, diese Augen schienen schon alles irgend erdenkliche Leid gelitten und ja dazu gesagt zu haben. Der Mund sprach schwer und wie behindert, etwa so, wie man spricht, wenn einem großer Frost das Gesicht erstarrt hat; aber zwischen den Lippen, in den Mundwinkeln, im Spiel der nur selten sichtbar werdenden Zungenspitze floß, im Widerspruch zu Blick und Stimme, lauter süße spielende Sinnlichkeit, inniges Lustverlangen. In die stille glatte Stirn hing eine kurze Locke herab, von dort aus, von dieser Stirnecke mit der Locke her, strömte von Zeit zu Zeit wie lebendiger Atem jene Welle von Knabenähnlichkeit, von hermaphroditischer Magie. Angstvoll hörte ich ihr zu und doch wie betäubt, wie nur halb anwesend.","She shook herself as if under a light chill and seemed to be slowly waking up from her immersion. Her eyes wouldn't let go of me. She suddenly turned even darker. 'It would be wise of me not to tell you. I don't mean to be smart, Harry, not this time. I want something completely different. Listen, listen! You will hear it, you will forget it again, you will laugh about it, you will cry about it. Watch out, little one! I want to gamble with you for life and death, little brother, and I want to show you my cards before we start playing.” How beautiful her face was, how otherworldly when she said that! Knowing sadness swam in the eyes, cool and bright, these eyes seemed to have suffered every imaginable suffering and to have said yes to it. The mouth spoke heavily and as if it were hampered, something like the way one speaks when a great frost has frozen the face; but between the lips, in the corners of the mouth, in the play of the tip of the tongue, which only rarely becomes visible, flowed, in contradiction to the look and voice, nothing but sweet, playful sensuality, an intimate desire for pleasure. A short lock of hair hung down over his calm, smooth forehead. From there, from this corner of the forehead with the curl, that wave of boyishness, of hermaphrodite magic, streamed out from time to time like living breath. I listened to her anxiously, yet stunned, half-present.","She shivered as though a passing chill went through her and seemed to be waking slowly from her trance. Her eyes did not release me. Suddenly she became still more sinister. ""If I were wise, I shouldn't tell you. But I won't be wise, Harry, not for this time. I'll be just the opposite. So now mind what I say! You will hear it and forget it again. You will laugh over it, and you will weep over it. So look out! I am going to play with you for life and death, little brother, and before we begin the game I'm going to lay my cards on the table."" How beautiful she looked, how unearthly, when she said that! Cool and clear, there swam in her eyes a conscious sadness. These eyes of hers seemed to have suffered all imaginable suffering and to have acquiesced in it. Her lips spoke with difficulty and as though something hindered them, as though a keen frost had numbed her face; but between her lips at the corners of her mouth where the tip of her tongue showed at rare intervals, there was but sweet sensuality and inward delight that contradicted the expression of her face and the tone of her voice. A short lock hung down over the smooth expanse of her forehead, and from this corner of her forehead whence fell the lock of hair, her boyishness welled up from time to time like a breath of life and cast the spell of a hermaphrodite. I listened with an eager anxiety and yet as though dazed and only half aware.","Trembling, as if suffering a slight fit of shivering, she seemed slowly to awake from her deep trance. Her eyes remained fixed on me. All of a sudden her mood became even more sombre. ‘The sensible thing to do would be not to tell you. But I don’t want to be sensible, Harry, not this time, anything but sensible. Listen carefully. You’ll hear what it is, then forget it again. It will make you laugh, then make you cry. Take note, my lad. We’re going to play for high stakes. It’s a matter of life and death, dear brother. And I want to lay my cards on the table even before we begin.’ How beautiful her face looked as she said this, how ethereal! A knowing sadness lay coolly and clearly on the surface of her eyes, eyes that seemed to have endured every sorrow it is possible to imagine and to have acquiesced in it. Words came from her mouth with difficulty, as if she had a speech impediment. She spoke roughly, as people do whose faces have been numbed by severe frost, yet – in apparent contradiction to the expression on her face and the tone of her voice – between her lips, in the corners of her mouth and in the movements of the tip of her tongue, only rarely caught sight of, all was sweet, playful, free-flowing sensuality and intense carnal desire. A short curl was hanging down on to her smooth, motionless forehead and the corner of her brow where the curl rested was the source from which that wave of boyishness, of hermaphroditic charm flowed from time to time like the breath of life. I listened to her full of anxiety, yet as if sedated, only half there."

Während ich sie mechanisch annahm und in den Fingern drehte, war der flinke kleine Kerl schon wieder verschwunden.","""Lost your number?"" a little red and yellow devil next to me asked in a shrill voice. ""There, comrade, you can have mine,"" and already held it out to me. While I took it mechanically and turned it in my fingers, the nimble little fellow was already gone again.","""Lost your number?"" came in a shrill voice from a small red and yellow devil at my elbow. ""Here, comrade, you can take mine,"" and he held it out to me without more ado. While I mechanically took it and turned it over in my fingers the brisk little fellow rapidly disappeared.","‘Lost your number?’ asked a shrill voice, that of a small devil standing next to me dressed in red and yellow. ‘Here, you can have mine, chum,’ he added, already offering it to me in his outstretched hand. I automatically took it with my fingers and by the time I had given it a twirl the nimble little chap had already vanished."

"Aus Neugierde, und ein wenig auch zur Selbstbestrafung, ging ich mit zu Agostino, dem er Milch und Medizin in seine Dachkammer brachte, eine recht elende Dachkammer, dem er das Bett frisch aufschüttelte, das Zimmer lüftete und eine hübsche kunstgerechte Kompresse um den fiebernden Kopf machte, alles rasch und zart und sachkundig, wie eine gute Krankenschwester. Am gleichen Abend sah ich ihn, bis in die Morgenstunden, in der City-Bar musizieren.","Out of curiosity, and also a little for self-punishment, I went to see Agostino, for whom he brought milk and medicine to his attic room, a very miserable attic room, for whom he freshly shook the bed, aired the room, and put a pretty, artful compress around his feverish head all quickly and delicately and competently, like a good nurse. That same evening I saw him playing music in the City Bar until the wee hours.","From curiosity and also partly to punish myself, I went with him to Agostino. He took milk and medicine to him in his attic, and a wretched one it was. He made his bed and aired the room and made a most professional compress for the fevered head, all quickly and gently and efficiently like a good sick nurse. The same evening I saw him playing till dawn in the City Bar.","Mainly out of curiosity, but also by way of self-punishment, I went with him to the garret, a truly wretched garret, where Agostino lived. Pablo took him some milk and medicine, freshened up his bed for him, aired the room, and put a neat, skilfully fashioned compress round his fevered head. All this was swiftly and gently done, with the expertise of a good nurse. That same night I saw him playing until the early hours of the morning in the City Bar."
"Verwirrt und zerschlagen fand ich mich wieder, das weiße Licht des Korridors spiegelte im blanken Boden. Ich war nicht bei den Unsterblichen, noch nicht. Ich war noch immer im Diesseits der Rätsel, der Leiden, der Steppenwölfe, der qualvollen Verwicklungen. Kein guter Ort, kein erträglicher Aufenthalt. Dem mußte ein Ende gemacht werden.","I found myself confused and battered, the white light of the corridor reflecting off the bare floor. I wasn't with the immortals, not yet. I was still in this world of riddles, suffering, steppe wolves, agonizing entanglements. Not a good place, not a bearable stay. An end had to be put to this.","• • • • • When I came to myself I was bewildered and exhausted. The white light of the corridor shone in the polished floor. I was not among the immortals, not yet. I was still, as ever, on this side of the riddle of suffering, of wolf-men and torturing complexities. I had found no happy spot, no endurable resting place. There must be an end of it.","When I came to again I was battered and bewildered. The white light of the corridor was reflected in its shiny floor. I was not in the realm of the Immortals, not yet. No, I was still in this world, the world of mystery and suffering, of Steppenwolf figures and agonizingly complex entanglements. It was not a good place to be, not a place I could abide for any length of time. I had to put an end to this existence."
"Dunstet schwül und faulig, roh und warm,","Steams sultry and foul, raw and warm,","Whipped on by fear and lust, blood raw, blood warm,","All emitting a rank, stuffy, warm and acrid dust,"
"Ich sagte das sehr forsch, aber es kam nicht von Herzen. In meinem Studierstübchen mit den Büchern konnte ich mir einen solchen, mir keineswegs sympathischen Apparat nicht vorstellen, und auch gegen das Tanzen hatte ich vieles einzuwenden. So gelegentlich, hatte ich gedacht, konnte man es ja einmal probieren, obwohl ich überzeugt war, ich sei viel zu alt und steif und würde es nicht mehr lernen. Aber nun so Schlag auf Schlag, das war mir zu rasch und heftig, und ich spürte alles in mir Widerstand leisten, was ich als alter verwöhnter Musikkenner gegen Grammophone, Jazz und moderne Tanzmusiken einzuwenden hatte. Daß jetzt in meiner Stube, neben Novalis und Jean Paul, in meiner Gedankenklause und Zuflucht amerikanische Tanzschlager erklingen und ich dazu tanzen sollte, das war eigentlich mehr, als ein Mensch von mir verlangen konnte. Aber es war ja nicht »ein Mensch«, der es verlangte; es war Hermine, und sie hatte zu befehlen. Ich gehorchte. Natürlich gehorchte ich.","I said that very briskly, but it didn't come from the heart. In my little study room with the books I could not imagine such an apparatus, which I did not like at all, and I also had many objections to the dancing. Occasionally, I thought, you could try it, although I was convinced I was much too old and stiff and wouldn't learn it anymore. But hit after hit like this was too quick and violent for me, and I felt everything in me resisting what I, as an old spoiled music connoisseur, had to object to gramophones, jazz and modern dance music. That now in my room, next to Novalis and Jean Paul, in my mental retreat and sanctuary, American dance hits should be heard and I should dance to them, that was actually more than anyone could ask of me. But it wasn't ""a person"" who asked for it; it was Hermione, and she was in charge. I obeyed. Of course I obeyed.","I brought it out very pat, but scarcely from the heart. I could not picture the detested instrument in my study among my books, and I was by no means reconciled to the dancing either. It had been in my mind that I might try how it went for a while, though I was convinced that I was too old and stiff and would never learn now. But to plunge into it all at once seemed a bit too much. As an old and fastidious connoisseur of music, I could feel my gorge rising against the gramophone and jazz and modern dance-music. It was more than any one could ask of me to have dance tunes that were the latest rage of America let loose upon the sanctum where I took refuge with Novalis and Jean Paul and to be made to dance to them. But it was not any one who asked it of me. It was Hermine, and it was for her to command, and for me to obey. Of course, I obeyed.","Although I said this with considerable force, it didn’t come from the heart. I couldn’t imagine a contraption like that, for which I had absolutely no liking, in my study with its books, and there were lots of things about dancing that I also objected to. I had thought I might give it a try one day if the opportunity arose, although I told myself I was far too old and stiff now ever to learn properly. However, embarking on it straight away like this was a bit too swift and sudden for my liking. Everything in me combined to resist the idea, all the objections I, as an old, spoiled connoisseur of music, had to gramophones, jazz and all kinds of modern dance music. To expect me to tolerate the sound of American hit-tunes in my room, my refuge, my thinker’s den with its volumes of Novalis and Jean Paul, and to dance to them, was simply too much to ask. But it wasn’t just anyone doing the asking. It was Hermione, and it was her business to give orders. It fell to me to obey. And I obeyed, of course I did."
"Dann wurde Hermine einmal ums andre zum Tanz gebeten, ich blieb allein beim Tee sitzen, hörte der Musik zu, einer Art von Musik, die ich bisher nicht hatte ausstehen können. Lieber Gott, dachte ich, nun soll ich also hier eingeführt und heimisch werden, in dieser mir so fremden und widerwärtigen, in dieser bisher von mir so sorgfältig gemiedenen, so tief verachteten Welt der Bummler und Vergnügungsmenschen, in dieser glatten, klischierten Welt der Marmortischchen, der Jazzmusik, der Kokotten, der Handlungsreisenden! Betrübt sog ich meinen Tee und starrte in die halbelegante Menge. Zwei schöne Mädchen zogen meine Blicke an, beide gute Tänzerinnen, denen ich mit Bewunderung und Neid nachblickte, wie sie elastisch, schön, fröhlich und sicher dahintanzten.","Then Hermione was asked to dance one after the other, I sat alone at tea, listening to the music, a kind of music I had previously hated. Dear God, I thought, now I should be introduced and at home here, in this world of loafers and pleasure-seekers that I have so carefully avoided and so deeply despised, so alien and disgusting to me, in this smooth, clichéd world of little marble tables , the jazz music, the cocottes, the traveling salesmen! I sipped my tea sadly and stared at the semi-elegant crowd. Two beautiful girls attracted my attention, both good dancers, whom I looked after with admiration and envy, as they danced along elastically, beautifully, happily and confidently.","Then Hermine was asked to dance again, and I was left alone to drink tea and listen to the music, a kind of music that I had never till that day known how to endure. Good God, I thought, so now I am to be initiated, and made to feel at home in this world of idlers and pleasure seekers, a world that is utterly strange and repugnant to me and that to this day I have always carefully avoided and utterly despised, a smooth and stereotyped world of marble-topped tables, jazz music, cocottes and commercial travelers! Sadly, I swallowed my tea and stared at the crowd of second-rate elegance. Two beautiful girls caught my eye. They were both good dancers. I followed their movements with admiration and envy. How elastic, how beautiful and gay and certain their steps!","Then Hermione was invited to dance time and again. I remained sitting on my own at the tea table, listening to the music, the sort of music I had until now been unable to stand. Good God, I thought, I’m now being initiated into and expected to feel at home in a place like this, a world that is so strange and abhorrent to me, a world that until now I’ve taken such care to avoid and so profoundly despised as a world of layabouts and pleasure-seekers, this sleek, typecast world of marble-top tables, jazz music, cocottes and commercial travellers! Feeling depressed, I gulped down my tea and stared at the semi-chic crowd on the dance floor. My eyes were drawn to two beautiful girls, both good dancers. Full of admiration and envy, I watched as they swept lithely and appealingly, gaily and confidently across the floor."
"Hier muß ich eine psychologische Anmerkung einfügen. Obgleich ich über das Leben des Steppenwolfes sehr wenig weiß, habe ich doch allen Grund zu vermuten, daß er von liebevollen, aber strengen und sehr frommen Eltern und Lehrern in jenem Sinne erzogen wurde, der das »Brechen des Willens« zur Grundlage der Erziehung macht. Dieses Vernichten der Persönlichkeit und Brechen des Willens nun war bei diesem Schüler nicht gelungen, dazu war er viel zu stark und hart, viel zu stolz und geistig. Statt seine Persönlichkeit zu vernichten, war es nur gelungen, ihn sich selbst hassen zu lehren. Gegen sich selber, gegen dies unschuldige und edle Objekt richtete er nun zeitlebens die ganze Genialität seiner Phantasie, die ganze Stärke seines Denkvermögens. Denn darin war er, trotz allem, durch und durch Christ und durch und durch Märtyrer, daß er jede Schärfe, jede Kritik, jede Bosheit, jeden Haß, dessen er fähig war, vor allem und zuerst auf sich selbst losließ. Was die anderen, was die Umwelt betraf, so machte er beständig die heldenhaftesten und ernstesten Versuche, sie zu lieben, ihnen gerecht zu werden, ihnen nicht weh zu tun, denn das »Liebe deinen Nächsten« war ihm ebenso tief eingebläut wie das Hassen seiner selbst, und so war sein ganzes Leben ein Beispiel dafür, daß ohne Liebe zu sich selbst auch die Nächstenliebe unmöglich ist, daß der Selbsthaß genau dasselbe ist und am Ende genau dieselbe grausige Isoliertheit und Verzweiflung erzeugt wie der grelle Egoismus.","Here I must add a psychological note. Although I know very little about the life of the steppenwolf, I have every reason to suspect that it was brought up by loving but strict and very pious parents and teachers in that sense which makes ""breaking the will"" the basis of upbringing . This destruction of the personality and breaking of the will had not succeeded with this pupil, he was much too strong and hard, much too proud and spiritual. Instead of destroying his personality, it had only succeeded in teaching him to hate himself. All his life he directed the whole genius of his imagination, the whole strength of his thinking ability, against himself, against this innocent and noble object. For in spite of everything he was a Christian through and through and a martyr through and through, in that he let loose every sharpness, every criticism, every malice, every hatred of which he was capable, first and foremost on himself. As for the others, as far as the environment was concerned, he constantly made the most heroic and earnest attempts to love them, to do them justice, not to hurt them, because ""love your neighbor"" was drilled into him as deeply as hating his himself, and so his whole life was an example of the fact that without love for oneself love of neighbor is also impossible, that self-hatred is exactly the same and in the end produces exactly the same horrible isolation and despair as glaring egoism.","And here I cannot refrain from a psychological observation. Although I know very little of the Steppenwolf's life, I have all the same good reason to suppose that he was brought up by devoted but severe and very pious parents and teachers in accordance with that doctrine that makes the breaking of the will the corner-stone of education and upbringing. But in this case the attempt to destroy the personality and to break the will did not succeed. He was much too strong and hardy, too proud and spirited. Instead of destroying his personality they succeeded only in teaching him to hate himself. It was against himself that, innocent and noble as he was, he directed during his whole life the whole wealth of his fancy, the whole of his thought; and in so far as he let loose upon himself every barbed criticism, every anger and hate he could command, he was, in spite of all, a real Christian and a real martyr. As for others and the world around him he never ceased in his heroic and earnest endeavor to love them, to be just to them, to do them no harm, for the love of his neighbor was as deeply in him as the hatred of himself, and so his whole life was an example that love of one's neighbor is not possible without love of oneself, and that self-hate is really the same thing as sheer egoism, and in the long run breeds the same cruel isolation and despair.","At this point I can’t help including a psychological comment. Although I know very little about Steppenwolf’s life, I do have every reason to suppose that he was brought up by loving yet strict and very religious parents and teachers in that spirit which makes ‘breaking of the will’ the foundation of child-rearing and education. In the case of this pupil, however, their attempt to destroy his personality and break his will had not succeeded. He was far too strong and tough, far too proud and mentally alert for that to happen. Instead of destroying his personality they had only succeeded in teaching him to hate himself. Now, for the rest of his life, it was against himself, against this innocent and admirable target, that all his imaginative genius and brainpower was directed. For in one respect he was, despite everything, a Christian through and through, a martyr through and through. That is to say, he aimed every cutting remark, every criticism, all the malice and hatred he was capable of, first and foremost at himself. As far as others around him were concerned, he made the most heroic and earnest efforts to love them, to be fair to them, not to hurt them; for ‘Love thy neighbour’ had been drummed into him just as deeply as hatred of self. Thus his whole life was an example of how impossible it is to love one’s neighbour without loving oneself, proof that self-hatred is exactly the same thing as crass egotism, and in the end leads to exactly the same terrible isolation and despair."
"Schon beim allerersten Anblick, als er durch die Glastür der Tante hereintrat, den Kopf so vogelartig reckte und den guten Geruch des Hauses rühmte, war mir irgendwie das Besondere an diesem Manne aufgefallen, und meine erste naive Reaktion darauf war Widerwille gewesen. Ich spürte (und meine Tante, die im Gegensatz zu mir ja ganz und gar kein intellektueller Mensch ist, spürte ziemlich genau dasselbe) – ich spürte, daß der Mann krank sei, auf irgendeine Art geistes- oder gemüts- oder charakterkrank, und wehrte mich dagegen mit dem Instinkt des Gesunden. Diese Abwehr wurde im Lauf der Zeit abgelöst durch Sympathie, beruhend auf einem großen Mitleid mit diesem tief und dauernd Leidenden, dessen Vereinsamung und inneres Sterben ich mit ansah. In dieser Periode kam mir mehr und mehr zum Bewußtsein, daß die Krankheit dieses Leidenden nicht auf irgendwelchen Mängeln seiner Natur beruhe, sondern im Gegenteil nur auf dem nicht zur Harmonie gelangten großen Reichtum seiner Gaben und Kräfte. Ich erkannte, daß Haller ein Genie des Leidens sei, daß er, im Sinne mancher Aussprüche Nietzsches, in sich eine geniale, eine unbegrenzte, furchtbare Leidensfähigkeit herangebildet habe. Zugleich erkannte ich, daß nicht Weltverachtung, sondern Selbstverachtung die Basis seines Pessimismus sei, denn so schonungslos und vernichtend er von Institutionen oder Personen reden konnte, nie schloß er sich aus, immer war er selbst der erste, gegen den er seine Pfeile richtete, war er selbst der erste, den er haßte und verneinte . . .","From the very first sight, when he walked in through my aunt's glass door, cocking his head like a bird and praising the good smell of the house, I had somehow noticed something special about this man, and my first naive reaction to it had been disgust. I sensed (and my aunt, who is not at all intellectual like me, sensed pretty much the same thing) - sensed that the man was ill, in some way mentally or emotionally or emotionally ill or of character, and I resisted on the other hand, with the instinct of the healthy. In the course of time this defense was replaced by sympathy, based on a great pity for this deeply and constantly suffering man, whose loneliness and inner death I watched with. During this period I became more and more aware that the illness of this sufferer was not due to any defects in his nature, but on the contrary only to the great wealth of his gifts and powers that had not been brought into harmony. I recognized that Haller was a genius of suffering, that, in the sense of some of Nietzsche's sayings, he had cultivated an ingenious, unlimited, terrible capacity for suffering. At the same time I recognized that the basis of his pessimism was not contempt for the world, but self-contempt, because no matter how ruthlessly and devastatingly he could speak of institutions or people, he never excluded himself, he himself was always the first against whom he aimed his arrows himself the first he hated and denied . . .","At the very first sight of him, when he came into my aunt's home, craning his head like a bird and praising the smell of the house, I was at once astonished by something curious about him; and my first natural reaction was repugnance. I suspected (and my aunt, who unlike me is the very reverse of an intellectual person, suspected very much the same thing)—I suspected that the man was ailing, ailing in the spirit in some way, or in his temperament or character, and I shrank from him with the instinct of the healthy. This shrinking was in course of time replaced by a sympathy inspired by pity for one who had suffered so long and deeply, and whose loneliness and inward death I witnessed. In course of time I was more and more conscious, too, that this affliction was not due to any defects of nature, but rather to a profusion of gifts and powers which had not attained to harmony. I saw that Haller was a genius of suffering and that in the meaning of many sayings of Nietzsche he had created within himself with positive genius a boundless and frightful capacity for pain. I saw at the same time that the root of his pessimism was not world-contempt but self-contempt; for however mercilessly he might annihilate institutions and persons in his talk he never spared himself. It was always at himself first and foremost that he aimed the shaft, himself first and foremost whom he hated and despised.","Even on that very first occasion, when I saw him enter my aunt’s flat by the glass door and cock his head in bird-like fashion, praising the place because it smelled so good, I’d been struck by the peculiarity of the man, and my initial naive reaction had been to dislike him. I sensed (and my aunt, who in contrast to me isn’t remotely intellectual, sensed almost exactly the same thing) that the man was ill, in some way or other mentally or temperamentally ill, and like all sane people my instinct was to defend myself against him. In the course of time, my defensiveness gave way to a sympathy based on great compassion for someone constantly and acutely suffering, a man whose progressive isolation and emotional decay I was witnessing with my own eyes. During that period I became increasingly aware that the illness he was suffering from didn’t stem from any deficiencies in his nature. On the contrary, he had strengths and talents in abundance, but had never managed to combine them harmoniously, and that was his only problem. I came to realize that Haller had a peculiar genius for suffering, that he had, in the sense that Nietzsche intends in many of his aphorisms, trained himself to the point where his capacity for suffering was masterly, limitless, awesome. At the same time I realized that his pessimism wasn’t based on contempt for the world but on self-contempt, for however ruthlessly critical he could be when condemning institutions or individuals, he never spared himself. He himself was always the first target of his barbed remarks, the prime object of his hatred and rejection."
"»Ganz richtig«, sagte ich, von seinem Ministerblick durchkältet. »Wir jungen Leute sind in der Tat nicht mit Ihnen einverstanden, alter Herr. Sie sind uns zu feierlich, Exzellenz, und zu eitel und wichtigtuerisch und zu wenig aufrichtig. Dies dürfte das Wesentliche sein: zu wenig aufrichtig.«","""Quite right,"" I said, chilled by his ministerial gaze. 'We young people do not agree with you, old sir. You are too solemn for us, Your Excellency, and too vain and self-important and not sincere enough. This should be the essence: not sincere enough.«","""You are quite right,"" said I, chilled by his ministerial glance. ""We young people have, indeed, very little appreciation of you. You are too pompous for us, Excellency, too vain and pompous, and not outright enough. That is, no doubt, at the bottom of it—not outright enough.""","‘Quite right,’ I said, chilled to the core by the ministerial look in his eye. ‘We youngsters are indeed unable to agree with you, ageing Sir. You are much too solemn for our liking; too vain and pompous; not honest enough, Your Excellency. Not honest enough, that is probably the nub of the matter.’"

"Aber siehe, beim nächsten Mal ging es in der Tat besser und begann mir sogar Spaß zu machen, und am Schluß der Stunde behauptete Hermine, den Foxtrott könne ich jetzt.

"»Du hattest ein Bild vom Leben in dir, einen Glauben, eine Forderung, du warst zu Taten, Leiden und Opfern bereit – und dann merktest du allmählich, daß die Welt gar keine Taten und Opfer und dergleichen von dir verlangt, daß das Leben keine heroische Dichtung ist, mit Heldenrollen und dergleichen, sondern eine bürgerliche gute Stube, wo man mit Essen und Trinken, Kaffee und Strickstrumpf, Tarockspiel und Radiomusik vollkommen zufrieden ist. Und wer das andere will und in sich hat, das Heldenhafte und Schöne, die Verehrung der großen Dichter oder die Verehrung der Heiligen, der ist ein Narr und ein Ritter Don Quichotte. Gut. Und mir ist es ebenso gegangen, mein Freund! Ich war ein Mädchen von guten Gaben und dafür bestimmt, nach einem hohen Vorbild zu leben, hohe Forderungen an mich zu stellen, würdige Aufgaben zu erfüllen. Ich konnte ein großes Los auf mich nehmen, die Frau eines Königs sein, die Geliebte eines Revolutionärs, die Schwester eines Genies, die Mutter eines Märtyrers. Und das Leben hat mir nur eben erlaubt, eine Kurtisane von leidlich gutem Geschmack zu werden – schon das ist mir schwer genug gemacht worden! So ist es mir gegangen. Ich war eine Weile trostlos, und ich habe lange Zeit die Schuld an mir selber gesucht. Das Leben, dachte ich, muß doch schließlich immer recht haben, und wenn das Leben meine schönen Träume verhöhnte, so dachte ich, es werden eben meine Träume dumm gewesen sein und unrecht gehabt haben. Aber das half gar nichts. Und weil ich gute Augen und Ohren hatte und auch etwas neugierig war, sah ich mir das sogenannte Leben recht genau an, meine Bekannten und Nachbarn, fünfzig und mehr Menschen und Schicksale, und da sah ich, Harry: meine Träume hatten recht gehabt, tausendmal recht, ebenso wie deine. Das Leben aber, die Wirklichkeit, hatte unrecht. Daß eine Frau von meiner Art keine andere Wahl fand, als an einer Schreibmaschine im Dienst eines Geldverdieners ärmlich und sinnlos zu altern, oder einen solchen Geldverdiener um seines Geldes willen zu heiraten, oder aber eine Art von Dirne zu werden, das war ebensowenig richtig, als daß ein Mensch wie du einsam, scheu und verzweifelt nach dem Rasiermesser greifen muß. Bei mir war das Elend vielleicht mehr materiell und moralisch, bei dir mehr geistig – der Weg war der gleiche. Glaubst du, ich könne deine Angst vor dem Foxtrott, deinen Widerwillen gegen die Bars und Tanzdielen, dein Sichsträuben gegen Jazzmusik und all den Kram nicht verstehen? Allzu gut versteh ich sie, und ebenso deinen Abscheu vor der Politik, deine Trauer über das Geschwätz und verantwortungslose Getue der Parteien, der Presse, deine Verzweiflung über den Krieg, über den gewesenen und über die kommenden, über die Art, wie man heute denkt, liest, baut, Musik macht, Feste feiert, Bildung betreibt! Recht hast du, Steppenwolf, tausendmal recht, und doch mußt du untergehen. Du bist für diese einfache, bequeme, mit so wenigem zufriedene Welt von heute viel zu anspruchsvoll und hungrig, sie speit dich aus, du hast für sie eine Dimension zuviel. Wer heute leben und seines Lebens froh werden will, der darf kein Mensch sein wie du und ich. Wer statt Gedudel Musik, statt Vergnügen Freude, statt Geld Seele, statt Betrieb echte Arbeit, statt Spielerei echte Leidenschaft verlangt, für den ist diese hübsche Welt hier keine Heimat . . .«","""You had an image of life in you, a belief, a demand, you were ready for deeds, suffering and sacrifices - and then you gradually realized that the world does not demand any deeds and sacrifices and the like from you, that life does not demand any heroic poetry, with heroic roles and the like, but a bourgeois living room where one is perfectly content with food and drink, coffee and knitted stockings, tarot games and radio music. And whoever wants the other and has it within him, the heroic and the beautiful, the veneration of the great poets or the veneration of the saints, is a fool and a knight Don Quixote. Good. And so did I, my friend! I was a girl of good gifts, destined to live by a high example, to make high demands of myself, to fulfill worthy tasks. I could meet a great fate, be the wife of a king, the mistress of a revolutionary, the sister of a genius, the mother of a martyr. And life has only just allowed me to become a courtesan of tolerably good taste - that's been made difficult enough for me! That's what happened to me. I was disconsolate for a while, and for a long time I blamed myself. Life, I thought, must always be right after all, and if life mocked my beautiful dreams, I thought my dreams must have been stupid and wrong. But that didn't help at all. And because I had good eyes and ears and was also a bit curious, I took a very close look at so-called life, my acquaintances and neighbors, fifty or more people and destinies, and then I saw, Harry: my dreams had been right, a thousand times over right, as are yours. But life, reality, was wrong. That a woman of my kind had no choice but to grow old needlessly at a typewriter in the service of a money-maker, or to marry such a money-maker for his money's sake, or to become a kind of whore, that was just as wrong, than that a person like you, lonely, shy and desperate, has to reach for the razor. With me the misery was perhaps more material and moral, with you more spiritual - the path was the same. Do you think I can't understand your fear of the foxtrot, your dislike of the bars and dance floors, your reluctance to jazz music and all that stuff? I understand you all too well, and also your abhorrence of politics, your sadness at the gossip and irresponsible behavior of the parties, the press, your despair about the war, about the past and about the war to come, about the way people think today , reads, builds, makes music, celebrates, does education! You are right, Steppenwolf, a thousand times right, and yet you must perish. You are far too demanding and hungry for today's simple, comfortable, content with so little world, it spits you out, you have one dimension too many for it. Anyone who wants to live today and be happy with his life must not be a person like you and me. Anyone who demands music instead of tooting, joy instead of pleasure, soul instead of money, real work instead of business, real passion instead of gimmicks, this pretty world is not a home for them. . .«","""You have a picture of life within you, a faith, a challenge, and you were ready for deeds and sufferings and sacrifices, and then you became aware by degrees that the world asked no deeds and no sacrifices of you whatever, and that life is no poem of heroism with heroic parts to play and so on, but a comfortable room where people are quite content with eating and drinking, coffee and knitting, cards and wireless. And whoever wants more and has got it in him—the heroic and the beautiful, and the reverence for the great poets or for the saints—is a fool and a Don Quixote. Good. And it has been just the same for me, my friend. I was a gifted girl. I was meant to live up to a high standard, to expect much of myself and do great things. I could have played a great part. I could have been the wife of a king, the beloved of a revolutionary, the sister of a genius, the mother of a martyr. And life has allowed me just this, to be a courtesan of fairly good taste, and even that has been hard enough. That is how things have gone with me. For a while I was inconsolable and for a long time I put the blame on myself. Life, thought I, must in the end be in the right, and if life scorned my beautiful dreams, so I argued, it was my dreams that were stupid and wrong headed. But that did not help me at all. And as I had good eyes and ears and was a little inquisitive too, I took a good look at this so-called life and at my neighbors and acquaintances, fifty or so of them and their destinies, and then I saw you. And I knew that my dreams had been right a thousand times over, just as yours had been. It was life and reality that were wrong. It was as little right that a woman like me should have no other choice than to grow old in poverty and in a senseless way at a typewriter in the pay of a money-maker, or to marry such a man for his money's sake, or to become some kind of drudge, as for a man like you to be forced in his loneliness and despair to have recourse to a razor. Perhaps the trouble with me was more material and moral and with you more spiritual—but it was the same road. Do you think I can't understand your horror of the fox trot, your dislike of bars and dancing floors, your loathing of jazz and the rest of it? I understand it only too well, and your dislike of politics as well, your despondence over the chatter and irresponsible antics of the parties and the press, your despair over the war, the one that has been and the one that is to be, over all that people nowadays think, read and build, over the music they play, the celebrations they hold, the education they carry on. You are right, Steppenwolf, right a thousand times over, and yet you must go to the wall. You are much too exacting and hungry for this simple, easygoing and easily contented world of today. You have a dimension too many. Whoever wants to live and enjoy his life today must not be like you and me. Whoever wants music instead of noise, joy instead of pleasure, soul instead of gold, creative work instead of business, passion instead of foolery, finds no home in this trivial world of ours—"" She looked down and fell into meditation.","‘You had an image of life in your head, a faith, a challenge. You were prepared to do great things, to suffer, to make sacrifices – and then bit by bit you noticed that the world wasn’t demanding great deeds, sacrifices and the like from you at all; that life wasn’t an epic poem with heroic roles and that kind of thing, but more like the parlour of a conventional household where the inhabitants are perfectly content to eat, drink coffee, knit stockings, play cards and listen to music on the radio. And anyone wanting the other heroic and noble life, and having it in them, anyone venerating great writers or venerating the saints, is a fool and a Don Quixote. Good. And my experience, my friend, was exactly the same! I was a gifted girl, destined to live according to high ideals, to make high demands on myself and to carry out worthy tasks. I had the ability to take on great responsibilities, to be the wife of a king, the lover of a revolutionary, the sister of a genius, the mother of a martyr. But all that life allowed me to become was a courtesan of reasonably good taste, and even that was made difficult enough for me! That is how I fared. For quite a while I was disconsolate, for a long time I sought to blame myself. Surely, I thought, when all’s said and done, life must always be right. If life treated my beautiful dreams with derision, my dreams must simply have been stupid and wrong, I thought. But that was of no help at all. And since I had good eyes and ears, and a rather inquisitive nature, I took a really close look at so-called life, at people I knew and my neighbours, fifty or more individuals and their fates. And what did I see, Harry? That my dreams had been right, a thousand times right, just as yours were, whereas life, reality, was wrong. That a woman of my kind should have no alternative but to grow old sitting at a typewriter, working pointlessly and for a pittance in the service of someone well paid, or to marry someone like that for the sake of his money, or else to become a kind of whore – all that seemed just as wrong as someone lonely, shy and in despair like you being forced to reach for his razor. The misery I went through was perhaps more financial and moral, yours more intellectual and spiritual, but our journeys were the same. Do you think I’m incapable of understanding your fear of the foxtrot, your distaste for bars and dance floors, your resistance to jazz music and all that sort of stuff? I understand it all only too well, just as I do your disgust with politics, your sadness at the way the parties and the press ramble on and kick up a fuss about things, your despair over wars, the one there has just been and those still to come, and about modern habits of thinking, reading, building, making music, celebrating things and providing education! You are right, Steppenwolf, a thousand times right, and yet you must perish. You are far too demanding, too hungry for today’s straightforward, cosy world, satisfied as it is with so little. You have one dimension too many for its liking, so it will spit you out. It is impossible for anyone wishing to live and enjoy life in today’s world to be like you or me. It is no home, this fine world, for people like us who, instead of nonsensical noise, demand music; instead of pleasure, joy; instead of money, soul; instead of industrial production, genuine labour; instead of frivolity, genuine passion …’ She looked down at the ground, deep in thought."
"Ich besaß in meiner Reiseapotheke ein vorzügliches Mittel, um Schmerzen zu stillen, ein besonders starkes Opiumpräparat, dessen Genuß ich mir nur sehr selten gönnte und oft monatelang vorenthielt; ich nahm dies schwer betäubende Mittel nur dann, wenn körperliche Schmerzen mich bis zur Unerträglichkeit plagten. Zum Selbstmord war es leider nicht geeignet, ich hatte dies vor mehreren Jahren einmal ausprobiert. Da hatte ich in einer Zeit, als wieder einmal Verzweiflung mich umgab, eine hübsche Menge davon geschluckt, genug, um sechs Menschen zu töten, und es hatte mich doch nicht getötet. Ich schlief zwar ein und lag einige Stunden in vollkommener Betäubung, wurde dann aber, zu meiner furchtbaren Enttäuschung, durch heftige Zuckungen des Magens halb erweckt, erbrach, ohne ganz zu mir zu kommen, das ganze Gift und schlief wieder ein, um in der Mitte des nächsten Tages endgültig aufzuwachen, zu einer grauenhaften Nüchternheit, mit verbranntem, leerem Gehirn und fast ganz ohne Gedächtnis. Außer einer Periode von Schlaflosigkeit und lästigen Magenschmerzen blieb keine Wirkung des Giftes übrig.","In my first-aid kit I had an excellent remedy for relieving pain, a particularly strong opium preparation, which I rarely indulged in and often withheld for months; I only took this heavily numbing drug when physical pain was plaguing me to the point of being unbearable. Unfortunately, it wasn't suitable for suicide, I tried it once several years ago. There, at a time when desperation once again surrounded me, I'd swallowed a fair amount of it, enough to kill six people, and yet it hadn't killed me. I fell asleep and lay in a complete stupor for some hours, but then, to my terrible disappointment, was half awakened by violent spasms of the stomach, vomited all the poison without quite waking up, and fell asleep again, about halfway through finally waking up the next day, to a horrible sobriety, with a burned, empty brain and almost no memory at all. Apart from a period of insomnia and annoying stomach pains, no effect of the poison remained.","I had in my medicine chest an excellent means of stilling pain—an unusually strong tincture of laudanum. I indulged very rarely in it and often refrained from using it for months at a time. I had recourse to the drug only when physical pain plagued me beyond endurance. Unfortunately, it was of no use in putting an end to myself. I had proved this some years before. Once when despair had again got the better of me I had swallowed a big dose of it—enough to kill six men, and yet it had not killed me. I fell asleep, it is true, and lay for several hours completely stupefied; but then to my frightful disappointment I was half awakened by violent convulsions of the stomach and fell asleep once more. It was the middle of the next day when I woke up in earnest in a state of dismal sobriety. My empty brain was burning and I had almost lost my memory. Apart from a spell of insomnia and severe pains in the stomach no trace of the poison was left.","In my travelling medicine chest I had an excellent painkiller, a particularly strong opiate that I only rarely resorted to, often denying myself for months on end the relief it brought. Only when racked by pain to the point where my body could no longer stand it did I take this potent analgesic. Unfortunately it was not suitable for committing suicide. I had tried it out years ago when once again engulfed in despair. I had swallowed a fair old quantity of it, enough to kill six people, and still it did not kill me. It did put me to sleep, and I lay there fully anaesthetized for a few hours, but to my terrible disappointment I was then half wakened by strong stomach convulsions. Without fully coming to, I brought up all the poison and went to sleep again, only finally waking up midway through the next day. I felt horribly sober, burned out and empty-headed, scarcely able to remember a thing. Apart from a spell of sleeplessness and irritating stomach pains the poison had no after-effects."
"Weiter lief ich, durch die langen Korridore voll zärtlichen Gedränges, die Treppen hinab, in die Hölle. Dort brannten an pechschwarzen Wänden grelle böse Lampen, und die Teufelskapelle spielte fiebernd. Auf einem hohen Barstuhl saß ein hübscher Jüngling ohne Maske, im Frack, der musterte mich kurz mit einem spöttischen Blick. Ich ward vom Tanzstrudel an die Wand gedrückt, gegen zwanzig Paare tanzten in dem sehr engen Raum. Gierig und ängstlich beobachtete ich alle Frauen, die meisten waren noch maskiert, einige lachten mich an, aber keine war Hermine. Spöttisch blickte der schöne Jüngling vom hohen Barstuhl herüber. In der nächsten Tanzpause, dachte ich, würde sie kommen und mich anrufen. Der Tanz ging zu Ende, aber niemand kam.","I ran further, through the long corridors full of tender crowds, down the stairs, into hell. There, glaring, evil lamps burned on pitch-black walls, and the devil's band played feverishly. On a high bar stool sat a handsome young man without a mask, in tails, who gave me a quick mocking look. I was pressed against the wall by the dancing whirlpool, around twenty couples were dancing in the very narrow space. I watched all the women greedily and fearfully, most were still masked, some laughed at me, but none was Hermione. The handsome young man looked over mockingly from the high bar stool. At the next dance break, I thought, she would come and call me. The dance ended, but no one came.","On I went through the long corridors, luxuriously thronged, and down the stairs to hell. There, on pitch-black walls shone wicked garish lights, and the orchestra of devils was playing feverishly. On a high stool at the bar there was seated a pretty young fellow without a mask and in evening dress who scrutinized me with a cursory and mocking glance. Pressed to the wall by the swirl of dancers—about twenty couples were dancing in this very confined space—I examined all the women with eager suspense. Most were still in masks and smiled at me, but none was Hermine. The handsome youth on the high stool glanced mockingly at me. At the next pause, thought I, she will come and summon me. The dance ended but no one came.","On I went, along the corridors milling with flirting couples, down the stairs to hell. There, on the pitch-black walls, infernally harsh lights were burning and the musical devils were feverishly playing away. A handsome youth without a mask was sitting on a tall bar stool in evening dress. With an air of disdain he briefly looked me up and down. Getting on for twenty couples were dancing in the very cramped space and I was forced up against the wall by the whirling crush. Avidly and nervously I observed all the women. Most of them were still wearing their masks; a few laughed at me; but none of them was Hermione. The handsome youth, perched on his bar stool, was looking scornfully across at me. The next time there was a break in the dancing Hermione would call out to me, I thought. But the dancing finished and nobody came."

"Dies hingegen war mir zu stark, der Zorn ließ mir keine Zeit mehr, der Wehmut nachzuhängen. Ich packte Mozart am Zopf, er flog davon, der Zopf wurde länger und länger, wie ein Kometenschweif, an dessen Ende ich hing und durch die Welt gewirbelt wurde. Teufel, war es kalt in dieser Welt! Diese Unsterblichen vertrugen eine scheußlich dünne Eisluft. Aber sie machte vergnügt, diese eisige Luft, das spürte ich noch in dem kurzen Augenblick, eh mir die Sinne vergingen. Es durchdrang mich eine bitterscharfe, stahlblanke, eisige Heiterkeit, eine Lust, ebenso hell, wild und außerirdisch zu lachen, wie Mozart es getan hatte. Aber da war Atem und Bewußtsein zu Ende.","This, however, was too strong for me, the anger left me no time to indulge in melancholy. I grabbed Mozart's braid, he flew away, the braid grew longer and longer, like a comet's tail, at the end of which I was hanging and being whirled through the world. Hell, was it cold in this world! These immortals could stand a hideously thin icy air. But it made me happy, this icy air, I felt that for just a moment before I lost my senses. A bitter, sharp, steely, icy cheerfulness penetrated me, a desire to laugh just as brightly, wildly and extraterrestrially as Mozart had done. But that was the end of breath and consciousness.","This, however, was too much for me. Anger left me no time for melancholy. I caught hold of Mozart by the pigtail and off he flew. The pigtail grew longer and longer like the tail of a comet and I was whirled along at the end of it. The devil— but it was cold in this world we traversed! These immortals put up with a rarefied and glacial atmosphere. But it was delightful all the same—this icy air. I could tell that, even in the brief moment that elapsed before I lost my senses. A bitter-sharp and steel-bright icy gaiety coursed through me and a desire to laugh as shrilly and wildly and unearthly as Mozart had done. But then breath and consciousness failed me. • •","This was simply too much to take. There was no time to dwell on my former melancholy now. I was so angry that I seized Mozart by his pigtail, which grew longer and longer like the tail of a comet as he hurtled off into space with me whirling along behind. God, it was cold out there! What a glacial, rarefied atmosphere these Immortals were able to survive in! Yet it put you in a cheerful mood, this ice-cold air; as I was just able to appreciate for a brief moment before falling unconscious. It was a bitterly sharp, icy cheerfulness that I felt penetrating my being like cold steel, and it made me want to laugh in just as bright, uninhibited and unearthly a manner as Mozart had done. But then, before I had chance to, I stopped breathing and lost consciousness."

"In der Tat war kein ernstes Wort mehr mit dem Mann zu reden, er tänzelte vergnügt und gelenkig auf und nieder und ließ die Primel aus seinem Stern bald wie eine Rakete herausschießen, bald klein werden und verschwinden.

Da fiel der Skorpion mir wieder ein, oder vielmehr Molly, und ich rief Goethe zu: »Sagen Sie, ist Molly nicht da?«","In fact, there was no longer a serious word to be spoken to the man, he danced happily and flexibly up and down and let the primrose shoot out of his star like a rocket, then grow small and disappear. While he excelled in his dancing steps and figures, I had to think that at least this man had not failed to learn to dance. He was wonderful at it. Then I remembered the scorpion, or rather Molly, and called to Goethe: ""Tell me, isn't Molly there?""","And indeed there was no saying another serious word to the man. He capered joyfully and nimbly up and down and made the primrose shoot out from his star like a rocket and then he made it shrink and disappear.

Then I remembered the scorpion, or Molly, rather, and I called out to Goethe: ""Tell me, is Molly there?""","From now on, in fact, it was quite impossible to talk seriously to the man.

"Und so hatte ich traurig mein Licht gelöscht, traurig mein Schlafzimmer aufgesucht, traurig mit dem Entkleiden begonnen, da machte ein ungewohnter Duft mich stutzig, es roch leicht nach Parfüm, und umblickend sah ich in meinem Bett die schöne Maria liegen, lächelnd, etwas bange, mit großen blauen Augen.","And so I sadly turned off my light, sadly went to my bedroom, sadly started to undress, when an unfamiliar scent made me suspicious, it smelled faintly of perfume, and looking around I saw beautiful Maria lying in my bed, smiling, a little afraid , with big blue eyes.","And so I had sadly put out the light and taken myself to my bedroom and sadly begun to undress; and then I was surprised by an unaccustomed smell. There was a faint aroma of scent, and looking round I saw the lovely Maria lying in my bed, smiling and a little startled, with large blue eyes.","And in this sad frame of mind I had put out the light, made my way sadly to my bedroom and begun sadly to undress, when I smelled something unusual that made me stop short.

"Tiefer als alles andre aber beschäftigte mich jene Halluzination oder Vision an der Kirchenmauer, die verheißungsvolle Ankündigung jener tanzenden Lichtschrift, die mit Andeutungen des Traktates übereinstimmte. Viel war mir da versprochen worden, gewaltig hatten die Stimmen jener fremden Welt meine Neugierde angestachelt, oft sann ich lange Stunden ganz versunken darüber nach. Und immer deutlicher sprach dann die Warnung jener Inschriften zu mir: »Nicht für jedermann!« und »Nur für Verrückte!« Verrückt also mußte ich sein und weit abgerückt von »jedermann«, wenn jene Stimmen mich erreichen, jene Welten zu mir sprechen sollten. Mein Gott, war ich denn nicht längst weit genug entfernt vom Leben jedermanns, vom Dasein und Denken der Normalen, war ich nicht längst reichlich abgesondert und verrückt? Und dennoch verstand ich im Innersten den Zuruf recht wohl, die Aufforderung zum Verrücktsein, zum Wegwerfen der Vernunft, der Hemmung, der Bürgerlichkeit, zur Hingabe an die flutende gesetzlose Welt der Seele, der Phantasie.","But more deeply than anything else I was concerned with that hallucination or vision on the church wall, the auspicious proclamation of that dancing illuminated writing which corresponded with intimations of the tract. Much had been promised to me there, the voices of that foreign world had roused my curiosity tremendously, and I often thought about it for long hours, completely absorbed. And then the warning in those inscriptions spoke to me more and more clearly: ""Not for everyone!"" and ""Only for crazy people!"" So I had to be crazy and far removed from ""everyone"" if those voices were to reach me, those worlds were to speak to me . My God, wasn't I far enough removed from the life of everyone, from the existence and thinking of the normal, wasn't I pretty isolated and crazy by now? And yet, deep down, I understood the call quite well, the call to be mad, to throw away reason, inhibitions, bourgeoisie, to surrender to the flooding, lawless world of the soul, of imagination.","What, however, occupied my thoughts more than all else was the hallucination, or vision, of the church wall. The announcement made by the dancing illuminated letters promised much that was hinted at in the treatise, and the voices of that strange world had powerfully aroused my curiosity. For hours I pondered deeply over them. On these occasions I was more and more impressed by the warning of that inscription—""Not for everybody!"" and ""For madmen only!"" Madman, then, I must certainly be and far from the mold of ""everybody"" if those voices reached me and that world spoke to me. In heaven's name, had I not long ago been remote from the life of everybody and from normal thinking and normal existence? Had I not long ago given ample margin to isolation and madness? All the same, I understood the summons well enough in my innermost heart. Yes, I understood the invitation to madness and the jettison of reason and the escape from the clogs of convention in surrender to the unbridled surge of spirit and fantasy.","However, what preoccupied me most was that hallucination or vision I had had at the church wall, the dancing illuminated letters with their inviting message that tallied with some of the things intimated in the tract. I had been promised much then, the voices from that strange world had greatly aroused my curiosity, and I often spent hours on end deeply absorbed in contemplation of the matter. In the process, the warnings contained in those inscriptions became more and more clear to me: ‘Not for everybody!’ and ‘For mad people only!’ So I had to be mad and quite remote from ‘everybody’ if those voices were to reach me, those worlds to communicate with me. My God, had I not long since been living at a sufficient remove from everybody, from the lives and minds of normal folk? Had I not been enough of an outsider, mad enough, for years? And yet, deep down inside me, I fully understood this summons, this invitation to go mad, to jettison all reason, inhibition and bourgeois respectability, and to surrender myself to the fluctuating, anarchic world of the soul, of the imagination."
"So war dies mit dem Steppenwolf beschaffen, und man kann sich vorstellen, daß Harry nicht gerade ein angenehmes und glückliches Leben hatte. Doch soll damit nicht gesagt sein, daß er in ganz besonderem Grade unglücklich gewesen sei (obwohl es ihm selber allerdings so erschien, wie denn jeder Mensch die ihm zufallenden Leiden für die größten hält). Man sollte das von keinem Menschen sagen. Auch wer keinen Wolf in sich hat, braucht darum nicht glücklich zu sein. Und auch das unglücklichste Leben hat seine Sonnenstunden und seine kleinen Glücksblumen zwischen dem Sand und Gestein. So war es denn auch bei dem Steppenwolf. Er war meistens sehr unglücklich, das ist nicht zu leugnen, und unglücklich konnte er auch andre machen, nämlich wenn er sie liebte und sie ihn. Denn alle, die ihn lieb gewannen, sahen immer nur die eine Seite in ihm. Manche liebten ihn als einen feinen, klugen und eigenartigen Menschen und waren dann entsetzt und enttäuscht, wenn sie plötzlich den Wolf in ihm entdecken mußten. Und das mußten sie, denn Harry wollte, wie jedes Wesen, als Ganzes geliebt werden und konnte darum gerade vor denen, an deren Liebe ihm viel gelegen war, den Wolf nicht verbergen und weglügen. Es gab aber auch solche, die gerade den Wolf in ihm liebten, gerade das Freie, Wilde, Unzähmbare, Gefährliche und Starke, und diesen wieder war es dann außerordentlich enttäuschend und jämmerlich, wenn plötzlich der wilde, böse Wolf auch noch ein Mensch war, auch noch Sehnsucht nach Güte und Zartheit in sich hatte, auch noch Mozart hören, Verse lesen und Menschheitsideale haben wollte. Gerade diese waren meistens besonders enttäuscht und böse, und so brachte der Steppenwolf seine eigene Doppeltheit und Zwiespältigkeit auch in alle fremden Schicksale hinein, die er berührte.","Such was the case with Steppenwolf, and one can imagine that Harry did not exactly have a comfortable and happy life. However, this is not to say that he was unhappy in a very special degree (although it certainly seemed to him that every human being considers the suffering he suffers to be the greatest). You shouldn't say that about anyone. Even if you don't have a wolf in you, you don't need to be happy. And even the unhappiest life has its hours of sunshine and its little flowers of happiness between the sand and rocks. That's how it was with Steppenwolf. Most of the time he was very unhappy, there's no denying that, and he could make others unhappy too, namely when he loved her and she him. Because everyone who fell in love with him only ever saw one side of him. Some loved him as a fine, clever and peculiar person and were then shocked and disappointed when they suddenly had to discover the wolf in him. And they had to, because Harry, like every other being, wanted to be loved as a whole and therefore couldn't hide the wolf and lie away from those whose love was important to him. But there were also those who loved the wolf in him, just what was free, wild, untameable, dangerous and strong, and for them it was extremely disappointing and miserable when suddenly the wild, bad wolf was also a human being, also had a longing for goodness and tenderness, also wanted to hear Mozart, read verses and have ideals of humanity. It was precisely these who were usually particularly disappointed and angry, and so the Steppenwolf brought his own duality and ambiguity into all the fates of others that he touched.","Thus it was then with the Steppenwolf, and one may well imagine that Harry did not have an exactly pleasant and happy life of it. This does not mean, however, that he was unhappy in any extraordinary degree (although it may have seemed so to himself all the same, inasmuch as every man takes the sufferings that fall to his share as the greatest). That cannot be said of any man. Even he who has no wolf in him, may be none the happier for that. And even the unhappiest life has its sunny moments and its little flowers of happiness between sand and stone. So it was, then, with the Steppenwolf too. It cannot be denied that he was generally very unhappy; and he could make others unhappy also, that is, when he loved them or they him. For all who got to love him, saw always only the one side in him. Many loved him as a refined and clever and interesting man, and were horrified and disappointed when they had come upon the wolf in him. And they had to because Harry wished, as every sentient being does, to be loved as a whole and therefore it was just with those whose love he most valued that he could least of all conceal and belie the wolf. There were those, however, who loved precisely the wolf in him, the free, the savage, the untamable, the dangerous and strong, and these found it peculiarly disappointing and deplorable when suddenly the wild and wicked wolf was also a man, and had hankerings after goodness and refinement, and wanted to hear Mozart, to read poetry and to cherish human ideals. Usually these were the most disappointed and angry of all; and so it was that the Steppenwolf brought his own dual and divided nature into the destinies of others besides himself whenever he came into contact with them.","This was the way of things for Steppenwolf, and one can imagine that Harry’s life was not exactly a pleasant and happy one. However, this doesn’t mean to say that he was unhappy to some quite unusual degree (even though this did seem to him to be the case, all human beings tending to consider their share of suffering to be the greatest). That ought never to be said of anyone. Even those without a trace of wolf in them are not necessarily happy. And even the unhappiest of lives has its hours of sunshine, small flowers of contentment that dot its sandy, stony ground. And so it was for Steppenwolf too. He was usually very unhappy , there is no denying that, and he was capable of making others unhappy too; the ones he loved, that is, and those who loved him, for all those who grew fond of him only ever saw the one side of the man. Some took a liking to him as a refined, intelligent and exceptional person, only to react with horror and disappointment on suddenly discovering the wolf in him. And this was inevitable because Harry, wishing his whole self to be loved, as everybody does, was for that very reason incapable of denying the wolf or concealing its existence from those whose affection meant a lot to him. There were, however, others who of all things loved the wolf in him, precisely the side of him that was free, wild, untameable, dangerous and strong. And they in turn were of course extraordinarily disappointed, indeed miserable, when the wild, wicked wolf suddenly turned out to be human too, still felt a strong desire to be kind and gentle, still wanted to listen to Mozart, read poetry and keep faith with the ideals of humanity. More than any others, these people were especially prone to react with anger and disappointment, and thus Steppenwolf transmitted to all the strangers whose lot it was to come into contact with him something of his own dual, divided nature."
"Diese Hermine, die ich heut zum zweiten Male sah, wußte alles von mir, es schien mir nicht möglich, je vor ihr ein Geheimnis zu haben. Es mochte sein, daß sie mein geistiges Leben vielleicht nicht ganz verstanden hätte; in meine Beziehungen zur Musik, zu Goethe, zu Novalis oder Baudelaire vermöchte sie mir möglicherweise nicht zu folgen – aber auch dies war sehr fraglich, wahrscheinlich würde auch dies ihr keine Mühe machen. Und wenn auch – was war denn von meinem »geistigen Leben« noch übrig? Lag das nicht alles in Scherben und hatte seinen Sinn verloren? Aber meine anderen, meine persönlichsten Probleme und Anliegen, die würde sie alle verstehen, daran zweifelte ich nicht. Bald würde ich mit ihr über den Steppenwolf, über den Traktat, über alles und alles reden, was bisher nur für mich allein existiert, worüber ich nie mit einem Menschen ein Wort gesprochen hatte. Ich konnte nicht widerstehen, gleich zu beginnen.","This Hermione, whom I saw for the second time today, knew everything about me, it didn't seem possible to me that I could ever keep a secret from her. It might be that she might not have fully understood my intellectual life; she might not be able to follow me into my relationships to music, to Goethe, to Novalis or Baudelaire – but that too was very questionable, probably this wouldn't bother her either. And if so, what was left of my ""spiritual life""? Wasn't it all in pieces and had lost its meaning? But my other, my most personal problems and concerns, they would all understand, I had no doubts about that. Soon I would be talking to her about Steppenwolf, about the tract, about anything and everything that until now only existed for me alone, about which I had never spoken a word to anyone. I couldn't resist starting right away.","Though I saw Hermine only for the second time that day, she knew everything about me and it seemed to me quite impossible that I could ever have a secret from her. Perhaps she might not understand everything of my spiritual life, might not perhaps follow me in my relation to music, to Goethe, to Novalis or Baudelaire. This too, however, was open to question. Probably it would give her as little trouble as the rest. And anyway, what was there left of my spiritual life? Hadn't all that gone to atoms and lost its meaning? As for the rest, my more personal problems and concerns, I had no doubt that she would understand them all. I should very soon be talking to her about the Steppenwolf and the treatise and all the rest of it, though till now it had existed for myself alone and never been mentioned to a single soul. Indeed, I could not resist the temptation of beginning forthwith.","The Hermione I was seeing for the second time today knew all there was to know about me. It seemed impossible to me that I could ever keep anything secret from her. It might be that she had not fully understood my intellectual life, would not perhaps be able to keep up with me where my interests in music, in Goethe, in Novalis or Baudelaire were concerned – but even this was doubtful; she would probably have no difficulty with these things either. And even if she couldn’t – what, I asked myself, remained of my ‘intellectual life’? Wasn’t it all in ruins, devoid of meaning? But as for my other, personal problems and interests, she would understand them all, of that I had no doubt. Soon I would talk to her about Steppenwolf, about the Tract, about each and every thing that until now had existed only for me, matters I had never spoken a word about to any human being. I could not resist making a start on this straight away."
"In solcher Stimmung also beschloß ich diesen leidlichen Dutzendtag bei einbrechender Dunkelheit. Ich beschloß ihn nicht auf die für einen etwas leidenden Mann normale und bekömmliche Weise, indem ich mich von dem bereitstehenden und mit einer Wärmflasche als Köder versehenen Bett einfangen ließ, sondern indem ich unbefriedigt und angeekelt von meinem bißchen Tagewerk voll Mißmut meine Schuhe anzog, in den Mantel schlüpfte und mich bei Finsternis und Nebel in die Stadt begab, um im Gasthaus zum Stahlhelm das zu trinken, was trinkende Männer nach einer alten Konvention »ein Gläschen Wein« nennen.","It was in such a mood that I ended this tolerable dozen day as darkness fell. I ended it not in the normal and wholesome way for a somewhat ailing man, by allowing myself to be caught by the ready bed baited with a hot-water bottle, but by putting on my shoes, dissatisfied and disgusted with my little day's work, in slipped on my coat and went into the city in the dark and fog to drink what drinking men, according to an old convention, call ""a little glass of wine"" at the Gasthaus zum Stahlhelm.","It was in such a mood then that I finished this not intolerable and very ordinary day as dusk set in. I did not end it in a manner becoming a rather ailing man and go to bed tempted by a hot water bottle. Instead I put on my shoes ill-humoredly, discontented and disgusted with the little work I had done, and went out into the dark and foggy streets to drink what men according to an old convention call ""a glass of wine,"" at the sign of the Steel Helmet.","It was in such a mood that, as darkness fell, I ended this middling, run-of-the-mill day. I didn’t succumb to the lure of my already-made bed with the hot-water bottle in it, as might be expected of a man who is slightly off-colour. Instead I irritably put on my shoes, slipped on my overcoat and – disgusted with my paltry day’s labour – made my way through darkness and fog into town to drink what drinking men traditionally call ‘a drop of wine’ in a pub called the Steel Helmet."
"Unterdessen hatte ich mich, einer Laune folgend, dem Trauerzug angeschlossen und trabte hinter den Leidtragenden her zum Friedhof mit, einem modernen zementenen Patentfriedhof mit Krematorium und allen Schikanen. Unser Toter wurde aber nicht verbrannt, sondern sein Sarg vor einem schlichten Erdloch abgeladen, und ich sah dem Pfarrer und den übrigen Aasgeiern, Angestellten einer Begräbnisanstalt, bei ihren Verrichtungen zu, welchen sie den Anschein einer hohen Feierlichkeit und Trauer zu geben suchten, so daß sie sich vor lauter Theater und Verlegenheit und Verlogenheit überanstrengten und ins Komische gerieten, sah, wie die schwarze Berufsuniform an ihnen niederwallte und wie sie sich Mühe gaben, die Trauergesellschaft in Stimmung zu bringen und zur Kniebeuge vor der Majestät des Todes zu zwingen. Es war vergebliche Mühe, niemand weinte, der Tote schien allen entbehrlich zu sein. Auch war niemand zu frommen Stimmungen zu überreden, und als der Pfarrer die Gesellschaft immer wieder als »liebe Mitchristen« anredete, sahen alle die schweigsamen Geschäftsgesichter dieser Kaufleute und Bäckermeister und ihrer Frauen in krampfhaftem Ernst vor sich nieder, verlegen und verlogen und von keinem andern Wunsch bewegt, als daß diese unbehagliche Veranstaltung bald ihr Ende finden möchte. Nun, sie ging zu Ende, die beiden vordersten unter den Mitchristen drückten dem Redner die Hand, rieben sich am nächsten Rasenbord den feuchten Lehm, in den sie ihren Toten gelegt hatten, von den Schuhen, die Gesichter wurden unverweilt wieder gewöhnlich und menschlich, und eines von ihnen schien mir plötzlich bekannt – es war, so schien mir, der Mann, der damals das Plakat getragen und mir das Büchlein in die Hand gedrückt hatte.","Meanwhile, on a whim, I had joined the funeral procession and trotted behind the mourners to the cemetery, a modern cement patent cemetery with a crematorium and all the harassment. Our dead man was not cremated, however, but his coffin was dumped in front of a plain burrow, and I watched the priest and the other vultures, employees of a funeral home, going about their business, which they tried to give the appearance of great solemnity and mourning, so that they strained and got comical from sheer theatrics and embarrassment and mendacity, saw the black professional uniform rolling down on them and struggled to get the mourners in the mood to bend their knees before the majesty of death. It was a futile effort, no one cried, everyone seemed to be able to dispense with the dead man. Nor could anyone be persuaded to be in a pious mood, and when the pastor kept addressing the company as ""dear fellow Christians,"" everyone looked down in convulsive seriousness on the silent business faces of these merchants and master bakers and their wives, embarrassed and mendacious and by no one else Wish moved that this uncomfortable event would soon come to an end. Well, it came to an end, the two foremost among the fellow Christians shook the speaker's hand, rubbed the damp clay on which they had laid their dead off their shoes on the next lawn border, their faces immediately became ordinary and human again, and one of them suddenly seemed familiar to me - it seemed to me to be the man who had carried the poster and put the booklet in my hand.","Meanwhile, obeying my fancy, I had fallen in at the rear of the funeral procession and jogged along behind the mourners to the cemetery, an up-to-date set-up all of concrete, complete with crematorium and what not. The deceased in question was not however to be cremated. His coffin was set down before a simple hole in the ground, and I saw the clergyman and the other vultures and functionaries of a burial establishment going through their performances, to which they endeavored to give all the appearance of great ceremony and sorrow and with such effect that they outdid themselves and from pure acting they got caught in their own lies and ended by being comic. I saw how their black professional robes fell in folds, and what pains they took to work up the company of mourners and to force them to bend the knee before the majesty of death. It was labor in vain. Nobody wept. The deceased did not appear to have been indispensable. Nor could anyone be talked into a pious frame of mind; and when the clergyman addressed the company repeatedly as ""dear fellow-Christians,"" all the silent faces of these shop people and master bakers and their wives were turned down in embarrassment and expressed nothing but the wish that this uncomfortable function might soon be over. When the end came, the two foremost of the fellow-Christians shook the clergyman's hand, scraped the moist clay in which the dead had been laid from their shoes at the next scraper and without hesitation their faces again showed their natural expression; and then it was that one of them seemed suddenly familiar. It was, so it seemed to me, the man who had carried the signboard and thrust the little book into my hands.","In the meantime I had, on a whim, joined the funeral procession, jogging along behind the mourners as far as the cemetery, an up-to-date concrete affair, complete with crematorium and all mod cons. However, our deceased one was not cremated. Instead, his coffin was unloaded in front of a plain hole in the ground and I watched the clergyman and the remaining vultures, employees of some undertaker, going about their business. Attempting to invest their activities with a semblance of solemnity and grief, they overdid things to the point where, through sheer theatricality, awkwardness and insincerity, they ended up being comic. Dressed from head to foot in flowing black robes, the uniform of their profession, they were doing their utmost to instil the right mood in the assembled mourners, hoping to force them to their knees before the majestic spectacle of death. But all their efforts were in vain; nobody wept; none of them seemed to miss the deceased at all. Nor could anyone be persuaded to adopt a solemnly religious air. Again and again the clergyman addressed the assembly as ‘dear brothers and sisters in Christ’, but all these silent shopkeepers, master bakers and their wives merely looked at the ground in front of them, forced expressions of seriousness on their tradespeople’s faces. They were awkward and insincere, wishing for nothing more than a rapid end to this uncomfortable ceremony. Well, it did come to an end and the two Christian brethren standing furthest forward, having shaken hands with the speaker, went to the edge of the nearest bit of lawn to rub the damp clay, in which their deceased had been laid, from their shoes. Without the slightest delay they resumed their normal, human appearance, the face of one of them suddenly striking me as familiar. It seemed to me to be the same man who had carried the placard that night and thrust the pamphlet into my hand."

""There's a smell of cleanliness and good order here, of comfort and respectability. It was that that pleased him. He looks as if he weren't used to that of late and missed it.""","My aunt, whose instinct for such things is sometimes remarkably sound, replied: ‘I know exactly why. Where we live there is a smell of cleanliness and order, of kindness and decency, and it appealed to him. By the look of him he’s not used to that sort of thing any more, and he’s missing it.’"
"Es war einmal einer namens Harry, genannt der Steppenwolf. Er ging auf zwei Beinen, trug Kleider und war ein Mensch, aber eigentlich war er doch eben ein Steppenwolf. Er hatte vieles von dem gelernt, was Menschen mit gutem Verstande lernen können, und war ein ziemlich kluger Mann. Was er aber nicht gelernt hatte, war dies: mit sich und seinem Leben zufrieden zu sein. Dies konnte er nicht, er war ein unzufriedener Mensch. Das kam wahrscheinlich daher, daß er im Grunde seines Herzens jederzeit wußte (oder zu wissen glaubte), daß er eigentlich gar kein Mensch, sondern ein Wolf aus der Steppe sei. Es mögen sich kluge Menschen darüber streiten, ob er nun wirklich ein Wolf war, ob er einmal, vielleicht schon vor seiner Geburt, aus einem Wolf in einen Menschen verzaubert worden war oder ob er als Mensch geboren, aber mit der Seele eines Steppenwolfes begabt und von ihr besessen war oder aber ob dieser Glaube, daß er eigentlich ein Wolf sei, bloß eine Einbildung oder Krankheit von ihm war. Zum Beispiel wäre es ja möglich, daß dieser Mensch etwa in seiner Kindheit wild und unbändig und unordentlich war, daß seine Erzieher versucht hatten, die Bestie in ihm totzukriegen, und ihm gerade dadurch die Einbildung und den Glauben schufen, daß er in der Tat eigentlich eine Bestie sei, nur mit einem dünnen Überzug von Erziehung und Menschentum darüber. Man könnte hierüber lang und unterhaltend sprechen und sogar Bücher darüber schreiben; dem Steppenwolf aber wäre damit nicht gedient, denn für ihn war es ganz einerlei, ob der Wolf in ihn hineingehext oder -geprügelt oder aber nur eine Einbildung seiner Seele sei. Was andre darüber denken mochten und auch was er selbst darüber denken mochte, das war für ihn nichts wert, das holte den Wolf doch nicht aus ihm heraus.","Once upon a time there was a man named Harry, called Steppenwolf. He walked on two legs, wore clothes and was a human being, but actually he was a Steppenwolf. He had learned much that men of good mind can learn, and was quite a clever man. But what he hadn't learned was this: to be satisfied with himself and his life. He couldn't, he was a dissatisfied man. That was probably because, deep down in his heart, he always knew (or thought he knew) that he wasn't actually a human being, but a wolf from the steppe. Wise people may argue as to whether he really was a wolf, whether he had once, perhaps before he was born, been transformed from a wolf into a human, or whether he was born a human but gifted with the soul of a steppe wolf and possessed by her, or whether this belief that he was actually a wolf was merely an illusion or illness on his part. It is possible, for example, that this person was wild and unruly and untidy in his childhood, that his educators had tried to get the beast dead in him and thereby created in him the conceit and the belief that he was in fact actually a beast with only a thin coating of upbringing and humanity over it. One could talk about this at length and amusingly, and even write books about it; But that wouldn't help the Steppenwolf, because for him it didn't matter at all whether the wolf was bewitched or beaten into him or whether it was just an imagination of his soul. What others might think about it, and what he might think about it himself, was worth nothing to him, it didn't get the wolf out of him.","There was once a man, Harry, called the Steppenwolf. He went on two legs, wore clothes and was a human being, but nevertheless he was in reality a wolf of the Steppes. He had learned a good deal of all that people of a good intelligence can, and was a fairly clever fellow. What he had not learned, however, was this: to find contentment in himself and his own life. The cause of this apparently was that at the bottom of his heart he knew all the time (or thought he knew) that he was in reality not a man, but a wolf of the Steppes. Clever men might argue the point whether he truly was a wolf, whether, that is, he had been changed, before birth perhaps, from a wolf into a human being, or had been given the soul of a wolf, though born as a human being; or whether, on the other hand, this belief that he was a wolf was no more than a fancy or a disease of his. It might, for example, be possible that in his childhood he was a little wild and disobedient and disorderly, and that those who brought him up had declared a war of extinction against the beast in him; and precisely this had given him the idea and the belief that he was in fact actually a beast with only a thin covering of the human. On this point one could speak at length and entertainingly, and indeed write a book about it. The Steppenwolf, however, would be none the better for it, since for him it was all one whether the wolf had been bewitched or beaten into him, or whether it was merely an idea of his own. What others chose to think about it or what he chose to think himself was no good to him at all. It left the wolf inside him just the same.","Once upon a time there was a man called Harry, otherwise known as Steppenwolf. He walked on two legs, wore clothes and was a human being, but in actual fact he was still a wolf of the steppes. He had learned a lot of the things sensible human beings are capable of learning, and he was a fairly clever man. One thing he had not learned, however, was to be satisfied with himself and his life. He was incapable of this; he was a dissatisfied human being. This was probably because in the depths of his heart he always knew (or thought he knew) that he wasn’t actually a human being at all, but a wolf of the steppes. Wise minds might argue the point as to whether he really was a wolf; whether he had once, even before his birth, been transformed by magic from a wolf into a human being; whether he had been born a human being but endowed with and possessed by the spirit of a lone wolf; or, alternatively, whether his belief that he was in fact a wolf was merely a delusion or a form of sickness on his part. One possibility, for instance, would be that he was wild, boisterous and disorderly in his youth. Those responsible for his upbringing had then tried to stifle the beast in him, but precisely by doing so had led him to imagine and believe that he really was in fact a beast, clothed in only a thin veneer of education and humanity. It would be possible to go on discussing this at length, entertainingly so; or even to write whole books on the subject. However, that would be of no help to Steppenwolf because to him it was a matter of complete indifference whether the wolf had been instilled in him by magic spells, by beatings, or whether it was merely a product of his imagination. Whatever other people might think about it, and even what he himself might think, was of no use to him at all. He certainly wasn’t going to get the wolf out of his system by speculation of that kind."
"Ich zeigte ihr die eine, schönere, die eben in unsrer Nähe stand und in ihrem hübschen Sammetröckchen, mit den kurzgeschnittenen kräftigen Blondhaaren und den vollen, fraulichen Armen entzückend aussah. Hermine bestand darauf, daß ich sofort hingehe und sie auffordere. Ich wehrte mich verzweifelt.","I showed her the one, more beautiful, who was standing near us and looked delightful in her pretty velvet skirt, with the short, strong blond hair and the full, womanly arms. Hermione insisted that I go and ask her immediately. I fought back desperately.","I pointed out one of the two, and the more attractive, who happened at the moment to be standing near us. She looked enchanting in her pretty velvet dress with her short luxuriant blonde hair and her rounded womanly arms. Hermine insisted that I should go up to her forthwith and ask her to dance. I shrank back in despair.","I pointed out the more beautiful one of the two to her, who happened to be standing close to us. With her short, strong blonde hair and her full, womanly arms she looked enchanting in her pretty little velvet skirt. Hermione insisted I should go immediately and ask her for a dance. I desperately tried to resist."
"»Er kommt«, sagte der andre. Und ich hörte, aus den leeren Räumen im Innern des Theaters her, eine Musik tönen, eine schöne und schreckliche Musik, jene Musik aus dem »Don Juan«, die das Auftreten des steinernen Gastes begleitet. Schauerlich hallten die eisigen Klänge durch das gespenstische Haus, aus dem Jenseits, von den Unsterblichen kommend.","""He's coming,"" said the other. And I heard music coming from the empty rooms inside the theater, beautiful and terrible music, the music from Don Juan that accompanies the entrance of the stone guest. The icy sounds echoed eerily through the spooky house, coming from the beyond, from the immortals.","""Coming,"" said the other. And I heard from the empty spaces within the theater the sound of music, a beautiful and awful music, that music from Don Giovanni that heralds the approach of the guest of stone. With an awful and an iron clang it rang through the ghostly house, coming from the other world, from the immortals.","‘It is coming,’ the other one said. And from the empty chambers in the interior of the theatre I heard some beautiful, terrible music ring out, the passage from Don Giovanni that accompanies the appearance of the Stone Guest. Arriving from the beyond, the world of the Immortals, the icy sounds of it echoed spine-chillingly throughout the haunted building."

"Der Strom hatte mich an Land gespült, wieder stand ich am schweigenden Logengang des Theaters. Was nun? Ich griff nach den Figürchen in meiner Tasche, aber schon war dieser Antrieb wieder verblaßt. Unerschöpflich umgab mich diese Welt der Türen, der Inschriften, der magischen Spiegel. Willenlos las ich die nächste Aufschrift und schauderte:","The current had swept me ashore, and once again I was standing in the silent aisle of the theater. What now? I reached for the figurines in my pocket, but that drive had already faded. This world of doors, inscriptions, magic mirrors surrounded me inexhaustibly. Without will I read the next inscription and shuddered:","The stream had washed me ashore. Once again I stood in the silent theater passage. What now? I felt for the little figures in my pocket—but already this impulse died away. Around me was the inexhaustible world of doors, notices and magic mirrors. Listlessly I read the first words that caught my eye, and shuddered.","The current had washed me up on dry land. I was again standing in the silent corridor behind the theatre’s boxes. What now? I felt for the little chessmen in my pocket, but the urge to rearrange them had already lost its force. All around me I was confronted by this inexhaustible world of doors, inscriptions and magic mirrors. Mechanically my eyes lit on the next notice and I shuddered to see that it read:"
"»Darauf, daß man musiziert, Herr Haller, daß man so gut und so viel und so intensiv wie möglich musiziert! Das ist es, Monsieur. Wenn ich sämtliche Werke von Bach und Haydn im Kopf habe und die gescheitesten Sachen darüber sagen kann, so ist damit noch keinem Menschen gedient. Wenn ich aber mein Blasrohr nehme und einen zügigen Shimmy spiele, so mag der Shimmy gut sein oder schlecht, er wird doch den Leuten Freude machen, er fährt ihnen in die Beine und ins Blut. Darauf allein kommt es an. Sehen Sie einmal in einem Ballsaal die Gesichter an in dem Augenblick, wo nach einer längeren Pause die Musik wieder losgeht – wie da die Augen blitzen, die Beine zucken, die Gesichter zu lachen anfangen! Das ist es, wofür man musiziert.«","“On making music, Herr Haller, on making music as well, as much, and as intensively as possible! That's it, monsieur. If I have all the works of Bach and Haydn in my head and can say the smartest things about them, that doesn't help anyone. But if I take my blowgun and do a quick shimmy, whether the shimmy is good or bad, it'll make people happy, it'll get in their legs and in their blood. That's all that matters. Look at the faces in a ballroom at the moment when the music starts up again after a long break – how the eyes sparkle, the legs twitch, the faces start to laugh! That is what one makes music for.«","""On making music, Herr Haller, on making music as well and as much as possible and with all the intensity of which one is capable. That is the point, Monsieur. Though I carried the complete works of Bach and Haydn in my head and could say the cleverest things about them, not a soul would be the better for it. But when I take hold of my mouthpiece and play a lively shimmy, whether the shimmy be good or bad, it will give people pleasure. It gets into their legs and into their blood. That's the point and that alone. Look at the faces in a dance hall at the moment when the music strikes up after a longish pause, how eyes sparkle, legs twitch and faces begin to laugh. That is why one makes music.""","‘It’s a matter of making music, Herr Haller, making music as well, as much and as intensively as possible! That’s the point, Monsieur. I can have the complete works of Bach and Haydn in my head and be able to say extremely clever things about them, but that’s of no use to anybody. However, when I pick up my horn and play a brisk shimmy, regardless of whether it’s a good or a bad dance tune, it’s going to bring joy to people by putting a spring in their step and getting into their bloodstream. That’s the only thing that matters. Next time you are in a dance hall, just take a look at people’s faces at the moment when the music starts up again after a longish break. You’ll see their eyes beginning to sparkle, their legs starting to twitch, and their faces beaming brightly! That’s the point of making music.’"
"»Leicht zu begreifen, Harry. Und dann? Hast du ihnen das Bild an die Köpfe gehauen?«","'Easy to understand, Harry. And then? Did you smack that picture on their heads?”","""It is very easy to see. And next? Did you throw the picture at them?""","‘Of course, Harry, it’s not difficult. And then what? Did you fling the picture at them, hit them on the head with it?’"
"Ich war damit zufrieden und fragte, wo ich sie wiedersehen könne. Wo sie denn wohne? Das sagte sie mir nicht. Ich solle nur ein wenig suchen, dann fände ich sie schon.",I was happy with that and asked where I could see her again. Where does she live? She didn't tell me that. I should just search a little and then I would find her.,I was satisfied with that and asked where I could find her again? Where did she live? She would not tell me. I should find her in one place or another if I looked.,"Happy with this arrangement, I asked her where we could meet each other again. Where did she live? She didn’t tell me. I only needed to search a little, she said, and I would find her all right."
"Den versäumten Schlaf dieser Nacht holte ich am Tage nach. Ich fuhr am Morgen ins Bad, fuhr nach Hause, todmüde, machte mein Schlafzimmer dunkel, fand beim Entkleiden mein Gedicht in der Tasche, vergaß es wieder, legte mich sogleich nieder, vergaß Maria, Hermine und den Maskenball und schlief den ganzen Tag hindurch. Als ich am Abend aufstand, fiel mir erst während des Rasierens wieder ein, daß in einer Stunde schon der Maskenball beginne und ich ein Frackhemd heraussuchen müsse. In guter Laune machte ich mich fertig und ging aus, um zunächst einmal zu essen.","I made up for the sleep I missed that night during the day. In the morning I went to the bathroom, went home, dead tired, made my bedroom dark, while undressing I found my poem in my pocket, forgot it again, lay down immediately, forgot Maria, Hermione and the masked ball and slept the whole day through. When I got up in the evening, it only occurred to me while I was shaving that the masked ball was going to start in an hour and I had to find a dress shirt. In good spirits, I got ready and went out to eat first.",I made up by day for the sleep I had lost at night. After a bath I went home dead tired. I darkened my bedroom and as I undressed I came on the verses in my pocket; but I forgot them again and lay down forthwith. I forgot Maria and Hermine and the Masked Ball and slept the clock round. It was not till I had got up in the evening and was shaving that I remembered that the Ball began in an hour and that I had to find a dress shirt. I got myself ready in very good humor and went out thereafter to have dinner.,"The next day I made up for the sleep I had lost that night. In the morning I went to the public baths, before going home totally exhausted. There, having shut out the daylight from my bedroom, I discovered in my pocket, as I was undressing, my poem. Forgetting it again, I immediately lay down and slept right through the day. Maria, Hermione and the masked ball were forgotten too. Waking up in the evening, it was only when having a shave that I realized the ball was already due to start in an hour and I needed to look among my things for a dress shirt. I finished dressing in good spirits and went out for a meal before things began."

"Nach einer Stunde ging sie fort, mit der Versicherung, das nächste Mal werde es schon besser gehen. Ich dachte darüber anders und war sehr enttäuscht über meine Dummheit und Schwerfälligkeit, ich hatte, wie mir schien, in dieser Stunde überhaupt nichts gelernt und glaubte nicht daran, daß es ein andermal besser gehen werde. Nein, zum Tanzen mußte man Fähigkeiten mitbringen, die mir vollkommen fehlten: Fröhlichkeit, Unschuld, Leichtsinn, Schwung. Nun, ich hatte es mir ja längst gedacht.","After an hour she left, with the assurance that it would be better next time. I thought differently about it and was very disappointed at my stupidity and sluggishness. It seemed to me that I hadn't learned anything in that lesson and didn't believe that things would be any better another time. No, to dance you had to have skills that I completely lacked: cheerfulness, innocence, recklessness, verve. Well, I had thought so for a long time.","In an hour she was gone, assuring me that it would go better next time. I had my own thoughts about that, and I was sorely disappointed over my stupidity and clumsiness. It did not seem to me that I had learned anything whatever and I did not believe that it would go better next time. No, one had to bring certain qualities to dancing that I was entirely without, gaiety, innocence, frivolity, elasticity. Well, I had always thought so.","She left after an hour, telling me not to worry, I was sure to be better at it next time. This was not my view. I was very disappointed with my own stupidity and clumsiness. It seemed to me that I hadn’t learned a thing during the last hour and I didn’t believe a second attempt would be any better. No, dancing called for the sort of qualities I totally lacked: gaiety, innocence, nonchalance, verve. Ah well, wasn’t that what I’d known all along?"

"Wir standen und blickten einander an, die letzten im Saal, die letzten im Haus. Irgendwo unten hörte ich eine Tür schlagen, ein Glas zerschellen, ein Gekicher sich verlieren, vermischt mit dem bösen, eiligen Lärm ankurbelnder Automobile. Irgendwo, in einer unbestimmbaren Ferne und Höhe, hörte ich ein Gelächter klingen, ein ungemein helles und frohes, dennoch schauerliches und fremdes Gelächter, ein Lachen wie aus Kristall und Eis, hell und strahlend, aber kalt und unerbittlich. Woher doch klang dies wunderliche Lachen mir bekannt? Ich fand es nicht. Wir beide standen und blickten einander an. Einen Augenblick lang wurde ich wach und nüchtern, fühlte ungeheure Müdigkeit mich von hinten überfallen, fühlte die durchschwitzten Kleider widerlich feucht und lau um mich hängen, sah meine Hände rot und dickgeädert aus zerdrückten und verschwitzten Manschetten hervorkommen. Aber sofort war das wieder vorbei, ein Blick Herminens löschte es aus. Vor ihrem Blick, aus dem meine eigene Seele mich anzuschauen schien, sank alle Wirklichkeit zusammen, auch die Wirklichkeit meines sinnlichen Verlangens nach ihr. Verzaubert blickten wir einander an, blickte meine arme kleine Seele mich an.","We stood and looked at each other, the last ones in the hall, the last ones in the house. Somewhere below I heard a door slam, a glass shatter, a giggle fading away mingled with the evil, rushing noise of motoring automobiles. Somewhere, in an indefinable distance and height, I heard laughter ringing out, an immensely bright and happy, yet horrible and strange laughter, a laughter as if made of crystal and ice, bright and radiant, but cold and implacable. How did this strange laughter sound familiar to me? I didn't find it. We both stood and looked at each other. For a moment I woke up and sober, felt immense tiredness attacking me from behind, felt the sweat-soaked clothes hanging disgustingly damp and tepid around me, saw my hands red and veiny protruding from bruised and sweaty cuffs. But that was over immediately, a look from Hermione erased it. Before her gaze, from which my own soul seemed to be looking at me, all reality collapsed, including the reality of my sensual desire for her. Enchanted we looked at each other, my poor little soul looked at me.","We stood looking at one another, the last in the hall, the last in the whole building. Somewhere below I heard a door bang, a glass break, a titter of laughter die away, mixed with the angry hurried noise of motorcars starting up. And somewhere, at an indeterminable distance and height, I heard a laugh ring out, an extraordinarily clear and merry peal of laughter. Yet it was eerie and strange. It was a laugh, made of crystal and ice, bright and radiant, but cold and inexorable. Where had I heard this laugh before? I could not tell. We stood and looked at one another. For a moment I came to my sober self. I felt a fearful weariness descend upon me. I felt with repugnance how moist and limp my clothing hung around me. I saw my hands emerging red and with swollen veins from my crumpled and wilted cuffs. But all at once the mood passed, banished by a look from Hermine. At this look that seemed to come from my own soul all reality fell away, even the reality of my sensuous love of her. Bewitched we looked at one another, while my poor little soul looked at me.","We stood looking at one another, the last people in the room, the last in the whole building. Somewhere down below I heard a door bang, a glass being dashed to pieces, the dying sound of people giggling, all intermingled with the harsh, urgent noise of cars being cranked up. Somewhere else, at an indeterminable distance and altitude, I heard laughter ring out, an extraordinarily bright and cheerful kind of laughter that was nevertheless eerie and alien too. As if made of crystal and ice, it was clear and radiant, but cold and inexorable. How come this strange laughter sounded so familiar to me? I couldn’t put my finger on it. The two of us stood looking at one another. Momentarily I regained consciousness, sobering up. Overcome by a sudden attack of great weariness from the rear, I could feel the sweat-drenched clothes clinging to my body, disgustingly damp and tepid, and could see my red hands, covered in swollen veins, poking out from my crumpled, sweaty cuffs. But this awareness was gone again in a flash, nullified by one look from Hermione. Before her gaze, which seemed like the mirror of my own soul, all reality disintegrated, even the reality of my sensual desire for her. We were looking at one another spellbound; my poor little soul was looking at me spellbound."
"»Ich werde«, sagte ich halb willenlos. »Was wird dein letzter Befehl für mich sein?« Ich ahnte ihn aber schon, Gott weiß warum.","""I will,"" I said, half involuntarily. ""What will be your last order for me?"" I guessed it, God knows why.","""I will,"" I said, half giving in. ""What will your last command be?"" I guessed it already—God knows why.","‘I shall,’ I said, half surrendering to her will. ‘What will you order me to do finally?’ I asked, although, God knows why, I already sensed what she had in mind."
"Man stelle sich einen Garten vor, mit hunderterlei Bäumen, mit tausenderlei Blumen, hunderterlei Obst, hunderterlei Kräutern. Wenn nun der Gärtner dieses Gartens keine andre botanische Unterscheidung kennt als »eßbar« und »Unkraut«, dann wird er mit neun Zehnteln seines Gartens nichts anzufangen wissen, er wird die zauberhaftesten Blumen ausreißen, die edelsten Bäume abhauen oder wird sie doch hassen und scheel ansehen. So macht es der Steppenwolf mit den tausend Blumen seiner Seele. Was nicht in die Rubriken »Mensch« oder »Wolf« paßt, das sieht er gar nicht. Und was zählt er nicht alles zum »Menschen«! Alles Feige, alles Affenhafte, alles Dumme und Kleinliche, wenn es nur nicht gerade wölfisch ist, zählt er zum »Menschen«, ebenso wie er alles Starke und Edle, nur weil es ihm noch nicht gelang, seiner Herr zu werden, dem Wölfischen zuschreibt.","Imagine a garden with hundreds of trees, thousands of flowers, hundreds of fruits, hundreds of herbs. If the gardener of this garden knows no other botanical distinction than ""edible"" and ""weeds,"" then he will not know what to do with nine-tenths of his garden, he will uproot the most magical flowers, cut down the noblest trees, or else he will hate them and hate them look at. This is how the Steppenwolf does it with the thousand flowers of his soul. He doesn't see anything that doesn't fit into the categories ""human"" or ""wolf"". And what does he not count as a ""man""! He counts everything cowardly, everything monkey-like, everything stupid and petty, as long as it is not exactly wolfish, as ""man"", just as he ascribes everything strong and noble to the wolfish just because he has not yet succeeded in mastering it .","Man designs for himself a garden with a hundred kinds of trees, a thousand kinds of flowers, a hundred kinds of fruit and vegetables. Suppose, then, that the gardener of this garden knew no other distinction than between edible and inedible, nine-tenths of this garden would be useless to him. He would pull up the most enchanting flowers and hew down the noblest trees and even regard them with a loathing and envious eye. This is what the Steppenwolf does with the thousand flowers of his soul. What does not stand classified as either man or wolf he does not see at all. And consider all that he imputes to ""man""! All that is cowardly and apish, stupid and mean—while to the wolf, only because he has not succeeded in making himself its master, is set down all that is strong and noble.","Just imagine a garden with hundreds of different trees, thousands of different flowers, hundreds of different fruits and herbs. Now, if the only botanical distinction the gardener knows is that between edible things and weeds, he will not know what to do with nine tenths of his garden. He will uproot the most enchanting flowers, fell the finest trees, or at any rate detest and frown upon them. This is just what Steppenwolf is doing with the thousand blooms in his soul. He is totally ignoring anything that doesn’t come under the heading of ‘human being’ or ‘wolf’. And there is no end to the things he counts as ‘human’! All things cowardly, vain, stupid and mean are classed as ‘human’ if only because they are not exactly wolf-like, just as all strong and noble qualities are attributed to the ‘wolf’ simply because Harry hasn’t yet managed to master them."
