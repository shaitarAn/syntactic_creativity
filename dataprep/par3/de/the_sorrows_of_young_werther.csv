"›Jammervoll! Wohl das bin ich, und nicht gering die Ursache meines Wehs. – Carmor, du verlorst keinen Sohn, verlorst keine blühende Tochter; Colgar, der Tapfere, lebt, und Annira, die schönste der Mädchen. Die Zweige deines Hauses blühen, o Carmor; aber Armin ist der Letzte seines Stammes. Finster ist dein Bett, o Daura! dumpf ist dein Schlaf in dem Grabe – Wann erwachst du mit deinen Gesängen, mit deiner melodischen Stimme? Auf, ihr Winde des Herbstes! auf, stürmt über die finstere Heide! Waldströme, braust! Heult, Stürme, im Gipfel der Eichen! Wandle durch gebrochene Wolken, o Mond, zeige wechselnd dein bleiches Gesicht! Erinnre mich der schrecklichen Nacht, da meine Kinder umkamen, da Arindal, der Mächtige, fiel, Daura, die Liebe, verging.","'Pathetic! Well that is what I am, and not a little the cause of my woe. – Carmor, you lost no son, lost no blooming daughter; Colgar the brave lives, and Annira, the fairest of girls. The branches of thy house are blossoming, O Carmor; but Armin is the last of his tribe. Your bed is dark, O Daura! dull is your sleep in the grave - when will you wake up with your songs, with your melodious voice? Up, ye autumn winds! up, storm over the dark heath! Forest streams, roar! Howl, storms, in the summit of the oaks! Walk through broken clouds, O moon, alternately show your pale face! Remind me the dreadful night when my children perished, when Arindal the mighty fell, Daura the love perished.","“‘Wretched? That I am. And the cause of my grief is not negligible. Carmor, thou hast not lost a son; thou hast not been deprived of a daughter. Colgar the brave lives, and Annira, fairest of maidens. The branches of thy house blossom, Carmor, but Armin is the last of his race. Dark is thy bier, O Daura, stifling thy sleep in the grave. When shalt thou awaken with thy songs, with thy melodious voice? Rise, winds of autumn; rise and storm across the bleak heath! Forest streams, roar! Wail, thou tempests in the crowns of the pines! Move through the broken clouds, O moon; show and hide thy pale face alternately! Remind me of the dread night when my children perished, when mighty Arindal was slain, and beloved Daura died.","""Sad I am! nor small is my cause of woe!   Carmor, thou hast lost no son; thou hast lost no daughter of beauty.   Colgar the valiant lives, and Annira, fairest maid.   The boughs of thy house ascend, O Carmor! but Armin is the last of his race.   Dark is thy bed, O Daura! deep thy sleep in the tomb!   When shalt thou wake with thy songs? with all thy voice of music? ""Arise, winds of autumn, arise: blow along the heath.   Streams of the mountains, roar; roar, tempests in the groves of my oaks!   Walk through broken clouds, O moon! show thy pale face at intervals; bring to my mind the night when all my children fell, when Arindal the mighty fell -- when Daura the lovely failed.  "
"Da trat Minona hervor in ihrer Schönheit, mit niedergeschlagenem Blick und tränenvollem Auge, schwer floß ihr Haar im unsteten Winde, der von dem Hügel herstieß. – Düster ward's in der Seele der Helden, als sie die liebliche Stimme erhob; denn oft hatten sie das Grab Salgars gesehen, oft die finstere Wohnung der weißen Colma. Colma, verlassen auf dem Hügel, mit der harmonischen Stimme; Salgar versprach zu kommen; aber ringsum zog sich die Nacht. Höret Colmas Stimme, da sie auf dem Hügel allein saß.","Then Minona stood out in her beauty, with downcast eyes and tearful eyes, her hair flowing heavily in the unsteady wind that blew from the hill. - It grew dark in the soul of the heroes when she raised her lovely voice; for they had often seen Salgar's grave, often the dark dwelling of the white Colma. Colma, left on the hill, with the harmonious voice; Salgar promised to come; but all around it was night. Hear Colma's voice as she sat alone on the hill.","“Minona, in all her beauty, stepped forward, eyes downcast and filled with tears, hair flowing heavy in the inconstant wind blowing from the hill. She raised her beloved voice, and the souls of the heroes were bleak, for they had oft seen Salgar’s grave and the dark abode of white Colma—Colma, abandoned on the hill, Colma with her melodious voice. Salgar promised to come, but all around her night was falling. Hear Colma ’s voice, as she sits on the hill alone!","""Minona came forth in her beauty, with downcast look and tearful eye.   Her hair was flying slowly with the blast that rushed unfrequent from the hill.   The souls of the heroes were sad when she raised the tuneful voice.   Oft had they seen the grave of Salgar, the dark dwelling of white-bosomed Colma.   Colma left alone on the hill with all her voice of song!   Salgar promised to come! but the night descended around.   Hear the voice of Colma, when she sat alone on the hill!"
"Noch ein sonderbarer Umstand kam dazu. Werther hatte, wie wir aus seinen Briefen wissen, nie ein Geheimnis daraus gemacht, daß er sich diese Welt zu verlassen sehnte. Albert hatte ihn oft bestritten, auch war zwischen Lotten und ihrem Mann manchmal die Rede davon gewesen. Dieser, wie er einen entschiedenen Widerwillen gegen die Tat empfand, hatte auch gar oft mit einer Art von Empfindlichkeit, die sonst ganz außer seinem Charakter lag, zu erkennen gegeben, daß er an dem Ernst eines solchen Vorsatzes sehr zu zweifeln Ursach' finde, er hatte sich sogar darüber einigen Scherz erlaubt und seinen Unglauben Lotten mitgeteilt. Dies beruhigte sie zwar von einer Seite, wenn ihre Gedanken ihr das traurige Bild vorführten, von der andern aber fühlte sie sich auch dadurch gehindert, ihrem Manne die Besorgnisse mitzuteilen, die sie in dem Augenblicke quälten.","There was another strange circumstance. As we know from his letters, Werther never made a secret of his longing to leave this world. Albert had often denied it, and Lotten and her husband had sometimes talked about it. The latter, who felt a decided repugnance to the deed, had often made it known, with a kind of sensitivity which otherwise lay entirely beyond his character, that he found reason to doubt the seriousness of such a resolution, he even joked about it and told Lotte of his disbelief. On the one hand this calmed her down when her thoughts brought the sad picture before her, but on the other hand she felt prevented from communicating to her husband the worries that were tormenting her at the moment.","Another strange circumstance must be mentioned here. As we know from his letters, Werther had never made any secret of his longing to leave this world. Albert had argued the point with him often and had even discussed it with Lotte. Since such behavior was so distasteful to him, he had declared several times, with an irritability that was quite foreign to his character, that he doubted the seriousness of Werther’s inclination. One day he had even gone so far as to joke about it and had mentioned his skepticism to Lotte. On the one hand, this helped to calm her whenever she dwelled on the unhappy prospect; on the other hand, she was reluctant for the same reason to share with her husband the anxieties that were tormenting her now.","But we must not forget one remarkable circumstance.   We may observe from the character of Werther's correspondence, that he had never affected to conceal his anxious desire to quit this world.   He had often discussed the subject with Albert; and, between the latter and Charlotte, it had not unfrequently formed a topic of conversation.   Albert was so opposed to the very idea of such an action, that, with a degree of irritation unusual in him, he had more than once given Werther to understand that he doubted the seriousness of his threats, and not only turned them into ridicule, but caused Charlotte to share his feelings of incredulity.   Her heart was thus tranquillised when she felt disposed to view the melancholy subject in a serious point of view, though she never communicated to her husband the apprehensions she sometimes experienced."
"Ja wohl bin ich nur ein Wandrer, ein Waller auf der Erde! Seid ihr denn mehr?","Yes, I am only a wanderer, a waller on earth! are you more?","Yes, I am a wanderer on this earth—a pilgrim. Are you anything more than that?","Once more I am a wanderer, a pilgrim, through the world.   But what else are you!"
"Gestern sind wir hier angelangt. Der Gesandte ist unpaß und wird sich also einige Tage einhalten. Wenn er nur nicht so unhold wäre, wär' alles gut. Ich merke, ich merke, das Schicksal hat mir harte Prüfungen zugedacht. Doch gutes Muts! Ein leichter Sinn trägt alles! Ein leichter Sinn? Das macht mich zu lachen, wie das Wort in meine Feder kommt. O ein bißchen leichteres Blut würde mich zum Glücklichsten unter der Sonne machen. Was! da, wo andere mit ihrem bißchen Kraft und Talent vor mir in behaglicher Selbstgefälligkeit herumschwadronieren, verzweifle ich an meiner Kraft, an meinen Gaben? Guter Gott, der du mir das alles schenktest, warum hieltest du nicht die Hälfte zurück und gabst mir Selbstvertrauen und Genügsamkeit?","We got here yesterday. The envoy is impertinent and will therefore hold off for a few days. If only he weren't so rude, everything would be fine. I see, I see, fate has given me tough trials. But good cheer! A light mind carries everything! An easy sense? This makes me laugh as the word comes into my pen. Oh, a little lighter blood would make me the happiest thing under the sun. What! there, where others with their little strength and talent babble about in comfortable self-satisfaction, do I despair of my strength, of my gifts? Good God, who gave me all this, why didn't you hold back half and give me confidence and contentment?","We arrived here yesterday. The ambassador is indisposed and will not be going out for a few days. If only he were not so unpleasant, things would be a great deal easier. But fate has many trials in store for me— I know it, I know it. However, let us not lose courage, for a light heart can bear all things. A light heart? I have to laugh. How could I write such words? Ah yes, a little lighter blood could make me the happiest man on earth! Come, come, Werther! How can you doubt your strength, your gifts, when others complacently parade their puny strength and talents? Dear God, who hath bestowed all this upon me, why didst Thou not withhold a half of it and give me instead faith in myself and a modest capacity for contentment?","We arrived here yesterday.   The ambassador is indisposed, and will not go out for some days.   If he were less peevish and morose, all would be well.   I see but too plainly that Heaven has destined me to severe trials; but courage! a light heart may bear anything. A light heart!   I smile to find such a word proceeding from my pen. A little more lightheartedness would render me the happiest being under the sun.   But must I despair of my talents and faculties, whilst others of far inferior abilities parade before me with the utmost self-satisfaction?   Gracious Providence, to whom I owe all my powers , why didst thou not withhold some of those blessings I possess, and substitute in their place a feeling of self-confidence and contentment?"
"Sie sieht nicht, sie fühlt nicht, daß sie ein Gift bereitet, das mich und sie zugrunde richten wird; und ich mit voller Wollust schlürfe den Becher aus, den sie mir zu meinem Verderben reicht. Was soll der gütige Blick, mit dem sie mich oft – oft? – nein, nicht oft, aber doch manchmal ansieht, die Gefälligkeit, womit sie einen unwillkürlichen Ausdruck[86] meines Gefühls aufnimmt, das Mitleiden mit meiner Duldung, das sich auf ihrer Stirne zeichnet?","She does not see, she does not feel that she is preparing a poison that will destroy me and her; and I voluptuously slurp the cup she hands me to my undoing. What's with the kind look she gives me often—often? - no, not often, but sometimes looks, the complacency with which she accepts an involuntary expression of my feeling, the pity for my tolerance that is marked on her forehead?","She doesn’t see, she doesn’t feel, that she is preparing a poison that will destroy her and me, and with voluptuous delight I drink the cup she hands me to the last dregs, and to my ruination. What is the meaning of that kindly look that she so often—often?…no, not often, but sometimes gives me, the graciousness with which she sometimes accepts a chance expression of my feelings for her, the compassion for what I am enduring, that is written on her brow?","She does not feel, she does not know, that she is preparing a poison which will destroy us both; and I drink deeply of the draught which is to prove my destruction.   What mean those looks of kindness with which she often -- often? no, not often, but sometimes, regards me, that complacency with which she hears the involuntary sentiments which frequently escape me, and the tender pity for my sufferings which appears in her countenance?"
"Montags früh, den einundzwanzigsten Dezember, schrieb er folgenden Brief an Lotten, den man nach seinem Tode versiegelt auf seinem Schreibtische gefunden und ihr überbracht hat, und den ich absatzweise hier einrücken will, so wie aus den Umständen erhellet, daß er ihn geschrieben habe.","On Monday morning, December 21st, he wrote the following letter to Lotten, which was found sealed on his desk after his death and brought to her, and which I will insert here in paragraphs, as is evident from the circumstances that he wrote it.","Early on Monday morning, the twenty-first of December, Werther wrote the following letter to Lotte. It was found after his death, lying on his desk, sealed, and was brought to her. I have decided to insert it here, since it throws light on the conditions under which it was written.","On Monday morning, the 21st of December, he wrote to Charlotte the following letter, which was found, sealed, on his bureau after his death, and was given to her.   I shall insert it in fragments; as it appears, from several circumstances, to have been written in that manner."
"»Ihre Gegenwart, ihr Schicksal, ihre Teilnehmung an dem meinigen preßt noch die letzten Tränen aus meinem versengten Gehirne.","'Her presence, her fate, her participation in mine still squeezes the last tears from my scorched brain.","“Her presence, her fate, her participation in my destiny force the last tears from my parched brain.","""Her presence, her fate, her sympathy for me, have power still to extract tears from my withered brain."
"Wie mich die Gestalt verfolgt! Wachend und träumend füllt sie meine ganze Seele! Hier, wenn ich die Augen schließe, hier in meiner Stirne, wo die innere Sehkraft sich vereinigt, stehen ihre schwarzen Augen. Hier! ich kann dir es nicht ausdrücken. Mache ich meine Augen zu, so sind sie da; wie ein Meer, wie ein Abgrund ruhen sie vor mir, in mir, füllen die Sinne meiner Stirn.","How the figure follows me! Waking and dreaming she fills my whole soul! Here, when I close my eyes, here in my forehead, where the inner vision unites, are her black eyes. Here! i can't express it to you If I close my eyes, they are there; like a sea, like an abyss they rest before me, in me, fill the senses of my forehead.","How the sight of her haunts me! Awake and dreaming, she fills my whole being. Here, when I close my eyes, here, behind my forehead, where we assemble our insight, I see her dark eyes. Here! I cannot express it adequately. I close my eyes and there they are…hers—like an abyss in front of me, inside me. They fill my whole mind.","How her image haunts me!   Waking or asleep, she fills my entire soul!   Soon as I close my eyes, here, in my brain, where all the nerves of vision are concentrated, her dark eyes are imprinted. Here -- I do not know how to describe it; but, if I shut my eyes, hers are immediately before me: dark as an abyss they open upon me, and absorb my senses."

"Laut war die Trauer der Helden, am lautesten Armins berstender Seufzer. Ihn erinnerte es an den Tod seines Sohnes, er fiel in den Tagen der Jugend. Carmor saß nah bei dem Helden, der Fürst des hallenden Galmal. ›Warum schluchzet der Seufzer Armins?‹ sprach er, ›was ist hier zu weinen? Klingt nicht Lied und Gesang, die Seele zu schmelzen und zu ergetzen? sie sind wie sanfter Nebel, der steigend vom See aufs Tal sprüht, und die blühenden Blumen füllet das Naß; aber die Sonne kommt wieder in ihrer Kraft, und der Nebel ist gegangen. Warum bist du so jammervoll, Armin, Herrscher des seeumflossenen Gorma?‹","Loud was the grief of the heroes, loudest was Armin's bursting sigh. It reminded him of his son's death, he fell in the days of youth. Carmor sat close to the hero, the prince of echoing Galmal. 'Why does Armin's sigh sob?' he said, 'what is there to weep about? Doesn't song and song sound like melting and delighting the soul? they are like gentle mist that sprays rising from the lake onto the valley, and the blooming flowers fill the wet; but the sun is coming back in its power, and the fog is gone. Why are you so pitiful, Armin, ruler of Lake Gorma?'","“Loud was the grief of the heroes; loudest of all, though, was Armin’s heartbreaking sigh. For he was reminded of the death of his son who fell in the days of his youth. Carmor, chieftain of the echoing halls of Galmal, was sitting nearby. ‘Why does Armin’s sigh choke him?’ he asked. ‘What causes him so much grief? Song and voice should melt the heart and delight it. They are the gentle mist that rises from the lake and spreads into the valleys, and the blossoming trees are dampened by it. The sun, though, rises again in all its glory, and the mists are dispelled. Why art thou so wretched, Armin, chieftain of the sea-girt isle of Gorma?’","""The grief of all arose, but most the bursting sigh of Armin.   He remembers the death of his son, who fell in the days of his youth. Carmor was near the hero, the chief of the echoing Galmal.   Why burst the sigh of Armin? he said.   Is there a cause to mourn?   The song comes with its music to melt and please the soul.   It is like soft mist that, rising from a lake, pours on the silent vale; the green flowers are filled with dew, but the sun returns in his strength, and the mist is gone.   Why art thou sad, O Armin, chief of sea-surrounded Gorma?"
"Wie sehr wünscht' ich, daß uns von den letzten merkwürdigen Tagen unsers Freundes so viel eigenhändige Zeugnisse übrig geblieben wären, daß ich nicht nötig hätte, die Folge seiner hinterlaßnen Briefe durch Erzählung zu unterbrechen.",How I wish that there were so many personal testimonies of our friend's last remarkable days that I would not have had to interrupt the series of letters he left behind with a narrative.,"How I wish there was enough material left, covering our friend’s last strange days, so that it would not be necessary to interrupt with narrative the flow of the letters he left behind.","It is a matter of extreme regret that we want original evidence of the last remarkable days of our friend; and we are, therefore, obliged to interrupt the progress of his correspondence, and to supply the deficiency by a connected narration."
"Ein einzig weibliches Geschöpf habe ich hier gefunden, eine Fräulein von B.., sie gleicht Ihnen, liebe Lotte, wenn man Ihnen gleichen kann. »Ei!« werden Sie sagen, »der Mensch legt sich auf niedliche Komplimente!« Ganz unwahr ist es nicht. Seit einiger Zeit bin ich sehr artig, weil ich doch nicht anders sein kann, habe viel Witz, und die Frauenzimmer sagen, es wüßte niemand so fein zu loben als ich (und zu lügen, setzen Sie hinzu, denn ohne das geht es nicht ab, verstehen Sie?). Ich wollte von Fräulein B.. reden. Sie hat viel Seele, die voll aus ihren blauen Augen hervorblickt. Ihr Stand ist ihr zur Last, der keinen der Wünsche ihres Herzens befriedigt. Sie sehnt sich aus dem Getümmel, und wir verphantasieren manche Stunde in ländlichen Szenen von ungemischter Glückseligkeit; ach! und von Ihnen! Wie oft muß sie Ihnen huldigen, muß nicht, tut es freiwillig, hört so gern von Ihnen, liebt Sie. –","I have found a single female creature here, a Fraulein von B.., she is like you, dear Lotte, if one can be like you. ""Eh!"" you will say, ""people lie down on nice compliments!"" It is not entirely untrue. For some time now I've been very nice, because I can't be any other way, I'm very witty, and the women say that no one knows how to praise as well as I do (and how to lie, you add, because without that you can't do it , Do you understand?). I wanted to talk about Miss B.. She has a lot of soul that shines through her blue eyes. Her estate is her burden, which satisfies none of the desires of her heart. She longs to get out of the tumult, and we fantasize for many an hour in rural scenes of unmixed bliss; Oh! and from you! How often does she have to pay homage to you, doesn't have to, does it voluntarily, likes to hear from you, loves you. –","I have found only one sympathetic female here, a Fräulein von B. She is very like you, dear Lotte, if there can be any comparison. Oh, I can hear you say, “He is in a mood for paying a pretty compliment,” and you would not be entirely wrong. For some time now I have been behaving myself, because that seems to be the only thing to do. I have become quite a wit. The ladies say no one knows how to sing their praises like Werther (and to fabricate like him, they usually add, for there is no other way of doing it, you understand?). But I wanted to speak of Fräulein von B. She is a soulful creature who looks one straight in the eye. Hers are blue. Her rank is a burden to her that satisfies none of her aspirations. She longs to get away from all the hollow confusion around her, and we dream-talk many an hour away in blissfully serene, pastoral surroundings. We talk about you. How often she has to worship at your altar— doesn’t have to, does so willingly. She likes to hear me talk about you; she loves you.","I have found but one being here to interest me, a Miss B--.   She resembles you, my dear Charlotte, if any one can possibly resemble you.   ""Ah!"" you will say, ""he has learned how to pay fine compliments."" And this is partly true.   I have been very agreeable lately, as it was not in my power to be otherwise.   I have, moreover, a deal of wit: and the ladies say that no one understands flattery better, or falsehoods you will add; since the one accomplishment invariably accompanies the other.   But I must tell you of Miss B--.   She has abundance of soul, which flashes from her deep blue eyes.   Her rank is a torment to her, and satisfies no one desire of her heart. She would gladly retire from this whirl of fashion, and we often picture to ourselves a life of undisturbed happiness in distant scenes of rural retirement: and then we speak of you, my dear Charlotte; for she knows you, and renders homage to your merits; but her homage is not exacted, but voluntary, she loves you, and delights to hear you made the subject of conversation."
"Ich träume nicht, ich wähne nicht! Nahe am Grabe wird mir es heller. Wir werden sein! wir werden uns wieder sehen! Deine Mutter sehen! ich werde sie sehen, werde sie finden, ach, und vor ihr mein ganzes Herz ausschütten! Deine Mutter, dein Ebenbild.«[117]","I'm not dreaming, I'm not imagining! It gets lighter for me near the grave. We will be! We'll meet again! see your mother! I'll see her, I'll find her, oh, and I'll pour out my whole heart to her! Your mother, your image.«[117]","“I do not dream; I do not think any more. Close to the grave, all grows lighter. We shall be. We shall see each other again. Your mother…I shall see her, find her, and oh, I shall unburden my whole heart to her. Your mother. Your image.”","""I do not dream, I do not rave.   Drawing nearer to the grave my perceptions become clearer.   We shall exist; we shall see each other again; we shall behold your mother; I shall behold her, and expose to her my inmost heart.   Your mother -- your image!"""
"Mit einer stillen Traurigkeit, in der ich ein wenig scheues Wesen zu bemerken schien, antwortete der Mensch mir erst auf meine Fragen; aber gar bald offner, als wenn er sich und mich auf einmal wiedererkennte, gestand er mir seine Fehler, klagte er mir sein Unglück. Könnt' ich dir, mein Freund, jedes seiner Worte vor Gericht stellen! Er bekannte, ja er erzählte mit einer Art von Genuß und Glück der Wiedererinnerung, daß die Leidenschaft zu seiner Hausfrau sich in ihm tagtäglich vermehrt, daß er zuletzt nicht gewußt habe, was er tue, nicht, wie er sich ausdrückte, wo er mit dem Kopfe hingesollt. Er habe weder essen noch trinken noch schlafen können, es habe ihm an der Kehle gestockt, er habe getan, was er nicht tun sollen; was ihm aufgetragen worden, hab' er vergessen, er sei als wie von einem bösen Geist verfolgt gewesen, bis er eines Tages, als er sie in einer obern Kammer gewußt, ihr nachgegangen, ja vielmehr ihr nachgezogen worden sei; da sie seinen Bitten kein Gehör gegeben, hab' er sich ihrer mit Gewalt bemächtigen wollen; er wisse nicht, wie ihm geschehen sei, und nehme Gott zum Zeugen, daß seine Absichten gegen sie immer redlich gewesen, und daß er nichts sehnlicher gewünscht, als daß sie ihn heiraten, daß sie mit ihm ihr Leben zubringen möchte. Da er eine Zeitlang geredet hatte, fing er an zu stocken, wie einer, der noch etwas zu sagen hat und sich es[77] nicht herauszusagen getraut; endlich gestand er mir auch mit Schüchternheit, was sie ihm für kleine Vertraulichkeiten erlaubt, und welche Nähe sie ihm vergönnet. Er brach zwei –, dreimal ab und wiederholte die lebhaftesten Protestationen, daß er das nicht sage, um sie schlecht zu machen, wie er sich ausdrückte, daß er sie liebe und schätze wie vorher, daß so etwas nicht über seinen Mund gekommen sei und daß er es mir nur sage, um mich zu überzeugen, daß er kein ganz verkehrter und unsinniger Mensch sei. – Und hier, mein Bester, fang' ich mein altes Lied wieder an, das ich ewig anstimmen werde: Könnt' ich dir den Menschen vorstellen, wie er vor mir stand, wie er noch vor mir steht! Könnt' ich dir alles recht sagen, damit du fühltest, wie ich an seinem Schicksale teilnehme, teilnehmen muß! Doch genug, da du auch mein Schicksal kennst, auch mich kennst, so weißt du nur zu wohl, was mich zu allen Unglücklichen, was mich besonders zu diesem Unglücklichen hinzieht.","With a quiet sadness, in which I seemed to notice a little shy being, the man first answered my questions; but very soon more openly than when he suddenly recognized himself and me, he confessed his mistakes to me, he bemoaned his misfortune. If I could put you, my friend, on trial for every word he said! He confessed, yes he told with a kind of pleasure and happiness of remembering that his passion for his housewife increased in him every day, that in the end he hadn't known what he was doing, not how he put it, where he was with the heads down. He had been unable to eat, drink or sleep, his throat had caught, he had done what he was not supposed to do; he forgot what he had been told, he was being pursued as if by an evil spirit, until one day, when he knew her in an upper room, he followed her, or rather was drawn after her; since she did not listen to his requests, he wanted to seize her by force; he does not know what happened to him, and he takes God as a witness that his intentions towards her have always been honest, and that he desired nothing more than that she marry him, that she should spend her life with him. After he had been talking for a while, he began to falter, like someone who still has something to say and doesn't dare to say it; Finally, he timidly confessed to me what little intimacy she allows him and what closeness she allows him. He broke off two or three times and repeated the liveliest protestations that he wasn't saying that to belittle her, as he put it, that he loves and appreciates her as before, that something like that hadn't gotten out of his mouth and that he was only saying it to convince me that he wasn't a completely wrong and senseless person. - And here, my friend, I'll start my old song again, which I'll sing forever: Could I imagine the person as he stood before me, as he still stands before me! If I could tell you everything correctly, so that you would feel how I take part, must take part in his fate! But enough, since you also know my fate, you also know me, you know only too well what draws me to all unfortunate people, what draws me particularly to this unfortunate man.","At first the poor fellow answered my questions with a quiet sadness in which I thought I could detect a certain shyness, but soon he spoke with less reserve, as if he had suddenly recognized me and himself. He was quite frank about the mistakes he had made and told me his whole sad story. I wish I could pass on every word of it to you, for you to pass judgment on it. He admitted, with something akin to the zest and happiness of remembrance itself, how his passion for his mistress had grown stronger daily, until in the end he hadn’t known what he was doing or saying or where to lay his poor head. He couldn’t eat, drink, or sleep; he felt choked with emotion; he did things he wasn’t supposed to do and what he was supposed to do he left undone. It was as if he were pursued by demons until, one day, when he knew that she was in one of the upstairs rooms, he went to her there—more than that, he was drawn to her. She wouldn’t give in to him, so he tried to take her by force. He didn’t know what came over him. As God was his witness, his intentions had always been honorable, and he had never longed for anything so much in his life as that she should marry him. After he had spoken on and on like this for a while, he became hesitant, like someone who has more on his mind but is afraid to speak out. At last he shyly confessed to the small intimacies she had allowed him and how close she had let him draw. He broke off several times to protest over and over again that he was not telling me all this to damage her reputation in any way…that was how he put it. He loved and respected her as much as ever; he had never talked about it before and was only telling me now to assure me that he was not a warped or unreasonable man. And here, good friend, I must repeat the old refrain I am constantly singing: if only I could put this man before you as I see him now! If only I could relate his story so you could feel how I share his fate—must share it! But enough—since you know me and my destiny only too well, you probably also know what attracts me to all unfortunate people, and to this man in particular.","At first the peasant lad answered my inquiries with a sort of subdued melancholy, which seemed to me the mark of a timid disposition; but, as we grew to understand each other, he spoke with less reserve, and openly confessed his faults, and lamented his misfortune.   I wish, my dear friend, I could give proper expression to his language.   He told me with a sort of pleasurable recollection, that, after my departure, his passion for his mistress increased daily, until at last he neither knew what he did nor what he said, nor what was to become of him.   He could neither eat nor drink nor sleep: he felt a sense of suffocation; he disobeyed all orders, and forgot all commands involuntarily; he seemed as if pursued by an evil spirit, till one day, knowing that his mistress had gone to an upper chamber, he had followed, or, rather, been drawn after her.   As she proved deaf to his entreaties, he had recourse to violence.   He knows not what happened; but he called God to witness that his intentions to her were honourable, and that he desired nothing more sincerely than that they should marry, and pass their lives together.   When he had come to this point, he began to hesitate, as if there was something which he had not courage to utter, till at length he acknowledged with some confusion certain little confidences she had encouraged, and liberties she had allowed. He broke off two or three times in his narration, and assured me most earnestly that he had no wish to make her bad, as he termed it, for he loved her still as sincerely as ever; that the tale had never before escaped his lips, and was only now told to convince me that he was not utterly lost and abandoned.   And here, my dear friend, I must commence the old song which you know I utter eternally. If I could only represent the man as he stood, and stands now before me, could I only give his true expressions, you would feel compelled to sympathise in his fate.   But enough: you, who know my misfortune and my disposition, can easily comprehend the attraction which draws me toward every unfortunate being, but particularly toward him whose story I have recounted."
"Daß ich des Glückes hätte teilhaftig werden können, für dich zu sterben! Lotte, für dich mich hinzugeben! Ich wollte mutig, ich wollte freudig sterben, wenn ich dir die Ruhe, die Wonne deines Lebens wiederschaffen könnte. Aber ach! das ward nur wenigen Edeln gegeben, ihr Blut für die Ihrigen zu vergießen und durch ihren Tod ein neues, hundertfältiges Leben ihren Freunden anzufachen.","That I could have been lucky enough to die for you! Lotte, give me up for you! I wanted to die bravely, I wanted to die joyfully, if I could give you back the peace and joy of your life. But alas! that was only given to a few nobles, to shed their blood for their own, and by their death to kindle a new life a hundredfold for their friends.","That I was granted the good fortune to die for you, Lotte, to sacrifice myself for you…I would die courageously, joyously, if only I could re-establish the repose and bliss of your existence. But oh, it has been granted to only a few noble men to shed their life’s blood for those they love and, by their death, kindle a new life for their friends.","Oh, that I had enjoyed the bliss of dying for you! how gladly would I have sacrificed myself for you; Charlotte!   And could I but restore peace and joy to your bosom, with what resolution, with what joy, would I not meet my fate!   But it is the lot of only a chosen few to shed their blood for their friends, and by their death to augment, a thousand times, the happiness of those by whom they are beloved."
"Es war eine Gesellschaft draußen unter den Linden, Kaffee zu trinken. Weil sie mir nicht ganz anstand, so blieb ich unter einem Vorwande zurück.","It was a party out under the linden trees drinking coffee. Because she didn't quite become me, I stayed behind under a pretext.","A group of people were taking coffee under the linden trees. They did not appeal to me, so I made up an excuse for not joining them.","A party had assembled outside the house under the linden-trees, to drink coffee.   The company did not exactly please me; and, under one pretext or another, I lingered behind."
"Dem sei nun wie ihm wolle, meine Freude, bei Lotten zu sein, ist hin. Soll ich das Torheit nennen oder Verblendung? – Was braucht's Namen! erzählt die Sache an sich! – Ich wußte alles, was ich jetzt weiß, ehe Albert kam; ich wußte, daß ich keine Prätension an sie zu machen hatte, machte auch keine – das heißt, insofern es möglich ist, bei so viel Liebenswürdigkeit nicht zu begehren – Und jetzt macht der Fratze große Augen, da der andere nun wirklich kommt und ihm das Mädchen wegnimmt.","Be that as it may, my joy at being with Lotten is gone. Should I call that folly or delusion? – What does a name need! tells the thing itself! – I knew everything I know now before Albert came; I knew that I didn't have to make any pretensions to her, didn't make any either - that is, insofar as it's possible not to desire with so much kindness - And now the grimacing face widens its eyes because the other one is really coming and that for him girl takes away.","Be that as it may, the joyous days with Lotte are over. What shall I call it? Folly? Delusion? It does not need a name. The dilemma speaks for itself. I knew all I know now before he came; I knew that I had no claim to her and demanded none, or let us say, I did not desire her more than one simply has to desire anyone so altogether lovely. And now, idiot that I am, I stare wide-eyed with astonishment at my rival, who has come at last to take the girl away!","But, be that as it may, my pleasure with Charlotte is over.   Call it folly or infatuation, what signifies a name?   The thing speaks for itself.   Before Albert came, I knew all that I know now.   I knew I could make no pretensions to her, nor did I offer any, that is, as far as it was possible, in the presence of so much loveliness, not to pant for its enjoyment.   And now, behold me like a silly fellow, staring with astonishment when another comes in, and deprives me of my love."

"Letzthin kam ich zum Brunnen und fand ein junges Dienstmädchen, das ihr Gefäß auf die unterste Treppe gesetzt hatte und sich umsah, ob keine Kamerädin kommen wollte, ihr es auf den Kopf zu helfen. Ich stieg hinunter und sah sie an. – »Soll ich Ihr helfen, Jungfer?« sagte ich. – Sie ward rot über und über. – »O nein, Herr!« sagte sie. – »Ohne Umstände.« – Sie legte ihren Kringen zurecht, und ich half ihr. Sie dankte und stieg hinauf.","The other day I came to the well and found a young maid who had set her vessel on the bottom step and was looking round to see if any of her companions would come and help her up. I climbed down and looked at her. - ""Shall I help you, youngster?"" I said. - She blushed all over. ""Oh no, sir!"" she said. - ""Without any trouble."" - She adjusted her ring and I helped her. She thanked and climbed up.","Not long ago I came to the spring and found a young servant girl there. She had put her water jar on the lowest step and was looking around in the hope that a friend might come and help her place it on her head. I walked down the steps and faced her. “Would you like me to help you?” I asked. She blushed and replied, “Oh no, sir!” “Let’s not stand on ceremony,” I said. She adjusted the pad on her head, I helped her with her pitcher, she thanked me, and up she went!","The other day I went to the fountain, and found a young servant-girl, who had set her pitcher on the lowest step, and looked around to see if one of her companions was approaching to place it on her head.   I ran down, and looked at her.   ""Shall I help you, pretty lass?"" said I.  She blushed deeply.   ""Oh, sir!"" she exclaimed. "" No ceremony!"" I replied.   She adjusted her head-gear, and I helped her.   She thanked me, and ascended the steps."
"Er trat in die Tür, fragte nach dem Alten und nach Lotten, er fand das Haus in einiger Bewegung. Der älteste[94] Knabe sagte ihm, es sei drüben in Wahlheim ein Unglück geschehn, es sei ein Bauer erschlagen worden! – Es machte das weiter keinen Eindruck auf ihn. – Er trat in die Stube und fand Lotten beschäftigt, dem Alten zuzureden, der ungeachtet seiner Krankheit hinüber wollte, um an Ort und Stelle die Tat zu untersuchen. Der Täter war noch unbekannt, man hatte den Erschlagenen des Morgens vor der Haustür gefunden, man hatte Mutmaßungen: der Entleibte war Knecht einer Witwe, die vorher einen andern im Dienste gehabt, der mit Unfrieden aus dem Hause gekommen war.","He stepped in the door, asked about the old man and about Lotte, he found the house moving a bit. The oldest[94] boy told him that an accident had happened over in Wahlheim, that a farmer had been killed! - It made no further impression on him. – He entered the room and found Lotte busy persuading the old man, who, despite his illness, wanted to go over there to investigate the crime on the spot. The culprit was still unknown, the dead man had been found outside the front door that morning, there were suspicions: the dead man was the servant of a widow who had previously had someone else on the job who had come out of the house with discord.","He walked up to the door, asked after the old man and Lotte, and found the house in quite a stir. The oldest boy told him that there had been a disaster in Wahlheim. A peasant had been murdered. The news had no particular effect on Werther. He went into the living room and found Lotte trying to talk her father out of going over to look into the matter in spite of his weak condition. The murderer was still unknown. The dead man had been found in front of his door early that morning. Suspicions centered on someone. The murdered man was the servant of a widow who had had another man in her service before him. This man had been dismissed under disagreeable circumstances.","Upon one occasion he entered the house; and, inquiring for Charlotte, he observed that the inmates were in a state of unusual confusion.   The eldest boy informed him that a dreadful misfortune had occurred at Walheim, -- that a peasant had been murdered!   But this made little impression upon him.   Entering the apartment, he found Charlotte engaged reasoning with her father, who, in spite of his infirmity, insisted on going to the scene of the crime, in order to institute an inquiry.   The criminal was unknown; the victim had been found dead at his own door that morning.   Suspicions were excited: the murdered man had been in the service of a widow, and the person who had previously filled the situation had been dismissed from her employment."

"Was ist der Mensch, der gepriesene Halbgott! Ermangeln ihm nicht eben da die Kräfte, wo er sie am nötigsten braucht? Und wenn er in Freude sich aufschwingt oder im Leiden versinkt, wird er nicht in beiden eben da aufgehalten, eben da zu dem stumpfen, kalten Bewußtsein wieder zurückgebracht, da er sich in der Fülle des Unendlichen zu verlieren sehnte?","What is man, the praised demigod! Doesn't he lack the strength exactly where he needs it most? And if he soars in joy or sinks in suffering, is he not arrested in both, just there, brought back to the dull, cold consciousness where he longed to lose himself in the fullness of infinity?","What is man, this exalted demigod? Doesn’t he lack power just when he needs it most? Whether he is uplifted by joy or engulfed by suffering, is he not stopped in both conditions and brought back to dull, cold consciousness just when he is ready to lose himself in the abundance of the infinite?","And what is man -- that boasted demigod?   Do not his powers fail when he most requires their use?   And whether he soar in joy, or sink in sorrow, is not his career in both inevitably arrested? And, whilst he fondly dreams that he is grasping at infinity, does he not feel compelled to return to a consciousness of his cold, monotonous existence?"
"Wenn Sie mich sähen, meine Beste, in dem Schwall von Zerstreuung! Wie ausgetrocknet meine Sinne werden! Nicht einen Augenblick der Fülle des Herzens, nicht eine selige Stunde! nichts! nichts! Ich stehe wie vor einem Raritätenkasten und sehe die Männchen und Gäulchen vor mir herumrücken, und frage mich oft, ob es nicht optischer Betrug ist. Ich spiele mit, vielmehr, ich werde gespielt wie eine Marionette und fasse manchmal meinen Nachbar an der hölzernen Hand und schaudere zurück. Des Abends nehme ich mir vor, den Sonnenaufgang zu genießen, und komme nicht aus dem Bette; am Tage hoffe ich, mich des Mondscheins zu erfreuen, und bleibe in meiner Stube. Ich weiß nicht recht, warum ich aufstehe, warum ich schlafen gehe.","If you saw me, my dear, in the torrent of distraction! How parched my senses become! Not a moment of fullness of heart, not a happy hour! Nothing! Nothing! I stand in front of a rarity box and see the males and little horses moving around in front of me, and I often ask myself whether it isn't optical fraud. I play along, or rather, am played like a marionette, sometimes grabbing my neighbor's wooden hand and shuddering. In the evening I resolve to enjoy the sunrise and cannot get out of bed; during the day I hope to enjoy the moonlight and stay in my room. I don't really know why I get up, why I go to sleep.","If you could only see me, dearest—in a whirl of distraction, but how arid is my spirit! Not a heartfelt moment, not a blissful hour—nothing…nothing. Sometimes I feel as if I were standing in front of a peep show. I can see tiny men and horses maneuvering in front of me, and I ask myself if it is not an optical illusion. I join in the games, or rather, I should say that I let myself be manipulated like a puppet, and sometimes I touch my neighbor’s wooden hand and withdraw mine in horror. In the evening I decide to enjoy the sunrise, but in the morning I don’t bother to get up. During the day I look forward to an enjoyment of the moonlight; then at night I stay in my room. I don’t know why I get up or why I go to bed!","Could you but see me, my dear Charlotte, in the whirl of dissipation, -- how my senses are dried up, but my heart is at no time full.   I enjoy no single moment of happiness: all is vain -- nothing touches me.   I stand, as it were, before the raree-show: I see the little puppets move, and I ask whether it is not an optical illusion.   I am amused with these puppets, or, rather, I am myself one of them: but, when I sometimes grasp my neighbour's hand, I feel that it is not natural; and I withdraw mine with a shudder.   In the evening I say I will enjoy the next morning's sunrise, and yet I remain in bed: in the day I promise to ramble by moonlight; and I, nevertheless, remain at home.   I know not why I rise, nor why I go to sleep."
"»Werther«, fing sie an, »und diese Frau sollte dahin sein! Gott! wenn ich manchmal denke, wie man das Liebste seines Lebens wegtragen läßt, und niemand als die Kinder das so scharf fühlt, die sich noch lange beklagten, die schwarzen Männer hätten die Mama weggetragen!«","""Werther,"" she began, ""and this woman should be gone! God! When I sometimes think how one lets the dearest of his life be carried away, and no one feels it so sharply as the children, who complained for a long time that the black men had carried Mama away!""","“And this good woman is supposed to be gone from us,” Lotte went on. “Dear God, Werther, when I think how one permits the dearest thing in life to be carried away, and no one feels it as keenly as the children. For a long, long time after it was all over they lamented—how the black men came and carried Mama away.”","""And such a being,"" She continued, ""was to leave us, Werther! Great God, must we thus part with everything we hold dear in this world?   Nobody felt this more acutely than the children: they cried and lamented for a long time afterward, complaining that men had carried away their dear mamma."""
"Ich zuckte die Achseln und gab's ihm zu. – »Doch, mein Lieber«, fuhr ich fort, »finden sich auch hier einige Ausnahmen. Es ist wahr, der Diebstahl ist ein Laster; aber der Mensch, der, um sich und die Seinigen vom gegenwärtigen Hungertode zu erretten, auf Raub ausgeht, verdient der Mitleiden oder Strafe? Wer hebt den ersten Stein auf gegen den Ehemann, der im gerechten Zorne sein untreues Weib und ihren nichtswürdigen Verführer aufopfert? Gegen das Mädchen, das in einer wonnevollen Stunde sich in den unaufhaltsamen Freuden der Liebe verliert? Unsere Gesetze selbst, diese kaltblütigen Pedanten, lassen sich rühren und halten ihre Strafe zurück.«","I shrugged and admitted it to him. ""Yes, my dear,"" I continued, ""there are a few exceptions here too. It is true, stealing is a vice; but the man who, in order to save himself and his family from the present starvation, sets out on robbery, deserves pity or punishment? Who takes up the first stone against the husband who, in righteous anger, sacrifices his unfaithful wife and her worthless seducer? Against the girl who, in a blissful hour, loses herself in the unstoppable joys of love? Our laws themselves, these cold-blooded pedants, let themselves be moved and withhold their punishment.”","I shrugged and had to agree with him. “ And yet, my dear fellow,” I went on, “here too you will find your exceptions. To steal is a sin, true, but the poor man who steals to save himself and his dear ones from starvation, what does he deserve? Pity or punishment? Who will cast the first stone against the married man who, in his first fury, murders his faithless wife and her vile seducer? And what about the young girl who in a blissful hour loses herself in the irresistible delights of love? Even our laws, cold-blooded and pedantic as they are, can be moved to withhold punishment.”","I granted it, and shrugged my shoulders. ""But still, my good friend,"" I continued, ""there are some exceptions here too.   Theft is a crime; but the man who commits it from extreme poverty, with no design but to save his family from perishing, is he an object of pity, or of punishment?   Who shall throw the first stone at a husband, who, in the heat of just resentment, sacrifices his faithless wife and her perfidious seducer? or at the young maiden, who, in her weak hour of rapture, forgets herself in the impetuous joys of love?   Even our laws, cold and cruel as they are, relent in such cases, and withhold their punishment."""
"Wenn ich nur ihre schwarzen Augen sehe, ist mir es schon wohl! Sieh, und was mich verdrießt, ist, daß Albert nicht so beglückt zu sein scheinet, als er – hoffte – als ich – zu sein glaubte – wenn – Ich mache nicht gern Gedankenstriche, aber hier kann ich mich nicht anders ausdrücken – und mich dünkt deutlich genug.","Just looking at her black eyes makes me feel good! See, and what annoys me is that Albert doesn't seem as happy as he - hoped - as I - thought he was - when - I don't like to use dashes, but I can't express myself any other way here - and methinks clear enough.","If only I can look into her dark eyes, then all is well with me again. And do you know what grieves me? I don’t think Albert is as happy as he…hoped to be…as I thought I was when… I don’t like all these pauses, but can’t seem to express myself in any other way at this point…and am expressing myself clearly enough, I think, anyway.","Only to gaze upon her dark eyes is to me a source of happiness! And what grieves me, is, that Albert does not seem so happy as he -- hoped to be -- as I should have been -- if -- I am no friend to these pauses, but here I cannot express it otherwise; and probably I am explicit enough."

"Sie folgt' ihm und rief nach Armar; nichts antwortete als die Stimme des Felsens. ›Armar! mein Lieber! mein Lieber! warum ängstest du mich so? Höre, Sohn Arnarths! höre! Daura ist's, die dich ruft!‹","She followed him and called to Armar; nothing answered but the voice of the rock. ›Armar! My dear! My dear! why do you scare me so Hear, son of Arnarth! listen! It is Daura who is calling you!‹","“‘Daura followed him and cried out to Armar. “Armar, my beloved, my beloved! Why dost thou frighten me? Hear me, O son of Armath!

Armar, my love, my love! why tormentest thou me with fear?   Hear, son of Arnart, hear! it is Daura who calleth thee.  "
"Danke für deine beiden Briefe. Ich antwortete nicht, weil ich dieses Blatt liegen ließ, bis mein Abschied vom Hofe da wäre; ich fürchtete, meine Mutter möchte sich an den Minister wenden und mir mein Vorhaben erschweren. Nun aber ist es geschehen, mein Abschied ist da. Ich mag euch nicht sagen, wie ungern man mir ihn gegeben hat, und was[71] mir der Minister schreibt – ihr würdet in neue Lamentationen ausbrechen. Der Erbprinz hat mir zum Abschiede fünfundzwanzig Dukaten geschickt, mit einem Wort, das mich bis zu Tränen gerührt hat; also brauche ich von der Mutter das Geld nicht, um das ich neulich schrieb.","Thank you for your two letters. I did not answer, because I left this paper lying around until my departure from court was due; I was afraid my mother would go to the minister and make my project difficult. But now it's done, my farewell is here. I don't want to tell you how unwillingly they gave it to me and what the minister wrote to me - you would burst into new lamentations. The hereditary prince sent me twenty-five ducats as a farewell, in a word that moved me to tears; so I don't need the money I wrote about the other day from my mother.","For your information: Thank you for both letters. I did not reply because I left this letter unfinished until the time of my departure from court. I was afraid my mother might appeal to the minister and make it more difficult for me to go through with my plans. But now it is all over, and the time for my departure has come. I don’t want to say how reluctant they were to let me go or what the minister wrote—you would only break out in renewed lamentations. The young duke gave me twenty-five ducats as a farewell gift, with a few words that moved me to tears, so my mother need not send me the money I asked for recently.","Thanks for both your letters.   I delayed my reply, and withheld this letter, till I should obtain an answer from the court.   I feared my mother might apply to the minister to defeat my purpose. But my request is granted, my resignation is accepted.   I shall not recount with what reluctance it was accorded, nor relate what the minister has written: you would only renew your lamentations. The crown prince has sent me a present of five and twenty ducats; and, indeed, such goodness has affected me to tears.   For this reason I shall not require from my mother the money for which I lately applied."
"Das ist alles garstiges Gewäsch, was ich da von ihr sage, leidige Abstraktionen, die nicht einen Zug ihres Selbst ausdrücken. Ein andermal – nein, nicht ein andermal, jetzt gleich will ich dir's erzählen. Tu' ich's jetzt nicht, so geschäh'[19] es niemals. Denn, unter uns, seit ich angefangen habe zu schreiben, war ich schon dreimal im Begriffe, die Feder niederzulegen, mein Pferd satteln zu lassen und hinauszureiten. Und doch schwur ich mir heute früh, nicht hinauszureiten, und gehe doch alle Augenblick' ans Fenster, zu sehen, wie hoch die Sonne noch steht. – – –","It's all nasty nonsense I'm saying about her, tiresome abstractions that don't express a trait of herself. Another time - no, not another time, I'll tell you about it right now. If I don't do it now, it will never happen. For, between us, since I began to write, three times have I been about to put down my pen, have my horse saddled, and ride out. And yet I swore to myself this morning not to ride out, and go to the window every moment to see how high the sun is still. – – –","And all I have just written is arrant nonsense and tiresome notions that really don’t give you a single one of her traits. Some other time— no, not some other time but right now I am going to tell you about it. If I don’t do it now, I never will. Because, to be quite frank, since I started writing to you I have put down my pen three times to see that my horse was saddled so that I could ride over to visit her. Although I swore to myself this morning that I would not go there today, I find myself constantly wandering over to the window to note how high the sun still stands in the sky. There.","But all this is ugly balderdash, which expresses not a single character nor feature.   Some other time -- but no, not some other time, now, this very instant, will I tell you all about it.   Now or never.   Well, between ourselves, since I commenced my letter, I have been three times on the point of throwing down my pen, of ordering my horse, and riding out.   And yet I vowed this morning that I would not ride to-day, and yet every moment I am rushing to the window to see how high the sun is. I could not restrain myself -- go to her"
"Lieber Wilhelm, ich habe allerlei nachgedacht, über die Begier im Menschen, sich auszubreiten, neue Entdeckungen zu machen, herumzuschweifen; und dann wieder über den[28] inneren Trieb, sich der Einschränkung willig zu ergeben, in dem Gleise der Gewohnheit so hinzufahren und sich weder um Rechts noch um Links zu bekümmern.","Dear Wilhelm, I've been thinking all sorts of things, rambling about the human desire to expand, to make new discoveries; and then again about the inner urge to yield willingly to limitations, to drive along the tracks of habit and to bother neither with right nor with left.","Dear William, I have given a great deal of thought to man’s desire for expansion and his urge to explore and roam the face of the earth, and then again, I think about his inner impetus to surrender willingly to the restrictions imposed by life and to travel in the rut of routine living, never giving a thought to what goes on to right or left.","I have often, my dear Wilhelm, reflected on the eagerness men feel to wander and make new discoveries, and upon that secret impulse which afterward inclines them to return to their narrow circle, conform to the laws of custom, and embarrass themselves no longer with what passes around them."
"Was man ein Kind ist! Was man nach so einem Blicke geizt! Was man ein Kind ist! – Wir waren nach Wahlheim gegangen. Die Frauenzimmer fuhren hinaus, und während unserer Spaziergänge glaubte ich in Lottens schwarzen Augen – ich bin ein Tor, verzeih mir's! du solltest sie sehen, diese Augen. – Daß ich kurz bin (denn die Augen fallen mir zu vor Schlaf): siehe, die Frauenzimmer stiegen ein, da standen um die Kutsche der junge W.., Selstadt und Audran und ich. Da ward aus dem Schlage geplaudert mit den Kerlchen, die freilich leicht und lüftig genug waren. – Ich[36] suchte Lottens Augen; ach, sie gingen von einem zum andern! Aber auf mich! mich! mich! der ganz allein auf sie resigniert dastand, fielen sie nicht! – Mein Herz sagte ihr tausend Adieu! Und sie sah mich nicht! Die Kutsche fuhr vorbei, und eine Träne stand mir im Auge. Ich sah ihr nach und sah Lottens Kopfputz sich zum Schlage herauslehnen, und sie wandte sich um zu sehen, ach! nach mir? – Lieber! In dieser Ungewißheit schwebe ich; das ist mein Trost: vielleicht hat sie sich nach mir umgesehen! Vielleicht! – Gute Nacht! O, was ich ein Kind bin!","What a child is! What one covets after such a look! What a child is! – We had gone to Wahlheim. The women drove out, and during our walks I believed in Lotte's black eyes - I'm a fool, forgive me! you should see them, those eyes. – To be brief (because my eyes are closing with sleep): look, the women got in, there stood around the carriage young W.., Selstadt and Audran and I. There was chatter with the little fellows, who of course were light and breezy enough. – I[36] looked for Lotte's eyes; ah, they went from one to the other! But on me! me! me! who stood there resigned to them all alone, they didn't fall! – My heart said a thousand adieu to her! And she didn't see me! The carriage passed and a tear stood in my eye. I looked after her and saw Lotte's headdress leaning out to strike, and she turned to see, ah! After me? - Rather! In this uncertainty I float; that's my consolation: maybe she was looking around for me! Perhaps! - Good night! O what a child I am!","William, we are children! Have you any idea how one can pine for a glance from one’s beloved? We are children!

I am so sleepy my eyelids are drooping, but listen…the ladies were getting into the carriage. Young W., Selstadt, Andran, and I were standing beside it, chatting about nothing in particular. I tried to catch Lotte’s eye. She was looking from one man to the other, but not at me, me, me, who alone stood there waiting for her glance. My heart was bidding her a thousand farewells, and she didn’t even see me! The carriage passed us, and there were tears in my eyes. I looked after her and could see her bonnet as she leaned out and turned to look at—at whom? And that, in brief, describes my uncertainty, and my consolation. Perhaps she did look back at me. Perhaps. Good night. Oh William, what a child I am!","What a child is man that he should be so solicitous about a look! What a child is man!   We had been to Walheim: the ladies went in a carriage; but during our walk I thought I saw in Charlotte's dark eyes -- I am a fool -- but forgive me! you should see them, -- those eyes. -- However, to be brief (for my own eyes are weighed down with sleep), you must know, when the ladies stepped into their carriage again, young W. Seldstadt, Andran, and I were standing about the door.   They are a merry set of fellows, and they were all laughing and joking together.   I watched Charlotte's eyes. They wandered from one to the other; but they did not light on me, on me, who stood there motionless, and who saw nothing but her! My heart bade her a thousand times adieu, but she noticed me not. The carriage drove off; and my eyes filled with tears.   I looked after her: suddenly I saw Charlotte's bonnet leaning out of the window, and she turned to look back, was it at me?   My dear friend, I know not; and in this uncertainty I find consolation.   Perhaps she turned to look at me.   Perhaps!   Good-night -- what a child I am!"

Und das macht mir denn so manche glückliche Stunde – bis ich mich wieder von ihr losreißen muß! Ach Wilhelm! wozu mich mein Herz oft drängt! – Wenn ich bei ihr gesessen bin, zwei, drei Stunden, und mich an ihrer Gestalt, an ihrem Betragen, an dem himmlischen Ausdruck ihrer Worte geweidet habe, und nun nach und nach alle meine Sinne aufgespannt werden, mir es düster vor den Augen wird, ich kaum noch höre, und es mich an die Gurgel faßt wie ein Meuchelmörder, dann mein Herz in wilden Schlägen den bedrängten Sinnen Luft zu machen sucht und ihre Verwirrung nur vermehrt – Wilhelm, ich weiß oft nicht, ob ich auf der Welt bin! Und – wenn nicht manchmal die Wehmut das Übergewicht nimmt und Lotte mir den elenden Trost erlaubt, auf ihrer Hand meine Beklemmung auszuweinen, – so muß ich fort, muß hinaus, und schweife dann weit im Felde umher; einen jähen Berg zu klettern ist dann meine Freude, durch einen unwegsamen Wald einen Pfad durchzuarbeiten, durch die Hecken, die mich verletzen, durch die Dornen, die mich zerreißen! Da wird mir's etwas besser! Etwas! Und wenn ich vor Müdigkeit und Durst manchmal unterwegs liegen bleibe, manchmal in der tiefen Nacht, wenn der hohe Vollmond über mir steht, im einsamen Walde auf einen krumm gewachsenen Baum mich setze, um meinen verwundeten Sohlen nur einige Linderung zu verschaffen, und dann in einer ermattenden Ruhe in dem Dämmerschein hinschlummre! O Wilhelm! die einsame Wohnung einer Zelle, das härene Gewand und der Stachelgürtel wären Labsale, nach denen meine Seele schmachtet. Adieu! Ich sehe dieses Elendes kein Ende als das Grab.[55]","unfortunate one! Aren't you a fool? Aren't you cheating on yourself? What is this raging, endless passion? I have no more prayer than to her; no other form appears to my imagination than hers, and I see everything in the world around me only in relation to her. And that gives me so many happy hours - until I have to tear myself away from her again! Oh William! what my heart often urges me to do! - When I've sat with her for two or three hours, and have feasted on her figure, her demeanor, the heavenly expression of her words, and now all my senses are gradually opened up, my eyes grow dark , I can hardly hear anymore, and it grabs my throat like an assassin, then my heart pounding wildly tries to give vent to the oppressed senses and only increases their confusion - Wilhelm, I often don't know if I'm alive! And - if melancholy doesn't sometimes take the upper hand and Lotte allows me the miserable comfort of crying out my anxiety on her hand - then I have to go, have to go out, and then wander far and wide in the field; then my joy is to climb a steep mountain, to work a path through an impassable forest, through the hedgerows that hurt me, through the thorns that tear me apart! I'll feel a little better then! Something! And if I sometimes stay lying on the road because of tiredness and thirst, sometimes in the deep night, when the high full moon is above me, sit down on a crooked tree in the lonely forest, just to get some relief for my wounded soles, and then in slumber in a languid rest in the twilight! O William! the lonely dwelling of a cell, the hairy robe and the spiked belt would be refreshments for which my soul yearns. Adieu! I see no end to this misery but the grave.[55]","Miserable wretch! Aren’t you a fool? Aren’t you deceiving yourself? What is the meaning of this riotous, endless passion? There are no more prayers in me except prayers to her; my imagination can shape no other figure but hers; I see everything around me only in its relationship to her. And this results every now and then in a few happy hours, until I must tear myself away from her again. William, William, you have no idea what my heart often urges me to do! When I have sat beside her for two or three hours and have basked in the sight of her, in her behavior, in the heavenly expression she puts into everything she says—then slowly but surely all my sensibilities are stretched to the breaking point. It grows dark before my eyes; I can scarcely hear; it has me by the throat like an assassin. My wildly beating heart tries to give breath to my afflicted senses and succeeds only in confusing them further…. William, then I don’t know where I am! And when my melancholy gets the better of me and Lotte grants me the miserable consolation of giving way to my anguish in a flood of tears, as happens sometimes—then I have to get away, out, out…and I wander disconsolately in the fields. At moments such as these I like to climb a steep mountain or hack my way through uncleared forest, through hedges that hurt me, through brambles that scratch me! Then I feel a little better. A little better. And when I lie down to rest on the way, exhausted and thirsty, or when in the dark of night, with the full moon shining above me, I sit down on the branch of a deformed tree to rest my sore feet for a moment and sleep in an enervating stillness into the dawn—William, a solitary cell, a hair shirt, and a crown of thorns would be balm for which my soul is pining. Adieu! I can see no end to this misery but the grave!","Unhappy being that I am!   Why do I thus deceive myself?   What is to come of all this wild, aimless, endless passion?   I cannot pray except to her.   My imagination sees nothing but her: all surrounding objects are of no account, except as they relate to her.   In this dreamy state I enjoy many happy hours, till at length I feel compelled to tear myself away from her.   Ah, Wilhelm, to what does not my heart often compel me!   When I have spent several hours in her company, till I feel completely absorbed by her figure, her grace, the divine expression of her thoughts, my mind becomes gradually excited to the highest excess, my sight grows dim, my hearing confused, my breathing oppressed as if by the hand of a murderer, and my beating heart seeks to obtain relief for my aching senses.   I am sometimes unconscious whether I really exist.   If in such moments I find no sympathy, and Charlotte does not allow me to enjoy the melancholy consolation of bathing her hand with my tears, I feel compelled to tear myself from her, when I either wander through the country, climb some precipitous cliff, or force a path through the trackless thicket, where I am lacerated and torn by thorns and briers; and thence I find relief.   Sometimes I lie stretched on the ground, overcome with fatigue and dying with thirst; sometimes, late in the night, when the moon shines above me, I recline against an aged tree in some sequestered forest, to rest my weary limbs, when, exhausted and worn, I sleep till break of day.   O Wilhelm! the hermit's cell, his sackcloth, and girdle of thorns would be luxury and indulgence compared with what I suffer. Adieu!   I see no end to this wretchedness except the grave."
"Jedes Wort, das sie sprach, ging mir wie ein Schwert durchs Herz. Sie fühlte nicht, welche Barmherzigkeit es gewesen wäre, mir das alles zu verschweigen, und nun fügte sie noch hinzu, was weiter würde geträtscht werden, was eine Art Menschen darüber triumphieren würde. Wie man sich nunmehr über die Strafe meines Übermuts und meiner Geringschätzung anderer, die sie mir schon lange vorwerfen, kitzeln und freuen würde. Das alles, Wilhelm, von ihr zu hören, mit der Stimme der wahrsten Teilnehmung – ich war zerstört und bin noch wütend in mir. Ich wollte, daß sich einer unterstünde, mir's vorzuwerfen, daß ich ihm den Degen durch den Leib stoßen könnte; wenn ich Blut sähe, würde mir's besser werden. Ach, ich hab' hundertmal ein[70] Messer ergriffen, um diesem gedrängten Herzen Luft zu machen. Man erzählt von einer edlen Art Pferde, die, wenn sie schrecklich erhitzt und aufgejagt sind, sich selbst aus Instinkt eine Ader aufbeißen, um sich zum Atem zu helfen. So ist mir's oft, ich möchte mir eine Ader öffnen, die mir die ewige Freiheit schaffte.","Every word she spoke pierced my heart like a sword. She didn't feel how merciful it would have been to keep all this from me, and now she added what would be gossip, what kind of people would triumph over it. How one would now tickle and rejoice at the punishment for my arrogance and my contempt for others, whom they have long accused me of. Hearing all this from her, Wilhelm, with the voice of truest sympathy - I was devastated and I'm still angry inside. I wished that someone dared to reproach me for putting my sword through his body; if I saw blood I would feel better. Oh, I've picked up a knife a hundred times to give vent to this oppressed heart. There is a story told of a noble breed of horses which, when terribly overheated and agitated, instinctively bites a vein to help themselves breathe. It's often like that for me, I would like to open up a vein that gave me eternal freedom.","Every word she spoke was a stab in the heart. She didn’t seem to realize at all how merciful it would have been to spare me all this, but went on to say how people would continue to talk about it, and what kind of people would gloat over it, and how it would amuse and delight them to see my arrogance and my poor opinion of others punished…. I have been reproached for them often enough. To hear her tell me all this, William, with so much compassion in her voice…I was shattered and am still furious with myself. I wish someone would dare reproach me about the whole thing so that I could run a dagger through his heart. If only I could see blood, I know I would feel better. Oh, I have picked up a knife a hundred times with the intention of plunging it into my own heart! I have heard tell of a noble breed of stallions who, when they are overheated and run wild, instinctively bite open one of their veins to relieve themselves. I feel like that often. I would like to open the vein that would give me eternal freedom.","Every word she uttered was a dagger to my heart.   She did not feel what a mercy it would have been to conceal everything from me. She told me, in addition, all the impertinence that would be further circulated, and how the malicious would triumph; how they would rejoice over the punishment of my pride, over my humiliation for that want of esteem for others with which I had often been reproached. To hear all this, Wilhelm, uttered by her in a voice of the most sincere sympathy, awakened all my passions; and I am still in a state of extreme excitement.   I wish I could find a man to jeer me about this event.   I would sacrifice him to my resentment.   The sight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury.   A hundred times have I seized a dagger, to give ease to this oppressed heart. Naturalists tell of a noble race of horses that instinctively open a vein with their teeth, when heated and exhausted by a long course, in order to breathe more freely.   I am often tempted to open a vein, to procure for myself everlasting liberty."

"Und, darf ich es sagen? Warum nicht, Wilhelm? Sie wäre mit mir glücklicher geworden als mit ihm! O er ist nicht der Mensch, die Wünsche dieses Herzens alle zu füllen. Ein gewisser Mangel an Fühlbarkeit, ein Mangel – nimm es, wie du willst; daß sein Herz nicht sympathetisch schlägt bei – o! – bei der Stelle eines lieben Buches, wo mein Herz und Lottens in einem zusammentreffen; in hundert andern Vorfällen, wenn es kommt, daß unsere Empfindungen über eine Handlung eines Dritten laut werden. Lieber Wilhelm! – Zwar er liebt sie von ganzer Seele, und so eine Liebe, was verdient die nicht! –","And may I say it? Why not William? She would have been happier with me than with him! O he is not the man to fill all the desires of this heart. A certain lack of sensibility, a lack - take it as you will; that his heart does not beat sympathetically at – oh! - at the point of a dear book, where my heart and Lotten's meet in one; in a hundred other instances, when it comes to our feelings about an action of a third party. Dear William! – Admittedly he loves her with all his soul, and such a love, who doesn't deserve it! –","And—do I dare say it? Why not, William? She would have been happier with me. He is not the man to fulfill all her desires. A certain lack of sensitivity, a lack… oh, put it any way you like …his heart does not respond to certain passages in a book over which Lotte’s and mine would meet, and on a hundred other occasions…when we are talking about someone else’s behavior…oh, my dear William, of course he loves her with all his heart, and love such as that merits all things!","And shall I avow it?   Why should I not, Wilhelm?   She would have been happier with me than with him.   Albert is not the man to satisfy the wishes of such a heart.   He wants a certain sensibility; he wants -- in short, their hearts do not beat in unison.   How often, my dear friend, im reading a passage from some interesting book, when my heart and Charlotte's seemed to meet, and in a hundred other instances when our sentiments were unfolded by the story of some fictitious character, have I felt that we were made for each other!   But, dear Wilhelm, he loves her with his whole soul; and what does not such a love deserve?"
"Das volle, warme Gefühl meines Herzens an der lebendigen Natur, das mich mit so vieler Wonne überströmte, das rings umher die Welt mir zu einem Paradiese schuf, wird mir jetzt zu einem unerträglichen Peiniger, zu einem quälenden Geist, der mich auf allen Wegen verfolgt. Wenn ich sonst vom Felsen über den Fluß bis zu jenen Hügeln das fruchtbare Tal überschaute und alles um mich her keimen und quellen sah; wenn ich jene Berge, vom Fuße bis auf zum Gipfel, mit hohen, dichten Bäumen bekleidet, jene Täler in ihren mannigfaltigen Krümmungen von den lieblichsten Wäldern beschattet sah, und der sanfte Fluß zwischen den lispelnden Rohren dahingleitete und die lieben Wolken abspiegelte, die der sanfte Abendwind am Himmel herüberwiegte; wenn ich dann die Vögel um mich den Wald beleben hörte, und die Millionen Mückenschwärme im letzten roten Strahle der Sonne mutig tanzten, und ihr letzter zuckender Blick den summenden Käfer aus seinem Grase befreite, und das Schwirren und Weben um mich her mich auf den Boden aufmerksam machte, und das Moos, das meinem harten Felsen seine Nahrung abzwingt, und das Geniste, das den dürren Sandhügel hinunter wächst, mir[51] das innere, glühende, heilige Leben der Natur eröffnete: wie faßte ich das alles in mein warmes Herz, fühlte mich in der überfließenden Fülle wie vergöttert, und die herrlichen Gestalten der unendlichen Welt bewegten sich allbelebend in meiner Seele. Ungeheure Berge umgaben mich, Abgründe lagen vor mir, und Wetterbäche stürzten herunter, die Flüsse strömten unter mir, und Wald und Gebirg erklang; und ich sah sie wirken und schaffen ineinander in den Tiefen der Erde, alle die unergründlichen Kräfte; und nun über der Erde und unter dem Himmel wimmeln die Geschlechter der mannigfaltigen Geschöpfe. Alles, alles bevölkert mit tausendfachen Gestalten; und die Menschen dann sich in Häuslein zusammen sichern und sich annisten und herrschen in ihrem Sinne über die weite Welt! Armer Tor! der du alles so gering achtest, weil du so klein bist. – Vom unzugänglichen Gebirge über die Einöde, die kein Fuß betrat, bis ans Ende des unbekannten Ozeans weht der Geist des Ewigschaffenden und freut sich jedes Staubes, der ihn vernimmt und lebt. – Ach damals, wie oft habe ich mich mit Fittichen eines Kranichs, der über mich hin flog, zu dem Ufer des ungemessenen Meeres gesehnt, aus dem schäumenden Becher des Unendlichen jene schwellende Lebenswonne zu trinken und nur einen Augenblick in der eingeschränkten Kraft meines Busens einen Tropfen der Seligkeit des Wesens zu fühlen, das alles in sich und durch sich hervorbringt.","The full, warm feeling of my heart for living nature, which overflowed me with so much bliss, which made the world around me a paradise, now becomes an unbearable torment for me, a tormenting spirit that pursues me on all paths . Otherwise, when I surveyed the fertile valley from the rock over the river to those hills and saw everything around me sprout and swell; when I saw those mountains, from foot to top, clothed with tall, dense trees, those valleys in their manifold bends shaded by the loveliest forests, and the gentle river glided between the lisping reeds and reflected the dear clouds that the gentle evening wind swayed across the sky; when I then heard the birds around me enliven the forest, and the millions of swarms of mosquitoes danced courageously in the last red rays of the sun, and their last twitching look freed the buzzing beetle from its grass, and the buzzing and weaving around me brought me to the ground and the moss that wrests its nourishment from my hard rock and the nest that grows down the arid sand hill opened up to me[51] the inner, glowing, sacred life of nature: how I grasped all this in my warm heart , I felt idolized in the overflowing fullness, and the glorious forms of the infinite world moved in my soul, enlivening all. Immense mountains surrounded me, abysses lay before me, and torrents tumbled down, rivers flowed beneath me, and forest and mountains resounded; and I saw them working and creating in one another in the depths of the earth, all the unfathomable forces; and now over the earth and under the sky swarm the families of the many creatures. Everything, everything populated with a thousand forms; and the people then secure themselves together in little houses and settle down and rule over the wide world in their own way! Poor fool! you despise everything because you are so small. The spirit of the Eternal Creator blows from the inaccessible mountains, through the desert where no foot has trodden, to the end of the unknown ocean, and rejoices in every dust that hears it and lives. Ah, then, how often have I longed, with the wings of a crane that flew over me, to the shore of the immeasurable sea, to drink that swelling bliss of life from the foaming cup of the infinite, and to be one for just a moment in the limited strength of my bosom To feel drops of the bliss of the being that produces everything within and through itself.","My full, warm enjoyment of all living things that used to overwhelm me with so much delight and transform the world around me into a paradise has been turned into unbearable torment, a demon who pursues me wherever I go. When I used to look at the far-off hills across the river from the crags that give me a full view of the fruitful valley below and saw all things burgeoning around me: the mountains opposite, overgrown with thick, tall trees; the valleys winding in the shade of the loveliest forests; the river flowing gently between whispering reeds, mirroring the pretty clouds moving slowly across the horizon in the light evening breeze; when I heard the birds around me bringing the woods to life with their song and saw millions of little gnats swarming in the sun’s red light; saw how its last tremulous rays brought the humming beetles up out of the grass; and all this whirring and buzzing around me made me more aware suddenly of the ground beneath my feet, of the moss wresting its nourishment out of the hard rock, of the brush flourishing on arid, sandy slopes, revealing the innermost, glowing, sacred life of nature itself —how warmly I used to be able to embrace all this and feel like a god in its abundance! How the magnificent creatures of this infinite world came to life in my soul! I was surrounded by titanic mountains, abysses lay at my feet, waterfalls tumbled down steep slopes, rivers flowed beneath me, and forest and mountain resounded with it all. And I could see unfathomable powers working and creating in the bowels of the earth, generations of divers creatures milling around above the ground, beneath the sky—all of it taking a thousand different shapes—and the human beings seeking protection in their little houses, settling down together and, in their way, ruling over this wide world. He is a poor fool who has so little respect for all this because he is so small! From the forbidding mountain range, across the barren plain untrodden by the foot of man, to the ends of the unknown seas, the spirit of the Eternal Creator can be felt rejoicing over every grain of dust that comprehends Him and lives! Oh, how often I used to yearn in those days to fly with the wings of the crane above me to the shores of the limitless seas and drink the surging joy of life from the foaming cup of eternity and feel, with the restricted powers of my breast, one single drop of the bliss of Him who created all this.","The full and ardent sentiment which animated my heart with the love of nature, overwhelming me with a torrent of delight, and which brought all paradise before me, has now become an insupportable torment, a demon which perpetually pursues and harasses me.   When in bygone days I gazed from these rocks upon yonder mountains across the river, and upon the green, flowery valley before me, and saw alI nature budding and bursting around; the hills clothed from foot to peak with tall, thick forest trees; the valleys in all their varied windings, shaded with the loveliest woods; and the soft river gliding along amongst the lisping reeds, mirroring the beautiful clouds which the soft evening breeze wafted across the sky, -- when I heard the groves about me melodious with the music of birds, and saw the million swarms of insects dancing in the last golden beams of the sun, whose setting rays awoke the humming beetles from their grassy beds, whilst the subdued tumult around directed my attention to the ground, and I there observed the arid rock compelled to yield nutriment to the dry moss, whilst the heath flourished upon the barren sands below me, all this displayed to me the inner warmth which animates all nature, and filled and glowed within my heart.   I felt myself exalted by this overflowing fulness to the perception of the Godhead, and the glorious forms of an infinite universe became visible to my soul!   Stupendous mountains encompassed me, abysses yawned at my feet, and cataracts fell headlong down before me; impetuous rivers rolled through the plain, and rocks and mountains resounded from afar.   In the depths of the earth I saw innumerable powers in motion, and multiplying to infinity; whilst upon its surface, and beneath the heavens, there teemed ten thousand varieties of living creatures.   Everything around is alive with an infinite number of forms; while mankind fly for security to their petty houses, from the shelter of which they rule in their imaginations over the wide-extended universe.   Poor fool! in whose petty estimation all things are little.   From the inaccessible mountains, across the desert which no mortal foot has trod, far as the confines of the unknown ocean, breathes the spirit of the eternal Creator; and every atom to which he has given existence finds favour in his sight.   Ah, how often at that time has the flight of a bird, soaring above my head, inspired me with the desire of being transported to the shores of the immeasurable waters, there to quaff the pleasures of life from the foaming goblet of the Infinite, and to partake, if but for a moment even, with the confined powers of my soul, the beatitude of that Creator who accomplishes all things in himself, and through himself!"

"Gewiß, Albert ist der beste Mensch unter dem Himmel. Ich habe gestern eine wunderbare Szene mit ihm gehabt. Ich kam zu ihm, um Abschied von ihm zu nehmen; denn mich wandelte die Lust an, ins Gebirge zu reiten, von woher ich dir auch jetzt schreibe, und wie ich in der Stube auf und ab gehe, fallen mir seine Pistolen in die Augen. – »Borge mir die Pistolen«, sagte ich, »zu meiner Reise.« – »Meinetwegen«, sagte er, »wenn du dir die Mühe nehmen willst, sie zu laden; bei mir hängen sie nur pro forma.« – Ich nahm eine herunter, und er fuhr fort: »Seit mir meine Vorsicht einen so unartigen Streich gespielt hat, mag ich mit dem Zeuge nichts mehr zu tun haben.« – Ich war neugierig, die Geschichte zu wissen. – »Ich hielt mich«, erzählte er, »wohl ein Vierteljahr auf dem Lande bei einem Freunde auf, hatte ein paar Terzerolen ungeladen und schlief ruhig. Einmal an einem regnichten Nachmittage, da ich müßig sitze, weiß ich nicht, wie mir einfällt: wir könnten überfallen werden, wir könnten die Terzerolen nötig haben und könnten – du weißt ja, wie das ist. – Ich gab sie dem Bedienten, sie zu putzen und zu laden; und der dahlt mit den Mädchen, will sie erschrecken, und Gott weiß wie, das Gewehr geht los, da der Ladstock noch drin steckt, und schießt den Ladstock einem Mädchen zur Maus herein an der rechten Hand und zerschlägt ihr den Daumen. Da hatte ich das Lamentieren, und die Kur zu bezahlen obendrein, und seit der Zeit lass' ich alles Gewehr ungeladen. Lieber Schatz, was ist Vorsicht? die Gefahr läßt sich nicht auslernen! Zwar ...« – Nun weißt du, daß ich den Menschen sehr lieb habe bis auf seine Zwar; denn versteht sich's nicht von selbst, daß jeder allgemeine Satz Ausnahmen leidet? Aber so rechtfertig ist der Mensch! wenn er glaubt, etwas Übereiltes, Allgemeines,[45] Halbwahres gesagt zu haben, so hört er dir nicht auf zu limitieren, zu modifizieren und ab – und zuzutun, bis zuletzt gar nichts mehr an der Sache ist. Und bei diesem Anlaß kam er sehr tief in Text: ich hörte endlich gar nicht weiter auf ihn, verfiel in Grillen, und mit einer auffahrenden Gebärde drückte ich mir die Mündung der Pistole übers rechte Aug' an die Stirn. – »Pfui!« sagte Albert, indem er mir die Pistole herabzog, »was soll das?« – »Sie ist nicht geladen.« sagte ich. – »Und auch so, was soll's?« versetzte er ungeduldig. »Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, wie ein Mensch so töricht sein kann, sich zu erschießen; der bloße Gedanke erregt mir Widerwillen.«","Certainly, Albert is the best man under heaven. I had a wonderful scene with him yesterday. I came to say goodbye to him; for I was overcome by the desire to ride into the mountains, from where I am writing to you now, and as I pace up and down the room, his pistols catch my eye. - ""Borrow me the pistols,"" I said, ""for my trip."" - ""All right,"" he said, ""if you want to take the trouble to load them; I only hang them pro forma.” I took one down and he continued: “Since my caution played such a naughty trick on me, I don't want to have anything to do with the witness.” I was curious, the to know history. ""I stayed,"" he said, ""in the country with a friend for about a quarter of a year, had a couple of Terzeroles uncharged and slept peacefully. One rainy afternoon, sitting idly, I don't know how it occurs to me: we might be attacked, we might need the Tercerols, and we might - you know how it is. – I gave them to the servant to clean and load; and he dabbles with the girls, wants to frighten them, and God knows how, the rifle goes off with the ramrod still in it, and shoots the ramrod into a girl's mouse on the right hand and smashes her thumb. Then I had to lament, and pay for the cure on top of that, and since then I've left my rifle unloaded. Dear darling, what is caution? the danger can not be learned! Admittedly...« – Now you know that I love the person very much, except for his adversity; for does it not go without saying that every general proposition suffers from exceptions? But man is so justified! if he thinks he has said something hasty, general,[45] half-true, he will not stop limiting, modifying, and occasionally helping you, until in the end nothing matters at all. And on this occasion he got very deep into the text: I finally stopped listening to him, broke into a panic, and with a startled gesture I pressed the muzzle of the pistol over my right eye to my forehead. - ""Ugh,"" said Albert, pulling my pistol down, ""what's that about?"" - ""It's not loaded,"" I said. ""And even so, what's the point?"" he replied impatiently. 'I can't imagine how a man could be so foolish as to shoot himself; the mere thought disgusts me.”","Albert is the best man on earth…agreed! Yesterday I had a strange experience with him. I went to see him, to bid him farewell, for it had occurred to me that a ride up into the mountains (I am writing to you from there now) was just what I wanted to do. As I was pacing up and down his room, I happened to see his pistols. “Lend me your pistols for the trip,” I said. “By all means,” he replied, “if you want to take the trouble to load them. I only have them hanging around here pro forma.” As I took one down, he went on: “Since my sense of caution played me such a nasty trick, I don’t want to have anything more to do with them.” I was anxious to hear the story. “I was in the country, staying with a friend for about three months,” he said. “I had a brace of pistols with me, unloaded, and slept peacefully. On a rainy afternoon I was sitting there with nothing much to do and, I don’t know why, but it occurred to me that we could be attacked; we might need the pistols and could—you know how it is. I gave them to a servant to clean and load. He fooled around with the girls, wanted to frighten them…. God knows how it happened, but the gun went off with the ramrod still in the barrel and shot the ramrod into the thumb of one of the girls, smashing it. And I had to listen to all the lamentations and pay the surgeon’s bill. Since then I leave the pistols unloaded. My dear fellow, what is precaution? We can never learn all there is to know about danger. To be sure…” Now, you know that I love this man very much, except for his “to be sure,” for isn’t it obvious that every generalization admits of exceptions? But this fellow is full of such self-justification. When he thinks he has said something too hastily, or spoken a half-truth, or generalized too much, then you can’t stop him from attaching limitations to what he has said, from modifying it, adding to it and subtracting from it, until at last nothing is left of the original idea! In the end, Albert became so involved in what he was saying that I stopped listening and was soon lost in my own thoughts. Suddenly, with a rough, abrupt gesture, I pressed the mouth of the pistol against my forehead, just above the right eye. “Shame on you!” Albert said, as he forced my hand down. “What on earth is the meaning of this?” “It isn’t loaded,” I said. “Even so…what was going on in your mind?” He sounded impatient. “I simply cannot imagine how a man could be so foolish as to shoot himself. The very idea disgusts me.”","Certainly Albert is the best fellow in the world.   I had a strange scene with him yesterday.   I went to take leave of him; for I took it into my head to spend a few days in these mountains, from where I now write to you.   As I was walking up and down his room, my eye fell upon his pistols. "" Lend me those pistols,"" said I, ""for my journey. ""   ""By all means,"" he replied, ""if you will take the trouble to load them; for they only hang there for form.""   I took down one of them; and he continued, ""Ever since I was near suffering for my extreme caution, I will have nothing to do with such things.""   I was curious to hear the story.   ""I was staying,"" said he, ""some three months ago, at a friend's house in the country. I had a brace of pistols with me, unloaded; and I slept without any anxiety.   One rainy afternoon I was sitting by myself, doing nothing, when it occurred to me I do not know how that the house might be attacked, that we might require the pistols, that we might in short, you know how we go on fancying, when we have nothing better to do.   I gave the pistols to the servant, to clean and load.   He was playing with the maid, and trying to frighten her, when the pistol went off -- God knows how! -- the ramrod was in the barrel; and it went straight through her right hand, and shattered the thumb.   I had to endure all the lamentation, and to pay the surgeon's bill; so, since that time, I have kept all my weapons unloaded.   But, my dear friend, what is the use of prudence? We can never be on our guard against all possible dangers.   However,"" -- now, you must know I can tolerate all men till they come to ""however;"" -- for it is self-evident that every universal rule must have its exceptions.   But he is so exceedingly accurate , that, if he only fancies he has said a word too precipitate, or too general, or only half true, he never ceases to qualify, to modify, and extenuate, till at last he appears to have said nothing at all.   Upon this occasion, Albert was deeply immersed in his subject: I ceased to listen to him, and became lost in reverie. With a sudden motion, I pointed the mouth of the pistol to my forehead, over the right eye.   ""What do vou mean? "" cried Albert, turning back the pistol.   ""It is not loaded,"" said I.   ""And even if not,"" he answered with impatience,  ""what can you mean? I cannot cornprehend how a man can be so mad as to shoot himself, and the bare idea of it shocks me."""
"Es ist Nacht! – Ich bin allein, verloren auf dem stürmischen Hügel. Der Wind saust im Gebirge. Der Strom heult[108] den Felsen hinab. Keine Hütte schützt mich vor Regen, mich Verlaßne auf dem stürmischen Hügel.","It's night! – I am alone, lost on the stormy hill. The wind whistles in the mountains. The stream howls[108] down the rock. No hut protects me from the rain, leave me on the stormy hill.",“COLMA: ‘Night has fallen. I am alone and lost on the storm-swept hill. The wind howls down the canyon; no hut protects me from the rain. I have been abandoned on this stormy hill.,"It is night: I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms. The wind is heard on the mountain.   The torrent is howling down the rock.   No hut receives me from the rain: forlorn on the hill of winds!"

"»Warum weckst du mich, Frühlingsluft? Du buhlst und sprichst: Ich betaue mit Tropfen des Himmels! Aber die Zeit meines Welkens ist nahe, nahe der Sturm, der meine Blätter herabstört! Morgen wird der Wanderer kommen, kommen der mich sah in meiner Schönheit, ringsum wird sein Auge im Felde mich suchen und wird mich nicht finden. –«[114]","""Why are you waking me up, spring air? You woo and say: I dew with drops of heaven! But the time of my withering is near, near is the storm that will tear down my leaves! Tomorrow the wanderer will come, come who saw me in my beauty, his eyes will look for me in the fields all around and will not find me. –«[114]","He took up the papers again and began to read in a broken voice, “Why dost thou awaken me, O zephyr of spring? Thou dost speak of love, saying, ‘I spread the dew with drops from heaven.’ But the time of my fading away is nigh; nigh is the storm that will defoliate me. And in the morn the wanderer will come; the wanderer will come who saw me in my glory. His eyes will seek me in the field but he will not find me….” The full force of the words rained down upon the unfortunate man.","""Why dost thou waken me, O spring?   Thy voice woos me, exclaiming, I refresh thee with heavenly dews; but the time of my decay is approaching, the storm is nigh that shall whither my leaves. Tomorrow the traveller shall come, he shall come, who beheld me in beauty: his eye shall seek me in the field around, but he shall not find me."" The whole force of these words fell upon the unfortunate Werther."

"Wer auf seinem Stabe ist das? Wer ist es, dessen Haupt weiß ist vor Alter, dessen Augen rot sind von Tränen? Es ist dein Vater, o Morar, der Vater keines Sohnes außer dir. Er hörte von deinem Ruf in der Schlacht, er hörte von zerstobenen Feinden; er hörte Morars Ruhm! Ach! nichts von[111] seiner Wunde? Weine, Vater Morars, weine! Aber dein Sohn hört dich nicht. Tief ist der Schlaf der Toten, niedrig ihr Kissen von Staube. Nimmer achtet er auf die Stimme, nie erwacht er auf deinen Ruf. O wann wird es Morgen im Grabe, zu bieten dem Schlummerer: Erwache!","Who on his staff is that? Who is it whose head is white with age, whose eyes are red with tears? It is your father, O Morar, the father of no son but you. He heard of your call in battle, he heard of foes scattered; he heard Morar's glory! Oh! nothing of[111] his wound? Weep, Father Morar, weep! But your son doesn't hear you. Deep is the sleep of the dead, low is their pillow of dust. He never pays attention to your voice, he never wakes up to your call.

It is thy father, Morar. Thou wert his only son. He knows all about thy fame in battle, about the enemy thou didst scatter; he has heard of Morar’s fame—alas, not of his wound! Weep, father of Morar, weep! But thy son cannot hear thee. The sleep of the dead is deep, and lowly is their pillow of dust. He pays no heed to thy voice; he will ne’er awaken to thy call. Oh, when will it be morning in his grave; when will it be time to bid the slumberer awaken?","""Who on his staff is this?   Who is this whose head is white with age, whose eyes are red with tears, who quakes at every step?   It is thy father, O Morar! the father of no son but thee.   He heard of thy fame in war, he heard of foes dispersed.   He heard of Morar's renown, why did he not hear of his wound?   Weep, thou father of Morar!   Weep, but thy son heareth thee not.   Deep is the sleep of the dead, low their pillow of dust.   No more shall he hear thy voice, no more awake at thy call.   When shall it be morn in the grave, to bid the slumberer awake?  "
"Und da man nun heute gar, wo ich hintrete, mich bedauert, da ich höre, daß meine Neider nun triumphieren und sagen: da sähe man's, wo es mit den Übermütigen hinausginge, die sich ihres bißchen Kopfs überhöben und glaubten, sich darum über alle Verhältnisse hinaussetzen zu dürfen, und was des Hundegeschwätzes mehr ist – da möchte man sich ein Messer ins Herz bohren; denn man rede von Selbständigkeit was man will, den will ich sehen, der dulden kann, daß Schurken über ihn reden, wenn sie einen Vorteil über ihn haben; wenn ihr Geschwätze leer ist, ach da kann man sie leicht lassen.","And since today, wherever I step, people feel sorry for me, because I hear that my envious people are now triumphant and say: Here you can see where the high-spirited, who lifted their little head and believed that they were above everyone, were going To be allowed to put things outside, and what is more of the dog's chatter - one would like to pierce one's heart with a knife; for one speaks of independence what one likes, I want to see him who can tolerate that scoundrels talk about him when they have an advantage over him; when their chatter is empty, oh, one can easily leave them there.","And now, since everyone commiserates with me wherever I go and I am told that those who used to envy me are triumphing and saying, “There you can see how the presumptuous end, those who try to lift their insignificant heads too high and think they can go where they please and do as they like….” I could run a knife into my heart! Because people can say what they like about being independent—show me the man who can stand being raked over the coals by scoundrels when they have the advantage over him. When their talk is idle nonsense, ah, then it can be easily ignored.","And now I could plunge a dagger into my bosom, when I hear myself everywhere pitied, and observe the triumph of my enemies, who say that this is always the case with vain persons, whose heads are turned with conceit, who affect to despise forms and such petty, idle nonsense. Say what you will of fortitude, but show me the man who can patiently endure the laughter of fools, when they have obtained an advantage over him.   'Tis only when their nonsense is without foundation that one can suffer it without complaint."

"Weil es ein gelinder Abend war und das Wetter anfing, sich zum Tauen zu neigen, ging Lotte mit Alberten zu Fuße zurück. Unterwegs sah sie sich hier und da um, eben als wenn sie Werthers Begleitung vermißte. Albert fing von ihm an zu reden, er tadelte ihn, indem er ihm Gerechtigkeit widerfahren ließ. Er berührte seine unglückliche Leidenschaft und wünschte, daß es möglich sein möchte, ihn zu entfernen. – »Ich wünsch' es auch um unsertwillen«, sagt' er, »und ich bitte dich«, fuhr er fort, »siehe zu, seinem Betragen gegen dich eine andere Richtung zu geben, seine öftern Besuche zu vermindern. Die Leute werden aufmerksam, und ich weiß, daß man hier und da drüber gesprochen hat.« – Lotte schwieg, und Albert schien ihr Schweigen empfunden zu haben, wenigstens seit der Zeit erwähnte er Werthers nicht mehr gegen sie, und wenn sie seiner erwähnte, ließ er das Gespräch fallen oder lenkte es woanders hin.[97]","Because it was a mild evening and the weather was beginning to thaw, Lotte walked back with Alberta. On the way she looked around here and there, just as if she missed Werther's company. Albert started talking about him, he rebuked him by doing him justice. He touched his unfortunate passion and wished that it might be possible to remove it. ""I wish it for our own sake too,"" he said, ""and I beg you,"" he continued, ""see to change his behavior towards you, to reduce his frequent visits. People are paying attention, and I know that it was talked about here and there.” Lotte was silent and Albert seemed to have felt her silence, at least since that time he no longer mentioned Werthers against her, and when she mentioned his, did he drop the conversation or direct it elsewhere.[97]","Since it was a mild evening and a thaw had set in, Lotte and Albert walked home. On the way, she looked about her every now and then as if she missed Werther’s company. Albert began to talk about Werther reprovingly, accusing him of being unjust. He touched upon the young man’s passionate nature and said he wished Werther would go away. “I wish it for our sakes as well,” he said, “and I beg you, try to guide his attitude toward you into other channels. See to it that he visits us less often. People are beginning to notice, and I know that there has been talk about it.” Lotte was silent, and Albert seemed to feel her silence. At any rate, from then on, he never spoke of Werther in her presence, and if she mentioned him, he stopped talking or directed the conversation onto other topics.","One fine evening in winter, when the weather seemed inclined to thaw, Charlotte and Albert were returning home together.   The former looked from time to time about her, as if she missed Werther's company.   Albert began to speak of him, and censured him for his prejudices.   He alluded to his unfortunate attachment, and wished it were possible to discontinue his acquaintance. ""I desire it on our own account,"" he added; ""and I request you will compel him to alter his deportment toward you, and to visit you less frequently. The world is censorious, and I know that here and there we are spoken of.""   Charlotte made no reply, and Albert seemed to feel her silence.   At least, from that time he never again spoke of Werther; and, when she introduced the subject, he allowed the conversation to die away, or else he directed the discourse into another channel."
"Dagegen, wenn wir mit all unserer Schwachheit und Mühseligkeit nur gerade fortarbeiten, so finden wir gar oft, daß wir mit unserem Schlendern und Lavieren es weiter bringen als andere mit ihrem Segeln und Rudern – und – das ist doch ein wahres Gefühl seiner selbst, wenn man andern gleich oder gar vorläuft.","On the other hand, if we just keep working with all our weakness and toil, we often find that we get further with our strolling and maneuvering than others with their sailing and rowing - and - that's a true feeling of oneself when you are equal or even ahead of others.","If, on the other hand, we can make up our minds to go about our daily tasks, resigned to our failings and hardships, we often find that, in spite of our meanderings and procrastination, we have gone farther than quite a few others have gone with their sails unfurled and steering gear functioning. And, truly, it is a wonderful feeling when one manages somehow to keep up with one’s fellow men, or better still, outpaces them.","But when, in spite of weakness and disappointments, we set to work in earnest, and persevere steadily, we often find, that, though obliged continually to tack, we make more way than others who have the assistance of wind and tide; and, in truth, there can be no greater satisfaction than to keep pace with others or outstrip them in the race."
"Was mich am meisten neckt, sind die fatalen bürgerlichen Verhältnisse. Zwar weiß ich so gut als einer, wie nötig der Unterschied der Stände ist, wie viel Vorteile er mir selbst verschafft: nur soll er mir nicht eben gerade im Wege stehen, wo ich noch ein wenig Freude, einen Schimmer von Glück auf dieser Erde genießen könnte. Ich lernte neulich auf dem Spaziergange ein Fräulein von B.. kennen, ein liebenswürdiges Geschöpf, das sehr viele Natur mitten in dem steifen Leben erhalten hat. Wir gefielen uns in unserem Gespräche, und da wir schieden, bat ich sie um Erlaubnis, sie bei sich sehen zu dürfen. Sie gestattete mir das mit so vieler Freimütigkeit, daß ich den schicklichen Augenblick kaum erwarten konnte, zu ihr zu gehen. Sie ist nicht von hier und wohnt bei einer Tante im Hause. Die Physiognomie der Alten gefiel mir nicht. Ich bezeigte ihr viel Aufmerksamkeit, mein Gespräch war meist an sie gewandt, und in minder als einer halben Stunde hatte ich so ziemlich weg, was mir das Fräulein nachher selbst gestand: daß die liebe Tante in ihrem Alter Mangel von allem, kein anständiges Vermögen, keinen Geist und keine Stütze hat als die Reihe ihrer Vorfahren, keinen Schirm als den Stand, in den sie sich verpalisadiert, und kein Ergetzen, als von ihrem Stockwerk herab über die bürgerlichen Häupter wegzusehen. In ihrer Jugend soll sie schön gewesen sein und ihr Leben weggegaukelt, erst mit ihrem Eigensinne manchen armen[63] Jungen gequält, und in den reifern Jahren sich unter den Gehorsam eines alten Offiziers geduckt haben, der gegen diesen Preis und einen leidlichen Unterhalt das eherne Jahrhundert mit ihr zubrachte und starb. Nun sieht sie im eisernen sich allein und würde nicht angesehn, wär' ihre Nichte nicht so liebenswürdig.","What teases me the most are the fatal middle-class conditions. It is true that I know as well as one how necessary the difference in status is, how many advantages it creates for me: only it should not stand in my way when I still enjoy a little joy, a glimmer of happiness on this earth could. On a recent walk, I met a Miss von B.., a lovely creature who has preserved a great deal of nature in the midst of her stiff life. We liked our conversation, and as we were separating, I asked permission to see her at her house. She permitted me to do so with such frankness that I could hardly wait for the opportune moment to go to her. She is not from here and lives with an aunt in the house. I didn't like the physiognomy of the old people. I showed her a lot of attention, my conversation was mostly aimed at her, and in less than half an hour I pretty much got what the young lady later confessed to me: that my dear aunt, at her age, lacked everything, had no decent fortune, has no spirit and no support but the ranks of her ancestors, no umbrella but the rank in which she palisaded herself, and no delight but to look down from her storey over the bourgeois heads. In her youth she is said to have been beautiful and feigned her life, first tormenting many a poor boy with her stubbornness, and in her mature years she crouched under the obedience of an old officer, who, in return for this price and a tolerable subsistence, did the iron century with her and died. Now she sees herself alone in the iron and would not be looked at if her niece were not so lovely.","What irritates me most are the deplorable social conditions. I know as well as anyone else how necessary it is that there be differences in rank, and how much this is to my advantage. All I ask is that it should not stand in my way when there is a small chance of my enjoying myself, or a glimmer of hope that I may still know happiness on this earth. A few days ago, while I was out walking, I made the acquaintance of a Fräulein von B., a charming creature who has somehow managed to remain natural in spite of the formalities of life here. We enjoyed our conversation, and when we parted I asked for permission to call on her. She said that I might so unreservedly that I could scarcely wait for the proper time to elapse until I could visit her. She is not from these parts and lives with an aunt. I did not like the looks of the old lady. I paid her a great deal of attention; almost everything I said was directed at her. But in little less than half an hour I realized what the young lady admitted later—that her dear aunt, with nothing but an inadequate fortune at her disposal and even less intellect, finds sustenance solely in her lineage and security only behind the ramparts of her rank, which is her castle, and takes pleasure in nothing but looking down her nose at the lower classes. In her youth she was beautiful and frittered her life away, at first by making many a young man miserable with her capriciousness; later, in her maturer years, she was completely under the thumb of an old army officer who, in return for having married her and a tolerable maintenance, was her companion in her bronze age, and died. Now, in her iron age, she finds herself alone and no one would pay her any heed if her niece were not so kind.","What provokes me most is the unhappy extent to which distinctions of rank are carried.   I know perfectly well how necessary are inequalities of condition, and I am sensible of the advantages I myself derive therefrom; but I would not have these institutions prove a barrier to the small chance of happiness which I may enjoy on this earth. I have lately become acquainted with a Miss B--, a very agreeable girl, who has retained her natural manners in the midst of artificial life.   Our first conversation pleased us both equally; and, at taking leave, I requested permission to visit her.   She consented in so obliging a manner, that I waited with impatience for the arrival of the happy moment.   She is not a native of this place, but resides here with her aunt.   The countenance of the old lady is not prepossessing.   I paid her much attention, addressing the greater part of my conversation to her; and, in less than half an hour, I discovered what her niece subsequently acknowledged to me, that her aged aunt, having but a small fortune, and a still smaller share of understanding, enjoys no satisfaction except in the pedigree of her ancestors, no protection save in her noble birth, and no enjoyment but in looking from her castle over the heads of the humble citizens.   She was, no doubt, handsome in her youth, and in her early years probably trifled away her time in rendering many a poor youth the sport of her caprice: in her riper years she has submitted to the yoke of a veteran officer, who, in return for her person and her small independence, has spent with her what we may designate her age of brass.   He is dead; and she is now a widow, and deserted.   She spends her iron age alone, and would not be approached, except for the loveliness of her niece."
"Ja, es ist so. Wie die Natur sich zum Herbste neigt, wird es Herbst in mir und um mich her. Meine Blätter werden[76] gelb, und schon sind die Blätter der benachbarten Bäume abgefallen. Hab' ich dir nicht einmal von einem Bauerburschen geschrieben, gleich da ich herkam? Jetzt erkundigte ich mich wieder nach ihm in Wahlheim; es hieß, er sei aus dem Dienste gejagt worden, und niemand wollte was weiter von ihm wissen. Gestern traf ich ihn von ungefähr auf dem Wege nach einem andern Dorfe, ich redete ihn an, und er erzählte mir seine Geschichte, die mich doppelt und dreifach gerührt hat, wie du leicht begreifen wirst, wenn ich dir sie wiedererzähle. Doch wozu das alles? warum behalt' ich nicht für mich, was mich ängstigt und kränkt? warum betrüb' ich noch dich? warum geb' ich dir immer Gelegenheit, mich zu bedauern und mich zu schelten? Sei's denn, auch das mag zu meinem Schicksal gehören!","Yes it is. As nature tends towards autumn, so will autumn in me and around me. My leaves are turning yellow, and already the leaves of the neighboring trees have fallen off. Didn't I once write to you about a peasant boy as soon as I came here? Now I asked about him again in Wahlheim; it was said that he had been thrown out of the service and no one wanted to know anything more about him. I met him yesterday on the way to another village, I spoke to him and he told me his story, which touched me doubly or thrice, as you will easily understand when I tell it to you again. But what is all this for? why don't I keep to myself what frightens and hurts me? why am I still saddening you? why do I always give you opportunities to pity me and scold me? So be it, that too may be part of my destiny!","Yes, I am right. That’s how it is. As all nature tends toward autumn, it becomes autumn within me and all around me. My leaves turn yellow, as the leaves of the nearby trees fall to the ground. Didn’t I write to you, shortly after I came here, about a peasant lad? I enquired about him in Wahlheim the other day and was told that he had been dismissed and nobody seemed to know anything about him. Yesterday I met him quite by chance on his way to another village. I accosted him, and he told me his story, which touched me deeply, as you will readily understand when I repeat it to you. But why do I bother? Why don’t I keep what frightens and hurts me to myself? Why must I sadden you, too? Why do I constantly give you the opportunity to pity and scold me? Very well…that, too, may be a part of my destiny.","It is even so!   As nature puts on her autumn tints it becomes autumn with me and around me.   My leaves are sere and yellow, and the neighbouring trees are divested of their foliage.   Do you remember my writing to you about a peasant boy shortly after my arrival here?   I have just made inquiries about him in Walheim. They say he has been dismissed from his service, and is now avoided by every one.   I met him yesterday on the road, going to a neighbouring village.   I spoke to him, and he told me his story. It interested me exceedingly, as you will easily understand when I repeat it to you.   But why should I trouble you?   Why should I not reserve all my sorrow for myself?   Why should I continue to give you occasion to pity and blame me?   But no matter: this also is part of my destiny."
"Man möchte rasend werden, Wilhelm, daß es Menschen geben soll ohne Sinn und Gefühl an dem wenigen, was auf Erden noch einen Wert hat. Du kennst die Nußbäume, unter denen ich bei dem ehrlichen Pfarrer zu St.. mit Lotten gesessen, die herrlichen Nußbäume, die mich, Gott weiß, immer mit dem größten Seelenvergnügen füllten! Wie vertraulich sie den Pfarrhof machten, wie kühl! und wie herrlich die Äste waren! Und die Erinnerung bis zu den ehrlichen Geistlichen, die sie vor vielen Jahren pflanzten. Der Schulmeister hat uns den einen Namen oft genannt, den er von seinem Großvater gehört hatte; und so ein braver Mann soll er gewesen sein, und sein Andenken war immer heilig unter den Bäumen. Ich sage dir, dem Schulmeister standen die[80] Tränen in den Augen, da wir gestern davon redeten, daß sie abgehauen worden – abgehauen! Ich möchte toll werden, ich könnte den Hund ermorden, der den ersten Hieb dran tat. Ich, der ich mich vertrauern könnte, wenn so ein paar Bäume in meinem Hofe stünden und einer davon stürbe vor Alter ab, ich muß zusehen. Lieber Schatz, eins ist doch dabei: Was Menschengefühl ist! Das ganze Dorf murrt, und ich hoffe, die Frau Pfarrerin soll es an Butter und Eiern und übrigem Zutrauen spüren, was für eine Wunde sie ihrem Orte gegeben hat. Denn sie ist es, die Frau des neuen Pfarrers (unser alter ist auch gestorben), ein hageres, kränkliches Geschöpf, das sehr Ursache hat, an der Welt keinen Anteil zu nehmen, denn niemand nimmt Anteil an ihr. Eine Närrin, die sich abgibt, gelehrt zu sein, sich in die Untersuchung des Kanons meliert, gar viel an der neumodischen, moralisch – kritischen Reformation des Christentumes arbeitet und über Lavaters Schwärmereien die Achseln zuckt, eine ganz zerrüttete Gesundheit hat und deswegen auf Gottes Erdboden keine Freude. So einer Kreatur war es auch allein möglich, meine Nußbäume abzuhauen. Siehst du, ich komme nicht zu mir! Stelle dir vor: die abfallenden Blätter machen ihr den Hof unrein und dumpfig, die Bäume nehmen ihr das Tageslicht, und wenn die Nüsse reif sind, so werfen die Knaben mit Steinen darnach, und das fällt ihr auf die Nerven, das stört sie in ihren tiefen Überlegungen, wenn sie Kennikot, Semler und Michaelis gegen einander abwiegt. Da ich die Leute im Dorfe, besonders die alten, so unzufrieden sah, sagte ich: »Warum habt ihr es gelitten?« – »Wenn der Schulze will, hier zu Lande«, sagten sie, »was kann man machen?« – Aber eins ist recht geschehen. Der Schulze und der Pfarrer, der doch auch von seiner Frauen Grillen, die ihm ohnedies die Suppen nicht fett machen, was haben wollte, dachten es mit einander zu teilen; da erfuhr es die Kammer und sagte: »Hier herein!« Denn sie hatte noch alte Prätensionen an den Teil des Pfarrhofes, wo die Bäume standen, und verkaufte sie an den Meistbietenden. Sie liegen! O, wenn ich Fürst wäre! Ich wollte die Pfarrerin, den Schulzen und die Kammer – Fürst! – Ja wenn ich Fürst wäre, was kümmerten mich die Bäume in meinem Lande![81]","One would like to get mad, Wilhelm, that there should be people who have no meaning or feeling for the little that still has value on earth. You know the nut trees under which I sat with Lotte with the honest pastor in St., the magnificent nut trees which, God knows, always filled me with the greatest joy of soul! How confidential they made the parsonage, how cool! and how glorious were the boughs! And the memory to the honest ministers who planted them many years ago. The schoolmaster often told us the one name he had heard from his grandfather; and such a good man he is said to have been, and his memory was always sacred under the trees. I tell you, the schoolmaster had tears in his eyes because yesterday we talked about her being cut off—cut off! I wanna go mad, I could murder the dog that put the first punch to it. I, who could trust myself if there were a couple of trees in my yard and one of them died of old age, I have to watch. Dear darling, one thing is there: What human feelings are! The whole village is grumbling, and I hope that the pastor's wife will feel it from her butter and eggs and the rest of her confidence what a wound she has inflicted on her village. For it is she, the wife of the new pastor (our old one died too), a gaunt, sickly creature who has very good reason not to care for the world, for no one cares for it. A fool who pretends to be learned, gets mixed up in the investigation of the canon, works a lot on the newfangled, morally critical reformation of Christianity and shrugs her shoulders at Lavater's enthusiasms, has a completely shattered health and is therefore on God's earth no fun. It was also possible for such a creature alone to cut down my nut trees. You see, I can't come to myself! Imagine: the falling leaves make her yard unclean and musty, the trees take away the daylight, and when the nuts are ripe the boys throw stones at them, and that gets on her nerves, it disturbs her deep reflection as she weighs Kennikot, Semler, and Michaelis against each other. Since I saw the people in the village, especially the old ones, so dissatisfied, I said: ""Why did you suffer?"" - ""If the mayor wants to, here in the country,"" they said, ""what can you do?"" - But one thing is right. Schulze and the pastor, who also wanted something from his wives, who anyway didn't make his soup fat, thought of sharing it with each other; Then the chamber found out and said: ""In here!"" For they still had old pretensions to the part of the vicarage where the trees stood, and sold them to the highest bidder. They lay! Oh, if I were a prince! I wanted the pastor, the mayor and the chamber—Prince! – Yes, if I were a prince, what would I care about the trees in my country![81]","It is enough to drive one mad, William! To think that there are people who have no feeling at all for the few things on this earth that are of real value! Do you remember the walnut trees under which I sat with Lotte when we visited the good vicar in St. —? Those magnificent trees that, God knows, always delighted me…how snug they made the rectory courtyard, how cool, and what marvelous branches they had! And the memories that went with them, back to the worthy vicar who had planted them so many years ago. The schoolmaster mentions his name often; he has it from his grandfather. What a good man he was, and his memory was sacred to me always under those trees. Let me tell you, there were tears in the schoolmaster’s eyes yesterday when we spoke about how they had been cut down. Yes, cut down! The very idea drives me crazy! I could murder the dog who drove in the first ax. I, who would grieve if I had a pair of trees like that in my yard and had to see them die of old age…I have to see the thing happen! But, my dear friend, there is another side to it—human reaction. The whole village is grumbling about it, and I hope the vicar’s wife will be made to feel, by a lack of butter and eggs and the dearth of other little friendly gestures, how she has wounded the town. Because it was done on the orders of the new clergyman’s wife (our dear old man died), a gaunt, sickly woman who has every reason not to participate in the life going on around her because it wants no part of her. She is a crazy creature who pretends to be very learned, dabbles in new interpretations of the Scriptures, shrugs off Lavater’s ecstasies, and occupies herself with the moral-critical reformation of Christianity that is currently fashionable. She is thoroughly unhealthy and therefore knows naught of the joys on God’s earth. Only a person like that could have cut down my walnut trees! You can see—I can’t get over it! Just imagine—the falling leaves, she says, messed up her yard and made it dank. The trees took away the light, and when the nuts were ripe, the boys threw stones at them, and that made her nervous! I suppose it disturbed her profound thoughts as she weighed the merits of Kennicott, Semler, and Michaelis. When I saw how upset the villagers were, especially the older ones, I asked, “Why did you let it happen?” “When the bailiff wants anything done,” they said, “what can we do about it?” But I can report on one act of justice: the bailiff and the vicar—who wanted to see some gain from his wife’s whim; they don’t usually fill his larder—thought they would divide the profit of the trees between them. But the chamberlain got wind of it and said, “It goes into our coffers!” According to him, his office holds claim to that part of the parsonage on which the trees stood and will sell them to the highest bidder! There they lie. Oh, if I were prince, I would see to it that vicar’s wife, bailiff, and chamberlain—prince? Ah me, if I were prince, of what concern would the trees on my land be to me?","It makes me wretched, Wilhelm, to think that there should be men incapable of appreciating the few things which possess a real value in life.   You remember the walnut trees at S--, under which I used to sit with Charlotte, during my visits to the worthy old vicar. Those glorious trees, the very sight of which has so often filled my heart with joy, how they adorned and refreshed the parsonage yard, with their wide-extended branches! and how pleasing was our remembrance of the good old pastor, by whose hands they were planted so many years ago: The schoolmaster has frequently mentioned his name.   He had it from his grandfather.   He must have been a most excellent man; and, under the shade of those old trees, his memory was ever venerated by me.   The schoolmaster informed us yesterday, with tears in his eyes, that those trees had been felled. Yes, cut to the ground!   I could, in my wrath, have slain the monster who struck the first stroke.   And I must endure this! -- I, who, if I had had two such trees in my own court, and one had died from old age, should have wept with real affliction.   But there is some comfort left , such a thing is sentiment, the whole village murmurs at the misfortune; and I hope the vicar's wife will soon find, by the cessation of the villagers' presents, how much she has wounded the feelings of the neighborhhood.   It was she who did it, the wife of the present incumbent (our good old man is dead), a tall, sickly creature who is so far right to disregard the world, as the world totally disregards her.   The silly being affects to be learned, pretends to examine the canonical books, lends her aid toward the new-fashioned reformation of Christendom, moral and critical, and shrugs up her shoulders at the mention of Lavater's enthusiasm.   Her health is destroyed, on account of which she is prevented from having any enjoyment here below.   Only such a creature could have cut down my walnut trees! I can never pardon it.   Hear her reasons.   The falling leaves made the court wet and dirty; the branches obstructed the light; boys threw stones at the nuts when they were ripe, and the noise affected her nerves; and disturbed her profound meditations, when she was weighing the diffculties of Kennicot, Semler, and Michaelis. Finding that all the parish, particularly the old people, were displeased, I asked ""why they allowed it?""   ""Ah, sir!"" they replied, ""when the steward orders, what can we poor peasants do?""   But one thing has happened well.   The steward and the vicar (who, for once, thought to reap some advantage from the caprices of his wife) intended to divide the trees between them.   The revenue-office, being informed of it, revived an old claim to the ground where the trees had stood, and sold them to the best bidder.   There they still lie on the ground.   If I were the sovereign, I should know how to deal with them all, vicar, steward, and revenue-office. Sovereign, did I say?   I should, in that case, care little about the trees that grew in the country."
"»Er ißt mir auch aus dem Munde.« sagte sie. – Sie reichte ihm einige Brosamen mit ihren Lippen, aus denen die Freuden unschuldig teilnehmender Liebe in aller Wonne lächelten.","""He eats out of my mouth too,"" she said. - She handed him some crumbs with her lips, from which the joys of innocently sympathetic love smiled happily.","“But he eats out of my mouth too,” she said, and let him take a few crumbs from her lips. She was smiling, radiant with the joy of an innocent love.","""But he eats out of my mouth,"" she continued, and extended her lips to him containing seed; and she smiled with all the charm of a being who has allowed an innocent participation of her love."

"Ich beiße die Zähne auf einander und spotte über mein Elend, und spottete derer doppelt und dreifach, die sagen könnten, ich sollte mich resignieren, und weil es nun einmal[42] nicht anders sein könnte. – Schafft mir diese Strohmänner vom Halse! – Ich laufe in den Wäldern herum, und wenn ich zu Lotten komme, und Albert bei ihr sitzt im Gärtchen unter der Laube, und ich nicht weiter kann, so bin ich ausgelassen närrisch und fange viel Possen, viel verwirrtes Zeug an. – »Um Gottes willen«, sagte mir Lotte heut, »ich bitte Sie, keine Szene wie die von gestern abend! Sie sind fürchterlich, wenn Sie so lustig sind.« – Unter uns, ich passe die Zeit ab, wenn er zu tun hat; wutsch! bin ich drauß, und da ist mir's immer wohl, wenn ich sie allein finde.","I grit my teeth and scoff at my misery, and doubly and thrice scoffed at those who might say that I should resign myself, and that it could not be otherwise. – Get these straw men off my back! - I run around in the woods, and when I come to Lotte and Albert is sitting with her in the little garden under the arbor and I can't go any further, I'm wildly foolish and start a lot of antics, a lot of confused stuff. - ""For God's sake,"" Lotte said to me today, ""please, no scene like the one from yesterday evening! You're dreadful when you're so merry.' Between us, I'm checking the time when he's busy; wow! I'm outside, and I'm always happy when I find her alone.","I grit my teeth and scoff at my misery and would scoff even more if anyone dared tell me to resign myself to the situation because there is nothing to be done about it. Just keep such straw men away from me! I tear through the woods and when I have gone as far as I can and find Lotte sitting beside Albert in the summerhouse in her little garden, I behave like an idiot and indulge in all sorts of absurdities. I don’t even make sense! “For heaven’s sake,” she told me today, “please, I beg of you, no more scenes like the one in the garden last night. You are perfectly horrible when you are trying to be funny.” Just between you and me, I watch out for the times when he is busy and then…whoosh , there I am and when I find her alone I feel perfectly wonderful!","I bite my lips, and feel infinite scorn for those who tell me to be resigned, because there is no help for it.   Let me escape from the yoke of such silly subterfuges!   I ramble through the woods; and when I return to Charlotte, and find Albert sitting by her side in the summer-house in the garden, I am unable to bear it, behave like a fool, and commit a thousand extravagances.   ""For Heaven's sake,"" said Charlotte today, ""let us have no more scenes like those of last night!   You terrify me when you are so violent. "" Between ourselves, I am always away now when he visits her: and I feel delighted when I find her alone."
"Ich war ausgestiegen, und eine Magd, die ans Tor kam, bat uns, einen Augenblick zu verziehen, Mamsell Lottchen würde gleich kommen. Ich ging durch den Hof nach dem wohlgebauten Hause, und da ich die vorliegenden Treppen hinaufgestiegen war und in die Tür trat, fiel mir das reizendste Schauspiel in die Augen, das ich je gesehen habe. In dem Vorsaale wimmelten sechs Kinder von eilf zu zwei Jahren um ein Mädchen von schöner Gestalt, mittlerer Größe, die ein simples weißes Kleid, mit blaßroten Schleifen an Arm und Brust, anhatte. Sie hielt ein schwarzes Brot und schnitt ihren Kleinen rings herum jedem sein Stück nach Proportion ihres Alters und Appetits ab, gab's jedem mit solcher Freundlichkeit, und jedes rief so ungekünstelt sein »Danke!«, indem es mit den kleinen Händchen lange in die Höhe gereicht hatte, ehe es noch abgeschnitten war, und nun mit seinem Abendbrote vergnügt entweder wegsprang, oder nach seinem stillern Charakter gelassen davonging nach dem Hoftore zu, um die Fremden und die Kutsche zu sehen, darin ihre Lotte wegfahren sollte. – »Ich bitte um Vergebung«, sagte sie, »daß ich Sie hereinbemühe und die Frauenzimmer warten lasse. Über dem Anziehen und allerlei Bestellungen fürs Haus in meiner Abwesenheit habe ich vergessen, meinen Kindern ihr Vesperbrot zu geben, und sie wollen von niemanden Brot geschnitten haben als von mir.« – Ich machte ihr ein unbedeutendes Kompliment, meine ganze Seele ruhte auf der Gestalt, dem Tone, dem Betragen, und ich hatte eben Zeit, mich von der Überraschung zu erholen, als sie in die Stube lief, ihre Handschuhe und den Fächer zu holen. Die Kleinen sahen mich in einiger Entfernung so von der Seite an, und ich ging auf das jüngste los, das ein Kind von der glücklichsten Gesichtsbildung war. Es zog sich zurück, als eben Lotte zur Türe herauskam und sagte: »Louis, gib dem Herrn Vetter eine Hand.« – Das tat der Knabe sehr freimütig, und ich konnte[21] mich nicht enthalten, ihn, ungeachtet seines kleinen Rotznäschens, herzlich zu küssen. – »Vetter?« sagte ich, indem ich ihr die Hand reichte, »glauben Sie, daß ich des Glücks wert sei, mit Ihnen verwandt zu sein?« – »O«, sagte sie mit einem leichtfertigen Lächeln, »unsere Vetterschaft ist sehr weitläufig, und es wäre mir leid, wenn Sie der schlimmste drunter sein sollten.« – Im Gehen gab sie Sophien, der ältesten Schwester nach ihr, einem Mädchen von ungefähr eilf Jahren, den Auftrag, wohl auf die Kinder acht zu haben und den Papa zu grüßen, wenn er vom Spazierritte nach Hause käme. Den Kleinen sagte sie, sie sollten ihrer Schwester Sophie folgen, als wenn sie's selber wäre, das denn auch einige ausdrücklich versprachen. Eine kleine, naseweise Blondine aber, von ungefähr sechs Jahren, sagte: »Du bist's doch nicht, Lottchen, wir haben dich doch lieber.« – Die zwei ältesten Knaben waren hinten auf die Kutsche geklettert, und auf mein Vorbitten erlaubte sie ihnen, bis vor den Wald mitzufahren, wenn sie versprächen, sich nicht zu necken und sich recht fest zu halten.","I had got out, and a maid who came to the gate asked us to wait a moment, Mamsell Lottchen would be here shortly. I passed through the yard to the well-built house, and as I had climbed the steps and entered the door, the loveliest spectacle I have ever seen caught my eye. In the antechamber, six children, aged eleven to two, swarmed around a girl of fair build, of medium height, who wore a simple white dress with pale red bows on the arm and breast. She held out a piece of black bread and cut the little ones around to each a piece in proportion to their age and appetite, gave it to each with such kindness, and each called out his ""Thank you!"" so unaffectedly, holding up her little hands for a long time before it was cut off, and now either jumped away happily with his supper, or, according to his quiet character, walked away calmly towards the courtyard gate to see the strangers and the carriage in which her Lotte was to be driving away. ""I beg your pardon,"" she said, ""for bothering you in and making the women wait. Getting dressed and all sorts of orders for the house in my absence, I forgot to give my children their supper, and they don’t want anyone to cut their bread but me.” I paid her an insignificant compliment, my whole soul resting on the figure , the tone, the demeanor, and I just had time to recover from the surprise when she ran into the room to get her gloves and the fan. The little ones looked sideways at me from a distance, and I attacked the youngest, who was a child with the happiest face. It withdrew just as Lotte came out of the door and said: ""Louis, give Mr. Cousin a hand."" The boy did so very frankly, and I couldn't refrain from kissing him, in spite of his little snotty nose. to kiss warmly. ""Cousin?"" I said, giving her my hand, ""do you think I'm lucky enough to be related to you?"" spacious, and I would be sorry if you were to be the worst of them.” As she walked, she gave Sophie, her eldest sister after her, a girl of about eleven, the task of looking after the children and papa to say hello when he came home from a ride. She told the little ones to follow their sister Sophie as if she were herself, which some of them expressly promised. But a cheeky little blonde of about six said: ""It's not you, Lottchen, we prefer you."" The two oldest boys had climbed onto the back of the carriage, and at my request she allowed them until to ride in front of the forest if they promise not to tease each other and to hold on tight.","I had already alighted from the carriage when a servant girl, who had come to the gate, begged us to wait a moment. “Miss Lotte” would be out right away. I walked across the courtyard toward the attractive house, and when I had gone up the steps and through a doorway, I came upon the most charming sight imaginable. Six children, from about eleven to two, were swarming around a very pretty girl of medium height. She had on a simple white dress with pale pink bows on the sleeves and at her breast, and she was holding a loaf of black bread and cutting a slice for every one of her little ones, according to their ages and appetites. She gave each his share with the most enchanting graciousness, and the children cried out their “thank you’s” to her absolutely at their ease, stretching out their little hands for their slice before she had even had a chance to cut it. Then they jumped off happily with their supper or, each according to his nature, walked away quietly in the direction of the courtyard to see the strange persons and the carriage in which their Lotte would soon drive away. “I must apologize,” she said, “that you had to come in for me and that I am keeping the ladies waiting, but dressing, and all the little household duties that had to be attended to before leaving, made me forget to give my children their supper, and they don’t want anyone to give it to them but me.” I said something, a casual compliment, but all the while my whole being was absorbed with the sight of her, the sound of her voice, her behavior. When she ran into her room to fetch her gloves and fan, I barely had time to recover my composure. The little ones eyed me suspiciously with sidelong glances, and kept their distance. I went up to the youngest, the fairest child you could imagine. He drew away from me, but just then Lotte came out of her room and said, “Shake hands with your cousin, Louis,” and the boy did, quite naturally, and I could not resist kissing him heartily in spite of his runny little nose. “Cousin?” I said, holding out my hand to take hers. “Do I merit being a relative?” “Oh,” she said, with a bright smile, “we have so many cousins. It would be sad if you were the worst among them.” As she was leaving, she told Sophie, the next oldest, a girl of about eleven, to take good care of the children and best greetings to her father on his return from his ride. She asked the children to obey their sister, Sophie, just as they would obey her, and a few said they would, but one bright little blond girl of about six declared that it would not be like obeying her and “we should rather have you.” The two oldest boys had climbed up on the box, and when I interceded, were given permission to drive with us as far as the forest if they promised not to tease one another and held on tight.","I alighted; and a maid came to the door, and requested us to wait a moment for her mistress.   I walked across the court to a well-built house, and, ascending the flight of steps in front, opened the door, and saw before me the most charming spectacle I had ever witnessed. Six children, from eleven to two years old, were running about the hall, and surrounding a lady of middle height, with a lovely figure, dressed in a robe of simple white, trimmed with pink ribbons.   She was holding a rye loaf in her hand, and was cutting slices for the little ones all around, in proportion to their age and appetite. She performed her task in a graceful and affectionate manner; each claimant awaiting his turn with outstretched hands, and boisterously shouting his thanks.   Some of them ran away at once, to enjoy their evening meal; whilst others, of a gentler disposition, retired to the courtyard to see the strangers, and to survey the carriage in which their Charlotte was to drive away.   ""Pray forgive me for giving you the trouble to come for me, and for keeping the ladies waiting: but dressing, and arranging some household duties before I leave, had made me forget my children's supper; and they do not like to take it from any one but me. ""   I uttered some indifferent compliment: but my whole soul was absorbed by her air, her voice, her manner; and I had scarcely recovered myself when she ran into her room to fetch her gloves and fan.   The young ones threw inquiring glances at me from a distance; whilst I approached the youngest, a most delicious little creature.   He drew back; and Charlotte, entering at the very moment, said, ""Louis, shake hands with your cousin.""   The little fellow obeyed willingly; and I could not resist giving him a hearty kiss, notwithstanding his rather dirty face.   ""Cousin,"" said I to Charlotte, as I handed her down, ""do you think I deserve the happiness of being related to you?""   She replied, with a ready smile, "" Oh! I have such a number of cousins , that I should be sorry if you were the most undeserving of them."" In taking leave, she desired her next sister, Sophy, a girl about eleven years old, to take great care of the children, and to say good-bye to papa for her when he came home from his ride.   She enjoined to the little ones to obey their sister Sophy as they would herself, upon which some promised that they would; but a little fair-haired girl, about six years old, looked discontented, and said, "" But Sophy is not you, Charlotte; and we like you best. "" The two eldest boys had clambered up the carriage; and, at my request, she permitted them to accompany us a little way through the forest, upon their promising to sit very still, and hold fast."

"Die menschliche Natur«, fuhr ich fort, »hat ihre Grenzen: sie kann Freude, Leid, Schmerzen bis auf einen gewissen Grad ertragen und geht zugrunde, sobald der überstiegen ist. Hier ist also nicht die Frage, ob einer schwach oder stark ist, sondern ob er das Maß seines Leidens ausdauern kann, es mag nun moralisch oder körperlich sein. Und ich finde es ebenso wunderbar zu sagen, der Mensch ist feige, der sich das Leben nimmt, als es ungehörig wäre, den einen Feigen zu nennen, der an einem bösartigen Fieber stirbt.«","Human nature,” I continued, “has its limits: it can endure joy, sorrow, pain up to a certain point, and perishes once that is exceeded. The question here, then, is not whether one is weak or strong, but whether he can endure the measure of his suffering, whether moral or physical. And I find it just as wonderful to say the man who takes his life is a coward as it would be improper to call the man a coward who dies of a malignant fever.”","“Human nature,” I continued, “has its limitations. It can bear joy and suffering, and pain to a certain degree, but perishes when this point is passed. Here there can therefore be no question of whether a man is strong or weak, but of whether he can endure his suffering, be it moral or physical. And I find it just as astonishing to say that a man who takes his own life is a coward, as it would be improper to call a man a coward who dies of a pernicious fever.”","""Human nature,"" I continued, ""has its limits.   It is able to endure a certain degree of joy, sorrow, and pain, but becomes annihilated as soon as this measure is exceeded.   The question, therefore, is, not whether a man is strong or weak, but whether he is able to endure the measure of his sufferings.   The suffering may be moral or physical; and in my opinion it is just as absurd to call a man a coward who destroys himself, as to call a man a coward who dies of a malignant fever."""
"An demselben Tage, als Werther den zuletzt eingeschalteten Brief an seinen Freund geschrieben, es war der Sonntag vor Weihnachten, kam er abends zu Lotten und fand sie allein. Sie beschäftigte sich, einige Spielwerke in Ordnung[101] zu bringen, die sie ihren kleinen Geschwistern zum Christgeschenke zurecht gemacht hatte. Er redete von dem Vergnügen, das die Kleinen haben würden, und von den Zeiten, da einen die unerwartete Öffnung der Tür und die Erscheinung eines aufgeputzten Baumes mit Wachslichtern, Zuckerwerk und Äpfeln in paradiesische Entzückung setzte. – »Sie sollen«, sagte Lotte, indem sie ihre Verlegenheit unter ein liebes Lächeln verbarg, »Sie sollen auch beschert kriegen, wenn Sie recht geschickt sind; ein Wachsstöckchen und noch was.« – »Und was heißen Sie geschickt sein?« rief er aus; »wie soll ich sein? wie kann ich sein? beste Lotte!« – »Donnerstag abend«, sagte sie, »ist Weihnachtsabend, da kommen die Kinder, mein Vater auch, da kriegt jedes das Seinige, da kommen Sie auch – aber nicht eher.« – Werther stutzte. – »Ich bitte Sie«, fuhr sie fort, »es ist nun einmal so, ich bitte Sie um meiner Ruhe willen, es kann nicht, es kann nicht so bleiben.« – Er wendete seine Augen von ihr und ging in der Stube auf und ab und murmelte das »Es kann nicht so bleiben!« zwischen den Zähnen. – Lotte, die den schrecklichen Zustand fühlte, worein ihn diese Worte versetzt hatten, suchte durch allerlei Fragen seine Gedanken abzulenken, aber vergebens. – »Nein, Lotte«, rief er aus, »ich werde Sie nicht wiedersehen!« – »Warum das?« versetzte sie, »Werther, Sie können, Sie müssen uns wiedersehen, nur mäßigen Sie sich. O warum mußten Sie mit dieser Heftigkeit, dieser unbezwinglich haftenden Leidenschaft für alles, was Sie einmal anfassen, geboren werden! Ich bitte Sie«, fuhr sie fort, indem sie ihn bei der Hand nahm, »mäßigen Sie sich! Ihr Geist, Ihre Wissenschaften, Ihre Talente, was bieten die Ihnen für mannigfaltige Ergetzungen dar! Sein Sie ein Mann, wenden Sie diese traurige Anhänglichkeit von einem Geschöpf, das nichts tun kann als Sie bedauern.« – Er knirrte mit den Zähnen und sah sie düster an. – Sie hielt seine Hand. »Nur einen Augenblick ruhigen Sinn, Werther!« sagte sie. »Fühlen Sie nicht, daß Sie sich betriegen, sich mit Willen zugrunde richten! Warum denn mich, Werther? just mich, das Eigentum eines andern? just das? Ich fürchte, ich fürchte, es ist nur die Unmöglichkeit, mich zu besitzen, die Ihnen diesen[102] Wunsch so reizend macht.« – Er zog seine Hand aus der ihrigen, indem er sie mit einem starren, unwilligen Blick ansah. »Weise!« rief er, »sehr weise! hat vielleicht Albert diese Anmerkung gemacht? Politisch! sehr politisch!« – »Es kann sie jeder machen.« versetzte sie drauf. »Und sollte denn in der weiten Welt kein Mädchen sein, das die Wünsche Ihres Herzens erfüllte? Gewinnen Sie's über sich, suchen Sie darnach, und ich schwöre Ihnen, Sie werden sie finden; denn schon lange ängstigt mich, für Sie und uns, die Einschränkung, in die Sie sich diese Zeit her selbst gebannt haben. Gewinnen Sie es über sich, eine Reise wird Sie, muß Sie zerstreuen! Suchen Sie, finden Sie einen werten Gegenstand Ihrer Liebe, und kehren Sie zurück, und lassen Sie uns zusammen die Seligkeit einer wahren Freundschaft genießen.«","On the same day that Werther wrote the last published letter to his friend, it was the Sunday before Christmas, he came to Lotten in the evening and found her alone. She was busy arranging some toys that she had prepared for her little brothers and sisters as Christmas presents. He talked of the pleasures the little ones would have, and of the times when the unexpected opening of the door and the appearance of a decked out tree with wax lights, candy, and apples would set one in paradisiacal delight. ""You should,"" said Lotte, hiding her embarrassment with a sweet smile, ""you should get presents too, if you're quite clever; a wax stick and something else.' - 'And what do you mean being skilful?' he exclaimed; ""how should I be? how can i be Best Lotte!” – “Thursday evening,” she said, “is Christmas Eve, that's when the children come, my father too, then each gets their own, then you come too – but not sooner.” – Werther was taken aback. - ""I beg you,"" she continued, ""it's the way it is, I beg you for the sake of my peace, it can't, it can't stay like this."" - He averted his eyes from her and opened up into the room and off, muttering ""It can't stay like this!"" between his teeth. - Lotte, who felt the terrible state into which these words had put him, tried to distract his thoughts with all sorts of questions, but in vain. ""No, Lotte,"" he exclaimed, ""I won't see you again!"" ""Why is that?"" she replied, ""Werther, you can, you must, see us again, just be moderate. Oh, why did you have to be born with this vehemence, this indomitable passion for everything you touch! I beg you,"" she continued, taking him by the hand, ""moderate yourself! Your mind, your sciences, your talents, what manifold delights they offer you! Be a man, turn this sad attachment away from a creature who can do nothing but pity you.” He gritted his teeth and looked at her somberly. – She held his hand. ""Just a moment of calm, Werther,"" she said. ""Don't feel that you're cheating yourself, destroying yourself with will! Why me, Werther? just me, someone else's property? just that? I'm afraid, I'm afraid, it's only the impossibility of possessing me that makes this wish so appealing to you.' He withdrew his hand from hers, looking at her with a fixed, indignant gaze. ""Wise!"" he cried, ""very wise! maybe Albert made that comment? Politically! very political!” – “Anyone can do it,” she replied. 'And shouldn't there be a girl in the wide world who would grant your heart's desires? Get it over yourself, look for it, and I swear you will find it; because for a long time I have been afraid, for you and for us, of the restrictions that you have banished yourself to this time ago. Get it over yourself, a journey will, must, scatter you! Seek, find a worthy object of your love, and return, and let us enjoy together the bliss of true friendship.”","On the same day on which Werther wrote the letter, just inserted, to his friend—it was the Sunday before Christmas—he visited Lotte in the evening and found her alone. She was busy arranging a few toys she had assembled for her brothers and sisters for Christmas. He spoke about the joy the children would experience and of the days when the unexpected opening of a door and the vision of a decorated Christmas tree with its wax candles, sugar candy, and apples could transport one into paradise. Lotte tried to hide her embarrassment behind a sweet smile. “There will be a present for you, too,” she said, “if you promise to be good. A pretty candle and something else.” “And what do you call good?” he cried. “How can I be good, dearest Lotte?” “Thursday evening,” she said, “is Christmas Eve. The children are coming, and my father, and all of them will receive their presents then. I want you to come, too, but not before.” Werther was stunned. “Please,” she went on, “that is how it is. I beg you, for the sake of my peace of mind, things can’t go on like this. They can’t.” He turned away from her and began to pace up and down the room, muttering to himself under his breath, “Things can’t go on like this.” Lotte, who could feel the dread condition into which her words had thrown him, tried with questions about all sorts of things to distract him, but to no avail. “No, Lotte,” he said, “I shall not see you again.” “But why?” she cried. “Werther…you may—you must come to see us again, only be more moderate. Oh, why did you have to be born with so much vehemence, with this fixed, uncontrollable passion for everything you touch? I implore you,” she went on, taking him by the hand, “practice moderation! Your mind—all your knowledge and talents…think of the happiness they can give you! Be more manly! Divert this tragic devotion from a human creature who can only pity you.” His jaw set hard, he looked at her somberly. She held fast to his hand. “Think calmly, Werther,” she said, “for just one moment. Don’t you see that you are deceiving and ruining yourself on purpose? Why me, Werther? Why me of all people, who belongs to another? Why? I fear…I fear that it is just the impossibility of possessing me that makes your desire for me so fascinating.” He drew his hand out of hers, and stared at her with a benumbed, resentful expression. “Very clever!” he said. “Very clever. Are these perhaps Albert’s words? Very politic, very politic, indeed.” “Anybody could say them,” she interrupted him. “Isn’t it possible that in this whole wide world there might be a girl who could fulfill the desires of your heart? Master yourself and seek her. I swear that you will find her. Oh, I have been anxious for a long time now, for you and for us, because of the limitation you have imposed on yourself. Try to win control over yourself. A journey might distract you. Surely it would. Seek and find a worthy object of your affections and come back and let us enjoy the bliss of true friendship.”","The same day, which was the Sunday before Christmas, after Werther had written the last-mentioned letter to his friend, he came in the evening to Charlotte's house, and found her alone.   She was busy preparing some little gifts for her brothers and sisters, which were to be distributed to them on Christmas Day.   He began talking of the delight of the children, and of that age when the sudden appearance of the Christmas-tree, decorated with fruit and sweetmeats, and lighted up with wax candles, causes such transports of joy.   ""You shall have a gift too, if you behave well,"" said Charlotte, hiding her embarrassment under sweet smile.   ""And what do you call behaving well?   What should I do, what can I do, my dear Charlotte?"" said he.   ""Thursday night,"" she answered, ""is Christmas Eve.   The children are all to be here, and my father too: there is a present for each; do you come likewise, but do not come before that time.""   Werther started.   ""I desire you will not: it must be so,"" she continued.   ""I ask it of you as a favour, for my own peace and tranquillity.   We cannot go on in this manner any longer."" He turned away his face walked hastily up and down the room, muttering indistinctly, ""We cannot go on in this manner any longer!""   Charlotte, seeing the violent agitation into which these words had thrown him, endeavoured to divert his thoughts by different questions, but in vain. "" No, Charlotte!"" he exclaimed; ""I will never see you any more!"" ""And why so?"" she answered. ""We may -- we must see each other again; only let it be with more discretion.   Oh! why were you born with that excessive, that ungovernable passion for everything that is dear to you?""   Then, taking his hand, she said, ""I entreat of you to be more calm: your talents, your understanding, your genius, will furnish you with a thousand resources.   Be a man, and conquer an unhappy attachment toward a creature who can do nothing but pity you.""   He bit his lips, and looked at her with a gloomy countenance. She continued to hold his hand.   ""Grant me but a moment's patience, Werther,"" she said.   ""Do you not see that you are deceiving yourself, that you are seeking your own destruction?   Why must you love me, me only, who belong to another?   I fear, I much fear, that it is only the impossibility of possessing me which makes your desire for me so strong.""   He drew back his hand, whilst he surveyed her with a wild and angry look.   ""'Tis well!"" he exclaimed, ""'tis very well! Did not Albert furnish you with this reflection?   It is profound, a very profound remark. ""   ""A reflection that any one might easily make,"" she answered; ""and is there not a woman in the whole world who is at liberty, and has the power to make you happy?   Conquer yourself: look for such a being, and believe me when I say that you will certainly find her.   I have long felt for you, and for us all: you have confined yourself too long within the limits of too narrow a circle.   Conquer yourself; make an effort: a short journey will be of service to you.   Seek and find an object worthy of your love; then return hither, and let us enjoy together all the happiness of the most perfect friendship."""
"Ossian hat in meinem Herzen den Homer verdrängt. Welch eine Welt, in die der Herrliche mich führt! Zu wandern über die Heide, umsaust vom Sturmwinde, der in dampfenden Nebeln die Geister der Väter im dämmernden Lichte des Mondes hinführt. Zu hören vom Gebirge her, im Gebrülle des Waldstroms, halb verwehtes Ächzen der Geister aus ihren Höhlen, und die Wehklagen des zu Tode sich jammernden Mädchens, um die vier moosbedeckten, grasbewachsenen Steine des Edelgefallnen, ihres Geliebten. Wenn ich ihn dann finde, den wandelnden grauen Barden, der auf der weiten Heide die Fußstapfen seiner Väter sucht und, ach, ihre Grabsteine findet und dann jammernd nach dem lieben Sterne des Abends hinblickt, der sich ins rollende Meer verbirgt, und die Zeiten der Vergangenheit in des Helden Seele lebendig werden, da noch der freundliche Strahl den Gefahren der Tapferen leuchtete und der Mond ihr bekränztes, siegrückkehrendes Schiff beschien. Wenn ich den tiefen Kummer auf seiner Stirn lese, den letzten verlassenen Herrlichen in aller Ermattung dem Grabe zuwanken sehe, wie er immer neue, schmerzlich glühende Freuden in der kraftlosen Gegenwart der Schatten seiner Abgeschiedenen einsaugt und nach der kalten Erde, dem hohen, wehenden Grase niedersieht und ausruft: »Der Wanderer wird kommen, kommen, der mich kannte in meiner Schönheit, und fragen: ›Wo ist der Sänger, Fingals trefflicher Sohn?‹ Sein Fußtritt geht über mein Grab hin, und er fragt vergebens nach mir auf der Erde.« – O Freund! ich möchte gleich einem edlen Waffenträger das Schwert ziehen, meinen Fürsten von der zückenden Qual des langsam absterbenden Lebens auf einmal befreien und dem befreiten Halbgott meine Seele nachsenden.[82]","Ossian has supplanted Homer in my heart. What a world into which the Glorious is leading me! To wander over the heath, swept by the storm winds, which in steaming mists lead the spirits of the fathers in the twilight of the moon. To be heard from the mountains, in the roaring of the forest stream, the half-drift groaning of the spirits from their caves, and the wailing of the damsel wailing to her death, around the four moss-covered, grassy stones of the noble fallen one, her lover. When I then find him, the wandering gray bard, who seeks his fathers' footsteps on the broad heath, and, alas, finds their tombstones, and then looks wailingly at the dear evening star, which hides in the rolling sea, and the times of the come alive in the soul of the hero, when the friendly ray still shone against the dangers of the brave and the moon shone on their wreathed ship returning victorious. When I read the deep sorrow on his forehead, see the last forsaken glorious one staggering in all exhaustion to the grave, how he always draws in new, painfully glowing joys in the powerless presence of the shadows of his departed ones and towards the cold earth, the high, waving grass looking down and crying out, ""The wanderer will come, come who knew me in my beauty, and ask, 'Where is the singer, Fingal's fine son?' His footstep goes over my grave, and he asks in vain for me on the earth ."" – O friend! I would like to draw my sword like a noble armor bearer, suddenly free my prince from the raging torment of slowly dying life and send my soul after the freed demigod.[82]","Ossian has replaced Homer in my heart, and what a world it is into which this divine poet leads me! Oh, to wander across the heath in a blustering windstorm, by the light of a waning moon, as it conjures up the ghosts of our ancestors in clouds of mist! Oh, to hear, above the rushing of a forest stream, the half-fading groans of specters issuing from caves in the hillside, and the keening maiden weeping herself into her grave beside the four moss-clad, grass-o’ergrown stones of her noble, fallen hero—her beloved. When I see him—the roving, hoary bard—seeking the footsteps of his forefathers on the wide moor only to find their gravestones; and he looks up, lamenting, at the gentle star of eve about to sink into the rolling sea and times gone by revive in his heroic soul, times when a friendly light still guided the brave man in his peril, and the moon cast its serene light on his garlanded ship, sailing home victorious…when I can read the profound sorrow on his brow and see this last, forsaken, magnificent one reel exhausted to his grave, still finding a melancholy yet glowing joy in the powerless presence of the shades of his departed ones, and can hear him cry as he looks down upon the cold earth and tall waving grasses, “The wanderer will come, will come, who knew me in my glory and will ask, ‘Where is the bard, oh, where is Fingal’s7 admirable son?’ His footsteps cross my grave and he asks in vain for me on earth!” Ah my friend, then, like a noble armiger, I would like to draw my sword and in a trice free my liege lord from the agonizing torment of a life that is a gradual death and send my own soul after the liberated demigod!","Ossian has superseded Homer in my heart.   To what a world does the illustrious bard carry me!   To wander over pathless wilds, surrounded by impetuous whirlwinds, where, by the feeble light of the moon, we see the spirits of our ancestors; to hear from the mountain-tops, mid the roar of torrents, their plaintive sounds issuing from deep caverns, and the sorrowful lamentations of a maiden who sighs and expires on the mossy tomb of the warrior by whom she was adored.   I meet this bard with silver hair; he wanders in the valley; he seeks the footsteps of his fathers, and, alas! he finds only their tombs.   Then, contemplating the pale moon, as she sinks beneath the waves of the rolling sea, the memory of bygone days strikes the mind of the hero, days when approaching danger invigorated the brave, and the moon shone upon his bark laden with spoils, and returning in triumph.   When I read in his countenance deep sorrow, when I see his dying glory sink exhausted into the grave, as he inhales new and heart-thrilling delight from his approaching union with his beloved, and he casts a look on the cold earth and the tall grass which is so soon to cover him, and then exclaims, ""The traveller will come, -- he will come who has seen my beauty, and he will ask, 'Where is the bard, where is the illustrious son of Fingal?'   He will walk over my tomb, and will seek me in vain!""   Then, O my friend, I could instantly, like a true and noble knight, draw my sword, and deliver my prince from the long and painful languor of a living death, and dismiss my own soul to follow the demigod whom my hand had set free!"
"Es geht mir nicht allein so. Alle Menschen werden in ihren Hoffnungen getäuscht, in ihren Erwartungen betrogen.[75] Ich besuchte mein gutes Weib unter der Linde. Der älteste Junge lief mir entgegen, sein Freudengeschrei führte die Mutter herbei, die sehr niedergeschlagen aussah. Ihr erstes Wort war: »Guter Herr, ach, mein Hans ist mir gestorben!« – Es war der jüngste ihrer Knaben. Ich war stille. – »Und mein Mann«, sagte sie, »ist aus der Schweiz zurück und hat nichts mitgebracht, und ohne gute Leute hätte er sich heraus betteln müssen, er hatte das Fieber unterwegs gekriegt.« – Ich konnte ihr nichts sagen und schenkte dem Kleinen was; sie bat mich, einige Äpfel anzunehmen, das ich tat und den Ort des traurigen Andenkens verließ.","I'm not the only one. All people are deceived in their hopes, deceived in their expectations.[75] I visited my good wife under the linden tree. The eldest boy ran to meet me, his shouts of joy brought his mother over, who looked very dejected. Her first word was: ""Good sir, oh, my Hans has died!"" It was the youngest of her boys. I was silent. - ""And my husband,"" she said, ""is back from Switzerland and hasn't brought anything with him, and without good people he would have had to beg his way out, he got the fever on the way."" - I couldn't say anything to her and gave the little one a present What; she asked me to accept some apples, which I did and left the place of sad remembrance.","I am not the only one thus afflicted. All men suffer disappointments and are deceived in their expectations. I paid the good woman under the linden tree a visit. Her eldest boy ran to meet me. His cry of joy brought out his mother. She looked despondent. Her first words were, “Oh, my dear, good gentleman, my little Hans died.” He was her youngest boy. I was speechless. “And my husband has returned from Switzerland with empty hands,” she went on. “If it had not been for some kind people he would have had to beg his way home. On the way back he was stricken with a fever.” What could I say? I gave her boy something. She asked me to accept a few apples, which I did, and left the sorrowful scene.","I am not alone unfortunate.   All men are disappointed in their hopes, and deceived in their expectations.   I have paid a visit to my good old woman under the lime-trees.   The eldest boy ran out to meet me: his exclamation of joy brought out his mother, but she had a very melancholy look.   Her first word was, ""Alas! dear sir, my little John is dead.""   He was the youngest of her children.   I was silent.   ""And my husband has returned from Switzerland without any money; and, if some kind people had not assisted him, he must have begged his way home.   He was taken ill with fever on his journey. ""   I could answer nothing, but made the little one a present.   She invited me to take some fruit: I complied, and left the place with a sorrowful heart."
"Entweder, sagst du, hast du Hoffnung auf Lotten, oder du hast keine. Gut, im ersten Fall suche sie durchzutreiben, suche die Erfüllung deiner Wünsche zu umfassen: im anderen Fall ermanne dich und suche einer elenden Empfindung los zu werden, die alle deine Kräfte verzehren muß. – Bester! das ist wohl gesagt, und – bald gesagt.","Either, you say, you have hope for Lotten, or you don't.

"Wenn die Stürme des Berges kommen, wenn der Nord die Wellen hochhebt, sitz' ich am schallenden Ufer, schaue nach dem schrecklichen Felsen.

"Das Vertrauen des Grafen von C.. ist noch das einzige, was mich schadlos hält. Er sagte mir letzthin ganz aufrichtig, wie unzufrieden er mit der Langsamkeit und Bedenklichkeit meines Gesandten sei. »Die Leute erschweren es sich und andern. Doch«, sagte er, »man muß sich darein resignieren wie ein Reisender, der über einen Berg muß; freilich, wäre der Berg nicht da, so wäre der Weg viel bequemer und kürzer; er ist nun aber da, und man soll hinüber!« –","The trust of Count von C.. is the only thing that keeps me harmless.

Of course the way would be easier and shorter if the mountain were not there, but the mountain is there and has to be crossed!","My acquaintance with the Count C-- is the only compensation for such an evil.   He told me frankly, the other day, that he was much displeased with the difficulties and delays of the ambassador; that people like him are obstacles, both to themselves and to others.   ""But,"" added he, ""one must submit, like a traveller who has to ascend a mountain: if the mountain was not there, the road would be both shorter and pleasanter; but there it is, and he must get over it."""
"Lotte war indes in einen sonderbaren Zustand geraten. Nach der letzten Unterredung mit Werthern hatte sie empfunden, wie schwer es ihr fallen werde, sich von ihm zu trennen, was er leiden würde, wenn er sich von ihr entfernen sollte.","Meanwhile, Lotte had fallen into a strange state. After the last conversation with Werther she had felt how difficult it would be for her to part with him, what he would suffer if he were to leave her.","Lotte, meanwhile, had fallen into a strange state of mind.

"»Ich werde sie sehen!« ruf' ich morgens aus, wenn ich mich ermuntere und mit aller Heiterkeit der schönen Sonne entgegenblicke; »ich werde sie sehen!« Und da habe ich für den ganzen Tag keinen Wunsch weiter. Alles, alles verschlingt sich in dieser Aussicht.","""I'll see her!"" I exclaim in the morning, when I cheer myself up and look cheerfully at the beautiful sun; ""I'll see her!"" And I have no further wishes for the whole day. Everything, everything is swallowed up in this prospect.","I shall see her today! When I awaken in the morning and look blithely into the sunlight, I cry out, “I shall see her today!” And I don’t have another wish for the next twenty-four hours.

I exclaim with delight, when I rise in the morning, and look out with gladness of heart at the bright, beautiful sun.   ""I shall see her today!""   And then I have no further wish to form: all, all is included in that one thought."
"Ich muß fort! Ich danke dir, Wilhelm, daß du meinen wankenden Entschluß bestimmt hast. Schon vierzehn Tage gehe ich mit dem Gedanken um, sie zu verlassen. Ich muß fort. Sie ist wieder in der Stadt bei einer Freundin. Und Albert – und – ich muß fort!","I have to go! Thank you, Wilhelm, for determining my faltering resolve. I've been thinking about leaving her for a fortnight. I have to go. She's back in town with a friend. And Albert - and - I have to go!","I must leave here.

"Er kramte den Abend noch viel in seinen Papieren, zerriß vieles und warf es in den Ofen, versiegelte einige Päcke mit den Adressen an Wilhelm. Sie enthielten kleine Aufsätze, abgerissene Gedanken, deren ich verschiedene gesehen habe; und nachdem er um zehn Uhr Feuer hatte nachlegen und sich eine Flasche Wein geben lassen, schickte er den Bedienten, dessen Kammer wie auch die Schlafzimmer der Hausleute weit hinten hinaus waren, zu Bette, der sich dann in seinen Kleidern niederlegte, um frühe bei der Hand zu sein; denn sein Herr hatte gesagt, die Postpferde würden vor sechse vors Haus kommen.","That evening he rummaged a lot through his papers, tore up a lot and threw them in the oven, sealed a few packages with the addresses for Wilhelm. They contained little essays, torn thoughts, of which I have seen various; and after he had kindled the fire at ten o'clock, and asked for a bottle of wine, he sent to bed the servant, whose chamber, like the bedrooms of the householders, was at the far end, and who then lay down in his clothes to go to the early morning to be hand; for his master had said the post-horses would come to the house before six.","He spent the rest of the evening going through his papers again, tore up many and threw them into the stove, sealed several packets and addressed them to William. The latter contained a few short articles and random observations, several of which I have seen. After having had the stove stoked once more at ten o ’ clock and ordering a bottle of wine for himself, he sent his servant to bed. The boy’s room, like the bedrooms of the other domestics, was far off in the back of the house. He lay down with his clothes on in order to be ready to leave early the next morning, for his master had told him that the post chaise would be at the house before six.","He spent the rest of the evening in arranging his papers: he tore and burned a great many; others he sealed up, and directed to Wilhelm.   They contained some detached thoughts and maxims, some of which I have perused.   At ten o'clock he ordered his fire to be made up, and a bottle of wine to be brought to him.   He then dismissed his servant, whose room, as well as the apartments of the rest of the family, was situated in another part of the house. The servant lay down without undressing, that he might be the sooner ready for his journey in the morning, his master having informed him that the post-horses would be at the door before six o'clock."
"Ich trete an das Fenster, meine Beste, und sehe, und sehe noch durch die stürmenden, vorüberfliehenden Wolken einzelne Sterne des ewigen Himmels! Nein, ihr werdet nicht fallen! der Ewige trägt euch an seinem Herzen, und mich. Ich sehe die Deichselsterne des Wagens, des liebsten unter allen Gestirnen. Wenn ich nachts von dir ging, wie ich aus deinem Tore trat, stand er gegen mir über. Mit welcher Trunkenheit habe ich ihn oft angesehen, oft mit aufgehabenen Händen ihn zum Zeichen, zum heiligen Merksteine meiner gegenwärtigen Seligkeit gemacht! und noch – O Lotte, was erinnert mich nicht an dich! umgibst du mich nicht! und habe ich nicht, gleich einem Kinde, ungenügsam allerlei Kleinigkeiten zu mir gerissen, die du Heilige berührt hattest!","I go to the window, my dear, and see, and still see, through the storming, fleeing clouds, individual stars of the eternal sky!

When I left you at night, as I came out of your gate, he stood over me. With what drunkenness I have often looked at him, often with raised hands made him a sign, a holy marker of my present bliss! and still - O Lotte, what doesn't remind me of you! don't you surround me and have I not, like a child, snatched up all sorts of little things that you holy ones had touched!","I walk over to the window, my dearest one, and look out. Through the storm clouds flying by, I can still see a few stars in the eternal sky. No, you will not fall. The Eternal One carries you in his heart, as he carries me. I can see the handle of the Big Dipper, my favorite of all the constellations. When I left you that night, as I walked out the gate, it stood in the sky facing me. In what a state of intoxication I have been often when I looked at it. Then I would lift my hand and make a sign of it, a sacred marker for my present bliss. And I still do! Oh, Lotte, what does not remind me of you? Are you not all around me, and haven’t I snatched all sorts of little things and held onto them like an insatiable child—things, my angel, that you touched?","I approach the window, my dearest of friends; and through the clouds, which are at this moment driven rapidly along by the impetuous winds, I behold the stars which illumine the eternal heavens.   No, you will not fall, celestial bodies: the hand of the Almighty supports both you and me!   I have looked for the last time upon the constellation of the Greater Bear: it is my favourite star; for when I bade you farewell at night, Charlotte, and turned my steps from your door, it always shone upon me.   With what rapture have I at times beheld it!   How often have I implored it with uplifted hands to witness my felicity! and even still -- But what object is there, Charlotte, which fails to summon up your image before me?   Do you not surround me on all sides? and have I not, like a child, treasured up every trifle which you have consecrated by your touch?"
"Unsere jungen Leute hatten einen Ball auf dem Lande angestellt, zu dem ich mich denn auch willig finden ließ. Ich bot einem hiesigen guten, schönen, übrigens unbedeutenden Mädchen die Hand, und es wurde ausgemacht, daß ich eine Kutsche nehmen, mit meiner Tänzerin und ihrer Base nach dem Orte der Lustbarkeit hinausfahren und auf dem Wege Charlotten S.. mitnehmen sollte. – »Sie werden ein schönes Frauenzimmer kennenlernen.« sagte meine Gesellschafterin, da wir durch den weiten, ausgehauenen Wald nach dem Jagdhause fuhren. – »Nehmen Sie sich in acht«, versetzte die Base, »daß Sie sich nicht verlieben!« – »Wieso?« sagte ich. – »Sie ist schon vergeben«, antwortete jene, »an einen sehr braven Mann, der weggereist ist, seine Sachen in Ordnung zu bringen, weil sein Vater gestorben ist, und sich um eine ansehnliche Versorgung zu bewerben.« – Die Nachricht war mir ziemlich gleichgültig.","Our young people had organized a ball in the country, to which I was willingly found. I offered my hand to a good, beautiful, but otherwise insignificant local girl, and it was agreed that I should take a carriage, drive out to the place of amusement with my dancer and her cousin, and take Charlotte S. with me on the way. - ""You will meet a beautiful woman,"" said my companion, as we drove through the wide, hewn forest to the hunting lodge. - ""Be careful,"" said the cousin, ""that you don't fall in love!"" - ""Why?"" I said. - ""It's already taken,"" she replied, ""to a very good man who has gone away to put his things in order because his father has died, and to apply for a considerable allowance."" - The news was me pretty indifferent.","Some of our young people had arranged a dance in the country, and I decided to go. I asked one of the young ladies here—a nice, good-looking but rather insignificant girl—to go with me, and it was agreed that I order a carriage for us and her cousin and that we pick up Charlotte S. on the way. “You are going to meet a very pretty girl,” my partner told me, as we drove through a clearing to the lodge. “Watch out that you don’t fall in love with her,” her cousin said. “And why shouldn’t I fall in love with her?” I wanted to know. “Because she is engaged,” my partner explained, “to a very worthy man who is away just now on business. His father died and he has to attend to the settlement of a quite considerable estate.” The information did not make much impression on me.","Some of our young people had proposed giving a ball in the country, at which I consented to be present.   I offered my hand for the evening to a pretty and agreeable, but rather commonplace, sort of girl from the immediate neighbourhood; and it was agreed that I should engage a carriage, and call upon Charlotte, with my partner and her aunt, to convey them to the ball.   My companion informed me, as we drove along through the park to the hunting-lodge, that I should make the acquaintance of a very charming young lady. "" Take care,"" added the aunt, ""that you do not lose your heart."" ""Why?"" said I.  ""Because she is already engaged to a very worthy man,"" she replied, ""who is gone to settle his affairs upon the death of his father, and will succeed to a very considerable inheritance. ""   This information possessed no interest for me."
"»Das sind nun wieder von deinen Grillen«, sagte Albert, »du überspannst alles und hast wenigstens hier gewiß unrecht, daß du den Selbstmord, wovon jetzt die Rede ist, mit großen Handlungen vergleichst: da man es doch für nichts anders als eine Schwäche halten kann. Denn freilich ist es leichter zu sterben, als ein qualvolles Leben standhaft zu ertragen.«","""Now that's from your freaks again,"" said Albert, ""you're exaggerating everything and you're certainly wrong here, at least, in comparing suicide, which we're talking about now, with great actions, since it's nothing but a weakness can hold. For of course it is easier to die than to endure a life of torment.”","“Now you are being fanciful again,” Albert said. “You always exaggerate, and you are certainly wrong when you classify suicide—and suicide is what we are talking about—as any sort of great achievement, since it can be defined only as a sign of weakness. For it is certainly easier to die than to stand up to a life of torment.”","""This is another of your extravagant humours,"" said Albert: ""you always exaggerate a case, and in this matter you are undoubtedly wrong; for we were speaking of suicide, which you compare with great actions, when it is impossible to regard it as anything but a weakness.   It is much easier to die than to bear a life of misery with fortitude."""

"Sie sagte das! o Wilhelm, wer kann wiederholen, was sie sagte! Wie kann der kalte, tote Buchstabe diese himmlische Blüte des Geistes darstellen! Albert fiel ihr sanft in die Rede: »Es greift Sie zu stark an, liebe Lotte! ich weiß, Ihre Seele hängt sehr nach diesen Ideen, aber ich bitte Sie...« – »O Albert«, sagte sie, »ich weiß, du vergissest nicht die Abende, da wir zusammensaßen an dem kleinen, runden Tischchen, wenn der Papa verreist war, und wir die Kleinen schlafen geschickt hatten. Du hattest oft ein gutes Buch und kamst so selten dazu, etwas zu lesen – War der Umgang dieser herrlichen Seele nicht mehr als alles? Die schöne, sanfte, muntere und immer tätige Frau! Gott kennt meine Tränen, mit denen ich mich oft in meinem Bette vor ihn hinwarf: er möchte mich ihr gleich machen.«","She said that! O Wilhelm, who can repeat what she said! How can the cold, dead letter represent this heavenly blossom of the spirit! Albert gently interrupted her: ""It's affecting you too much, dear Lotte! I know your soul is very attached to these ideas, but I beg you..."" - ""Oh Albert,"" she said, ""I know you don't forget the evenings when we sat together at the small, round table when the Papa was away and we had sent the little ones to sleep.

God knows my tears, with which I often threw myself before him in my bed: he would like to make me like her.""","That is what she said. But William, who can possibly repeat what she said? How can cold, dead letters express the heavenly revelation of her spirit? Albert interrupted her gently by saying, “Dear Lotte, you take these things too much to heart. I know that such ideas mean a great deal to you, but please…” “Oh, Albert,” she said, “I know you haven’t forgotten the evenings when we sat at the little round table…. Papa was away and we had sent the little ones to bed. You often brought a good book with you, but seldom had the opportunity to read aloud from it because…oh, wasn’t it worth more than anything to listen to her? What a wonderful spirit she had, what a beautiful, gentle soul she was—and never, never idle. God knows the tears I have shed, kneeling at my bedside and praying to God that He might make me like her.”","Thus did she express herself; but O Wilhelm! who can do justice to her language? how can cold and passionless words convey the heavenly expressions of the spirit?   Albert interrupted her gently.   ""This affects you too deeply, my dear Charlotte.   I know your soul dwells on such recollections wlth intense delight; but I implore -- ""  ""O Albert!"" she continued, ""I am sure you do not forget the evenings when we three used to sit at the little round table, when papa was absent, and the little ones had retired. You often had a good book with you, but seldom read it; the conversation of that noble being was preferable to everything, -- that beautiful, bright, gentle, and yet ever-toiling woman.   God alone knows how I have supplicated with tears on my nightly couch, that I might be like her."" I threw myself at her feet, and, seizing her hand, bedewed it with a thousand tears.  "
"Ich sitze in meinem Jammer, ich harre auf den Morgen in meinen Tränen. Wühlet das Grab, ihr Freunde der Toten, aber schließt es nicht, bis ich komme.

"Sie fühlt, was ich dulde. Heute ist mir ihr Blick tief durchs Herz gedrungen. Ich fand sie allein; ich sagte nichts, und sie sah mich an. Und ich sah nicht mehr in ihr die liebliche Schönheit, nicht mehr das Leuchten des trefflichen Geistes, das war alles vor meinen Augen verschwunden. Ein weit herrlicherer Blick wirkte auf mich, voll Ausdruck des innigsten Anteils, des süßesten Mitleidens. Warum durft' ich mich nicht ihr zu Füßen werfen? warum durft' ich nicht an ihrem Halse mit tausend Küssen antworten? Sie nahm ihre Zuflucht zum Klavier und hauchte mit süßer, leiser Stimme harmonische Laute zu ihrem Spiele. Nie habe ich ihre Lippen so reizend gesehn; es war, als wenn sie sich lechzend öffneten, jene süßen Töne in sich zu schlürfen, die aus dem Instrument hervorquollen, und nur der heimliche Widerschall aus dem reinen Munde zurückklänge – Ja wenn ich dir das so sagen könnte! – Ich widerstand nicht länger, neigte mich und schwur: Nie will ich es wagen, einen Kuß euch aufzudrücken, Lippen, auf denen die Geister des Himmels schweben. – Und doch – ich will – Ha! siehst du, das steht wie eine Scheidewand vor meiner Seele – diese[87] Seligkeit – und dann untergegangen, diese Sünde abzubüßen – Sünde?","She feels what I tolerate. Today her gaze penetrated deep into my heart. I found her alone; I said nothing and she looked at me. And I no longer saw the lovely beauty in her, no longer the radiance of the excellent spirit, it had all disappeared before my eyes. A far more glorious look worked on me, full of expressions of the deepest sympathy, the sweetest pity. Why couldn't I throw myself at her feet? why wasn't I allowed to answer her neck with a thousand kisses? She took refuge in the piano, and breathed harmonious tones to her playing in a sweet, soft voice. I have never seen her lips so lovely; it was as if they opened themselves panting, to slurp up those sweet tones that poured out of the instrument, and only the secret echo from the pure mouth sounded back - Yes, if I could tell you that! I resisted no longer, bowed my head and swore: I will never dare to kiss you, lips on which the spirits of heaven hover. - And yet - I want - Ha! you see, it stands like a dividing wall in front of my soul - this[87] bliss - and then perished to atone for this sin - sin?","She knows how I suffer. Today her eyes looked deep into my heart. I found her alone. I said nothing, and she looked at me. And I no longer saw her loveliness nor the radiance of her wonderful spirit. All that had disappeared from before my eyes. Instead I had a far more glorious vision. I saw her face filled with an expression of the most intimate sympathy, the sweetest compassion. Why couldn’t I throw myself at her feet? Why couldn’t I counter with an embrace and a thousand kisses? She escaped to the piano and sang to her own accompaniment in her sweet, low voice, and so melodiously. Never were her chaste lips more enchanting. It was as though they parted thirsty for the sweet tones that swelled forth from the instrument and only a furtive echo escaped them. Ah me, if only I could explain it to you! I offered no more resistance. I bowed my head and vowed that never would I presume to kiss those lips, o’er which celestial spirits hover…and yet…I want to kiss them. Ha! You see? That is what stands before my soul like a bulkhead—such bliss, and then…down, down, to atone for such a sin…. A sin?","She is sensible of my sufferings.   This morning her look pierced my very soul.   I found her alone, and she was silent: she steadfastly surveyed me.   I no longer saw in her face the charms of beauty or the fire of genius: these had disappeared.   But I was affected by an expression much more touching, a look of the deepest sympathy and of the softest pity.   Why was I afraid to throw myself at her feet?   Why did I not dare to take her in my arms, and answer her by a thousand kisses?   She had recourse to her piano for relief, and in a low and sweet voice accompanied the music with delicious sounds.   Her lips never appeared so lovely: they seemed but just to open, that they might imbibe the sweet tones which issued from the instrument, and return the heavenly vibration from her lovely mouth.   Oh! who can express my sensations?   I was quite overcome, and, bending down, pronounced this vow: ""Beautiful lips, which the angels guard, never will I seek to profane your purity with a kiss."" And yet, my friend, oh, I wish -- but my heart is darkened by doubt and indecision -- could I but taste felicity, and then die to expiate the sin!   What sin?"
Am 30. November.,On November 30th.,November 30th,NOVEMBER 30.
"Es hat sich vor meiner Seele wie ein Vorhang weggezogen, und der Schauplatz des unendlichen Lebens verwandelt sich vor mir in den Abgrund des ewig offenen Grabes. Kannst du sagen: Das ist! da alles vorübergeht? da alles mit der Wetterschnelle vorüberrollt, so selten die ganze Kraft seines Daseins ausdauert, ach, in den Strom fortgerissen, untergetaucht und an Felsen zerschmettert wird? Da ist kein Augenblick, der nicht dich verzehrte und die Deinigen um[52] dich her, kein Augenblick, da du nicht ein Zerstörer bist, sein mußt; der harmloseste Spaziergang kostet tausend armen Würmchen das Leben, es zerrüttet ein Fußtritt die mühseligen Gebäude der Ameisen und stampft eine kleine Welt in ein schmähliches Grab. Ha! nicht die große, seltne Not der Welt, diese Fluten, die eure Dörfer wegspülen, diese Erdbeben, die eure Städte verschlingen, rühren mich; mir untergräbt das Herz die verzehrende Kraft, die in dem All der Natur verborgen liegt; die nichts gebildet hat, das nicht seinen Nachbar, nicht sich selbst zerstörte. Und so taumle ich beängstigt. Himmel und Erde und ihre webenden Kräfte um mich her: ich sehe nichts als ein ewig verschlingendes, ewig wiederkäuendes Ungeheuer.","It has drawn away from my soul like a curtain, and the scene of infinite life is transformed before me into the abyss of the eternally open grave. Can you say: That is! since everything passes? when everything rolls by with the swiftness of the weather, however seldom the whole strength of its existence endures, alas, is swept away in the current, submerged and smashed against rocks? There is not a moment that does not consume you and yours around you, not a moment that you are not, must be, a destroyer; the most harmless walk costs the lives of a thousand poor worms, one kick shatters the toilsome edifices of the ants and stamps a small world into a shameful grave. Ha! I am not touched by the great, rare misery of the world, these floods that wash away your villages, these earthquakes that devour your cities; my heart undermines the consuming power that lies hidden in the universe of nature; which has formed nothing that did not destroy its neighbor or itself. And so I stagger in fear. Heaven and earth and their weaving forces around me: I see nothing but an ever-devouring, ever-chewing monster.","Something has been drawn away from my soul like a curtain and the panorama of eternal life has been transformed before my eyes into the abyss of an eternally open grave. Who can say, “That’s how it is!” when all things are transient and roll away with the passing storm, and one’s powers so rarely suffice for one’s span of life but are carried off in the torrent to sink and be dashed against the rocks? There is not a moment in which one is not a destroyer and has to be a destroyer. A harmless walk kills a thousand poor crawling things; one footstep smashes a laboriously built anthill and stamps a whole little world into an ignominious grave. The rare disasters of this world, the floods that wash away our villages, the earthquakes that swallow up our cities—they do not move me. My heart is undermined by the consuming power that lies hidden in the Allness of nature, which has created nothing, formed nothing, which has destroyed neither its neighbor nor itself. Surrounded by the heavens and the earth and the powerful web they weave between them, I reel with dread. I can see nothing but an eternally devouring, eternally regurgitating monster.","It is as if a curtain had been drawn from before my eyes, and, instead of prospects of eternal life, the abyss of an ever open grave yawned before me.   Can we say of anything that it exists when all passes away, when time, with the speed of a storm, carries all things onward, -- and our transitory existence, hurried along by the torrent, is either swallowed up by the waves or dashed against the rocks?   There is not a moment but preys upon you, -- and upon all around you, not a moment in which you do not yourself become a destroyer.   The most innocent walk deprives of life thousands of poor insects: one step destroys the fabric of the industrious ant, and converts a little world into chaos.   No: it is not the great and rare calamities of the world, the floods which sweep away whole villages, the earthquakes which swallow up our towns, that affect me.   My heart is wasted by the thought of that destructive power which lies concealed in every part of universal nature.   Nature has formed nothing that does not consume itself, and every object near it: so that, surrounded by earth and air, and all the active powers, I wander on my way with aching heart; and the universe is to me a fearful monster, for ever devouring its own offspring."
"Du kennst von alters her meine Art, mich anzubauen, mir irgend an einem vertraulichen Orte ein Hüttchen aufzuschlagen und da mit aller Einschränkung zu herbergen. Auch hier habe ich wieder ein Plätzchen angetroffen, das mich angezogen hat.","From time immemorial you know my way of growing up, pitching a hut in some confidential place and staying there with all restrictions. Again, I found a spot that attracted me.","You know my old habit of settling down in a place that suits me and of taking refuge there, however primitive it may be. Well, I have found such a spot here.","You know of old my ways of settling anywhere, of selecting a little cottage in some cosy spot, and of putting up in it with every inconvenience.   Here, too, I have discovered such a snug, comfortable place, which possesses peculiar charms for me."
"Nein, es ist gut! es ist alles gut! – Ich – ihr Mann! O Gott, der du mich machtest, wenn du mir diese Seligkeit bereitet hättest, mein ganzes Leben sollte ein anhaltendes Gebet sein. Ich will nicht rechten, und verzeihe mir diese Tränen, verzeihe mir meine vergeblichen Wünsche! – Sie meine Frau! Wenn ich das liebste Geschöpf unter der Sonne in meine Arme geschlossen hätte – Es geht mir ein Schauder durch den ganzen Körper, Wilhelm, wenn Albert sie um den schlanken Leib faßt.","No, it's good! Everything is good! – I – her husband! O God, who made me, if you had given me this bliss, my whole life should be an ongoing prayer. I don't want to argue, and forgive me these tears, forgive me my futile wishes! - You my wife! If I had taken the dearest creature under the sun in my arms - I shudder through my whole body, Wilhelm, when Albert puts his arms around her slender body.","No, all is well, all is well just as it is. I…her husband! O God, Who didst make me as I am, hadst Thou but granted me this bliss, my whole life would have been a paean of praise to Thee! But I shall not remonstrate, and I beg Thee to forgive my tears and my vain desires. Lotte…my wife! If only I could say that I had held the most beloved creature under the sun in my arms! It makes me shudder, William, to think of Albert putting his arms around her slender waist.","No, no! it is yet well all is well!   I her husband!   O God, who gave me being, if thou hadst destined this happiness for me, my whole life would have been one continual thanksgiving!   But I will not murmur -- forgive these tears, forgive these fruitless wishes. She -- my wife!   Oh, the very thought of folding that dearest of Heaven's creatures in my arms!   Dear Wilhelm, my whole frame feels convulsed when I see Albert put his arms around her slender waist!"
"Nun ging's an, und wir ergetzten uns eine Weile an mannigfaltigen Schlingungen der Arme. Mit welchem Reize,[24] mit welcher Flüchtigkeit bewegte sie sich! und da wir nun gar ans Walzen kamen und wie die Sphären um einander herumrollten, ging's freilich anfangs, weil's die wenigsten können, ein bißchen bunt durcheinander. Wir waren klug und ließen sie austoben, und als die Ungeschicktesten den Plan geräumt hatten, fielen wir ein und hielten mit noch einem Paare, mit Audran und seiner Tänzerin, wacker aus. Nie ist mir's so leicht vom Flecke gegangen. Ich war kein Mensch mehr. Das liebenswürdigste Geschöpf in den Armen zu haben und mit ihr herumzufliegen wie Wetter, daß alles rings umher verging, und – Wilhelm, um ehrlich zu sein, tat ich aber doch den Schwur, daß ein Mädchen, das ich liebte, auf das ich Ansprüche hätte, mir nie mit einem andern walzen sollte als mit mir, und wenn ich drüber zugrunde gehen müßte. Du verstehst mich!","Now it started, and we amused ourselves for a while with the various wrappings of our arms. With what charm,[24] with what fleetingness she moved! and since we got down to rolling and how the spheres rolled around each other, things got a bit mixed up at first, because very few can do it. We were clever and let them romp, and when the clumsiest had abandoned the plan, we fell in and held out bravely with another couple, Audran and his dancer. It's never been so easy for me to leave the spot. I wasn't human anymore. To have the loveliest creature in my arms and to fly about with her like storm that all around passed away, and - Wilhelm, to be honest, I did swear that I had a claim on a girl I loved , I should never waltz with anyone but me, even if I had to perish over it. You understand me!","So that is how it all began. For a while we were simply delighted with the interlacing of our arms as we danced together. How charming and fleeting was her every move! And when it was time for the waltz and the couples began revolving around each other like spheres there was quite a bit of confusion; at any rate, there was at first, because so few knew how to waltz. We were clever—we left the floor to the others, and when the clumsiest ones had had enough, we joined in and with Andran and his partner were the last couples on the floor. I can’t recall ever having felt so light. I was transported! To hold the dearest creature in the world in my arms and fly through the room with her until everything around me was lost and…William, to be frank, I swore to myself then and there that the girl whom I loved and to whom I therefore had certain rights should never waltz with anyone but me, and if it should prove to be my downfall! Can you understand me?","We set off, and, at first, delighted ourselves with the usual graceful motions of the arms.   With what grace, with what ease, she moved!   When the waltz commenced, and the dancers whirled around each other in the giddy maze, there was some confusion, owing to the incapacity of some of the dancers.   We judiciously remained still, allowing the others to weary themselves; and, when the awkward dancers had withdrawn, we joined in, and kept it up famously together with one other couple, -- Andran and his partner. Never did I dance more lightly.   I felt myself more than mortal, holding this loveliest of creatures in my arms, flying, with her as rapidly as the wind, till I lost sight of every other object; and O Wilhelm, I vowed at that moment, that a maiden whom I loved, or for whom I felt the slightest attachment, never, never should waltz with any one else but with me, if I went to perdition for it! -- you will understand this."

"Und was ist das, daß Albert dein Mann ist? Mann! Das wäre denn für diese Welt – und für diese Welt Sünde, daß ich dich liebe, daß ich dich aus seinen Armen in die meinigen reißen möchte? Sünde? Gut, und ich strafe mich dafür; ich habe sie in ihrer ganzen Himmelswonne geschmeckt, diese Sünde, habe Lebensbalsam und Kraft in mein Herz gesaugt. Du bist von diesem Augenblicke mein! mein, o Lotte! Ich gehe voran! gehe zu meinem Vater, zu deinem Vater. Dem will ich's klagen, und er wird mich trösten, bis du kommst, und ich fliege dir entgegen und fasse dich und bleibe bei dir vor dem Angesichte des Unendlichen in ewigen Umarmungen.","And what is it that Albert is your husband? Man! Would that be a sin for this world - and for this world, that I love you, that I want to tear you from his arms into mine? Sin? Good, and I punish myself for it; I have tasted it in all its heavenly bliss, this sin, have sucked the balm of life and strength into my heart. You are mine from this moment! mine, o Lotte! I'm going ahead! go to my father, to your father. I will complain to him, and he will comfort me until you come, and I will fly to meet you and take hold of you and stay with you before the face of infinity in eternal embraces.","“And what difference does it make that Albert is your husband? Husband— that’s a word for this world, and for this world it’s a sin that I love you and would wrench you out of his arms into mine. A sin? Very well then, and I punish myself for it. I have tasted this sin in all its divine rapture; I have sucked its balm and strength into my heart. From now on you are mine—mine, Lotte! I go on ahead to my Father. To Him I will complain, and He will comfort me until you come, and I fly to meet you and enfold you and remain at your side in the sight of Infinite God in one eternal embrace.","""And what do they mean by saying Albert is your husband?   He may be so for this world; and in this world it is a sin to love you, to wish to tear you from his embrace.   Yes, it is a crime; and I suffer the punishment, but I have enjoyed the full delight of my sin.   I have inhaled a balm that has revived my soul.   From this hour you are mine; yes, Charlotte, you are mine!   I go before you.   I go to my Father and to your Father.   I will pour out my sorrows before him, and he will give me comfort till you arrive.   Then will I fly to meet you.   I will claim you, and remain your eternal embrace, in the presence of the Almighty."
"Ich muß Ihnen schreiben, liebe Lotte, hier in der Stube einer geringen Bauernherberge, in die ich mich vor einem schweren Wetter geflüchtet habe. Solange ich in dem traurigen Nest D.. unter dem fremden, meinem Herzen ganz fremden Volke herumziehe, habe ich keinen Augenblick gehabt, keinen, an dem mein Herz mich geheißen hätte, Ihnen zu schreiben; und jetzt in dieser Hütte, in dieser Einsamkeit, in dieser Einschränkung, da Schnee und Schloßen wider mein Fensterchen wüten, hier waren Sie mein erster Gedanke. Wie ich hereintrat, überfiel mich Ihre Gestalt, Ihr Andenken, o Lotte! so heilig, so warm! Guter Gott! der erste glückliche Augenblick wieder.[64]","I must write to you, dear Lotte, here in the room of a modest peasant inn, where I took refuge from bad weather. As long as I wandered about in the sad nest D.. among the foreign people, who were completely foreign to my heart, I never had a moment, not one, when my heart bade me write to you; and now in this hut, in this loneliness, in this confinement, with snow and castles raging against my little window, here you were my first thought. As I entered, your form, your memory, overwhelmed me, O Lotte! so holy, so warm! Good God! the first happy moment again.[64]","I must write to you, dear Lotte, here in a humble peasant inn where I have taken shelter from a severe storm. When I am in that miserable little town of D., among strangers, with people who are totally alien to my heart, there isn’t a moment, not one, when my heart bids me write to you. But now, in this lowly house, in this solitude and confinement, with hail and snow pelting against the little window of my room, my first thoughts go out to you. When I entered I was overwhelmed by a vision of you, by my memories, oh Lotte— such sacred, such heartfelt memories! Dear God, this is my first moment of happiness since I left!","I must write to you from this place, my dear Charlotte, from a small room in a country inn, where I have taken shelter from a severe storm.   During my whole residence in that wretched place D--, where I lived amongst strangers, -- strangers, indeed, to this heart, -- I never at any time felt the smallest inclination to correspond with you; but in this cottage, in this retirement, in this solitude, with the snow and hail beating against my lattice-pane, you are my first thought.   The instant I entered , your figure rose up before me, and the remembrance!   O my Charlotte, the sacred, tender remembrance!   Gracious Heaven! restore to me the happy moment of our first acquaintance."
"Mußte denn das so sein, daß das, was des Menschen Glückseligkeit macht, wieder die Quelle seines Elendes würde?",Did it have to be that what makes man happy should again become the source of his misery?,Why does that which makes a man happy have to become the source of his misery?,"Must it ever be thus, -- that the source of our happiness must also be the fountain of our misery?  "
"Ich bat sie um den zweiten Contretanz; sie sagte mir den dritten zu, und mit der liebenswürdigsten Freimütigkeit von der Welt versicherte sie mir, daß sie herzlich gern deutsch tanze. – »Es ist hier so Mode«, fuhr sie fort, »daß jedes Paar, das zusammen gehört, beim Deutschen zusammenbleibt, und mein Chapeau walzt schlecht und dankt mir's, wenn ich ihm die Arbeit erlasse. Ihr Frauenzimmer kann's auch nicht und mag nicht, und ich habe im Englischen gesehen, daß Sie gut walzen; wenn Sie nun mein sein wollen fürs Deutsche, so gehen Sie und bitten sich's von meinem Herrn aus, und ich will zu Ihrer Dame gehen.« – Ich gab ihr die Hand darauf, und wir machten aus, daß ihr Tänzer inzwischen meine Tänzerin unterhalten sollte.","I asked her for the second counter dance; she promised me the third, and with the loveliest frankness in the world she assured me that she really liked to dance in German. ""It's so fashionable here,"" she continued, ""that every couple who belong together stays together when speaking German, and my chapeau rolls badly and thanks me if I let him do the work. Your wife can't and doesn't like it either, and I've seen in English that you roll well; if you want to be mine for German, then go and ask my master, and I will go to your lady.” I shook her hand, and we agreed that her dancer should entertain my dancer in the meantime .","I asked her for the second contredanse. She replied that she could give me the third and with the most engaging frankness assured me that she liked to dance the allemande.3 “It is customary here,” she explained, “to dance the allemande with your escort. But my young man doesn’t waltz very well and won’t mind a bit if I relieve him of the obligation. Your partner can’t waltz either and doesn’t like to, so if you want to dance the allemande with me, why don’t you ask my partner for permission, and I will go and speak to your young lady about it?” This was agreed upon and our partners entertained each other while Lotte and I danced.","She was engaged for the second country dance, but promised me the third, and assured me, with the most agreeable freedom, that she was very fond of waltzing.   ""It is the custom here,"" she said, ""for the previous partners to waltz together; but my partner is an indifferent waltzer, and will feel delighted if I save him the trouble.   Your partner is not allowed to waltz, and, indeed, is equally incapable: but I observed during the country dance that you waltz well; so, if you will waltz with me, I beg you would propose it to my partner, and I will propose it to yours.""   We agreed, and it was arranged that our partners should mutually entertain each other."
"Morgens um sechse tritt der Bediente herein mit dem Lichte. Er findet seinen Herrn an der Erde, die Pistole und Blut. Er ruft, er faßt ihn an; keine Antwort, er röchelt nur noch. Er läuft nach den Ärzten, nach Alberten. Lotte hört die Schelle ziehen, ein Zittern ergreift alle ihre Glieder. Sie[123] weckt ihren Mann, sie stehen auf, der Bediente bringt heulend und stotternd die Nachricht, Lotte sinkt ohnmächtig vor Alberten nieder.","At six in the morning the servant comes in with the light. He finds his master on the ground, the pistol and blood. He calls, he touches him; no answer, he just wheezes. He runs after the doctors, after Alberten. Lotte hears the bell being pulled, and every limb in her limbs trembles. She[123] wakes her husband, they stand up, the servant brings the news, crying and stuttering, Lotte falls down in front of Alberte in a faint.","Next morning at six, the servant came into the room with a light. He found his master lying on the floor, the pistol, and the blood. He cried out, touched him—no response. Werther’s last breath was rattling in his throat. The boy ran for the doctor and for Albert. Lotte heard the bell, and a shiver ran through every member of her body. She woke her husband. They got up. The servant, sobbing and stammering, delivered his message. Lotte sank fainting to the ground at Albert’s feet.","In the morning, at six o'clock, the servant went into Werther's room with a candle.   He found his master stretched upon the floor, weltering in his blood, and the pistols at his side.   He called, he took him in his arms, but received no answer.   Life was not yet quite extinct.   The servant ran for a surgeon, and then went to fetch Albert.   Charlotte heard the ringing of the bell: a cold shudder seized her.   She wakened her husband, and they both rose. The servant, bathed in tears faltered forth the dreadful news. Charlotte fell senseless at Albert's feet."
"Umsonst strecke ich meine Arme nach ihr aus, morgens, wenn ich von schweren Träumen aufdämmere, vergebens suche ich sie nachts in meinem Bette, wenn mich ein glücklicher, unschuldiger Traum getäuscht hat, als säß' ich neben ihr auf der Wiese und hielt' ihre Hand und deckte sie mit tausend Küssen. Ach, wenn ich dann noch halb im Taumel des Schlafes nach ihr tappe und drüber mich ermuntere – ein Strom von Tränen bricht aus meinem gepreßten Herzen, und ich weine trostlos einer finstern Zukunft entgegen.","In vain do I stretch out my arms to her, in the morning when I wake up from bad dreams, in vain do I look for her in my bed at night, when a happy, innocent dream has deceived me, as if I were sitting next to her in the meadow and holding her hand and covered it with a thousand kisses. Ah, if I still grope for her half in the dizzy sleep and cheer myself up about it - a stream of tears breaks out of my crushed heart, and I weep disconsolately towards a dark future.","I stretch out my arms for her in vain when, troubled by my dreams, I awaken in the morning; at night I vainly seek her in my bed when a happy, innocent dream has deceived me into imagining I am sitting beside her in a field and holding her hand and kissing her. Oh, when I feel for her, still half dazed with sleep, and wake myself with it—a flood of tears flows from my oppressed heart and I weep inconsolably into a dark, dreary future.","In vain do I stretch out my arms toward her when I awaken in the morning from my weary slumbers.   In vain do I seek for her at night in my bed, when some innocent dream has happily deceived me, and placed her near me in the fields, when I have seized her hand and covered it with countless kisses.   And when I feel for her in the half confusion of sleep, with the happy sense that she is near, tears flow from my oppressed heart; and, bereft of all comfort, I weep over my future woes."

"Indes kann ich Alberten meine Achtung nicht versagen. Seine gelassene Außenseite sticht gegen die Unruhe meines Charakters sehr lebhaft ab, die sich nicht verbergen läßt. Er hat viel Gefühl und weiß, was er an Lotten hat. Er scheint wenig üble Laune zu haben, und du weißt, das ist die Sünde, die ich ärger hasse am Menschen als alle andre.","However, I cannot fail to respect Albert. His serene exterior contrasts very vividly with the restlessness of my character, which cannot be concealed. He has a lot of feeling and knows what he has in Lotten. He doesn't seem to be in a bad temper, and you know that's the sin I hate in man more than any other.","Meanwhile, I cannot help respecting Albert. His easygoing behavior contrasts strangely with my restlessness, which cannot be concealed. He is a man of strong feelings and knows what a treasure he has in Lotte. He seems to be a man of good spirits too, and you know that, as far as I am concerned, moroseness is a man’s greatest vice.","I cannot help esteeming Albert.   The coolness of his temper contrasts strongly with the impetuosity of mine, which I cannot conceal. He has a great deal of feeling, and is fully sensible of the treasure he possesses in Charlotte.   He is free from ill-humour, which you know is the fault I detest most."
"3 Man hat auch hier die Namen einiger vaterländischer Autoren weggelassen. Wer teil an Lottens Beifalle hat, wird es gewiß an seinem Herzen fühlen, wenn er diese Stelle lesen sollte, und sonst braucht es ja niemand zu wissen.","3 Here, too, the names of some patriotic authors have been omitted. Whoever shares in Lotte's applause will certainly feel it in his heart if he reads this passage, and nobody else needs to know.","* Here, too, the names of some authors have been omitted. Those of whom Lotte approved will surely know it in their hearts, if they have read this far, and the rest need not know anything about it.","I then sprang up, and ran out upon the terrace, and saw, under the shade of the linden-trees, her white dress disappearing near the garden-gate."
"Müsse der trostlos umkommen, der eines Kranken spottet, der nach der entferntesten Quelle reist, die seine Krankheit vermehren, sein Ausleben schmerzhafter machen wird! der sich über das bedrängte Herz erhebt, das, um seine Gewissensbisse loszuwerden und die Leiden seiner Seele abzutun, eine Pilgrimschaft nach dem heiligen Grabe tut. Jeder Fußtritt, der seine Sohlen auf ungebahntem Wege durchschneidet, ist ein Linderungstropfen der geängsteten Seele, und mit jeder ausgedauerten Tagereise legt sich das Herz um viele Bedrängnisse leichter nieder. – Und dürft ihr das Wahn nennen, ihr Wortkrämer auf euren Polstern? – Wahn! – O Gott! du siehst meine Tränen! Mußtest du, der du den Menschen arm genug erschufst, ihm auch Brüder zugeben, die ihm das bißchen Armut, das bißchen Vertrauen noch raubten, das er auf dich hat, auf dich, du Allliebender! Denn das Vertrauen zu einer heilenden Wurzel, zu den Tränen des Weinstockes, was ist es als Vertrauen zu dir, daß du in alles, was uns umgibt, Heil – und Linderungskraft gelegt hast, der wir so stündlich bedürfen? Vater, den ich nicht kenne! Vater, der sonst meine ganze Seele[90] füllte und nun sein Angesicht von mir gewendet hat, rufe mich zu dir! Schweige nicht länger! Dein Schweigen wird diese dürstende Seele nicht aufhalten – Und würde ein Mensch, ein Vater, zürnen können, dem sein unvermutet rückkehrender Sohn um den Hals fiele und riefe: »Ich bin wieder da, mein Vater! Zürne nicht, daß ich die Wanderschaft abbreche, die ich nach deinem Willen länger aushalten sollte. Die Welt ist überall einerlei, auf Mühe und Arbeit Lohn und Freude; aber was soll mir das? mir ist nur wohl, wo du bist, und vor deinem Angesichte will ich leiden und genießen.« – Und du, lieber himmlischer Vater, solltest ihn von dir weisen?","Must he perish disconsolately who scoffs at the sick, who travels to the farthest source that will increase his illness, make his life more painful! who rises above the oppressed heart, which, to rid itself of the pangs of conscience and the sufferings of its soul, makes a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre. Every footstep that cuts through his soles on an uncharted path is a drop of relief for the anxious soul, and with every day's journey endured the heart lies down many afflictions lighter. – And may you call it delusion, you wordmongers on your upholstery? - delusion! - O God! you see my tears Did you, who created man poor enough, also have to give him brothers who rob him of that little bit of poverty, that little bit of trust that he has in you, in you, you all-loving one! Because trust in a healing root, in the tears of the vine, what is it but trust in you that you have placed healing and soothing power in everything that surrounds us, which we need so hourly? Father I don't know! Father, who used to fill my whole soul[90] and has now turned his face from me, call me to you! don't be silent any longer! Your silence will not stop this thirsting soul - And would a man, a father, be angry if his unexpectedly returning son fell on his neck and cried: ""I'm back, my father! Don't be angry that I break off the journey that you wanted me to endure longer. The world is the same everywhere, toil and work reward and joy; but what's the point of that? I am only happy where you are, and before your face I want to suffer and enjoy.« - And you, dear heavenly father, should reject him?","The miserable wretch should perish who dares to mock a sick man journeying to a far-off healing spring that will only make his sickness worse and the rest of his days more painful; and so should he who looks down arrogantly on a man with a sorely afflicted heart who, to rid himself of his guilty conscience and cast off the sufferings of his soul, makes a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulcher. Every step he takes on an unbeaten track is balm to his fearful soul, and with every day of his journey endured, his heart rests lightened of many anxieties. And you dare to call it madness, you sophists on your downy cushions? Madness? O God, Thou dost see my tears. Why didst Thou, Who made man poor, have to give him brothers who would rob him even of the little he has, of the little faith he has in Thee, Thou all-loving God? For what is faith in a healing root or in the tears of the grapevine but faith in Thee, in that Thou hast imbued all that surrounds us with the powers of salvation and the forces that ease pain, of which we stand in hourly need. Father Whom I know not, Father Who once filled my whole soul but has turned His face from me now—call me unto Thee. Be silent no longer. Thy silence will not deter this thirsting soul. Could any man—could any father—be angry with a son who comes back unexpectedly and throws his arms around his neck, crying, “Here I am, returned to thee, my father. Be not angry that I interrupted my wanderings, which according to Thy will, I should have endured longer. The world is the same everywhere—in effort and work, in reward and joy—but what concern is it of mine? Only where Thou art can I be content. There I will suffer and rejoice.” Wouldst Thou, dear heavenly Father, cast out such a man?","Let that man die unconsoled who can deride the invalid for undertaking a journey to distant, healthful springs, where he often finds only a heavier disease and a more painful death, or who can exult over the despairing mind of a sinner, who, to obtain peace of conscience and an alleviation of misery, makes a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre.   Each laborious step which galls his wounded feet in rough and untrodden paths pours a drop of balm into his troubled soul, and the journey of many a weary day brings a nightly relief to his anguished heart.   Will you dare call this enthusiasm, ye crowd of pompous declaimers?   Enthusiasm!   0 God! thou seest my tears.   Thou hast allotted us our portion of misery: must we also have brethren to persecute us, to deprive us of our consolation, of our trust in thee, and in thy love and mercy?   For our trust in the virtue of the healing root, or in the strength of the vine, what is it else than a belief in thee from whom all that surrounds us derives its healing and restoring powers?   Father, whom I know not, -- who wert once wont to fill my soul, but who now hidest thy face from me, -- call me back to thee; be silent no longer; thy silence shall not delay a soul which thirsts after thee.   What man, what father, could be angry with a son for returning to him suddenly, for falling on his neck, and exclaiming, ""I am here again, my father! forgive me if I have anticipated my journey, and returned before the appointed time!   The world is everywhere the same, -- a scene of labour and pain, of pleasure and reward; but what does it all avail?   I am happy only where thou art, and in thy presence am I content to suffer or enjoy.""   And wouldst thou, heavenly Father, banish such a child from thy presence?"

"Das Haus, die Nachbarschaft, die Stadt kam in Aufruhr. Albert trat herein. Werthern hatte man auf das Bett gelegt, die Stirn verbunden, sein Gesicht schon wie eines Toten, er rührte kein Glied. Die Lunge röchelte noch fürchterlich, bald schwach, bald stärker; man erwartete sein Ende.","The house, the neighborhood, the town was in turmoil. Albert entered. Werthern had been laid on the bed, his forehead bandaged, his face already dead, he didn't move a limb. The lungs still rattled horribly, now weakly, now more severely; one expected its end.","The house, the neighborhood, the whole town were filled with commotion. Albert came in. They laid Werther on the bed and bandaged his forehead. His face was already like that of the dead; he did not move a muscle. His breathing was terrible—weak at one moment, then a little stronger. They were waiting for the end to come.","The house, the neighbourhood, and the whole town were immediately in commotion.   Albert arrived.   They had laid Werther on the bed: his head was bound up, and the paleness of death was upon his face. His limbs were motionless; but he still breathed, at one time strongly, then weaker -- his death was momently expected."
"Eine wunderbare Heiterkeit hat meine ganze Seele eingenommen, gleich den süßen Frühlingsmorgen, die ich mit ganzem Herzen genieße. Ich bin allein und freue mich meines Lebens in dieser Gegend, die für solche Seelen geschaffen ist wie die meine. Ich bin so glücklich, mein Bester, so ganz in dem Gefühle von ruhigem Dasein versunken, daß meine Kunst darunter leidet. Ich könnte jetzt nicht zeichnen, nicht einen Strich, und bin nie ein größerer Maler gewesen als in diesen Augenblicken. Wenn das liebe Tal um mich dampft, und die hohe Sonne an der Oberfläche der undurchdringlichen Finsternis meines Waldes ruht, und nur einzelne Strahlen sich in das innere Heiligtum stehlen, ich dann im hohen Grase am fallenden Bache liege, und näher an der Erde tausend mannigfaltige Gräschen mir merkwürdig werden; wenn ich das Wimmeln der kleinen Welt zwischen Halmen, die unzähligen, unergründlichen Gestalten der Würmchen, der Mückchen näher an meinem Herzen fühle, und fühle die Gegenwart des Allmächtigen, der uns nach seinem Bilde schuf, das Wehen des Alliebenden, der uns in ewiger Wonne schwebend trägt und erhält; mein Freund! wenn's dann um meine Augen dämmert, und die Welt um mich her und der Himmel ganz in meiner Seele ruhn wie die Gestalt einer Geliebten – dann sehne ich mich oft und denke: Ach könntest du das wieder ausdrücken, könntest du dem Papiere das einhauchen, was so voll, so warm in dir lebt, daß es würde der Spiegel deiner Seele, wie deine Seele ist der Spiegel des unendlichen Gottes! – Mein Freund – Aber ich gehe darüber zugrunde, ich erliege unter der Gewalt der Herrlichkeit dieser Erscheinungen.","A wonderful serenity has taken hold of my whole soul, like the sweet spring mornings that I enjoy with all my heart. I am alone and enjoying my life in this region made for souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear, so absorbed in the feeling of quiet existence that my art suffers. I couldn't draw now, not a single line, and I've never been a greater painter than in those moments. When the dear valley steams around me and the high sun rests on the surface of the impenetrable darkness of my forest, and only a few rays steal into the inner sanctuary, I then lie in the high grass by the falling brook, and closer to the earth a thousand diverse ones Graschen get strange to me; when I feel the swarming of the small world between the stalks, the innumerable, unfathomable shapes of the little worms, the little gnats closer to my heart, and feel the presence of the Almighty who created us in his image, the wafting of the All-loving One who brings us in eternal bliss floating carries and receives; my friend! when it's twilight around my eyes, and the world around me and heaven rest completely in my soul like the figure of a lover - then I often long and think: Oh, could you express that again, could you breathe that into the paper lives so fully, so warmly in you that it would become the mirror of your soul, just as your soul is the mirror of the infinite God! – My friend – But I perish, I succumb to the power of the splendor of these apparitions.","My whole being is filled with a marvelous gaiety, like the sweet spring mornings that I enjoy with all my heart. I am alone and glad to be alive in surroundings such as these, which were created for a soul like mine. I am so happy, best of friends, and so utterly absorbed by the sensations of a peaceful existence that my work suffers from it. I couldn’t draw now, not a line, yet was never a better painter. When the mists in my beloved valley steam all around me; when the sun rests on the surface of the impenetrable depths of my forest at noon and only single rays steal into the inner sanctum; when I lie in the tall grass beside a rushing brook and become aware of the remarkable diversity of a thousand little growing things on the ground, with all their peculiarities; when I can feel the teeming of a minute world amid the blades of grass and the innumerable, unfathomable shapes of worm and insect closer to my heart and can sense the presence of the Almighty, who in a state of continuous bliss bears and sustains us—then, my friend, when it grows light before my eyes and the world around me and the sky above come to rest wholly within my soul like a beloved, I am filled often with yearning and think, if only I could express it all on paper, everything that is housed so richly and warmly within me, so that it might be the mirror of my soul as my soul is the mirror of Infinite God…ah, my dear friend…but I am ruined by it. I succumb to its magnificence.","A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.   I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.   I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.   When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!   O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!"

"Wie er mit sich in ewigem Unfrieden lebte, schien ihm auch der Zustand andrer nur bedenklicher und verworrner, er glaubte, das schöne Verhältnis zwischen Albert und seiner Gattin gestört zu haben, er machte sich Vorwürfe darüber, in die sich ein heimlicher Unwille gegen den Gatten mischte.","As he lived in perpetual strife with himself, the condition of others only seemed more precarious and confused to him, he thought he had disturbed the beautiful relationship between Albert and his wife, he blamed himself for it, which was a secret dislike of his husband mixed.","Since he lived in a state of continual dissatisfaction with himself, the condition of others appeared to him as dubious and confused, too. He felt that he had disturbed the good relationship between Albert and Lotte and reproached himself on this score, and a secret resentment against Albert crept into his confusion.","As he now never enjoyed internal peace, the condition of his fellow creatures was to him a perpetual source of trouble and distress. He believed he had disturbed the happiness of Albert and his wife; and, whilst he censured himself strongly for this, he began to entertain a secret dislike to Albert."
"»Wer sich das nur täglich sagte:« rief ich aus, »du vermagst nichts auf deine Freunde, als ihnen ihre Freuden zu lassen und ihr Glück zu vermehren, indem du es mit ihnen genießest.

Can you give them a little comfort when they are tormented by fear?,"""We should daily repeat to ourselves,"" I exclaimed, ""that we should not interfere with our friends, unless to leave them in possession of their own joys, and increase their happiness by sharing it with them!   But when their souls are tormented by a violent passion, or their hearts rent with grief, is it in your power to afford them the slightest consolation?"
"Sie ist mir heilig. Alle Begier schweigt in ihrer Gegenwart.

Es ist ihr Leiblied, und mich stellt es von aller Pein, Verwirrung und Grillen her, wenn sie nur die erste Note davon greift.","She is sacred to me. All desire is silent in her presence. I never know how I feel when I'm with her; it's as if my soul turned around in all my nerves. – She has a melody that she plays on the piano with the power of an angel, so simple and so witty!

"Beim dritten englischen Tanz waren wir das zweite Paar. Wie wir die Reihe durchtanzten und ich, weiß Gott mit wieviel Wonne, an ihrem Arm und Auge hing, das voll vom wahrsten Ausdruck des offensten, reinsten Vergnügens war, kommen wir an eine Frau, die mir wegen ihrer liebenswürdigen Miene auf einem nicht mehr ganz jungen Gesichte merkwürdig gewesen war. Sie sieht Lotten lächelnd an, hebt einen drohenden Finger auf und nennt den Namen Albert zweimal im Vorbeifliegen mit viel Bedeutung.","At the third English dance we were the second couple. As we danced through the row and I, God knows with how much bliss, clung to her arm and eye that was full of the truest expression of the most frank, purest pleasure, we come upon a woman who, because of her amiable expression, no longer quite had been strange in young faces. She smiles at Lotte, raises a threatening finger, and mentions the name Albert twice in passing, with great significance.","During the third quadrille, we were the second couple. As we danced down the row I was conscious of nothing but her arm in mine and the look on her face, which was so frankly suffused with the purest pleasure. We passed a woman who had attracted my attention before because of the kindly expression on a face no longer young. She looked at Lotte, lifted a warning finger and, as we flew by, said the name “Albert” twice, with emphasis.","We were the second couple in the third country dance.   As we were going down (and Heaven knows with what ecstasy I gazed at her arms and eyes, beaming with the sweetest feeling of pure and genuine enjoyment), we passed a lady whom I had noticed for her charming expression of countenance; although she was no longer young.   She looked at Charlotte with a smile, then, holding up her finger in a threatening attitude, repeated twice in a very significant tone of voice the name of ""Albert."""

"Albert ist angekommen, und ich werde gehen; und wenn er der beste, der edelste Mensch wäre, unter den ich mich[41] in jeder Betrachtung zu stellen bereit wäre, so wär's unerträglich, ihn vor meinem Angesicht im Besitz so vieler Vollkommenheiten zu sehen. – Besitz! – Genug, Wilhelm, der Bräutigam ist da! Ein braver, lieber Mann, dem man gut sein muß. Glücklicherweise war ich nicht beim Empfange! Das hätte mir das Herz zerrissen. Auch ist er so ehrlich und hat Lotten in meiner Gegenwart noch nicht ein einzigmal geküßt. Das lohn' ihm Gott! Um des Respekts willen, den er vor dem Mädchen hat, muß ich ihn lieben. Er will mir wohl, und ich vermute, das ist Lottens Werk mehr als seiner eigenen Empfindung; denn darin sind die Weiber fein und haben recht; wenn sie zwei Verehrer in gutem Vernehmen mit einander erhalten können, ist der Vorteil immer ihr, so selten es auch angeht.","Albert has arrived and I will go; and if he were the best, the noblest man under whom I were ready to place myself in every consideration, it would be unbearable to see him before my face possessed of so many perfections. - Possession! – Enough, Wilhelm, the bridegroom is here! A good, dear man, whom one must be good to. Luckily I wasn't at the reception! That would have broken my heart. He's also so honest and hasn't kissed Lotte once in my presence. God reward him for that! For the respect he has for the girl, I must love him. He wants me well, and I suspect that it is Lotten's doing more than his own feeling; for in this women are fine and right; if they can get two suitors on good terms with each other, the advantage is always theirs, rare as it may be.","He might be the best, the most noble man in the world, and I would be glad to subordinate myself to him in any capacity whatsoever, but I would find it insufferable to see him take possession of so much perfection. To take possession…let it suffice, William…her betrothed has returned—a worthy, kindly man whom one simply has to like. Fortunately, I was not present when he arrived; it would have torn my heart to shreds. And he is an honorable man. Not once has he kissed Lotte in my presence. May God reward him for it! And I have to love him for the way he respects the girl. He seems to like me and I have the feeling that I have Lotte to thank for this rather than any impression of his own, because in things like that women have great intuition and they are right—it is always to their advantage to keep two admirers in harmony with each other, however rarely it may occur.","Albert is arrived, and I must take my departure.   Were he the best and noblest of men, and I in every respect his inferior, I could not endure to see him in possession of such a perfect being. Possession! -- enough, Wilhelm:   her betrothed is here, -- a fine, worthy fellow, whom one cannot help liking.   Fortunately I was not present at their meeting.   It would have broken my heart!   And he is so considerate : he has not given Charlotte one kiss in my presence.   Heaven reward him for it!   I must love him for the respect with which he treats her.   He shows a regard for me, but for this I suspect I am more indebted to Charlotte than to his own fancy for me.   Women have a delicate tact in such matters, and it should be so.   They cannot always succeed in keeping two rivals on terms with each other; but, when they do, they are the only gainers."

So oft hatte ich hier gestanden mit ihr und eben dem herrlichen Schauspiele zugesehen, und nun – Ich ging in der Allee auf und ab, die mir so lieb war; ein geheimer sympathetischer Zug hatte mich hier so oft gehalten, ehe ich noch Lotten kannte, und wie freuten wir uns, als wir im Anfang unserer Bekanntschaft die wechselseitige Neigung zu diesem Plätzchen entdeckten, das wahrhaftig eins von den romantischsten ist, die ich von der Kunst hervorgebracht gesehen habe.","Albert had promised me that he would be in the garden with Lotte right after supper. I stood on the terrace under the tall chestnut trees and watched the sun set for the last time over the lovely valley, over the gentle river. So often had I stood here with her and just watched the wonderful spectacle, and now - I walked up and down the avenue that was so dear to me; a secret sympathetic trait had kept me here so often before I even knew Lotte, and how delighted we were when, at the beginning of our acquaintance, we discovered our mutual attraction to this place, which is truly one of the most romantic that I know of in art seen brought forth.","Albert had promised me that he and Lotte would come out into the garden after supper.

"Sie saß nun allein, keins von ihren Geschwistern war um sie, sie überließ sich ihren Gedanken, die stille über ihren Verhältnissen herumschweiften. Sie sah sich nun mit dem Mann auf ewig verbunden, dessen Liebe und Treue sie kannte, dem sie von Herzen zugetan war, dessen Ruhe, dessen Zuverlässigkeit recht vom Himmel dazu bestimmt zu sein schien, daß eine wackere Frau das Glück ihres Lebens darauf gründen sollte; sie fühlte, was er ihr und ihren Kindern auf immer sein würde. Auf der andern Seite war ihr Werther so teuer geworden, gleich von dem ersten Augenblick ihrer Bekanntschaft an hatte sich die Übereinstimmung ihrer Gemüter so schön gezeigt, der lange dauernde Umgang mit ihm, so manche durchlebte Situationen hatten einen unauslöschlichen Eindruck auf ihr Herz gemacht. Alles, was sie Interessantes fühlte und dachte, war sie gewohnt mit ihm zu teilen, und seine Entfernung drohete in ihr ganzes Wesen eine Lücke zu reißen, die nicht wieder ausgefüllt werden konnte. O, hätte sie ihn in dem Augenblick zum Bruder umwandeln können, wie glücklich wäre sie gewesen! Hätte sie ihn einer ihrer Freundinnen verheiraten dürfen, hätte sie hoffen können, auch sein Verhältnis gegen Albert ganz wieder herzustellen![106]","She was sitting alone now, none of her siblings were around her, she was left to her thoughts, which were silently wandering about her circumstances. She now saw herself eternally bound to the man whose love and loyalty she knew, to whom she was devoted from the heart, whose calmness, whose reliability seemed to be destined by heaven that a brave woman should base the happiness of her life on it ; she felt what he would always be to her and her children. On the other hand, Werther had become so dear to her, right from the first moment of their acquaintance the agreement of their minds had shown itself so beautifully, the long-lasting dealings with him, so many situations they had lived through had left an indelible impression on their hearts. Anything interesting she felt and thought she was used to sharing with him, and his removal threatened to tear a void in her whole being that could not be filled again. Oh, if she could have made him a brother at that moment, how happy she would have been! If she had been allowed to marry him off to one of her friends, she could have hoped to restore his relationship with Albert completely![106]","Lotte was alone, and she was thinking quietly about their dilemma. She saw herself tied forever to a man with whose love and loyalty she was by now thoroughly familiar. She was devoted to him; his serenity and reliability—attributes on which any good woman could build her life’s happiness—seemed heaven-sent. She realized only too well what part he would always play in her life, and that of her children. But Werther had come to mean a great deal to her. From the first moment of their acquaintance, the harmony of their spirits had been very evident, and her long association with him and several experiences they had shared had made indelible impressions on her heart. She was accustomed to sharing everything that interested her with him, and his loss threatened to tear a gap into her life that she feared could never again be closed. If only she could have turned him into a brother at this point, how happy it would have made her! Or if she could have married him off to one of her friends…. If only she could have hoped that there might be a chance of his former good relationship with Albert being restored!","Charlotte was sitting alone.   None of her family were near, and she gave herself up to the reflections that silently took possession of her mind.   She was for ever united to a husband whose love and fidelity she had proved, to whom she was heartily devoted, and who seemed to be a special gift from Heaven to ensure her happiness. On the other hand, Werther had become dear to her.   There was a cordial unanimity of sentiment between them from the very first hour of their acquaintance, and their long association and repeated interviews had made an indelible impression upon her heart.   She had been accustomed to communicate to him every thought and feeling which interested her, and his absence threatened to open a void in her existence which it might be impossible to fill.   How heartily she wished that she might change him into her brother, -- that she could induce him to marry one of her own friends, or could reestablish his intimacy with Albert."

"Warum zaudert mein Salgar? Hat er sein Wort vergessen? – Da ist der Fels und der Baum und hier der rauschende Strom! Mit einbrechender Nacht versprachst du hier zu sein; ach! wohin hat sich mein Salgar verirrt? Mit dir wollt' ich fliehen, verlassen Vater und Bruder, die stolzen! Lange sind unsere Geschlechter Feinde, aber wir sind keine Feinde, o Salgar!","Why is my salgar dithering? Did he forget his word? – There is the rock and the tree and here the rushing stream! By nightfall you promised to be here; Oh! where has my salgar gone? I wanted to flee with you, leave the proud father and brother! Long are our families enemies, but we are not enemies, O Salgar!","“‘Why does he hesitate, Salgar, my beloved? Has he forgot his promise? There is the rock, and there is the tree, and here is the rushing stream. Oh, where has my Salgar lost his way? “‘Thou didst promise to be here at nightfall.

Our tribes have been enemies for so long, but thou and I, Salgar, we are not enemies.","Why delays my Salgar; why the chief of the hill his promise? Here is the rock and here the tree! here is the roaring stream! Thou didst promise with night to be here.   Ah! whither is my Salgar gone?

"Ich hatte mich etwa eine halbe Stunde in den schmachtenden, süßen Gedanken des Abscheidens, des Wiedersehens geweidet, als ich sie die Terrasse heraufsteigen hörte. Ich lief ihnen entgegen, mit einem Schauer faßte ich ihre Hand und küßte sie. Wir waren eben heraufgetreten, als der Mond hinter dem buschigen Hügel aufging; wir redeten mancherlei und kamen unvermerkt dem düstern Kabinette näher. Lotte trat hinein und setzte sich, Albert neben sie, ich auch; doch meine Unruhe ließ mich nicht lange sitzen; ich stand auf, trat vor sie, ging auf und ab, setzte mich wieder: es war ein ängstlicher Zustand. Sie machte uns aufmerksam auf die schöne Wirkung des Mondenlichtes, das am Ende der Buchenwände die ganze Terrasse vor uns erleuchtete: ein herrlicher Anblick, der um so viel frappanter war, weil uns rings eine tiefe Dämmerung einschloß. Wir waren still, und sie fing nach einer Weile an: »Niemals gehe ich im Mondenlichte spazieren, niemals, daß mir nicht der Gedanke an meine Verstorbenen begegnete, daß nicht das Gefühl von Tod, von Zukunft über mich käme. Wir werden sein!« fuhr sie mit der Stimme des herrlichsten Gefühls fort; »aber, Werther, sollen wir uns wieder finden? wieder erkennen? Was ahnen Sie? Was sagen Sie?«","I had been luxuriating in languid, sweet thoughts of parting, of meeting again, for about half an hour when I heard her coming up the terrace. I ran to meet them, grabbed her hand with a shudder and kissed it. We had just stepped up when the moon rose behind the bushy hill; we talked a great deal and unnoticed came closer to the gloomy cabinet. Lotte went in and sat down, Albert next to her, me too; but my restlessness did not let me sit for long; I got up, went in front of her, walked up and down, sat down again: it was an anxious state. She drew our attention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight, which, at the end of the beech walls, illuminated the whole terrace in front of us: a magnificent sight that was all the more striking because a deep twilight surrounded us all around. We were quiet, and after a while she began: ""I never go for a walk in the moonlight, never that the thought of my deceased should not occur to me, that the feeling of death, of the future, would not come over me. We shall be!' she went on, in the voice of the most glorious feeling; “But, Werther, shall we find each other again? recognize? What do you guess? What do you say?""","I had languished for about half an hour in the bitter-sweet thought of reunion and separation when I heard the two of them coming up the terrace steps. I ran to meet them, and I shivered as I took her hand and kissed it. We reached the terrace just as the moon rose above the wooded hills. We talked about this and that and without noticing it, drew nearer to the gloomy enclosure. Lotte entered it and sat down; Albert sat on one side of her, I on the other. But I could not remain seated; I was much too restless. So I rose and stood in front of them, walked up and down, sat down again. I was in a miserable state. Lotte drew our attention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight. Beyond the beeches, it was illuminating the entire terrace for us, a marvelous sight, made all the more striking by the fact that we were sitting in profound darkness. We were silent, and after a little while she said, “I never walk in the moonlight, never, without being reminded of my dead. In the moonlight I am always filled with a sense of death and of the hereafter. We live on”—and now she spoke with glorious feeling—“but, Werther, do we meet again? Shall we recognize each other? What do you feel? What do you believe?”","I had spent half an hour struggling between the contending thoughts of going and returning, when I heard them coming up the terrace. I ran to meet them.   I trembled as I took her hand, and kissed it. As we reached the top of the terrace, the moon rose from behind the wooded hill.   We conversed on many subjects, and, without perceiving it, approached the gloomy recess.   Charlotte entered, and sat down.   Albert seated himself beside her.   I did the same, but my agitation did not suffer me to remain long seated.   I got up, and stood before her, then walked backward and forward, and sat down again.   I was restless and miserable.   Charlotte drew our attention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight, which threw a silver hue over the terrace in front of us, beyond the beech trees. It was a glorious sight, and was rendered more striking by the darkness which surrounded the spot where we were.   We remained for some time silent, when Charlotte observed, ""Whenever I walk by moonlight, it brings to my remembrance all my beloved and departed friends, and I am filled with thoughts of death and futurity.   We shall live again, Werther!"" she continued, with a firm but feeling voice; ""but shall we know one another again what do you think? what do you say?"""
"»Das könnte man«, sagte er mit einem kalten Lachen, »drucken lassen und allen Hofmeistern empfehlen. Liebe Lotte! lassen Sie mir noch ein klein wenig Ruh, es wird alles werden!« – »Nur das, Werther, daß Sie nicht eher kommen als Weihnachtsabend!« – Er wollte antworten, und Albert trat in die Stube. Man bot sich einen frostigen Guten Abend und ging verlegen im Zimmer neben einander auf und nieder. Werther fing einen unbedeutenden Diskurs an, der bald aus war, Albert desgleichen, der sodann seine Frau nach gewissen Aufträgen fragte und, als er hörte, sie seien noch nicht ausgerichtet, ihr einige Worte sagte, die Werthern kalt, ja gar hart vorkamen. Er wollte gehen, er konnte nicht und zauderte bis acht, da sich denn sein Unmut und Unwillen immer vermehrte, bis der Tisch gedeckt wurde, und er Hut und Stock nahm. Albert lud ihn zu bleiben, er aber, der nur ein unbedeutendes Kompliment zu hören glaubte, dankte kalt dagegen und ging weg.","'One could,' he said with a cold laugh, 'have it printed and recommend it to all stewards. Dear Lotte! give me a little peace, everything will be fine!' - 'Only that, Werther, that you don't come before Christmas Eve!' - He wanted to answer, and Albert stepped into the living room. They bade each other a frosty good evening and walked up and down the room side by side in embarrassment. Werther began an insignificant discourse, which soon ended, as did Albert, who then asked his wife about certain commissions and, when he heard that they had not yet been arranged, said a few words to Werther that seemed cold, even harsh. He wanted to go, he couldn't, and he hesitated until eight, because his displeasure and indignation kept increasing, until the table was set and he took his hat and cane. Albert invited him to stay, but he, who thought he had heard only an insignificant compliment, thanked him coldly and left.","With a cold smile he replied, “That would look well in print and should be recommended to all tutors. Dear Lotte, give me a small respite, and all will be well.” “But just this one thing more, Werther—please do not come again before Christmas Eve.” He was about to reply when Albert entered the room. The men exchanged frosty greetings and walked up and down beside each other in some embarrassment. Werther started a desultory conversation that soon petered out; Albert did the same; then he asked his wife about a few things she was supposed to have attended to, and when he heard that they had not been done, he said something that, to Werther, sounded cold, even harsh. He wanted to leave, but couldn’t seem to do so. He hesitated until eight o’clock, his discouragement and resentment increasing constantly. When he at last took up his hat and cane, the table was already set for supper. Albert asked him to stay, but Werther, who felt that the man’s heart wasn’t in the invitation, thanked him coldly and left.","""This speech,"" replied Werther with a cold smile, ""this speech should be printed, for the benefit of all teachers.   My dear Charlotte, allow me but a short time longer, and all will be well."" ""But however, Werther,"" she added, ""do not come again before Christmas.""   He was about to make some answer, when Albert came in. They saluted each other coldly, and with mutual embarrassment paced up and down the room.   Werther made some common remarks; Albert did the same, and their conversation soon dropped.   Albert asked his wife about some household matters; and, finding that his commissions were not executed, he used some expressions which, to Werther's ear, savoured of extreme harshness.   He wished to go, but had not power to move; and in this situation he remained till eight o'clock, his uneasiness and discontent continually increasing. At length the cloth was laid for supper, and he took up his hat and stick.   Albert invited him to remain; but Werther, fancying that he was merely paying a formal compliment, thanked him coldly, amd left the house."
"Was ich dir neulich von der Malerei sagte, gilt gewiß auch von der Dichtkunst; es ist nur, daß man das Vortreffliche erkenne und es auszusprechen wage, und das ist freilich mit wenigem viel gesagt. Ich habe heute eine Szene gehabt, die, rein abgeschrieben, die schönste Idylle von der Welt gäbe;[17] doch was soll Dichtung, Szene und Idylle? muß es denn immer gebosselt sein, wenn wir teil an einer Naturerscheinung nehmen sollen?","What I said to you the other day about painting certainly applies to poetry as well; it is only that one recognizes the excellent and dares to express it, and that is of course saying a lot with little. I had a scene today that, purely copied, would be the most beautiful idyll in the world;[17] but what's the point of poetry, scene and idyll? does it always have to be bogged down if we are to take part in a natural phenomenon?","What I said the other day about painting is true also of poetry. It is simply that one should recognize and try to express only what is excellent, and that is saying a great deal in a few words. Today I experienced something that, simply told, could be a beautiful idyll, but what is poetry, episode, and idyll? Must it always be patchwork when we participate in a revelation of nature?","What I have lately said of painting is equally true with respect to poetry.   It is only necessary for us to know what is really excellent, and venture to give it expression; and that is saying much in few words.   To-day I have had a scene, which, if literally related, would, make the most beautiful idyl in the world.   But why should I talk of poetry and scenes and idyls?   Can we never take pleasure in nature without having recourse to art?"

"Der vergebliche Versuch, den Werther zur Rettung des Unglücklichen gemacht hatte, war das letzte Auflodern der Flamme eines verlöschenden Lichtes; er versank nur desto tiefer in Schmerz und Untätigkeit; besonders kam er fast außer sich, als er hörte, daß man ihn vielleicht gar zum Zeugen gegen den Menschen, der sich nun aufs Leugnen legte, auffordern könnte.",The vain attempt which Werther had made to save the unfortunate man was the last blaze of the flame of a dying light; he only sank the deeper into pain and inactivity; he was particularly beside himself when he heard that he might even be asked to testify against the man who was now denying it.,"Werther’s vain effort to save the unfortunate man was the last flickering flame of a light that was dying. After it, he sank even deeper into pain and lassitude. He became especially overwrought when he heard that he might be asked to testify against the man, who now denied his guilt.","The vain attempt Werther had made to save the unhappy murderer was the last feeble glimmering of a flame about to be extinguished. He sank almost immediately afterward into a state of gloom and inactivity, until he was at length brought to perfect distraction by learning that he was to be summoned as a witness against the prisoner, who asserted his complete innocence."
"Aber wer sind, die dort unten liegen auf der Heide? – Mein Geliebter? Mein Bruder? – Redet, o meine Freunde! Sie antworten nicht. Wie geängstet ist meine Seele! – Ach sie sind tot!

"»Stern der dämmernden Nacht, schön funkelst du in Westen, hebst dein strahlend Haupt aus deiner Wolke, wandelst stattlich deinen Hügel hin. Wornach blickst du auf die Heide? Die stürmenden Winde haben sich gelegt; von ferne kommt des Gießbachs Murmeln; rauschende Wellen spielen am Felsen ferne; das Gesumme der Abendfliegen schwärmet übers Feld. Wornach siehst du, schönes Licht? Aber du lächelst und gehst, freudig umgeben dich die Wellen und baden dein liebliches Haar. Lebe wohl, ruhiger Strahl. Erscheine, du herrliches Licht von Ossians Seele!","»Star of the dawning night, you sparkle beautifully in the west, lift your radiant head from your cloud, walk stately towards your hill.

How do you look, beautiful light? But you smile and go, joyfully the waves surround you and bathe your lovely hair. Farewell, calm ray. Appear, thou glorious light of Ossian's soul!","“O star of night descendant! How fair is thy light in the west; how radiantly thy head rises above thy cloud, moving toward thy hill regally! What dost thou seek on the heath? The storm winds have subsided; from far off comes the murmur of the tumbling brook; surf plays on distant rock, and hum of evening insects swarms across the lea. O beautiful light, what dost thou seek? But thou dost only smile and leave, gaily encircled by riplets that lave thy lovely hair. Farewell, calm beam of light! Arise, O magnificent effulgence of Ossian’s soul!","""Star of descending night! fair is thy light in the west! thou liftest thy unshorn head from thy cloud; thy steps are stately on thy hill.   What dost thou behold in the plain?   The stormy winds are laid.   The murmur of the torrent comes from afar.   Roaring waves climb the distant rock.   The flies of evening are on their feeble wings: the hum of their course is on the field.   What dost thou behold, fair light?   But thou dost smile and depart.   The waves come with joy around thee: they bathe thy lovely hair. Farewell, thou silent beam!   Let the light of Ossian's soul arise!"
"Hier, Lotte! Ich schaudre nicht, den kalten, schrecklichen Kelch zu fassen, aus dem ich den Taumel des Todes trinken soll! Du reichtest mir ihn, und ich zage nicht. All! all! So sind alle die Wünsche und Hoffnungen meines Lebens erfüllt! So kalt, so starr an der ehernen Pforte des Todes anzuklopfen.","Here, Lotte! I do not shudder to grasp the cold, terrible cup from which I shall drink the rapture of death! You handed it to me and I don't hesitate. Alles! Alles! So all the wishes and hopes of my life are fulfilled! To knock so coldly, so rigidly, at death's iron gate.","Here, Lotte…see, it does not make me shudder to grasp the cold and terrible cup from which I shall drink the transport of death. You hand it to me, and I do not hesitate. All! All of it! Thus all the wishes and hopes I had of life are fulfilled…to knock so coldly, so rigidly, on the brazen gates of death.","Then let me be laid in some remote valley, or near the highway, where the priest and Levite may bless themselves as they pass by my tomb, whilst the Samaritan will shed a tear for my fate. ""See, Charlotte, I do not shudder to take the cold and fatal cup, from which I shall drink the draught of death.   Your hand presents it to me, and I do not tremble.   All, all is now concluded: the wishes and the hopes of my existence are fulfilled.   With cold, unflinching hand I knock at the brazen portals of Death.  "
"Wenn ich zum Tor hinausgehe, den Weg, den ich zum erstenmal fuhr, Lotten zum Tanze zu holen, wie war das so ganz anders! Alles, alles ist vorübergegangen! Kein Wink der vorigen Welt, kein Pulsschlag meines damaligen Gefühles. Mir ist es, wie es einem Geiste sein müßte, der in das ausgebrannte, zerstörte Schloß zurückkehrte, das er als blühender Fürst einst gebaut und mit allen Gaben der Herrlichkeit ausgestattet, sterbend seinem geliebten Sohne hoffnungsvoll hinterlassen hätte.","When I go out through the gate, the way I drove for the first time, to get Lotte to dance, how different it was! Everything, everything has passed! No hint of the previous world, no pulse of my feelings at that time. It feels to me how it must be for a spirit to return to the burned-out, ruined castle which, as a flourishing prince, he once built and endowed with all the gifts of glory, dying would have left hopefully to his beloved son.","When I walk out of the gate, the way I drove when I went to fetch Lotte for the dance—how different things were then! All past, all over and done with! Not a trace left of that bygone world, not a heartbeat of my former emotions. I feel like a ghost who returns to the burnt-out, ruined castle he built when he was a virile prince, and furnished with all the treasure of a glorious life, and left hopefully to his beloved son.","When I pass through the same gate, and walk along the same road which first conducted me to Charlotte, my heart sinks within me at the change that has since taken place.   All, all, is altered! No sentiment, no pulsation of my heart, is the same.   My sensations are such as would occur to some departed prince whose spirit should return to visit the superb palace which he had built in happy times, adorned with costly magnificence, and left to a beloved son, but whose glory he should find departed, and its halls deserted and in ruins."
"Ich gehe an dem Wasser hin in der Mittagsstunde, ich hatte keine Lust zu essen. Alles war öde, ein naßkalter Abendwind blies vom Berge, und die grauen Regenwolken zogen das Tal hinein. Von fern seh' ich einen Menschen in einem grünen, schlechten Rocke, der zwischen den Felsen herumkrabbelte und Kräuter zu suchen schien. Als ich näher zu ihm kam und er sich auf das Geräusch, das ich machte, herumdrehte, sah ich eine gar interessante Physiognomie, darin eine stille Trauer den Hauptzug machte, die aber sonst nichts als einen geraden guten Sinn ausdrückte; seine schwarzen Haare waren mit Nadeln in zwei Rollen gesteckt, und die übrigen in einen starken Zopf geflochten, der ihm den Rücken herunter hing. Da mir seine Kleidung einen Menschen von geringem Stande zu bezeichnen schien, glaubte ich, er würde es nicht übelnehmen, wenn ich auf seine Beschäftigung aufmerksam wäre, und daher fragte ich ihn, was er suchte? – »Ich suche«, antwortete er mit einem tiefen Seufzer, »Blumen – und finde keine.« – »Das ist auch die Jahrszeit nicht.« sagte ich lächelnd. – »Es gibt so viele Blumen.« sagte er, indem er zu mir herunterkam. »In meinem Garten sind Rosen und Jelängerjelieber zweierlei Sorten, eine hat mir mein Vater gegeben, sie wachsen wie Unkraut; ich suche schon zwei Tage darnach und kann sie nicht finden. Da haußen sind auch immer Blumen, gelbe und blaue und rote, und das Tausendgüldenkraut hat ein schönes Blümchen.[88] Keines kann ich finden.« – Ich merkte was Unheimliches, und drum fragte ich durch einen Umweg: »Was will Er denn mit den Blumen?« – Ein wunderbares, zuckendes Lächeln verzog sein Gesicht. »Wenn Er mich nicht verraten will«, sagte er, indem er den Finger auf den Mund drückte, »ich habe meinem Schatz einen Strauß versprochen.« – »Das ist brav.« sagte ich. – »O!« sagte er, »sie hat viel andere Sachen, sie ist reich.« – »Und doch hat sie Seinen Strauß lieb.« versetzte ich. – »O!« fuhr er fort, »sie hat Juwelen und eine Krone.« – »Wie heißt sie denn?« – »Wenn mich die Generalstaaten bezahlen wollten«, versetzte er, »ich wär' ein anderer Mensch! Ja, es war einmal eine Zeit, da mir es so wohl war! Jetzt ist es aus mit mir. Ich bin nun ...« Ein nasser Blick zum Himmel drückte alles aus. – »Er war also glücklich?« fragte ich. – »Ach ich wollte, ich wäre wieder so!« sagte er. »Da war mir es so wohl, so lustig, so leicht wie einem Fisch im Wasser!« – »Heinrich!« rief eine alte Frau, die den Weg herkam, »Heinrich, wo steckst du? Wir haben dich überall gesucht, komm zum Essen.« – »Ist das Euer Sohn?« fragt' ich, zu ihr tretend. – »Wohl, mein armer Sohn!« versetzte sie. »Gott hat mir ein schweres Kreuz aufgelegt.« – »Wie lange ist er so?« fragte ich. – »So stille«, sagte sie, »ist er nun ein halbes Jahr. Gott sei Dank, daß er nur so weit ist, vorher war er ein ganzes Jahr rasend, da hat er an Ketten im Tollhause gelegen. Jetzt tut er niemand nichts, nur hat er immer mit Königen und Kaisern zu schaffen. Er war ein so guter, stiller Mensch, der mich ernähren half, seine schöne Hand schrieb, und auf einmal wird er tiefsinnig, fällt in ein hitziges Fieber, daraus in Raserei, und nun ist er, wie Sie ihn sehen. Wenn ich Ihnen erzählen sollte, Herr ...« – Ich unterbrach den Strom ihrer Worte mit der Frage: »Was war denn das für eine Zeit, von der er rühmt, daß er so glücklich, so wohl darin gewesen sei?« – »Der törichte Mensch!« rief sie mit mitleidigem Lächeln, »da meint er die Zeit, da er von sich war, das rühmt er immer; das ist die Zeit, da er im Tollhause war, wo er nichts von sich wußte.« – Das fiel mir auf wie ein Donnerschlag, ich drückte ihr ein Stück Geld in die Hand und verließ sie eilend.[89]","I go to the water at midday, I didn't feel like eating. Everything was desolate, a cold, damp evening wind blew from the mountain, and the gray rain clouds drew in the valley. From afar I see a man in a bad green coat who was crawling around between the rocks and seemed to be looking for herbs. As I came nearer to him and he turned round at the noise I was making, I saw a most interesting physiognomy in which a quiet sadness made the main feature, but which otherwise expressed nothing but a straight good sense; his black hair was pinned into two coils, and the rest braided into a strong plait that hung down his back. As his dress seemed to me to indicate a man of low rank, I thought he would not mind my noticing his occupation, and so I asked him what he was looking for? - ""I'm looking for,"" he answered with a deep sigh, ""flowers - and can't find any."" - ""It's not the season either,"" I said, smiling. - ""There are so many flowers,"" he said, coming down to me. »In my garden there are two kinds of roses and jellyfish, my father gave me one, they grow like weeds; I've been looking for it for two days and can't find it. There are always flowers there, yellow and blue and red, and the centaury has a pretty little flower.[88] I can't find any.« – I noticed something uncanny, and so I asked in a roundabout way: »What does he want with the flowers?« – A wonderful, twitching smile twisted his face. ""If he doesn't want to betray me,"" he said, putting his finger to his mouth, ""I promised my sweetheart a bouquet."" ""That's good,"" I said. - ""Oh!"" he said, ""she has many other things, she is rich."" - ""And yet she loves his bouquet,"" I replied. - ""Oh!"" he continued, ""she has jewels and a crown."" - ""What is her name?"" - ""If the States-General wanted to pay me,"" he replied, ""I would be a different person! Yes, there was a time when I felt so good! It's over with me now. I'm now...' A wet look at the sky said it all. ""So he was happy?"" I asked. ""Oh, I wish I were like that again!"" he said. ""I felt so good, so merry, as easy as a fish in water!"" - ""Heinrich!"" cried an old woman who came along the path, ""Heinrich, where are you? We've been looking for you everywhere, come eat.” – “Is that your son?” I asked, stepping up to her. ""Well, my poor son!"" she replied. ""God has put a heavy cross on me."" - ""How long has he been like this?"" I asked. ""So quiet,"" she said, ""he's been half a year now. Thank God he's only gotten that far, before that he was mad for a whole year, lying in chains in a madhouse. Now he doesn't harm anyone, only he always has to deal with kings and emperors. He was such a good, quiet person who helped feed me, wrote his beautiful hand, and suddenly he became profound, fell into a violent fever, and from that into a frenzy, and now he is as you see him. If I should tell you, sir..."" - I interrupted the stream of her words with the question: ""What was that time about which he boasts that he was so happy, so comfortable in it?"" - "" The foolish man!"" she cried with a pitying smile, ""he means the time when he was on his own, he always boasts about that; that's the time when he was in the madhouse, where he knew nothing about himself.« - That struck me like a thunderbolt, I pressed a piece of money into her hand and left her in a hurry.[89]","At noon I was walking along the river. I didn’t feel like eating. It was a dreary day. A raw wind was blowing down from the mountains and gray rain clouds were rolling into the valley. Ahead of me, I could see a man in a shabby green coat, scrambling about among the rocks. I thought he was gathering herbs. As I drew nearer, and he, hearing me, turned around, I found myself looking into a most interesting face. Its main expression was a quiet sadness; otherwise it betrayed nothing but candor and honesty. His black hair was pinned up in two rolls; the rest hung in one thick braid down his back. Since, judging by his dress, he seemed to be a man of humble origin, I decided that he would not take offense if I chose to comment on what he was doing, so I asked him what he was looking for. With a deep sigh, he replied, “I am looking for flowers, but can find none.” “This is not the season for them,” I said, smiling. “But there are so many flowers,” he replied, moving down to my level. “I have roses in my garden, and honeysuckle, two kinds. My father gave me one. They grow like weeds. I have been looking for them for two days and cannot find them. And outside there are always flowers, yellow ones, blue and red ones—and centaury has such a pretty blossom. I can’t find any of them.” I could sense something mysterious, so I asked in a roundabout way, “ And what does he want to do with the flowers?” A bright, tremulous smile crossed his face. “If the gentleman won’t give me away,” he said, putting a finger to his lips, “I promised my sweetheart a bouquet.” “Now there’s a good man!” I said. “Oh, she has many other things,” he replied. “She is rich.” “And yet she likes his nosegay,” I said. “Oh,” he countered, “she has jewels and a crown.” “What is her name?” “If the Netherlands would only pay me,” he said, “it would make a changed man of me. Yes, yes, there was a time when I was very well off. Now that’s all over and done with. Now I am…” He turned his moist eyes skyward to express the rest. “So he was once a happy man?” I asked. “Ah, if only I could be like that again,” he replied. “How happy I used to feel in those days— so merry, like a fish in water.” “Henry!” cried an old woman who now came up the path. “Henry, where are you? We’ve been looking for you everywhere. Come and eat.” “Is that your son?” I asked, stepping forward. “Indeed he is my poor son,” she said. “God has given me a heavy cross to bear.” “How long has he been that way?” I asked. “Quiet like that,” she said, “he has been only for the past six months. God be thanked that he is as he is now. The year before, he was a raving maniac and they had to keep him chained in the madhouse. Now he does no harm, but he is always troubled, his kings and emperors on his mind. He was such a good, quiet lad who helped toward my support and could write a pretty hand, but suddenly he became despondent and fell into a violent fever, and from that into raving madness, and now he is as you see him. If I were to tell you, sir—” I interrupted her flood of words with the question, “What sort of time was it that he praises so highly, when he was so happy, so content?” “The fool,” she cried, with a pitying smile. “He means the time he was deranged, the time he spent in the madhouse, when he didn’t know what was going on around him—that’s the time he is forever praising so highly.” It struck me like a thunderbolt. I pressed a coin into her hand and hurried away.","About dinner-time I went to walk by the river-side, for I had no appetite.   Everything around seemed gloomy: a cold and damp easterly wind blew from the mountains, and black, heavy clouds spread over the plain.   I observed at a distance a man in a tattered coat: he was wandering among the rocks, and seemed to be looking for plants. When I approached, he turned round at the noise; and I saw that he had an interesting countenance in which a settled melancholy, strongly marked by benevolence, formed the principal feature. His long black hair was divided, and flowed over his shoulders. As his garb betokened a person of the lower order, I thought he would not take it ill if I inquired about his business; and I therefore asked what he was seeking.   He replied, with a deep sigh, that he was looking for flowers, and could find none.   ""But it is not the season,"" I observed, with a smile.   ""Oh, there are so many flowers!"" he answered, as he came nearer to me.   ""In my garden there are roses and honeysuckles of two sorts: one sort was given to me by my father! they grow as plentifully as weeds; I have been looking for them these two days, and cannot find them.   There are flowers out there, yellow, blue, and red; and that centaury has a very pretty blossom: but I can find none of them.""   I observed his peculiarity, and therefore asked him, with an air of indifference, what he intended to do with his flowers.   A strange smile overspread his countenance.   Holding his finger to his mouth, he expressed a hope that I would not betray him; and he then informed me that he had promised to gather a nosegay for his mistress.   ""That is right,"" said I.   ""Oh!"" he replied, ""she possesses many other things as well: she is very rich.""   ""And yet,"" I continued, ""she likes your nosegays.""   ""Oh, she has jewels and crowns!"" he exclaimed.   I asked who she was.   ""If the states-general would but pay me,"" he added, ""I should be quite another man. Alas! there was a time when I was so happy; but that is past, and I am now--""   He raised his swimming eyes to heaven.   ""And you were happy once?""   I observed.   ""Ah, would I were so still!"" was his reply.   ""I was then as gay and contented as a man can be.""   An old woman, who was coming toward us, now called out, ""Henry, Henry! where are you?   We have been looking for you everywhere: come to dinner.""   ""Is he your son?"" I inquired, as I went toward her. "" Yes,"" she said: ""he is my poor, unfortunate son.   The Lord has sent me a heavy affliction. ""   I asked whether he had been long in this state.   She answered, ""He has been as calm as he is at present for about six months.   I thank Heaven that he has so far recovered: he was for one whole year quite raving, and chained down in a madhouse.   Now he injures no one, but talks of nothing else than kings and queens.   He used to be a very good, quiet youth, and helped to maintain me; he wrote a very fine hand; but all at once he became melancholy, was seized with a violent fever, grew distracted, and is now as you see.   If I were only to tell you, sir-- ""   I interrupted her by asking what period it was in which he boasted of having been so happy.   ""Poor boy!"" she exclaimed, with a smile of cormpassion, ""he means the time when he was completely deranged, a time he never ceases to regret, when he was in the madhouse, and unconscious of everything. ""   I was thunderstruck: I placed a piece of money in her hand, and hastened away."
"Ich schrieb dir neulich, wie ich den Amtmann S.. habe kennen lernen, und wie er mich gebeten habe, ihn bald in seiner Einsiedelei oder vielmehr seinem kleinen Königreiche zu besuchen. Ich vernachlässigte das, und wäre vielleicht nie hingekommen, hätte mir der Zufall nicht den Schatz entdeckt, der in der stillen Gegend verborgen liegt.","I wrote to you the other day about how I met the bailiff S.. and how he asked me to visit him soon in his hermitage, or rather his little kingdom. I neglected it, and might never have got there if chance hadn't discovered the treasure hidden in the quiet area.","I wrote to you not long ago that I had made the acquaintance of Magistrate S. and how he asked me to visit him soon at his retreat, or rather, in his little private kingdom. I didn’t do anything about it at the time and might never have gone if chance had not given me the opportunity to discover what a treasure lay hidden in that quiet spot.","I mentioned to you the other day that I had become acquainted with S--, the district judge, and that he had invited me to go and visit him in his retirement, or rather in his little kingdom.   But I neglected going, and perhaps should never have gone, if chance had not discovered to me the treasure which lay concealed in that retired spot.  "
"Wir haben seit acht Tagen das abscheulichste Wetter, und mir ist es wohltätig. Denn so lang ich hier bin, ist mir noch kein schöner Tag am Himmel erschienen, den mir nicht jemand verdorben oder verleidet hätte. Wenn's nun recht regnet und stöbert und fröstelt und taut: Ha! denk' ich, kann's doch zu Hause nicht schlimmer werden, als es draußen ist, oder umgekehrt, und so ist's gut. Geht die Sonne des Morgens auf und verspricht einen feinen Tag, erwehr' ich mir niemals auszurufen: Da haben sie doch wieder ein himmlisches Gut, worum sie einander bringen können! Es ist nichts, worum sie einander nicht bringen. Gesundheit, guter Name, Freudigkeit, Erholung! Und meist aus Albernheit, Unbegriff und Enge und, wenn man sie anhört, mit der besten Meinung. Manchmal möcht' ich sie auf den Knieen bitten, nicht so rasend in ihre eigenen Eingeweide zu wüten.","We've had the most abominable weather for eight days, and it's beneficial to me. Because as long as I've been here, I haven't seen a beautiful day in the sky that someone hasn't ruined or spoiled for me. If it's raining and rummaging around and shivering and thawing: Ha! I think it can't be worse at home than it is outside, or vice versa, and that's fine. When the sun rises in the morning and promises a fine day, I never refrain from exclaiming: Here they have another heavenly good they can steal from each other! It's nothing they can't get each other to do. Health, good name, happiness, relaxation! And mostly out of silliness, incomprehension and narrowness and, if you listen to them, with the best of opinions. Sometimes I want to get on my knees and ask her not to rage so furiously in her own bowels.","For eight days now we have had the most terrible weather, and it does my heart good, because since I have been here we have not had a nice day that was not spoiled for me by someone. But if it rains and blusters, is chilly or thaws—ha! I tell myself that it can’t get worse inside than out, or if you like, the other way round, and that suits me. But if I see the sun rise in the morning, promising a fine day, I say to myself, “There they have another treasure to do each other out of.” There is nothing in this world, William, that they would not like to do each other out of—health, good repute, happiness, recreation—for the most part because they are foolish, narrow-minded, and dull-witted. You can listen to them with the best of open minds and come to no other conclusion. Sometimes I feel like falling on my knees and imploring them not to be so fanatically intent on cutting each other’s throats.","For a week past we have had the most wretched weather: but this to me is a blessing; for, during my residence here, not a single fine day has beamed from the heavens, but has been lost to me by the intrusion of somebody.   During the severity of rain, sleet, frost, and storm, I congratulate myself that it cannot be worse indoors than abroad, nor worse abroad than it is within doors; and so I become reconciled.   When the sun rises bright in the morning, and promises a glorious day, I never omit to exclaim, ""There, now, they have another blessing from Heaven, which they will be sure to destroy: they spoil everything, -- health, fame, happiness, amusement; and they do this generally through folly, ignorance, or imbecility, and always, according to their own account, with the best intentions!""   I could often beseech them, on my bended knees, to be less resolved upon their own destruction."
"Und wenn die letzte, bangste Krankheit dann über das Geschöpf herfällt, das du in blühenden Tagen untergraben hast, und sie nun daliegt in dem erbärmlichsten Ermatten, das Auge gefühllos gen Himmel sieht, der Todesschweiß[34] auf der blassen Stirne abwechselt, und du vor dem Bette stehst wie ein Verdammter, in dem innigsten Gefühl, daß du nichts vermagst mit deinem ganzen Vermögen, und die Angst dich inwendig krampft, daß du alles hingeben möchtest, dem untergehenden Geschöpfe einen Tropfen Stärkung, einen Funken Mut einflößen zu können.«","And when the last, most frightening disease then falls upon the creature that you undermined in blooming days, and she now lies there in the most miserable state of exhaustion, her eyes numbly looking up to the sky, the sweat of death[34] alternating on her pale forehead, and you standing in front of the bed like a damned man, in the deepest feeling that you can do nothing with all your wealth, and the fear cramps you inside, that you would like to give everything, to be able to give the perishing creature a drop of strength, a spark of courage.""","And when the poor creature, whose soul you undermined in fairer days, is struggling with his last, fateful illness and lies there pitiful in his exhaustion, looking up at the sky, all feeling spent, the dew of death on his pale brow, and you stand by his deathbed like one damned, with the profound feeling that with everything in your power you can do nothing to help, and you are gripped by a dreadful fear and would give anything in the world if only you could imbue his perishing soul with one ounce of strength…”","""And when the last fatal malady seizes the being whose untimely grave you have prepared, when she lies languid and exhausted before you, her dim eyes raised to heaven, and the damp of death upon her pallid brow, there you stand at her bedside like a condemned criminal, with the bitter feeling that your whole fortune could not save her; and the agonising thought wrings you, that all your efforts are powerless to impart even a moment's strength to the departing soul, or quicken her with a transitory consolation."""
"Ach wie mir das durch alle Adern läuft, wenn mein Finger unversehens den ihrigen berührt, wenn unsere Füße sich unter dem Tische begegnen! Ich ziehe zurück wie vom[38] Feuer, und eine geheime Kraft zieht mich wieder vorwärts – mir wird's so schwindelig vor allen Sinnen. – O! und ihre Unschuld, ihre unbefangne Seele fühlt nicht, wie sehr mich die kleinen Vertraulichkeiten peinigen. Wenn sie gar im Gespräch ihre Hand auf die meinige legt und im Interesse der Unterredung näher zu mir rückt, daß der himmlische Atem ihres Mundes meine Lippen erreichen kann: – ich glaube zu versinken, wie vom Wetter gerührt. – Und, Wilhelm! wenn ich mich jemals unterstehe, diesen Himmel, dieses Vertrauen –! Du verstehst mich. Nein, mein Herz ist so verderbt nicht! Schwach! schwach genug! – Und ist das nicht Verderben? –","Ah, how it runs through my veins when my finger unexpectedly touches hers, when our feet meet under the table! I pull back as if from a fire, and a secret force pulls me forward again - I get so dizzy with all my senses. - Oh! and her innocence, her impartial soul, does not feel how much the little intimacy torments me. Even if she puts her hand on mine during the conversation and moves closer to me in the interest of the conversation, so that the heavenly breath of her mouth can reach my lips: - I think I'm going to sink, as if moved by the weather. - And, William! if I ever dare, this sky, this trust—! You understand me. No, my heart is not so corrupt! Weak! weak enough! – And isn't that ruin? –","Oh, how wildly my blood courses through my veins when, by chance, my hand touches hers or our feet touch under the table! I start away as if from a fire, a mysterious power draws me back, and I become dizzy…and in her artlessness and innocence she has no idea how much such little intimacies torment me. When she puts her hand in mine in the course of a conversation and, absorbed by what we are talking about, draws closer to me, and the heavenly breath from her lips touches mine…then I feel I must sink to the ground as if struck by lightning. William, if ever I should presume to take advantage of this heaven on earth, this trust in me…you know what I mean. But I am not depraved. Weak, yes, weak God knows I am…and can this not be called depraved?","How my heart beats when by accident I touch her finger, or my feet meet hers under the table!   I draw back as if from a furnace; but a secret force impels me forward again, and my senses become disordered.   Her innocent, unconscious heart never knows what agony these little familiarities inflict upon me.   Sometimes when we are talking she Iays her hand upon mine, and in the eagerness of conversation comes closer to me, and her balmy breath reaches my lips, -- when I feel as if lightning had struck me, and that I could sink into the earth.   And yet, Wilhelm, with all this heavenly confidence, -- if I know myself, and should ever dare -- you understand me.   No, no!   my heart is not so corrupt , it is weak, weak enough but is not that a degree of corruption?"
"Die Kleinen ließen ihn nicht lange in Ruhe, sie verfolgten ihn, sprangen an ihm hinauf, erzählen ihm, daß, wenn morgen, und wieder morgen, und noch ein Tag wäre, sie die Christgeschenke bei Lotten holten, und erzählten ihm Wunder, die sich ihre kleine Einbildungskraft versprach. – »Morgen!« rief er aus, »und wieder morgen! und noch ein Tag!« – und küßte sie alle herzlich und wollte sie verlassen, als ihm der Kleine noch etwas in das Ohr sagen wollte. Der verriet ihm, die großen Brüder hätten schöne Neujahrswünsche geschrieben, so groß! und einen für den Papa, für Albert und Lotten einen und auch einen für Herrn Werther; die wollten sie am Neujahrstage früh überreichen. Das übermannte ihn, er schenkte jedem etwas, setzte sich zu Pferde, ließ den Alten grüßen und ritt mit Tränen in den Augen davon.","The little ones didn't leave him alone for long, they followed him, jumped up on him, told him that if tomorrow were to come, tomorrow again, and one more day, they would get the Christmas presents from Lotte and told him about the miracles that were happening her little imagination promised. - ""Tomorrow!"" he exclaimed, ""and again tomorrow! and one more day!” – and kissed them all warmly and was about to leave when the little one wanted to say something else in his ear. He told him that the big brothers had written nice New Year's wishes, so big! and one for Papa, one for Albert and Lotten and also one for Herr Werther; they wanted to hand it over early on New Year's Day. This overwhelmed him, he gave everyone something, got on his horse, said hello to the old man and rode away with tears in his eyes.","The children didn’t leave him in peace for long. They followed him, jumped around him, chattering about how, after tomorrow and one more tomorrow and one more day after that, it would be time for them to fetch their Christmas presents from Lotte. They talked about all the marvelous things that came to their childlike minds. “Tomorrow!” he cried. “And another tomorrow, and one more day!” Then he kissed all of them tenderly and was about to leave when the littlest one had to whisper something in his ear. He betrayed the fact that his older brother had already written their New Year greetings, so big! One for Papa, one for Albert and Lotte, and one for Herr Werther. Early on New Year’s Day they intended to distribute them. The news was too much for Werther. He gave each of the children something, mounted his horse, left greetings for the old gentleman, and rode off, his eyes blinded by tears.","The children did not suffer him to remain alone long.   They followed him, skipping and dancing before him, and told him, that after to-morrow and tomorrow and one day more, they were to receive their Christmas gift from Charlotte; and they then recounted all the wonders of which they had formed ideas in their child imaginations. "" Tomorrow and tomorrow,"" said he, ""and one day more!""   And he kissed them tenderly.   He was going; but the younger boy stopped him, to whisper something in his ear.   He told him that his elder brothers had written splendid New-Year's wishes so large! one for papa, and another for Albert and Charlotte, and one for Werther; and they were to be presented early in the morning, on New Year's Day.   This quite overcame him.   He made each of the children a present, mounted his horse, left his compliments for papa and mamma, and, with tears in his eyes, rode away from the place."
"Wie schwer lag jetzt, was sie sich in dem Augenblick nicht deutlich machen konnte, die Stockung auf ihr, die sich unter ihnen festgesetzt hatte! So verständige, so gute Menschen fingen wegen gewisser heimlicher Verschiedenheiten unter einander zu schweigen an, jedes dachte seinem Recht und dem Unrechte des andern nach, und die Verhältnisse verwickelten und verhetzten sich dergestalt, daß es unmöglich ward, den Knoten eben in dem kritischen Momente, von dem alles abhing, zu lösen. Hätte eine glückliche Vertraulichkeit sie früher wieder einander näher gebracht, wäre Liebe und Nachsicht wechselsweise unter ihnen lebendig worden und hätte ihre Herzen aufgeschlossen, vielleicht wäre unser Freund noch zu retten gewesen.","How heavy it was now, which she couldn't make clear to herself at the moment, the stagnation that had settled among them! Such sensible, such good people began to keep silent among themselves because of certain secret differences, each thought about his right and the wrong of the other, and the circumstances became so complicated and agitated that it became impossible to tie the knot at the critical moment on which everything depended to be solved. If a happy intimacy had brought them closer together sooner, if love and forbearance had alternated between them and opened their hearts, perhaps our friend could still have been saved.","The estrangement which had closed in upon all three of them weighed heavily upon her now, but it was something she could not see clearly at the moment. Good, sensible people often withdraw from one another because of secret differences, each becoming absorbed by what he feels is right, and by the error of the other. Conditions then grow more and more complicated and exasperating, until it becomes impossible to undo the knot at the crucial moment on which everything depends. If only a fortunate intimacy had brought them closer again before this, if only they could have felt love and consideration for one another mutually, and confided in one another, Werther might have been saved.","A recollection of that mysterious estrangement which had lately subsisted between herself and Albert, and which she could never thoroughly understand, was now beyond measure painful to her. Even the prudent and the good have before now hesitated to explain their mutual differences, and have dwelt in silence upon their imaginary grievances, until circumstances have become so entangled, that in that critical juncture, when a calm explanation would have saved all parties, an understanding was impossible.   And thus if domestic confidence had been earlier established between them, if love and kind forbearance had mutually animated and expanded their hearts, it might not, perhaps, even yet have been too late to save our friend."
"Da er durch die Linden mußte, um nach der Schenke zu kommen, wo sie den Körper hingelegt hatten, entsetzt' er sich vor dem sonst so geliebten Platze. Jene Schwelle, worauf die Nachbarskinder so oft gespielt hatten, war mit Blut besudelt. Liebe und Treue, die schönsten menschlichen Empfindungen, hatten sich in Gewalt und Mord verwandelt. Die starken Bäume standen ohne Laub und bereift, die schönen Hecken, die sich über die niedrige Kirchhofmauer wölbten, waren entblättert, und die Grabsteine sahen mit Schnee bedeckt durch die Lücken hervor.","Since he had to go through the linden trees to get to the tavern where they had laid the body, he was horrified at the place he otherwise loved. That threshold, on which the neighborhood children had so often played, was soiled with blood. Love and fidelity, the most beautiful human feelings, had turned into violence and murder. The strong trees stood leafless and frosted, the beautiful hedges that arched over the low churchyard wall were bare of leaves, and the tombstones, covered with snow, peeped through the gaps.","He had to pass under the linden trees to get to the inn where the body had been laid out and was horrified when he saw the beloved spot. Where the neighbor’s children had played once it was befouled with blood. Love and faithfulness—the most beautiful human emotions—had been transformed into violence and murder. The sturdy trees stood barren and thick with hoarfrost; the pretty hedges, arched over the low wall of the churchyard, were leafless; the snowcapped gravestones were visible through the gaps.","His way took him past the well-known lime trees, to the house where the body had been carried; and his feelings were greatly excited at the sight of the fondly recollected spot.   That threshold where the neighbours' children had so often played together was stained with blood; love and attachment, the noblest feelings of human nature, had been converted into violence and murder.   The huge trees stood there leafless and covered with hoarfrost; the beautiful hedgerows which surrounded the old churchyard wall were withered; and the gravestones, half covered with snow, were visible through the openings."
"Sie war einige Tage verreist, Alberten abzuholen. Heute trat ich in ihre Stube, sie kam mir entgegen, und ich küßte ihre Hand mit tausend Freuden.","She had gone away for a few days to pick up Albert. Today I stepped into her room, she came towards me and I kissed her hand with a thousand joys.","She was away for a few days. She left to fetch Albert. Today I walked into her room, she came to meet me, and I kissed her hand, my heart overflowing with joy.","She has been absent for some days.   She went to meet Albert. To-day I visited her: she rose to receive me, and I kissed her hand most tenderly."
"Als er sich der Schenke näherte, vor welcher das ganze Dorf versammelt war, entstand auf einmal ein Geschrei. Man erblickte von fern einen Trupp bewaffneter Männer, und ein jeder rief, daß man den Täter herbeiführe. Werther sah hin und blieb nicht lange zweifelhaft. Ja, es war der Knecht, der jene Witwe so sehr liebte, den er vor einiger Zeit mit dem stillen Grimme, mit der heimlichen Verzweiflung umhergehend angetroffen hatte.","As he approached the tavern, in front of which the whole village was gathered, there was suddenly a shout. A troop of armed men could be seen from afar, and each one shouted that the perpetrator should be brought in. Werther looked and didn't remain in doubt for long. Yes, it was the servant who loved that widow so much, whom he had met some time ago walking about with quiet anger and secret despair.","As Werther approached the inn in front of which the whole village had assembled there was a sudden hubbub of voices. A group of armed men was approaching from a distance, shouting that they had the murderer. Werther saw him and at once his doubts were dispelled. It was the boy who had loved the widow so much, whom Werther had met some time ago in his tacit fury and despair.","As he approached the inn, in front of which the whole village was assembled, screams were suddenly heard.   A troop of armed peasants was seen approaching, and every one exclaimed that the criminal had been apprehended.   Werther looked, and was not long in doubt. The prisoner was no other than the servant, who had been formerly so attached to the widow, and whom he had met prowling about, with that suppressed anger and ill-concealed despair, which we have before described."
"So viel Einfalt bei so viel Verstand, so viel Güte bei so viel Festigkeit, und die Ruhe der Seele bei dem wahren Leben und der Tätigkeit. –","So much simplicity with so much understanding, so much goodness with so much firmness, and the calm of the soul in real life and activity. –","She is naïve yet very sensible; she is kind yet firm, and tranquillity personified as she goes about her daily tasks.","So much simplicity with so much understauding -- so mild, and yet so resolute -- a mind so placid, and a life so active."
"Noch nie war ich glücklicher, noch nie war meine Empfindung an der Natur, bis aufs Steinchen, aufs Gräschen herunter, voller und inniger, und doch – Ich weiß nicht, wie ich mich ausdrücken soll, meine vorstellende Kraft ist so[40] schwach, alles schwimmt und schwankt so vor meiner Seele, daß ich keinen Umriß packen kann; aber ich bilde mir ein, wenn ich Ton hätte oder Wachs, so wollte ich's wohl herausbilden. Ich werde auch Ton nehmen, wenn's länger währt, und kneten, und sollten's Kuchen werden!","Never have I been happier, never have my feelings about nature been fuller and more intimate, down to the little stone, down to the grass, and yet - I don't know how to express myself, my power of imagination is so [40] feeble, everything swims and sways so before my soul that I cannot grasp an outline; but I fancy that if I had clay or wax, I would probably work it out. I'll also take clay if it takes longer and knead it, and if it turns out to be cake!","I have never been happier. My appreciation of nature, down to the most insignificant stone or blade of grass, has never been more keen or profound, and yet…I don’t know how to explain it to you. My powers of expression are weak and everything is so hazy in my mind that all contours seem to elude me. I tell myself that if I had clay or wax, I could shape them. And if this mood prevails, I shall certainly get hold of some clay and model it, even if all I turn out is a patty cake!","I never felt happier, I never understood nature better, even down to the veriest stem or smallest blade of grass ; and yet I am unable to express myself: my powers of execution are so weak, everything seems to swim and float before me, so that I cannot make a clear, bold outline.   But I fancy I should succeed better if I had some clay or wax to model.   I shall try, if this state of mind continues much longer, and will take to modelling, if I only knead dough."
"Erath, der Sohn Odgals, grollte, denn sein Bruder lag erschlagen von Armar. Er kam, in einen Schiffer verkleidet. Schön war sein Nachen auf der Welle, weiß seine Locken vor Alter, ruhig sein ernstes Gesicht. ›Schönste der Mädchen,‹ sagte er, ›liebliche Tochter von Armin, dort am Felsen, nicht fern in der See, wo die rote Frucht vom Baume herblinkt, dort wartet Armar auf Daura; ich komme, seine Liebe zu führen über die rollende See.‹","Erath son of Odgal growled, for his brother lay slain by Armar. He came disguised as a boatman. His boat on the wave was beautiful, his curls white with age, his serious face calm.

He came disguised as a mariner, his locks white with age, his stern features calm. His bark crossing the waters was a beautiful sight. “Loveliest of maidens,” he cried, “fair daughter of Armin—on yonder rock in the sea, not far off, where thou canst see the red fruit sparkling on the tree, Armar is waiting for thee. I come to guide his beloved across the turgid sea.”","""Erath, son of Odgal, repined: his brother had been slain by Armar. He came disguised like a son of the sea: fair was his cliff on the wave, white his locks of age, calm his serious brow.   Fairest of women, he said, lovely daughter of Armin! a rock not distant in the sea bears a tree on its side; red shines the fruit afar.   There Armar waits for Daura.   I come to carry his love!"
"Wenn ich nicht schon hundertmal auf dem Punkte gestanden bin, ihr um den Hals zu fallen! Weiß der große Gott, wie einem das tut, so viele Liebenswürdigkeit vor einem herumkreuzen zu sehen und nicht zugreifen zu dürfen; und das Zugreifen ist doch der natürlichste Trieb der Menschheit. Greifen die Kinder nicht nach allem, was ihnen in den Sinn fällt? – Und ich?",If I haven't been on the point of throwing my arms around her a hundred times!

Don't the children reach for everything that comes to mind? - And me?,"A hundred times, at least, I have been on the point of taking her in my arms. The good Lord knows what it means to see so much graciousness passing to and fro before one’s eyes and not be allowed to grasp it, for grasping is the most natural urge of mankind. Don’t children try to grasp anything they can think of? And I?","One hundred times have I been on the point of embracing her. Heavens! what a torment it is to see so much loveliness passing and repassing before us, and yet not dare to lay hold of it! And laying hold is the most natural of human instincts.   Do not children touch everything they see?   And I!"
"Ein Blättchen, das sich darauf bezieht, das vielleicht sein ganzes Verhältnis zu Albert ausdrückt, finden wir unter seinen Papieren:","Among his papers we find a leaflet that refers to this, perhaps expressing his entire relationship to Albert:","A note referring to this, which perhaps expresses Werther’s entire relationship to Albert, was found among his papers.","A memorandum of Werther's upon this point, expressive of his general feelings toward Albert, has been found amongst his papers."
"So sehnt sich der unruhigste Vagabund zuletzt wieder nach seinem Vaterlande und findet in seiner Hütte, an der Brust seiner Gattin, in dem Kreise seiner Kinder, in den Geschäften zu ihrer Erhaltung die Wonne, die er in der weiten Welt vergebens suchte.","So the restless vagabond finally longs for his fatherland again and finds in his hut, on the breast of his wife, in the company of his children, in the business of their preservation, the happiness that he has sought in vain in the wide world.","Thus the most restless vagabond yearns in the end to return to his native land and find in his cottage, in the arms of his wife, with his children around him, and in the occupations that provide for them, the joys he sought vainly elsewhere.","So does the restless traveller pant for his native soil, and find in his own cottage, in the arms of his wife, in the affections of his children, and in the labour necessary for their support, that happiness which he had sought in vain through the wide world."
"Ach, sie schläft ruhig und denkt nicht, daß sie mich nie wieder sehen wird. Ich habe mich losgerissen, bin stark genug gewesen, in einem Gespräch von zwei Stunden mein Vorhaben nicht zu verraten. Und Gott, welch ein Gespräch!","Oh, she sleeps peacefully and doesn't think she'll never see me again. I broke free, I was strong enough not to reveal my intentions in a two-hour conversation. And god, what a conversation!","But she sleeps peacefully and has no idea that she will never see me again. I have succeeded in freeing myself, William, and found the strength, in the course of a conversation that lasted two hours, not to betray what was on my mind. And oh, dear God, what a conversation!","And she is sleeping calmly, little suspecting that she has seen me for the last time.   I am free.   I have had the courage, in an interview of two hours' duration, not to betray my intention.   And O Wilhelm, what a conversation it was!"
"Ich sage dir, mein Schatz, wenn meine Sinne gar nicht mehr halten wollen, so lindert all den Tumult der Anblick eines solchen Geschöpfs, das in glücklicher Gelassenheit den engen Kreis seines Daseins hingeht, von einem Tage zum andern sich durchhilft, die Blätter abfallen sieht und nichts dabei denkt, als daß der Winter kommt.","I tell you, my darling, when my senses give out, the sight of such a creature, happily serenely going about the narrow circle of its existence, easing itself from one day to the next, watching the leaves fall, soothes all the turmoil and thinks nothing but that winter is coming.","Let me tell you something, my dear fellow—when I no longer know how to contain myself, the sight of someone like that, who is content within the narrow confines of her existence, who knows how to get by from day to day, who, when she sees the leaves fall, thinks of nothing but that winter is coming…it stills the tumult in my heart.","I assure you, my dear friend, when my thoughts are all in tumult, the sight of such a creature as this tranquillises my disturbed mind.   She moves in a happy thoughtlessness within the confined circle of her existence; she supplies her wants from day to day; and, when she sees the leaves fall, they raise no other idea in her mind than that winter is approaching."
"Die geringen Leute des Ortes kennen mich schon und lieben mich, besonders die Kinder. Eine traurige Bemerkung hab' ich gemacht. Wie ich im Anfange mich zu ihnen gesellte, sie freundschaftlich fragte über dies und das, glaubten einige, ich wollte ihrer spotten, und fertigten mich wohl gar grob ab. Ich ließ mich das nicht verdrießen; nur fühlte ich, was ich schon oft bemerkt habe, auf das lebhafteste: Leute[10] von einigem Stande werden sich immer in kalter Entfernung vom gemeinen Volke halten, als glaubten sie durch Annäherung zu verlieren; und dann gibt's Flüchtlinge und üble Spaßvögel, die sich herabzulassen scheinen, um ihren Übermut dem armen Volke desto empfindlicher zu machen.","The little people of the place already know me and love me, especially the children. I made a sad remark. When I joined them at first and asked them amiably about this and that, some people thought I was mocking them and treated me rudely. I didn't let that bother me; only I felt what I have often remarked most vividly: People[10] of some status will always keep a cold distance from the common people, as if they thought they would lose by getting closer; and then there are fugitives and evil jesters who seem to condescend in order to make their arrogance all the more sensitive to the poor people.","The simple folk here already know me and seem to be fond of me, especially the children. At first, when I made efforts to join them and ask questions about this and that, a few thought I was making fun of them and were quite rude. But I didn’t let it bother me. I only felt keenly what I have noticed often—that persons of rank tend to keep their cold distance from the common man, as if they feared to lose something by such intimacy. And then, of course, there are those who shrink from all contact with simple people, and the tactless jokesters who talk down to them—they succeed only in making the poor souls more sharply aware than ever of their presumption.","The common people of the place know me already, and love me, particularly the children.   When at first I associated with them, and inquired in a friendly tone about their various trifles, some fancied that I wished to ridicule them, and turned from me in exceeding ill-humour.   I did not allow that circumstance to grieve me: I only felt most keenly what I have often before observed. Persons who can claim a certain rank keep themselves coldly aloof from the common people, as though they feared to lose their importance by the contact; whilst wanton idlers, and such as are prone to bad joking, affect to descend to their level, only to make the poor people feel their impertinence all the more keenly."
"Nun, mein Lieber, laß uns das auf den Geist anwenden. Sieh den Menschen an in seiner Eingeschränktheit, wie Eindrücke auf ihn wirken, Ideen sich bei ihm festsetzen, bis endlich eine wachsende Leidenschaft ihn aller ruhigen Sinneskraft beraubt und ihn zugrunde richtet.","Now, my dear, let's apply that to the mind. Look at people in their limitations, how impressions affect them, how ideas take root in them, until finally a growing passion robs them of all calm sensory power and ruins them.","Well, my dear fellow, let us apply this precept to the spirit of man. Look at man, with all his limitations—how impressions affect him, how ideas take hold of him until finally a passion grows within him to such an extent that it robs him of his peace of mind and ruins him.","""Now, my good friend, apply this to the mind; observe a man in his natural, isolated condition; consider how ideas work, and how impressions fasten on him, till at length a violent passion seizes him, destroying all his powers of calm reflection, and utterly ruining him."
"Sie stand auf, und ich ward erweckt und erschüttert, blieb sitzen und hielt ihre Hand. – »Wir wollen fort«, sagte sie, »es wird Zeit.« – Sie wollte ihre Hand zurückziehen, und ich hielt sie fester. – »Wir werden uns wieder sehen«, rief ich, »wir werden uns finden, unter allen Gestalten werden wir uns erkennen. Ich gehe«, fuhr ich fort, »ich gehe willig, und doch, wenn ich sagen sollte auf ewig, ich würde es nicht aushalten. Leb' wohl, Lotte! Leb' wohl, Albert! Wir sehn uns wieder.« – »Morgen, denke ich.« versetzte sie scherzend. – Ich fühlte das Morgen! Ach, sie wußte nicht, als sie ihre Hand aus der meinen zog –. Sie gingen die Allee hinaus, ich stand, sah ihnen nach im Mondscheine und warf mich an die Erde und weinte mich aus und sprang auf und lief auf die Terrasse hervor und sah noch dort unten im Schatten der hohen Lindenbäume ihr weißes Kleid nach der Gartentür schimmern, ich streckte meine Arme aus, und es verschwand.[59]","She got up and I was awakened and shaken and sat holding her hand. - ""We want to go,"" she said, ""it's about time."" - She wanted to withdraw her hand and I held it tighter. ""We'll see each other again,"" I cried, ""we'll find each other, we'll recognize each other under all shapes. I'm going,"" I continued, ""I'm going willingly, and yet if I had to say forever, I couldn't bear it. Farewell, Lotte! Farewell, Albert! We'll see each other again.« – »Tomorrow, I think.« she replied jokingly. – I felt the morning! Oh, she didn't know when she took her hand from mine -. They went out down the avenue, I stood, looked after them in the moonlight and threw myself on the ground and cried myself and jumped up and ran out onto the terrace and saw her white dress shimmering down there in the shade of the tall linden trees towards the garden door , I stretched out my arms, and it disappeared.[59]","She rose, and it brought me back to my senses. I was shattered and remained seated, still holding her hand. “Let us go,” she said. “It is late.” She wanted to withdraw her hand, but I clung to it. “We shall meet again!” I cried. “We shall find each other, whatever shape or form we may have. We shall recognize each other. I will go,” I added. “I will go willingly, but if I had to say good-bye forever, I could not bear it. Farewell, Lotte; farewell, Albert. We shall meet again.” “Tomorrow, I imagine,” she said gaily. I could feel the word “tomorrow.” She didn’t know, as she drew her hand out of mine…. They walked down the path in the moonlight. I stood up and watched them go. Then I threw myself on the ground and wept until I could weep no more, after which I jumped to my feet and ran out onto the terrace. Below, in the shadows of the tall linden trees, I could see her white dress shimmering as the two moved toward the gate. I stretched out my arms…and it vanished.","Charlotte rose.   It aroused me; but I continued sitting, and held her hand.   ""Let us go,"" she said: ""it grows late.""   She attempted to withdraw her hand: I held it still.   ""We shall see each other again,"" I exclaimed: ""we shall recognise each other under every possible change!   I am going,"" I continued, ""going willingly; but, should I say for ever, perhaps I may not keep my word.   Adieu, Charlotte; adieu, Albert.   We shall meet again.""   ""Yes: tomorrow, I think,"" she answered with a smile.   Tomorrow! how I felt the word! Ah! she little thought, when she drew her hand away from mine. They walked down the avenue.  "
"Wilhelm! Der Mensch, von dem ich dir schrieb, der glückliche Unglückliche, war Schreiber bei Lottens Vater, und eine Leidenschaft zu ihr, die er nährte, verbarg, entdeckte und worüber er aus dem Dienst geschickt wurde hat ihn rasend gemacht. Fühle bei diesen trocknen Worten, mit welchem Unsinne mich die Geschichte ergriffen hat, da mir sie Albert ebenso gelassen erzählte, als du sie vielleicht liesest.","Wilhelm! The man I wrote to you about, the happy unfortunate, was a clerk for Lotte's father, and a passion for her which he nurtured, hid, discovered and for which he was dismissed from the service drove him mad. With these dry words, feel the nonsense with which the story has gripped me, since Albert told it to me just as calmly as you might read it.","William! The fellow I wrote to you about, that fortunate unfortunate man, was once secretary to Lotte’s father, and his passionate love for her—which he nurtured, concealed, but finally disclosed, and because of which he was dismissed—drove him mad. Try to feel, as you read these dry words, with what derangement they filled me when Albert mentioned it to me just as casually as you read about it now.","DECEMBER 1. Wilhelm, the man about whom I wrote to you -- that man so enviable in his misfortunes -- was secretary to Charlotte's father; and an unhappy passion for her which he cherished, concealed, and at length discovered, caused him to be dismissed from his situation. This made him mad.   Think, whilst you peruse this plain narration, what an impression the circumstance has made upon me!   But it was related to me by Albert with as much calmness as you will probably peruse it."
Am 10. Oktober.,On October 10.,October 10th,OCTOBER 10.
"Was Albert zuletzt über die Sache des Gefangenen in Gegenwart des Amtmanns gesprochen, war Werthern höchst zuwider gewesen: er glaubte einige Empfindlichkeit gegen sich darin bemerkt zu haben, und wenn gleich bei mehrerem Nachdenken seinem Scharfsinne nicht entging, daß beide Männer recht haben möchten, so war es ihm doch, als ob er seinem innersten Dasein entsagen müßte, wenn er es gestehen, wenn er es zugeben sollte.","What Albert had recently said about the prisoner's case in the presence of the bailiff was extremely repugnant to Werther: he thought he had noticed some sensitivity towards himself in it, and even if after several reflections his keen sense did not fail to occur that both men might be right, so it was it seemed to him as if he had to renounce his innermost existence if he were to admit it, if he were to admit it.","Werther especially resented Albert’s final word in the matter, spoken in the presence of the judge, and thought he could detect resentment against himself in it, and even though, after giving the matter more thought, the fact could not have escaped him that both men were right, he still felt that he would be denying his innermost self if he admitted it.","Werther was highly incensed at the observations which Albert had made to the judge in this matter of the prisoner.   He thought he could detect therein a little bitterness toward himself personally; and although, upon reflection, it could not escape his sound judgment that their view of the matter was correct, he felt the greatest possible reluctance to make such an admission."
"Sie wußte nicht recht, was sie sagte, ebensowenig was sie tat, als sie nach einigen Freundinnen schickte, um nicht mit Werthern allein zu sein. Er legte einige Bücher hin, die er gebracht hatte, fragte nach andern, und sie wünschte, bald daß ihre Freundinnen kommen, bald daß sie wegbleiben möchten. Das Mädchen kam zurück und brachte die Nachricht, daß sich beide entschuldigen ließen.","She didn't quite know what she was saying, just as little what she was doing when she sent for some friends so that she wouldn't be alone with Werther. He put down some of the books he had brought, asked about others, and she wished that her friends would come and stay away. The girl came back and brought the news that they had both apologized.","Without knowing what she was saying or doing, she proceeded to send messages to two of her friends to come at once—anything so as not to be alone with Werther. He put down several books he had brought with him and spoke about a few others, while she was wishing at one moment that her friends would come and in the next that they would stay away. The maid came back with word that both girls regretted they were unable to come.","She scarcely knew what she said or did; and sent for some friends, who, by their presence, might prevent her being left alone with Werther.   He put down some books he had brought with him, then made inquiries about some others, until she began to hope that her friends might arrive shortly, entertaining at the same time a desire that they might stay away."
"Sie wollte das Mädchen mit ihrer Arbeit in das Nebenzimmer sitzen lassen; dann besann sie sich wieder anders. Werther ging in der Stube auf und ab, sie trat ans Klavier und fing eine Menuett an, sie wollte nicht fließen. Sie nahm sich zusammen und setzte sich gelassen zu Werthern, der seinen gewöhnlichen Platz auf dem Kanapee eingenommen hatte.","She wanted to let the girl sit in the next room with her work; then she changed her mind again. Werther paced up and down the room, she went to the piano and began a minuet, it wouldn't flow. She pulled herself together and sat down calmly next to Werther, who had taken his usual place on the sofa.","Lotte would have liked the maid to sit in the next room with whatever she might have to do, then decided against it. Werther was pacing up and down. Lotte went over to the piano and began to play a minuet, but she could not play fluently. She pulled herself together and tried to be casual as she sat down beside Werther, who had taken his usual seat on the sofa.","At one moment she felt anxious that the servant should remain in the adjoining room, then she changed her mind.   Werther, meanwhile, walked impatiently up and down.   She went to the piano, and determined not to retire.   She then collected her thoughts, and sat down quietly at Werther's side, who had taken his usual place on the sofa."
"»Du wirst mir zugeben«, sagte Albert, »daß gewisse Handlungen lasterhaft bleiben, sie mögen geschehen, aus welchem Beweggrunde sie wollen.«","""You will admit to me,"" said Albert, ""that certain actions remain vicious, they may be done for whatever motive they will.""","“You will grant me, I am sure,” Albert said, “that certain actions are vicious whatever the reason may be.”","""But you will allow,"" said Albert; ""that some actions are criminal, let them spring from whatever motives they may.

"Ich hab's nicht überwinden können, ich mußte zu ihr hinaus. Da bin ich wieder, Wilhelm, will mein Butterbrot zu Nacht essen und dir schreiben. Welch eine Wonne das für meine Seele ist, sie in dem Kreise der lieben, muntern Kinder, ihrer acht Geschwister, zu sehen! –","I couldn't get over it, I had to go out to her. Here I am again, Wilhelm, I want to eat my sandwich for the night and write to you. What a delight it is for my soul to see her in the company of her dear, cheerful children, her eight siblings! –","Nothing to be done about it. I simply had to go and see her, and here I am again, William. I shall have my supper now and write to you. What joy it is to see her surrounded by a swarm of charming, lively children, her eight brothers and sisters!","I must.   I have just returned, Wilhelm; and whilst I am taking supper I will write to you.   What a delight it was for my soul to see her in the midst of her dear, beautiful children, -- eight brothers and sisters!"
"Lebe wohl! Es ist ein herrlicher Sommer; ich sitze oft auf den Obstbäumen in Lottens Baumstück mit dem Obstbrecher, der langen Stange, und hole die Birnen aus dem[54] Gipfel. Sie steht unten und nimmt sie ab, wenn ich sie ihr herunterlasse.","Farewell! It's a glorious summer; I often sit on the fruit trees in Lotte's tree section with the fruit crusher, the long pole, and fetch the pears from the[54] summit. She stands below and takes them off when I put them down for her.",Farewell. It is a marvelous summer. I often sit in the fruit trees in Lotte’s orchard and with long shears cut the pears from the top of the tree. She stands below and takes them from me one by one as I hand them down to her.,"Farewell!   This is a glorious summer.   I often climb into the trees in Charlotte's orchard, and shake down the pears that hang on the highest branches.   She stands below, and catches them as they fall."

"Ein Nachbar sah den Blick vom Pulver und hörte den Schuß fallen; da aber alles stille blieb, achtete er nicht weiter drauf.","A neighbor saw the powder and heard the shot; but since everything remained silent, he paid no further attention to it.","A neighbor saw the flash of gunpowder and heard the shot, but since all remained silent, he paid no further heed to the occurrence.","A neighbour saw the flash, and heard the report of the pistol; but, as everything remained quiet, he thought no more of it."
"Das war eine Nacht! Wilhelm! nun überstehe ich alles. Ich werde sie nicht wiedersehn! O daß ich nicht an deinen Hals fliegen, dir mit tausend Tränen und Entzückungen ausdrücken kann, mein Bester, die Empfindungen, die mein Herz bestürmen. Hier sitze ich und schnappe nach Luft, suche mich zu beruhigen, erwarte den Morgen, und mit Sonnenaufgang sind die Pferde bestellt.","That was one night! Wilhelm! now I can survive anything. I won't see her again! O that I cannot fly at your neck, express to you with a thousand tears and delights, my dear, the feelings that storm my heart. Here I sit and gasp for air, trying to calm myself, awaiting the morning, and the horses are ordered when the sun comes up.","What a dreadful night! William, now I know I can bear anything. I shall not see her again. Oh, why can’t I fall on your neck and, in tears and rapture, confide to you, best of friends, the tumultuous passion that is breaking my heart! Here I sit, breathless, trying to calm down, waiting for the dawn when the horses will stand saddled outside.","Oh, what a night, Wilhelm!   I can henceforth bear anything.   I shall never see her again.   Oh, why cannot I fall on your neck, and, with floods of tears and raptures, give utterance to all the passions which distract my heart!   Here I sit gasping for breath, and struggling to compose myself.   I wait for day, and at sunrise the horses are to be at the door."
"Ein Bauerbursch kam aus einem benachbarten Hause und beschäftigte sich, an dem Pfluge, den ich neulich gezeichnet hatte, etwas zurecht zu machen. Da mir sein Wesen gefiel, redete ich ihn an, fragte nach seinen Umständen, wir waren bald bekannt und, wie mir's gewöhnlich mit dieser Art Leuten geht, bald vertraut. Er erzählte mir, daß er bei einer Witwe in Diensten sei und von ihr gar wohl gehalten werde. Er sprach so vieles von ihr und lobte sie dergestalt, daß ich bald merken konnte, er sei ihr mit Leib und Seele zugetan. Sie sei nicht mehr jung, sagte er, sie sei von ihrem ersten Mann übel gehalten worden, wolle nicht mehr heiraten, und aus seiner Erzählung leuchtete so merklich hervor, wie schön, wie reizend sie für ihn sei, wie sehr er wünsche, daß sie ihn wählen möchte, um das Andenken der Fehler ihres ersten Mannes auszulöschen, daß ich Wort für Wort wiederholen müßte, um dir die reine Neigung, die Liebe und Treue dieses Menschen anschaulich zu machen. Ja, ich müßte die Gabe des größten Dichters besitzen, um dir zugleich den Ausdruck seiner Gebärden, die Harmonie seiner Stimme, das heimliche Feuer seiner Blicke lebendig darstellen zu können. Nein, es sprechen keine Worte die Zartheit aus, die in seinem ganzen Wesen und Ausdruck war; es ist alles nur plump, was ich wieder vorbringen könnte. Besonders rührte mich, wie er fürchtete, ich möchte über sein Verhältnis zu ihr ungleich denken und an ihrer guten Aufführung zweifeln. Wie reizend es war, wenn er von ihrer[18] Gestalt, von ihrem Körper sprach, der ihn ohne jugendliche Reize gewaltsam an sich zog und fesselte, kann ich mir nur in meiner innersten Seele wiederholen. Ich hab' in meinem Leben die dringende Begierde und das heiße, sehnliche Verlangen nicht in dieser Reinheit gesehen, ja wohl kann ich sagen, in dieser Reinheit nicht gedacht und geträumt. Schelte mich nicht, wenn ich dir sage, daß bei der Erinnerung dieser Unschuld und Wahrheit mir die innerste Seele glüht, und daß mich das Bild dieser Treue und Zärtlichkeit überall verfolgt, und daß ich, wie selbst davon entzündet, lechze und schmachte.","A peasant boy came from a neighboring house and was busy putting something right on the plow that I had recently drawn. Since I liked his nature, I spoke to him, asked about his circumstances, we were soon acquainted and, as I usually do with this kind of people, soon familiar. He told me that he was in the service of a widow and was well taken care of by her. He spoke so much about her and praised her in such a way that I could soon see that he loved her body and soul. She wasn't young any more, he said, she had been treated badly by her first husband, didn't want to marry any more, and what he told me shone out so noticeably how beautiful, how charming she was to him, how much he wanted her choose him to erase the memory of her first husband's mistakes, that I would have to repeat word for word to convey to you the pure affection, love and faithfulness of this man. Yes, I would have to have the gift of the greatest poet to be able to present to you the expression of his gestures, the harmony of his voice, the secret fire of his eyes. No, no words express the tenderness that was in his whole being and expression; it's all clumsy that I could bring up again. I was particularly moved when he feared that I might think differently about his relationship to her and doubt her good conduct. I can only repeat in my innermost soul how charming it was when he spoke of her form, of her body, which violently drew and bound him without youthful charm. In my life I have never seen the urgent desire and the hot, longing desire in this purity, yes, I can certainly say, I have not thought and dreamed in this purity. Do not scold me if I tell you that at the memory of this innocence and truth my innermost soul glows, and that the image of this faithfulness and tenderness follows me everywhere, and that, as if inflamed by it myself, I thirst and languish.","A peasant boy came out of one of the neighboring cottages and busied himself fixing the plow which I sketched a few days ago. I liked his appearance so I accosted him and asked him some questions about himself. We were soon on quite friendly terms, and, as is usual with this type of person, he began to confide in me. He told me that he was in the service of a widow and that he was being treated well there. He talked on and on about her, singing her praises, and it wasn’t long before I realized that he was hopelessly in love with her. She was not young, he explained, and her first husband had treated her badly. She therefore did not want to marry again. From what he told it became quite clear how pretty and charming she was, and how much he wished that she would choose him to help her forget her first mistake. I would have to repeat what he said word for word really to convey to you his attraction to the woman, his love and devotion. Indeed, I would have to be a great poet to reproduce what he said, his attitude, the harmoniousness of his voice, the latent fire in his eyes, as spiritedly as I experienced them. But there are no words for the tenderness expressed by the man as a whole. Anything I might say would be clumsy in comparison. I was especially touched by his fear that I might come to the wrong conclusions about the relationship and doubt her propriety. It was charming to hear him speak of her appearance and figure, to which he was so strongly attracted although she was no longer young. I can recapture it only in the depths of my soul. Never in my life have I witnessed the driving forces of desire and passion so purely expressed. I will even go so far as to say that I have never seen them envisioned with so much chastity. Don’t be vexed if I tell you that I catch fire myself when I recall his innocence and honesty. The thought of his loyalty and tenderness follows me everywhere, and I feel faint with desire myself, as if his passion had been contagious.","A peasant came from an adjoining house, and set to work arranging some part of the same plough which I had lately sketched.   His appearance pleased me; and I spoke to him, inquired about his circumstances, made his acquaintance, and, as is my wont with persons of that class, was soon admitted into his confidence.   He said he was in the service of a young widow, who set great store by him.   He spoke so much of his mistress, and praised her so extravagantly, that I could soon see he was desperately in love with her.   ""She is no longer young,"" he said: ""and she was treated so badly by her former husband that she does not mean to marry again.""   From his account it was so evident what incomparable charms she possessed for him, and how ardently he wished she would select him to extinguish the recollection of her first husband's misconduct, that I should have to repeat his own words in order to describe the depth of the poor fellow's attachment, truth, and devotion.   It would, in fact, require the gifts of a great poet to convey the expression of his features, the harmony of his voice, and the heavenly fire of his eye.   No words can portray the tenderness of his every movement and of every feature: no effort of mine could do justice to the scene.   His alarm lest I should misconceive his position with regard to his mistress, or question the propriety of her conduct, touched me particularly.   The charming manner with which he described her form and person, which, without possessing the graces of youth, won and attached him to her, is inexpressible, and must be left to the imagination.   I have never in my life witnessed or fancied or conceived the possibility of such intense devotion, such ardent affections, united with so much purity.   Do not blame me if I say that the recollection of this innocence and truth is deeply impressed upon my very soul; that this picture of fidelity and tenderness haunts me everywhere; and that my own heart, as though enkindled by the flame, glows and burns within me."
"Vor wenig Tagen traf ich einen jungen V.. an, einen offnen Jungen, mit einer gar glücklichen Gesichtsbildung. Er kommt erst von Akademien, dünkt sich eben nicht weise, aber glaubt doch, er wisse mehr als andere. Auch war er fleißig, wie ich an allerlei spüre, kurz, er hat hübsche Kenntnisse. Da er hörte, daß ich viel zeichnete und Griechisch könnte (zwei Meteore hierzulande), wandte er sich an mich und kramte viel Wissens aus, von Batteux bis zu Wood, von de Piles zu Winckelmann, und versicherte mich, er habe Sulzers Theorie, den ersten Teil, ganz durchgelesen und besitze ein Manuskript von Heynen über das Studium der Antike. Ich ließ das gut sein.","A few days ago I met a young V.., an open boy with a very happy facial expression. He only comes from academies, doesn't think he's wise, but thinks he knows more than others. He was also industrious, as I can tell from all sorts of things, in short, he has a pretty good knowledge. When he heard that I drew a lot and knew Greek (two meteors in this country), he turned to me and dug up a great deal of knowledge, from Batteux to Wood, from de Piles to Winckelmann, and assured me that he had Sulzer's theory, the first part, read through and own a manuscript by Heynen on the study of antiquity. I let that be.","A few days ago I met a young man called V., an ingenuous fellow with a very pleasant face. He has just left the university and doesn’t consider himself overly wise, yet thinks he knows more than most people. As far as I can make out, he seems to have been very diligent; in short, he is well informed. He had heard that I sketch a great deal and that I know Greek—staggering accomplishments in these parts—so he came to see me and unloaded his store of wisdom, everything from Batteux to Wood, and De Piles to Winckelmann; and assured me that he had read all of Sulzer’s Theory (Part One) and owned a manuscript of Heyne’s on “The Study of Antiquity.” I let him talk.","A few days ago I met a certain young V--, a frank, open fellow, with a most pleasing countenance.   He has just left the university, does not deem himself overwise, but believes he knows more than other people.   He has worked hard, as I can perceive from many circumstances, and, in short, possesses a large stock of information. When he heard that I am drawing a good deal, and that I know Greek (two wonderful things for this part of the country), he came to see me, and displayed his whole store of learning, from Batteaux to Wood, from De Piles to Winkelmann: he assured me he had read through the first part of Sultzer's theory, and also possessed a manuscript of Heyne's work on the study of the antique.   I allowed it all to pass."
"Ich habe mir angelegen sein lassen, genaue Nachrichten aus dem Munde derer zu sammeln, die von seiner Geschichte wohl unterrichtet sein konnten; sie ist einfach, und es kommen alle Erzählungen davon bis auf wenige Kleinigkeiten miteinander überein; nur über die Sinnesarten der handelnden Personen sind die Meinungen verschieden und die Urteile geteilt.","I have taken it upon myself to gather accurate information from the mouths of those who might well have been informed of his story; it is simple, and all the accounts of it agree with one another except for a few trifles; Opinions differ and judgments differ only about the senses of the acting persons.","I made a point of collecting precise reports from those who of necessity had a thorough knowledge of his story. It is simple, and except for a few details, all the accounts tally. Opinions differ only in accordance with the personalities and opinions of the characters involved.","I have felt it my duty to collect accurate information from the mouths of persons well acquainted with his history.   The story is simple; and all the accounts agree, except in some unimportant particulars.   It is true, that, with respect to the characters of the persons spoken of, opinions and judgments vary."
"Gegen fünf kam er nach Hause, befahl der Magd, nach dem Feuer zu sehen und es bis in die Nacht zu unterhalten. Den Bedienten hieß er Bücher und Wäsche unten in den Koffer packen und die Kleider einnähen. Darauf schrieb er wahrscheinlich folgenden Absatz seines letzten Briefes an Lotten.[105]","About five he came home, ordered the maid to look after the fire and keep it up into the night. He told the servants to pack the books and linen in the bottom of the trunk and sew up the clothes. Then he probably wrote the following paragraph of his last letter to Lotten.[105]",He reached home again at about five and told the maid to stoke the fire and keep it going through the night. He ordered his servant to pack his books and linen in a trunk and fold his clothing. Then he must have written the following paragraph of his last letter to Lotte:,"He returned home about five o'clock, ordered his servant to keep up his fire, desired him to pack his books and linen at the bottom of the trunk, and to place his coats at the top.   He then appears to have made the following addition to the letter addressed to Charlotte:"
"Ich fürchte, mein Gesandter und ich halten es zusammen nicht mehr lange aus. Der Mann ist ganz und gar unerträglich. Seine Art zu arbeiten und Geschäfte zu treiben ist so lächerlich, daß ich mich nicht enthalten kann, ihm zu widersprechen und oft eine Sache nach meinem Kopf und meiner Art zu machen, das ihm denn, wie natürlich, niemals recht ist. Darüber hat er mich neulich bei Hofe verklagt, und der Minister gab mir einen zwar sanften Verweis, aber es war doch ein Verweis, und ich stand im Begriffe, meinen Abschied zu begehren, als ich einen Privatbrief5 von ihm erhielt, einen Brief, vor dem ich niedergekniet, und den hohen, edlen, weisen Sinn angebetet habe. Wie er meine allzu große Empfindlichkeit zurechtweiset, wie er meine überspannten[66] Ideen von Wirksamkeit, von Einfluß auf andere, von Durchdringen in Geschäften als jugendlichen guten Mut zwar ehrt, sie nicht auszurotten, nur zu mildern und dahin zu leiten sucht, wo sie ihr wahres Spiel haben, ihre kräftige Wirkung tun können. Auch bin ich auf acht Tage gestärkt und in mir selbst einig geworden. Die Ruhe der Seele ist ein herrliches Ding und die Freude an sich selbst. Lieber Freund, wenn nur das Kleinod nicht eben so zerbrechlich wäre, als es schön und kostbar ist.","I'm afraid my envoy and I can't stand together much longer. The man is utterly unbearable. His way of working and doing business is so ridiculous that I cannot refrain from contradicting him and often doing things of my own liking and of my own liking, which, of course, never suits him. He recently sued me at court about this, and the minister reprimanded me, though it was gentle, but it was a reprimand, and I was on the point of asking for my departure when I received a private letter5 from him, a letter before which I knelt down and worshiped the high, noble, wise sense. How he corrects my excessive sensitivity, how he honors my overstretched[66] ideas of effectiveness, of influencing others, of penetrating my business as youthful good courage, not eradicating them, only trying to soften them and lead them to where they are have their true game, can make their powerful impact. I am also strengthened for eight days and have become one within myself. The peace of the soul is a wonderful thing and the joy in oneself. Dear friend, if only the jewel were not just as fragile as it is beautiful and precious.","I am afraid my ambassador and I are not going to be able to put up with each other much longer. The man is impossible! His working habits and way of doing business are so ridiculous that I simply cannot control myself and have to contradict him; and often I do a thing the way I feel it should be done, which of course never suits him. He complained about me at court the other day and the minister reprimanded me—gently enough, but all the same, it was a reprimand. I was about to hand in my resignation when I received a personal letter from him that makes me want to kneel down and worship this infinitely noble and wise mind. * He rebukes me for being overly sensitive, yet respects my exaggerated ideas on effectiveness, influencing others, and succeeding in business, as examples of youthful high spirits and in no way tries to suppress them. All he wants to do is tone them down and guide them into the correct channels, where they may have the right effect. Now I have the strength to carry on for another week and have come to an understanding with myself. Peace of mind and the ability to take pleasure in oneself are glorious things. Dear friend, if only the treasure were not as fragile as it is precious and beautiful!","I fear that my ambassador and I shall not continue much longer together.   He is really growing past endurance.   He transacts his business in so ridiculous a manner, that I am often compelled to contradict him, and do things my own way; and then, of course, he thinks them very ill done.   He complained of me lately on this account at court; and the minister gave me a reprimand, -- a gentle one it is true, but still a reprimand.   In consequence of this, I was about to tender my resignation, when I received a letter, to which I submitted with great respect, on account of the high, noble, and generous spirit which dictated it.   He endeavoured to soothe my excessive sensibility, paid a tribute to my extreme ideas of duty, of good example, and of perseverance in business, as the fruit of my youthful ardour, an impulse which he did not seek to destroy, but only to moderate, that it might have proper play and be productive of good.   So now I am at rest for another week, and no longer at variance with myself.   Content and peace of mind are valuable things: I could wish, my dear friend, that these precious jewels were less transitory."

"»Lotte«, sagte ich, indem ich ihr die Hand reichte und mir die Augen voll Tränen wurden, »wir werden uns wiedersehn!

See you again here and there!” I couldn't go on talking—Wilhelm, she had to ask me that because I had this anxious farewell in my heart!","“Lotte,” I said, stretching out my hand to her, and my eyes were filled with tears, “we shall meet again. Here and there…we shall meet again.” I could say no more. William, did she have to ask me that just when my heart was full of this dreadful separation?","""Charlotte,"" I said, as I took her hand in mine, and my eyes filled with tears, ""we shall see each other again -- here and hereafter we shall meet again.

"Ich bemühte mich, meine Bewegungen über diese Worte zu verbergen. Das ging freilich nicht weit: denn da ich sie mit solcher Wahrheit im Vorbeigehen vom Landpriester von Wakefield, vom –3 reden hörte, kam ich ganz außer mich, sagte ihr alles, was ich mußte, und bemerkte erst nach einiger Zeit, da Lotte das Gespräch an die anderen wendete, daß diese die Zeit über mit offenen Augen, als säßen sie nicht da, dagesessen hatten. Die Base sah mich mehr als einmal mit einem spöttischen Näschen an, daran mir aber nichts gelegen war.","I tried to hide my movements over those words. That didn't go far, of course, because when I heard her speaking with such truth in passing about the country priest of Wakefield, about -3, I became completely beside myself, told her everything I had to, and only noticed after a while that Lotte was doing it The conversation turned to the others that they had sat with their eyes open all the time, as if they weren't sitting there. The base looked at me more than once with a mocking nose, but I didn't care.","I did my best to hide the emotions her words aroused in me. I didn’t succeed very well because, when I heard her speak casually and very candidly about The Vicar of Wakefield and about ——* I was quite beside myself and told her all I knew of them, and only after quite some time had passed, and Lotte turned suddenly to address the others, did I notice that they had been sitting there goggle-eyed, as if they weren’t sitting there at all! The cousin looked down her nose at me several times, but I didn’t care.","I endeavoured to conceal the emotion which these words occasioned, but it was of slight avail; for, when she had expressed so truly her opinion of ""The Vicar of Wakefield,"" and of other works, the names of which I omit ( Though the names are omitted, yet the authors mentioned deserve Charlotte's approbation, and will feel it in their hearts when they read this passage. It concerns no other person.) , I could no longer contain myself, but gave full utterance to what I thought of it: and it was not until Charlotte had addressed herself to the two other ladies, that I remembered their presence, and observed them sitting mute with astonishment.   The aunt looked at me several times with an air of raillery, which, however, I did not at all mind."
"Wenn ich so fortfahre, wirst du am Ende so klug sein wie am Anfange. Höre denn, ich will mich zwingen, ins Detail zu gehen.","If I continue like this, you will end up being as clever as you were at the beginning. Listen then, I want to force myself to go into detail.","If I go on like this, you won’t know much more when I am through than you did at the beginning. Very well, then, listen. I will do my best to give you the full details.","But, if I proceed thus, you will be no wiser at the end of my letter than you were at the beginning.   Attend, then, and I will compel myself to give you the details."

"Er kam ans Stadttor. Die Wächter, die ihn schon gewohnt waren, ließen ihn stillschweigend hinaus. Es stiebte zwischen Regen und Schnee, und erst gegen eilfe klopfte er wieder. Sein Diener bemerkte, als Werther nach Hause kam, daß seinem Herrn der Hut fehlte. Er getraute sich nicht, etwas zu sagen, entkleidete ihn, alles war naß. Man hat nachher den Hut auf einem Felsen, der an dem Abhange des Hügels ins Tal sieht, gefunden, und es ist unbegreiflich, wie er ihn in einer finstern, feuchten Nacht, ohne zu stürzen, erstiegen hat.[115]","He came to the city gate. The guards, who were already used to him, silently let him out. There was a flurry of rain and snow, and it wasn't until eleven o'clock that he knocked again. When Werther came home, his servant noticed that his master's hat was missing. He didn't dare to say anything, undressed him, everything was wet. The hat was later found on a rock that looks down into the valley on the slope of the hill, and it is incomprehensible how he climbed it on a dark, damp night without falling.[115]","At the city gates, the watchmen, who were accustomed to the sight of him, let him out silently. It was drizzling, a mixture of rain and snow, and it was nearly eleven when he rapped on the gates again. His servant noted that his master came home without his hat. He didn’t dare to mention the fact but undressed him silently. All his clothes were wet. The hat was found later on a rock that overlooks the valley from the precipitous side of a hill, and it is incredible that Werther could have climbed up it on a dark, wet night without falling out.","Werther ran to the gate of the town.   The guards, who knew him, let him pass in silence.   The night was dark and stormy, -- it rained and snowed.   He reached his own door about eleven.   His servant, although seeing him enter the house without his hat, did not venture to say anything; and; as he undressed his master, he found that his clothes were wet.   His hat was afterward found on the point of a rock overhanging the valley; and it is inconceivable how he could have climbed to the summit on such a dark, tempestuous night without losing his life."
"Alles das ist vergänglich, aber keine Ewigkeit soll das glühende Leben auslöschen, das ich gestern auf deinen Lippen genoß, das ich in mir fühle! Sie liebt mich! Dieser Arm hat sie umfaßt, diese Lippen haben auf ihren Lippen gezittert, dieser Mund hat an dem ihrigen gestammelt. Sie ist mein! du bist mein! ja, Lotte, auf ewig.","All this is fleeting, but no eternity shall extinguish the glowing life that I enjoyed on your lips yesterday, that I feel inside me! She loves Me! This arm has embraced her, these lips have trembled on her lips, this mouth has stammered on hers. She's mine! You are mine! yes, Lotte, forever.","“All such things are transient. But no eternity shall erase the glowing life that I experienced at your lips yesterday and that I feel within me now. She loves me. These arms have held her; these lips have trembled on hers; this mouth has stammered a few broken words against hers. She is mine. You are mine, Lotte, forever.","""Everything passes away; but a whole eternity could not extinguish the living flame which was yesterday kindled by your lips, and which now burns within me.   She loves me!   These arms have encircled her waist, these lips have trembled upon hers.   She is mine!   Yes, Charlotte, you are mine for ever!"
"Es ist doch gewiß, daß in der Welt den Menschen nichts notwendig macht als die Liebe. Ich fühl's an Lotten, daß sie mich ungern verlöre, und die Kinder haben keinen andern Begriff, als daß ich immer morgen wiederkommen würde. Heute war ich hinausgegangen, Lottens Klavier zu stimmen, ich konnte aber nicht dazu kommen, denn die Kleinen verfolgten mich um ein Märchen, und Lotte sagte selbst, ich sollte ihnen den Willen tun. Ich schnitt ihnen das Abendbrot, das sie nun fast so gern von mir als von Lotten annehmen, und erzählte ihnen das Hauptstückchen von der Prinzessin, die von Händen bedient wird. Ich lerne viel dabei,[50] das versichre ich dich, und ich bin erstaunt, was es auf sie für Eindrücke macht. Weil ich manchmal einen Inzidentpunkt erfinden muß, den ich beim zweitenmal vergesse, sagen sie gleich, das vorigemal wär' es anders gewesen, so daß ich mich jetzt übe, sie unveränderlich in einem singenden Silbenfall an einem Schnürchen weg zu rezitieren. Ich habe daraus gelernt, wie ein Autor durch eine zweite, veränderte Ausgabe seiner Geschichte, und wenn sie poetisch noch so besser geworden wäre, notwendig seinem Buche schaden muß. Der erste Eindruck findet uns willig, und der Mensch ist gemacht, daß man ihn das Abenteuerlichste überreden kann; das haftet aber auch gleich so fest, und wehe dem, der es wieder auskratzen und austilgen will!","It is, after all, certain that nothing in the world makes man necessary but love. I can tell from Lotte that she would not like to lose me, and the children have no other idea than that I would always come back tomorrow. Today I went out to tune Lotte's piano, but I couldn't get around to it because the little ones were chasing me for a fairy tale, and Lotte herself said I should do what they wanted. I cut them their supper, which they now accept almost as gladly from me as from Lotte, and told them the main part about the princess, who is served by hands. I'm learning a lot from it,[50] I assure you, and I'm amazed at the impression it makes on her. Because I sometimes have to invent an incident point that I forget the second time, they immediately say it was different the previous time, so that I now practice reciting them invariably in a singing syllable case like a string. From this I have learned how an author must necessarily damage his book by a second, changed edition of his story, even if it had become even better poetically. The first impression finds us willing, and man is made to be persuaded to do the most adventurous things; but it also sticks so firmly, and woe to the one who wants to scrape it out and wipe it out again!","One thing is certain—nothing justifies a man’s existence like being loved. I feel that Lotte would not like to lose me, and it never occurs to the children that I might not turn up every day. Today I went over to tune Lotte’s piano, but never got around to doing it, because the little ones would not leave me alone. They wanted a fairy tale, and in the end, even Lotte asked me to tell them one. I cut their supper bread for them—now they are almost as willing to receive it from me as from Lotte—and I told them their favorite tale about the princess who is waited on by invisible hands. I learn a great deal when I do this sort of thing, I can assure you, and am astonished by what an impression it makes on them. Sometimes, when I have to invent an incident because I have forgotten how I told the story the first time, they tell me at once that last time it was different, so now I try to tell every tale in a sustained singsong tone. This has taught me that an author can harm his book if he publishes a second, changed version of his story, however improved it may be poetically. The first impression finds the reader willing, and a human being can be persuaded to believe in the most daring adventure, but it takes root immediately, and woe to him who tries to dig it up and eradicate it!","There can be no doubt that in this world nothing is so indispensable as love.   I observe that Charlotte could not lose me without a pang, and the very children have but one wish; that is, that I should visit them again to-morrow.   I went this afternoon to tune Charlotte's piano.   But I could not do it, for the little ones insisted on my telling them a story; and Charlotte herself urged me to satisfy them.   I waited upon them at tea, and they are now as fully contented with me as with Charlotte; and I told them my very best tale of the princess who was waited upon by dwarfs. I improve myself by this exercise, and am quite surprised at the impression my stories create.   If I sometimes invent an incident which I forget upon the next narration, they remind one directly that the story was different before; so that I now endeavour to relate with exactness the same anecdote in the same monotonous tone, which never changes.   I find by this, how much an author injures his works by altering them, even though they be improved in a poetical point of view.   The first impression is readily received.   We are so constituted that we believe the most incredible things; and, once they are engraved upon the memory, woe to him who would endeavour to efface them."
"Die Erinnerung einer solchen Szene, wobei ich gegenwärtig war, fiel mit ganzer Gewalt bei diesen Worten über mich. Ich nahm das Schnupftuch vor die Augen und verließ die Gesellschaft, und nur Lottens Stimme, die mir rief, wir wollten fort, brachte mich zu mir selbst. Und wie sie mich auf dem Wege schalt über den zu warmen Anteil an allem, und daß ich drüber zugrunde gehen würde! daß ich mich schonen sollte! – O der Engel! Um deinetwillen muß ich leben!","The memory of such a scene, in which I was present, overcame me with all its might at these words. I put the handkerchief to my eyes and left the company, and only Lotte's voice, which called to me that we wanted to leave, brought me to myself. And how she scolded me on the way about my too warm part in everything, and that I would perish over it! that I should take care of myself! – O the angel! I must live for your sake!","As I spoke, the memory of such a scene overwhelmed me. I covered my face with my handkerchief and left the little group and was only able to control myself again when Lotte called out to me that we had to leave. On the way back, she scolded me for my too intense participation in all things going on around me and warned that it would lead to my ruination. I was, please, she begged, to think of myself. Angel! For you I have to live!","At these words the remembrance of a similar scene at which I had been once present fell with full force upon my heart. I buried my face in my handkerchief, and hastened from the room, and was only recalled to my recollection by Charlotte's voice, who reminded me that it was time to return home.   With what tenderness she chid me on the way for the too eager interest I took in everything! She declared it would do me injury, and that I ought to spare myself.   Yes, my angel!   I will do so for your sake."
"Und es erscheint in seiner Kraft. Ich sehe meine geschiedenen Freunde, sie sammeln sich auf Lora, wie in den Tagen, die vorüber sind. – Fingal kommt wie eine feuchte Nebelsäule; um ihn sind seine Helden, und, siehe! die Barden des Gesanges: Grauer Ullin! stattlicher Ryno! Alpin, lieblicher Sänger! und du, sanft klagende Minona! – Wie verändert seid ihr, meine Freunde, seit den festlichen Tagen auf Selma, da wir buhlten um die Ehre des Gesanges, wie Frühlingslüfte den Hügel hin wechselnd beugen das schwach lispelnde Gras.","And it appears in its power. I see my divorced friends gathering on Lora like in the days gone by. – Fingal comes like a wet pillar of mist; around him are his heroes, and behold! the bards of song: Gray Ullin! handsome Ryno! Alpine, lovely singer! and you, gently wailing Minona! – How changed are you, my friends, since the festive days on Selma, when we courted the honor of song, like spring breezes, changing over the hills, bend the faintly lisping grass.","“And it arises in all its glory. I see my departed friends assembled in Lora as in days of yore— Fingal, a moist column of mist, his heroes around him—here , there…see the bards! Gray Ullin, stately Ryno, Alpin—beloved singer—and thou, gentle-voiced Minona.

I behold my departed friends. Their gathering is on Lora, as in the days of other years.   Fingal comes like a watery column of mist! his heroes are around: and see the bards of song, gray-haired Ullin! stately Ryno! Alpin with the tuneful voice: the soft complaint of Minona!

"Der alte Amtmann kam auf die Nachricht hereingesprengt, er küßte den Sterbenden unter den heißesten Tränen. Seine ältesten Söhne kamen bald nach ihm zu Fuße, sie fielen neben dem Bette nieder im Ausdrucke des unbändigsten Schmerzens, küßten ihm die Hände und den Mund, und der älteste, den er immer am meisten geliebt, hing an seinen Lippen, bis er verschieden war und man den Knaben mit Gewalt wegriß. Um zwölfe mittags starb er. Die Gegenwart des Amtmannes und seine Anstalten tuschten einen Auflauf. Nachts gegen eilfe ließ er ihn an die Stätte begraben, die er sich erwählt hatte.

The oldest one, whom Werther had always loved best, clung to his lips as he expired and had to be forcefully removed. At twelve noon, Werther died. The presence of the judge and the arrangements he made silenced the crowd. That night, at about eleven, he had the body buried in the spot Werther had chosen. The old man and his sons walked behind the bier; Albert found himself incapable of doing so. They feared for Lotte’s life. Workmen carried the body. There was no priest in attendance.","The old steward hastened to the house immediately upon hearing the news: he embraced his dying friend amid a flood of tears.   His eldest boys soon followed him on foot.   In speechless sorrow they threw themselves on their knees by the bedside, and kissed his hands and face.   The eldest, who was his favourite, hung over him till he expired; and even then he was removed by force.   At twelve o'clock Werther breathed his last.   The presence of the steward, and the precautions he had adopted, prevented a disturbance; and that night, at the hour of eleven, he caused the body to be interred in the place which Werther had selected for himself.

At the corner of the churchyard, looking toward the fields, there are two lime-trees -- there I wish to lie.   Your father can, and doubtless will, do this much for his friend.   Implore it of him.   But perhaps pious Christians will not choose that their bodies chould be buried near the corpse of a poor, unhappy wretch like me.   Then let me be laid in some remote valley, or near the highway, where the priest and Levite may bless themselves as they pass by my tomb, whilst the Samaritan will shed a tear for my fate."
"Er kam nach Hause, nahm seinem Burschen, der ihm leuchten wollte, das Licht aus der Hand und ging allein in sein Zimmer, weinte laut, redete aufgebracht mit sich selbst, ging heftig die Stube auf und ab und warf sich endlich in seinen Kleidern aufs Bette, wo ihn der Bediente fand, der es gegen eilfe wagte hineinzugehn, um zu fragen, ob er dem Herrn die Stiefeln ausziehen sollte, das er denn zuließ und[103] dem Bedienten verbot, den andern Morgen ins Zimmer zu kommen, bis er ihm rufen würde.","He came home, took the lamp from the hand of his lad, who wanted to light him up, and went alone to his room, cried loudly, talked agitatedly to himself, paced the room violently, and finally threw himself up in his clothes Bette, where the servant found him, who dared to go in at around eleven to ask if he should take off the gentleman's boots, which he allowed and forbade the servant to come into the room the next morning until he would call him.","He reached his house, took the candle from his servant, who wanted to light his way, and went to his room alone. There he wept, talked wildly to himself, paced savagely up and down, and at last threw himself fully dressed on his bed, where he was found at about eleven by his servant, who at last had dared to enter the room to ask his master whether he should not remove his boots. Werther let the man do it, then forbade the boy to enter his room the next morning until he was called.","Werther returned home, took the candle from his servant, and retired to his room alone.   He talked for some time with great earnestness to himself, wept aloud, walked in a state of great excitement through his chamber; till at length, without undressing, he threw himself on the bed, where he was found by his servant at eleven o'clock, when the latter ventured to enter the room, and take off his boots.   Werther did not prevent him, but forbade him to come in the morning till he should ring."

"Er ließ sich das Essen auf die Stube bringen, und nach Tische ritt er hinaus zum Amtmanne, den er nicht zu Hause antraf. Er ging tiefsinnig im Garten auf und ab und schien noch zuletzt alle Schwermut der Erinnerung auf sich häufen zu wollen.","He had his food brought to his room, and after dinner he rode out to the bailiff, whom he did not find at home. He paced thoughtfully up and down the garden and finally seemed to want to heap on himself all the melancholy of memory.","He had his meal served in his room. After he had eaten, he rode to the magistrate’s house, but found him not at home. Lost in thought, he walked up and down in the garden for a while, apparently wishing to burden himself with all the melancholy of remembrance.","He breakfasted in his room, and then mounted his horse, and went to visit the steward, who, however, was not at home.   He walked pensively in the garden, and seemed anxious to renew all the ideas that were most painful to him."
"2 Man sieht sich genötiget, diese Stelle des Briefes zu unterdrücken, um niemand Gelegenheit zu einiger Beschwerde zu geben. Obgleich im Grunde jedem Autor wenig an dem Urteile eines einzelnen Mädchens und eines jungen, unsteten Menschen gelegen sein kann.","2 One feels compelled to suppress this passage of the letter in order to give no one an opportunity to complain. Although basically every author can care little about the judgment of a single girl and a young, unsteady person.","* We have found it necessary to suppress this part of the letter in order to give no cause for complaint, although actually no author could care very much about the opinion of one girl and a young, unstable man.","I then sprang up, and ran out upon the terrace, and saw, under the shade of the linden-trees, her white dress disappearing near the garden-gate."
"Die liebe Frau hatte die letzte Nacht wenig geschlafen; was sie gefürchtet hatte, war entschieden, auf eine Weise entschieden, die sie weder ahnen noch fürchten konnte. Ihr sonst so rein und leicht fließendes Blut war in einer fieberhaften Empörung, tausenderlei Empfindungen zerrütteten das schöne Herz. War es das Feuer von Werthers Umarmungen, das sie in ihrem Busen fühlte? War es Unwille über seine Verwegenheit? War es eine unmutige Vergleichung ihres gegenwärtigen Zustandes mit jenen Tagen ganz unbefangener, freier Unschuld und sorglosen Zutrauens an sich selbst? Wie sollte sie ihrem Manne entgegengehen, wie ihm eine Szene bekennen, die sie so gut gestehen durfte, und die sie sich doch zu gestehen nicht getraute? Sie hatten so lange gegen einander geschwiegen, und sollte sie die erste sein, die das Stillschweigen bräche und eben zur unrechten Zeit ihrem Gatten eine so unerwartete Entdeckung machte? Schon fürchtete sie, die bloße Nachricht von Werthers Besuch werde ihm einen unangenehmen Eindruck machen, und nun gar diese unerwartete Katastrophe! Konnte sie wohl hoffen, daß ihr Mann sie ganz im rechten Lichte sehen, ganz ohne Vorurteil aufnehmen würde? Und konnte sie wünschen, daß er in ihrer Seele lesen möchte? Und doch wieder, konnte sie sich verstellen gegen den Mann, vor dem sie immer wie ein kristallhelles Glas offen und frei gestanden und dem sie keine ihrer Empfindungen jemals verheimlicht noch verheimlichen können? Eins und das andre machte ihr Sorgen und setzte sie in Verlegenheit; und immer kehrten ihre Gedanken wieder zu Werthern, der für sie verloren war, den sie nicht lassen konnte, den sie – leider! – sich selbst überlassen mußte, und dem, wenn er sie verloren hatte, nichts mehr übrig blieb.[118]","The dear wife had slept little last night; what she had feared was decided, decided in a way she could neither guess nor fear. Her blood, otherwise so pure and easy-flowing, was in a state of feverish indignation, thousands of emotions shattered her beautiful heart. Was it the fire of Werther's embrace that she felt in her bosom? Was it indignation at his boldness? Was it an unnerved comparison of her present state with those days of utterly unabashed, free innocence and carefree self-confidence? How should she approach her husband, how should she confess to him a scene that she was perfectly entitled to admit and yet did not dare to admit? They had been silent about each other for so long, and was she to be the first to break the silence and make such an untimely discovery to her husband? She was already afraid that the mere news of Werther's visit would make him an unpleasant impression, and now even this unexpected catastrophe! Could she hope that her husband would see her in the right light, would receive her without prejudice? And could she wish that he would read her soul? And yet again, could she disguise herself against the man before whom she was always open and free like a crystal-clear glass, and from whom she never, and cannot, conceal any of her feelings? One thing and the other bothered and embarrassed her; and her thoughts always returned to Werther, who was lost to her, whom she could not let go of, whom she - unfortunately! – had to be left to his own devices, and when he had lost her there was nothing left.[118]","Lotte had slept little during the preceding night. What she had dreaded had been decided for her in a way she could neither have dreamed nor feared. Her blood, which usually coursed so chastely and steadily through her veins, was in a feverish turmoil. A thousand confused sensations disturbed her. Was it the passion of Werther’s embrace that she felt in her breast? Was it resentment of his boldness? Or was it the result of an unpleasant comparison of her present condition with former days of completely unabashed innocence and carefree confidence in herself? How was she to meet her husband? There was nothing to hide, yet how was she to explain the scene to him? She didn’t dare to. They had been silent for such a long time on this subject—should she break the silence and make such an unexpected disclosure, perhaps at the wrong time? She feared that even the mention of Werther’s visit would make a disagreeable impression, and on top of that—this unexpected catastrophe! Could she hope that her husband would see things in their true light and accept what she had to say entirely without bias? And did she want him to look into her soul and read what was there? But then again, could she dissemble before a man to whom she had always been frank and clear as crystal, from whom she had never been able to keep any of her feelings secret? All these things troubled and embarrassed her. Again and again her thoughts reverted to Werther, who was lost to her, whom she could not abandon, yet, alas, had to abandon, to whom—once he had lost her—nothing was left.","Charlotte had slept little during the past night.   All her apprehensions were realised in a way that she could neither foresee nor avoid.   Her blood was boiling in her veins, and a thousand painful sensations rent her pure heart.   Was it the ardour of Werther's passionate embraces that she felt within her bosom?   Was it anger at his daring?   Was it the sad comparison of her present condition with former days of innocence, tranquillity, and self-confidence?   How could she approach her husband, and confess a scene which she had no reason to conceal, and which she yet felt, nevertheless, unwilling to avow?   They had preserved so long a silence toward each other and should she be the first to break it by so unexpected a discovery?   She feared that the mere statement of Werther's visit would trouble him, and his distress would be heightened by her perfect candour.   She wished that he could see her in her true light, and judge her without prejudice; but was she anxious that he should read her inmost soul?   On the other hand, could she deceive a being to whom all her thoughts had ever been exposed as clearly as crystal, and from whom no sentiment had ever been concealed?   These reflections made her anxious and thoughtful.   Her mind still dwelt on Werther, who was now lost to her, but whom she could not bring herself to resign, and for whom she knew nothing was left but despair if she should be lost to him for ever."

"Das klare Wetter konnte wenig auf sein trübes Gemüt wirken, ein dumpfer Druck lag auf seiner Seele, die traurigen Bilder hatten sich bei ihm festgesetzt, und sein Gemüt kannte keine Bewegung als von einem schmerzlichen Gedanken zum andern.","The clear weather had little effect on his gloomy spirit, a dull pressure lay on his soul, the sad images had settled in his mind, and his spirit knew no movement but from one painful thought to the next.","The clear weather had little effect on his dour mood. His heart was heavy, his unhappy view of things was deeply rooted in him, and his spirit could only pass from one painful thought to the next.","The beautiful weather produced but little impression on his troubled spirit.   A heavy weight lay upon his soul, deep melancholy had taken possession of him, and his mind knew no change save from one painful thought to another."
"Morgen gehe ich von hier ab, und weil mein Geburtsort nur sechs Meilen vom Wege liegt, so will ich den auch wiedersehen, will mich der alten, glücklich verträumten Tage erinnern. Zu eben dem Tore will ich hinein gehn, aus dem meine Mutter mit mir heraus fuhr, als sie nach dem Tode meines Vaters den lieben, vertraulichen Ort verließ, um sich in ihre unerträgliche Stadt einzusperren. Adieu, Wilhelm, du sollst von meinem Zuge hören.","Tomorrow I'm leaving here, and because the place where I was born is only six miles away, I want to see it again, I want to remember the old, happily dreaming days. I want to enter the very gate that my mother drove me out of when she left the dear, intimate place after my father's death to shut herself up in her unbearable city. Adieu, Wilhelm, you shall hear about my train.","Tomorrow I leave here, and since the place of my birth lies only six miles away, I want to visit it again and recall those happy, dreamlike days. I want to walk up to the gate through which my mother rode with me when she left that beloved, familiar place after my father’s death to incarcerate herself in the unbearable town she lives in now. Adieu, William. I shall report on the trip.","I leave this place to-morrow; and, as my native place is only six miles from the high road, I intend to visit it once more, and recall the happy dreams of my childhood.   I shall enter at the same gate through which I came with my mother, when, after my father's death, she left that delightful retreat to immure herself in your melancholy town.   Adieu, my dear friend: you shall hear of my future career."
"Endlich ward er mit dem traurigen Gedanken immer mehr verwandt und befreundet und sein Vorsatz fest und unwiderruflich, wovon folgender zweideutige Brief, den er an seinen Freund schrieb, ein Zeugnis abgibt.[100]","Finally, he became more and more related and friendly to the sad thought and his resolution firm and irrevocable, of which the following ambiguous letter, which he wrote to his friend, bears witness.[100]","In the end, he became more and more attuned to the melancholy idea; his decision became fixed and irrevocable. The following ambiguous letter, written to his friend, attests to this.","His appearance at length became quite altered by the effect of his melancholy thoughts; and his resolution was now finally and irrevocably taken, of which the following ambiguous letter, which he addressed to his friend, may appear to afford some proof."
"Wo ich hin will? Das laß dir im Vertrauen eröffnen. Vierzehn Tage muß ich doch noch hier bleiben, und dann habe ich mir weisgemacht, daß ich die Bergwerke im **schen besuchen wollte; ist aber im Grunde nichts dran, ich will nur Lotten wieder näher, das ist alles. Und ich lache über mein eigenes Herz – und tu' ihm seinen Willen.","Where do I want to go? Let me tell you in confidence. I still have to stay here for a fortnight, and then I made myself believe that I wanted to visit the mines in **; but basically there's nothing to it, I just want to get closer to Lotte, that's all. And I laugh at my own heart - and do it its will.","You would like to know where I am heading? Let me inform you, confidentially…I have to stay here two weeks more; then, I tell myself, I want to visit the mines in —. Of course there’s nothing to it, really, but that I want to be near Lotte. And I have to laugh at my heart as I do its bidding.","Whither am I going?   I will tell you in confidence. I am obliged to continue a fortnight longer here, and then I think it would be better for me to visit the mines in --.   But I am only deluding myself thus.   The fact is, I wish to be near Charlotte again, that is all.   I smile at the suggestions of my heart, and obey its dictates."
"Vorgestern kam der Medikus hier aus der Stadt hinaus zum Amtmann und fand mich auf der Erde unter Lottens Kindern, wie einige auf mir herumkrabbelten, andere mich neckten, und wie ich sie kitzelte und ein großes Geschrei mit ihnen erregte. Der Doktor, der eine sehr dogmatische Drahtpuppe ist, unterm Reden seine Manschetten in Falten legt und einen Kräusel ohne Ende herauszupft, fand dieses unter der Würde eines gescheiten Menschen; das merkte ich an seiner Nase. Ich ließ mich aber in nichts stören, ließ ihn sehr vernünftige Sachen abhandeln und baute den Kindern ihre Kartenhäuser wieder, die sie zerschlagen hatten. Auch ging er darauf in der Stadt herum und beklagte, des Amtmanns Kinder wären so schon ungezogen genug, der Werther verderbe sie nun völlig.","The day before yesterday the medicus came out of town to the bailiff and found me on the ground among Lotte's children, some crawling on me, others teasing me, and how I tickled them and excited a great hooting with them. The doctor, who is a very dogmatic wire doll, who folds his cuffs while he talks and pulls out a ruffle without end, found this beneath the dignity of a clever person; I could tell by his nose. But I didn't let myself be disturbed, I let him deal with very sensible things and rebuilt the children's houses of cards that they had smashed. After that he went around town and complained that the bailiff's children were already naughty enough that Werther was now spoiling them completely.","The day before yesterday the doctor from our town came out to the lodge and found me on the floor with several of Lotte’s children on top of me, the rest teasing me. He saw me tickling them and succeeding generally in creating an uproar. The doctor is a dogmatic puppet, constantly repleating his cuffs as he talks and pulling out a loose thread here and there. Of course, he found my behavior undignified for a man of my intellect. I could tell by the way he turned up his nose at the whole thing. I didn’t let it bother me, but as he went about his more sensible business, I rebuilt the children’s house of cards, which they had toppled; whereupon he went about town telling everyone that the magistrate’s children had always been wild, but now Werther was ruining them completely.","The day before yesterday, the physician came from the town to pay a visit to the judge.   He found me on the floor playing with Charlotte's children.   Some of them were scrambling over me, and others romped with me; and, as I caught and tickled them, they made a great noise.   The doctor is a formal sort of personage: he adjusts the plaits of his ruffles, and continually settles his frill whilst he is talking to you; and he thought my conduct beneath the dignity of a sensible man.   I could perceive this by his countenance.   But I did not suffer myself to be disturbed.   I allowed him to continue his wise conversation, whilst I rebuilt the children's card houses for them as fast as they threw them down.   He went about the town afterward, complaining that the judge's children were spoiled enough before, but that now Werther was completely ruining them."
"Aber, ach, ich fühle es, Gott gibt Regen und Sonnenschein nicht unserm ungestümen Bitten, und jene Zeiten, deren Andenken mich quält, warum waren sie so selig, als weil ich mit Geduld seinen Geist erwartete und die Wonne, die er über mich ausgoß, mit ganzem, innig dankbarem Herzen aufnahm!","But, alas, I feel it, God does not give rain and sunshine to our impetuous entreaties, and those times whose memory torments me, why were they so blessed as to patiently await his Spirit, and the delights he shed upon me , with a whole, heartfelt thankful heart!","But oh, I can feel it. God gives no rain or sunshine in answer to our tempestuous pleas, and those bygone days, the memory of which torments me now, why were they so blissful if not because I waited then in patience for His grace and received the bliss He chose to bestow upon me with a whole and deeply grateful heart?","But I feel that God does not grant sunshine or rain to our importunate entreaties.   And oh, those bygone days, whose memory now torments me! why were they so fortunate?   Because I then waited with patience for the blessings of the Eternal, and received his gifts with the grateful feelings of a thankful heart."

"Und das glänzende Elend, die Langeweile unter dem garstigen Volke, das sich hier neben einander sieht! die Rangsucht unter ihnen, wie sie nur wachen und aufpassen, einander ein Schrittchen abzugewinnen; die elendesten,[62] erbärmlichsten Leidenschaften, ganz ohne Röckchen. Da ist ein Weib, zum Exempel, die jedermann von ihrem Adel und ihrem Lande unterhält, so daß jeder Fremde denken muß: Das ist eine Närrin, die sich auf das bißchen Adel und auf den Ruf ihres Landes Wunderstreiche einbildet. – Aber es ist noch viel ärger: eben das Weib ist hier aus der Nachbarschaft eine Amtschreiberstochter. – Sieh, ich kann das Menschengeschlecht nicht begreifen, das so wenig Sinn hat, um sich so platt zu prostituieren.","And the brilliant misery, the boredom among the nasty people who see themselves here side by side! the ranks among them, just watching and careful to gain a little step from each other; the most miserable,[62] most wretched passions, without a skirt at all. There is a woman, for example, who entertains everyone about her nobility and her country, so that every stranger must think: She is a fool who prides herself on miraculous tricks on the little nobility and the reputation of her country. - But it's even worse: the woman here from the neighborhood is a clerk's daughter. – See, I cannot understand the human race that has so little sense to prostitute itself so flatly.","And the glittering misery, the boredom of the perfectly horrible people I meet here! Their social aspirations! In their efforts to gain the slightest precedence they can’t take their eyes off the next fellow. The most abject passions are displayed quite shamelessly. There is one woman, for instance, who can talk of nothing but her titles and her estates. One doesn’t have to know her to realize that she is a complete fool who flatters herself with paltry titles and has an inflated provincial pride. But the worst part of it is, she is actually nothing more than the daughter of a local magistrate. I cannot understand how people can be so insensitive as to prostitute themselves in such a vulgar fashion.","Oh, the brilliant wretchedness, the weariness, that one is doomed to witness among the silly people whom we meet in society here! The ambition of rank!   How they watch, how they toil, to gain precedence!   What poor and contemptible passions are displayed in their utter nakedness!   We have a woman here, for example, who never ceases to entertain the company with accounts of her family and her estates.   Any stranger would consider her a silly being, whose head was turned by her pretensions to rank and property; but she is in reality even more ridiculous, the daughter of a mere magistrate's clerk from this neighbourhood.   I cannot understand how human beings can so debase themselves."
"Wir schlangen uns in Menuetts um einander herum; ich forderte ein Frauenzimmer nach dem andern auf, und just die unleidlichsten konnten nicht dazu kommen, einem die Hand zu reichen und ein Ende zu machen. Lotte und ihr Tänzer fingen einen Englischen an, und wie wohl mir's war, als sie auch in der Reihe die Figur mit uns anfing, magst du fühlen. Tanzen muß man sie sehen! Siehst du, sie ist so mit ganzem Herzen und mit ganzer Seele dabei, ihr ganzer Körper eine Harmonie, so sorglos, so unbefangen, als wenn das eigentlich alles wäre, als wenn sie sonst nichts dächte, nichts empfände; und in dem Augenblicke gewiß schwindet alles andere vor ihr.","We twined around each other in minuets; I challenged one woman after the other, and the most insufferable ones just couldn't get around to shaking hands and putting an end to it. Lotte and her dancer began an English dance, and you can feel how happy I felt when she also began the figure with us in the row. You have to see them dance! You see, she's so into it with all her heart and soul, her whole body in harmony, so carefree, so uninhibited, as if that were really all, as if she thought nothing else, felt nothing; and in that moment surely everything else vanishes before her.","One minuet followed another, and I asked one young lady after another to dance with me and it was always the most unattractive ones, of course, who would not end the figure. Lotte and her partner opened a quadrille, and you can imagine how delighted I was when the time came for them to start a figure with us. You should see her dance! She is so completely absorbed by motion, she dances with her whole heart, body, and soul. The result is harmony, so carefree and natural, as if there were nothing to life but dancing, as if she never gave anything else a thought—and I am sure that in such moments everything else is gone from her mind.","We commenced with a minuet.   I led out one lady after another, and precisely those who were the most disagreeable could not bring themselves to leave off.   Charlotte and her partner began an English country dance, and you must imagine my delight when it was their turn to dance the figure with us.   You should see Charlotte dance. She dances with her whole heart and soul: her figure is all harmony, elegance, and grace, as if she were conscious of nothing else, and had no other thought or feeling; and, doubtless, for the moment, every other sensation is extinct."
"Wenn er mir von ihrer rechtschaffenen Mutter erzählt: wie sie auf ihrem Todbette Lotten ihr Haus und ihre Kinder übergeben und ihm Lotten anbefohlen habe, wie seit der Zeit ein ganz anderer Geist Lotten belebt habe, wie sie, in der Sorge für ihre Wirtschaft und in dem Ernste, eine wahre Mutter geworden, wie kein Augenblick ihrer Zeit ohne tätige Liebe, ohne Arbeit verstrichen, und dennoch ihre Munterkeit, ihr leichter Sinn sie nie dabei verlassen habe. – Ich gehe so neben ihm hin und pflücke Blumen am Wege, füge sie sehr sorgfältig in einen Strauß und – werfe[44] sie in den vorüberfließenden Strom und sehe ihnen nach, wie sie leise hinunterwallen. – Ich weiß nicht, ob ich dir geschrieben habe, daß Albert hier bleiben und ein Amt mit einem artigen Auskommen vom Hofe erhalten wird, wo er sehr beliebt ist. In Ordnung und Emsigkeit in Geschäften habe ich wenig seinesgleichen gesehen.","When he tells me about her righteous mother: how she handed over her house and her children to Lotten on her deathbed and entrusted Lotten to him, how a completely different spirit has animated Lotten since then, like her, in the care for her economy and in Seriously, she has become a true mother, as not a moment of her time passed without active love, without work, and yet her cheerfulness, her light spirit never deserted her. - I walk beside him and pick flowers by the way, put them very carefully into a bouquet and - throw them into the passing stream and watch them gently trickle down. - I don't know if I wrote to you that Albert will stay here and get a job with a decent income from the court, where he is very popular. In order and industry in business I have seen few equals.","He talks to me about her good mother—how, on her deathbed, she handed over house and children to Lotte, who since then has been quite changed; how, through having to care for a household and face the more serious aspects of life, she has become a real mother, and not a moment of her time passes without work or an act of love; how, in spite of all this, her blitheness and vitality have never forsaken her. I wander along at his side, pick flowers, arrange them carefully into a bouquet and…throw them into the stream rushing by and look after them as they are slowly sucked down. I don’t know whether I wrote to you that Albert intends to remain here, and that the Prince will let him have a tidy little income because he is well liked at court. I have rarely seen his equal when it comes to orderliness and diligence in matters of business.","He tells me sometimes of her excellent mother; how, upon her death-bed, she had committed her house and children to Charlotte, and had given Charlotte herself in charge to him; how, since that time, a new spirit had taken possession of her; how, in care and anxiety for their welfare, she became a real mother to them; how every moment of her time was devoted to some labour of love in their behalf, -- and yet her mirth and cheerfulness had never forsaken her.   I walk by his side, pluck flowers by the way, arrange them carefully into a nosegay, then fling them into the first stream I pass, and watch them as they float gently away.   I forget whether I told you that Albert is to remain here.   He has received a government appointment, with a very good salary; and I understand he is in high favour at court.   I have met few persons so punctual and methodical in business."
"Ja, liebe Lotte, ich will alles besorgen und bestellen; geben Sie mir nur mehr Aufträge, nur recht oft. Um eins bitte ich Sie: keinen Sand mehr auf die Zettelchen, die Sie mir schreiben. Heute führte ich es schnell nach der Lippe, und die Zähne knisterten mir.","Yes, dear Lotte, I want to take care of and order everything; just give me more orders, just quite often. I ask you one thing: no more sand on the notes you write to me. Today I quickly brought it to my lip and my teeth crackled.","Yes, dear Lotte, I shall attend to everything, only please give me more errands to do and give them to me more often. And one more request: no more sand, please, on the little notes you write to me. Today I pressed your letter to my lips and felt the grains on my teeth.","Yes, dear Charlotte!   I will order and arrange everything.   Only give me more commissions, the more the better.   One thing, however, I must request: use no more writing-sand with the dear notes you send me.   Today I raised your letter hastily to my lips, and it set my teeth on edge."
"Du wirst mir also nicht übelnehmen, wenn ich dir dein ganzes Argument einräume und mich doch zwischen dem Entweder – Oder durchzustehlen suche.",So you won't take it amiss if I concede your whole argument to you and still try to steal through between the either-or.,"So you won’t be offended with me, I hope, if I concede your entire argument and try to squeeze through between the either and the or!","You will, therefore, permit me to concede your entire argument, and yet contrive means to escape your dilemma."
"Ich begreife manchmal nicht, wie sie ein anderer lieb haben kann, lieb haben darf, da ich sie so ganz allein, so innig, so voll liebe, nichts anders kenne, noch weiß, noch habe als sie!","Sometimes I don't understand how someone else can love her, be allowed to love her, since I love her so completely, so deeply, so completely, know nothing else, nor know nor have anything else than her!","Sometimes I simply cannot understand how she can love another, how she dare—since I love her alone, so deeply, so fully, and recognize nothing, know nothing, have nothing but her!","I sometimes cannot understand how she can love another, how she dares love another, when I love nothing in this world so completely, so devotedly, as I love her, when I know only her, and have no other possession."
"Aus dem Blut auf der Lehne des Sessels konnte man schließen, er habe sitzend vor dem Schreibtische die Tat vollbracht, dann ist er heruntergesunken, hat sich konvulsivisch um den Stuhl herumgewälzt. Er lag gegen das Fenster entkräftet auf dem Rücken, war in völliger Kleidung, gestiefelt, im blauen Frack mit gelber Weste.","From the blood on the back of the chair one could deduce that he had committed the deed while sitting in front of the desk, then he sank down and rolled convulsively around the chair. He was lying exhausted on his back against the window, fully dressed, with boots, in a blue coat with a yellow waistcoat.","The blood on the armchair was evidence of the fact that he had shot himself while sitting in front of his desk, then had slumped down and twisted himself convulsively out of the chair. He was lying on his back, against the window, fully clad in his blue coat and yellow vest, with his boots on.",">From the blood which flowed from the chair, it could be inferred that he had committed the rash act sitting at his bureau, and that he afterward fell upon the floor.   He was found lying on his back near the window.   He was in full-dress costume."
"Gegen zehn Uhr rief Werther seinem Bedienten, und unter dem Anziehen sagte er ihm, wie er in einigen Tagen verreisen würde, er solle daher die Kleider auskehren und alles zum Einpacken zurecht machen; auch gab er ihm Befehl, überall Kontos zu fordern, einige ausgeliehene Bücher abzuholen und einigen Armen, denen er wöchentlich etwas zu geben gewohnt war, ihr Zugeteiltes auf zwei Monate voraus zu bezahlen.","About ten o'clock Werther called his servant, and while he was getting dressed he told him how he was going to go away in a few days, so he should sweep out his clothes and get everything ready for packing; He also ordered him to ask for accounts everywhere, to fetch some borrowed books, and to pay two months in advance to a few poor people, to whom he was accustomed to give something every week.","At about ten, Werther called his servant and, as he dressed, told him that in a few days he intended to go on a journey. The man should therefore lay out his clothes and get ready to pack them. He also gave orders to collect all outstanding accounts, pick up several books he had loaned to various people, and pay two months in advance to a few poor souls to whom he customarily gave a little something every week.","About ten in the morning, Werther called his servant, and, whilst he was dressing, told him that in a few days he intended to set out upon a journey, and bade him therefore lay his clothes in order, and prepare them for packing up, call in all his accounts, fetch home the books he had lent, and give two months' pay to the poor dependants who were accustomed to receive from him a weekly allowance."

"Nein, ich betriege mich nicht! Ich lese in ihren schwarzen Augen wahre Teilnehmung an mir und meinem Schicksal. Ja ich fühle, und darin darf ich meinem Herzen trauen, daß sie – o darf ich, kann ich den Himmel in diesen Worten aussprechen? – daß sie mich liebt!","No, I'm not cheating! I read in her black eyes true sympathy for me and my fate. Yes, I feel, and I can trust my heart in this, that she - oh may I, can I express heaven in these words? - that she loves me!","No, I am not deceived—I can read true sympathy in her dark eyes. Yes, I feel…and here I know I can trust my heart… that she…dare I, can I express heaven in a few words?","No, I am not deceived.

Yes, I feel it; and I may believe my own heart which tells me -- dare I say it? -- dare I pronounce the divine words? -- that she loves me!"

"Den Vorhang aufzuheben und dahinter zu treten! das ist alles! Und warum das Zaudern und Zagen? Weil man nicht weiß, wie es dahinten aussieht? und man nicht wiederkehrt? Und daß das nun die Eigenschaft unseres Geistes ist, da Verwirrung und Finsternis zu ahnen, wovon wir nichts Bestimmtes wissen.«","Pick up the curtain and step behind it! that's all! And why the hesitation and hesitation? Because you don't know what it looks like back there? and one does not return? And that it is now our spirit's quality to anticipate confusion and darkness, of which we know nothing definite.""","“Oh, to be able to lift the curtain and step behind it! That is all there is to it—so why do I hesitate? Because no one knows what it looks like back there? Because no one ever returns? And because it is characteristic of our spirit to anticipate confusion and darkness in what we do not know?”","""One lifts up the curtain, and passes to the other side, -- that is all!   And why all these doubts and delays?

"Ich danke deiner Liebe, Wilhelm, daß du das Wort so aufgefangen hast. Ja, du hast recht: mir wäre besser, ich ginge. Der Vorschlag, den du zu einer Rückkehr zu euch tust, gefällt mir nicht ganz; wenigstens möchte ich noch gern einen Umweg machen, besonders da wir anhaltenden Frost und gute Wege zu hoffen haben. Auch ist mir es sehr lieb, daß du kommen willst, mich abzuholen; verziehe nur noch vierzehn Tage, und erwarte noch einen Brief von mir mit dem Weiteren. Es ist nötig, daß nichts gepflückt werde, ehe es reif ist. Und vierzehn Tage auf oder ab tun viel. Meiner Mutter sollst du sagen: daß sie für ihren Sohn beten soll, und daß ich sie um Vergebung bitte wegen alles Verdrusses, den ich ihr gemacht habe. Das war nun mein Schicksal, die zu betrüben, denen ich Freude schuldig war. Leb' wohl, mein Teuerster! Allen Segen des Himmels über dich! Leb' wohl!«","I thank your love, Wilhelm, that you caught the word like that. Yes, you are right: I would be better off going. I don't quite like the suggestion you are making about a return to yourselves; at least I would still like to make a detour, especially as we can hope for persistent frost and good roads. I am also very pleased that you want to come and fetch me; only wait a fortnight and expect a letter from me with the rest. It is necessary that nothing be plucked before it is ripe. And a fortnight up or down does a lot. You are to tell my mother to pray for her son and to ask her forgiveness for all the trouble I have caused her. This was my destiny now, to grieve those to whom I owed joy. Farewell, my dearest! All the blessings of heaven upon you! Farewell!«","I can thank your love for me, William, for the fact that you understand me as you did. You are right; it would be best for me to leave. Your suggestion that I return to you does not wholly suit me; at any rate, I would like to go out of my way a little, especially since we can count on a long period of frost and good roads. But it suits me very well that you want to come and fetch me; only please let a fortnight pass and wait for one more letter from me. Nothing should be plucked until it is ripe, and a fortnight more or less can make quite a difference. Please ask my mother to pray for me and tell her that I beg her to forgive me for all the trouble I have caused her. It happened to be my fate to distress those to whom I should have brought joy. Farewell, best of friends! May all the blessings of heaven be yours! Farewell!","I am grateful to your love, Wilhelm, for having repeated your advice so seasonably.   Yes, you are right: it is undoubtedly better that I should depart.   But I do not entirely approve your scheme of returning at once to your neighbourhood; at least, I should Iike to make a little excursion on the way, particularly as we may now expect a continued frost, and consequently good roads.   I am much pleased with your intention of coming to fetch me; only delay your journey for a fortnight, and wait for another letter from me.   One should gather nothing before it is ripe, and a fortnight sooner or later makes a great difference.   Entreat my mother to pray for her son, and tell her I beg her pardon for all the unhappiness I have occasioned her.   It has ever been my fate to give pain to those whose happiness I should have promoted. Adieu, my dearest friend.   May every blessing of Heaven attend you!   Farewell."
"Die ganze Gewalt dieser Worte fiel über den Unglücklichen. Er warf sich vor Lotten nieder in der vollen Verzweifelung, faßte ihre Hände, drückte sie in seine Augen, wider seine Stirn, und ihr schien eine Ahnung seines schrecklichen Vorhabens durch die Seele zu fliegen. Ihre Sinne verwirrten sich, sie drückte seine Hände, drückte sie wider ihre Brust, neigte sich mit einer wehmütigen Bewegung zu ihm, und ihre glühenden Wangen berührten sich. Die Welt verging ihnen. Er schlang seine Arme um sie her, preßte sie an seine Brust und deckte ihre zitternden, stammelnden Lippen mit wütenden Küssen. – »Werther!« rief sie mit erstickter Stimme, sich abwendend, »Werther!«, und drückte mit schwacher Hand seine Brust von der ihrigen; »Werther!« rief sie mit dem gefaßten Tone des edelsten Gefühles. – Er widerstand nicht, ließ sie aus seinen Armen und warf sich unsinnig vor sie hin. – Sie riß sich auf, und in ängstlicher Verwirrung, bebend zwischen Liebe und Zorn, sagte sie: »Das ist das letzte Mal! Werther! Sie sehn mich nicht wieder.« Und mit dem vollsten Blick der Liebe auf den Elenden eilte sie ins Nebenzimmer und schloß hinter sich zu. – Werther streckte ihr die Arme nach, getraute sich nicht, sie zu halten. Er lag an der Erde, den Kopf auf dem Kanapee, und in dieser Stellung blieb er über eine halbe Stunde, bis ihn ein Geräusch zu sich selbst rief. Es war das Mädchen, das den Tisch decken wollte. Er ging im Zimmer auf und ab, und da er sich wieder allein sah, ging er zur Türe des Kabinetts und rief mit leiser Stimme: »Lotte! Lotte! nur noch ein Wort! Ein Lebewohl!« – Sie schwieg. – Er harrte und bat und harrte; dann riß er sich weg und rief: »Lebe wohl, Lotte! Auf ewig lebe wohl!«","All the power of these words fell upon the unfortunate. He threw himself down before Lotte in utter despair, took her hands, pressed them into his eyes, against his forehead, and a presentiment of his terrible plan seemed to fly through her soul. Her senses confused, she squeezed his hands, pressed them against her breast, leaned toward him with a wistful movement, and their flushed cheeks touched. The world passed them. He wrapped his arms around her, pressed her to his chest and covered her trembling, stammering lips with angry kisses. ""Werther!"" she cried in a choked voice, turning away, ""Werther!"" and pressed his breast from hers with a weak hand; ""Werther!"" she cried in the composed tone of noblest feeling. – He didn't resist, let her out of his arms and threw himself senselessly in front of her. - She tore herself up and in anxious confusion, trembling between love and anger, she said: ""This is the last time! Werther! You won't see me again.' And with the fullest look of love on the wretched man she hurried into the next room and locked it behind her. - Werther stretched out his arms after her, didn't dare to hold her. He lay on the ground, his head on the sofa, and stayed in that position for more than half an hour, until a noise called him to himself. It was the girl who wanted to set the table. He paced up and down the room, and seeing himself alone again, he went to the cabinet door and called out in a low voice: ""Lotte! Lotte!"" Lotte! just one more word! Farewell!' She said nothing. – He waited and begged and waited; then he tore himself away and cried: ""Farewell, Lotte! Farewell forever!”","The full force of the words rained down upon the unfortunate man. In his despair he threw himself on his knees before Lotte, took her hand, pressed it to his eyes, his forehead, and a hint of the terrible thing he was planning seemed to brush Lotte’s soul. She became confused and pressed his hand tightly against her breast and, with a plaintive motion, moved closer to him. Their burning cheeks touched, and the world ended for them. Werther wound his arms around Lotte, pressed her to him, and covered her trembling, stammering lips with passionate kisses. “Werther!” she cried, in a voice that was choked, turning from him, “Werther!” and with her weak hand, she pushed him away. “Werther!” she said, in a voice controlled by the noblest sentiments. He did nothing to resist her. He let her go and threw himself down insensibly at her feet. She managed to tear herself away and, in fearful confusion, trembling between love and anger, said, “This is the last time, Werther! You shall not see me again,” and with a look full of love at the miserable man, she rushed into the next room and locked the door. Werther stretched out his arms to her, but did not dare to stop her. He lay on the floor, his head resting against the side of the sofa, and remained like this for over half an hour, until a noise roused him. It was the maid, coming to set the table. He paced up and down the room and when he was alone again, walked over to the door of the room into which Lotte had fled and called softly, “Lotte…Lotte…only a word of farewell!” She was silent. He waited and begged and waited. Finally he tore himself away, crying, “Farewell, Lotte! Farewell forever!”","The whole force of these words fell upon the unfortunate Werther. Full of despair, he threw himself at Charlotte's feet, seized her hands, and pressed them to his eyes and to his forehead.   An apprehension of his fatal project now struck her for the first time.   Her senses were bewildered: she held his hands, pressed them to her bosom; and, leaning toward him with emotions of the tenderest pity, her warm cheek touched his.   They lost sight of everything.   The world disappeared from their eyes.   He clasped her in his arms, strained her to his bosom, and covered her trembling lips with passionate kisses.   ""Werther!"" she cried with a faint voice, turning herself away;  ""Werther!"" and, with a feeble hand, she pushed him from her.   At length, with the firm voice of virtue, she exclaimed, ""Werther!"" He resisted not, but, tearing himself from her arms, fell on his knees before her.   Charlotte rose, and, with disordered grief, in mingled tones of love and resentment, she exclaimed, ""It is the last time, Werther!   You shall never see me any more!""   Then, casting one last, tender look upon her unfortunate lover, she rushed into the adjoining room, and locked the door.   Werther held out his arms, but did not dare to detain her.   He continued on the ground, with his head resting on the sofa, for half an hour, till he heard a noise which brought him to his senses.   The servant entered.   He then walked up and down the room; and, when he was again left alone, he went to Charlotte's door, and, in a low voice, said, ""Charlotte, Charlotte! but one word more, one last adieu!""   She returned no answer.   He stopped, and listened and entreated; but all was silent.   At length he tore himself from the place, crying, ""Adieu, Charlotte, adieu for ever!"""
"Eure Idee will noch nicht die meinige werden, daß ich mit dem Gesandten nach *** gehen soll. Ich liebe die Subordination nicht sehr, und wir wissen alle, daß der Mann noch dazu ein widriger Mensch ist. Meine Mutter möchte mich gern in Aktivität haben, sagst du, das hat mich zu lachen gemacht. Bin ich jetzt nicht auch aktiv, und ist's im Grunde nicht einerlei, ob ich Erbsen zähle oder Linsen? Alles in der Welt läuft doch auf eine Lumperei hinaus, und ein Mensch, der um anderer willen, ohne daß es seine eigene Leidenschaft, sein eigenes Bedürfnis ist, sich um Geld oder Ehre oder sonst was abarbeitet, ist immer ein Tor.","Your idea that I should go to *** with the ambassador does not yet want to become mine. I don't like submission very much, and we all know that man is an ugly man at that. My mother would like me to be active, you say, that made me laugh. Am I not active now, and isn't it basically the same whether I'm counting peas or lentils? Everything in the world boils down to sloppiness, and a man who works for money or honor or whatever for the sake of others, without it being his own passion or need, is always a fool.","I can’t agree with you that I should go to——with our ambassador. I don’t like subordination, and we know only too well that the man is obnoxious. My mother, you say, would like to see me actively employed. I have to laugh. Am I not actively employed now, and does it make any difference, really, whether I am sorting peas or lentils? Everything on earth can be reduced to a triviality and the man who, to please another, wears himself out for money, honor, what you will, is a fool.","I cannot assent to your proposal that I should accompany the ambassador to _______.   I do not love subordination; and we all know that he is a rough, disagreeable person to be connected with. You say my mother wishes me to be employed.   I could not help laughing at that.   Am I not sufficiently employed?   And is it not in reality the same, whether I shell peas or count lentils?   The world runs on from one folly to another; and the man who, solely from regard to the opinion of others, and without any wish or necessity of his own, toils after gold, honour, or any other phantom, is no better than a fool."
"Ich danke dir, Albert, daß du mich betrogen hast: ich wartete auf Nachricht, wann euer Hochzeittag sein würde, und hatte mir vorgenommen, feierlichst an demselben Lottens Schattenriß von der Wand zu nehmen und ihn unter andere Papiere zu begraben. Nun seid ihr ein Paar, und ihr Bild ist noch hier! Nun, so soll es bleiben! Und warum nicht? Ich weiß, ich bin ja auch bei euch, bin dir unbeschadet in Lottens Herzen, habe, ja ich habe den zweiten Platz darin und will und muß ihn behalten.

Leb' wohl, Lotte!","I thank you, Albert, for cheating me: I waited for news of when your wedding day would be, and I had resolved to solemnly take Lotte's silhouette down from the wall and bury it under other papers. Now you are a couple and your picture is still here! Well, let it stay that way! And why not? I know I'm with you too, I'm not harmed in Lotte's heart, I have, yes I have, second place in it and I want and have to keep it.

I waited to be told the day of your wedding, and it was my intention, on that day, to go through the ceremony of taking the little silhouette I made of Lotte down from the wall and burying it with some other papers. Now you are united, and her picture is where it always has been. Very well, let it remain there. And why not? I know that I am with you too and have a place in Lotte’s heart that does you no harm. I would go so far as to say second place and I want to hold onto it—must hold onto it! I think if she forgot me, I would go mad. Albert, all hell lies in the very thought!

"Ich habe mir schon manchmal vorgenommen, sie nicht so oft zu sehn. Ja wer das halten könnte! Alle Tage unterlieg' ich der Versuchung und verspreche mir heilig: morgen willst du einmal wegbleiben. Und wenn der Morgen kommt, finde ich doch wieder eine unwiderstehliche Ursache, und ehe ich mich's versehe, bin ich bei ihr. Entweder sie hat des Abends gesagt: »Sie kommen doch morgen?« – Wer könnte da wegbleiben? Oder sie gibt mir einen Auftrag, und ich finde schicklich, ihr selbst die Antwort zu bringen; oder der Tag ist gar zu schön, ich gehe nach Wahlheim, und wenn ich nun da bin, ist's nur noch eine halbe Stunde zu ihr! – Ich bin zu nah in der Atmosphäre – Zuck! so bin ich dort. Meine Großmutter hatte ein Märchen vom Magnetenberg: die Schiffe, die zu nahe kamen, wurden auf einmal alles Eisenwerks beraubt, die Nägel flogen dem Berge zu, und die armen Elenden scheiterten zwischen den übereinanderstürzenden Brettern.","I've made it a point not to see her that often. Yes, who could hold that! Every day I succumb to temptation and make a sacred promise to myself: tomorrow you want to stay away. And when the morning comes I find another irresistible cause and before I know it I'm with it. Either she said in the evening: ""You're coming tomorrow?"" - who could stay away? Or she gives me an assignment and I find it fitting to bring her the answer myself; or the day is just too nice, I'm going to Wahlheim, and now that I'm there it's only half an hour to her! - I'm too close in the atmosphere - Zuck! that's how i am there. My grandmother had a fairy tale about the Magnet Mountain: the ships that came too close were suddenly robbed of all their ironworks, the nails flew towards the mountain, and the poor wretches foundered between the planks falling one on top of the other.","Every now and then I make up my mind to see her less often—as if anyone could possibly adhere to such a rule! Every day I give in to temptation and swear that tomorrow I will stay away, but when tomorrow comes, I of course find an absolutely irresistible reason for going to see her, and before I know it—there I am! Perhaps it is because she said the evening before, “Will you be coming tomorrow?” So who could stay away? Or she asked me to attend to something, and I tell myself that the only proper thing to do is go personally to inform her that it has been done. Or the day is so beautiful that I go to Wahlheim and, once I am there…well, after all, she is only half an hour away. I am too close to her aura…whoosh! and I am there. My grandmother used to tell a fairy tale about the Magnet Mountain: The ships that came too close to it were robbed suddenly of all their metal; even the nails flew to the mountain, and the miserable sailors foundered in a crash of falling timber.","I have often determined not to see her so frequently.   But who could keep such a resolution?   Every day I am exposed to the temptation, and promise faithfully that to-morrow I will really stay away: but, when tomorrow comes, I find some irresistible reason for seeing her; and, before I can account for it, I am with her again.   Either she has said on the previous evening ""You will be sure to call to-morrow,"" -- and who could stay away then? --or she gives me some commission, and I find it essential to take her the answer in person; or the day is fine, and I walk to Walheim; and, when I am there, it is only half a league farther to her.   I am within the charmed atmosphere, and soon find myself at her side. My grandmother used to tell us a story of a mountain of loadstone. When any vessels came near it, they were instantly deprived of their ironwork: the nails flew to the mountain, and the unhappy crew perished amidst the disjointed planks."
"Wilhelm, was ist unserem Herzen die Welt ohne Liebe! Was eine Zauberlaterne ist ohne Licht! Kaum bringst du das Lämpchen hinein, so scheinen dir die buntesten Bilder an deine weiße Wand! Und wenn's nichts wäre als das, als vorübergehende Phantome, so macht's doch immer unser Glück, wenn wir wie frische Jungen davor stehen und uns über die Wundererscheinungen entzücken. Heute konnte ich nicht zu Lotten, eine unvermeidliche Gesellschaft hielt mich ab. Was war zu tun? Ich schickte meinen Diener hinaus, nur um einen Menschen um mich zu haben, der ihr heute nahe gekommen wäre. Mit welcher Ungeduld ich ihn erwartete, mit welcher Freude ich ihn wiedersah! Ich hätte ihn gern beim Kopfe genommen und geküßt, wenn ich mich nicht geschämt hätte.[39]","Wilhelm, what is the world without love to our hearts! What a magic lantern is without light! As soon as you put the lamp in, the most colorful pictures appear on your white wall! And even if it were nothing but that, as passing phantoms, it always makes our happiness when we stand in front of it like fresh boys and delight in the miraculous phenomena. Today I couldn't go to Lotten, an unavoidable company held me back. What was to be done? I sent my servant out just to have someone around who would have come close to her today. With what impatience I awaited him, with what joy I saw him again! I would gladly have taken his head and kissed him if I had not been ashamed.[39]","William, what is life worth without love? A magic lantern without light. All you have to do is put in the light, and it produces the loveliest colored pictures on a white wall. And if there is nothing more to it than these oh, so transient phantoms, always it denotes happiness when we stand in front of it like naïve boys and are enchanted by the magical visions. Today an unavoidable gathering prevented me from visiting Lotte. What could I do? I sent over my servant, if only to have someone about me who had been near her! The impatience with which I waited for him and the joy, when I saw him return, are indescribable! I would have liked to embrace and kiss him, but was, of course, too ashamed.","Wilhelm, what is the world to our hearts without love?   What is a magic-lantern without light?   You have but to kindle the flame within, and the brightest figures shine on the white wall; and, if love only show us fleeting shadows, we are yet happy, when, like mere children, we behold them, and are transported with the splendid phantoms.   I have not been able to see Charlotte to-day. I was prevented by company from which I could not disengage myself. What was to be done?   I sent my servant to her house, that I might at least see somebody to-day who had been near her.   Oh, the impatience with which I waited for his return!   the joy with which I welcomed him!   I should certainly have caught him in my arms, and kissed him, if I had not been ashamed."

"Da ich das Blatt wieder durchlese, seh' ich, daß ich das Ende der Geschichte zu erzählen vergessen habe, das sich aber leicht hinzudenken läßt. Sie erwehrte sich sein; ihr Bruder kam dazu, der ihn schon lange gehaßt, der ihn schon lange aus dem Hause gewünscht hatte, weil er fürchtet, durch eine neue Heirat der Schwester werde seinen Kindern die Erbschaft entgehn, die ihnen jetzt, da sie kinderlos ist, schöne Hoffnungen gibt; dieser habe ihn gleich zum Hause hinausgestoßen und einen solchen Lärm von der Sache gemacht, daß die Frau, auch selbst wenn sie gewollt, ihn nicht wieder hätte aufnehmen können. Jetzt habe sie wieder einen andern Knecht genommen, auch über den, sage man, sei sie mit dem Bruder zerfallen, und man behaupte für gewiß, sie werde ihn heiraten, aber er sei fest entschlossen, das nicht zu erleben.","As I read the sheet again, I see that I forgot to tell the end of the story, which is easy to think of. She resisted his; her brother came along, who hated him for a long time, who had wanted him out of the house for a long time, because he feared that his sister's remarriage would deprive his children of the inheritance that gives them good hopes now that she is childless ; The latter immediately pushed him out of the house and made such a fuss about the matter that the woman could not have picked him up again, even if she had wanted to. Now she had hired another servant, also over whom, it was said, she had fallen out with her brother, and it was said with certainty that she would marry him, but he was determined not to experience that.","On rereading this page, I see that I have forgotten to tell you the end of the story. It isn’t difficult to guess. She rejected him. Her brother happened upon them. He had always hated the poor fellow and wished him out of the house because he feared his sister might marry again, and his children thereby lose the inheritance that he had high hopes would be theirs, because the woman is childless. The brother threw him out and noised the whole thing abroad to such an extent that she could not possibly have taken him back, even if she had wanted to. Then she took on another servant and it is rumored that she has had trouble with her brother about the new man too, but this time everyone feels sure she will marry him. My poor lad, however, is determined not to live to see it.","On perusing this letter a second time, I find I have omitted the conclusion of my tale; but it is easily supplied.   She became reserved toward him, at the instigation of her brother who had long hated him, and desired his expulsion from the house, fearing that his sister's second marriage might deprive his children of the handsome fortune they expected from her; as she is childless. He was dismissed at length; and the whole affair occasioned so much scandal, that the mistress dared not take him back, even if she had wished it.   She has since hired another servant, with whom, they say, her brother is equally displeased, and whom she is likely to marry; but my informant assures me that he himself is determined not to survive such a catastrophe."
"Sie sind vertraut, erzählen mir allerhand, und besonders ergetze ich mich an ihren Leidenschaften und simpeln Ausbrüchen des Begehrens, wenn mehr Kinder aus dem Dorfe sich versammeln.","They are familiar, tell me all sorts of things, and I particularly delight in their passions and simple outbursts of desire when more of the village children gather.","They confide in me, all sorts of things, but what amuses me most is their wildness, and their simple outbursts of self-assertion when they are joined by other children from the village.","They are quite at home with me, tell me everything; and I am particularly amused with observing their tempers, and the simplicity of their behaviour, when some of the other village children are assembled with them."
"Es ist wunderbar: wie ich hierher kam und vom Hügel in das schöne Tal schaute, wie es mich rings umher anzog. – Dort das Wäldchen! – Ach könntest du dich in seine Schatten mischen! – Dort die Spitze des Berges! – Ach könntest du von da die weite Gegend überschauen! – Die in einander geketteten Hügel und vertraulichen Täler! – O könnte ich mich in ihnen verlieren! – – Ich eilte hin, und kehrte zurück, und hatte nicht gefunden, was ich hoffte. O es ist mit der Ferne wie mit der Zukunft! Ein großes dämmerndes Ganze ruht vor unserer Seele, unsere Empfindung verschwimmt darin wie unser Auge, und wir sehnen uns, ach! unser ganzes Wesen hinzugeben, uns mit aller Wonne eines einzigen, großen, herrlichen Gefühls ausfüllen zu lassen. – Und ach! wenn wir hinzueilen, wenn das Dort nun Hier wird, ist alles vor wie nach, und wir stehen in unserer Armut, in unserer Eingeschränktheit, und unsere Seele lechzt nach entschlüpftem Labsale.","It's wonderful: how I came here and looked down from the hill into the beautiful valley, how it attracted me all around. – There the grove! – Oh, if only you could mingle in his shadows! – There the top of the mountain! – Oh, if you could see the wide area from there! – The interlinked hills and confidential valleys! – Oh, could I lose myself in them! - - I hastened and returned, and had not found what I hoped for. O it is with the distance as with the future! A great twilight whole rests in front of our soul, our feelings blur in it like our eyes, and we long, alas! to surrender our whole being, to let ourselves be filled with all the bliss of one great, glorious feeling. - And oh! when we hurry, when the there becomes here, everything is as before, and we stand in our poverty, in our limitations, and our soul thirsts for the refreshment that has slipped away.","It is truly marvelous—when I came here first and looked down into the valley from this hilltop—how the entire region attracted me. There…a little forest land…oh, to lose oneself in its shade…. There, a mountaintop…oh, to see the panorama from it! The rolling hills and enchanting valleys…I yearned to lose myself in them. I would hurry down, but return home without having found what I had hoped to find. Distance is like the future. A vast twilit entity lies before us, our perception is lost in it and becomes as blurred as our eyesight, and we yearn, ah, we yearn to surrender all of our Self and let ourselves be filled to the brim with a single, tremendous, magnificent emotion, but alas…when we hurry to the spot, when There becomes Here, everything is as it was before and we are left standing in our poverty and constraint, our souls longing for the balm that has eluded us.","It is so strange how, when I came here first, and gazed upon that lovely valley from the hillside, I felt charmed with the entire scene surrounding me.   The little wood opposite -- how delightful to sit under its shade!   How fine the view from that point of rock!   Then, that delightful chain of hills, and the exquisite valleys at their feet!   Could I but wander and lose myself amongst them!   I went, and returned without finding what I wished.   Distance, my friend, is like futurity.   A dim vastness is spread before our souls: the perceptions of our mind are as obscure as those of our vision; and we desire earnestly to surrender up our whole being, that it may be filled with the complete and perfect bliss of one glorious emotion.   But alas! when we have attained our object, when the distant there becomes the present here, all is changed: we are as poor and circumscribed as ever, and our souls still languish for unattainable happiness."
"Die Stadt selbst ist unangenehm, dagegen rings umher eine unaussprechliche Schönheit der Natur. Das bewog den verstorbenen Grafen von M.., einen Garten auf einem der Hügel anzulegen, die mit der schönsten Mannigfaltigkeit sich kreuzen und die lieblichsten Täler bilden. Der Garten ist einfach, und man fühlt gleich bei dem Eintritte, daß nicht ein wissenschaftlicher Gärtner, sondern ein fühlendes Herz den Plan gezeichnet, das seiner selbst hier genießen wollte. Schon manche Träne hab' ich dem Abgeschiedenen in dem verfallenen Kabinettchen geweint, das sein Lieblingsplätzchen war und auch meines ist. Bald werde ich Herr vom Garten sein; der Gärtner ist mir zugetan, nur seit den paar Tagen, und er wird sich nicht übel dabei befinden.[8]","The city itself is unpleasant, but all around is an unspeakable beauty of nature. This prompted the late Count von M.. to lay out a garden on one of the hills which, with the most beautiful variety, intersect and form the loveliest valleys. The garden is simple, and as soon as you enter you feel that the plan was drawn not by a scientific gardener but by a feeling heart that wanted to enjoy itself here. I've already cried many a tear to the departed man in the dilapidated little cabinet, which was his favorite spot and is mine too. Soon I will be master of the garden; the gardener is fond of me, just for the past few days, and he won't feel bad about it.[8]","The town itself is not attractive, but I find ample compensation in the indescribable beauties of nature surrounding it. That was what induced the late Count von M. to set his garden on one of the numerous hillsides that intersect here, forming the loveliest valleys. The garden is not elaborate, and the moment you walk into it you feel that it was designed by a sensitive heart rather than a scientific gardener, a heart that sought to find its enjoyment there. I have shed a few tears myself for the departed gentleman, in the little, broken-down summerhouse that used to be his favorite haunt and now is mine. Soon I will be master of the garden. The gardener seems to think well of me, though I have been here only a few days, and I will see to it that he enjoys working for me.","The town itself is disagreeable; but then, all around, you find an inexpressible beauty of nature.   This induced the late Count M to lay out a garden on one of the sloping hills which here intersect each other with the most charming variety, and form the most lovely valleys.   The garden is simple; and it is easy to perceive, even upon your first entrance, that the plan was not designed by a scientific gardener, but by a man who wished to give himself up here to the enjoyment of his own sensitive heart.   Many a tear have I already shed to the memory of its departed master in a summer-house which is now reduced to ruins, but was his favourite resort, and now is mine.   I shall soon be master of the place. The gardener has become attached to me within the last few days, and he will lose nothing thereby."
"Ich kehrte das Gesicht weg. Sie sollte es nicht tun, sollte nicht meine Einbildungskraft mit diesen Bildern himmlischer Unschuld und Seligkeit reizen und mein Herz aus dem Schlafe, in den es manchmal die Gleichgültigkeit des Lebens wiegt, nicht wecken! – Und warum nicht? – Sie traut mir so! sie weiß, wie ich sie liebe!","I turned my face away. She shouldn't do it, shouldn't provoke my imagination with these images of heavenly innocence and bliss, and shouldn't wake my heart from the slumber into which life's indifference sometimes lulls it! - And why not? - She trusts me so much! she knows how i love her!","I turned away. She should not have done it. She should not incite my imagination with such exhibitions of heavenly innocence and bliss; she should not rouse my heart, which the indifference of life sometimes rocks to sleep. And yet, why not? She trusts me. She knows how much I love her.","I turned my face away.   She should not act thus. She ought not to excite my imagination with such displays of heavenly innocence and happiness, nor awaken my heart from its slumbers, in which it dreams of the worthlessness of life!   And why not?   Because she knows how much I love her."
"Ach diese Lücke! diese entsetzliche Lücke, die ich hier in meinem Busen fühle! – Ich denke oft, wenn du sie nur einmal, nur einmal an dieses Herz drücken könntest, diese ganze Lücke würde ausgefüllt sein.","Oh that gap! this awful gap I feel here in my bosom! – I often think if you could just press her to this heart once, just once, this whole gap would be filled.","Oh, this void, this dreadful void in my breast! Often I think—if just once I could press her to my heart, it would be filled!","Alas! the void the fearful void, which I feel in my bosom!   Sometimes I think, if I could only once but once, press her to my heart, this dreadful void would be filled."
